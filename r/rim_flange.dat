5000|$|The wheel size is the {{diameter}} of the wheel in inches where the beads of the tire sit on the wheel. This measurement does not include the <b>rim</b> <b>flange.</b> Modern road tires have several measurements associated with their size as specified by tire codes like 225/70R14. The first number in the code (e.g., [...] "225") represents the nominal tire width in millimeters. This is followed by the aspect ratio (e.g.,"70"), which is the height of the side wall expressed {{as a percentage of the}} nominal width. [...] "R" [...] stands for radial and relates to the tire construction. The final number in the code (e.g.,"14") is the rim size measured in inches. The overall circumference of the tire will increase by increasing any of the tire's specifications. For example, increasing the width of the tire will also increase its circumference, because the side wall height is a proportional length. Increasing the aspect ratio will increase the height of the tire and hence the circumference.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Flanging is {{a method}} of sheet metal forming process under {{combined}} compressive and tensile conditions using a punch and die to raise closed <b>rims</b> (<b>flanges</b> or collars) on pierced holes. For the flanging product used for the automotive steering part, {{the thickness of the}} bottom radius area is very important because of the crack usually occurred during the using process. But during conventional flanging process, the thickness of the rim and the bottom radius area were decreased seriously and make the hole flanging not strong enough to be used. In order to increase the thickness of bottom radius area of the flanging wall, a new method that combines flanging process and cold forging process was proposed in this paper and a special forming die set was designed with a stripper subjected to counter-pressure with an aim to obtain a more substantial flange. FEM software DEFORM 3 D was employed to simulate these flanging part forming processes. The results showed the thickness of bottom radius area of the flanging wall was increased and a more substantial flange was obtained...|$|R

40|$|State-of-the-art {{development}} {{in the field of}} tire technology do show a clear trend toward extended-mobility-tires. These tires - also known as runflat tires - have reinforced side walls to guarantee basic mobility properties even in the case of air pressure loss. Since the individual layers as well as the complete build up are different to traditional tire technology, the enhanced layer stiffness generates higher loads to the <b>rim</b> <b>flanges,</b> wheel well and wheel disc. Although these tires seem to be perfectly compatible to conventional wheels with regard to design and mounting process, the stress loading as well as the structural durability of the wheel may be an issue, which has to be examined carefully: Are the design and cross-sectional properties of the wheels appropriate for the complete life cycle of the vehicle? Since automotive wheels are relevant for operational safety, these parts must not fail causing an accident. This has to be ensured by experimental methods such as rig based durability tests. While simplified test procedures such as cornering fatigue tests or radial fatigue tests do not cover the complete load mechanics by the tire, the unique BiAxial Wheel Fatigue Test facilities (ZWARP) were used to generate technical expertise in the field of runflat tires and their relation to the loading of the wheels. Since both loading as well as assembly interaction in the ZWARP are incorporated in a realistic manner, costs and time are saved due to an appropriate accelerated life testing and the elimination of specialized on-road testing...|$|R

40|$|During {{the past}} ten years, {{there has been a}} {{significant}} trend in automotive design using low aspect ratio tires and increasingly run-flat tires as well. In recent publications, the influence of those tire types on the dynamic loads – transferred from the road through the wheel into the car – have been examined pretty extensively, including comparative wheel force transducer measurements as well as computational results. It can be shown that the loads to the vehicle tend to increase when using low aspect ratio tires and particularly when using run-flat tires. These tires provide higher stiffnesses while simultaneously introducing larger nonlinearities in the sidewall behavior [1 – 3]. Depending on manufacturer and the combination of vehicle size and wheel properties, these deformations can be so large that the tire belt and/or sidewall have contact with the rim crown (protected by the tire sidewall). The full vehicle simulation on virtual proving grounds is well established and important for the vehicle product development process. One of the most important subsystems in the virtual load assessment process, using full vehicle simulation is the tire model. The precision of that is essential for the overall accuracy of the virtual method. So the tendencies described above strongly require adaptations and improvements in the field of tire modeling. In 2007, Fraunhofer LBF together with Honda R&D started to examine the influences of low aspect ratio and run flat tires for the accuracy of full vehicle simulation results for durability relevant scenarios [3 – 5]. Those activities were the starting point for a four years joint activity to extend the usability of the virtual load prediction method by full vehicle simulation to application for which strong nonlinearities in the tire (large very transient deformation), but also in the vehicle model itself occur. As a part of that joint development, this paper summarizes the activities of Fraunhofer LBF to develop a dedicated tire model, which can accurately handle very large deformations of the tire up to misuse-like applications. The model is based on the LBF tire model CDTire. In the first chapter several nonlinear extensions of the belt and sidewall model will be described which have been implemented to capture the large deformation behavior. These model extensions are also taking into account the belt-to-sidewall and sidewall-to-rim contact. To validate and to parameterize these model extensions, Fraunhofer LBF built a dedicated flat track test rig, which can be used to realize “roll-over-cleat” experiments using huge obstacles, so that belt-to-sidewall and sidewall-to-rim contact can be forced. This test rig will be described in chapter 2. The third chapter is dealing with the interface of the new tire model to a flexible rim. While the load transfer from road via tire into the vehicle is relatively easy to detect, for example by using wheel force transducers, the local forces acting on the <b>rim</b> <b>flanges</b> {{as well as on the}} wheel well (when e. g. passing a curb) are much more difficult to detect (in measurement as well as in simulation). LBF developed a method to detect local tire-to-rim interface forces and manage flexible rim simulation in Multi-Body-Simulation (LMS Virtual. Lab Motion – [6]). One key issue of the overall method is the capability of the tire model to predict local rim forces on the <b>rim</b> <b>flanges</b> in a suitable way. The second key issue is to combine the tire with a model of a flexible rim (which is embedded in a full vehicle MBS model). This method can be used to perform virtual load prediction of local, transient rim forces, which are the basis for CAE based fatigue life prediction of wheels applying typical durability test track and abuse load events...|$|R

These defects were identified to be laps/folds in the material which appeared to have developed during flange rolling operation. It is believed that these defects had acted as stress raisers for premature fatigue crack initiation resulting in failure of the wheel rim. A detailed analysis is presented in this report...|$|E
40|$|Automobile {{wheel is}} an {{important}} component in vehicles to support the vehicle weight and maintain the contact between the vehicle body and road. Automotive wheels have evolved over the decades using materials from steels to aluminum and magnesium alloys. Aluminum wheels have gain popularity over steel wheels because they have less weight, better cosmetic appearance, and higher thermal conductivity for faster dissipation of heat from brakes. A rim is subject to mainly radial load and inflation pressure. The radial load is exerted on the rim as a vertical reaction force by road surface on four tires to balance the weight of a car. The radial load is applied to the rim at the bead seats with the tire, following a cosine function distribution around the contact area. The tire air pressure is applied directly on the rim at its outer side and indirectly at the <b>rim</b> <b>flange.</b> This project studied the influence of the radial load and the tire inflation pressure on the stress and displacement distribution in the wheel rim.

In sharp curves, the rail grooves are sometimes made very shallow, which causes the outer wheel to temporarily ride up onto the edge of its flange. This increases the wheel diameter and the curve can be taken more easily. In extreme cases, the rail has a groove so that the <b>rim</b> of the <b>flange</b> can take most of the weight, the [...] "out-board" [...] tire (on the outer radius of the outer rail) acting as {{no more than a}} vertical plate.|$|R
5000|$|Lennon {{dubbed the}} {{technique}} [...] "flanging" [...] after producer George Martin jokingly {{told him it}} was produced using a [...] "double-bifurcated sploshing flange". Only years later did Martin learn that another technique, also called flanging, was already in use. The term referred to an engineer's alternately pressing and releasing his finger against the <b>flange</b> (<b>rim)</b> of the supply reel on one of two synchronized tape machines as the same audio signal was combined and transferred to a third machine, slightly slowing the machine then allowing it to come back up to speed and in sync with the other, applying a [...] "swooshing" [...] comb filtering effect to the combined audio signal. Alternatively, the engineer could press the flange of one supply reel then the other to achieve a fuller effect.|$|R
