25|$|In 1991, an {{integrated}} <b>recoil</b> <b>spring</b> assembly replaced the original two-piece <b>recoil</b> <b>spring</b> and tube design. The magazine was slightly modified, changing the floorplate and fitting the follower spring with a resistance insert at its base.|$|E
25|$|Mechanically, {{fourth-generation}} Glock pistols are {{fitted with}} a dual <b>recoil</b> <b>spring</b> assembly to help reduce perceived recoil and increase service life expectancy. Earlier subcompact Glock models such as the Glock 26 and Glock 30 have already used a dual <b>recoil</b> <b>spring</b> assembly which was carried over to the fourth-generation versions of those models. The slide and barrel shelf have been resized, and the front portion of the polymer frame has been widened and internally enlarged, to accommodate the dual <b>recoil</b> <b>spring</b> assembly. The trigger mechanism housing has also been modified {{to fit into the}} smaller-sized grip space.|$|E
25|$|The 90two is a 9mm/.40 {{variant of}} the 92-series with a redesigned, thicker slide and frame with an {{accessory}} rail, captive <b>recoil</b> <b>spring,</b> internal recoil buffer, replaceable sights, user changeable monogrips and 17-round magazines.|$|E
5000|$|Buffering: {{working parts}} finally strike the buffer and halt. <b>Recoil</b> <b>spring(s)</b> are fully {{compressed}} {{and begin to}} drive the working parts forward into battery.|$|R
2500|$|The M3 {{operating}} sequence is as follows: the bolt is cocked {{to the rear}} using the cocking handle located {{on the right side}} of the ejector housing. When the trigger is pulled, the bolt is driven forward by the <b>recoil</b> <b>springs,</b> stripping a round from the feed lips of the magazine and guiding the round into the chamber. The bolt then continues forward and the firing pin strikes the cartridge primer, igniting the round, resulting in a high-pressure impulse, forcing the bolt back against the resistance of the <b>recoil</b> <b>springs</b> and the inertial mass of the bolt. By the time the bolt and empty casing have moved far enough to the rear to open the chamber, the bullet has left the barrel and pressure in the barrel has dropped to a safe level. The M3's comparatively low cyclic rate was a function of the relatively low pressure generated by the [...]45 ACP round, a heavy bolt, and <b>recoil</b> <b>springs</b> with a lighter-than-normal compression rate.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Imperial Russian Canet 75 mm/50 1892 naval gun in Kuivasaari. This gun {{has been}} rotated 180° {{so that the}} <b>recoil</b> <b>springs</b> are {{on top of the}} barrel to {{increase}} elevation.|$|R
25|$|An {{interesting}} {{point of the}} design was {{that it did not}} use a traditional helical coiled <b>recoil</b> <b>spring,</b> but used a spiral spring, much like a large clock spring, in a semicircular housing {{just in front of the}} trigger. The operating rod had a toothed underside, which engaged with a cog which wound the spring. When the gun fired, the bolt recoiled and the cog was turned, tightening the spring until the resistance of the spring had reached the recoil force of the bolt assembly. At that moment, as the gas pressure in the breech fell, the spring unwound, turning the cog, which, in turn, wound the operating rod forward for the next round. As with a clock spring, the Lewis gun <b>recoil</b> <b>spring</b> had an adjustment device to alter the recoil resistance for variations in temperature and wear. Unusual as it seems, the Lewis design proved reliable and was even copied by the Japanese and used extensively by them during the Second World War.|$|E
25|$|Increasingly, it {{has become}} popular to reduce handgun weight and cost as well as {{increase}} corrosion resistance by using polymers. Starting around the year 2000, Beretta began replacing some parts with polymer and polymer coated metal. Polymer parts include the <b>recoil</b> <b>spring</b> guide rod which is now also fluted, magazine floor plate, magazine follower and the mainspring cap/lanyard loop. Polymer coated metal parts include the left side safety lever, trigger, and magazine release button.|$|E
25|$|The Astra 400 {{is heavy}} {{compared}} to many contemporary service pistols {{of the time}} like the Tokarev TT-33 but is similar in weight and length to the Colt 1911. The Astra 400 {{was designed to be}} safe to fire with a simple blowback action unaided by any breech-locking devices. This is only possible with a heavy slide and strong <b>recoil</b> <b>spring.</b> It was fitted with an internal hammer which was considered very hard to cock. The pistol also featured grooved finger grips and left sided combined slide lock/safety behind the trigger guard. The original design was chambered in 9mm Largo, but later variants would be chambered differently so as to better fulfill different military needs.|$|E
50|$|The AR-7 {{functions}} as a simple or plain blowback semi-automatic. The AR-7 is a light firearm with heavy bolt and twin <b>recoil</b> <b>springs</b> and must be firmly held for reliable blowback operation.|$|R
50|$|Gunsmiths {{who lack}} {{sophisticated}} machine shop capabilities {{must understand the}} law. Enlisting an unlicensed (no FFL) machine shop to create gun receivers can be illegal. Other common parts such as grips, barrels, triggers, sights, magazines, <b>recoil</b> <b>springs,</b> and stocks can be manufactured freely, but all receiver development work does require licensing.|$|R
5000|$|The {{machine gun}} has an automatic-only trigger {{mechanism}} and a cross-bolt {{safety in the}} form of a button that is operated by the shooting hand (in its [...] "safe" [...] position the bolt release is disabled). The weapon fires from an open bolt. The cyclic rate can be altered by installing different bolts and <b>recoil</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R
500|$|It fires {{from an open}} bolt and is gas operated. When {{the trigger}} is pulled, the bolt and bolt carrier move forward under {{the power of the}} <b>recoil</b> <b>spring.</b> A {{cartridge}} is stripped from the belt, chambered, and discharged, sending a bullet down the bore. Expanding propellant gases are diverted {{through a hole in the}} barrel into a chamber. This pressure moves a piston providing the energy to extract and eject the spent casing as well as advance the belt and compress the <b>recoil</b> <b>spring,</b> thus preparing for subsequent shots. At [...] long and [...] in weight ( [...] including a 200-round belt and plastic ammo box), the M249 is a cumbersome weapon.|$|E
2500|$|In September 2011, Glock {{announced}} a <b>recoil</b> <b>spring</b> exchange {{program in which}} the manufacturer voluntarily offers to exchange the <b>recoil</b> <b>spring</b> assemblies of its fourth-generation pistols (with {{the exception of the}} [...] "subcompact" [...] Glock 26 and Glock 27 models) sold before 22 July 2011 at no cost [...] "to ensure our products perform up to GLOCK’s stringent standards", according to the company.|$|E
2500|$|In 1992, Ruger {{produced}} a limited-run P89X convertible model, which {{came with a}} second barrel and <b>recoil</b> <b>spring</b> assembly that allowed conversion between 9mm and [...]30 Luger calibers. Ruger only made 5750 with both barrels.|$|E
25|$|Polymer {{holsters}} {{in various}} configurations and matching magazine pouches are available. In addition, Glock produces optional triggers, <b>recoil</b> <b>springs,</b> slide stops, magazine release levers, and maritime spring cups. Maritime spring cups {{are designed to}} allow the pistol to be fired immediately after being submerged in water. They feature additional openings that allow liquids to flow and escape around them, offering enhanced reliability when water has penetrated into the firing pin assembly channel.|$|R
5000|$|All {{iterations}} of the AR-7 {{from the}} Armalite to the Henry U.S. Survival rifle use a bolt and dual <b>recoil</b> <b>springs</b> that are heavy compared to most other [...]22 semiautomatics. The AR-7 requires high velocity ammunition for reliable functioning. The manufacturers recommend use of 40 grain round nose bullets in high velocity loadings. It {{is possible to}} manually load a single round into the firing chamber, allowing use of flat nosed bullets or low velocity or subsonic ammunition.|$|R
50|$|Overall, {{the design}} is simple and {{effective}} with some clever touches; for example the bolt guide rod assembly guides the bolt in the receiver, retains the <b>recoil</b> <b>springs</b> and the rear end of the top handguard, as well as serving as the latch holding {{the upper and lower}} receivers together in the closed position. Disassembly is somewhat similar to the AR-15, with the working parts accessed by the rifle pivoting open on a hinge pin immediately forward of the magazine well.|$|R
2500|$|In late July 2012, the U.S. Marines {{placed a}} $22.5 million order for 12,000 M1911 pistols for MEU(SOC) forces. The new 1911 was {{designated}} M45A1 or [...] "Close Quarters Battle Pistol" [...] CQBP. [...] The M45A1 features a dual <b>recoil</b> <b>spring</b> assembly, Picatinny rails and is cerakoted tan in color.|$|E
2500|$|SIG P210-7: The [...]22 LR rimfire {{version with}} wood or plastic grips, fixed or {{adjustable}} sights, the latter version {{fitted with a}} special cut down hammer. The special slide, barrel, <b>recoil</b> <b>spring,</b> and magazine fitted to this pistol are available as a conversion kit adaptable to all P210 centerfire models.|$|E
2500|$|The {{improved}} M45A1 CQBP features several {{changes to}} the original M1911A1 design. [...] One feature is the dual <b>recoil</b> <b>spring</b> system that spreads out the recoil force of the [...]45 ACP round by lowering the peak force of the recoil pulse. [...] It also has 3-dot tritium night sights, a 5-inch national match barrel, ambidextrous safety, picatinny rail, and a desert tan finish.|$|E
5000|$|In pistols the recoil {{from the}} fired {{cartridge}} (and the slide movement) {{will make the}} muzzle rise after each shot, and how high the bore axis sits {{in relationship to the}} hand will affect the degree of muzzle rise. A low bore axis will make most of the recoil go directly into the hand, and thus give less muzzle rise. Among other things that affect muzzle rise and felt recoil is the weight of the pistol frame and tuning of <b>recoil</b> <b>springs.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Several {{blowback}} systems {{exist within}} this broad principle of operation, each distinguished by {{the methods used}} to control bolt movement. In most actions that use blowback operation, the breech is not locked mechanically {{at the time of}} firing: the inertia of the bolt and <b>recoil</b> <b>spring(s),</b> relative to the weight of the bullet, delays opening of the breech until the bullet has left the barrel. [...] A few locked breech designs use a form of blowback (example: primer actuation) to perform the unlocking function.|$|R
5000|$|The recoil in the three-round burst is {{not felt}} by the weapon's user until after the third round has left the chamber. This is {{accomplished}} by having the barrel and feeding mechanism [...] "float" [...] within the rifle casing. When the rounds are fired, the barrel, magazine, chamber and operating mechanism recoils back against <b>recoil</b> <b>springs</b> several inches. Only when it strikes the buffer {{at the back of}} the rifle does the user feel the recoil. During the rearward travel of the internal mechanism the rifle loads and fires 3 rounds. When the barrel and mechanism reaches the rearmost point in its travel, the <b>recoil</b> <b>springs</b> push it forward back into its normal forward position. When firing in semi-auto and full-auto modes, the rifle loads and fires only one round per movement of the internal mechanism. Fully automatic fire is reduced to around 460 rounds per minute. The internal workings of the rifle were rather complex compared to those of some earlier designs, with the mechanism being compared to the inside of a compact clock. The number of hours of maintenance required for the G11 as compared to other designs is not clear, especially since the effect of the powder used in the caseless ammo remains unknown. Designers claimed that, because there was no ejection cycle, the internal mechanisms would have little chance to get exposed to external dust, dirt and sand, which would supposedly reduce the need for cleaning.|$|R
2500|$|The compact SG 552 Commando (full {{designation}} as the 552-2P) carbine {{was released}} in July 1998. It has a shorter [...] barrel (with an open, 3-prong flash suppressor) and gas tube, ventilated handguards and a redesigned bolt carrier group that was integrated with the piston rod to form a single moving assembly. The SG 552 series rifles have a [...] long sight radius. The return mechanism has been moved {{to the rear of}} the receiver housing and its <b>recoil</b> <b>spring</b> is guided in a way analogous to that of the AK-47: on a steel guide rod (later models feature a polymer guide rod) resting against the lower receiver's rear surface under tension of the compressed <b>recoil</b> <b>spring.</b> Like the SG 550/551, this model can accept rails and accessories enabling the use of optics. A long barrel version of the SG 552 known as the SG 552 LB incorporates a [...] barrel with provision to fire rifle grenades and support a bayonet. The SG 552 models were discontinued in 2008 and replaced by the SG 553. Upgrade part kits are available to convert a SG 552 in to a SG 553.|$|E
2500|$|There are no {{fasteners}} of {{any type}} in the 1911 design, excepting the grip screws. The main components of 1911 are {{held in place by}} the force of the <b>recoil</b> <b>spring.</b> The pistol can be [...] "field stripped" [...] by partially retracting the slide, removing the slide stop, and subsequently removing the barrel bushing. Full disassembly (and subsequent reassembly) of the pistol to its component parts can be accomplished using several manually removed components as tools to complete the disassembly.|$|E
2500|$|The Ruger SR9c {{started to}} ship in January 2010, {{according}} to Ruger. The SR9c is lighter and dimensionally smaller {{compared to the}} SR9, but {{it has the same}} grip width (measured across safety levers) as the full-sized SR9. [...] The manual safety, adjustable rear sights, and updated version of the trigger are all present in the compact version also. In contrast to the SR9 <b>recoil</b> <b>spring</b> assembly the SR9c pistols are fitted with a dual <b>recoil</b> <b>spring</b> assembly. The SR9c is normally supplied with two magazines. The standard 10-round compact magazine features a flat bottom floor plate, with an extended floor plate also included. The second magazine is a full-size 17-round unit featuring a grip adapter that transforms the short compact SR9c grip into a full-sized grip. [...] However, in jurisdictions where the number of rounds in a firearm are limited by law the SR9c is shipped from Ruger with two 10-round magazines and two extended floor plates. [...] Additional retraction grooves (serrations) are located on the front sides of the SR9c slide, making it easier to operate and press-check the slide. The Ruger SR9c was chosen as the Shooting Industry Academy of Excellence's Handgun of the Year in 2010.|$|E
50|$|The Škorpion is a select-fire, {{straight}} blowback-operated {{weapon that}} fires from the closed bolt position. The cartridge used produces {{a very low}} recoil impulse and this enables simple unlocked blowback operation to be employed; there is no delay mechanism and the cartridge is supported only by the inertia of the bolt {{and the strength of}} the return springs. When fired, gas pressure drives the case back in the chamber against the resistance provided by the weight of the bolt and its two <b>recoil</b> <b>springs.</b> The bolt travels back, extracting the empty case which is then ejected straight upwards through a port in the receiver housing top cover.|$|R
5000|$|Mateba Autorevolvers {{chambered}} in [...]357 Magnum can {{be loaded}} with [...]38 Special ammunition. Typical [...]38 Special loads {{do not have}} enough power to fully cycle the recoil mechanism, but the weapon will still function with a double-action trigger pull. There are two optional <b>recoil</b> <b>springs</b> designed specifically for [...]38 Special cartridges that can be installed by the operator to overcome this problem (.38 Special and [...]38 wadcutter). Replacing the spring requires the removal of the slide assembly, which is blocked by a retaining pin held in place by a small set screw in the triggerguard. The barrel shroud acts as the spring keeper and guide rod bushing.|$|R
5000|$|Similar to the {{previous}} opening, Rocky is again flying about the city. Bullwinkle is suspended from a safety harness posting a sign on a large billboard. He loses his balance as the squirrel zooms past him and tumbles off the platform. The moose lands on a banner pole mounted {{on the side of}} a building, and the <b>recoil</b> <b>springs</b> him back into the air. He lands on a store awning, slides down, and drops a few feet to a bench on which Rocky is seated. The impact launches the squirrel off the bench, and Bullwinkle nonchalantly catches him in his left hand to end the sequence.|$|R
2500|$|The 92A1 and 96A1 [...] were {{introduced}} in 2010, based on elements from the 92FS and 90two. The overall shape and styling builds on the 92FS with more parts commonality than the 90-two had. From the 90-two comes a heavier slide construction combined with a slightly altered frame to accommodate the picatinny rail and [...]40 S power levels. While most internal components are compatible with standard 92 models, the slide, frame, captive <b>recoil</b> <b>spring</b> assembly, and takedown lever and button of the 92A1 and 96A1 are not interchangeable with other models other than the 90-two.|$|E
2500|$|At the 2010 SHOT Show, Glock {{presented}} the [...] "fourth generation", now dubbed [...] "Gen4" [...] by Glock itself. [...] Updates centered on ergonomics and the <b>recoil</b> <b>spring</b> assembly. Some parts of fourth-generation Glock pistols cannot be interchanged {{with those of}} the previous generations. The initial two fourth-generation models announced were the full-sized Glock 17 and Glock 22, chambered for the 9×19mm Parabellum and [...]40 S cartridges, respectively. The pistols were displayed with a modified rough-textured frame, grip checkering, and interchangeable backstraps of different sizes. [...] "Gen4" [...] is rollmarked on the slide next to the model number to identify the fourth-generation pistols.|$|E
2500|$|In 2002, {{an article}} in American Handgunner stated that [...] "Marine armorers from the Precision Weapons Section, MCBQ" [...] are making 789 MEU (SOC) 1911's. [...] Corporal Gravenese {{demonstrates}} {{the power of the}} pistol as shown as above. The revised parts list included barrels, bushings, link pins, sear springs, ejectors, firing pin stops, mainspring housings and mainsprings, all from Nowlin Manufacturing. [...] Slides were ordered from Springfield Armory, with front sight pins, beavertail safeties and <b>recoil</b> <b>spring</b> guides from Ed Brown. [...] Novak was contracted for rear sights, Wilson Combat provided extractors and mag release buttons, while King's Gun Works supplied ambidextrous thumb safeties.|$|E
5000|$|Special variant — Colt Elite Ten Forty — the Colt Elite Ten/Forty was {{a special}} edition for Lew Horton Co. in the early 1990s. This edition is a special dual caliber {{offering}} of the Combat Elite semi-automatic pistol. The pistol is furnished in [...]40 S&W and includes a 10mm Auto conversion kit consisting of a barrel slide stop, two <b>recoil</b> <b>springs</b> and guide, and a stainless steel 10mm magazine. In addition, each pistol is specially roll-marked [...] "ELITE TEN/FORTY" [...] {{on the left side}} of the slide and features a flat mainspring housing. This edition consists of approximately 411 units and utilizes a special serial number prefix 1040E.|$|R
50|$|Five days {{of intense}} {{bombardment}} were planned {{leading up to}} the attack, designated U,V, W, X and Y days, but the whole attack was delayed by two days, so there was seven days of bombardment culminating in Z Day on 1 July. The two additional days were used for Interdiction of enemy movement and repairs, to complete the wire-cutting and counter-battery tasks, and to deceive the enemy. The Southart Group found that by Y Day (28 June) the guns were showing signs of strain, with <b>recoil</b> <b>springs</b> having to be frequently replaced, and the extension to Y2 Day (30 June) made the situation worse. The division's batteries and observation posts (OPs) also suffered from German counter-battery fire.|$|R
50|$|Manufactured in Ulm, West Germany, by Carl Walther Sportwaffen GmbH, the P5 was {{a further}} {{development}} of the famous Walther P38 and P1 series. Development began following requests by German police and federal agencies for a new sidearm. Walther engineers {{decided to use the}} P1 model as the basis of the P5 and gave it a similar locking system, reinforced frame, and dual <b>recoil</b> <b>springs.</b> In addition, the Walther improved the extractor, shortened the barrel, and increased the slide length. Safety was enhanced by utilizing an innovative pivoting firing pin that can move forward only when the trigger is pulled. In addition, the P1's slide-mounted decocker/safety was moved to a frame mounted decocker/slide stop multi-lever.|$|R
