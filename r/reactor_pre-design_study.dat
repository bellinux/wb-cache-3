40|$|During {{the last}} two decades <b>pre-design</b> <b>studies</b> have become an {{integral}} part of design phases required for successful creation of built environments. Now, they are taking place as part of contemporary architectural design practices. Pre-design can be regarded as a phase that precedes the detailed architectural programming and space planning stages. It may include tasks and activities that range from defining functional needs and adjacency analyses to establishing design imperatives and prioritizing design recommendations, and from cost analysis and financial modeling to establishing urban design criteria for locating new buildings. This paper reports on a <b>pre-design</b> <b>study</b> conducted over the past three years for the Minnesota Departments of Agriculture (MDA), Health (MDH), and Human Services (DHS), toward developing new office facilities and laboratories. The methodology of the study is based on establishing a rigorous collaborative process that includes five major procedures.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this presentation is to carry out thermal model reduction {{in the context of}} the finite element method. The finite element model is decomposed in several sets of adjacent faces called super-faces. Specialized algorithms such as the METIS partitioning algorithm are used to automatically generate the super-faces. Several constraints may be imposed, e. g., the size of the super-face, its aspect ratio or its aperture angle. Once the model is decomposed, view factors between super-faces are calculated with direct numerical integration or ray-tracing methods. This method offers a very substantial reduction of the computational burden compared to the full model, which is particularly interesting for <b>pre-design</b> <b>studies</b> or specific applications such as deployable structures...|$|R

40|$|Modern societies' {{functionality}} {{is strongly}} {{dependent on the}} electricity. Efficient, environment friendly, and economical power production has been in focus for a long time. The introduction of computers and thereby computer-aided tools for <b>pre-design</b> <b>studies,</b> optimization and choice of the best operational strategies, has changed the conditions for power production tremendously. The most noticeable advantage of the introduction of the computer-aided tools in the field of power generation, has been the ability to study the plant’s performance prior to the construction phase. The results of these studies have made it possible to change and adjust the plant layout to match the pre-defined requirements. Further development of computers in recent years has opened up for implementation of new features in the existing tools and also for the development of new tools for specific applications, like thermodynamic and economic optimization, prediction of the remaining component life time, and fault diagnostics, resulting in improvement of the plant’s performance, availability and reliability. The most common tools for <b>pre-design</b> <b>studies</b> are heat and mass balance programs. Further thermodynamic and economic optimization of plant layouts, generated by the heat and mass balance programs, can be accomplished by using pinch programs, exergy analysis and thermoeconomics. Surveillance and fault diagnostics of existing systems can be performed by using tools like condition monitoring systems and artificial neural networks. The increased number of tools and their various construction and application areas make the choice of the most adequate tool for a certain application difficult. In this thesis the development of different categories of tools and techniques, and their application area are reviewed and presented. Case studies on both existing and theoretical power plant layouts have been performed using different commercially available tools to illuminate their advantages and shortcomings. The development of power plant technology and the requirements for new tools and measurement systems have been briefly reviewed. This thesis contains also programming techniques and calculation methods concerning part-load calculations using local linearization, which has been implemented in an in-house heat and mass balance program developed by the author. Results of calculations performed by the in-house program have been compared with results from commercial programs. The comparison shows good consistency [1, 2]. Methods suggested by the author increase the numerical stability, reduce the calculation time, and improve the user-friendliness by facilitating free choice of input data...|$|R
40|$|The Y- 12 National Security Complex (Y- 12 Complex) is {{an active}} {{manufacturing}} and developmental engineering facility that {{is located on the}} U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) Oak Ridge Reservation. Building 9201 - 2 {{was one of the first}} process buildings constructed at the Y- 12 Complex. Construction involved relocating and straightening of the Upper East Fork Poplar Creek (UEFPC) channel, adding large quantities of fill material to level areas along the creek, and pumping of concrete into sinkholes and solution cavities present within the limestone bedrock. Flow from a large natural spring designated as ''Big Spring'' on the original 1943 Stone & Webster Building 9201 - 2 Field Sketch FS 6003 was captured and directed to UEFPC through a drainpipe designated Outfall 51. The building was used from 1953 to 1955 for pilot plant operations for an industrial process that involved the use of large quantities of elemental mercury. Past operations at the Y- 12 Complex led to the release of mercury to the environment. Significant environmental media at the site were contaminated by accidental releases of mercury from the building process facilities piping and sumps associated with Y- 12 Complex mercury handling facilities. Releases to the soil surrounding the buildings have resulted in significant levels of mercury in these areas of contamination, which is ultimately transported to UEFPC, its streambed, and off-site. Bechtel Jacobs Company LLC (BJC) is the DOE-Oak Ridge Operations prime contractor responsible for conducting environmental restoration activities at the Y- 12 Complex. In order to mitigate the mercury being released to UEFPC, the Big Spring Water Treatment System will be designed and constructed as a Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and Liability Act action. This facility will treat the combined flow from Big Spring feeding Outfall 51 and the inflow now being processed at the East End Mercury Treatment System (EEMTS). Both discharge to UEFPC adjacent to Bldg. 9201 - 2. The EEMTS treats mercury-contaminated groundwater that collects in sumps in the basement of Bldg. 9201 - 2.

This study sought to determine the magnitude of the condition, its risk factors, maternal and fetal outcomes in a tertiary health centre in Jos, Nigeria. Materials and Methods: A prospective cross-sectional study conducted in all women diagnosed with placenta praevia that spanned over a three and half-year periods (January 2006 -June 2009) in Jos University Teaching Hospital, Jos. The patients were followed up until discharged from the hospital. Relevant information was obtained from each patient using a <b>pre-designed</b> <b>study</b> case report form. Statistical analysis was performed using simple percentages. Results: During the study period, there were 10, 895 deliveries and 135 cases of placenta praevia, thus an incidence of 1. 24 % or 1 in 81 deliveries. The average age of the patients was 30. 2 years and majority of them were multi-parous (63. 7 %). The identified risk factors included previous caesarean section, grand-multiparity, previous uterine evacuation of retained products of conception, multiple pregnancy and history of placenta praevia. Maternal complications included post-partum anaemia, postpartum haemorrhage & operative site infection. There were two maternal deaths (1. 48 %) and the perinatal mortality rate was 18. 7 %. Conclusion: The incidence of Placenta praevia was relatively high and associated with high maternal and perinatal complications.

40|$|Whether {{in school}} {{buildings}} or university campuses {{the educational process}} involves many activities that include knowledge acquisition and assimilation, testing students’ motivation and academic performance, and faculty and teachers’ productivity. The {{way in which we}} approach the planning, design, and our overall perception of learning environments makes powerful statements about how we view education; how educational buildings are designed tells us much about how teaching and learning activities occur. Concomitantly, how these activities are accommodated in a responsive educational environment is a critical issue that deserves special attention. While it was said several decades ago that a good teacher can teach anywhere, a growing body of knowledge—derived from knowledge on “evidence-based design” suggests a direct correlation between the physical aspects of the learning environment, teaching processes, and learning outcomes. In its commitment to introduce timely and pressing issues on built environment research, Open House International presents this special edition to debate and reflect on current discourses on sustainable learning environments. As a guest editor of this edition, my personal interest, acquaintance, and experience of learning environments come primarily from working with Henry Sanoff in the early nineties on a research project—funded by the National Endowment for the Arts and conducted at the School of Architecture at North Carolina State University—addressing environments for young children, in which a number of collaborative mechanisms for understanding and anatomizing the learning environment are developed, while exploring the wide of variety of needs and interests that are mandated by different user types (Sanoff, 1994, 1995, 2002). Such an experience was enhanced by my involvement with Adams Group Architects in Charlotte, North Carolina in a research and consultancy capacity during the period between 2001 and 2004 (Salama, 2002, Salama and Adams 2003 a. and b., Salama, 2004, Salama, 2007). Several strategic planning projects, <b>pre-design</b> <b>studies,</b> and participatory programming and design were developed for schools in North Carolina. A worldwide commitment to designing responsive environments conducive to learning is witnessed in many academic settings. This is evident in a recent colloquium conducted by Colloquia of Lausanne, Switzerland, and in the recent efforts by recent practices in both developing and developed countries (Knapp, Noschis, and Pasalar, 2007; DesignShare, 2008; NCEF, 2008). Notably, in many schools of architecture the subject is being debated through research and design where future generations of architects are exploring possibilities of shaping the future of learning environments. An important example among many others is the studio project undertaken at the Post Graduate Level at Queen’s University Belfast and coordinated by Alan M. Jones and Karim Hadjri. In this project and through designing a context-based high school in Belfast, students are developing a deeper insight into the understanding of sustainable design parameters including lighting experience and the distinctive characteristics of the spatial environment and its impact on learning...|$|R
40|$|In {{the opinion}} of the author, the recent {{geotechnical}} investigation program combined with the previously obtained subsurface represent a state-of-the-practice database for <b>pre-design</b> concept route <b>study.</b> There are, however, considerable data gaps in some segments of the alignment. For preliminary design, and to obtain reliable estimates, additional geotechnical investigation and laboratory tests are required. A significant segment of the proposed alignment borders and crosses low-lying peat terrain underlain by weak soils. Consequently, specialized ground improvement techniques and lightweight fill materials will be required in these areas. Existing facilities, including buried utilities, will likely require relocation or other protective measures in these areas to protect them against unavoidable settlements or lateral ground displacements. The author’s review of geotechnical work done to date confirmed, generally, that the analyses and construction assumptions for the roadway embankment are appropriate. Additional conceptual design suggestions are made at relevant sections in the report. Examples are given from previous Ministry projects in similar terrain where hogfuel wa...|$|R
40|$|Simulation {{is claimed}} to be an {{effective}} tool in building design to degrade the systems integration matter into comprehension of designers with either a tool or a process related approach. In this <b>study,</b> <b>pre-design</b> phase is considered with energy performance point of view. Aim of the study is exploring integration possibilities of building performance simulation tools in building design process by analyzing these tools from design support point of view. Number of building performance simulation programmes, selected according to development goals of them, are evaluated according to their early design phase data requirement and supply of design data in return. Future work will be a real time building project design process observation to find out how specific parameters are decided during concept development and also these parameters’ weighting factors by executing a survey among a group of architects. This will help designers in choosing the most appropriate tool according to their conceptual approach. Architectural Engineering +TechnologyArchitecture and The Built Environmen...|$|R
40|$|A {{group of}} {{research}} projects based at HP-Labs Bristol, the University of Bristol and ARKive (a new large multimedia database project {{focused on the}} worlds biodiversity based in the UK) are working to develop a flexible model for the indexing of multimedia collections that allows users to `annotate' content utilising extensible controlled vocabularies. As part of the educationally focused ARKive-ERA project a series of models for user `annotation' have been developed. The need for these types of user support and tools was identified while conducting <b>pre-design</b> user <b>studies</b> with specialist user groups. The needs centre around the limitations of current online museum and library systems that do not provide support for users to annotate or `tag' multimedia objects of relevance to their particular `community of interest' or with specialised indexing terms. This would enable specialised resource discovery and knowledge sharing {{with other members of}} their communities. One example is that of University Lecturers and Researchers studying a particular type of animal behaviour. They may wish to identify all relevant images or video of that particular behaviour and annotate them as good illustrations of aspects of that behaviour. However significant issues arise over for example, the validation of information, access control and the use of such annotations by the resource discovery tools. The paper explores these and other issues and problems involved and how the various models can help provide solutions to the key problems and thus meet the needs of a diverse range of `communities of interest' and adding significant value to on-line multimedia collections...|$|R
