Known methods of DC current cancellation are reviewed, such as capacitor bank or diode/thyristor network insertion in the secondary circuit of the <b>welding</b> <b>transformer.</b> A new method of controlling the magnitude and shape of the TIG welding current is proposed. The idea is to insert a controlled voltage source in the secondary circuit of the <b>welding</b> <b>transformer.</b> This controlled voltage source is realized using a full-bridge voltage source inverter (VSI). VSI control system design issues are discussed. VSI is controlled by a three-level hysteretic current controller, while current reference is generated using lookup table driven by PLL (Phase Locked Loop) locked to the mains frequency. Simulation results are shown. The proposed topology of TIG power supply allows to provide magnitude and shape control of the welding current, with the limitation that its DC component must be zero. Thus, some capabilities of professional AC-TIG welders are obtained using substantially lower cost components: VSI built using high-current low voltage MOSFETs with control system based on 32 -bit ARM microcontroller.

This pioneering technology will dramatically improve the manufacture and usability of medical devices that have previously needed mechanical joints or coupling. This innovative project has enabled the development of <b>rotary</b> friction <b>welding</b> parameters that provide tripartite joints, ideally suited for use in medical instruments such as intramedullary reamers. Traditional methods have used double wound shafts and mechanical joints which have been difficult and expensive to clean and sterilise. However, the use of shape-memory alloy Nitinol for the shaft provides sufficient elasticity to allow the rotating tool to be used in curved bone. It produces crevice free, highly reliable, bi-metallic surgical instruments, instantly removing the need for mechanical joints in this type of medical device. This means cleaning, disinfecting and sterilising is easier, more efficient and more reliable, which in turn reduces the risk of cross infection between patients. Approximately 7000 cases of MRSA infections were reported in UK hospitals during 2007 and similar issues are prevalent across Europe. Such infections are of particular concern in post-surgery patients. <b>Rotary</b> friction <b>welding</b> is a solid phase process, where no melting takes place.

Rotation continues for a specific time, sufficient for achieving the temperature at which metal in the joint zone is in the plastic state. Having achieved this condition, the rotating bar is stopped while the pressure is either maintained or increased to consolidate the joint.
