5|$|Drumming {{is a form}} of non-vocal {{communication}} used by {{most species}} of woodpecker and involves the bill being repeatedly struck on a hard surface with great rapidity. After a pause, the drum roll is repeated, each species having a pattern which is unique in the number of beats in the <b>roll,</b> <b>the</b> length of the <b>roll,</b> <b>the</b> length of the gap between rolls and the cadence. The drumming is mainly a territorial call, equivalent to the song of a passerine, with male birds drumming more frequently than females. Woodpeckers choose a surface that resonates, such as a hollow tree, and may use man-made structures such as gutters and downpipes. Drumming serves for the mutual recognition of conspecifics and plays a part in courtship rituals. Individual birds are thought to be able to distinguish the drumming of their mates and that of their neighbours.|$|E
5|$|During the 2004 season, the LIMs on the Robin side of {{the tower}} failed causing the train to stall in the zero G <b>roll.</b> <b>The</b> cause of the LIMs' failure is still unknown. The Batman side was also closed {{for most of the}} season.|$|E
5|$|Chew Valley School is {{the main}} {{secondary}} school (11–18 years) for the valley. It is situated between Chew Magna and Chew Stoke. The latest (2011) Ofsted Inspection Report describes this specialist Performing Arts College as a mixed comprehensive school with 1,201 pupils on <b>roll.</b> <b>The</b> school is popular and oversubscribed with 226 students in the sixth form. The school {{has been successful in}} gaining a number of national and regional awards. There are state primary schools (4–11 years) in most of the local villages.|$|E
50|$|<b>The</b> four-point <b>roll</b> {{is a quick}} {{series of}} quarter <b>rolls.</b> <b>The</b> pilot gives four separate, but very brief aileron inputs. <b>The</b> first <b>rolls</b> <b>the</b> {{aircraft}} to knife-edge, <b>the</b> second <b>rolls</b> <b>the</b> aircraft inverted, <b>the</b> third <b>rolls</b> <b>the</b> aircraft to opposite knife-edge, and <b>the</b> final input <b>rolls</b> <b>the</b> aircraft back to upright.|$|R

50|$|The {{three-roll}} {{variable pitch}} works by having all three rolls {{able to move}} and tilt. <b>The</b> top <b>roll</b> moves in <b>the</b> vertical plane and <b>the</b> side <b>rolls</b> move on <b>the</b> horizontal plane.When rolling, <b>the</b> top <b>roll</b> presses <b>the</b> metal plate between <b>the</b> two side <b>rolls.</b> <b>The</b> advantage of having <b>the</b> variable three <b>roll</b> is <b>the</b> ability to <b>roll</b> many thicknesses and diameters of cylinders.|$|R
5|$|From the start, {{the film}} moves {{continuously}} between Barton's subjective {{view of the}} world and one which is objective. After the opening credits <b>roll,</b> <b>the</b> camera pans down to Barton, watching the end of his play. Soon we see the audience from his point of view, cheering wildly for him. As he walks forward, he enters the shot and the viewer is returned to an objective point of view. This blurring of the subjective and objective returns in the final scene.|$|E
5|$|In aikido, as in {{virtually}} all Japanese martial arts, there are both physical and mental aspects of training. The physical training in aikido is diverse, covering both general physical fitness and conditioning, as well as specific techniques. Because {{a substantial portion of}} any aikido curriculum consists of throws, beginners learn how to safely fall or <b>roll.</b> <b>The</b> specific techniques for attack include both strikes and grabs; the techniques for defense consist of throws and pins. After basic techniques are learned, students study freestyle defense against multiple opponents, and techniques with weapons.|$|E
5|$|One {{beneficial}} effect of Hurricane Dennis was the rolling {{of the former}} USS Spiegel Grove. Spiegel Grove was sunk in Florida Keys National Marine Sanctuary {{in an attempt to}} create an artificial reef. However, the ship turned over and landed on the bottom upside down. Efforts to <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> ship were partially successful, bringing it onto its starboard side, but Hurricane Dennis completed the roll, bringing Spiegel Grove into its intended upright position.|$|E
30|$|In step 1, <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> {{moved slowly}} down and elastic–plastic {{deformation}} was produced to the saw blade. In step 2, <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> began to rotate and {{the rotation of}} <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> drove <b>the</b> saw blade to rotate. The vertical force acting on <b>the</b> <b>roll</b> calculated by <b>the</b> model was the rolling force.|$|R
50|$|Players {{also have}} the ability to “Split the Seven” any time this total is <b>rolled.</b> <b>The</b> player who <b>rolled</b> <b>the</b> seven may choose to move the full seven squares, or may move {{anywhere}} from one to six squares and then move another player the remaining squares.|$|R
50|$|A {{player who}} starts his {{turn in a}} cave {{declares}} whether they are going back into the cave or exiting. If exiting, <b>the</b> player <b>rolls</b> <b>the</b> die and moves as normal; if going back into the cave, <b>the</b> player <b>rolls</b> <b>the</b> die and moves to a different cave.|$|R
5|$|One male, or {{sometimes}} several, will pursue a female. When {{one of the}} males approaches the female, he uses his upper jaw to grab her dorsum. The male will then <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> female over by grabbing one of her pectoral fins, which are located {{on either side of}} her body. Once he is on her ventral side, the male puts a clasper into the female, connecting them venter to venter, with both undersides together. The mating process lasts for 30–90 seconds.|$|E
5|$|Since the crash, {{there have}} been several other {{accidents}} involving reverse thrust. A Douglas DC-8 operating United Airlines Flight 859 crashed in 1961 when the first officer attempted to reverse all four engines during the landing <b>roll.</b> <b>The</b> left engines remained in forward thrust, while the right engines went into reverse, causing the aircraft to veer rapidly to the right and collide with airport construction vehicles, killing 17 of the 122 people aboard and 1 person on the ground.|$|E
5|$|Six Flags Fiesta Texas {{announced}} in August 2012, {{that they would}} be revamping their wooden coaster, The Rattler, into a steel track coaster, to be called Iron Rattler. The renovation would be performed by Rocky Mountain Construction and would feature the I-Box steel track on some of the original wooden coaster supports, Rattler-themed trains supplied by Gerstlauer, and a barrel <b>roll.</b> <b>The</b> new ride would open for the 2013 season.|$|E
50|$|Often <b>the</b> <b>rolls</b> are {{heated to}} assist in the {{workability}} of the metal. Lubrication is often used to keep the workpiece from sticking to <b>the</b> <b>rolls.</b> To fine-tune <b>the</b> process, the speed of <b>the</b> <b>rolls</b> and <b>the</b> temperature of the rollers are adjusted.|$|R

5|$|The iPad {{allows users}} to {{purchase}} and download songs from the iTunes Store directly to their iPad. It includes software that allows the user to upload, view, and email photos taken with the camera. The user zooms {{in and out of}} photos by sliding two fingers further apart or closer together, much like Safari. The Camera application also lets users view the camera <b>roll,</b> <b>the</b> pictures that have been taken with the iPad's camera. Those pictures are also available in the Photos application, along with any transferred from iPhoto or Aperture on a Mac, or Photoshop on a Windows PC.|$|E
5|$|The {{inventories}} of both 1514 and 1546 also list several hundred heavy darts and lime pots {{that were designed}} to be thrown onto the deck of enemy ships from the fighting tops, although no physical evidence of either of these weapon types has been identified. Of the 50 handguns listed in the Anthony <b>Roll,</b> <b>the</b> complete stocks of five matchlock muskets and fragments of another eleven have been found. They had been manufactured mainly in Italy, with some originating from Germany. Found in storage were several gunshields, a rare type of firearm consisting of a wooden shield with a small gun fixed in the middle.|$|E
5|$|The reed {{is on the}} {{underside}} of the mouthpiece, pressing against the player's lower lip, while the top teeth normally contact the top of the mouthpiece (some players <b>roll</b> <b>the</b> upper lip under the top teeth to form what is called a 'double-lip' embouchure). Adjustments in the strength and shape of the embouchure change the tone and intonation (tuning). It is not uncommon for clarinetists to employ methods to relieve the pressure on the upper teeth and inner lower lip by attaching pads to the top of the mouthpiece or putting (temporary) padding on the front lower teeth, commonly from folded paper.|$|E

5|$|The ships had {{a crew of}} twenty-one {{officers}} and 421 enlisted men. They carried a number of smaller boats, including one picket boat, one barge, two yawls, and two dinghies. They were good sea boats, but were fairly stiff and suffered from severe <b>roll.</b> <b>The</b> cruisers were maneuverable, but were slow going into a turn. Steering was controlled by a single large rudder. They lost speed only slightly in a head sea, but lost up to sixty percent in hard turns.|$|E
5|$|While most of {{the line}} has since been discontinued, the company's Original Chicken Sandwich is still offered in North America, Europe and other markets. The ham and cheese {{sandwich}} was a regional offering, however it was reintroduced nationally in the United States as the Yumbo Sandwich in November 2014. The Yumbo name refers to a smaller snack based sandwich from the 1970s and early 1980s which was a heated ham and cheese sandwich served on a smaller, hamburger <b>roll.</b> <b>The</b> Long Fish was discontinued and the Whaler fish sandwich was reintroduced in 1983, while the Steak Burger sandwich was discontinued altogether.|$|E
5|$|While there, Lennon was {{inspired}} to embark on two recording projects: to make an album of the old rock 'n' roll songs that inspired {{him to become a}} musician, and to produce another artist. In December 1973, Lennon collaborated with Phil Spector to record the oldies album, Rock 'n' <b>Roll.</b> <b>The</b> alcohol-fueled recording sessions became legendary. Every musician in L.A. wanted to participate, but soon Lennon's drinking and Spector's erratic behavior (which included his firing a gun in the studio control room) caused the sessions to break down. Then Spector, who claimed to have been in a car accident, took the sessions tapes and was unreachable.|$|E

5|$|Admission to {{the school}} is through the eleven-plus examination, taken in year 6. Pupils must obtain a minimum score before their {{application}} will be considered and places will be awarded based on whether the child is in public care, whether {{he lives in the}} catchment area and attends a partnered primary school, and whether they have siblings attending the school or parents working there. In the event of a tie, places will be allocated based on proximity {{to the school}}. The school has a maximum annual intake of 116 at the start of year 7 (aged 11); pupils are arranged into forms of no more than 30, where registration takes place. Their form tutors provide access to pastoral support, overseen by their Key Stage Manager. In 2013 the lower school had approximately 577 pupils on <b>roll.</b> <b>The</b> school uniform consists of a black blazer with the school badge embroidered on the breast pocket and a red braid on each pocket. Charcoal or black trousers are worn along with a white shirt and school tie.|$|E
5|$|As designed, {{the ships}} did not handle {{particularly}} well, even in calm seas, and their motion was quite stiff. The ships experienced severe rolling, {{due to the}} weight of the wing turrets. The heavy wing turrets caused the ships to have a large metacentric height, which should have made them very stable gun platforms, but their roll period proved to coincide with that of the average North Sea swell. Bilge keels were later added, which helped to improve the rolling problem. Despite the tendency to <b>roll,</b> <b>the</b> Nassau-class ships were maneuverable and had a small turning radius. They suffered minor speed loss in heavy seas, but up to 70percent at hard rudder. The roll keels that had been fitted to improve handling caused a portion of the speed loss at hard rudder.|$|E
5|$|Burger King's first broiled chicken {{sandwich}} {{was introduced}} in 1990 and was called the BK Broiler. This sandwich was made with lettuce, tomato and a dill ranch sauce served on an oat dusted <b>roll.</b> <b>The</b> product {{came at a time}} of fundamental change in terms of chicken product in the restaurant industry; more than 90% of chicken products sold by the major chains were fried. Shortly after its introduction, the sandwich was selling more than a million units per day, and poaching sales from traditional fried chicken chains such as Kentucky Fried Chicken. Additionally, the sandwiches were part of an industry trend towards the diversification of menus with healthier products such as reformulated cooking methods and salads. At the time, the sandwich had 379 calories and 18grams of fat, 10 of which came from the sauce.|$|E
