40|$|The annual {{discharges}} {{of municipal}} wastewater across the Green Line (the Israeli-Palestinian “borders”) are increasing; thus a bi-national conflict exists with political, environmental, and economical dimensions. This {{is a challenge}} calling for an urgent need for effective <b>transboundary</b> <b>cooperation</b> aiming at public health and environmental protection. Based on the review of selective international and national literature, data analysis of accessible local reports and technical site visits, we demonstrate how complex transboundary wastewater management is throughout the world and on the Green Line or Israeli-Palestinian “borders” specifically. The Israeli water policy reflected by the current unilateral interventions have proved ineffective in addressing <b>regional</b> management of <b>transboundary</b> wastewater problems.

This paper underlines effectiveness, equality, trust, transparency, benefits sharing and responsibilities as key elements of sustainable transboundary wastewater treatment management. A <b>transboundary</b> <b>cooperation</b> along the Green Line (which currently is being seen as the Israeli-Palestinian borders) to promote affordable sanitation and reuse facilities is achievable if a number of legal, political, socio-economical and environmental questions are fairly resolved.

Studies of the {{political}} economy of this land management are underdeveloped, and our understanding of transboundary coordination between different units is virtually nonexistent. Transboundary issues are especially important for managing mobile resources (wildlife) or resources with externalities (timber and watersheds). This paper provides a first cut at understanding these issues with a model of agency decisions against a background of population biology. The paper defines agency objective functions in wildlife management in terms of mandates (or decision rules), including non-intervention, population recovery, and sustainable harvest.

Against this background, enhanced climate variability and climate change are expected to increase the frequency and intensity of floods. The situation is further complicated by the Transboundary nature of water, making <b>Transboundary</b> <b>cooperation</b> on integrated flood risk management not only necessary, but highly beneficial as well. Unfortunately, numerous challenges hamper effective <b>Transboundary</b> <b>cooperation</b> in general and <b>cooperation</b> on <b>Transboundary</b> flood management in particular, thereby increasing vulnerability to floods. Flood Risk Management Strategies (FRMSs) are designed to make vulnerable urban regions more resilient to flooding. This likely requires changes in their institutional embedding. Insights into this institutional embedding of FRMSs so far is, however, rather limited and fragmented. In this paper we argue that such insights can be created by drawing upon and combining public administration and legal expertise. To make a start with the latter, we introduce the Transboundary Flood Risks Governance Arrangements (TFRGAs) approach. In the EU-funded STARFLOOD-project we will use this approach to carry out comparative research to further elaborate the approach...|$|R

The European Union has adopted a Directive (97 / 11 /CE Directive) under which taking transboundary impacts into consideration during EIA processes has become mandatory for member states. As a consequence, Portugal and Spain have approved related provisions. This paper aims to critically analyse the legal and procedural features of bilateral cooperation through the comparison of two case studies related to water management projects (the Sela and Alqueva dams). The paper highlights procedural weaknesses and puts forward a “Good Practice Model” for <b>cooperation</b> under <b>transboundary</b> EIA processes.

40|$|Whilst {{there has}} been a surge of {{interest}} in various disciplines in European territorial cooperation between sub-central levels of government at different scales (cross-border, transnational, inter-regional), researchers and practitioners have struggled to develop appropriate methodologies to analyse the outcomes and impacts of territorial <b>cooperation</b> programmes/projects. That <b>transboundary</b> <b>cooperation</b> leads to the dissemination of good practice, to policy change and to concrete territorial impacts has become accepted wisdom within European programmes, in spite of the often scarce evidence about such outcomes. This paper will build upon the notion of ‘social’ or ‘policy’ learning in order to propose a conceptual and methodological framework to investigate whether, and how, policy learning processes take place between sub-central governmental actors in the framework of European territorial cooperation networks and programmes, on the basis of sociological approaches to 'cognitive Europeanisation' and to organisational learning. The paper will then present the very preliminary results of two research projects on cross-border and transnational territorial cooperation in Southern Europe currently being carried out at the University Institute of European Studies, Barcelona, by proposing a brief reflection on the factors (in particular related to the notion of ‘institutional capacity’) which facilitate or impede processes of social and policy learning in <b>transboundary</b> <b>cooperation</b> projects – taking as an example the involvement of Catalan institutional actors in such projects. ...|$|R

Protected areas can exist on international boundaries, considering {{the existence of}} transfrontier ecosystems, {{the need to protect}} biodiversity, water and forest. In fact, IUCN World Commission on Protected Areas (WCPA) has proposed the following terminology to protected areas sharing “common international boundaries”: Transboundary Protected Areas (TBPAs); Parks for Peace; Transboundary Conservation and Development Areas and Transboundary Migratory Corridors. In addition, other names have been used to describe these areas as transfrontiers natural reserves, border parks or parks on international borders. Some of these terms indicate a level of <b>transboundary</b> <b>cooperation</b> {{which may or may not}} exist. Thus, sometimes, the establishment of protected areas at the border can engender conflicts between conservation strategies, people that live in these areas or security issues.

40|$|The {{personal}} and institutional complications of planning across a larger geographic entity are often poorly understood, and the existing geographical literature reveals {{a lack of}} coherent and operative conceptual frameworks for discussing <b>transboundary</b> <b>cooperation</b> as a social and spatial practice of identity construction. This paper briefly describes existing literature on <b>transboundary</b> <b>cooperation,</b> in particular institutional approaches, in order to indicate its inherent limitations. Instead, it suggests that taking the rationales and positionalities of individuals attempting {{to set up and}} run projects within transboundary protected areas might be more fruitful. In order to do this, the paper engages with how individuals themselves define cooperation, and their own positions and roles within the complex process of institutional change, beyond easy clichés of handshakes and friendships. It focuses on the negotiated role of individuals and coordination structures as examples of the construction of individual and collective identities. Many examples of projects could have been used to discuss this. Here, extensive fieldwork carried out in five European transboundary protected areas is evoked to ground the discussion. Les dimensions personnelles et institutionnelles de l’aménagement au sein d’un espace géographique sont souvent mal comprises. Cette contribution évoque la littérature sur la coopération transfrontalière, en particulier sur les approches institutionnelles, pour en pointer les limites. Face à ce manque de littérature géographique cohérente et opérationnelle apte à éclairer les situations complexes de coopération transfrontalière, nous proposons de prendre au sérieux les points de vue et les positions que les individus mettent en avant lorsqu’ils animent des projets concrets. L’analyse permet de comprendre le processus en tant que construction identitaire individuelle et collective, en partant des définitions et pratiques personnelles de la coopération, au sein d’un processus de changement institutionnel.
