25|$|The {{leakage current}} {{includes}} all weak imperfections of the dielectric caused by unwanted chemical processes and mechanical damage {{and is the}} DC current that can pass through the dielectric after applying a voltage in correct polarity. It depends on the capacitance value, on applied voltage and temperature of the capacitor, on measuring time, {{on the kind of}} electrolyte, and on preconditions like previous storage time without voltage applied or thermic stress from soldering. (All non-solid electrolytic capacitors needs a recovery time of some hours after soldering before measuring the leakage current. Non-solid chip capacitors need a recovery time after <b>reflow</b> <b>soldering</b> of about 24 hours.) Leakage current is reduced by applying operational voltage by self-healing processes.|$|E

40|$|Detailed {{studies to}} {{characterize}} the microstructural development and mechanical properties of eutectic Sn-Ag solder joints were carried out on samples <b>reflow</b> <b>soldered</b> on copper under various processing conditions. Some samples were <b>reflow</b> <b>soldered</b> at 30 ∘C above the melting point and then solidified at different cooling rates. Analysis of these samples showed that increasing the cooling rate increased the volume fraction of primary Sn-dendrites, decreased the amount of η(Cu 6 Sn 5) intermetallics in the bulk solder, and resulted in finer microstructures with higher hardnesses. Subsequent isothermal annealing {{of some of these}} <b>reflow</b> <b>soldered</b> joints at 125 ∘C resulted in an initially fairly rapid decrease in hardness to a given level for each cooling rate studied. However, the cooling rate had little or no effect on the shear strength of the solder joints. Studies of the effect of Cu substrate dissolution on the microstructure of solder joints were carried out using samples <b>reflow</b> <b>soldered</b> isothermally at various temperatures and times. Analysis of some of these samples showed that the Cu concentration, the volume fraction of primary Sn-dendrites and η(Cu 6 Sn 5) intermetallics in the <b>solder</b> increased with <b>reflow</b> temperature and time as a result of Cu dissolution. The isothermal growth kinetics were analyzed using the Nernst-Brunner equation and a numerical method based on it was proposed to predict the amount of Cu dissolution into molten <b>solder</b> for non-isothermal <b>reflow</b> conditions. Isothermal growth of the intermetallic layer between the solder and Cu substrate was investigated, and it was found that layer thickening with time could be described by a power law. A numerical method to predict the layer thickness for non-isothermal reflow was developed which utilized the experimental power law thickening and Nernst-Brunner dissolution kinetic parameters. The method also took into account the additional increase in layer thickness caused by precipitation of dissolved Cu during the cooling part of the reflow process. The intermetallic layer growth resulting from non-isothermal solid state aging was also examined for samples <b>reflow</b> <b>soldered</b> at three different cooling rates and then cycled from ambient to 125 ∘C.

To facilitate automated insertion, radial plastic film capacitors are commonly constructed with terminal spacings at standardized distances, starting with 2.5mm pitch and increasing in 2.5mm steps. Radial capacitors are available potted in plastic cases, or dipped in an epoxy resin to protect the capacitor body against environmental influences.

40|$|As {{the world}} moves towards {{eliminating}} lead from consumer products, the microelectronics industry has {{put effort into}} developing lead-free solder paste. The major drawback of lead-free solder is the problems caused by its high reflow temperature.

Issues addressed in this study include using VFM to reduce the <b>solder</b> <b>reflow</b> temperature, comparing the heating rate of different size solder particles, and comparing the reliability of VFM <b>reflowed</b> <b>solder</b> versus conventionally <b>reflowed</b> <b>solder.</b> Results comparing the effect of particle size on the heating rate of solder showed that the differences were negligible.

40|$|Abstract—The {{trend to}} reduce the size of {{electronic}} packages and develop increasingly sophisticated electronic devices with more, higher density inputs/outputs (I/Os), leads to the use of area array packages using chip scale packaging (CSP), flip chip (FC), and wafer level packaging (WLP) technologies. Greater attention has been paid to the reliability of solder joints and the assembly yield of the surface mounting process as use of advanced electronic packaging technologies has increased. The solder joint reliability has been observed to be highly dependent on solder joint geometry as well as solder material properties, such that predicting <b>solder</b> <b>reflow</b> shape became a critical issue for the electronic research community. In general, the truncated sphere method, the analytical solution and the energy-based algorithm are the three major methods for <b>solder</b> <b>reflow</b> geometry prediction. This research develops solder joint reliability design guidelines to accurately predict both the solder bump geometry and the standoff height for <b>reflow</b> <b>soldered</b> joints in area array packages. Three simulation methods such as truncated-sphere theory, force-balanced analytical solution and energy-based approach for prediction of the solder bump geometry are each examined in detail, and the thermal enhanced BGA (TBGA) and flip chip packages are selected as the benchmark models to compare the simulation and experimental results.

We are addressing issues of automating the fiber pigtailing process on silicon waferboards or microbenches. This paper focuses on <b>reflowing</b> <b>solders</b> for the attachment of o/e components. We have recently developed miniature polysilicon heaters which are integrated on silicon microbenches. These miniature heaters avoid the problem of raising the entire microbench to the solder melting point to attach components. Most importantly, these miniature heaters are completely compatible with automating the attachment process. Designing silicon microbenches with on-board heaters requires some care. The thermal properties of the microbench itself along with all coatings and any heatsinking materials must be understood.

40|$|Temperature cycling of {{electronic}} components {{was carried out}} at two different temperature profiles, the first ranging between - 55 °C and 100 °C (TC 1) and the second between 0 °C and 100 °C (TC 2). Totally, 7000 cycles were run at TC 1 and 14500 cycles at TC 2. The test board’s top-side components were surface mounted using Sn- 3. 8 Ag- 0. 7 Cu solder alloy, and bottom side SMD components were wave soldered with Sn- 3. 5 Ag alloy. The solder joint degradation was investigated {{as a function of}} cycle number by means of shear strength measurements and cross-sectioning. The shear strength drop was correlated to both crack initiation time and propagation rate, and Microstructural changes. The effect of manufacturing process (<b>reflow</b> versus wave <b>soldering)</b> and component size (0805 versus 0603 components) on the shear strength were also investigated. For both <b>reflow</b> and wave <b>soldered</b> components, the harsher the test environment the faster and largest the decrease in shear strength. The shear force is higher for the 0805 components compared to the 0603. The effect of component size on the residual shear strength is higher for the testing condition TC 1. TC 1 also seems to have a higher effect on the residual shear strength compared to TC 2. The main difference between wave <b>soldered</b> and <b>reflow</b> <b>soldered</b> components is that the shear strength is in average higher for the wave soldered components compared to the <b>reflow</b> <b>soldered.</b> For the <b>reflow</b> <b>soldered</b> components using SAC, the microstructure coarsens, especially the Ag 3 Sn intermetallic particles. Furthermore, this alloy shows an increase of the IMC layer (Cu-Ni-Sn) thickness, and the IMC layer growth is controlled by a diffusion mechanism. The IMC growth coefficient is for the SAC system tested at TC 1 0. 0231 μm/hr 1 / 2 (0. 00053 μm/hr) and for TC 2 0. 0054 μm/hr 1 / 2 (2. 9 * 10 - 5 μm/hr). The microstructural changes during thermal cycling are a result of both static and strain-enhanced aging. For the wave soldered components the microstructure also became coarser, however, the IMC layer (Ni 3 Sn 4) thickness did not change. The IMC layer growth does not affect the shear strength for the test conditions applied in this work. The shear strength decrease observed in the present work as a result of thermal cycling is a result of both microstructural coarsening and crack propagation inside the solder joint...|$|R
