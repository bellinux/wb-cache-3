40|$|In {{a recent}} paper of Alahmadi, Alkan and Lopez-Permouth, a ring R is defined {{to have no}} (simple) middle class if the {{injectivity}} domain of any (simple) R-module is the smallest or largest possible. Er, Lopez-Permouth and Sokmez use this idea of restricting the class of injectivity domains to classify rings, and give a partial characterization of <b>rings</b> <b>with</b> no middle class. In this work, we continue {{the study of the}} property of having no (simple) middle class. We give a structural description of right Artinian right nonsingular <b>rings</b> <b>with</b> no right middle class. We also give a characterization of right Artinian rings that are not SI to have no middle class, which gives rise to a full characterization of <b>rings</b> <b>with</b> no middle class. Furthermore, we show that commutative <b>rings</b> <b>with</b> no middle class are those Artinian rings which decompose into a sum of a semisimple ring and a ring of composition length two.

5|$|The outer Adams <b>ring,</b> <b>with</b> an orbital {{radius of}} about 63,930km, {{is the best}} studied of Neptune's rings. It is named after John Couch Adams, who {{predicted}} the position of Neptune independently of Le Verrier. This ring is narrow, slightly eccentric and inclined, with total width of about 35km (15–50km), and its normal optical depth is around 0.011±0.003 outside the arcs, which corresponds to the equivalent depth of about 0.4km. The fraction of dust in this ring is from 20% to 40%—lower than in other narrow rings. Neptune's small moon Galatea, which orbits just inside of the Adams ring at 61,953km, acts like a shepherd, keeping ring particles inside a narrow range of orbital radii through a 42:43 outer Lindblad resonance. Galatea's gravitational influence creates 42 radial wiggles in the Adams <b>ring</b> <b>with</b> an amplitude of about 30km, which {{have been used to}} infer Galatea's mass.|$|E

40|$|Recently {{there has}} been a flurry of {{research}} on generalized factorization techniques in both integral domains and <b>rings</b> <b>with</b> zero-divisors, namely τ-factorization. There are several ways that authors have studied factorization in <b>rings</b> <b>with</b> zero-divisors. This paper focuses on the method of regular factorizations introduced by D. D. Anderson and S. Valdes-Leon. We investigate how one can extend the notion of τ-factorization to commutative <b>rings</b> <b>with</b> zero-divisors by using the regular factorization approach. The study of regular factorization is particularly effective because the distinct notions of associate and irreducible coincide for regular elements. We also note that the popular U-factorization developed by C. R. Fletcher also coincides since every regular divisor is essential. This will greatly simplify many of the cumbersome finite factorization definitions that exist in the literature when studying factorization in <b>rings</b> <b>with</b> zero-divisors.

A ray touched on the tail will propel itself upward into a loop; if it has not escaped after the maneuver, the ray will curl into a <b>ring</b> <b>with</b> the belly facing outward, so as to present the area of its body with the highest electric field gradient (the underside of the electric organs) towards the threat; these behaviors are accompanied by short, strong electric shocks.
