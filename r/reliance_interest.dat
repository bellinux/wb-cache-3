The Article explores the moral and jurisprudential underpinnings of the reliance approach and considers its far-reaching theoretical and practical implications.

When we review regulation, {{a reduction in the}} value of property is not necessarily equated with a taking. Compare Goldblatt v. Hempstead, supra, at 594, and Hadacheck v.

At any rate, loss of future profits - unaccompanied by any physical property restriction - provides a slender reed upon which to rest a takings claim. Prediction of profitability is essentially a matter of reasoned speculation that courts are not especially competent to perform. Further, perhaps because of its very uncertainty, the interest in anticipated gains has traditionally been viewed as less compelling than other property-related interests.

40|$|This Article {{examines}} the underappreciated role of consent and refusal in copyright law’s fair use inquiry. As {{a matter of}} black letter law, the nature and circumstances of a copyright holder’s refusal to consent to a use are irrelevant to whether a particular use is fair. This “standard view” effectively treats all situations short of affirmative consent—such as silence or acquiescence from a copyright holder—as equivalent to an express refusal. Despite the standard view, a close analysis of the case law reveals that some courts implicitly consider consent-based factors in fair use decisions. Other courts, however, adhere strictly to the standard view and disregard consent across the board. Is there a principled basis to consider the nature of consent and refusal in the fair use analysis? This Article argues that consent, properly conceived, has {{an important role to}} play in certain categories of fair use cases. In particular, consent-based considerations should not be disregarded when they are relevant to the traditional fair use factors and fair use’s underlying goal of promoting socially-valuable uses. To make this argument, the Article creates and analyzes a model of the consent-seeking interactions between copyright holders and users. It concludes that a literal application of the standard view neglects important user <b>reliance</b> <b>interests</b> and fails to deter costly opportunistic behavior. The nature of the copyright holder’s consent or refusal, therefore, has a critical role to play in situations involving user <b>reliance</b> <b>interests,</b> such as cases of “partial consent,” bad faith strategic behavior, and digital opt-out systems. In these cases, consideration of consent and refusal accords with the traditional fair use factors and the doctrine’s history as an “equitable rule of reason,” and operates to creates a broader scope for fair use...|$|R
40|$|Among {{the most}} {{prevalent}} justifications for deference to judicial precedent is the protection of <b>reliance</b> <b>interests.</b> The theory is that when judicial pronouncements have engendered significant reliance, {{there should be a}} meaningful presumption against adjudicative change. Yet there remains a fundamental question as to why reliance on precedent warrants judicial protection in the first place. This Article explores the dynamics and implications of precedential reliance. It contends that the case for protecting reliance on precedent is uncertain. There are several reasons why reliance might potentially be worth protecting, but all are subject to serious limitations or challenges. To bolster the doctrine of stare decisis while the status of precedential reliance continues to be worked out, the Article suggests a conceptual move away from backwardlooking reliance and toward the forward-looking interest in managing the disruptive impacts of adjudicative change for society at large...|$|R
40|$|Rather {{than relying}} {{solely on the}} formal interpretations of {{government}} regulators invited by the structure of local zoning ordinances, the City of Seattle should adopt a process that invites community-based mediation and problem-solving when a significant shift in housing density is contemplated in a developer’s proposal. Greater resident participation in development projects allows the City of Seattle to better support those residents in their <b>reliance</b> <b>interests</b> arising from zoning ordinances while simultaneously furthering the policies that underpin urban zoning. This is especially true when such development projects raise the possibility of substantial impacts {{on the character of}} a community or its commons. Moreover, such alternative dispute resolution processes may also help to mitigate potential detriments to the community commons or provide a mechanism for an equitable exchange of capital between developers and residents to offset negative impacts to property values. This Note specifically examines the development of urban residential property into micro-housing apartment buildings in the City of Seattle, the possible consequences, and a potential community-based solution for disputes regarding such development. Part I introduces the issue using anecdotal and quantitative information, including snapshots of some of the conflicts between urban homeowners and developers and the sometimes questionable application of local zoning ordinances to favor development in the context of micro-housing in Seattle. Included in this discussion is a summary of the “smart growth” principles that supported the development and the countervailing interests of incumbent residents. Part II examines Washington State’s Growth Management Act and suggests how it may have impacted the quick acceptance of micro-housing development in Seattle. Part III explores incumbent residents’ <b>reliance</b> <b>interests</b> in zoning ordinances for protection against externalities and maintenance of consumer surplus in their homes. Part IV reviews the potential harms suffered by residents adjacent to dramatic residential development and the legal remedies available at law.

50|$|The usual rule is {{overridden}} by s.2(1) of the Misrepresentation Act 1967 for {{a remedy}} under the tort of deceit, making the damages tortious. If the losses are calculated under the Misrepresentation Act 1967, damages for misrepresentation are calculated {{as if the}} defendant had been fraudulent, {{even if he has}} been only negligent. This is known as the fiction of fraud and also extends to tortious liability. Tortious liability has a wider scope than usual contractual liability, as it allows the claimant to claim for loss even if it is not reasonably foreseeable, which is not possible with a claim for breach of contract due to the decision in Hadley v Baxendale. Inclusion of the representation into the contract as a term will leave the remedy for breach in damages as a common law right. The difference is that damages for misrepresentation usually reflect the claimant's <b>reliance</b> <b>interest,</b> whereas damages for breach of contract protect C's expectation interest, although the rules on mitigation will apply in the latter case.

40|$|In the mid- 1970 s, it was {{an article}} offaith that {{contract}} was not properly conceived as {{a means by which}} persons could, by their own choice, make law for themselves to govern their relations. Instead, contract was thought best conceived as the rectification of injuries persons may have caused by their verbal conduct {{in much the same way}} that persons have a duty to rectify the injuries caused by their physical acts. With contracts, these injuries consisted of detrimental reliance on the words of another. So conceived, both contract and tort duties are imposed by law, and do not arise from the parties 2 ̆ 7 consent. Thus contract law is conceptually indistinguishable from tort law. The doctrinal implications of this reliance-based conception of contract were twofold. First, since duties were imposed by law rather than being the product of the parties 2 ̆ 7 consent, we need not concern ourselves with many of the niceties of finding mutual assent in the formation stage. Second, if reliance was the basis of contract, then the normal expectation measure of recovery was also suspect [...] justified, if at all, as an indirect way to protect what Fuller and Perdue labeled the 2 ̆ 2 <b>reliance</b> <b>interest.</b> 2 ̆ 2 Indeed, it says much about the conventional wisdom during the 1960 s and 1970 s that Fuller and Perdue 2 ̆ 7 s justly esteemed 1936 article, 2 ̆ 2 The <b>Reliance</b> <b>Interest</b> in Contract Damages, 2 ̆ 2 received far greater attention than Fuller 2 ̆ 7 s later 2 ̆ 2 Consideration and Form. 2 ̆...|$|E

A strong connection between contract and promise is nonetheless defended. The basic role of contract law is to support the practice of the making and keeping of promises and agreements, and encourage its use. This makes performance or something just as good the natural remedy.

40|$|Restatement Second of Contracts {{provided}} that contract law serves to protect {{one or more}} of three interests: the expectation interest, the <b>reliance</b> <b>interest,</b> and the restitution interest. There is, however a fourth interest that contract law should and does protect: the disgorgement interest, which is the promisee 2 ̆ 7 s interest in requiring the promisor to disgorge a gain that was made possible by the promisor 2 ̆ 7 s breach, but did not consist of a benefit conferred on the promisor by the promisee. It is not clear why Restatement Second excluded the disgorgement interest. Perhaps the drafters believed that this position was compelled by positive law. That proposition, however, would have been doubtful even when Restatement Second was published, and it is clearly wrong today: some appellate cases, and a handful of trial court cases, have denied protection to the disgorgement interest, but a dozen or so American appellate cases, as well as cases decided by the highest courts of several other common law jurisdictions, have afforded such protection. Alternatively, the drafters of Restatement Second may have believed that the disgorgement interest should not be protected as a normative matter That proposition also cannot be supported. On the contrary, there are strong efficiency reasons, as well as moral reasons, for protecting the disgorgement interest, because in certain categories of cases, protection of that interest in contract law is necessary to provide efficient incentives to the promisor, to effectuate contracts, or to prevent unjust enrichment. Of course, the disgorgement interest should not be protected in all cases in which a promise is legally enforceable, any more than the <b>reliance</b> <b>interest,</b> the restitution interest, or for that matter the expectation interest are protected in all cases.

40|$|This writing {{deals with}} some issues {{concerning}} non pecuniary damages recently arisen in the Italian debate. The first question the Author addresses {{is that of}} their nature.

40|$|In recent years, {{courts and}} {{commentators}} {{have focused on}} the federalism-based limits on the power of the federal government, with significantly less attention given to similar constraints on state power. It is not surprising, therefore, that both camps have overlooked that the Ninth and Tenth Amendments, with their reservation of both rights and power “to the people” contain a popular sovereignty principle that affects the constitutionality of various state election law regulations. This goal of this Article is to reaffirm that the people are, in essence, part of the federalism equation, and not simply as protectors of state power, but as sovereign entities in their own right. This Article contends that the power that the people had to “alter or abolish” their state governments following the Revolutionary War is the foundation of the right to vote in state elections. The Founding generation considered the alter or abolish power to be a natural right and an expression of popular sovereignty that followed the people into the Union upon the ratification of the Constitution. Once this power was circumscribed during the Civil War era, the people used the right to vote as the vehicle to express this sovereign authority. Thus, voting, as the heir to the alter or abolish power, is part of the bundle of participatory rights preserved by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments’ reservation of “rights” and “power,” respectively, to the people. Given its genesis, these amendments provide a better conceptual foundation for the right to vote in state elections than the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. Respect for its popular sovereignty foundations demand that the U. S. Supreme Court, in assessing burdens on the right to vote, acknowledge the <b>reliance</b> <b>interest</b> that the people retain in actively participating in the democratic process at the state level, an interest preserved by the Ninth and Tenth Amendments. Both amendments illustrate the hybrid nature of suffrage as one part sovereign power and one part fundamental right, which should influence the judicial means-ends assessment of restrictions on the right to vote in state elections...|$|E

40|$|The rule of {{stare decisis}} creates a {{presumption}} that a court’s ruling on a legal question remains binding in later decisions {{by the same}} court or hierarchically inferior courts. This presumption promotes stability in the law and protects <b>reliance</b> <b>interests.</b> Decisions that narrowly construe or overrule prior opinions can therefore seem like unprincipled threats {{to the rule of}} law. This article seeks to highlight some countervailing themes in the case law, showing that stability and the protection of <b>reliance</b> <b>interests</b> are not the exclusive concerns underlying the law of precedent. The relevant doctrine attempts to balance these objectives with competing goals, such as restraining judicial overreaching and ensuring that precedent-setting courts observe time-honored decision making practices. As developed by the Supreme Court, the law of precedent allows later judges to narrowly construe or accord diminished weight to a prior opinion if it resolves issues not before the precedent-setting court, addresses legal questions without adequate briefing or argument, or fails to justify the court’s legal conclusions. Since judicial authority consists of the power to 2 ̆ 2 say what the law is 2 ̆ 2 (Marbury v. Madison), these cross-currents in the law of precedent serve separation of powers functions. The ability of a court to establish precedent acts as a check on the power of judges who come later in time. On the other hand, the ability of later judges to ignore dicta and to limit the precedential effect of opinions decided without adequate care provides a counterbalancing check on the power of the earlier court. The law of precedent thus distributes the law speaking power over time, reserving the greatest precedential impact for opinions that address only the issues before the court, based on plenary briefing and argument, and with adequate explanation of the rationale. After tracing these themes in the law of precedent, the article considers their application to three issues likely to come before the Supreme Court in future cases. Specifically, the analysis addresses how these limitations on the rule of stare decisis might affect the precedential value of Baker v. Nelson, dealing with the constitutional status of same-sex marriage; Iqbal v. Ashcroft, discussing the liability of supervisory personnel based on constitutional violations committed by their subordinates; and the viability rule of Roe v. Wade and Planned Parenthood v.

40|$|For decades, {{there has}} been {{substantial}} uncertainty regarding when the law will impose precontractual liability. The confusion {{is partly due to}} scholars 2 ̆ 7 failure to recover the law in action governing precontractual liability issues. In this Article, Professors Schwartz and Scott show first that no liability attaches for representations made during preliminary negotiations. Courts have divided, however, over the question of liability when parties make reliance investments following a 2 ̆ 2 preliminary agreement. 2 ̆ 2 A number of modern courts impose a duty to bargain in good faith on the party wishing to exit such an agreement. Substantial uncertainty remains, however, regarding when this duty attaches and what the duty entails. Professors Schwartz and Scott develop a model showing that parties create preliminary agreements rather than complete contracts when their project can take a number of forms and the parties are unsure which form will maximize profits. A preliminary agreement allocates investment tasks between the parties, specifies investment timing, and commits the parties only to pursue a profitable project. Parties sink costs in the project because investment accelerates the realization of returns and illuminates whether any of the possible project types would be profitable to pursue. A party to a preliminary agreement 2 ̆ 2 breaches 2 ̆ 2 when it delays its investment beyond the time the agreement specifies. Delay will save costs for this party if no project turns out to be profitable and will improve this party 2 ̆ 7 s bargaining power in any negotiation to a complete contract. Delay often disadvantages the promisee, and when parties anticipate such strategic behavior, {{they are less likely to}} make preliminary agreements. This disincentive is unfortunate because a preliminary agreement often is a necessary condition to the realization of a socially efficient opportunity. Thus, contract law should encourage relation-specific investments in preliminary agreements by awarding the promisee his verifiable reliance if the promisor has strategically delayed investment. Professors Schwartz and Scott study a large sample of appellate cases showing that: (1) parties appear to make the preliminary agreements described in the model and breach for the reasons the model identifies, and (2) courts sometimes protect the promisee 2 ̆ 7 s <b>reliance</b> <b>interest</b> when they should, but the courts 2 ̆ 7 imperfect understanding of the parties 2 ̆ 7 behavior sometimes leads them to err...|$|E
40|$|For generations, Americans have tapped {{their life}} savings and assumed {{huge amounts of}} debt {{in order to achieve}} the American dream of owning their own home. Though {{investing}} so heavily in a single asset is a rather risky move on its face, buyers have been induced to purchase homes by a slew of public policies, most notably zoning ordinances that buffer single-family neighborhoods against an invasion of unwanted uses. As a result, homeowners have a fairly convincing argument that they possess some sort of vested <b>reliance</b> <b>interest</b> in the existing zoning of their neighborhoods that should prevent municipal authorities from enacting unwanted zoning changes. Courts, however, have not been receptive to homeowners’ pleas when such zoning changes are threatened. While courts will frequently safeguard the reliance interests of landowners who have undertaken substantial expenditures to develop their property, they offer no such protection for the reliance interests of landowners who desire to prevent development on neighboring property. I argue that the distinction between developers’ and neighbors’ reliance interests rests on judicial intuitions {{about the nature of the}} local political process: courts suspect that homeowners are likely to be the dominant faction in most municipalities and can therefore prevent unwanted development through their influence with city hall, whereas developers are unlikely to be powerful in a local political process dominated by antidevelopment homeowners, especially once a developer has made substantial expenditures on a particular project. This conclusion leads to a broader insight: judicial review of land use decision making is largely driven by a desire to protect the reliance interests of both developers and homeowners. Thus, courts are generally deferential toward most 950 municipal land use policies that privilege homeowners’ reliance interests but occasionally temper that deference with solicitude for developers. The courts’ fetishization of reliance interests has come at a substantial price, however. For the sake of protecting reliance interests in existing zoning schemes, courts have essentially reified a longstanding pattern of de facto income and racial segregation in most metropolitan regions by licensing suburban communities to maintain zoning barriers that enforce such segregation. Moreover, I conclude that the judicial enterprise to protect reliance interests by empowering local governments is entirely self-defeating because, as the recent real estate downturn vividly illustrates, property values are determined by a complex web of forces well beyond the control of local governments...|$|E
40|$|Patent {{applications}} are evaluated {{in light of}} the prior art. What this means is that patent examiners evaluate a claimed invention by comparing it with what in a rough sense corresponds to the set of ideas and inventions already known to the public. This is done for three reasons. First, the comparison helps to ensure that patents issue only in cases where an inventor has made a non-trivial contribution to the public’s store of knowledge. Second, it protects a possible <b>reliance</b> <b>interest</b> {{on the part of the}} public since, once an invention is widely known, members of the public might reasonably assume that the invention is free for all to use. And third, it pressures inventors to file their patent applications promptly lest some other inventor disclose a related invention or the applicant himself inadvertently let slip some fraction of his own research result. The prior art inquiry has a fourth policy implication, however, and while this one might not have been one of the motivating factors for establishing the inquiry in the first place, it is just as important when it comes to designing and interpreting sensible prior art rules. That additional wrinkle is simply this: the fact that patent {{applications are}} evaluated {{in light of the}} prior art gives firms a strategic incentive to create prior art. A firm can publish a journal article or engage in a public demonstration and in that way affect both a rival’s ability to patent a related invention and the rival 2 ̆ 7 s incentive to do so. Perhaps surprisingly, this can make the disclosing firm better off even though, by revealing information, the firm is likely helping its rival and, worse, narrowing or even fully preempting the very patent it seeks. In this Article, then, we explain the incentive for strategic disclosure. We show that a firm trailing in a given patent race has an incentive to disclose information in the hopes of preempting a rival 2 ̆ 7 s patent, but only if the laggard itself has little chance of leapfrogging the leader and winning the race. We show that a firm leading a patent race similarly has an incentive to disclose, this time in an effort to reduce its rival 2 ̆ 7 s expected payoff and in that way encourage the rival to quit the race. We consider the possibility that private negotiations will displace public disclosures, for example with the laggard agreeing not to disclose and in exchange receiving from the ultimate patentee some form of favorable licensing agreement. Lastly, we consider the implications all this might have for the patent system overall...|$|E
40|$|This is {{one report}} in the series of reports that discuss the {{campaign}} finance practices and related issues. Concerns over financing federal elections have become a seemingly perennial aspect of our political system, centered on the enduring issues of high campaign costs and <b>reliance</b> on <b>interest</b> groups for needed campaign funds. The report talks about the today’s paramount issues such as perceived loopholes in current law and the longstanding issues: overall costs, funding sources, and competition...|$|R
50|$|He joined Scalia in dismissing O'Connor's {{stare decisis}} concerns. I {{see no reason}} to think that the costs of overruling Southland are unacceptably high. Certainly no <b>reliance</b> <b>interests</b> are {{involved}} in cases like the present one, where the applicability of the FAA was not within the contemplation of the parties at the time of contracting. In many other cases, moreover, the parties will simply comply with their arbitration agreement, either on the theory that they should live up to their promises or on the theory that arbitration is the cheapest and best way of resolving their dispute. In a fair number of the remaining cases, the party seeking to enforce an arbitration agreement will be able to get into federal court, where the FAA will apply. And even if access to federal court is impossible (because § 2 creates no independent basis for federal-question jurisdiction), many cases will arise in States whose own law largely parallels the FAA. Even if stare decisis did apply, Thomas concluded, it would not cover the procedural requirements of the act since the Court had never formally held that those applied to the states as well.|$|R
40|$|In this Article, Professor Fisch assesses currrent {{retroactivity}} {{doctrine and}} proposes a new framework for retroactivity analysis. Current law {{has failed to}} reflect the complexity of defining retroactivity and to harmonize the conflicting concerns of efficiency and fairness that animate retroactivity doctrine. By drawing a sharp distinction between adjudication and legislation, the law has also overlooked the similarity {{of the issues that}} retroactivity raises in both contexts. Professor Fisch 2 ̆ 7 s analysis, influenced by the legal process school, uses an equilibrium approach to connect retroactivity analysis to theories of legal change. Instead of focusing {{on the nature of the}} new legal rule, this approach emphasizes the context in which change occurs. If an area of the law is settled, a stable equilibrium, <b>reliance</b> <b>interests</b> are at their peak. Retroactivity thus presents serious fairness and efficiency concerns and should be disfavored. If the regulatory context is in flux, an unstable equilibrium exists, and retroactivity may be more appropriate. Professor Fisch 2 ̆ 7 s use of equilibrium theory improves doctrinal analysis of the temporal line-drawing associated with legal change and clarifies the relationship of retroactivity rules to lawmaking powe 1 ·...|$|R
