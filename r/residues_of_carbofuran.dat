40|$|Hydrophilic {{interaction}} {{liquid chromatography}} (HILIC) {{equipped with an}} environmentally friendly capillary column was employed to investigate the retention behavior of carbofuran; a polar stationary phase was used as well. Several conditions were conducted to investigate the retention behavior <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran,</b> such as a comparison study TSKgel®Amide- 80 with another polar column, a comparison study retention behavior <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran</b> on various wavelengths, the water content effect on HILIC mode, the effect of buffer concentration on HILIC mode, and the analytical performance <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran.</b> The results showed that TSKgel®Amide- 80 exhibited a better performance than other polar stationary phases in carbofuran determination, and observations at wavelengths of 251 and 254 nm showed higher absorbance for carbofuran than others. In addition, the increase of water content and salt buffer concentration in the mobile phase led to a shorter retention time. The recovery of this method was 101 ± 10. 1 %, while the limit of detection and the limit of quantification were 0. 66 ppm and 2. 22 ppm, respectively. Consequently, TSKgel®Amide- 80 offers a good performance in carbofuran determination, even with the application of 10 cm length column capillary liquid chromatograph...|$|R
40|$|The {{object of}} this work was to verify the utility of a level IV {{fugacity}} model to simulate the environmental fate <b>of</b> the insecticide <b>carbofuran</b> when employed in the cultivation of irrigated rice. The model simulated the dynamic distribution <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran</b> in a system comprising of air, water, rice plants and the soil. The results indicated preferential compartments quality, and provided further knowledge of the fate <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran</b> in rice cultivation. Field experiments on rice were carried out to test the correspondence between simulated and measured carbofuran concentration in water and soil. Simulated concentrations had higher values in the compartments water > soil > rice plants > air. The model can be {{a useful tool for}} simulating the environmental fate of this insecticide and can be coupled with sensitivity and uncertainty analyses to test the influence of all input parameters on the outputs. 200...|$|R
40|$|Column liquid {{chromatography}} with mass spectrometric detection (LC-MS) {{has been widely}} accepted as the preferred technique for the identification and quantification of polar and thermally labile compounds at trace levels. Over the last decade {{many different types of}} LC-MS interfacing techniques have been used for the determination of carbamate pesticides and especially for the N-methylcarbamate carbofuran. This article addresses the difficulties encountered with the various types of LC-MS interface and discusses recent alternatives for the determination <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran.</b> With thermospray and particle beam interfaces the quantification <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran</b> is affected by both the ion source pressure and temperature, whereas quantification using the recently developed atmospheric pressure ionization interfaces, atmospheric pressure chemical ionization, electrospray, and ionspray, is less dependent on these parameters. © 1995...|$|R
40|$|Carbofuran, a {{potential}} environmental xenobiotic, {{has the ability}} to cross blood brain barrier and to adversely influence brain functions. In the present study, the impact <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran</b> on the biophysical and biochemical properties of rat brain AChE has been evaluated in vitro. This enzyme was membrane-bound which could be solubilised using Triton-X 100 (0. 2 %, v/v), a nonionic detergent, in the extraction buffer (50 [*]mM phosphate, pH 7. 4). The enzyme was highly stable up to one month when stored at - 20 °C and exhibited optimum activity at pH 7. 4 and 37 °C. AChE displayed a direct relationship between activity and varying substrate concentrations (acetylthiocholine iodide (ATI)) by following Michaelis-Menten curve. The Km and Vmax values as computed from the Lineweaver-Burk double reciprocal plot of the data were found to be 0. 07 [*]mM and 0. 066 [*]µmole/mL/min, respectively. The enzyme exhibited IC 50 value for carbofuran equal to 6. 0 [*]nM. The steady-state kinetic studies to determine mode <b>of</b> action <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran</b> on rat brain AChE displayed it to be noncompetitive in nature with Ki value equal to 5 [*]nm. These experiments suggested that rat brain AChE was very sensitive to carbofuran and this enzyme might serve as a significant biomarker <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran</b> induced neurotoxicity...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an amperometric {{immunosensor}} modified with protein A/deposited gold nanocrystals (DpAu) {{was developed}} for the ultrasensitive detection <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran</b> <b>residues.</b> First, DpAu were electrodeposited onto the Au electrode surface to absorb protein A (PA) and improve the electrode conductivity. Then PA was dropped {{onto the surface of}} DpAu film, used for binding antibody Fc fragments. Next, anti-carbofuran monoclonal antibody was immobilized on the PA modified electrode. Finally, bovine serum albumin (BSA) was employed to block the possible remaining active sites avoiding any nonspecific adsorption. The fabrication procedure of the immunosensor was characterized by electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV), respectively. With the excellent electroconductivity of DpAu and the PA’s oriented immobilization of antibodies, a highly efficient immuno-reaction and detection sensitivity could be achieved. The influences of the electrodeposition time of DpAu, pH of the detection solution and incubation time on the current response of the fabricated immunosensor were investigated. Under optimized conditions, the current response was proportional to the concentration <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran</b> which ranged from 1 to 100 ng/mL and 100 ng/mL to 100 μg/mL. The detection limit was 0. 1924 ng/mL. The proposed carbofuran immnuosensor exhibited high specificity, reproducibility, stability and regeneration performance, which may open a new door for ultrasensitive detection <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran</b> <b>residues</b> in vegetables and fruits...|$|R
40|$|Carbofuran (2, 3 -dihydro- 2, 2 -dimethyl- 7 -benzofuranyl methylcarbamate) is a toxic {{insecticide}} {{widely used}} on potato (Solanum tuberosum L.) crops in Carchi Province, Ecuador. Carbofuran can leach to groundwater {{and become a}} threat for both {{human health and the}} environment. To determine the extent <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran</b> presence in the area, we sampled soil leachate, groundwater, and surface water from within 14 hydrologic units (each 2. 5 – 20 ha) where potato was being grown from September to November 1999. Carbofuran was found in all hydrologic units except one, at concentrations that were in-versely proportional to the organic matter content of the predominant soil type. A simulation study showed that the Leaching Estimation and Chemistry Model (LEACHM) could be a valuable tool for evaluating carbofuran fate, because it was shown to correctly identify soil types with the greatest risk for leaching. Concerns about the adverse effects <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran</b> on {{human health and the environment}} led to an analysis of farmer practices and pesticide use in two Carchi watersheds during the early 1990 s (Crissman et al., 1998 a). This analysis showed that most of the negative impacts of pesticide use on human health were due to pesticide exposure following unsafe storage, handling, and application. Although the fate <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran</b> in the environment was not measured and monitored directly, modeling studies indicated that leaching <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran</b> would be minimal because of the high organic matter (OM) content of soils in the region; sorption of the pesticide increases with increasing OM content (Ducrot et al., 1998). These results, however, do not suggest that carbofuran poses no adverse environmental risks in the potato-growing areas of Carchi. Rather, they have pro-vided the impetus for several mor...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the {{application}} of ultraviolet irradiation and zinc oxide (UV/ZnO) process water and wastewater treatment has gained removal activity of the persistence organic compounds. The degradation <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran</b> pesticide was investigated under ultraviolet irradiation and zinc oxide (UV/ZnO) process.

Results showed that the <b>carbofuran</b> initial concentration <b>of</b> 50 mg/L, ZnO concentration of 300 mg/L, pH of 8, light intensity of 125 watts and reaction volume of 150 mL, were the optimum condition for degradation <b>of</b> <b>carbofuran</b> by UV/ZnO system.
