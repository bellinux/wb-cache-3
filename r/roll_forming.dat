5|$|Similar alloys {{with the}} {{addition}} of a small amount of lead can be cold-rolled into sheets. An alloy of 96% zinc and 4% aluminium is used to make stamping dies for low production run applications for which ferrous metal dies would be too expensive. For building facades, roofing, and other applications for sheet metal formed by deep drawing, <b>roll</b> <b>forming,</b> or bending, zinc alloys with titanium and copper are used. Unalloyed zinc is too brittle for these manufacturing processes.|$|E
25|$|The {{extrusion}} {{process is}} generally economical when producing between several kilograms (pounds) and many tons, {{depending on the}} material being extruded. There is a crossover point where <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> becomes more economical. For instance, some steels become more economical to roll if producing more than 20,000kg (50,000lb).|$|E
50|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>forming</b> lines {{can be set}} up with {{multiple}} configurations to punch and cut off parts in a continuous operation. For cutting a part to length, the lines {{can be set up}} to use a pre-cut die where a single blank runs through the roll mill, or a post-cut die where the profile is cutoff after the <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> process. Features may be added in a hole, notch, embossment, or shear form by punching in a <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> line. These part features can be done in a pre-punch application (before <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> starts), in a mid-line punching application (in the middle of a <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> line/process) or a post punching application (after <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> is done). Some <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> lines incorporate only one of the above punch or cutoff applications, others incorporate {{some or all of the}} applications in one line.|$|E

50|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>Forming</b> Corp., {{incorporated}} in 1947 and headquartered in Shelbyville, Kentucky, is the <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> division of voestalpine AG. The company has supplied parts for {{the aerospace industry}} since 1949 and for Boeing airplanes since 1969. It also supplies NASA and McDonnell Douglas. Products also include model train tracks and gymnasium bleachers. At first the company made aluminum parts for airplane structures, but in the late 1980s, <b>Roll</b> <b>Forming</b> added preparing parts for assembly. The company still uses this process for Spirit AeroSystems, which puts together stringers for many of Boeing's larger planes. Other locations for <b>Roll</b> <b>Forming</b> are Jeffersonville, Indiana and Farrell, Pennsylvania. <b>Roll</b> <b>Forming</b> agreed to the purchase by Voest-Alpine Krems in 2000, giving the Voest-Alpine Stahl AG subsidiary its first manufacturing facilities in the United States.|$|E

50|$|<b>Roll</b> <b>forming</b> is, {{among the}} {{manufacturing}} processes, {{one of the}} simplest. It typically begins with a large coil of sheet metal, between 1 inch cm and 20 inch cm. in width, and 0.004 inch mm and 0.125 inch mm thick, supported on an uncoiler. The strip is fed through an entry guide to properly align the material as it passes through the rolls of the mill, each set of rolls forming a bend until the material reaches its desired shape. Roll sets are typically mounted {{one over the other}} on a pair of horizontal parallel shafts supported by a stand(s). Side rolls and cluster rolls may also be used to provide greater precision and flexibility and to limit stresses on the material. The shaped strips can be cut to length ahead of a <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> mill, between mills, or {{at the end of the}} <b>roll</b> <b>forming</b> line.|$|E
