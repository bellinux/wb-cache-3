40|$|With the {{scaling of}} CMOS technology, the {{proportion}} of the leakage power to total power consumption increases. Leakage may account for almost half of total power consumption in high performance processors. In order to reduce the leakage power, there is an increasing interest in using nonvolatile storage devices for memory applications. Among various promising nonvolatile memory elements, spin-transfer torque magnetic RAM (STT-MRAM) is identified {{as one of the most}} attractive alternatives to conventional SRAM. However, several design challenges of STT-MRAM such as shared read and write current paths, single-ended sensing, and high dynamic power are major challenges to be overcome to make it suitable for on-chip memories. To mitigate such problems, we propose a domain wall coupling based spin-transfer torque (DWCSTT) device for on-chip caches. Our proposed DWCSTT bit-cell decouples the read and the write current paths by the electrically-insulating magnetic coupling layer so that we can separately optimize read operation without having an impact on write-ability. In addition, the complementary polarizer structure in the <b>read</b> <b>path</b> of the DWCSTT device allows DWCSTT to enable self-referenced differential sensing. DWCSTT bit-cells improve the write power consumption due to the low electrical resistance of the write current path. Furthermore, we also present three different bit-cell level design techniques of Spin-Orbit Torque MRAM (SOT-MRAM) for alleviating some of the inefficiencies of conventional magnetic memories while maintaining the advantages of spin-orbit torque (SOT) based novel switching mechanism such as low write current requirement and decoupled read and write current path. Our proposed SOT-MRAM with supporting dual read/write ports (1 R/ 1 W) can address the issue of high-write latency of STT-MRAM by simultaneous 1 R/ 1 W accesses. Second, we propose a new type of SOT-MRAM which uses only one access transistor along with a Schottky diode in order to mitigate the area-overhead caused by two access transistors in conventional SOT-MRAM. Finally, a new design technique of SOT-MRAM is presented to improve the integration density by utilizing a shared bit-line structure. ...|$|E
40|$|As CMOS scaling {{continues}} to sub- 32 nm regime, {{the effects of}} device variations become more prominent. This is very critical in SRAMs, which use very small transistor dimensions to achieve high memory density. The conventional 6 T SRAM bit-cell, which provides the smallest cell-area, fails to operate at lower supply voltages (Vdd). This {{is due to the}} significant degradation of functional margins as the supply voltage is scaled down. However, Vdd scaling is crucial in reducing the energy consumption of SRAMs, which is {{a significant portion of the}} overall energy consumption in modern micro-processors. Energy savings in SRAM is particularly important for batteryoperated applications, which run from a very constrained power-budget. This thesis focuses on energy-efficient 6 T SRAM design in a 28 nm FDSOI technology. Significant savings in energy/access of the SRAM is achieved using two techniques: Vdd scaling and data prediction. A 200 mV improvement in the minimum SRAM operating voltage (Vdd,min) is achieved by using dynamic forward body-biasing (FBB) on the NMOS devices of the bit-cell. The overhead of dynamic FBB is reduced by implementing it row-wise. Layout modifications are proposed to share the body terminals (n-wells) horizontally, along a row. Further savings in energy/access is achieved by incoporating data-prediction in the 6 T <b>read</b> <b>path,</b> which reduces bitline switching. The proposed techniques are implemented for a 128 Kb 6 T SRAM, designed in a 28 nm FDSOI technology. This thesis also presents a reconfigurable fully-integrated switched-capacitor based step-up DC-DC converter, which can be used to generate the body-bias voltage for a SRAM. 3 reconfigurable conversion ratios of 5 / 2, 2 / 1 and 3 / 2 are implemented in the converter. It provides a wide range of output voltage, 1. 2 V- 2. 4 V, from a fixed input of 1 V. The converter achieves a peak efficiency of 88 %, using only on-chip MOS and MOM capacitors, for a high density implementation. by Avishek Biswas. Thesis: S.

40|$|In this paper, an {{ultra-low}} power (ULP) 10 T static {{random access}} memory (SRAM) is presented for Internet of Things (IoT) applications, which operates at sub-threshold voltage. The proposed SRAM has the tendency to operate at low supply voltages with high static and dynamic noise margins. The IoT application requires battery-enabled low leakage memory architecture in a subthreshold regime. Therefore, to improve leakage power consumption and provide better cell stability, a power-gated robust 10 T SRAM is presented in this paper. The proposed cell uses a power-gated p-MOS transistor to reduce the leakage power or static power in standby mode. Moreover, due to the stacking of n-MOS transistors in 10 T SRAM latch and by separating the <b>read</b> <b>path</b> from the 10 T SRAM latch, the static and dynamic noise margins in read and write operations has shown significant tolerance w. r. t. the variations in device process, voltage, and temperature (PVT) values. The proposed SRAM shows significantly improved performance in terms of leakage power, read static noise margin (RSNM), write static noise margin (WSNM), write ability or write trip point (WTP), read–write energy, and dynamic read margin (DRM). Furthermore, these parameters of the proposed cell are observed at 8 -Kilo bit (Kb) SRAM and compared with existing SRAM architectures. From the Monte Carlo simulation results, it is observed that the leakage power of a proposed low threshold voltage-LVT 10 T SRAM is reduced by 98. 76 %, 98. 6 %, 6. 7 %, and 98. 2 % as compared to the LVT C 6 T, RD 8 T, LP 9 T, and ST 10 T SRAM, respectively, at 0. 3 V VDD.

40|$|Digital-to-analog (D/A) {{converters}} (or DACs) are one {{the fundamental}} {{building blocks of}} wireless transmitters. In order to support the increasing demand for highdata-ate communication, a large bandwidth is required from the DAC. With the advances in CMOS scaling, there is an increasing trend of moving {{a large part of}} the transceiver functionality to the digital domain in order to reduce the analog complexity and allow easy reconguration for multiple radio standards. ΔΣ DACs can t very well into this trend of digital architectures as they contain a large digital signal processing component and oer two advantages over the traditionally used Nyquist DACs. Firstly, the number of DAC unit current cells is reduced which relaxes their matching and output impedance requirements and secondly, the reconstruction lter order is reduced. Achieving a large bandwidth from ΔΣ DACs requires a very high operating frequency of many-GHz from the digital blocks due to the oversampling involved. This can be very challenging to achieve using conventional ΔΣ DAC architectures, even in nanometer CMOS processes. Time-interleaved ΔΣ (TIDSM) DACs have the potential of improving the bandwidth and sampling rate by relaxing the speed of the individual channels. However, they have received only some attention over the past decade and very few previous works been reported on this topic. Hence, the aim of this dissertation is to investigate architectural and circuit techniques that can further enhance the bandwidth and sampling rate of TIDSM DACs. The rst work is an 8 -GS/s interleaved ΔΣ DAC prototype IC with 200 -MHz bandwidth implemented in 65 -nm CMOS. The high sampling rate is achieved by a two-channel interleaved MASH 1 - 1 digital ΔΣ modulator with 3 -bit output, resulting in a highly digital DAC with only seven current cells. Two-channel interleaving allows the use of a single clock for both the logic and the nal multiplexing. This requires each channel to operate at half the sampling rate i. e. 4 GHz. This is enabled by a high-speed pipelined MASH structure with robust static logic. Measurement results from the prototype show that the DAC achieves 200 -MHz bandwidth, – 57 -dBc IM 3 and 26 -dB SNDR, with a power consumption of 68 -mW at 1 -V digital and 1. 2 -V analog supplies. This architecture shows good potential for use in the transmitter baseband. While a good linearity is obtained from this DAC, the SNDR is found to be limited by the testing setup for sending high-speed digital data into the prototype. The performance of a two-channel interleaved ΔΣ DAC is found to be very sensitive to the duty-cycle of the half-rate clock. The second work analyzes this eect mathematically and presents a new closed-form expression for the SNDR loss of two-channel DACs due to the duty cycle error (DCE) for a noise transfer function (NTF) of (1  — z— 1) n. It is shown that a low-order FIR lter after the modulator helps to mitigate this problem. A closed-form expression for the SNDR loss in the presence of this lter is also developed. These expressions are useful for choosing a suitable modulator and lter order for an interleaved ΔΣ DAC in the early stage of the design process. A comparison between the FIR lter and compensation techniques for DCE mitigation is also presented. The nal work is a 11 GS/s 1. 1 GHz bandwidth time-interleaved DAC prototype IC in 65 -nm CMOS for the 60 -GHz radio baseband. The high sampling rate is again achieved by using a two-channel interleaved MASH 1 - 1 architecture with a 4 -bit output i. e only fteen analog current cells. The single clock architecture for the logic and the multiplexing requires each channel to operate at 5. 5 GHz. To enable this, a new look-ahead technique is proposed that decouples the two channels within the modulator feedback path thereby improving the speed as compared to conventional loop-unrolling. Full speed DAC testing is enabled by an on-chip 1 Kb memory whose <b>read</b> <b>path</b> also operates at 5. 5 GHz. Measurement results from the prototype show that the ΔΣ DAC achieves > 53 dB SFDR, < — 49 dBc IM 3 and 39 dB SNDR within a 1. 1 GHz bandwidth while consuming 117 mW from 1 V digital/ 1. 2 V analog supplies. The proposed ΔΣ DAC can satisfy the spectral mask of the 60 -GHz radio IEEE 802. 11 ad WiGig standard with a second order reconstruction lter...|$|E
