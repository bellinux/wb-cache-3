However, research indicates that educationalists attempting to convey these principles through didactic methods are finding difficulties engaging in meaningful discussion with their students, whether it be due to lack of training, motivation or engagement of the subject matter. Research into blended learning interventions such as game based learning has shown promise in delivering a viable and cost effective solution in this area whilst helping to promote open discussion amongst teachers and students in the classroom. To address the need for a new approach to delivering RSE, a serious game titled PR:EPARe (Positive Relationships: Eliminating Coercion and Pressure in Adolescent Relationships), developed by the Serious Games Institute (SGI) and Coventry University group, Studies in Adolescent Sexual Health (SASH) is proposed in an effort to assist the delivery of RSE concerning the topic of sexual and peer coercion to young people aged 13 to 14. The adoption of using a game based learning device developed from prior research carried out by the SASH group informs the choices taken for the context and learning objectives set out to be achieved by PR:EPARe. The ideal methodology of serious games design and development is an area greatly contested by researchers with various theories including frameworks, models and methods available on the supreme way to aid development of game-based learning applications. Within the fray of these collected works, often reflections of similar features in serious games arise such as themes concerning pedagogy, visual design and technology. This thesis explores three of these methods of developing games and intervention methods for the development purpose of the game PR:EPARe. This research attempts to present a unified preliminary methodology for future evaluation as its main research contribution (please see Introduction, Chapter 1 for more information). The researcher draws conclusions and similarities from each of the three methodologies and as the lead designer (see Introduction, Chapter 1 for explanation) adopts these aspects into the development process of the PR:EPARe game. Finally the researcher presents a reflective analysis of the evaluation data, (evaluation designed and conducted by SASH) and presents conclusions on development methods adopted in the process of the PR:EPARe game that have shown positive results. These are gathered to form a unified methodology for further evaluation in future works. As the research and development of PR:EPARe was conducted in collaboration with SASH and the SGI it must be made clear the role of the researcher in light of this research and the original contribution made. A full explanation of the role that the researcher (contributor of thesis) adopted: lead designer and the researcher’s contribution {{can be found in the}} Introduction, Chapter 1, and Section 1. 5. To address the overall aim and the objectives of this research, presented in this thesis is a reflective analysis conducted by the lead designer on the project PR:EPARe, a game based intervention approach conducted to tackle the topic of sexual coercion. This research is conducted from a game research and design perspective, documenting the development of the game and the process of applying user and pedagogic theories alongside game and intervention techniques. To begin, the research will present a comparative analysis of three development methods/frameworks that were central in the making of the game PR:EPARe. The three methods/frameworks: Bartholomew’s Intervention Mapping approach [1], Hunicke et al’s Mechanics, Dynamics and Aesthetics Model [2] and De Freitas and Jarvis’s Four-Dimensional framework [3] were chosen through an extensive literary review conducted by the researcher of this thesis, the SGI and SASH. The researcher employed the use of the 4 DF and the MDA frameworks whilst SASH developed the approaches outlined in the IM framework. Prior research conducted by SASH concerning the IM approach to develop PR:EPARe was used by the researcher in order to support and produce informed R&D decisions throughout the project. A comparison is drawn between each of the methods/frameworks linking the main corresponding themes that were used in the production of PR:EPARe. The overall aim of this research is to present a unified version of the methods/frameworks through a reflective analysis of the evaluation of PR:EPARe, amalgamating assessment, design, pedagogy and evaluation to present a new methodology to aid in future development of health based serious games...|$|R

The {{aim of this study}} was to assess knowledge and attitude of dental patients about the effects of smoking on oral health and their cessation efforts. Methods and materials: In this descriptive analysis-cross sectional study, 905 patients from dental clinics in Kerman were selected. They were asked to complete a self- administered structured questionnaire on the effects of smoking on oral health. The questionnaire consisted of questions about demographic data, smoking status, patients' knowledge and attitude about the effects of smoking and cessation efforts of them. Finally, data was analyzed with SPSS program, t test and x 2 test. Result: A total 905 patients (53 % men and 47 % women) were studied. The mean age was 32. 76 ± 9. 509. The prevalence of smoking was 20. 5 %. The <b>relationship</b> between <b>sex</b> <b>and</b> <b>education</b> and smoking was significant (p value = 0. 0001). Mean Knowledge score was 53. 95 %. Smoking patients and men were significantly less aware of the effects of smoking on oral health. In this study, 54. 9 % of smoking patients had tried to quit smoking. Only 12. 2 % had taken counselling. The attitude toward cigarettes was passive.

40|$|The {{application}} of game-based learning adds play into educational and instructional contexts. Even {{though there is}} a lack of standard methodologies or formulaic frameworks to better inform game-based intervention development, there exist scientific and empirical studies that can serve as benchmarks for establishing scientific validity in terms of the efficacy of using games to achieve serious outcomes. The development of these games does not normally follow a specific set of guidelines, which limits replication. There is a need to reflect on such a multidisciplinary process and infuse knowledge from relevant disciplines towards developing a unity of considerations and approaches beyond the disciplinary perspectives. An infused and trans-disciplinary methodological framework could serve as a guideline to inform the development process of a game-based approach. With these perspectives, this paper aims to provide an example of how relevant theories and frameworks can be adopted collectively in order to inform a development process. Based on a digital game intervention aiming to support the delivery of <b>Relationships</b> <b>and</b> <b>Sex</b> <b>Education</b> (RSE) in the UK, this paper reflects on trans-disciplinary considerations, informed by frameworks such as the Four-Dimensional Framework (4 DF), the Intervention Mapping (IM) approach, Mechanics Dynamics Aesthetics model (MDA) and Learning Mechanics-Game Mechanics (LM-GM) mapping. IM, when infused with the game design considerations of 4 DF, provides a more procedural perspective to game-based intervention development, collectively reflecting a participatory development approach. This subsequently provides the basis upon which other theoretical and methodological frameworks such as the MDA and the LM-GM models can be embedded in order to marry the pedagogical aspects with the entertainment attributes of gameplay. These components, when integrated, may formulate a trans-disciplinary model that can be adopted and adapted by other researchers, designers and developers...|$|E

40|$|More than 1000 {{young people}} aged between 16 – 27 {{years of age}} participated in this {{research}} study, with almost two-thirds reporting homophobic or transphobic harassment or violence across different aspects of their lives. Executive summary: This pilot project, conducted with young people who identify as gender and sexuality diverse, was undertaken during 2012 - 2013. It was a collaborative project involving academics from the University of Western Sydney – Professor Kerry Robinson, Dr Peter Bansel, Dr Nida Denson, and Dr Georgia Ovenden; two external consultants with expertise in filmmaking, script writing and performance – Cristyn Davies and Elena Knox; and Twenty 10 – a Young and Well CRC supporting partner, located in Sydney, New South Wales. Twenty 10 is an organisation focusing on those needing support around identity issues associated with gender and sexuality diversity. This pilot research aimed: (i) to {{gain an understanding of}} the experiences of young people who identify as gender variant and sexuality diverse across a broad range of issues such as identity, health and wellbeing, education, technology, and access to services; (ii) to work creatively and collaboratively with a group of these young people to begin to develop innovative, relevant and engaging resources based on research findings that would contribute to increasing professional and community awareness of their experiences and needs; and (iii) in the development of these resources, to provide this group of young people with a valuable and socially engaged experience of documentary-style video production using hand-held technologies – in this case, iPods. The findings outlined in this report are {{based on the results of}} a national survey  conducted as part of this pilot research, completed by 1032 young people between the ages of 16 – 27 who identified as gender variant or sexuality diverse; as well as a focus group and interactive workshops involving approximately 20 young people, aged between 16 – 23, who volunteered to participate during their attendance at the Saturday afternoon drop-in activities at Twenty 10 over several consecutive weeks. Gender variance refers to expressions of gender that do not match that predicted by one’s sex, including people who identify as transgender, transsexual, gender queer, or intersex. Sexuality diverse is a broad term used to include people who identify as gay, lesbian, bisexual, queer, pansexual or questioning their sexuality. The young participants who completed the survey attended a focus group and workshops, were primarily from Anglo-Celtic backgrounds, but there were representations from Indigenous Australian, Asian, Maori, Pacific Islander, Middle Eastern, Central and South American, European and African backgrounds. 53 % of respondents completing the online survey were female identified, 39 % were male identified, 4 % were gender variant, 3 % were transgender (1 % male to female, and 2 % female to male), and 0. 3 % were intersex (note that the total percentage adds up to 99 % due to rounding). Almost all of the focus group and workshops participants were male identified, including transgender female to male. The majority, 61 % of participants completing the survey identified as lesbian or gay, 25 % were bisexual, 10 % identified as queer, 3 % questioning their sexuality, and 1 % identified as heterosexual (‘straight’). Those attending the focus group were largely gay or queer identified. Most of the young people who completed the survey were working full-time (23. 6 %) or part-time (27. 4 %), or attending university (38. 0 %) or TAFE (7. 8 %), some were still at school (16. 3 %) and 12. 9 % were unemployed (see Appendix Graph 6). Just over half (50. 1 %) were living in the family home, with others living with relatives, in shared housing, with partners, rental accommodation, boarding houses, on the streets, or in refuges. This pilot report is part of a larger package of resources, which includes five discrete short documentary style video clips, titled Growing Up Queer, addressing issues of identity, family <b>relationships,</b> homophobia/transphobia, <b>and</b> <b>sex</b> <b>education,</b> developed in collaboration with young participants involved in the focus group and workshops; and a performed ethnography, which entails the development of a play script/scenario, based on the research findings, to be used as an interactive professional development resource, in this instance, for high school teachers. The performed ethnography is accompanied by critical facilitator questions. The development of these professional development and community education resources will contribute to current efforts in counteracting homophobia and transphobia in families, schools and broader communities. Homophobia encompasses a range of negative attitudes and feelings – e. g. hatred, disgust, contempt, prejudice, fear – towards those who identify as, or are perceived as being non heterosexual (or straight), such as lesbian, gay, bisexual, queer, transgendered or transsexual. Transphobia is similar, but is the negative feelings and attitudes directed at people who are gender variant.   This research was partnered with the University of Western Sydney and Twenty 10.
