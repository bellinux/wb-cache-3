2500|$|Several {{recent studies}} {{demonstrate}} how the PA63 pore allows the EF and LF into the cytoplasm when its lumen is so small. The lumen on the PA63 pore is only 15 Å (1.5nm) across, {{which is much}} smaller than the diameter of LF or EF. [...] Translocation occurs through a series of events which begin in the endosome as it acidifies. LF and EF are pH sensitive, and as the pH drops, their structures lose stability. Below a pH of 6.0 (the pH in an endosome), both LF and EF become disordered molten globules. When a molecule is in this conformation, the N-terminus is freed and drawn into the pore by the proton gradient and positive transmembrane potential. A ring of seven phenylalanines at the mouth endosome side of the pore (phenylalanine clamp) assists in the unfolding of LF or EF by interacting with the hydrophobic residues found in LF or EF. The proton gradient then begins to lace the protein though the pore. The lacing mechanism is driven by the gradient, but requires the phenylalanine clamp for a <b>ratcheting</b> motion. The first 250 residues of EF and LF have an irregular alternating sequence of basic, acidic, and hydrophobic residues. The interplay between the phenylalanine clamp and the protonation state cause a <b>ratcheting</b> effect that drives the protein though until enough has crossed into the cytoplasm to drag the rest through the pore as the N-terminus refolds (Fig. 11).|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} ac driven skyrmions {{interacting}} with an asymmetric substrate provide a realization {{of a new}} class of <b>ratchet</b> system which we call a vector <b>ratchet</b> that arises due to the effect of the Magnus term on the skyrmion dynamics. In a vector <b>ratchet,</b> the dc motion induced by the ac drive can be described as a vector that can be rotated clockwise or counterclockwise relative to the substrate asymmetry direction. Up to a full 360 ^∘ rotation is possible for varied ac amplitudes or skyrmion densities. In contrast to overdamped systems, in which <b>ratchet</b> motion is always parallel to the substrate asymmetry direction, vector <b>ratchets</b> allow the <b>ratchet</b> motion to be in any direction relative to the substrate asymmetry. It is also possible to obtain a reversal in the direction of rotation of the vector <b>ratchet,</b> permitting the creation of a reversible vector <b>ratchet.</b> We examine vector <b>ratchets</b> for ac drives applied parallel or perpendicular to the substrate asymmetry direction, and show that reverse <b>ratchet</b> motion can be produced by collective effects. No reversals occur for an isolated skyrmion on an asymmetric substrate. Since a vector <b>ratchet</b> can produce motion in any direction, it could represent a new method for controlling skyrmion motion for spintronic applications. Comment: 10 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
