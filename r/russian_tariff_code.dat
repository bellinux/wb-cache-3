Due {{to a new}} data set, {{this is the first}} paper to accurately assess tariff rates. We find that the average tariff in Russia has increased between 2001 and 2003, from about 11. 5 percent to between 13 percent and 14. 5 percent, but held steady in 2004 and 2005. This places Russia's tariffs at a level slightly higher than other middleincome countries and considerably higher than Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. Russia implemented tariff simplification in 2000 - 2001.

40|$|The {{ad valorem}} tariff rateson {{specific}} products and the ratio of tariff revenue to import value, the collected rate, are only tenuously related, contend the authors. Using tariff and revenue data (at the <b>tariff</b> <b>code</b> line level of detail) for three developing countries, the authors compare the statutory {{ad valorem tariff}} rates (official rates) with the ratio of tariff revenues to import values (collected rates). They document four facts: (1) the collected rate for any given item of the <b>tariff</b> <b>code</b> has almost no relationship to the official rate for that item; (2) the variation of collected rates around the official rate increases {{as the level of}} the official rate increases; (3) the collected rates increase much less, on average, than one-for-one with the official rates; and (4) above a certain level, collected rates do not increase at all despite increases in official rates. Collection rates appear to level off at roughly 50 percent. (In Kenya, collected rates are lower for high-tariff than for moderate-tariff items. Assigning lower rates for the high-tariff items would actually increase revenue on those items.) The implications of these findings are twofold for calculating general revenue. The rates are not the critical determinant of revenues. The revenue implications of large rate changes can be offset by modest changes in the system of exemptions, for example. The benefit of eliminating exemptions is primarily transparency. The costs of programs that provide import exemptions for, say, regional promotion, are often hidden in customs statistics. Secondly, if pressures that cause collected rates not to increase one-for-one with tariff rates will continue to be present in any tariff regime, then these must be factored into tariff reform design.

It is assumed that foreign direct investment in business services is necessary for multinationals to compete well with Russian business services providers, but cross-border service provision is also present. The model incorporates productivity effects in both goods and services markets endogenously, through a Dixit-Stiglitz framework. It is estimated that Russia will gain about 7. 2 % of the value of Russian consumption in the medium term from WTO accession and up to 24 % in the long run. It is also estimated that the largest gains to Russia will derive from liberalization of barriers against multinational service providers.

In order to promote the implementation of these measures, the <b>Tariff</b> <b>Code</b> establishes that the implementation costs of a measure {{and half of the}} net benefits will be reflected in the SEP supply tariffs. In this paper we analyze different criteria for valuing DSM measures, evaluating its effect in benefit cost ratio of the measures, in its merit order, in the total benefits value and, lastly, in the value that will be accepted in the SEP supply tariffs. It is shown that despite the attribution of high environmental premiums for the implementation of DSM measures, the costs for ton of CO 2 avoided are more reduced than those which would result from the implementation of equivalent measures from the supply side.

Third, there is substantial trade diversion from named to non-named countries and the diversion is greater the larger is the estimated duty.

Commission Regulation (EC) No 900 / 2008 lays down provisions and analysis methods for certain parameters necessary for the determination of the agricultural element.

A problem became apparent when the analysis of an instantised whey protein concentrate (WPC) imported from the USA into the EU revealed that the milk fat contained in the product was much below the expected one.

40|$|The aim of {{this article}} is to analyze the {{relationship}} between foreign policy and domestic policy, through an assessment of the Brazilian plea for change of Mercosur’s Common External Tariff (CET) of dairy products.

The analysis that is done is that such tariff level that is applied by Brazil has been presenting itself as being an equilibrium level, which, combined with a set of public policies, has been enabling the development of the sector, with important results along the past years. In this sense, and taking into account that the extinction of the National Lists of Exceptions to the CET is defined by a Mercosur decision, we evaluate as relevant that the country undertake efforts for consolidating the tariff level that it has been practicing (so far, as an exception measure) as the level of the Common External Tariff of the regional bloc...|$|R
40|$|An {{effective}} {{trade policy}} {{is central to}} the integration of Russia in the international economic system and the growth that will generate: Tariff policy is the centerpiece of trade policy in a market system. Tariffs are, with very few exceptions, the only acceptable policy tool for protection under the GATT/WTO; and they are superior to alternative instruments of protection, such as quotas, licenses and technical barriers to trade. Today's <b>Russian</b> <b>tariff</b> averages 13 - 14 % with ad valorem maximum tariffs of 30 % but with some specific tariffs that have ad valorem tariff equivalents higher than 30 %. The analysis in this paper strongly suggests that there is little economic justification and there are many dangers in providing differentiated tariff protection to various sectors of industry and agriculture in Russia today. Most of the arguments in which tariffs differentiated by product are the optimal policy intervention are of little practical significance: There are few products in which Russia has monopsony power or industries in which it can gain advantage through "strategic " application of tariffs. In many circumstances where tariffs are second best policy intruments, such as to raise public revenue or to cope with balance of payments problems, a uniform tariff rate is the most practical and efficient alternative. Where Russia may be interested in using the tariff as a bargaining instrument in multilateral negotiations, it is immaterial whether the tariff is uniform or differentiated [...] the issues have t...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: The <b>Russian</b> <b>tariff</b> {{structure}} contains over 11, 000 tariff lines, {{of which}} about 1, 700 use {{the so called}} “combined ” tariff rate system. For the combined system tariff lines, the actual <b>tariff</b> applied by <b>Russian</b> customs is the maximum of the ad valorem or specific tariff. The lack of available data and the difficulty in calculating the ad valorem equivalence of the specific tariffs have resulted in some previous efforts that have simply ignored the specific tariffs. This is the first paper to accurately assess the tariff rates. The authors show that ignoring the specific tariffs results in an underestimate of the actual tariff rates by about one to three percentage points, depending on the year. The average tariff in Russia has increased between 2001 and 2003 from about 11. 5 to between 13 and 14. 5 percent, but it has held steady in 2004 and 2005. This places Russia’s tariffs at a level slightly higher than other middle-income countries and considerably higher than the OECD countries. The trade weighted standard deviation of the tariff approximately doubled from 9. 5 percent in 2001 to 18 percent in 2003, but then fell to 15. 2 percent by 2005 The food sector and light industry are the aggregate sectors with the highest tariff rates—their tariff rates in 2005 were 23. 1 and 19. 5 percent on a trade-weighted basis, but the increase in their tariffs has not led {{to an increase in}} their output.

The McKinley tariff of 1890 substantially raised the duty on imported tinplate to encourage the entry and growth of domestic producers.
