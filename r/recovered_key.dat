Polynomially normal {{matrices}} in real indefinite {{inner product}} spaces are studied, i. e., matrices whose adjoint {{with respect to}} the indefinite inner product is a polynomial in the matrix. The set of these matrices is a subset of indefinite inner product normal matrices that contains all selfadjoint, skew-adjoint, and unitary matrices, but that is small enough such that all elements can be completely classified. The essential decomposition of a real polynomially normal matrix is introduced. This is a decomposition into three parts, one part having real spectrum only and two parts that can be described by two complex matrices that are polynomially normal with respect to a sesquilinear and bilinear form, respectively. In the paper, the essential decomposition is used as a tool in order to derive a sufficient condition for existence of invariant semidefinite subspaces and to obtain canonical forms for real polynomially normal matrices.

Las circunstancias históricas, políticas y económicas, desempeñaron un papel muy importante ya que Colombia y Perú enfrentaron un conflicto bélico en medio de la gran depresión económica mundial. En 1922 con la firma del Tratado Lozano Salomón se establecieron las fronteras entre ambos Estados. Pese a esto el 1 de septiembre de 1932 ciudadanos de Loreto inconformes con dicho Tratado, invadieron Leticia lo que conllevo el repudio de la comunidad internacional y el apoyo de la Sociedad de Naciones y Brasil para que la situación se resolviera de la mejor manera posible, y evitando en cualquier caso una confrontación de grandes proporciones. La teoría del Realismo de Hans Morgenthau y más específicamente el concepto del interés nacional explica como Colombia defendió en todo momento su interés nacional, de igual manera el autor Clausewitz con conceptos claves como que es la guerra, la guerra como continuación de la política por otros medios, y los objetivos políticos y militares en común darán al lector una aproximación teórica para explicar el tema de esta monografía.
