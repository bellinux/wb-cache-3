25|$|In {{the early}} 1960s, it was {{realized}} that a coincidental alignment of the outer planets would occur in the late 1970s and enable a single probe to visit Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune {{by taking advantage of}} the then-new technique of gravity assists. NASA began work on a Grand Tour, which evolved into a massive project involving two groups of two probes each, with one group visiting Jupiter, Saturn, and Pluto and the other Jupiter, Uranus, and Neptune. The spacecraft would be designed with <b>redundant</b> <b>systems</b> to ensure survival through the entire tour. By 1972 the mission was scaled back and replaced with two Mariner-derived spacecraft, the Mariner Jupiter-Saturn probes. To keep apparent lifetime program costs low, the mission would include only flybys of Jupiter and Saturn, but keep the Grand Tour option open. As the program progressed, the name was changed to Voyager.|$|E

Only few studies have investigated dependent failure with fuzzy parameters. Huang et al. (2008) addressed the fuzzy availability and fuzzy MTTF of a system with two components in series and parallel configurations. They categorized system failures into two groups of individual failures and common cause shock failures assuming failure rates to be fuzzy numbers with trapezoidal membership functions. Jain et al. (2012) investigated a repairable <b>redundant</b> <b>system</b> with imperfect coverage, common cause shock failure, reboots, and recovery, and determined the fuzzified reliability, availability, and MTTF. Jain (2016) studied a repairable <b>redundant</b> <b>system</b> with warm standby components and repair facility. He took into account the real system conditions including repair, repair delay, switching failure, and CCF. Taking these into consideration helped developing appropriate availability functions for the <b>redundant</b> <b>system.</b>|$|R

2500|$|During normal operation, the {{containment}} is air-tight and access is only through marine style airlocks. High air temperature and {{radiation from the}} core limit the time, measured in minutes, people can spend inside containment while the plant is operating at full power. In {{the event of a}} worst-case emergency, called a [...] "design basis accident" [...] in NRC regulations, {{the containment}} is designed to seal off and contain a meltdown. <b>Redundant</b> <b>systems</b> are installed to prevent a meltdown, but as a matter of policy, one is assumed to occur and thus the requirement for a containment building. For design purposes, the reactor vessel's piping is assumed to be breached, causing a [...] "LOCA" [...] (loss Of coolant accident) where the water in the reactor vessel is released to the atmosphere inside the containment and flashes into steam. The resulting pressure increase inside the containment, which is designed to withstand the pressure, triggers containment sprays ("dousing sprays") to turn on to condense the steam and thus reduce the pressure. A SCRAM ("neutronic trip") initiates very shortly after the break occurs. The safety systems close non-essential lines into the air-tight containment by shutting the isolation valves. Emergency Core Cooling Systems are quickly turned on to cool the fuel and prevent it from melting. The exact sequence of events depends on the reactor design.|$|E

Unfortunately, up to now, little or no research is available on how to implement such EM-diverse <b>redundant</b> <b>system.</b> This paper studies the effectiveness of spatial diversity to cope with EM disturbances caused by strong incident fields under reverberation room conditions. Here, reverberation room conditions refers to the situation where multiple plane waves are incident onto the system-under-study, each with a random angle-of-incidence, polarization and phase.

This study proposed an approximate Tω (the weakest t-norm) fuzzy Graphical Evaluation and Review Technique (GERT) simulation technology to simulate two-unit standby <b>redundant</b> <b>system</b> reliability. The approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations employ principle of interval arithmetic under the Tω arithmetic operations. Therefore, the novel fuzzy arithmetic operations may obtain fitter decision values, which have smaller fuzziness accumulating, under vague environment. In numerical examples the approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations has evidenced that it can successfully calculate results of fuzzy operations as interval arithmetic, and can more effectively reduce fuzzy spreads. In the real fuzzy repairable reliability model the performance also shows that the approximate fuzzy arithmetic operations successfully simulate/analyze the two-unit standby <b>redundant</b> <b>system</b> reliability and obtain more confident fuzzy results under vague environment...|$|R
