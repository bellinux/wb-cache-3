5|$|In {{starting}} a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD is drawing less than 50% of its <b>rated</b> <b>current</b> from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E

25|$|The {{manufacturer}} may {{specify the}} voltage drop across the fuse at <b>rated</b> <b>current.</b> There {{is a direct}} relationship between a fuse's cold resistance and its voltage drop value. Once current is applied, resistance and voltage drop of a fuse will constantly grow {{with the rise of}} its operating temperature until the fuse finally reaches thermal equilibrium. The voltage drop should be taken into account, particularly when using a fuse in low-voltage applications. Voltage drop often is not significant in more traditional wire type fuses, but can be significant in other technologies such as resettable (PPTC) type fuses.|$|E
25|$|Under {{short-circuit}} conditions, {{the calculated}} maximum prospective short-circuit current may be {{many times the}} normal, <b>rated</b> <b>current</b> of the circuit. When electrical contacts open to interrupt a large current, {{there is a tendency}} for an arc to form between the opened contacts, which would allow the current to continue. This condition can create conductive ionized gases and molten or vaporized metal, which can cause further continuation of the arc, or creation of additional short circuits, potentially resulting in the explosion of the circuit breaker and the equipment that it is installed in. Therefore, circuit breakers must incorporate various features to divide and extinguish the arc.|$|E
40|$|A {{fear about}} EMU {{was that in}} the absence of {{national}} currencies, country-specific shocks would result in greater current account divergences between member states. This paper finds that divergences across euro-area countries are smaller and have not risen relative to those across 13 other advanced economies with more flexible exchange rates. Also, the size of country-specific current account shocks in EMU countries is smaller and their persistence is greater than in the other advanced economies.

25|$|An ammeter shunt is {{a special}} type of current-sensing resistor, having four {{terminals}} and a value in milliohms or even micro-ohms. Current-measuring instruments, by themselves, can usually accept only limited currents. To measure high currents, the current passes through the shunt across which the voltage drop is measured and interpreted as current. A typical shunt consists of two solid metal blocks, sometimes brass, mounted on an insulating base. Between the blocks, and soldered or brazed to them, are one or more strips of low {{temperature coefficient of resistance}} (TCR) manganin alloy. Large bolts threaded into the blocks make the current connections, while much smaller screws provide volt meter connections. Shunts are rated by full-scale current, and often have a voltage drop of 50 mV at <b>rated</b> <b>current.</b> Such meters are adapted to the shunt full current rating by using an appropriately marked dial face; no change need to be made to the other parts of the meter.|$|E
2500|$|There are {{two groups}} of devices. G (general use) {{instantaneous}} RCDs have no intentional time delay.

They are typically used at the origin of an installation for fire protection to discriminate withGdevices at the loads, and in circuits containing surge suppressors. They must not trip at one-half of <b>rated</b> <b>current.</b> They provide at least 130 milliseconds delay of tripping at <b>rated</b> <b>current,</b> 60 milliseconds at twice rated, and 50 milliseconds at five times rated.
