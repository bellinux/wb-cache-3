5|$|At {{the end of}} the <b>regular</b> <b>season,</b> {{the team}} which has the most points is awarded the title of <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> champion. The league in the past {{generally}} takes a several week break between the <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> and postseason. As with the <b>regular</b> <b>season,</b> the format of the playoffs has varied from year to year. In the 2009–10 season the top four teams advanced to the playoffs and play two best-of-five rounds. The league scheduled {{the end of the}} <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> and postseason around the Olympic break. In each round the higher ranked team from the <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> will receive a home-ice advantage and the series will begin play and have the majority of games play in their rink.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the last}} <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> {{game for the}} Kings and {{the last day of}} the 2014–2015 NHL <b>regular</b> <b>season,</b> Regehr {{announced}} that he would retire from professional hockey.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to leading {{the team in}} points both in the <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> and playoffs, Clarke also holds the records for the most appearances and most assists for the Flyers in both <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> and playoffs. Fellow Stanley Cup winner Barber has scored the most goals for the team with his 420 <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> and 53 playoff goals. Rick Tocchet spent the most time in the penalty box during the <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> for the Flyers, accruing 1,817 minutes in total, while Dave Schultz's 363 penalty minutes are the most by a Flyer in the playoffs.

5|$|A tie-breaker was {{necessary}} after both teams finished {{the season with}} identical win–loss records of 86–76. The Twins, who had won the <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> series against the Tigers, 11 games to 7, were thus awarded home field due to a rules change prior to the 2009 season. It was the third tie-breaker played in MLB from 2007–2009. It was also the second consecutive tiebreaker for the AL Central title after 2008, when the Chicago White Sox defeated the Twins to win the division. The tie-breaker is counted as the 163rd <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> game played by both teams and all events in the game are added to <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> statistics. This was the Twins' final <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> game at the Metrodome as the team moved to Target Field for the 2010 season. The tie-breaker was later named the Best Regular-Season Game of the Decade by Sports Illustrated.|$|E

5|$|Defensively, the Virginia Tech Hokies {{allowed an}} average of 308 yards per game and 18.4 points per game. During {{the last two games}} of the <b>regular</b> <b>season,</b> however, the Hokies {{permitted}} 34 points and 42 points to Rutgers and Virginia, respectively. The Virginia Tech defense was led by two strong performers in the defensive secondary. Safety Torrian Gray intercepted four passes during the <b>regular</b> <b>season,</b> returning one of the catches for a touchdown. He tied with cornerback William Yarborough for the most interceptions on the team during the <b>regular</b> <b>season.</b> Neither player was the team's leading tackler, however. That honor went to linebacker George DelRicco, who had 130 tackles during the <b>regular</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
5|$|During the {{challenge}} cup period, {{none of the}} leagues that played for the trophy had a formal playoff system to decide their respective champions; whichever team finished in first place after the <b>regular</b> <b>season</b> won the league title. A playoff would only be played if teams tied for first-place in their leagues {{at the end of}} the <b>regular</b> <b>season.</b> Challenge games were played until 1912 at any time during hockey season by challenges approved and/or ordered by the Stanley Cup trustees. In 1912, Cup trustees declared that it was only to be defended {{at the end of the}} champion team's <b>regular</b> <b>season.</b>|$|E
5|$|During {{the latter}} half of the 2003 college {{football}} season, Virginia Tech struggled. Following an 8–4 <b>regular</b> <b>season,</b> that saw the Hokies lose four of its last sixregular-season games, Tech accepted a bid to the 2003 Insight Bowl. Facing the Hokies were the California Golden Bears, who had gone 7–6 during the <b>regular</b> <b>season,</b> tying for third place in the Pacific-10 Conference.|$|E

5|$|Following the 1980 college {{football}} season, Virginia Tech {{was awarded a}} bid to the 1981 Peach Bowl {{as a reward for}} finishing 8–3 during the <b>regular</b> <b>season.</b> Facing Virginia Tech was a familiar post-season opponent—Miami—whom the Hokies had played in the 1966 Liberty Bowl.
