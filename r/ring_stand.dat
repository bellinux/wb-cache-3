50|$|There are {{two types}} of wire gauze used in chemistry: a {{normally}} woven wire gauze, and one with a white circle imprinted on it. The latter has a ceramic composite intended to aid in the dispersal in heat. The normal set-up is a square stand to which a support ring is attached. The wire gauze is centered on the <b>ring</b> <b>stand</b> as to allow the open flame to be in contact with it to a certain extent, depending on the desired heat. In the context of laboratory experimentation, the combination of the wire gauze plus the added ceramic composite greatly aids in the even dispersal of heat. This means that an object placed over this type of wire gauze will receive a more uniform heat from a Bunsen burner than the naked flame of it. This property is specially important in various chemical processes where precise, even heat dispersal is sought after, as a consistent heat is crucial for the successful maintenance of the chemical process intended. Because of this desired heat dispersal ability, wire gauze can also be used as a cooling surface for beakers, Erlenmeyers flasks or other vessels without damaging the supporting surface (workbench, tabletop, etc.)...|$|E

40|$|A simplemeansof graphicallydisplayingthe {{degree of}} radiocompound binding purity using a {{shielded}} G-M tube integrated with a rate meter and {{strip chart recorder}} is described. The in strument produces a permanent quality-control record and eliminates time-consuming radio chromatographic segment counting. Many departments of nuclear medicine now pre pare sterile and pyrogren-free radiopharmaceuticals from commercial kits or from reagents prepared in their own laboratories. As part of the quality-control program, an accurate, rapid, and simple chroma tography system is required to assess the radiopurity of these products. We have developed a rapid, simple, chromato graphic method for measuring purity of radiophar maceuticals that uses instrumentation commonly available in most radioisotope laboratories and costs less than $ 1, 000 if purchased new. EQUIPMENT AND METHODS The distribution of radioactivity along the chroma tographic paper strip is determined {{by means of a}} Geiger-Muller (G-M) tube and a rate meter [Picker, Model No. 624081 (10 K range increased to lOOK) ] and the results are recorded on a strip chart recorder (Picker, Model No. PRR- 600 -O 90) (Fig. I). The G-M detector is shielded externally by a lead sleeve with a narrow slit opening (3 x I 1 mm) located over the front and center of the G-M detector (Fig. 2 A), which is mounted with lead shield on a <b>ring</b> <b>stand</b> 4 in. above the front of the strip chart recorder. A small stainless steel rod is connected to the <b>ring</b> <b>stand</b> 9 in. above the G-M tube to support the chro matography paper. In order to maintain the position of the chromatography strip as it passes over the slit window, a Lucite strip guide is placed {{on the front of the}} lead sleeve (Fig. 2 B). The lower end of the chromatographic strip is attached to the chart paper which pulls the strip across the front of the G-M tube at a constant speed. Output from the G-M tube is measured by the rate meter and its output recorded on the paper chart, proportional to the counting rate meter level...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{experiments}} and numerical modeling by {{faculty and students}} at CWU have shown that resonance frequencies of a spherical aluminum shell (radius 3. 0 in, thickness 1 / 8 inch) exhibit small shifts when different pressures are applied to the fluid inside. Further investigation {{is needed to determine}} whether this phenomenon can be exploited as part of a noninvasive method for monitoring intracranial pressure. The goal of the present study is to modify the experimental apparatus and procedure to more closely resemble clinical conditions and to acquire reliable resonance measurements. In previous experiments, the shell was suspended from elastic cords and the pressure was varied from 0 to 120 psig in steps of 10 psi. In the modified apparatus, we let the sphere rest on a support system, such as a <b>ring</b> <b>stand,</b> and the target pressure range is 0 to. 5 psig in steps of 0. 05 psi. Both modifications presented significant challenges: supporting the shell necessarily interferes with the vibrational response, and small pressure changes produce very small resonance frequency shifts that are difficult to detect. We present results comparing the efficacy of different support systems and preliminary results for detecting small frequency shifts...|$|E

40|$|In this article, {{the author}} {{describes}} a low-cost, portable and flexible Sensor Configuration Unit (SCU) design {{for use in}} engineering measurements with various sensors. The unit consists of a sturdy <b>ring</b> <b>stand,</b> a plate with holes to hold various sensors, and a bracket fastened to the plate to hold the signal conditioning unit of the sensors and provide the input output connections. This puts the sensor to be used and its signal conditioning unit into a single central unit. The output from the sensor {{is connected to the}} measurements hardware and, more preferably, the computer data acquisition hardware, through the BNC connectors on the bracket. The set-up is very portable and has a minimal footprint on the experiment workbench. It eliminates the problems of many wires scattered around the workbench during experiments. The exchange of different sensors in the unit is easily carried out and enables purchasing standalone sensors for different engineering measurements applications for existing measurement hardware, instead of buying much more expensive all-in-one measurement units. This set-up is especially useful to an undergraduate measurement and instrumentation class in small size engineering programmes with limited budgets...|$|E
40|$|Whole-cell patch-clamp {{recordings}} provide exceptional {{access to}} spiking and synaptic neural activity. This method {{has been applied}} to neurons in the central nervous system of Drosophila and allows researchers the opportunity to study the function of their neurons of interest within the context of native circuits in a genetically tractable model system. In this protocol, we describe the technique for in vivo whole-cell patch-clamp recordings in a preparation which exposes neurons in the fly brain. We also offer technical suggestions and discuss some of the challenges encountered in recording from single neurons in the fly brain. Neurons are patched following routine recording protocols for wholecell patch clamp. At the physiology rig, additional cleaning of the brain is performed to allow easy access to the neurons, and the cells can be filled with a diffusible dye during recordings, to examine the morphology of the recorded cell post hoc. In the electrophysiology rig used for Drosophila patch-clamp recordings, the microscope stage has been removed, so that the recording platform instead rests on a <b>ring</b> <b>stand</b> support that is magnetically fixed to the table. Manipulators and stimulus delivery are also in fixed locations, whereas the microscope sits on an x-y translation stage. © 2013 Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press...|$|E

Adjust the pH to 7. 0 with 5 N NaOH. Bring {{the volume of the}} solution to 100 ml with deionised water and sterilize it by autoclaving it for 20 minutes at 15 psi. ### Procedure **Isolation of Plasmid DNA** 1. Pick up a colony of bacteria and inoculate it in a conical flask containing 100 ml autoclaved Luria broth media supplemented with antibiotic (Ampicillin 100 µg/ml) and incubate overnight in a 37 °C shaking water bath at 250 rpm. - Pour the culture in a 2. 0 ml centrifuge tube and centrifuge at 5000 rpm for 20 minutes. - Discard the supernatant and wash the pellet in 1. 0 ml double distilled water. - Discard the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 250 µl cold alkaline solution I (stored at 4 °C). Mix properly so that the pellet dissolves. - Add 20 mg of lysozyme in the above solution and mix well. Allow it to incubate on ice for 15 minutes. - Add 500 µl of alkaline solution II and mix properly. Mix the solution by flicking. - Now add 250 µl of alkaline solution III and incubate it on ice for 15 minutes. - Centrifuge the sample at 5000 rpm for 10 minutes and filter the supernatant into an autoclaved 2. 0 ml centrifuge tube. - Fill the tube with the same amount of ice-cold isopropyl alcohol (stored at- 20 °C) and incubate in cold (- 20 °C) for 30 minutes. - Centrifuge the sample at 5000 rpm for 15 minutes. Discard the supernatant and air dry the pellet. - Resuspend the pellet in 500 µl TE buffer. **Purification of Plasmid DNA using Cesium Chloride** 1. When the pellet is suspended completely, measure the mass of plasmid DNA by using a balance. For every gram of plasmid DNA solution, add 1. 0 gm of solid cesium chloride. Warm the solution at 30 °C to dissolve the CsCl salt. - Add 5 µl of 10 mg/ml ethidium bromide to the above plasmid DNA solution. - Centrifuge the sample at 50, 000 rpm for 10 - 15 hours at 20 °C in an ultracentrifuge. - After the first run is complete remove the tube carefully and place it in the clamp and insert a needle just below the band. Remove the cap on the tube and pull out the band with the help of needle and syringe. - Place the sample in another ultra centrifuge tube and fill the tube with a solution of cesium chloride and TE. Spin at 50, 000 rpm for 5 hours. - When the run is complete follow the above instructions for removing the bands. - Place the bands in a centrifuge tube and add equal volumes of TE and mix well. Now add isoamyl alcohol twice the volume of sample in the tube. Shake well and allow the phases to separate. - Pipet off the top pink layer and repeat the extraction with isoamyl alcohol until the top layer is clear and transparent. **Dialysis of Plasmid DNA** 1. Prepare pieces of dialysis tubing by rinsing very well in autoclaved distilled water. Tie one end of the tube and carefully suspend he extracted plasmid DNA band into the tubing. Tie the other end too and place the sample in dialysis buffer. - Dialyze for at least 6 hours at 4 °C using a magnetic stirrer. Repeat the process in new buffer solution. - Once the dialysis is complete, remove the liquid from the tubing and transfer it into another tube. - Add 1 / 10 volume of 5 M NaCl and twice the volume of pure ethanol. - Centrifuge the samples for 20 minutes at 5000 rpm at 4 °C. - Discard the supernatant, leaving the pellet. - Rinse with 95 % Ethanol and resuspend the pellet in 100 μl of TE buffer (pH 8. 0) or autoclaved distilled water.
