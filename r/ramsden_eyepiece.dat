5000|$|The {{telescope}} is focused correctly for viewing objects at the distance {{for which the}} angular magnification is to be determined and then the object glass is used as an object the image of which {{is known as the}} exit pupil. The diameter of this may be measured using an instrument known as a Ramsden dynameter which consists of a <b>Ramsden</b> <b>eyepiece</b> with micrometer hairs in the back focal plane. This is mounted in front of the telescope eyepiece and used to evaluate the diameter of the exit pupil. This will be much smaller than the object glass diameter, which gives the linear magnification (actually a reduction), the angular magnification can be determined from ...|$|E
50|$|The <b>Ramsden</b> <b>eyepiece</b> {{comprises}} two plano-convex {{lenses of}} the same glass and similar focal lengths, placed less than one eye-lens focal length apart, a design created by astronomical and scientific instrument maker Jesse Ramsden in 1782. The lens separation varies between different designs, but is typically somewhere between 7/10 and 7/8 of the focal length of the eye-lens, the choice being a trade off between residual transverse chromatic aberration (at low values) and at high values running {{the risk of the}} field lens touching the focal plane when used by an observer who works with a close virtual image such as a myopic observer, or a young person whose accommodation is able to cope with a close virtual image (this is a serious problem when used with a micrometer as it can result in damage to the instrument).|$|E
40|$|Extract] Before {{reading this}} book (Figure 1), my only {{knowledge}} about Jesse Ramsden {{was that he}} was the inventor of the <b>Ramsden</b> <b>eyepiece.</b> Dr McConnell's excellent biography of the man shows that there was much more. She quotes extensively from documents written by his contemporaries to show that they considered him the finest instrument-maker of his time. It was recognized that not only were the instruments constructed extremely well, but that they often showed innovation of design which in one case would lead the Royal Society to award him the Copley Medal...|$|E
50|$|In some {{eyepiece}} types, such as <b>Ramsden</b> <b>eyepieces</b> (described in {{more detail}} below), the eyepiece behaves as a magnifier, and its focal plane is located outside of the eyepiece {{in front of the}} field lens. This plane is therefore accessible as a location for a graticule or micrometer crosswires. In the Huygenian eyepiece, the focal plane is located between the eye and field lenses, inside the eyepiece, and is hence not accessible.|$|R
5000|$|In a Kellner {{eyepiece}} an achromatic doublet is used {{in place}} of the simple plano-convex eye lens in the Ramsden design to correct the residual transverse chromatic aberration. Carl Kellner designed this first modern achromatic eyepiece in 1849, also called an [...] "achromatized Ramsden". Kellner eyepieces are a 3-lens design. They are inexpensive and have fairly good image from low to medium power and are far superior to Huygenian or Ramsden design. The eye relief is better than the Huygenian and worse than the <b>Ramsden</b> <b>eyepieces.</b> The biggest problem of Kellner eyepieces was internal reflections. Today's anti-reflection coatings make these usable, economical choices for small to medium aperture telescopes with focal ratio f/6 or longer. The typical apparent field of view is 40-50Â°.|$|R
40|$|We {{describe}} {{the results obtained}} with a light asher placed on a 10 metre high mound, {{at a distance of}} 1. 0 km from the Cangaroo II 10 metre gamma ray telescope, giving a light pool of 7 m diameter. The asher contains an ultrabright blue (= 460 nm) LED type Nichia (NSPB 510 S), which has a temperature stable light output and a risetime of 1 ns. The asher can be operated at 10 ns and 20 ns pulse widths and rates of 30 Hz, 1000 Hz or continuously, from a battery-powered pulse generator to calibrate and test the telescope data acquisition system. The brightness can be controlled by neutral density lters or collimators. The asher is pointed using a <b>Ramsden</b> <b>eyepiece</b> tted with cross-hairs. Since April 1999, the 10 metre Cangaroo II imaging atmospheric Cerenkov gamma ray telescope has operated at G-Range, Woomera, South Australia, at latitude and longitude, 31. 1 S, 136. 8 E, and 165 m altitude. It is tted with a 552 pixel camera at 8 metre focal length [1]. We regularly mo [...] ...|$|E
