2500|$|A widely {{accepted}} hypothesis for {{the evolution of}} genomic imprinting is the [...] "parental conflict hypothesis." [...] Also known as the kinship theory of genomic imprinting, this hypothesis states that the inequality between parental genomes due to imprinting {{is a result of the}} differing interests of each parent in terms of the evolutionary fitness of their genes. The father's genes that encode for imprinting gain greater fitness through the success of the offspring, at the expense of the mother. The mother's evolutionary imperative is often to conserve resources for her own survival while providing sufficient nourishment to current and subsequent litters. Accordingly, paternally expressed genes tend to be growth-promoting whereas maternally expressed genes tend to be growth-limiting. In support of this hypothesis, genomic imprinting has been found in all placental mammals, where post-fertilisation offspring resource consumption at the expense of the mother is high; although it has also been found in oviparous birds where there is relatively little post-fertilisation <b>resource</b> <b>transfer</b> and therefore less parental conflict.|$|E

5000|$|The {{growth of}} climate change finance: Recent years have {{witnessed}} {{a growing number of}} financial flows and development of financing mechanisms in the climate change arena. The 2010 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Cancun, Mexico has committed significant amount of money from developed countries to developing world in supportive of the adaptation and mitigation technologies. In short terms, the fast start finance will be transferred through variety channels including bilateral and multilateral official development assistance, the Global Environment Facility and the UNFCCC. Besides, a growing number of public funds have provided greater incentives to tackle climate change in developing countries. For instance, the Pilot Program for Climate Resilience aims at creating an integrated and scaled-up approach {{of climate change}} adaptation in some low-income countries and preparing for future finance flows. In addition, climate change finance in developing countries could potentially change the traditional aid mechanisms, through the differential interpretations of ‘common but differentiated responsibilities’ by developing and developed countries. On the basis of equity and climate justice, climate change resource flows are increasingly called on developed world according to the culpability for damages. As a result, it is inevitable to change the governance structures so as for developing countries to break the traditional donor-recipient relationships. Within these contexts, the understanding of the political economy processes of financial flows in climate change arena would be crucial to effectively governing the <b>resource</b> <b>transfer</b> and to tackling the climate change.|$|E
