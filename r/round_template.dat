40|$|Physical health investigations, such {{as blood}} tests, ECGs, and {{appropriate}} radiological tests, are essential {{in the assessment}} and management of many patients in inpatient mental health settings. This project {{took place in a}} 12 -bed adolescent mental health unit in Swindon, UK, where on average at least two-thirds of patients have a diagnosed eating disorder. Multidisciplinary ward rounds provide an appropriate setting for discussion and documentation of physical investigations. Over a two-week period, 22 electronic ward round entries were audited for any documentation of five common investigations- blood tests, ECG, MRI head, DEXA, and ovarian ultrasound. Blood tests were documented in 2 / 22 (9. 1 %), ECG, MRI head, DEXA, and ovarian ultrasound were documented in 0 / 22 (0 %). Modifications were made to an electronic ward <b>round</b> <b>template,</b> to include headings for each of these investigations, with free-text boxes as well as drop-down boxes for the radiological tests. Following this, re-audit of 22 ward round entries over a two-week period showed documentation had hugely improved-blood tests were documented in 21 / 22 (95. 5 %), with ECG, MRI head, DEXA, and pelvis US all documented in 22 / 22 (100 %). A further audit a month later showed these results were largely sustained. In conclusion, use of a simple, structured ward <b>round</b> <b>template</b> can hugely improve documentation of important physical investigations within mental health settings.

25|$|Directed {{evolution}} is a mimic {{of the natural}} evolution cycle in a laboratory setting. Evolution requires three things to happen: variation between replicators, that the variation causes fitness differences upon which selection acts, and that this variation is heritable. In DE, a single gene is evolved by iterative rounds of mutagenesis, selection or screening, and amplification. Rounds of these steps are typically repeated, using the best variant from one <b>round</b> as the <b>template</b> for the next to achieve stepwise improvements.|$|R
50|$|Bankrupt - The black Bankrupt space ended a player's {{turn and}} {{resulted}} {{the loss of}} all money earned. Any money that was secured by solving a puzzle was immune to Bankrupt (except from 1996-1998, when securing money {{was not an option}} after the show's 1996 revamp). From 1981 to 1996, the Bankrupt space would appear once in round 1, and twice in rounds 2 and 3. From July 1996 onwards, the number of Bankrupt spaces in round 2 (and round 3 with the second Bankrupt appearing in round 4 for a brief period in 1996) was reduced to one. When the 4-round format was re-introduced in 1999, an additional Bankrupt was added to the existing <b>round</b> 2 <b>template</b> for use in round 3, thus making it one Bankrupt space each in rounds 1 and 2, and two each in rounds 3 and 4.|$|R
40|$|High {{mobility}} group proteins 1 and 2 (HMGs 1 and 2) {{are abundant}} chromosomal proteins of higher eukaryotes, {{which have been}} found to be enriched in regions of active chromatin. We have previously demonstrated that they can stimulate specific transcription in vitro by RNA polymerases II and III and overcome inhibition caused by added histones. Here we study whether these effects are mediated at the level of initiation or elongation of transcription. Additions of HMGs 1 and 2 and/or histones were found to have only small or no effect on the efficiency of elongation; this was determined by comparing the relative synthesis of transcripts of different lengths, ranging from 95 to 1535 bases. The observed stimulation cannot be explained by an increased utilization of initiation complexes for multiple rounds of transcription as a similar level of stimulation by HMGs 1 and 2 was seen when RNA synthesis was limited to one <b>round</b> per <b>template</b> DNA by addition of a low level of Sarkosyl after formation of initiation complexes. The effects of HMGs 1 and 2 were principally seen on the rate of formation of effective initiation complexes. These data are consistent with the hypothesis that HMGs 1 and 2 stimulate transcription by facilitating the formation of active initiation complexes on template DNA...|$|R
30|$|To {{apply this}} method, an {{automatic}} round lips detector {{is necessary to}} select round lips from the image sequence which contains all kinds of lips shapes. A similar method with closed lips filter in the above section is applied to detect round lips. Firstly, a <b>round</b> lips DCT <b>template</b> is trained from several round lips images. DCT coefficients are calculated from lips ROI. Secondly, this template scans through all the images, and {{the distance between the}} current image and template is computed. Lips are considered as round lips if its distance is less than a threshold which is determined experimentally. The performance of the automatic round lips detector is evaluated on 3184 lips images (10 repetitions of the first speaker). Only 42 round lips are mistaken among 467 round lips images (about 9 % error rate).|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Amplification of {{single-stranded}} DNA circles has wide utility for {{a variety}} of applications. The two-primer ramified rolling circle amplification (RAM) reaction provides exponential DNA amplification under isothermal conditions, creating a regular laddered series of double-stranded DNA products. However, the molecular mechanism of the RAM reaction remains unexplained. Results A RAM reaction model predicts exponential accumulation of a double-stranded DNA product size series, and product-size ratios, that are consistent with observed RAM reaction products. The mechanism involves generation of a series of increasing size intermediate templates; those templates produce RAM products and recursively generate smaller intermediate templates. The model allows prediction of the number of <b>rounds</b> of circular <b>template</b> replication. Real-time RAM reaction data are consistent with the model. Analysis of RAM reaction products shows exponential growth limitation consistent with the model's predictions. Conclusions The model provides a rationale for the observed products of the RAM reaction, and the molecular yield among those products. Experimental results are consistent with the model. </p...|$|R
30|$|Needles were {{collected}} from two sites in January 2014 (both on Long Mile Road, Rotorua, New Zealand) for direct testing {{for the presence of}} C. minus using the MOTU-specific primers. Each sample contained two fascicles from a tree that was chosen based on the existence of characteristic symptoms of CNC (yellow mottling and easily detached needles). From the first sample site, 7 samples {{were collected}} from individual trees and from the second site, a further 11 samples {{were collected from}} individual trees. The needles were frozen overnight at − 20  °C then freeze-dried for 24 – 48  h. Whole needles were ground to a fine powder using liquid nitrogen and a mortar and pestle. The DNA was extracted using a modified method (Stöger and Ruppitsch 2004) with the Extract-N-Amp PCR ReadyMix kit (Sigma-Aldrich, MO, USA). RedExtract-N-Amp™ extraction buffer (400  μL) was added to the powdered needles, and the tubes were vortexed for 20  s and then incubated at 90  °C for 30  min. The RedExtract-N-Amp™ dilution buffer was added (400  μL), and the tube was vortexed again for 20  s. The extracts were then diluted 1 : 10 (in a 1 : 1 ratio of extraction:dilution buffers as the diluent), and 5  μL of the diluted extracts were used per PCR reaction (Stöger and Ruppitsch 2004). PCR was performed using the RedExtract-N-Amp™ PCR ReadyMix, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. A second round of PCR using the KAPA 2 G Robust HotStart Readymix (2 ×) was performed using the first <b>round</b> as <b>template</b> due to the possibility of low fungal DNA titre.|$|R
40|$|HLA-A 2 is {{the most}} {{frequent}} HLA-A allele in all ethnic populations, and an important restriction element for peptide presentation to T cells in infectious disease and cancer. However, the HLA-A 2 supertype consisting of up to 75 subtypes, mutation studies and analyses using cytotoxic T lymphocytes suggest the functional relevance of subtype-specific differences in HLA-A 2 molecules for peptide binding and T-cell recognition. Therefore, {{it is necessary for}} T-cell response study to discriminate the HLA-A 2 subtypes and to understand the profile of HLA-A 2 allelic distribution in a given population. In this study, we developed a simple, robust approach based on the nested polymerase chain reaction using sequence-specific primers (PCR-SSP) to discriminate 17 HLA-A 2 subtypes which cover the most HLA-A 2 alleles (> 99 % allele frequency) reported in Chinese, using 15 combinations of 19 allelic specific primers. In the first round of PCR, 3 combinations of 5 primers were used to determine whether the tested sample was HLA-A 2 positive, meanwhile the subtypes of HLA-A* 0209 and HLA-A* 0215 N were determined for the variant position of these two subtypes is in exon 4 instead of exon 2, 3. Samples of HLA-A 2 positive were subtyped {{in the second round of}} PCR, using PCR products of the first <b>round</b> as <b>templates.</b> This strategy was applied to test the samples of 78 random HLA-A 2 positive individuals for their HLA-A 2 subtypes. Those samples were screened for HLA-A 2 positive by the first round PCR-SSP from 154 healthy blood donors in Wuhan, China. The subtyping results were verified by using flow cytometric analysis (FCM) with HLA-A 2 specific monoclona...|$|R
40|$|Telomerase copies its {{internal}} RNA template to synthesize telomeric DNA repeats. Unlike other polymerases, telomerase can retain its single-stranded product through multiple <b>rounds</b> of <b>template</b> dissociation and repositioning to accomplish repeat addition processivity (RAP). Tetrahymena telomerase holoenzyme RAP {{depends on a}} subunit, Teb 1, with autonomous DNA-binding activity. Sequence homology and domain modeling suggest that Teb 1 is a paralog of RPA 70 C, the largest subunit of the single-stranded DNA-binding factor replication protein (RPA), but unlike RPA, Teb 1 binds DNA with high specificity for telomeric repeats. To understand the structural basis and significance of telomeric-repeat DNA recognition by Teb 1, we solved crystal structures of three proposed Teb 1 DNA-binding domains and defined amino acids of each domain that contribute to DNA interaction. Our studies indicate that two central Teb 1 DNA-binding oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding-fold domains, Teb 1 A and Teb 1 B, achieve high affinity and selectivity of telomeric-repeat recognition by principles similar to the telomere end-capping protein POT 1 (protection of telomeres 1). An additional C-terminal Teb 1 oligonucleotide/oligosaccharide-binding-fold domain, Teb 1 C, has features shared with the RPA 70 C-terminal domain including a putative direct DNA-binding surface that is critical for high-RAP activity of reconstituted holoenzyme. The Teb 1 C zinc ribbon motif does not contribute to DNA binding but is nonetheless required for high-RAP activity, perhaps contributing to Teb 1 physical association with {{the remainder of the}} holoenzyme. Our results suggest the biological model that high-affinity DNA binding by Teb 1 AB recruits holoenzyme to telomeres and subsequent Teb 1 C–DNA association traps product in a sliding-clamp-like manner that does not require high-affinity DNA binding for high stability of enzyme-product association...|$|R
40|$|Electrical {{energy storage}} {{solutions}} with significantly higher gravimetric and volumetric energy densities and rapid response rates {{are needed to}} balance the highly dynamic, time-variant supply and demand for power. Nanoengineering can provide useful structures for electrical energy storage because it offers the potential to increase efficiency, reduce size/weight, and improve performance. While several nanostructured devices have shown improvements in energy and/or power densities, this dissertation focuses on the nanoengineering of electrostatic capacitors (ESC) and application of these high-power electrostatic capacitors in electrical energy storage systems. A porous nano-template with significant area enhancement per planar unit area coated with ultra-thin metal-insulator-metal (MIM) layers has shown significant improvements in areal capacitance. However, sharp asperities inherent to the initial nano-template localized electric fields and caused premature (low field) breakdown, limiting the possible energy density (E = ½ CV 2 /m). A nanoengineering strategy was identified for <b>rounding</b> the <b>template</b> asperities, and this showed {{a significant increase in}} the electrical breakdown strength of the device, providing rapid charging and discharging and an energy density of 1. 5 W-h/kg - which compares favorably with the best state-of-the-art devices that provide 0. 7 W-h/kg. The combination of the high-power ESC with a complementary high-energy-density electrochemical capacitor (ECC) was modeled to evaluate methods resulting in the combined power-energy storage capabilities. While significant improvements in the ESC's energy density were reported, the nanodevices display nonlinear leakage resistance, which directly relates to charge retention. The ECC has distinctly different nonlinearities, but can retain a greater density of charge for significantly longer, albeit with slower inherent charging and discharging rates than the ESC. The experimentally derived dynamic model simulating the nonlinear performance of the ESC and ECC devices indicated this hybrid-circuit reduces the time required to charge the ECC to near-maximum capacity by a factor of up to ~ 12...|$|R
5000|$|The DNA {{sample is}} divided into four {{separate}} sequencing reactions, containing {{all four of the}} standard deoxynucleotides (dATP, dGTP, dCTP and dTTP) and the DNA polymerase. To each reaction is added only one of the four dideoxynucleotides (ddATP, ddGTP, ddCTP, or ddTTP), while the other added nucleotides are ordinary ones. The dideoxynucleotide is added to be approximately 100-fold lower in concentration than the corresponding deoxynucleotide (e.g. 0.005mM ddATP : 0.5mM dATP) allowing for enough fragments to be produced while still transcribing the complete sequence. [...] Putting it in a more sensible order, four separate reactions are needed in this process to test all four ddNTPs. Following <b>rounds</b> of <b>template</b> DNA extension from the bound primer, the resulting DNA fragments are heat denatured and separated by size using gel electrophoresis. In the original publication of 1977, the formation of base-paired loops of ssDNA was a cause of serious difficulty in resolving bands at some locations. This is frequently performed using a denaturing polyacrylamide-urea gel with each of the four reactions run in one of four individual lanes (lanes A, T, G, C). The DNA bands may then be visualized by autoradiography or UV light and the DNA sequence can be directly read off the X-ray film or gel image. [...] In the image on the right, X-ray film was exposed to the gel, and the dark bands correspond to DNA fragments of different lengths. A dark band in a lane indicates a DNA fragment that is the result of chain termination after incorporation of a dideoxynucleotide (ddATP, ddGTP, ddCTP, or ddTTP). The relative positions of the different bands among the four lanes, from bottom to top, are then used to read the DNA sequence.|$|R
30|$|Once an RNA {{template}} {{has been}} copied, {{the strands of}} the resulting duplex must be separated {{to allow for the}} next <b>round</b> of <b>template</b> copying. Strand separation could occur during transient high-temperature excursions, resulting from entrainment in the hot water emanating from a lacustrine hydrothermal vent, followed by rapid thermal quenching as the hot effluent mixes with surrounding cold lake or pond water [66, 67]. However, the decreasing temperature will initiate strand reannealing, which competes with template copying. The rate of strand reannealing is second order with respect to strand concentration, so this process can in principle be slowed arbitrarily by dilution. In PCR reactions, strand reannealing generally limits product strand concentration to about 1 μM; above that concentration, reannealing is faster than primer binding and enzymatic copying, which occur in seconds. The problem is much more severe for chemical replication, which may take hours to days. Unless chemical replication can be drastically speeded up, the maximum feasible strand concentration will be on the order of 1 nM. This might not be a problem for templates replicating in free solution, where the primary selection would be for optimal template structure. However, it is a major concern for vesicle-encapsulated templates, where strand concentrations of ~ 1 nM correspond to only a few molecules in a vesicle of 3 - 4 micrometers diameter. At such a low concentration, {{it is hard to imagine}} a primitive metabolic ribozyme being able to generate enough of any useful product to have a selectively advantageous effect. For example, the presence of phospholipids in a fatty acid based membrane confers a growth advantage over vesicles that do not contain phospholipids, so a ribozyme that could generate phospholipids could confer a very strong selective advantage [27]. However, for a ribozyme at 1 nM to generate 1 mM of phospholipid (a reasonable local concentration) would require 106 turnovers; for this to occur in the course of a day (~ 105 s) would require a kcat of 10 s- 1, which is not inconceivable but which is unlikely for a primordial, (i.e., unoptimized) ribozyme. On the other hand, if strand concentrations could approach 1 μM, a much lower and more reasonable turnover number and kcat would suffice to confer a selectable effect - but this would require some means of slowing down strand reannealing so as to allow replication to continue at such concentrations. Alternatively a very small selective advantage acting over a long period of time might be sufficient to lead to ribozyme optimization.|$|R
