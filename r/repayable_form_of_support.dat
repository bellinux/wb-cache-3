To this have been analyzed all possible <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> on Pillar I and of which Romanian producers have benefited after 2007, without reference to irregular <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> or to the state aid. Analysis <b>of</b> <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> we revealed the following: although the financial support has significant value, the transitional payments for processing tomatoes has not been caused a massive migration of producers of fresh tomato to the industrial tomatoes culture; this <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> caused a specialization of vegetables producers, many of whom are beneficiaries <b>of</b> this <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> from the implementation of the scheme to this moment; increasing the number of the legal entity created by producers, specialized on marketing of fruit and vegetables; increase of the fruit and vegetables surfaces whose production is in at least 75 % sold through specialized marketing associative forms...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{dissertation}} was {{to better understand the}} concept <b>of</b> celebratory <b>support.</b> This <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> is different from comforting messages and most other <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> social <b>support,</b> which typically focus on trying to help people who are feeling bad to feel better; celebratory support aims to enhance the already positive feelings of someone who has received some kind of good news. In order to enhance understanding <b>of</b> this unique <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> this dissertation (a) reviewed the literature relevant to this <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> (b) presented detailed conceptualization <b>of</b> celebratory <b>support,</b> and (c) described four different types of 2 ̆ 2 good news 2 ̆ 2 that often merit a celebratory response. Two studies were presented in this dissertation. Study 1 identified effective features <b>of</b> general celebratory <b>support</b> messages as well as some important contextual variations in better and worse <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> these message features. Study 2 identified effective features <b>of</b> context-specific celebratory <b>support</b> messages. Additionally, both studies also were able to hypothesis and test various mechanisms by which each set of features “work”. ...|$|R

40|$|Stability {{and change}} {{in the use of}} formal and {{informal}} social support was assessed over a three year period among a representative sample of 1855 elderly urban participants in a longitudinal study of aging and health. Whether people received informal, formal, both types <b>of</b> <b>support</b> or no support was determined in baseline, 12 and 24 month personal interviews. Most respondents retained the same <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> across all three interviews. The extent of stability or change varied according to the <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> reported at baseline. Two-thirds of those with no social support continued without support and 40 % of those using both informal and formal support continued to do so at subsequent assessments. The substitution of formal for informal support was infrequent and not statistically significant. Pair wise discriminant function analyses of groups of respondents with the most frequent longitudinal support patterns were performed to identify baseline health and social characteristics associated with stable use, the addition <b>of</b> another <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> or change to nonuse, over time. Changes in the use <b>of</b> <b>support</b> were influenced more by initial levels of health and functional status than by social and economic circumstances. Larger proportions of respondents dropped use <b>of</b> <b>support</b> then added an additional <b>form</b> <b>of</b> <b>support.</b> Respondents using both formal and informal support at baseline died across time in higher proportions than those in other support categories. The extent <b>of</b> stability in <b>support</b> use and nonuse, the character <b>of</b> changes in <b>support</b> use across time and greater attrition among those who were the heaviest users <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> serve to create a relative balance in the use of informal and formal support in this aging cohort, at least over the time frame over which respondents were followed in this study. stability over time substitution of formal for informal care attrition greater among heaviest users <b>of</b> <b>support...</b>|$|R

Unlike much of the previous research, this qualitative study argues that family support is not a question of simple acceptance or rejection, but is instead a complex combination <b>of</b> multiple <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>support,</b> that can be lost or sustained for a multitude of reasons. Emerging adulthood is applied to show the benefits <b>of</b> family <b>support</b> during this life-stage, as well as to show the complexity <b>of</b> family <b>support.</b> This article identifies four main <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> family support: financial support, emotional support, romantic support, and social relationship support. Through analysis, this study shows that these <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> can function independent of one another, and need to be studied in such a manner. Another aim is to show the need for taking the entire coming out process into analysis, and not to treat it as a single disclosure event. Examples are provided on how different steps of the coming out process affect different <b>forms</b> <b>of</b> <b>support</b> from these individual’s families. Many studies exist that show the effects that a lack <b>of</b> family <b>support</b> has for these individuals, but this work provides an understanding to the complex ways in which family support can be lost...|$|R
