5|$|In {{the near}} future, weapons master James McCullen (Christopher Eccleston) {{has created a}} nanotech-based weapon – nanomites {{designed}} to devour metal and other materials, capable of destroying anything from tanks to cities. The nanobots can only be stopped by activating the kill switch. His company M.A.R.S. sells four warheads to NATO, and NATO troops led by American soldiers Duke (Channing Tatum) and <b>Ripcord</b> (Marlon Wayans) are asked to deliver the warheads. Their convoy is ambushed by the Baroness (Sienna Miller), whom Duke recognizes to be his ex-fiancee Ana Lewis. Duke and <b>Ripcord</b> are rescued by Scarlett (Rachel Nichols), Snake Eyes (Ray Park), Breaker (Saïd Taghmaoui), and Heavy Duty (Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje). They take the warheads to The Pit, G.I. Joe's command center in Egypt, and upon arriving, rendezvous {{with the head of}} the G.I. Joe Team, General Hawk (Dennis Quaid). Hawk takes command of the warheads and excuses Duke and <b>Ripcord,</b> only to be convinced to let them join his group, after Duke reveals that he knows the Baroness.|$|E
5|$|Several {{publications}} rated Rounds {{as one of}} {{the best}} albums of the decade, with Pitchfork placing it at number 123 on their list of the top 200 albums of the 2000s. On similar lists, Drowned in Sound placed it at number 13, One Thirty BPM placed it at number 99, and No <b>Ripcord</b> at number 48.

5|$|The Joes {{locate the}} secret base and fly there, as McCullen loads three {{missiles}} with nanowarheads, which are aimed for Beijing, Moscow, and Washington, DC, the world's {{three most important}} cities. He intends {{to do this to}} strike fear into the hearts of every man, woman, and child on the planet, after which they will turn to the person with the most power in the world, the President of the United States. After Snake Eyes takes out one missile, <b>Ripcord</b> destroys the remaining two by using a stolen M.A.R.S. prototype Night Raven jet, while Scarlett, Breaker, and Snake Eyes infiltrate the base. Snake Eyes duels and prevails over Storm Shadow. Duke learns that the Doctor is Rex Lewis, Ana's brother, believed to have been killed by a mistimed airstrike during a mission led by Duke (also the origin of the alienation between Duke and Ana). Rex had encountered Doctor Mindbender (Kevin J. O'Connor) in the bunker and was seduced by the nanomite technology, taking too long to retrieve the data and getting caught in the bombing, which disfigured him. After freeing Duke, the Baroness is subdued, as the Doctor reveals he has implanted her with nanomites, which has put her under his control for the past four years. Attempting to kill Duke, McCullen ends up being burned, so the Doctor and he flee to an escape vessel. Duke and the Baroness pursue him while the Joes fall back; when the Doctor activates the base's self-destruct sequence, which involves 'blowing the ice cap' to create blocks of ice which then nearly crush the Joes.|$|E

5000|$|Shooting jet {{pilots in}} their parachutes was {{justified}} {{by some as}} a necessary evil. It was believed that these pilots were a special elite and that training them to fly such aircraft was a protracted and expensive effort. This logic held that killing such men whenever possible could help shorten the war. For their part, many German pilots were so concerned about being attacked in their parachutes that they waited until they were at low altitude before pulling their <b>ripcords.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The album's unique {{recording}} context - {{its location}} and technique - was deemed a vital component of its sound, one described as [...] "evocative, moving and expressive". Tonally, melody [...] "tends to remain subordinate to texture", [...] meaning [...] "Hecker's {{music is not}} easy or accessible. There are hints of melody but these are always subservient to mood, texture and feeling. There {{is little or no}} percussion and rhythm is not a prominent element."

500|$|The {{influence}} of several contemporary bands was deemed apparent upon {{the sound of}} the album. Robin Jahdi writes that [...] "the Isis sound, debuted proper on the 2002 album, is still present and correct, but there's more subtle shifts in mood here, most interestingly when they take influence from outside (Tool's Adam Jones plays on two songs). The basslines bounce and jolt with that familiar elasticity, but the seismic six-string shifts on songs like 'Hand of the Host' and '20 Minutes / 40 Years' are the sort not heard from this band in years. It is no coincidence that these are highlights." [...] The rhythms of [...] "20 Minutes / 40 Years" [...] are described as [...] "Pelican-like" [...] by NME reviewer Ben Patashnik, and No <b>Ripcords</b> Sean Caldwell compares the album to Mastodon's Blood Mountain, citing its potential for [...] "crossover" [...] appeal.|$|R

500|$|According to The Independents Simmy Richman, The Ecstatics Eastern-influenced musical {{backdrop}} was {{reflective of}} Mos Def's [...] "post-War on Terror" [...] themes; Richman {{called it a}} conscious rap record, and No <b>Ripcords</b> Ryan Faughnder regarded the music as [...] "socially conscious alternative hip-hop". Mos Def incorporated a number of Islamic references onto the album, including samples of American Muslim activist Malcolm X, Turkish protest singer Selda Bağcan, and an Arab-language scene from the 1966 film The Battle of Algiers; additionally, the track [...] "Wahid" [...] was titled after the Arabic word for [...] "oneness".

5000|$|Adey {{released}} his critically well received debut album All Things Real in 2006 through independent record label Grand Harmonium Records. Music journalists often categorise his piano, vocal led songs as folk and singer-songwriter, but also acknowledge a harder, less generic, left of mainstream approach; No <b>Ripcords</b> Simon Briercliffe writes [...] "His voice is rich and carries on long after its comfortable, at times far louder {{and more in}} your ear than is comfortable, leaving you hanging on every word." [...] Writers generally warmed to the albums introspective songs and well chosen covers. US journal for improvised and progressive music Signal to Noise heralded the album as [...] "haunting folk into straight-up epic territory." [...] Many reviews {{picked up on the}} integration of hi-fidelity crossed with a lo fi, homemade approach. Sunday Times critic Mark Edwards: [...] "The secret lies in the gap between Adey’s main influences: on the one hand, the mournful, home-made alt-country of Oldham and Smog; on the other, the pristine atmospheres of the Blue Nile and Talk Talk." [...] Critic Leon McDdermott (Glasgow Herald) writes [...] "Adey channels the spirit of Smog, minus Bill Callahans caustic take on dysfunctional relationships; elsewhere, there are hints of the late Jeff Buckleys mournful tenderness." ...|$|R
25|$|A typical annual {{training}} programme for 12 Squadron consisted of individual {{training in the}} autumn, working up to Squadron training in the summer consisting of bombing, formation flying, navigation exercises and gunnery. Experimental trials carried out included some limited night flying and the introduction into service and testing of parachutes for aircrew. This involved a number of practice jumps being performed by observers, who would {{climb out of the}} aircraft onto a small ladder and await a signal from the pilot as the aircraft flew over the airfield at 2000ft. The observers carried no reserve parachutes, and the silk material from which the parachutes were constructed had a tendency to build up a static charge whilst in storage, such that when the <b>ripcord</b> was pulled, the silk stuck together. 12 Squadron was also tasked with further trials work, experimenting with oxygen systems, high altitude photography, and low temperature trials work, particularly in respect to lubricants.
