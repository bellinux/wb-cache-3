25|$|Finding a {{cure for}} the {{diseases}} caused by frameshift mutations is rare. Research into this is evident. One example is a primary immunodeficiency (PID), an inherited condition {{which can lead to}} an increase in infections. There are 120 genes and 150 mutations that play a role in primary immunodeficiencies. The standard treatment is currently gene therapy, but this is a highly risky treatment and can often lead to other diseases, such as leukemia. Gene therapy procedures include modifying the zinc fringer nuclease fustion protein, cleaving both ends of the mutation, which in turn removes it from the sequence. Antisense-oligonucleotide mediated exon skipping is another possibility for Duchenne muscular dystrophy. This process allows for passing over the mutation so {{that the rest of the}} sequence remains in frame and the function of the protein stays intact. This, however, does not cure the disease, just treats symptoms, and is only practical in structural proteins or other repetitive genes. A third form of repair is <b>revertant</b> mosaicism, which is naturally occurring by creating a reverse mutation or a mutation at a second site that corrects the reading frame. This reversion may happen by intragenic recombination, mitotic gene conversion, second site DNA slipping or site-specific reversion. This is possible in several diseases, such as X-linked severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), Wiskott–Aldrich syndrome, and Bloom syndrome. There are no drugs or other pharmacogenomic methods that help with PIDs.|$|E
2500|$|Curiously, mutant <b>revertant</b> MCF-7/AdrVp {{cells that}} lost their multidrug {{resistance}} and became drug-sensitive also lost H19 expression.|$|E
50|$|But mosaicism {{need not}} {{necessarily}} be deleterious. <b>Revertant</b> somatic mosaicism is a rare recombination event {{in which there is}} a spontaneous correction of a mutant, pathogenic allele. In <b>revertant</b> mosaicism, the healthy tissue formed by mitotic recombination can outcompete the original, surrounding mutant cells in tissues like blood and epithelia that regenerate often. In the skin disorder ichthyosis with confetti, normal skin spots appear early in life and increase in number and size over time.|$|E
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of {{two classes}} of <b>revertants</b> of Simian virus 40 (SV 40) -transformed 3 T 3 cells to retransformation by SV 40 or murine sarcoma virus (MSV) was studied. Both serum-sensitive and density-sensitive <b>revertants</b> are not retransformable by SV 40. MSV can transform both types of <b>revertants.</b> The MSV-transformed <b>revertants</b> grow to high cell densities and form colonies when suspended in semi-solid methylcellulose medium, but are unable to grow in 1 % calf serum.

40|$|Phenotypic <b>revertants</b> of Finkel-Biskis-Riley (FBR) -murine sarcoma virus-transformed rat {{fibroblasts}} {{were isolated}} {{on the basis}} of their adherence to plastic tissue culture dishes in the absence of divalent cations. Some <b>revertants</b> had sustained deletions or inactivating mutations of the v-fos gene. However, two <b>revertants</b> expressed a functional v-fos gene at levels equal to that in the transformed parental cells, and therefore phenotypic reversion was due to mutations in nonviral genes. These <b>revertants</b> were considered nontransformed according to four criteria: (i) they were flat and had a nontransformed morphology, (ii) they were contact inhibited when grown to confluence, (iii) they did not display anchorage-independent growth in soft agar, and (iv) they did not form tumors in nude mice. Somatic-cell hybrids between the <b>revertants</b> and the transformed parental cells were nontransformed, suggesting that the <b>revertants</b> had sustained an activating mutation of a gene capable of suppressing transformation. The expression of c-jun, junB, and junD was not altered in the <b>revertants,</b> and they could not be transformed by transfection with a c-jun expression vector. The <b>revertants</b> were resistant to transformation by an activated c-Ha-ras gene but were susceptible to transformation by simian virus 40. Our results demonstrate the existence of a class of <b>revertants</b> that harbor genes capable of suppressing transformation by v-fos and some other oncogenes. This contrasts with previously described <b>revertants</b> of transformation by v-fos that contain recessive mutations...|$|R
40|$|Escherichia coli {{cells with}} a polCts {{mutation}} contain a temperature-sensitive DNA polymerase II and fall to replicate DNA at the restrictive temperature (43 degreees C). Mutants deficient in polymerizing {{activity of the}} other two recognized DNA polymerases in E. coli can replicate DNA. We have isolated temperature-resistant <b>revertants</b> from a strain containing polA-, polB-, and polCts mutations. These <b>revertants</b> grow at 43 degrees C, but analysis of partially purified DNA polymerase III from several such <b>revertants</b> shows a temperature-sensitive DNA polymerase III activity. Genetic analysis by P 1 transduction confirms that such <b>revertants</b> can contain a polCts mutation and also a polA- mutation. We find that such <b>revertants</b> behave phenotypically as PolI+ cells (DNA polymerase I-containing), and extracts of such cells show a DNA polymerase I-like activity. <b>Revertants</b> of polA-, dnaAts and polA-, dnaBts strains do not show such a DNA polymerase activity...|$|R

40|$|Salmonella tester strain TA 102 {{carries the}} hisG 428 ochre {{mutation}} on the multicopy plasmid pAQ 1. DNA sequence analysis of 45 spontaneous <b>revertants</b> of hisG 428 on the chromosome {{in the presence}} of pKM 101 (strain TA 103) indicates that hisG 428 <b>revertants</b> fall into three major categories: (i) small, in-frame deletions (3 or 6 base pairs) that remove part or all of the ochre triplet; (ii) base substitution mutations at the ochre site; (iii) extragenic ochre suppressors. Deletion <b>revertants</b> are identified in a simple phenotypic screen by their resistance to the inhibitory histidine analog thiazolealanine, which feedback inhibits the wild-type hisG enzyme but not the enzyme resulting from the deletions. The effect of various genetic backgrounds on the generation of spontaneous deletion <b>revertants</b> was examined. The error-prone repair system encoded in the pKM 101 plasmid markedly increased the frequency of total spontaneous reversion events in all genetic backgrounds except recA but did not affect the frequency of spontaneous deletion <b>revertants</b> in any background except polA. The presence of a polA mutation increased the frequency of spontaneous deletion <b>revertants</b> by 2 -fold in the absence of pKM 101 and by 20 -fold with pKM 101. The presence of a uvrB mutation or a recA mutation suppressed the generation of spontaneous deletion <b>revertants</b> to approximately 1 / 2. 5. When hisG 428 was in multiple copies on pAQ 1, the frequency of spontaneous deletion <b>revertants</b> increased by 40 -fold, which is the approximate copy number of pAQ 1. Mutagenic agents that induce single-strand breaks in DNA (e. g., x-rays, bleomycin, and nalidixic acid) induced deletion <b>revertants</b> in TA 102. These agents induced deletion <b>revertants</b> only in hisG 428 on pAQ 1 and only {{in the presence of}} pKM 101. Deletion <b>revertants</b> were not induced by frameshift mutagens (i. e., ICR- 191 and 9 -aminoacridine). These results indicate that different pathways exist for the generation of spontaneous and mutagen-induced deletion <b>revertants</b> of hisG 428...|$|R
40|$|A {{large number}} of {{spontaneous}} conditional <b>revertants</b> of Bacillus subtilis glutamine auxotrophs were isolated by plating cells on minimal medium and incubating them at various temperatures. No heat-sensitive <b>revertants</b> were found among 2000 scored; however, <b>revertants</b> with a cold-sensitive glutamine requirement were quite common. Growth of the latter class ceased immediately upon transfer to the restrictive temperature implying that glutamine synthetase activity was affected. Mapping data are consistent with a genetic location in or near g l d, the structural gene for glutamine synthetase, for all cold-sensitive <b>revertants</b> tested. These <b>revertants</b> {{are likely to have}} second site suppressor mutations in glnA since many have altered levels or kinetics of glutamine synthetase activity or a changed pattern of feedback inhibition...|$|R
40|$|<b>Revertants</b> of Kirsten sarcoma virus {{transformed}} nonproducer BALB/ 3 T 3 cells (KA 31 cells) {{were isolated}} after exposing the transformed cells to 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine at high cell density, or when suspended in methylcellulose. <b>Revertants</b> were also isolated by treating KA 31 cells with the lectin, concanavalin A, which is manyfold more toxic to transformed cells than for normal cells. The <b>revertants</b> resemble BALB/ 3 T 3 cells in their morphology and growth characteristics {{in that they}} have a low saturation density, fail to grow in 1 % calf serum or when suspended in methylcellulose, and cease to synthesize DNA after reaching their saturation density. Infection by murine leukemia virus rescues Kirsten sarcoma virus from only the concanavalin-A-selected variants, though all the <b>revertants</b> are susceptible to infection by leukemia virus. The concanavalin A <b>revertants</b> also become transformed after infection with murine leukemia virus. All the <b>revertants</b> can be transformed by Kirsten sarcoma virus but not by simian virus 40...|$|R

40|$|Previously, {{arginine}} <b>revertants</b> of Escherichia coli WWU, {{a derivative}} of E. coli 15 T−, have been subdivided by two independent methods: (i) the streak morphology on nutrient agar, and (ii) {{the pattern of}} phage growth using amber and ochre mutants of bacteriophage T 4. In the first assay, <b>revertants</b> were subdivided into two classes according to the appearance of streaks after incubation on nutrient agar, a thick, even line of growth defining normal <b>revertants</b> and a thin, irregular line defining aberrant <b>revertants.</b> In the second assay, <b>revertants</b> were classified by the suppressors they contained. The present work demonstrates that <b>revertants</b> containing an amber suppressor show the aberrant morphology and are also able to catabolize thymidine for energy and carbon. This {{is in contrast to}} the parent WWU containing no suppressor, which shows a normal morphology and cannot utilize thymidine as an energy source. <b>Revertants</b> containing no suppressor, isolated specifically for their ability to catabolize thymidine, show an aberrant morphology. Together, these results indicate that the aberrant morphology results from suppression of an amber triplet in a gene of the thymidine catabolic pathway. Enzyme assays show the amber triplet to be in the gene specifying deoxyribomutase. It is suggested that the aberrant arginine <b>revertants</b> are analogous to high thymine-requiring mutants and that, in general, high and low thymine-requiring mutants differ from one another in their ability to catabolize deoxyribose- 1 -phosphate...|$|R

The <b>revertants</b> continue to express high steady-state levels of the ras oncogene. Partial retransformation of reverted cells is induced after 5 -azacytidine treatment or after infection with retrovirus vectors carrying the v-abl, v-fes, v-myc, or v-src oncogene.

40|$|Single-step mutants of Bacillus subtilis blocked at stage zero of {{sporulation}} (spoO mutants) are pleiotropic. They are impaired {{in several}} traits, including increased sensitivity to polymyxin B, {{when compared to}} the wild type. <b>Revertants</b> for one or another of the traits associated in this pleiotropy have been isolated and classified according to their phenotypes. Attention was centered on partial <b>revertants</b> (spoO still), of which at least three classes could be recognized. Class I partial <b>revertants</b> recovered a high level of resistance to polymyxin and, in a constant order, a variable number of the other traits; some kind of hierarchy is thus revealed to exist among the traits affected in the original pleiotropy. Partial <b>revertants</b> in the other two classes are still hypersensitive to polymyxin. In class II <b>revertants,</b> ability to excrete exoenzymes and antibiotic(s) is recovered to various extents. Only inducibility of nitrate reductase by nitrate is recovered in class III mutants. The possible significance of these observations is discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Tumor {{reversion}} history {{started in}} the early 1960s with the flat <b>revertant</b> cells when researchers used the NIH3T3 cells to assay the transforming potential of oncoviruses and oncogenes. Robert Pollack, later in 1968, made the observation {{that some of the}} cells infected with SV40 or polyoma viruses no longer showed the typical oncogenic phenotype, but instead, acquired a flat morphology (Pollack et al., 1968). These cells had also lost their oncogenic potential and were therefore named [...] "flat revertants".|$|E
50|$|Therefore, {{the use of}} HAT {{medium for}} cell culture {{is a form of}} {{artificial}} selection for cells containing working TK and HGPRT. Many useful refinements to the scheme are made possible by poisons that kill cells, but to which they are immune if they lack one of these genes. Thus, a cell lacking TK is resistant to bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) and a cell lacking HGPRT is resistant to 6-thioguanine (6-TG) and 8-azaguanine. Thus, selection with one of the latter two drugs, followed by HAT medium, will yield <b>revertant</b> colonies.|$|E
50|$|In {{experiments}} {{conducted by}} Doyle et al., {{it was found}} that MCF-7, a breast adenomacarcinoma cell line, did not express the H19 gene; however a subline of MCF-7 with a multidrug resistance phenotype, MCF-7/AdrVp, had upregulation of H19. Curiously, mutant <b>revertant</b> MCF-7/AdrVp cells that lost their multidrug resistance and became drug-sensitive also lost H19 expression. Drug-resistant MCF-AdrVp cells do not overexpress P-glycoprotein, a cell membrane efflux pump commonly found in multidrug resistant cells; instead, they overexpress a 95kD membrane glycoprotein p95. p95, or NCA-90, is related to carcinoembryonic antigens, which have been found to reduce drug toxicity by Kawaharata et al.|$|E

40|$|<b>Revertants</b> were {{selected}} from aryl hydrocarbon hydroxylase (AHH) -deficient recessive mutants belonging to three complementation groups and from a dominant mutant of the Hepa- 1 cell line. The recessive mutants had low spontaneous reversion frequencies (less than 4 X 10 (- 7] that were increased by mutagenesis. The majority of these <b>revertants</b> also had reacquired only partial AHH activity. <b>Revertants</b> of group A mutants were identical to the wild type with respect to both in vivo and in vitro enzyme stability and the Km for the substrate, benzo [alpha]pyrene, and therefore failed to provide evidence that gene A is the AHH structural gene. Group B and group C mutants are defective in {{the functioning of the}} Ah receptor required for AHH induction. <b>Revertants</b> of these groups were normal with respect to in vivo temperature sensitivity for AHH induction and for the 50 % effective dose for the inducer, 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, and thus provided no evidence that the B and C genes code for components of the receptor. Two rare group C <b>revertants</b> possessed AHH activity in the absence of induction. The phenotype of one of these was shown to be recessive to the wild type. Spontaneous <b>revertants</b> of the dominant mutant occurred at a frequency 300 -fold greater than those of the recessive mutants, and this frequency was not increased by mutagenesis.

DMD may result from mRNA that contains out-of-frame mutations (e.g. deletions, insertions or splice site mutations), resulting in frameshift or early termination so that in most muscle fibers no functional dystrophin is produced (though some <b>revertant</b> muscle fibers produce some dystrophin).

50|$|Dr. von Borstel, in the 1970s, {{conducted}} experiments {{similar to}} the Lactose Starvation experiment with yeast, specifically Saccharomyces cerevisiae. He tested for tryptophan auxotroph revertants. A tryptophan auxotroph cannot make tryptophan for itself, but wild-type cells can and so a <b>revertant</b> will revert to the normal state {{of being able to}} produce tryptophan. He found that when yeast colonies were moved from a tryptophan-rich medium to a minimal one, revertants continued to appear for several days. The degree to which revertants were observed in yeast was not as high as with bacteria. Other scientists have conducted similar experiments, such as Hall who tested histidine revertants, or Steele & Jinks-Robertson who tested lysine. These experiments demonstrate how recombination and DNA replication are necessary for adaptive mutation. However, in lysine-tested cells, recombination continued to occur even without selection for it. Steele and Jinks-Robertson concluded that recombination occurred in all circumstances, adaptive or otherwise, while mutations were present only when they were beneficial and adaptive.|$|E

Despite many efforts, treatment for EB remains symptomatic. <b>Revertant</b> mosaicism, coexistence of cells carrying disease-causing mutations with cells in which the inherited mutation is genetically corrected by a spontaneous genetic event (<b>revertant</b> cells) in 1 individual, can be found in EB. The naturally corrected <b>revertant</b> keratinocytes provide an opportunity for autologous cell therapy. Objective: We sought to locally treat EB by transplantation of <b>revertant</b> skin.
