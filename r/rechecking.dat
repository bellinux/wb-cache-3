40|$|This {{research}} aims at {{describing the}} problem solving done by students with field dependent and field independent cognitive style. This research is a descriptive research which uses qualitative approach. The research subjects {{of this research}} are students grade VII-D, VII-H, and VII-I of MTs Negeri Batu. The data are collected through written test, interview, and documentation as the instruments. The findings show that most field dependent students can only identify what is asked in the problem and make a plan {{to solve the problem}} but they cannot do such activities like arranging correct steps and rules, the step for doing the problem solving, solving problem correctly and its steps to <b>recheck</b> the answers. They cannot <b>recheck</b> the answers through mathematical calculation but they can only mention the ways to <b>recheck</b> the answers. Meanwhile, field independent students can identify the provided information, what is asked, and add other information considered to be important. They can also make a plan to solve a problem and mention the steps and rules of solving problem correctly. They can do the plan to solve problem well and <b>recheck</b> it. They cannot <b>recheck</b> the answers through mathematical calculation but they can only mention the ways to <b>recheck</b> the answers. The similarities between these styles are that they can identify what is asked and what steps are needed to <b>recheck</b> the solution. In contrast, they have differences in identifying the provided information and what is considered as important information, arranging the plan, doing the plan, and <b>recheck</b> it...|$|R

40|$|An Analysis of the Validation of the Quality Achievement Tests in the Learning Program Implementation. This study aims to {{investigate}} the test types developed by FE YSU, {{the steps of the}} development and validation, and the quality based on theories. This study was a survey involving 192 lecturers who taught basic science and technology subjects in the odd semester of 2008 / 2009. The sample, consisting of 92 lecturers, was selected using the proportional random sampling technique. The data were collected through documents and questionnaires and analyzed using the descriptive quantitative technique. The results showed that 1) 55. 42 % of the lecturers developed essays tests for measuring learning achievement, 13. 03 % developed objective tests, and 31. 55 % combined both; 2) in the test development process, 35. 87 % made the test blue-prints and 23. 92 % did not; only 13. 59 % developed new tests, 2. 74 % used old tests, and 46. 19 % combined the old tests with the new ones; 3) 54. 89 % <b>rechecked</b> the tests and 3. 73 % did not, 25. 50 % <b>rechecked</b> the tests by themselves and 17. 85 % <b>rechecked</b> the tests with group members of the same subject, 2. 18 % had other lecturers fully check the tests, 32. 85 % <b>rechecked</b> the essay tests, 11. 18 % <b>rechecked</b> the objective tests, and 91 % <b>rechecked</b> mostly the relevance between the test and the learning competence; and 4) theoretically, 87 % of the tests developed by lecturers were good in terms of the essence of the test quality.

40|$|Background: The Revised National Tuberculosis Control Programme (RNTCP) is {{implementing}} the External Quality assurance (EQA) and Random blinded re-checking (RBRC) {{as one of}} its important component. This nationwide study was conducted to determine (1) the number and types of RBRC errors and (2) the sensitivity and specificity among <b>rechecked</b> slides. Materials and Methods: The study was based on the monthly RBRC reports submitted by ~ 13, 000 designated microscopy centres (DMCs) across the country under routine programmatic settings in 2010. The DMCs reports were compiled at district, state and national level. Results: A total of 11, 89, 564 slides were <b>rechecked</b> from 11, 039 DMCs. Of which 99. 5 % of <b>rechecked</b> slides did not have any errors. The sensitivity and specificity of the <b>rechecked</b> slides had 98 % sensitivity and 100 % specificity. Conclusion: RBRC is the crucial component of EQA and the results from the programme are found to be satisfactory. Based on the study findings, the earlier value of 80 % sensitivity used for calculation of annual sample size for RBRC has been increased to 90 % sensitivity. The annual RBRC sample size for DMCs has been increased by 1. 5 – 2 folds...|$|R
40|$|Bovine {{respiratory}} disease (BRD) {{is the leading}} cause of illness and death in U. S. feedlot cattle. This study evaluated the use of isoflupredone acetate in the treatment of BRD. Crossbred male beef calves (n = 192; BW = 221 Â± 3. 9 kg) were acquired in two blocks from regional auction markets and transported to the University of Arkansas Stocker and Receiving Cattle Unit. Calves were observed daily for signs of respiratory illness. Antibiotic treatment was administered if calves displayed signs of respiratory illness and rectal temperature was â‰¥ 40 Â°C. Calves (n = 72) requiring antibiotic treatment were assigned randomly to either treatment 1 (florfenicol) or treatment 2 (florfenicol plus isoflupredone acetate). Both treatment groups were <b>rechecked</b> 48 hours post treatment to determine treatment efficacy. Blood was collected (at treatment and <b>recheck)</b> via jugular venipuncture to evaluate complete blood count. Weights were recorded on days 0, 14, 28, 45, and 46. No difference existed for medical cost (P = 0. 54) or temperature at <b>recheck</b> (P = 0. 43). Upon <b>recheck,</b> neutrophils were higher and lymphocytes were lower in calves that received isoflupredone acetate (P â‰¤ 0. 04). No difference existed in overall white blood cell count at <b>recheck</b> (P = 0. 67). Calves that received isoflupredone acetate tended to exhibit greater (P = 0. 09) average daily gain (ADG) between days 14 and 28 of the study. Results indicate that using isoflupredone acetate as ancillary therapy in the treatment of BRD did not have a positive effect on overall ADG or medical costs...|$|R
