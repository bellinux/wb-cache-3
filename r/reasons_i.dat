The stars are miscast, the production is chintzy and the books defy adaptation, but A keeps plugging.|$|E

After the CBC moved {{his father to}} its Ottawa headquarters in the early 1950s, Jennings transferred to Lisgar Collegiate Institute.

Many years later Jacques Monod pointed out to me that I did not appear to understand the correct use of the word dogma, which is a belief that cannot be doubted. I did apprehend this in a vague sort of way but since I thought that all religious beliefs were without foundation, I used the word the way I myself thought about it, not as most of the world does, and simply applied it to a grand hypothesis that, however plausible, had little direct experimental support." ...|$|E

One shot of Loki on Asgard." [...] On Fury and Black Panther, he remarked [...] "It’s very complicated to do: who plays those characters? And designing the costume, getting it going … We tried. We were there in development, and we tried, but they were very difficult for all the <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> gave. And we don’t want to do something that’s half baked because it’s not good for us and it’s not good for our fans."

Welling talked about why {{he was interested in}} the project in an interview with Paul Fischer: [...] "The top three <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> decided to do this film were, one, Steve Martin, two, Steve Martin and three, Steve Martin. That was the number one draw for me. Then, after reading the script, I really liked this character, Charlie.

500|$|Naz {{is one of}} {{four main}} {{characters}} from series two of EastEnders: E20, created by its team of thirteen writers, along with Asher, Sol and Stevie. Newcomer Emaa Hussen was cast in the role, and said: [...] "It's a really exciting place to start my career. I'm from East London and a big fan of EastEnders, {{which is one of the}} <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> wanted to do the show." [...] Hussen said she was offered the part as the producers saw something [...] "authentic and real" [...] in her and that she could play the character how they wanted, and said she is similar to the character in some ways, adding that she enjoyed playing a strong character and felt like Naz as soon as she got into cotume. The character and casting were announced on 28 July 2010. The show's producer, Deborah Sathe, said [...] "I am [...] proud of what the writers have achieved. [...] have created four new faces for [...] Square and their reaction to Walford life is really exciting." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Humbug" [...] {{was written}} by Darin Morgan; {{it was his first}} script for the series. Earlier in the second season, he {{appeared}} in the second episode [...] "The Host" [...] as the Flukeman. He also helped his brother Glen Morgan—already a regular writer on The X-Files—with the script for the following episode, [...] "Blood". Series creator Chris Carter offered Darin Morgan a permanent place on The X-Files writing team, which he reluctantly accepted. Morgan said he was uncomfortable initially, stating [...] "One of the <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> was uncomfortable joining the staff is that I'm a comedy writer and this isn't a comedy show, so I was trying more or less to have an episode {{with a little bit of}} humor, without telling anybody what I was doing." [...] Glen suggested that he write an episode about sideshow performers. Before writing the episode Darin Morgan watched a tape of Jim Rose's circus sideshow and subsequently cast Rose and The Enigma as Dr. Blockhead and The Conundrum, respectively. Other guest stars were Twin Peaks regular Michael J. Anderson as Mr. Nutt and Vincent Schiavelli as Lanny.|$|E

[...] Detroit rapper Elzhi states, [...] "round the time Nas did Illmatic, it made me wanna step my game up... He's one of the <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> did go off into storytelling because his pictures were so vivid. When he displayed his rhyme schemes and his word play and his songs, it made me wanna create visual pictures as well." [...] Casey Veggies also recounts the impact Nas' lyricism had on his own work as an underground rapper in the 2000s: “I [...] Illmatic when I was 14, 15. I didn’t get onto to it till late, but when I did, that's probably the only thing I listened to for six months to a year... After I got heavy on Illmatic, I put out Sleeping In Class (2010). That's when I really tried to sharpen my skills and get better.” ...|$|E

[...] Reeves expressed his intent to retain the book's early 1980s setting and his admiration for the book and Alfredson's adaptation. [...] "It's a terrific movie and a fantastic book.

500|$|The New York Yankees {{also made}} the playoffs in 1999, {{eventually}} advancing to the 1999 World Series where they defeated the Atlanta Braves. Prior to the Mets' elimination Mike Lupica noted {{the possibility of a}} [...] "Subway Series", a term for a World Series played between two New York-based teams. The 1956 World Series between the Yankees and then-Brooklyn Dodgers was the last such Series. Yankees pitcher David Cone told Lupica [...] "I want a Subway Series, for selfish <b>reasons.</b> <b>I</b> want to play in one." [...] Although the Mets failed to make the Series in 1999 the two met the following year in the 2000 World Series where the Yankees won in five games. After their 2000 World Series appearance the Mets did not make the playoffs again until 2006, where they lost in that NLCS in seven games. Meanwhile, the Reds did not place in the top two of their division until returning to the playoffs in 2010. Jack McKeon managed the Reds from 1998–2000 and was fired after the 2000 season when the team finished 10 games back of the division leading Cardinals.|$|E
500|$|Critics {{generally}} {{disliked the}} focus the episode {{placed on the}} adult characters, with many objecting to Will's characterisation. VanDerWerff wrote that his storyline with Emma [...] "misplac what made either of the characters enjoyable in the first place", and IGN's Robert Canning—who otherwise enjoyed the episode, and rated it 8.5/10—observed that Will was presented as being selfish and a [...] "terrible educator", in contrast to his former role as the moral centre of the show. Lisa de Moraes of The Washington Post initially found {{the focus on the}} adults a welcome change, but felt their storyline rapidly became convoluted. Anthony Benigno of the Daily News liked Will less as the episode progressed, and deemed it overall, [...] "Creepy, vaguely uncomfortable, in slightly poor taste but well-intentioned, and ultimately, thoroughly entertaining to watch for <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> can't quite put into words." [...] CNN's Lisa Respers France actually enjoyed the episode for the additional depth it brought to Will and his feelings for Emma, as well as Finn and his body image issues. While Stack commended the male body image storyline, and found it refreshing for a program to examine the objectification of men, de Moraes derided it, and likened Finn and Sam's discussion about eating healthily and working out to an [...] "after school special".|$|E

[...] Ekens also notes that its thematic purpose [...] "seems to be Jun Maeda's opportunity for melodramatic elaboration on the emotional dilemmas posed by Madoka Magica." [...] Overall, Charlotte was lauded for its entertainment value and unpredictability, but [...] "disappoints as a work of art."

Although the location was not featured in the comics of the same name, Hurd felt {{that it was important to}} add because of its close proximity to the survivor's camp. As opposed to the previous episode, where filming mostly took place outside of the Cobb Energy Performing Arts Centre, production for [...] "TS-19" [...] occurred inside of the building. Darabont conceived the idea of exploring into the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. [...] "When Frank was pitching the idea to me, saying he wanted to bring them to the CDC and telling me all the different things that he felt would come out of that story, the science of it all and the being trapped in the small location, I was very much picturing a lot of Day of the Dead stuff," [...] stated creator Robert Kirkman.

[...] Eric Goldman of IGN gave this episode a score of 8.5 out of 10, calling it [...] "a nice break from the Volkoff drama". Melody Simpson of Buzz Focus wrote, [...] "This story line has the potential to bring lots of drama but the way that it has been building up to this moment." [...] Stephen Lackey of Mania called the episode [...] "fun stuff just lacking in drama where drama was required." [...] Brittany Frederick of Starpulse wrote that the episode reminded her [...] "of all the <b>reasons</b> <b>I</b> fell in love with this show a year ago. It's fun, and funny without being campy, but more importantly, it's got heart. It's an episode that made me think, 'This is why people fight for this show season after season.'
