500|$|Vagrant Story is {{acknowledged}} {{as a game}} with an [...] "extreme popularity" [...] outside Japan eight {{years after it was}} first released. In October 2007, during an interview with the development team responsible for the remake of Final Fantasy Tactics for the PlayStation Portable, , Executive Producer Akitoshi Kawazu was asked {{about the possibility of a}} remake or port of the title to the PSP. Kawazu mentioned that it is [...] "the next natural candidate for such an update", although there would be difficulty in porting the game, because it was a title that already pushed the original PlayStation to its technical limits. Kawazu also remarked that bringing the character Ashley Riot into other Ivalice titles would be difficult since, even in Vagrant Story, [...] "there's <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> much learn(ed) about Ashley Riot".|$|E
500|$|In a 2009 {{interview}} for The Atlanta Journal-Constitution, Hunt discussed {{working as an}} independent artist, stating [...] "Creatively it is certainly liberating, {{but the rest of}} it is <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> fun. I wanted a happy medium between the system of recording, marketing and distribution which I think is very important to any product you want to bring to market ... but I never had that with the record industry. Now that I'm {{on the other side of}} it trying to be the artist and the industry, I realize what the importance of the system was, but I also realize there was a lot that was missing since it is basically dying now." [...] He also said that he intends on recording another album [...] "at least one more time and then go on tour, and then I don't know." ...|$|E
500|$|American critic Robert Christgau {{gave the}} album a [...] "neither" [...] rating, {{indicating}} an album that [...] "may impress {{once or twice}} with consistent craft or an arresting track or two. Then it won't". A negative review came from Rolling Stone, who gave the album two stars out of five, labelling the album [...] "utterly disappointing" [...] and blaming producer Nellee Hooper, suggesting he [...] "sabotaged a ferociously iconoclastic talent with a phalanx of cheap electronic gimmickry." [...] Michele Romero of Entertainment Weekly gave the album a C, saying, [...] "On a few songs, [...] breathy mewl is a pleasant contrast to the mechanical drone of Sugarcube-like techno-tunes. But most of Debut sounds annoyingly like the monotonous plinking of a deranged music box. Wind it up if you like -- eventually it will stop." [...] Debut rated highly in British end of year polls. The NME ranked Debut at number one on their list of [...] "Top 50 LPs of 1993". Melody Maker placed the album at number six on their list of [...] "Albums of the Year for 1993" [...] calling it [...] "a fantastic debut". In 1994, Q included the album on their list for top fifty albums of 1993. Björk reacted to the positive reviews hesitantly, stating that if she'd [...] "delivered exactly the same album and I came from Nottingham, I'd have got completely different reviews, normal down-to-earth ones" [...] and that Debut [...] "was {{a bit of a}} rehearsal and it's <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> good. I can do much better." ...|$|E
5000|$|Allmusic {{awarded the}} album 3 stars with its review by Scott Yanow, stating: [...] "Throughout the set, Weston's solos {{hold on to}} one's interest, {{although}} the overall results are <b>really</b> <b>not</b> all <b>that</b> essential".|$|R

5000|$|More recently, Richie Unterberger of AllMusic {{has written}} of the album: [...] "Savaged by some critics, it's <b>really</b> <b>not</b> all <b>that</b> bad. But it ain't rock & roll, it's not what Ringo does best, and it's not an {{essential}} part of anyone's collection, Beatles fan or otherwise ..." ...|$|R
500|$|... "Call My Name" [...] is a dance-pop song {{written in}} E major {{with a time}} {{signature}} in common time and a tempo of 125 beats per minute. The vocal range from the singer spans from C4 to C5. [...] "Call My Name" [...] borrows similarities to Rihanna's [...] "We Found Love" [...] (2011) and Scissor Sisters' [...] "Only the Horses" [...] (2012), tracks that were also produced by Harris. Brogan Driscoll of The Huffington Post speculated that the [...] "dance anthem" [...] title, [...] "Call My Name", could be linked Cheryl's recent decision to drop her married name from her professional career. Sarah Deen of Metro stated that the track features a [...] "typical Calvin Harris beat and singalong chorus", the chorus of the song was considered a departure from Cheryl's previous works, namely [...] "Fight for This Love" [...] (2009) and [...] "Promise This" [...] (2010), while Marie Claire columnist Eleanor Young described [...] "Call My Name" [...] as a [...] "fast paced party track". When Peter Robinson of Popjustice compared the song to [...] "We Found Love" [...] during {{an interview with the}} singer, she responded, [...] "that's going to be natural because it's Calvin. They're both Calvin-produced songs. So naturally you're going to think that. But if you play them side by side they don't sound the same. Although you might naturally think that, because it's the same producer. It's not a bad thing." [...] She also said that the lyrics of the song don't have a meaning, but they do have a feeling: [...] "I think it's quite a sexy lyric? Um… It's <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> deep. We're not saving the world with lyrics or anything." ...|$|E
2500|$|Asked by Wolf Blitzer if {{he would}} ever support the efforts of Dennis Kucinich to cut funding for the war, Webb said, [...] "I – you know, I lived through Vietnam. I lived through it as a Marine and I know that those sorts of approaches, while they seem {{attractive}} on one level are <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> realistic. What {{we want to do}} – and I was talking with a number of senators today – is to try to get some of these so-called emergency legislation packages back into the committee process so that the committees can actually play." ...|$|E
2500|$|Lanegan told Christina Fuoco of Live Daily [...] "My {{relationship}} {{with these guys}} {{is one of the}} most satisfying that I've had". [...] "It's great to play with, essentially, my best friends." [...] When he was asked about the difference between Screaming Trees and Queens of the Stone Age he said [...] "It's all rock 'n' roll to me. A band is a band. They're <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> radically different. It's all rock music." [...] Lanegan has continued to work with Queens of the Stone Age even after leaving the band. In 2007, he appeared on their album, Era Vulgaris, contributing background vocals to the track [...] "River in the Road".|$|E

2500|$|On 6 February 2009, Borisov, {{speaking}} in Chicago, told Bulgarian expatriates {{that the human}} material and the basis of Bulgarian population at that moment included 1 million Roma, 700,000 Turks and 2.5 million retirees. He added that the human material that they are left with as voters and as a pool for recruiting staff is <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> big, as {{half a million people}} have left Bulgaria. Vice-president of the Party of European Socialists, Jan Marinus Wiersma, accused Borisov of referring to the Turks, Roma and pensioners in Bulgaria as [...] "bad human material," [...] and claimed that GERB [...] "has already crossed the invisible line between right wing populism and extremism." ...|$|E
2500|$|Later in the World War, Papen {{returned}} to the army on active service, first on the Western Front. In 1916 Papen took command of the 2nd Reserve Battalion of the 93rd Regiment of the 4th Guards Infantry Division fighting in Flanders. The Guards units of the Prussian Army had the responsibility of protecting Wilhelm II in peacetime, so a posting to a Guards unit was very prestigious. On 22 August 1916 Papen's battalion took heavy losses while successfully resisting a British attack on the river Somme that earned him praise for his courage under fire from his commanders. Between November 1916–February 1917, Papen's battalion was engaged in almost continuous heavy fighting, where Papen displayed coolness under fire and a certain [...] "reckless courage" [...] as {{he seemed to have}} no fear of death, but other officers criticized him for his tendency to charge into things without thinking matters through. On 11 April 1917, Papen fought at Vimy Ridge, where his battalion was defeated with heavy losses by the Canadian Corps. The Germans had held Vimy Ridge against repeated French attacks in 1915 and British attacks in 1916, and the ridge become a symbol of German power, so its loss in only one day's fighting to the Canadian corps was considered humiliating. In a report after Vimy, Papen's commanding officers praised him for his courage and elan as he resisted the Canadian assault up the heights of Vimy, ordering counter-attack after counter-attack, but criticised him for poor planning and execution of his counterattacks. Papen argued that the defeat was not so bad as the Canadian Corps were unsuccessful for the previous four weeks in attempting to take Vimy, so its loss in only one day was <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> bad. After Vimy, Papen stated he was tired of commanding infantrymen in defensive battles on the Western Front, and asked for a transfer to the Middle East, where he could fight in offensive battles as a cavalryman, the style of war in which he had been trained, and which suited his personality better. Significantly, Papen's commanding officers were not sorry to lose him, and approved his request to go to the Ottoman Empire.|$|E

2500|$|Record Mirror later {{reviewed}} the 1978 re-release of the single: [...] "And dirt we have.

6000|$|We {{walked home}} {{as far as}} his house, or rather his {{apartment}} over one of the village stores; and as he mounted to it by an outside staircase, we exchanged a joyous [...] "Gute Nacht," [...] and I kept on homeward through the dark and silent village street, which was <b>really</b> <b>not</b> <b>that</b> street, but some other, where Heine had been, some street out of the Reisebilder, of his knowledge, or of his dream. When I reached home it was useless to go to bed.
