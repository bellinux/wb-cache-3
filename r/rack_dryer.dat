40|$|Klanting is a cassava {{products}} {{that one of}} special food from Banyumas residence besides Gethuk goreng and Mendoan. Problem from produced of klanting is in drying process of raw material. IKM in Banyumas residence still has been using a conventional method. It use sunshine to dry the product, so it make capacities of klanting production became decrease in rainy season. Aims of the research were: (1) to design the <b>rack</b> <b>dryer</b> equipment for klanting with heat source from electric-stove, (2) to study performance of the equipment. This research used three steps, the steps were: (1) design of dryer equipment, include: functional and structural design, (2) dryer equipment manufacturing, and (3) performance test of dryer equipment include: functional test, reliability test, test without burden and test with burden. Design and manufacture of the equipment was processed in Agricultural Mechanization laboratory, Agricultural Faculty, Jendral Soedirman University. Furthermore, it was tested in UKM Sari Murni, Tamansari village, District Of Karanglewas, Banyumas residence. Result of the research showed that as a functional and structural design it is can operate with dimensions are, length 144 cm, wide 80 cm, and high 100 cm. At performances test without burden showed that the lowest draining in 370 C, highest 470 C, air stream at inlet equal 6. 24 x 10 - 2 m 3 /s, air stream exhaust 0. 36 x 10 - 2 m 3 /s, while amount energy the required is 0. 945 kW. The result of performances test with burden showed that total dryer capacities are 15. 00 kg with mean capacities equal to 1. 501 kg, lowest temperature in 310 C, while highest temperature in 380 C, air stream at inlet equal is 6. 24 x 10 - 2 m 3 /s, air stream exhaust is 0. 224 x 10 - 2 m 3 /s, while amount of energy required to dry klanting is 2. 52 kW. Whereas water content of klanting dried by appliance is 28. 21 %bb or 39. 52 % bk from water content initial 56. 15 %bb.

5000|$|Minangkabau {{people believe}} that talang which is {{collected}} from <b>rack</b> of clothes <b>dryer</b> or found drifting in the river is a good material for making saluang. Traditionally Minangkabau people also use talang as a container for sticky rice food (lamang, lemang) and as horizontal rack for drying clothes (jemuran kain) under sunlight [...]|$|R
40|$|The Application {{of solar}} drying for food {{commodity}} {{has been widely}} used in Indonesia. This Cost efficiently drying technique become a commonly use since {{it is easy to}} build, cheap and could be applied in any area as long as it has enough sun intensity trough out the year. Since this type of drying very dependent to sun, it has a limitation to be used in places where rainy days are longer than sunny days. This research has been conducted to solve the problem by implementing a <b>rack</b> type solar <b>dryer</b> with another heat resource which is a gas stove. A <b>rack</b> type solar <b>dryer</b> has build with a secondary heat source using gas fireplace. The rack build from light material using fickle timber and aluminums made it become portable. The dryer build with a knock down system, so it can be assemble and disassemble to reposition it in area with better solar recipient. Total weight of this dryer is only 32 kg and consists of four major parts. The first part is solar collector, height 22 cm, width 85 cm and length 187 cm at an angle of 5 o to the horizontal axle. The solar collector constructed in wave shape to maximize the acceptance area of solar ray. The collector builds in a glass house frame to optimize the heat dissipation so it can reach Working temperature of 65 oC. The fireplace was the second part, and made from rust proof steel. It has dimension of 85 cm width, 65 cm length and 22 cm height. The fireplace filled with 6 liters sand to maximize heat collect from the stove. The stove was the third part; consist of a gas stove and a 5 kg gas tube. The stove can be turn on in rainy day or at night as an alternative heat source for drying process. The tube contain of 3 kg gas that can fuel the stove for 60 hours. The last part was the drying rack with 360 liters volume. It has five cabinets and can fill up to 1500 pieces of dried banana. The rack equipped with a shell type door to simplify the containing process...|$|R
40|$|Lampung Province is {{the largest}} {{producer}} of cassava in Indonesia. Cassava has a weakness that is easily damaged {{and could not be}} stored longer. To overcome this, there is a need of an effective drying process so that cassava can be processed into other materials of lower power use as well as its economic value. A hybrid drying system is one solution to resolve the issue. The purpose of this research is to study the performance of drying cassava chips by using a hybrid type of <b>dryer</b> <b>rack.</b> The process of drying cassava chips made using a three-stage treatments with three replicates with the input load of 30 kg of cassava chips. The results showed that the pattern of decline in water levels in each treatment is uneven. The time needed to dry cassava chips to reach the water content of 10 % - 12 % in the drying of materials using sunlight for 18 hours, using electrical energy for 16 hours and use the energy of sunlight and electricity for 12 hours. The higher temperatures produced the shorter the time required in the drying process. Electrical energy required for the drying process using electric energy was 91 440 kJ and drying using electrical energy and sunlight was 68600 kJ.
