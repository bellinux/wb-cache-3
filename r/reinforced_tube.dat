5000|$|Ridgewood Reservoir {{was built}} by the City of Brooklyn, New York, which was rapidly {{outgrowing}} its local water supplies. The original design of the Ridgewood Reservoir {{as well as the}} final specifications for the Brooklyn Water Works system was designed by Brooklyn civil engineer, Samuel McElroy. This original design called for three basins, however, later engineer J.P. Kirkwood altered the designs and instead built a double basin. The new double reservoir was built in Snediker's Cornfield on a hilltop near Evergreen Cemetery in what was once part of Ridgewood, Queens (this section of Queens is now part of Glendale) and was sealed by puddling with clay and paving with stones. Ground was broken for the reservoir on July 11, 1856 and water was first raised on November 18, 1858.In 1862, the water supply for the reservoir consisted of six dammed streams in what is now Queens and Nassau Counties: Jamaica Stream (Baisley Pond), Simonson’s Stream, Clear Stream, Valley Stream, Pine’s Stream, and Hempstead Stream (Hempstead Lake). [...] This water was carried in a 12-mile-long masonry conduit, called the Ridgewood Aqueduct, to a pumping station at Atlantic Avenue and Chestnut Street near the City Line. There, steam-powered pumps, each with a capacity of 14 million gallons per day, forced the water up through a <b>reinforced</b> <b>tube</b> into the high reservoir whence it was distributed. By 1868 the Ridgewood Reservoir held an average of 154.4 million gallons daily, enough to supply the City of Brooklyn for ten days at that time.|$|E
40|$|Background and Aims: Air-Q™ is a newly {{introduced}} airway device, {{which can}} be used to facilitate endotracheal intubation. The primary aim {{of this study was to}} assess whether use of two different endotracheal tubes (ETTs) (standard polyvinyl chloride [PVC] and reinforced PVC) increases the success rate of blind intubation through Air-Q™ (Group Q) when compared with intubating laryngeal mask airway (ILMA- Fastrach™) keeping ILMA as control (Group I). Methods: One hundred and twenty patients aged between 18 and 60 years with American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-II, undergoing elective surgery under general anaesthesia, were enrolled into this prospective, randomised, case-control study to compare the success rate of tracheal intubation between ILMA (Fastrach™) and Air-Q™ intubating laryngeal airway. Those patients with anticipated difficult airway were excluded from the study. All the recruited patients completed the study. Reinforced PVC ETT was used in both airway devices to secure intubation. Since standard PVC tube is recommended for use in Air-Q, when first intubation attempt failed, second or third attempt was made with standard PVC ETT. Total of three attempts were made for each procedure: Whereas in ILMA group, only <b>reinforced</b> <b>tube</b> was used in all three attempts. Results: The overall success rate after three attempts was more with Air-Q (96. 6 %) in our study compared with ILMA (91. 6 %) but no significant difference was seen between the groups (P = 0. 43). Conclusion: The present study shows that when intubation with <b>reinforced</b> <b>tube</b> fails, the success rate with use of conventional PVC tube is more with Air-Q when compared with ILMA...|$|E

We compared intubation success rate of curved and straight <b>reinforced</b> tracheal <b>tubes</b> with polyvinyl chloride (PVC) tracheal tube using Airtaq™ laryngoscope in paralyzed and anesthetized patients. Material and Methods: Totally, 120 patients underwent random allocation to one of the three groups using computer-generated randomization table.

Experienced anesthesiologist performed endotracheal intubation and unblinded observer noted down success and ease of intubation.

Further, the hoop stress on the inner wall in such a situation may be compressive, rather than tensile. Both effects may be advantageous in certain settings, including biological organ systems...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to investigate the impact behaviour of Glass/PES, Glass/Carbon/PES and Carbon/PES composite tubes by performing analytical and experimental analyses. The aim is to obtain information that {{will serve as a}} basis for dealing with the design and testing of these composite tubes. A literature review is presented. This includes the process of manufacture of fibre <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>tubes,</b> impact studies of these materials, test standards, the measurements of elastic material properties and fracture toughness. The process which is employed to manufacture the composite tubes in this investigation is the film stacking hot press moulding technique. The film stacking method has been developed for fabricating continuous fibre <b>reinforced</b> composite <b>tubes</b> and is discussed in detail. Determining the mechanical properties in the tube form of the above composites is considerably more difficult than for isotropic materials. Several mechanical tests are described, together with the application of the laminate theory to determine the orthotropic properties of the composite materials. The basic concepts of fracture mechanics for the linear elastic regime are explained. Fracture mechanics parameters (stress intensity factor and strain energy release rate) for the composite are determined by analytical and experimental methods. A reasonable agreement is obtained and discrepancies between the analytical and the experimental techniques are attributed to the orthotropic properties of the composite. The ACQUIRE software package is used to detect the first three natural frequencies of the glass fibre <b>reinforced</b> PES composite <b>tubes</b> in a free-free condition.
