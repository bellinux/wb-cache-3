The Afar rangeland has two major known rainy seasons namely Kerma and Sugum. The severity of drought and shortage of feed and water in pastoral areas such as the Afar rangeland depend significantly up on the amount of rain the area received.

Many approaches {{have been proposed}} in literature to solve this problem, where a node predicts pre-emptively the route failure that occurs with the less received power. However, this approach encounters some difficulties, especially in scenario without mobility where route failures may arise. In this paper, we propose an improvement of AODV protocol called LO-PPAODV (Link Quality and MAC-Overhead aware Predictive Preemptive AODV). This protocol is based on new metric combine more routing metrics (Link Quality, MAC Overhead) between each node and one hop neighbor. Also we propose a cross-layer networking mechanism to distinguish between both situations, failures due to congestion or mobility, and consequently avoiding unnecessary route repair process. The LO-PPAODV was implemented using NS- 2. The simulation results show that our approach improves the overall performance of the network. It reduces the average end to end delay, the routing overhead, MAC errors and route errors, and increases the packet delivery fraction of the network.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{estimate}} {{the extent to}} which clinical and functional features of stroke were related to the use of mobility assistive technology devices. DESIGN: Longitudinal study of quality of life after stroke. SETTING: Hospitals, rehabilitation centers, and universities in Ontario and Quebec. PARTICIPANTS: Subjects (N= 316) with confirmed initial stroke were included in this analysis. Fifty-eight percent of the overall sample were men (n= 184). The mean age of this sample {{at the time of the}} stroke +/- standard deviation was 65. 3 +/- 15. 3 years (range, 19 - 96 y). One hundred thirty-five patients <b>received</b> a <b>mobility</b> assistive device poststroke, and 181 did not. INTERVENTION: Assistive devices for mobility (canes, walkers, wheelchairs). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Assistive device use and mobility capacity. RESULTS: Mobility device nonusers were less physically disabled than device users on a variety of measures. Poor physical functioning but good cognition were reliably associated with mobility device use. Use of multiple mobility assistive devices was more often associated with poorer physical functioning than was single device use. For single device users, wheelchair use was predicted by cognition, functional independence, and stroke recovery. Cane users, compared with walker users, had better mobility and were less physically impaired by stroke. CONCLUSIONS: Patients were well matched to device type based on their mobility capacity.

Researchers have been developing protocols and treatment techniques in order to maximize the effects of this intervention. Early mobility can be most effective when paired with reducing drug sedation due to the higher degree of mobility a patient can participate in. The purpose of this review is to determine whether critically ill and ventilated patients who <b>receive</b> early <b>mobility</b> have a better functional outcome and decreased length of stay in the hospital when compared to a patient receiving standard care. Case Description: This case follows a 22 year old male admitted to a University Medical Center in Texas following a three story fall from construction site scaffolding. He was evaluated and medically managed as a trauma patient sustaining multiple organ lacerations. The patient was intubated, ventilated and placed on several precautions. Outcomes: Outcome measures were based upon safety, highest degree of functional mobility at discharge and length of stay in the hospital in days. Discussion: Early mobilization within the ICU is feasible and safe. The most adverse common response to treatment was a drop in oxygen saturation, which was quickly restored after a short rest period. Patients who received early mobilization therapy had an improved functional mobility score when compared to patients receiving standard care.

40|$|Background and Purpose. The {{purpose of}} our study was to {{determine}} whether physical therapy interventions predicted meaningful short-term improvement in physical health for patients diagnosed with sciatica. Subjects. We examined data from 1, 804 patients (age: X 52. 1 years, SD 15. 6 years; 65. 7 % female, 34. 3 % male) who had been diagnosed with sciatica and who had completed an episode of out-patient physical therapy. Methods. Principal components factor analy-sis was used to define intervention categories from specific treatments applied during the plan of care. A nested-model logistic regression analysis identified intervention categories that predicted meaningful improvement in physical health. Meaningful improvement was defined as a change of 14 or more points on the Physical Component Scale- 12 (PCS- 12) summary score. Results. Twenty-six percent (n 473) of patients had a meaningful improvement in physical health. Improve-ment was more likely in patients <b>receiving</b> joint <b>mobility</b> interventions (odds ratio [OR] 2. 5, 95 % confidence interval [CI] 1. 5 – 4. 4) or general exercise (OR 1. 5, 95 % CI 1. 2 – 2. 0). Patients who received spasm reduction interventions were less likely to improve (OR 0. 77, 95 % CI 0. 60 – 0. 98). Discussion and Conclusion. Physical therapists should emphasize the use of joint mobility interventions and exercise when treating patients with sciatica, whereas interventions for spasm reduction should be avoided.

40|$|The theoretic part of {{the thesis}} focuses on social benefits, {{received}} by people with a severe motor disability, which are already impacted by new legal regulations. These regulations have been in effect since 1. 2. 2012. As {{a result of the}} social reform carried out in 2012 the number of allowances has decreased. According to Act No. 329 / 2011 there are two new allowances, mobility and special aid allowances. ¨ The research {{part of the}} thesis strives, through a qualitative strategic research, to reflect on the situation of people with a severe motor disability. The main objective of the thesis was to identify how the social and economic situation had changed for people with a severe motor disability in connection with reforms in the benefit system valid since January 2012. A partial task was to find out how the administration workload has changed for the applicant and recipient of social benefits. The data was collected through a half-standardised interview. The questions were divided into two thematic sections according to defined thesis objectives. The first set of questions focuses on the social and economic situation, specifically the change in a social and economic situation in connection with the newly set up social benefits (in the area of mobility and aids for people with a severe disability), financial involvement in paying for the aid and the change of the level of dependability (and subsequently the level of the allowance for care) in connection with newly created needs. The basic group consists of people with a severe motor disability who receive social benefits for disabled people in the Czech Republic. A selected group contained 8 people in total with a severe motor disability who receive allowances as part of the social benefits system. In case of respondents who originally had been receiving the allowance for individual transportation, the amount was decreased and they now receive it as a mobility allowance. In case of the decrease of the amount for transportation, the respondents changed their own usual ways of transportation or found other sources of funds. However, the social and economic situation of the respondents, who before the change in legislation were not <b>receiving</b> any <b>mobility</b> allowance (transportation) and at the moment they <b>receive</b> the <b>mobility</b> allowance, has improved in this area. The number of respondents in both groups is the same so we can say that the changes in allowances regarding transportation (mobility) have not brought any significant change in a social and economic situation of people. The most common view in terms of the question regarding the financial participation in special aids was neutral. Most respondents stated that the level of dependability on care and subsequently the allowance had remained the same. From {{the point of view of}} the majority of respondents the administration workload has not changed as a result of the change in legislation in the area of benefits for people with a severe motor disability. The respondents have a negative view regarding the character (depth) of investigation of the social and financial situation and negatively perceive the approach of an officer. In other areas their views are neutral or they have not noticed any change after the change in legislation.

The provisional licence is available without taking a test, although to get a full, unrestricted licence - the applicant must take a written 'Theory' test containing fifty multiple choice questions and fourteen-clip hazard perception test, both of which are done on a computer at one of the many DSA (Driving Standards Agency) Test centres.

40|$|Venous {{thromboembolism}} (VTE) is {{a common}} complication after acute ischemic stroke that can be prevented {{by the use of}} anticoagulants. Current guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians recommend that patients with acute ischemic stroke and restricted <b>mobility</b> <b>receive</b> prophylactic low-dose unfractionated heparin or a low-molecular-weight heparin. Results from clinical studies, most recently from PREVAIL (PREvention of Venous Thromboembolism After Acute Ischemic Stroke with LMWH and unfractionated heparin), suggest that the low-molecular-weight heparin, enoxaparin, is preferable to unfractionated heparin for VTE prophylaxis in patients with acute ischemic stroke and restricted mobility. This is due to a better clinical benefit-to-risk ratio, with the added convenience of once-daily administration. In line with findings from modeling studies and real-world data in acutely ill medical patients, recent economic data indicate that the higher drug cost of enoxaparin is offset by the reduction in clinical events as compared with the use of unfractionated heparin for the prevention of VTE after acute ischemic stroke, particularly in patients with severe stroke. With national performance measures highlighting the need for hospitals to examine their VTE practices, the relative costs of different regimens are of particular importance to health care decision-makers. The data reviewed here suggest that preferential use of enoxaparin over unfractionated heparin for the prevention of VTE after acute ischemic stroke may lead to reduced VTE rates and concomitant cost savings in clinical practice...|$|R

The questionnaire sought information on the subject's sociodemographic background and smoking habits. The predictors for successful quitting and intention to quit were assessed by chi-square tests and multiple logistic regression. Results: Of the respondents, 20. 2 % were current smokers, 25. 4 % were ex-smokers, and 54. 4 % were never smokers. Of the smoker (current and ex-smokers) respondents, 55. 7 % (335 / 601) had successfully quit {{at the time of}} enumeration. The predictors of quitting were living with others, <b>receiving</b> assistance for <b>mobility,</b> being nondrinkers, smoking for shorter duration, and smoking more cigarettes per day.

In proxy mobile IPv 6 (PMIPv 6), the message exchange for location update by any mobile device is established in centralized environment. Here, the messages are sent and <b>received</b> through local <b>mobility</b> anchor with centralized feature. As a result, there is devastating traffic at local mobility anchor which increases the cost of network. Also, the location update in distributed mobility environment is vulnerable to attacks such as false binding update, man-in-the-middle, replay attack etc. Therefore, the development of location update scheme necessitates the security enhancement and reduction in cost. Hence, the present paper proposes a new secure and efficient location update scheme using tokenization. It eliminates the additional message exchanges such as proxy binding update, binding query and acknowledgements between the hosts required in the earlier works. Here, the traffic overhead is controlled by distributing the token of mobile node with mobile access gateway in distributed mobility environment.

40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: The optimal {{duration}} of venous thromboembolism prophylaxis in acute stroke patients is unknown. This subanalysis of the Extended Prophylaxis for Venous ThromboEmbolism in Acutely Ill Medical Patients With Prolonged Immobilization (EXCLAIM) study investigated extended-duration thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin, compared with placebo following standard-duration enoxaparin, in ischemic stroke patients. METHODS: Acutely ill medical patients with recently reduced <b>mobility</b> <b>received</b> open-label enoxaparin 40 mg for 10 ± 4 days, {{and they were}} then randomized to double-blind enoxaparin 40 mg daily or placebo for further 28 ± 4 days. Venous thromboembolism incidence (symptomatic/asymptomatic deep-vein thrombosis, symptomatic/fatal pulmonary embolism) up to day 28 after randomization and major bleeding rates up to 48 h after the last dose of study treatment were reported. RESULTS: In total, 389 of 5963 (6. 5 %) randomized patients had ischemic stroke: 198 received extended-duration prophylaxis and 191 placebo. Extended-duration prophylaxis reduced venous thromboembolism incidence versus placebo (2. 4 % versus 8. 0 %; absolute risk difference, - 5. 6 %; 95 % CI, - 10. 5 % to - 0. 7 %), but it was associated {{with an increase in}} major bleeding (1. 5 % versus 0 % in enoxaparin and placebo groups; absolute risk difference, + 1. 5 %; 95 % CI, - 0. 2 % to 3. 2 %). CONCLUSIONS: Extended-duration thromboprophylaxis with enoxaparin was associated with reduced venous thromboembolism risk and increased major bleeding in the subgroup of patients with ischemic stroke in the EXCLAIM study...|$|R

Current guidelines from the American College of Chest Physicians recommend that patients with acute ischemic stroke and restricted <b>mobility</b> <b>receive</b> prophylactic low-dose unfractionated heparin or a low-molecular-weight heparin. Results from clinical studies, most recently from PREVAIL (PREvention of Venous Thromboembolism After Acute Ischemic Stroke with LMWH and unfractionated heparin), suggest that the low-molecular-weight heparin, enoxaparin, is preferable to unfractionated heparin for VTE prophylaxis in patients with acute ischemic stroke and restricted mobility. This is due to a better clinical benefit-to-risk ratio, with the added convenience of once-daily administration. In line with findings from modeling studies and real-world data in acutely ill medical patients, recent economic data indicate that the higher drug cost of enoxaparin is offset by the reduction in clinical events as compared with the use of unfractionated heparin for the prevention of VTE after acute ischemic stroke, particularly in patients with severe stroke. With national performance measures highlighting the need for hospitals to examine their VTE practices, the relative costs of different regimens are of particular importance to health care decision-makers. The data reviewed here suggest that preferential use of enoxaparin over unfractionated heparin for the prevention of VTE after acute ischemic stroke may lead to reduced VTE rates and concomitant cost savings in clinical practice.

40|$|PurposeTo compare {{articulated}} and nonarticulated early {{walking aids}} (EWAs) for clinical and quality-of-life outcomes in transtibial amputees. MethodsPatients undergoing lower limb amputation in a tertiary-care vascular surgical unit were screened over a 4 -year period. Recruited patients were randomized to <b>receive</b> articulated amputee <b>mobility</b> aid (AMA) or nonarticulated pneumatic postamputation mobility aid (PPAMA) during early rehabilitation. Primary (10 -meter walking velocity) and secondary clinical (number {{and duration of}} physiotherapy treatments during EWA/prosthesis use) and quality-of-life (SF- 36) outcome measures were recorded at five standardized assessment visits. Inter-group and intra-group analyses were performed. ResultsTwo hundred seventy-two patients were screened and 29 transtibial amputees (median age, 56 years) were recruited (14 /treatment arm). No significant difference was seen in demographics and comorbidities at baseline. Inter-group analysis: Median 10 -meter walking velocity was significantly (Mann-Whitney, P =. 020) faster in the PPAMA group (0. 245 m/s, interquartile range [IQR] 0. 218 - 0. 402 m/s) compared with the AMA group (0. 165 m/s; IQR, 0. 118 - 0. 265 m/s) at visit 1. However, {{there was no difference}} between the groups at any other visit. Similarly, the number of treatments using EWA was significantly (P =. 045) lower in the PPAMA group (5. 0; IQR, 3. 5 - 8. 0) compared with the AMA group (6. 0; IQR, 6. 0 - 10. 5). No difference was observed between the groups in duration of physiotherapy or SF- 36 domain and summary scores. Intra-group analysis: Both treatment groups showed significant improvement in 10 -meter walking velocity (Friedman test; AMA P =. 001; PPAMA P =. 007); however, other clinical outcomes did not show any statistically significant improvement. Only physical function domain of SF- 36 demonstrated significant improvement (Friedman test; AMA P =. 037; PPAMA P =. 029).

Wyzan), {{contains}} an empirical explo­ration of the nexus between {{variables related to}} the local public sector budget and migration. Micro-data is employed in binomial and multinomial-logit regressions esti­mating the probability to migrate. We report results separately for metropolitan and nonmetropolitan areas, because the per capita levels of the tax base and intergovernmen­tal grants are theoretically important migration determinants where population is sparse, while the tax rate {{may be more important}} where population is dense. Empirical results support our fiscal hypotheses and are consistent with previous findings on household characteristics. Paper [II]- Internal Gross Migration in Sweden: The effects of Variation in Mobility Grants and Regional Labour Market Conditions, focuses on the effects of labor market conditions and migratory stimuli on over county-border migration. Aggregate data on the flows of all migrants and on the flows of migrants <b>receiving</b> extra <b>mobility</b> stimuli are used in estimations of a single-equation migration model based on the hiring function. The results indicate that regional migration flows respond to changes in labor market conditions in accordance with predictions from economic theory. This result seems mainly to stem from the migratory behavior of the unemployed. In addition, nonmatching migration subsidies at the levels employed are not found to be migration enhancing. Paper [IH]- Employment Opportunities, Wages and Interregional Migration in Sweden 1970 - 1989, deals with the impact of aggregate labor turnover and regional labor market conditions on gross in- and outmigration. Annual panel data is used in estima­tion of separate in- and outmigration functions, where regional labor market conditions are assumed to be endogenous with migration under two different assumptions concer­ning the working of the labor market. An increase in the regional excess supply of labor is found to increase outmigration and decrease inmigration. Moreover, cyclical variation in labor turnover is positively correlated with gross migration. The hypothesized effects of real wages on migration are not confirmed. The results are not sensitive to the various assumptions concerning regional wage formation considered in this study. Paper [IV]- A Panel Study of Migration, Household Real Earnings and Self-Selec- tion (co-authored with Roger Axelsson). The effects of migration on household real earnings are examined. Data pertain to a sample of stable household constellations in Sweden, 1978 - 1991. A treatment-effect model is employed, whereby the potential effects of nonrandom sampling of data on earnings for migrants and nonmigrants are taken into account. We find that stable multi-adult household constellations did not gain in income from migration during the 1980 s. In addition, we find no strong indications of selection bias in the income equation. digitalisering@um...|$|R
40|$|A {{wireless}} ad hoc {{network is}} a sovereign {{system in which}} users can {{communicate with each other}} freely. It can be deployed rapidly at a very low cost, and can be easily managed and extended. Topology management has main objective to maintain a topology connectivity that improves wireless network performance by minimizing energy consumption. Also Topology control with cooperative communication was recently research initiated, Cooperative Communication (CC) is a technique that allows no. of nodes to simultaneously transmit the same data. It can save power and extend transmission coverage. Topology management with cooperative communication is new research initiated in the field of Mobile Ad-hoc Network. In this paper, we analyze the effect of multi-traffic on the topology managed MANET. We implemented some applications on different mobility models that is OLSR move and random mobility. To simulate all scenario OPNET 14. 5 software is used. OPNET is a comprehensive suite of tools for modelling large wired and wireless networks. It uses simulation and emulation to predict the behaviour and performance of networks to improve their design, operation and management. In the first part of paper, implemented the existed network on the OPNET simulator and evaluate the performance (Download Response Time, Traffic Send and Traffic Receive) of OLSR move based topology control network. In the second part of paper, evaluated the QoS performanc (Delay, Download Response Time, Traffic Send and Receive Response) of Random Mobility based topology control network. From the simulation results we observed that compare with OLSR move models, the Random mobility model performance is good. We implemented different traffic pattern on two Topology managed MANET. In the third part of paper, implemented the dynamic traffic pattern like Email, FTP & Voice and video conferencing on the proposed network. Simulation results show that FTP and E-mail both have large download response time in case of OLSR move model rather than Random Mobility model. Traffic send and receive performance of email is good in OLSR-move model. Video Conferencing has good response of traffic send and <b>receive</b> in Random <b>Mobility</b> model...|$|R
