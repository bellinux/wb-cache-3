25|$|An {{alternative}} method to hatcheries {{is to use}} spawning channels. These are artificial streams, usually parallel to an existing stream, with concrete or <b>rip-rap</b> sides and gravel bottoms. Water from the adjacent stream is piped {{into the top of}} the channel, sometimes via a header pond, to settle out sediment. Spawning success is often much better in channels than in adjacent streams due to the control of floods, which in some years can wash out the natural redds. Because of the lack of floods, spawning channels must sometimes be cleaned out to remove accumulated sediment. The same floods that destroy natural redds also clean the regular streams. Spawning channels preserve the natural selection of natural streams, as there is no benefit, as in hatcheries, to use prophylactic chemicals to control diseases.|$|E
25|$|The {{building}} {{was designed by}} the well-known architectural firm Munselle Brown Partnership Inc. of San Francisco, who were selected after winning an invited design competition, and Architects of Record, DES Architects + Engineers, Inc. as a Class A office building. Peter Munselle of the Munselle Brown Partnership prepared the winning architectural design concept. Theodore Brown served as Partner in Charge for Munselle/Brown, and Bob Giannini was the principal architect for DES. The {{building was}} completed in 1986, commissioned by the Dakin Company, being constructed by the Koll company. It is entirely steel frame in construction supported by driven piles up to 140 feet (43 m) in depth into the bay mud. A dedicated trail for hikers is established {{to conform to the}} San Francisco Bay perimeter master trail plan; large boulders and <b>rip-rap</b> are placed below the trail to prevent wave action erosion. The landscape architect for the original design was Royston, Hanamoto, Alley and Abey of San Francisco.|$|E

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references (leaves 41 - 47). Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The littoral zone of an East Texas reservoir was surveyed to determine if any characteristic fish assemblages were associated with four different habitat types with varying levels of structural complexity. A stratified random sampling design was used to select four sampling sites each from vegetated, understated, <b>rip-rapped</b> and bulkheaded shorelines. Each site was sampled seasonally for one year. Sites were surrounded by a block net and electrofished exhaustively. Seasonal and spatial differences in biomass, abundance, species richness and diversity were detected. Biomass and abundance were highest in spring, lowest in winter and intermediate in summer and fall. Species richness was lower in winter than in all other seasons, and diversity did not vary among seasons. Biomass was higher in <b>rip-rapped</b> habitat than in bulkhead and unvegetated habitat, but not higher than in vegetated habitat. Biomass was higher in both vegetated and bulkheaded habitat than in unvegetated habitat. Abundance did not vary across habitats. Species richness and diversity were higher in <b>rip-rapped</b> and vegetated habitat than in unvegetated and bulkheaded habitat. characteristic assemblages were identified among the four habitat types using multivariate ordination techniques. These results can be used to develop management strategies related to shoreline development projects and their effects on fish habitat...|$|R
50|$|Moline New City Lake {{is located}} in the scenic Osage Questas region in {{southeast}} Kansas just one mile north of Moline. Native tall grass prairie comprises most of the lake's 4,742 acre drainage basin and helps maintain the average 36 inches of water transparency. The lake is located one and one-half miles north of the city of Moline. Construction of the lake was completed on February 18, 1983 for the purposes of flood control, civic water supply, and recreation. The city of Moline still uses the lake as its primary water supply. The 185 acre lake is surrounded by 257 acres of city owned and managed property. Improvements at the lake include a paved boat ramp, boat loading dock, five shelter houses, handicapped accessible outhouse, five earthen and <b>rip-rapped</b> fishing piers.|$|R
2500|$|North of the {{developed}} area of Rockaway Beach is a hidden quarry, whose habitat is severely disturbed. [...] <b>Rip-rap</b> boulders protect {{the developed}} area from marine erosion. [...] Near Calera creek there is aquatic vegetation including rushes, bulrushes, horsetail, fat hen, and plantain.

50|$|Alameda Creek is {{considered}} a potential ‘anchor watershed’ for steelhead, regionally significant for restoration of the threatened trout to the entire Bay Area, although by the late 1950s the California Department of Fish and Game decided the steelhead run was no longer viable due to numerous man-made barriers to fish runs. By the early 1970s the Army Corps of Engineers channeled and <b>rip-rapped</b> the lower 12 mi of the creek. The last steelhead and coho salmon runs were seen in the lower creek in 1964. In 2009, the Alameda County Water District removed a rubber dam that blocked trout passage in the lower creek, adjacent to Quarry Lakes Regional Park. In June, 2010 environmentalists and water district officials celebrated the removal of a dam on Alameda Creek in Fremont, and the planned installation of fish ladders to allow salmonids to bypass two other dams on the lower creek. At the same time, PG&E is working to modify a cement barrier farther upstream in Sunol to help steelhead swim farther into the watershed, water officials said. When those projects are completed, steelhead {{will be able to}} migrate upstream to spawning habitats in the Sunol Valley {{for the first time in}} a half-century.|$|R
40|$|An {{assessment}} of the geological and geotechnical parameters as causative agents {{in the formation of}} gullies in Wuro Bayare area of northeastern Nigeria is presented. Field geological study of the study area revealed that the area is underlain by basement rocks. The soils in the area are product of in-situ weathering of the underlying basement rocks. The results of sieve analysis shows that the soils at the gully sites have sorting values ranging between 0. 42 and 2. 3, coefficient of uniformity values ranging between 0. 02 and 200, coefficient of curvature values ranging between 0. 0125 and 0. 23 and also the constanthydraulic values (Kvalues) is use to know the bottom erosion ranges. These indicate that the soils are poorly to well-sorted in places. The plasticity indices values ranges between 9. 9 and 5. 5 with a mean value of about 20 indicates soils of moderate to highly plasticity, slight dry strength and easily friable. Values of Maximum Dry Density (MDD) ranging between 2. 15 and 1. 83 g/cm 3 at Optimum Moisture Contents (OMC) of between 12. 4 and 6. 4 % reveals that the soils were generally lose. From the geotechnical analysis results, commendations for erosions control such as; construction of drainages, grouting concrete <b>rip-raps</b> and afforestation were suggested...|$|R
40|$|The {{extensive}} anthropogenic armoring of {{the shoreline}} in California changes the substrate available to settling invertebrate larvae and algal spores that are passively {{distributed in the}} ocean currents. Rock types available to settlers likely influences community structure in the intertidal, as rock characteristics {{have been shown to}} favor or inhibit settlement. Much research has been done examining the mechanisms that determine intertidal community patterns, but the role of rock type has been largely neglected. My goals are to: 1) determine the structure of community assemblages occurring on different rock types, 2) examine the mechanisms responsible for any differences, and 3) link the community structure patterns to life history characteristics of selected species. I have conducted two studies—the first comparing two sites with armored, <b>rip-rapped</b> shorelines (Chapter 2) and the second using settlement plates at two sites with different bedrock within Monterey Bay, California (Chapters 3 and 4). The intertidal community structure on the armored rocks and settling plates shows different patterns for certain species distributions that warrant further examination. These studies will help in predicting how continued armoring of the shoreline will affect species assemblages, as well as enhancing our understanding of variation in intertidal community assemblages at different sites along the coast...|$|R

40|$|An {{assessment}} of the hydrogeological and geotechnical properties as agents in the formation and expansion of gullies in Gombi area is presented. Field geological study of the area revealed that it is underlain by basement complex rocks. The soils are products of in-situ weathering of the underlain basement complex rocks. Results of sieves analysis show that the soils at the gully sites have sorting values ranging between 0. 42 and 2. 3, coefficient of uniformity values ranging between 3. 0 and 10, and the coefficient of curvature values ranging between 0. 2 and 1. 3. These indicate that the soils are poorly to well sorted in places. The plasticity indices values ranging between 11. 0 and 29 with mean value of about 20 indicate soils of moderate to high plasticity, slight dry strength and easily friable. Values of maximum dry density ranges between 1. 83 g/cm 3 and 2. 09 g/cm 3 at optimum moisture contents of between 7. 4 % and 11. 3 % reveals that the soils were generally loose. The hydraulic conductivity and transmissivity values as determined from statistical grain size method range between 3. 8 × 10 - 4 cm/s to 6. 4 × 102 cm/s and 3. 8 × 10 - 2 cm 2 /s to 9. 6 × 104 cm 2 respectively. These indicate moderate seepage fluxes and adverse pore pressures and are thus easily erodible. From the geotechnical analysis results, recommendations for erosion control such as aforestration, construction of drainages and concrete <b>rip-raps</b> were suggested.

5000|$|On 21 November 1652 Old Style, 1 December New Style, Lieutenant-Admiral Maarten Tromp, again (unofficial) supreme {{commander}} {{after his}} successor Vice-Admiral Witte de With {{had suffered a}} breakdown because of his defeat at the Battle of the Kentish Knock, set sail from the naval port of Hellevoetsluis with 88 men of war and five fireships, escorting a vast convoy of 270 merchantmen bound for France, the Mediterranean and the Indies. At first, unfavourable southwestern gales forced him to return but on 23 November he again sailed south. With the convoy, accompanied by sixteen warships, safely delivered through the Straits of Dover, Tromp turned to the west {{in search of the}} English, and on 29 November 1652 he discovered the English fleet of 42 capital ships and ten smaller vessels anchored in the Downs, between the landheads of North Foreland and South Foreland, commanded by General at Sea Robert Blake. After a council of war in which it was decided to avoid battle, the English promptly left their anchorage, sailing south. Blake may have not realized how large the Dutch fleet was, or he may have feared to become trapped like the Spanish had some years earlier in the Battle of the Downs. The wind was now strong from the northwest, so the English could not return to the Downs in any case, having to settle for Dover. The English fleet swiftly rounded South Foreland while the Dutch were unable to reach them, both fleets anchoring in the evening at about five miles distance. During the night a storm dispersed some Dutch vessels. Next morning, at noon the two fleets began to move southwest, with the English hugging the coast and the Dutch keeping some distance. The forces were separated by the <b>Rip-Raps</b> and the Varne Shoal and therefore unable to engage. Ultimately the curve of the shoreline, the cape of Dungeness or the [...] "Hook of the Shingles" [...] jutting out, forced the English to turn on a southerly course. Between the Varne Shoal and Dungeness a narrow exit exists. Blake had hoped to escape through it but when he arrived already about seventeen Dutch ships were waiting for him. Nevertheless, he continued his manoeuvre. At about 15:00, the leading ships of both fleets met in what a contemporary account called a [...] "bounteous rhetoric of powder and bullet".|$|R
