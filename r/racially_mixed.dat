25|$|Though racism {{among the}} {{residents}} of Ybor City was not generally an issue, it was situated in the American Deep South {{in the era of}} Jim Crow, so its organizations had to follow the segregationist laws of Tampa.

25|$|Under McKay's administration, the LDS Church's {{stance on}} Africans holding the priesthood was softened.

This policy improved proselytizing in <b>racially</b> <b>mixed</b> areas, such as South America and South Africa.

This study examined LUTS among a <b>racially</b> over-sampled, <b>mixed</b> urban/rural, elderly cohort of African Americans and {{whites in the}} South to discern whether racial differences exist in the prevalence, severity, and associated risk factors of LUTS. Longitudinal analyses using generalized estimating equations (GEE) were conducted on the 1994 – 1998 EPESE dataset for 5 North Carolina counties. In 1994, the analytic cohort included 482 African Americans and 407 whites; by 1998, 249 and 222, respectively. In 1994, 49. 4 % of African Americans reported LUTS compared to 56. 8 % of whites. By 1998, percentages increased to 60. 6 % and 70. 3 %, respectively. LUTS was associated with being African American, married, having poor health status and disability, delaying care quite often, being {{in a nursing home}} or in a rural area, and having a male physician...|$|R

25|$|Because of the {{acceptance}} of miscegenation, Brazil has avoided the binary polarization of society into black and white. In addition, it abolished slavery without a civil war. The bitter and sometimes violent racial tensions that have divided the US are notably absent in Brazil. According to the 2010 census, 6.7% of Brazilians said they were black, compared with 6.2% in 2000, and 43.1% said they were <b>racially</b> <b>mixed,</b> up from 38.5%. In 2010, Elio Ferreira de Araujo, Brazil's minister for racial equality, attributed the increases to growing pride among his country's black and indigenous communities.|$|E

25|$|White {{flight is}} a term that {{originated}} in the United States, starting in the 1950s and 1960s, and applied to the large-scale migration of people of various European ancestries from <b>racially</b> <b>mixed</b> urban regions to more racially homogeneous suburban or exurban regions.

25|$|During this time, Joplin {{created an}} opera company of 30 people and {{produced}} his first opera A Guest of Honor {{for a national}} tour.

Joplin could not meet the company's payroll or pay for its lodgings at a theatrical boarding house. It is believed that the score for A Guest of Honor was lost and perhaps destroyed because of non-payment of the company's boarding house bill.|$|E

25|$|Destructive as they were, raiding expeditions were lesser {{problems}} than other threats. Beginning in the 17th century, English efforts to plant colonies along the Caribbean coast {{and in the}} Islas de la Bahía threatened to cut Honduras off from the Caribbean and {{raised the possibility of}} the loss of much of its territory. The English effort on the Honduran coast was heavily dependent on the support of groups known as the Zambo and the Miskito, <b>racially</b> <b>mixed</b> peoples of Native American and African ancestry who were usually more than willing to attack Spanish settlements. British settlers were interested largely in trading, lumbering, and producing pitch. During the numerous 18th-century wars between Britain and Spain, however, the British crown found any activity that challenged Spanish hegemony on the Caribbean coast of Central America to be desirable.|$|E

At independence, Mauritania's estimated 1.5 to 1.8 million people could be divided into three groups: one-third of the inhabitants were both racially and ethnically Maures; another third, although <b>racially</b> black or <b>mixed</b> Maure-black, were ethnically Maures (this group of black Maures was essentially a slave class until 1980, when slavery was abolished); and the remaining third were racially and ethnically black, resembling in many respects the populations in neighboring Senegal and Mali.|$|R

25|$|The {{application}} of the term Mestizo (lit. mixed) has changed over time. The word was originally used in the colonial era to refer to individuals who were of half-Spanish and half-indigenous American ancestry. It {{was one of the}} many extant castes used to classify individuals. Once Mexico achieved its independence, the casta system was abandoned and mestizo was used to refer to all the people who were mixed race. After the Mexican Revolution, the term became cultural and was used to refer to the segment of the Mexican population who did not speak indigenous languages. The term mestizo thus became a cultural identity that grouped <b>racially</b> <b>mixed</b> people (including African and Asian ancestry) and unmixed individuals with a mestizo culture. This change of definition was the product of an ideology known as “mestizaje” which was promoted by the early post-Revolution government, seeking to create a unified Mexican identity with no racial distinctions. The advent of DNA sequencing since then has allowed for the study of Mexico's mestizo population.|$|E
25|$|After {{three days}} of arson and looting, 3,767 {{buildings}} were burned with over $1 billion in property damage.

Many organizations stepped forward to rebuild Los Angeles; South Central's Operation Hope and Koreatown's Saigu and KCCD (Korean Churches for Community Development), all raised millions to repair destruction and improve economic development. President George H.W.

25|$|In 1975, Tutu was {{nominated}} {{to be the}} new Bishop of Johannesburg, although lost out to Timothy Bavin. Bavin suggested that Tutu take his newly vacated position, that of the dean of St Mary's Cathedral, Johannesburg. Tutu was elected to this position—the fourth highest in South Africa's Anglican hierarchy—in March 1975, becoming the first black man to do so, an appointment making headline news in South Africa. Tutu decided to return to South Africa, a decision opposed by Leah, resulting in a strain on their marriage. Tutu was officially installed as dean in an August 1975 ceremony. The cathedral was packed for the event; in attendance was the TEF's chairman, Archibishop Karekin Sarkissian of the Armenian Orthodox Church. Moving to the city, Tutu lived not in the official dean's residence in the white suburb of Houghton but rather in a middle-class street in the Orlando West township of Soweto, a largely impoverished area for blacks. The cathedral's congregation was <b>racially</b> <b>mixed</b> but with a white majority; this mixing gave Tutu hope that a racially equal, de-segregated future was possible for South Africa. He attempted to modernise the liturgies used by the cathedral's congregation although found that this was not desired by most. He also divided opinion among the congregation for his support of the ordination of women and for replacing masculine pronouns with gender neutral ones in his sermons and liturgy.|$|E

This study assessed and compared the beliefs, attitudes, and rates of participation regarding organ donation among a sample of <b>racially</b> and ethnically <b>mixed</b> university students. A 64 -item survey questionnaire regarding organ/tissue donation issues was administered to 683 undergraduate students from different racial and ethnic backgrounds at a state-assisted university in the Midwest. The findings from the study indicated that African-American students differ significantly from white students in their attitudes and beliefs toward organ donation, while Asian-American, Hispanic, and international students were similar to white students in their attitudes and beliefs regarding organ donation.

With the dismantling of apartheid, South Africa’s core cultural framework and hierarchy shifted, and concurrently, so too did society’s understanding of racial and cultural identities. Issues of group membership, race and identity have become more personal affairs and less driven by state policies and rhetoric.
