5|$|A <b>river</b> <b>is</b> {{a natural}} watercourse, usually freshwater, flowing toward an ocean, a lake, a sea or another river. In a few cases, a river simply {{flows into the}} ground or dries up {{completely}} before reaching another body of water. Small rivers may also be called by several other names, including stream, creek, brook, rivulet, and rill; there is no general rule that defines what can be called a river. Many names for small rivers are specific to geographic location; one example is Burn in Scotland and North-east England. Sometimes a <b>river</b> <b>is</b> said to be larger than a creek, {{but this is not}} always the case, due to vagueness in the language. A <b>river</b> <b>is</b> part of the hydrological cycle. Water within a <b>river</b> <b>is</b> generally collected from precipitation through surface runoff, groundwater recharge, springs, and the release of stored water in natural ice and snowpacks (i.e., from glaciers).|$|E
5|$|Some 700 metres below Pulteney weir, the <b>river</b> <b>is</b> {{joined by}} the Kennet and Avon Canal which connects through Bath Locks. Together with the Kennet Navigation which joins the River Thames at Reading, this {{provides}} a through route for canal boats from Bristol to London. From this point downstream the <b>river</b> <b>is</b> known as the Avon Navigation.|$|E
5|$|The Dzong {{is located}} at the {{confluence}} of the Pho Chhu (father) and Mo Chhu (mother) rivers in the PunakhaWangdue valley. The source of the Mo chu <b>river</b> <b>is</b> in the northern hills of Lighsi and Laya in Bhutan, and in Tibet. The Po Chu <b>River</b> <b>is</b> fed by glaciers in the Lunana region of the Punakha valley. After the confluence of these two rivers, the main <b>river</b> <b>is</b> known as Puna Tsang chu or Sankosh River and flows down through Wangdue Phodrang, crosses the BhutanIndia border at Kalikhola and eventually meets the Brahmaputra River.|$|E

5000|$|Although this <b>river</b> <b>was</b> {{used as a}} vital trade route by First Nations, in {{particular}} the coastal Tlingit people, the first Europeans to travel the present-day Tatshenshini <b>River</b> <b>were</b> Jack Dalton and Edward Glave in 1890, accompanied by two native guides. Prior to 1891, the present-day Tatshenshini <b>River</b> <b>was</b> {{considered to be the}} upper Alsek River. [...] (At that time, the present-day upper Alsek <b>River</b> <b>was</b> considered to be the lower Kaskawulsh River.) In or about 1891, the present-day Tatshenshini River (pre-1891 upper Alsek <b>River)</b> <b>was</b> assigned the name Tatshenshini by the Canadian government, and the pre-1891 lower Kaskawulsh River became the present-day upper Alsek River.|$|R

25|$|The main {{rivers that}} flow entirely inside Lebanon are the Litani river (average annual flow of 0.79 million cubic meter), the Ibrahim River (0.51), the Awali River and the Damour River (both 0.3). A {{large share of}} the Litani <b>River</b> <b>is</b> {{diverted}} through the Markaba tunnel for hydropower generation to the Awali River. Since the upper watershed of the Litani <b>River</b> <b>is</b> polluted and the Awali <b>River</b> <b>is</b> due to be tapped {{as a source of}} drinking water supply for Beirut, this water transfer has implications beyond its intended use for hydropower generation.|$|E

30|$|From the Piper plots (Fig.  2) it was {{revealed}} that six of the <b>rivers</b> <b>were</b> generally Na–HCO 3 water type and one <b>river</b> <b>was</b> Ca–Cl–HCO 3 water type. The Na–HCO 3 water type confirms the interaction of the six rivers with the rocks whereas the Ca–Cl–HCO 3 water type for the remaining one <b>river</b> <b>was</b> likely linked to evaporation.|$|R
