Twelve patients (5 women and 7 men; mean age 70. 1 years) {{were enrolled in}} this study, and their <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure levels were determined by indirect calorimetry. In these patients, a significant correlation was observed between the measured <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditures and the predicted <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditures calculated by the Harris-Benedict equation. The <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditures measured before surgery were almost {{the same as the}} predicted <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditures (measured <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure: 22. 4  ±  3. 9  kcal/kg/day vs predicted <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure: 21. 7  ±  2. 0  kcal/kg/day). The measured <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure/predicted <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure ratio, which reflects the stress factor, was 1. 02  ±  0. 10. After the pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy, a significant increase in energy expenditure was observed, and the measured <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure was 25. 7  ±  3. 5  kcal/kg/day on postoperative day 7 and 25. 4  ±  4. 9  kcal/kg/day on postoperative day 14.

In conclusion, patients undergoing a pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy showed a hyper-metabolic status as evaluated by their measured <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure/predicted <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure ratio. From our observations, we recommend that nutritional management based on 30  kcal/body weight/day (calculated by the measured <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure×activity factor 1. 2 – 1. 3) may be optimal for patients undergoing a pylorus preserving pancreatoduodenectomy...|$|R

We investigated {{whether there is a}} difference in <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure between 26 vegetarians and 26 non-vegetarians and the correlation between some nutritional factors and inflammatory markers with <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure. In this cross-sectional study, vegetarians and non-vegetarians were matched by age, body mass index and gender. All underwent instrumental examinations to assess the difference in body composition, nutrient intake and <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure. Biochemical analyses and 12 different cytokines and growth factors were measured as an index of inflammatory state. A higher <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure was found in vegetarians than in non-vegetarians (p = 0. 008). Furthermore, a higher energy from diet, fibre, vegetable fats intake and interleukin-β (IL- 1 β) was found between the groups. In the univariate and multivariable analysis, <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure was associated with vegetarian diet, free-fat mass and vegetable fats (p < 0. 001; Slope in statistic (B) = 4. 8; β = 0. 42).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To compare {{measured}} <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure to <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure predicted {{from eight}} published prediction equations {{in a sample}} of patients with pancreatic cancer. DESIGN: Cross-sectional study. SETTING: Ambulatory patients of a tertiary private hospital. PARTICIPANTS: Eight patients with pancreatic cancer (5 males, 3 females; age: 62. 0 +/- 5. 2 years; BMI: 24. 4 +/- 3. 2 kg/m 2; weight loss: 12. 1 +/- 6. 0 %; mean+/- SD). METHODS: <b>Resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure was measured using indirect calorimetry and predicted from eight published prediction methods (Harris-Benedict with no injury factor, Harris-Benedict with 1. 3 injury factor, Schofield, Owen, Mifflin, Cunningham, and Wang equations and the 20 kcal/kg ratio). Body composition was assessed by deuterium oxide dilution technique. Statistical analysis was performed by using the method of Bland and Altman, and the Student's t-test. RESULTS: The Harris-Benedict equations with an injury factor of 1. 3 resulted in a significantly higher mean predicted <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure compared to measured <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure, while {{there was no significant difference}} between mean measured and predicted <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure and the other 7 methods. At an individual level, the limits of agreement are wide for all equations. The best combination of low bias and narrowest limits of agreement was observed in the prediction of <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure from the Wang equation (based on fat free mass) and the Harris-Benedict equation (based on weight and height). CONCLUSION: At a group level, there is agreement between mean measured and predicted <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure with the exception of the Harris-Benedict equation with an injury factor of 1. 3. The results of this pilot study suggest that, for an individual, the limits of agreement are wide, and clinically important differences in <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure would be obtained.

Design: Prospective, validation study. Setting: Eighteen-bed, medical intensive care unit at a teaching hospital. Patients: All adult patients intubated > 24 hrs were assessed for eligibility. Exclusion criteria were clinical situations that could contribute to erroneous calorimetric measurements. Interventions: <b>Resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure was calculated using the original Harris-Benedict equations and those corrected for usual stress factors, the Swinamer equation, the Fusco equation, the Ireton-Jones equation, and our equation: <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure (kcal/day) = 8 × weight (kg) + 14 × height (cm) + 32 × minute ventilation (L/min) + 94 × temperature (°C) − 4834. Measurements and Main Results: <b>Resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure was measured by indirect calorimetry for the 45 included patients. <b>Resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure calculated with our predictive model correlated with the measured <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure (r 2 =. 62, p <. 0001), and Bland-Altman analysis showed a mean bias of − 192 ± 277 kcal/day, with limits of agreement ranging from − 735 to 351 kcal/day. <b>Resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure calculated with the Harris-Benedict equations was more weakly correlated with measured <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure (r 2 =. 41, p <. 0001), with Bland-Altman analysis showing a mean bias of 279 ± 346 kcal/day {{between them and the}} limits of agreement ranging from − 399 to 957 kcal/day. Applying usual stress-correction factors to the Harris-Benedict equations generated wide variability, and the correlation with measured <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure was poorer (r 2 =. 18, p <. 0001), with Bland-Altman analysis showing a mean bias of − 357 ± 750 kcal/day and limits of agreement ranging from − 1827 to 1113 kcal/day. The use of the Swinamer, Fusco, or Ireton-Jones predictive methods yielded weaker correlation between calculated and measured <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure (r 2 =. 41, p <. 0001; r 2 =. 38, p <. 0001; r 2 =. 39, p <. 0001, respectively) than our equation, and Bland-Altman analysis showed no improvement in agreement and variability between methods.

Methods:This was a prospective study that included ten obese women with body mass index greater than 40 kg/m 2 and aged between 20 - 50 years. The participants were hospitalized for eight days and received a controlled conventional low-calorie diet, 1200 kcal/day, for seven days. Body weight, body mass index, abdominal circumference, body composition, <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure, and substrate oxidation rate were evaluated at the beginning and at the end of the study.

ResultsPatients with critical limb ischemia had a lower <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure than patients with intermittent claudication (1429 ± 190 kcal/day vs 1563 ± 229 kcal/day; P =. 004), and higher body fat percentage (34. 8 ± 7. 8 % vs 31. 5 ± 7. 8 %; P =. 037), higher fat mass (30. 0 ± 9. 3 kg vs 26. 2 ± 8. 9 kg;P =. 016), and lower ABI (0. 31 ± 0. 11 vs 0. 79 ± 0. 23; P <. 001). <b>Resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure was predicted by fat free mass (P <. 0001), age (P <. 0001), ABI (P <. 0001), ethnicity (P <. 0001), calf blood flow (P =. 005), and diabetes (P =. 008). <b>Resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure remained lower in the patients with critical limb ischemia after adjusting for clinical characteristics plus fat free mass (1473 ± 27. 8 kcal/day [mean ± SEM] vs 1527 ± 19. 3 kcal/day; P =. 031), but it was no longer different between groups after further adjustment for ABI and calf blood flow (1494 ± 25. 2 kcal/day vs 1505 ± 17. 7 kcal/day; P =. 269).

Hypothermia reduces oxygen consumption and, as a consequence, decreases <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure. In patients for whom chronic hypothermia is a problem, nutritional intake must be adjusted to prevent overfeeding, excessive weight gain, and the long-term complications of an excess of total calories...|$|R

An increase in <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure would have a great impact on total energy expenditure. This study shows that classical music do not influence <b>resting</b> <b>energy</b> expenditure compared to complete silence. Further studies should be performed including other genres of music and other types of stress-inductors than music...|$|R
