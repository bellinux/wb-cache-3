40|$|<b>Punch</b> <b>riveting</b> {{with solid}} rivets is an {{admitted}} technology in joining by forming of metallic workpieces. Conventional this technology workes with a rigid anvil. This causes {{the disadvantage of}} dimensioning {{the width of the}} coining ring separately for every single joining task to avoid a prematurely coining during the stamping stage. Additional the operating range of solid <b>punch</b> <b>riveting</b> is restricted by the process forces, the specific material requirements and the deformation of the sheets due to the joining process. The starting point for improvement respectively for the removal of these negative properties is the two-parted design of the anvil. Thus there can be realized a plane surface of coining ring and anvil ring during the stamping process. So an equal coining ring can be used for all joining tasks. In this research project the attributes of partitioned anvils in comparison with the state-of-the-art anvil were investigated. For that the M-Anvil (lower the anvil ring after stamping) and the P-Anvil (pre-tensioned anvil ring) were tested. The analyses show the advantages of the partitioned anvils especially in joining of different materials with distinct differences in strength. Referring to the process forces the conventional joining direction "soft in firm" is adverse. Through the realisation of distinctly smaller coining rings by using the partioned anvils clear benefits in process forces and deformation with the joining direction "firm in soft" can be generated. The strength of the joints made with the two-parted anvils and the conventional anvil are equal. Another advantage ist the universal use of the new anvils above all by the use of multi-zone <b>punch</b> <b>rivets.</b> Regarding this the geometry of the rivets should be improved particularly for equal required coining depth and the avoidance of the described demolition problem. The use of two-parted anvils effects essential convenient technological conditions and an extended range of application of solid <b>punch</b> <b>riveting.</b> Especially the M-Anvil is characterized by a huge reduction of process forces. The more expansive tools of the system "two-parted anvil" will be relativized by the technological benefit of this technology...|$|R

"Includes bibliographic {{references}} (leaves 74 - 78) Hydroforming {{of aluminum}} sheets {{is very important}} in the aircraft industry, due to the advantages of less wrinkling and cost effectiveness. Numerous research has been conducted in this field, which deals with the development of methods and tools to control accuracy of the bend and prediction of the springback after the sheet metal has been formed. Rivets are the most commonly used fasteners to fit together the subassemblies of the aircraft. The holes for <b>riveting</b> are <b>punched</b> after any forming operation due to the tensile and compressive deformations along the thickness of the sheet metal, which can affect the dimension and position accuracy of the hole. This incurs more cost and time due to the development of special dies for accurately punched holes. It is necessary to develop a method for predicting variation in the holes, which will increase the cost effectiveness of the process. In this research, sheet metal with pre-drilled holes was evaluated for a bending operation using a hydroforming technique. Sheet metal with a variety of thicknesses, bending radii, and bending angles was evaluated. Variation in the dimensional tolerance was attained using the minimum radial separation method. A dataset of dimensional variation in the holes was developed and used for development of the artificial neural network, which was able to predict the dimensional variation of the hole if an unknown pattern of inputs was provided. This study presents the prediction of the dimensional variation of holes due to sheet metal bending using the hydroforming technique...|$|R
40|$|In this article, the {{possibilities}} for improving the joining process of self piercing solid rivets and self piercing nuts by increasing tool velocity are demonstrated. Thereby, the focus is put on the joining process of high strength steel sheets. Proper and reliable joining of these steels presents a major challenge for mechanical joining techniques. In the conventional joining process, where tool velocities well below 1 m/s are common, different problems during the joining process caused by the high strength of the steel sheets can occur. At the <b>punch</b> <b>riveting</b> process undesirable material flow or unwanted burr development can occur, and at the setting process of self piercing nuts a deformation of the nuts is possible. These problems can be reduced significantly by using elevated tool velocity. In the present paper, characteristics of the joining process at conventional and elevated tool velocity are investigated. The influence caused by different tool velocities within the joining process is shown by cross section- and process force analysis. In the cross section analysis of the mechanical joints it is demonstrated {{that the quality of}} connections can be improved significantly due to the usage of elevated tool velocity.

40|$|Abstract. Recently, {{the need}} for the light weight {{vehicles}} that are capable of providing high performance at lower fuel consumption has become apparent. A number of new joining techniques that can overcome the difficulties encountered when the resistance spot welding is used to weld the aluminium sheet, the major material in the body structure of the light weight vehicle, are developed. Selfpiercing riveting (SPR), one of the new joining methods, offers a number of benefits and becomes the main joining method for the aluminium car. Self-piercing rivets are semi-tubular <b>rivets</b> that are <b>punched</b> into two or more substrates to form a mechanically fastened joint. Self-piercing rivets are to be used for the construction of the aluminium car body structures in much the same manner as resistance spotwelds are used. The paper presents a new method for non-destructive assessing quality of SPRs using ultrasound. A rivet is inspected by sending an ultrasonic continuous wave using a differential piezoelectric transducer operating at a predetermined frequency. The transducer is provided with a waveguide that is acoustically coupled to the rivet head. The rivet quality is evaluated by monitoring variations in transducer’s electrical impedance represented by both the phase and the amplitude displayed in the complex impedance plane. The difference between the impedance corresponding to the inspected rivet and the predetermined scatter of values corresponding to sound rivets is monitored. 1...|$|R

This joining technology can {{solve the problems of}} oblique rivet and incorrect rivet position which are usually found in the SPR with a pipe rivet. The lap shear strength of the joint with a flange pipe rivet is higher than that of a joint with a conventional rivet. In this research, a flange pipe rivet was placed between two sheets with a force applied to the top sheet by a <b>punch</b> <b>riveting</b> machine. The flange pipe rivet moved downward along with the top sheet to induce appropriate bending and form a mechanical interlock in both sheets. Finite element (FE) analysis of the SPR with a flange pipe rivet was done by DEFORM software.

Simultaneously, some riveting experiments on joining aluminum sheets were conducted taking into consideration different rivet heights and chamfer angles.

40|$|In {{the present}} paper the {{influence}} of a higher setting velocity in the joining process of self piercing solid-rivets is shown. In the conventional process tool velocities well below 1 m/s are common. The present research results show the potential of increasing them in the range of about 5 m/s. The results are especially relevant for joining high-strength steels. These steel sheets often cause problems in the process of riveting mixed materials, e. g. aluminium-steel compound. The high strength of the steel sometimes leads to undesirable material flow in the joining process or unwanted burr development. These effects, which are described in detail in the article, can be reduced significantly for the investigated cases by the use of higher tool velocities. Using a high speed camera and a load cell, a test setup based on a drop tower was realized. It was used to time the force signals and the motion profile of the high speed riveting process. The results of the force analysis show an oscillating force progression. Within a numerical research the principal effects influencing the results of the riveting process can be shown. It was found that the pulse-like force transmission between <b>riveting</b> machine and <b>punch,</b> results in various vibrations especially of long and thin tool parts. Hence the rivet penetrates the sheet metal with non-uniform velocities.
