The algebra D_n arises as a quantum cluster chart {{on a certain}} quantum character variety associated to a <b>marked</b> punctured <b>disk.</b> We obtain {{a description of the}} coproduct of U_q(sl_n+ 1) in terms of a quantum character variety associated to the <b>marked</b> twice punctured <b>disk,</b> and express the action of the R-matrix in terms of a mapping class group element corresponding to the half-Dehn twist rotating one puncture about the other. As a consequence, we realize the algebra automorphism of U_q(sl_n+ 1) given by conjugation by the R-matrix as an explicit sequence of cluster mutations, and derive a refined factorization of the R-matrix into quantum dilogarithms of cluster monomials.

40|$|International Conference on Intelligent Information Hiding and Multimedia Signal Processing, IIH-MSP 2017. Matsue, Japan, 12 - 15 August 2017. We {{propose a}} {{watermarking}} method using scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT) features that have both scale and rotation in-variance, and evaluate our method {{in accordance with}} the information hiding criteria (IHC) ver. 5. It is dened as evaluation criteria against several possible attacks; these attacks are JPEG compression and geometric attacks, e. g., scaling, rotation, and clipping. In our method, we use local feature regions located around the SIFT features that are robust against scaling and rotation. The regions are normalized in size and selected as marked regions. Watermarks are embedded in the marked regions. We also introduce two error-correction techniques: weighted majority voting (WMV) and low-density parity-check (LDPC) code. When a stego-image is attacked by scaling or rotation, the image is spatially distorted. WMV and LDPC code can correct errors of extracted watermarks in the distorted stego-image. On the other hand, {{it is not easy to}} detect <b>rotated</b> <b>marked</b> regions. Therefore, the correct orientation is searched for by brute force. We evaluated the proposed method in accordance with IHC ver. 5. Our method can achieve robustness against scaling and rotation attacks in the highest tolerance category...|$|R
50|$|Care must {{be taken}} to assure that a found disk is the one {{described}} on the data sheet, so as to avoid false reports. A reference mark may be mistakenly reported as the station <b>mark.</b> A <b>disk</b> set in 1945 may be confused with a similarly named disk that was set in 1946 by a different agency, and so on.

5000|$|In the U.S., {{a survey}} disk is usually {{engraved}} {{with the name}} of the agency that placed it. The name of the mark (or the [...] "station" [...] it locates) is usually stamped into its surface, along with the date on which it was set (or re-set, since markers that have been destroyed can be replaced). <b>Disks</b> <b>marked</b> with a triangle are known as [...] "triangulation station disks," [...] since they mark the position of the primary point used for triangulation (or map-making). <b>Disks</b> <b>marked</b> with an arrow are called reference marks (RMs), since they point (or [...] "refer") to the principal station that may be located many feet away. A triangulation station often had two or three reference marks. Reference marks were set to enable the primary station to be re-established (or re-set) if needed.|$|R

5000|$|Triangulation points, {{also known}} as trig points, are marks with a {{precisely}} established horizontal position. These points may be <b>marked</b> by <b>disks</b> similar to benchmark disks, but set horizontally, and are also sometimes used as elevation benchmarks. Prominent features on buildings such as {{the tip of a}} church spire or a chimney stack are also used as reference points for triangulation. In the United Kingdom triangulation points are often set in large concrete markers that, as well as functioning as triangulation points, have a benchmark set into the side. With the increasing use of GPS and electronic distance measuring devices, the same techniques and equipment are used to fix the horizontal and vertical position of a survey marker at the same moment, and therefore the marks are usually regarded as [...] "fixed in three dimensions".|$|R

The Spanish presidency unsuccessfully tried to challenge the European Council president's prominent post during the first rotating presidency of 2010, while {{the second half of}} the year saw a Belgian <b>rotating</b> presidency <b>marked</b> by a weakened caretaker government which did not challenge Herman van Rompuy, himself a Belgian politician.

The three underline-like punctuation marks in Chinese (proper noun mark, wavy book title mark, and emphasis <b>mark)</b> <b>rotate</b> and shift {{to the left side}} of the text in vertical script (shifting to the right side of the text is also possible, but this is outmoded and can clash with the placement of other punctuation marks).|$|R
5000|$|Discarded computers, {{disk drives}} and media {{are also a}} {{potential}} source of plaintexts. Most operating systems do not actually erase anything [...] - [...] they simply <b>mark</b> the <b>disk</b> space occupied by a deleted file as 'available for use', and remove its entry from the file system directory. The information in a file deleted in this way remains fully present until overwritten at some later time when the operating system reuses the disk space. With even low-end computers commonly sold with many gigabytes of disk space and rising monthly, this 'later time' may be months later, or never. Even overwriting the portion of a disk surface occupied by a deleted file is insufficient in many cases. Peter Gutmann of the University of Auckland wrote a celebrated 1996 paper on the recovery of overwritten information from magnetic disks; areal storage densities have gotten much higher since then, so this sort of recovery {{is likely to be}} more difficult than it was when Gutmann wrote.|$|R
40|$|We define objects made of <b>marked</b> complex <b>disks</b> {{connected}} by metric line segments and construct nonsymmetric and symmetric moduli spaces of these objects. This allows choices of coherent perturbations over the corresponding {{versions of the}} Floer trajectories proposed by Cornea and Lalonde.

Given a Pin_± monotone lagrangian submanifold L ⊂ (M,ω) with minimal Maslov number N_L ≥ 2, we define an A_∞-algebra (resp. differential graded algebra) structure from the critical points of a generic Morse function on L. It is written as a cochain (resp. chain) complex extending the pearl complex introduced by Oh and further explicited by Biran and Cornea, equipped with its quantum product. We verify that the construction is homotopy invariant, defining a functor from a homotopy category of Pin_± monotone lagrangian submanifolds hL^mono, ±(M,ω) to the homotopy category of cochain (resp. chain) complexes hK(Λ-mod) where Λ is a Novikov ring with coefficients in Z...|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the survey data sheet for a mark being hunted, many hunters bring along a digital camera to take close-up and area pictures of the survey <b>mark</b> (a <b>disk,</b> a cross cut in a rock, an old copper bolt, etc.).

Surveyors use the term [...] "recovering" [...] as a synonym for [...] "finding" [...] a mark. This {{does not mean that the}} found mark should be disturbed in any way. On the contrary—disturbing a survey mark in even a small way often destroys its usefulness to surveyors and others. In the U.S., benchmark hunters often file two different reports on marks they find. One, less formal, is made to the website at Geocaching.com. The other more formal type is made by more experienced and careful hunters to the NGS database itself, and describes the mark's found/not found status, current condition, and updated directions to reach it so that others (particularly surveyors) can more easily re-find the mark.|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} we address several {{questions}} involving quantum groups, quantum cluster algebras, and integrable systems, and provide some novel {{examples of the}} very useful interplay between these subjects. In the Chapter 2, we introduce the classical reflection equation (CRE), and give a construction of integrable Hamiltonian systems on G/K, where G is a quasitriangular Poisson Lie group and K is a Lie subgroup arising as the fixed point set of a group automorphism σ of G satisfying the CRE. As an application, we provide a detailed treatment of the algebraic integrability of the XXZ spin chain with reflecting boundary conditions. In Chapter 3, we study doubles of Hopf algebras and dual pairs of quantum moment maps. For any Hopf algebra A, we construct a natural generalization of the (quantized) Grothendieck-Springer resolution; the standard resolution corresponds to taking A a quantum Borel subalgebra. In this latter case, we apply the general construction to yield an algebra embedding of the Drinfeld-Jimbo quantum group U_q(g) into a quantum torus algebra which is a central extension of the quantum coordinate ring of the reduced big double Bruhat cell in the corresponding simply-connected group G. Chapter 4 gives an alternative geometric description of this quantum torus embedding. Namely, we construct an embedding of U_q(sl_n) into a quantum cluster chart on a quantum character variety associated to a <b>marked</b> punctured <b>disk.</b> We obtain {{a description of the}} coproduct of U_q(sl_n) in terms of a quantum character variety associated to the <b>marked</b> twice punctured <b>disk,</b> and express the action of the R-matrix in terms of a mapping class group element corresponding to the half-Dehn twist rotating one puncture about the other. As a consequence, we realize the algebra automorphism of U_q(sl_n) ^⊗ 2 given by conjugation by the R-matrix as an explicit sequence of cluster mutations, and derive a refined factorization of the R-matrix into quantum dilogarithms of cluster monomials. We conclude by mentioning some applications of our cluster realization of quantum groups to the decomposition of tensor products of positive representations, and the construction of a modular functor from quantum higher Teichmuller theory...|$|R

40|$|We {{formulate}} Grover's unstructured search algorithm as a chiral quantum walk, where transitioning in {{one direction}} has a phase conjugate to transitioning in the opposite direction. For small phases, this breaking of time-reversal symmetry {{is too small to}} significantly affect the evolution: the system still approximately evolves in its ground and first excited states, <b>rotating</b> to the <b>marked</b> vertex in time π√(N) / 2. Increasing the phase does not change the runtime, but rather changes the support for the 2 D subspace, so the system evolves in its first and second excited states, or its second and third excited states, and so forth. Apart from the critical phases corresponding to these transitions in the support, which become more frequent as the phase grows, this reveals that our model of quantum search is robust against time-reversal symmetry breaking.
