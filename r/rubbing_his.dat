5|$|If a male is interested, he will stretch {{his neck}} and erect his feathers, then bend over and peck at the ground. He will circle around and sidle up to the female, swaying his body and neck from side to side, and <b>rubbing</b> <b>his</b> breast against his partner's rump. Often the female will reject his {{advances}} with aggression, but if amenable, she signals acceptance by squatting down and raising her rump.|$|E
5|$|Both Newt Lee, {{after the}} {{discovery}} of Phagan's body, and the police, just after 4a.m., had unsuccessfully tried to telephone Frank early on Sunday, April 27. The police contacted him later that morning and he agreed to accompany them to the factory. When the police arrived after 7a.m. without telling the specifics of {{what happened at the}} factory, Frank seemed extremely nervous, trembling, and pale; his voice was hoarse, and he was <b>rubbing</b> <b>his</b> hands and asking questions before the police could answer. Frank said he was not familiar with the name Mary Phagan and would need to check his payroll book. The detectives took Frank to the morgue to see Phagan's body and then to the factory, where Frank viewed the crime scene and walked the police through the entire building. Frank returned home about 10:45a.m. At this point, Frank was not considered a suspect.|$|E
5|$|Mechanical theater (driven by {{carriage}} wheels): The inventors of {{the field}} mill mentioned above, Xie Fei and Wei Mengbian of the Later Zhao (319–351 AD), also invented an intricate mechanical theater mounted on a carriage, its figures operated by motive power (i.e. simply advancing the carriage forward). From 335 to 345 AD, they worked at the court of the ethnic-Jie emperor Shi Hu (334–349). The vehicle they crafted was a four-wheeled and 6m (20ft) long carriage that was about 3m (10ft) wide. On it rested a large golden Buddha statue with a Daoist statue continually <b>rubbing</b> <b>his</b> front with his mechanical hand. The Buddha was also surrounded by ten wooden Daoists who rotated around him in a circuit, periodically bowing to him, saluting him, and throwing incense into a censer. Above the Buddha were nine dragon-headed faucets which spouted water. Like the field mill and the pounding cart of these two inventors, when the carriage halted, so did all of its moving components of mechanical statues and spouting faucets.|$|E

5|$|The {{breeding}} season takes place over five months from August to January {{with up to}} three broods raised. The male proposes suitable nest sites to the female by <b>rubbing</b> <b>his</b> body over a suitable tree fork, all the while trilling continuously. He may indicate several sites before the female ultimately makes the decision where to build, at which point she constructs the nest alone. The nest is a neat, deep cup made of soft dry grass and bark. Spider webs, feathers and fur are used for binding or filling, and the nest is generally placed in a tree fork or even a mistletoe bush. It may be decorated with lichen and camouflaged {{to blend in with}} its surroundings. Two to three dull white eggs tinted bluish, greyish or brownish and splotched with dark grey-brown are laid on consecutive days, measuring 16mm × 13mm (0.6 × 0.5in). Females alone develop brood patches and incubate, although both sexes feed the young. The male will keep lookout either on the nest or perched on a nearby branch, rather than brood while the female is foraging, and parents will feed young and dart off quickly if there are predators in the vicinity. Extra-pair mating and fertilisation is fairly common, with 23% of nestlings and 37% of broods having a different father to the one rearing them, and {{there is some evidence that}} extra-pair couplings are more likely to produce male birds.|$|E

Dongalor tests whether Aneka is alive by <b>rubbing</b> <b>his</b> face in her breasts and licking her face, which he declines to do for Kröd's body. However, Kröd starts to wake up and, having missed {{sleeping}} with Aneka, starts to spoon her still unconscious body. Dongalor orders his guards to kill Kröd but, seeing how weak and disoriented he is from the potion, opts to do so himself and begins taunting Kröd, planning to torture him by killing the still-unconscious Aneka, and then Krӧd. However, a mysterious man (James Murray) swings through a nearby window, knocks Dongalor and Barnabus away, saving Kröd and Aneka, who are dragged {{out of the room}} by their friends to safety.|$|E

500|$|The {{prize for}} the overall winner of the series was a Formula Ford Lola T200 worth £1,500. The series was decided at the last round, held at Silverstone, {{the day before the}} 1970 Formula One International Trophy. Pryce {{qualified}} on the third row for the race, which was held in rain. Jack Pryce remembered that his son was <b>rubbing</b> <b>his</b> hands in delight: [...] "he always loved racing in the rain". The early part of the race was led by a driver called Chris Smith but then heavy rain started and Pryce was able to catch up with Smith and overtake him before winning by a comfortable margin. He was given his Lola by Sir Max Aitken.|$|E
500|$|While {{briefing}} Saswata Chatterjee {{about his}} character, the cold-blooded killer Bob Biswas, Ghosh {{used the phrase}} [...] "Binito Bob" [...] (meaning polite Bob), which crystallised the notion of Bob's manners. Further discussions led to the inclusion of paunch and a bald patch. Chatterjee devised the mannerism of <b>rubbing</b> <b>his</b> nails together as some Indians believe doing that helps prevent hair loss. The mannerism was well-noted and praised by the viewers. Ghosh {{was surprised at how}} Bob Biswas was greeted by fans as a cult figure. He emphasised that the deliberate ordinariness of Bob Biswas was portrayed so convincingly by Chatterjee that the viewers can expect Bob to be around them at any time and any place.|$|E
500|$|Peter is {{annoyed by}} his friend Mort Goldman {{constantly}} borrowing his personal belongings, and eventually decides to create a [...] "Scare-Jew", using his suit, which depicts Adolf Hitler {{in an attempt to}} keep Mort away from his house, which works later on. Frustrated, Lois takes him to a clothing store to get a new suit, where Peter finds some flannel pajamas. While wearing them, he suddenly notices that he can shock people with static electricity by <b>rubbing</b> <b>his</b> feet on the carpet. Annoyed by this, Lois asks Quagmire to completely remove the carpet, which leads the family to find an antique 18th century Rhode Island ship token, hidden under the carpet, which the family sells for $50,000. With the money, Peter and Lois decide to live their dream of owning a restaurant, naming it [...] "Big Pete's House of Munch".|$|E

500|$|Gary Rydstrom and {{his team}} at Skywalker Sound were hired for the film's sound production. Like Howard, Rydstrom {{employed}} different sounds for the two cultures. Focusing on the machine and mechanical sounds of the early industrial era for the explorers, {{he felt that the}} Atlanteans should have a [...] "more organic" [...] sound utilizing ceramics and pottery. The sound made by the Atlantean flying-fish vehicles posed a particular challenge. Rydstrom revealed that he was sitting at the side of a highway recording one day when a semi-truck drove by at high speed. When the recording was sped up on his computer he felt it sounded very organic, and that is what is heard within the film. Rydstrom created the harmonic chiming of the Heart of Atlantis by <b>rubbing</b> <b>his</b> finger along the edge of a champagne flute, and the sound of sub-pods moving through water with a water pick.|$|E
500|$|Actual filming {{took place}} over an eleven-week period with {{location}} shooting in and around Los Angeles, including all of the bowling sequences at the Hollywood Star Lanes (for three weeks) and the Dude's Busby Berkeley dream sequences in a converted airplane hangar. According to Joel, the only time they ever directed Bridges [...] "was when he would come over {{at the beginning of}} each scene and ask, 'Do you think the Dude burned one on the way over?' I'd reply 'Yes' usually, so Jeff would go over in the corner and start <b>rubbing</b> <b>his</b> eyes to get them bloodshot." [...] Julianne Moore was sent the script while working on [...] She worked only two weeks on the film, early and late during the production that went from January to April 1997 while Sam Elliott was only on set for two days and did many takes of his final speech.|$|E
500|$|Through {{the early}} 19th century, Thompson {{continued}} to trade furs throughout the Kootenay region for the North West Company, {{and for the}} few years {{when he had a}} total monopoly over the Canadian fur trade west of the Rockies, he outlawed alcoholic drinks altogether. He was known to have written [...] "I had made it a law to myself that no alcohol should pass the mountains in my company". When two of Thompson's trading partners tried to make him take two barrels of rum to Kootanae House, Thompson [...] "placed the two kegs on a vicious horse and by noon the kegs were empty and in pieces, the horse <b>rubbing</b> <b>his</b> load against the rocks {{to get rid of it}} … I told them what I had done, and that I would do the same to every keg of alcohol." [...] Of course, wine, beer, rum and other intoxicating drinks were imported in time.|$|E

500|$|Koalas are asocial {{animals and}} spend just 15 {{minutes a day}} on social behaviours. In Victoria, home ranges are small and have {{extensive}} overlap, while in central Queensland they are larger and overlap less. Koala society appears to consist of [...] "residents" [...] and [...] "transients", the former being mostly adult females and the latter males. Resident males appear to be territorial and dominate others with their larger body size. Alpha males tend to establish their territories close to breeding females, while younger males are subordinate until they mature and reach full size. Adult males occasionally venture outside their home ranges; when they do so, dominant ones retain their status. When a male enters a new tree, he marks it by <b>rubbing</b> <b>his</b> chest gland against the trunk or a branch; males have occasionally been observed to dribble urine on the trunk. This scent-marking behaviour probably serves as communication, and individuals are known to sniff {{the base of a}} tree before climbing. Scent marking is common during aggressive encounters. Chest gland secretions are complex chemical mixtures—about 40 compounds were identified in one analysis—that vary in composition and concentration with the season and the age of the individual.|$|E
500|$|One night, Mr. Nutt is fatally {{attacked}} by a creature. The agents eventually discover that the attacker is Lanny's twin, Leonard, {{who is able to}} detach himself from Lanny's body. According to Lanny, Leonard attacks people and attempts to burrow into them because he is looking for a new brother to replace Lanny, who is dying from liver failure due to years of alcohol abuse. Lanny voluntarily locks himself in the local jail {{in an effort to keep}} Leonard from escaping, but dies during the night, and Leonard is able to slip through the bars on the cell window and flee. Mulder and Scully try to capture Leonard, who goes inside a funhouse, but he manages to get away. Upon leaving the funhouse, they find The Conundrum lying on the ground, <b>rubbing</b> <b>his</b> stomach, apparently having eaten Leonard. As Dr. Blockhead prepares to leave town with The Conundrum the following morning, he comments to Scully that with modern science eradicating genetic anomalies, it will be up to self-made freaks like him to remind people that [...] "nature abhors normality." [...] The Conundrum looks unwell and Mulder asks what the matter is. The Conundrum [...] in his only line of the episode [...] replies, [...] "probably something I ate." [...] As Dr. Blockhead drives away with The Conundrum, Mulder and Scully turn to each other with confused and somewhat shocked expressions.|$|E
500|$|Two {{hundred years}} after Johnson's death, the posthumous {{diagnosis}} of Tourette syndrome became widely accepted. The condition was unknown during Johnson's lifetime, but Boswell describes Johnson displaying signs of Tourette syndrome, including tics and other involuntary movements. According to Boswell [...] "he commonly held {{his head to}} one side... moving his body backwards and forwards, and <b>rubbing</b> <b>his</b> left knee in the same direction, with the palm of his hand... e made various sounds" [...] like [...] "a half whistle" [...] or [...] "as if clucking like a hen", and [...] "... all this accompanied sometimes with a thoughtful look, but more frequently with a smile. Generally when he had concluded a period, {{in the course of a}} dispute, by which time he was a good deal exhausted by violence and vociferation, he used to blow out his breath like a Whale." [...] There are many similar accounts; in particular, Johnson was said to [...] "perform his gesticulations" [...] at the threshold of a house or in doorways. When asked by a little girl why he made such noises and acted in that way, Johnson responded: [...] "From bad habit." [...] The diagnosis of the syndrome was first made in a 1967 report, and Tourette sundrome researcher Arthur K. Shapiro described Johnson as [...] "the most notable example of a successful adaptation to life despite the liability of Tourette syndrome". Details provided by the writings of Boswell, Hester Thrale, and others reinforce the diagnosis, with one paper concluding: ...|$|E

500|$|Rebecca Nicholson of The Guardian {{said that}} before Guetta's collaborations with Kelis ("Acapella") and Rowland, she felt [...] " [...] was ruining R by turning all of my {{favorite}} ladies into Euro cheesemongers". However [...] "Acapella" [...] changed Nicholson's mind and she said, [...] "'Commander' is further evidence of this". Whilst Fraser McAlpine awarded the song four stars, his review was neither positive nor negative. He said [...] "Singers always like to sing about how brilliantly attractive and astonishing (and bossy) they are. Even if the words have a double meaning, which hints that they are merely mouthing the self-regard of a rampant egomaniac, who is laughing and <b>rubbing</b> <b>his</b> hands every time they start to sing, they don't mind. Why would they? The song mentions hair, and being {{better than the other}} ladies. That's what singers live for. [...] one extra star for the stoopid grammar switcheroo ... because of the chorus, which rules." [...] Gavin Martin of The Mirror made similar comments neither praising nor criticizing the song, instead saying it will put her [...] "firmly in control of the dance floor". Entertainment Weekly named it [...] "the number one summer jam of the year" [...] whilst music station KISS 100 called it fabulous and made it their song of the week for the week beginning May 24, 2010. A reviewer from the network said, [...] "Commander is another smash ... Kelly's taking command! With glamour set to max and drama cranked up to full power 'Commander' is proof that Kelly means business!" [...] In Fitness magazine's 100best workout songs, [...] "Commander" [...] was named one of the ten best dance workout songs for its bouncy 125beats per minute composition.|$|E
