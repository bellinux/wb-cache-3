50|$|In 1993, however, {{production}} fell to {{just over}} 7,000 units and in its final year, 1994, just over 4,000 were produced, the last one <b>rolling</b> <b>off</b> the production line in December. The chassis development for the Maestro and Montego's rear suspension {{was used as a}} basis for later Rover cars, and was well regarded.|$|R
50|$|The ISO large flange {{standard}} {{is known as}} LF, LFB, MF or sometimes just ISO flange. As in KF-flanges, the flanges are joined by a centering ring and an elastomeric o-ring. An extra spring-loaded circular clamp is often used around the large-diameter o-rings {{to prevent them from}} <b>rolling</b> <b>off</b> from the centering ring during mounting.|$|R

25|$|The {{northern}} part of the province has relatively fewer plains, while the southern parts have wider flatlands. Most of the plains are cultivated fields, with few remaining untouched forests. Significant hilly areas can be found <b>rolling</b> <b>off</b> in Santa Cruz in the north, and in San Jose and Magsaysay in the south. These are grassed-over rather than forested.|$|R
50|$|By 1670, {{the thin}} butt {{end of the}} mace began to be used not only for shots under the cushion (which itself was {{originally}} only there as a preventative method to stop balls from <b>rolling</b> <b>off),</b> but players increasingly preferred it for other shots as well. The cue {{as it is known}} today was finally developed by about 1800.|$|R
50|$|The {{race was}} set to start at 7:46 p.m. Eastern time, but {{the start of the}} race was delayed due to the weather. The cars started <b>rolling</b> <b>off</b> a few minutes after 8:00 p.m. but then rain started to pick up again. The race finally went green at 8:23 p.m. with Kevin Harvick leading the way.|$|R

50|$|With {{fear of a}} war to come, the United States has instituted {{compulsory}} {{military service}} with one and half million men being drafted.

25|$|Production totaled 19,534 {{units in}} 1990 and 17,942 units in 1991, most for the {{automatic}} transmission model. Production commenced in June 1989 at Tsutsumi, {{with the first}} 1990 ES 250 <b>rolling</b> <b>off</b> the production line on 30 August 1989. Production ended on 5 July 1991. Because of its relatively brief production run, the ES 250 is a rare model on US roads today.|$|R
30|$|In this study, the {{combination}} of numerous SiO 2 particle aggregates and surface modification by PTES could prevent water from wetting the treated fiber surface and result in water droplets on the obtained corn straw fiber surface <b>rolling</b> <b>off</b> without leaving a trace, thereby demonstrating a novel non-wetting material. Hence, the prepared superhydrophobic/superoleophilic corn straw fiber absorbs only oil while completely repelling water.|$|R
