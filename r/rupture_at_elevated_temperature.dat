40|$|Abstract. Ba 0. 5 Sr 0. 5 Co 0. 8 Fe 0. 2 O 3 – δ {{is a mixed}} ion-electron {{conductor}} {{with high}} application potential as high-temperature gas separation membrane. However, in practical use the integrity of this brittle perovskite is challenged by the mechanical boundary conditions of transient temperature exposure. Moreover, long term failure mechanisms such as static fatigue at room temperature and creep rupture at operation temperature might occur. The relevance of both effects for BSCF has been investigated. The slow crack growth at room temperature has been determined using bi-axial bending under different loading rates. The creep <b>rupture</b> <b>at</b> <b>elevated</b> <b>temperature</b> has been analyzed from three-point bending tests. The results indicate favourable behaviour of BSCF in both cases. A low risk of failure due to slow crack growth exists and the strain to failure in combined tensile-compressive mode reaches up to 40 %...|$|E
40|$|Nordtest and SP Swedish National Testing and Research Institute (SP) have financed a {{study to}} draft a common Nordic test method to {{classify}} wood adhesives for structural purposes according to strength properties after fire exposure. The study has been planned and carried out in cooperation between SP and Norwegian Institute of Wood Technology (NTI) with participation of Otto Graf Institute in Germany (FMPA). Glulam beams produced with six different adhesives {{have been exposed to}} fire. Temperature distribution during the fire exposure test, weight loss and charring rate have been determined. Shear strength of glulines and wood have been determined and delamination tests have been carried out on samples exposed to fire and samples not exposed to fire. Short term shear strength and creep <b>rupture</b> tests <b>at</b> <b>elevated</b> <b>temperature</b> have been carried out on samples with wood adhesives used in the test. Preliminary calculations of temperature distributions during fire in wooden members protected against direct fire exposure by gypsum board have been made. The results of the study on beams not protected by gypsum indicate that a wood adhesive that has shown favourable results in a creep <b>rupture</b> test <b>at</b> <b>elevated</b> <b>temperature</b> (80 °C) also will perform well during and after direct fire exposure. A static load test <b>at</b> <b>elevated</b> <b>temperature</b> can be used as an efficient and cheap method as an alternative to fire exposure tests of glued products for structural use. The results of the preliminary calculations on temperature distributions during fire exposure of gypsum protected smaller wood members indicate that under certain circumstances, the temperature can reach and stay at temperatures above 120 °C {{for a longer period of}} time. An additional test at higher temperature could be needed for adhesives intended for such structures. Pris: 150 SEK. Beställes via BiblioteketBoras@sp. s...|$|R

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to study the behaviour and design of high strength steel columns <b>at</b> <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> using finite element analysis. In this study, equations predicting the yield strength and elastic modulus of high strength steel and mild steel <b>at</b> <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> are proposed. In addition, stress-strain curve model for high strength steel and mild steel materials <b>at</b> <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> is also proposed. The numerical analysis was performed on high strength steel columns over a range of column lengths for various temperatures. The nonlinear finite element model was verified against experimental results of columns at normal room and <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The effects of initial local and overall geometrical imperfections have been taken into consideration in the analysis. The material properties and stress-strain curves <b>at</b> <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> used in the finite element model were obtained from the proposed equations based on the material tests. Two series of box and I-section columns were studied using the finite element analysis to investigate the strength and behaviour of high strength steel columns <b>at</b> <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures.</b> Both fixed-ended stub columns and pin-ended slender columns were considered. The column strengths predicted from the finite element analysis were compared with the design strengths predicted using the American, European and Australian specifications for hot-rolled steel columns <b>at</b> <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> by substituting the reduced material properties. In addition, the direct strength method, which was developed for the design of cold-formed steel columns at normal room temperature, was also used in this study to predict the high strength steel column strengths <b>at</b> <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The suitability of these design rules for high strength steel columns <b>at</b> <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> is assessed. Generally, it is shown that the American and European specifications as well as the direct strength method conservatively predicted the column strengths of high strength steel <b>at</b> <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The European Code predictions are slightly more conservative than the American Specification and the direct strength method predictions. © 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

In addition, the stress-strain curve equations for stainless steel <b>at</b> <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures</b> based on Abdella's explicit stress formulation were also presented. The results showed that the stainless steel has relatively superior fire resistance ability and generally larger reduction factors of material properties than those of carbon steel and alloy steel <b>at</b> <b>elevated</b> <b>temperatures.</b> The predictions from the proposed reduction factor equations are generally in agreement with the test results.
