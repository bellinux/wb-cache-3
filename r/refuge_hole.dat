40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{presentation}} of the study realized with Cofiroute (French acronym for Industrial and Financial Company of Motorways), Oktal, the company that realized the virtual mock-up of the tunnel, Renault, the car manufacturer which provided its dynamic driving simulator, and the LAMIH (French acronym for the Laboratory of Industrial and Human Automation, Mechanics and Computer Science). The French government selected Cofiroute as prime contractor, for building, operating and maintaining the A 86 west tunnels. This future tunnel will present two superposed, independent carriageways each carrying one-way traffic. Each level will be divided into a two-lane carriageway. The tunnel is 10 kilometres long and between 20 and 90 meters deep. The ceiling height is 2. 55 meters and the speed is limited to 70 km/h. The <b>refuge</b> <b>holes</b> are positioned {{on the left side of}} the tunnel. Only the light vehicles will be allowed to use this tunnel. One feature Cofiroute wanted to study was the impact of the positioning of the hard shoulder for emergency use on the left of the road in the traffic pattern. The usual positioning in right hand drive countries is the right one. An experimental protocol was built with 9 traffic situations. 38 subjects drove in the virtual tunnel,...|$|R

40|$|What are {{the effects}} of no-take marine {{reserves}} on trophic relationships of coral reef fish? Previous studies often have lacked detailed dietary information on major predators, and have often been confounded by differences in habitat complexity between reserve and fished sites. This study investigates {{the effects of}} marine reserve protection on predator-prey interactions of coral reef fish on the inshore islands of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The abundance of species of prey fish of Plectropomus leopardus (Serranidae), a piscivore and the major target of the hook and line fisheries on the GBR, were estimated in protected and fished zones. These prey species were identified from previous detailed studies of the diet of P. leopardus. Fish populations and habitat characteristics were surveyed by underwater visual census. Previous studies had determined that the biomass of P. leopardus was 3 – 4 times higher in protected than fished zones in the Whitsunday and Palm Islands, central GBR, after 14 years of protection. Eight of the nine prey species had a higher density within fished zones than protected zones, six significantly so. The density of all prey fish was twice that in the fished than the protected zone (p < 0. 001). There {{were no significant differences}} in availability of different sized <b>refuge</b> <b>holes,</b> structural complexity or live coral cover between zones. Thus, important attributes of habitat complexity did not confound the comparisons between reserve and fished zones. Finally, a significant negative correlation (r = 0. 46) between coral trout biomass and summed prey fish biomass suggested that predation may be an important structuring process in this system. The results have implications for the conservation of fishery targets and their prey. The study highlights the potential ecosystem implications of the use of no-take marine reserves as conservation and fisheries management tools...|$|R
50|$|A {{survey of}} falcons {{on the island}} in 2014 found {{evidence}} of Eleonora's falcon (Falco eleonorae) crippling and imprisoning live prey for later use. Abdeljebbar Qninba of Mohammed V University, Rabat, and colleagues, found small birds with missing flight and tail feathers trapped, or hiding in small holes or cavities. It is thought either the falcons plucked feathers to keep the birds as a food source for later, or alternatively, the prey are escaping from the falcons by finding <b>refuge</b> in nearby <b>holes.</b>|$|R
60|$|This way {{of viewing}} the relation, {{as far as}} it holds good, between the bright colours of female birds and their manner of nesting, {{receives}} some support from certain analogous cases occurring in the Sahara Desert. Here, as in most other deserts, various birds, and many other animals, have had their colours adapted in a wonderful manner to the tints of the surrounding surface. Nevertheless there are, as I am informed by the Rev. Mr. Tristram, some curious exceptions to the rule; thus the male of the Monticola cyanea is conspicuous from his bright blue colour, and the female almost equally conspicuous from her mottled brown and white plumage; both sexes of two species of Dromolæa are of a lustrous black; so that these three birds are far from receiving protection from their colours, yet they are able to survive, for they have acquired the habit, when in danger, of taking <b>refuge</b> in <b>holes</b> or crevices in the rocks.|$|R
60|$|This {{estimate}} of the cats was fully justified by what followed. A considerable number of these useful creatures, black, white, and grey, had been brought from Otaheite {{for the purpose of}} keeping down the rats, with which many of the South Sea Islands are afflicted. During the voyage most of them had retired to the privacy of the hold, where they found holes and corners about the cargo, and came out only at night, like evil spirits, to pick up a precarious livelihood. During the recent conflict a few had found insecure <b>refuge</b> in <b>holes</b> and corners about the deck, where yelling and fugitive pigs had convulsed them with horror; and one, a huge grey cat, having taken madly to the rigging, rushed out {{to the end of the}} foresail-yard, where it was immediately roused to frenzy by a flock of astonished gulls. Now, these cats had to be rummaged out of their retreats by violence, in which work all the white men in the ship had to take part amid a chorus of awful skirling, serpentlike fuffing, ominous and deadly growling, and, generally, hideous caterwauling, that no pen, however gifted, could adequately describe.|$|R

5|$|American {{alligators}} modify wetland habitats, most {{dramatically in}} flat {{areas such as}} the Everglades, by constructing small ponds known as alligator holes. This behavior has qualified the American alligator to be considered a keystone species. Alligator holes retain water during the dry season and provide a refuge for aquatic organisms. Aquatic organisms that survive the dry season by seeking <b>refuge</b> in alligator <b>holes</b> are a source of future populations. The construction of nests along the periphery of alligator holes, as well as a buildup of soils during the excavation process, provide drier areas for other reptiles to nest and a place for plants that are intolerant of inundation to colonize. Alligator holes are an oasis during the Everglades dry season, so are consequently important foraging sites for other organisms. In the limestone depressions of cypress swamps, alligator holes tend to be large and deep, while those in marl prairies and rocky glades are usually small and shallow, and those in peat depressions of ridge and slough wetlands are more variable.|$|R

It frequently traversed it round, examined the strength of every part of it, retired into its hole, and came out very frequently. The first enemy, however, it had to encounter was another and a much larger spider, which, having no web of its own, and having probably exhausted all its stock in former labors of this kind, came to invade the property of its neighbor.

60|$|The Germans {{looked on}} from the first with natural {{irritation}} that a power of the powerlessness of Hawaii should thus profit by its undeniable footing in the family of nations, and send embassies, and make believe to have a navy, and bark and snap at {{the heels of the}} great German Empire. But Becker could not prevent the hunted Laupepa from taking <b>refuge</b> in any <b>hole</b> that offered, and he could afford to smile at the fantastic orgie in the embassy. It was another matter when the Hawaiians approached the intractable Mataafa, sitting still in his Atua government like Achilles in his tent, helping neither side, and (as the Germans suspected) keeping the eggs warm for himself. When the Kaimiloa steamed out of Apia on this visit, the German war-ship Adler followed at her heels; and Mataafa was no sooner set down with the embassy than he was summoned and ordered on board by two German officers. The step is one of those triumphs of temper which can only be admired. Mataafa is entertaining the plenipotentiary of a sovereign power in treaty with his own king, and the captain of a German corvette orders him to quit his guests.|$|R
6000|$|Among so many {{worse than}} {{doubtful}} friends, Charles, after 1746, {{took his own}} course; even his father knew little or nothing of his movements. Between his departure from Avignon (February 1749) and the accession of Pickle to the Hanoverian side (Autumn 1749 or 1750), Charles baffled every Foreign Office in Europe. Indeed, Pickle was of little service till 1751 or 1752. Curious light on Charles's character, and on the entangled quarrels of the Jacobites, is cast by d'Argenson's 'Memoires.' In Spring, 1747, the Duke of York disappeared from Paris, almost as cleverly as Charles himself could have done. D'Argenson thus describes his manoeuvre. 'He fled from Paris with circumstances of distinguished treachery' (insigne fourberie) towards his brother, the Prince. He invited Charles to supper; his house was brilliantly lighted up; all his servants were in readiness; but HE had made his escape by five o'clock in the afternoon, aided by Cardinal Tencin. His Governor, the Chevalier Graeme, {{was not in the}} secret. The Prince waited for him till midnight, and was in a mortal anxiety. He believed that the English attempts to kidnap or assassinate himself had been directed against his brother. At last, after three days, he received a letter from the Duke of York, 'explaining his fatal design' to accept a cardinal's hat. 'Prince Charles is determined never to return to Rome, BUT RATHER TO TAKE <b>REFUGE</b> IN SOME <b>HOLE</b> IN A ROCK.' ...|$|R
40|$|The National Elk Refuge is a 25, 000 -acre {{wildlife}} <b>refuge</b> in Jackson <b>Hole,</b> Wyoming—one of {{the most}} treasured, recognizable, and visited ecosystems in the world. The refuge was originally established in 1912 as winter range for the Jackson elk herd. Since then, its mission has expanded. Currently, many people use the refuge for activities such as hunting, fishing, wildlife observation, jogging, and biking. Conflict frequently arises over proper management of the NER, which is fundamentally not about elk habitat, forage production, or other biological or technical issues, but rather about the equitable allocation of human values. Commonly, these values are labeled as “politics ” and discounted. However, ignoring values does not reduce the potential for conflict, as current lawsuits demonstrate. To understand the values that affect refuge management more explicitly, this paper uses an interdisciplinary method that integrates human values into decision making. Since 1912, {{there has been an}} increase in value interactions associated with population growth, a decline in community “ownership ” of the refuge, and increased centralization, bureaucratization, and professionalization of the National Wildlife Refuge System. These important historical trends are described as a way to project future social dynamics. Criteria and priorities are described to help clarify and secure common interests in decision making about the refuge’s management. The National Elk Refuge (NER) in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, was established in 1912. Its recently stated mission is to “provide, preserve, restore, and manag...|$|R
40|$|Abstract We {{examined}} the diurnal refuges occu-pied by the nocturnal squirrelfish, Holocentrus rufus, to describe refuges {{and the behavior}} associated with their use and to determine which, if any, refuge characteristics were selected. We tagged 21 H. rufus on two sites on a fringing reef in Barbados, West Indies, identified the refuges they used (n = 57), measured ten characteristics of each refuge and the surrounding microhabitat, and monitored their refuge use for 4 weeks. To evaluate refuge selection, we measured the same characteristics on a comparable number of unused potential refuges (n = 67) on the same reefs and used classification tree models to determine which characteristics separated used from unused refuges. Each fish used 1 – 9 refuges, which did not overlap among individuals and were defended against intrusion by conspecifics and some hetero-specifics. Fish {{with more than one}} refuge frequently moved among them. There was strong site fidelity with no immigration of untagged fish or emigration of tagged fish on either reef during the study period and no additional refuges being occupied over the 4 -week period. <b>Refuges</b> were primarily <b>holes,</b> open at one or two ends, which varied in size, distance from the reef edge, entrance orientation, and vertical relief at the entrance. <b>Holes</b> used as <b>refuges</b> differed significantly from unused holes mainly in characteristics related to the vertical position of their entrance, but the classification tree models differed for the two sites. This study provides the first detailed information on characteristics of daytime refuges used by a noctur-nally active reef fish and the first evidence of selectivity of refuges. It suggests that the abundance and characteristics of holes on reefs could influence the density of H. rufus on natural reefs...|$|R
60|$|In {{the making}} of a new law it is {{undoubtedly}} the duty of the legislator to see that no injustice be done even to an individual: for there is then nothing to be unsettled, and the matter is under his hands to mould it as he pleases; and if he finds it untractable in the working, he may abandon it without incurring any new inconvenience. But in the question concerning the repeal of an old one, the work is of more difficulty; because laws, like houses, lean on one another, and the operation is delicate, and should be necessary: the objection, in such a case, ought not to arise from the natural infirmity of human institutions, but from substantial faults which contradict the nature and end of law itself,--faults not arising from the imperfection, but from the misapplication and abuse of our reason. As no legislators can regard the minima of equity, a law may in some instances be a just subject of censure without being at all an object of repeal. But if its transgressions against common right and, the ends of just government should be considerable in their nature and spreading in their effects, as this objection goes to the root and principle of the law, it renders it void in its obligatory quality on the mind, and therefore determines it as the proper object of abrogation and repeal, so far as regards its civil existence. The objection here is, as we observed, by no means on account of the imperfection of the law; it is on account of its erroneous principle: for if this be fundamentally wrong, the more perfect the law is made, the worse it becomes. It cannot be said to have the properties of genuine law, even in its imperfections and defects. The true weakness and opprobrium of our best general constitutions is, that they cannot provide beneficially for every particular case, and thus fill, adequately to their intentions, the circle of universal justice. But where the principle is faulty, the erroneous part of the law is the beneficial, and justice only finds <b>refuge</b> in those <b>holes</b> and corners which had escaped the sagacity and inquisition of the legislator. The happiness or misery of multitudes can never be a thing indifferent. A law against {{the majority of the people}} is in substance a law against the people itself; its extent determines its invalidity; it even changes its character as it enlarges its operation: it is not particular injustice, but general oppression; and can no longer be considered as a private hardship, which might be borne, but spreads and grows up into the unfortunate importance of a national calamity.|$|R
