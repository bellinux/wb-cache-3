25|$|Fabless licensees, {{who wish}} to {{integrate}} an ARM core into their own chip design, are usually only interested in acquiring a ready-to-manufacture verified semiconductor intellectual property core. For these customers, ARM Holdings delivers a gate netlist description of the chosen ARM core, along with an abstracted simulation model and test programs to aid design integration and verification. More ambitious customers, including integrated device manufacturers (IDM) and foundry operators, choose to acquire the processor IP in synthesizable RTL (Verilog) form. With the synthesizable RTL, the customer {{has the ability to}} perform architectural level optimisations and extensions. This allows the designer to achieve exotic design goals not otherwise possible with an unmodified netlist (high clock speed, very low power consumption, instruction set extensions, etc.). While ARM Holdings does not grant the licensee the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>resell</b> the ARM architecture itself, licensees may freely sell manufactured product such as chip devices, evaluation boards and complete systems. Merchant foundries can be a special case; not only are they allowed to sell finished silicon containing ARM cores, they generally hold the right to re-manufacture ARM cores for other customers.|$|E

50|$|Distribution rights {{differ from}} {{reproduction}} rights. While the first-sale doctrine entitles the copyright holder {{to begin the}} distribution chain of a copyrighted work - by selling note cards, for instance, or giving them away - it does not permit the copyright holder to control what is done with the item after it is distributed. Unless there is a separate contract between the parties, the person who owns the object has the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> give it away or resell it him or herself. In the case of Lee v. A.R.T., since bonding the cards to ceramic did not create a derivative work, A.R.T. Co. was legally within their <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>resell</b> the cards in such a fashion.|$|R

Vernor claimed that he purchased [...] "authentic, used copies" [...] of Autodesk software, and that he never opened, installed, or agreed to the included license terms, and was within his <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>resell</b> those copies of the software without interference by Autodesk. He further claimed that Autodesk's use of the DMCA to inhibit these sales constituted an unlawful restraint of trade.|$|R

NextPage registered itself with the State of Utah as a private company on June 8, 1999. At the same time, NextPage registered the Folio.com name.|$|R
5000|$|Justice Shiras {{agreed that}} {{ownership}} of state lands extends to those lands submerged under its navigable waters; however, Shiras {{argued that the}} grant of the submerged lands by the state legislature functioned like any land transfer contract and effectively transferred title to Illinois Central. Shiras {{pointed out that the}} act granting the submerged lands expressly denied Illinois Central the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>resell</b> or transfer the lands or to impair the public <b>right</b> <b>to</b> navigation. Shiras makes it clear that this dissenting opinion does not contradict the point that states cannot transfer control of the public’s <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> navigable waters, however, these rights are only violated once Illinois Central acts to obstruct them. To otherwise empower the legislature to revoke legislative acts granting property rights would offend “the right of the citizens to the free enjoyment of their property legally acquired.” ...|$|R

5|$|While Bembo Book is {{considered}} the superior digitisation, the original continues to offer the advantages of two extra weights (semi- and extra-bold) and infant styles with simplified a and g characters resembling handwriting; its lighter appearance may also be of use on printing equipment with greater ink spread. Cross-licensing has meant that it is sold by a range of vendors, often at very low prices. As an example of this, Fontsite obtained the <b>rights</b> <b>to</b> <b>resell</b> a derivative of the original digitisation, using the alternative name Borgia and Bergamo, upgrading it by additional OpenType features such as small capitals and historical alternative characters. Neither version includes digitisations of the larger size versions of Bembo, which had a more delicate and elegant design.|$|R

40|$|This case {{addressed}} the issue of whether Vernon Bowman’s reproduction of genetically modified, patented seed stimulates the patent restriction a second time. Plaintiff Monsanto Company sued Bowman for patent infringement. Bowman argued the planting of a patented seed fulfills the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> use and <b>resell</b> under the Patent Exhaustion Doctrine and Monsanto wrongfully interfered with farmers’ practices, incorrectly demanding an exception to patent exhaustion. The U. S. Supreme Court held unanimously that to reproduce patented seeds without permission falls beyond the rights of patent exhaustion and it was Bowman who requested an exception from patent law, which exists to protect inventors and encourage innovation. The Court determined centuries-old agricultural practices are not exempt from The Patent Act, which requires payment for the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> grow patented genetically innovative seed...|$|R

By 1750, about 60,000 Irish and 50,000 Germans came to live in British North America, many of them settling in the Mid-Atlantic Region. William Penn founded the colony of Pennsylvania in 1682, and attracted an influx of British Quakers with his policies of religious liberty and freehold ownership. ("Freehold" [...] meant owning land free and clear, with the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>resell</b> it to anyone.) The first major influx of settlers were the Scotch Irish who headed to the frontier.

5000|$|G. A. F. Seelig was a milk {{dealer in}} New York City who {{purchased}} milk from {{its parent company}} in Vermont. GAF purchased approximately 220 cans of milk and cream every day, 90% of which was sold in original cans to hotels, restaurants and larger facilities, with the remaining 10% repackaged in individual bottles and sold directly to consumers. The prices paid to the producer was lower than those prescribed by the New York law. Baldwin, the state farms and market commissioner, refused to license GAF's business because the dealer declined to sign an agreement {{to conform to the}} statute. As New York officials moved to prosecute the company for trading without a license, GAF brought suit against the state, in the person of Baldwin and other officials. In 1934, the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York issued a split decision, holding that GAF had the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>resell</b> the milk in [...] "original packaging", but not that which had been repackaged in individual bottles. Both parties appealed to the Supreme Court.|$|E

5000|$|Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc. {{was a case}} in the United States District Court for the Western District of Washington {{regarding}} {{the applicability of the}} first-sale doctrine to software sold under the terms of so-called [...] "shrinkwrap licensing." [...] The court held that when the transfer of software to the purchaser materially resembled a sale (non-recurring price, right to perpetual possession of copy) it was, in fact, a [...] "sale with restrictions on use" [...] giving rise to a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>resell</b> the copy under the first-sale doctrine. As such, Autodesk could not pursue an action for copyright infringement against Vernor, who sought to resell used versions of its software on eBay. The decision was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which issued a decision on September 10, 2010, reversing the first-sale doctrine ruling and remanding for further proceedings on the misuse of copyright claim. The Ninth Circuit's decision asserted that its ruling was compelled by Ninth Circuit precedent, but observed that the policy considerations involved in the case might affect motion pictures and libraries as well as sales of used software.|$|E
5000|$|In Vernor v. Autodesk, Inc., Autodesk was sued in 2007 by Timothy Vernor, who {{alleged that}} he was {{entitled}} to sell on eBay [...] "used" [...] copies of AutoCAD software he had obtained at an office liquidation sale from an Autodesk licensee. A federal district judge in Washington state denied Autodesk's initial motion to dismiss in early 2008. In February and March 2009, both sides filed motions for summary judgment addressing the issue whether the First Sale Doctrine applies to previously licensed software. The Court ruled in Vernor's favor, holding that when the transfer of software to the purchaser materially resembled a sale (non-recurring price, right to perpetual possession of copy) it was, in fact, a [...] "sale with restrictions on use" [...] giving rise to a <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>resell</b> the copy under the first-sale doctrine. As such, Autodesk could not pursue an action for copyright infringement against Vernor, who sought to resell used versions of its software on eBay. The decision was appealed to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, which reversed the lower court ruling, denying Vernor the right to resale Autodesk software on eBay due to Autodesk's nontransferable licensing restrictions. In October 2011, the U.S. Supreme Court let stand the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruling.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In common value auctions {{the winning}} bid often exceeds {{the value of}} the good purchased. This “winner’s curse ” is bad for the buyers, but good for the sellers. Given this, people bidding for the <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>resell</b> a good might be {{expected}} to bid more than the expected value. Furthermore, if sellers have different forecasts about the extent of the winner’s curse among buyers, then {{the value of the}} <b>right</b> <b>to</b> <b>resell</b> is in turn a common value good, and potential sellers might even be expected to suffer from a winner’s curse of their own. In this paper I report on results from a new experiment where one group of people enter an auction for the right to auction a common value good to another group. I find a winner’s curse among the buyers, extending the results others have found into a new experimental setting where the auctioneer is a participant in the experiment, rather than the experimenter. I also find that the sellers do overbid, and so suffer from a curse of their own...|$|E
