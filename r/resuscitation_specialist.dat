40|$|Objective: {{to study}} the {{effectiveness}} and safety of an automatic ventilator weaning system in patients with acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) on continuous mechanical ventilation (MV). Subjects and methods. Twenty-eight patients diagnosed as having severe concomitant injury were examined. Due to the evolved ARDS, all the patients were on continuous MV. The study group patients (n= 10) were transited to spontaneous breathing through a Smart Care® ventilation system; the control group patients (n= 18) were weaned from the ventilator {{under the control of}} a <b>resuscitation</b> <b>specialist.</b> Account was taken of the duration of ventilation in the Smart Care® mode and that of patient weaning under the control of a <b>resuscitation</b> <b>specialist,</b> and the need for reintubation, as well as postintubation complications. Results. The application of the automatic ventilator weaning mode showed a 1. 3 -fold reduction in the length of stay in the patients with severe ARDS under assisted ventilation.

40|$|Herpesviruses can {{directly}} affect {{the structure of}} the nervous system, resulting in encephalitis, and also induce immune-mediated disorders of the peripheral nervous system as sensory-predominant chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP). Patients with immunodeficiency may simultaneously develop two pathological processes, determining the severity of the condition. Parainfectious limbic encephalitis (PILE) associated with viruses from the family Herpes viridae is a form of chronic herpes encephalitis, which is characterized by dysfunction of the limbic system and by a long-term course with exacerbations. CIDP is a dysimmune disease leasing to peripheral nervous system involvement, which belongs to a class of myelinopathies. The paper describes two clinical cases of a concurrence of chronic PILE and CIDP in middle-aged men who have symptomatic status epilepticus and iatrogenic complications. It characterizes difficulties in diagnosis and the clinical features of chronic herpes infection involving the central and peripheral nervous systems. The given clinical cases suggest that not only neurologists and epileptologists, but also <b>resuscitation</b> <b>specialists</b> and ngiosurgeons should be particularly alert to the pathology in question. </p...|$|R
40|$|The article {{presents}} modern review and proper data on topical problem of strokes in children. The incidence of stroke in children is 3 cases for 100, 000 children per year, 40 % of them — children under 5 years old. More then {{a half of}} children have stable motor and cognitive disorders, in 20 % of them experience repeated strokes. There are many etiological factors of the disease; the main ones are pro thrombotic state of hemostasis, disorders of vessels, infections and traumas. Diagnostics of a stroke includes magneticresonance imaging and angiography, several laboratory tests and detection {{of the level of}} homocysteine. The tables describe basis and neuroprotection treatment in acute period of ischemic stroke. Authors give special attention to the stroke as an interdisciplinary problem treated by <b>resuscitation</b> <b>specialists,</b> pediatricians, neurologists, infectious diseases specialist and hematologists.

40|$|In {{the past}} years, the {{interest}} of theorists and clinicians has steadily increased in the myocardially secreted hormones &# 8211; natriuretic peptides. At the Congress of the European Society of Anesthesiology (Munich, 2007), B-type natriuretic peptides were included into {{the list of the}} parameters of perioperative laboratory monitoring that is expedient in the practice of anesthetists and <b>resuscitation</b> <b>specialists.</b> The literature review shows the history of discovery and identification of different types of natriuretic peptides and considers the matters of their biochemistry. It also details information on the synthesis, secretion, and clearance of these peptides, as well as their receptor apparatus in various organs and tissues. The physiology of the regulatory system is described, as applied to the cardiovascular, excretory, central nervous systems, and the neuroendocrine one. Special attention is given to the current publications on the control of B-type natriuretic peptides as biomarkers of cardiac dysfunction. The diagnostic and prognostic values of peptides are analyzed in chronic circulatory insufficiency, coronary heart disease, and other car-diological and non-cardiological diseases. The prognostic value of elevated B-type natriuretic peptide levels in cardiac surgery is separately considered. It is concluded that the changes in the level of B-type natriuretic peptides in different clinical situations are the subject of numerous researches mainly made in foreign countries. The bulk of these researches are devoted to the study of peptides in cardiology and other areas of therapy. Studies on the use of peptides in reanimatology are relatively few and their results are rather discordant. The foregoing opens up wide prospects for studying the use of B-type natriuretic peptides in Russian intensive care and anesthesiology.

50|$|Different {{models for}} {{emergency}} medicine exist internationally. In countries following the Anglo-American model, emergency medicine was originally {{the domain of}} surgeons, general practitioners, and other generalist physicians, but in recent decades it has become recognised as a speciality {{in its own right}} with its own training programmes and academic posts, and the specialty is now a popular choice among medical students and newly qualified medical practitioners. By contrast, in countries following the Franco-German model, the speciality does not exist and emergency medical care is instead provided directly by anesthesiologists (for initial <b>resuscitation),</b> surgeons, <b>specialists</b> in internal medicine, or another speciality as appropriate. In developing countries, emergency medicine is still evolving and international emergency medicine programs offer hope of improving basic emergency care where resources are limited.|$|R
40|$|Yousef W Nielsen, Henrik S Thomsen Department of Radiology, Copenhagen University Hospital Herlev, Copenhagen, Denmark Abstract: Acute adverse {{reactions}} to iodine-based contrast media occur within 60 minutes of administration. The reactions range from mild (flushing, arm pain, nausea/vomiting, headache) to moderate (bronchospasm, hypotension), and severe (cardiovascular collapse, laryngeal edema, convulsions, arrhythmias). Most acute {{adverse reactions}} occur in an unpredictable manner. Use {{of the older}} group of ionic iodine-based contrast agents {{increases the risk of}} acute adverse reactions. Other risk factors include previous reactions to contrast media, asthma, and allergic conditions. The exact pathophysiology of the acute adverse reactions is unknown, but some of the reactions are pseudoallergic mimicking type 1 allergic reactions. As antibodies against contrast media have not been consistently demonstrated, the reactions are, in most cases, not truly allergic in nature. Most of the severe and fatal adverse reactions occur within the first 20 minutes after injection. Thus, it is important that patients are observed in the radiology department during this period. The radiologist should be near the room where contrast media is administered, and be ready to treat any acute nonrenal adverse reaction. Appropriate drugs and resuscitation equipment should be in/near the room where the contrast media is administered. The important first-line management of acute adverse reactions includes the establishment of an adequate airway, oxygen supplementation by mask, intravenous fluid administration, and measurement of blood pressure and heart rate. When severe anaphylactoid reactions occur, adrenaline should be given intramuscularly. Only one concentration of adrenaline (1 : 1000 – 1 mg/mL) should be available in the radiology department to avoid dosing errors in stressful acute settings. <b>Resuscitation</b> team <b>specialists</b> should be the only ones giving intravenous adrenaline. It is important that all radiologists maintain the capability of performing first-line treatment of acute adverse reactions to contrast media.

40|$|The median annual {{mortality}} from snow avalanches {{registered in}} the 17 ICAR countries 1981 – 1998 was 146 (range 82 – 226). Swiss data document a mortality rate of 52. 4 % in completely-buried, versus 4. 2 % in partially-, or non-buried, persons (n = 1886). Survival probability of completely-buried victims in open areas (n = 638) plummets from 91 % 18 min after burial to 34 % at 35 min, then remains fairly constant until a second drop after 90 min. Standardised guidelines are introduced for the field management of avalanche victims. Strategy by rescuers confronted with the triad hypoxia, hypercapnia and hypothermia is primarily governed by the length of snow burial and victim’s core temperature, {{in the absence of}} obviously fatal injuries. With a burial time ≤ 35 min survival depends on preventing asphyxia by rapid extrication and immediate airway management; cardiopulmonary resuscitation for unconscious victims without spontaneous respiration. With a burial time> 35 min combating hypothermia becomes of paramount importance. Thus, gentle extrication, ECG and core temperature monitoring and body insulation are mandatory; unresponsive victims should be intubated and pulseless victims with core temperature < 32 °C [89. 6 °F] (prerequisites being an air pocket and free airways) transported under continuous cardiopulmonary <b>resuscitation</b> to a <b>specialist</b> hospital fo...|$|R
