5|$|Berger told Simpson that if {{he wanted}} to be a {{successful}} road cyclist, he needed experience in track cycling, particularly in the pursuit discipline. Simpson competed <b>regularly</b> <b>at</b> Fallowfield Stadium in Manchester, where in early 1956 he met amateur world pursuit silver medallist Cyril Cartwright, who helped him develop his technique. At the national championships at Fallowfield the 18-year-old Simpson won a silver medal in the individual pursuit, defeating amateur world champion Norman Sheil before losing to Mike Gambrill.|$|E

5|$|By {{the time}} Hamnet was four, {{his father was}} already a London playwright and, as his {{popularity}} grew, he was probably not <b>regularly</b> <b>at</b> home in Stratford with his family. Honan believes that Hamnet may have completed Lower School, {{which would have been}} normal, before his death at the age of eleven (possibly from the Bubonic Plague). He was buried in Stratford on 11 August 1596. At that time in England about a third of all children died before age 10.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1950s and early sixties Howard showed <b>regularly</b> <b>at</b> the Picture Loan Society, a Toronto gallery {{established}} by Douglas Duncan in 1936 {{to present the}} work of contemporary Canadian artists such as Emily Carr, Fred Varley, David Milne, Lawren Harris and A.Y. Jackson. Several Canadian public collections possess Howard drawings and paintings acquired through the Douglas Duncan estate, as Duncan was also a collector of her work.|$|E

5|$|Prince Sadruddin's {{interest}} in Islamic art was sparked {{in his youth}} by his paternal grandmother's library of Persian books, mystical texts and astrological treatises. While at Harvard in the 1950s, he would make purchases in New York, and eventually began to acquire from dealers in Paris, Geneva and London. He would bid <b>regularly</b> <b>at</b> Sotheby's and Christie's auctions in Europe and North America. For advice, he looked to his friend Stuart Cary Welch, a noted historian of Islamic art at Harvard University.|$|E
5|$|When {{the club}} was first founded, Christ Church had a nomadic existence, playing {{at a number of}} {{locations}} in the area. The club, which had by then been renamed Bolton Wanderers, started playing <b>regularly</b> <b>at</b> Pike's Lane in 1881. Spending £150 on pitch improvements, season tickets cost a guinea. They played here for fourteen years until the tenancy expired and they moved to Burnden Park.|$|E

5|$|As the {{visibility}} of LGBT comic book creators and characters has increased, comic book fandom has taken notice. Panels discussing LGBT topics occur <b>regularly</b> <b>at</b> comic book and LGBT conventions such as Comicon and Gaylaxicon, and conventions also feature stands dedicated to LGBT comics. Ted Abenheim, event chair of Prism Comics said in 2008, “We’re in our sixth year of exhibiting at Comic-Con, presenting a larger booth and more panels and events than ever before.” A number of websites dedicated to LGBT comic book fandom and featuring content from staff writers exist, such as Prismcomics.org, Pinkkrytonite.com and Gayleague.com.|$|E
5|$|Before {{leaving the}} band in 1984, Dade Farrar {{introduced}} {{its members to}} Mike Heidorn, the younger brother of his girlfriend; Heidorn then joined the group as their drummer. The Plebes then decided to change its name to The Primitives, {{a reference to a}} 1965 song by psychedelic rock group The Groupies. Due to the unpopularity of punk rock in the St. Louis area, The Primitives began to play blues-oriented garage rock at fast tempos. They performed <b>regularly</b> <b>at</b> a wedding hall in Millstadt, Illinois, where Tweedy's mother Jo Ann would collect the cover fee. They also performed <b>regularly</b> <b>at</b> B St Bar in Belleville with bands such as The Newsboys (later Sammy and the Snowmonkeys), Charlie Langrehr, and The Symptoms. Wade Farrar was the lead singer of the band, but his commitment to Southern Illinois University and an attempted enlistment in the United States Army meant he was only able to dedicate a small amount of time to the group. Additionally, Heidorn broke his collarbone during a concert in 1986, which caused the band to go on hiatus. Jay Farrar and Tweedy continued to write songs and perform at Heidorn's house while he recovered, and by 1987 they had restarted the group. The Primitives temporarily added Tony Mayr as a bassist so that Tweedy could play guitar, but a month later the band decided to keep Tweedy on bass and remain a three-piece. To avoid confusion with a successful British band also named The Primitives, they decided to change their name once again, to Uncle Tupelo. Although they performed only 1960s cover songs as The Primitives, the trio decided to take a new approach and write their own music under their new name.|$|E
5|$|Being low-lying {{and largely}} {{surrounded}} by water, Norfolk is {{particularly vulnerable to}} rising sea levels. In addition, the land on which it is built is slowly subsiding. Some areas already flood <b>regularly</b> <b>at</b> high tide, and the city commissioned a study in 2012 to investigate how {{to address the issue}} in the future: it reported the cost of dealing with a sea-level rise of one foot would be around $1,000,000,000. Since then, scientists at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science in 2013 have estimated that if current trends hold, the sea in Norfolk will rise by 5 and 1/2 feet or more {{by the end of this}} century.|$|E

30|$|We {{consider}} {{the rate of}} convergence to equilibrium of Volterra integrodifferential equations with infinite memory. We show that if the kernel of Volterra operator is <b>regularly</b> varying <b>at</b> infinity, and the initial history is <b>regularly</b> varying <b>at</b> minus infinity, then the rate of convergence to the equilibrium is <b>regularly</b> varying <b>at</b> infinity, and the exact pointwise rate of convergence can be determined {{in terms of the}} rate of decay of the kernel and the rate of growth of the initial history. The result is considered both for a linear Volterra integrodifferential equation {{as well as for the}} delay logistic equation from population biology.|$|R
5|$|By 1910 Russian émigrés met <b>regularly</b> <b>at</b> the Anarchist Club in Jubilee Street, Stepney. Many of {{its members}} were not anarchists, and the club became a meeting and social venue for the Russian émigré diaspora, {{most of whom were}} Jewish. The small group of Latvians who became {{involved}} in the events at Houndsditch and Sidney Street were not all anarchists—although anarchist literature was later found among their possessions. Members of the group were probably revolutionaries who had been radicalised by their experiences in Russia. All had extreme left-wing political views and believed the expropriation of private property was a valid practice.|$|E
5|$|By mid-1977 in {{downtown}} New York, punk rock was already ceding its cutting-edge status to the anarchic sound of Teenage Jesus and the Jerks and Mars, spearheads of {{what became known}} as no wave, although several original punk bands continued to perform and new ones emerged on the scene. The Cramps, whose core members were from Sacramento, California by way of Akron, had debuted at CBGB in November 1976, opening for the Dead Boys. They were soon playing <b>regularly</b> <b>at</b> Max's Kansas City. The Misfits formed in nearby New Jersey. Still developing what would become their signature B movie–inspired style, later dubbed horror punk, they made their first appearance at CBGB in April 1977.|$|E
5|$|By the 1960s the LPO had regained {{its earlier}} standards, and in 1964 it secured a {{valuable}} engagement {{to play in}} the Glyndebourne Festival opera house during the summer months. In 1993 it was appointed resident orchestra of the Royal Festival Hall on the south bank of the Thames, one of London's major concert venues. Since 1995 the residency has been jointly held with the Philharmonia. In addition to its work at the Festival Hall and Glyndebourne, the LPO performs <b>regularly</b> <b>at</b> the Congress Theatre, Eastbourne and the Brighton Dome, and tours nationally and internationally.|$|E

5|$|From 1953 onwards, Barbirolli and the Hallé {{appeared}} <b>regularly</b> <b>at</b> the Henry Wood Promenade Concerts at the Royal Albert Hall in London. As well {{as major}} {{works from the}} mainstream repertory they gave an annual concert of music by Viennese composers, including Franz Lehár and Johann Strauss, which, like Sir Malcolm Sargent's annual Gilbert and Sullivan nights, rapidly became a firm favourite with the promenaders. At one 1958 promenade concert Barbirolli and the Hallé played a replica of Charles Hallé's first concert with the orchestra in 1858.|$|E
5|$|In 1956 Driberg {{convened a}} group of Christian socialists that met <b>regularly</b> <b>at</b> the Lamb public house in Bloomsbury to discuss issues such as imperialism, colonialism, {{immigration}} and nuclear disarmament. The group's dispatches, Papers from the Lamb, led to the foundation in 1960 of the Christian Socialist Movement. Although no longer an MP, Driberg remained {{a member of the}} Labour Party's NEC and was active in party affairs. In 1957, in the face of antagonism from trade union leaders repelled by his lifestyle, he became Labour Party chairman, a largely ceremonial role. He travelled widely during his year in office, generally as a Reynolds News correspondent but using the party title to advantage whenever he could. Thus, in a 1958 visit to Moscow to interview space scientists, he obtained two meetings with Nikita Khrushchev.|$|E
5|$|In 1998, {{a working}} {{replica of the}} SSEM, now {{on display at the}} Museum of Science and Industry in Manchester, was built to {{celebrate}} the 50th anniversary of the running of its first program.

In 2008, an original panoramic photograph of the entire machine was discovered at the University of Manchester. The photograph, taken on 15 December 1948 by a research student, Alec Robinson, had been reproduced in The Illustrated London News in June 1949.|$|E
