50|$|Port {{facilities}} at Outer Harbor were constructed {{during the first}} decade of the 20th century. This involved <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> <b>marshland</b> and the building of wharves and breakwaters. A railway line was built northwards from Largs in 1903 to facilitate this construction. The line was initially single track and used by goods trains only.|$|E
50|$|The Delta {{is home to}} {{approximately}} 22 species of fish, including several Pacific salmon species, striped bass, steelhead trout, American shad and sturgeon. About two-thirds of California's salmon pass through the Delta on their way upstream to spawn. The small Delta smelt is a key indicator species {{for the health of}} the Delta's ecosystem. Delta fish populations have been significantly reduced due to the <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> <b>marshland</b> and diversions of fresh water. In 2004, the Delta smelt was found to be on the edge of extinction. The survival of the Delta smelt {{has been one of the}} largest environmental controversies in California, as environmental measures enacted to protect its population have often reduced the amount of water available for federal water projects that depend on water pumped from the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.|$|E
50|$|A new {{airfield}} {{was constructed}} {{by changing the}} course and flow of Chopawamsic Creek and <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>marshland</b> from that area. The new facility was named Turner Field.|$|R
50|$|During the 15th century, Castiglion Fiorentino {{suffered}} from repeated outbreaks of the plague, blamed {{at the time}} on the marshy areas surrounding the city. At the dawn of the 16th century, the Sienese army, led by Pietro Strozzi, gained control of the area, holding Castiglion Fiorentino until 1654, when the area became part of the Grand Duchy of Tuscany. For the next two hundred years, the Medici Grand Dukes ruled the city, until in 1765 the House of Lorraine gained power. The new dynasty encouraged the <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> <b>marshlands,</b> leading to a period of economic and population growth for Castiglion Fiorentino.|$|R

40|$|The {{early years}} of the eighteenth century Irish port town, Cork saw an {{expansion}} of its city limits, an era of reconstruction both within and beyond the walls of its Medieval townscape and a <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> its <b>marshlands</b> to the east and west. New people, new ideas and the beginnings of new wealth infused the post Elizabethan character of the recently siege battered city. It also brought a desire for something different, something new, an opportunity to redefine the ambience and visual perception of the urban landscape and thereby make a statement about its intended cultural and social orientations. It brought an opportunity to re-imagine and model a new, continental style of place and surrounding environment...|$|R
50|$|These early primary {{drainage}} canals included (from west to east): 17th Street, Orleans Avenue and London Avenue. As {{the population}} expanded northward toward the lake, low-lying swamps were reclaimed by constructing shallow drainage ditches that {{fed into the}} newly created system of drainage canals. However, {{the reduction in the}} groundwater table, {{as a result of the}} drainage and <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> swamps and <b>marshland,</b> produced significant land subsidence in the drained area. That land subsidence continues today.|$|R
50|$|The {{neighbourhood}} {{was founded}} in 1884 near the remains of Ostia Antica, {{the port city of}} ancient Rome. This was possible after <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> the nearby <b>marshland</b> (the pond <b>of</b> Ostia), which was infested by malaria. The first inhabitants were peasants coming from Ravenna, in Romagna. Due to the opening of the urban Roma-Ostia railway in 1924, the new village soon became the favourite sea resort of the Romans, while many Art Nouveau houses were built on the waterfront.|$|R

This task requires a comprehensive plan for the whole area designed to secure the benefit of its port, its industries and its commerce, the <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> its <b>marshlands,</b> the building <b>of</b> new roads and bridges, the renewal of obsolete parts of the old riverside development, the designing of new centres and the provision of new amenities.

50|$|On {{the morning}} of Pike Sunday, 10 June 1798, during the Irish Rebellion of 1798, a force of United Irishmen, mainly from Bangor, Donaghadee, Greyabbey and Ballywalter, {{attempted}} to occupy the town of Newtownards. They were met with musket fire from the market house and were defeated. The early 19th century saw the <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>marshlands</b> south <b>of</b> the town. The Belfast and County Down Railway connected Newtownards to Belfast, via Comber and Dundonald, in 1850, and to Donaghadee in 1861. By the same year the town's population had risen to 9,500. (This rail line was closed in 1950.) On 12 July 1867, despite the Party Processions Acts, the Orange Order paraded from Bangor to Newtownards. The parade was organised by William Johnston (sentenced to a short term in prison the next year for his actions) and about 30,000 took part.|$|R
50|$|The {{area around}} Westonzoyland was farmed as common land {{when it was}} owned by the Abbey at Glastonbury, who during the 12th and 13th centuries {{encouraged}} tenants to undertake large scale <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> the <b>marshland.</b> 722 acre were enclosed in 1234. With {{the dissolution of the}} Abbey in 1539, the land was divided among owners, with the soil belonging to the Crown. Cornelius Vermuyden was active in the region in the mid 17th century, building small-scale drainage schemes at Cossington, Catcott, Huntspill and Puriton, but despite the devastation caused by extensive flooding in 1607, was unable to convince the communities of Sedgemoor of the benefits that a drainage scheme would bring, as they feared that improved pastures would prejudice their common rights. A series of Acts of Parliament were passed between 1777 and 1801, which authorised the construction of drainage schemes in the Somerset moors and levels.|$|R
50|$|Until the {{mid-twentieth century}} and the <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> the {{extensive}} areas <b>of</b> <b>marshland</b> around the lower courses of the rivers Po, Adige, Brenta, Sile, Piave, Livenza and Tagliamento, these waterways were of great importance in providing for the transportation of goods and people between the Adriatic coast and the Po plain.|$|R
50|$|In 1926 a {{royal decree}} was {{launched}} that established two consortia: the existing Piscinara Consortium, which {{was extended to}} encompass 48,762 hectares, and the Consortium <b>of</b> <b>Reclamation</b> <b>of</b> the Pontine region, 26,567 hectares, a relatively lower lying area, sites formed from the territories under sea level and consisted mostly <b>of</b> <b>marshland,</b> thus remediation <b>of</b> <b>reclamation</b> was more complex. Because Mussolini was unable to act alone {{and did not want}} to alienate the propertied classes, land reclamation relied heavily on state subsidies.|$|R
50|$|Advances in {{agriculture}} {{may be seen}} in the improved melioration <b>of</b> <b>marshland</b> and the systematic <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> the bogs (from 1633). Trade, especially maritime trade, has played an important role at almost all periods of history. Thus the town of Emden was one of the leading ports in Europe by around 1600, {{and at the same time}} developed into a stronghold of Calvinism. Agriculture and fishing have been the most important sectors of industry for centuries and industrialization took place relatively late.|$|R
40|$|From 1742, the Jesuit R. G. Boscovich {{began to}} {{undertake}} work as consultant on applied mathematics {{on behalf of}} the Papal State and of the principle Italian courts. In his first public office, Boscovich was required to give his opinion on the stability of St. Peter’s dome in Rome. Many papers on applied mathematics, especially hydraulics, followed this first consultation on an architectural work. In 1750 he was commissioned to measure the meridian between Rome and Rimini. Boscovich travelled to the lands of the Papal State with Father Christopher Maire, cartographer and astronomer. The journey took place between October 1750 and November 1752. In the same years, Boscovich was asked for his first works on the science of waters: an examination of the Fiumicino harbour near Rome, the regulation of the course of the Tiber, and the access to the Valleys of Comacchio. The science of waters in the 18 th century was a subject that still lacked clear rules, and the figure of an engineer to deal with the regulation of the rivers did not exist, so mathematicians were called in as experts in hydraulics. In this field Boscovich displayed all his talent. He wrote reports on the regulation of some rivers (the Tiber, Po, Adige) and streams, the <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> extensive <b>marshlands</b> (the Pontine marshes in Latium, the lake of Bientina in Tuscany), but his main contributions concerned the settlement of harbours placed at the river mouth (Fiumicino, Magnavacca, Rimini, Savona). From {{the second half of the}} 18 th century Boscovich addressed his studies to applied mathematics, astronomy, optics and hydraulics. He collected his work on optics and astronomy in the Opera pertinentia ad opticam et astronomiam (1785), but was unable to make a collection of all his papers on hydraulics before he died...|$|R
50|$|The {{commission}} published draft {{proposals for}} the North Eastern General Review Area in April 1962 {{and a final}} report in October 1963. The report recommended {{the creation of a}} single county borough for the Teesside area as it:...seemed to us necessary to ensure that the pattern of local government was such as to make the planning of development and the organisation of services fully effective, and to make certain that new development, such as houses, main roads, bridges and shops would match the growth and location of industry instead of perpetuating the patterns of the past. We were impressed by the need on Tees-side for more housing to relieve overcrowding, to replace outworn properties, and to meet the increase in population due to industrial expansion. Yet unless Teesside could be planned as a whole, it seemed to us impossible to ensure that new houses would be built in places most convenient for the people who would live in them, as it was difficult for the present ten separate housing authorities, each with their own housing list, to do other than build within or near their own boundaries...With the southern moorland, the coast and the river, Tees-side has a splendid setting and it ought to be made worthy of its 400,000 inhabitants.

25|$|The {{perception}} of bay salt marshes as a coastal 'wasteland' has since changed, acknowledging {{that they are}} one of the most biologically productive habitats on earth, rivalling tropical rainforests. Salt marshes are ecologically important providing habitats for native migratory fish and acting as sheltered feeding and nursery grounds. They are now protected by legislation in many countries to look after these ecologically important habitats. In the United States and Europe, they are now accorded to a high level of protection by the Clean Water Act and the Habitats Directive respectively. With the impacts of this habitat and its importance now realised, a growing interest in restoring salt marshes, through managed retreat or the <b>reclamation</b> <b>of</b> land has been established. However, many Asian countries such as China are still to recognise the value <b>of</b> <b>marshlands.</b> With their ever-growing populations and intense development along the coast, the value of salt marshes tends to be ignored and the land continues to be reclaimed.|$|R

40|$|Poyang Lake is a {{seasonal}} lake, exchanging {{water with the}} lower branch of the Yangtze River. During {{the spring and summer}} flooding season it inundates a large area while in the winter it shrinks considerably, creating a large tract <b>of</b> <b>marshland</b> for wild migratory birds. A better knowledge of the water coverage duration and the beginning and ending dates for the vast range <b>of</b> <b>marshlands</b> surrounding the lake is important for the measurement, modelling and management <b>of</b> <b>marshland</b> ecosystems. In addition, the abundance of a special type of snail (Oncomelania hupensis), the intermediate host of parasite schistosome (Schistosoma japonicum) in this region, is also heavily dependent on the water coverage information. However, there is no accurate digital elevation model (DEM) for the lake bottom and the inundated marshland, nor is there sufficient water level information over this area.
