An open circular cylindrical shell is assumed to be simply supported along the two straight edges and the remaining two opposite curved edges may have any combinations of support conditions. The shell is divided into multiple segments along the locations of the intermediate <b>ring</b> <b>supports.</b> The state-space technique is employed to derive the exact solutions for each shell segment and the domain decomposition method is applied to enforce the geometric and natural boundary/interface conditions along the interfaces of the shell segments and the curved edges of the shell. Comparison studies are carried out to verify the correctness of the proposed method. Exact vibration frequencies are obtained for open circular cylindrical shells with multiple intermediate <b>ring</b> <b>supports.</b> The influence of the number of intermediate <b>ring</b> <b>supports,</b> the locations of the <b>ring</b> <b>supports,</b> the boundary conditions and the variation of the included angle of the shells on the natural frequencies are examined. The exact vibration solutions can be used as important benchmark values for researchers to check their numerical methods and for engineers to design such shell structures...|$|R

The classical plate theory is used to derive the governing differential equation for circular plate with internal elastic <b>ring</b> <b>support</b> and flexible edge support system.

40|$|This study {{concerns}} the axisymmetric buckling of radially loaded circular Mindlin plates with internal concentric ring supports. The {{edge of the}} plate is either simply supported or clamped. Based on the Rayleigh-Ritz energy approach, buckling factors are determined and tabulated for plates of various thickness to radius ratios and with either one or two internal concentric rigid ring supports at various radii. The {{results show that the}} buckling factors for circular plates with one concentric <b>ring</b> <b>support</b> decrease with increasing thickness-radius ratios due to the increasing shear deformation effect. The effect of shear deformation on the buckling factors for plates with two ring supports is more pronounced than for plates with one <b>ring</b> <b>support.</b> The buckling factors for simply supported circular plates approach those for clamped circular plates when one of the ring supports is located sufficiently close to the edge. The tabulated buckling results should be valuable to designers for some industrial applications.

Material properties vary along the thickness direction of the shell according to volume fraction power law. The cylindrical shells have ring supports which are arbitrarily placed along the shell and impose zero lateral deflections. The study is carried out based on third order shear deformation shell theory (T. S. D. T). The analysis is carried out using Hamilton’s principle. The governing equations of motion of FGM cylindrical shells are derived based on shear deformation theory. Results are presented on the frequency characteristics, influence of <b>ring</b> <b>support</b> position and the influence of boundary conditions.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we study}} the {{deformation}} {{and stability of}} a circular plate under its own weight and supported by a flexible concentric ring. Both bilateral and unilateral supports are considered. Von Karman’s plate model is adopted to formulate the equations of motion. A nonlinear Galerkin’s method based on two sets of assumed functions is used to discretize and solve the governing equations. Vibration method is used to predict {{the stability of the}} deformations. The linear analysis conducted previously predicts that the deformation is always axisymmetric. The current nonlinear analysis, however, shows that the axisymmetric deformation may become unstable when the dimensionless load, i. e., a ratio between the weight per unit area and the flexural rigidity of the plate, reaches a critical value. At this critical load, a stable non-axisymmetric deformation of the form cosnθ emerges following a pitch-fork bifurcation, where the integer n depends on the stiffness and the radius of the <b>ring</b> <b>support.</b> When the load increases further, more than one stable non-axisymmetric deformation may coexist. In a stable non-axisymmetric deformation with bilateral support, tension on the <b>ring</b> <b>support</b> may develop when the load reaches another critical value. In this situation, the circular plate will separate from the supporting ring in part of the angular region if the bilateral support is replaced by a unilateral one. The deformation with unilateral support is in general larger than the one with bilateral support...|$|E
40|$|Mechanical {{evaluation}} of a small size specimen is of great necessity. The small punch testing method, {{as one of the}} most commonly adopted techniques, was successfully used in determination of elastic modulus for small polymeric specimens. However, the <b>ring</b> <b>support</b> design in this method resulted in an inappropriate specimen-support contact, such as the large contact area and probably the partially non-contact condition, thus lowering the accuracy and sensitivity. In the present study, a finite element based small punch testing method has been developed to determine the elastic moduli of small polymer specimens. In order to measure the initial stiffness, a three-point support based small punch testing device rather than the conventional <b>ring</b> <b>support</b> type was designed and produced for conducting an indentation process. A finite element model for the indentation process was built for determining the elastic moduli of the polymer specimens from the measured initial stiffness through the computed correlation between the elastic modulus and initial stiffness. The differences between the elastic moduli of the PE, PP and PMMA specimens with certain Poisson’s ratios determined by the developed method and those from the standard tensile tests were found to be not statistically significant. With a reduction in the contact area and an elimination of the potential non-contact condition for the specimen-support contact, the developed finite element based method has been shown to be more accurate and sensitive in terms of the determined elastic modulus as compared with the ring-support based small punch testing method. This method may be served as a promising tool for determining the elastic modulus of small polymeric specimens with high sensitivity and accuracy.

The study found that an increase in the In-Ceram coping thickness (at the expense of veneer thickness) decreased the resulting stresses, and the increase in the stiffness of the underlying substrate also, caused a decrease in the resulting stresses...|$|E
