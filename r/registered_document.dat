40|$|Abstract- Plagiarism {{detection}} is {{a challenging}} problem. Today thousands of documents are {{present on the}} net {{but there are no}} proper tools to guarantee their uniqueness in such a great domain. PDF documents form a significant portion of this vast database. Copy detection in digital document database may provide necessary guarantees for publishers and newsfeed services to offer their valuable work for others perusal. We consider the case of comparing a Query Document with a <b>Registered</b> <b>Document.</b> Plagiarism detection techniques are applied by making a distinction between natural and programming language. In this paper we have implemented SCAM (standard Copy Analysis Mechanism) which is relative measure to detecting copies based on comparing the words and lines frequency occurrences of the new document against those of registered documents. These tests involve comparisons of various articles and show that in general this scheme performs pretty well in detecting documents that have Exact, Partial and Trivial overlap...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Plagiarism is {{a complex}} problem and {{considered}} one of the biggest in publishing of scientific, engineering and other types of documents. Plagiarism has also increased with the widespread use of the Internet as large amount of digital data is available. Plagiarism is not just direct copy but also paraphrasing, rewording, adapting parts, missing references or wrong citations. This makes the problem more difficult to handle adequately. Plagiarism detection techniques are applied by making a distinction between natural and programming languages. Our proposed detection process is based on natural language by comparing documents. A similarity score is determined for each pair of documents which match significantly. We have implemented SCAM (Standard Copy Analysis Mechanism) which is a relative measure to detect overlap by making comparison on a set of words that are common between test document and <b>registered</b> <b>document.</b> Our plagiarism detection system, like many Information Retrieval systems, is evaluated with metrics of precision and recall...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the importance of}} legal property documents in providing tenure security, enhancing agricultural investment incentives and easing access to credit. While theory predicts that better property rights on land can increase investment through increased security, enhanced trade opportunities and increased collateral value of land, the presence and size of these effects depend crucially on whether those rights are properly enforced. In Nicaragua, a troubled history of land expropriation and invasion has undermined {{the credibility of the}} legal property regime. The variation in legal ownership status due to a land titling and regularization programme is studied to identify the effects of legal ownership documents. Possession of a <b>registered</b> <b>document</b> is found to increase the probability of carrying out land-attached investments by 35 %. No difference is found in the effect of public deeds and agrarian reform titles provided they are both registered and we find no strong evidence of a credit supply link, thus suggesting security of tenure as the channel through which formal land ownership has an effect on investment.

40|$|In {{the area}} of digital content technologies, Chinese {{document}} image registration is an important task of document mosaic system, also an important research content of distorted document recognition system. The Sum of Absolute Difference, SAD, is a similarity criterion for image registration. To get better document image registration accuracy, a document image registration method based on normalized SAD is proposed. In this method, a pre-processing procedure is performed to identify the inflection point for the normalized SAD registration. Then gray histogram of the matched image is normalized firstly so that the different laminations of the two document image can be eliminated. Then the two document images are registered by the SAD method. At last, a post-processing of the normalized SAD registration method is performed to the two <b>registered</b> <b>document</b> images so that the two distorted document images can be mosaiced together and get a flatter document image. Experimental {{results show that the}} document image registration method based on normalized SAD is more robust than the classical SAD method and the Optical Character Recognition (OCR) rate of the new mosaiced image is markedly higher than the two original distorted document images. </p...|$|E

Construction products in Europe should have European Conformity (CE) and Environmental Product Declaration (EPD), an independently verified and <b>registered</b> <b>document</b> in line with the European standard EN 15804. An EPD certificate can be created by performing a Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) study. In this particular work, an LCA study was carried out for a refractory brick production for environmental assessment. In addition to the LCA, the Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analysis was also applied for economic assessment. Firstly, a cradle-to-gate LCA was performed for one ton of magnesia spinel refractory brick. The CML IA method included in the licensed SimaPro 8. 0. 1 software was chosen to calculate impact categories (namely, abiotic depletion, global warming potential, acidification potential, eutrophication potential, human toxicity, ecotoxicity, ozone depletion potential, and photochemical oxidation potential). The LCC analysis was performed by developing a cost model for internal and external cost categories within the software. The results were supported by a sensitivity analysis. According to the results, the production of raw materials and the firing process in the magnesia spinel brick production were found to have several negative effects on the environment and were costly...|$|E
