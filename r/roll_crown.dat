40|$|A {{new kind}} of {{numerical}} method, Contact Element Method (CEM) with two relative coordinates, has been proposed. There are two main characteristics in this method. First, meshing {{is based on the}} contact length between the rolls or between the work roll and the strip; second, two relative coordinates are established for every element depending on the contact objects. A matrix for analyzing the rolling process of a Sendzimir mill has been established as well as a software SM 4 SM (Setup Models for Sendzimir Mill) by which the strip edge drop during rolling has been studied using the CEM. The calculated results show that the strip edge drop will decrease when increasing the 1 st intermediate roll (IMR) taper slope and length, reducing the 1 st IMR shifting, increasing the roll J and the work <b>roll</b> <b>crown,</b> or increasing the tension stress; by contraries, the strip edge drop will increase. Meanwhile, three methods (changing the work <b>roll</b> <b>crown,</b> changing the work roll edge rigidity, changing the pressure distribution on the work roll) for controlling the strip edge drop are discussed. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|This work {{presents}} improved {{technology for}} attaining high-quality rolled metal strip. The {{new technology is}} based on an innovative method to model both the static and dynamic characteristics of rolling mill deflection, and it applies equally to both cluster-type and non cluster-type rolling mill configurations. By effectively combining numerical Finite Element Analysis (FEA) with analytical solid mechanics, the devised approach delivers a rapid, accurate, flexible, high-fidelity model useful for optimizing many important rolling parameters. The associated static deflection model enables computation of the thickness profile and corresponding flatness of the rolled strip. Accurate methods of predicting the strip thickness profile and strip flatness are important in rolling mill design, rolling schedule set-up, control of mill flatness actuators, and optimization of ground roll profiles. The corresponding dynamic deflection model enables solution of the standard eigenvalue problem to determine natural frequencies and modes of vibration. The presented method for solving the roll-stack deflection problem offers several important advantages over traditional methods. In particular, it includes continuity of elastic foundations, non-iterative solution when using pre-determined elastic foundation moduli, continuous third-order displacement fields, simple stress-field determination, the ability to calculate dynamic characteristics, and a comparatively faster solution time. Consistent with the most advanced existing methods, the presented method accommodates loading conditions that represent <b>roll</b> <b>crowning,</b> <b>roll</b> bending, roll shifting, and roll crossing mechanisms. Validation of the static model is provided by comparing results and solution time with large-scale, commercial finite element simulations. In addition to examples with the common 4 -high vertical stand rolling mill, application of the presented method to the most complex of rolling mill configurations is demonstrated with an optimization example involving the 20 -high Sendzimir mill...|$|R

It was proved that the model can match the engineering precision requirement by the comparison between several calculated values and measured values of the work roll temperature.

50|$|Other {{methods of}} {{compensating}} for roll deformation include continual varying crown (CVC), pair cross rolling, and work roll bending. CVC {{was developed by}} SMS-Siemag AG and involves grinding a third order polynomial curve into the work rolls and then shifting the work rolls laterally, equally, and opposite to each other. The effect is that the rolls will have a gap between them that is parabolic in shape, and will vary with lateral shift, thus allowing {{for control of the}} <b>crown</b> of the <b>rolls</b> dynamically. Pair cross rolling involves using either flat or parabolically <b>crowned</b> <b>rolls,</b> but shifting the ends at an angle so that the gap between the edges of the rolls will increase or decrease, thus allowing for dynamic <b>crown</b> control.

40|$|The {{requirements}} for the manufacturers of steel have been increased in many respects in recent years. The harsh competition between the manufacturers requires a continuous reduction of the production costs and a successive improvement of product quality. The work presented herein {{is a part of}} efforts towards maximizing rolling mill throughput and minimizing processing costs and crop losses by computational intelligence based process modeling and optimisation in tandem cold rolling. It {{is the first time that}} the computational intelligence based optimisation has been applied to the rolling schedules of tandem cold rolling mills as is shown in this thesis. Rolling schedule is essential for a tandem cold strip mill operation. This involves the determination of inter-stand gauges, tensions and rolling speeds at individual stands. As the rolling process is examined and shown to be a nonlinear programming problem incorporated the complex interactions of multiple rolling parameters such as reductions, roll force and torque, rolling speeds and tensions. Each of the parameters can be set to a value in its admissible data range of float type, which is determined by threading conditions. The rolling schedule is a set of such rolling parameters. Therefore, different combinations of these rolling parameters generate numerous rolling schedules. Although some empirical rolling schedules may be reasonably satisfactory, however, it is hard to declare which schedule is the best solution. In this study, an intelligent searching mechanism is introduced to optimize the rolling schedule by assessing rolling constraints and the combined cost function of tension, shape and power distribution. The optimisation results have been compared with current rolling practices based on empirical models. It is shown that the proposed model can significantly reduce the power distribution cost, maximize the safe level of strip tension, and obtain good strip shape. The proposed model is generic for complex engineering problem optimisation, and is capable for Multiple-Objective Problem Solving (MOPS). A hybrid model of Influence Coefficient Method and Spring-Beam Method is proposed and verified for strip shape analysis and prediction. From the point of view of product quality, shape is an important parameter in the rolling process. Bad shape is a frequent cause for threading delay, rejection or rectification by costly means. Particularly for cold strip, the thinner the strip, the greater is the difficulty in maintaining good shape, which requires the optimum relationship of roll force, strip tension, work <b>roll</b> <b>crowns</b> and/or bending force. A physically based shape predictive model has been established, on the basis of which, a heuristic optimisation approach is employed to search for the optimum setting of the bending forces for those mill stands with bending systems, and to optimize reduction schedule for those without roll bending system. The proposed model has also been extended to optimize shape problem during threading by using optimal <b>roll</b> ground <b>crown</b> or optimum <b>roll</b> bending force. A comparison is made between results predicted by the proposed model and test results obtained on a production mill. The control of head and tail off-gauge is becoming increasingly important for many companies in the steel industry so as to maximize yield from their rolling operations. there are various kinds of fluctuations in unsteady states such as threading, acceleration, deceleration, and tailing out processes, and these fluctuations always accompany non-linearity and hysteresis, it is very difficult to accurately model, and then optimize and/or control these processes. Therefore, dynamic simulation and analysis of mill performance during these transient rolling phases, is vital in order to ensure that thickness is controlled within the desired tolerance. The significant advantage to be gained from the simulation is that the logic errors potentially existing in a rolling mill operation could be corrected and the mill performance could be improved. Innovative models for the unsteady rolling process simulation have been presented. The threading and acceleration processes have been dynamically simulated. The results generated from the simulation have been compared with the measurements of the strip produced from a production mill. The interactive relationships between roll force, exit thickness and inter-stand tensions are presented for both threading and acceleration processes. The speed dependent rolling parameters for acceleration process are analyzed and taken into account in the simulation. Deceleration and tailing-out processes are also addressed, as they are similar to acceleration and threading processes, respectively. The proposed model has also been examined with respect to changes in initial conditions such as friction between work rolls and strip, strip properties and work roll profile. The proposed models and simulations have been implemented and verified with plant data. The numerical simulations together with their result analysis will be beneficial to fine-tune the rolling process parameters and are effective in achieving significant cost savings and product quality improvements...|$|R

This problem is most of the time addressed in a decoupled way, i. e. as a post-processing of the residual stresses computed by a strip rolling model; the present paper on the contrary describes a fully coupled approach of in-bite plastic deformation and post-bite buckling. For this purpose, a simple buckling criterion has been introduced in a FEM model of strip and roll deformation, Lam 3 /Tec 3; its implementation is documented in details. The capabilities and limits of the present approach are described and discussed. Characterised by its coupled approach, it is primarily devoted to cases where on-line (under tension) manifested defects occur. It is shown that the impact of the post-bite, post-buckled stress field on the in-bite stress and strain fields is quite small in the cases investigated; however, subtle changes appear in the velocity field at bite exit, and this is sufficient to transform completely the post-bite stress field, which is found in much better agreement with measurements if such a coupled treatment is use...|$|R
