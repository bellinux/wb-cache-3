30|$|Due to {{the absence}} of {{official}} data on nutrient consumption, we <b>resort</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> literature on nutrient consumption and deficiencies in Lebanon to interpret the significance of our results. In terms of vitamins, the reduced intake of vitamin A, found usually in milk, potatoes, green leafy vegetables, carrots, oranges and fish, may be attributed to a large extent to the drop in the consumptions of potatoes and powdered milk (Table  5), adding insult to the injury of low fish consumption in the country (Nasreddine et al. [2006]). Indeed data from the “Nutrition and Non-Communicable Disease Risk Factor Survey” on vitamin A intakes in Lebanon indicate that around 40 percent of children aged five to ten and 63 percent of adolescents are already consuming less than two thirds of the recommended daily intake (N. Hwalla, unpublished data, 2009). Therefore, this extra reduction in vitamin A intake is problematic under the prevailing consumption patterns and may have serious implications on the nutritional status of children and adolescents, given its vital role in the normal growth and repair of all body tissues as well as the sound functioning of the visual and immune systems (Kennedy, Nantel, & Shetty [2003]).|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, people {{normally}} <b>resort</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> knock-on mechanism [8] to explain or predict the energetic (ion or electron) beam-induced nanophenomena including beam-induced dynamic atomic defect creation and annihilation and atom transport processes on LDNs. However, {{it has been}} demonstrated that knock-on mechanism cannot offer a full explanation for the experimentally observed beam-induced nanophenomena, especially for these such as the plastic flow or wetting of carbon nanotube [9] and amorphous SiOx nanowire [7], or the shrinking nanocavity along with its cavity-near-surface preferential amorphization [5, 10, 11] as observed earlier in silicon during energetic beam irradiation. This is because the existing theories such as the knock-on mechanism were at the first place built on consideration {{of the nature of}} equilibrium, symmetry, periodicity, and linearity of bulk crystalline structure or its approximation, whereas the beam (including electron, ion, and photon beams)-induced nanophenomena are intrinsically of non-equilibrium, amorphous, and non-linear nature. The previous research [5, 9 – 12] has demonstrated that our proposed nanocurvature or nanosize effect [5, 13] and energetic beam-induced athermal activation or nanotime (soft mode and instability of atomic vibration) effect [5, 6] could well explain the above beam-induced nanophenomena and widespreadly control the beam-induced structure changes and nanoprocessing of LDNs. Thus, it has been further asserted that both nanocurvature effect and beam-induced athermal activation effect would control as well dynamic behaviors of atom diffusion and evaporation of one-dimensional (1 D) nanowire during uniform e-beam irradiation. However, there is no report found to demonstrate the effects of nanocurvature and beam-induced athermal activation on the structure changes of nanowires during uniform e-beam irradiation (so far, the only report we can found dealing with the above effects on e-beam-induced structure changes or nanoprocessing of nanowires is in reference [7] but under focused e-beam irradiation). Thus, the nanocurvature effect and beam-induced athermal activation effect underlying the dynamics of atom diffusion and evaporation in nanowires under uniform e-beam irradiation remain unclear.|$|E
25|$|The Second Vatican Council {{assembled}} approximately 2500 major prelates {{from all}} five continents. It {{soon became clear}} that a dividing up of this large body was necessary.

40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial {{fulfillment of}} the requirements for the Degree of Master of Science in Information Technology (MSIT) at Strathmore UniversityAutomatic Meter Reading (AMR), is the technology of automatically collecting data from metering devices (electric, water, gas) and transferring that data to a central database for billing and/or further analysis. Power utility firms {{have an obligation to}} bill their customers based on actual meter readings taken. However, provision of these services have had challenges. This leads <b>to</b> <b>the</b> issue of estimated readings and an inconvenient billing method that is based on incorrect readings. This is normally evident during the power meter-reading period when some power consumers influence clerks to evade paying their power bills. A common phenomenon in some cases is either where the same field clerks take wrong readings or end up over/underestimating the customer’s consumption. This ends up inconveniencing customers budgeting. In a bid to address this issue, Kenya Power Company has <b>resorted</b> <b>to</b> retrofitting <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> conventional post-paid meters with prepaid meters. This is however expensive and would {{take a long time to}} implement. This study proposes a solution for automatic meter reading by use of an ATmega 328 P MCU. This will entail an ACS 712 current sensor that will be connected onto a power meter coupled to a LoRa gateway through a LPWAN for transmission of data to a cloud server for subsequent upload and analysis. Agile software methodology was used which allowed faster iteration and more frequent release with subsequent user feedback. This solution would not require replacement of <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> meters, making it cost effective and fast to implement. This study provides a solution that can enable the users have information on their readings, rate of billing and be able to report on any power issues affecting them. This will also help the power providers have their customers’ advice, which would aid in decision-making processes...|$|R

40|$|The complex {{exponential}} basis expansion model (CE-BEM) {{provides an}} accurate description for the time-varying (TV) channels encountered in mobile communications.

In this paper, we propose a novel method <b>to</b> estimate <b>the</b> basis frequencies for blind identification and equalization of time-varying single-input multiple-output (SIMO) finite-impulse-response (FIR) channels. The proposed method exploits only the second-order statistics of channel outputs and does not require strong conditions on the source signal. As a result, it exhibits superior performance <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>existing</b> basis frequency estimation methods. The validity of our method is demonstrated by numerical simulations...|$|R
