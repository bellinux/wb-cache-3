5|$|Amid {{reports of}} looting, {{concerns}} were {{raised about the}} safety of the antiquities of the famous Egyptian Museum, near the epicenter of the Cairo protests. Egyptian state television announced in the evening that army commandos had secured the museum. Protesters joined soldiers in protecting the museum, situated beside the burning ruling party headquarters. Looters managed to enter during the night from the roof to damage a number of small artifacts, and it was initially reported that they had <b>ripped</b> <b>the</b> heads off two mummies, but subsequent reports claimed that Egypt's top archaeologist had mistaken skulls from other skeletons, and that the mummies were intact.|$|E

5|$|Around noon, as {{a result}} of poor {{coordination}} and signaling, the Swedish line unexpectedly turned toward the allied fleet. When the flagship Kronan came about in the maneuver it suddenly heeled over and began to take in water. According to master gunner Anders Gyllenspak, the sails were not reefed and the ship leaned over so hard that water flooded in through the lower gunports. As the ship was leaning over, a gust of wind pushed the ship on her side, bringing her masts and sails down in line with the surface of the sea. Shortly afterwards, the gunpowder store exploded and <b>ripped</b> <b>the</b> forward section of the starboard side apart. Kronan quickly lost buoyancy and sank, taking most of her 850-man crew with her.|$|E
5|$|A {{dense fog}} helped to cloud {{the advance of}} St. Hilaire's French division, but as they went up the slope the legendary 'Sun of Austerlitz' <b>ripped</b> <b>the</b> mist apart and {{encouraged}} them forward. Russian soldiers and commanders {{on top of the}} heights were stunned to see so many French troops coming towards them. Allied commanders moved some of the delayed detachments of the fourth column into this bitter struggle. Over an hour of fighting destroyed much of this unit. The other men from the second column, mostly inexperienced Austrians, also participated in the struggle and swung the numbers against one of the best fighting forces in the French army, eventually forcing them to withdraw down the slopes. However, gripped by desperation, St. Hilaire's men struck hard once more and bayoneted the Allies out of the heights. To the north, General Vandamme's division attacked an area called Staré Vinohrady ("Old Vineyards") and, through talented skirmishing and deadly volleys, broke several Allied battalions.|$|E
5|$|Then, after flying past McCudden in a head-on firing pass, Voss's Fokker was {{hit with}} bullets on the {{starboard}} side by Hoidge. Meantime, Rhys Davids had pulled aside to change an ammunition drum; he rejoined combat with a 150meter (500foot) height advantage over Voss's altitude of 450meters (1,500feet), and began a long flat dive onto the tail of Voss' triplane. At point-blank range, he holed the German aircraft end to end with his machine guns before turning. It wandered into his line of flight again, in a gentle westward glide; Rhys Davids again <b>ripped</b> <b>the</b> German plane as its engine quit. The aircraft missed a mid-air collision by inches. The British ace fired again. As the triplane's glide steepened, Rhys Davids overran him at about 300meters (1,000feet) altitude and lost sight of his opponent. From above, Bowman saw the Fokker in {{what could have been}} a landing glide, right up until it stalled. It then flipped inverted and nose down, dropping directly to earth. The resulting smash left only the rudder intact.|$|E

5|$|As {{the tornado}} crossed South Richard Road, it {{intensified}} {{into a very}} high-end EF4 and inflicted catastrophic damage to several large homes as it impacted the Deer Creek subdivision. Well-built homes along South Richard Road and East Kuehl Court were leveled and swept from their foundations with debris strewn downwind. Several vehicles parked at these residences were moved some distance or tossed, and wind rowing of debris occurred. One house had its concrete walkway pulled {{a few inches from}} its original location, and notable scouring of lawn grass was observed in the subdivision. These structures were estimated to have been impacted by winds near 200mph (320km/h), the upper bound of an EF4 tornado. The homes swept away in this area were bolted to their foundations and there is some speculation that the tornado may have reached EF5 intensity at this point, though close inspection revealed that some of the washers were missing from the anchor bolts, and that low-lying shrubbery near the homes was left mostly intact, preventing a higher rating. Continuing northeast, the tornado temporarily weakened as it destroyed a few large barns or outbuildings, <b>ripped</b> <b>the</b> roof off two brick residences, and collapsed most walls of another house, but once again gained strength as it approached Illinois Route 64. A large restaurant and a residence had their exterior walls collapsed.|$|E
5|$|The {{policy was}} {{supported}} by the Howards and other Catholic-leaning ministers and diplomats—together known as the Spanish Party—but deeply distrusted in Protestant England. When Sir Walter Raleigh was released from imprisonment in 1616, he embarked on a hunt for gold in South America with strict instructions from James not to engage the Spanish. Raleigh's expedition was a disastrous failure, and his son Walter was killed fighting the Spanish. On Raleigh's return to England, James had him executed to the indignation of the public, who opposed the appeasement of Spain. James's policy was further jeopardised by the outbreak of the Thirty Years' War, especially after his Protestant son-in-law, Frederick V, Elector Palatine, was ousted from Bohemia by the Catholic Emperor Ferdinand II in 1620, and Spanish troops simultaneously invaded Frederick's Rhineland home territory. Matters came to a head when James finally called a Parliament in 1621 to fund a military expedition in support of his son-in-law. The Commons on the one hand granted subsidies inadequate to finance serious military operations in aid of Frederick, and on the other—remembering the profits gained under Elizabeth by naval attacks on Spanish gold shipments—called for a war directly against Spain. In November 1621, roused by Sir Edward Coke, they framed a petition asking not only for war with Spain but also for Prince Charles to marry a Protestant, and for enforcement of the anti-Catholic laws. James flatly told them not to interfere in matters of royal prerogative or they would risk punishment, which provoked them into issuing a statement protesting their rights, including freedom of speech. Urged on by the Duke of Buckingham and the Spanish ambassador Gondomar, James <b>ripped</b> <b>the</b> protest out of the record book and dissolved Parliament.|$|E

According to Jeff Grub of VentureBeat, websites such as Tumblr were overflowing with sexualized fanart of the characters at the time.|$|E
25|$|After {{winning the}} toss and electing to bat, England {{initially}} {{looked to be}} in a promising position as Gooch and Stewart put on 123 for the first wicket. This {{turned out to be the}} biggest partnership of the match though, as from that point on, wickets fell at regular intervals. Waqar Younis <b>ripped</b> <b>the</b> heart out of the England middle order, removing Lamb, Botham and Lewis on the way to figures of 5–91.

25|$|Billy Murdoch won the toss for Australia {{and chose}} to bat first.

The captain himself tried to offer resistance with a slow defensive 13, and experienced wicket-keeper/batsman Jack Blackham top-scored with 17, but the only other batsman to reach double-figures was Tom Garrett with 10. Inspired bowling from opening bowler Ted Peate who took 4 for 31, and Dick Barlow who produced a devastating 5 for 19, <b>ripped</b> <b>the</b> Australian batting order apart on a greenish wicket that gave more assistance that it first seemed.|$|E
