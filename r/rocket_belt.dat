5|$|Thanks to special-effects man John Stears, Thunderballs pretitle teaser, the Aston Martin DB5 (introduced in Goldfinger), reappears {{armed with}} rear-firing water cannon, seeming noticeably {{weathered}} – just dust and dirt, raised moments earlier by Bond's landing with the Bell <b>Rocket</b> <b>Belt</b> (developed by Bell Aircraft Corporation). The <b>rocket</b> <b>belt</b> Bond uses {{to escape the}} château actually worked, and was used many times, before and after, for entertainment, most notably at Super Bowl I and at scheduled performances at the 1964–1965 New York World's Fair.|$|E
5|$|Pilotwings is {{an amateur}} flight {{simulator}} {{game in which}} the player attempts to earn pilot licenses through lessons in light plane flight, hang gliding, skydiving, {{and the use of}} a <b>rocket</b> <b>belt.</b> Bonus stages and levels involving an attack helicopter are also available. Each event offers unique controls and gameplay mechanics. To increase the realism of the game's flight simulation, the developers extensively utilized the SNES Mode 7 capability, which mimics 3D graphics by rotating and scaling flat objects.|$|E
5|$|Some {{events have}} bonus stages that add to a player's score, {{even if it}} has already reached the maximum number. In the skydiving, <b>rocket</b> <b>belt,</b> and hang glider modes, landing on moving {{platforms}} rewards players with a perfect score, and a bonus stage for extra points may be earned by falling into the water of a target area. These stages include maneuvering a diving penguin into a pool, bouncing a winged man across a series of trampolines, and flying another winged man as far as possible.|$|E
25|$|The great {{disadvantage}} is {{the limited}} operating time. The jet of steam and oxygen can provide significant thrust from fairly lightweight rockets, but the jet has {{a relatively low}} exhaust velocity and hence a poor specific impulse. Currently, such <b>rocket</b> <b>belts</b> can only fly for about 30 seconds (because of the limited amount of fuel the user can carry unassisted).|$|R
5000|$|Inertia Winder - The inertia winder is {{a device}} of Cooperative origin that can absorb and store kinetic energy. [...] Two {{of these devices}} are known to exist on Earth; the other is built into <b>Rocket’s</b> <b>belt</b> buckle. Originally, Curtis {{installed}} the winder {{in the bottom of}} the elevator shaft that Curtis used to an access the underground lab he used as Hardware. This use of the winder became unnecessary when Hardware struck his alliance with Alva.|$|R
25|$|One of {{the largest}} {{stumbling}} blocks that would-be rocket pack builders have faced is the difficulty of obtaining concentrated hydrogen peroxide, which is no longer produced by many chemical companies. The few companies that produce high-concentration hydrogen peroxide only sell to large corporations or governments, forcing some amateurs and professionals to {{set up their own}} hydrogen peroxide distillation installations. High-concentration hydrogen peroxide for <b>rocket</b> <b>belts</b> was produced by Peroxide Propulsion (Gothenburg, Sweden) from 2004 to 2010, but after a serious accident Peroxide Propulsion stopped making it.|$|R
5|$|The first event, {{the light}} plane, {{requires}} the player {{to follow a}} guide path of orbs, or to fly through rings of orbs, and then land on the runway. In the second event, skydiving, the player jumps from a helicopter at a high altitude and maneuvers by leaning forward and back, and by rotating on a horizontal axis. The player must fall through rings of orbs in the sky before deploying the parachute, and must then attempt to land in a target area made up of concentric circles, with marks indicating the points awarded. The third event sees the player taking control of a <b>rocket</b> <b>belt,</b> which can be controlled with left and right yaw rotation, leaning forward and back to control speed. High {{and low levels of}} thrust allow high speed and finer control, respectively. The player must take off and fly through a series of rings, bars, or other objects before landing in a target area. The objective of the fourth event, hang gliding, is to catch thermal currents (represented by ascending white dots), reach a specified altitude, and then land {{as close as possible to}} the center of a gray square target.|$|E

5000|$|Operation Jefferson Glenn {{ran from}} September 5, 1970 to October 8, 1971 {{and was the}} last major {{operation}} in which U.S. ground forces participated in Vietnam and the final major offensive in which the 101st Airborne Division fought.. This was a joint military operation combining forces of the 101st Airborne and the 1st Infantry Division of the Army of the Republic of Vietnam (ARVN). The purpose of this operation was to shield critical installations in Huế and Da Nang by patrolling communist <b>rocket</b> <b>belts</b> {{along the edge of}} the mountains. During the 399 days of operations the allied troops established multiple firebases throughout Thua Thien Province and regularly encountered North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and Viet Cong (VC) troops.|$|R
5000|$|Bell Aerosystems began {{development}} of a rocket pack which it called the [...] "Bell Rocket Belt" [...] or [...] "man-rocket" [...] for the US Army in the mid 1950s. It was demonstrated in 1961 but 5 gallons of hydrogen peroxide as fuel for 21 seconds of flight time did not impress the army and development was cancelled. This concept was revived in the 1990s and today these packs can provide powerful, manageable thrust. This <b>rocket</b> <b>belt's</b> propulsion works with superheated water vapour. A gas cylinder contains nitrogen gas, and two cylinders containing highly concentrated hydrogen peroxide. The nitrogen presses the hydrogen peroxide onto a catalyst, which decomposes the hydrogen peroxide into a mixture of superheated steam and oxygen with a temperature of about 740 °C. This was led by two insulated curved tubes to two nozzles where it blasted out, supplying the propulsion. The pilot can vector the thrust by altering {{the direction of the}} nozzles through hand-operated controls. To protect from resulting burns the pilot had to wear insulating clothes.|$|R

50|$|The {{museum is}} housed inside a Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad {{passenger}} depot {{that was also}} used by the Chicago, Milwaukee, St. Paul and Pacific. The depot is listed on the National Register of Historic Places as Chicago/ Rock Island & Pacific Railroad Passenger Depot and also has been known as just Rock Island Depot.The depot opened in 1899 and would become a daily stop for the Rocky Mountain Rocket, Midwest Hiawatha, the Arrow, and Corn <b>Belt</b> <b>Rocket</b> {{before the end of}} passenger service in 1970. Similar Rock Island passenger depots were also constructed in Iowa City, Iowa and Ottawa, Illinois.|$|R

2500|$|A {{hydrogen}} peroxide-powered {{engine is}} based on the decomposition reaction of These nut peroxide. Nearly pure (90% in the Bell <b>Rocket</b> <b>Belt)</b> hydrogen peroxide is used. Pure hydrogen peroxide is relatively stable, but in contact with a catalyst (for example, silver) it decomposes into a mixture of superheated steam and oxygen in less than 1/10 millisecond, increasing in volume 5,000 times: 2 H2O2 → 2 H2O + O2. The reaction is exothermic, i.e., accompanied by the liberation of much heat (about [...] ), forming in this case a steam-gas mixture at [...] This hot gas is used exclusively as the reaction mass and is fed directly to one or more jet nozzles.|$|E
5000|$|The Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad Passenger Station is a {{historic}} building located in Iowa City, Iowa, United States. Built in 1898 for passenger use, {{it was the second}} depot in the city. [...] The first one was built by the Mississippi and Missouri Railroad, a predecessor of the Chicago, Rock Island and Pacific Railroad (CRI&P), in 1855. This one was built through the efforts of Harry Breene, the local Rock Island agent. W.K. McFarlin, CRI&P's superintendent of maintenance and construction oversaw the building's construction. Architecturally, it is a combination of the Richardsonian Romanesque and Victorian Romanesque. The depot was built to similar designs of stations in Ottawa, Illinois and Council Bluffs, Iowa. Service included the CRI&P's Corn <b>Belt</b> <b>Rocket</b> and Rocky Mountain Rocket passenger lines. [...] The depot ceased operations in 1970, although the railroad continued to maintain offices here. In 1982 it was acquired by a couple of attorneys for their offices. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places the same year. The building sits adjacent to the Iowa Interstate Railroad lines, and the railroad has operated occasional excursion trains that have stopped at the former depot.|$|R
2500|$|High-concentration [...] is {{referred}} to as [...] "high-test peroxide" [...] (HTP). It can be used either as a monopropellant (not mixed with fuel) or as the oxidizer component of a bipropellant rocket. Use as a monopropellant takes advantage of the decomposition of 70–98% concentration hydrogen peroxide into steam and oxygen. The propellant is pumped into a reaction chamber, where a catalyst, usually a silver or platinum screen, triggers decomposition, producing steam at over , which is expelled through a nozzle, generating thrust. [...] monopropellant produces a maximal specific impulse (Isp) of 161 s (1.6 kN·s/kg). Peroxide was the first major monopropellant adopted for use in rocket applications. Hydrazine eventually replaced hydrogen-peroxide monopropellant thruster applications primarily because of a 25% increase in the vacuum specific impulse. Hydrazine (toxic) and hydrogen peroxide (less-toxic [...] ) are the only two monopropellants (other than cold gases) to have been widely adopted and utilized for propulsion and power applications. The Bell <b>Rocket</b> <b>Belt,</b> reaction-control systems for X-1, X-15, Centaur, Mercury, Little Joe, as well as the turbo-pump gas generators for X-1, X-15, Jupiter, Redstone and Viking used hydrogen peroxide as a monopropellant.|$|E
