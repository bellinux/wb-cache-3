25|$|<b>Rinderpest</b> (also <b>cattle</b> <b>plague</b> or steppe murrain) was an {{infectious}} viral disease of cattle, domestic buffalo, {{and some other}} species of even-toed ungulates, including buffaloes, large antelope and deer, giraffes, wildebeests, and warthogs. The disease was characterized by fever, oral erosions, diarrhea, lymphoid necrosis, and high mortality. Death rates during outbreaks were usually extremely high, approaching 100% in immunologically naïve populations. Rinderpest was mainly transmitted by direct contact and by drinking contaminated water, although {{it could also be}} transmitted by air. After a global eradication campaign, the last confirmed case of rinderpest was diagnosed in 2001.|$|R
25|$|The {{depopulated}} {{and apparently}} primevally wild Africa seen in wildlife documentary films {{was formed in}} the 19th century by disease, a combination of rinderpest and the tsetse fly. In 1887, the rinderpest virus was accidentally imported in livestock brought by an Italian expeditionary force to Eritrea. It spread rapidly, reaching Ethiopia by 1888, the Atlantic coast by 1892, and South Africa by 1897. <b>Rinderpest,</b> a <b>cattle</b> <b>plague</b> from central Asia, killed over 90% of the cattle of the pastoral peoples such as the Masai of east Africa. With no native immunity, most of the population – some 5.5 million cattle – died in southern Africa. Pastoralists were left with no animals, their source of income; farmers were deprived of their working animals for ploughing and irrigation. The pandemic coincided with a period of drought, causing widespread famine. The starving human populations died of smallpox, cholera, typhoid and diseases imported from Europe. It is estimated that {{two thirds of the}} Masai died in 1891.|$|R
50|$|Although {{there was}} a Spanish Royal Decree that was issued on May 31, 1828 {{assigning}} {{that there should be}} one veterinarian for the Philippine islands (a number later increased to two veterinarians in 1843), the highlight of the history of veterinary medicine in the Philippines was in 1888, when the need to investigate the occurrence of the <b>Rinderpest</b> epizootic (<b>cattle</b> <b>plague)</b> in the Philippine islands emerged. The <b>cattle</b> <b>plague</b> that affected the cow and carabao (water buffalo) population between Manila and Bulacan were caused by sick animals that were imported from Indochina and Hong Kong. The Commission assigned to perform the investigation was appointed by Don Benigno Quiroga y Ballesteros, the Director General of the Administraction Civil de Filipinas (Civil Administration of the Philippines) during that time. The Commission was composed of an army veterinarian, a pharmacist, and a medical doctor. The army veterinarian and head of the Commission was Don Gines Geis y Gotzens. The pharmacist was Don Anacleto del Rosario y Sales, who at the time was the Director of the Laboratorio Municipal de Manila (Municipal Laboratory of Manila). The physician was Don Francisco Masip, an official in-charge of public health. The 1888 <b>cattle</b> <b>plague</b> (also known as steppe murrain) prompted the need for the services of veterinarians in the Philippines, including those from the ranks (commissioned officers) of the Spanish Army. The effects of the plague lasted from 1888 through 1939, meaning it moved on from Spanish period up to the American period {{in the history of the}} Philippines. From 1901 to 1902 alone, more than 600,000 cattle and water buffaloes were killed by the disease.|$|R
50|$|Valli also {{conducted}} experiments dealing with vaccination, {{a field in}} which he was less successful. In 1788, he unsuccessfully tried to vaccinate humans against 'human plague' by inoculating <b>rinderpest</b> (<b>cattle</b> <b>plague).</b> In testing potential vaccines for the Rabies virus on himself, he caused his own premature death.|$|E
50|$|Epidemics {{of cattle}} disease, {{including}} {{foot and mouth disease}} in 1839, several outbreaks of pleuropneumonia, and <b>rinderpest</b> (<b>cattle</b> <b>plague)</b> in 1865-66, {{led to the}} formation of numerous friendly societies and mutual associations to provide assistance to farmers; several were sponsored by the landowners of the county's major estates, particularly Cholmondeley, Crewe and Peckforton. A short-lived cattle insurance company was also established in Knutsford in 1865. The 1865-66 rinderpest epidemic affected much of England but was particularly devastating in Cheshire; entire herds died and the county's economy collapsed for 18 months.|$|E
50|$|Estimates {{based on}} modern {{molecular}} biology place {{the emergence of}} measles as a human disease sometime after 500 AD (the former speculation that the Antonine Plague of 165-180 AD was caused by measles is now discounted). The first systematic description of measles, and its distinction from smallpox and chickenpox, is credited to the Persian physician Rhazes (860-932), who published The Book of Smallpox and Measles. Given what is now known about the evolution of measles, Rhazes' account is remarkably timely, as recent work that examined the mutation rate of the virus indicates the measles virus emerged from <b>rinderpest</b> (<b>cattle</b> <b>plague)</b> as a zoonotic disease between 1100 and 1200 AD, a period {{that may have been}} preceded by limited outbreaks involving a virus not yet fully acclimated to humans. This agrees with the observation that measles requires a susceptible population of >500,000 to sustain an epidemic, a situation that occurred in historic times following the growth of medieval European cities.|$|E
