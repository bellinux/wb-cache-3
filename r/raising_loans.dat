5|$|On 3February, {{the head}} of the State Emergency Service (SES) and then-Premier Joh Bjelke-Petersen toured {{northern}} Queensland to inspect damage. The government of Australia vowed to assist by providing financial and emergency services, also offering to provide aid to banana and sugar cane farmers who suffered losses as a result of Winifred. Two government helicopters were sent shortly thereafter, assessing the severity of damage, evacuating residents, and delivering food. Bjelke-Petersen later expressed anger at the federal government for having increased the threshold for disaster relief before <b>raising</b> <b>loans,</b> and also stated that the Federal Minister for Primary Industry, John Kerin, had no right to accompany him on his visit to northern Queensland, only offering to discuss an offer provided that the federal government was willing to provide financial assistance. Approximately 500volunteers for the SES were deployed the same day, reinstating electrical and other essential services, evacuating regional citizens, delivering bread to numerous towns, and sending 700tarpaulins to shield roofless houses. Rescue and relief work was hindered by high traffic on telephone networks, forcing Telecom to cease calls between Townsville and Ingham.|$|E

50|$|As Chancellor of the Exchequer, Perceval had {{to raise}} money to finance the war against Napoleon. This he managed to do in his budgets of 1808 and 1809 without {{increasing}} taxes, by <b>raising</b> <b>loans</b> at reasonable rates and making economies. As leader of the House of Commons he had to deal with a strong opposition, which challenged the government over the conduct of the war, Catholic emancipation, corruption and Parliamentary reform. Perceval successfully defended the commander-in-chief of the army, the Duke of York, against charges of corruption when the Duke's ex-mistress Mary Anne Clarke claimed to have sold army commissions with his knowledge. Although Parliament voted to acquit the Duke of the main charge, his conduct was criticised and he accepted Perceval's advice to resign. (He was re-instated in 1811).|$|E
50|$|The APM mill at Petrie was {{the largest}} {{industrial}} undertaking in southern Queensland during the immediate post-war period and probably the largest individual industrial unit to be constructed {{by the private sector}} in Queensland to that date. It made an important contribution to the post-war development of Queensland's secondary industries. Prior to World War II, Queensland lacked secondary industries of any note and from the 1950s the Queensland government encouraged their growth. The State assisted APM to establish the mill and assisted with financing the water supply scheme by granting a 50% subsidy and helping with <b>raising</b> <b>loans.</b> In 2004, the Petrie Mill was the only coated carton board manufacturing plant in Australia, producing about thirty different carton board products and with production exceeding 140,000 tonnes per annum.|$|E

5000|$|In 1761 De Pinto and {{his brother}} Aron went {{bankrupt}} maybe {{as a result of}} <b>raising</b> <b>loans</b> of 6 or 6.6 million guilders for the British government, in either 1759 or 1761; his brother sold his house on Nieuwe Herengracht. De Pinto moved to Paris, where he met with James Cockburn, Lord Hertford, Mattheus Lestevenon, David Hume John Russell, 4th Duke of Bedford and Denis Diderot. Then he moved to The Hague and lived in a mansion at Lange Voorhout; he and his family were invited to the palace when Mozart and his sister played. In 1767 he went to London, met with Lord Bute where he received a pension for his advice on the Treaty of Paris (1763), as the British gained influence over the French in India through his suggestion. [...] "He pointed out that if the British did not obtain this change, war would probably break out again." [...] In 1768, Pinto sent a letter to Diderot on Du Jeu de Cartes. His Traité de la Circulation et du Crédit in which [...] "he convinced many people that England was not on the verge of bankruptcy", started in 1761, appeared in Amsterdam in 1771. He disagreed with Hume, Vivant de Mezague and Mirabeau. His treatise was twice reprinted, besides being translated into English by Philip Francis (politician) and into German by Carl August von Struensee. His Précis des Arguments Contre les Matérialistes was published at The Hague in 1774. Pinto published mainly in French and once in Portuguese. He seems also to have Jean-Paul Marat, whom he pushed from the stairs and ordered to leave his house. In 1776 he wrote against the American revolutionaries; he did approve the Boston Tea Party. Around 1780 he disapproved an alliance of the Dutch Republic with France.|$|E
5000|$|In 1639 Reynardson {{purchased}} his {{manor house}} at Tottenham. In the same year, {{he was elected}} Sheriff of London and became treasurer of the Levant Company until 1641. In 1640 he took an assignment of Sir W. Acton's house in Bishopsgate Street. He served as Sheriff and master of the Merchant Taylors company from 1640 to 1641. He sympathised with the Royalist cause and as master of the Merchant Taylors he helped to respond to King Charles's demand for a loan from the city companies in 1640. On 12 November 1640, he was elected an alderman of the City of London for Bishopsgate ward. He {{was a member of}} the committee of the East India Company from 1641 to 1650. Neither he nor his colleagues on the court of the company assisted the corporation, except under compulsion, in <b>raising</b> <b>loans</b> for the parliament in 1642 and 1643. In 1648 became Alderman for Candlewick ward. [...] In 1648 Reynardson was elected Lord Mayor of London, the first Devonshire man to become Lord Mayor. His election sermon was preached by Obadiah Sedgwick, an eloquent divine, whom Oliver Cromwell had stigmatised as [...] "a rascally priest." [...] Reynardson soon came into conflict with the Rump Parliament, which had declared all oaths of allegiance to the king illegal. He refused to admit to the common council members who had not made the customary loyal subscription, but parliament retaliated on 5 January 1649 by ordering him to assemble the council and suspend the taking of oaths. Expecting resistance, they further directed him to remove the chains which had been placed across the streets as a protection from cavalry charges. Reynardson did not countenance the act constituting the court for the trial of King Charles and it was read in his absence at the Exchange and in Cheapside by the sergeant-at-arms, with the commons' mace upon his shoulder. Reynardson presided at a meeting of the common council on 9 January when a petition was read which had been circulated in the city, affirming [...] "that the commons of England, in parliament assembled, have the supreme power of this nation". A committee recommended the petition's adoption, but when this recommendation was brought up at the meeting of the council on 13 January Reynardson refused to put the question. The debate on the subject lasted from eleven in the morning till eight in the evening, when the lord mayor left, and the resolution for presenting the petition was carried. The House of Commons took no proceedings against the Reynardson, but passed an ordinance that, if the mayor failed to call a meeting of the council on the requisition of six members, any forty of the members could convene the council without the Lord Mayor's presence. After the execution of Charles on 30 January, Reynardson held in his possession the [...] "personal treaty," [...] which was subscribed by most of the common council in favour of the proposed treaty between Charles and the parliament. Reynardson burnt the document [...] "to ashes privately in his chamber," [...] because it contained the names of leading citizens who had by their signatures approved its loyal sentiments. Reynardson accepted the presidency of St Bartholomew's Hospital in February 1649. On 23 March a copy of the act proclaiming the abolition of the kingly office was brought to Reynardson's house. When he refused to make it public, he was summoned to the bar of the House of Commons. He pleaded his conscientious scruples, but the house ordered him to pay a fine of £2,000, to be imprisoned in the Tower of London for two months, and to be deposed from the mayoralty. The court of aldermen at once took possession of the insignia, and proceeded to the election of a new mayor. Reynardson's tenure of office had brought with it a heavy pecuniary burden. By his own statement, he lost as much as £20,000 while mayor. When he refused to pay the fine imposed by parliament, [...] "his goods, household stuff, and wearing apparel were ordered to be sold by the candle." [...] In September 1649 he resigned the presidency of St Bartholomew's, on account of ill-health. Part of his fine was not paid, and on 7 May 1651, an order was issued that the whole of his estate was to be seized until the fine was liquidated. He {{was a member of the}} committee of the East India Company from 1653 to 1654 and from 1655 to 1656.|$|E

30|$|Solvency is {{measured}} by the ratio of total capital (sum of tier 1 and tier 2 capital) to risk-weighted asset, which reflects the strength of a bank.

On the contrary, a low level of capital places pressure on banks’ managers to accumulate more assets and returns, which may <b>raise</b> <b>loans</b> losses.|$|R
40|$|Phone Banking is a {{facility}} enabling customers {{to make use}} of banking services, such as oral payment instructions, account movements, <b>raising</b> <b>loans</b> etc, over the telephone at their convenience rather than by personal visit. Phone banking service was possible because of implementation of Core Banking System. It is a type of banking, in which a person, who opens a bank account in a particular branch of a bank, will be a customer of the bank, rather than being a customer of a particular branch. Therefore, he can transact anywhere, at any time. The prime impact of the Core Banking System is that it facilitates banking operations like ATM's, Electronic fund, Transfers, Phone banking, Internet banking, Mobile banking etc. An attempt has made in this paper to study the perception of retail customers while using phone banking services with respect to Knowledge assimilation, Professional and Friendly behavior of phone banking officers.

40|$|Abstract. In Denmark, {{taxation}} {{of residential}} property returns varies considerably {{with the type}} of ownership and type of tenure in terms of the way income is calculated, the types of taxes applied and tax rates, which range from 0 % to above 60 %. Together with other housing subsidies this disparity in taxation contributes to the pronounced lack of tenure neutrality in the Danish housing market. The paper illustrates how tax rules alone create distortions and imbalances in the housing and residential property markets and discusses as well the magnitude of the imbalances. The method used is the application of a set of return and user cost equations. The tax aspects of the long-standing rather unequal treatment of private rental dwellings, social rental dwellings, owner-occupied dwellings and private co-operative dwellings, which have drawn decisive tracks in the markets, are discussed. The lowering of the tax rate for the return of institutional pension savings to 15 % which came into effect in 2001 has created a substantial advantage for pension funds compared with private investors with regard to investments in rental residential properties. The owner-occupiers’ user costs and subsidization are shown to depend on their capital structure and to a large extent they depend on whether the owners’ most obvious savings alternatives are either personal investments with heavily taxed returns or institutional pension savings with lightly taxed returns. Also private co-operative associations are tax exempted, and this fact in combination with the prospects of improved legal conditions for <b>raising</b> <b>loans</b> to finance the individual apartments will almost certainly lead to this form of tenure – as "tax free ownership" – capturing part of the market for owner occupation...|$|E
