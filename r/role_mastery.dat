40|$|Although the {{literature}} on human resource management (HRM) has provided compelling evidence that certain HRM practices can help employees attain the competence and confidence {{to carry out their}} role, less is known about the potential impact of HRM practices on volunteers in the context of non-profit organisations. This study addresses this gap by presenting a model that situates <b>role</b> <b>mastery</b> – operationalised as role clarity and self-efficacy – as its centrepiece. Our model suggests that <b>role</b> <b>mastery</b> leads to commitment to the volunteer organisation and that <b>role</b> <b>mastery</b> can be achieved through training and supportive relationships with paid staff. A dual-mediation analysis of survey data from a humanitarian non-profit organisation in the United Kingdom (n= 647) supported our theoretical model. We contribute to volunteering theory and practice by identifying tools that non-profit organisations can employ to maximise the <b>role</b> <b>mastery</b> and commitment of volunteers...|$|E
40|$|Adults bring attitudes {{with them}} into the {{learning}} situation that markedly affect their ability to learn or their motivation. Recent research indicates that those adults with strong feelings of power-lessness will fail to learn control-relevant information. Adults will be more motivated to listen to and to read content which may increase their competence in a current situation. If a strong need conflicts with information given, the information will not be learned. If sufficient rationalizations have been built to defend certain behavior, educational programs to change the behavior will be ineffective. As an adult assumes a new role, he goes through stages of vacillation between the old role and the new, overlearn-ing behavior appropriate to the new role and integration of the new role into other roles.

Furthermore, the students’ final exam math grades were used to assess their mathematics performance. Path analysis method was used for data analysis. The results showed the good fit of the model and revealed that motivating tasks as an independent variable, with the mediating <b>role</b> of <b>mastery</b> goals, perceived instrumentality and self-regulated learning had a meaningful indirect effect on mathematics performance.

In fact, the learning process contributes to the organism so that it can adapt the ever – changing environment. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms involving in the learning and factors affecting on it is among the issues which have attracted the attention of many psychologists and neurologists. Motivation is one of the most important factors affecting learning and can relate evolving identity to learning. Methods and Materials: The present study is a nonexperimental design (correlation) that by using a structural model investigated the relationship between variables. Multi –stage sampling was used for selecting 1072 participants among Sabzevar and Neyshabour second grade high schools girl students. Three questionnaires were used: identity style scale (ISI), goals achievement scale and motivational strategies for learning.

40|$|Job design {{scholars}} {{have shown that}} the strongest link between job characteristics and several attitudinal and behavioral outcomes is a person?s experienced meaningfulness at work. However, there has been very little research that has described how each unique job characteristic impacts meaningfulness, or considered the influence that a person?s dispositional characteristics have on this critical psychological state. Drawing upon job characteristics and the meaning of work literature streams and integrating it with the Theory of Purposeful Work Behavior, I propose that there are four fundamental ?meaning of work? goals that serve as the mediating mechanisms linking one?s job characteristics and personality traits with their eventual experienced meaningfulness at work. These goals can be separated into two broad types, those that are self-focused (i. e. developing <b>role</b> <b>mastery</b> and gaining clarity of accomplishments) and those that are others-focused (i. e. acquiring social impact and attaining power). I propose a differential pattern of relationships whereby the two self-focused goals are more strongly impacted by one?s task-focused job characteristics, while the others-focused goals are more strongly impacted by one?s social-focused job characteristics. In addition, I adopt a person-centered approach with respect to the dispositional characteristics by considering an individual?s profile across all Big Five personality traits. I propose that individuals can be described as being represented by one of three broad personality profile types, and that some personality profile types tend to experience a higher level of meaning of work goal fulfillment as compared to other types, apart from the influence of one?s job characteristics. Finally, I propose that when predicting the fulfillment of these four meaning of work goals, the relationship between job characteristics and personality trait profiles is compensatory in nature in that goal fulfillment is more strongly impacted by one?s dispositional characteristics for individuals with a more desirable personality profile. In contrast, goal fulfillment is more strongly impacted by the characteristics of one?s work environment for those with a less-desirable personality profile. I test my hypotheses with a sample of 184 individuals using multiple regression and latent profile analysis, and find overall support for these fundamental theoretical propositions...|$|E

In addition, there is even less evidence on the impact of underemployment on mental health. Using longitudinal data collected from a cohort of 20 - 24  years old, the present study examines a range of employed states and investigates the <b>role</b> of <b>mastery,</b> financial hardship and social support in the relationship between labour status and depression. METHOD: Responses were from the Personality and Total Health (PATH) Through Life Project: A representative, community-based survey conducted in Canberra and Queanbeyan (NSW) in Australia, where respondents (n= 2404) in their early twenties were followed for 8  years. Depression was measured using the self-report Goldberg Depression Scale, with the likely presence of depression being indicated by scores 7 or greater. RESULTS: The analyses identified unemployment and underemployment as significant predictors of depression, compared to their employed counterparts. Both unemployment and underemployment remained significantly correlated with depression even after accounting for sociodemographic, economic and psychological variables. Social support, financial hardship and a sense of personal control (mastery) all emerged as important mediators between unemployment and depression. CONCLUSIONS: Both unemployment and underemployment were associated with increased risk of depression. The strength of this relationship was attenuated but remained significant after accounting for key variables (mastery, financial hardship and social support), and extensive sociodemographic and health covariates, indicating that no or inade-quate employment contributes to poorer mental health over and above these factors.

We thought SE would partially mediate the effect of mastery and constraints on exercise and BI, with constraints showing a direct influence on PA. A random digit dialing survey of 1210 Albertans was conducted in Calgary, Edmonton and elsewhere. Participants were asked about control beliefs (mastery and constraints) and SE for coping with barriers to PA {{as well as their}} PA behavior and their BI to engage in PA.

In practice, determination of mastery is imperfect. Student knowledge must be inferred from performance, and performance does not always follow knowledge.

Tutors can make two types of errors when assessing student knowledge: (1) false positives, in which a student without knowledge is judged to have mastered a skill, and (2) false negatives, in which a student is presented with additional practice opportunities after acquiring knowledge.

30|$|The {{present study}} aims at delving into English as foreign {{language}} students’ demotivation, burnout, mastery goal orientation, {{and perceptions of}} classroom activities. This is accomplished by building a causal structural model through which the associations among the constructs are estimated. The Persian version of the 'de-motivation scale’ designed by Sakai and Kichuki (System 37 : 57 - 69, 2009) is used to assess demotivation. It measures six constructs: teachers, characteristics of classes, experiences of failure, class environment, class materials, and lack of interest. To gauge burnout, student version of ‘Maslach Burnout Inventory’ (Schaufeli et al., Psychology, 33 (5): 464 - 481, 2002) is employed. It measures three dimensions of burnout, namely, emotional exhaustion, cynicism, and academic inefficacy. The Persian version of the ‘Students Perceptions of Classroom Activities’ scale designed by Gentry and Gable (My class activities: A survey instrument to assess students’ perceptions of interest, challenge, choice, and enjoyment in their classrooms, 2001) is utilized in determining student perceptions of their classes. The scale assesses four perceptions: interest, challenge, choice, and joy. Students’ goal orientation {{is measured by the}} translated version of ‘Achievement Goal Orientation Inventory’ designed by Midgley et al. (Contemporary Educational Psychology, 23 (2): 113 - 31, 1998). The results display a good overall fit of the proposed model with the empirical data. In particular, demotivators positively and significantly predict student burnout and the two internal demotivators namely, ‘lack of interest’ and ‘experiences of failure’ negatively and significantly impact on student mastery goal orientation. The results also indicate that student burnout negatively and significantly predict student mastery goal orientation and positive perceptions of classroom activities. Student perceptions of interest and joy, on the other hand, positively and significantly play an important <b>role</b> in <b>mastery</b> goal orientation. Student perceptions and mastery goal orientation have positive effects on student achievement.|$|R
40|$|Thesis (M. Ed.) [...] University of Melbourne, 1995 One of the {{continuing}} needs {{for the education of}} gifted and talented children is the provision of effective role models who are their intellectual peers. Being gifted brings special conditions and demands special provisions for a differentiated education. This thesis documents the development, implementation and evaluation of an educational Program intended to cater for the needs of gifted and talented children. It uses the lives of eminent personalities to provide gifted children with role models in life for coping with the phenomenon of giftedness. It argues that such studies provide real-world <b>role</b> modelling, <b>mastery</b> of life-long skills and a strong motivation to achieve. The theoretical base selected is George T. Betts' autonomous learner model, where longer and deeper personal research is supported by athome, in-class and in-school provisions to encourage students to develop higher level communication skills and better self concepts about themselves as gifted persons. The Program, entitled the Night of the Notables, is a flexible educational Program, being both user and teacher friendly, one that can be used as enrichment or extension in selected groups or in general ability classrooms, over shorter or longer time spans, for both gifted and talented, and across several age groups. The thesis documents the progress of the study with lower secondary students at a suburban independent school, analyses data supporting hypotheses about increased cognitive and affective skills, and provides original materials developed to run the Program. Implications for preferring similar methodologies for teaching gifted and talented are developed and explored. It is argued that Night of the Notables is a suitable new model for Australian gifted education. It is adaptable as a stand alone Program or as an infused one. It is multi layered so it can meet the needs {{of a wide variety of}} ability levels.

To date, however, the national scope of global mental health education has not heretofore been systematically assessed. We therefore sought to characterize the distribution of global health training opportunities in U. S. graduate psychiatric education. Methods—We examined the web pages of all U. S. psychiatry residency training programs, along with search results from a systematic Google query designed to identify global health training opportunities. Results—Of the 183 accredited U. S. psychiatry residency programs, we identified 17 programs (9. 3 %) offering 28 global health training opportunities in 64 countries. Ten psychiatry residency programs offered their residents opportunities to participate in one or more elective-based rotations, eight offered research activities, and six offered extended field-based training. Most global health training opportunities occurred within the context of externally administered, institution-wide initiatives generally available to residents from a range of clinical specialties, rather than within internally administered departmental initiatives specifically tailored for psychiatry residents. Conclusions—There are relatively few global health training opportunities in U. S. graduate psychiatric education. These activities have a clear <b>role</b> in enhancing <b>mastery</b> of Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education core competencies, but important challenges related to program funding and evaluation remain...|$|R
40|$|The {{proposal}} is {{made that the}} interface between language and Theory of Mind is bidirectional. It seems probable that the conceptual developments of early Theory of Mind form an essential basis for helping to fix at least word reference. In development from 2 to 4 years, no basis exists in research for conclusions {{about the direction of}} influence between language and Theory of Mind. At the stage of false belief reasoning, after age 4, the <b>role</b> of the <b>mastery</b> of syntactic complementation is highlighted as a representational tool, that is, language development assists reasoning. The paper presents a brief summary of Theory of Mind, ranging from its earliest beginnings in infancy to the appreciation around age 4 years that others might hold false beliefs and act according to them. For each development, the parallel language developments are described, and questions are raised about the interface between the two. In particular, research that might determine the direction of influence {{from one to the other}} is discussed. More work is called for, especially with nonverbal tasks, good experimental linguistic work and other special populations, that might allow a more precise delineation of how language and Theory of Mind interrelate at the interface...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} determinants and correlates {{of psychological distress}} focusing on the roles of psychosocial resources, such as sense of mastery and social support in mediating and/or moderating the effects of life stressors, such as unfavourable socioeconomic conditions (SES), poor physical health and chronic daily stress on individuals' level of distress. Additionally, the above examination was conducted {{for men and women}} separately and the results were compared. The study was based on secondary analyses of data collected by Statistics Canada in two cycles of the National Population Health Survey: 2002 / 2003 and 2004 / 2005. The sample used included 2535 men and 3200 {{women between the ages of}} 25 and 64 years. Further, this research used structural equation techniques to examine pathways among life stressors, psychosocial resources and distress and block regression analysis to examine the moderating <b>roles</b> of <b>mastery</b> and social support. Chronic daily stress was measured in 2004 / 2005 and two years earlier, in 2002 / 2003. Main findings included: (1) higher levels of mastery and social support were found to be associated with less depressive symptoms for both men and women, (2) in addition to its significant main effect on distress, mastery moderated the detrimental effects of poor physical health and chronic daily stress on depressive symptoms for both genders, (3) the effects of daily stress, poor physical health and unfavourable SES on level of distress were partially mediated through mastery, (4) next to daily stress, poor physical health had the most impact on level of distress for both genders, albeit a stronger impact for women, (5) mastery played a more important role in the distress process of women compared with men, and (6) while perceived social support decreased the likelihood of distress for men directly, it decreased women's likelihood of distress by increasing their mastery. Symptoms of distress indicate present and/or future need for health care services. Thus, prevention of distress may lead to a reduction in health care costs in addition to the reduction of subjective suffering. Findings emphasize the importance of allocating resources to groups at high risk of developing distress, such as the poor and the physically unhealthy.
