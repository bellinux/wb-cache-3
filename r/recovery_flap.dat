40|$|This report {{presents}} the results of an investigation of the aerodynamic characteristics of the NACA symmetrical laminar flow 65, 1 - 012 airfoil. The model was tested with and without a dive <b>recovery</b> <b>flap.</b> The effects obtained by suddenly extending the flap are compared to those obtained with the flap set down in position. The tests cover a range of angle of attack from zero to plus three degrees while the Mach number was varied from 0. 5 to 0. 8. The following conclusions were reached: 1. The lift curve for the airfoil with no flap is essentially a straight line. 2. A flap suddenly extended produces aerodynamic effects which are different from those produced by a flap which is set. Whenever model test results are to be used to produce design information to be incorporated in full scale aircraft, the dive recovery flaps on the model should be equivalent to those on the full scale airplane in regard to dimensional proportions and to the method and timing of operation, if a high degree of accuracy is desired. This investigation was carried out by the authors at the Guggenheim Aeronautical Laboratory of the California Institute of Technology during the school year 1945 - 46. ...|$|E

Improvements added in this series included engine refinements {{and the addition of}} dive <b>recovery</b> <b>flaps.</b> Cutting down the rear fuselage to accommodate the bubble canopy produced yaw instability, and the P-47D-40 introduced a vertical stabilizer extension {{in the form of a}} fin running from the vertical stabilizer to just behind the radio aerial. The fin fillet was often retrofitted in the field to earlier P-47D bubble-top variants. The P-47D-40 also featured provisions for 10 [...] "zero length" [...] launchers for 5in (127mm) High velocity aircraft rockets (HVARs), as well as the new K-14 computing gunsight. This was a license-built copy of the British Ferranti GGS Mark IID computing gyroscopic sight which allowed the pilot to dial in target wingspan and range, and would then move the gunsight reticle to compensate for the required deflection.|$|R

2500|$|The final 210 J models, {{designated}} P-38J-25-LO, alleviated the compressibility problem {{through the}} addition of a set of electrically actuated dive <b>recovery</b> <b>flaps</b> just outboard of the engines on the bottom centerline of the wings. With these improvements, a USAAF pilot reported a dive speed of almost , although the indicated air speed was later corrected for compressibility error, and the actual dive speed was lower. Lockheed manufactured over 200 retrofit modification kits to be installed on P-38J-10-LO and J-20-LO already in Europe, but the USAAF C-54 carrying them was shot down by an RAF pilot who mistook the Douglas transport for a German Focke-Wulf Condor. Unfortunately, the loss of the kits came during Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier's four-month morale-boosting tour of P-38 bases. Flying a new Lightning named [...] "Snafuperman", modified to full P-38J-25-LO specifications at Lockheed's modification center near Belfast, LeVier captured the pilots' full attention by routinely performing maneuvers during March 1944 that common Eighth Air Force wisdom held to be suicidal. It proved too little, too late, because the decision had already been made to re-equip with Mustangs.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Mandibular {{reconstruction}} {{by means}} of fibula transplants is the standard therapy for severe bone loss after subtotal mandibulectomy. Venous failure still represents the most common complication in free flap surgery. We present the injection of heparine into the arterial pedicle as modification of the revising both anastomoses in these cases and illustrate the application with a clinical case example. Methods Methods consist of immediate revision surgery with clot removal, heparin perfusion by direct injection in the arterial vessel of the pedicle, subsequent high dose low-molecular weight heparin therapy, and leeches. After 6 hours postoperatively, images of early <b>flap</b> <b>recovery</b> show first sings of recovery by fading livid skin color. Results The application of this technique in a patient with venous thrombosis resulted in the complete <b>recovery</b> of the <b>flap</b> 60 hours postoperatively. Other cases achieved similar success without additional lysis Therapy or revision of the arterial anastomosis. Conclusion Rescue of fibular flaps is possible even in patients with massive thrombosis if surgical revision is done quickly. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background: Sensory <b>recovery</b> of skin <b>flaps</b> is {{generally}} poor {{unless they are}} elevated as an innervated flap. The {{aim of this study}} was to elucidate if Schwann cell (SC) -like cells differentiated from adipose-derived stem cells (ASCs) could improve the cutaneous nerve regeneration in skin flaps. Methods: Microvascular island groin flaps were elevated bilaterally in 32 Lewis rats. On the right flap, the epigastric nerve was resected and ligated (noninnervated flap), and on the left flap, the nerve was crushed (innervated flap). ASCs, SC-like cells differentiated from ASCs (dASCs), SCs, or vehicle were simultaneously injected to the dermal and hypodermal layers of flap. After 20 weeks, the reinnervation pattern of flap was assessed immunohistochemically using a neuronal marker, PGP 9. 5. Results: dASC cultures produced significantly higher amount of nerve growth factor and brain-derived neurotrophic factor compared with ASC cultures (P 0. 05). In the center of flap, there was no statistically significant increase in reinnervation density in all groups irrespective of flap innervation (P > 0. 05). Conclusions: dASCs could improve flap reinnervation by 2 mechanisms: First, neurotrophic factors produced by dASCs facilitated regrowth of cutaneous axons from the surroundings of flap. Second, nerve growth factor released by dASCs induced the collateral sprouting of undamaged axons in adjacent tissues. In addition to the use of innervated flaps, dASC transplantation therapy could be a new approach to improve the sensory <b>recovery</b> of skin <b>flaps...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Background. Total or near-total glossectomy de-fects are {{commonly}} reconstructed with rectus abdominis myocutaneous flaps for coverage. Sensory reinnervation {{has rarely been}} performed. Methods. Thirteen consecutive total or near-total glossec-tomy reconstructions were performed in a 12 -month period with anterolateral thigh flaps with (n = 8) or without (n = 5) sensory reinnervation to the lingual nerve. Two-point discrimination, Semmes-Weinstein monofilament testing, pain, and temperature testing were performed before and after 12 months of surgery. Speech and swallow functions were assessed with an estab-lished grading system. Results. Innervated flaps had superior sensory <b>recovery</b> to noninnervated <b>flaps</b> in all testing modalities. Postoperative radiotherapy may delay sensory recovery. Swallow function was better in the innervated group. Return of sensation also improves overall patient satisfaction. Conclusions. The reinnervated anterolateral thigh flap is a viable option to reconstruct total or near-total glossectomy defects with good speech and swallow functions. A 2004 Wile...|$|R
5000|$|The fastest World War II {{fighters were}} the first {{aircraft}} to experience Mach tuck. Their wings were not designed to counter Mach tuck because research on supersonic airfoils was just beginning; areas of supersonic flow, together with shock waves and flow separation, were present on the wing. This condition was known {{at the time as}} compressibility burble and was known to exist on propeller tips at high aircraft speeds. The P-38 was the first 400 mph fighter, and it suffered more than the usual teething troubles. It had a thick, high-lift wing, distinctive twin booms and a single, central nacelle containing the cockpit and armament. It quickly accelerated to terminal velocity in a dive. The short stubby fuselage had a detrimental effect in reducing the critical Mach number of the 15% thick wing center section with high velocities over the canopy adding to those on the upper surface of the wing. Mach tuck occurred at speeds above Mach 0.65; the air flow over the wing center section became transonic, causing a loss of lift. The resultant change in downwash at the tail caused a nose-down pitching moment and the dive to steepen (Mach tuck). The aircraft was very stable in this condition making recovery from the dive very difficult. Dive <b>recovery</b> (auxiliary) <b>flaps</b> were added to the underside of the wing (P-38J-LO) to increase the wing lift and downwash at the tail to allow recovery from transonic dives.|$|R

To avoid route <b>flapping,</b> <b>recovery</b> mechanisms may be dampened, making adaptation slow. Unstructured overlays {{have been widely used}} to mitigate the issues of path and performance failures in the Internet by routing through alternate paths via overlay peers.

In this paper, we analyze a topologically-aware architecture to estimate end-to-end path availability for service on Internet. We propose Destination-Guided Detouring via Resilient Overlay Network (DG-RON); a distributed coordinate based overlay architecture, which uses landmark based heuristics for scalable end-to-end path discovery. Simulations show that DG-RON can predict alternate paths with a high success rate. I...|$|R

Assess {{the efficacy of}} free flap reconstruction per-formed at a low-volume program and evaluate how volume and outcomes have changed over 20 years. Study Design. Case series with chart review. Setting. Tertiary academic medical center. Subjects and Methods. A retrospective chart review was per-formed at a tertiary care academic program on all free tissue flaps from the primary reconstructive surgeon over 20 years (1993 - 2013). In total, 136 procedures were obtained from operative notes, billing codes, and chart data-bases. Outcome variables included procedure success and complications. Patients stayed in general intensive care unit and hospital floor units. Results. Flap success was 92. 6 % of all cases. In the past 13 years, 70 flaps were performed with 3 failures (96 % suc-cess rate). Take-back rate was 16 % of total cases with a <b>flap</b> <b>recovery</b> rate of 60 %. Postoperative failure occurred after 72 hours in 60 % of cases. Nearly 60 % of patients experienced a complication of any type or severity. Twenty percent had a flap complication while maintaining viability, with half of these being partial dehiscence. Systemic complications affected 20 % of all cases. The average hospital stay for noncomplicated patients was 13 days. There was 1 postoperative mortality. Fibula and radial forearm were the most common flaps at 44 % and 26 %, respectively. Conclusion. Free flap reconstruction {{of the head and}} neck can be performed by appropriately skilled surgeons with acceptable outcomes in low-volume settings.

40|$|The deep {{inferior}} epigastric perforator (DIEP) flap {{is considered}} the definitive standard for autologous breast reconstruction because {{of its ability to}} restore shape, its consistency, and its static and dynamic symmetry, but the degree of spontaneous sensory recovery is still widely discussed. To clarify the real need for sensitive nerve coaptation, return of sensibility in DIEP flaps was investigated using a pressure-specifying sensory device. METHODS: Thirty consecutive patients with breast cancer scheduled for modified radical mastectomy, axillary node dissection, and immediate reconstruction with cutaneous-adipose DIEP flaps without nerve repair were enrolled in the study. Sensibility for one and two points, static and moving, was tested preoperatively on the breasts and abdomen, and postoperatively at 6 and 12 months on the DIEP flaps. A t test was used for comparison of paired data and to investigate which factors affected sensory recovery. RESULTS: Preoperative healthy breast and abdomen pressure thresholds were lower for two-point than one-point discrimination and for moving discriminations compared with static ones at 6 and 12 months. Although they were significantly higher than those for contralateral healthy breasts (p < 0. 05), pressure thresholds in DIEP flaps at 12 months were lower than at 6 months, showing a significant progressive sensory recovery (p < 0. 05). At 12 months postoperatively, the best sensibility recovery was found at the inferior lateral quadrant, the worst at the superior medial quadrant. Age and flap weight were factors related to the performance of sensory <b>recovery.</b> CONCLUSIONS: DIEP <b>flap</b> transfer for immediate breast reconstruction undergoes satisfactory progressive spontaneous sensitive recovery at 6 and 12 months after surgery, and operative time spent dissecting sensitive perforator branches and their coaptation in recipient site could be spared...|$|R
40|$|ObjectiveThe perineal {{pressure}} ulcer is, from the outset, a serious bedsore as it exposes {{the patient to}} the risk of fistula in addition to the regular complications associated with bedsores. Treatments reported in the literature couple <b>recovery</b> by musculocutaneous <b>flap</b> combined either with urethroplasty or urinary diversion [1], without decision-making criteria. The objective {{of this study is to}} analyze the management of perineal {{pressure ulcer}}s in SCI patients and suggest a suitable therapeutic strategy. Materials and methodsRetrospective, observational study of a group of SCI patients picked up at the Garches hospital and in the urology department at the Pitié-Salpêtrière, between 2002 and 2014. ResultsThe study includes 20 patients, of which 15 show urethrocutaneous fistula. Following a musculocutaneous flap combined or not with an urethroplasty, but without joint urological care, no patient recovered. None of the two urethral reconstructions have helped to heal the bedsores or enabled the reuse of urethra for self-catheterization. After cystoprostatectomy and Bricker, only 2 out of 15 patients relapsed, given a follow-up period between 1 and 6 years. DiscussionLike any pressure ulcer, the treatment of perineal pressure ulcer requires a careful evaluation of the circumstances of occurrence and risk factors (history of ischiectomy, proximal hip removal, prolonged indwelling catheter), and a neuroperineal (bladder balance and voiding mode), skin, nutrition, neuro-orthopedic, seat, and socio-psychological assessment. In the presence of urethrocutaneous fistula, a urinary diversion seems absolutely necessary: usually a non-continent bypass with cystoprostatectomy and Bricker which remains surgically heavy and may negatively affects self-image exceptionally, a continent diversion may be considered with closure of the bladder neck. The urethroplasty by experienced urologists associated with bedsores surgery could have been discussed but was not be performed for technical reasons (surgeries on 2 different hospitals). In the absence of fistula, but the presence of chronic perineal maceration with bad management of bladder, trans-ileal cutaneous ureterostomy with cystoprostatectomy ensures the complete drying of the perineum...|$|R
