5|$|In response, ETOUSA {{initiated}} Operation Peppermint. Special {{equipment was}} prepared. Eleven survey meters and a Geiger counter were shipped to England in early 1944, along with 1,500 film packets, which {{were used to}} measure radiation exposure. Another 25 survey meters, 5 Geiger counters and 1,500 film packets were held in storage in the United States, but in <b>readiness</b> to be shipped by air with the highest priority. Chemical Warfare Service teams were trained in its use, and Signal Corps personnel in its maintenance. The equipment was held in <b>readiness,</b> but the preparations were not needed, because the Germans had not developed such weapons.|$|E

5|$|The 174th Infantry Brigade is an {{infantry}} brigade of the United States Army {{based at}} Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst, New Jersey. A multi-component training unit, the brigade provides operational training <b>readiness</b> for {{units in the}} continental Northeast.|$|E
5|$|The Army is {{organised}} into three main elements which {{report to the}} Chief of Army; the Headquarters of the 1st Division, Special Operations Command and Forces Command. Headquarters 1st Division is responsible for high-level training activities and is capable of being deployed to command large scale ground operations. It {{does not have any}} combat units permanently assigned to it, though it commands units during training activities and the Land Combat <b>Readiness</b> Centre reports to the divisional headquarters. Most of the Army's units report to Forces Command, which is responsible for overseeing their <b>readiness</b> and preparing them for operations. This organisation came into effect during January 2011; before this time the Army's three regular brigades were permanently assigned to the Headquarters 1st Division.|$|E
5|$|The Syrian Army {{was meant}} to consist of two brigade-sized units, {{but there was no}} time to prepare them, thus only the 1st Brigade was in a state of <b>readiness</b> by May 15. It had about 2,000 {{soldiers}} in two infantry battalions, one armored battalion, and 4–6 artillery batteries.|$|E
5|$|The {{division}} headquarters {{also provided}} training assistance {{in preparation for}} small-scale National Guard operations, Joint <b>Readiness</b> Training Center rotations, leadership training for National Guard commanders, and annual summer training for the three brigades. As {{a part of this}} commitment, the 7th Infantry Division headquarters would deploy a command element to serve as higher headquarters for large-scale training and field exercises, evaluating and coordinating the units as they trained. It would also conduct quarterly status checks with the three brigades to discuss <b>readiness</b> and resource issues affecting those units, ensuring that they were at peak performance should they be needed.|$|E
5|$|The public Wright State University {{became a}} state {{university}} in 1967. Wright State University established the National Center for Medical <b>Readiness,</b> a national training program for disaster preparedness and relief. Wright State's Boonshoft School of Medicine is the Dayton area's only medical school and {{is a leader in}} biomedical research.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} of the French Atlantic fleet was {{a major cause of}} concern to the British Admiralty, and in late 1792 orders were issued for the small British brig, the 14-gun HMS Childers under Commander Robert Barlow, to enter the Roadstead of Brest and investigate the state of <b>readiness</b> of the French fleet.|$|E

5|$|A complex {{junction}} {{has been}} built north of St Pancras with connections to the East Coast Main Line, North London Line (for West Coast Main Line) and Midland Main Line, allowing {{for a wide variety}} of potential destinations albeit on conventional rails. As part of the works, tunnels connecting the East Coast Main Line to the Thameslink route were also built in <b>readiness</b> for the forthcoming Thameslink Programme.|$|E
5|$|After Nabi {{formed as}} a {{tropical}} depression on August29, the local National Weather Service office on Guam issued a tropical storm watch for the islands Tinian, Rota, Sapian, and Agrihan. On August30, the watch was upgraded to a tropical storm warning for Rota and Agrihan, while a typhoon warning was issued for Tinian and Saipan. On all four islands, a Condition of <b>Readiness</b> 1 was declared. The government of the Northern Mariana Islands advised Tinian and Saipan residents along the coast and in poorly-built buildings to evacuate, and several schools operated as shelters. About 700people evacuated on Saipan, and the airport was closed, stranding about 1,000travelers. As a precaution, schools were closed on Guam on August31, after a tropical storm warning was issued for the island the night prior. The island's governor, Felix Perez Camacho, also declared a condition of <b>readiness</b> 2, {{as well as a}} state of emergency. Due to the typhoon, several flights were canceled or delayed at Antonio B. Won Pat International Airport on Guam.|$|E
5|$|All eight {{aircraft}} were complete by 1 November and {{had been}} tested to ensure their <b>readiness</b> {{to participate in the}} parade. They were later given the unofficial service designation of La-13. It was considered too risky to fly the aircraft from Gorky to Moscow and their wings could not be dismounted which meant that they could not be railed to Moscow either. Special three-wheeled trailers were built and the aircraft were driven to Moscow, but the flypast was cancelled because of bad weather.|$|E
5|$|As First Sea Lord, Battenberg was {{responsible}} to the First Lord for the <b>readiness</b> {{of the fleet}} and the preparation of naval strategy, {{as well as the}} development of a scheme for state insurance of merchant vessels in times of war, which was to prove essential in preventing prohibitive insurance rates that would have stifled British trade.|$|E
5|$|At {{the outset}} of the Second World War, due to the {{provisions}} of the Defence Act (1903) which prohibited sending the Militia to fight outside of Australian territory, The decision was made to raise an all volunteer force to serve overseas—initial operations were conceived to be likely in the Middle East, France and later possibly England—while it was decided that the Militia would be used to defend the Australian mainland and to improve Australia's overall level of <b>readiness</b> through the reinstitution of compulsory military service and extended periods of continuous periods of training. During this time the 6th Battalion was called up for a number of periods of continuous service in order to bolster their <b>readiness</b> and undertook garrison duties in Australia. In 1944, however, {{the decision was made to}} disband the unit, as the Australian government sought to reallocate resources to the economy and began the demobilisation process early. Later, in January 1945, the battalion's parent unit, the 2nd Brigade was also disbanded.|$|E
5|$|Between September 1988 and January 1989, sailors aboard Iowa {{reportedly}} conducted little {{training with}} her main guns, {{in part because}} of ongoing, serious maintenance issues with the main gun turrets. According to Ensign Dan Meyer, the officer in charge of the ship's Turret One, morale and operational <b>readiness</b> among the gun-turret crews suffered greatly.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{significant}} {{delays in the}} DDR and integration process, of the eighteen brigades, only seventeen have been declared operational, over {{two and a half}} years after the initial target date. Responding to the situation, the Congolese Minister of Defence presented a new defence reform master plan to the international community in February 2008. Essentially the three force tiers all had their <b>readiness</b> dates pushed back: the first, territorial forces, to 2008-2012, the mobile force to 2008-10, and the main defence force to 2015.|$|E
