25|$|On 18 June 2012 {{it became}} known that from 17 to 19 March 2011 in the days {{directly}} after the explosions, American military aircraft gathered <b>radiation</b> <b>data</b> in an area with a radius of 45kilometers around the plant for the U.S. Department of Energy. The maps revealed radiation levels of more than 125 microsieverts per hour at 25kilometers northwest of the plant, which means that people in these areas {{were exposed to the}} annual permissible dose within eight hours. The maps were neither made public nor used for evacuation of residents.|$|E
2500|$|Greenpeace sent {{radiology}} {{experts to}} {{the villages of}} Iitate and Tsushima in the Fukushima Prefecture. [...] They found levels up to 100μSv/h {{in the village of}} Iitate, and based on that, recommended that the government widen the 20km no-go zone, which Iitate lies outside of, to at least 30km. [...] An official of the NSA said that high radioactivity levels detected by the NGO could not be considered reliable, although some members of Greenpeace stressed that their numbers corresponded in other areas. [...] The New York Times called the reporting by Greenpeace (with a well-known anti-nuclear position) a [...] "guarded endorsement to the <b>radiation</b> <b>data</b> published by the Japanese government", due to the general correspondence between the numbers. [...] Members of Greenpeace stressed that there has been distrust of the official data, and that their contention was not the radiation levels, but the action that was taken.|$|E
2500|$|The Associated Press {{reports that}} two PackBot ground robots from iRobot have entered unit 1 and unit 3 of the {{crippled}} Fukushima {{nuclear power plant}} and performed temperature, pressure, and radioactivity measurements. The remote-controlled robots entered the two reactors over the preceding weekend. The devices opened closed doors and explored the insides of the reactor buildings, coming back with radioactivity readings of up to 49mSv/h inside unit 1 and up to 57mSv/h inside unit 3. TEPCO officials say that the <b>radiation</b> <b>data</b> from the robots do not change their plans for shutting down the plant {{by the end of}} this year. Though more robots will be used, a TEPCO official, Takeshi Makigami, says that robots are limited in what they can do, and eventually [...] "people must enter the buildings". Robots also entered unit 2, but the probe was hindered by fogging of the robot's camera lens from the high humidity, over 90%, inside the building.|$|E

The method is tested using both real and simulated <b>radiation</b> monitoring <b>data.</b> For simulated data, the method is shown to retrieve the embedded parameters employed in generating the data and to reconstruct the plume model parameters, including the source term.

This time, the booster {{performed}} almost perfectly so that Pioneer 4 achieved its primary objective (an Earth-Moon trajectory), returned <b>radiation</b> <b>data</b> and provided a valuable tracking exercise. A slightly longer than nominal second stage burn however was enough to induce small trajectory and velocity errors, so that the probe passed within 60,000 km of the Moon's surface (7.2° E, 5.7° S) on 4 March 1959 at 22:25 UT (5:25 p.m. EST) at a speed of 7,230 km/h and was not able to impact as planned. The distance was also not close enough to trigger the photoelectric sensor. The probe continued transmitting <b>radiation</b> <b>data</b> for 82.5 hours, to a distance of 409,000 miles (658,000 km), and reached perihelion on 18 March 1959 at 01:00 UT.
