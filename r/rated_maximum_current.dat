40|$|Under voltage sags, {{grid-tied}} photovoltaic inverters {{should remain}} {{connected to the}} grid according to low-voltage ride-through requirements. During such perturbations, {{it is interesting to}} exploit completely the distributed power provisions to contribute to the stability and reliability of the grid. In this sense, this paper proposes a low-voltage ride-through control strategy that maximizes the inverter power capability by injecting the maximum-rated current during the sag. To achieve this objective, two possible active power situations have been considered, i. e., high- and low-power production scenarios. In the first case, if the source is unable to deliver the whole generated power to the grid, the controller applies active power curtailment to guarantee that the <b>maximum</b> <b>rated</b> <b>current</b> is not surpassed. In the second case, the <b>maximum</b> allowed <b>current</b> is not reached, thus, the control strategy determined the amount of reactive power that can be injected up to reach it. The control objective can be fulfilled by means of a flexible current injection strategy that combines a proper balance between positive- and negative-current sequences, which limits the inverter output <b>current</b> to the <b>maximum</b> <b>rated</b> value and avoid active power oscillations. Selected experimental and simulation results are reported in order to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy. Peer ReviewedPostprint (author's final draft...|$|R

5000|$|Shunts are <b>rated</b> by <b>maximum</b> <b>current</b> and {{voltage drop}} at that current. For example, a 500 A, 75 mV shunt {{would have a}} {{resistance}} of 0.15 milliohms, a <b>maximum</b> allowable <b>current</b> of 500 amps and at that current the voltage drop would be 75 millivolts. By convention, most shunts are designed to drop 50 mV, 75 mV or 100 mV when operating at their full rated current and most ammeters consist of a shunt and a voltmeter with full-scale deflections of 50, 75, or 100 mV. All shunts have a derating factor for continuous use, 66% being the most common. Continuous use is a run time of 2+ minutes, {{at which point the}} derating factor must be applied. There are thermal limits where a shunt will no longer operate correctly. At 80 °C thermal drift begins to occur, at 120 °C thermal drift is a significant problem where error, depending on the design of the shunt, can be several percent and at 140 °C the manganin alloy becomes permanently damaged due to annealing resulting in the resistance value drifting up or down. [...] If the current being measured is also at a high voltage potential this voltage will be present in the connecting leads too and in the reading instrument itself. Sometimes, the shunt is inserted in the return leg (grounded side) to avoid this problem. Some alternatives to shunts can provide isolation from the high voltage by not directly connecting the meter to the high voltage circuit. Examples of devices that can provide this isolation are Hall effect current sensors and current transformers (see clamp meters). Current shunts are considered more accurate and cheaper than Hall effect devices. Common accuracy of such devices are ±0.1% & 0.25% and 0.5%.|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} {{is a result}} of the trend to improve the electric network performances through a better monitoring/knowledge of its state, coupled with active controls. This work aims to develop a dynamic rating system able to assess the real current carrying capacity of the power system components in real time [1]. In the electric network the power transmitted depends on voltage and current. In particular the maximum value for the current that can be processed by each component (conductors, transformers) is strictly dependent on the maximum allowable temperature. The components temperature in turn, depends not only on the current, but also on the external conditions (air temperature, wind speed and direction, soil temperature, soil thermal resistivity, etc). A correct modelling of the components thermal behaviour coupled with a method to assess in real time a correct value for the external parameters is the core of the research. 2. Why?
