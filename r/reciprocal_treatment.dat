40|$|I {{examined}} {{the ability of}} the southern monarch butterfly (Danaus erippus) to associate colours with rewards, the consistency of individual learning abilities, and the potential trade-off between foraging speed and accuracy. To assess associative colour learning and individual learning abilities, I offered individual butterflies artificial flowers of two similarly preferred colours, orange and yellow. One colour of flower was rewarding (aqueous sucrose) and the other was non-rewarding (water); two groups of butterflies received <b>reciprocal</b> <b>treatments.</b> A second phase was employed to assess whether learning scores remained similar within individuals when aqueous sodium chloride (NaCl) was offered instead of water. In both phases, butterflies associated rewards with specific colours, regardless of the colour. No individual consistency in learning skills was detected. To examine whether southern monarchs trade off foraging speed with accuracy, butterflies were offered a flower array of three colours: one rewarding (orange) and two distractors (yellow and red). A second phase was employed to detect whether increasing the penalty of choosing an unrewarding colour by offering aqueous quinine hemisulphate instead of water increased attention levels. In both phases, butterflies chose rewarding flowers more often than unrewarding flowers. Butterflies that made correct choices varied greatly in their response times; the few individuals that made incorrect choices displayed exploratory flights of short duration, from 1 to 4 sec. Individuals that rapidly selected incorrect flowers in phase one were different from those that made incorrect choices in phase two. Butterflies vary in their cognitive abilities but do not show individual constancy in their learning skills or the speed at which they choose flowers. This study provides additional evidence that large-sized and long-lived butterfly species have good learning abilities. A pattern consistent with a speed-accuracy trade-off occurs when southern monarchs choose incorrect, unrewarding flowers...|$|R

In grass carp, local interactions of GH and luteinizing hormone (LH) can induce GH release and gene expression at pituitary level via autocrine/paracrine mechanisms. To {{shed light on the}} role of activin/follistatin system in GH regulation by local actions of GH and LH, grass carp activin βA and βB were cloned, shown to be single-copy genes expressed in the pituitary, and confirmed to encode activin proteins capable of transactivating promoter with activin-responsive elements. In grass carp pituitary cells, activin A and B were effective in reducing GH secretion and GH cell content with concurrent drop in GH mRNA level whereas the opposite was true for follistatin, the activin-binding protein known to neutralize the effects of endogenous activin. Treatment with activin A and B not only could suppress basal but also inhibit GH mRNA expression induced by GH and human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG), a functional analogue of LH in fish model. Apparently, down-regulation of GH mRNA by activin was mediated by reducing GH transcript stability with concurrent inhibition on GH promoter activity via the SMAD pathway. In <b>reciprocal</b> experiments, GH <b>treatment</b> was found to up-regulate activin βA, activin βB and follistatin mRNA levels in carp pituitary cells but the opposite was noted by removing endogenous GH with GH antiserum. Interestingly, parallel treatment with hCG could also inhibit basal as well as GH-induced activin βA, activin βB and follistatin gene expression.
