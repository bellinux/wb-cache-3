5|$|Aetosaurs were herbivores, likely {{feeding on}} ferns and seed ferns that were {{common in the}} Triassic. The upturned shape of their snout {{suggests}} that aetosaurs may have dug up roots and tubers. Aetosaurs have several anatomical features {{that may have been}} adaptations to digging, including a short radius relative to the humerus (seen in many other digging tetrapods) and a large deltopectoral crest on the humerus that served as an attachment for muscles. Aetosaurs also have large hind feet, or pes, with large claws that were likely used for skratch-digging. One aetosaur, Typothorax, has an entepicondyle on the humerus, which is the origin of forearm pronator and manual flexor muscles often used in digging. Moreover, it has a large olecranon process on the ulna which projects backward past the elbow, giving a large area for the insertion of the triceps muscle. While many studies have suggested that aetosaurs had a fossorial or burrowing lifestyle, aetosaurs have few of the characteristics that fossorial animals have as adaptations to digging. Therefore, it is likely that aetosaurs were able to dig to some extent, possibly <b>rooting</b> <b>for</b> food, but were unable to burrow.|$|E
5|$|On that day, Sihanouk was in Moscow meeting Soviet foreign {{minister}} Alexei Kosygin, {{who broke the}} news to him. From Moscow, Sihanouk flew to Beijing, where he was received by Zhou. Zhou arranged for the North Vietnamese Prime Minister, Pham Van Dong to fly to Beijing from Hanoi and meet with Sihanouk. Both Zhou and Dong encouraged Sihanouk to rebel against Lon Nol and promised him military and financial support. On 23March 1970, Sihanouk announced the formation of his resistance movement, the National United Front of Kampuchea (FUNK). He encouraged the Cambodian populace to join him and fight against Lon Nol's government. Khmer Rouge soldiers broadcast Sihanouk's message in the Cambodian countryside, which roused demonstrations <b>rooting</b> <b>for</b> his cause that were brutally suppressed by Lon Nol's troops. Sometime later, on 5May 1970, Sihanouk announced {{the formation of a}} government-in-exile known as the Royal Government of the National Union of Kampuchea (GRUNK), leading Communist countries including China, North Vietnam, and North Korea to break relations with the Lon Nol regime. In Phnom Penh, a military trial convened on 2July 1970, whereby Sihanouk was charged with treason and corruption in his capacity as Head of State. After a three-day trial, the judges ruled Sihanouk guilty of both charges and sentenced to him death in absentia on 5July 1970.|$|E

25|$|Gorgal, {{who grew}} up <b>rooting</b> <b>for</b> the Bears, had six interceptions in 1955, when the team {{finished}} second in the NFL West division. He came into conflict with Bears coach and owner George Halas over his role as a leader on the team, however, and he was released on waivers halfway through the 1956 season. The rival Green Bay Packers claimed him, and he played the final five games of the season there. Gorgal considered Green Bay a lower-tier team and remained frustrated with his acrimonious departure from Chicago, and decided to quit football rather than play another year with the Packers.|$|E

Since Drumm {{was one of}} the few prosperous, educated Irishmen in the vicinity, Charlie's parents hoped he could find Charlie a job. In 1945, they invited Drumm to their home to introduce him to 17-year-old Charlie. The introduction went disastrously, as Da made a series of foolish, embarrassing statements (Da believed that a German victory in World War II was imminent, and he was plainly <b>rooting</b> <b>for</b> this outcome). Charlie was humiliated, and was astonished to learn that, despite everything, Drumm had actually taken a liking to him.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} days of gaming, the idea of love and romance was used {{as little more than a}} plot point to urge the hero to {{complete}} the set of tasks put before him.

Link and Princess Zelda from The Legend of Zelda series made gamers wonder why the two were not romantically together while <b>rooting</b> <b>for</b> the couple.

Although George idolized Lakers star Kobe Bryant, he grew up <b>rooting</b> <b>for</b> the Los Angeles Clippers. George spent most of his free time playing basketball at the park or one-on-one against his older sister Teiosha. He did not play organized basketball until his freshman year at Knight High School. He played for the varsity basketball team his last three years of high school under head coach Tom Hegre. George played for Pump and Run of the Amateur Athletic Union (AAU) with future UCLA Bruins Jrue Holiday and Malcolm Lee.|$|E
25|$|Because {{the teams}} were from New York City and Boston, which are {{approximately}} {{three and a}} half hours apart by car, the Super Bowl echoed the fierce rivalry between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox in Major League Baseball, games of which are often televised by Fox. Both teams' fans wore Yankees and Red Sox hats and showed off Fenway Park and Mickey Mantle T-shirts. Patriots fans said that they had no natural hatred for the Giants. Many old-time New Englanders, in fact, grew up <b>rooting</b> <b>for</b> the Giants before Boston got its AFL franchise in 1960, and are more accustomed to rooting against the Jets. Giants fans, however, discussed their great hatred for the Dallas Cowboys and the Philadelphia Eagles. Many Giants fans also wore hats and shirts of the New York Mets and the New York Rangers as part of discussing their hatred for the Eagles.|$|E
25|$|Returning to {{his native}} Germany, Schmeling won three of his next four fights, with one draw, {{including}} knockout wins over first Walter Neusel, then another redeeming his previous loss to Steve Hamas. However, many among the American press and fans remained unmoved {{on the idea of}} <b>rooting</b> <b>for</b> Schmeling in light of the Nazi Party's behavior. Articles continued to be published declaring the German 'washed up,' a 'has been,' or a 'Nazi puppet.' When he was matched with undefeated black sensation Joe Louis in 1936 for the German's first fight on American soil in more than two years, he was clearly the betting underdog, considered a name opponent for Louis to roll over on his route to the title. Nevertheless, he was number two contender for the title behind Louis. Prior to the match, Schmeling carefully studied films of Louis's prior fights, dissecting apparent flaws in the Detroit fighter's technique. Among the weaknesses he noticed was the fact that Louis lowered his left hand after throwing a left jab. In the ring, Schmeling exploited this subtle flaw to his own advantage, countering nearly every Louis jab with his best punch, the right cross. The fight proved to be a competitive, hard-hitting affair for the first three rounds, but, in the fourth, a counter right from the German dropped Louis {{for the first time in}} his career. Though Louis rose, he was badly dazed for the remainder of the fight. For a further eight rounds, Schmeling battered Louis, often standing toe-to-toe with the vaunted puncher and landing that same right hand to the jaw repeatedly. In the twelfth, he sent the American tumbling to the floor once more, and this time Louis could not recover. He was counted out on the floor, and Schmeling had scored the most talked-about sports upset of the year.|$|E
