Delivery {{of newly}} {{synthesized}} membranespanning proteins to the apical plasma membrane domain of polarized MDCK epithelial cells {{is dependent on}} yet unidentified sorting signals present in the luminal domains of these proteins. In this report we show that structural information for apical sorting of transmembrane neurotrophin receptors (p 75 NTR) is localized to a juxtamembrane region of the extracellular domain that is rich in O-glycosylated serine/threonine residues. An internal deletion of 50 amino acids that <b>removes</b> this <b>stalk</b> domain <b>from</b> p 75 NTR causes the protein to be sorted exclusively of the basolateral plasma membrane. Basolateral sorting stalk-minus p 75 NTR does not occur by default, but requires sequences present in the cytoplasmic domain. The stalk domain is also required fo...|$|R
40|$|We report some of {{the results}} from a 15 -year long {{rotational}} trial conducted at ICRISAT in the Southern Peninsular India that will eventually {{form the basis for}} a detailed model evaluation of Agricultural Production Systems Simulator (APSIM). This model will then be used to design crop rotations that have higher productivity and lower risks than conventional rotations like rainy fallow and post rainy sorghum or chickpea. The experimental results reported here show that this is entirely feasible. Our specific objectives were to: 1) quantify the benefits of grain legumes to non-legumes in the cropping system rotations; and 2) identify improved and sustainable cropping system options for crop productivity and intensification. Variability in the onset and distribution of monsoonal rains in June-July constitute a key risk of crop production on Vertisols. As such, fields are usually left as fallow during the rainy season (kharif) and cropped with sorghum or chickpea during only the post-rainy season (rabi) on stored soil moisture. However, due to the high water holding capacity of Vertisols, there is an opportunity to make better use of both seasons, and as such, a crop intensification approach with sequential double cropping was explored. Besides the extra crop yield gained from double -cropping, this practice may help to reduce erosion in the rainy season. Vertisols {{in this part of the}} world are generally deficient in nitrogen (N) and phosphorus. Response to N fertilization is much higher than with any other nutrient, and the response in the rainy season is greater than in the post-rainy season (Katyal, 1988). Legume-based systems have been particularly successful in providing N inputs where fertilizer is of marginal economic benefit as well as providing grain as part of the crop production system. In India, farmers <b>remove</b> <b>stalks</b> <b>from</b> the field for fodder, however relatively little N is removed in this process because stalks have very low N content. Legume root material and nodules remaining in the soil have shown positive residual effects on the subsequent cereal crop equivalent to 30 - 40 kg N ha- 1 (Kumar Rao et al., 1983). While this is not large enough to approach potential crop yields of rainy season crops, even a moderate N input could double the yield because the soils may supply as little as 30 kg N ha- 1 to cereal crops. Such results led to the establishment of a long-term experiment at ICRISAT to examine the productivity of cropping systems with improved technologies including broad bed furrow land management, high yielding varieties, fertilizers and the inclusion of short duration legume crops in rotations...|$|R
40|$|Delivery {{of newly}} {{synthesized}} membrane-spanning proteins to the apical plasma membrane domain of polarized MDCK epithelial cells {{is dependent on}} yet unidentified sorting signals present in the luminal domains of these proteins. In this report we show that structural information for apical sorting of transmembrane neurotrophin receptors (p 75 NTR) is localized to a juxtamembrane region of the extracellular domain that is rich in O-glycosylated serine/threonine residues. An internal deletion of 50 amino acids that <b>removes</b> this <b>stalk</b> domain <b>from</b> p 75 NTR causes the protein to be sorted exclusively of the basolateral plasma membrane. Basolateral sorting stalk-minus p 75 NTR does not occur by default, but requires sequences present in the cytoplasmic domain. The stalk domain is also required for apical secretion of a soluble form of p 75 NTR, providing the first demonstration that the same domain can mediate apical sorting of both a membrane-anchored as well as secreted protein. However, the single N-glycan present on p 75 NTR is not required for apical sorting of either transmembrane or secreted forms...|$|R
5000|$|It is a liana, with a three-stage lifecycle, {{each with}} a {{different}} shaped leaf, as indicated by its Greek name. In the first stage, T. peltatum forms a rosette of simple lanceolate leaves with wavey margins, and looks nondescript. However, it then additionally develops long, slender, glandular leaves mostly in February and March, resembling those of the related Drosophyllum, which capture insects; one to three of these leaves in each rosette. [...] The plant then enters its adult liana form, with short non-carnivorous leaves bearing a pair of grappling hooks [...] at the tip on a long twining stem which can become 165 feet (50 meters) in length and four inches (10 cm) thick. T. peltatum is the largest of all confirmed carnivorous plants in the world, but its carnivorous nature did not become known until 1979, some 51 years after the plant's discovery. Perhaps even more remarkable than its three very different leaf types are it fruit and seed. The seeds are about 3 inches (7.5 cm) in diameter, bright red in color and shaped like a galaxy or discus with a peltate <b>stalk</b> emerging <b>from</b> the <b>fruit.</b> Most of the seed's development occurs outside the fruit. This remarkable fruit and seed develop from an orange flower with five incurved petals.|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} plant growth {{conditions}} (light intensity. temperature and photoperiod) on {{the proportion of}} spider mites (Tetranychus urticae) and predatory mites (Phytoseiulus persimilis) entrapped by type VI trichomes were investigated in the cultivated tomato Lycopersicon esculentum. Trichomes released sticky substances showing rapid hardening when the trichome head was ruptured by contact with mites. Adult individuals of both species of mites were immobilized by exudates in a higher percentage on leaf <b>stalks</b> <b>from</b> plants grown in the light (160 mueinsteins cm- 2 s- 1) than on leaf <b>stalks</b> <b>from</b> plants grown in the shade (50 mueinsteins cm- 2 s- 1). Leaf <b>stalks</b> <b>from</b> plants grown in the light showed bigger trichome heads. More predatory mites were also entrapped on the leaf <b>stalks</b> <b>from</b> plants grown at 18 -degrees-C (65 % RH) {{as compared to the}} ones grown at 24 -degrees-C (60 % RH). whereas trichome heads were bigger under the former conditions. Contrary to leaf stalks. leaflet areas, through differences in trichome density and size, showed no differences in predator and spider mite entrapment. Trichome head size was probably related to mite entrapment. It is also hypothesised that temperature increase might influence predator entrapment through effects on trichome quality...|$|R

40|$|Mature 5 S (m 5 S) RNA from Bacillus licheniformis {{specifically}} {{and almost}} completely inhibits {{in vitro maturation}} of bacillus precursor 5 S (p 5 S) RNA, showing that the maturation enzyme RNAase M 5 can recognize Bacillus m 5 S RNA. E. coli m 5 S RNA is a much less efficient inhibitor, whereas S. carlsbergensis 5 S RNA inhibits maturation by about 70 %. The differences in inhibition can be correlated with {{the position of the}} sequence UAGG (residues 101 - 104 in B. licheniformis m 5 S RNA) relative to the double-helical region formed by the 5 '- and 3 '-terminal sequences (molecular stalk) of m 5 S RNA. Recent experiments by Meyhack and Pace (Biochemistry 17 (1980) 5804 - 5810) demonstrated this UAGG sequence to be indispensable for processing of p 5 S RNA. Other elements of secondary and/or tertiary structure are also required, however. The effect of artificially constructed " 5 S RNA" molecules having defined disturbances in the base-pairing within the molecular stalk on in vitro maturation shows that base-pairing in the immediate neighbourhood of the bonds to be cleaved during maturation is crucial to recognition of p 5 S RNA by RNAase M 5. G. U pairs are tolerated in this region, however, without loss of efficiency in maturation. Base-pairing does not have to extend throughout the complete molecular stalk. The introduction of an A/C combination {{at the end of the}} molecular <b>stalk</b> <b>removed</b> <b>from</b> the bonds cleaved by RNAase M 5 does not significantly impair the efficiency of maturation...|$|R
