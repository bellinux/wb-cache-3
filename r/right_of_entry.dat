5|$|When {{the park}} was {{enclosed}} in 1637 there were six gates in the boundary wall: Coombe Gate, Ham Gate, Richmond Gate, Robin Hood Gate, Roehampton Gate and Sheen Gate. Of these, Richmond Gate has the heaviest traffic. The present gates were designed by Sir John Soane and were widened in 1896. Sheen Gate was where the brewer John Lewis asserted pedestrian <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> in 1755 after Princess Amelia had denied it. The present double gates date from 1926. Coombe Gate (later known as Ladderstile Gate) provided access to the park for the parishioners of Coombe, with both a gate and a step ladder. The gate was locked in the early 1700s and bricked up in about 1735. The stepladder was reinstated after John Lewis's case in 1758 and remained in place until about 1884. The present gate dates from 1901. The present wrought iron gates of Roehampton Gate were installed in 1899. Ham Gate was widened in 1921, when the present wrought iron gates were installed. The chinoiserie lantern lights over the gate were installed in 1825.|$|E
25|$|The <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> {{into the}} EEA and Switzerland (includes all EU and EEA {{countries}} and Switzerland) without additional visa {{was extended to}} the third-country family members of EEA nationals exercising their treaty right of free movement who hold a valid residence card of their EEA host country and wish to visit any other EEA member state for a short stay up to 90 days. This is implied in Directive 2004/38/EC, Article 5(2) provided that they travel together with the EEA national or join their spouse/partner {{at a later date}} (Article 6(2)). If the non-EEA family member has neither an EEA residence card nor a visa, but can show their family tie with the EU national by other means, then a visa must be issued at the border free of charge and entry permitted.|$|E
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} changes made to the legal regulation of unions under the Workplace Relations and Other Legislation Amendment Act 1996 (Cth.) was to <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry.</b> <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> are a fundamentally important apparatus for unions, not only for the purpose of communicating to, and accessing members, but also as {{part of the process of}} enforcing workplace terms and conditions. The changes to <b>rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> have significant potential to marginalise and exclude unions. This paper traces the experiences of two quite different unions, revealing similar results. <b>Rights</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> are increasingly becoming the new contested terrain, manifest in hostile employer approaches, attitudes and tactics...|$|R

500|$|The main {{element of}} the tort is [...] "interference". This must be both direct and physical, with {{indirect}} interference instead being covered by negligence or nuisance. [...] "Interference" [...] covers any physical entry to land, {{as well as the}} abuse of a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry.</b> If the person has the right to enter the land but remains after this right expires, this is also trespass. It is also a trespass to throw anything on the land. For the purposes of trespass, the person who owns the land on which a road rests is treated as the owner; it is not, however, a trespass to use that road if public. In Hickman v Maisey, it was established that any use of a road that went beyond using it for its normal purpose could constitute a trespass, but this was altered by DPP v Jones. Lord Irvine, giving the leading judgment, said that [...] "the public highway is a public place which the public may enjoy for any reasonable purpose, providing that the activity in question does not amount to a public or private nuisance and does not obstruct the highway by reasonably impeding the primary right of the public to pass and repass; within these qualifications there is a public right of peaceful assembly on the highway".|$|E

He has also written and presented BBC radio programmes, including Hamburger Weekend, Used Notes, Stilgoe's Around, Maestro and Richard Stilgoe's Traffic Jam Show on BBC Radio 4.|$|E

Additionally, it planned to phase out Australian Workplace Agreements (AWAs) {{over a period of years}} with a preference of collective agreements and awards with an exclusion to those earning over $100,000. Unfair dismissal laws were to be restored to all businesses, however, employees joining companies with under 15 employees will be placed under a twelve-month probationary period. Restrictive <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> rules in to workplaces for unions introduced under Work Choices were to remain and secret ballots (rather than open ballots) to decide on carrying out strikes were to continue, which would become banned except during periods of collective bargaining.

2500|$|First, the Citizens Rights Directive 2004 article 4 says {{every citizen}} {{has the right}} to depart a member state with a valid passport. This has {{historical}} importance for central and eastern Europe, when the Soviet Union and the Berlin Wall denied its citizens the freedom to leave. Article 5 gives every citizen a <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry,</b> subject to national border controls. Schengen Area countries (not the UK and Ireland) abolished the need to show documents, and police searches at borders, altogether. These reflect the general principle of free movement in TFEU article 21. Second, article 6 allows every citizen to stay three months in another member state, whether economically active or not. Article 7 allows stays over three months with evidence of [...] "sufficient resources... not to become a burden on the social assistance system". Articles 16 and 17 give a right to permanent residence after 5 years without conditions. Third, TEU article 10(3) requires the right to vote in the local constituencies for the European Parliament wherever a citizen lives.|$|E
2500|$|The Education Amendment Act 2000, {{enacted by}} the Fifth Labour Government, {{partially}} solved this problem by putting in place a new [...] "system for determining enrolment of students in circumstances where a school has reached its roll capacity and needs to avoid overcrowding." [...] Schools which operate enrolment schemes have a geographically defined [...] "home zone". Residence in this zone, or in the school's boarding house (if it has one) gives <b>right</b> <b>of</b> <b>entry</b> to the School. Students who live outside the school's home zone can be admitted, if there are places available, {{in the following order}} of priority: special programmes; siblings of currently enrolled students; siblings of past students; children of past students; children of board employees and staff; all other students. If there are more applications than available places then selection must be through a randomly drawn ballot. The system is complicated by some state schools having boarding facilities for students living beyond the school's zone. Typically these students live in isolated farming regions in New Zealand, or their parents may live or work partly overseas. Many secondary schools offer limited scholarships to their boarding establishment to attract talented students in imitation of private school practice.|$|E
