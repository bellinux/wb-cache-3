Precisely, the proposal dealt with two areas of concern. First, it proposed to involve local resources in the form of traditional leaders and chiefs in the data-gathering process. Secondly, this proposal suggested the development (or at least, a consideration of the potentials) of a personal identification system in data and medical <b>records</b> <b>linkage.</b> The net effect was the provision of timely and quality data or the quantification of the health needs required for comprehensive health planning, since presently, less than 30 percent of pertinent State data is available only from the urban centers...|$|R

METHODS: The study was conducted using the <b>recorded</b> <b>linkage</b> database at a local public health agency in north-east Italy.

RESULTS: An underutilization of primary care services and the use of A and E for nonurgent conditions is a problem affecting all nationalities, natives included. The length of the stay in A and E and the consistency between level of urgency and priority of the visits at entry and exit triage were similar for all citizenship groups. Illegal migrants were more frequently hospitalized after A and E visits than other groups.

40|$|Poster Presentation This poster {{presents}} the results of a <b>records</b> <b>linkage</b> project to analyze potential mortality risks for young adults in Ontario during the 1918 influenza epidemic. With a team of research assistants at Western University, McMaster University, and the Université de Montréal, death records were linked to birth records in order to determine exact date of birth for the calculation of exact age at death. This date of birth is then compared to age as listed on other historical documents, such as the 1901 and 1911 Canadian censuses. The family environment (or living situation) was transcribed for each individual at each census to examine the impact of socioeconomic conditions throughout the lifecourse on mortality in 1918. Of the 23, 183 deaths registered in Ontario between September and December 1918 and transcribed by the International Infectious Disease Data Archive at McMaster University, 3, 316 individuals met the inclusion criteria. Both birth and death must have occurred in Ontario to establish exact date of birth and the individual must have died between the ages of 23 and 35 (born between 1883 and 1895). Of the 3, 316 included death records, 2, 965 were linked to at least one other <b>record,</b> giving a <b>linkage</b> success rate of 89. 4 %. This poster analyzes the linkage rates of the death records to birth records from 1883 - 1895 and the 1901 and 1911 Canadian censuses and uses logistic regression to investigate the important factors that precluded linkage.

40|$|Objective: To {{estimate}} population attributable fractions (PAF) {{of acute}} myocardial infarction (AMI) associated with anthropometric measures by sex and age. Methods: The Cohort of Norway study identified 140, 790 participants free of cardiovascular disease, 1994 - 2003. Participants were followed for AMI through 2009 by <b>record</b> <b>linkages</b> through the Cardiovascular Disease in Norway Project. PAFs were adjusted for age, smoking, systolic blood pressure, diabetes, and the ratio of total cholesterol to high-density lipoprotein cholesterol. Results: The PAFs associated with a waist–hip ratio (WHR) in the top two quintiles were 26. 1 % (95 % confidence interval, CI 14. 6 – 36. 1) for middle-aged women (< 60 years, mean of 41 years) and 9. 3 % (95 % CI 3. 0 – 15. 1) for similarly aged men after adjustment for body mass index (BMI) and conventional risk factors. However, PAFs associated with anthropometric measures in elderly participants (60 years, mean of 70 years) were nonsignificant in multivariable analyses.

50|$|<b>Record</b> <b>linkage</b> is an {{important}} tool in creating data required for examining {{the health of the}} public and {{of the health care system}} itself. It can be used to improve data holdings, data collection, quality assessment, and the dissemination of information. Data sources can be examined to eliminate duplicate records, to identify under-reporting and missing cases (e.g., census population counts), to create person-oriented health statistics, and to generate disease registries and health surveillance systems. Some cancer registries link various data sources (e.g., hospital admissions, pathology and clinical reports, and death registrations) to generate their registries. <b>Record</b> <b>linkage</b> is also used to create health indicators. For example, fetal and infant mortality is a general indicator of a country's socioeconomic development, public health, and maternal and child services. If infant death records are matched to birth records, it is possible to use birth variables, such as birth weight and gestational age, along with mortality data, such as cause of death, in analyzing the data. Linkages can help in follow-up studies of cohorts or other groups to determine factors such as vital status, residential status, or health outcomes. Tracing is often needed for follow-up of industrial cohorts, clinical trials, and longitudinal surveys to obtain the cause of death and/or cancer. An example of a successful and long-standing <b>record</b> <b>linkage</b> system allowing for population-based medical research is the Rochester Epidemiology Project based in Rochester, Minnesota.|$|E
