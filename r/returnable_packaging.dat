40|$|This study, {{drawing on}} natural resource-based view (NRBV), {{identifies}} drivers, barriers {{and the potential}} benefits of <b>Returnable</b> Transport <b>Packaging</b> (RTP) –that is, the repeated use of packaging items– and conceptualises RTP as a technology and resource that supports organisational competitiveness. Specifically, it investigates the impact of RTP adoption on business performance, the effects of drivers, barriers and size of organisations. The data collection took place in Nigeria and South Africa. The findings suggest that RTP has a significant positive impact on business performance. Whilst prior studies seem to suggest that shrinkage and attrition are the major problems identified with the usage of RTP, our findings indicate that there are several other barriers affecting RTP adoption and the resultant performance advantage. The results also show that there is increasing move towards adoption of RTP but some organisations are faced with financial constraints, especially the small and medium size enterprises. In addition, the results show that RTP is largely a ‘sustainability facing’ initiative with adoptee motivated primarily by potential environmental, economic, social and operational benefits of adoption...|$|R

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{understand}} how reverse resource exchanges and resource dependencies are managed in the service supply chain (SSC) of <b>returnable</b> transport <b>packaging</b> (RTP). Design/methodology/approach: A single case study was conducted in the context of automotive logistics focusing on the RTP SSC. Data were collected through 16 interviews, primarily with managers of a logistics service provider (LSP) and document analysis of contractual agreements with key customers of the packaging service. Findings: Resource dependencies among actors in the SSC result from the importance of the RTP for the customer’s production processes, the competition among users for RTP and the negative implications of the temporary unavailability of RTP for customers and the LSP (in terms of service performance). Amongst other things, the LSP is dependent on its customers and third-party users (e. g. the customer’s suppliers) for the timely return of package resources. The role of inter-firm integration and collaboration, formal contracts as well as customers’ power and influence over third-party RTP users are stressed as key mechanisms for managing LSP’s resource dependencies. Research limitations/implications: A resource dependence theory (RDT) lens is used to analyse how reverse resource exchanges and associated resource dependencies in SSCs are managed, thus complementing the existing SSC literature emphasising the bi-directionality of resource flows. The study also extends the recent SSC literature stressing the role of contracting by empirically demonstrating how formal contracts can be mobilised to explicate resource dependencies and to specify, and regulate, reverse exchanges in the SSC.

40|$|Packaging is a {{fundamental}} element in logistics systems. Packaging not only affects every logistical activity; it is also recognised as having {{a significant impact on}} logistics costs and performance. In order for logisticians and packaging professionals to gain insight into packaging-dependent costs and performance, the interactions between packaging systems and logistics systems must be understood. This is instead of dividing packaging and logistics into separate systems which are analysed on their own, and assuming that the ?whole? is the sum of the systems. Therefore, the overall purpose of this thesis is to explore interactions between packaging and logistics. The research is applied and interdisciplinary, and bases itself on inductive reasoning. Methodologically, this thesis is qualitative, primarily using case study as research strategy. A case study involving four retail supply chains is conducted in this research to obtain insights into interactions between packaging and logistics. A single case study is also conducted to explore the packaging, logistics, marketing, and environmental consequences of introducing an innovative unit load carrier. Moreover, two case studies are conducted to study the use of radio frequency identification (RFID) technology in managing and controlling <b>returnable</b> transport <b>packaging.</b> This research provides a comprehensive overview of the physical interactions between packaging systems and logistics systems in retail supply chains. The research serves as an elementary step towards understanding the role of packaging in logistics, and as an aid in showing how packaging-related decisions might impact on supply chains. This research implies that understanding the interactions between packaging and logistics makes it possible to make decisions, such as changing the packaging system or logistics system, or both, based on a holistic packaging approach. Moreover, this research provide insights into the cost and process of implementing RFID technology, and highlights significant savings and benefits, as well as the potential benefits and risks of implementing RFID in packaging systems. As a result, the research provides the means {{to bridge the gap between}} packaging and logistics professionals and presents a model of the impact of decisions on packaging and logistics systems. Moreover, a model of the RFID implementation process is proposed, where implications for management are identified to guide managers in the process of implementing RFID...|$|R

Ele Ã um {{material}} utilizado em garrafÃes retornÃveis para acondicionamento de Ãgua mineral. O processo de fabricaÃÃo dos garrafÃes Ã de grande importÃncia, pois objetiva a produÃÃo de um material uniforme, que de certa maneira garante qualidade para resistir Ãs intempÃries do tempo e aos diversos processos de envasamento de Ãgua, estocagem e distribuiÃÃo. Os ÃrgÃos governamentais regulamentaram que o tempo de vida Ãtil das embalagens Ã somente de trÃs anos. A validade da Ãgua em garrafÃes lacrados varia de 60 a 120 dias. Depois de aberto, a recomendaÃÃo Ã consumir em atÃ duas semanas. A degradaÃÃo do PCBFA foi estudada utilizando garrafÃes de 20 litros de diferentes anos de fabricaÃÃo (0 - 15 anos), observou-se o efeito do tempo na mudanÃa das caracterÃsticas e propriedades do material. Verificou-se que a espessura dos garrafÃes diminui com o tempo de fabricaÃÃo. A partir de 8 anos de fabricaÃÃo, possÃveis mudanÃas estruturais, como a descarboxilaÃÃo, diminuiÃÃo da temperatura de transiÃÃo vÃtrea e alteraÃÃo nas propriedades mecÃnicas foram constatadas atravÃs das tÃcnicas de infravermelho (FTIR), Calorimetria ExploratÃria Diferencial (DSC) e por ensaios mecÃnicos de traÃÃo, respectivamente. Por microscopia eletrÃnica de varredura (MEV), verificou-se que a superfÃcie externa apresentou-se com mais alteraÃÃes morfolÃgicas em relaÃÃo Ã superfÃcie interna. Por anÃlise termogravimÃtrica (TGA), notou-se que o PCBFA da superfÃcie interna tem uma menor estabilidade tÃrmica que a superfÃcie externa do garrafÃo. Por anÃlise de fluorescÃncia foi detectada a presenÃa de BFA em Ãgua destilada mantida em contato com o garrafÃo estocada durante 2 meses. O BFA Ã o reagente utilizado na sÃntese industrial do PCBFA onde o mesmo Ã um desregulador endÃcrino que causa alteraÃÃes hormonais no sistema endÃcrino. Pode-se concluir que os garrafÃes de PCBFA sofrem degradaÃÃo com o passar dos anos a ponto do material perder suas principais propriedades, tanto na superfÃcie externa e interna. A relevÃncia maior do estudo evidencia sobre a validade dos garrafÃes e a possÃvel liberaÃÃo de BFA na Ãgua.

The manufacturing {{process of the}} carboys is of great importance, because it aims {{the production of a}} uniform material, which somehow ensures quality to withstand the incl ement weather of weather and the various processes of potting water, stocking and di stribution of carboys. Government agencies have regulated that the time of validity o f the carboys is only three years. The validity of water in sealed bottles ranges from 60 to 120 days. Once opened, the recommendation is to consume within two weeks. The degradation was studied using PCBFA of 20 liters carboys of different fabrication years (0 - 15 years), we observed the effect of time in changing of the characteristics a nd properties of material. It was found that the thickness of carboys lowers with time of f abrication. From 8 years of manufacturing, possible structural changes, such as decarboxylation, reduction in glass transition temperature and changes in mechanical pr operties were observed via infrared techniques (FTIR), differential scanning calorimetr y (DSC) and tensile test, respectively. By scanning electron microscopy, it w as found that the external surface appeared with more morphological changes in relatio n to the inner surface. By thermogravimetric analysis (TGA), it was noted that the PCBFA the inner surface has a lower thermal stability than the outer surface of t he carboy. By fluorescence analysis, we detected the presence of BFA in distilled water kept in contact with the stored carboy for 2 months. BFA is the reagent used in the industrial synthesis of PCBFA where it is an endocrine disrupter which causes hor monal changes in the endocrine system.

The less known reverse supply chain is an upcoming research theme, with more companies adapting this concept. In the beverages industry this reverse logistics are common and based on <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging,</b> so called empties. Beer brewers are {{under a lot of pressure}} and cost reductions are essential to remain competitive and to survive. This research aims at creating knowledge on redesigning a reverse supply chain driven by <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> from a transport logistic perspective. This research is performed based on a proposed method called DMADE. The research problem is identified as a lack of knowledge on redesigning of a reverse supply chain driven by <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging.</b> Literature is researched and a new process improvement method called VSM-I is introduced. This combines both physical values streams with information flow swimlanes. Performance measures are defined for the reverse flow. A case study is performed and the current state of the supply chain at Heineken is created. By analyzing this current state, waste that obstruct improved performance is identified. 4 New transport logistic strategies are introduced based on the analysis. The current state transport strategy, Strategy 1; the triple trip, Strategy 2; Direct trip from market to sorter and Strategy 3; a direct trip the market with sorted empties to the production warehouse(LCDB). A discrete event simulation model is constructed to evaluate {{the performance}} based on an experimental plan. The 4 transport strategies with each 10 input scenarios that capture potential growth, new processing times and other mix of sorted and unsorted empties returned. They are tested based on cycle time, throughput, CO 2 emission, inventory utilization, handling cost and storage cost. The transport strategies show that introducing Strategy 3; direct trip from the market to the LCDB is the most beneficial for cycle time reduction and increase in throughput. Depending on the input scenario up to 3. 36 weeks € 2. 359 k of cycle time can be reduced and an increase of 4, 3 % in throughput is realized. Strategy 1; the triple trip reduces 165 tons of CO 2 emission per year. Strategy 2; direct trip from the market to Leiter performs the best handling and storage cost reduction with respective € 231 k & € 373 k savings. Inventory utilization results show a shift of inventory to other locations in the supply chain since no changes to the initial inventory levels are made when changing transport strategies.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to develop an {{evaluation}} model for the selection of packaging systems in supply chains from a sustainability perspective. A theoretical evaluation model for comparing cost efficiency and the environmental impact of packaging systems in supply chains are developed from literature. The model is tested in a case study of a supply chain involving Volvo Car Corporation and Volvo Logistics Corporation, comparing the use of newly developed, one-way packaging with the sustainability of <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging.</b> The model compares the environmental and economic impacts of two packaging systems in a specific supply chain. The criteria used in the model are (i) packaging fill rate, (ii) packaging material, (iii) transport, (iv) material handling, (v) waste handling and (vi) administration. In the case study, the one-way packaging resulted in fewer economic and environmental impacts, thereby indicating the importance for companies to question their packaging systems. The model has been tested on one component in a case study. It provides a comparison of the packaging choices included using comparative, but not absolute, figures for the economic and environmental impacts. Managers can use the model to compare packaging systems for component supply and determine the most sustainable packaging from environmental and economic perspectives.

Models that consider the different logistical costs {{associated with the use of}} RTIs as well as the interdependencies that arise between the management of RTIs and the distribution of finished products, in contrast, have not been proposed thus far. To close this gap, this paper studies a supplier who uses <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> material for supplying a product to multiple customers.

40|$|Reverse {{logistics}} {{is considered}} to be the key for re-manufacturing and sustainable development. It has gained increasing attention in the last decade and has been a new frontier of strategic management. One of the driving forces for firms to adopt the reverse logistics practice is cost saving from reverse logistics activities. Another motivation to put reverse logistics forward is probably due to environmental impacts on non-returnable materials. Reverse logistics, however, may require cooperation of more than one company and hence it is generally poorly managed due to self-interest of different companies. Therefore, a pro-active and collaborative approach to reverse logistics is demanded. This paper reports a case study of using <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> materials between a manufacturer and an original equipment manufacturer (OEM) supplier.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} a study for {{analysing}} costs affected by packaging in a producing industry. The purpose {{is to develop a}} model that will calculate and present possible cost savings for the customer by using Volvo Logistics Corporations, VLC’s, <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> instead of other packaging solutions. The thesis is based on qualitative data gained from both theoretical and empirical studies. The methodology for gaining information has been to study theoretical sources such as course literature and articles, as well as through interviews and consolidation with staff at Volvo Logistics Corporations office in Gothenburg. The model is constructed in Microsoft Excel and consists of six different sheets. The first sheet is a front page that summarises the costs calculated in the other sheets and presents the possible cost savings. After the front page there are three sheets with calculations for the costs in different scenarios, Today’s Situation, VLC Packaging Solution (Pre implementation) and VLC Packaging Solution (Post implementation). The first sheet, Today’s Situation, presents the result of the model that will calculate the customers’ current costs that are associated with packaging. The different costs presented in the model are costs for unloading, repacking, today’s cost for an internal packaging solution, quality related costs, one-way packaging costs and the costs for other packaging solutions. The next sheet, VLC Packaging Solution (Pre), presents an estimation of the cost for thecustomer when using VLC’s <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> system. The estimation will serve as an investment tool, for calculating possible cost savings compared to the present situation. The different costs that will be discussed are handling costs, quality related costs, distribution cost, transaction cost, and investment cost. The third and final calculation sheet, VLC Packaging Solution (Post), presents the actual costs for the customer after the implementation. When the costs have been calculated they will be used to evaluate the actual cost savings for the customer. The last two sheets are a data sheet, which consists of data needed for the calculations in the previous sheets, and an instruction sheet where there are instructions to the different calculations in the model.

The Spanish company ECOMOVISTAND has developed an innovative and ecological packaging and transport unit, called MT, for the grocery supply chain, which can be used in the entire product cycle; that is, the MT serves (1) as packaging at the producer, (2) as transport unit, (3) as storage at warehouses, and (4) as display stand at the supermarket, all in the same mechanical system, being thus a <b>Returnable</b> <b>Packaging</b> and Transport Unit. An MT needs the support of information technologies to achieve its true potential. In this paper we show the work developed in collaboration with ECOMOVISTAND in order to turn the MT into an intelligent product platform by embedding Active RFID tags. Data flows are integrated into an information system, called MEGASTAND, which allows to track MTs over the entire supply chain and provide value-added services to the customers...|$|E
40|$|Packaging is a {{fundamental}} element in logistics, which significantly affects costs and efficiency of logistics activities. Returnable and reusable packaging items are seen as corporate assets and capital investments for companies. However, one problem regarding <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> management is that companies usually have weak visibility and control over them especially in extensive supply chain networks. The purpose of control is to assure returning of assets, satisfy service level and make sure to utilize packaging efficiently. The cores of this study constitute identifying important factors in business models regarding packaging management, and evaluation of their efficiency based on critical performance indicators i. e. leakage and turnaround time in the network. Therefore, this study first created an analytical framework {{in order to provide}} holistic view over packaging systems and their management by combining different elements in the packaging control systems. The six important dimensions of the framework are loop design, packaging ownership types, pool control systems, order management, network design and tracking systems. Then this study analyzes the efficiency of the packaging pool at Volvo Logistics Services and finally provides recommended solutions to achieve higher level of control in their packaging management system...|$|E
40|$|Optimized {{logistic}} structures offer great avoidance potentials {{and allow}} for a packaging reduced good distribution. In general, the view of packaging problems is black-and-white. This is an obtacle to an efficient packaging design and can easily result in political solutions which only consider partial aspects concerning environmental pollution. Logistical optimizations are not based on trivial solutions such as: <b>returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> is better than non-returnable packaging or {{paper and cardboard packaging}} is favourable to plastic; but their whole task is the secure goods distribution with minimal packaging. 'ne development of circular systems is the basic requirement for the solution of this problem. According to the product and distribution requirements the combination of systems for returnable and non- returnable materials, i. e. of different circular processes, is the prerequisit for closed material circuits. The rules and regulations by the legislation, with the Federal Republic obvi ously playing a leading role, show that the recycling of the packing material is a first step towards an extensive product liability. Material recycling means that secondary raw materials have to be the result which can be used for products of highquality - comparable to the very first products...|$|E
40|$|This diploma thesis {{has been}} created based on the demand of the {{management}} of DHL Exel Supply Chain and Swindon Pressings Limited {{to increase the efficiency}} and utilization of resources employed within they operations. The theoretical introduction part is first of dealing with the terms "logistics" and "supply chain management" in the perspective of their use in the contemporary logistics theory, comparison of their meaning (are there differences) and explanation of their use in this thesis. Subsequently I am explaining "reverse logistic" and its position in the structures of corporations and logistics itself. Supply chain management and the concept of lean manufacturing combined with the six sigma approach are, from my point of view, essential for today's supplier-customer relationships. That is why those topics are examined in {{the last part of the}} theoretical chapter. <b>Returnable</b> <b>packaging</b> and the transport process are key elements of the second part [...] practical part, the reengineering of logistics processes which occurred at Swindon Pressings Limited. The aim of this thesis is to analyze the give problem, develop problem solving options and critically comment them. Finally choose one of the options, implement it and document the process of "going live"...|$|E
