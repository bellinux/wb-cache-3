5|$|The YF-23 was {{designed}} to meet USAF requirements for survivability, supercruise, stealth, and ease of maintenance. Supercruise requirements called for prolonged supersonic flight {{without the use of}} afterburners. Northrop drew on its experience with the B-2 Spirit and F/A-18 Hornet to reduce the model's susceptibility to radar and infrared detection. The USAF initially required the aircraft to land and stop within , which meant the use of thrust reversers on their engines. In 1987, the USAF changed the <b>runway</b> <b>length</b> requirement to , so thrust reversers were no longer needed. This allowed the aircraft to have smaller engine nacelle housings. The nacelles were not downsized on the prototypes.|$|E
5|$|Avinor {{has also}} {{proposed}} lowering the terrain {{east of the}} airport. The terrain is actually flatter to the east, but because the runway was expanded in that direction, the extension cannot be used without removing all ground in the twelve-degree slope. Although it has no impact on smaller aircraft, the reduced <b>runway</b> <b>length</b> has a severe impact {{on the performance of}} Boeing 737 aircraft, which are used by both Norwegian and SAS. For instance, during winter a 180-seat 737-800 can only utilize 71 percent of its permitted take-off weight; this would hinder fully loaded aircraft flying further than Oslo. The impacts for 150-seat 737-700 aircraft are smaller, as they can reach Oslo during winter and Berlin during summer. The airport served 169,428 passengers in 1996 and 216,000 passengers in 2000.|$|E
25|$|Numerous {{attempts}} to expand safety buffer zones and add <b>runway</b> <b>length</b> have drawn {{opposition from the}} airport's neighbors, citing increased noise. Open space around the airport is nonexistent, making land acquisition unlikely.|$|E

25|$|The largest {{aircraft}} KSIA {{currently has}} scheduled services {{for is the}} Boeing 777-300ER, with Emirates operating Dubai–Durban, {{despite the fact that}} KSIA's <b>runway</b> <b>length</b> and terminal were designed to theoretically handle regular large airliners. In September 2015, during the World Routes Conference which was held in Durban (the first time on African soil), Turkish Airlines announced a new international service to Istanbul and Qatar Airways announced the commencement of service to Doha in December of that year.|$|E
25|$|Eros Airport is {{the busiest}} airport in Namibia {{in terms of}} take offs and {{landings}} and a domestic hub for Air Namibia. This city airport handles approximately 150 to 200 movements per day (around 50,000 per year). In 2004, the airport served 141,605 passengers, the majority of which are light aircraft. Primarily, limitations such as <b>runway</b> <b>length,</b> noise, and air space congestion have kept Eros from developing into a larger airport. Most of Namibia's charter operators have Eros as their base.|$|E
25|$|The {{completed}} works involved above ground-level (AGL) earthworks and pavement upgrades, {{extension of}} the <b>runway</b> <b>length</b> from 2454 metres to 3780 metres, widening of shoulders from 46 metres to 60 metres, extension of parallel taxiway to a full parallel taxiway with interconnection/rapid exit taxiways including widening of taxiway fillets and shoulders to 30 metres. The air-side apron works included {{the construction of a}} cargo apron, high-intensity lightings and markings. Visual and non-visual aids will be upgraded and/or relocated consistent with the upgrading plan to serve the extended runway. With nine gates, the airport can handle six narrow body aircraft (such as Boeing 737 and Airbus A320), three widebody aircraft and four turboprop aircraft. Of note, gate number 9 was specifically constructed for Airbus A380-800 operations.|$|E

25|$|The 1962 state {{commission}} led by Preben Munthe {{recommended in}} a 1965 white paper that Haugesund receive an airport. It prioritized Haugesund second—after {{the completion of}} Harstad/Narvik Airport, Evenes and Kristiansund Airport, Kvernberget—and parallel with proposed airports in Leknes and Sandnessjøen. This led to a new debate about the location of an airport for Haugesund. The main concern with Utvik {{was that it would}} occupy agricultural land. Twenty-three other locations were considered by a local commission, including sites in Sveio, Tysvær and southern Karmøy. They found Utvik and Sør-Karmøyheia to be the most suitable. The Civil Aviation Administration (later renamed Avinor) considered those places and also looked into Kongsheiene. These sites limited the <b>runway</b> <b>length</b> to , respectively. Karmøy Municipal Council rejected the Utvik alternative in May 1966 of concern to farmland.|$|E
25|$|In 1981, a {{development}} {{plan for the}} airport recommended constructing a 3,500m east–west runway to facilitate growth in cargo operations, particularly during the night hours. The new runway would greatly reduce noise impact over the towns of Beek, Meerssen {{and the city of}} Maastricht. Although some night operations are allowed (including distribution of the European edition of The Wall Street Journal), <b>runway</b> <b>length</b> limits intercontinental operations. The Dutch government initially approved plans for the runway in 1985, however, the new runway would mean increased noise over other towns and parts of Belgium as well, and the final decision was delayed. As the new east-west runway would require substantial investment, it would only be profitable if night operations were permitted and increasingly the debate became focused on whether or not night flights should be allowed. Successive cabinets could not reach a final decision, and in 1998, after some 25 years of debate and postponement, the plan was aborted altogether.|$|E
25|$|During the pre-war era, flying boats {{had been}} {{preferred}} for conducting long distance flights as, unlike their land-based counterparts, {{they were not}} limited by available <b>runway</b> <b>length</b> – the majority of which were still grass-surfaced at this point – and as a long range aeroplane {{would be required to}} carry a large load of fuel, a larger size of the aircraft could be permitted without needing to cater for factors such as limited runway and airfield sizes. In addition, for services to far-flung parts of the British Empire, the ability to land and take-off from any available area of water was a distinct advantage for services to such places, many of which at the time had no airport facilities at all. With the end of the Second World War, flying boats services were resumed with other types being operated, such as the Short Hythe, Short Sandringham, and Short Solent. However, the war had also produced a legacy of large runways and sizable airports formerly used for military purposes that could now meet the needs of a larger generation of land aircraft.|$|E
50|$|There are ten {{airports}} in Sierra Leone, of which one has paved <b>runways</b> (the <b>length</b> of which exceeds 3047 m).

25|$|On July 30, 1971, Pan Am Flight 845, a Boeing 747 (registration: N747PA, name: Clipper America), struck {{navigational aids}} {{at the end}} of runway 1R on takeoff for Tokyo. The aircraft's landing gear and other systems were damaged. Two {{passengers}} were seriously injured by metal components of the runway approach light pier entering the cabin. The flight proceeded out over the Pacific Ocean to dump fuel to reduce weight for an emergency landing. Emergency services deployed at the airport, and the plane returned and landed on runway 28R. During landing the aircraft veered off the runway. There was no fire. After coming to a stop, the aircraft slowly tilted aft, coming to rest on its tail in a nose-high attitude. The forward evacuation slides were therefore in a nearly vertical position. Evacuation using these slides caused all of the additional injuries, some severe. There were no fatalities among the 218 passengers and crew members aboard. An investigation determined that the cause of the accident was erroneous information from the flight dispatcher to the crew members regarding weight and <b>runway</b> <b>length.</b>|$|E

500|$|Førde Airport, Øyrane {{was located}} in the {{industrial}} area Øyrane, immediately west of the town center of Førde. The terminal facilities were located {{on the shore of}} the river of Jølstra and consisted of a control tower, a passenger terminal, a hangar for Førdefly and a wharf used by the seaplanes. The airport was owned by Førde Municipality. It consisted of a single [...] asphalt runway aligned 14–32 and with a [...] stopway on each end.

500|$|Additionally, due to {{the high}} average {{take-off}} speed of , Concorde needed upgraded brakes. Like most airliners, Concorde has anti-skid braking– a system which prevents the tyres from losing traction when the brakes are applied for greater control during roll-out.

500|$|Another {{program that}} the Air Force is {{considering}} is the [...] "Avionics Modernization Program" [...] (AMP). AMP would equip the E-3s with glass cockpits. The Air Force also wants modified E-3s with jet engines {{that are more}} reliable than the original ones, and also with at least 19% higher fuel efficiencies. New turbofan engines would give these E-3s longer ranges, longer time-on-station, and a shorter critical <b>runway</b> <b>length.</b> If the modification is carried out, the E-3s could take off with full fuel loads using runways only [...] long, and also at higher ambient temperatures and lower barometric pressures, such as from bases in mountainous areas. Now that the E-8 Joint STARS are being fitted with the new Pratt & Whitney JT8D-219 turbofans, which are stated as having one-half {{the cost of the}} competing engine, the CFM56, the Air Force is again studying the possibility of replacing the E-3's original turbofan engines with more-efficient ones.|$|E
50|$|Nine airfields (Alconbury, Bassingbourn, Chelveston, Grafton Underwood, Kimbolton, Molesworth, Podington, Polebrook, and Thurleigh) were {{allotted to}} the Eighth Air Force {{but had been}} {{completed}} prior to the Class A standard for <b>runway</b> <b>lengths.</b> These were brought to Class A standards in 1942 and early 1943 by extending their runways, repositioning their perimeter tracks, and adding additional hardstands.|$|R

500|$|A {{test flight}} was {{conducted}} in May 2006 to prove the aircraft's steep approach and short runway performance by landing at London City Airport, where such steep approaches are required. The test flight also confirmed the aircraft's compatibility with the limited manoeuvring and parking space at that airport. Subsequently, in August 2009 Airbus delivered the first A318 with steep approach capability to British Airways, which began operating the route the following month, eventually having two such aircraft capable of flights between London City Airport and John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York. On the outbound leg from London, a stopover is necessary for refueling, which occurs at Shannon Airport, Ireland because weight restrictions are {{necessary in order to}} take off within the existing short <b>runway</b> <b>length</b> of London City Airport. On the eastbound leg from New York this limitation is not present and the plane can take all the fuel needed for the transatlantic route to London.
