This thesis examines the influence of Hispanic ethnicity on perceived family-related and nature- related benefits of recreation. As the theoretical framework for this study, Milton Gordon's ethnic assimilation theory was used to test the hypotheses for patterns indicative of Anglo-conformity in perceived <b>recreation</b> <b>benefits</b> and for deviations suggestive of selective acculturation. Based upon evidence of the core cultural value of familism among Hispanics, it was hypothesized that family-related <b>recreation</b> <b>benefits</b> would resist assimilation and display patterns of selective acculturation. Due to the absence of similar evidence pertaining to environmental dispositions, the study hypothesized that nature-related benefits would be influenced by the assimilation process and display a pattern of Anglo-conformity. The survey was designed to be a replication of Gramann and Floyd's study of the Phoenix metropolitan area. A telephone survey conducted in central and southern California produced a final sample of 995 cases. Although the sample achieved representativeness for the Hispanic sub- population in both gender and low income categories, Hispanics in the sample reported more years of education than those in the California study area. Assimilation was operationalized by measures of primary structural assimilation and language acculturation. Results of factor analysis were used to create the benefits and acculturation scales. Analysis of covariance was used to test the hypotheses because it controls the covariates while allowing the levels of the main effect to be contrasted. The dependent variables, family-related and nature-related <b>recreation</b> <b>benefits,</b> were tested to determine if there were significant differences between Anglos and Hispanic respondents with different levels of primary structural assimilation and language acculturation. Statistical analysis of the hypotheses pertaining to nature-related <b>recreation</b> <b>benefits</b> produced patterns of Anglo- conformity for both language acculturation and primary structural assimilation. The statistical results were less clear for family-related <b>recreation</b> <b>benefits,</b> but no patterns of selective acculturation were found. For the hypothesis in which language acculturation was a significant main effect, it is possible that a pattern of Anglo-conformity was influenced by an immigration effect...|$|E

40|$|Water {{pollution}} control policies generally direct sources (i. e., industry, agriculture) to reduce loadings of certain pollutants. Thus, evaluating the relative net <b>recreation</b> <b>benefits</b> of policies to improve water quality requires establishing a linkage between the sources, the resultant water quality degradation at the affected water bodies, and, ultimately, {{the effect on}} recreation behavior. This linkage is rarely present in the empirical literature which is, thus, deficient for water {{pollution control}} policy assessment purposes. In this paper, we estimate the relative recreational swimming benefits that may result from controlling point and nonpoint sources of pollution, respectively, in New Hampshire's lakes. We use a repeated discrete choice framework to model swimming behavior {{as a function of}} each lake's level of eutrophication, bacteria, and oil and grease. For each pollutant, at each affected lake, we identify which source is responsible for the pollution, and we conduct scenarios controlling each pollution source independently, and then, taken together. Seasonal benefit estimates are presented for each scenario. Coupled with information on the most cost effective means of generating the scenarios, these estimates provide a useful starting point for a quantitative assessment of the net <b>recreation</b> <b>benefits</b> of policies {{to improve the quality of}} New Hampshire lakes.

Since the meta- regression model {{takes into account}} some of the study specific effects on willingness to pay (WTP) estimates, benefit transfer using meta-analysis could yield a valid WTP estimate of unstudied recreation resources. The convergent validity of the meta-analytic benefit transfer is tested using out-of-sample original studies from the U. S. The analyses are performed using percentage difference, paired t-test, regression and correlation tests. The tests reveal mixed results on convergence between estimated WTP using meta-analytic benefit transfer function (BTF) and out-of-sample original WTP values. There is a fairly high percentage difference between the estimated and original WTP values (80 – 88 %), and the mean differences are statistically significant as shown by paired t-tests.

University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2014 For {{the first}} time, outdoor {{recreation}} theory is applied {{within the framework}} of resilience theory to define the conceptual relationship between <b>recreation</b> <b>benefit</b> outcomes and community resilience. A theoretical and practical disconnect between the two disciplines is evident from the lack of literature identifying conceptual and operational linkages. Emerging from the application is a Recreation System Community Resilience Framework that models agent behavior, embedded green space, networks of service providers and feedback mechanisms to demonstrate recreation connections to resilience concepts. The Recreation Benefits-Based Model is identified as the best fit to deliver sustainable high leverage and capacity-building resilience for communities. Anchorage, Alaska neighborhoods are chosen to test the operational relationship between the constructs of outdoor recreation opportunity diversity and community resilience and adaptive capacity. The findings indicate support for the hypothesis that community resilience increases as recreation diversity increases. The results demand widespread implementation of the Benefits-Based Model in order for recreation to fully participate in the community well-being, resilience, and adaptive capacity discussion. The message to resilience practitioners is to reject activity-based visitor numbers, trail miles and park acres to indicate community health and insist on meaningful recreation system outcome indicators...|$|R

If these improved conditions can be adequately identified and measured, then they can be applied to recreation policy and planning decisions. Little research has been done on <b>recreation</b> <b>benefits.</b> Much of what has been done is descriptive and has focused on family relations and adolescent self-concept. This study examined these concepts and their relationship to adolescents who hunt in a causal framework. Data for this study were collected using a survey method. Data were obtained from adult Oregon Roosevelt elk hunters and teenage children with whom they hunt, and from young hunters and nonhunters attending high school in Corvallis, Oregon. Results were written as two separate manuscripts. The first manuscript compared self-concept evaluations of adolescents who hunt with those who do not hunt, and examined responses of adults and related adolescents who hunt together. Results indicated adolescents who hunt may feel less comfortable in social relationships than nonhunters, and adults and adolescents who hunt together share positive feelings about the effect of hunting on family relations.
