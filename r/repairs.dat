5|$|In 2005, the {{building}} {{was in need of}} some <b>repairs</b> due to neglect and damage from squirrels. The Lisbon Historical Society received a $5,000 grant from the Quinebaug Shetucket National Heritage Corridor to make <b>repairs</b> on the synagogue. <b>Repairs</b> would be done to repair the structure and the electrical wiring would be replaced for free by the students at the Norwich Regional Vocational Technical School.|$|E
5|$|In August 2016, the MBTA began a $6.1 million {{improvement}} {{project at}} the station. The work includes drainage improvements, sidewalk and cobblestone replacement, stair and elevator <b>repairs,</b> painting of the garage structure to prevent rust, structural <b>repairs</b> to the garage, expansion joint replacement, and platform <b>repairs.</b> It {{is expected to be}} completed by November 2016.|$|E
5|$|Temporary <b>repairs</b> began immediately, {{but due to}} {{the limited}} drydock space in the port, <b>repairs</b> to the hull were not {{effected}} until 11 September. Dunkerque was refloated on 27 September and her propulsion system was returned to operational status. A major fire broke out on 5 December, however, which slowed down the repair effort. Repair work lasted for the entirety of 1941, and on 25 January 1942 another fire broke out. The temporary <b>repairs</b> were completed by 19 February, which permitted the ship to depart Mers-el-Kébir, under heavy escort, bound for Toulon. She arrived the following day, and entered the large Vauban drydock for comprehensive <b>repairs.</b>|$|E

5|$|All {{weapons and}} apparel {{found within the}} Wastelands, {{regardless}} of whether they are a makeshift-weapon such as a lead pipe, or a gun, degrade over time the more they are used, and thus become less effective. For firearms, degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading, while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks. When too much damage is taken, the items breaks and cannot be used. To ensure weapons and apparel are working effectively, such items require constant maintenance and <b>repairs</b> which can be done in one of two ways. The first method is find certain vendors that repair items, though how much they can repair an item depends on their skill level, while the cost of the <b>repairs</b> depends upon the item itself. The second method is for players to find a second of the same item that needs <b>repairs</b> (or a comparable item), and salvaging parts from it for the repair, though how much they can do depends on their character's own skill level in <b>repairs.</b>|$|E

Although the G was back in service days after the hurricane, the tube needed permanent <b>repairs.</b> To allow for these <b>repairs,</b> G service ran only between Nassau Avenue and Church Avenue for twelve weekends between July and December 2013.

5|$|Formidable {{arrived at}} Alexandria the {{following}} day and disembarked her air group. She received emergency <b>repairs</b> before departing on 24 July for permanent <b>repairs</b> at Norfolk Naval Shipyard in the United States, 829 Squadron flying aboard with its Albacores to provide anti-submarine patrols during the voyage. She arrived on 25 August, and the <b>repairs</b> were completed in early December. After several days of sea trials, she sailed for Britain in company with Illustrious on 12 December. During the night of 15/16 December, Illustrious collided with Formidables stern, but neither ship was seriously damaged. She was repaired at Belfast from 21 December 1941 to 3 February 1942 and embarked the Albacores of 818 and 820 Squadrons and the Grumman Martlet fighters of 888 Squadron.|$|E
5|$|Henry's son, George Herbert, {{maintained}} the lease and his wife, Henrietta, constructed gravel-laid public {{walks around the}} castle, dug into the surrounding cliffs, and planted trees around the grounds to improve the castle's appearance. The castle walls and towers were given superficial <b>repairs</b> and tidied up, usually when parts threatened to collapse, and {{the interior of the}} inner bailey levelled, costing considerable sums of money.

5|$|In October, the {{hospital}} ship put in at Jacksonville for major <b>repairs,</b> before {{embarking on a}} final Mediterranean tour, arriving back in Charleston in April 1945.

40|$|Transcription-coupled <b>repair,</b> the {{targeted}} <b>repair</b> of the transcribed strands of active genes, is defective in bacteria, yeast, and human cells carrying mutations in mfd, RAD 26 and ERCC 6, respectively. Other factors probably are also uniquely involved in transcription-repair coupling. Recently, a defect {{was described in}} transcription-coupled <b>repair</b> for Escherichia coli mismatch <b>repair</b> mutants and human tumor cell lines with mutations in mismatch <b>repair</b> genes. We examined removal of UV-induced DNA damage in yeast strains mutated in mismatch <b>repair</b> genes {{in an effort to}} confirm a defect in transcription-coupled <b>repair</b> in this system. In addition, we determined the contribution of the mismatch <b>repair</b> gene MSH 2 to transcription-coupled <b>repair</b> in the absence of global genomic <b>repair</b> using rad 7 Δ mutants.

30|$|Surfacing {{techniques}} were employed for <b>repairing</b> tools and micro structure on maraging steel and structural steel (Grum and Slabe 2003).
