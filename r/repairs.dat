5|$|In 2005, the {{building}} {{was in need of}} some <b>repairs</b> due to neglect and damage from squirrels. The Lisbon Historical Society received a $5,000 grant from the Quinebaug Shetucket National Heritage Corridor to make <b>repairs</b> on the synagogue. <b>Repairs</b> would be done to repair the structure and the electrical wiring would be replaced for free by the students at the Norwich Regional Vocational Technical School.|$|E
5|$|In August 2016, the MBTA began a $6.1 million {{improvement}} {{project at}} the station.

5|$|Temporary <b>repairs</b> began immediately, {{but due to}} {{the limited}} drydock space in the port, <b>repairs</b> to the hull were not {{effected}} until 11 September. Dunkerque was refloated on 27 September and her propulsion system was returned to operational status. A major fire broke out on 5 December, however, which slowed down the repair effort. Repair work lasted for the entirety of 1941, and on 25 January 1942 another fire broke out. The temporary <b>repairs</b> were completed by 19 February, which permitted the ship to depart Mers-el-KÃ©bir, under heavy escort, bound for Toulon. She arrived the following day, and entered the large Vauban drydock for comprehensive <b>repairs.</b>|$|E

5|$|All {{weapons and}} apparel {{found within the}} Wastelands, {{regardless}} of whether they are a makeshift-weapon such as a lead pipe, or a gun, degrade over time the more they are used, and thus become less effective. For firearms, degrading into poor condition causes them to do less damage and possibly jam when reloading, while apparel that reduces damage becomes less protective as it gradually absorbs damage from attacks. When too much damage is taken, the items breaks and cannot be used. To ensure weapons and apparel are working effectively, such items require constant maintenance and <b>repairs</b> which can be done in one of two ways. The first method is find certain vendors that repair items, though how much they can repair an item depends on their skill level, while the cost of the <b>repairs</b> depends upon the item itself. The second method is for players to find a second of the same item that needs <b>repairs</b> (or a comparable item), and salvaging parts from it for the repair, though how much they can do depends on their character's own skill level in <b>repairs.</b>|$|E

During the night of 15/16 December, Illustrious collided with Formidables stern, but neither ship was seriously damaged.
