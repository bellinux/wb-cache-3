50|$|In denying {{involvement}} for the Bologna massacre, Mambro later insisted that, {{far from}} being a well supplied tool of hidden forces, Armed <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Nuclei</b> were regarded as 'snotty kids' by the established leaders of neo fascism, and the group never had access to explosives in the quantity that the Bologna bomb used. She also said that Armed <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Nuclei</b> had never deliberately targeted ordinary people. Fioravanti has said that the 1980 Bologna train station bombing was the work of Libya, but the Italian state had been reluctant to pursue that line of enquiry because of dependence on Libya's oil, and blamed neo-fascists.|$|R
50|$|Greek {{authorities}} {{speculate that}} <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Nuclei</b> {{may have been}} formed {{by members of the}} Revolutionary Popular Struggle (Επαναστατικός Λαϊκός Αγώνας; Epanastatikos Laikos Agonas) after that group dissolved in 1995. The language of the proclamations is not similar, and no evidence of a connection has been made public.|$|R
50|$|The PPL {{has strong}} {{roots in the}} {{movement}} for left regroupment and led the United Left alliance, which also included the Workers' Party (PT), the Socialist <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Nucleus</b> (NRS), the April 19 Indigenous Movement (M-19 Abril), and the Paraguayan Socialist Party (PSP). The Paraguayan Communist Party (PCP) withdrew from IU in 2003.|$|R
25|$|Cossiga {{was head}} of the {{government}} during the Bologna massacre, a terrorist bombing of the Bologna Central Station on the morning of 2 August 1980, which killed 85 people and wounded more than 200. The attack was carried out by the neo-fascist terrorist organization Nuclei Armati Rivoluzionari (Armed <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Nuclei),</b> which always denied any involvement; other theories have been proposed, especially in correlation with the strategy of tension.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Nuclei</b> was a far-left, anti-U.S., anti-NATO, and anti-European Union {{terrorist}} organization that conducted 13 bomb attacks in Athens between 1996 and 2000. The first attack for which RN took credit {{was a bomb}} attack on Greek Coast Guard installations in Piraeus on 11 May 1997, but it later acknowledged that two earlier attacks were carried out by RN members. Per its four proclamations, RN fought against the [...] "imperialist domination, exploitation, and oppression" [...] of Greece.|$|R
50|$|Fioravanti was a {{particular}} friend of Carminati and through him he was introduced to some Banda della Magliana members, including Massimo Sparti who became close to Cristiano. The anti hierarchical ethos precluded any formal leader though Fioravanti was the main organizer. He anticipated other cells would spring up spontaneously as those orientated to taking action irrespective of the consequences were drawn to emulate NAR. Fioravanti advocated small fast moving groups, as he intended the name Armed <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Nuclei</b> was to be adopted by largely independent cells.|$|R
50|$|Fioravanti {{was doing}} {{military}} service {{when the first}} killing occurred, it {{is believed to have}} been committed by either Cristiano or Alibrandi in September 1977; a leftist militant was shot dead. The victims of Armed <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Nuclei</b> that followed included several policemen (this was justified on the grounds of them being 'thugs and torturers'), comrades suspected of treachery, and investigating magistrates including Mario Amato. Fioravanti was 23, and Mambro 21, when warrants charged them with the Bologna massacre bombing of 2 August 1980, which killed 85 people Both Fioravanti and Mambro were convicted for the Bologna massacre.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Nuclei</b> (RN, Επαναστατικοί Πυρήνες; Epanastatiki Pyrines), {{also known}} as Revolutionary Cells, was a far-left {{paramilitary}} group in Greece. RN first appeared with a bomb attack on a Hellenic Coast Guard facility in Piraeus on 11 May 1997. In a proclamation sent to Eleftherotypia newspaper but never published, the group denounced workplace accidents in the Piraeus port ship construction zone and pledged to [...] "strike without mercy the people responsible for those deaths" [...] and that of anarchist Christoforos Marinos (found dead in his cabin aboard the ferryboat Pegasus, an apparent suicide, as port police closed in to arrest him on 23 July 1996).|$|R
50|$|This {{means that}} even from now, even the smaller new workers' {{parties and the}} most industrious young <b>revolutionary</b> <b>nuclei</b> should be applied two or three basic principles: never “liberate” the masses against their will but to respect their own moods, never allow their members to convert their {{knowledge}} and their previous fight in authoritarianism, arrogance and material benefits but always to come under the criticism of the masses and to live like them, not to divide the workers to “ours” and “not ours” but to unite them by an open and honest policy, even against the current and not telling everyone {{what he wants to}} hear, and above all never put any specific class interests over the general class interests and national interests over global interests of the working class.|$|R
50|$|In February 1981 police {{surprised}} {{members of}} Armed <b>Revolutionary</b> <b>Nuclei</b> {{as they were}} retrieving weapons cached in the Bacchiglione river {{on the outskirts of}} Padua. In the shooting that followed two policemen were killed and Fioravanti was badly wounded in the legs, he was arrested later the same day. His brother Cristiano was tracked down two months later through telegrams he had sent his girlfriend. He quickly collaborated to provide police with a thorough account of NAR activities, and was released under a new identity after a year. While she remained at large, Mambro played a traditional female role and tried to keep life serene for the NAR group of fugitives. She was arrested at a hospital in March 1982, after having been shot and critically wounded by police earlier that day while robbing a bank. A bystander was killed.|$|R
50|$|Shortly after Blanqui's death, Granger, {{together}} with Édouard Vaillant and others, founded the Central <b>Revolutionary</b> Committee, the <b>nucleus</b> of the Blanquist party. However, the Blanquist ideology {{at this time}} was an unstable combination of radical Jacobin republicanism, egalitarian socialism, anti-clericalism, ardent national chauvinism and a strong current of xenophobia and antisemitism. While {{this was not an}} uncommon mixture in French radical politics in the late nineteenth century, the course of events made it increasingly evident that elements of this ideological mixture were in conflict with each other. One faction of the Blanquist movement accented the socialist heritage of Blanqui and moved closer to Jules Guesde's Marxist party, rejecting antisemitism and, at least in theory, endorsing the internationalist principles of socialism. This was the course of Édouard Vaillant. Another faction moved increasingly in the direction of virulent nationalism and antisemitism. This was the course Granger took. Although his was the smaller faction, Granger, who had been personally close to Blanqui, considered himself the true standard bearer of Blanquism, and Vaillant a late interloper.|$|R
