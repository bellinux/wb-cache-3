5|$|Despite the relaxed atmosphere, {{relations}} between Bligh and his men, and particularly between Bligh and Christian, continued to deteriorate. Christian was routinely humiliated by the captain—often {{in front of}} the crew and the native Tahitians—for <b>real</b> <b>or</b> <b>imagined</b> slackness, while severe punishments were handed out to men whose carelessness had led to the loss or theft of equipment. Floggings, rarely administered during the outward voyage, now became a common occurrence; as a consequence, three men deserted the ship. They were quickly recaptured, and a search of their belongings revealed a list of names which included those of Christian and Heywood. Bligh confronted the pair and accused them of complicity in the desertion plot, which they strenuously denied; without further corroboration Bligh could not act against them.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{discourse}} currently linking geography and {{food in the}} contemporary marketplace. Through a qualitative analysis {{of the notion of}} authenticity as it is reimagined and redefined {{in the context of the}} recent rise of place-based food purchasing, I contend that place has become the marker of the authentic for consumers. Drawing on communication studies, food studies and cultural geography, I articulate how the players and processes behind this narrative of authenticity operate through one particular place and one particular food. I investigate the reification and commodification of foodstuffs at the local level through Marché Jean-Talon, Montreal's largest farmers market, and at the global level through the case of Greek feta cheese, recently awarded supranational designation of origin protection. In probing the tensions between 'local' and 'global' visions of alimentary authenticity, I question the ways in which this authenticity - and these places - may be <b>real</b> <b>or</b> <b>imagine...</b>|$|R

40|$|Objective: Dissatisfaction with <b>real</b> <b>or</b> <b>imagine</b> {{defect in}} {{physical}} appearance {{could lead to}} manifestation of negative self-image. This study thus presented an eight session account of management strategies for negative self-image. Method: The following psychological test instruments were administered to 200 participants- Negative Self-image Inventory (NSII); Fear of Negative Evaluation (FNE); Index of Self Esteem (ISE); Illness Behaviour Questionnaire (IBQ); Physical Self-Efficacy Scale (PSE); Social Maladjustment Scale (SMS) and Adjective Checklist (ACL). Those that manifested high negative self-image (30 participants), were assigned randomly into three groups of: 1 st treatment, 2 nd treatment (placebo) and control groups of 10 participants each, comprising 5 males and 5 females. Participants were managed with cognitive emotive and behavioural therapy and assertivess training method. Collectively, the treatment sessions lasted 8 weeks. Therapy was in group therapy format, which gave room for guidance, insight, acceptance, ventilation of feelings, instillation of hope, self-disclosure, and interaction. Result: The 1 st treatment group recorded significant reduction in negative self-image and its correlates- fear of negative evaluation and social maladjustment than 2 nd treatment and control groups.

50|$|After the war, the affronts (whether <b>real,</b> self-created, <b>or</b> <b>imagined)</b> of the Treaty of Versailles kept some {{of these}} nationalistic {{feelings}} running high, especially in Lenard, who in a small pamphlet had already complained {{at the beginning of}} the war about England. When on January 26, 1920, the young soldier Oltwig von Hirschfelde tried to assassinate German Finance minister Matthias Erzberger, Lenard sent him a telegram of congratulation. After the 1922 assassination of politician Walther Rathenau, the government ordered flags flown at half mast on the day of his funeral, but Lenard ignored the order at his institute in Heidelberg. Socialist students organized a demonstration against Lenard, who on the occasion was taken into protective custody by state prosecutor Hugo Marx (a Jew). This was not a sentiment unique to physics or physicists; this blend of nationalism and perceived affront from foreign and internal forces formed a key part of the popularity of the newly forming Nazi Party in the 1920s.|$|R

25|$|When {{each of the}} West {{children}} {{reached the}} age of seven, they were assigned numerous daily chores to perform within their household; all were very seldom allowed to socialise outside the household perimeters unless either Fred or Rose were present, and all had to follow strict guidelines imposed by their parents, with severe punishment—almost always physical—being the penalty for not conforming to the household rules. Each lived in fear of being the recipients of violence from their parents, and although this violence was occasionally inflicted by Fred, the vast majority of this violence was inflicted by Rose for any <b>real</b> <b>or</b> <b>imagined</b> breach of conformity. Occasionally, the violence was irrational, indiscreet or even inflicted for Rose's simple gratification (although Rose would always take great care not to mark the children's faces or hands in these assaults). Both Heather, then her younger brother Stephen (b. 1973), are known to have run away from home, although both children returned to Cromwell Street after several weeks of alternately sleeping rough or staying with friends. Both were beaten when they returned home. Between 1972 and 1992, the West children were admitted to the Accident and Emergency department of local hospitals 31 times; the injuries were explained as accidents and never reported to social services.|$|E
25|$|In a 1939 essay titled When Fiction Lives in Fiction, Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges {{described}} Flann O'Brien's masterpiece as follows, I have enumerated many verbal labyrinths, {{but none}} so complex {{as the recent}} book by Flann O'Brien, At Swim-Two-Birds. A student in Dublin writes a novel about the proprietor of a Dublin public house, who writes a novel about the habitués of his pub (among them, the student), who in their turn write novels in which proprietor and student figure along with other writers about other novelists. The book consists of the extremely diverse manuscripts of these <b>real</b> <b>or</b> <b>imagined</b> persons, copiously annotated by the student. At Swim-Two-Birds {{is not only a}} labyrinth; it is a discussion of the many ways to conceive of the Irish novel and a repertory of exercises in prose and verse which illustrate or parody all the styles of Ireland. The magisterial influence of Joyce (also an architect of labyrinths, also a literary Proteus) is undeniable, but not disproportionate in this manifold book. Arthur Schopenhauer wrote that dreaming and wakefulness are the pages of a single book, and that to read them in order is to live, and to leaf through them at random, is to dream. Paintings within paintings and books that branch into other books help us sense this oneness.|$|E

On 10 March the Convention created a revolutionary Tribunal, located in the Palace of Justice. Verdicts of the Tribunal could not be appealed, and sentences were to be carried out immediately. Marie Antoinette was beheaded on 16 October 1793, and Jean Sylvain Bailly, the first elected mayor of Paris, was executed on 12 November 1793.

25|$|Relational ties principle: The fusion {{approach}} {{assumes that}} strongly fused persons care {{not only about}} their collective ties to the group (as an abstract entity), but also their relationships (<b>real</b> <b>or</b> <b>imagined)</b> {{with other members of}} the group. Identity Fusion Theory posits that strongly fused individuals feel kin-like bonds with other group members, even ones with whom they may have had little or no contact. Several studies have garnered empirical support for the relational ties principle. Using several interpersonal variations of the classic trolley dilemma, individuals who were strongly fused with their country endorsed saving fellow countrymen by jumping to their deaths in front of a speeding trolley. Moreover, fused participants endorsed pushing aside a fellow countryman who was poised to jump to his death to ultimately benefit the group, and instead jumping themselves. This research suggests that highly fused persons are so strongly aligned with their fellow group members that they would prefer that they themselves die rather than a fellow group member. Additionally, when highly fused individuals learn that other group members might be killed in a hypothetical trolley dilemma, they demonstrate emotional reactions similar to how people react when a family member is in distress. These emotional reactions predicted subsequent endorsements of self-sacrifice for the group. In comparison, the social identity approach assumes that, when the social identity is salient, individuals view their fellow group members as mere interchangeable exemplars of the group (i.e. they evaluate other group members based on their “collective ties” toward the group).|$|E

The Chewa are an immigrant ethnic group from Malawi and are a matrilineal entity who distinctly use the Gule Wamkulu (â€˜big or great danceâ€™) institution to initiate their members into an exalted status of adulthood as well as for entertainment or leisure purposes. The paper is anchored in the assertion that identities are either <b>real,</b> constructed <b>or</b> <b>imagined</b> from a plethora of variables. Thus, it basically argues that these dances are rich traditions that have gone a long way in {{the construction}}, reconstruction or imagination of the Chewa identity and in carving a niche for the migrants on the Zimbabwean landscape since the pre-colonial times to the present. The dances have acted as a distinct variable in identity articulation against other popular concepts like race, class, religion, linguistic as well as ethnic characteristics and stereotypes. In other words, the rites have over the years been the most conspicuous identity marker upon which the Chewa identity has been reconstructed <b>or</b> <b>imagined.</b> Despite such vitality and uniqueness, people in general; have tended to misrepresent these dances, which together with their xenophobic tendencies has in the process greatly distorted the image of the traditions and ultimately misconstrued and prejudiced the identity of Chewa people.

It revolves around {{a variety of}} interconnected themes, with the quest and the scapegoat, in both its social and its religious dimension, being predominant preoccupations. Through the escape and gradual alienation of the book’s main character fleeing from a structure that {{is presented as a}} sort of confinement, an individual is shown to be the putative victim of a persecuting order. This is complicated further by the underlying trauma of a <b>real</b> - <b>or</b> <b>imagined</b> - social collapse whose details unfold {{in the course of the}} narrator’s voyage. Exposure outside the limits of a familiar world is also detrimental to the composure of both self and reality which the narrator/author must reestablish.

Reinventing a [...] "personal reality", relating to others and seeking a metaphysically firm foundation are major concerns leading to existential angst and a growing sense of paranoia.

By asking participants to localise multiple landmarks on their occluded hand, perceptual maps of hand size and shape can be constructed and compared to actual hand structure. These maps are different from the actual size and shape of the occluded hand, revealing underestimation of finger length and overestimation of hand width. Here we tested whether the same distorted body model underlies proprioceptive imagery (i. e. imagining the hand at a specific location, and in a different posture than it actually is). In Experiment 1, participants placed their left hand under an occluding board (<b>real</b> condition) <b>or</b> <b>imagined</b> their left hand under the board (imagined condition). Highly similar distortions were found in both conditions. Furthermore, results across the two conditions were strongly correlated.

In both imagined conditions, participants were asked to imagine their left hand lying flat, with palm down, under the occluding board. A similar pattern of distortions was found in all three conditions. These results suggest that both proprioception and proprioceptive imagery reply on a common stored model of the body's metric properties...|$|R
