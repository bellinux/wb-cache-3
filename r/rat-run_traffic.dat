One of the most important studies was a demonstration project in two dutch cities; eindhoven and rijswijk Rigorous measures were taken for traffic restraint, to keep away the <b>rat-run</b> <b>traffic</b> in residential areas and to improve the type of highway was reconstructed for its typical function. The measures for the main roads were taken in order to provide better traffic flow with a priority for public transport. In addition, measures were taken to improve the safety of different road users e. g. cycle tracks, pedestrian crossings, speed humps, light controlled junctions etc. The report gives an overview of the measures and their effects on traffic safety...|$|E
40|$|By way of an {{experiment}} rigorous measures were taken to prevent <b>rat-run</b> <b>traffic</b> in residential areas and to improve the safety {{and quality of life}} in two dutch cities, eindhoven and Rijswijk. The road network was divided into main traffic roads, major access roads and streets for living. Thereafter each road was reconstructed according to its typical function. The main traffic roads are intended to provide a good flow in high speed traffic with a priority for public transport. In addition, measures were taken to improve the safety for other road users. For the residential streets three options were drawn up. Option one: one way traffic and a single speed hump; option two; one way traffic with various speed limiting provisions and option three: the woonerf concept. All these measures have the aim of giving slow traffic a more or less equal position with respect to high speed traffic. The effects of these measures on traffic safety are studied and the results are presented...|$|E
