25|$|At {{the end of}} the war, German {{engineers}} had proposed a new large caliber anti-tank gun which used less propellant than a rocket or <b>recoilless</b> <b>weapon,</b> yet fired similar compact hollow charge shells. German forces subsequently fielded the 8 cm PAW 600, which was an extremely lightweight, low pressure weapon still able to fire the same ammunition types as higher velocity anti-tank guns. In the 1950s, this idea was revived by a Belgian firm, Mecar, which subsequently improved on the concept and developed a low pressure, smoothbore 90mm anti-tank gun. Because of its low recoil forces and light construction, the gun was particularly useful for being mounted on armored cars or small gun carriages. Its design inspired the lightly rifled French DEFA D921 anti-tank gun, which fired fin-stabilized shells and was available on a towed carriage or as a vehicle mount. It was later mated to the AML-90 and EBR series of French armored cars. The Soviet Union also adopted a similar design at around the same time, the 100mm T-12 anti-tank gun, which was smoothbore and fired fin-stabilized shells. Switzerland developed a postwar 90mm anti-tank gun of its own, the Pak 50/57, firing shells with an even lower velocity than the Mecar or DEFA guns. All these weapons could only use HEAT shells for armor-piercing purposes, save for the T-12, which utilized APDS rounds. France did introduce an APFSDS shell for the DEFA D921 {{at some point in the}} 1980s. The last country known to have produced a dedicated anti-tank gun was the People's Republic of China, in 1988. The Chinese gun was known as the Norinco Type 86 and was probably manufactured as a replacement for the ageing Soviet-sourced T-12.|$|E

50|$|The AT4 may be {{considered}} a disposable, low-cost alternative to a Carl Gustav recoilless rifle. The AT4 took many of its design features from the Carl Gustav, which operates {{on the principle of}} a <b>recoilless</b> <b>weapon,</b> where the forward inertia of the projectile is balanced by the inertia of propellant gases ejecting {{from the rear of the}} barrel. But unlike the Carl Gustav, which uses a heavier and more expensive steel tube with rifling, the disposable AT4 design greatly reduces manufacturing costs by using a reinforced smoothbore fiberglass outer tube. In a <b>recoilless</b> <b>weapon,</b> the barrel does not need to contend with the extreme pressures found in traditional guns and can thus be made very lightweight. This fact, combined with the almost complete lack of recoil, means that relatively large projectiles (comparable to those found in mortars and artillery systems) can be utilised, which would otherwise be impossible in a man-portable weapon.|$|E
5000|$|The 95 S 58-61 {{is a heavy}} {{recoilless}} {{anti-tank weapon}} used by the Finnish Army. It is {{also referred to as}} raskas sinko (heavy recoilless rifle), or colloquially as Musti ("Blackie"). The weapon was developed in 1958 and it was given a new wheel-equipped carriage in 1961. The name of the weapon means [...] "95 mm, Sinko, model 1958/1961", where sinko is the Finnish word for <b>recoilless</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|E
50|$|The United States Army {{developed}} a lightweight antitank weapon (LAW) {{in the middle}} 1950s. By 1961, the M72 LAW was in use. It is a shoulder-fired, disposable rocket launcher with HEAT warhead. It is a <b>recoilless</b> <b>weapon,</b> which is easy to use, and effective against armored vehicles. It {{was used in the}} Vietnam War. It uses a fin-stabilized rocket. In response to the threat of thicker armor, this weapon was replaced by the AT4 recoilless rifle, a larger & non-collapsible - albeit still single-shot weapon.|$|E
5000|$|Development of <b>recoilless</b> <b>weapons</b> by Rheinmetall {{began in}} 1937 {{in an effort}} to provide {{airborne}} troops with heavy support weapons that could be dropped by parachute. Both Krupp and Rheinmetall competed for production contracts in a contest that was won by the latter. Initially produced under the designation of LG 1, this was soon changed to LG 40 to match the then current [...] "year of origin" [...] naming system.|$|R
50|$|This gun used HE shells {{from the}} 7.5 cm Gebirgsgeschütz (Mountain Gun) 36 and the {{anti-tank}} {{shell of the}} 7.5 cm Feldkanone 16, neuer Art (Field Cannon, New Model). This meant that its ammunition could not be optimized {{to benefit from the}} peculiar ballistic characteristics of <b>recoilless</b> <b>weapons.</b> On the other hand, it saved significant research time and effort and meant that existing production lines and stocks of shells could be used at a considerable saving.|$|R
50|$|The German Bundesamt für Wehrtechnik und Beschaffung (BWB) {{required}} a new recoilless autocannon, therefore {{the development of}} the RMK 30 started in 1993. Unlike former <b>recoilless</b> <b>weapons</b> it is capable of firing salvos or in fully automatic mode without producing recoil. It is a three-chamber revolver cannon; the revolver and firing mechanism are driven by an electric motor, allowing variable rates of fire of up to 300 rounds/min. A fraction of the propellant gases is ejected {{to the rear of the}} cannon, compensating for the recoil and allowing lightweight and less rigid mounts.|$|R
5000|$|The F.E.6 was {{a larger}} version of their F.E.3. The {{aircraft}} {{was driven by}} a [...] Austro-Daimler/Beardmore engine, which drove a four-bladed propeller. The tail unit was on a single steel boom which projected aft through the propeller shaft. The biplane had ailerons on both upper and lower wings, with no wing stagger, while landing gear consisted of mainwheels on oleo struts with an auxiliary nosewheel. It was possibly armed with a 6-pound Davis <b>recoilless</b> <b>weapon,</b> or the Coventry Ordnance Works COW 37 mm gun. However, the aircraft was damaged upon landing during its first flight, and was subsequently not rebuilt.|$|E
50|$|The Miniman (Swedish {{military}} designation Pansarskott m/68, abbreviated Pskott m/68) is {{a disposable}} single-shot 74-mm unguided anti-tank smooth bore <b>recoilless</b> <b>weapon,</b> designed in Sweden by Försvarets Fabriksverk (FFV) and became operational in 1968. The Miniman is delivered with the HEAT projectile pre-loaded launch tube. In appearance, the Miniman {{is similar to}} a single section tube US M72 LAW and French SARPAC of the same era. In 1986 the Swedish Army adopted the FFV AT4, designated the Pansarskott m/86, to replace the Miniman. FFV engineers adopted the rugged but simple firing and safety mechanism of the Miniman for the AT4. The Miniman uses a unique version of the high-low chamber launch system that results in no recoil.|$|E
5000|$|The AT4 {{requires}} little {{training and}} is quite simple to use, making it suitable for general issue. However, {{as the cost}} of each launcher makes regular live-fire training very expensive, practice versions exist that are identical in operation but fire reloadable 9×19mm or 20mm tracer ammunition. Both practice cartridges are unique to their respective weapons, with their trajectory matched to that of the live round. The 20mm version also has a <b>recoilless</b> <b>weapon</b> effect with the same high noise and back blast as the AT4 firing and is favoured by the Swedish army because of the added realism of the back blast as compared to the [...] "plonk" [...] sound of the 9mm round (similar to the sound of a finger tapping on an empty can).|$|E

5000|$|Today, one {{of several}} {{remaining}} front-line recoilless rifles in the armies of industrialized nations is the famous Carl Gustav recoilless rifle, an 84 mm man-portable anti-tank weapon. First introduced in 1946, it is still in widespread use throughout the world today, and has even been re-introduced into the US Marine Corps as an anti-bunker weapon. The 84 mm (Carl Gustav recoilless rifle) can be used, along with 66 mm (also known as M72 LAW) and LAW 80 for mouse-holing whilst fighting in built-up areas (FIBUA). This is where impromptu [...] "doors" [...] are added to a building to gain entry, hopefully avoiding the prepared defences of the occupiers. Many nations also use a weapon related to the Carl Gustav, the one-shot AT-4 <b>recoilless</b> <b>weapon.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In 1939, he {{was again}} joined by Nevil Shute in the {{development}} of an early air-launched gliding torpedo, the Toraplane, and the Doravane glide bomb. Despite much work and many trials the Toraplane could not be launched with repeatable accuracy and was finally abandoned in 1942.Among other military weapons, he was the inventor of the High Explosive Squash Head (HESH) shell and a British recoilless rifle, the [...] "Burney gun". He demonstrated the advantages of the latter by constructing a recoilless shotgun with a [...] bore which he was able to shoot with no discomfort from the recoil. During World War II, he led development of a <b>recoilless</b> <b>weapon</b> for the British Army which entered service as Ordnance, RCL, 3.45 in, but too late to see service during the war.|$|E
50|$|The Armbrust is a <b>recoilless</b> <b>weapon,</b> {{and is one}} of the few {{weapons of}} this kind that may safely be fired in an {{enclosed}} space. The propellant charge is placed between two pistons with the projectile in front of one and a mass of shredded plastic in the rear. Unlike most recoilless weapons, it is a true counter-shot weapon, as the mass of the projectile is equal to the mass of the counterweight and they are ejected from the barrel at the same initial velocity. When the weapon is fired, the propellant expands, pushing the two pistons out. The projectile is forced out of the front and the plastic out of the back. The plastic disperses on leaving the back of the barrel, and is quickly stopped by air resistance. The pistons jam at either end of the barrel, locking the hot gases inside. Its warhead can penetrate up to 300 mm of armoured steel.|$|E
5000|$|In the Soviet Union, the {{development}} of <b>recoilless</b> <b>weapons</b> ("Dinamo-Reaktivnaya Pushka" [...] (DRP), roughly [...] "dynamic reaction cannon") began in 1923. In the 1930s, {{many different types of}} weapons were built and tested with configurations ranging from 37 mm to 305 mm. Some of the smaller examples were tested in aircraft (Grigorovich I-Z and Tupolev I-12) and saw some limited production and service, but development was abandoned around 1938. The best-known of these early recoilless rifles was the Model 1935 76 mm DRP designed by Leonid Kurchevsky. A small number of these mounted on trucks saw combat in the Winter War. Two were captured by the Finns and tested; one example was given to the Germans in 1940.|$|R

2500|$|When the {{propellant}} is ignited, {{the higher}} pressure gases are bled out through vents (or ports) at reduced pressure {{to a much}} larger low pressure chamber to push the projectile forward. With the High-Low System a weapon can be designed with reduced or negligible recoil. [...] The High-Low System also allows {{the weight of the}} weapon and its ammunition to be significantly reduced. Manufacturing cost and production time are drastically lower than for standard cannon or other small-arm weapon systems firing a projectile of the same size and weight. It has a far more efficient use of the propellant, unlike earlier <b>recoilless</b> <b>weapons,</b> where most of the propellant is expended {{to the rear of the}} weapon to counter the recoil of the projectile being fired.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Kromuskit", {{as the new}} 57 mm {{weapon was}} called (a word play on the engineers' family names) was officially {{designated}} the T15 and first tested in November 1943. The tests proved that the Infantry Section's concept for a <b>recoilless</b> <b>weapon</b> was superior to the Artillery Section's concept {{and the development of}} the 105 mm weapon was canceled. [...] In late 1944, the T15 was redesignated the M18 57 mm Recoilless. The cannon and 57 mm ammunition were placed in mass production. Four types of ammunition were initially produced: an anti-tank HEAT round (T20E2 / M307), an HE round (T22 / M306), a Smoke (White Phosphorus) [...] "bursting smoke" [...] round (T23 / M308), and a Training Practice round. By early 1945, over 2,000 M18 recoilless rifles and 800,000 rounds of ammunition were on order. After World War II ended, a canister round (T25E5) with a range of 175 meters was also produced.|$|E
50|$|In 1943, a {{specification}} {{was issued}} for a lightweight anti-tank gun that used less propellant than a rocket or <b>recoilless</b> <b>weapon,</b> yet was sufficiently accurate {{to hit a}} 1-meter square target at a range of 750 meters. Rheinmetall-Borsig proposed a design to meet this requirement using the new high-low pressure ballistic principle, {{also known as the}} Hoch-Niederdruck system. In this system, high pressure caused by the combustion of the propellant was confined to the breech section, which was relatively heavy, and did not act directly on the projectile. The pressure was allowed to bleed gradually into the barrel at a controlled rate and lower pressure to propel the projectile. Thus the barrel could be exceptionally light for a weapon that still had the advantages that accrue from a high pressure gun. The carriage too could be very light, although the initial prototype carriages proved to be too light and had to be redesigned. The resulting PAW 600 (later redesignated 8H63) gun weighed about 600 kg, less than half that of the 7,5 cm PaK 40, while having comparable armor penetration out to its full effective anti-tank range of 750 meters.|$|E
