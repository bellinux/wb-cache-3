The film director is unknown, but it may have been Barry O'Neil. Film historian Q. David Bowers does not attribute a cameraman for this production, but at least two possible candidates exist. Blair Smith was the first cameraman of the Thanhouser company, but he was soon joined by Carl Louis Gregory who had years of experience as a still and motion picture photographer. The role of the cameraman was uncredited in 1910 productions. Cast in the starring role is Marie Eline as the little girl.

40|$|A gravidade do tema do desaparecimento de crianças e de adolescentes exige que o mesmo seja trabalhado de forma multidisciplinar uma vez que o índice anual de ocorrências no Brasil é de 40. 000 casos/ano e 9000 casos no Estado de São Paulo. É imprescindível a atenção governamental para políticas públicas, a atenção acadêmica para o desenvolvimento de pesquisas e tecnologia, e, atenção clínica para o desenvolvimento de modelos de atendimento psicológico às famílias e aos desaparecidos quando encontrados. O objetivo geral desse trabalho foi descrever a criação de uma metodologia de prática psicológica oferecida aos {{familiar}}es de crianças e de adolescentes desaparecidos e aos desaparecidos posteriormente encontrados que é executada em uma delegacia de polícia especializada na investigação de pessoas desaparecidas. Tal prática foi desenvolvida dentro de um projeto multidisciplinar que agrega diferentes metodologias para busca e identificação de desaparecidos menores de 18 anos. Na pesquisa foram descritas as etapas de planejamento desse projeto enfatizando a inserção e os efeitos da psicologia e da psicanálise em seu escopo multidisciplinar. O modelo clínico incluiu pelo menos 04 (quatro) entrevistas (uma semi-aberta e três abertas) e se utilizou o dispositivo analítico para levantar hipóteses sobre as prováveis razões para a ocorrência dos desaparecimentos configurando, portanto, um exemplo de psicanálise aplicada. Nas entrevistas semi-abertas foram utilizados questionários cujas respostas foram armazenadas em Banco de Dados. Os entrevistados assinaram Termo de Consentimento Pós-esclarecido. Os casos foram supervisionados e encaminhados para a rede psicossocial da cidade de São Paulo. A partir do referencial psicanalítico de orientação lacaniana foi realizada uma análise clínico-qualitativa de 16 casos-piloto atendidos pela pesquisadora e alguns casos por ela supervisionados. O mesmo referencial foi utilizado na discussão das questões multidisciplinares e dos efeitos da prática clínica no ambiente da delegacia. Os desaparecimentos analisados foram fugas de casa ocorridas principalmente a partir da entrada da puberdade e de forma repetida. Nas famílias foi observado principalmente, histórico de violência doméstica, de uso de drogas ilícitas, de alcoolismo, de prática de atos infracionais e de infrações penais. Os significantes mais utilizados pelos familiares para representar o desaparecido foram filho incômodo ou filho problema. A fuga de casa foi considerada um sintoma do desaparecido, sinalizando modos de gozo nas repetições. Foi possível observar aspectos da singularidade dos desaparecidos encontrados e entrevistados, pois alguns se identificaram com o lugar simbólico destinado pelo grupo familiar e utilizaram as fugas para manter essa posição. Outros lançaram mão da fuga justamente para ir contra o desejo dos pais e tentar encontrar um caminho pessoal. E, em alguns casos, a fuga de casa configurou uma saída para a sobrevivência psíquica da criança ou do adolescente. A clínica executada em uma delegacia marcou a diferença entre a escuta policial, de cunho investigatório, e a escuta analítica voltada ao particular de cada caso e às suas implicações (ou não) com o desaparecimento, possibilitando a abertura de um novo campo de trabalho ao psicólogoThe {{seriousness of}} the issue of missing children and adolescents requires an interdisciplinary approach to intervention. The need for such broad-based action is necessitated by the large number of children that go missing each year, i. e., approximately 40, 000 cases per year in Brazil and an annual average of at least 9, 000 cases in the state of Sao Paulo. The sheer number of cases makes obvious the need for increased public policy attention as well as careful research by the academic community into the causes and prevention of this phenomenon. More particularly, in depth psychological attention must be given to understanding the complex psychological factors that contribute to the problem. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe the creation of a methodology of psychological practice offered to families of missing and found children. The psychological practice described herein operated out of a police station specializing in the investigation of missing persons of all ages. This practice was developed within a multidisciplinary project that combines different methods to search for and identify missing children under the age of 18 years. This practice was developed within a multidisciplinary project that combines different methods to search for and identify missing children and youth. In the research phase of this effort, we described the projects planning stages with emphasis on the integration and the effects of psychology and psychoanalysis in its multidisciplinary scope. The clinical model of intervention included at least four interviews (a half-open and three open) and the analytical device used to raise hypotheses about the probable reasons into the occurrence and reoccurrence of missing and disappeared children. The approach used was that of applied psychoanalysis. Using semi-open questionnaires we sought answers related to questions that made up part of our comprehensive database relating to disappearances. All respondents in the project signed a written Consent Form. The cases were supervised and directed to the psychosocial network in São Paulo. From the psychoanalysis of the Lacanian orientation, a clinical-qualitative analysis of 16 cases treated by the researcher was undertaken. The same reference was used in the discussion of disciplinary issues as well as with respect to the effects of clinical practice in the environment of the police station. Repeated running away from home was the most common factor contributing to the disappearance of pre- and post-pubescent youth. The disappearances, though, also were associated with family histories of domestic violence, use of illicit drugs, alcoholism, the practice of illegal acts, and criminal offenses. The signifier most used by adult caregivers in describing their <b>runaway</b> <b>child</b> or teenager, however, was ẗroublesome or problematic. Leaving home was considered a symptom of child disappearance and, often, was associated with considerable pleasure for the child. The analysis also made it possible to observe aspects of the uniqueness of the disappeared and many of these children identified themselves with the symbolic place determined by their family group. Others leaving home wanted simply to go against the wishes of parents and to try to find a personal path. And in some cases, leaving home set up a way out of psychic survival of the child or adolescent, especially in cases of domestic violence. The use of a police station as setting for clinical intervention with children and youth marked the difference between what the policeman can listen to about the cases and what the psychologist can listen to. The latters ability to use analytical listening focused on the particular features of each case and the implications (or not) with the disappearances, allowing the opening of a new field of work psychologis...|$|E
