5|$|A {{high risk}} day {{indicates}} a considerable likelihood of significant to extreme severe weather, generally a major tornado outbreak or (much less often) an extreme derecho event. On these days, the potential exists for extremely severe and life-threatening weather, including widespread strong or violent tornadoes – {{some of which}} may be on the ground for a half-hour or longer – and/or very destructive straight-line winds (hail cannot verify or produce a high <b>risk</b> <b>on</b> its own, although such a day usually involves a threat for widespread very large and damaging hail as well). Many of the most prolific severe weather days were high risk days. Such days are rare; a high risk is typically issued (at the most) only a few times each year (see List of Storm Prediction Center high risk days). High risk areas are usually surrounded by a larger moderate risk area, where uncertainty is greater or the threat is somewhat lower.|$|E

5|$|A {{number of}} risk scores exist to predict {{bleeding}} in people using warfarin and similar anticoagulants. A commonly used score (HAS-BLED) includes known predictors of warfarin-related bleeding: uncontrolled {{high blood pressure}} (H), abnormal kidney function (A), previous stroke (S), known previous bleeding condition (B), previous labile INR when on anticoagulation (L), elderly as defined by age over 65 (E), and drugs associated with bleeding (e.g. aspirin) or alcohol misuse (D). While their use is recommended in clinical practice guidelines, they are only moderately effective in predicting bleeding risk and do not perform well in predicting hemorrhagic stroke. Bleeding risk may be increased in people on hemodialysis. Another score used to assess bleeding <b>risk</b> <b>on</b> anticoagulation, specifically Warfarin or Coumadin, is the ATRIA score, which uses a weighted additive scale of clinical findings to determine bleeding risk stratification. The risks of bleeding are increased further when warfarin is combined with antiplatelet drugs such as clopidogrel, aspirin, or nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs.|$|E

On the Dieppe to Paris line he intercepted a locomotive which exploded after being hit. He attacked another but struck some trees which damaged the underside of the fuselage. Braham maintained control and flew home. It was not unusual for him to return with strange defections caused by collisions with objects.

25|$|There {{has been}} {{considerable}} {{interest in the}} faulty air temperature probe (the total air temperature sensor, located {{on the front of}} the aircraft near the cockpit) that initially caused the pilot to turn the plane back for maintenance before the second takeoff attempt. The mechanic simply deactivated the probe because the aircraft's Minimum Equipment List allowed it to be left inoperative. On 22 August investigators interviewed the mechanic, who defended his action by saying that it had nothing to do with the crash. Spanair has supported the mechanic's view that deactivation of the probe is an accepted procedure. On 1 September a report, quoting Spanair, stated that the problem detected on the first takeoff attempt was overheating caused by a temperature gauge's de-icing system, rather than a dysfunction of the temperature gauge itself, and that since icing was not a <b>risk</b> <b>on</b> that flight, the de-icing system had been deactivated by the mechanic with captain's approval.|$|E

25|$|Derivative {{contracts}} are leveraged positions whose value is volatile. They are usually more volatile than their underlying asset. This {{can lead to}} credit risk, in particular counterparty risk: {{a situation in which}} one party to a trade loses such a large sum of money that it is unable to honor its settlement obligation. In a safe trading environment, the parties to a trade need to be assured that the counterparties will honor the trade, no matter how the market has moved. This requirement can lead to complex arrangements like credit assessments and the setting of trading limits for each counterparty, thus removing many of the advantages of a centralised trading facility. To prevent this, a clearing house interposes itself as a counterparty to every trade, in order to extend a guarantee that the trade will be settled as originally intended. This action is called novation. As a result, trading firms take no <b>risk</b> <b>on</b> the actual counterparty to the trade, but instead the risk falls on the clearing corporation performing a service called central counterparty clearing. The clearing corporation is able to take on this risk by adopting an efficient margining process.|$|E

25|$|In 2009–10 {{injuries}} resurfaced. Three {{games into}} the season, Souray suffered a concussion after Calgary Flames captain Jarome Iginla checked {{him into the}} boards head-first on October 8, 2009. The injury, coupled with a hand injury (and subsequent infection) sustained when Souray fought Iginla during a rematch of the teams, limited him to just 37 games, with Souray scoring just four goals and 13 points in the campaign. During the 2010 off-season, citing irreconcilable differences with Oiler management due to their handling of his various ailments, Souray requested a trade out of Edmonton. The Oilers responded angrily, and a nasty media exchange followed, with the team ultimately placing Souray on waivers {{in the hope that}} he would be claimed by another NHL team so that Edmonton would no longer be on the hook for the remainder of his contract. However, due to his high salary and previous year's injuries, few NHL teams were willing to take such a large financial <b>risk</b> <b>on</b> a player who might not be 100% healthy, talented as he may be. Souray cleared waivers without being claimed, and was told by management not to attend the Oilers' training camp. On October 6, 2010, Souray was assigned to the American Hockey League (AHL), being loaned to the Washington Capitals' minor league affiliate, the Hershey Bears. Souray accepted his demotion to the minors and posted a solid AHL season, as he battled and slowly recovered from his nagging injuries. Leading up to the NHL trade deadline, the Oilers once again placed Souray on waivers in a second attempt to unload his salary. However, NHL teams still had the same concerns about Souray's high salary and injury risk, so he cleared waivers a second time and remained under contract to Edmonton as relations between Souray and the Edmonton camp remained testy at best. Finally, in the summer of 2011, Edmonton bought-out the fifth and final year of Souray's contract. This allowed Souray to become a free agent and again pursue playing at the NHL level with another team.|$|E
