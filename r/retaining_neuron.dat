They can give information on steady and resting membrane voltage, postsynaptic potentials, and spikes (action potentials) from both the axon and cell body. Limitations of intracellular recording are that one can only record from cell bodies of, usually, the largest cells. There is little information obtained on neural information transfer from further dendrites or axons. Recordings from small neurons are quite difficult and usually must be supported with extracellular single unit recordings.|$|R
40|$|Dropout {{is a very}} {{effective}} way of regularizing neural networks. Stochastically "dropping out" units with a certain probability discourages over-specific co-adaptations of feature detectors, preventing overfitting and improving network generalization. Besides, Dropout {{can be interpreted as}} an approximate model aggregation technique, where an exponential number of smaller networks are averaged {{in order to get a}} more powerful ensemble. In this paper, we show that using a fixed dropout probability during training is a suboptimal choice. We thus propose a time scheduling for the probability of <b>retaining</b> <b>neurons</b> in the network. This induces an adaptive regularization scheme that smoothly increases the difficulty of the optimization problem. This idea of "starting easy" and adaptively increasing the difficulty of the learning problem has its roots in curriculum learning and allows one to train better models. Indeed, we prove that our optimization strategy implements a very general curriculum scheme, by gradually adding noise to both the input and intermediate feature representations within the network architecture. Experiments on seven image classification datasets and different network architectures show that our method, named Curriculum Dropout, frequently yields to better generalization and, at worst, performs just as well as the standard Dropout method.

We generated a motorneuron-specific GCaMP 6 f mouse line and employed two-photon imaging to monitor the activity of lumbar motorneurons. We show that the central pattern generator neural network coordinately drives rhythmic columnar-specific motorneuron bursts at distinct phases of the locomotor cycle. Using multiple genetic strategies to perturb the subtype identity and orderly position of motorneurons, we found that <b>neurons</b> <b>retained</b> their rhythmic activity—but cell position was decoupled from the normal phasing pattern underlying flexion and extension.

Parallel fiber synapses can trigger local dendritic calcium spikes, but {{whether and how}} this calcium signal leads to plastic changes that decode the parallel fiber input organization is unknown. By combining voltage and calcium imaging, we show that calcium signals, elicited by parallel fiber stimulation and mediated by voltage-gated calcium channels, increase non-linearly during high-frequency bursts of electrically constant calcium spikes, because they locally and transiently saturate the endogenous buffer. We demonstrate that these non-linear calcium signals, independently of NMDA or metabotropic glutamate receptor activation, can induce parallel fiber long-term potentiation. Two-photon imaging in coronal slices revealed that calcium signals inducing long-term potentiation can be observed by stimulating either the parallel fiber or the ascending fiber pathway. We propose that local dendritic calcium spikes, evoked by synaptic potentials, provide a unique mechanism to spatially decode parallel fiber signals into cerebellar circuitry changes...|$|R

Larval dendrites of C 4 da neurons are first severed from the soma and subsequently degraded during metamorphosis. This process is controlled by both intracellular and extracellular mechanisms: The ecdysone pathway and ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS) are cell-intrinsic signals that initiate dendrite breakage, and extracellular matrix metalloproteases are required to degrade the severed dendrites. Surprisingly, C 4 da <b>neurons</b> <b>retain</b> their axonal projections during concurrent dendrite degradation, despite activated ecdysone and UPS pathways.

Before the induction of stroke, dendritic arbors were relatively stable over several weeks. However, after stroke, apical dendritic arbor remodeling increased significantly (dendritic tip growth and retraction), particularly within the first 2 weeks after stroke.

Both in vivo and in vitro studies have demonstrated that inflammatory cytokine responses to immune challenges contribute to neuronal death during neurodegeneration. In order to investigate the role of glial cells in this phenomenon, we developed a modified method to remove the non-neuronal cells in primary cultures of E 16. 5 mouse cortex. We modified previously reported methods as we found that a brief treatment with the thymidine analog, 5 -fluorodeoxyuridine (FdU), is sufficient to substantially deplete dividing non-neuro-nal cells in primary cultures. Cell cycle and glial markers confirm the loss of ~ 99 % of all microglia, astrocytes and oligodendrocyte precursor cells (OPCs). More importantly, under this milder treatment, the neurons suffered neither cell loss nor any morphological defects up to 2. 5 weeks later; both pre- and post-synaptic markers were <b>retained.</b> Further, <b>neurons</b> in FdU-treated cultures remained responsive to excitotoxicity induced by glutamate applica-tion.

Studies have demonstrated recently that these neurotrophic factors not only maintain survival of auditory neurons, but that these surviving <b>neurons</b> <b>retain</b> functionality. It remains to be determined, however, if a single administration of a neurotrophic factor is sufficient to maintain auditory neuron survival after loss of hair cells, or if sustained delivery is required. This study investigated the longevity of the survival effects of BDNF on auditory neurons in deafened guinea pigs. Briefly, the left cochleae of deafened guinea pigs were infused with BDNF for 28 days via a mini-osmotic pump, and neuronal survival was analyzed at various stages after the completion of treatment. BDNF treatment prevented the degeneration of auditory neurons that normally is seen after a loss of hair cells, supporting previous studies. Our results indicate, however, that cessation of BDNF treatment leads to an accelerated decline in auditory neuron survival as compared to that observed in deafened, untreated cochleae. These findings indicate that much work remains to be done to establish a technique for the long-term survival of auditory neurons in the deaf ear. (C) 2003 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS), which include {{hydrogen}} peroxide (H 2 O 2), the superoxide anion (O 2 -·), and the hydroxyl radical (OH·), are generated as by-products of oxidative metabolism in cells. The cerebral cortex {{has been found}} to be particularly vulnerable to production of ROS associated with conditions such as ischemia-reperfusion, Parkinson's disease, and aging. To investigate the effect of ROS on inhibitory GABAergic synaptic transmission, we examined the electrophysiological mechanisms of the modulatory effect of H 2 O 2 on GABAergic miniature inhibitory postsynaptic current (mIPSCs) in mechanically isolated rat cerebral cortical <b>neurons</b> <b>retaining</b> intact synaptic boutons. The membrane potential was voltage-clamped at - 60 mV and mIPSCs were recorded and analyzed. Superfusion of 1 -mM H 2 O 2 gradually potentiated mIPSCs. This potentiating effect of H 2 O 2 was blocked by the pretreatment with either 10, 000 -unit/mL catalase or 300 -µM N-acetyl-cysteine. The potentiating effect of H 2 O 2 was occluded by an adenylate cyclase activator, forskolin, and was blocked by a protein kinase A inhibitor, N-(2 -[p-bromocinnamylamino] ethyl) - 5 -isoquinolinesulfonamide hydrochloride. This study indicates that oxidative stress may potentiate presynaptic GABA release through the mechanism of cAMP-dependent protein kinase A (PKA) -dependent pathways, which may result in the inhibition of the cerebral cortex neuronal activity...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCutting the axon of a morphologically {{polarized}} neuron (stage 3) {{close to}} the cell body causes another neurite to grow as an axon [1 – 3]. Stage 3 neurons still lack molecular segregation of axonal and dendritic proteins, however. Axonal and dendritic compartments acquire their distinct composition at stage 4 (4 – 5 days in culture), when proteins such as the microtubule-associated protein 2 (MAP- 2) and the glutamate receptor subunit GluR 1 localize to the dendrites and disappear from the axon [4, 5]. We investigated whether cultured hippocampal <b>neurons</b> <b>retained</b> axon/dendrite plasticity after axons and dendrites have created their distinct cytoskeletal architecture and acquired their specific membrane composition. We found that axotomy of stage 4 neurons transformed a dendrite into an axon. Using axonal and dendritic markers, we tested whether cytoskeletal changes could cause similar transformations, and found that actin depolymerization induced multiple axons in unpolarized neurons. Moreover, depletion of actin filaments from both morphologically and molecularly polarized cells also resulted {{in the growth of}} multiple axons from pre-existing dendrites. These results imply that dendrites retain the potential to become axons even after molecular segregation has occurred and that the dendritic fate depends on the integrity of the actin cytoskeleton...|$|R
40|$|In the CNS, the {{hypothalamic}} {{arcuate nucleus}} (ARN) energy-balance circuit {{plays a key}} role in regulating body weight. Recent studies have shown that neurogenesis occurs in the adult hypothalamus, revealing that the ARN energy-balance circuit is more plastic than originally believed. Changes in diet result in altered gene expression and neuronal activity in the ARN, some of which may reflect hypothalamic plasticity. To explore this possibility, we examined the turnover of hypothalamic neurons in mice with obesity secondary to either high-fat diet (HFD) consumption or leptin deficiency. We found substantial turnover of neurons in the ARN that resulted in ongoing cellular remodeling. Feeding mice HFD suppressed neurogenesis, as demonstrated by the observation that these mice both generated fewer new <b>neurons</b> and <b>retained</b> more old <b>neurons.</b> This suppression of neuronal turnover was associated with increased apoptosis of newborn neurons. Leptin-deficient mice also generated fewer new neurons, an observation that was explained in part by a loss of hypothalamic neural stem cells. These data demonstrate that there is substantial postnatal turnover of the arcuate neuronal circuitry in the mouse and reveal the unexpected capacity of diet and leptin deficiency to inhibit this neuronal remodeling. This insight has important implications for our understanding of nutritional regulation of energy balance and brain function...|$|R
