50|$|Chapter 8: Regulatory RiskFor {{a variety}} of reasons—including fears about fading {{national}} identity and corruption—governments may use their regulatory systems to discriminate against foreign investors and multinational corporations. Analysis of <b>regulatory</b> <b>risks</b> {{must take into account}} the political orientation of the government, the strength and autonomy of local regulatory institutions, domestic politics, and the government’s relationship with domestic businesses. Risk mitigation strategies include partnering with a local business or government and obtaining financing from an influential global investor. Regulatory risk varies by sector: some face relatively more pervasive regulations, while others are inherently more flexible and better able to mitigate <b>regulatory</b> <b>risks</b> and costs.|$|E

40|$|Most studies {{around that}} try to verify the {{existence}} of <b>regulatory</b> <b>risk</b> look mainly at developed countries. Looking at <b>regulatory</b> <b>risk</b> in emerging market regulated sectors is no less important to improving and increasing investment in those markets. This thesis comprises three papers comprising <b>regulatory</b> <b>risk</b> issues. In the first Paper I check whether CAPM betas capture information on <b>regulatory</b> <b>risk</b> by using a two-step procedure. In the first step I run Kalman Filter estimates and then use these estimated betas as inputs in a Random-Effect panel data model. I find evidence of <b>regulatory</b> <b>risk</b> in electricity, telecommunications and all regulated sectors in Brazil. I find further evidence that regulatory changes in the country either do not reduce or even increase the betas of the regulated sectors, going {{in the opposite direction}} to the buffering hypothesis as proposed by Peltzman (1976). In the second Paper I check whether CAPM alphas say something about <b>regulatory</b> <b>risk.</b> I investigate a methodology similar to those used by some regulatory agencies around the world like the Brazilian Electricity Regulatory Agency (ANEEL) that incorporates a specific component of <b>regulatory</b> <b>risk</b> in setting tariffs for regulated sectors. I find using SUR estimates negative and significant alphas for all regulated sectors especially the electricity and telecommunications sectors. This runs in the face of theory that predicts alphas that are not statistically different from zero. I suspect that the significant alphas are related to misspecifications in the traditional CAPM that fail to capture true <b>regulatory</b> <b>risk</b> factors. On of the reasons is that CAPM does not consider factors that are proven to have significant effects on asset pricing, such as Fama and French size (ME) and price-to-book value (ME/BE). In the third Paper, I use two additional factors as controls in the estimation of alphas, and the results are similar. Nevertheless, I find evidence that the negative alphas {{may be the result of}} the regulated sectors premiums associated with the three Fama and French factors, particularly the market risk premium. When taken together, ME and ME/BE regulated sectors diminish the statistical significance of market factors premiums, especially for the electricity sector. This show how important is the inclusion of these factors, which unfortunately is scarce in emerging markets like Brazil...|$|R

40|$|Deregulation of the {{electricity}} sector liberated {{the electricity}} sale and production for competitive forces while in the network business, electricity transmission and distribution, natural monopoly positions were recognised. Deregulation was accompanied by efficiencyoriented thinking on the whole electricity supply industry. For electricity distribution this meant a transition from a public service towards profit-driven business guided by economic regulation. Regulation is the primary means to enforce societal and other goals in the regulated monopoly sector. The design of economic regulation is concerned with two main attributes; end-customer price and quality of electricity distribution services. Regulation limits {{the costs of the}} regulated company but also defines the desired quality of monopoly services. The characteristics of the regulatory framework and the incentives it provides are therefore decisive for the electricity distribution sector. Regulation is not a static factor; changes in the regulatory practices cause discontinuity points, which in turn generate risks. A variety of social and environmental concerns together with technological advancements have emphasised the relevance of quality regulation, which is expected to lead to the large-scale replacement of overhead lines with underground cables. The electricity network construction activity is therefore currently witnessing revolutionary changes in its competitive landscape. In a business characterised by high statutory involvement and a high level of sunk costs, recognising and understanding the <b>regulatory</b> <b>risks</b> becomes a key success factor. As a response, electricity distribution companies have turned into outsourcing to attain efficiency and quality goals. This doctoral thesis addresses the impacts of <b>regulatory</b> <b>risks</b> on electricity network construction, which is a commonly outsourced activity in the electricity distribution network sector. The chosen research approach is characterised as an action analytical research on account of the fact that <b>regulatory</b> <b>risks</b> are greatly dependent on the individual nature of the regulatory regime applied in the electricity distribution sector. The main contribution of this doctoral thesis is to develop a concept for recognising and managing the business risks stemming from economic regulation. The degree of outsourcing in the sector is expected to increase in years to come. The results of the research provide new knowledge to manage the <b>regulatory</b> <b>risks</b> when outsourcing services...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the best way to quantify the political and <b>regulatory</b> <b>risks</b> in the oil industry. To analyze if these risks should be included in the cash flow or quantified in the WACC (weighted average cost of capital), we used real case studies of exploration and production (E&P) and refining in Latin America. The oil industry is a good case study for this type of analysis because it is more susceptible to government interventions. Our findings indicate that, in general, changes in oil rules cause only small increases in the country risk and beta (therefore in the WACC) but generate great volatility in the cash flow. Although the political and <b>regulatory</b> <b>risks</b> are considered market risk (i. e. have the potential to affect the whole economy) and should be quantified in the WACC equation, our results indicate that the option to insert these risks directly in the cash flow produce better results when compared to adding a spread in the WACC...|$|E

40|$|In theory private {{infrastructure}} investment should be particularly susceptible to political and <b>regulatory</b> <b>risks.</b> However, theory does not predict {{which type of}} risk are most important and the empirical evidence has been largely limited to case studies {{because of lack of}} comparable cross country data. This paper uses a unique data set that covers all private greenfield {{infrastructure investment}} in developing countries since 1990 and investigates how different forms of risks have affected private infrastructure investment. Focusing on greenfield investment is critical since it reflects private investors ' decisions and excludes public policy decisions such as privatization. We find that catastrophic political risks (including risks of expropriation and traditional political instability risks) are most closely related to private infrastructure investment. By comparison, most risks of creeping expropriation (such as <b>regulatory</b> <b>risks,</b> bureaucratic and judiciary enforcement risks and corruption) are not significantly associated with private infrastructure investment, the exception being indicators of credibility and participation in rule making. Interestingly, these results contrast with the ones obtained for aggregate investment in developing countries where generally risk of creeping expropriation dominate...|$|E

Long-term resource planning provides a potential framework within which utilities can assess carbon <b>regulatory</b> <b>risk</b> and evaluate options for mitigating exposure to this risk through investments in energy efficiency and other low-carbon resources. In this paper, we examine current resource planning practices related to managing carbon <b>regulatory</b> <b>risk,</b> based on a comparative analysis of the most-recent long-term resource plans filed by fifteen major utilities in the Western U. S. First, we compare the assumptions and methods used by utilities to assess carbon <b>regulatory</b> <b>risk</b> and to evaluate energy efficiency as a risk mitigation option. Although most utilities have made important strides in beginning to address carbon <b>regulatory</b> <b>risk</b> within their resource plan, we also identify a number of opportunities for improvement and offer recommendations for resource planners and state regulators to consider. We also summarize the composition and carbon intensity of the preferred resource portfolios selected by the fifteen Western utilities, highlighting the contribution of energy efficiency {{and its impact on}} the carbon intensity of utilities' proposed resource strategies. Energy efficiency and renewables are the dominant low-carbon resources included in utilities' preferred portfolios. Across the fifteen utilities, energy efficiency constitutes anywhere from 6 percent to almost 50 percent of the preferred portfolio energy resources, and represents 22 percent of all incremental resources in aggregate...|$|R
