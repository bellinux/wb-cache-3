40|$|International audienceThe {{question}} of how to teach energy has been renewed by recent studies focusing on the learning and teaching progressions for this concept. In this context, one question has been, for the most part, overlooked: how should energy be defined throughout schooling. This paper addresses this question in three steps. We first identify and discuss two main approaches in physics concerning the definition of energy, one claiming there is no satisfactory definition and taking conservation as a fundamental property, the other based on <b>Rankine’s</b> definition of energy as the capacity of a system to produce changes. We then present a study concerning how energy is actually defined throughout schooling in the case of France by analyzing the national programs, physics textbooks, and the answers of teachers to a questionnaire. This study brings to light a consistency problem in the way energy is defined across school years: in primary school, an adapted version of <b>Rankine’s</b> definition is introduced and conservation is ignored; while in high school, conservation is introduced and <b>Rankine’s</b> definition is ignored. Finally, we address this consistency problem by discussing possible teaching progressions. We argue in favor of the use of <b>Rankine’s</b> definition throughout schooling: at primary school, it is a possible substitute to students’ erroneous conceptions; at secondary school, it might help students become aware of the unifying role of energy and thereby overcome the compartmentalization problem...|$|R

30|$|To analyze {{a simple}} {{model for a}} vortex, <b>Rankine’s</b> {{combined}} vortex was utilized. A vortex is classified as either a forced vortex or a free vortex. The angular velocity of a forced vortex is constant regardless of the radius of the flow, whereas the angular velocity of a free vortex is inversely proportional to {{the square of the}} radius of the vortex. In our system, we generated the vortex by the circular motion of an end effector. The result is a forced vortex in the center surrounded by a free vortex. Because our purpose is to measure the angular velocity around the circular motion, <b>Rankine’s</b> combined model for the free vortex can be applied to our system.|$|R
