High-g decelerations typical of passenger vehicles are known to generate temperatures as high as 900 C in {{a fraction of a}} second.

This model, which simulates the longitudinal fuselage dynamics, main rotor blade flapping, and far field acoustics, was validated using in-flight measurements and recordings from ground microphones during a full-scale flight test featuring a Bell 206 B- 3 helicopter. The flight test was specifically designed to study transient maneuvers. The validated model demonstrated that the flapping of the main rotor blades does not significantly affect the acoustics radiated by the helicopter during maneuvering flight. Furthermore, the model also demonstrated that Quasi-Static Acoustic Mapping (Q-SAM) methods {{can be used to}} reliably predict the noise radiated during transient maneuvers.

Validation is provided by reference to experimental data for a pitching aerofoil with dynamic stall phenomenon. The performance of the turbine is mapped out for a variety of different tip speed ratios and detailed investigations are presented to determine how and most importantly why the turbine performance varies with thickness and camber as it does. The rotor blades chosen were the NACA 0012, NACA 0022, NACA 5522 and LS 0421. The turbine rotor has a diameter of with a blade chord length of. Over the range of tip speed ratios examined, the NACA 0012 profile performed with the highest overall performance (CP) of 50 % at. Slightly cambering aerofoils (such as the LS 0421) can improve the overall performance of the VAWT whereas a camber of 5 % (NACA 5522) results in unfavourable performance. Of the cambered blades tested, the LS 0421 performs the best with maximum CP of 0. 40 at. A camber along the blade path causes the blades to generate higher values of torque in both the upwind and the downwind regions.

In applying the acoustic analogy, integration over the tangential coordinate of the source region is performed numerically, permitting the equations to be solved without approximation for any degree of angular inflow. Inflow angle is specified in terms of yaw, pitch, and roll angles of the aircraft. Since these can be arbitrarily large, the analysis applies with equal accuracy to propellers and helicopter <b>rotors.</b> For <b>thickness</b> and loading, the derivation is given in complete detail with working equations for near and far field. However, the quadrupole derivation has been carried only far enough to show feasibility of the numerical approach.

The resulting computer program, called WOBBLE has been written in FORTRAN and follows the notation of this report very closely. The new theory is explored to establish the effects of varying inflow angle on axial and circumferential directivity.

40|$|One of the {{benefits}} of electric vehicles (EVs) and hybrid vehicles (HVs) is their potential to recuperate braking energy. Regenerative braking (RB) will minimize duty levels on the brakes, giving advantages including extended brake rotor and friction material life and, more significantly, reduced brake mass and minimised brake pad wear. In this thesis, a mathematical analysis (MATLAB) has been used to analyse the accessibility of regenerative braking energy during a single-stop braking event. The results have indicated that a friction brake could be downsized while maintaining the same functional requirements of the vehicle braking in the standard brakes, including thermomechanical performance (heat transfer coefficient estimation, temperature distribution, cooling and stress deformation). This would allow lighter brakes to be designed and fitted with confidence in a normal passenger car alongside a hybrid electric drive. An approach has been established and a lightweight brake disc design analysed FEA and experimentally verified is presented in this research. Thermal performance was a key factor which was studied using the 3 D model in FEA simulations. Ultimately, a design approach for lightweight brake discs suitable for use in any car-sized hybrid vehicle has been developed and tested.

40|$|The {{automotive}} industry has {{for many years}} identified weight reduction {{as a way of}} improving product competitiveness and thus the ability to make profits. One area that has been examined for weight reduction is vehicle with regenerative braking system (RBS). The greatest advantages of electric vehicles (EVs), and hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) is their ability to recover significant amounts of braking energy using a RBS. Regenerative braking is an effective method to extend brake disc life, minimise disc rotor weight, minimise brake pad wear and to extend the working range of an EV or HEV. Regenerative braking would extend the working range of an EV or HEV provided that any extra energy consumption e. g. from increased vehicle mass and system losses did not outweigh the saving from energy recuperation, also reduce duty levels on the brakes themselves, giving advantages including extended brake rotor and friction material life, but more importantly reduced brake mass, minimise brake pad wear. The objective of this research is to define thermal performance on lightweight disc brake models. Thermal performance was a key factor which was studied using the 3 D model in Finite Element Analysis simulations.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{calculation}} of the microwave field distribution in a magic angle spinning (MAS) probe utilized in dynamic nuclear polarization (DNP) experiments. The microwave magnetic field (B[subscript 1 S]) profile was obtained from simulations performed with the High Frequency Structure Simulator (HFSS) software suite, using a model that includes the launching antenna, the outer Kel-F stator housing coated with Ag, the RF coil, and the 4 mm diameter sapphire rotor containing the sample. The predicted average B[subscript 1 S] field is 13 μT/W[superscript 1 / 2], where S denotes the electron spin. For a routinely achievable input power of 5 W the corresponding value is γ[subscript S]B[subscript 1 S] = 0. 84 MHz. The calculations provide insights into the coupling of the microwave power to the sample, including reflections from the RF coil and diffraction of the power transmitted through the coil. The variation of enhancement with <b>rotor</b> wall <b>thickness</b> was also successfully simulated. A second, simplified calculation was performed using a single pass model based on Gaussian beam propagation and Fresnel diffraction. This model provided additional physical insight and was in good agreement with the full HFSS simulation. These calculations indicate approaches to increasing the coupling of the microwave power to the sample, {{including the use of}} a converging lens and fine adjustment of the spacing of the windings of the RF coil. The present results should prove useful in optimizing the coupling of microwave power to the sample in future DNP experiments. Finally, the results of the simulation were used to predict the cross effect DNP enhancement (ϵ) vs. ω[subscript 1 S]/(2 π) for a sample of [superscript 13]C-urea dissolved in a 60 : 40 glycerol/water mixture containing the polarizing agent TOTAPOL; very good agreement was obtained between theory and experiment.

40|$|Selective Laser Sintering (SLS) {{offers the}} {{advantage}} of directly manufacturing complex-shaped parts without the uneconomic loss of material so common when conventional manufacturing methods are applied. Originating from the laser sintering of polymers, lots of {{research has been conducted}} on advanced materials like metals and ceramics. In recent years the Fraunhofer IKTS has conducted research on the laser sintering of SiC and different hydroxyapatite (HAp) powders. The HAp powders have been characterized based on their laser sintering ability with the variation of process parameters like spreading behavior, different grain shape and size, hatch clearance, etc. More elaborate research has been conducted concerning the laser sintering of SiSiC components. After infiltration and pyrolysis of laser-sintered SiC parts, the resulting SiSiC components showed similar mechanical characteristics to those of conventionally processed SiSiC components. Different complex geometries were realized e. g. a 120 -mm honeycombstructured mirror support model (wall thickness of 1 mm, for aerospace applications) and a small turbine <b>rotor</b> (minimal wall <b>thickness</b> of 0. 3 mm) as a demonstrator part for automotive components. Alaser mirror with integrated cooling channels for application in movable beam arms for laser material processing was also manufactured. Another successfully generated SiSiC component is an injection molding tool insert (ca. 35 x 30 mm; diameter x height) with a complex-structured surface and inner cooling channels. The next steps will be towards research dealing with more complex de signs and other ceramics as well as metal-ceramic hybrids...|$|R
