40|$|Motivated {{by recent}} {{experimental}} development, we investigate spin-orbit coupled repulsive Fermi atoms in a one-dimensional optical lattice. Using the density-matrix renormalization group method, we calculate momentum distribution function, gap, and spin-correlation function to reveal rich ground-state properties. We find that spin-orbit coupling (SOC) can generate unconventional momentum distribution, which depends crucially on the filling. We call the corresponding phase with zero gap the SOC-induced metallic phase. We {{also show that}} SOC can drive the system from the antiferromagnetic to ferromagnetic Mott insulators with spin rotating. As a result, a second-order quantum phase transition between the spin-rotating ferromagnetic Mott insulator and the SOC-induced metallic phase is predicted at the strong SOC. Here the spin <b>rotating</b> <b>means</b> that the spin orientations of the nearest-neighbor sites are not parallel or antiparallel, i. e., they have an intersection angle θ∈ (0,π). Finally, we show that the momentum k_peak, at which peak of the spin-structure factor appears, can also be affected dramatically by SOC. The analytical expression of this momentum {{with respect to the}} SOC strength is also derived. It suggests that the predicted spin-rotating ferromagnetic (k_peak...|$|E
40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} an apparatus for producing filament, fiber, ribbon or film from a molten material, comprising a preferably heat extracting crucible which contains {{a pool of}} molten material at a selected horizontal level in the pool. The crucible has an opening extending from above the free surface level to a bottom edge of the opening, the bottom edge being sufficiently below the free surface level so that the molten material cannot form and hold a meniscus by surface tension between the edge {{and the level of}} the free surface and further comprises a heat extracting substrate laterally disposed with respect to the crucible and which rotates about an axis of rotation. The substrate is positioned adjacent the edge of the opening which confines the molten material and prevents it from overflowing downwardly out of the crucible. The invention features <b>rotating</b> <b>means</b> which includes a first drive means for tiltably rotating the crucible about an axis of rotation which is coaxial with the axis of rotation of the substrate, so the crucible edge can be maintained a predetermined constant distance from the substrate. The distance chosen is suitable for depositing molten material on the substrate and the apparatus also has a second drive means which is drivingly connected to the substrate for continuously moving the surface of the substrate upwardly past the edge and a melt front formed at the interface of the molten material and the substrate surface...|$|E

However, {{a change in}} stem geometry may have a profound influence on stability. Stems with a wide, rectangular proximal section may be more stable than those which are narrower proximally. We examined the influence of proximal geometry on stability by comparing the two-year migration of the Exeter stem with a more recent design, the CPS-Plus, which has a wider shoulder and a more rectangular cross-section. The hypothesis was that these design features would increase rotational stability. Both stems subsided approximately 1 mm relative to the femur {{during the first two}} years after implantation. The Exeter stem was found to <b>rotate</b> into valgus (<b>mean</b> 0. 2 degrees, sd 0. 42 degrees) and internally <b>rotate</b> (<b>mean</b> 1. 28 degrees, sd 0. 99 degrees).

40|$|Theoretical {{predictions}} {{are given}} for the strange sea distributions in the nucleon based on the flavor SU(3) chiral quark soliton model, with emphasis upon the asymmetry of quark and antiquark distributions. We find that the quark-antiquark asymmetry of the strange sea is much larger for the longitudinally polarized distribution functions than for the unpolarized ones. A preliminary comparison with the CCFR data for the unpolarized s-quark distribution and with the LSS fits of the longitudinally polarized distribution functions is encouraging. An incomparable feature of the chiral quark soliton model (CQSM) as compared with many other effective models of QCD like the MIT bag model {{is that it can}} give reasonable predictions not only for the quark distributions but also for the antiquark distributions [1, 2]. This crucially owes to the field theoretical nature of the model that enables us to carry out nonperturbative evaluation of the parton distribution functions with full inclusion of the vacuum polarization effects in the <b>rotating</b> <b>mean</b> field of hedgehog shape [1, 3].

40|$|The {{idea that}} {{geomagnetic}} westward drift indicates convective leveling of the planetary momentum gradient within Earth's core is pursued {{in search of}} a differentially <b>rotating</b> <b>mean</b> state, upon which various oscillations and secular effects might be superimposed. The desired state conforms to roughly spherical boundary conditions, minimizes dissipative interference with convective cooling in the bulk of the core, yet may aid core cooling by depositing heat in the uppermost core and lower mantle. The variational calculus of stationary dissipation applied to a spherical vortex within the core yields an interesting differential rotation profile, akin to spherical Couette flow bounded by thin Hartmann layers. Four boundary conditions are required. To concentrate shear induced dissipation near the core-mantle boundary, these are taken to be: (i) no-slip at the core-mantle interface; (ii) geomagnetically estimated bulk westward flow {{at the base of the}} core-mantle boundary layer; (iii) no-slip at the inner-outer core interface; and, to describe magnetic locking of the inner core to the deep outer core; (iv) hydrodynamically stress-free at the inner-outer core boundary.
