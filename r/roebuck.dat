5|$|In their {{histories}} of Somerset County Cricket Club, Peter <b>Roebuck</b> and David Foot mostly gloss over the season; <b>Roebuck</b> includes a scorecard, but provides only two paragraphs of prose, while Foot only mentions {{the loss of}} first-class cricket.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey Palmer as Admiral <b>Roebuck,</b> M's {{contentious}} military contact.|$|E
5|$|<b>Roebuck</b> {{recorded}} {{three straight}} outs {{to end the}} inning without further scoring. The Dodgers and the Giants each managed a single in their halves of the third inning. Neither Pierce nor <b>Roebuck</b> allowed a baserunner in {{the fourth or fifth}} innings, though the Giants further added to their lead in the sixth. The Dodgers pinch hit for <b>Roebuck</b> to lead {{off the top of the}} inning with Ken McMullen and although he singled he did not score. Larry Sherry entered to pitch for the Dodgers in the bottom of the inning and after recording the first out he allowed back-to-back home runs to Mays and Orlando Cepeda to give the Giants a 5–0 lead. Davenport then singled and Sherry was relieved by Jack Smith who finished the inning without further damage.|$|E

50|$|One of <b>Roebuck's</b> {{more memorable}} roles was as Jay Leno in the HBO made-for-TV film The Late Shift. Leno has often commented {{positively}} on <b>Roebuck's</b> performance whenever a guest {{brings up the}} film on the show. In 2002 portrayed a hearse driver in the Comedy horror film Bubba Ho-Tep and acted than 2006 in the production Red Riding Hood. This Randal Kleiser directed HD motion picture was shot primarily with live-on-demand 3D virtual set technology.|$|R

5|$|MI6 sends James Bond, agent 007, {{into the}} field to spy on a {{terrorist}} arms bazaar on the Russian border. Despite M's insistence on letting 007 finish his reconnaissance, British Admiral <b>Roebuck</b> orders the frigate HMS Chester to launch a missile attack on the arms bazaar. Bond then discovers two nuclear torpedoes mounted on an L-39 Albatros, and as the missile is too far along to be aborted, 007 hijacks the L-39 and flies away seconds before the bazaar is destroyed.|$|E
5|$|Most {{new cars}} were sold through {{automobile}} dealerships in the 1950s, but Crosley automobiles {{were still on}} sale at any number of appliance or department stores, and Allstate (a rebadged Henry J) could be ordered at any Sears and <b>Roebuck</b> in 1952 and 1953. By mid-decade, these outlets had vanished and the automobile dealer became the sole source of new automobiles.|$|E
5|$|Numerous {{supporting}} {{characters have}} been given expansive and recurring appearances in the progressive storyline, including: L. Scott Caldwell as Rose Henderson, Mira Furlan as Danielle Rousseau, Kimberley Joseph as Cindy, Fredric Lane as Edward Mars, William Mapother as Ethan Rom, Daniel <b>Roebuck</b> as Leslie Arzt and John Terry as Christian Shephard. Ana Lucia Cortez, played by Michelle Rodriguez, made her first appearance this season, and she became a major character during the second season.|$|E
2500|$|In 2005 <b>Roebuck's</b> father {{wrote that}} Peter is an [...] "unconventional loner with an {{independent}} outlook on life, an irreverent sense of humour {{and sometimes a}} withering tongue." ...|$|R
25|$|On {{the county}} circuit, <b>Roebuck's</b> {{nickname}} was Rupert. This arose when the Essex captain, Keith Fletcher, once addressed him as Rupert, in the mistaken {{belief that it}} was actually his name.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} animals that are {{otherwise}} common in Denmark, such as vipers, squirrels, moles and badgers, are nonexistent on the island, whereas foxes, hedgehogs, <b>roebucks,</b> hares and especially rabbits exist in abundance.|$|R

Jones) and Andrea Carmichael (Earlene Davis). In addition, Rosemont and Burnett star as Carole and Doris, the respective mothers of Finn and Sue, and Daniel <b>Roebuck</b> plays Karofsky's father, Paul.|$|E
5|$|The English {{hoped to}} avoid sinking their {{opponent}} {{and to prevent}} her from running aground. The damage on Madre de Deus's defences was becoming serious. With her bow rigging all but disabled, Burrough sent <b>Roebuck</b> which then crashed into Madre de Deus, followed by Foresight. Both moved directly under her main guns. The English boarded her in the dark at 10 pm. Golden Dragon, Sampson and Tiger and the repaired Dainty came up in support. The English took the ship after a bloody hand-to-hand combat.|$|E
5|$|Verville {{was born}} in Atlantic Mine, {{a small town in}} Michigan's Upper Peninsula, on November 16, 1890, as the son of Victor Verville and Fabianna Miron. As a child, his mother bought him a Conyne-style box kite from Sears <b>Roebuck,</b> which {{captured}} his imagination and started his interest in flight and aviation. Verville also began reading stories about the Wright Brothers in newspapers and magazines with great interest. Later he even wrote to the Wrights and Glenn Curtiss and received responses.|$|E
5000|$|The 11th-century critic Guo Ruoxu (郭若虚) in his [...] "Overview of Painting" [...] (图画见闻志, Tuhua Jian Wen Zhi) tells {{this about}} Yi's career: ... His {{painting}} was excellent: flowers and birds, bees and cicadas he rendered life-like with subtle detail. At first he specialized in flower and fruit, {{but after he}} had seen such paintings by Zhao Chang (趙昌), he admitted their superiority with a sigh, and then resolved he would acquire fame by painting subjects not yet tried by the artists of old; thus he began to paint <b>roebucks</b> and gibbons. He spent months roaming the mountains of southern Hubei and northern Hunan, watching <b>roebucks</b> (獐鹿) and gibbons (猿狖) in their natural environment.|$|R
5000|$|Debate in the House of Commons, on 15 April 1834, on Mr. <b>Roebuck's</b> Motion for [...] "a Select Committee {{to inquire}} {{the means of}} {{remedying}} the evils which exist {{in the form of}} the governments now existing in Upper and Lower Canada", 1834 ...|$|R
50|$|The {{mountain}} is largely forested with spruce, {{it has an}} upper alpine vegetation in the highest points of the mountain. It features large animals including bears, wolves, <b>roebucks,</b> wild boars and wild goats. The {{western part of the}} {{mountain is}} part of Prespa Park.|$|R
5|$|A {{few days}} later, {{in the wake}} of the scandal, Waugh was widely jeered by an Australian crowd when he walked out to bat on the first day of the Test. In what he {{described}} as the toughest day of his career, Waugh gave an unconvincing and hesitant performance. Waugh managed only seven runs in 36 minutes before being removed by Peter Such, caught and bowled. The cricket writer Peter <b>Roebuck</b> opined that it was the worst home crowd reception for an Australian player that he could remember. Warne was injured at the time and did not play, so he did not have to face the hostile crowd.|$|E
5|$|On 3 August Dainty sighted a {{large ship}} heading {{directly}} towards them {{and as it}} drew nearer, its enormous size became apparent. The carrack was far larger than Santa Cruz, fully {{three times the size}} of England's biggest ship. Madre de Deus was attacked by the much smaller Dainty. Around midday Newport's Golden Dragon, followed by <b>Roebuck</b> - bigger than Dainty, but only a fraction of the Madre, joined the fray. These were followed at two-hour intervals by Foresight and Prudence in the evening. The Dainty had her foremast shot away and was out of the battle for five hours.|$|E
5|$|Prost was {{partnered with}} fellow Frenchman René Arnoux for 1981. Motor sports author Nigel <b>Roebuck</b> {{reports that there}} were {{problems}} between Prost and Arnoux {{from the start of}} the season, Prost being immediately quicker than his more experienced teammate. He did not finish the first two Grands Prix, due to collisions with Andrea de Cesaris in Long Beach and Didier Pironi at Jacarepaguá, but scored his first podium finish at Buenos Aires. He also did not finish in the next four races, and then won his first Formula One race at his home Grand Prix in France at the fast Dijon circuit, finishing two seconds ahead of his old teammate John Watson.|$|E
5000|$|On June 12, 1868, he was {{appointed}} minister to the United Kingdom, beginning his term on September 14, 1868. [...] While in England, he was criticized for fraternizing with the Lairds, Wharncliffes, <b>Roebucks,</b> and Gregorios, of England, which was considered a blunder in diplomacy.|$|R
6000|$|One {{thing is}} certain in our Northern land-- [...] Allow that birth or valour, wealth or wit, [...] Give each {{precedence}} to their possessor, [...] Envy, that follows on such eminence, [...] As comes the lyme-hound on the <b>roebuck's</b> trace, [...] Shall pull them down each one. [...] SIR DAVID LINDSAY.|$|R
2500|$|Students {{residing}} at <b>Roebuck's</b> farm in Natal, {{where he}} lived for six months of every year, stated that no corporal punishment was ever meted out at the residence. A law graduate who speaks for the housemates at Straw Hat Farm said of the sexual assault allegation: [...] "This is not the Peter we knew." ...|$|R
5|$|The Dodgers {{cut into}} {{the lead in the}} fourth, as Snider doubled to lead off, {{advanced}} to third on a Tommy Davis single, and scored on a groundout by Frank Howard. The Giants threatened against Podres {{in the top of the}} sixth with singles by Cepeda, Ed Bailey, and Jim Davenport on a bunt to load the bases. However, Ed <b>Roebuck</b> relieved Podres and escaped the inning without allowing a run. The Dodgers took a 3–2 lead in the bottom of the inning as Snider singled and scored on a home run by Tommy Davis. They extended this lead in the bottom of the seventh as Wills singled and then stole second as Jim Gilliam batted. Manager Alvin Dark had chosen not to try to hold Wills to the first base bag as Dark did not believe his Giants' defense could stop Wills from stealing regardless of their positioning. Gilliam was put out for the second out of the inning, but Wills stole third base and then scored on a throwing error by the catcher trying to catch him. This extended the Dodgers' lead to 4–2. The Dodgers further threatened in the bottom of the eighth. Don Larsen entered in relief of Marichal midway through Davis' at bat but Davis walked to lead off the inning regardless. Ron Fairly sacrificed him to second base and Davis then stole third as Howard struck out. However, Larsen intentionally walked both Roseboro and Willie Davis to load the bases and induced a ground out by <b>Roebuck</b> to end the inning.|$|E
5|$|The episode's story {{focuses on}} couple Nikki Fernandez (Kiele Sanchez) and Paulo (Rodrigo Santoro). The flashbacks reveal their lives before {{arriving}} on the island, {{and what they}} have been doing between day one and day eighty-one. Boone Carlyle (Ian Somerhalder) returned for the fifth time since his death late in the first season. Furthermore, Ethan (William Mapother) and Dr. Arzt (Daniel <b>Roebuck)</b> reprised their guest roles in flashbacks. The episode got a mixed response from critics and fans, with positive reception considering it an entertaining send-off to two unpopular characters, but negative reviews deeming it unnecessary.|$|E
5|$|With the news, the English ships {{waited and}} raided the villages on Corvo for supplies. For {{the month of}} July the English ships formed a picket line spaced about six miles apart along a north/south axis. From the {{southern}} flank near Flores Island, the order of ships was Dainty, Golden Dragon, <b>Roebuck,</b> Tiger, Sampson, Prudence and Foresight. The Spanish fleet, which had been sighted briefly, seemed no longer a threat; Alvaro de Bazan had made a major miscalculation: he disobeyed orders and headed further west, allowing the English to first reach the area of interception.|$|E
50|$|Commerce {{dominated}} the district {{for much of}} its history. Lumber and grain were shipped through the district, and Sears and <b>Roebuck's</b> first mail order warehouse was located at Fulton and DesPlaines. Randolph Street {{became the center of}} wholesale produce distribution in the late 19th Century and was the site of the famous Haymarket Square labor riots of 1886 on Des Plaines Street.|$|R
6000|$|... "Let us go away," [...] whispered Sam. [...] "I can't stand {{this any}} longer!" [...] And he rushed {{off with the}} tears {{standing}} in his eyes. The others were also affected, and glad enough to leave the place, once and forever. Wumble and Slim Jim threw <b>Roebuck's</b> body into a hollow and placed some dirt over it, and then built up a little mound of stones to mark the spot.|$|R
50|$|By 1922, Sears had regained {{financial}} stability. First {{he oversaw}} {{the design and}} construction of the company's first department store within Sears, <b>Roebuck's</b> massive 16-hectare (40-acre) headquarters complex of offices, laboratories and mail-order operations at Homan Ave. and Arthington St. on Chicago's West Side. The store opened in 1925. In 1924, Rosenwald resigned the presidency, but remained as chairman {{until his death in}} 1932; his goal was to devote more time to philanthropy.|$|R
