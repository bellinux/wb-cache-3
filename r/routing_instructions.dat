Real-time atomic force microscopy allows direct observation of individual steps of a single motor, revealing mechanistic details of its operation.

In contrast, active networks allow added computation within the network through user-defined <b>routing</b> and processing <b>instructions,</b> providing the on-demand installation of powerful software-based network services. As an adaptation of previous active networks, this thesis presents an architecture based entirely in middleware. By utilising middleware services, the architecture resolves authentication, memory-management, and interconnectivity issues otherwise assumed as inherent, and enables a highly functional multiple-language interface for the deployment of dynamic protocols. After describing the architectural design, an empirical system evaluation is presented with comparisons to both conventional network protocols and a well-known existing active network architecture. Results indicate performance improvements over the existing architecture, and demonstrate the feasibility of a multiple-language active network infrastructure implemented entirely in middleware...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – In {{previous}} studies {{it remains unclear}} whether the internet is an effective mechanism for developing a symmetrical and interactive communications process that is initiated by the investor rather than the company. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to study the effectiveness of the internet to act as a mechanism to achieve a more interactive communication between companies and investors. Design/methodology/approach – A “mystery investor ” approach is used to test whether companies reply to e-mails from investors. Content analysis was used to study the responsiveness, timeliness and relevance of the answers. Findings – The quality of symmetrical communication (in terms of responsiveness and relevance) appears relatively low. Companies with high-quality investor relations (IR) web sites do not handle e-mails more effectively. Therefore, high-quality asymmetrical communication between company and their investors not automatically associated with a high-quality symmetrical type of communication. Practical implications – Companies that provide e-mail facilities for investors create the impression that they welcome communications with investors. However, if companies fail to handle incoming e-mails from investors quickly and correctly, they create feelings of dissatisfaction. As a result e-mail facilities on web sites are counter-productive and hamper the creation of good relationships with investors. These results emphasize the need for better internal <b>routing,</b> better <b>instructions</b> and specific training programmes for IR staff. Originality/value – The paper provides original evidence on the potential of the internet to enhance symmetrical communication between companies and their investors. This paper contributes to a better understanding of the way the internet can be used by IR departments to enhance the communications with investors...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Combining mobile {{platforms}} such as manned or unmanned {{vehicles and}} peer assisted wireless communication is an enabler for {{a vast number}} of applications. A key enabler for the applications is the routing protocol FGRP that directs the packets in the network. The FGRP protocol has been implemented using GLOMOSIM simulator. Routing packets in fully connected mobile ad hoc networks (MANETs) has been studied to a great extent, but the assumption on full connectivity is generally not valid in a real system. This means that a practical routing protocol must handle intermittent connectivity and the absence of end-to-end connections. Routing overhead increase as data bits added to user-transmitted data, for carrying routing information and error correcting and operational <b>instructions.</b> <b>Routing</b> overhead because of location information collection and retrieving information using geographic routing in MANET. Developing a new framework for quantifying routing overhead in MANETs employing geographic routing, examining how the routing overhead (measured in the unit of bits meters per unit time) proposed required to disseminate and acquire location information of the nodes, scales with the number of nodes. For Spray and Wait this involved a new packet level implementation in GLOMOSIM as opposed to the original connection level custom simulator. Assume that nodes can deliver their location information at timeslot t 2 f 1; 2; [...] . g : IN to any other nodes within the same timeslot, assuming that nodes know where to access it, they can retrieve the location information of other nodes during the same timeslot...|$|R

5000|$|The Disaster Management eGov Initiative of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) {{determined}} in 2004 {{to launch a}} project to develop interagency emergency data communications standards. It called together a group of national emergency response practitioner leaders and sought their guidance on requirements for such standards. In June, 2004 the first such meeting identified {{the need for a}} common distribution element for all emergency messages. Subsequent meetings of a Standards Working Group developed detailed requirements and a draft specification for such a distribution element (DE).During the same period the DM Initiative was forming a partnership with industry members of the Emergency Interoperability Consortium (EIC) to cooperate in the development of emergency standards. EIC had been a leading sponsor of the Common Alerting Protocol (CAP). Both organizations desired to develop an expanded family of data formats for exchanging operational information beyond warning.EIC members participated {{in the development of the}} DE, and in the broader design of the design of a process for the development of additional standards. This was named Emergency Data Exchange Language (EDXL).The goal of the EDXL project is to facilitate emergency information sharing and data exchange across the local, state, tribal, national and non-governmental organizations of different professions that provide emergency response and management services. EDXL will accomplish this goal by focusing on the standardization of specific messages (messaging interfaces) to facilitate emergency communication and coordination particularly when more than one profession is involved. It is not just an [...] "emergency management" [...] domain exercise.It is a national effort including a diverse and representative group of local, state and federal emergency response organizations and professionals, following a multi-step process. Just as a data-focused effort targets shared data elements, the EDXL process looks for shared message needs, which are common across a broad number of organizations. The objective is to rapidly deliver implementable standard messages, in an incremental fashion, directly to emergency response agencies in the trenches, providing seamless communication and coordination supporting each particular process. The effort first addresses the most urgent needs and proceeds to subsequent message sets in a prioritized fashion. The goal is to incrementally develop and deliver standards.EDXL is intended as a suite of emergency data message types including resource queries and requests, situation status, message <b>routing</b> <b>instructions</b> and the like, needed in the context of cross-disciplinary, cross-jurisdictional communications related to emergency response.The priorities and requirements are created by the DM EDXL Standards Working Group (SWG) which is a formalized group of emergency response practitioners, technical experts, and industry.The draft DE specification was trialed by a number of EIC members starting in October, 2004. In November, 2004, EIC formally submitted the draft to the OASIS Emergency Management Technical Committee for standardization.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{addresses}} {{the question of}} how route instructions that include landmarks for indoor navigation can be created automatically based on information available in spatial indoor databases. Existing approaches for the generation of landmark-based <b>routing</b> <b>instructions</b> are designed for outdoor environments and rely mainly on instance-level data about the characteristics of potential landmarks. However, indoor navigation differs from outdoor navigation in various aspects, and indoor spatial databases do not usually contain detailed information about individual objects. Therefore, the proposed method aims to address the specific challenges of indoor navigation and relies only on commonly available data about categories of spatial objects. A case study of a university campus demonstrates that by and large the method produces correct <b>routing</b> <b>instructions</b> that include landmarks. However, it also reveals some gaps in the model and shows possibilities for enhancements for future work...|$|E

40|$|According to {{statistics}} from the Federal Highway Administration (FHWA), each year approximately 17 % of all work zone fatalities are pedestrians. People {{who are visually impaired}} often encounter physical and information barriers that limit their accessibility and mobility. A survey was conducted among 10 visually impaired participants as a starting point to understand their challenges and what types of information are helpful in providing bypass or <b>routing</b> <b>instructions</b> to them around work zones. The survey results were incorporated into development of guiding documents in determining information elements that are essential and useful for providing <b>routing</b> <b>instructions</b> to the visually impaired around work zones. Building on our previous efforts to provide geometry and signal timing to the visually impaired at signalized intersections, a smartphone-based navigation system was developed and integrated with navigational audible information to alert pedestrians at decision points prior to their arrival at a work zone. The recommended message elements from survey results were implemented in a smartphone app that uses GPS and Bluetooth technologies to determine a user’s location. When a work zone is detected, the smartphone will vibrate to alert users and the app will then announce a corresponding audible message to users. The visually impaired users can perform a single tap on the smartphone to repeat the messages, if needed. Functionality testing and system validation of the smartphone app were performed by attaching four Bluetooth beacons to light posts near a construction site in St. Paul, MN. Additional research is needed to conduct experiments with visually impaired users and evaluate system reliability and usefulness.

40|$|Abstract The {{importance}} of format, graphic layout, and ques-tion <b>routing</b> <b>instructions</b> {{on the quality}} of survey data has been acknowledged for self-administered survey instruments, but the significance of these factors for questionnaires administered by interviewers has not been recognized equally. This paper exam-ines two studies in which interviewers used different question-naire designs to administer the same set of survey questions to randomly selected adult respondents in housing units that made up area probability samples of the Detroit metropolitan area. The paper presents empirical evidence of specific effects (questions skipped in error, unprobed answers) directly attributable to the choice of questionnaire design. The analysis shows that question-naire design choices can either help or hurt the quality of data collected by interviewers. Furthermore, the behaviors of experi-enced and inexperienced interviewers are affected in simila...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The {{navigation}} task is a {{very demanding}} application for mobile users. The algorithms of present software solutions {{are based on the}} established methods of car navigation systems and thus exhibit some inherent disadvantages: findings in spatial cognition research have shown that human users need landmarks for an easy and successful wayfinding. Typically, however, an object is not a landmark per se, but can be one relative to its environment. Unfortunately, these objects are not part of route guidance information systems at the moment. Therefore, it is an aim of research to make landmarks for <b>routing</b> <b>instructions</b> available. In this paper we focus on a method to automatically derive landmarks from existing spatial databases. Here a new approach is presented to investigate existing spatial databases and try to extract landmarks automatically by use of a knowledge discovery process and data mining methods. In this paper two different algorithms, the classification method ID 3 and the clustering procedure Cobweb, are investigated, whether they are suitable for discovering landmarks. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{present a}} novel {{framework}} for the automatic generation of tourist brochures that include <b>routing</b> <b>instructions</b> and additional information presented {{in the form of}} so-called detail lenses. The first contribution of this paper is the automatic creation of layouts for the brochures. Our approach is based on the minimization of an energy function that combines multiple goals: positioning of the lenses {{as close as possible to}} the corresponding region shown in an overview map, keeping the number of lenses low, and an efficient numbering of the lenses. The second contribution is a route-aware simplification of the graph of streets used for traveling between the points of interest (POIs). This is done by reducing the graph consisting of all shortest paths through the minimization of an energy function. The output is a subset of street segments that enable traveling between all the POIs without considerable detours, while at the same time guaranteeing a clutter-free visualization. © 2014 The Author(s) Computer Graphics Forum © 2014 The Eurographics Association and John Wiley & Sons Ltd.

30|$|A third {{possibility}} is area (random route) sampling. Before 2000, when not every household possessed a telephone, {{in particular in}} the eastern parts of Germany, a good approximation of {{a random sample of}} the population was achieved by contacting subjects directly in their homes guided by <b>routing</b> <b>instructions.</b> This is still so, and it works for the population with migration background. Given a proportion of 22.5 % of all inhabitants, 14 that group is well represented in the resulting samples, without any special measures, and with a manageable screening effort, which is inverse to the proportion of the population. But as soon as country-specific groups are to be identified, such samples become highly inefficient. For example, for every person of Italian origin (population in Germany 780, 000), 128 contacts would be required. Concentrating fieldwork in areas with higher proportions of the target group is less efficient in Germany than in other countries because immigrants here are comparatively unsegregated (Schönwälder & Söhn, 2009). Without large budgets, immigrant samples using random walk will result in poor sample quality.|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} addresses {{two classes}} of network flow problems in networks with multiple, stochastic and time-varying attributes.

Moreover, this paper focuses on metroplex routing algorithm. The authors establish a network model and develop the routing algorithm for flexible flights which fly from their original airports to destination metroplexes based on the model. The routing algorithm is performed under the sector congestion constraint. A metroplex consists of several airports around a metropolitan area instead of one single airport. As a flexible flight follows the metroplex <b>routing</b> <b>instructions</b> and approaches the decision boundary of the metroplex, a scheduler in the Multi-center Traffic Management Advisor (McTMA) will decide which runway of which airport the flight will land in.

30|$|A {{sustainable}} business model depends on well-designed revenue and cost structures [17]. Thanks to the asset-light infrastructure and operational flexibilities of CL, many authors presume a minimisation of costs [14, 21, 41]. This implies that, {{as opposed to}} traditional LSPs, no warehouses, vehicle fleet or employed drivers are required [14]. Nevertheless, an appropriate revenue model needs {{to take account of}} the additional costs, such as insurance, software development, training, <b>routing</b> <b>instructions,</b> GPS devices and packets for shipments [2]. Designing an effective cost model is a major challenge. It is determined based on crowd characteristics, such as the transport flows, motivation and modal choice [11]. Existing CL platforms employ different strategies to incentivise the crowd. The interviewed practitioners also raised a number of possible applications. Individuals that move dedicatedly or make large detours can be compensated more and monetary, rewarding their flexibility. Vice versa, persuading the crowd to bring along parcels on existing trips could require less earnings or incentives of non-monetary nature. Essentially, addressing the crowd’s motivation is paramount. Similar considerations can be made regarding their modal choice. A platform can choose to connect crowd incentives with their chosen vehicle type. For example, more sustainable, more flexible or more spacious vehicles and the costs they bring along (such as fuel costs) can be compensated.|$|E
