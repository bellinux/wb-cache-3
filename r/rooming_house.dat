5|$|In {{the early}} 1880s, {{unmarried}} sisters Catherine and Margaret Flannagan ran a <b>rooming</b> <b>house</b> at 5 Skirving Street, Liverpool. The household {{in the final}} months of 1880 consisted of the two sisters, Catherine's son John, and two lodger families – hod carrier Thomas Higgins and his daughter Mary, and Patrick Jennings and his daughter Margaret. John Flannagan, 22 and previously healthy, died suddenly in December 1880. His death did not raise any particular comment; Catherine collected £71 (worth roughly £ in 2012 pounds) from the burial society with {{which he had been}} registered and he was interred shortly thereafter.|$|E

5|$|On 3 December 1938, 11 {{years after}} they had first met, Julia married Alf after proposing to him. They were married in the Bolton Street Register Office, and Julia wrote 'cinema usherette' on the {{marriage}} certificate as her occupation, {{even though she had}} never been one. None of Julia's family were there, but Alf's brother Sydney acted as a witness. They spent their honeymoon eating at 'Reece's' restaurant in Clayton Square (which is where his son would later celebrate after his marriage to Cynthia Powell), and then went to a cinema.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we connect {{existing}} work on <b>rooming</b> <b>houses</b> to literature {{dealing with the}} meaningful nature of 'home' {{and its impact on}} individuals' health and social well-being. We then examine the extent to which <b>rooming</b> <b>houses</b> provide low-income tenants with 'homes', drawing from in-depth interviews with rooming-house tenants living in Hamilton, a city of 450 000 people in southern Ontario, Canada. Our analysis raises concerns about the capacity of <b>rooming</b> <b>houses</b> to provide affordable and stable accommodation. Poor living conditions and poor relations with rooming-house landlords worked directly against the capacity of rooms to offer private, controllable spaces and a degree of ontological security. Analysis also raised concerns about <b>rooming</b> <b>houses</b> as sites for social relations. Many respondents saw <b>rooming</b> <b>houses</b> as unpredictable and sometimes unhealthy social spaces, forcing them to seek other environments to cultivate and sustain relationships with friends and family. In general, respondents' experiences point to the shortcomings of <b>rooming</b> <b>houses</b> as 'home' environments, with implications for the health and social lives of the tenant population. Conceptual and policy implications are discussed in conclusion. ...|$|R
50|$|There {{have been}} {{multiple}} theories {{on why the}} four <b>room</b> <b>house</b> construction was so popular. Architectural analysis can {{be made of the}} residential units by the way they are grouped, the relationship between structures, their size, internal divisions, and the size and structure of the families that inhabited them. Various points can be made about the four <b>room</b> <b>house</b> pertaining to the culture of their inhabitants. Disparity in house sizes and build quality within towns seem to be a result of socio-economic stratification within cities. Four <b>roomed</b> <b>houses</b> are found in isolation or built in clusters of grouped units. It can be observed that smaller urban houses, that shared walls between, them were most likely inhabited by nuclear families, while the larger stand-alone houses belonged to extended and wealthy families such as the urban elite. Through the analysis of space syntax within the four <b>room</b> <b>house,</b> {{it can be said that}} the four <b>room</b> <b>house</b> reflects an egalitarian ideology. The typical four <b>room</b> <b>house</b> had a layout where all the inner rooms were directly accessible from the house’s central space, suggesting that all rooms were equal and there was no hierarchy to the space. The four <b>room</b> <b>house</b> was unlike the typical Canaanite-Phoenician dwelling had a layout where some rooms could be entered only by passing through other rooms, which showed a hierarchy of access.|$|R

5000|$|A four <b>room</b> <b>house,</b> {{also known}} as an [...] "Israelite house" [...] or a [...] "pillared house" [...] is the name given to the mud and stone houses {{characteristic}} of the Iron Age of Levant. Although sometimes considered particularly Israelite, they are also found in non-Israelite sites.(A. Mazar, 1985a: 67-8; Finkclstein, 1988: 237-59)." [...] Their origins are uncertain. The house's inhabitants lived on the second floor, the ground floor {{being used as a}} stable for livestock, and for storage. The four <b>room</b> <b>house</b> is so named because its floor plan, divided into four sections; it is also sometimes called a pillared house because three ground-level [...] "rooms" [...] are separated by two rows of wood pillars holding up the second floor. The pillars, however, are not the defining feature of the four <b>roomed</b> <b>house,</b> and this error of terminology leads to the confusion of four <b>roomed</b> <b>houses</b> with other buildings such as storehouses and stables, where pillars were widely used, but which were not constructed under the four <b>room</b> <b>house</b> layout.|$|R

Speck {{did not have enough}} money for a <b>rooming</b> <b>house,</b> so he dropped off his bags six blocks east at the Manor Shell filling station at 9954 S.

25|$|Three {{photos of}} unknown {{provenance}} are often {{reported to be}} of Holliday, some of them supposedly taken by C.S. Fly in Tombstone, but sometimes reported to have been taken in Dallas. Holliday lived in a <b>rooming</b> <b>house</b> in front of Fly's photography studio. Many individuals share similar facial features, and the faces of people who look radically different can look similar when viewed from certain angles. Because of this, most museum staff, knowledgeable researchers, and collectors require provenance or a documented history for an image to support physical similarities that might exist. Experts rarely offer even a tentative identification of new or unique images of famous people based solely on similarities shared with other known images.|$|E

25|$|Marshall ran a congenial court; {{there was}} seldom any bickering. The Court met in Washington {{only two months}} a year, from the first Monday in February through {{the second or third}} week in March. Six months of the year the justices were doing circuit duty in the various states. Marshall was {{therefore}} based in Richmond, his hometown, for most of the year. When the Court was in session in Washington, the justices boarded together in the same <b>rooming</b> <b>house,</b> avoided outside socializing, and discussed each case intently among themselves. Decisions were quickly made usually in a matter of days. Marshall wrote nearly half the decisions during his 34 years in office. Lawyers appearing before the court, including the most brilliant in the United States, typically gave oral arguments and often did not present written briefs. The justices did not have clerks, so they listened closely to the oral arguments, and decided among themselves what the decision should be. The court issued only one decision; the occasional dissenter usually did not issue a separate opinion.|$|E
