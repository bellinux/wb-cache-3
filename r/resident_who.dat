40|$|Rationale and Objectives A {{survey was}} {{administered}} to fourth-year radiology residents after receiving their results from the first American Board of Radiology (ABR) Core examination in 2013. The purpose was to gather information regarding resources and study strategies to share with program directors and future resident classes. Materials and Methods An online survey was distributed to examinees nationwide. The survey included free-response and multiple choice questions that covered examination results, perceived value of enumerated study resources, case-based and didactic teaching conferences, board reviews, study materials for noninterpretive skills, multidisciplinary conference attendance, and free-form comments. Results Two hundred sixty-six of 1186 <b>residents</b> <b>who</b> took the Core examination responded to the survey. Some resources demonstrated {{a significant difference in}} perceived value between <b>residents</b> <b>who</b> passed the examination and <b>residents</b> <b>who</b> failed, including internal board reviews (1. 10, P <. 01), daily didactic conferences (1. 51, P <. 01), and daily case conferences (1. 43, P <. 01). <b>Residents</b> <b>who</b> passed reported that conferences and review sessions at their institutions were modified with multiple choice questions, audience response, and integration of clinical physics and patient safety topics compared to <b>residents</b> <b>who</b> failed. Conclusions Radiology residents and residency programs have adapted their preparations for the ABR Core examination in a variety of ways. Certain practices and study tools, including daily conferences and internal board reviews, had greater perceived value by <b>residents</b> <b>who</b> passed the examination than by <b>residents</b> <b>who</b> failed. This survey provides insights {{that can be used to}} assess and modify current preparation strategies for the ABR Core examination...|$|R

5|$|The five {{characters}} who are first {{introduced in the}} series premiere, as surgical interns, are Grey, Karev, O'Malley, Stevens, and Yang. They are initially mentored by Bailey, a senior <b>resident</b> <b>who</b> becomes the hospital's Chief Resident, and later an attending general surgeon, in season six. The surgical program is initially headed by the Chief of Surgery, Richard Webber, who has a pre-existing personal relationship with Meredith, having {{had an affair with}} her mother when Meredith was a child. In Webber's employ are attending neurosurgeon Derek Shepherd, dubbed 'McDreamy' by the residents, and attending cardiothoracic surgeon Preston Burke. Shepherd is introduced as Meredith's love interest, while Burke begins a relationship with Yang.|$|E
5|$|The series follows Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), the {{daughter}} of an esteemed general surgeon named Ellis Grey, following her acceptance into the residency program at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital. During her time as a resident, Grey works alongside fellow doctors Cristina Yang (Sandra Oh), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), and George O'Malley (T. R. Knight), who each struggle to balance their personal lives with the hectic work and training schedules. They are overseen during their internship by Miranda Bailey (Chandra Wilson), a senior <b>resident</b> <b>who</b> works for attending Derek Shepherd (Patrick Dempsey), the head of neurosurgery and Meredith's love interest; Preston Burke (Isaiah Washington), the head of cardio who becomes Yang's fiancee; and Richard Webber (James Pickens, Jr.), the Chief of Surgery and attending general surgeon, and lover of Ellis Grey decades ago. The residents are later joined by Jackson Avery (Jesse Williams) and April Kepner (Sarah Drew), former Mercy-West residents who join Seattle Grace following an administrative merger in the sixth season. Throughout the first six seasons, Burke, O'Malley and Stevens all depart the series. In addition to Webber, Burke, and Shepherd, the surgical wing is primarily supervised by Addison Montgomery (Kate Walsh), as head of OB/GYN, neonatal, and fetal surgery; Callie Torres (Sara Ramirez), a <b>resident</b> <b>who</b> later becomes head of orthopedic surgery, who left Seattle {{at the end of the}} twelfth season; Mark Sloan (Eric Dane), as head of plastics; Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), as head of trauma; Arizona Robbins (Jessica Capshaw), as head of pediatric surgery, and later head of fetal surgery; Erica Hahn (Brooke Smith), as head of cardio; Teddy Altman (Kim Raver), as head of cardio; and Amelia Shepherd (Caterina Scorsone), Derek's sister who is hired to replace him as head of neuro.|$|E
5|$|There {{were five}} princely states {{subordinate}} to the Madras government. They were Banganapalle, Cochin, Pudukkottai, Sandur, and Travancore. All these states had a considerable degree of internal autonomy. However, their foreign policy was completely controlled by a <b>Resident</b> <b>who</b> represented the Governor of Fort St George. In case of Banganapalle, the Resident was the District Collector of Kurnool, while the District Collector of Bellary was the Resident of Sandur. The Resident of Pudukkottai from 1800 to 1840 and 1865 to 1873, was the District Collector of Tanjore, from 1840 to 1865, the District Collector of Madura and from 1873 to 1947, the District Collector of Trichinopoly.|$|E

5|$|Canadian {{citizenship}} is typically obtained by birth in Canada or by birth or adoption abroad when {{at least one}} biological parent or adoptive parent is a Canadian citizen {{who was born in}} Canada or naturalized in Canada (and did not receive citizenship by being born outside of Canada to a Canadian citizen). It can also be granted to a permanent <b>resident</b> <b>who</b> lives in Canada for three out of four years and meets specific requirements. Canada established its own nationality law in 1946, with the enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act which took effect on January 1, 1947. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada in 2001 as Bill C-11, which replaced the Immigration Act of 1976 as the primary federal legislation regulating immigration. Prior to the conferring of legal status on Canadian citizenship, Canada's naturalization laws consisted of a multitude of Acts beginning with the Immigration Act of 1910.|$|E
5|$|The {{residential}} {{units were}} more successful, and 95% of the 263 condominiums {{were sold in}} the first four months after it opened, despite their high prices—the cost of condominiums at the tower started at $600,000 and ranged up to $12 million, with the penthouse being sold for $15 million in 1985. The tower attracted many rich and famous residents, including Johnny Carson, David Merrick, Sophia Loren, and Steven Spielberg. At least one unidentified <b>resident,</b> <b>who</b> lived on the same floor as Johnny Carson, built a private swimming pool in their unit. In total, Trump received $300 million from the sale of the condominiums, which more than offset the $200 million cost of construction. However, by 1991, Trump was already involved in lawsuits against residents: in October of that year, he successfully sued actor Pia Zadora and her husband, businessman Meshulam Riklis, to collect $1 million in unpaid rent.|$|E

40|$|Brian Jacob {{and other}} {{scholars}} {{have pointed out}} how public housing in inner city areas has affected labor supply, student achievement, {{and a sense of}} belonging. However, little research has been conducted on how such particular public housing developments have shaped political orientations among low-income residents. The purpose of this research is to understand whether or not the individuals’ experiences with public housing demolitions across Chicago have affected voting participation, civic engagement, and political interest and efficacy among African-Americans who in the past have lived or currently live in Chicago public housing. Over 35 Chicago public housing <b>residents</b> <b>who</b> were either forced to relocate or who chose to move on their own prior to federal plans for demolition were surveyed. Findings were analyzed by utilizing STATA. Evidence suggests that relocation does not impact political engagement among <b>residents</b> <b>who</b> were forced to relocate; however, analyzing mean scores of survey data that measured voting participation in the 2012 presidential election, local elections, and congressional elections in 2014, <b>residents</b> <b>who</b> were forced to relocate voted at lower levels and were likely to vote at lower rates in the 2014 congressional elections. Also, <b>residents</b> <b>who</b> were forced to relocate demonstrated more neighborhood trust and tended to do favors for their neighbors at higher levels than <b>residents</b> <b>who</b> were not forced to relocate. In addition, evidence suggest that <b>residents</b> <b>who</b> had better than average experiences with Chicago public housing were more political efficacious than <b>residents</b> <b>who</b> had worse than average experiences with public housing. This research ends with a discussion of policy implications explaining how residential mobility impacts voter turnout rates and necessary steps to resolve such issues.
