25|$|Automatic {{patterning}} machines can knit two-colour Fair Isle patterns automatically, {{and have}} machine stitch patterning {{features such as}} plating and knitweaving. Plating refers to knitting with two strands of yarn that are held {{in such a way}} that one is in front of the other. Plated effects can be particularly striking in a <b>ribbed</b> <b>fabric.</b> Knitweaving refers to a technique in which a separate piece of yarn, often heavier than the knitted fabric, is carried along and caught between stitches to produce an effect like weaving. With knitwoven fabric, the purl side (usually the wrong side) is the right side of the fabric. The fine and standard gauge models have the option of a lace carriage, where stitches can be transferred from one needle to the next. The yarn passes through a tensioning mechanism and down through the knit carriage, which feeds the yarn to the needles as they knit.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{mechanical}} properties of Milano <b>rib</b> knit <b>fabric</b> reinforced composites have been previously characterized [1 – 5]. The {{purpose of this}} paper is to theoretically pre-dict the stiffness and tensile strength of these composites. Attention has been focused on simplicity and user-friendliness. The complicated Milano <b>rib</b> knit <b>fabric</b> structure has been approximated by several simpler plain stitches, for which an analytical geometric model is applicable. After discretizing the representative volume element of the Milano fabric com-posite into sub-elements which contain only straight yarn segments, the overall stiffness and strength of the composite are obtained by assembling the contributions of a number of unidirectional fibrous composites. A recently developed micromechanics model, the bridging model [6], is applied to estimate the stiffness and strength of each unidirectional composite. The predicted stiffness and strength of the Milano fabric composites have been compared with the available experimental results. Reasonably good correlation has been found between the predictions and the experiments.

40|$|The stress {{relations}} to the <b>fabric</b> and the <b>rib</b> consequent upon {{a change of}} spacing between ribs in a wing plane are discussed. Considering the wing plane as a static structure, and ignoring the question of aerodynamic efficiency, {{it appears that the}} unit stress in the <b>rib</b> and <b>fabric</b> will remain constant for constant p if the linear dimensions of both <b>rib</b> and <b>fabric</b> are increased alike, viz., if wing and fabric remain geometrically similar. Since the bulge and the structural dimensions remain geometrically similar, the whole distended plane remains so, and hence should have the same pressure distribution and efficiency.

40|$|The {{effect of}} biaxially {{deforming}} a weft-knit Milano <b>rib</b> <b>fabric</b> {{on the overall}} composite compressive properties has been studied for a glass/vinyl-ester knitted composite. A range of combinations of wale-course stretch ratios was considered. It {{was found that the}} compression properties of these structures, on the whole, appeared to be closer to isotropic and relatively insensitive to fabric deformation. This observation is believed to be due to the dominance of the matrix properties. Despite not detecting any gross changes in the knit structure, it is believed that some redistribution and reorientation of the fibres did occur during fabric deformation, which in turn altered the relative contents and/or directionality of the fibres in the composites. A feature of the compressive failure was kinking of the highly bent yarns, particularly in resin rich regions having reduced lateral support for yarns...|$|R

Samples were produced varying the characteristics (fineness of elastane core and polyamide cover) of elastane yarns {{in order to}} investigate its influence {{on the performance of}} knitted arm sleeves. The performance of developed arm sleeves was characterized in terms of level of compression that can be achieved as well as the permanent deformation and energy dissipation, which occurs during stretching. It was observed that the compression performance improved significantly with the linear density of elastane core and the improvement is higher for finer cover yarns. However, the energy dissipation and permanent deformation in the first stretching cycle also increased with the fineness of elastane core and therefore, proper selection of elastane yarn is extremely necessary to achieve required degree of compression with minimum permanent deformation while stretching...|$|R

40|$|It is {{generally}} accepted that synthetic fibres provide high UV protection capability of textile products, while cellulose fibres have low UV absorption capacity. However, textile materials made {{of synthetic fibres}} are {{not considered to be}} comfortable for wear in warm weather, whereas cellulose-based textile materials are considered to be much more comfortable to wear, especially in the summer months. For this research, the idea was to produce specially blended knitted fabrics from staple/fi lament hybrid yarns in order to provide clothing materials with eff ective UV protection properties, keeping satisfactory comfort properties as well. To obtain hybrid yarns, folding technique was used. The Ultraviolet Protection Factor (UPF), as a quantitative measure of the eff ectiveness of the material to protect human skin against UV radiation, was determined for the <b>rib</b> knitted <b>fabrics</b> by in vitro test method according to the European standard. The physical properties of the knitted fabrics related to their UV protection properties: bulk density, porosity and air permeability were also determined. The hybrid yarns, from which the <b>rib</b> knitted <b>fabrics</b> were produced, having always hemp yarn as a staple component, caused the differences in UV protection capability of the <b>rib</b> knitted <b>fabrics</b> through the influence of a filament spun component. The hybrid yarn aggregation within knitted fabrics also fibrestheir UPF values. Even though the pure hemp knitted fabric was marked as “UPF> 50 ” (according to European standard) due to natural pigments and lignin in hemp fibres which act as UV absorbers, most of the hemp/fi lament hybrid yarn knitted fabrics exhibited even higher UPF. Therefore, the engineering approach proposed in this research was confi rmed as an eff ective way to design clothing materials with optimal UV protection capability and other wear comfort parameters...|$|R
