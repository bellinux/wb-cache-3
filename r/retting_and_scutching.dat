40|$|The {{falling weight}} impact {{properties}} of composites obtained by introducing 16 wt% of phormium tenax fibres extracted with two different methods i. e., either manually or by paddocking <b>and</b> <b>scutching</b> <b>and</b> {{in both cases}} chemically treated with a 1 % solution of sodium hydroxide, have been investigated. The effect of the two extraction methods on fibre characteristics is compared by the tensile properties of the fibres and the flexural properties, fracture modes and hysteresis cycles parameters (impact energy partition, linear stiffness and normalised penetration energy) of final laminates. Laminates obtained using paddocked <b>and</b> <b>scutched</b> fibres are clearly superior to those manufactured using the manually extracted fibres: {{this is due to}} the more effective fibre impregnation in the former case than in the latter, which results in an improved dissipation of energy during the damping phase of the impact event. It is noteworthy, however, that the low volume of fibres introduced in the laminate with the manufacturing method adopted does not allow obtaining properties comparable with other semi-structural plant fibre composites, such as e. g., hemp fibre reinforced laminates...|$|R

Westerhuis, W. (2016) Hemp for textiles: plant size matters, PhD thesis. Wageningen University, Wageningen, The Netherlands, 234 pp. With English and Dutch summaries.   Fibre hemp (Cannabis sativa L.) {{may be an}} alternative to cotton and synthetic fibres as a raw material for textile yarn production in the European Union. The agronomic options to manipulate plant development and crop growth with the aim to optimise hemp long fibre production were investigated. Field trials with factors sowing density, sowing date, harvest time and variety were conducted. Stems were traditionally processed by <b>retting,</b> drying, breaking, <b>and</b> <b>scutching.</b> Following standard protocols, almost 1500 hemp stem samples were analysed. Varieties differ widely in their fibre content, but this thesis shows that when variety and plant size are known, the amounts of fibres, wood, <b>and</b> <b>retting</b> losses are known. The dry weight of the stems at harvest, not the factors underlying this weight, are determinant. In retted stems the dry matter is split–up into fibres and wood in a fixed way. The options to manipulate this ratio by crop management, given variety, are very small and for practical reasons they can be neglected. In fibre hemp two bast fibre types occur. Primary or long fibres are valuable for yarn spinning. Secondary fibres are too short and their presence hampers the production of fine yarns. This thesis shows that the secondary fibre front height increases with plant weight. Although a causal relationship between secondary fibre formation and flowering does not exist, the secondary fibre front is found higher in flowering plants when compared to non–flowering plants of the same height. This {{is likely to be}} caused by the higher weight or momentum of flowering plants as compared with non–flowering plants of the same height. Consequently, a harvest before flowering is preferable. This was shown in a greenhouse experiment, in which the short–day response of hemp was used to create size ranges of flowering and non–flowering plants. To produce high–quality raw materials for textile production, short crops should be grown. The options to produce plants with the desired size are manifold. Since sowing density, sowing date, and harvest time do not have an additional effect on the primary fibre content besides the indirect effect through stem weight, any combination of these factors could be chosen to optimize plant size.    ...|$|R

Biological evaluation was at 5, 8 and 11 % protein level in growing rats by measuring biological value (BV), net protein utilization (NPU) and nitrogen efficiency for growth (NEG) over a 14 -day period. A 28 -day protein efficiency ratio (PER) was determined on the same products at 10 % protein level. Effects of added lactose on PER of retentate, regular and UFCC were also evaluated. The most limiting amino acids were cystine + methionine. Amino acid score for Animal Nutrition Research Council (ANRC) reference casein, SM, RCC, <b>Ret</b> <b>and</b> UFCC was 0. 72, 0. 91, 0. 87, 0. 91 and 0. 98 respectively according to Food and Agricultural Organization/World Health Organization (FAO/WHO) pattern and 0. 45, 0. 56, 0. 54, 0. 57 and 0. 61 respectively according to whole egg pattern. PER was 2. 7, 3. 0, 2. 7, 3. 1 and 2. 8 for ANRC reference casein, SM, RCC, <b>Ret</b> <b>and</b> UFCC respectively. PER for retentate and skimmilk were {{significantly different from the}} cottage cheese. No significant difference in protein quality was obtained when the products were fed at 5, 8 and 11 % levels. Average BV was 93, 91, 91, 95 and 94 for ANRC reference casein, SM, RCC, <b>Ret</b> <b>and</b> UFCC respectively. Average NPU was 87, 84, 83, 85 and 85 for ANRC reference casein, SM.

PER values were 2. 7, 3. 0, 2. 7, 3. 1 and 2. 8 for ANRC reference casein, SM, RCC, <b>Ret</b> <b>and</b> UFCC respectively. Addition of lactose to a level equal to that in skimmilk reduced the PER value of RCC, <b>Ret</b> <b>and</b> UFCC by about 4 %, 6 % and 4 % respectively.

40|$|Neurturin (NTN) is a {{neurotrophic}} factor that shares homology with glial cell line-derived {{neurotrophic factor}} (GDNF). Recently, a receptor complex {{has been identified}} for GDNF that includes the Ret tyrosine kinase receptor and a glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein termed “GDNFRα. ” However, differences in the phenotype of <b>Ret</b> <b>and</b> GDNF knockout animals suggest that Ret {{has at least one}} additional ligand. In this report, we demonstrate that NTN induces Ret phosphorylation in primary cultures of rat superior cervical ganglion (SCG) neurons. NTN also caused Ret phosphorylation in fibroblasts that were transfected stably with <b>Ret</b> <b>and</b> GDNFRα but not in cells expressing Ret alone. A glycosylphosphatidylinositol-linked protein also was important for NTN and GDNF signaling in SCG neurons; phosphatidylinositol-specific phospholipase C treatment of SCG cultures reduced the ability of NTN to phosphorylate <b>Ret</b> <b>and</b> the ability of NTN or GDNF to activate the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway. NTN and GDNF also caused sustained activation of <b>Ret</b> <b>and</b> the mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway in SCG neurons. Finally, both NTN and GDNF activated the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase pathway in SCG neurons, which may be important for the ability of NTN and GDNF to promote neuronal survival. These data indicate that NTN is a physiologically relevant ligand for the <b>Ret</b> receptor <b>and</b> suggest that NTN may have a critical {{role in the development of}} many neuronal populations...|$|R
40|$|Glial cell line-derived {{neurotrophic}} factor (GDNF) is a ligand that activates, through coreceptor GDNF family receptor alpha- 1 (GFR alpha 1) and {{receptor tyrosine kinase}} "RET ", several signaling pathways crucial {{in the development and}} sustainment of multiple neuronal populations.

Using the baculovirus expression system, we expressed and purified Danio rerio <b>RET,</b> <b>and</b> its binding partners GFRa 1 and GDNF, <b>and</b> Drosophila melanogaster <b>RET</b> <b>and</b> two isoforms of coreceptor GDNF receptor-like.

We also report the first measurements of the affinity of the complex to RET in solution: at least for zebrafish, the Kd for GFR alpha 1 -GDNF binding RET is 5. 9 mu M. Surprisingly, we also found that zebrafish GDNF as well as zebrafish GFRa 1 robustly activated human <b>RET</b> signaling <b>and</b> promoted the survival of cultured mouse dopaminergic neurons with comparable efficiency to mammalian GDNF, unlike E. coli-produced human proteins.

We combined mutation analysis with functional assays to determine the frequencies of proven pathogenic <b>RET</b> <b>and</b> EDNRB mutations in HSCR. We sequenced <b>RET</b> <b>and</b> EDNRB in 57 HSCR patients. The identified RET-coding variants were introduced into <b>RET</b> constructs <b>and</b> these were transfected into HEK 293 cells to determine <b>RET</b> phosphorylation <b>and</b> activation via ERK.

Western blotting showed that three coding variants p. (Pr 270 Leu), p. (Ala 756 Val) and p. (Tyr 1062 Cys) resulted in lower activation of RET. Moreover, only two RET variants (p.
