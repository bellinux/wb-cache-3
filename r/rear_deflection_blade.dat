The compressor was instrumented with non-invasive laser light probes to measure changes in time of arrival of all the blades, relative to an expected arrival time.

40|$|The dynamic {{behavior}} of intermeshing rotor blades {{is complex and}} subjected to rotor-rotor-interactions like oblique blade-vortex and blade-wake interactions.

On each blade, {{there will be one}} UWB <b>blade</b> <b>deflection</b> sensing system, which consists of two UWB antennas at the blade root and one UWB antenna at the blade tip. The detailed topology and challenges of this deflection sensing system are addressed. Due to the complexity of the problem, this paper will first realize the on-blade UWB radio link in the simplest case, where the tip antenna is situated outside (and on the surface of) a blade tip. To investigate this case, full-blade time-domain measurements are designed and conducted under different deflections. The detailed measurement setups and results are provided. If the root and tip antenna locations are properly selected, the first pulse is always of sufficient quality for accurate estimations under different deflections.

40|$|Currently, the {{majority}} of fiber-optic blade instrumentation is being designed and manufactured by aircraft-engine companies for their own use. The most commonly employed probe for optical <b>blade</b> <b>deflection</b> measurements is the spot probe. One of its characteristics is that the incident spot on a blade is not fixed relative to the blade, but changes depending on the blade deformation associated with centrifugal and aerodynamic loading. While there are geometrically more complicated optical probe designs in use by different engine companies, this paper offers an alternate solution derived from a probe-mount design feature that allows one to change the probe axial position until the incident spot contacts either a leading or a trailing edge. By tracing the axial position of either blade edge one is essentially extending the deflection measurement to two dimensions, axial and tangential.

40|$|In {{an effort}} to improve the {{reliability}} and decrease the cost of wind energy, an approach is presented that monitors the static and dynamic loading to wind turbine rotor blades {{with the goal of}} reducing maintenance costs and providing the input to future active control smart turbine blades. A set of uniaxial and triaxial DC accelerometers were successfully installed within a 9 m CX- 100 turbine blade fabricated by TPI composites. Sensors were located in regions that maximized spatial observability based on previous modal tests. DC accelerometers were used in the blade to monitor both constant acceleration and dynamic acceleration. The rotation of the blade at each sensor location was determined by the magnitude of the centripetal acceleration, which leaked into the flap acceleration measurement as the blade was deformed. The estimates of the blade rotation at sensor locations were used to estimate <b>blade</b> tip <b>deflection</b> for the case when a priori tip deflection and rotation data was available and for the case when data was not available. The case when data was available a priori produced the smallest error in estimation, but the non-data-fitted <b>blade</b> <b>deflection</b> method showed the <b>blade</b> <b>deflection</b> along the entire span. For both methods the 6. 5 m sensor was the best single sensor estimator and the 2 m and 8 m sensor combination was the best double sensor estimator.

40|$|The blade {{behavior}} in the outer-blade slicing has been analyzed by computer simulation to clarify the machining mechanism. The main results obtained are as follows.

40|$|Due to the {{increasing}} size and flexibility of large wind turbine blades, accurate and reliable aeroelastic modelling is playing an important role {{for the design of}} large wind turbines. Most existing aeroelastic models are linear models based on assumption of small <b>blade</b> <b>deflections.</b> This assumption is not valid anymore for very flexible blade design because such blades often experience large deflections. In this paper, a novel nonlinear aeroelastic model for large wind turbine blades has been developed by combining BEM (blade element momentum) theory and mixed-form formulation of GEBT (geometrically exact beam theory). The nonlinear aeroelastic model takes account of large <b>blade</b> <b>deflections</b> and thus greatly improves the accuracy of aeroelastic analysis of wind turbine blades. The nonlinear aeroelastic model is implemented in COMSOL Multiphysics and validated with a series of benchmark calculation tests. The results show that good agreement is achieved when compared with experimental data, and its capability of handling large deflections is demonstrated.

40|$|Case-mounted fiber-optic sensors {{have been}} used by {{aircraft}} engine manufacturers mainly to monitor blade vibration in fans and compressors. The simplest probe arrangement is a spot probe where, typically, a center fiber transmits laser light, and the outer fibers collect the reflected light from the blade tips and transmit it to a photodetector. Because the spot of incident light is fixed in space, whereas the blade deflects dynamically, the reflected light will originate from slightly different portions of the blade tip under different operating conditions. Unless corrections are developed to compensate for this effect, some error in vibratory tangential amplitude will occur. For monitoring vibrations, this error is usually not critical. However, when steady-state <b>blade</b> <b>deflections</b> are being measured, {{it is very important to}} fix the spot on the blade tip at a particular location because the operating speed <b>blade</b> <b>deflections</b> are evaluated against a low-speed reference run. The change in speed usually implies a significant change in the blade orientation and possibly its shape brought about by the aerodynamic and centrifugal loading. It is most convenient to select the blade s leading and trailing edges as the fixed points for which deflections will be evaluated. To capture the blade edges at various speeds, the light probe must be movable. This was achieved by mounting the probe in an eccentric hole in a bushing that fit the fan case in the region that overlapped the path of the blade edge. The probe was actuated to search for a blade edge while all the blades were viewed on an oscilloscope. The blade edge was considered to be captured when a pulse associated with a particular blade was significantly reduced in magnitude but was clearly distinguishable from the background noise level. By tracing the axial position of either blade edge, one could extend the deflection measurement to two dimensions: axial and tangential.

(2) The difference between the maximum values of F_z under the different conditions of γ_s (γ_s denotes the average half-tip angle of the abrasive grains on the blade side face) decreases with an increase in α. (3) A moderate value of a decreases the maximum <b>blade</b> <b>deflection</b> D_B largely, while too large a value of a increases D_B due to lessening of the flexural rigidity of the blade.
