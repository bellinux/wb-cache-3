Many of them were mixed blood Afro-Portuguese sailors who found the brown-skinned Native Hawaiians free of <b>racial</b> <b>bias</b> towards them. The first Portuguese plantation labor emigration to Hawaii came from the Azores and Madeira in 1878, starved out of their homelands by widespread grape vine fungus. They emigrated mostly in family groups, joining an established community of their own culture.|$|E
5|$|The defections to the Mexican {{league and}} the threat of a strike by the Pirates {{prompted}} owners to form an advisory committee, chaired by Larry MacPhail, to suggest needed changes that would calm the discontent among the players. On August 27, 1946, the committee presented a draft a document outlining the changes. Language in the original draft admitted that baseball was operating as a monopoly and that <b>racial</b> <b>bias</b> was the sole reason for segregation in baseball. Baseball's attorneys stripped this controversial language from the version eventually adopted by the owners.|$|E
5|$|There are {{potential}} problems when the MSE is applied in a cross-cultural context, when the clinician and patient are from different cultural backgrounds. For example, the patient's culture might have different norms for appearance, behavior and display of emotions. Culturally normative spiritual and religious beliefs {{need to be}} distinguished from delusions and hallucinations - these may seem similar to one who does not understand that they have different roots. Cognitive assessment must also take the patient's language and educational background into account. Clinician's <b>racial</b> <b>bias</b> is another potential confounder.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine how neural {{correlates}} of implicit <b>racial</b> <b>biases</b> are affected by racial-bias interventions. Previous research shows that both a negative going ERP peak related to conflict detection and behavioral control (the ERN) and a positive going peak involved in categorization and attention cognitive processes (the P 300) in response to self-other conflicts. After completing two interventions, the Imagined Perspective Task and the Joystick Task, which have been shown to decrease <b>racial</b> <b>biases,</b> participants then completed two tasks that measured implicit biases, the Weapons Identification Task (WIT) and the Oddball Task. Results did not show significant effects of bias-reduction training on amplitude of the P 300 and ERN. However, both the oddball and WIT produced racially biased patterns in the group as a whole, seen in priming effects in WIT and effects of face race type in the Oddball Task. Additionally, unexpected results were witnessed in the P 2 peak; a peak involved in cognitive processing that is affected by attention. Further research should be conducted on multiple intervention techniques and their effect in implicit <b>racial</b> <b>biases,</b> and the effect of the P 2, P 300 and ERN in implicit <b>racial</b> <b>biases</b> of many different people...|$|R
40|$|We {{examined}} whether implicit {{stereotypes of}} younger Black men as physically threatening extend to older Black men. In Experiment 1, participants categorized objects as weapons or tools, following briefly presented prime images {{of men who}} varied in age (younger, older) and race (Black, White). In Experiment 2, we used new prime images of younger and older Black and White men, and participants categorized words as threatening or safe. Results revealed robust <b>racial</b> <b>biases</b> in object and word identification, replicating prior research: Threatening stimuli were more quickly and accurately identified after Black primes, whereas non-threatening stimuli were more quickly and accurately identified after White primes. Process-dissociation analyses further indicated that these effects were entirely driven by <b>racial</b> <b>biases</b> in automatic processing. Prime age did not moderate any of these effects, suggesting that implicit threat-based <b>racial</b> <b>biases</b> commonly evoked by younger Black men appear to extend to older Black men...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe present {{research}} {{examined the effects}} of egocentric motivations on individuals' explanations for how their automatic racial prejudices came into being. The majority of participants reported experiencing biased thoughts, feelings, and gut reactions toward minorities which they found difficult to consciously control, and they attributed such biases to cultural socialization. Of particular interest, ego-threatened participants {{were significantly more likely to}} attribute their automatic <b>racial</b> <b>biases</b> to their culture and significantly less likely to attribute such biases to themselves. Results suggest that attributing one's <b>racial</b> <b>biases</b> to cultural socialization can be a defensive, motivated process aimed at diminishing personal responsibility...|$|R
40|$|The {{presumption}} of innocence {{and the right to}} a fair trial lie {{at the core of the}} United States justice system. While existing rules and practices serve to uphold these principles, the administration of justice is significantly compromised by a covert but influential factor: namely, implicit <b>racial</b> <b>biases.</b> These biases can lead to automatic associations between race and guilt, as well as impact the way in which judges and jurors interpret information throughout a trial. Despite the well-documented presence of implicit <b>racial</b> <b>biases,</b> few steps have been taken to ameliorate the problem in the courtroom setting. This Article discusses the potential of virtual reality to reduce these biases among judges and jurors. Through analyzing the various ethical and legal considerations, this Article contends that implementing virtual reality training with judges and jurors would be justifiable and advisable should effective means become available. Given that implicit <b>racial</b> <b>biases</b> can seriously undermine the fairness of the justice system, this Article ultimately asserts that unconventional de-biasing methods warrant legitimate attention and consideration...|$|R

40|$|Historical {{relationships}} between African Americans and wilderness {{have been largely}} overlooked by scholars. This project analyzes the role of race in existing wilderness scholarship and the historical {{relationships between}} African Americans and wilderness. Wilderness scholarship from the 1960 s to the 1990 s is analyzed. African Americans, Asian Americans, and Latinos are almost entirely absent from the scholarship. Native Americans receive some attention {{with varying degrees of}} sophistication. Whites are almost exclusively the subject of the literature. These <b>racial</b> <b>biases</b> impact the scholarship in several ways. Scholars make universalized assertions which leave out much of the population. The reasons for and meanings of attitudes towards cities, cultural significance of savagery, and reasons for criticisms of wilderness ideas are poorly interpreted and misleadingly described. <b>Racial</b> <b>biases</b> also tend to reproduce themselves over time and in the environmental movement. A variety of African American relationships with wilderness were found. These perspectives and experiences were traced from slavery through Reconstruction and into Jim Crow. Themes during slavery were wilderness as refuge, testing ground, location for spiritual and religious practice, and subsistenc...|$|R
25|$|United States v. Dellinger, (1972): CCR {{attorneys}} William Kunstler and Leonard Weinglass {{defended the}} “Chicago 8,” {{a group of}} social movement figures arrested following the 1968 Democratic National Convention demonstrations and consequent police repression. The eight defendants: including David Dellinger, Rennie Davis, Tom Hayden, Abbie Hoffman, Jerry Rubin, and Bobby Seale, were anti-war, civil rights and human rights activists, and Students for a Democratic Society and Black Panther Party members. The eight were found not guilty of their conspiracy charges, but five were found guilty of crossing state lines to incite a riot. The Center appealed and ultimately overturned these charges, based on the judge's bias and the refusal of the court to screen jurors for possible cultural and/or <b>racial</b> <b>bias.</b>|$|E
25|$|On 2 April 2004, Zimbabwe {{announced}} that test captain Heath Streak had resigned the captaincy and retired from cricket.

The fellow white players submitted a list of demands to Zimbabwe Cricket, including the reinstatement of Streak and a review of the team selection process with a view to eliminating political and <b>racial</b> <b>bias</b> imposed by the Mugabe government. The ZC ignored the demands and fielded a team of inexperienced youths in two Tests and three One Day Internationals against the touring Sri Lankan side.

25|$|In 2013, {{the school}} board voted to close three schools, Clearlake middle school, Gardendale Elementary Magnet School, and South Lake {{elementary}} school prompting a large public outcry. The school board proposed the closings and limited public input by holding required public meetings during the 2012 holiday season.

50|$|Covert {{racism is}} a form of racial {{discrimination}} that is disguised and subtle, rather than public or obvious. Concealed in the fabric of society, covert racism discriminates against individuals through often unnoticeable or seemingly passive methods. Covert, racially biased decisions are often hidden or rationalized with an explanation that society is more willing to accept. These <b>racial</b> <b>biases</b> cause a variety of problems that work to empower the suppressors while diminishing the rights and powers of the oppressed. Covert racism often works subliminally, and often much of the discrimination is being done subconsciously.|$|R
