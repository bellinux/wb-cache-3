The cooling technological streams of gas and oil refineries, including air coolers, water cooling and refrigeration systems for specific refrigerants are {{the objectives of the}} present study. Improvement of the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>unit</b> with refrigerant separation into fractions is mandatory in order to increase cooling capacity, lowering the boiling point of coolant and increasing the coefficient of target hydrocarbons extraction from the associated gas flow. In this paper it is shown that cooling temperature plays significant role in low-temperature condensation process. Two operation modes for <b>refrigeration</b> <b>unit</b> were proposed: permanent, in which the concentration of the refrigerant mixture does not change and dynamic, in which the concentration of refrigerant mixtures depends on the ambient temperature. Based on the analysis of exergy losses the optimal concentration of refrigerant mixtures propane/ethane for both modes of operation of the <b>refrigeration</b> <b>unit</b> has been determined. On the basis of the conducted pinch-analysis the modification of <b>refrigeration</b> <b>unit</b> with refrigerant separation into fractions was developed.

Soon after, mechanical <b>refrigeration</b> <b>units</b> replaced the [...] "armies" [...] of personnel required to re-ice the cars. The plug door was introduced experimentally by P.F.E. (Pacific Fruit Express) in April 1947, when one of their R-40-10 series cars, #42626, was equipped with one. P.F.E.'s R-40-26 series reefers, designed in 1949 and built in 1951, were the first production series cars to be so equipped. In addition, the Santa Fe Railroad first used plug doors on their SFRD RR-47 series cars, which were also built in 1951. This type of door provided a larger six foot opening to facilitate car loading and unloading. These tight-fitting doors were better insulated and could maintain an even temperature inside the car.

2500|$|The {{first attempt}} to ship {{refrigerated}} meat from Australasia was made when the Northam sailed from Australia to the England in 1876; however the refrigeration machinery broke down en route and so the cargo was lost. Later that year chilled beef was sent from the United States to England (a shorter journey, at cooler, higher latitudes) and, although spoilage was high, this voyage provided some encouragement to Australian and New Zealand promoters of refrigeration. In 1877 the steamers Le Frigorifique and Paraguay carried frozen mutton from Argentina to France, proving the concept, if not the economic case, for longer-distance refrigerated shipping. In 1879 the Strathleven, equipped with compression refrigeration, sailed from Sydney with [...] of frozen beef and mutton as {{a small part of}} her cargo, and this meat arrived in good condition.

2500|$|Before the 1950s, the {{traditional}} European wine {{was made in}} small containers where the temperature did not rise high enough {{to interfere with the}} fermentation but this method of vinification gave wine structure and roundness but was not aromatic.

This mode of production happened in Europe {{at the same time as}} new techniques of treatment of the must (accelerated settling, use of selected yeasts, addition of glues and yeast enzymes, the practice of maceration). In wine jargon, all of these practices give a [...] "technological wine". This is very fragrant, crisp on the palate, and does not require ageing.
