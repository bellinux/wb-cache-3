40|$|On sandy shores, {{offshore}} obstacles create wider beaches, termed salients and tombolos, due to sediment {{deposition in}} their lee. The Authors quantified {{the shape and}} dimensions of salients formed in the lee of a natural reef and island in south Sardinia (Italy) and found that morphological results were in good agreement with previous investigations through aerial photographs of the coastlines of south eastern Australia and new Zeeland. This paper presents some preliminary results on the salient morphology and complex hydrodynamic behaviour near an island. The beach investigated in this work, known as the Tuerredda beach, is located in the south coast of Sardinia, the shoreline being characterised in the central part by a salient-shape due to the homonymous island. It is expected that the shoreline would be complex in its evolution over time due to the high variability of wave-induced currents and the <b>random</b> <b>instability</b> of the near natural mouth of a seasonally ephemeral stream...|$|E

The effects of <b>random</b> <b>instabilities</b> on range rate accuracy are shown to be describable in terms of sigma y (2, T, tau). For the typical noise processes encountered in precision oscillators, range rate error {{is related to the}} more familiar sigma y (tau) and script L (f).

40|$|Narrowband {{oscillations}} {{observed in}} the upper equa-torial Pacific are interpreted {{in terms of a}} random ensemble of shear instability events. Linear pertur-bation analysis is applied to hourly averaged profiles of velocity and density over a 54 -day interval, yield-ing a total of 337 unstable modes. Composite pro-files of mean states and eigenfunctions surrounding the critical levels suggest that the standard hyper-bolic tangent model of Kelvin-Helmholtz (KH) insta-bility is a reasonable approximation, but the symme-try of the composite perturbation is broken by the stratification and vorticity gradient of the underlying equatorial undercurrent. Unstable modes are found to occupy a range of frequencies with a peak near 1 / 700 s, consistent with the frequency content of the observed oscillations. A probabilistic theory of <b>random</b> <b>instabilities</b> pre-dicts this peak frequency very closely. An order of magnitude estimate suggests that the peak fre-quency is of order N, in accord with the observations. This results not from gravity wave physics but from the balance of shear and stratification that governs shear instability in geophysical flows. More generally, we conclude that oscillatory signals with frequency bounded by N can result from a process {{that has nothing to do}} with gravity waves. ...|$|R

The medical industry is interested to exploit especially the latter technology for a supported long-term home care. The problem is, there are only wellbeing promoting textile-integrated electronics at the moment. These products recommend for example how to prevent an injury, but do not provide the actual diagnostic value. Purpose of this master´s thesis was to increase knowledge of the biomedical instrumentation about diagnostics textile-integrated electronics – especially designed for long-term home monitoring of the elderly. For achieving this matter, into shirt integrated an electrocardiography (ECG) and impedance pneumography (IP) measurement module will be developed {{as a part of}} the Disappearing Sensors (DISSE) project. Preparation, like technical designing and functionality testing, have been made during this thesis for fulfilling described target. The functionality testing was implemented from three point of views: electrodes, measurement position, and measuring techniques for the ECG and IP. As electrodes were used commercial disposable electrodes, textile electrodes, and printed electrodes. Different measurement positions were laying, sitting, standing and walking slow and fast. As measurement techniques, 2 - and 4 -electrode measuring methods were compared by using commercial evaluation board. The work also considered a choose of the shirt and its final form in the prototype, which textile-integrated version will be completed during Autumn 2016. From electrodes the most stable results were gathered with disposal ones. However, the skin irritation caused by these electrodes is not suitable for a long-term monitoring.

40|$|We study a {{periodic}} medium driven over a random or periodic substrate. Our work {{is based on}} nonequilibrium continuum hydrodynamic equations of motion, which we derive microscopically. We argue that in the <b>random</b> case <b>instabilities</b> will always destroy the LRO of the lattice. In most, if not all, cases, the stable driven ordered state is a transverse smectic, with ordering wavevector perpendicular to the velocity. It consists of {{a periodic}} array of flowing liquid channels, with transverse displacements and density (``permeation mode'') as hydrodynamic variables. We present dynamic functional renormalization group calculations in two and three dimensions for an approximate model of the smectic. The finite temperature behavior is much less glassy than in equilibrium, owing to a disorder-driven effective ``heating'' (allowed {{by the absence of}} the fluctuation-dissipation theorem).

40|$|We analyse the {{competition}} between spin glass (SG) order and local pairing superconductivity (SC) in the fermionic Ising spin glass with frustrated fermionic spin interaction and nonrandom attractive interaction. The phase diagram is presented for all temperatures T and chemical potentials μ. SC-SG transitions are derived for the relevant ratios between attractive and frustrated-magnetic interaction. Characteristic features of pairbreaking caused by random magnetic interaction and/or by spin glass proximity are found. The existence of low-energy excitations, arising from replica permutation symmetry breaking (RPSB) in the Quantum Parisi Phase, is shown to be relevant for the SC-SG phase boundary. Complete 1 -step RPSB-calculations for the SG-phase are presented together with a few results for infinity-step breaking. Suppression of reentrant SG - SC - SG transitions due to RPSB is found and discussed in context of ferromagnet - SG boundaries. The relative positioning of the SC and SG phases presents a theoretical landmark for comparison with experiments in heavy fermion systems and high T_c superconductors. We find a crossover line traversing the SG-phase with (μ= 0,T= 0) as its quantum critical (end) point in complete RPSB, and scaling is proposed for its vicinity.

This paper applies newly developed tests for nested model that are robust to the presence of parameter instability. The empirical evidence shows that for some countries we can reject the hypothesis that exchange rates are random walks. This raises the possibility that economic models were previously rejected not because the fundamentals are completely unrelated to exchange rate fluctuations, but because the relationship is unstable over time and, thus, difficult to capture by Granger Causality tests or by forecast comparisons. We also analyze forecasts that exploit the time variation in the parameters and find that, in some cases, they can improve over the random walk. forecasting, exchange rates, parameter <b>instability,</b> <b>random</b> walks...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT The {{performance}} of a GPS/INS integration system is greatly determined by the ability of stand-alone INS system to determine position and attitude within GPS outage. The positional and attitude precision degrades rapidly during GPS outage due to INS sensor errors. With advantages of low price and volume, the Micro Electrical Mechanical Sensors (MEMS) have been wildly used in GPS/INS integration. Moreover, standalone MEMS can keep a reasonable positional precision {{only a few seconds}} due to systematic and random sensor errors.

These values can be used further in the Kalman filter for better navigation accuracy and in the Doppler frequency estimate for faster acquisition after GPS signal outage. 1...|$|R
40|$|The last decade, {{stem cell}} therapy has raised much hope to treat {{patients}} presenting {{a variety of}} end-stage diseases. These promising results are sustained by the physiologic role of stem cells in tissue development and repair. Despite the enthusiasm, essential stability questions may not be overlooked {{and need to be}} assessed on the route to clinic. In the present study, we analyzed, both in vitro and in vivo, the phenotype and genotype stability of stem/progenitor cells issued from human bone marrow, Wharton jelly and liver during long-term culture. We observed that the proliferation potential of stem/progenitor cells was variable between donors; and decreased with time in culture. Cells progressively displayed senescent features, which were however acquired earlier in progenitor cells compared to bone marrow and umbilical cord derived mesenchymal stem cells. Differential sensitivity to oxidative stress, related to hyperoxic culture conditions and overexposure to mitogens, may explain these differences. The phenotype characteristics of stem cells remained stable over time. UCMSC, BMMSC and ADHLPC were able to differentiate in hepatocyte-like cells; which was demonstrated by enhanced mature hepatic functionality features. Nevertheless, the hepatocyte-like differentiation potential was incomplete for all cell types as their phenotype remains chimerical for mesenchymal and hepatic epithelial markers. Furthermore, the ability to differentiate into multilineage seems to decrease with time. Umbilical cord and bone marrow derived mesenchymal stem cells had normal karyotypes and cell cycle regulation genes were appropriately upregulated according to senescence. Some ADHLPC cultures displayed <b>random</b> cytogenetic <b>instability</b> at later passages. Aneuploidy was most likely driven by culture stress. These findings were correlated to an early decrease in growth potential, upregulation of cell cycle regulation genes and premature senescence. Moreover, karyotypic changes do not confer selective growth advantage in vitro to cells that carry them. Instead, cells seem to undergo apoptosis. All these characteristics suggest that ADHLPC carrying cytogenetic instability demonstrate the capacity to regulate their cell cycle and induce premature senescence as a potent mechanism against transformation.

40|$|Star {{complexes}} are {{the largest}} globular regions of star formation in galaxies. If there is a spiral density wave, nuclear ring, tidal arm, or other well-defined stellar structure, then gravitational instabilities in the gaseous component produce giant cloud complexes with a spacing of about three times the width. These gas complexes form star complexes, giving the familiar beads on a string of star formation along spiral arms, or nuclear hotspots {{in the case of}} a ring. Turbulence compression, supernovae, and self-gravitational contraction inside the giant clouds produce a nearly scale-free structure, including giant molecular clouds that form OB associations and molecular cloud cores that form clusters. Without stellar density waves or similar structures, <b>random</b> gravitational <b>instabilities</b> form flocculent spirals and these fragment into star complexes, OB associations and star clusters in the same way. The largest coherent star-forming regions are the flocculent arms themselves. At the core of the hierarchy are the very dense clumps in which individual and binary stars form. The overall star formation rate in a galaxy appears to be regulated by gravitational collapse on large scales, giving the Kennicutt/Schmidt law scaling with density, but the efficiency factor in front of this scaling law depends on the fraction of the gas that is in a dense form. Turbulence compression probably contributes to this fraction. The CO version of the Schmidt law, recently derived by Heyer et al. (2004), follows from the turbulent hierarchy as well, as do the local efficiencies of star formation in OB associations and clusters. The efficiency of star formation increases with cloud density, and this is why most stars form in clusters that are initially self-bound.

40|$|Abstract 				 				 					 						Background 					Ensemble {{predictors}} such as {{the random}} forest {{are known to have}} superior accuracy but their black-box predictions are difficult to interpret. In contrast, a generalized linear model (GLM) is very interpretable especially when forward feature selection is used to construct the model. However, forward feature selection tends to overfit the data and leads to low predictive accuracy. Therefore, it remains an important research goal to combine the advantages of ensemble predictors (high accuracy) with the advantages of forward regression modeling (interpretability). To address this goal several articles have explored GLM based ensemble predictors. Since limited evaluations suggested that these ensemble predictors were less accurate than alternative predictors, they have found little attention in the literature. 				 				 					 						Results 					Comprehensive evaluations involving hundreds of genomic data sets, the UCI machine learning benchmark data, and simulations are used to give GLM based ensemble predictors a new and careful look. A novel bootstrap aggregated (bagged) GLM predictor that incorporates several elements of randomness and <b>instability</b> (<b>random</b> subspace method, optional interaction terms, forward variable selection) often outperforms a host of alternative prediction methods including random forests and penalized regression models (ridge regression, elastic net, lasso).

40|$|A {{method of}} {{feedback}} control {{has been proposed}} {{as a means of}} suppressing thermo-acoustic instabilities in a liquid- fueled combustor of a type used in an aircraft engine. The basic principle of the method is one of (1) sensing combustor pressure oscillations associated with instabilities and (2) modulating the rate of flow of fuel to the combustor with a control phase that is chosen adaptively so that the pressure oscillations caused by the modulation oppose the sensed pressure oscillations. The need for this method arises because of the planned introduction of advanced, lean-burning aircraft gas turbine engines, which promise to operate with higher efficiencies and to emit smaller quantities of nitrogen oxides, relative to those of present aircraft engines. Unfortunately, the advanced engines are more susceptible to thermoacoustic instabilities. These instabilities are hard to control because they include large dead-time phase shifts, wide-band noise characterized by amplitudes that are large relative to those of the instabilities, exponential growth of the <b>instabilities,</b> <b>random</b> net phase walks, and amplitude fluctuations. In this method (see figure), the output of a combustion-pressure sensor would be wide-band-pass filtered and then further processed to generate a control signal that would be applied to a fast-actuation valve to modulate the flow of fuel. Initially, the controller would rapidly take large phase steps in order to home in, within a fraction of a second, to a favorable phase region within which the instability would be reduced. Then the controller would restrict itself to operate within this phase region and would further restrict itself to operate within a region of stability, as long as the power in the instability signal was decreasing. In the phase-shifting scheme of this method, the phase of the control vector would be made to continuously bounce back and forth from one boundary of an effective stability region to the other. Computationally, this scheme would be implemented by the adaptive sliding phaser averaged control (ASPAC) algorithm, which requires very little detailed knowledge of the combustor dynamics. In the ASPAC algorithm, the power of the instability signal would be calculated from the wide-bandpass- filtered combustion-pressure signal and averaged {{over a period of time}} (typically of the order of a few hundredths of a second) corresponding to the controller updating cycle [not to be confused with the controller sampling cycle, which would be much shorter (typically of the order of 10 (exp - 4) second) ]...|$|R
40|$|Vehicle {{navigation}} systems incorporate on-board sensors/signal receivers {{and provide}} necessary positioning and guidance information for land, marine, airborne and space vehicles. Among different navigation solutions, the Global Positioning System (GPS) and an Inertial Navigation System (INS) {{are two basic}} navigation systems. Due to their complementary characters in many aspects, a GPS/INS integrated navigation system has been a hot research topic in recent decades. Both {{advantages and disadvantages of}} each individual system and their combination are analysed in this thesis. The Micro Electrical Mechanical Sensors (MEMS) successfully solved the problems of price, size and weight with traditional INS, and hence are widely applied in GPS/INS integrated systems. The main problem of MEMS is the large sensor errors, which rapidly degrade the navigation performance in an exponential speed. By means of different methods, such as autoregressive model, Gauss-Markov process, Power Spectral Density and Allan Variance, we analyse the stochastic errors within the MEMS sensors. The test results show that different methods give similar estimates of stochastic error sources. An equivalent model of coloured noise components (<b>random</b> walk, bias <b>instability</b> and ramp noise) is given. Three levels of GPS/IMU integration structures, i. e. loose, tight and ultra-tight GPS/IMU navigation, are introduced with a brief analysis of each character. The loose integration principles are presented with detailed equations as well as the INS navigation principles. The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) is introduced as the data fusion algorithm, which is the core of the whole navigation system. Based on the system model, we show the propagation of position standard errors with the tight integration structure under different scenarios. Even less than 4 observable GNSS satellites can contribute to the integrated system, especially for the orientation errors. A real test with loose integration is carried out, and the EKF performance is analysed in detail. Since the GPS receivers are normally working with a digital map, the map matching principle and its link-choosing problem are briefly introduced. This problem is proposed to be solved by the lane detection from real-time images. The procedures for the lane detection based on image processing are presented. The test on high ways, city streets and pathways are successfully carried out, and analyses with possible solutions are given for some special failure situations. To solve the large error drift of the IMU, we propose to support the IMU orientation with camera motion estimation from image pairs. First the estimation theory and computer vision principles are briefly introduced. Then both point and line matches algorithms are given. Finally the L 1 -norm estimator with balanced adjustment is proposed to deal with possible mismatches (outliers). Tests and comparisons with the RANSAC algorithm are also presented. For the latest trend of MEMS chip sensors, their industry and market are introduced. To evaluate the MEMS navigation performance, we augment the EKF with an equivalent coloured noise model, and the basic observability analysis is given. A realistic simulated navigation test is carried out with single and multiple MEMS sensors, and a sensor array of 5 - 10 sensors are recommended according to the test results and analysis.
