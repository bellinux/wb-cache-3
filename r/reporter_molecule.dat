40|$|The {{human genome}} {{contains}} thousands of regions, {{including that of}} the telomere, that {{have the potential to}} form quadruplex structures. Many of these regions are potential targets for therapeutic intervention. There are many different folding patterns for quadruplex DNAs and the loops exhibit much more variation than do the quartets. The successful targeting of a particular quadruplex structure requires distinguishing that structure from all of the other quadruplex structures that may be present. A mix and measure fluorescent screening method has been developed, that utilizes multiple <b>reporter</b> <b>molecules</b> that bind to different features of quadruplex DNA. The <b>reporter</b> <b>molecules</b> are used in combination with DNAs that have a variety of quadruplex structures. The screening is based on observing the increase or decrease in the fluorescence of the <b>reporter</b> <b>molecules.</b> The selectivity of a set of test molecules has been determined by this approach...|$|R

50|$|In {{recent years}} it has become common for {{molecular}} biologists to insert IRES sequences into their vectors to allow for expression of two genes from a single vector—for example, a transgene and a fluorescent <b>reporter</b> <b>molecule.</b> The first gene is initiated at the normal 5' cap, and the second at the IRES.|$|E
50|$|To {{overcome}} these challenges, chemists have opted to proceed by identifying pairs of bioorthogonal reaction partners, thus allowing {{the use of}} small exogenous molecules as biomolecular probes. A fluorophore can be attached {{to one of these}} probes to give a fluorescence signal upon binding of the <b>reporter</b> <b>molecule</b> to the target—just as GFP fluoresces when it is expressed with the target.|$|E
50|$|For {{immunohistochemical}} detection strategies, antibodies {{are classified}} as primary or secondary reagents. Primary antibodies are raised against an antigen of interest and are typically unconjugated (unlabeled), while secondary antibodies are raised against immunoglobulins of the primary antibody species. The secondary antibody is usually conjugated to a linker molecule, such as biotin, that then recruits reporter molecules, or the secondary antibody itself is directly bound to the <b>reporter</b> <b>molecule.</b>|$|E

50|$|HMDSO {{has been}} used as a <b>reporter</b> <b>molecule</b> to measure tissue oxygen tension (pO2). HMDSO is highly {{hydrophobic}} and exhibits high gas solubility, and hence strong nuclear magnetic resonance spin lattice relaxation rate (R1) response to changes in pO2.

50|$|Newer luciferases have {{recently}} been identified that, unlike other luciferases above, are naturally secreted molecules. One such example is the Metridia luciferase (MetLuc) that {{is derived from the}} marine copepod Metridia longa. The Metridia longa secreted luciferase gene encodes a 24 kDa protein containing an N-terminal secretory signal peptide of 17 amino acid residues. The sensitivity and high signal intensity of this luciferase molecule proves advantageous in many reporter studies. Some of the benefits of using a secreted <b>reporter</b> <b>molecule</b> like MetLuc is its no-lysis protocol that allows one to be able to conduct live cell assays and multiple assays on the same cell.|$|E

40|$|Polymer {{science is}} an {{interdisciplinary}} field, combining chemistry, physics, {{and in some}} cases biology. Structure, morphology, and dynamical phenomena in natural and synthetic polymers can be addressed using fluorescence spectroscopy. The most attractive aspect of fluorescent reporters is that their fluorescence parameters can give information on the nanometer length scale with an exceptional sensitivity, which allows data acquisition with submicrometer spatial resolution and millisecond time resolution. The use of fluorescent <b>reporter</b> <b>molecules</b> is, in principle, an invasive technique. Because of the large size of polymer molecules, however, small fluorescent <b>reporter</b> <b>molecules</b> of a length scale of <[*] 2 nm can be considered a small perturbation. Because of the enormous importance of synthetic polymers in our technology-based societies, almost every conceivable experimental technique has been applied in this field, but most of these tend to address the sample on a macroscopic scale.

40|$|The {{naked eye}} {{detection}} of single molecules {{in a complex}} mixture is the ultimate detection limit. Since a single molecule is unable to generate a strong enough signal, sensing methodologies able to reach that limit by necessity need to rely on signal amplification. This tutorial review describes various molecular approaches towards signal amplification in which a single analyte molecule affects the properties of a multitude of <b>reporter</b> <b>molecules.</b> Sensing by advanced instrumentation or changes in the physical properties of materials are excluded. The review is divided into four parts (catalysts, macromolecules, metal surfaces and supramolecular aggregates) depending on the species responsible for generating <b>reporter</b> <b>molecules.</b> Although on first sight apparently very diverse in nature, the majority of approaches rely on two key concepts: catalysis and multivalency. The ability of a catalyst to convert a multitude of substrate molecules into product (defined by the turn over number) makes a catalyst an intrinsic signal amplifier in case the chemical conversion of the substrate {{is accompanied by a}} measurable change in physical properties. For sensing purposes, catalytic activity must depend on the interaction between the analyte and the catalyst. Sensing using multivalent structures such as polymers and functionalized nanoparticles relies on the ability of a single analyte molecule to affect the properties of a multitude of <b>reporter</b> <b>molecules</b> collected in the multivalent structure. Chemical sensing systems will be discussed with detection limits that indeed go down to a few molecules and can rival the best biological assays. It will be shown that the most sensitive methods rely on a cascade of amplification mechanism...|$|R

50|$|The avidin-biotin {{system is}} a {{technique}} for studying the interaction between two biomolecules in an indirect manner, as follows: Biotin is chemically coupled to a binder molecule (e.g., a protein, DNA, hormone, etc.) without disturbing the interaction with its target molecule; avidin is then used to “sandwich” between the biotinylated binder and a <b>reporter</b> <b>molecule</b> or probe. This allows {{for a variety of}} tasks, including localization and identification of the binder or target molecule. Consequently, the avidin-biotin system can frequently replace radioactive probes.Together with Ed Bayer, Wilchek established the Avidin-biotin system as a powerful tool in biological sciences. Early in the 1970s, they exploited Avidin as a probe and developed new methods and reagents to biotinylate antibodies and other biomolecules. Today, the {{system is a}}pplied in research and diagnostics as well as medical devices and pharmaceuticals. Examples include western blot, ELISA, ELISPOT and pull-down assays.More recently, Wilchek participated in structural studies of the avidin-biotin complex, to characterize the unique properties of this strong interaction. The studies have culminated in the determination of the 3D structure of the avidin-biotin complex by X-ray crystallography, which aids in the design of specific artificial recognition sites.|$|E
5000|$|Building {{upon this}} finding, Westheimer et al. {{directly}} measured the pKa of Lys115 {{in the active}} site using 5-nitrosalicylaldehyde (5-NSA) [...] Reaction of 5-NSA with acetoacetate decarboxylase and subsequent reduction of the resulting Schiff base with sodium borohydride led to the incorporation of a 2-hydroxy-5-nitrobenzylamino <b>reporter</b> <b>molecule</b> in the active site (Figure 2). Titration of the enzyme with this attached reporter group revealed that the pKa of Lys115 is decreased to 5.9 in the active site. These results were {{the basis for the}} proposal that the perturbation in the pKa of Lys115 was due to its proximity to the positively charged ε-ammonium group of Lys116 in the active site. A nearby positive charge could cause unfavorable electrostatic repulsions that weaken the N-H bond of Lys115. Westheimer et al.'s proposal was further supported by site-directed mutagenesis studies. When Lys116 was mutated to cysteine or asparagine, the pKa of Lys115 was found to be significantly elevated to over 9.2, indicating that positively charged Lys116 plays a critical role in determining the pKa of Lys115. Although a crystal structure was not yet solved to provide structural evidence, this proposal was widely accepted and cited as a textbook example of how the active site can be precisely organized to perturb a pKa and affect reactivity.|$|E
5000|$|Hexafluorobenzene {{has been}} used as a <b>reporter</b> <b>molecule</b> to {{investigate}} tissue oxygenation in vivo. It is exceedingly hydrophobic, but exhibits high gas solubility with ideal liquid gas interactions. Since molecular oxygen is paramagnetic it causes 19F NMR spin lattice relaxation (R1): specifically a linear dependence R1= a + bpO2 has been reported. HFB essentially acts as molecular amplifier, since the solubility of oxygen is greater than in water, but thermodynamics require that the pO2 in the HFB rapidly equilibrates with the surrounding medium. HFB has a single narrow 19F NMR signal and the spin lattice relaxation rate is highly sensitive to changes in pO2, yet minimally responsive to temperature. HFB is typically injected directly into a tissue and 19F NMR may be used to measure local oxygenation. It has been extensively applied to examine changes in tumor oxygenation in response to interventions such as breathing hyperoxic gases or as a consequence of vascular disruption. MRI measurements of HFB based on 19F relaxation have been shown to correlate with radiation response of tumors. HFB {{has been used}} as a gold standard for investigating other potential prognostic biomarkers of tumor oxygenation such as BOLD (Blood Oxygen Level Dependant), TOLD (Tissue Oxygen Level Dependant) [...] and MOXI (MR oximetry) [...] A 2013 review of applications has been published.|$|E
40|$|Polymer {{stabilized}} gold nanoparticles (AuNPs) {{were prepared}} and encoded {{with a range}} of Surface Enhanced Raman <b>reporter</b> <b>molecules.</b> A range of as-synthesized polymers produced by reversible addition fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization were demonstrated to self assemble at the surface of AuNPs dispersed in water. The method involved the coprecipitation of polymer-gold conjugates by the addition of polymer dissolved in a water miscible solvent, to gold AuNPs dispersed in water. This method represents a significant simplification of the preparation of polymer stabilized AuNPs compared with other published methods, in that the AuNPs {{do not need to be}} first transferred to an organic solvent. The process enabled the phase transfer of the AuNPs to an organic solvent in which the RAFT polymer was soluble. The polymer stabilized AuNPs were characterized by a range of methods including UV-Vis spectrometry, TEM and ATR-FTIR. Furthermore, 1 H pulsed field gradient spin echo (PGSE) NMR was utilized to characterize the self-diffusion of the polymer stabilized AuNPs.

40|$|We have {{developed}} a new helicase assay that overcomes many limitations of other assays used to measure this activity. This continuous, kinetic assay {{is based on the}} displacement of fluorescent dyes from dsDNA upon DNA unwinding. These ligands exhibit significant fluorescence enhancement when bound to duplex nucleic acids and serve as the <b>reporter</b> <b>molecules</b> of DNA unwinding. We evaluated the potential of several dyes [acridine orange, ethidium bromide, ethidium homodimer, bis-benzimide (DAPI), Hoechst 33258 and thiazole orange] to function as suitable <b>reporter</b> <b>molecules</b> and demonstrate that the latter three dyes can be used to monitor the helicase activity of Escherichia coli RecBCD enzyme. Both the binding stoichiometry of RecBCD enzyme for the ends of duplex DNA and the apparent rate of unwinding are not significantly perturbed by two of these dyes. The effects of temperature and salt concentration on the rate of unwinding were also examined. We propose that this dye displacement assay can be readily adapted for use with other DNA helicases, with RNA helicases, and with other enzymes that act on nucleic acids...|$|R

5000|$|Among {{the most}} common uses are the {{purification}} or detection of various biomolecules. The strong streptavidin-biotin bond {{can be used to}} attach various biomolecules to one another or onto a solid support. Harsh conditions are needed to break the streptavidin-biotin interaction, which often denatures the protein of interest being purified. However, {{it has been shown that}} a short incubation in water above 70 °C will reversibly break the interaction (at least for biotinylated DNA) without denaturing streptavidin, allowing re-use of the streptavidin solid support. [...] A further application of streptavidin is for purification and detection of proteins genetically modified with the Strep-tag peptide. Streptavidin is widely used in Western blotting and immunoassays conjugated to some <b>reporter</b> <b>molecule,</b> such as horseradish peroxidase.Streptavidin has also been used in the developing field of Nanobiotechnology, the use of biological molecules such as proteins or lipids to create nanoscale devices/structures. In this context streptavidin can be used as a building block to link biotinylated DNA molecules to create single walled carbon nanotube scaffolds or even complex DNA polyhedra.The tetrameric streptavidin has also been used as a hub around which other proteins may be arranged, either by an affinity tag such as Strep-tag or Avitag or by genetic fusion to SpyTag. Fusion to SpyTag allowed generation of assemblies with 8 or 20 streptavidin subunits. As well as a molecular force probe for atomic force microscopy studies, novel materials such as 3D crystalline lattices have also been created. Streptavidin has a mildly acidic isoelectric point (pI) of ~5, but a recombinant form of streptavidin with a near-neutral pI is also commercially available.|$|E
