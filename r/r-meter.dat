40|$|The <b>R-meter</b> is an {{instrument}} which gives a direct {{reading of the}} variance of the velocity distribution of the scatterers within a radar sampled volume and may thereby provide a method for estimating {{the magnitude of the}} turbulence within a storm. In this study, <b>R-meter</b> measurements were made, utilizing a 10 cm. radar, through fourteen convective storms during the summer of 1964. The measurements yieldedrms gust velocities up to 6 m/s€c which is the maximum the instrumentation can measure. However, most values remained well below this peak indicating that 6 m/sec is near the highest rms gust velocity to occur in convective storms. <b>R-meter</b> readings were noted to increase systematically with storm intensities as deduced from measured reflectivities. Highest <b>R-meter</b> readings occurred most frequently at the higher measured ele-vations. A model of the basic'cell circulation in a single-celled stor...|$|E

In this model, we neglect the overhead introduced by the file requests of users in the uplink, thereby only focus on the downlink transmission. In the downlink transmission, a tagged small base station transmits with the constant transmit power 1 /μ Watts, and the standard unbounded power-law pathloss propagation model with exponent α> 2 is used for the environment. The tagged small base station and tagged user experience Rayleigh fading with mean 1. Hence, the received power at the tagged user, located <b>r-meters</b> away from its tagged small base station, is given by h [...]...|$|R
