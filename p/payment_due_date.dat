50|$|With charge cards, the {{cardholder}} {{is required}} to pay the full balance shown on the statement, which is usually issued monthly, by the <b>payment</b> <b>due</b> <b>date.</b> It {{is a form of}} short-term loan to cover the cardholder's purchases, from the date of the purchase and the <b>payment</b> <b>due</b> <b>date,</b> which may typically be up to 55 days. Interest is usually not charged on charge cards and there is usually no limit on the total amount that may be charged. If payment is not made in full, this may result in a late payment fee, the possible restriction of future transactions, and perhaps the cancellation of the card.|$|E
50|$|A {{time period}} after a <b>payment</b> <b>due</b> <b>date</b> {{within which the}} fee can be paid without penalty. For example, late charges may not be {{incurred}} for rental payments due {{on the first of}} the month if they are paid on or before the 10th of the month.|$|E
50|$|The loan is {{at least}} 60 days delinquent where the loan is {{considered}} one day delinquent on the day following the next <b>payment</b> <b>due</b> <b>date.</b> Many servicing contracts often contain a standard clause allowing the servicer to modify seriously delinquent or defaulted mortgages, or mortgages where default is “reasonably foreseeable”.|$|E

It allows cardholders to send Citi {{a text message}} inquiring about their available credit balance, amount due and <b>payment</b> <b>due</b> <b>date.</b> It also allows users to order food, flowers, mobile recharges through and can order prepaid Internet load (from Blast) SMS.

50|$|The Paydex Score {{ranges from}} 0 (worst) to 100 (best). A Paydex of 80 or higher is {{considered}} healthy {{for a company}} - that is, a company is paying its suppliers and vendors on time and before the scheduled <b>payment</b> <b>due</b> <b>date.</b> It {{is also important to}} note that payments received after they are due, or in other words, late, will negatively affect the organization's Paydex score. Today, most lenders and suppliers are looking for a score of 75 and higher.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cardholder}} {{can choose}} either {{to repay the}} full outstanding balance by the <b>payment</b> <b>due</b> <b>date</b> or to repay a smaller amount, not less than the [...] "minimum amount", by that date. In the former case, interest is typically not charged; while in the latter case, the cardholder will be charged with interest. The rate of interest and method of calculating the charge vary between credit cards, even for different types of card issued by the same company. Many credit cards {{can also be used}} to take cash advances through ATMs, which also attract interest charges, usually calculated from the date of cash withdrawal. Some merchants charge a fee for purchases by credit card, as they will be charged a fee by the card issuer.|$|E
50|$|As of 2017, text {{messages}} {{are used by}} youth and adults for personal, family and social purposes and in business, government and non-governmental organizations for communication between colleagues. As with emailing, in the 2010s, the sending of short informal messages has become an accepted part of many cultures. This makes texting a quick and easy way to communicate with friends and colleagues, including in contexts where a phone call would be impolite or inappropriate (e.g., calling very late at night or when one knows the other person is busy with family or work activities). Like e-mail and voice mail, and unlike landline or mobile phone calls (in which the caller hopes to speak directly with the recipient), texting {{does not require the}} caller and recipient to both be free at the same moment; this permits communication even between busy individuals. Text messages {{can also be used to}} interact with automated systems, for example, to order products or services from e-commerce websites, or to participate in online contests. Advertisers and service providers use direct text marketing to send messages to mobile phone users about promotions, <b>payment</b> <b>due</b> <b>dates,</b> and other notifications instead of using postal mail, email, or voicemail.|$|R

In addition, he asserted that five of the banks failed to disclose the existence of the conversion charge, which was also in breach of the Act. It was estimated that the total amount of the charges in question was over $242 million.|$|R
2500|$|The coupon is the {{interest}} rate that the issuer pays to the holder. Usually this rate is fixed throughout {{the life of the}} bond. It can also vary with a money market index, such as LIBOR, or it can be even more exotic. The name [...] "coupon" [...] arose because in the past, paper bond certificates were issued which had coupons attached to them, one for each interest <b>payment.</b> On the <b>due</b> <b>dates</b> the bondholder would hand in the coupon to a bank in exchange for {{the interest}} payment. Interest can be paid at different frequencies: generally semi-annual, i.e. every 6 months, or annual.|$|R

Among the above mentioned issues, we will specifically refer to the measures taken to discourage tax payers from using arrears as a source to fund their own activities, with important mentions on the special correction (“undeclared tax penalty”) for cases when certain sums payable to the public budget are not declared (either totally or partially).

25|$|Each month, the {{cardholder}} is sent {{a statement}} indicating the purchases {{made with the}} card, any outstanding fees, and the total amount owed. In the US, after receiving the statement, the cardholder may dispute any charges {{that he or she}} thinks are incorrect (see , which limits cardholder liability for unauthorized use of a credit card to $50). The Fair Credit Billing Act gives details of the US regulations. The cardholder must pay a defined minimum portion of the amount owed by a <b>due</b> <b>date,</b> or may choose to pay a higher amount. The credit issuer charges interest on the unpaid balance if the billed amount is not paid in full (typically at a much higher rate than most other forms of debt). In addition, if the cardholder fails to make at least the minimum <b>payment</b> by the <b>due</b> <b>date,</b> the issuer may impose a late fee or other penalties. To help mitigate this, some financial institutions can arrange for automatic payments to be deducted from the cardholder's bank account, thus avoiding such penalties altogether, as long as the cardholder has sufficient funds.|$|R

30|$|Due to {{stagnation}} in sales, many lime bosses allowed {{their clients}} to purchase lime on credit. In this case, often {{they would not}} be able to receive <b>payment</b> by the <b>due</b> <b>date,</b> and they would need to send out someone to collect payment. Even so, bad debts were inevitable. Some clients defaulted as a result of their own difficult economic situations—for example, some peasants were burdened with a huge amount of debt when building their own houses, and some factories and collective enterprises had low revenues and even entered bankruptcy. If they chose not to default, they would pay the debt by alternative means. For instance, they might pay using valuable assets or agricultural products. Most business owners would have to accept such types of payment once they had confirmed that the client was indeed out of cash and realized that forcing the client to pay would only result in poor outcomes for everyone.|$|R
40|$|Trade {{credit is}} {{a major source of}} {{financing}} for small firms. This article examines the extent to which small firms use trade credit as well as {{the extent to which they}} use 2 ̆ 2 free 2 ̆ 2 versus 2 ̆ 2 costly 2 ̆ 2 trade credit. Those firms that use free trade credit make payment within the discount period. Alternatively, firms that use costly trade credit forego available discounts and may also make <b>payment</b> after the <b>due</b> <b>date</b> thereby incurring substantial additional costs. Results reveal that larger firms were more likely to use trade credit. Younger firms were more likely to be denied trade credit and were also more likely to pay late as were firms with a history of credit difficulties and those with high levels of debt. Firms owned by white women and Hispanic men were significantly less likely to have trade credit than firms owned by white men. Further, firms owned by black men were significantly more likely to be denied trade credit...|$|R
