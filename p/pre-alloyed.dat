50|$|Mechanical {{alloying}} (MA) is a solid-state powder processing technique involving repeated cold welding, fracturing, and re-welding of blended powder {{particles in}} a high-energy ball mill {{to produce a}} homogeneous material. Originally developed to produce oxide-dispersion strengthened (ODS) nickel- and iron-base superalloys for applications in the aerospace industry, MA has now {{been shown to be}} capable of synthesizing a variety of equilibrium and non-equilibrium alloy phases starting from blended elemental or <b>pre-alloyed</b> powders. The non-equilibrium phases synthesized include supersaturated solid solutions, metastable crystalline and quasicrystalline phases, nanostructures, and amorphous alloys. One consideration that should be avoided is powder contamination.|$|E
50|$|Several {{techniques}} {{exist to}} produce <b>pre-alloyed</b> powder, such as Grade 5. In the hydride-dehydride process feedstock such as solid scrap, billet or machined turnings are processed to remove contaminants, hydrogenated to produce brittle material then ground under argon in a vibratory ball mill, typically at 400 °C for 4 {{hours at a}} pressure of 1 psi for Ti Grade 5. The resulting particles are angular and measure between 50 and 300 µm. Cold compaction after dehydrogenation of the powder, followed by either vacuum hot pressing (in this case the dehydrogenation process can be bypassed as hydrogen is removed under vacuum) or HIP and a final vacuum anneal, produces powders with hydrogen below 125 ppm. The possible presence of contaminants makes these powders unsuitable for use in critical aircraft applications.|$|E
50|$|Using such {{a system}} still {{required}} several steps and mathematical calculation. The touchstone allows one to estimate the amount of gold in an alloy, which is then multiplied by the weight to find the amount of gold alone in a lump. To make this process easier, the concept of standard coinage was introduced. Coins were pre-weighed and <b>pre-alloyed,</b> {{so as long as}} the manufacturer was aware of the origin of the coin, no use of the touchstone was required. Coins were typically minted by governments in a carefully protected process, and then stamped with an emblem that guaranteed the weight and value of the metal. It was, however, extremely common for governments to assert that the value of such money lay in its emblem and thus to subsequently reduce the value of the currency by lowering the content of valuable metal.|$|E
50|$|The creep {{properties}} of ODS steels are {{highly dependent on}} the characteristics of the nano-oxides particles which exist in the metal matrix, specifically the ability of these particles to prevent dislocation motion as well as the size and distribution of the particles. Hoelzer and coworkers have shown that an alloy containing a homogeneous dispersion of 1-5 nm Y2Ti2O7 nanoclusters has superior {{creep properties}} to an alloy with a heterogeneous dispersion of 5-20 nm nanoclusters of the same composition. In the pursuit of new ODS steels it is important to focus on processes that allow for the formation of a dense homogeneous dispersion of small nanoclusters. ODS steels are commonly produced through ball-milling an oxide of interest (e.g. Y2O3, Al2O3) with <b>pre-alloyed</b> metal powders followed by compression and sintering of the material. It is believed that the nano-oxides enter into solid solution with the metal during ball-milling and subsequently precipitate during the thermal treatment to yield the ODS steel. This process seems simple but many parameters need to be carefully controlled to produce a well made alloy. Work by Leseigneur and coworkers has been done to carefully control some of these parameters in order to get more consistent and better microstructures in ODS steels. In this two step method the oxide is ball-milled {{for longer periods of time}} to ensure a homogeneous solid solution of the oxide in the metal matrix. Then the powder is annealed at higher temperatures to begin a controlled nucleation of the nano-oxide clusters. Finally the powder is again compressed and sintered to yield the final material.|$|E

Microstructure characteristic of produced sinter-hardened Ni-Mo steels with increasing amount of tungsten(from 0 to 0. 3 % wt.) was taken under consideration. Design/methodology/approach: Different compositions have been tested in order to investigate the influenceof various tungsten additions into low (0. 4 %) and high (0. 6 %) carbon content of <b>pre-alloyed</b> steel powders. Powders, with addition of 0. 7 % lubricant, were pressed in a 2000 kN hydraulic press. De-waxing process at 550 ºC for 60 minutes in a fully nitrogen atmosphere was performed before the sintering.

MethodsPre-alloyed 17 - 4 stainless steel powders prepared by atomization in either argon or nitrogen atmospheres were fabricated by SLM. The initial powder microstructures and phase structures were examined by light (optical) microscopy (OM), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and X-ray diffraction (XRD). Prototypes fabricated by SLM were similarly characterized, and in addition transmission electron microscopy (TEM) characterization was also performed. ResultsMartensitic powder fabricated by SLM in nitrogen gas produced a martensitic product while <b>pre-alloyed</b> austenitic powder produced a primarily austenitic product. In contrast, both powders produced martensitic products when fabricated by SLM in argon gas.

40|$|Purpose: The paper {{focuses on}} {{microstructural}} and mechanical properties of <b>pre-alloyed</b> Astaloy CrL and CrM sintered steels with high addition of carbon. Design/methodology/approach: The main {{objective of the}} present work was to establish the effect of cooling rates on the microstructure and properties such as: Charpy impact test, microhardness, wear resistance (disk on disk test) were evaluated depending on chemical composition. Compacts containing low amounts of chromium, molybdenum and high amount of graphite were sintered in a vacuum furnace at 1120 ºC in vacuum atmosphere and rapidly cooled in nitrogen with two different rates. Then compacts were tempered in vacuum, and cooled in nitrogen. Obtained samples were analysed by light optical microscopy (LOM) for microstructure observation and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with EDS for chemical composition. Findings: Sinter hardening is a cost-effective process that consists of sintering and heat treatment in one step, so it minimizes the number of processing steps. It is known that the cooling rate following sintering greatly affect material microstructure, which determine the final properties of sinter-hardened materials. The objective was to understand how sintering conditions influence the development of microstructures and thereby control mechanical properties of materials. Practical implications: Changing the amount of graphite element and cooling rates, will affect the amount of ferrite, perlite, martensite and bainite in the microstructure.

A spherical gas-atomised <b>pre-alloyed</b> NiTi powder (50. 3 at. %Ni) with a mean particle size of less than 22 μm and powder loading of 69. 5 vol. % was used. The binder consisted of a water soluble binder system, mainly polyethylene glycol (PEG), with two different backbone binders, namely polyethylene 520 (PE 520) and poly-methyl- methacrylate (PMMA). The latter {{was used in the}} form of a powder and as an emulsion. Green parts were prepared by warm-press the feedstock into a cylindrical shape.

This consequently resulted in a shift of the phase transformation temperature to lower values and consequently broadened the reversible austenite to martensite transformation.

Two different nominal densities were considered, 6. 9 g/cm 3 and 7. 1 g/cm 3. After a preliminary optimization, two shoot peening cycles were selected and carried out on the investigated materials. Residual stresses after the treatment were measured {{by means of the}} hole drilling technique and related to the mechanical properties and the surface densification of both steels, varying the nominal density...|$|E
