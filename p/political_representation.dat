40|$|This Bachelor thesis {{deals with}} anti-Jewish {{measurements}} in the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia {{and in the}} Slovak Republic during the Second World War. It analyses {{the relationship between the}} German Empire and two successors on the area of the Czech-Slovak Republic. The thesis aims to discover relationship between internal structure of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and the Slovak Republic and anti-Jewish measurements, which were implemented by national <b>political</b> <b>representations</b> or they were ruled by the Nazi Germany. In the case of the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia and the Slovak Republic the implementation of these measurements was combination of the initiative from national <b>political</b> <b>representations</b> and the influence of the German Empire...|$|R

5|$|In Spain from 1808 to 1814 the Spanish War of Independence {{took place}} amidst a multi-cultural Spain. Spain, at the time, {{was under the}} control of King Joseph, who was Napoleon I of France's brother. Because the nation was {{under the control of}} French rule, the Spanish formed coalitions of ethnic groups to reclaim their own <b>{{political}}</b> <b>representation,</b> instead of the current French political system in power.|$|E
5|$|By 1942, {{most of the}} {{differences}} between politicians in occupied Poland and those in exile had been positively settled. By 1943, the PKP had evolved into the Home <b>Political</b> <b>Representation</b> (Krajowa Reprezentacja Polityczna, KRP), which served as the basis of the Council of National Unity (Rada Jedności Narodowej, RJN), created on 9 January 1944. The Council, headed by Kazimierz Pużak, was seen as the Underground State's parliament. Meanwhile, the military arm of the Underground State expanded dramatically, and the ZWZ was transformed into Armia Krajowa (AK, or the Home Army) in 1942. ZWZ-AK commanders included Stefan Rowecki, Tadeusz Komorowski and Leopold Okulicki.|$|E
5|$|Independence from Europe is a minor, Eurosceptic {{political}} {{party in the}} United Kingdom. The party has been registered since June 2012 but remained inactive until it was officially launched in October 2013 by current party leader Mike Nattrass, a disaffected member of the UK Independence Party (UKIP).

50|$|The {{conclusion}} is that a systematic ambivalence structures contemporary cultural representations of the globalised, technologically mediated, ethnically mixed, gender-aware world we now inhabit. The question consequently arises {{of what it takes}} to produce adequate cultural and <b>political</b> <b>representations</b> of a fast-changing world and move closer to Spinozian notions of adequate understanding.|$|R

5|$|This scheme {{can be seen}} as a {{mechanism}} for representation. First, MPs are chosen by the electorate to represent their concerns and needs in Parliament. Secondly, the Prime Minister, who is vested with the confidence of majority of the MPs, and the Cabinet which is made up of popularly elected MPs, effectively represent the views of the electorate as he heads the Government. The structure of the executive is therefore based on the concept of <b>political</b> <b>representation.</b>|$|E
5|$|After the {{collapse}} of the Austro-Hungarian monarchy in 1918 and the proclamation of the First Austrian Republic, diplomatic relations with the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics were established on 25 February 1924. The first Soviet Plenipotentiary in Vienna was Yan Antonovich Berzin. Diplomatic relations were broken in March 1938 after the German invasion of Austria and its incorporation into Nazi Germany. After the Second World War, the USSR and Austria re-established diplomatic relations at the level of <b>political</b> <b>representation,</b> which in 1953 was converted into embassies. The preamble of the Austrian State Treaty, signed on 15 May 1955 by the USSR, United States, United Kingdom, France and Austria, established that the treaty formed the basis of Soviet relations with Austria. After the dissolution of the Soviet Union, relations continued between the Russian Federation and the Austrian state.|$|E
5|$|DuBois rose to {{national}} prominence {{as the leader}} of the Niagara Movement, a group of African-American activists who wanted equal rights for blacks. DuBois and his supporters opposed the Atlanta compromise, an agreement crafted by BookerT. Washington which provided that Southern blacks would work and submit to white political rule, while Southern whites guaranteed that blacks would receive basic educational and economic opportunities. Instead, DuBois insisted on full civil rights and increased <b>political</b> <b>representation,</b> which he believed would be brought about by the African-American intellectual elite. He referred to this group as the Talented Tenth and believed that African Americans needed the chances for advanced education to develop its leadership.|$|E
40|$|The main {{argument}} {{of the book}} is that a result of globalisation processes we may observe a superb example of transformation of the Westphalian international states system into neomedieval embedded cosmopolitan states.

5|$|During {{the post-war}} Reconstruction era, Virginia adopted a {{constitution}} which provided for free public schools, and guaranteed political, civil, and voting rights. The populist Readjuster Party ran an inclusive coalition until the conservative white Democratic Party gained power after 1883. It passed segregationist Jim Crow laws and in 1902 rewrote the Constitution of Virginia {{to include a}} poll tax and other voter registration measures that effectively disfranchised most African Americans and many poor European Americans. Though their schools and public services were segregated and underfunded {{due to a lack}} of <b>political</b> <b>representation,</b> African Americans were able to unite in communities and take a greater role in Virginia society.|$|E
5|$|Hong Kong {{soon became}} a major entrepôt thanks to its free port status, {{attracting}} new immigrants to settle from both China and Europe. The society, however, remained racially segregated and polarised under early British colonial policies. Despite {{the rise of a}} British-educated Chinese upper-class by the late-19th century, race laws such as the Peak Reservation Ordinance prevented ethnic Chinese in Hong Kong from acquiring houses in reserved areas such as Victoria Peak. At this time, the majority of the Chinese population in Hong Kong had no <b>political</b> <b>representation</b> in the British colonial government. The British governors did rely, however, on a small number of Chinese elites, including Sir Kai Ho and Robert Hotung, who served as ambassadors and mediators between the government and local population.|$|E
5|$|In {{advance of}} the 2000 United States Census, city {{officials}} made a push to get residents to respond {{and participate in the}} enumeration, citing calculations by city officials that as many as 30,000 people were not reflected in estimates from the Census Bureau, which resulted in the loss of government aid and <b>political</b> <b>representation.</b> It is believed that heavily immigrant areas of Newark were significantly undercounted in the 2010 Census, especially in the East Ward. Many households refused to participate in the census, with immigrants often reluctant to submit census forms because they believed that the information could be used to justify their deportation.|$|E

The APL makes technical (but not <b>political)</b> <b>representations</b> on proposed legislative and regulatory changes. It also offers substantial social networking opportunities between pension lawyers, who as a result are more familiar with each other than is customary in other legal disciplines in the UK. Almost all practising pension lawyers subscribe to APL membership, given the practical benefits of membership.|$|R

50|$|Puthiya Needhi Katchi (translation: New Justice Party), is a {{political}} party in Tamil Nadu, India. It is headed by A.C. Shanmugham, a former AIADMK member. The party was started just before the 2001 Tamil Nadu assembly election. The leader of the party claims to represent Mudaliars and he argued that Vanniars have exploited the political machinery in Tamil Nadu through Pattali Makkal Katchi to attain reservation benefits and <b>political</b> <b>representations.</b> In September 2009, the party renamed itself as Needhi Katchi by dropping the pudhiya (lit. new) prefix.|$|R
5|$|Since {{the turn}} of the century, most blacks in the South, and many poor whites, had been disenfranchised by state legislatures passing constitutions with {{provisions}} that were discriminatory in practice. This meant that their millions of population had no <b>political</b> <b>representation.</b> Most of the South had one-party states. When the resolution came before the Senate, a substitute resolution, one without the rider, was proposed by Joseph L. Bristow of Kansas. It was adopted by a vote of 64 to 24, with 4 not voting. Nearly a year later, the House accepted the change. The conference report that would become the Seventeenth Amendment was approved by the Senate 42 to 36 on April 12, 1912, and by the House 238 to 39, with 110 not voting on May 13, 1912.|$|E
5|$|The Underground State {{represented}} most, {{though not}} all, political factions of the Second Polish Republic. The Political Consultative Committee (PKP) represented four major Polish parties: the Socialist Party (PPS-WRN), the People's Party (SL), the SN, and the Labor Party (SP). The SP joined the PKP in June 1940, {{four months after}} the PKP was created; and the PPS-WRN withdrew from the PKP between October 1941 and March 1943. Those parties, known as the Big Four, were also represented in the Home <b>Political</b> <b>Representation</b> (KRP). Compared to PKP and KRP, the Council of National Unity was much more representative, and included representatives of several smaller political groupings. Several other groups lacked significant representation in PKP and KRP, but nonetheless had supported the Underground State. Non-Polish ethnic minorities, primarily the Ukrainians and the Belarusians, were not represented in the Underground State; however the Jews were.|$|E
5|$|At the 2015 general election, {{the party}} contested five constituencies, despite {{previously}} indicating it would vie for ten. These were the Lincolnshire seats of Boston and Skegness and Brigg and Goole alongside the West Midlands seats of Meriden and Solihull; additionally contested was Cheadle, a constituency in Greater Manchester. Nattrass once again appeared on Daily Politics, interviewed by Jo Coburn on 1 April. No candidates were elected {{and the party}} accumulated a negligible vote share. Local elections {{in the same year}} saw the party unsuccessfully contest eight wards on East Lindsey District Council, with an additional candidate failing in his bid for election to Leicester City Council. The following year's local elections saw the party field a candidate for Exeter City Council, who was comfortably defeated. A day later, the party contested a local by-election for Croydon London Borough Council triggered by the resignation of Emily Benn; the party finished second last, above Winston McKenzie of the English Democrats. Independence from Europe failed to field any candidates in the 2017 local elections; incumbent Councillors Alan Jesson and John Beaver did not seek re-election and Chris Pain defected to the Lincolnshire Independents, leaving the party with no official <b>political</b> <b>representation.</b>|$|E

5|$|Gandhi used fasting as a {{political}} device, often threatening suicide unless demands were met. Congress publicised the fasts as {{a political}} action that generated widespread sympathy. In response the government tried to manipulate news coverage to minimise his challenge to the Raj. He fasted in 1932 to protest the voting scheme for separate <b>political</b> <b>representation</b> for Dalits; Gandhi did not want them segregated. The British government stopped the London press from showing photographs of his emaciated body, because it would elicit sympathy. Gandhi's 1943 hunger strike took place during a two-year prison term for the anticolonial Quit India movement. The government called on nutritional experts to demystify his action, and again no photos were allowed. However, his final fast in 1948, {{after the end of}} British rule in India, his hunger strike was lauded by the British press and this time did include full-length photos.|$|E
5|$|The {{economic}} boom resulted in drawing {{large numbers of}} aborigines out of their villages and into the unskilled or low-skilled sector of the urban workforce. Manufacturing and construction jobs were generally available for low wages. The aborigines quickly formed bonds with other communities as they all had similar political motives to protect their collective needs {{as part of the}} labor force. The aborigines became the most skilled iron-workers and construction teams on the island often selected to work on the most difficult projects. The result was a mass exodus of indigenous members from their traditional lands and the cultural alienation of young people in the villages, who could not learn their languages or customs while employed. Often, young aborigines in the cities fall into gangs aligned with the construction trade. Recent laws governing the employment of laborers from Indonesia, Vietnam and the Philippines have also led to an increased atmosphere of xenophobia among urban aborigines, and encouraged the formulation of a pan-indigenous consciousness in the pursuit of <b>political</b> <b>representation</b> and protection.|$|E
5|$|In 1819, Lancashire was {{represented}} by two members of parliament (MPs). Voting was restricted to the adult male owners of freehold land with an annual rental value of 40shillings or more– {{the equivalent of about}} £80 in 2008– and votes could only be cast at the county town of Lancaster, by a public spoken declaration at the hustings. Constituency boundaries were out of date, and the so-called rotten boroughs had a hugely disproportionate influence on the membership of the Parliament of the United Kingdom compared to the size of their populations: Old Sarum in Wiltshire, with one voter, elected two MPs, as did Dunwich in Suffolk, which by the early 19th century had almost completely disappeared into the sea. The major urban centres of Manchester, Salford, Bolton, Blackburn, Rochdale, Ashton-under-Lyne, Oldham and Stockport, with a combined population of almost one million, were represented by either the two county MPs for Lancashire, or the two for Cheshire in the case of Stockport. By comparison, {{more than half of all}} MPs were returned by a total of just 154owners of rotten or closed boroughs. In 1816, Thomas Oldfield's The Representative History of Great Britain and Ireland; being a History of the House of Commons, and of the Counties, Cities, and Boroughs of the United Kingdom from the earliest Period claimed that of the 515 MPs for England and Wales 351 were returned by the patronage of 177 individuals and a further 16 by the direct patronage of the government: all 45 Scottish MPs owed their seats to patronage. These inequalities in <b>political</b> <b>representation</b> led to calls for reform.|$|E
