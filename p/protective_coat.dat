5|$|A virus particle, {{also known}} as a virion, {{consists}} of genes made from DNA or RNA which are surrounded by a <b>protective</b> <b>coat</b> of protein called a capsid. The capsid is made of many smaller, identical protein molecules which are called capsomers. The arrangement of the capsomers can either be icosahedral (20-sided), helical or more complex. There is an inner shell around the DNA or RNA called the nucleocapsid, which is formed by proteins. Some viruses are surrounded by a bubble of lipid (fat) called an envelope.|$|E
25|$|Another {{germination}} event {{during the}} life cycle of gymnosperms and flowering plants is the germination of a pollen grain after pollination. Like seeds, pollen grains are severely dehydrated before being released to facilitate their dispersal from one plant to another. They consist of a <b>protective</b> <b>coat</b> containing several cells (up to 8 in gymnosperms, 2-3 in flowering plants). One of these cells is a tube cell. Once the pollen grain lands on the stigma of a receptive flower (or a female cone in gymnosperms), it takes up water and germinates. Pollen germination is facilitated by hydration on the stigma, {{as well as by the}} structure and physiology of the stigma and style. Pollen can also be induced to germinate in vitro (in a petri dish or test tube).|$|E
500|$|A {{complete}} virus particle, {{known as a}} virion, consists of nucleic acid surrounded by a <b>protective</b> <b>coat</b> of protein called a capsid. These are formed from identical protein subunits called capsomeres. Viruses can have a lipid [...] "envelope" [...] derived from the host cell membrane. The capsid is made from proteins encoded by the viral genome and its shape serves {{as the basis for}} morphological distinction. Virally coded protein subunits will self-assemble to form a capsid, in general requiring the presence of the virus genome. Complex viruses code for proteins that assist in the construction of their capsid. Proteins associated with nucleic acid are known as nucleoproteins, and the association of viral capsid proteins with viral nucleic acid is called a nucleocapsid. The capsid and entire virus structure can be mechanically (physically) probed through atomic force microscopy. In general, there are four main morphological virus types: ...|$|E

2500|$|Cephalopods are not {{broadcast}} spawners. During {{the process}} of fertilization, the females use sperm provided by the male via external fertilization. Internal fertilization is seen only in octopods. The initiation of copulation begins when the male catches a female and wraps his arm around her, either in a [...] "male to female neck" [...] position or mouth to mouth position, depending on the species. The males then initiate {{the process of}} fertilization by contracting their mantle several times to release the spermatozoa. Cephalopods often mate several times, which influences males to mate longer with females that have previously, nearly tripling the amount of contractions of the mantle. To ensure the fertilization of the eggs, female cephalopods release a sperm-attracting peptide through the gelatinous layers of the egg to direct the spermatozoa. Female cephalopods lay eggs in clutches; each egg is composed of a <b>protective</b> <b>coat</b> {{to ensure the safety}} of the developing embryo when released into the water column. Reproductive strategies differ between cephalopod species. In giant pacific octopus, large eggs are laid in a den; it will often take several days to lay all of them. Once the eggs are released and attached to a sheltered substrate the females then die. In some species of cephalopods, egg clutches are anchored to substrates by a mucilaginous adhesive substance. These eggs are swelled with preivitelline fluid (PVF), a hypertonic fluid that prevents premature hatching. Fertilized egg clusters are neutrally buoyant depending at the depth that they were laid but can also be found in substrates such as sand, matrix of corals, or seaweed. Because these species do not provide parental care for their offspring, egg capsules can be injected with ink by the female in order to camouflage the embryos from predators.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Sliding {{experiments}} lubricated with hydroxyl silicate magnesium particles as additive {{were performed}} under ambient condition and different loads {{by using an}} AMSLER friction and wear tester.

However, a smooth and continuous <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> can be developed on the worn surface of the steel when the friction load is high enough.

40|$|A <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> is used {{to protect}} surface of a {{material}} from various deterioration factors. When cracks form and propagate in the coating, water, chloride ion, and carbon dioxide would penetrate through the cracks. This results in {{the deterioration of the}} material, leading to reduction in its serviceability. If the <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> has selfhealing ability, it would effectively protect the materials from the deterioration. In this work a capsule-type self-healing <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> has been developed using vegetable oils as healing agent. Healing-agent-loaded microcapsules are embedded in a coating matrix to obtain a self-healing <b>protective</b> <b>coating.</b> Upon damage-induced cracking, the microcapsules are ruptured by the propagating crack fronts, resulting in release of the healing agent into the crack by capillary action. A healing reaction occurs by atmospheric oxygen, generating a viscoelastic substance. The self-healing coating was evaluated as <b>protective</b> <b>coating</b> for steel, and it was demonstrated that our system has good self-healing capability. In conventional capsule-type self-healing systems, healing reactions generally produce hard solids, so the systems are considered to be vulnerable to regeneration of cracks in the healed region. Furthermore, the regenerated cracks can not be healed because healing agent is consumed in the first healing process. It should be noted that our new system can effectively prevent the coating from regeneration of cracks in the healed region...|$|R
