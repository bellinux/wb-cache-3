40|$|A {{method of}} reverse phase high {{performance}} liquid chromatography (RP-HPLC) {{was established to}} analyze the dissipation of <b>propamidine</b> residue in tomato. Residue of <b>propamidine</b> was extracted from tomato using methanol buffered and determined by RP-HPLC with UV detection at 262 nm.

40|$|The first medical cure of Acanthamoeba {{keratitis}} {{was obtained}} by use of <b>propamidine</b> isethionate. Since then, {{it has been the}} basic drug recommended for use in treatment. Because some Acanthamoeba strains have been reported to be resistant to <b>propamidine</b> and <b>propamidine</b> was found to be only weakly cysticidal, superior homologs such as butamidine, pentamidine, hexamidine, heptamidine, octamidine, and nonamidine were tested for their amoebicidal effects on two Acanthamoeba strains isolated from patients with keratitis. Trophozoicidal and cysticidal efficiencies were found to be increased from <b>propamidine</b> to nonamidine; i,e,, when the alkyl chain connecting the two benzene rings in their molecular structures was elongated, in comparison with <b>propamidine,</b> hexamidine and octamidine were the most amoebicidal molecules. As a result of these data, a kinetic study carried out on <b>propamidine,</b> hexamidine, and octamidine demonstrated that the amoebicidal effects resulted from two events: the diffusion of molecules through the plasma membrane or the double wall of trophozoites or cysts, respectively, and the lethal effects of molecules on amoebic protoplasm. The diffusion kinetics were increased when the alkyl chain was elongated, i. e., with an increase in the lipophilic properties of molecules, In contrast, the lethal effect kinetics were found to be unchanged by this elongation, indicating that they originated from the cationic surface-active properties induced by the protonated amidine groups attached to each benzene ring, which themselves remained unchanged from one molecule to the other. These results strongly advocate the immediate replacement of <b>propamidine</b> by hexamidine in the medical treatment of Acanthamoeba keratitis; in France, 0. 1 % hexamidine eyedrops are available (Desomedine). The results also advocate clinical investigations on the efficiency and toxicity of octamidine, which appears to be the most amoebicidal diamidine in vitro...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>propamidine</b> and their dose dependency, on {{utilization}} of the third and fifth complement components in immune haemolysis have been compared. While C 3 utilization is not disturbed that of C 5 is markedly inhibited by <b>propamidine</b> in concentrations as low as 0. 5 mM. Both, binding of C 5 to surface-fixed C 3 b and cleavage of C 5 by convertases C 42 and C 3 bBb, are also inhibited {{in the presence of}} <b>propamidine.</b> Since neither C 3 cleavage by these enzymes nor even C 5 cleavage by the cobra venom factor-supported convertase CFVBb is significantly reduced a general convertase-inhibiting effect of <b>propamidine</b> is ruled out. Rather the effect on utilization of C 5 is the result of interference with binding of C 5 is the result of interference with binding of C 5 to C 3 b and hence impairment of its accessibility to the convertases.

40|$|PURPOSE. To {{assess the}} Acanthamoeba trophozoite {{viability}} in vitro {{and treatment of}} Acanthamoeba keratitis in a hamster model using ultraviolet light A (UV-A) and riboflavin (B 2). METHODS. A sample of Acanthamoeba sp. cultured was transferred to a 96 -well plate and exposed to B 2 and the UV-A light (365 nm wavelength) at a power density of 3 mW/cm(2), 8 mm spot diameter, for 30 minutes. the exposure was done in triplicate. Control groups were prepared in triplicate as well: blank control, UV-A only, riboflavin only, and dead control. Cell viability assessment was done using the trypan blue dye exclusion method. Acanthamoeba keratitis was induced in Chinese hamsters; who {{were randomly assigned to}} one of the animal groups: UV-A + B 2, <b>propamidine</b> isethionate (Brolene; Sanofi-Aventis, Ellerslie, Auckland, Australia), UV-A + B 2 + <b>propamidine</b> isethionate (Brolene), only UV-A, only B 2, and blank. Throughout the 14 days after treatment the animals were examined clinically. Histology and clinical scores of all groups were compared. RESULTS. the in vitro study showed no difference between the treatment group UV-A + B 2 and the control groups. in the hamster keratitis model a significant improvement of clinical score was observed for the groups <b>propamidine</b> isethionate (Brolene) and UV-A + B 2 + <b>propamidine</b> isethionate (Brolene) (P = 0. 0067). Also a significant worsening of clinical score was observed in the other groups: UV-A + B 2 group (P = 0. 0084), only UV-A (P = 0. 0078), B 2 only (P = 0. 0084), and blank (P = 0. 0082). No difference was observed between <b>propamidine</b> isethionate (Brolene) and UV-A + B 2 + <b>propamidine</b> isethionate (Brolene). CONCLUSIONS. the adjunctive use of UV-A and B 2 therapy did not demonstrate antitrophozoite activity; in vivo UV-A and B 2 did not demonstrate efficacy in this model.

40|$|Liposomes {{can be used}} as {{vehicles}} for intracellular delivery of drugs into phagocytic cells. Clodronate and <b>propamidine,</b> delivered into macrophages in this way, will kill these cells as a result of intracellular accumulation and irreversible metabolic damage.

40|$|The DNA {{sequences}} {{targeted by}} a complete homologous series of aromatic diamidines have been determined at single-nucleotide resolution via protection from cutting by the endonucleases DNase I, DNase II and micrococcal nuclease. <b>Propamidine,</b> pentamidine {{and to a}} lesser extent hexamidine bind selectively to nucleotide sequences composed of at least four consecutive A-T base pairs. In contrast, the binding to DNA of butamidine, heptamidine, octamidine and nonamidine is poorly sequence-selective. Sequences composed of only three consecutive A-T base pairs do not afford a potential binding site for <b>propamidine</b> or the longer homologues, and none of the drugs tolerate the presence of a G-C base pair within the binding site. Experiments with DNA molecules containing inosine in place of guanosine and 2, 6 -diaminopurine in place of adenine reveal that the lack of binding of <b>propamidine</b> to GC-containing sites is attributable to an obstructive effect of the exocyclic 2 -amino group of guanosine. The present data support the view that the local conformation of the double helix (in particular the width of the minor groove) plays a dominant role in the binding reaction and that the capacity of diamidines to recognize AT-rich sequences selectively varies considerably depending on the length of the alkyl chain. The evidence indicates that binding to AT-tracts in DNA must play a role in the biological activity of these diamidines, but there is no simple correlation between binding and pharmacological efficacy...|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: A medium {{containing}} <b>propamidine</b> {{is described}} which has high selective activity for the species Bacillus anthracis. The spore {{form of the}} organism is essential as inoculum for the medium. The isolation of Bacillus anthracis from material heavily contaminated by other organisms of the same genus can be difficult, particularly when small numbers of B. anthracis are present, or when quantitative examination is required. Pearce & Powell (1951) did much to simplify this problem by devising a medium containing lysozyme and haemin, but considerable numbers of other sporing organisms found in soil were not suppressed. The antibacterial activity of diamidines has been studied by many workers (e. g. Bernheim, 1943; Elson, 1945; Wein, Harrison & Freeman, 1948).

30|$|A 20 -year-old {{woman with}} a history of contact lens wear was {{referred}} to our hospital for keratitis after responding poorly to conventional treatment. In vivo confocal microscopy images suggested acanthamoeba keratitis with double-walled cysts in the anterior corneal stroma. Acanthamoeba infection was confirmed by laboratory findings. She was started on 0.1 % <b>propamidine</b> and 0.02 % chlorhexidine drops every hour. The antibiotic and antifungal drops were stopped when bacterial and fungal cultures proved negative. A central neurotrophic corneal ulcers (NCU) appeared, and despite treatment with artificial tears, bandage contact lens, and autologous serum, the ulcer worsened and she was treated with topical CACICOL 20 (1 drop every 2  days) for 8  weeks. The corneal defect was completely repaired in 3  weeks. The treatment was well tolerated, and no local or systemic side effects were noted. Visual acuity remained 20 / 400.

40|$|AbstractLiposomes can be {{used for}} the {{intracellular}} delivery of drugs into macrophages. Previously, we developed a liposome-mediated macrophage ‘suicide’ technique based on the intraphagocytic accumulation of the liposomally delivered bisphosphonate clodronate. Later we found that the diamidine <b>propamidine</b> is even more effective in this approach. In the present study it is shown that liposome-encapsulated 4 ′, 6 -diamidino- 2 -phenylindole (L-DAPI), another well known DNA-binding diamidine, is the most effective drug in killing liver macrophages (Kupffer cells), when intravenously administered in rat. Compared to liposome-encapsulated <b>propamidine</b> (L-propamidine) it showed about 10 -fold more activity on a molar basis. Furthermore, L-DAPI was found to induce cell death by inducing apoptosis. The structurally strongly related phenanthridinium salts ethidium bromide (EB) and propidium iodide (PI) exert marked differences in their efficacy. Whereas liposome-encapsulated PI (L-PI) was about 5 times more active in killing macrophages than L-propamidine, liposome-encapsulated EB (L-EB) showed a strongly reduced activity (10 times less than L-PI). As is shown here, PI remains mainly encapsulated in liposomes, while substantial amounts of EB leak out of liposomes. This may very well explain the differences in in vivo activity between L-EB and L-PI...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) {{continues}} to be a major cause of serious infections in hospitals and in the community worldwide. In this study, MRSA isolated from patients in Kuwait hospitals were analyzed for resistance trends and the genetic location of their resistance determinants. Methods Between April 1994 and December 2004, 5644 MRSA isolates obtained from different clinical samples were studied for resistance to antibacterial agents according to guidelines from the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards and the British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy. The genetic location of their resistance determinants was determined by curing and transfer experiments. Results They were resistant to aminoglycosides, erythromycin, tetracycline, trimethoprim, fusidic acid, ciprofloxacin, chloramphenicol, rifampicin, mupirocin, cadmium acetate, mercuric chloride, <b>propamidine</b> isethionate and ethidium bromide but susceptible to vancomycin, teicoplanin and linezolid. The proportion of the isolates resistant to erythromycin, ciprofloxacin and fusidic acid increased during the study period. In contrast, the proportion of isolates resistant to gentamicin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim declined. High-level mupirocin resistance increased rapidly from 1996 to 1999 and then declined. They contained plasmids of 1. 9, 2. 8, 3. 0, 4. 4, 27 and 38 kilobases. Genetic studies revealed that they carried plasmid-borne resistance to high-level mupirocin resistance (38 kb), chloramphenicol (2. 8 – 4. 4 kb), erythromycin (2. 8 – 3. 0 kb) and cadmium acetate, mercuric chloride, <b>propamidine</b> isethionate and ethidium bromide (27 kb) and chromosomal location for methicillin, the aminoglycosides, tetracycline, fusidic acid, ciprofloxacin and trimethoprim resistance. Thus, the 27 kb plasmids had resistance phenotypes similar to plasmids reported in MRSA isolates in South East Asia. Conclusion The prevalence of resistance to erythromycin, ciprofloxacin, high-level mupirocin and fusidic acid increased whereas the proportion of isolates resistant to gentamicin, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and trimethoprim declined during the study period. They contained 27 -kb plasmids encoding resistance to cadmium acetate, mercuric chloride, <b>propamidine</b> isethionate and ethidium bromide similar to plasmids isolated in MRSA from South East Asia.

40|$|A 28 -year-old female with {{a history}} of contact lens wear {{presented}} with a 1 week history of pain and photophobia in her left eye. In vivo confocal microscopy (IVCM) and corneal scrape confirmed the diagnosis of Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) which was treated with intensive topical <b>propamidine</b> isethionate (0. 1 %) and chlorhexidine (0. 02 %) with tapering dosage over 11 months. Five years after complete resolution of AK and cessation of all contact lens wear, the subject presented to her optometrist {{with a history}} of ocular discomfort and mild photophobia. Without further investigation she was prescribed topical corticosteroids. Three weeks later she presented with pain and reduced vision in the left eye.

40|$|Purpose:Late {{presenting}} {{cases of}} Acanthamoeba keratitis are particularly difficult to treat. The organism can persist, despite treatment with chlorhexidine or PHMB, maintaining an active infection. New drug therapies with enhanced activity are therefore needed to treat this painful, potentially blinding infection. This study was undertaken {{to determine the}} efficacy of three anti–cancer drugs against Acanthamoeba. Methods:Doubling dilutions of MGBG [10 – 0. 15 mg/ml (38. 5 – 0. 6 mM) ], CHS 828 [660 – 10 µg/ml (1782 – 27 µM) ] and hexadecyl–phosphocholine [HePC, Miltefosine; 660 – 10 µg/ml (1782 – 27 µM) ] were tested alone or in combination with chlorhexidine, PHMB and <b>propamidine,</b> for efficacy against Acanthamoeba castellanii trophozoites or cysts. Sensitivity assays were performed over 48 h in 96 –well microtitre plates. Results: MGBG killed trophozoites at 300 µg/ml (1. 2 mM) and cysts at 1250 µg/ml (4. 6 mM). The combination drugs {{had no effect on}} the cysticidal concentration of MGBG, but PHMB and <b>propamidine</b> may have an additive effect against trophozoites. CHS 828 caused rounding up of trophozoites, but had no effect on amoebal viability. HePC killed both trophozoites and cysts at 330 µg/ml (0. 8 µM). Against trophozoites, <b>propamidine</b> had an additive effect on HePC reducing the inhibitory concentration to 82 µg/ml (0. 2 mM) and 165 µg/ml (0. 4 mM) when added at high (4 µg/ml) and low (1 µg/ml) concentrations, respectively. Synergy between HePC and the combination drugs was found against cysts, being most active for chlorhexidine when added at a concentration of 2 µg/ml, reducing the minimum cysticidal concentration of HePC to < 10 µg/ml. Conclusions:At the concentrations tested CHS 828 did not demonstrate any amoebicidal activity and as such is unlikely to be a potential therapeutic agent. The concentration of MGBG required to eradicate cysts may prevent its use in therapy. HePC shows potential as a therapeutic agent as synergy was demonstrated between HePC and the biguanides against cysts, but there may be some antagonism against trophozoites.

30|$|The best {{treatment}} for microsporidial keratitis {{has not been}} established. Treatment with 0.02 % polyhexamethylene biguanide does not offer any significant advantage over placebo [5]. Microsporidial infections in HIV-infected individuals may respond to combination of antibiotics and antiparasitic agents, including topical <b>propamidine</b> isethionate, topical fumagillin, topical fluoroquinolones, oral albendazole, and/or oral itraconazole. However, treatment often has been followed by recrudescence of infection [1, 4, 7, 10]. One report describes unmasking of microsporidiosis infection following HAART-induced immune recovery [11], likely representing an immune recovery inflammatory syndrome [12].

Methods: In this prospective interventional case series, 31 eyes of 31 patients with Acanthamoeba keratitis (AK) were treated with chlorhexidine 0. 02 % as monotherapy, from April 2010 to April 2011. The diagnosis of AK was made based on clinical manifestations and positive confocal microscopic (confoscan 3. 4, Nidek Co. Ltd., Gamagori, Japan) results. We report the percentage of a favorable clinical response within two weeks of initiating treatment, worsening of the infection while receiving chlorhexidine, recovery of visual acuity (VA), duration of treatment with chlorhexidine and corticosteroids, necessity for addition of other anti-Acanthamoeba agents, presence of corneal scar {{at the end of}} the treatment, and need for penetrating keratoplasty (PK). Results: Two weeks after initiation of chlorhexidine, improvement in signs and symptoms was observed in 26 (83. 9 %) patients but 3 eyes required the addition of <b>propamidine.</b> After initial improvement in one patient, the infection worsened, necessitating the addition of Polyhexamethylene Biguanide (PHMB) and <b>propamidine.</b> A total of 26 (83. 9 %) patients received topical corticosteroids with mean duration of 65. 8 ± 45. 1 days. In 22 (71 %) eyes, final visual acuity was≥ 0. 80. Improved VA occurred in 29 eyes (93. 5 %). Optical PK was considered in 3 (9. 7 %) eyes and a corneal scar developed in 8 (25. 8 %) eyes. Conclusion: Chlorhexidine is effective for monotherapy in AK and could be a good choice for initiating treatment. After the initial response to anti-Acanthamoeba agents, corticosteroids can be used as adjunctive therapy depending on the clinical condition...|$|E
40|$|During 1990, {{a strain}} of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus became {{epidemic}} in Spain and spread in a manner analogous to that of EMRSA- 1 in England. Isolates of this strain produced little protein A and were resistant {{to a number of}} antibiotics including ciprofloxacin. Beta-lactamase production was encoded by a c. 39 kb plasmid, which also conferred resistance to mercury, cadmium, ethidium bromide and <b>propamidine</b> isethionate. Investigation showed that two variants, separable by supplementary and Fisk phage typing, were circulating. The B variant appeared to spread more readily than the A variant. The opportunity was taken to compare the discriminatory power of traditional typing methods with molecular techniques. The discriminatory power of the molecular techniques used only reached the same level as the traditional methods when double enzyme digestion of total cellular DNA by EcoR I and Cla I was performed...|$|E
