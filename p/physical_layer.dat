HSIC uses two signals at 1.2V and has a throughput of 480Mbit/s. Maximum PCB trace length for HSIC is 10cm. It does not have low enough latency to support RAM sharing between two chips.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{the modest}} {{popularity}} of IBM Token Ring in the 1980s and 1990s, virtually all LANs now use either wired or wireless Ethernet facilities. At the <b>physical</b> <b>layer,</b> most wired Ethernet implementations use copper twisted-pair cables (including the common 10BASE-T networks). However, some early implementations used heavier coaxial cables and some recent implementations (especially high-speed ones) use optical fibers. When optic fibers are used, the distinction {{must be made}} between multimode fibers and single-mode fibers. Multimode fibers {{can be thought of}} as thicker optical fibers that are cheaper to manufacture devices for, but that suffers from less usable bandwidth and worse attenuation – implying poorer long-distance performance.|$|E
