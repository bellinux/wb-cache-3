5|$|During the Consulate, Napoleon faced several royalist and Jacobin {{assassination}} plots, {{including the}} Conspiration des poignards (Dagger <b>plot)</b> in October 1800 and the <b>Plot</b> of the Rue Saint-Nicaise (also {{known as the}} Infernal Machine) two months later. In January 1804, his police uncovered an assassination <b>plot</b> against him that involved Moreau and which was ostensibly sponsored by the Bourbon family, the former rulers of France. On the advice of Talleyrand, Napoleon ordered the kidnapping of the Duke of Enghien, violating the sovereignty of Baden. The Duke was quickly executed after a secret military trial, {{even though he had}} not been involved in the <b>plot.</b> Enghien's execution infuriated royal courts throughout Europe, becoming one of the contributing political factors for the outbreak of the Napoleonic Wars.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode of}} Degrassi is written {{following}} the same formula {{with two or three}} storylines (<b>Plot</b> A, <b>Plot</b> B and <b>Plot</b> C). The main storyline, A, opens and closes the episode and is usually driven by a single character. <b>Plot</b> B is usually more comedic in tone and sometimes slightly intertwined with the other stories, often moving story arcs forward. <b>Plot</b> C was usually used sporadically in a season-long arc, but is now used in every episode as comedic relief. The problems and issues presented in the episode are not always resolved {{by the end of the}} episode, and are carried over to the next, or create a mini-arc over several episodes. The majority of episodes are named after songs from the 1980s, and since the tenth season, episodes are named after songs from the 1990s to the present, representing the entering of a new decade and a completely different cast from the earlier seasons. For the first nine seasons, Degrassi: The Next Generation had been produced as a weekly half-hour teen comedy-drama series, with each season consisting of between fifteen and twenty-four episodes.|$|E
30|$|The species {{composition}} of invaded and un-invaded <b>plots</b> {{was found to}} be distinct (Fig.  4 a–c). Among the six species of Davidiellaceae, only two, namely Cladosporium pseudocladosporioides and Cladosporium xylophilum, were common between invaded and un-invaded plots; others occurred exclusively in the un-invaded <b>plots.</b> Likewise, three species of Pleosporaceae, {{out of a total of}} five members, occurred only in C. sumatrensis invaded <b>plots</b> and both the members of Mycosphaerellaceae were also found only in the invaded <b>plots.</b> Peziza subcitrina (Pezizaceae), Paraphoma chrysanthemicola (Phaeosphaeriaceae), and Penicillium sp. (Trichocomaceae) were also confined to invaded <b>plots.</b> Pleosporaceae was more species rich in the invaded <b>plots</b> where three species of this family occurred. Likewise, members of Mycosphaerellaceae, Phaeosphaeriaceae, Trichocomaceae, and Ascobolaceae were exclusive to <b>plots</b> invaded by C. sumatrensis. As in case of bacteria, the abundance of those fungi that occurred in both invaded and un-invaded <b>plots</b> also varied between these <b>plots.</b> While Davidiellaceae included only 8  % of the total of 24 identified species in the invaded <b>plots,</b> it represented 40  % of the total identified species in the un-invaded <b>plots.</b> Pleosporaceae represented 20  % of the identified species in the invaded <b>plots</b> but only 13  % in the un-invaded <b>plots.</b> In contrast to exclusive occurrence of certain species to either invaded or un-invaded <b>plots,</b> the only representative of Myxotrichaceae occurred in both invaded and un-invaded <b>plots.</b> Didymellaceae was represented by two members, one of which, namely Didymella phacae occurred in invaded <b>plots</b> while the other Leptosphaerulina americana was common to invaded and un-invaded <b>plots.</b>|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Forest <b>plots</b> are {{graphical}} {{displays of}} findings of systematic reviews and meta-analyses. Little {{is known about}} the style and content of these <b>plots</b> and whether published <b>plots</b> maximize the graphic's potential for information exchange. METHODS: We examine the number, style and content of forest <b>plots</b> presented in a previously studied cross-sectional sample of 300 systematic reviews. We studied all forest <b>plots</b> in non-Cochrane reviews and a sample of forest <b>plots</b> in Cochrane reviews. RESULTS: The database contained 129 Cochrane reviews and 171 non-Cochrane reviews. All the Cochrane reviews had forest <b>plots</b> (2197 in total), and a random sample of 500 of these <b>plots</b> were included. In total, 28 of the non-Cochrane reviews had forest <b>plots</b> (139 in total), all of which were included. <b>Plots</b> in Cochrane reviews were standardized but often contained little data (80 % had three or fewer studies; 10 % had no studies) and always presented studies in alphabetical order. Non-Cochrane <b>plots</b> depicted a larger number of studies (60 % had four or more studies) and 59 % ordered studies by a potentially meaningful characteristic, but important information was often missing. Of the 28 reviews that had a forest <b>plots</b> with at least 10 studies, 3 (11 %) had funnel <b>plots.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Forest <b>plots</b> in Cochrane reviews were highly standardized but some of the standards do not optimize information exchange, and many of the <b>plots</b> had too little data to be useful. Forest <b>plots</b> in non-Cochrane reviews often omitted key elements but had more data and were often more thoughtfully constructed...|$|R

5|$|In the PlayStation 2 version, {{there are}} nine <b>plot</b> lines that the player will {{have the chance to}} experience, one for each of the heroines in the story except Sango and Ruri, who share the same <b>plot</b> line. This is {{expanded}} to ten <b>plot</b> lines in the Windows and PlayStation Portable versions with the addition of Sasara's scenario, and further expanded to eleven scenarios in the PlayStation 3 version with the addition of Mio's scenario. In order to view all of the <b>plot</b> lines, the player will have to replay the game multiple times and make different decisions to progress the <b>plot</b> in alternate directions. In all versions, the game also contains a bad ending in which the player is unable to pursue the other scenarios. This ending serves as the basis of the Another Days scenario in To Heart 2 Another Days, which allows the player to pursue an additional seven heroines.|$|E
