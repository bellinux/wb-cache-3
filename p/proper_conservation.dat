500|$|Although the Eastern small-footed bat {{is listed}} as a species of least concern on the IUCN red list, many states in which the bat resides have begun listing it has a {{threatened}} species and have begun conservation efforts {{in order to improve}} its numbers. This species is not protected by federal law, but was a former C2 candidate for listing prior to the abolishment of that category by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife service in 1996. Some states (e.g. Pennsylvania) have given the species legal protection while others have recognized its apparently low numbers and consider the eastern small-footed Myotis a species of concern. In the report Species of Special Concern in Pennsylvania by Genoways and Brenner (1985), the Pennsylvania Biological Survey assigned Myotis leibii the status of [...] "threatened". Other states, such as Virginia, are currently working to get the Eastern small-footed Myotis legal protection. Despite these efforts not many conservation projects have been put in place to help the species. Due to their strange hibernation patterns, and the lack of information regarding their spring and summer roosting locations <b>proper</b> <b>conservation</b> efforts are very difficult. The bats will not usually use bat boxes like many other bat species, due to their tendency to nest alone or in very small groups, so this is not an appropriate action to assist in habitat disturbance issues with this species.|$|E

Off-shore movement to deeper reef locations occurs around both new and full moons. This study has also confirmed anecdotal reports that the North Bight is an important spawning migration corridor for bonefish. ^ This information is critical for the protection of bonefish and identifies important habitats (e. g. migration corridors and pre-spawning aggregations) on Andros that warrant protection from coastal degradation or fishing pressures. ...|$|R
