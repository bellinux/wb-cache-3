40|$|Young {{people in}} Malawi face many challenges. Primary {{education}} {{is struggling with}} poor internal efficiency, low quality and poor educational outcomes. Access to post-primary education is limited and highly selective. The majority {{of young people who}} exit the formal education system dropout in the primary cycle. Few out-of-school youth have had access to technical, vocational or entrepreneurial training, or the chance to develop key skills to support and sustain livelihoods in the country’s predominantly rural-based economies. Until recently education and skills development for out-of-school youth was given scant attention at the national level. However, in response to growing concerns about the ability to meet Education for All (EFA) targets and to support poverty alleviation strategies, the Malawi government now acknowledges the need for alternative approaches to basic education in order to cater for out-of-school children and youth. In 2006, the Complementary Basic Education (CBE) programme was launched in Malawi, first piloted and then expanded across several rural districts in Malawi. This background paper presents an overview and analysis of the role of Complementary Basic Education in the educational provision for out-of-school youth. In doing so, it focuses on the expectations, participation and outcomes of older learners, as well as the challenges faced in the delivery of curriculum content and practical <b>pre-vocational</b> skills <b>training</b> in light of the differing needs of children and youth. It explores the interface between basic education and skills development and reflects on lessons to be learnt with regard to the design, implementation and mainstreaming of complementary and non-formal education programmes...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Eye {{conditions}} are common presentations in Australian general practice, {{with the potential}} for serious sequelae. <b>Pre-vocational</b> ophthalmology <b>training</b> for General Practitioner (GP) trainees is limited. Aim: To describe the rate, nature and associations of ophthalmic problems managed by Australian GP trainees, and derive implications for education and training. Methods: Cross-sectional analysis from an ongoing cohort study of GP trainees' clinical consultations. Trainees recorded demographic, clinical and educational details of consecutive patient consultations. Descriptive analyses report trainee, patient and practice demographics. Proportions of all problems managed in these consultations that were ophthalmology-related were calculated with 95 % confidence intervals (CI). Associations were tested using simple logistic regression within the generalised estimating equations (GEE) framework. Results: In total, 884 trainees returned data on 184, 476 individual problems or diagnoses from 118, 541 encounters. There were 2649 ophthalmology-related problems, equating to 1. 4 % (95 % CI: 1. 38 - 1. 49) of all problems managed. The most common eye presentations were conjunctivitis (32. 5 % of total problems), eyelid problems (14. 9 %), foreign body (5. 3 %) and dry eye (4. 7 %). Statistically significant associations were male trainee; male patient and patient aged 14 years or under; the problem being new and the patient being new to both trainee and practice; urban and of higher socioeconomic status practice location; the practice nurse not being involved; planned follow up not arranged; referral made; in-consultation information sought; and learning goals generated. Discussion: Trainees have comparable ophthalmology exposure to established GPs. However, associations with referral and information-seeking suggest GP trainees find ophthalmic problems challenging, reinforcing the critical importance of appropriate training...|$|R
40|$|Many {{countries}} with apprenticeship-based systems of VET face {{a shortage of}} apprenticeships. Some countries, including Denmark and Norway, address this supply-demand mismatch by offering alternative school-based routes to vocational qualifications for students not able to secure an apprenticeship. Other countries offer no alternative routes, but focus instead on <b>pre-vocational</b> education and <b>training</b> {{to prepare students for}} apprenticeships. This paper discusses the effects on the VET system of a recent Norwegian attempt to organise alternative training primarily as workplace training. Unlike the more established Danish system of alternative training, which relies primarily on school-based training in learning centres, Norway has attempted to make alternative training as similar to apprenticeship-based learning as possible. Most training in the pilot projects takes place in the work environment of a company, rather than in vocational schools. Our paper shows that the students in the pilot projects experience many of the learning and motivational benefits offered by workplace learning in general, and apprenticeships in particular. In certain circumstances, such schemes can improve the chances of completing VET despite for young people without an apprenticeship. However, such training schemes also generate important dilemmas. In particular, there is a risk that full-scale implementation of a system of alternative workplace-based training could reduce the number of new apprenticeships, potentially undermining the apprenticeship model on which Norwegian VET is based...|$|R

40|$|The {{bachelor}} thesis {{deals with}} the employment of disabled people and with their integration into the labour market - the open labour market or the protected one. The theoretical part points out particular situation of disabled people. It {{is concerned with the}} <b>pre-vocational</b> and vocational <b>training,</b> the possibilities of occupational rehabilitations and the following success in the labour market thanks to help desks of Job centre or in non-profit sector within the supported employment. Practical part deals with research based on quantitative research using the techniques of the questionnaire and the interview. The main aim of the thesis is to map and analyse sheltered workshops in South Bohemian region, and {{to find out how to}} possibly increase the success of disabled people in the labour market. The subsidiary aim is the comparison of situations in the labour market between districts České Budějovice and Tábor. As for the research, there are four hypotheses. H 1 : Employers are little interested in the employment of disabled people because of low qualification and frequent sickness absence. H 2 : It is too complicated to raise money from Job centre for foundation of sheltered workshop. H 3 : The amount of contributions to support the employment of disabled people at sheltered workshops is insufficient. H 4 : The employers who take the disabled people into employment reward their employees for their work done. According to the results of research, H 1 was not confirmed. H 2 was not confirmed since the employers do not find the process of asking for contributions complicated. H 3 was not confirmed as well, because it turned out that the employers do not consider the amount of contributions to support employing disabled people insufficient. H 4 was confirmed, the employers really reward their employees for their work done, and some of them even add rewards for well-done work.

30|$|The {{transition}} system {{consists of}} a number of <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>training</b> programmes in different occupational fields. These pre-vocational programmes vary considerably with respect to the specific entry requirements for trainees and with regard to their curricula emphases. In particular, low-skilled young people with no or with a minimal educational certificate usually attend at least one (or more) vocational preparation programme before beginning an apprenticeship. The objective of all pre-vocational education programmes is to provide vocational orientation, to promote basic competencies of all attendees and thereby improve the likelihood of them obtaining a proper school leaving certificate (general school diploma) [Hauptschulabschluss] or to achieve a higher school leaving certificate, in particular an intermediate school diploma [Mittlerer Schulabschluss]. The last one can be considered as usual entry requirement for an apprenticeship (Baethge et al. 2007; Greinert and Braun 2005; Autorengruppe Bildungsberichterstattung 2016). Moreover, the programmes are designed to support the intersection between occupational orientation and training to prepare students for an apprenticeship, which is in Germany a combination of in-firm based and school-based learning (Dual System).|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Main goal of {{this review}} is to {{identify}} predictive factors for the outcome of Individual Placement and Support (IPS) {{with a focus on}} Supported Employment (SE) and of <b>pre-vocational</b> <b>training</b> (PVT) of individuals with mental illness. METHOD: A systematic search of PsychInfo, PubMed, PsychIndex and PsyArticles was conducted.
