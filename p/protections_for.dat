5|$|Although many {{leaders of}} the Congress sought a strong central {{government}} for an Indian state, some Muslim politicians, including Jinnah, were unwilling to accept this without powerful <b>protections</b> <b>for</b> their community.

5|$|Because it {{catered to}} gay people, the bar became a {{flashpoint}} for the nascent homophile movement. The Black Cat {{was at the}} center of a legal fight that was one of the earliest court cases to establish legal <b>protections</b> <b>for</b> gay people in the United States. Despite this victory, continued pressure from law enforcement agencies eventually forced the bar's closure in 1964.|$|E

5|$|In 1992, {{members of}} the European Union signed an {{agreement}} known as the Maastricht Treaty, under which they pledged to limit their deficit spending and debt levels. Some EU member states, including Greece and Italy, were able to circumvent these rules and mask their deficit and debt levels {{through the use of}} complex currency and credit derivatives structures. The structures were designed by prominent US investment banks, who received substantial fees in return for their services and who took on little credit risk themselves thanks to special legal <b>protections</b> <b>for</b> derivatives counterparties. Financial reforms within the U.S. since the financial crisis have only served to reinforce special <b>protections</b> <b>for</b> derivatives—including greater access to government guarantees—while minimising disclosure to broader financial markets.|$|E

Section 11(a) prohibits any person acting under color of law from refusing or failing to allow a qualified person to vote or to count a qualified voter's ballot. Similarly, Section 11(b) prohibits any person from intimidating, harassing, or coercing another person for voting or attempting to vote. Two provisions in Section 11 address voter fraud: Section 11(c) prohibits people from knowingly submitting a false voter registration application to vote in a federal election, and Section 11(e) prohibits voting twice in a federal election.|$|E
5|$|The Court {{made clear}} that the {{interests}} of children should be assumed to be covered as part of the interests of the parent, not treated as separate, but this doctrine has been less clear in practice as termination proceedings still focus on the fitness of the parent. This has resulted in further constitutional <b>protections</b> <b>for</b> parents and increasingly formal termination proceedings that limit the contribution of the child's interests in the proceedings. Santosky has also contributed to the role of parental rights of undocumented immigrants as the constitutionally protected parental rights may apply to non-citizens as well as United States citizens.|$|E
5|$|The {{music group}} Chari Jazz formed in 1964 and {{initiated}} Chad's modern music scene. Later, more renowned {{groups such as}} African Melody and International Challal attempted to mix modernity and tradition. Popular groups such as Tibesti have clung faster to their heritage by drawing on sai, a traditional style of music from southern Chad. The people of Chad have customarily disdained modern music. However, in 1995 greater interest has developed and fostered the distribution of CDs and audio cassettes featuring Chadian artists. Piracy {{and a lack of}} legal <b>protections</b> <b>for</b> artists' rights remain problems to further development of the Chadian music industry.|$|E

He {{was too weak}} to travel to Frankfort for his inauguration, so the oath of office was administered at his home on September 3, 1867. Helm's secretary of state read the governor's inaugural address at the Hardin County Courthouse. In it Helm repeated his intent to remove political disabilities from ex-Confederates. He also charged that Congress was meddling in the affairs of the states. Though he promised <b>protections</b> <b>for</b> blacks, he opposed the idea of black suffrage.|$|E
5|$|By 1964, {{membership}} {{had risen}} to 80,000, and the ACLU participated in efforts to expand civil liberties. In the 1960s, the ACLU continued its decades-long effort to enforce {{separation of church and}} state. It defended several anti-war activists during the Vietnam War. The ACLU was involved in the Miranda case, which addressed conduct by police during interrogations, and in the New York Times case, which established new <b>protections</b> <b>for</b> newspapers reporting on government activities. In the 1970s and 1980s, the ACLU ventured into new legal areas, involving the rights of homosexuals, students, prisoners, and the poor. In the twenty-first century, the ACLU has fought the teaching of creationism in public schools and challenged some provisions of anti-terrorism legislation as infringing on privacy and civil liberties. Fundraising and membership spiked after the 2016 election; the ACLU's current membership is more than 1.2 million.|$|E
5|$|During {{the period}} of English control over Scotland, there is some {{evidence}} to suggest that King Edward I attempted to abolish Scottish laws that were contrary to English law, as he had done in Wales. Under Robert I in 1318, a parliament at Scone enacted a code of law that drew upon older practices, but it was also dominated by current events and focused on military matters and the conduct of the war. Nevertheless, the Act also codified procedures for criminal trials and <b>protections</b> <b>for</b> vassals from ejection from the land. From the fourteenth century, there are surviving examples of early Scottish legal literature, such as the Regiam Majestatem (on procedure at the royal courts) and the Quoniam Attachiamenta (on procedure at the baron courts), which drew on both common and Roman law.|$|E

5|$|Following the Glorious Revolution of 1688 in England, {{when the}} Catholic King James II of England was deposed and the Protestant William III ascended the throne, a {{rebellion}} of Maryland Puritan Protestants overthrew Calvert's rule. They quickly rescinded the Toleration Act and banned public practice of Catholicism, {{and it would}} never be reinstated under colonial rule. In fact, the colony established the Church of England as its official church in 1702 and explicitly barred Catholics from voting in 1718. The Calvert family regained control over the colony in 1715, but only after Benedict Calvert converted to Protestantism. His political control remained tenses enough that he did not risk an attempt to reinstate <b>protections</b> <b>for</b> Catholics. It took until the era of the American Revolution for religious tolerance or freedom to again become the practice in Maryland.|$|E
5|$|The {{substance}} of the Agreement (formally {{referred to as the}} Belfast Agreement) was later endorsed by referendums in both parts of Ireland. The Agreement restored self-government to Northern Ireland on the basis of power-sharing in a regional Executive drawn from the major parties in a new Northern Ireland Assembly, with entrenched <b>protections</b> <b>for</b> the two main communities. The Executive is jointly headed by a First Minister and deputy First Minister drawn from the unionist and nationalist parties. Violence had decreased greatly after the Provisional IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994 and in 2005 the Provisional IRA announced the end of its armed campaign and an independent commission supervised its disarmament and that of other nationalist and unionist paramilitary organisations.|$|E
5|$|Breckinridge was {{appointed}} as the state's attorney general soon after arriving. In November 1797, he resigned and {{was elected to}} the Kentucky House of Representatives the next month. As a legislator, he secured passage of a more humane criminal code that abolished the death penalty for all offenses except first-degree murder. On a 1798 trip to Virginia, an intermediary gave him Thomas Jefferson's Kentucky Resolutions, which denounced the Alien and Sedition Acts. At Jefferson's request, Breckinridge assumed credit for the modified resolutions he shepherded through the Kentucky General Assembly; Jefferson's authorship was not discovered until after Breckinridge's death. He opposed calling a state constitutional convention in 1799 but was elected as a delegate. Due to his influence, the state's government remained comparatively aristocratic, maintaining <b>protections</b> <b>for</b> slavery and limiting the power of the electorate. Called the father of the resultant constitution, he emerged from the convention as the acknowledged leader of the state's Democratic-Republican Party and was selected Speaker of the Kentucky House of Representatives in 1799 and 1800.|$|E

5|$|Districts {{established}} under U.S. {{federal guidelines}} generally {{begin the process}} of designation through a nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. The National Register is the official recognition by the U.S. government of cultural resources worthy of preservation. While designation through the National Register does offer a district or property some protections, it is only in cases where the threatening action involves the federal government. If the federal government is not involved, then the listing on the National Register provides the site, property or district no <b>protections.</b> <b>For</b> example, if company A wants to tear down the hypothetical Smith House and company A is under contract with the state government of Illinois, then the federal designation would offer no protections. If, however, company A was under federal contract the Smith House would be protected. A federal designation is little more than recognition by the government that the resource is worthy of preservation.|$|E
5|$|When the 39th Congress {{assembled}} in December 1865, Hayes {{was sworn in}} {{as a part of a}} large Republican majority. Hayes identified with the moderate wing of the party, but was willing to vote with the radicals for the sake of party unity. The major legislative effort of the Congress was the Fourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution, for which Hayes voted and which passed both houses of Congress in June 1866. Hayes's beliefs were in line with his fellow Republicans on Reconstruction issues: that the South should be restored to the Union, but not without adequate <b>protections</b> <b>for</b> freedmen and other black southerners. President Andrew Johnson, who succeeded to office following Lincoln's assassination, to the contrary wanted to re-admit the seceded states quickly without first ensuring that they adopted laws protecting the newly freed slaves' civil rights; he also granted pardons to many of the leading former Confederates. Hayes, along with congressional Republicans, disagreed. They worked to reject Johnson's vision of Reconstruction and to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1866.|$|E
5|$|From Maryland's {{earliest}} days, Cecil Calvert had enjoined its colonists {{to leave}} religious rivalries behind. Along with giving {{instructions on the}} establishment and defense of the colony, he asked the men he appointed to lead it to ensure peace between Protestants and Catholics. He also asked the Catholics to practice their faith as privately as possible, {{so as not to}} disturb that peace. The Ordinance of 1639, Maryland's earliest comprehensive law, expressed a general commitment to the rights of man, but did not specifically detail <b>protections</b> <b>for</b> religious minorities of any kind. Peace prevailed until the English Civil War, which opened religious rifts and threatened Calvert's control of Maryland. In 1647, after the death of Governor Leonard Calvert, Protestants seized control of the colony. Cecil Calvert, 2nd Baron Baltimore, quickly regained power, but recognized that religious tolerance not specifically enshrined in law was vulnerable. This recognition was combined with the arrival of a group of Puritans whom Calvert had induced to establish Providence, now Annapolis, by guaranteeing their freedom of worship. Partially to confirm the promises he made to them, Calvert wrote the Maryland Toleration Act and encouraged the colonial assembly to pass it. They did so on April 21, 1649.|$|E
