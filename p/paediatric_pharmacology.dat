This article presents the databases available in the UK for medication research and gives some examples of paediatric studies conducted. The databases discussed include the Prescription Pricing Authority database, the General Practice Research Database, IMS Health databases (Medical Data Index, MIDAS Prescribing Insights, Disease-Analyser-Mediplus) and the Yellow Card Scheme.

40|$|Aim: Drug-related {{problems}} (DRP) are "an {{event or}} circumstance involving drug therapy that actually or potentially {{interferes with the}} desired health outcome". The extent and characteristics of DRPs in children in the UK and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) are unknown. Our aim {{was to determine the}} epidemiology of and identify risk factors for DRPs in hospitalised children. Methods: A prospective cohort study was carried out in children aged 0 - 18  years, admitted to the medical ward, paediatric intensive care unit (PICU) and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) during a 3 -month period in two hospitals. Patients' charts, medical records and laboratory data were reviewed daily to identify DRPs; their preventability and severity were assessed. Logistic regression was used to analyse the potential risk factors associated with DRP incidence. Results: Seven hundred and thirty-seven children (median age 2. 3  years, interquartile range 6  months to 8  years, 58. 1 % male) were included. Three hundred and thirty-three patients suffered from 478 DRPs. Overall DRP incidence was 45. 2 % (95 % CI, 41. 5 - 48. 8); KSA (51. 1 %; 95 % CI, 45. 8 - 56. 3), UK (39. 4 %; 95 % CI, 34. 4 - 44. 6). Incidence was highest in the PICU (59. 7 %; 95 % CI, 47. 0 - 71. 5). Dosing problems were the most frequently reported DRPs (n = 258, 54 %). 80. 3 % of DRP (n = 384) cases were preventable; 72. 2 % (n = 345) of DRPs were assessed as minor; 27 % (n = 129) as moderate. Number of prescriptions and type of admission (transferred) were potential risk factors for DRP occurrence in children. Conclusions: Drug-related problems were common in the hospitalised children in this study; the most frequent were dosing problems and drug choice problems; the majority of them were preventable. Polypharmacy and transferred admission (another hospital or ward) were potential risk factors. To improve prescribing practices and minimise the risk of DRPs in hospitalised children, <b>paediatric</b> <b>pharmacology</b> and pharmacotherapy are important in medical education. © 2012 Springer-Verlag. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|<b>Paediatric</b> {{clinical}} <b>pharmacology</b> is {{the scientific}} study of medicines in children and is a relatively new subspecialty in paediatrics in the UK. Training encompasses both the study of the effectiveness of drugs in children (clinical trials) and aspects of drug toxicity (pharmacovigilance). Ethical issues in relation to clinical trials and also studies of the pharmacokinetics and drug metabolism in children are crucial. Paediatric patients require formulations that young children in particular are able to take. The scientific evidence generated from clinical trials, pharmacokinetic studies and studies of drug toxicity all need to be applied {{in order to ensure that}} medicines are used rationally in children...|$|R

PP 166 This journal issue contain abstracts of the 11 th ISoP Annual MeetingBACKGROUND: Drug-related problem (DRP) is ‘‘an {{event or}} {{circumstance}} involving drug therapy that actually or potentially {{interferes with the}} desired health outcome’’. [1] The extent and characteristics of DRPs in children in the UK and Saudi Arabia (KSA) is unknown. AIM: Our aim was to identify the incidence and characteristics of DRPs in children attending A&E/admitted {{to a hospital in}} the two countries. METHODS: A prospective cohort study in children aged 0 – 18 years admitted to the medical ward, paediatric intensive care unit (PICU), and neonatal intensive care unit (NICU) or attending A&E during a three month period in two hospitals were carried out. Data were collected on a form adapted from the Pharmaceutical Care Network in Europe (PCNE) DRP-Registration Form V 5. 01. Patients’ charts, medical records and laboratory data were reviewed daily to identify DRPs; their preventability and severity were assessed. RESULTS: 990 children [median 3 years, IQR; 10 months – 8 years, 58. 6 % male] were included. 388 patients suffered from 546 DRPs. Overall DRP incidence was 39. 2 % (95 % CI, 36. 1, 42. 3) being higher in KSA than in the UK (44. 8 % vs 33. 3 %, p< 0. 001). Incidence was found to be highest in PICU (59. 7 %; 95 % CI, 47. 0, 71. 5). Dosing problems were the most frequently reported DRPs (n= 303, 55. 5 %), followed by drug choice problems (n = 91, 16. 7 %). 80. 0 % of DRP cases were preventable; 71. 4 % (n = 390) DRPs were assessed as minor and 27. 8 %(n = 152) as moderate. 295 (54. 0 %) were totally resolved, of which 220 (74. 6 %) were resolved by pharmacists. CONCLUSIONS: DRPs are a significant problem in the paediatric population in the UK and KSA, the majority of which are preventable. Increased focus on <b>paediatric</b> <b>pharmacology</b> and pharmacotherapy within paediatric medical and nursing education is an important step in improving prescribing practices. link_to_OA_fulltextThe 11 th Annual Meeting of the International Society of Pharmacovgilance (ISOP 2011), Istanbul, Turkey, 26 - 28 October 2011.

40|$|There {{are limited}} data on incidences of drug related {{problems}} (DRPs) including adverse drug reactions (ADRs) in children. The {{aim of this}} thesis is to increase knowledge of the incidence of ADRs and other DRPs and to enhance the understanding of risk factors for ADRs across several countries. This should facilitate the development of appropriate prevention strategies. Two large prospective cohort studies were conducted; ADVISE" recruited patients from five countries to investigate the incidence and characteristics of ADRs. Multivariable regression analysis was conducted to identify risk factors associated with ADRs in hospitalised children. The second study investigated DRPs in children attending the A&E department and/or admitted {{to a hospital in}} the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) and the UK. ADRs and other DRPs were identified using intensive chart review. In the ADVISE study, 1278 children were included (Australia n= 149, Germany n= 376, UK n= 313, HK n= 143, Malaysia n= 300). The overall ADR incidence was 18. 5 % (95 % Cl, 16. 3 - 20. 9). There was significant variation in incidence between countries (p< 0. 001), the highest was in the UK (34. 9 %). The use of ~five low risk drugs per patient or ~three high risk drugs (e. g. opioids) were strong predictors for ADRs (OR 4. 7, 95 % CI, 2. 4 - 9. 3; OR 6. 5, 95 % CI, 2. 7 - 16. 0; respectively, p< 0. 001). In the second study, 990 children were included (KSA n= 507, UK n= 483). The overall incidence of DRPs was 39. 2 % (95 % Cl, 36. 1 - 42. 3). Incidence was highest in the paediatric intensive care units (59. 7 %; 95 % CI, 47. 0 - 71. 5). Dosing problems were the most frequent DRP (n= 303, 55. 5 %). 80. 0 % (n= 437) of DRPs were preventable. Using standardised methods in both studies enabled comparison of incidences of ADRs and DRPs between countries. The variation between countries was considered to be mainly due to differences in treatment strategies. These studies indicated that improvements to current procedures could reduce DRPs and hence improve patients' health. Also, a focus on <b>paediatric</b> <b>pharmacology</b> and pharmacotherapy within paediatric medical education is important to improve prescribing practices and paediatric patient safety.
