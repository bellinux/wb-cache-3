25|$|In July 1998, amateur {{observers}} in Texas observed an unidentified object flashing in geosynchronous orbit. The object was subsequently lost, however it was rediscovered in June 2000 when its flashes became brighter; some even visible {{with the naked}} eye. Following the 2000 observations amateur observers were still unable to identify the satellite, so began referring to it by the <b>pseudo</b> International Designator 2000-653A and <b>pseudo</b> Satellite Catalog Number 90007.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pseudo</b> steady-state. Although {{fluctuations}} in heat generation will occur the thermal field around the tool remains effectively constant, {{at least on}} the macroscopic scale.|$|E
25|$|In {{the case}} of {{spectral}} karyotyping, image processing software assigns a <b>pseudo</b> color to each spectrally different combination, allowing the visualization of the individually colored chromosomes.|$|E
25|$|Some web-servers and {{bioinformatics}} prediction {{methods have}} been used for predicting the classification of GPCRs according to their amino acid sequence alone, by means of the <b>pseudo</b> amino acid composition approach.|$|E
25|$|Subsequent to this, various {{modes of}} Chou's <b>pseudo</b> amino acid {{composition}} were developed {{for improving the}} quality of predicting subcellular localization of apoptosis proteins based on their sequence information alone.|$|E
25|$|Minkowski's {{geometric}} {{interpretation of}} relativity was to prove vital to Einstein's development of his 1915 {{general theory of}} relativity, wherein he showed how mass and energy curve this flat spacetime to a <b>Pseudo</b> Riemannian manifold.|$|E
25|$|The Temple of Zeus Olympius at Agrigentum, is termed Pseudo-periteral heptastyle, {{because its}} {{encircling}} colonnade has <b>pseudo</b> columns that {{are attached to}} the walls of the naos. (figure 8.) Heptastyle means that it has seven columns across the entrance front.|$|E
25|$|Despite {{the shared}} name, habitat type, and diet, {{as well as}} a unique {{enlarged}} bone called the <b>pseudo</b> thumb (which helps them grip the bamboo shoots they eat) the giant panda and red panda are only distantly related.|$|E
25|$|A <b>pseudo</b> alum is {{a double}} sulfate of the typical formula , where A is a {{divalent}} metal ion, such as cobalt (wupatkiite), manganese (apjohnite), magnesium (pickingerite) or iron (halotrichite or feather alum), and B is a trivalent metal ion.|$|E
25|$|Subtract {{the partial}} product {{resulting}} from the MSB (<b>pseudo</b> sign bit) instead of adding it like the other partial products. This method requires the multiplicand's sign bit to be extended by one position, being preserved during the shift right actions.|$|E
25|$|Pseudo.com - One of {{the first}} live {{streaming}} video websites. <b>Pseudo</b> produced its own content in a SoHo, NYC studio and streamed up to 7 hours of live programming a day from its website in a format divided into channels by topic.|$|E
25|$|The {{function}} of a protein is closely correlated with the organelle in which it resides. Some methods were proposed for predicting the organelle in which an uncharacterized protein is located according to its amino acid composition and some methods were based on <b>pseudo</b> amino acid composition.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} equations outline a fully three-dimensional mathematical {{problem that}} {{is very difficult to}} solve even with simplifying assumptions. Until recently, limitations in computational power, forced these equations to be simplified to an Inviscid two-dimensional problem with <b>pseudo</b> losses. Before the advent of computers, these equations were almost always simplified to a one-dimensional problem.|$|E
25|$|A fictitious force (also {{called a}} <b>pseudo</b> force, two {{involving}} rotation: centrifugal force and Coriolis force; and a fourth, called the Euler force, {{caused by a}} variable rate of rotation, should that occur. Gravitational force {{would also be a}} fictitious force based upon a field model in which particles distort spacetime due to their mass.|$|E
25|$|Unlike {{the command}} su, users supply their {{personal}} password to sudo if necessary. After authentication, {{and if the}} configuration file permits the user access, the system invokes the requested command. By default the user's password can be retained through a grace period (15 minutes per <b>pseudo</b> terminal), allowing the user to execute several successive commands as the requested user without having to provide a password again.|$|E
25|$|McCoy {{considered}} Blob's mutation useless which enraged Blob. Dukes freed himself, {{and attacked}} his experimenter. Havok came to McCoy's rescue, but Dukes {{proved to be}} even {{too much for the}} Prelate to handle. His <b>pseudo</b> freedom was fleeting for moments later the head of the pens, Havok's older brother Cyclops, showed up to deliver a searing optic blast that would put him back in his place.|$|E
25|$|Categories involve Protein-coding, <b>Pseudo</b> genes, RNA genes, Genetic Loci, Gene {{clusters}} and Uncategorized. The default option {{is searching for}} all categories. GIFtS is the GeneCards Inferred Functionality Scores, which gives objective numbers to show the knowledge level about the functionality of human genes. It includes High, Medium, Low or you can give custom range. Symbol Sources include HGNC (HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee), EntrezGene (gene-centered information at NCBI), Ensembl, GeneCards RNA genes, CroW21 and so on.|$|E
25|$|A {{definition}} for Lie derivatives of spinors along generic spacetime vector fields, not necessarily Killing ones, on a general (<b>pseudo)</b> Riemannian manifold was already proposed in 1972 by Yvette Kosmann. Later, it was provided a geometric framework which justifies her ad hoc prescription within the general framework of Lie derivatives on fiber bundles in the explicit context of gauge natural bundles which {{turn out to}} be the most appropriate arena for (gauge-covariant) field theories.|$|E
25|$|For {{purposes}} of cryptography the more bases a we test, i.e. if we pick a sufficiently large value of k, {{the better the}} accuracy of test. Hence the chance of the algorithm failing {{in this way is}} so small that the (<b>pseudo)</b> prime is used in practice in cryptographic applications, but for applications for which {{it is important to have}} a prime, a test like ECPP or Pocklington should be used which proves primality.|$|E
25|$|Additionally, the Service is the {{responsible}} authority for {{national and international}} cooperation {{in the fight against}} terrorism, for preparing and maintaining terrorist threat assessments, for monitoring extremist phenomena, and for performing security clearances for personnel recruited into sensitive positions. Supo reports to other security authorities and the Government of Finland on its activities. According to the Police Act, Supo can utilize, among others, traffic data monitoring, covert intelligence gathering, undercover activities, <b>pseudo</b> purchases, and controlled delivery to fulfill its mission.|$|E
25|$|In Islam, {{scholars}} of Islamic jurisprudence have detailed {{discussions on the}} status and rights of intersex based on what mainly exhibits in their external sexual organs. Yet, modern Islamic jurisprudence scholars turn to medical screening to determine the dominance of their sex. The intersex rights includes rights of inheritance, rights to marriage, rights to live like any other male or female. The rights are generally based on whether they are true hermaphrodites, or <b>pseudo</b> hermaphrodite. Scholars of Islamic jurisprudence generally consider their rights based on the majority of what appears from their external sexual organs.|$|E
25|$|Supreme Court of Comedy â€“ a <b>pseudo</b> judge {{show that}} premiered in 2008, with {{stand-up}} comic/actor Dom Irrera as the judge. Several comedians or actors play {{lawyers in the}} series, including Kevin Pollak, Jon Lovitz, Jamie Kennedy, Paul Mooney, Tom Papa, Tom Arnold, Bobby Lee, Paul Rodriguez, Aries Spears, George Wallace, Victoria Jackson, Rich Hall, Louie Anderson and Bob Marley. The plaintiffs and defendants seen in each episode are regular people with actual small claims court cases; however, the show has no legal standing and is meant for entertainment purposes only.|$|E
25|$|The Windows Search API {{can also}} be used to convert a search query written using Advanced Query Syntax (or Natural Query Syntax, the natural {{language}} version of AQS) to SQL queries. It exposes a method GenerateSQLFromUserQuery method of the ISearchQueryHelper interface. Searches {{can also be}} performed using the search-ms: protocol, which is a <b>pseudo</b> protocol that lets searches be exposed as an URI. It contains all the operators and search terms specified in AQS. It can refer to saved search folders as well. When such a URI is activated, Windows Search, which is registered as a handler for the protocol, parses the URI to extract the parameters and perform the search.|$|E
25|$|The {{strength}} of random passwords {{depends on the}} actual entropy of the underlying number generator; however, these are often not truly random, but <b>pseudo</b> random. Many publicly available password generators use random number generators found in programming libraries that offer limited entropy. However most modern operating systems offer cryptographically strong random number generators that are suitable for password generation. It is also possible to use ordinary dice to generate random passwords. See stronger methods. Random password programs often {{have the ability to}} ensure that the resulting password complies with a local password policy; for instance, by always producing a mix of letters, numbers and special characters.|$|E
25|$|The {{northern}} Maya area (Campeche and Yucatan) shows {{characteristics of}} its own. Its Classic Puuc, Chenes, and Rio Bec architecture {{is characterized by}} the geometrical reduction of realistic decoration; the stacking of rain god snouts to build facades; the use of portals shaped like serpent mouths; and, in the Rio Bec area, the use of solid <b>pseudo</b> temple-pyramids. The most important Puuc site is Uxmal. Chichen Itza, dominating Yucatan from the Late Classic to well into the Post-Classic, features Classic buildings in Chenes and Puuc style as well as Post-Classic building types of Mexican derivation, such as the radial four-staircase pyramid, the colonnaded hall, and the circular temple. The latter features were inherited by the succeeding kingdom of Mayapan.|$|E
25|$|The largest {{above ground}} {{structure}} is the bus station, with its entrance {{on the east}} side of Spadina Road just north of Bloor Street, which currently serves as the terminus of the 127 Davenport bus route. Originally, it was built to serve as a looping facility for the former 77 Spadina bus which operated until the underground streetcar loop was added and the buses were replaced by 510 Spadina streetcars. This rather subdued building, with its <b>pseudo</b> mansard roof and brick arches and no obvious bold signage like most other station entrances, is located at the easterly end of the Bloor line platforms. There is a more typical secondary entrance building, directly opposite, on the west side of Spadina Road.|$|E
25|$|In 1081, fire {{once again}} struck the cathedral, and the {{appearance}} of the Salian western end is not known. In 1100, Henry IV ordered reconstruction in the old Lombardic style. The old flat chancel end on the east side was replaced with a large apse, which external gallery with a narrow arcade supported by short columns crowned the semicircular wall with a wide <b>pseudo</b> arcade and tall pillasters on both sides. The new chancel had a triple-nave crypt. The damaged square tower had been replaced with an octagonal dome, above which an octagonal tower was added later. Flanking stair turrets remained from the first cathedral. These changes closely resembled the renovations Henry had overseen on Speyer Cathedral a few years earlier.|$|E
25|$|Multicolor FISH and {{the older}} {{spectral}} karyotyping are molecular cytogenetic techniques used to simultaneously visualize all the pairs of chromosomes in an organism in different colors. Fluorescently labeled probes for each chromosome are made by labeling chromosome-specific DNA with different fluorophores. Because there are {{a limited number of}} spectrally distinct fluorophores, a combinatorial labeling method is used to generate many different colors. Fluorophore combinations are captured and analyzed by a fluorescence microscope using up to 7 narrow-banded fluorescence filters or, in the case of spectral karyotyping, by using an interferometer attached to a fluorescence microscope. In the case of an mFISH image, every combination of fluorochromes from the resulting original images is replaced by a <b>pseudo</b> color in a dedicated image analysis software. Thus, chromosomes or chromosome sections can be visualized and identified, allowing for the analysis of chromosomal rearrangements.|$|E
25|$|The usual mastopexy {{patient is}} the woman who desires the {{restoration}} of her bust (elevation, size, and contour), because of the post-partum volume losses of fat and milk-gland tissues, and the occurrence of breast ptosis. The clinical indications presented by the womanâ€”the degrees of laxness of the suspensory Cooperâ€™s ligaments; and of the breast skin-envelope (mild, moderate, severe, and <b>pseudo</b> ptosis)â€”determine the applicable restorative surgical approach for lifting the breasts. Grade I (mild) breast ptosis can be corrected solely with breast augmentation, surgical and non-surgical. Severe breast ptosis can be corrected with breast-lift techniques, such as the Anchor pattern, the Inverted-T incision, and the Lollipop pattern, which are performed with circumvertical and horizontal surgical incisions; which produce a periareolar scar, at the periphery (edge) of the nipple-areola complex (NAC), and a vertical scar, descending from the lower margin of the NAC to the horizontal scar in the infra-mammary fold (IMF), where the breast meets the chest; such surgical scars are the aesthetic disadvantages of mastopexy.|$|E
25|$|Newton's laws {{of motion}} {{describe}} {{the motion of}} an object in an inertial (non-accelerating) frame of reference. When Newton's laws are transformed to a rotating frame of reference, the Coriolis force and centrifugal force appear. Both forces are proportional to {{the mass of the}} object. The Coriolis force is proportional to the rotation rate and the centrifugal force is proportional to its square. The Coriolis force acts in a direction perpendicular to the rotation axis and to the velocity of the body in the rotating frame and is proportional to the object's speed in the rotating frame (more precisely, to the component of its velocity that is perpendicular to the axis of rotation). The centrifugal force acts outwards in the radial direction and is proportional to the distance of the body from the axis of the rotating frame. These additional forces are termed inertial forces, fictitious forces or <b>pseudo</b> forces. They allow the application of Newton's laws to a rotating system. They are correction factors that do not exist in a non-accelerating or inertial reference frame.|$|E
25|$|A pure SR {{analysis}} {{would be}} as follows: Analyzed in Stella's rest frame, she is motionless for the entire trip. When she fires her rockets for the turnaround, she experiences a <b>pseudo</b> force which resembles a gravitational force. Figs.2â€‘6 and 2â€‘11 illustrate the concept of lines (planes) of simultaneity: Lines parallel to the observer's x-axis (xy-plane) represent sets of events that are simultaneous in the observer frame. In Fig.2â€‘11, the blue lines connect events on Terence's world line which, from Stella's point of view, are simultaneous with events on her world line. (Terence, in turn, would observe a set of horizontal lines of simultaneity.) Throughout both the outbound and the inbound legs of Stella's journey, she measures Terence's clocks as running slower than her own. But during the turnaround (i.e. between the bold blue lines in the figure), a shift {{takes place in the}} angle of her lines of simultaneity, corresponding to a rapid skip-over of the events in Terence's world line that Stella considers to be simultaneous with her own. Therefore, {{at the end of her}} trip, Stella finds that Terence has aged more than she has.|$|E
500|$|Since {{the release}} of Ivy Bridge microarchitecture, Intel Xeon {{processors}} support the so-called <b>pseudo</b> target row refresh (pTRR) {{that can be used}} in combination with pTRR-compliant DDR3 dual in-line memory modules (DIMMs) to mitigate the row hammer effect by automatically refreshing possible victim rows, with no negative impacts on performance or power consumption. [...] When used with DIMMs that are not pTRR-compliant, these Xeon processors by default fall back on performing DRAM refreshes at twice the usual frequency, which results in slightly higher memory access latency and may reduce the memory bandwidth by up to 24%.|$|E
500|$|In mid-1996, a new venue {{known as}} [...] "Caesars Magical Empire" [...] was created on the property, {{showcasing}} major magicians such as Michael Ammar, Jon Armstrong, Lee Asher, Whit Haydn,, Jeff [...] "Magnus" [...] McBride, and Alain Nu [...] [...] The [...] "Empire" [...] was an extravagantly-themed immersive dining and entertainment experience, {{housed in a}} [...] specially-built building, designed to serve 2,400 people daily. The interior of the entire complex was decorated in a combination of <b>pseudo</b> cave-and-classic architecture, with faux rock-work and stone, passageways, and real marble floors. It closed on November 30, 2002, after which the structure was razed {{to make room for}} a large concert hall created for singer Celine Dion.|$|E
500|$|The false {{catshark}} {{was first}} described by Portuguese ichthyologist FÃ©lix de Brito Capelo in the Jornal do SciÃªncias MathemÃ¡ticas, Physicas e Naturaes in 1868. He based his account on a [...] long adult male caught off Setubal, Portugal. Brito Capelo thought the specimen resembled {{a member of}} the genus Triakis, except lacking a nictitating membrane (though it is now known that this species does in fact have this trait). Thus, he assigned it to the new genus Pseudotriakis, from the Greek <b>pseudo</b> ("false"). At the time, Triakis was classified with the catsharks, hence [...] "false catshark". The specific name microdon comes from the Greek mikros ("small") and odontos ("tooth"). Other common names for this species are dumb shark (from its Japanese name oshizame) and keel-dorsal shark.|$|E
500|$|Eaten Alive {{proved to}} be {{controversial}} even before its premiere, attracting criticism from animal rights groups such as People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals (PETA), who argued that Rosolie's stunt {{was an example of}} animal cruelty, while an online petition on Change.org urging Discovery Channel to pull the special reached over 25,000 signatures. PETA objected to the use of an animal for [...] "entertainment", and {{went on to say that}} [...] "making this snake use up energy by swallowing this fool and then possibly regurgitating him would have left the poor animal exhausted and deprived of the energy that he or she needs. Shame on this <b>pseudo</b> 'wildlife expert' for tormenting this animal, and shame on the Discovery Channel for giving him the incentive to do so." ...|$|E
500|$|UGO Networks writer Jon Lachonis stated, [...] "If {{you were}} on the fence before, [...] will drag you kicking and {{screaming}} into the dark world of Fringe science wielding bogeymen. [...] "In Which we Meet Mr. Jones" [...] is what Fringe promised it would be from the beginning, a suspense driven procedural that probes deep into our technological phobias. With this new formulation of Fringe, we get the challenge of a sophisticated crime drama mixed with sad sack characters that tempt the everyman into the game, while blowing us away with a level of wordplay and <b>pseudo</b> science that CSI or Alias could only have dreamed of." [...] The A.V. Club's Noel Murray enjoyed the episode, giving it a B+, while Television Without Pity gave the episode a B-.|$|E
