40|$|Today it {{is common}} {{practice}} for the carrier to sub-contract the contracted carriage of goods. For the carrier to perform the carriage himself is now more of an exception. That the carrier will use only one type of transport is also uncommon, as the contracts of carriage today normally will cover the whole carriage, compelling the carrier to use different modes of transportation. When the carriage is sub-contracted, the carrier will use other carriers to perform the contractual obligations for him. This means {{that there will be}} a second, and sometimes a third, contractual layer involved. A common feature is a carrier who does not have the capability to perform the carriage at all. These “paper carriers” or non-vessel operating common carriers (NVOCC) will thus sub-contract all parts of the carriage. This thesis will mainly examine the responsibility for and liability of the sub-carrier. The basis will be the International Convention for the Unification of Certain Rules of Law relating to Bills of Lading (“Hague Rules”), and <b>Protocol</b> <b>of</b> <b>Signature</b> (Brussels, 25 August 1924) and the Hague-Visby Rules - The Hague Rules as Amended by the Brussels Protocol 1968 (“Hague-Visby Rules”), as the countries compared in this study have all signed and ratified these rules. The thesis will start with a background to the problems posed by these rules with regards to sub-carriers, which are mainly the identity of the carrier, to ascertain who your contractual carrier and sub-carrier is, and the problem with suing the sub-carrier in tort; thereby possible avoiding the defences and limitations available to the carrier. The thesis is a dogmatic, international study, comparing two different legal systems and a new international convention. Focus will also be on the historical development of the carrier's liability for the sub-carrier and the sub-carrier's liability towards third parties. First the solution in the United Kingdom will be presented, as they have stayed true to the Hague-Visby Rules. Secondly the solution in Norway, Denmark, Sweden and Finland (“Scandinavian countries”), with main focus on the Norwegian legislation will be presented. The Scandinavian countries have tried to align their legislation as far as possible with the United Nations Convention on the Carriage of Goods by Sea, 1978 (“Hamburg Rules”) without having to derogate from the Hague-Visby Rules. As a third part of this thesis, the United Nations Convention Rules for the International Carriage of Goods Wholly or Partly by Sea, 2008 (“Rotterdam Rules”) will be presented as an alternative solution...|$|E

We study effective data transmission meant for cluster-basis sensor system, in our work in which clusters are created dynamically and intermittently. We aim to study the proposals regarding two Secure and Efficient data Transmission procedures for cluster-based wireless sensor networks known as secure and effective data transmission-Identity-based on {{digital signature}} and secure and effective data transmission-based on online/offline digital signature. Data transmission protocol based on Identity based online/offline digital signature is projected to further decrease computational overhead for security by means of secure and effective data transmission-based on online/offline digital signature in which security depends on hardness of discrete logarithmic complexity. Identity-based <b>protocol</b> <b>of</b> digital <b>signature</b> on basis <b>of</b> complexity of factoring integers from cryptography of identity-basis is to obtain an entity’s public key from its identity information. The important notion of proposed data transmission protocols is to authenticate encrypted sensed data, by means of application <b>of</b> digital <b>signatures</b> which are efficient in communication.

40|$|This study {{analyzes}} taphonomic {{alteration of}} brachiopod shells, i. e., Bouchardia rosea (Mawe) from Ubatuba Bay, northern coast of São Paulo State, Brazil. The {{average age of}} the studied shell deposits is 674 years BP. The underlying hypothesis is that taphonomic signatures are not uniformly distributed along a bathymetric gradient. Assemblages were sampled using a Van Veen grab sampler (31 x 40 cm) along transect of fourteen stations from zero (beach) to 35 m water depth. Four sedimentary environments were recognized: (a) beach, (b) protected bay with clay bottom, (c) protected bay with sandy bottom, and (d) inner shelf with sandy bottom. All brachiopod shells (i. e., total fraction including fragments) from each of the five stations with appreciable accumulations (up to 1607 shells) were investigated following a <b>protocol</b> <b>of</b> ten taphonomic <b>signatures.</b> Six <b>of</b> these ten taphonomic signatures (articulation, fragmentation, edge alteration, color alteration, bioerosion, and encrustation) were homogeneously distributed among studied environments, indicating that these general types <b>of</b> taphonomic <b>signatures</b> per se are not sensitive to environmental conditions in this case. on the other hand, shell surface texture varied along the bathymetric gradient, thus showing a high potential to be used in taphofacies analyses. Several examples of taphonomic generalizations available in the literature are neither applicable nor comparable to our results, which further confirm that overgeneralizations should be avoided in taphonomic studies...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: A {{new type}} <b>of</b> <b>signature</b> is {{presented}} in this paper, named adaptable group-oriented signature. In contrast with traditional group-oriented signature, the new one laid {{a strong emphasis on}} how to improve the signer’s efficiency. In fact, this new type <b>of</b> group-oriented <b>signature</b> {{can be seen as a}} type <b>of</b> designated verifier <b>signature.</b> In contrast with the ordinary designated verifier signature, it does not designate one member but several members to independently verify the signature. The designated members, who can independently verify the signature, come into a group. This scheme can ensure the anonymity of the verifiers.
