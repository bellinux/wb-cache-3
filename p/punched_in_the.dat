5|$|When Dave Rosten, another Sydney evangelist, {{attempted}} to imitate Jenner's method of evangelism, he was <b>punched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> midriff {{by the first}} person he spoke to, so he decided that Jenner's approach to evangelism was not for others to emulate. In 1947, Jenner asked his question to a man named Angus Carruthers, who responded {{that he was a}} Christian and going to heaven. Jenner invited Carruthers back to his home, where Carruthers met Jenner's daughter, Ann. Carruthers and Ann married three years later.|$|E
50|$|Crotch Puncher - Represents Spain. He {{is dressed}} like a bullfighter and has a giant left hand.

5|$|The {{frustration}} at #1 Records obstructed sales contributed to tension within the band. There was physical fighting between members: Bell, after being <b>punched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face by Hummel, retaliated by smashing Hummel's new bass guitar to pieces against the wall. Hummel took revenge {{at a later}} date: finding Bell's acoustic guitar in the latter's unattended car, he repeatedly punched it with a screwdriver. In November 1972, Bell quit the band. When work continued on songs for a second album, Bell rejoined, but further conflict soon erupted. A master tape of the new songs inexplicably went missing, and Bell, whose heavy drug intake was affecting his judgment, attacked Fry's parked car. In late 1972, struggling with severe depression, Bell quit the band once more, {{and by the end}} of the year Big Star disbanded.|$|E
5|$|After writing One Hundred Years of Solitude García Márquez {{returned}} to Europe, this time bringing along his family, {{to live in}} Barcelona, Spain, for seven years. The international recognition García Márquez earned {{with the publication of}} the novel led to his ability to act as a facilitator in several negotiations between the Colombian government and the guerrillas, including the former 19th of April Movement (M-19), and the current FARC and ELN organizations. The popularity of his writing also led to friendships with powerful leaders, including one with former Cuban president Fidel Castro, which has been analyzed in Gabo and Fidel: Portrait of a Friendship. It was during this time that he was <b>punched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face by Mario Vargas Llosa in what became one of the largest feuds in modern literature. In an interview with Claudia Dreifus in 1982 García Márquez notes his relationship with Castro is mostly based on literature: “Ours is an intellectual friendship. It may not be widely known that Fidel is a very cultured man. When we’re together, we talk a great deal about literature.” This relationship was criticized by Cuban exile writer Reinaldo Arenas, in his 1992 memoir Antes de que Anochezca (Before Night Falls).|$|E

The group boards the train as it departs to New Orleans, and celebrate in John's honor. The epilogue shows them all having used their share of the gold for their own desired purposes; Handsome Rob purchases an Aston Martin Vanquish, Left Ear buys a mansion in southern Spain, while Napster buys a powerful stereo capable of blowing a woman's clothes off. Meanwhile, Charlie takes John's advice about finding someone he wants {{to spend the rest of}} his life with, and he and Stella travel to Venice together.|$|E

25|$|By far {{the most}} acrimonious of the debates has been that {{over the role of}} {{genetics}} in IQ differences, which led to Eysenck being <b>punched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face by a protestor during a talk at the London School of Economics, as well as bomb threats, and threats to kill his young children.

25|$|By 1952, Ambassador Atom {{proved to}} be only a mild success in Japan; however, one {{particular}} character became extremely popular with young boys: a humanoid robot named Atom. Tezuka received several letters from many young boys requesting further appearances from the robot. Expecting success with a series based around Atom, Tezuka's producer suggested that he be given human emotions. One day while working at a hospital Tezuka was <b>punched</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> face by a frustrated American G.I. This encounter gave Tezuka the idea to make Atom a humanoid robot fighting evil and defending the innocent. On February 4, 1952, Tetsuwan Atom began serialization in Weekly Shonen Magazine.
