2500|$|Reflecting {{their high}} stabilities, thiophenes arise from many {{reactions}} involving sulfur sources and hydrocarbons, especially unsaturated ones. [...] The first synthesis of thiophene by Meyer, reported {{the same year}} that he reported its discovery, involve acetylene and elemental sulfur. Thiophenes are classically prepared by the reaction of 1,4-diketones, diesters, or dicarboxylates with sulfidizing reagents such as <b>P4S10</b> such as in the Paal-Knorr thiophene synthesis. [...] Specialized thiophenes can be synthesized similarly using Lawesson's reagent as the sulfidizing agent, or via the Gewald reaction, which involves the condensation of two esters in the presence of elemental sulfur. Another method is the Volhard–Erdmann cyclization.|$|E
5000|$|Due to {{hydrolysis}} by atmospheric moisture, <b>P4S10</b> evolves H2S, thus <b>P4S10</b> {{is associated}} with a rotten egg odour. Aside from H2S, hydrolysis of <b>P4S10</b> eventually gives phosphoric acid: ...|$|E
50|$|Another useful {{reaction}} of LR is {{the conversion of}} a 1,4-diketone into a thiophene ring, this reaction {{can be done with}} <b>P4S10</b> but a much higher temperature would be required to make it work with <b>P4S10.</b>|$|E
5000|$|In organic {{chemistry}} <b>P4S10</b> {{is used as}} a thionation reagent. Reactions of this type require refluxing solvents such as benzene, dioxane, or acetonitrile with <b>P4S10</b> dissociating into P2S5. P2S5 can be trapped for example as the pyridine complex.|$|E
50|$|P3S {{contains}} a six membered P3S3 ring. The ammonium salt {{is produced by}} reaction of <b>P4S10</b> in liquid ammonia. Another way of visualising the structure {{is that it is}} the <b>P4S10</b> adamantane (P4O10) structure with a PS3+ vertex removed.|$|E
5000|$|Phosphorus pentasulfide is {{obtained}} by the reaction of liquid white phosphorus (P4) with sulfur above 300 °C. The first synthesis of <b>P4S10</b> by Berzelius in 1843 [...] was by this method. Alternatively, <b>P4S10</b> can be formed by reacting elemental sulfur or pyrite, FeS2, with ferrophosphorus, a crude form of Fe2P (a byproduct of P4 production from phosphate rock): ...|$|E
50|$|Other mild nucleophiles {{react with}} <b>P4S10,</b> {{including}} alcohols and amines. Aromatic compounds such as anisole, ferrocene and 1-methoxynaphthalene {{react to form}} 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfides such as Lawesson's reagent.|$|E
50|$|<b>P4S10</b> {{is one of}} {{the most}} stable {{phosphorus}} sulfides. It is most easily made by heating white phosphorus with sulfur above 570 K in an evacuated tube.|$|E
50|$|Like the boron oxides, B2S3 readily forms glasses when {{blended with}} other sulfides such as <b>P4S10.</b> Such glasses absorb lower {{frequencies}} of Infra-red energy relative to conventional borosilicate glasses.|$|E
50|$|P4S3 is {{produced}} by the reaction of red or white phosphorus with sulfur. Excess sulfur gives phosphorus pentasulfide (<b>P4S10).</b> It is estimated that 150 ton/y were produced in 1989.|$|E
50|$|While several {{different}} routes to the 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfides exist {{the most commonly}} used is the electrophilic aromatic substitution reaction of an arene with <b>P4S10.</b> An alternative reaction is the reaction of a thiol with <b>P4S10</b> to form a substance like the Davy reagent. The Davy reagent is identical to Lawesson's reagent except in place of the para-methoxyphenyl groups it has aryl sulfide groups. While the Davy reagent is more soluble than the Lawesson's reagent {{it is likely that the}} very vile nature of the thiol starting material is likely to make the synthesis of this compound not worth the trouble. In both the patent and academic chemical literature are examples of 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfides with higher solubilities. These highly soluble versions of Lawesson's reagent are created by the reaction of <b>P4S10</b> with aryl ethers which are different from anisole. For instance butoxybenzene and 2-tert-butylanisole have both been reacted to form more soluble thionation reagents of the 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide class.|$|E
5000|$|In {{organosulfur}} chemistry, sulfiding {{is often}} called thiation. The preparation of thioamides from amides involves thiation. A typical reagent is phosphorus pentasulfide (<b>P4S10).</b> The idealized equation for this conversion is: ...|$|E
50|$|Unlike most acetophenones, but {{reflecting}} {{the influence of}} the methoxy group, methoxyacetophenone undergoes a second acetylation. Many related reactions have been demonstrated. For example, <b>P4S10</b> converts anisole to Lawesson's reagent, (CH3OC6H4)PS22.|$|E
50|$|Phosphorus pentasulfide {{with the}} formula <b>P4S10,</b> is a {{molecular}} compound featuring tetrahedral phosphorus(V) centres. Trends in arsenic redox potentials suggest that As2S5 adopts a similar structure, a plausible alternative being an arsenic polysulfide.|$|E
50|$|In particular, α-P4S5 can {{be easily}} made by the {{photochemical}} reaction of <b>P4S10</b> with red phosphorus. Note that P4S5 is unstable when heated, tending to disproportionate to P4S3 and P4S7 before reaching its melting point.|$|E
5000|$|P4S9 {{can be made}} by two methods. One method {{involves}} the heating of P4S3 in excess sulfur. nothing method {{involves the}} heating of P4S7 and <b>P4S10</b> in 1:2 mole ratio, where P4S9 is reversibly formed: ...|$|E
50|$|An {{early and}} still {{powerful}} method for {{the synthesis of}} dithiolenes entails the reaction of α-hydroxyketones, acyloins, with <b>P4S10</b> followed by hydrolysis and treatment of the mixture with metal salts. This method is used to prepare NiS2C2Ar22 (Ar = aryl).|$|E
50|$|Ketones are {{converted}} to thioketones. In esters, imides and lactones the oxygen atom {{can also be}} replaced by sulfur. With amides the reaction product is a thioamide. With 1,4-diketones the reagent forms thiophenes. Compared to the better known Lawesson's reagent <b>P4S10</b> suffers from reduced yields.|$|E
50|$|Lawesson's reagent, or LR, is a {{chemical}} compound used in organic synthesis as a thiation agent. Lawesson's reagent was first made popular by Sven-Olov Lawesson, who did not, however, invent it.

50|$|Phosphorus pentasulfide is the {{inorganic}} compound with the formula P2S5 or dimer <b>P4S10.</b> This yellow solid {{is the one}} of two phosphorus sulfides of commercial value. Samples often appear greenish-gray due to impurities. It is soluble in carbon disulfide but reacts with many other solvents such as alcohols, DMSO, and DMF.|$|E
50|$|Approximately 150,000 tons of <b>P4S10</b> are {{produced}} annually. The compound is mainly converted to other derivatives {{for use as}} lubrication additives such zinc dithiophosphates. It is also used {{in the production of}} pesticides such as Parathion and Malathion. It is also a component of some amorphous solid electrolytes (e.g. 2S-P2S5) for some types of lithium batteries.|$|E
5000|$|Phosphorus sulfides {{comprise}} {{a family of}} inorganic compounds containing only phosphorus and sulfur. These compounds have the formula P4Sx with x ≤ 10. Two are of commercial significance, phosphorus pentasulfide (<b>P4S10),</b> which is made on a kiloton scale {{for the production of}} other organosulfur compounds, and phosphorus sesquisulfide (P4S3), used in the production of [...] "strike anywhere matches".|$|E
50|$|An {{important}} S-N compound is {{the cage}} tetrasulfur tetranitride (S4N4). Heating this compound gives polymeric sulfur nitride ((SN)x), which has metallic properties {{even though it}} does not contain any metal atoms. Thiocyanates contain the SCN− group. Oxidation of thiocyanate gives thiocyanogen, (SCN)2 with the connectivity NCS-SCN. Phosphorus sulfides are numerous, the most important commercially being the cages <b>P4S10</b> and P4S3.|$|E
5000|$|Molecular P4Se10 {{has been}} {{reported}} to share the same structure as <b>P4S10</b> and P4O10, [...] but one well-known textbook does not mention it at all. A review (2001) examining P-Se amorphous phases did not confirm the presence of molecular P4Se10. The isoelectronic anion Ge4Se104− which has the adamantane like P4O10 structure is known, an example is the sodium salt Na4Ge4Se10.|$|E

50|$|There {{are several}} other {{phosphorus}} sulfides {{in addition to}} P4S3 and <b>P4S10.</b> Six of these phosphorus sulfides exist as isomers: P4S4, P4S5, P4S6, P4S7, P4S8, and P4S9.

The silicon analogue of adamantane, sila-adamantane, was synthesized in 2005.Arsenicin A is a naturally occurring organoarsenic analogue isolated from the New Caledonian marine sponge Echinochalina bargibanti and is the first known polyarsenic organic compound.|$|E
50|$|A {{compound}} {{related to}} Lawesson's reagent named NpP2S4 has been {{formed by the}} reaction of 1-bromonaphthalene with <b>P4S10,</b> this is a 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfide which has a naphth-1,8-diyl group holding the two phosphorus atoms together. The mechanism by which the NpP2S4 forms is unclear, but it is thought to occur through some free radical process, and naphthalene has been detected as a side product in its synthesis. In general NpP2S4 {{has been found to}} be less reactive than Lawesson's reagent, this result agrees with the hypothesis that the dithiophosphine ylides are responsible for the majority of the chemical reactions of the 1,3,2,4-dithiadiphosphetane 2,4-disulfides.|$|E
