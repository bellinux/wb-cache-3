40|$|This work {{is focused}} on the design of a {{hydraulic}} device on which simulations of <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> can be performed. The hydraulic device was constructed to allow simulations of <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> transferred directly in operating conditions because simulation programs for hydraulic accumulators have only theoretical values while simulation on the designed hydraulic device enables obtaining specific readings directly in operating conditions that can be set. At the first control measurement on the hydraulic device, there occurred <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> generated by the hydraulic device itself, these <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> being undesirable in hydraulic circuits. In order to eliminate <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> in the circuit, a diaphragm accumulator was added to the hydraulic device and was used to verify the function of simulating <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> and eliminating undesirable <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks.</b> During the second control measurement on the hydraulic device, a reduction of unwanted <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> was shown with the help of added diaphragm accumulator, thus the function of the hydraulic device to simulate <b>pressure</b> <b>shocks</b> was confirmed, which may also refect practical application in hydraulic circuits of mobile machines...|$|R

30|$|Introduction Septic shock {{remains a}} major health issue {{even in our}} industrialized countries, with {{described}} mortality rates between 11.4 and 24.3  % {{in the most recent}} European studies. Several international pediatric therapeutic guidelines have been published and widely diffused. As for epinephrine, they recommend its use as a first-line drug in cold <b>shocks</b> <b>resistant</b> to a well-conducted fluid resuscitation or as a second-line drug in “cold” <b>shocks</b> <b>resistant</b> to dopamine or “warm” <b>shocks</b> <b>resistant</b> to norepinephrine. However, those recommendations are only based on adult or neonatal references that can hardly be applied to children as the physiopathology of children’s septic shock is different on several aspects. Thus, our study constitutes the first specifically pediatric work on epinephrine use in septic shock.|$|R

40|$|Although {{international}} {{guidelines for}} hemodynamic support of pediatric septic shock suggest considering the potent calcium sensitizer inodilator levosimendan as a second-line inotropic agent to treat cold hypodynamic <b>shock</b> <b>resistant</b> to catecholamines, clinical experience in septic infants is lacking.

Levosimendan infusion (0. 15 µg/kg/min) promptly increased both patients' myocardial contractility and improved tissue perfusion, thereby reducing lactate levels and increasing urine output. The only adverse effect was moderate hypotension in one infant, who reversed by adding norepinephrine to levosimendan.
