50|$|Monocryl is a synthetic, {{absorbable}} suture, {{manufactured in}} Cornelia, Georgia, USA, and trademarked by Ethicon. It {{is composed of}} <b>poliglecaprone</b> 25, which is a copolymer of glycolide and epsilon-caprolactone. It comes both dyed (violet) and undyed (clear), and is a monofilament suture.|$|E
50|$|It is {{generally}} used for soft-tissue approximation and ligation. It is used frequently for subcuticular dermis closures of the face. It has {{less of a}} tendency to exit through the skin after it breaks down, such as Vicryl. It is contraindicated for use in cardiovascular and neurologic tissues, and for usage in ophthalmic and microsurgery. The use of <b>Poliglecaprone</b> suture may be inappropriate in elderly, malnourished, or debilitated patients, or in patients suffering from conditions that may delay wound healing.|$|E
40|$|Background: Several {{methods for}} skin closure are used, i. e. sutures, {{adhesive}} papertape and tissue adhesives. Little {{is known about}} the efficacy of these techniques in laparoscopic surgery. This study was performed to analyse the efficacy of octylcyanoacrylate, a new tissue adhesive, adhesive papertape and <b>poliglecaprone</b> for wound closure in laparoscopy. Methods: From May 2000 to September 2001, 140 patients were included in a prospective randomized trial. Wounds were closed with octylcyanoacrylate (n= 48), adhesive papertape (n= 42) or <b>poliglecaprone</b> (n= 50). Closing time, wound infection, cosmetic results and costs were evaluated. A time-motion analysis was also performed. Results: The patients in the three groups were well matched for age, gender and body mass index. Closing times per wound were 26, 33 and 65 s respectively for adhesive papertape, octylcyanoacrylate and <b>poliglecaprone</b> (P < 0. 001). Cosmetic results, as scored by the patients, were no different. The number of actions required to close each wound was 5. 7, 8. 3 and 21. 0 for octylcyanoacrylate, adhesive papertape (P= 0. 05 versus octylcyanoacrylate) and <b>poliglecaprone</b> (P < 0. 01 versus octylcyanoacrylate and adhesive papertape) respectively. Octylcyanoacrylate was significantly more expensive than <b>poliglecaprone</b> and adhesive papertape. Conclusion: Closure with adhesive papertape was the fastest method. The smallest number of actions required to close a wound was with octylcyanoacrylate. Adhesive papertape was the most cost-effectiv...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Objective: {{to compare}} {{intraperitoneal}} adhesion formation in rats when using polypropylene and polypropylene with <b>poliglecaprone</b> meshes. Methods: we used twenty male, Wistar rats, divided in two groups. In group 1, the rats received the polypropylene mesh on their right {{side and the}} polypropylene with <b>poliglecaprone</b> mesh on their left side. In group 2 {{the position of the}} meshes was inverted. After 30 days, we analyzed the presence or not of adhesion formation, including only those over the meshes. The findings undergone an analysis through the Mann-Whitney test, at a level of significance of p&# 8804; 0. 05. Results: all meshes presented adhesions. We verified that, for the polypropylene meshes, the percentage of their surface covered by adhesions varied from 10. 5 to 100 %, with an average of 34. 07 ± 24. 21 %, while for the polypropylene with <b>poliglecaprone</b> mesh, the percentage covered by adhesions varied between 8. 5 % and 100 %, with an average of 44. 7 ± 32. 85 % (p= 0. 12). Conclusion: both meshes lead to adhesion formation, none being superior to the other...|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVOS: Neste estudo realizamos a análise clínica e histopatológica da reação tecidual dos fios de nylon e <b>poliglecaprone</b> 25 monofilamentares nas suturas interna e externa em ratos. MÉTODOS: Foram utilizados 40 Rattus norvegicus (Wistar) machos. O ato operatório consistiu de incisão e divulsão dos planos muscular e cutâneo {{realizadas}} na região posterior das coxas dos animais. As suturas internas e externas da coxa direita foram realizadas com o fio de nylon n° 5 - 0, e na coxa esquerda aplicamos o <b>poliglecaprone</b> 25 n° 5 - 0. Os animais foram divididos em 4 grupos (n= 10) de acordo com o tempo pós-operatório G 1 (7 dias), G 2 (14 dias), G 3 (21 dias) e G 4 (28 dias). Para a avaliação cínica foi considerada a ocorrência de deiscência, de exsudato e edema. Na análise histopatológica objetivou-se avaliar reação inflamatória, células gigantes de corpo estranho, proliferação fibroblástica e fibrose. RESULTADOS: Clinicamente, não foram observadas alterações nos grupos estudados. Histopatologicamente a reação inflamatória, presença de células gigantes de corpo estranho, proliferação fibroblástica e fibrose foram maiores nas suturas internas realizadas com Nylon. Nas suturas realizadas com <b>poliglecaprone</b> 25 essa reação declinou com o passar do tempo pós-operatório. CONCLUSÃO: De acordo com a metodologia empregada podemos concluir que as suturas externas realizadas com nylon induziram menor reação tecidual, enquanto que nas suturas internas este fio contribuiu para perpetuar a reação tecidual. As suturas externas realizadas com <b>poliglecaprone</b> 25 apresentaram maior reação tecidual, e suturas internas realizadas com o mesmo fio a reação tecidual declinou na medida em que o fio estava sendo absorvido. PURPOSE: The {{aim of this}} {{experimental study}} was to evaluate through a clinical and histopatological analysis the tissue reactivity caused by two monofilament sutures nylon and <b>poliglecaprone</b> 25 on {{the internal and external}} sutures in rats. METHODS: For this study, we used forty male Rattus novergicus (Wistar rats). The experimental procedures were incisions and divulsions performed {{on the back of the}} animals' thighs. Internal and external sutures were done on the right thigh using nylon 0 - 5, and on the left thigh using <b>poliglecaprone</b> 25 0 - 5. The animals were distributed in 4 groups of 10 rats, according postoperatory period on the 7, 14, 21 and 28 days, G 1 (7 th day), G 2 (14 th day), G 3 (21 th day) and G 4 (28 th day). The clinical assentment aimed to verify the existence of deiscence, exsudate and edema. The histopathologic analisy's was intended to eveluate the inflammatory reaction, foregin body giant cells, fibroblastic proliferation and fibrosis. RESULTS: Clinically, no changes were found on groups studied. Histopathological analysis inflammatory reaction, foregin body giant cells, fibroblastic proliferation and fibrosis were higher on the internal sutures with nylon. On the sutures done with <b>poliglecaprone</b> 25 showed an increase in tissue reactivity passing postoperatory period. CONCLUSIONS: On the basis of the methodology used in the study, it was concluded that external sutures done with nylon produce less tissue reactivity; on internal sutures, however, this material contributes to the maintenance of the tissue reaction. The external sutures done with <b>poliglecaprone</b> 25 showed a greater tissue reaction; on the external sutures the tissue reaction decreased while the thread was being absorbed...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare {{postoperative}} wound healing in canine ovariohysterectomy following the use of an absorbable monofilament <b>poliglecaprone</b> 25 suture in 2 different skin closure techniques, the buried continuous subcuticular (BCS) suture pattern and the simple interrupted (SI) suture pattern. These 2 skin closure techniques were evaluated against a nonabsorbable polypropylene monofilament suture in an SI pattern. Wounds were assessed by using a semiquantitative scoring system at 18 to 24 hours and 10 to 14 days, postoperatively. Results indicated that the BCS closure using <b>poliglecaprone</b> 25 demonstrated a higher rate of tissue reactivity initially (18 – 24 hours postoperatively), as compared with the SI closure using either suture material. By 10 to 14 days postoperatively, <b>poliglecaprone</b> 25 used in a BCS closure was associated with significantly lower wound scores than was the same material used in an SI closure. It was concluded that the BCS closure may effect a better cosmetic appearance to the skin closure in a canine ovariohysterectomy at the time of the recheck appointment. Furthermore, by obviating the need for suture removal, use of the BCS pattern may eliminate the requirement for this return appointment...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{compare the}} {{inflammatory}} reaction {{and the growing}} resistance of the abdominal wall {{with the use of}} <b>poliglecaprone</b> meshes and polypropylene meshes associated with <b>poliglecaprone</b> in the correction of abdominal defects. METHODS: Seventy-seven Wistar rats were divided into three groups: CG (non-operated animals: EG (polypropylene mesh) and UG (polypropylene and <b>poliglecaprone</b> mesh). A muscular and aponeurotic defect was formed and treated according to the group. Evaluations were made after 4, 7, 14, 28 and 56 days. The resistance and inflammatory pattern were studied. RESULTS: There was a gradual and significant gain in resistance, regularly in the EG and irregularly in the UG, which was lower on the 14 th day (p= 0. 008). The inflammatory reaction was acute and more intense in the UG on the fourth day. At all other times, the inflammatory pattern was acute to chronic, similar in both groups, with minimum intensity on the 56 th day. CONCLUSION: The greater resistance offered by the polypropylene mesh was regular and ascending, stabilizing on the 28 th day, while that of the polypropylene/poliglecaprone was not even. In the end, the resistances were similar. The inflammatory response was greater in the UG on the fourth day and similar at all other times...|$|E
40|$|RESTRITOTissue {{reaction}} to suture materials depends mainly {{on how the}} polymer they are composed of interacts with the tissues. There are few in vivo studies evaluating the suture material modifications resulting from its interaction with tissues. This paper aimed to study rat subcutaneous tissue {{reaction to}} irradiated polyglactin 910, polydioxanone, <b>poliglecaprone</b> 25 and chromic gut and its correlation with the ultra-structural alterations the materials undergo. The histological alterations were studied on the 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, 7 th and 14 th day after suture implantations. In these periods, the materials {{were removed from the}} tissues and their surfaces were analyzed by scanning electron microscopy. Irradiated polyglactin 910 stimulated the formation of multinucleated giant cells and its filaments underwent cleavage and dissolution. In potydioxanone, a few inflammatory cells and scar fibrosis was observed, and triangular cracks appeared on its surface. Around the <b>poliglecaprone</b> 25, a diffused infiltration of a few mononuclear cells and fibrosis was recorded and formation of craters was observed on its surface. Chromic gut induced necrosis and granulation tissue and underwent dissolution in the tissues during the studied periods. In this study, it was observed that suture materials induced differentiated tissue reactions and morphologic surface changes, suggesting that indications should be individualized...|$|E
30|$|Abdominal and vaginal {{techniques}} {{have been used}} to treat the prolapse, and the combined laparoscopic-vaginal approach has been advocated to avoid a prolonged hospital stay [20, 29].

Great care was taken to keep the mesh lying flat over vaginal mucosa to minimise erosion. The vault was suspended from the sacral promontory by the tail of the Y-mesh using Protak fasteners [1], and complete mesh peritonisation was performed with <b>poliglecaprone.</b> Continuous topical oestrogen therapy was re-commenced 2  weeks postoperatively.|$|E
40|$|OBJETIVO: Estudar comparativamente a cicatrização e a formação de aderências em baço de ratos submetidos à trauma operatório e corrigidos utilizando octil- 2 -cianoacrilato (DE) e fio de <b>poliglecaprone</b> 25 (CA). MÉTODO: 30 ratos machos Wistar foram separados em três grupos de 10 animais, anestesiados de acordo com as normas do COBEA, submetidos à laparotomia xifopúbica e com uma tesoura Metzenbaum, foi realizada uma lesão esplênica com 4 mm de profundidade, na borda anti-hilar do pólo {{inferior}} do baço. No Grupo CA, suturou-se a lesão com pontos contínuos de <b>poliglecaprone</b> 25; no Grupo DE, com octil- 2 -cianoacrilato e no Grupo CO, não houve sutura. Após 14 dias, os ratos foram submetidos à eutanásia e as aderências anotadas em protocolo próprio. O estudo anatomopatológico foi realizado nas colorações hematoxilina-eosina e Picro-Sirius, sendo do tipo fechado, duplo-cego. RESULTADOS: O Grupo DE apresentou menos aderências e menor reação de cicatrização tipo corpo estranho que o CA. Ambos mostram quantidade semelhante de colágeno jovem e maduro. CONCLUSÕES: O octil- 2 -cianoacrilato provocou menos aderências macroscópicas que o fio de <b>poliglecaprone</b> corado e não induziu cicatrização com reação de corpo estranho, mostrando-se efetivo no reparo das lesões traumáticas esplênicas, em ratos. BACKGROUND: To study comparatively {{the healing}} and the adhesion formation in rats' spleen that were submitted to spleen surgical trauma and sutured with octil- 2 -cyanoacrylate (DE group) and 25 -poliglecaprone thread (CA group). METHODS: Three groups of 10 Wilstar male rats each were used. They were anaesthetized {{according to the}} COBEA technique rules and were submitted to xyphoid-pubic laparotomy and the spleen was exposed. A 4 mm deep spleen injury at the inferior pole in diaphragmatic face was done with a Metzenbaum scissors. In the CA group the injured was sutured with continuous stitches using 25 -poliglecaprone thread; in the DE group octil- 2 -cyanoacrylate was used; and no suture {{was done in the}} CO group (control). After 14 days the rats underwent euthanasia and adhesions were noted in an appropriate protocol. Hematoxilin-eosin and Pycro-sirius stain films were made and readings were done in a double bind way. RESULTS: At DE group less adhesions, less abscess formation and smaller healing reaction of foreign body were seen than the CA group. Both showed equivalent quantity of young (type I) and mature (type III) collagen. CONCLUSION: Octil- 2 -cyanoacrylate provoked less macroscopic adhesions than 25 -poliglecaprone thread and it didn't induce healing reaction of foreign body type, showing effective repair in the traumatic injury of rats' spleen...|$|E

30|$|Our {{results suggest}} that polyglactin 910 {{may be the best}} choice for {{terrestrial}} annelids. Its low gross scores and relatively mild/bland microscopic changes as compared to controls may indicate it’s a good choice for other invertebrates with similar life styles. In addition all sutures were retained. This and monofilament suture materials produce the least amount of tissue reaction in several avian and domestic mammalian species (Bennett et al. 1997; DeNardo et al. 1996; Knowles 1976; Wood et al. 1984). Similar results were reported in fish, amphibians, and reptiles. Polyglyconate, a synthetic, absorbable, monofilament material, produced the least tissue reaction in koi carp (Cyprinus carpio), when compared with four other suture materials (Hurty et al. 2002). Consistent with these findings were favorable tissue reactions from monofilament nylon in African clawed frogs (Xenopus laevis) (Tuttle et al. 2002) and <b>poliglecaprone</b> (Sanz et al. 1988) and polyglyconate in juvenile loggerhead turtles (Caretta caretta) (Govett et al. 2004). Polyglyconate performed well to close a skin excisional biopsy site in a cuttlefish (Sepia officinalis); the sutures dislodged/dissolved on their own (Harms et al. 2006). Interestingly, {{this was not the case}} in another invertebrate, Aplysia californica, where silk, a braided organic material, was superior to the monofilament sutures examined (Anderson et al. 2010).|$|E
40|$|Objective: To compare {{bidirectional}} knotless barbed suture versus standard sutures, {{with either}} extracorporeal or intracorporeal knots, {{and to assess}} the feasibility, safety, and rapidity in repairing a uterine wall defect after laparoscopic myomectomy. Subjects and Methods: This was a randomized clinical study having a Canadian Task Force Classification of I. In tertiary-care university-based teaching hospitals, 117 women who underwent laparoscopic myomectomy were enrolled. In accord with randomization, uterine wall defects were closed with either extracorporeal (<b>poliglecaprone</b> 25; Monocryl™- 1; Ethicon Inc., Somerville, NJ) or intracorporeal (polyglactin 910; Vicryl™- 1; Ethicon Inc.) knots or a bidirectional knotless barbed suture (Quill™- 0; Angiotech Pharmaceuticals, Inc., Vancouver, BC, Canada). Results: Time required to suture was significantly lower in the group operated on with a bidirectional suture than in groups with traditional sutures (P<. 001). No significant difference was observed in operative time among the study groups. The degree of surgical difficulty was significantly lower in the Quill group than in the other groups. Conclusions: Use of barbed sutures reduces {{the time required to}} repair a uterine wall defect during laparoscopic myomectomy. In a follow-up of patients carried out at 3 months, 6 months, and 1 year after the surgery, there were no wound dehiscence, no bleeding, and no other potential major complications...|$|E
40|$|In {{this study}} we aim to boost the {{functional}} output of the intra-kidney islet transplantation for diabetic patients using a tissue engineered polymeric scaffold. This highly porous electrospun scaffold featured randomly distributed fibers composed of polycaprolactone (PCL) and <b>poliglecaprone</b> (PGC). It successfully sustained murine islets in vitro for up to 4 weeks without detected cytotoxicity. The in vivo study showed that the islet population proliferated by 89 % within 12 weeks when they were delivered by the scaffold but only 18 % if freely injected. Correspondingly, the islet population delivered by the scaffold unleashed a greater capability to produce insulin that in turn further drove down the blood glucose within 12 weeks after the surgery. Islets delivered by the scaffold most effectively prevented diabetic deterioration of kidney {{as evidenced by the}} lack of a kidney or glomerular enlargement and physiological levels of creatinine, urea nitrogen and albumin through week 12 after the surgery. Unlike traditional wisdom in diabetic research, the mechanistic study suggested that monocytes chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) was responsible for the improved preservation of renal functions. This study revealed a therapeutic role of MCP- 1 in rescuing kidneys in diabetic patients, which can be integrated into a tissue engineered scaffold to simultaneously preserved renal functions and islet transplantation efficacy. Also, thi...|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{analyze the}} {{performance}} of two surgical meshes of different compositions during the defect healing process of the abdominal wall of rats. Methods: thirty-three adult Wistar rats were anesthetized and subjected to removal of an area of 1. 5 cm x 2 cm of the anterior abdominal wall, except for the skin; 17 animals had the defect corrected by edge-to-edge surgical suture of a mesh made of polypropylene + <b>poliglecaprone</b> (Group U - UltraproTM); 16 animals had the defect corrected with a surgical mesh made of polypropylene + polidioxanone + cellulose (Group P - ProceedTM). Each group was divided into two subgroups, according to the euthanasia moment (seven days or 28 days after the operation). Parameters analyzed were macroscopic (adherence), microscopic (quantification of mature and immature collagen) and tensiometric (maximum tension and maximum rupture strength). Results : {{there was an increase}} in collagen type I in the ProceedTM group from seven to 28 days, p = 0. 047. Also, there was an increase in the rupture tension on both groups when comparing the two periods. There was a lower rupture tension and tissue deformity with ProceedTM mesh in seven days, becoming equal at day 28. Conclusion : the meshes retain similarities in the final result and more studies with larger numbers of animals must be carried for better assessment...|$|E
30|$|A new tubular graft from {{biocompatible}} and biodegradable PCL and <b>poliglecaprone</b> (PGC) polymers was fabricated by an electrospinning technique (Patel et al. 2015). PCL is a semicrystalline polymer {{which provides}} a slow degradation time (~ 2  years); therefore, it can {{play a critical role}} in tissue engineering application when a scaffold requires a longer time to support the damage tissue and promote regeneration (Gunatillake and Adhikari 2003). PCL has great viscoelastic properties, which provide the key qualities for vascular tissue engineering application (Lee et al. 2003). De Valence et al. (2012) showed a great structural integrity for the graft made from PCL in rat abdominal aorta model. Unlike PGA, PLA, and poly-lactide-co-glycolic acid (PLGA), PCL does not undergo plastic deformation and failure when exposed to long cyclic strain; therefore, it can be an excellent and critical component in vascular graft application (Lu et al. 2008). PGC in the form of Monocryl® monofilament sutures displayed excellent tensile properties and 20 – 30  % reduction in strength after 2  weeks in vivo (Bezwada et al. 1995). Complete absorption of PGC in human body between 90 and 120  days with slight to minimal tissue reaction has been confirmed (Bezwada et al. 1995). Therefore, a blend of PCL and PGC can provide the required mechanical integrity, and faster PGC degradation can provide room for neo-tissue formation.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPurposePeritoneal tissue {{healing is}} {{characterized}} by the simultaneous repopulation of mesothelial cells and the formation of neoperitoneum. Despite the common use of mesh products for abdominal wall repair, there are few investigations of how these materials may impact the peritoneal healing process. Here, we utilized an animal model of abdominal trauma to specifically investigate the peritoneal healing process in conjunction with a composite (<b>poliglecaprone</b> 25 -coated polypropylene) mesh. MethodsAbdominal wall injury was simulated in New Zealand White rabbits and peritoneal tissue was covered with composite mesh and fixed with peripheral sutures. Animals were sacrificed at regular intervals (up to 28 days) for macroscopic and microscopic evaluation. ResultsMesothelial cells were consistently identified {{on the surface of the}} central areas of the implanted mesh as early as 3 – 5 days after implantation. From day 7 onward, the entire mesh surface was covered by neoperitoneum which matured over the remaining study intervals. Fibroblast ingrowth of the mesh was apparent by day 5 and increased over time, concurrent with fragmentation of the film on the composite mesh. ConclusionsThese results suggest that composite mesh products used for abdominal wall repair do not significantly delay mesothelial repopulation. Study results also support the hypothesis that mesothelial cells involved in healing are derived, at least in part in this model, from free-floating precursor cells located within the peritoneal cavity...|$|E
40|$|Objective To {{examine the}} utility of {{cyanoacrylate}} tissue adhesive (Dermabond, Ethicon, Somerville, NJ, USA; {{an effective means of}} epithelial skin closure) under a diaper (i. e. constantly exposed to bodily fluids) in 25 children (not toilet-trained) undergoing inguinal surgery. Patients and methods A retrospective review of charts between July 1998 and July 2000 was used to identify children who were not toilet-trained and who had undergone inguinal surgery (e. g. orchidopexy, hernia and hydrocele repair). In addition to the type of surgery, the method of closure was also assessed; in all cases reported the subcutaneous tissues were approximated with 4 / 0 polyglactin suture. From July 1998 to October 1999 all epithelial skin was closed with 5 / 0 <b>poliglecaprone,</b> benzoin, sterile strips and collodion; from October 1999 to July 2000 all skin was closed with cyanoacrylate tissue adhesive. Results The chart review identified 45 boys (mean age 15. 3 months, range 1 - 26) of whom 26 (57 %) had undergone either inguinal hernia or hydrocele repair, and 19 (42 %) who had undergone orchidopexy. These procedures resulted in a total of 52 incisions in the 45 children. Of the 52 incisions, 27 were closed with suture and 25 with cyanoacrylate adhesive. All patients were followed up at 2 weeks; there were no instances of infection or wound dehiscence in either group. The incisions were cosmetically identical at 3 months of follow-up. Conclusion Cyanoacrylate adhesive is a safe and effective method of skin closure that can be used under a diaper...|$|E
40|$|Introduction Partial {{nephrectomy}} is {{the standard}} of care for localized renal tumors. However, bleeding and warm ischemia time are still controversial when laparoscopic surgeries are carried out. Herein, we aim to compare the outcomes from laparoscopic partial nephrectomy with and {{without the use of}} biological glue with purified bovine albumin and glutaraldehyde (BioGlue&# 174;). Materials and Methods Twenty-four kidneys of 12 pigs were used in this study. A pre-determined lower pole segment was resected (3 cm x 1 cm) and one of two different hemostatic techniques was performed. In one kidney, hemostatic &# 8220;U suture&# 8221; (<b>poliglecaprone</b> 3. 0) was performed and in the contra-lateral kidney, only the biological glue was applied. Data recorded was comprised of warm ischemia time (seconds) and estimated blood loss (mL) for each procedure. In cases of bleeding after glue administration, a complementary suture was done. Results Mean warm ischemia time was 492. 9 &# 177; 113. 1 (351 - 665) seconds and 746 &# 177; 185. 3 (409 - 1125) seconds for biological glue and suture groups, respectively. There was a positive significant difference in terms of warm ischemia favoring the biological glue group over the suture group (p< 0. 001). Mean blood loss was 39. 4 (0 - 115) mL for the biological glue group and 39. 1 (5 - 120) mL for the suture group (p= 0. 62). Conclusion Biological glue is an important tool for laparoscopic partial nephrectomies. It is effective for hemostatic control in selected cases, and it can be used in combination with the traditional suture techniques...|$|E
40|$|Background: Posterior {{reconstruction}} (PR) of the rhabdosphincter {{has been}} previously described during retropubic radical prostatectomy, and shorter times to return of urinary continence were reported using this technical modification. This technique has also been applied during robot-assisted radical prostatectomy (RARP); however, contradictory results have been reported. Objective: We describe here a modified technique for PR of the rhabdosphincter during RARP and report its impact on early recovery of urinary continence and on cystographic leakage rates. Design, setting, and participants: We analyzed 803 consecutive patients who underwent RARP by a single surgeon over a 12 -mo period: 330 without performing PR and 473 with PR. Surgical procedure: The reconstruction was performed using two 6 -in 3 - 0 <b>Poliglecaprone</b> sutures tied together. The free edge of the remaining Denonvillier`s fascia was identified after prostatectomy and approximated to the posterior aspect of the rhabdosphincter and the posterior median raphe using one arm of the continuous suture. The second layer of the reconstruction was then performed with the other arm of the suture, approximating the posterior lip of the bladder neck and vesicoprostatic muscle to the posterior urethral edge. Measurements: Continence rates were assessed with a self-administrated, validated questionnaire (Expanded Prostate Cancer Index Composite) at 1, 4, 12, and 24 wk after catheter removal. Continence {{was defined as the}} use of ""no absorbent pads. "" Cystogram was performed in all patients on postoperative day 4 or 5 before catheter removal. Results and limitations: There {{was no significant difference between}} the groups with respect to patient age, body mass index, prostate-specific antigen levels, prostate weight, American Urological Association symptom score, estimated blood loss, operative time, number of nerve-sparing procedures, and days with catheter. In the PR group, the continence rates at 1, 4, 12, and 24 wk postoperatively were 22. 7 %, 42. 7 %, 91. 8 %, and 96. 3 %, respectively; in the non-PR group, the continence rates were 28. 7 %, 51. 6 %, 91. 1 %, and 97 %, respectively. The modified PR technique resulted in significantly higher continence rates at 1 and 4 wk after catheter removal (p = 0. 048 and 0. 016, respectively), although the continence rates at 12 and 24 wk were not significantly affected (p = 0. 908 and p = 0. 741, respectively). The median interval to recovery of continence was also statistically significantly shorter in the PR group (median: 4 wk; 95 % confidence interval [CI]: 3. 39 - 4. 61) when compared to the non-PR group (median: 6 wk; 95 % CI: 5. 18 - 6. 82; log-rank test, p = 0. 037). Finally, the incidence of cystographic leaks was lower in the PR group (0. 4 % vs 2. 1 %; p = 0. 036). Although the patients` baseline characteristics were similar between the groups, the patients were not preoperatively randomized and unknown confounding factors may have influenced the results. Conclusions: Our modified PR combines the benefits of early recovery of continence reported with the original PR technique with a reinforced watertight closure of the posterior anastomotic wall. Shorter interval to recovery of continence and lower incidence of cystographic leaks were demonstrated with our PR technique when compared to RARP with no reconstruction.
