500|$|The {{signing of}} the Paris Peace Accords in January 1973 did not end the {{fighting}} in South Vietnam since both sides violated the cease-fire and attempted {{to gain control of}} as much territory as possible. Occupation meant population control in any future negotiations or reunification effort. The fighting that erupted was not small in scale. The three-phase North Vietnamese [...] "Land-grabbing-and population nibbling" [...] campaign, for example, included four division-sized attacks to seize strategically advantageous positions. The International Commission of Control and Supervision (ICCS), established by a protocol of the Paris agreement, had been assigned the task of monitoring the implementation of the cease-fire. The <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> consultation and <b>unanimity</b> among the members, however, doomed any effort to control the situation or to stop cease-fire violations, and the ICCS ceased to function in any meaningful way within a few months of its establishment.|$|R

40|$|Looking {{back from}} the {{perspective}} of the over 40 -year history of European integration, the achievement of common social policy is visible first of all in these fields which supported economic integration and the rising of a uniform market. Until today the question remains open what should be the policy of the Union in face of the large differentiation of social rights and institutional solutions in the systems of social security of the member countries. In this scope there is a dissonance between the general declarations of the Union and practice resulting from the obligatory <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>unanimity</b> in accepting resolutions concerning the questions of social security and the principle of subsidiarity in relations between the Union and member countries. For this reason, among others, the European Social Agenda, adopted in Nice in the year 2000, has essential importance. In accordance with its provisions the priority of the social policy of the Union in the first decade of the XXI century will be co-operation in the solving of common problems (unemployment, poverty and social exclusion, safety of pension systems) and modernisation of the European social model. The accepted goals and an open method of co-ordination as a method of their realisation manifests the greater determination of the Union in the scope of strengthening its social dimension and adaptation of the European social model to contemporary challenges. ...|$|E

40|$|We are {{experiencing}} {{the equivalent of}} a geopolitical earthquake. The disintegration of the Soviet bloc permitted American unilateralism on a scale the modern world has never seen. But with its war against Iraq the United States for the first time openly massed its military power and then invaded another nation, justifying the war {{in the name of the}} elimination of weapons of mass destruction and ‘regime change. ’ At the same time, it staked the very future of its existing alliances – NATO above all – but also the United Nations. NATO’s demise is a major outcome of the war against Iraq. Washington wished to recast its European alliance, especially after its war against Serbia in the spring of 1999 revealed that the NATO <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>unanimity</b> among its 19 members was a major inhibition on its freedom of action, but today its European coalition is disintegrating prematurely for reasons it both failed to anticipate and deplores. America’s unilateralism and bellicosity has compelled some of the most important European nations to assert their independence well before they were ready or likely to do so. Washington intended that NATO, from its very inception, serve as its instrument for maintaining its political hegemony over Western Europe, forestalling the emergence of a bloc that could play an independent role in world affairs. Charles de Gaulle, Winston Churchill, and many influential politicians envisioned such an alliance less as a means of confronting the Soviet army than as a way of containing a resurgent Germany as well as balancing American power. Publicly, the reason for creating NATO in 1949 was the alleged Soviet military menace, but the United States always planned to employ strategic nuclear weapons to defeat the USSR – for which it did not need an alliance. But Washington believed that war with Russia was not imminent or even likely, a view that Iraq, th...|$|E

40|$|Issues of {{constitutional}} design are {{fundamental to the}} study of international organisations, and the North-South debate has given such issues increased prominence and interest; witness the recent debates on the structure of the International Fund for Agricultural Development. Our understanding of how nations design covenants and charters is limited, however. The economics literature offers us insights into how to conduct more rigorous analyses of the constitutional questions facing diplomats and legal specialists. The paper illustrates the usefulness of incorporating that literature in the study of one of the classic constitutional issues, namely, the desirability <b>of</b> <b>unanimity</b> rule. Buchanan and Tullock’s Generalised Economic Theory of Constitutions is used to refine some well-known analyses <b>of</b> <b>unanimity.</b> A rational construction for the choice <b>of</b> <b>unanimity</b> rule is developed, and the false dichotomy between majoritarianism and unanimity is illuminated. In turn, more complete explanations for the policy choices of particular governments are constructed and important insights into the UNCTAD voting impasse are gained.

40|$|The Treaty on Stability, Coordination and Governance in the Economic and Monetary Union (TSCG) {{removes the}} {{unanimity}} requirement {{for entry into}} force. This innovation is possible because, technically, the TSCG I not an EU Treaty. It is not constructed as a reform of the EU Treaties following Article 48 which prescribes unanimity. So far, EU treaty revision is firmly locked in the unanimity requirement creating a Catch- 22 situation: unanimity can only be removed unanimously. This, together with an adherence to a ‘strict construction’ {{in the interpretation of}} EU law and the relative absence of instances of ratification failures may explain the permanence of the requirement. As the basic rule of constitution-making, several criticisms can be launched against unanimity. This paper discusses the rule <b>of</b> <b>unanimity</b> in three parts: it presents, firstly, the origins and maintenance of the rule through the EU’s successive treaty reforms, as well as the theoretical alternatives proposed. The second part of the paper raises various arguments against unanimity: the factual outcome of the practice <b>of</b> <b>unanimity,</b> its effect on the model of constitutional rules of the Union, the issue of consent and the possibility of externalising the effects <b>of</b> <b>unanimity.</b> The third part presents and discusses the provisions in the existing draft on a reinforced economic union.
