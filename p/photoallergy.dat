40|$|The {{interest}} in developing new sunscreens is increasing due to {{the harmful effects of}} UV radiation on the skin, such as erythema, accelerated skin ageing (photoageing) and the induction of skin cancer. However, many molecular sunscreens penetrate into the skin causing <b>photoallergies,</b> phototoxic reactions and skin irritation. Thus, the aim of this work was the preparation and characterization of polymeric and solid lipid nanoparticles to act carriers of benzophenone- 3 (BZ 3), aiming to improve the safety of sunscreen products by increasing the sun protection factor (SPF), decreasing BZ 3 skin penetration and decreasing BZ 3 concentration in sunscreen formulation. BZ 3 was encapsulated in poly(epsilon-caprolactone) (PCL) nanoparticles by the nanoprecipitation method and in solid lipid nanoparticles (SLN) by the hot high pressure homogenization method. the particles were stable for 40 days. the BZ 3 encapsulated in PCL nanoparticles was released faster than BZ 3 encapsulated in SLN. the sun protection factor increased when BZ 3 was encapsulated in both nanostructures. However, BZ 3 encapsulated in PCL nanoparticles decreased its skin permeation more than SLN-BZ 3. Furthermore, BZ 3 encapsulated in SLN did not exhibit cytotoxic or phototoxic effects in human keratinocytes (HaCaT cells) and BABL/c 3 T 3 fibroblasts, whereas PCL nanoparticles with BZ 3 showed phototoxic potential in HaCaT cells. Nevertheless, BZ 3 free and encapsulated in PCL nanoparticles or in SLN did not show allergic reactions in mice. Our results suggest that these nanostructures are interesting carriers for sunscreen.

40|$|Quinolone {{antibacterial}} {{agents are}} well known to cause <b>photoallergy</b> as a side-effect. Murine <b>photoallergy</b> to fluoroquinolones is a T cell-mediated immune response, evoked either by systemic fluoroquinolone and subsequent exposure of skin to ultraviolet A light or by subcutaneous injection of fluoroquinolone-photomodified epidermal cells. In this photosensitivity, epidermal Langerhans cells may be photomodified initially with the drug and thus present photohaptenic moieties to sensitize and restimulate T cells. Although we have shown that Langerhans cells photocoupled in vitro with fluoroquinolones are capable of stimulating sensitized T cells, it remains unclear whether systemically given fluoroquinolone photomodifies Langerhans cells upon ultraviolet A irradiation of the skin and the Langerhans cells become photohapten-bearing, T cell-stimulatory cells. In a murine model of fleroxacin <b>photoallergy</b> induced by intraperitoneal injection of the drugs plus ultraviolet A irradiation of skin, we found that Langerhans cells as well as keratinocytes are photoderivatized with fleroxacin as demonstrated with a fluoroquinolone-specific monoclonal antibody. Langerhans-cell-enriched epidermal cells prepared from mice treated with fleroxacin and ultraviolet A induced proliferation of sensitized T cells, indicating that photomodified Langerhans cells are functional. There was an optimal range of ultraviolet A dose to quantitatively and qualitatively form fleroxacin-photomodified Langerhans cells, as excess ultraviolet A rather reduced the photoantigen-presenting capacity of Langerhans cells presumably because of drug phototoxicity. Our study suggests that Langerhans cells serve as photoantigen-presenting cells in drug <b>photoallergy...</b>|$|E

40|$|Fluoroquinolone {{antibacterial}} agents cause {{photosensitivity dermatitis}} as an adverse effect and can function immunologically as photohapten. In a murine model of quinolone <b>photoallergy,</b> Langerhans cells are photomodified with a systemically given quinolone upon ultraviolet A irradiation {{of skin and}} thus present photohaptenic moieties to sensitize and restimulate T cells. The {{aim of this study}} is to determine the site of peptides/proteins photobound to quinolones and to assess the T cell antigenicity of quinolone-photocoupled peptides using Langerhans cells as photoadduct-presenting cells. On an amino acid composition analysis, lysine was preferentially degraded in bovine serum albumin that was ultraviolet A-conjugated with a representative quinolone ofloxacin. An affinity chromatographic study using a quinolone photoadduct-specific monoclonal antibody as ligand demonstrated preferential photocoupling of ofloxacin with a lysine-containing peptide. CD 4 + T cells were purified from lymph nodes of BALB/c mice sensitized subcutaneously with ofloxacin-photomodified epidermal cells and from those sensitized epicutaneously via barrier-disrupted skin with a major histocompatibility complex class II (I-Ad) -binding, ofloxacin-photoconjugated peptide. These immune T cells proliferated in vitro in response to Langerhans cells loaded with class II-binding, lysine-containing peptides when photomodified with ofloxacin. Furthermore, epicutaneous application of the ofloxacin-photoconjugated peptide was able to prime mice for subsequent elicitation of <b>photoallergy</b> evoked with systemic ofloxacin and ultraviolet A light.

40|$|Too many {{patients}} with <b>photoallergy</b> remain undiagnoseddue to unsatisfactory knowledge among doctors and limited access tophotopatch testing. The objectives {{of this study}} were to analyze thefrequency of patients requiring diagnostic work-up for photoallergiccontact dermatitis among dermatology patients, and to identify thecausative photosensitizers. This prospective study involved 1000 consecutive,first-referred dermatology outpatients. All patients with ahistory of dermatitis induced or aggravated by exposure to light werequalified for photopatch testing. In the study group, 36 (3. 6 %; 95 %CI: 2. 4 - 4. 8 %) persons required photopatch testing based on their clinicalsymptoms. As the total number of patients requiring patch tests ofany kind amounted to 205, the percentage of photopatch tested patientsamong all patch-tested patients was 17. 5 % (95 %CI: 12. 2 - 22. 8 %). Photoallergic contact dermatitis was ultimately confirmed in 15 (1. 5 %; 0. 7 - 2. 3 %) persons: 7 females and 8 males aged 6 - 60 (median 33) years. Nine patients turned out photoallergic to at least one nonsteroidal antiinflammatorydrug, with ketoprofen <b>photoallergy</b> being most frequent(5 patients, in each case clinically relevant), followed by etofenamate(4 non-relevant reactions) and diclofenac (1 relevant reaction). Five patientswere positive to at least one organic sunscreen, most frequentlyto benzophenone- 3 (2 patients). “Classical” contact allergy to testedphotohaptens was found in 15 persons, including 7 with coexistingphotoallergy. In conclusion, patients requiring diagnostic work-up forphotoallergy constitute a relevant group among dermatology patients,therefore, it seems advisable that all second-level dermatology referralcenters be capable of photopatch testing.

One set of patches was irradiated using a source of long ultravoilet whereas all ultraviolet radiation was regorously excluded from the second set. In one patient the results were consistent with a plain contact allergy to the photoproducts DBS and MBS. In a second patient irradiation of any of the three brominated salicylanilides resulted in a reaction whereas no reactions were observed in the dark.

40|$|We have induced <b>photoallergy</b> in mice to systemically {{administered}} drugs, specifically sulfanilamide and chlorpromazine. Mice were photosensitized to systemic sulfanilamide or chlorpromazine by i. p. {{administration of}} drug followed by UVB and UVA irradiation of shaved flank skin, on two consecutive days. Control mice received i. p. drug with no irradiation. In some experiments cyclophosphamide pretreatment, or intradermal Corynebacterium parvum (Propionibacterium acnes), was administered as an immunoadjuvant. All animals were photochallenged on day 5 with i. p. drug followed by UVA irradiation of one ear. Mice {{that had been}} previously immunized with drug and UV radiation developed ear swelling and erythema, evident 24 h after photochallenge, but not at 4 h. Control animals showed no reactions. In a typical experiment of photosensitization to systemic sulfanilamide, the experimental group had a mean increase in ear thickness of 6. 0 × 10 - 2 mm 24 h after photochallenge, while unsensitized control animals showed a mean change of - 0. 8 × 10 - 2 mm. The histopathology of the positive challenge reaction was characteristic of a delayed type hypersensitivity. Adoptive transfer of <b>photoallergy</b> to systemic sulfanilamide to naive recipients was accomplished by i. v. injection of lymph node cells (5 × 107) harvested from actively photosensitized donors. Clinical reports have suggested that exposure to systemic medications followed by sunlight can induce an eruption having a photoallergic basis. We now report the first experimental proof of that hypothesis.

40|$|Regulatory requirements: According to {{the current}} Notes for Guidance of the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products (SCCNFP), {{cosmetic}} ingredients and mixtures of ingredients absorbing UV light (in particular UV filter chemicals used, for example, to ensure the light stability of cosmetics or used in sun protection products) should be tested for acute phototoxic and photogenotoxic potential. Testing for photosensitisation (immunological <b>photoallergy)</b> potential is not specifically required, but it is nevertheless often performed. Acute phototoxicity: Due to a thorough multi-stage and multi-centre validation trial (1992 - 1998) the In Vitro 3 T 3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Test (3 T 3 -NRU-PT) had already gained acceptance by the SCCNFP in 1998, and it is recommended by the EMEA/CPMP as a basic preclinical test for acute phototoxicity. It was accepted as Method No. 41 in Annex V to Directive 67 / 548 /EEC in the year 2000, and was accepted as the new Test Guideline 432 by the OECD in 2002. The 3 T 3 -NRU-PT {{is regarded as a}} basic screen for identifying acute phototoxic potential. Two additional in vitro tests, formally evaluated in controlled blind trials, the RBC Phototoxicity Test (RBC-PT) and the Human 3 -D Skin Model Phototoxicity Test (H 3 D-PT), are regarded as useful and important adjunct tests to overcome some limitations of the 3 T 3 -NRU-PT, namely the fairly low UVB tolerance of the 3 T 3 fibroblasts and the inability to model the bioavailability of test materials topically applied to the skin. In addition, the RBC-PT permits an evaluation of the phototoxic mechanisms involved. In conclusion, the identification of acute phototoxic hazards is now regarded as being sufficiently covered by in vitro tests, so that animal testing for that endpoint can now be 100 % replaced. Photogenotoxicity: In the area of photogenotoxicity, almost the whole battery of in vitro genetic toxicity tests have been (or are currently being) converted into test protocols of photogenotoxicity tests. Tests exclusively predictive for gene mutation, for example, the Photo-Ames (P-Ames) Test and the Photo-Thymidine Kinase Test (P-TKT), have become less important than tests for clastogenic effects (for example, the Photo-Chromosome Aberration Test [P-CAT] and the Photo-Micronucleus Test [P-MNT]). In addition, a number of promising indicator tests, such as the Photo-Comet Assay (P-Comet) have been developed. Although routinely used, to date none of the new photogenotoxicity tests have been formally validated. Therefore, the P-MNT and the P-Comet are currently being evaluated in a formal interlaboratory validation study. It is expected that these in vitro photogenotoxicity test methods may become available as validated and accepted methods within the next five years. <b>Photoallergy</b> (Photosensitisation) : In the area of <b>photoallergy</b> (photosensitisation), as development of predictive in vitro tests for delayed contact sensitisation (allergenicity) potential without the involvement of light, {{due to a lack of}} ability to model the complex mechanisms underlying allergy, no promising in vitro methods to predict photo-sensitisation potential are currently in sight (see the section on skin sensitisation). One in vitro screening method, which models the covalent binding of a light activated chemical to human serum albumin, may become relevant. However, while the binding of an excited chemical to proteins is a prerequisite for <b>photoallergy,</b> this is not a sufficient predictor on its own. The only promising alternatives currently under development are in vivo refinements, like the Photo Local Lymph Node Assay (PLLNA). Once a reliable and predictive in vitro test battery and strategy for the assessment of "dark" sensitisation potential have been developed and accepted, their adaptation into similar photosensitisation testing will become possible...|$|E

40|$|Background: The {{panel of}} patch test allergens {{used for the}} {{evaluation}} of patients with suspected <b>photoallergy</b> typically does not include plant and pesticide allergens. The prevalence of allergic contact dermatitis and pho-toallergic contact dermatitis to plant and pesticide aller-gens was determined for this subgroup of patients. Observation: Positive reactions were detected in 12 of 26 patients who were tested with our photoallergen se-ries: 5 with allergic contact dermatitis, 5 with photoal-lergic contact dermatitis, and 2 with both. Four of the 12 patients had positive patch and photo-patch test re-actions to plant allergens, pesticide allergens, or both. The positive patch test reactions were to the plants Taraxa-cum officinale (dandelion) and Tanacetum vulgare (tansy) and to the pesticides folpet and captafol. Positive photo-patch test reactions were to the pesticides folpet and cap-tan. The histories of the patients suggested that 2 or 3 of the 4 patients had clinically relevant reactions. In the other 8 patients, positive reactions to the patch and photo-patch tests included fragrances, sunscreens, and antibac-terial agents. Conclusion: Plant and pesticide allergens should be in-cluded in the patch and photo-patch test series used {{for the evaluation of}} patients with suspected <b>photoallergy.</b> Arch Dermatol. 1999; 135 : 67 - 70 T HE DERMATOLOGIC manifes-tations of the photosensi-tivity disorders, includingphotoallergic contact der-matitis (PACD), occur on exposed areas of the body.

40|$|Background: Photodermatitis is an {{abnormal}} response to ultraviolet radiation (UVR). The photoallergic contact dermatitis caused by plant allergens {{is a serious}} cause of morbidity in India. Airborne contact dermatitis is the classical presentation of plant-induced dermatosis, which may become difficult to differentiate from chronic actinic dermatitis in chronic cases. The rapid growth of parthenium weed in India and its ill effects on the population make it important to detect all cases of parthenium sensitivity, which in some cases might simulate photodermatitis. Aims: This study aims to detect the occurrence of plant sensitivity and photosensitivity in idiopathic-acquired photodermatoses, airborne contact dermatitis and general population taken as controls. Methods: One hundred and fifty six consecutive patients suffering from polymorphic light eruption (PMLE), chronic actinic dermatitis (CAD) and airborne contact dermatitis (ABCD) {{were enrolled in the}} study over a period of three years (June 2004 to May 2007). An equal number of age and sex matched healthy subjects were enrolled in the study as controls. All the patients were subjected to detailed history taking, clinical examination and histopathological examination for diagnosis. Patch and photopatch testing were perfomed in all the patients and healthy controls for detection of allergic and photoallergic reactions to parthenium, xanthium and chrysanthemum plant antigens and control antigens. Results: Out of 156 patients enrolled in the study, 78 (50 &#x 0025;) had CAD, 67 (42. 9 &#x 0025;) had PMLE and 11 (7. 05 &#x 0025;) had ABCD. The occurrence of parthenium/xanthium allergy and <b>photoallergy,</b> either to parthenium or both was most commonly found in ABCD (72. 7 &#x 0025;), followed by CAD (32 &#x 0025;). In PMLE 4. 5 &#x 0025; cases showed <b>photoallergy.</b> Only 1. 9 &#x 0025; in the control group showed sensitivity to parthenium and xanthium. Conclusion: This study indicates that parthenium (and possibly xanthium) may act as important environmental factors in the initiation and perpetuation of not only ABCD but of CAD as well. Photoexacerbation to UVA at positive parthenium/xanthium sensitivity sites in ABCD and CAD indicates that ABCD with photosensitivity to compositae can lead to CAD...|$|E

40|$|Fluphenazine is a {{neuroleptic}} drug {{used for}} the long-term treatment of mental disorders, in particular in the therapy of various psychoses, including schizophrenia and mania. Occurrence of skin phototoxic and photoallergic reactions is observed when patients expose themselves to sunlight during treatment. In order to identify the mechanism of fluphenazine phototoxicity, the drug was irradiated with UVA in different solvents and in presence of nucleophilic substrates of biological relevance, like serine, lysine and a serine-containing oligopeptide. The photoproducts were characterized by mass spectroscopy and, for three of them, by NMR spectroscopy. A minor product in which N-oxidation occurred was found in all conditions. The major product which formed in water was a carboxylic acid derived from the hydrolytic defluorination of the CF 3 group. In methanol and ethanol the main product was the ester of the carboxylic acid. Serine also bound fluphenazine through the same mechanism. Although with low yield, a similar product was identified in a 14 -peptide irardiated in presence of the drug. Lysine did not react in the same conditions. These results suggest that photobinding of fluphenazine to serine residues of proteins may occur in vivo, thus initiating the processes leading to <b>photoallergy...</b>|$|E

As current end product use levels are between 0. 001 % and 1. 7 %, eye irritation is not a concern. The materials have no or low sensitizing potential. For individuals who are already sensitized, an elicitation reaction is possible. Due to lack of UVA/UVB light-absorbing structures, and review of phototoxic/photoallergy data, the BCSA {{are not expected to}} elicit phototoxicity or <b>photoallergy.</b> The 15 materials tested have a low order of acute toxicity. Following repeated application, seven BCSA tested were of low systemic toxicity. Studies performed on eight BCSA and three metabolites show no in vivo or in vitro genotoxicity. A valid carcinogenicity study showed that 2 -ethyl- 1 -hexanol is a weak inducer of liver tumors in female mice, however, the relevance of this effect and mode of action to humans is still a matter of debate.

40|$|The {{photodegradation}} of the {{chemotherapeutic agent}} 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) under UVB light was studied both in aqueous and methanol solutions and in systemic and topical formulations. As monitored by HPLC, photodegradation in solution {{takes place in}} a concentration dependent manner; thus, the solution for parenteral administration (10 (- 1) M) showed negligible loss of the active principle. On the contrary, the commercial cream containing 5 % of 5 -FU showed low stability under UVB exposure. When dissolved either in water or methanol, 5 -FU yields two photoproducts which have been characterized as two isomers coming from the addition of the solvent to the 5, 6 double bond of the drug. As a consequence, photomodified 5 -FU loses its antiproliferative activity on HCT- 15 and HeLa cells. MS analysis showed that photoaddition occurred with nucleophilic amino acids, such as cysteine and serine, while susceptible amino acids (cysteine and methionine) were oxidized. In fact, high production of the superoxide anion under UVB light as well as photooxidation of BSA suggests protein photodamage as a mechanism of photosensitization. Indeed, some phototoxicity was shown in experiments on NCTC keratinocytes and MCF- 7 resistant cells irradiated with UVB light. The interactions with these biological targets may contribute to skin phototoxicity and <b>photoallergy</b> induced by 5 -FU in vivo...|$|E

The basis of experimental photobiology was laid by the studies of Raab and Tappeiner on photodynamic action and the early uses of phototherapy by Finsen and Dorno. The discovery of the association of porphyrins with some light-related skin diseases and of the capability of chemical agents such as coal tar and bergamot to induce phototoxic contact dermatitis resulted in a flurry of clinical investigations leading to better understanding of the processes of phototoxicity and <b>photoallergy.</b> The early epidemiologic studies of Unna and Dubreuilh relating solar radiation exposure to the formation of actinic keratoses and non-melanoma skin cancer were experimentally confirmed in animals by Findlay, Roffo, and Blum. In the most recent quarter century (1950 – 1975), cellular and molecular photobiology has been refined. The studies on photochemistry of nucleic acid and of damage and repair mechanisms in DNA have set the stage for understanding the basic processes of biologic effects of light and promise the development of useful applications of specifically directed phototherapy and prevention of such light-induced diseases as skin cancer...|$|E
40|$|Photobinding {{of drugs}} to biomolecules {{constitutes}} an important early {{event in the}} onset of <b>photoallergy.</b> In the present work, UV irradiation of human serum albumin {{in the presence of}} either suprofen (SUP) or its major photoproduct, decarboxylated suprofen (DSUP), has been studied as a model system for drug-photosensitised protein binding. Both dark binding and binding in the presence of light were investigated since this will affect the mode, site and mechanism of drug interaction with the protein. In order to determine the binding features of SUP to albumin, competitive binding experiments were carried out using fluorescent probes specific for site I and II. Suprofen was found to selectively dark bind to site II on HSA. Photobinding of DSUP to HSA was more efficient than SUP. Parallel to this, the intrinsic tryptophan fluorescence of HSA decreased when the protein was previously irradiated {{in the presence of the}} photoactive compounds, again being DSUP more efficient compared with SUP. As fluorescence quenching involves electron transfer from the excited Trp to the ground state DSUP, it follows that the photoactive compound binding to HSA must be on (or in close proximity to) site I Trp(214) residue. It appears that photobinding of SUP is largely preceded by its photodecomposition to DSUP which, in turn, associates and photobinds to HSA. (C) 2001 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

Between May 2001 and June 2002, the Belgian Contact & Environmental Dermatitis Group conducted a prospective, open patch and photopatch test study in 20 patients suspected of KP dermatitis. Severe skin symptoms requiring systemic corticotherapy occurred in 47 %. 5 patients were hospitalized. 1 patient showed prolonged photosensitivity. All patients were tested with KP and the other constituents of KP gel. Attribution to KP was demonstrated in all cases. Patch and photopatch tests with KP 2 % in petrolatum showed contact <b>photoallergy</b> in 17 patients, contact allergy in 1 patient and photoaggravated contact allergy in 2 patients. 5 patients also reacted to the fragrance components lavender (Lavandula augustifolia) oil and/or neroli (Citrus aurantium dulcis) oil 5 % in alcohol. However, in 4 of these, irritant reactions to the ethanolic dilutions could not be ruled out.

40|$|Photoactivation and binding of photoactive {{chemicals}} to proteins is a known prerequisite {{for the formation}} of immunogenic photoantigens and the induction of <b>photoallergy.</b> The intensive use of products and the availability of new chemicals, along with an increasing exposure to sun light contribute to the risk of photosensitizing adverse reactions. Dendritic cells (DC) play a pivotal role in the induction of allergic contact dermatitis. Human peripheral blood monocyte derived dendritic cells (PBMDC) were thus perceived as an obvious choice {{for the development of a}} novel in vitro photosensitization assay using the modulation of cell surface protein expression in response to photosensitizing agents. In this new protocol, known chemicals with photosensitizing, allergenic or non-allergenic potential were pre-incubated with PBMDCs prior to UVA irradiation (1 J/cm 2). Following a 48 h incubation, the expression of the cell surface molecules CD 86, HLA-DR and CD 83 was measured by flow cytometry. All tested photosensitizers induced a significant and dose-dependent increase of CD 86 expression after irradiation compared to non-irradiated controls. Moreover, the phototoxicity of the chemicals could also be determined. In contrast, (i) CD 86 expression was not affected by the chosen irradiation conditions, (ii) increased CD 86 expression induced by allergens was independent of irradiation and (iii) no PBMDC activation was observed with the non-allergenic control. The assay proposed here for the evaluation of the photoallergenic potential of chemicals includes the assessment of their allergenic, phototoxic and toxic potential in a single and robust test system an...|$|E
40|$|Photosensitivity is an {{uncommon}} but characteristic {{side effect of}} quinolones, with a variable incidence for the different drugs. Several cases, considered either phototoxic or photoallergic, have been described with lomefloxacin use. During the last 4 years we studied 8 patients (mean age 69. 4 years) with eczematous or acute sunburn-like lesions in photo-exposed areas, after taking lomefloxacin {{for a period of}} one week to several months. After drug withdrawal and systemic and/or topical corticosteroids, lesions cleared within one week to two months, with dischromia in one patient. Six to eight weeks thereafter, a photobiological study was performed. Minimal erythema dose (MED) for UVA and UVB were normal and photopatch tests with lomefloxacin, ofloxacin, ciproflaxacin and norfloxacin, tested at 1 %, 5 % and 10 % in petrolatum and irradiated with 5 and 10 J/cm 2 UVA were negative in 7 patients and 20 controls. Patient 1 had a positive photopatch test with lomefloxacin. One patient, who inadvertently reintroduced the drug before photopatch testing, developed a sharply limited erythematous reaction at 48 h in all irradiated areas, without aggravation at the sites of the quinolones patches. Our patients illustrate the polymorphism of clinical photosensitivity to lomefloxacin and represent the largest series in which photobiological studies have been performed. As in previous reports there are arguments favouring <b>photoallergy,</b> but phototoxicity appears to be the main mechanism of photosensitivity to quinolones, particularly in older patients with concomitant diseases and long-term use of the drug...|$|E
40|$|Photosensitized protein {{oxidation}} by drugs, {{with the}} consequent modification of their structure {{is thought to}} be responsible for the occurrence of phototoxic phenomena such as <b>photoallergy</b> and loss of biological functions. In this paper we have investigated in detail the interaction of four fluoroquinolones namely ciprofloxacin, lomefloxacin, norfloxacin and ofloxacin with two proteins such as Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) and Ribonuclease A (RNAse A) chosen as models. The interactions between the four drugs and the proteins, were studied by absorption and emission spectroscopy. Photophysical experiments were carried out in aqueous solutions by stationary and time-resolved fluorimetry and by laser flash photolysis, in the absence and {{in the presence of the}} proteins to obtain information on the various decay pathways of the excited states of the drugs and on transient species formed upon irradiation. In parallel we have investigated by a series of biochemical assays the photoinduced modifications exerted by the four drugs. The obtained results showed that the four drugs are able to photooxidize proteins with the formation of protein-protein cross-link. This effect was also confirmed in isolated erythrocyte membranes. Furthermore the effect of the fluoroquinolones was also evaluated on isolated aromatic aminoacids. In this context the four drugs are able to photodamage in particular tyrosine and histidine. These results are important in the light of the growing interest for the comprehension of the mechanism of phototoxicity induced by these antibacterial drugs...|$|E
40|$|Background: The photopatch test is used {{to detect}} photoallergic {{reactions}} to various antigens such as sunscreens and drugs. Photosensitive dermatitis can be caused due to antigens like parthenium, fragrances, rubbers and metals. The photopatch test does not contain these antigens. Therefore, the Indian Standard Series (ISS) along with the Standard photopatch series from Chemotechnique Diagnostics, Sweden was used to detect light induced antigens. Aim: To detect light induced antigens in patients with photosensitive dermatitis. Methods: This study was done in a descriptive, observer blinded manner. Photopatch test and ISS were applied in duplicate on the patient's back by the standard method. After 24 hours, readings were recorded according to ICDRG criteria. One side was closed and other side irradiated with 14 J/cm 2 of UVA and {{a second set of}} readings were recorded after 48 hrs. Result: The highest positivity was obtained with parthenium, with 18 out of 35 (51 %) patients showing a positive patch test reaction with both photoallergic contact dermatitis and photoaggravation. Four patients (11 %) showed positive patch test reaction suggestive of contact dermatitis to potassium dichromate and fragrance mix. Six patients had contact dermatitis to numerous antigens such as nickel, cobalt, chinoform and para-phenylenediamine. None of these patients showed photoaggravation on patch testing. Conclusion: Parthenium was found to cause <b>photoallergy,</b> contact dermatitis with photoaggravation and contact allergy. Hence, photopatch test and UV irradiated patch test can be an important tool to detect light induced antigens in patients with photosensitive dermatitis...|$|E
40|$|Fluoroquinolone {{antibacterial}} {{agents are}} well known to elicit photosensitivity as an adverse effect, and their cross-reactivity has been clinically documented. The photoallergenicity of fluoroquinolones is mainly derived from their photohaptenic moiety, and photomodification of skin epidermal cells with fluoroquinolones {{is thought to be}} an initial step for this <b>photoallergy.</b> Here we have explored, both in vivo and in vitro, T cell responses to fluoroquinolone-photomodified cells, focusing on their photoantigenic cross-reactivity. Cells were derivatized with fluoroquinolones under exposure to UV-A, and fluoroquinolone photoadducts were detected in photomodified cells by immunostaining, flow cytometry, and cell ELISA using fluoroquinolone-specific mAb. T cellmediated hypersensitivity induced and elicited by s. c. injection of fluoroquinolone-photomodified epidermal cells was cross-reactive among six fluoroquinolones. In addition, lymph node cells from mice sensitized with fluoroquinolone-photomodified cells proliferated well in vitro not only to Langerhans cell-enriched epidermal cells photoderivatized with corresponding fluoroquinolone, but also to those photomodified with any of five other fluoroquinolones, supporting their cross-reactivity. In three fluoroquinolones tested, Th 1 populations that expanded after in vitro photoantigenic stimulation of immune lymph node cells expressed the same V� 13 of TCR. The sensitivity could be transferred by the i. v. administration of this V� 13 � T cell line into naive recipients, in which a high percentage of V� 13 � cells infiltrated at the challenge site. These findings suggest that these fluoroquinolones carry the same photoantigenic epitope, which is recognized by V� 13 � T cells, leading to fluoroquinolone photosensitivity and cross-reactivity.

40|$|The {{chemotherapeutic}} agent 5 -fluorouracil (5 -FU) is a pyrimidine analogue {{used as an}} antineoplastic drug both systemically and topically {{for a variety of}} cancerous and precancerous diseases. Among its side effects, phototoxic and photoallergic reactions are reported in treated patients inadvertently exposed to sunlight and higher efficacy against actinic keratosis was found when affected areas are exposed to irradiation. 5 -FU and its deoxyribonucleoside monophosphate are known to undergo photodegradation under UVC and UVB light. Therefore the drug itself and its formulations are suggested to be protected from light. Phototoxicity was studied in vitro on NCTC- 2544 and 3 T 3 cell lines. The photoallergic potential was evaluated through photosensitization reactions to model amino acids and proteins. Experiments in cancerous 5 -FU resistant MCF- 7 cell lines were performed in order to assess the antiproliferative effect of 5 -FU in combination with UVB light. The photostability of 5 -FU parenteral and topical formulations and the consequences of photolysis on therapeutic activity have been also evaluated. We have demonstrated that photolysis of 5 -FU caused loss of its antiproliferative activity in HCT- 15 and HeLa tumor cell lines sensitive to 5 -FU. Moreover, a slight in vitro phototoxicity of 5 -FU was detected on NCTC- 2544 and 3 T 3 cell lines. The nucleophilic addition of amino acids and peptides (i. e. serine, cysteine, angiotensin fragment) to the 5, 6 double bond of 5 -FU (detected by Mass Spectrometry) as well as photooxidation of proteins (BSA carbonyl content assay) were shown, possibly explaining the occurrence of <b>photoallergy</b> and other undesired light–induced side effects of this drug. A little improvement of the antiproliferative activity of 5 -FU in combination with UVB irradiation on MCF- 7 resistant cells was also evidenced, but not enough effective to justify its use as a phototherapeutic agent...|$|E
40|$|Triflusal is a {{platelet}} aggregation inhibitor chemically related to acetylsalicylic acid, {{which is used}} for the prevention and/or treatment of vascular thromboembolisms, which acts as a prodrug. Actually, after oral administration it is absorbed primarily in the small intestine, binds to plasma proteins (99 %) and is rapidly biotransformed in the liver into its deacetylated active metabolite 2 -hydroxy- 4 -trifluoromethylbenzoic acid (HTB). In healthy humans, the half-life of triflusal is ca. 0. 5 h, whereas for HTB it is ca. 35 h. From a pharmacological point of view, {{it is interesting to note}} that HTB is itself highly active as a platelet anti-aggregant agent. Indeed, studies on the clinical profile of both drug and metabolite have shown no significant differences between them. It has been evidenced that HTB displays ability to induce <b>photoallergy</b> in humans. This phenomenon involves a cell-mediated immune response, which is initiated by covalent binding of a light-activated photosensitizer (or a species derived therefrom) to a protein. In this context, small proteins like ubiquitin could be appropriate models for investigating covalent binding by means of MS/MS and peptide fingerprint analysis. In previous work, it was shown that HTB forms covalent photoadducts with isolated lysine. Interestingly, ubiquitin contains seven lysine residues that could be modified by a similar reaction. With this background, the aim of the present work is to explore adduct formation between the triflusal metabolite and ubiquitin as model protein upon sunlight irradiation, combining proteomic and photophysical (fluorescence and laser flash photolysis) techniques. Photophysical and proteomic analysis demonstrate monoadduct formation as the major outcome of the reaction. Interestingly, addition can take place at any of the -amino groups of the lysine residues of the protein and involves replacement of the trifluoromethyl moiety with a new amide function. This process can in principle occur with other trifluoroaromatic compounds and may be responsible for the appearance of undesired photoallergic side effects...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work, the {{coupling}} of the photochemistry in the purely watery environment with the high performance liquid chromatography, was moved successfully. The HPLC on-line method was developed by using a hyphenated technique comprising a photoreactor and HPLC separation. The enrichment and chromatography occurs with two special aqua columns. The developed HPLC on-line method was used successfully for photostability testing with variable pH factors and with different sources of light. The described method allows {{the investigation of the}} most different drugs. Thus, polar as well as lipophilic drugs could be investigated with this method. Especially the application of this method the screening on phototoxic or photoallergic reaction by drugs is to be emphasised. For screening phototoxic reactions the DNA base guanosinemonophosphate was used as model substance. The drugs chlorpromazine and ofloxacine showed under exposure with UVA light interaction and reaction with the DNA base and the phototoxic effect of these drugs could be confirmed with this method. On the other side the diuretic drug hydrochlorothiazide showed no reaction with GMP, although the drug was described in the literature as phototoxic. A reaction of hydrochlorothiazide could be proved by the use of short DNA antisense single-strand instead of the base GMP under exposure with UVA light. However, in attempts with the DNA sense single-strand no interaction could be ascertained. For the screening on photoallergic reaction of drugs the dipeptide alanyltryptophan was used as model substance. The test results to the screening on <b>photoallergy</b> well correlated with the information from the literature. The photoallergic potential could be confirmed for the phenothiazines, hydrochlorothiazide, ofloxacine and mefloquine by the interaction or reaction with the dipeptide. The theory was confirmed that often halogenated drugs are involved in photochemical reactions with biomolecules. The halogenated drugs chlorpromazine, hydrochlorothiazide, ofloxacine and mefloquine turned out especially reactive in present of biomolecules. The not halogenated drugs etodolac and nifedipine showed to the comparison weak reaction with biomolecules. All together distinctive pH dependence has appeared in the carried out investigations. A damage dependent on sequence of the DNA single-strand can be booked with the investigation results. The chromatograms of the DNA antisense strand showed in presence of hydrochlorothiazide, eosine and protoporphyrine a damage or structure change of the DNA antisense strand, while the comparative investigation results showed higher stability to the DNA sense strand. The main application of the described HPLC on-line method is the screening on photoallergic and phototoxic potential of drugs. Drugs in development could be tested with this method in early stage. This method is a low cost alternative to conventional methods. In comparison animal experiments are very time-consuming and are also cost-intensive with it. Outgoing from the introduced results numerous other application possibilities arise. With the developed method new knowledge could be won to understand mechanisms by photosensitizers in photodynamic therapy...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: In 1984, the German, Austrian, and Swiss Photopatch Test Group {{was founded}} to {{standardize}} the photopatch test procedure and to investigate photoallergic reactions, {{as well as}} the epidemiology of <b>photoallergy,</b> in central Europe. Therefore in a first test period from 1985 - 1990, 32 test substances were applied on the backs of patients suspected to be photosensitive. After evaluation of these data, some substances were dismissed, and others were additionally integrated into the test tray. Thus a modified test tray comprising 26 test substances was used for the second test period (1991 - 1997). OBJECTIVE: According to the standard photopatch test procedure defined in the first test period, the aim of this multicenter study was to apply compounds from the modified second test tray to a large group of photosensitive patients. After evaluation of the second test period (1991 - 1997), the outcome was compared with the results of the first period. On the basis of these results and influenced by concurrently published case reports, a third modified photopatch test tray has been established. METHODS: After the application of a duplicate test tray for 24 hours, one test site was irradiated with 10 J/cm(2) UVA, and the other test site served as the control area. Readings were performed immediately and 24, 48, and 72 hours after irradiation. Test reactions were qualitatively graded according to a 4 -point scale and classified by the investigators of the participating centers. In 49 participating clinics 1261 photopatch tests were performed. All data were subjected to computer-assisted analysis by using a specially developed software to classify all positive test reactions as plain contact or photoinduced reactions (nonspecific, toxic, or allergic photoreactions) and to define substance-specific reaction patterns. RESULTS: In test period 1 data of 1129 patients were evaluated. From 2859 positive test reactions, 28. 6 % were excluded as plain contact reactions, 71. 4 % were found to be photoinduced reactions, and 3. 8 % were classified as photoallergic. In test period 2 data of 1261 patients were evaluated. One thousand four hundred fifteen positive test reactions were observed, and of these, 28. 7 % were excluded as plain contact reactions, 71. 3 % were classified as photoinduced reactions, and 8. 1 % were classified as photoallergic reactions. In both test periods nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, disinfectants, and phenothiazines represented the leading photoallergens in the evaluated central European region. By using computer-assisted reaction pattern analysis, substance-specific reaction patterns could be distinguished. These substance-specific reaction patterns comprised 4 main categories: the well-known decrescendo (phototoxic) and crescendo (photoallergic) reaction patterns, as well as a combined and a plateau pattern. CONCLUSION: The test modification after the first test period led to a notably reduced number of positive (mainly nonphotoallergic and thus nonrelevant) test reactions per patient in the second test period (from 2. 6 to 1. 1). In contrast, the percentage of photoallergic reactions increased significantly from 3. 8 % to 8. 1 % of all positive test reactions. Test modifications after the first test period led to a remarkably improved specificity of the photopatch test. Furthermore, substance-specific reaction patterns observed in test period 1 were confirmed in test period 2...|$|E
40|$|Tese de mestrado, Medicamentos à Base de Plantas, Universidade de Lisboa, Faculdade de Farmácia, 2016 Today, {{consumers}} {{are looking for}} effective, safe and natural products that contribute to your health, wellness and beauty. As a result, the consumer created {{the need to develop}} new cosmetic products formulated with natural ingredients such as essential oils. These are complex mixtures of volatile, odoriferous and lipophilic secondary metabolites which are biosynthesized in specialized cells (secretory cells, epidermal cells, glandular trichomes), mainly present in aromatic plants. As natural ingredients, essential oils are a growing market trend for perfumery and cosmetic. In addition to the pleasant odor, they can also be important preservatives due to the strong antimicrobial activity. However, the essential oils are rather volatile and some of its constituents may cause skin sensitivity, for example, contact dermatitis and <b>photoallergy.</b> Thus, Annex III of Regulation No 1223 / 2009, provides a list of substances which cosmetic products must not contain out of the laid down restrictions. Preservatives are added to cosmetic products so that they have an extended shelf-life, preventing the development of microorganism that cause diseases to consumers or harm the appearance of the product. However, legislation concerning chemical preservatives has undergone changes and updates {{as a result of the}} knowledge of sensitivity and toxicity problems inherent to these products. This work aims at highlighting the potential of essential oils, with antimicrobial activity, isolated from native plants in Portugal: Thymus caespititius Brot., Thymbra capitata (L.) Cav., e Myrtus communis L., by including them in topical formulations, in order to assess their capacity as preservatives. The three essential oils, obtained from Th. caespititius, T. capitata and M. communis were isolated from the aerial parts of different flowering plants by hydrodistillation, analyzed by gas chromatography for components quantification and by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, for components identification. All essential oils showed faint yellow colours. The isolated essential oils were complex mixtures, in which 64 constituents for Th. caespititius, 30 in T. capitata and 34 in M. communis were identified. Monoterpenes were the dominant class of compounds (76 %, 97 % and 91 %, respectively), whereas sesquiterpenes ranged between 2 and 16 %, and phenylpropanoids from traces to 3 %. α-Terpineol was the dominant compound Th. caespititius essential oil, while carvacrol dominated the T. capitata essential oil. 1, 8 -Cineole was the major compound present in the essential oil of M. communis. Based on chemical characterization of the three essential oils, including constituents considered as allergens (linalool, limonene, methyl eugenol, citronellol, geraniol and eugenol) present in Regulation 1223 / 2009, Annex III, two essential oils (Thymus caespititius and Thymbra capitata) out of three were chosen to be incorporated at 1 % as bioactive ingredients in topical formulations and the three essential oils (Thymus caespititius, Thymbra capitata and Myrtus communis) were chosen to be incorporated at 0. 5 % in topical formulation, to be assessed for physical-chemical parameters: pH, viscosity, phase separation and particle size. As healthy skin pH is of approximately 5, and topical application to healthy skin products presenting pH of 4 - 6, the pH values for the emulsions of essential oil were within limits. Concerning viscosity, the addition of essential oils greatly increases the breakage resistance of the structure when compared to placebo. These results were in accordance with the analysis of particle size, since the incorporation of essential oils either 1 or 0. 5 % decreases the particle size. All emulsions were stable. Antimicrobial activity was evaluated by the method of Kirby-Bauer and by the method of microdilution plate determining the minimum inhibitory concentration and minimum bactericidal concentrations for the three essential oils with or without dilution in DMSO and, for two controls: Dermosoft® OMP and benzyl alcohol. Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 9027 was extremely susceptible to the essential oil of T. capitata without dilution in DMSO; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 showed greater susceptibility to essential oils Th. caespititius and T. capitata and, lower susceptibility to M. communis essential oil diluted in DMSO (1 : 100). The essential oils of Th. caespititius and T. capitata were effective against fungi, showing better antifungal activity than Dermosoft® OMP for Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Three essential oils (Th. caespititius, T. capitata e M. communis) showed better activity against Gram-positive than Gram-negative bacteria, and these results are in accordance with previous studies. All essential oils showed better results than the two controls. In summary, Th. caespititius, T. capitata and M. communis essential oils were effective against fungi, Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria. Regarding the challenge test, emulsions with 1 % T. caespititius essential oil and T. capitata essential oil and emulsion with 0. 5 % M. communis essential oil are in accordance with the acceptance criteria A (2 Log 10 reduction) for the fungi (Candida albicans ATCC 10231 and Aspergillus brasiliensis ATCC 16404) as well as the bacteria (ATCCC 9027 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538). Th. caespititius and T. capitata essential oils showed potential as alternative preservatives for use in topical formulations. Although the essential oil emulsion with M. communis is in accordance with criteria acceptance of the challenge test (FP 9), the percentage of allergen: methyl eugenol exceeds in percentage used (0. 5 % essential oil) the maximum concentration permitted by law (Regulation nº 1223 / 2009, Annex III). Hoje em dia, os consumidores procuram produtos eficazes, seguros e naturais que contribuam para a sua saúde, bem-estar e beleza. Como resultado, o consumidor criou a necessidade de desenvolver novos produtos cosméticos formulados com ingredientes naturais, tais como os óleos essenciais. Estes são misturas complexas de metabolitos secundários voláteis, lipófilos e odoríferos biosintetizados em estruturas especializadas (células secretoras, células epidérmicas, tricomas glandulares), presentes maioritariamente nas plantas aromáticas. Os óleos essenciais afirmam-se cada vez mais como uma tendência crescente no mercado da perfumaria e da cosmética. Para além de contribuírem com um odor agradável, podem também ser importantes agentes de conservação visto possuírem forte atividade antimicrobiana. Contudo, os óleos essenciais são bastante voláteis e de entre os vários constituintes de um óleo essencial, existem aqueles que produzem sensibilidade na pele provocando, por exemplo: dermatites de contacto e fotoalergia. Assim, o anexo III do Regulamento nº 1223 / 2009, apresenta uma lista de substâncias que os produtos cosméticos não podem conter fora das restrições previstas. Os conservantes são adicionados aos produtos cosméticos para que estes tenham um prazo de conservação alargado, prevenindo o desenvolvimento de microrganismos que causem doenças ao consumidor ou, prejudiquem a aparência do produto. No entanto, a legislação referente aos conservantes químicos tem vindo a sofrer alterações e atualizações em consequência do conhecimento de problemas de sensibilidade e toxicidade inerentes a estes produtos. Assim, este trabalho surge com o objetivo de valorizar os óleos essenciais com atividade antimicrobiana de plantas autóctones em Portugal: Thymus caespititius Brot., Thymbra capitata (L.) Cav., e Myrtus communis L., incluí-los em formulações tópicas, a fim de avaliar as suas capacidades como conservantes. Os três óleos essenciais (Th. caespititius, T. capitata, M. communis) foram isolados das partes aéreas floridas das diferentes plantas por hidrodestilação, analisados por cromatografia gasosa para a quantificação dos seus componentes, e por cromatografia gasosa acoplada a espectrometria de massa para a identificação dos compostos. Todos os óleos essenciais apresentaram uma coloração amarela, tendo sido identificados 64 constituintes em Th. caespititius, 30 em T. capitata e 34 em M. communis, sendo que, os monoterpenos foram a classe de compostos dominantes (76 %, 97 % e 91 %, respetivamente), enquanto os sesquiterpenos variaram entre 2 e 16 %, e os fenilpropanóides de vestigial a 3 %. Para o óleo essencial de Th. caespititius o componente dominante foi α-terpineol, enquanto o óleo essencial de T. capitata apresentou como componente dominante o carvacrol. Já 1, 8 -cineole foi o composto maioritário do óleo essencial de M. communis. Com base na caracterização química dos óleos essenciais em estudo, nomeadamente os constituintes referidos como alérgenos (linalool, limoneno, metil eugenol, citronelol, geraniol e eugenol) no Regulamento nº 1223 / 2009, anexo III, e com consequentes restrições na sua utilização, foram incorporados em emulsões óleo-em-água (O/A) na concentração de 1 %, dois dos óleos essenciais: Th. caespititius e T. capitata, e na concentração de 0, 5 % os três óleos essenciais (Th. caespititius, T. capitata e M. communis), realizando-se uma avaliação físico-química: pH, viscosidade, separação de fases e, tamanho da partícula. O pH de pele saudável apresenta valores próximos de 5, e os produtos de aplicação tópica para pele saudável apresentarem um pH compreendido entre 4 - 6 assim, os valores de pH de todas as emulsões com óleo essencial encontram-se dentro dos limites referidos. Relativamente à viscosidade, a inclusão dos óleos essenciais aumenta significativamente a resistência da estrutura quando comparado com o placebo. O que se confirma com a análise do tamanho da partícula, visto que, de um modo geral, a inclusão dos óleos essenciais quer a 1 %, quer a 0, 5 % diminui o tamanho das partículas. Todas as emulsões foram estáveis. Avaliou-se a atividade antimicrobiana pelo método de Kirby-Bauer e pelo método da microdiluição em placa, determinando-se a concentração mínima inibitória e a concentração mínima bactericida para os três óleos essenciais com e sem diluição em DMSO e, para dois controlos: Dermosoft® OMP e do álcool benzílico. Verificando-se que: Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCCC 9027 foi extremamente suscetível ao óleo essencial de T. capitata sem diluição em DMSO; Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538 apresentou maior suscetibilidade aos óleos essenciais de Th. caespititius e T. capitata e, menor suscetibilidade ao óleo essencial de M. communis diluído em DMSO (1 : 100). Os óleos essenciais de Th. caespititius e T. capitata foram eficazes contra os fungos, revelando melhor atividade antifúngica que Dermosoft® OMP para Candida albicans ATCC 10231. Os três óleos essências (Th. caespititius, T. capitata e M. communis) apresentaram melhor atividade contra bactérias Gram-positivas do que bactérias Gram-negativas, estando estes resultados de acordo com estudos anteriormente realizados. Todos os óleos essenciais revelaram melhores resultados que os dois controlos. Sumariamente, os três óleos essenciais (Th. caespititius, T. capitata e M. communis) mostraram-se eficazes contra fungos, bactérias Gram-positivas e Gram-negativas. Quanto ao teste de eficácia dos conservantes as emulsões com 1 % de Th. caespititius e T. capitata e a emulsão com 0, 5 % de M. communis estão de acordo com o critério de aceitação A (redução de 2 Log 10) quer para os fungos (Candida albicans ATCC 10231 e Aspergillus brasiliensis ATCC 16404) quer para as bactérias (Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCCC 9027 e Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 6538). Os óleos essenciais de Th. caespititius e T. capitata revelaram-se potenciais conservantes alternativos para aplicação em formulações tópicas. Embora a emulsão com óleo essencial de M. communis cumpra com o critério de aceitação do teste de eficácia dos conservantes (FP 9), a percentagem do alérgeno metil eugenol, excede na percentagem utilizada (0, 5 % de óleo essencial) a máxima concentração permitida pela lei (Regulamento 1223 / 2009, anexo III) ...|$|E
