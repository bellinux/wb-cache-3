5|$|Early in 1925, a {{foundation}} <b>pile</b> <b>and</b> some tents {{could be found}} {{at the site of the}} future bridge. Men in the region were also awaiting employment on the structure, and by the middle of the year unemployment problems were becoming a serious issue. Similarly government debt was increasing, although it was still expected the railway line to Abbotsford Bridge would be completed. In November, construction started and it was expected that the bridge would be opened around 25 September the following year.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pile</b> <b>and</b> her co-writers {{initially}} used {{battery packs}} to represent characters, moving them around {{on her desk}} to develop scenarios for the show. The decision to make the characters doctors came later. Pile recalls that she mentioned to Peter Fincham that a hospital setting would work well and that he subsequently reported that Channel 4 were enthusiastic about a hospital location, which settled the matter. Even later still, a plot was developed and wall charts were used to mark up story arcs.|$|E
5|$|The X-10 Graphite Reactor at Oak Ridge National Laboratory (ORNL) in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, {{formerly}} known as the Clinton <b>Pile</b> <b>and</b> X-10 Pile, was the world's second artificial nuclear reactor (after Enrico Fermi's Chicago <b>Pile)</b> <b>and</b> was the first reactor designed and built for continuous operation. Argonne National Laboratory's Experimental Breeder Reactor I, located at the Atomic Energy Commission's National Reactor Testing Station near Arco, Idaho, became the first nuclear reactor to create electricity on 20 December 1951. Initially, four 150-watt light bulbs were lit by the reactor, but improvements eventually enabled it to power the whole facility (later, the town of Arco became the first in the world to have all its electricity come from nuclear power generated by BORAX-III, another reactor designed and operated by Argonne National Laboratory). The world's first commercial scale nuclear power station, Obninsk in the Soviet Union, began generation with its reactor AM-1 on 27 June 1954. Other early nuclear power plants were Calder Hall in England, which began generation on 17 October 1956, and the Shippingport Atomic Power Station in Pennsylvania, which began on 26 May 1958. Nuclear power was used for the first time for propulsion by a submarine, the USS Nautilus, in 1954.|$|E

5|$|The egg is {{generally}} oblong, slightly curved and tapering at one end. In {{the case of}} solitary bees, each one is laid in a cell with a supply of mixed pollen and nectar next to it. This may be rolled into a pellet or placed in a <b>pile</b> <b>and</b> is known as mass provisioning. In social species of bee there is progressive provisioning with the larva being fed regularly while it grows. The nest varies from {{a hole in the}} ground or in wood, in solitary bees, to a substantial structure with wax combs in bumblebees and honey bees.|$|E
5|$|In the 6th century BC, the Greek philosopher Thales of Miletus {{experimented with}} amber rods and these {{experiments}} {{were the first}} studies into the production of electrical energy. While this method, {{now known as the}} triboelectric effect, can lift light objects and generate sparks, it is extremely inefficient. It was not until the invention of the voltaic pile in the eighteenth century that a viable source of electricity became available. The voltaic <b>pile,</b> <b>and</b> its modern descendant, the electrical battery, store energy chemically and make it available on demand in the form of electrical energy. The battery is a versatile and very common power source which is ideally suited to many applications, but its energy storage is finite, and once discharged it must be disposed of or recharged. For large electrical demands electrical energy must be generated and transmitted continuously over conductive transmission lines.|$|E
5|$|With Fate and Other Worlds launched, Palmer {{began to}} plan for a new magazine, to be called Imagination. Material {{for the first two}} issues had been {{assembled}} by mid-1950, but in the early summer Palmer fell down his basement stairs and was left paralyzed from the waist down. While he was hospitalized, much of the work of editing both Other Worlds and Imagination was done by Mahaffey, who coped well, despite her inexperience. An assistant, Marge Budwig Saunder, was hired to read the slush <b>pile</b> <b>and</b> help out. The magazine's first issue, dated October 1950 on a planned bi-monthly schedule, appeared on news stands 1 August 1950. However, in September that year, Ziff-Davis made the decision to move to New York from Chicago; Palmer promptly contacted William Hamling, {{who did not want to}} relocate and suggested that Hamling take over Imagination. Like Palmer, Hamling had made preparations to leave Ziff-Davis by establishing a separate publishing company, Greenleaf Publishing, and in November 1950 Hamling left Ziff-Davis and became Imaginations editor and publisher.|$|E

25|$|The deck is shuffled and six {{cards are}} dealt to each player; the {{remainder}} becomes a draw <b>pile</b> <b>and</b> a discard pile forms next to it. Each player's turn {{begins with a}} draw of one card and a play of one card, so that each player always holds 6 cards {{at the end of}} his turn. If a player cannot play that player must discard (any card in hand). Discarded cards are dead and cannot be taken for any reason.|$|E
25|$|Oysters are {{harvested}} by simply gathering {{them from their}} beds. In very shallow waters, they can be gathered by hand or with small rakes. In somewhat deeper water, long-handled rakes or oyster tongs are used to reach the beds. Patent tongs can be lowered on a line to reach beds that are too deep to reach directly. In all cases, the task is the same: the oysterman scrapes oysters into a <b>pile,</b> <b>and</b> then scoops them up with the rake or tongs.|$|E

The stream is, however, much narrowed by the houses which project into it upon <b>piles,</b> <b>and</b> within these, again, there is a row of houses built upon great bamboo rafts, which are moored by rattan cables to the shore or to <b>piles,</b> <b>and</b> rise and fall with the tide.|$|R
25|$|Silk is an {{expensive}} material, and {{has been used for}} representative carpets. Its tensile strength has been used in silk warps, but silk also appears in the carpet pile. Silk pile can be used to highlight special elements of the design. High-quality carpets from Kashan, Qum, Nain, and Isfahan have all-silk piles. Silk pile carpets are often exceptionally fine, with a short <b>pile</b> <b>and</b> an elaborate design. Silk pile is less resistant to mechanical stress, thus, all-silk piles are often used as wall hangings, or pillows.|$|E
25|$|The {{situation}} with bumblebees (Bombus) is rather different. They too are unpalatable, {{in the sense}} of being difficult to eat: their body is covered with setae (like carpet <b>pile)</b> <b>and</b> is armoured; they are sometimes described as being 'non-food'. Mostler in 1935 carried out tests of their palatability: with the exception of specialist bee-eaters, adults of 19 species of birds ate only 2% of 646 bumblebees presented to them. After various trials, Mostler attributed their avoidance mainly to mechanical difficulties in handling: one young bird took 18 minutes to subdue, kill and eat a bumblebee.|$|E
25|$|The {{interior}} of the synagogue was redesigned in the mid-18th century by Vilnian German Johann Christoph Glaubitz. It had the overwhelming grandeur of an edifice {{in the style of}} the Italian Renaissance and an awe-inspiring atmosphere. Four massive, equidistant columns supported the vast stone-floored <b>pile,</b> <b>and</b> within them was the three-tiered ornate, rococo bimah, with a beautiful cupola, supported by eight small columns. It was built in the second half of the eighteenth century by Rabbi Judah ben Eliezer (commonly known as the YeSoD – an acronym of the three words Yehudah Sofer ve-Dayyan), the famous scribe and judge.|$|E

25|$|In April 1863, Federal ironclads and shore {{batteries}} began a {{bombardment of}} Fort Moultrie {{and the other}} forts around Charleston harbor. Over the ensuing twenty months, Union bombardment reduced Fort Sumter to a rubble <b>pile</b> <b>and</b> pounded Fort Moultrie below a sand hill, which protected it against further bombardment. The Rifled cannon proved its superiority to brickwork fortifications {{but not to the}} endurance of the Confederate artillerymen who continued to man Fort Moultrie. In February 1865, as General Sherman marched through South Carolina, the Confederate soldiers finally abandoned the rubble of Fort Moultrie and evacuated the city of Charleston.|$|E
25|$|Augercast piles cause minimal disturbance, and {{are often}} used for noise and {{environmentally}} sensitive sites. Augercast piles are not generally suited for use in contaminated soils, due to expensive waste disposal costs. In cases such as these however a displacement pile may provide the cost efficiency of an augercast <b>pile</b> <b>and</b> minimal environmental impact. In ground containing obstructions or cobbles and boulders, augercast piles are less suitable as refusal above the design pile tip elevation may be encountered. In certain cases drill motors that produce more torque and horsepower {{may be able to}} mitigate these events.|$|E
25|$|The carpet is {{produced}} on a loom {{quite similar to}} woven fabric. The pile can be plush or Berber. Plush carpet is a cut <b>pile</b> <b>and</b> Berber carpet is a loop pile. There are new styles of carpet combining the two styles called cut and loop carpeting. Normally many colored yarns are used and this process is capable of producing intricate patterns from predetermined designs (although some limitations apply to certain weaving methods with regard to accuracy of pattern within the carpet). These carpets are usually the most expensive due to the relatively slow speed of the manufacturing process. These are very famous in Iran, India, Pakistan and Arabia.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a stochastic method for predicting the scour depth around vertical circular slender <b>piles</b> <b>and</b> below marine pipelines due to random waves plus current on mild sloping seabeds. An {{overview of the}} scour mechanisms around vertical <b>piles</b> <b>and</b> below marine pipelines is given. The background of the scour around vertical <b>piles</b> <b>and</b> below marine pipelines on flat and sloping seabeds under regular waves and random waves alone, as well as random waves plus current is presented. A point model of the wave height distribution, consisting of two two-parameter Weibulldistribution, is chosen to describe the wave condition on mild sloping seabeds includingbreaking waves. For vertical piles, a truncated wave height distribution is developed because the scour formula is valid above a threshold value. Four slopes are considered for waves alone case for the vertical <b>piles</b> <b>and</b> the pipelines. The effect of combined waves plus current on scour is studied. For waves plus current, the relationship between scour depth and the current velocity is presented. A comparison between a stochastic method and an approximate method is made. </p...|$|R
