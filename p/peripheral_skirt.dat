50|$|Practical {{hovercraft}} use a <b>peripheral</b> <b>skirt</b> system, {{where the}} air from the lift fans is routed to a narrow slot {{around the edge of}} the hull, and bound by a flexible skirt. Distribution of this air from the fans to the periphery is through a large-volume plenum chamber, so as to provide even distribution of airflow without sensitivity to the length of the direct path.|$|E
50|$|In {{cases where}} {{there have been}} several graft {{failures}} or the risk for keratoplasty is high, synthetic corneas can substitute successfully for donor corneas. Such a device contains a <b>peripheral</b> <b>skirt</b> and a transparent central region. These two parts are connected on a molecular level by an interpenetrating polymer network, made from poly-2-hydroxyethyl methacrylate (pHEMA). AlphaCor is a U.S. FDA-approved type of synthetic cornea measuring 7.0 mm in diameter and 0.5 mm in thickness. The main advantages of synthetic corneas are that they are biocompatible, and the network between the parts and the device prevents complications that could arise at their interface. The probability of retention in one large study was estimated at 62% at 2 years follow-up.|$|E
40|$|The {{configuration}} of the nozzle exit of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>skirt</b> of A. C. V. has hitherto been designed mainly {{in view of the}} hydrodynamic contact drag and the seaworthiness characteristics, and this has brought successful results. 　At the present stage of development, however, it seems to be worthwhile to analyze the nozzle configuration in view of the hovering performance of A. C. V [...] The present study experimental analyzes the effect of the {{configuration of}} nozzle exit on the hovering performance...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} of vertical, horizontal and moment (VHM) loads {{acting on a}} shallow foundation is complex, and {{it is becoming increasingly}} popular to represent ultimate limit states under general VHM loading as failure envelopes in three-dimensional load space. General loading is of particular interest offshore, where harsh environmental conditions lead to large horizontal and moment foundation loads. Shallow foundations with <b>peripheral</b> <b>skirts</b> that penetrate into the seabed are used to resist large lateral and overturning forces. During undrained loading, tensile resistance can be mobilised {{on the underside of the}} base plate by suctions developed within the skirt compartment. This paper presents failure envelopes and kinematic mechanisms for undrained ultimate limit states of circular skirted foundations in uniform and heterogeneous deposits under general VHM loading based on finite element results. An approximating method is proposed that permits accurate prediction of ultimate limit states under a full range of general loading. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{design for}} a transoceanic, dry cargo-carrying {{freighter}} is suggested; its use and operation in port are discussed. With a gross weight of 4500 metric tons (5000 tons), more than 50 percent of which is cargo, it will cruise at 50 meters per second (100 knots) in waves 2. 4 meters (8 ft) high. Its <b>peripheral</b> jet-flexible <b>skirt</b> air cushion concept and air thrustors will let the freighter go over waves 8 meters high at reduced velocity. Power comes from a 1280 megawatt, helium-cooled thermal reactor. It could dock at any major port in the world, but because it needs no surface contact, it could also travel inland to land-locked ports. A modular terminal design and methods of cargo transfer are suggested. The concept of cargo containerization influences both the freighter and terminal design...|$|R
40|$|A single fabric testing {{apparatus}} {{is capable of}} measuring mechanical and thermal characteristics of a specimen previously carried out in separate {{testing apparatus}}es. The single apparatus is provided with a plurality of mechanical and temperature sensors and a heatable top plate. In use, a ram moves the top plate vertically downwards to press a fabric specimen against a bottom plate. The plate {{is surrounded by a}} fixed upstanding <b>peripheral</b> <b>skirt</b> against which an outer periphery of the specimen is bent to enable shearing and bending characteristics to be measured. The bottom plate is biased upwards by a spring which is compressed until the top plate is arrested by a fixed frame member. Further downward movement of the ram enables compressibility of the specimen to be determined. A rotatable section of the top plate can be turned by a stepping motor to determine the surface friction characteristics of the specimen.

40|$|Scarcity of donor {{tissue to}} treat corneal {{blindness}} {{and the need}} to deliver stem cells or pharmacologic agents to ensure corneal graft survival are major challenges. Here, new composite collagen-based hydrogels are developed as implants to restore corneal transparency while serving as a possible reservoir for cells and drugs. The composite hydrogels have a centrally transparent core and embedded <b>peripheral</b> <b>skirt</b> of adjustable transparency and degradability, with the skirt exhibiting faster degradation in vitro. Both core and skirt supported human epithelial cell populations in vitro and the skirt merged homogeneously with the core material to smoothly distribute a mechanical load in vitro. After in vivo transplantation in rabbit corneas over three months, composites maintained overall corneal shape and integrity, while skirt degradation could be tracked in vivo and non-invasively due to partial opacity. Skirt degradation was associated with partial collagen breakdown, thinning, and migration of host stromal cells and macrophages, while the central core maintained integrity and transparency as host cells migrated and nerves regenerated. IMPACT: This study indicates the feasibility of a collagen-based composite hydrogel to maintain corneal stability and transparency while providing a degradable peripheral reservoir for cell or substance release.

40|$|A {{series of}} in vitro {{screening}} assays for the preliminary selection of biomaterials {{for use in}} the fabrication of artificial corneas (keratoprostheses) (KPros) have been investigated. These screening assays assessed the initial binding of inflammatory and cell adhesive proteins, activation of inflammatory proteins, adhesion of keratocytes, epithelial cells and macrophages and the production of inflammatory cytokines by keratocytes contacting biomaterials. Central optic biomaterials were {{selected on the basis of}} low-inflammatory and cell adhesion potential. <b>Peripheral</b> <b>skirt</b> materials were selected on the basis of low-inflammatory potential but good cell adhesion to anchor the implant within the host cornea. Green fluorescent protein (GFP) gene transfer was used in a novel context to investigate cell invasion in the absence of external staining techniques. Confocal laser scanning microscopy and scanning electron microscopy were used to investigate GFP positive keratocyte invasion of porous materials. The results of in vitro assays were compared to a corneal organ culture system in which the biomaterials were assessed within a stromal environment. A range of polyurethane-based interpenetrating polymers with a range of water contents were screened. All materials showed low-inflammatory potential. A reduction in biomaterial water content induced an increase in complement C 3 and fibronectin binding and in cell adhesion to materials, whilst differences in co-monomer formulation had little impact. The screening methods used in the current study provide a suitable preliminary assessment regime for the in vitro evaluation of potential KPro materials...|$|E
40|$|Hydrogels may be {{described}} as cross~linked hydrophilic polymers that swell but do not dissolve in water. They have been utilised in many biomedical applications, as there is the potential to manipulate the properties for a given application by changing the chemical structure of the constituent monomers. This project {{is focused on the}} development of novel hydrogels for keratoprosthesis (KPro). The most commonly used KPro model consists of a tansparent central stem witb a porous <b>peripheral</b> <b>skirt.</b> Clear poly (methyl methacrylate) (PMMA) core material used in the Strampelli KPros prosthesis has not been the cause of failure found in other core and skirt prostheses. However, epithelialization of this kind of solid, rigid optic material is clearly impossible. The approach {{to the development of a}} hydrogeJ for potential KPro use adopted in this work is to develop soft core material to mimic the properties of the natural cornea by incorporating some hydrophilic monomers such as N, N-dimethyacrylamide (NNSMA) N~vinyl pyrrolidone (NVP) and acryloylmorpholine (AMO) with methyl methactylate (MMA). Most of these materials have been used in other ophthalmic applications, such as contact lens. However, an unavoidable limitation of simple. MMA copolymers as conventional hydrogels is poor mechanical strength. The hydrogel for use in this application must be able to withstand the stresses involved during the surgical procedure involved with KPro surgery and the in situ stresses such as the deforming force of the eyelid during the blink cycle. Thus, semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (SIPNs) based on ester polyurethane, AMO, NVP and NNDMA were examined in this work and were found to have much improved mechanical properties at water contents between 40 % and 70 %. Polyethylene glycol monomethacrylate (PEG MA) was successfully incorporated in order to modulate protein deposition and cell adhesion. Porous peripheral skirts were fabricated using different types of porosigen. The water content mechanical properties, surface properties and cell response of these various materials have been investigated in this thesis. These studies demonstrated that simple hydrogel SIPNs which show isotropic mechanical behaviour, are not ideal KPro materials since they do not mimic the anisotropic behaviour of natural cornea. The final stage of the work has concentrated on the study of hydrogels reinforced with mesh materials. They offer a promising approach to making a hydrogel that is very flexible but strong under tension, thereby having mechanical properties closer to the natural cornea than has been previously possible...|$|E
40|$|Gated {{high-rise}} living {{has become}} the most popular housing for middle-class citizens in China re¬cently. The traditional definition of Chinese commu¬nity has been changed and merchandized by liberation of housing market in 1980 s. Technology, urban popula-tion growth and high profits empowered the boom of high-rise living. Gated high-rise living stands out in the suburbs distinctively with its physical density and so¬cial implications, separating the suburban fabric. Why is gated high-rise living prevailing in China? How does a high-rise gated community form symbolic and physi¬cal barriers for its homeowners and a new dimension of social segregation in Changsha? How can public and private spaces be re-defined on the <b>peripheral</b> <b>skirt</b> be¬tween gated communities and its surroundings? The aim of the research is to define gated high-rise communities in the suburban context in China, to learn about physical form, interfaces, archetypes and daily lives from the objective, and to give guidance to future design. Literature review will give explanations about the phenomenon of gated high rise living, its character¬istics and reasons for its formation. The research will be grounded to Changsha, rapidly urbanizing city in the central south China. Regional scale investigation will be focused on housing, living and the city. At the lo¬cal scale, observations, visual documentary, interviews and questionnaires are combined to reflect on the daily lives in gated high rise communities. Large areas of suburban land have been zoned, gated and privatized, which leave the suburb to be patched with enclaves. The pursuit of profit and state policy allowance are the main reasons for high-rise living. Social inequality and income gap formed of physical and social borders. Urban space between the enclaves and the interfaces are neglected. The high-density inside the gate calls for more public infrastruc¬tures, while the residents outside the gate have to get into the community for urban greenery. Comparison between the lives outside and inside the community in¬spires further design. The speed of sprawling gated high rise commu¬nities can be slowed down, while waiting for the infra¬structures and population to catch up. Neglected urban spaces need to be studied, in order to be improved. So¬cial segregation should be minimized and residents of different social status {{have the right to be}} merged for common good. Residents’ customs and innovations for operating urban space should be respected and studied...|$|E
