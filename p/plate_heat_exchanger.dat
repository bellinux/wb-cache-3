The starboard engine was not affected because it used a separate sea water intake {{in the bottom of}} the vessel.

25|$|Another device {{which has}} contributed {{significantly}} to milk quality is the <b>plate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> (PHE). This device utilizes a number of specially designed stainless steel plates with small spaces between them. Milk is passed between every other set of plates with water being passed between {{the balance of the}} plates to remove heat from the milk. This method of cooling can remove large amounts of heat from the milk in a very short time, thus drastically slowing bacteria growth and thereby improving milk quality. Ground water is the most common source of cooling medium for this device. Dairy cows consume approximately 3 gallons of water for every gallon of milk production and prefer to drink slightly warm water as opposed to cold ground water. For this reason, PHE's can result in drastically improved milk quality, reduced operating costs for the dairymen by reducing the refrigeration load on his bulk milk cooler, and increased milk production by supplying the cows with a source of fresh warm water.|$|E

The heart of the heat exchanger contains a fully welded circular plate pack made by pressing and cutting round plates and welding them together.

Plate and shell technology offers high heat transfer, high pressure, high operating temperature, uling and close approach temperature. In particular, it does completely without gaskets, which provides security against leakage at high pressures and temperatures.|$|E

Hence, it is important to develop simulation strategies for <b>plate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers</b> accurately. This analysis represents the dynamic behaviour of the single pass <b>plate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>exchangers,</b> considering flow maldistribution from port to channel. In addition to maldistribution the fluid axial dispersion is used to characterise the back mixing and other deviations from plug flow. Due to unequal distribution of the fluid, the velocity of the fluid varies from channel to channel and hence the heat transfer coefficient variation is also taken into consideration. Solutions to the governing equations have been obtained using the method of Laplace transform followed by numerical inversion from frequency domain. The results are presented on the effects of flow maldistribution and conventional <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger</b> parameters on the temperature transients of both U-type and Z-type configurations. It is found that the effect of flow maldistribution is significant and it deteriorates the thermal performance as well as the characteristic features of the dynamic response of the <b>heat</b> <b>exchanger.</b> In contrast to the previous studies, here the axial dispersion describes the inchannel back mixing alone, not maldistribution, which is physically more appropriate.

50|$|A <b>plate</b> <b>heat</b> <b>{{exchanger}}</b> {{is a type}} of {{heat exchanger}} that uses metal plates to transfer heat between two fluids. This has a major advantage over a conventional heat exchanger in that the fluids are exposed to a much larger surface area because the fluids spread out over the plates. This facilitates the transfer of heat, and greatly increases the speed of the temperature change. Plate heat exchangers are now common and very small brazed versions are used in the hot-water sections of millions of combination boilers. The high heat transfer efficiency for such a small physical size has increased the domestic hot water (DHW) flowrate of combination boilers.
