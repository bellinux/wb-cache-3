40|$|Objective: Surgical revascularization is the {{standard}} treatment of complex blunt traumatic extremity vas-cular injuries. Limb salvage may be improved with minimally invasive endovascular therapies because {{of the ability to}} perform diagnostic and therapeutic intervention simultaneously. Two cases of acute limb-threatening arterial injuries successfully treated with percutaneous endovascular therapy are reported.

Although {{a series}} of risk factors for contrast-induced {{nephropathy}} are known, data on significance {{of some of the}} risk factors such as age, sex, hypercholesterolemia, hyperuricemia, and dose of contrast medium are inconsistent. Our aim was to identify risk factors for contrast-related acute kidney injury (AKI). Materials and Methods. In this prospective study, 290 consecutive patients with a serum creatinine level lower than 3 mg/dL undergoing <b>percutaneous</b> <b>angiography</b> were analyzed. Contrast-related AKI was evaluated using the risk, injury, failure, loss, and end-stage (RIFLE) criteria, and its correlation with clinical and laboratory data of the patients was analyzed. Results. Contrast-related AKI was found in 15. 5 % of the patients, with a maximum RIFLE category (risk in 13. 8 %, injury in 1. 4 %, and failure in 0. 3 %). Serum creatinine level, contrast volume, safe contrast volume factor, diabetes mellitus, and dehydration were significantly associated with contrast-related AKI. Age, sex, and serum uric acid level did not differ significantly between those with and without contrast-related AKI. Multiple logistic regression analysis disclosed diabetes mellitus to be the strongest predictor for being at risk of contrast-related AKI (odds ratio, 5. 1; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 9 to 11. 0; P =. 001), followed by hypercholesterolemia (odds ratio, 4. 6; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 1 to 8. 3; P =. 03), and an estimated glomerular filtration rate lower than 90 mL/min/ 1. 73 m 2 (odds ratio, 3. 0; 95 % confidence interval, 1. 8 to 5. 7; P =. 003).

40|$|Ischemic nephropathy: Detection and {{therapeutic}} intervention. Although the real prevalence of ischemic nephropathy {{as a cause}} of end-stage renal disease is unknown, its incidence has increased in past years. The diagnosis of this pathology requires that a number of functional and anatomic tests be carried out. The initial approach should be to perform duplex Doppler ultrasonography which, besides providing data on the size and extent of the stenosis, enables the intrarenal resistive index to be estimated to determine the pattern of renal parenchyma injury and the expected progression if revascularized. The most frequently used morphologic techniques are magnetic resonance angiography and computer tomography angiography. In the event of ischemic neuropathy, it is necessary to perform a renal arteriography regardless of the inherent risks of contrast toxicity or atheroembolism. Various therapeutic options are reviewed, with emphasis on <b>percutaneous</b> transluminal renal <b>angiography</b> plus stent as the first indication.

40|$|BACKGROUND] Out-of-hospital {{cardiac arrest}} {{is one of}} the most severe {{preclinical}} emergencies. In recent guidelines an invasiv diagnostic strategy is recommended in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction and in cases where an acute ischaemic cause can not be ruled out. Good neurological outcome has been shown in patients undergoing primary PCI after succesfull re- suscitation. However, to identify the underlying reason for out-of-hospital cardiac arrest remains challenging. Therefore, we studied the causes, results of invasiv diagnostic and outcome in survi- vors of out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. [METHODS] All cases of primary successfull resuscitation by the NEF- 4205 from 2007 to 2012 who were admitted to the Charité – Campus Benjamin Franklin (CBF) were retrospectively ana- lyzed. Patient files and electronic databases were reviewed and ECGs and coronary angiograms evaluated. [RESULTS] We found 767 out-of-hospital resuscitation attempts. 220 (28, 7 %) were successful and admitted to hospitals, 166 (21, 6 %) to the CBF. In the majority of 114 of the 166 cases (68, 7 %) the underlying cause was cardiovascular. An acute coronary ischaemia was present in 63 cases (38 %), a pulmonary cause in 16 cases (9, 6 %). The EMT physician suspected in 130 cases (82, 3 %) a cardiac cause significantly (p= 0, 031) more often than actually present. 91 Patients (54, 8 %) underwent emergency <b>percutaneous</b> coronary <b>angiography</b> but only in 57 cases (62, 6 %) a culprit lesion was found. Diagnostic ECG changes were significantly accociated with the detection of a culprit lesion (p= 0, 007). In 21 cases (47, 7 %) a culprit lesion was present without diagnostic ECG changes. In 23 cases (52, 3 %) neither a culprit lesion nor diagnostic ECG changes were found. Overall 55 Patients (34, 0 %) survived to discharge with a CPC of 1 or 2 and 32 (19, 8 %) with a CPC of 3 or 4. 75 patients (46, 3 %) died before discharge. Cardiac causes (p= 0, 001), bystander CPR (p< 0, 001), shockable rhythm (p< 0, 001), younger age (p< 0, 001) and primary PCI (p< 0, 001). Therapeutic hypothermia showed no significant difference in neurological outco- me(p= 0, 728). [CONCLUSION] Cardiac causes are dominant in patients with out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. An akute coronary ischaemia was present in 38 %. The ECG remains an important tool predicting culprit lesions even if many culprit lesions are present without diagnostic ECG-changes after suc- cessfull resuscitation. Since a suspected cardiac cause and a <b>percutaneous</b> coronary <b>angiography</b> with PCI are associated with improved neurological outcome an invasiv strategy seems to be beneficial unless a cardiac cause can not be ruled out...|$|R

We tested the hypothesis that stronger platelet response to aspirin in these patients at admission might be associated with higher initial coronary flow in the IRA. [...] - METHODS: Platelet response to aspirin was assessed with Multiplate((R)) ASPI-test before coronary angiography in 70 patients on previous aspirin treatment admitted for acute STEMI. Coronary flow on initial angiogram was evaluated quantitatively according to the Thrombolysis in Myocardial Infarction (TIMI) grading system. Depending {{on the degree of}} arachidonic acid (AA) induced platelet aggregation in ASPI-test, patients were stratified into four quartiles and compared according to initial TIMI flow. [...] - RESULTS: When TIMI flow was compared according to quartiles of platelet aggregation in ASPI-test, we have found significantly higher frequency of TIMI- 2 and TIMI- 3 flow among patients with low values of ASPI-test, i. e. with stronger aspirin response (P= 0. 014). None of the patients in the highest quartile of ASPI-test had TIMI flow of 2 or 3.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} paper is to discuss {{strategies}} to minimize contrast medium (CM) doses in patients at risk of CM-induced nephropathy (CIN) after computed tomographic <b>angiography</b> (CTA), and <b>percutaneous</b> catheter <b>angiography</b> (PCA) and vascular interventions (PVI). In general a gram-iodine (g-I) /eGFR ratio >= 1. 0 {{appears to be a}} significant and independent predictor of CIN in CTA and coronary interventions. In high CIN-risk patients (e. g., eGFR < 45 ml/min or multiple risk factors), it is recommended to keep the g-I/eGFR ratio < 0. 5. In azotemic patients, 80 kVp CTA may be accomplished with 100 - 150 mg I/kg while x-ray tube loading must be increased to maintain the contrast-to-noise ratio at an acceptable level. Peripheral PCA/PVI based on digital subtraction technique may be performed with 75 - 150 mg I/ml, or even lower if the equipment permits manual setting of the x-ray tube potential. Coronary arteriography/interventions may be achieved with 140 - 150 mg I/ml, i. e., less than half the routinely used concentrations (similar to 320 - 370 mg I/ml), especially in thinner patients with increased iodine attenuation due to automatic down regulation of the x-ray tube potential.

Transcranial Doppler can detect microembolic signals which are characterized by unidirectional high intensity increase, short duration, random occurrence, and a “whistling ” sound. Microembolic signals have been detected {{in a number of}} clinical settings: carotid artery stenosis, aortic arch plaques, atrial fibrillation, myocardial infarction, prosthetic heart valves, patent foramen ovale, valvular stenosis, during invasive procedures (<b>angiography,</b> <b>percutaneous</b> transluminal angioplasty), surgery (carotid, cardiopulmonary bypass, orthopedic), and in certain systemic diseases. Microembolic signals are frequent in large artery disease, less commonly detected in cardioembolic stroke, and infrequent in lacunar stroke. This article provides an overview about the current state of technical and clinical aspects of microembolus detection. 1...|$|R
