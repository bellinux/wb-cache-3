25|$|From a legal standpoint, the Rorschach test {{images have}} been in the public domain for many years in most countries, {{particularly}} those with a copyright term of up to 70 years <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>auctoris.</b> They {{have been in}} the public domain in Hermann Rorschach's native Switzerland since 1992 (70 years after the author's death, or 50 years after the cut-off date of 1942), according to Swiss copyright law. They are also in the public domain under United States copyright law where all works published before 1923 are considered to be in the public domain. This means that the Rorschach images may be used by anyone for any purpose. William Poundstone was, perhaps, first to make them public in his 1983 book Big Secrets, where he also described the method of administering the test.|$|E
50|$|For {{collaborative}} works, {{the date}} of death of the last collaborator serves as the reference point for the 70 year <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>auctoris</b> period (Art. L123-2).

50|$|The {{principal}} {{goal was}} {{to ensure that there}} was a single duration for copyright and related rights across the entire European Union. The chosen term for a work was 70 years from the death of the author (<b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>auctoris,</b> pma) for authors' rights regardless of when the work was first lawfully published (Art. 1), longer than the 50 year <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>auctoris</b> term required by the Berne Convention for the Protection of Literary and Artistic Works (Art. 7.1 Berne Convention). In the case that the author is anonymous or pseudonymous the term for a work is 70 years from the date of first lawful publication. The directive notes that the original goal of the Berne Convention was to protect works for two generations after the death of the author, and that fifty years was no longer sufficient for this purpose (para. 5 of the preamble). It is often stated that 70 years pma was the longest copyright term of any Member State at the time: this is not strictly correct, and is not quoted as the reason for the choice in the directive. Where a Member State protected a work for a longer period at the time the directive came into force, the copyright term is not reduced 10(1), but other Member States will not respect the longer period.|$|E

RG had lower specific activities of GAPDH and aldolase A than NG while Vm and Km values of both enzymes were not different between groups. RG showed lower high ionic strength (HIS) and pellet protein extractabilities at 20 min <b>post</b> <b>mortem.</b> It also had lower low ionic strength (LIS) and HIS protein extractabilities at 24 h <b>post</b> <b>mortem.</b> Besides pellet protein, muscular protein extractabilities at 24 h <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> were higher than at 20 min <b>post</b> <b>mortem.</b> From SDS-PAGE of samples at 24 h <b>post</b> <b>mortem,</b> RG exhibited lower band intensities at 45 and 200 kDa, which were further identified as actin and myosin heavy chain (MHC), respectively.

In the context of the general abolition of legal and testimonial succession rights, the nationalization decree of November 26, 1918 also reduced the copyright term from the 50 years p.m.a. (<b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>auctoris</b> - [...] "after the author's death") of the Tsarist copyright law to the lifetime of the author. Assignments of copyrights in their entirety were invalidated by a decree of October 10, 1919. Under the Tsarist law, an author could transfer his copyrights to a publisher; under Soviet doctrine, this was not possible: an author could only grant a publisher a time-limited publication right, a principle that would hold throughout the existence of the Soviet Union. Furthermore, the contracts to be used were standardized and a fixed schedule for royalties was defined by a decree of October 25, 1918.|$|E
5000|$|The {{printing}} prerogatives granted {{until then}} were rights accorded to the printers, {{not to the}} authors of a work. The first copyright provisions in a modern sense as rights an author has over uses of his work appeared in the reign of Alexander I, when he issued on April 22, 1828 a [...] "Statute on censorship" [...] ( [...] ; Устав о цензуре) that contained five articles on copyright. This law granted authors or translators the exclusive rights to reproduce, publish, and distribute their works, and recognized their right {{to be paid for}} uses or reproductions of their works. Copyright was automatic and was vested in the author or translator upon the creation of the work and without any need for a registration. The law defined a copyright term of the lifetime of the author plus 25 years (25 years p.m.a. - <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>auctoris).</b> It also defined a [...] "freedom of translation": any work was free to be translated without the consent of its author, and the translator got a new copyright on the translation. Copyright was extinguished if the work didn't meet the censorship regulations (i.e., was censored).|$|E

METHODS [...] A nationwide survey of Royal College of Pathologists' district tutors (n = 216) was done by postal questionnaire. These were completed by the district tutors or passed on to their histopathologist colleagues. The results were collated after three months. After one follow up letter, an 86 % response rate, which is a significant sample, was achieved. RESULTS [...] Twenty eight per cent of respondents were performing HIV <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> examinations. Of {{those who were not}} performing them (30 %), the lack of clinical or coroner requests was the most common explanation. All regions provide facilities for HIV <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> examinations, as judged by the responses.

5000|$|Each new {{technology}} for creative work {{has led to}} debate over what protection should be accorded to such works, {{as has been the}} case most recently for software copyright and database rights. Similar debates occurred over the copyright protection of photographs. The Berne Convention allows a shorter period of protection than for other works (twenty-five years from creation rather than fifty years <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> <b>auctoris,</b> Art. 7.4), and many countries apply a different period of copyright protection to photographs than to other works. An alternative approach, adopted notably by Germany and Italy, has been to offer full copyright protection to photographs that are clearly [...] "artistic works" [...] and protect all photographs, whatever their creative value, by a shorter sui generis related right. This focuses the debate on those photographs that still have value {{at the end of the}} sui generis protection (no-one would bother to try to protect photographs without value), which are the photographs most likely original. However it also means that photographs are subject to a higher test of originality than other works of art, with copyright being reserved only for those the courts felt to be particularly meritous, in contravention of the spirit (if not the letter) of the Berne Convention. The sui generis protections are found at § 72, UrhG for Germany (50 years) and Arts. 87 - 92, Legge 22 aprile 1941 n. 633 for Italy (20 years). The different treatment of photographs and other artistic works was eliminated by European Union Directive 93/98/EEC (Art. 6), which states that the only applicable criterion for copyright protection is that the photograph be [...] "original in the sense that they are the author's own intellectual creation", a lower criterion than used until then, but equivalent to the criterion used for other copyright works. The sui generis protection may be retained for photographs that do not meet this criterion (e.g., photographs taken automatically such as for a passport).|$|E
40|$|Huntington {{disease is}} {{associated}} with elongation of a CAG repeat in the HTT gene that results in a mutant huntingtin protein. Several studies have implicated N-terminal huntingtin protein fragments in Huntington disease pathogenesis. Ideally, these fragments are studied in human brain tissue. However, the use of human brain tissue comes with certain unavoidable variables such as <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay, artefacts from freeze-thaw cycles and subject-to-subject variation. Knowledge on how these variables might affect N-terminal huntingtin protein fragments in <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> human brain is important for a proper interpretation of study results. The effect of <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay on protein in human brain is known to {{vary depending on the}} protein of interest. In the present study, we have assessed the effect of <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay on N-terminal huntingtin protein fragments using western blot. We mimicked <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay in one individual control case and one individual Huntington disease case with low initial <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay. The influence of subject-to-subject variation on N-terminal huntingtin fragments was assessed in human cortex and human striatum using two cohorts of control and Huntington disease subjects. Our results show that effects of <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay on N-terminal huntingtin protein fragments are minor in our individual subjects. Additionally, one freeze-thaw cycle decreases the huntingtin western blot signal intensity in the cortex control subject, but does not introduce additional N-terminal huntingtin fragments. Our results suggest that subject-to-subject variation contributes more to variability in N-terminal huntingtin fragments than <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> delay...|$|R

Lamb carcasses were sampled for total aerobic viable and Enterobacteriaceae counts just after dressing and 24 h <b>post</b> <b>mortem.</b> A significant effect (p< 0. 05) of <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> treatment on carcasses temperature and pH was found corres-ponding the faster pH fall to slowly chilled muscles.

40|$|The paper {{focuses on}} the <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> mandate, an {{agreement}} used to protect some interests arising after the mandator’s death, both in Italian legal system and in Roman Law. Given that the latest doctrine has considered invalid a <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> mandate where {{the nature of the}} mandatory’s tasks is economic, as it does not comply with art. 458 Cod.

After analysing the current legislation, also within the framework of European private law, the research dwells on <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> mandatum in Roman law, trying to show that such consensual contract could be considered as a succession agreement. After having demonstrated the difference between the mandatum <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> (understood as a contract) and other testamentary dispositions defined as mandatum <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> as well, a source showing the possible economic nature of the Roman mandatum <b>post</b> <b>mortem</b> is considered, to conclude that there were Roman law cases, like that of Gaio in D. 17. 1. 13, proving the existence of bilateral agreements intended to fulfil an economic function casually related to the mandator’s death...|$|R
