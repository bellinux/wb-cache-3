25|$|The {{rescue effort}} by {{drilling}} was put off on Monday 1 May {{because of the}} danger of another collapse. It was decided to use a raise borer anchored in concrete, with the last load of the concrete being delivered before dawn on Wednesday, 3 May 2006. The machine cut a horizontal tunnel one metre round. Later that day it was announced that the drilling to go the final 12 metres would commence within hours. At about 6:45 p.m., drilling of a 20cm <b>pilot</b> <b>hole</b> for the raise borer commenced. Using the normal procedure for this machinery, a <b>pilot</b> <b>hole</b> was drilled, for the larger diameter borer to follow. This took more than three days to complete. According to Beaconsfield mine manager Matthew Gill, the quartz rock which was drilled through was 5 times harder than concrete. The drill was capable of drilling through it at 1 metre per hour, but it was going much more slowly because {{of the danger of}} further rock falls, at a rate of around 460 millimetres per hour.|$|E
25|$|Conventional {{twist drill}} bits tend to wander when {{presented}} to a flat workpiece. For metalwork, this is countered by drilling a <b>pilot</b> <b>hole</b> with a spotting drill bit. In wood, the lip and spur drill bit is another solution: The {{centre of the}} drill bit is given not the straight chisel of the twist drill bit, but a spur with a sharp point and four sharp corners to cut the wood. The sharp point of the spur simply pushes into the soft wood to keep the drill bit in line.|$|E
25|$|Used an Australian built Strata 950 model {{raise borer}} type {{drilling}} rig {{often used to}} create circular shafts between two levels of a mine without using explosives. Provided by South African mining company Murray & Roberts, the drill had recently finished creating a shaft for Codelco's Andina copper mine in Chile and was immediately transferred to the San José Mine. Since it weighed , the drill had to be shipped in pieces on a large truck convoy. The Strata 950 {{was the first of}} the three drills to begin boring an escape shaft. If the <b>pilot</b> <b>hole</b> had been completed, further drilling would have caused rock debris to fall down the hole, requiring the miners to remove several tons of debris.|$|E
50|$|MDF may be glued, doweled or laminated. Typical {{fasteners}} are T-nuts and pan-head machine screws.

40|$|Self-piloting tools {{feature the}} unique use of two support pads and the {{surrounding}} hole as a guide bushing to steer itself along the hole being machined. The <b>piloting</b> <b>hole,</b> {{in conjunction with the}} two support pads, provides for the tool balance in the hole transverse cross-section. However, in the axial section plane, the tool alignment with the <b>piloting</b> <b>hole</b> depends on the boring bar to which the tool appears as a solid extension. This study shows that the alterations in the output quality and the support pads' wear pattern can be explained by in-process encountered boring bar bending. This is because even minor inclinations near the tool tip appear significant when considered in the small front-end area of the support pads where burnishing occurs. The study is to explain the inherent feature of the conventional self-piloting tool design to deflect the boring bar in 3 D enough to make a difference between the effective area involved in burnishing and the area as designed...|$|R
40|$|A transpedicular {{drill guide}} (TDG) was {{designed}} {{to assist in the}} safe placement of pedicle screws in the thoracic spine. In a preliminary study, <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> were drilled into the pedicles (T 1 to T 12) of eight anatomical models in order to compare the conventional anatomical technique to the TDG. Visual inspection of the drilled pedicles was performed. Subsequently in a cadaveric study, <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> were made using the TDG in the thoracic spine (T 1 to T 11) of one human cadaver before inserting 4. 5 mm diameter screws. CT scan followed by visual inspection of the cadaveric spine was performed to evaluate the position of the screws. With the anatomical models, 19 of 96 (19. 8 %) holes drilled using the TDG and 64 of 96 (66. 7 %) holes drilled using the anatomical technique violated the pedicle wall (p< 0. 001). The TDG reduced the rate of medial perforation. Ninety-nine percent of the <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> made with the TDG were within 2 mm from the pedicle wall compared to 79. 2 % for the anatomical technique. In the cadaveric study, one of the 22 (4. 5 %) screws violated the medial wall of the right T 1 pedicle by less than 1 mm. No screw penetrated the anterior vertebral cortex, nor the lateral, superior or inferior pedicle wall. The TDG is easy to use and can decrease the incidence of misplaced thoracic pedicle screws. The TDG could be used alone as an alternative to navigation systems in certain applications or with fluoroscopy during thoracic pedicle screw placement, especially for training surgeons.

2500|$|When {{drilling}} with {{a hand-held}} drill {{the flexibility of}} the bit is not the primary source of inaccuracy—it is the users hands. [...] Therefore, for such operations, a center punch is often used to spot the hole center prior to drilling a <b>pilot</b> <b>hole.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The {{pocket holes}} require two {{drilling}} operations to be completed. The {{first is to}} counterbore the pocket hole itself, which houses the screw head within the member. This hole is stopped 1/4" [...] (5mm) or so {{from the edge of}} the frame member. The second step is to drill a <b>pilot</b> <b>hole</b> concentric with the pocket hole which extends through the edge of the member. The <b>pilot</b> <b>hole</b> allows the screw to pass through the member and into the adjoining member. This two stage drilling operation may be performed with two different sized drill bits, however there are special stepped bits available to perform the operation in a single pass. The drilling operation is often facilitated by a pocket hole jig which allows the user to drill the pocket hole at the correct angle and to the correct depth.|$|E
2500|$|Operated a {{powerful}} Canadian made RIG-421 oil drilling rig operated by Calgary-based Precision Drilling Corporation. It {{was the last}} drill {{to be added to}} the rescue process and went into operation on 19 September. The rig, normally used for oil and gas well drilling, could theoretically drill a wide enough escape shaft in a single pass without a <b>pilot</b> <b>hole.</b> RIG-421 is a [...] tall Diesel-Electric Triple, which needed 40 truckloads to bring its components from Iquique, Chile, to Copiapó. Chosen for the rescue operation because it can drill large holes deep into the ground and is faster than mining drills, this plan suffered major setbacks due to the difficulty of aiming a large drill at such a small target. Furthermore, the hardness of the rock caused the drill bit to wander from its intended course and it then needed to be removed, resized and repositioned, slowing drilling progress. Many family members of the miners initially had high hopes for this rig, but it was forced to reduce its drill size and so lagged behind the other attempts.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Fixation-based {{surgery is}} a new {{technique}} for achieving difficult corrections in some orthopedic procedures. The method is premised on using a fixation device, such as a fracture-fixation plate, during the alignment and distration phases of an open-wedge osteotomy. The basic idea is similar to assembly of manufactured components: <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> are drilled in the bone fragments, the fixation plate is attached to one fragment and, when the fragment is moved, the alignment has been achieved when the <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> in one fragment line up with predetermined through holes in the fixation plate. The method has been specifically developed to address osteotomy of the distal radius to correct a malunited fracture. The method has been validated in laboratory studies. Clinical trials suggest that the method is no slower than the conventional technique, {{there is almost no}} intraoperative X-ray exposure, and that exceptionally large corrections can easily be achieved. 1 Rationale and Objectives Fractures of the distal radius constitute about 15 % of all fractures seen in the emergenc...|$|R

50|$|When a screw {{is driven}} into a {{material}} without a <b>pilot</b> <b>hole,</b> it {{can act as}} a wedge, generating outward pressure which can cause many materials to split. By drilling a small <b>pilot</b> <b>hole</b> into the material, into which a screw is then driven, less wedging takes place, thereby reducing the likelihood of the material being split.

For standard wood screws, special pilot drill bits are manufactured to produce the correct hole profile in a single operation, rather than needing several different drill bit sizes and depths.|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{investigated}} whether the nonincision placement of miniscrews {{could lead to}} ectopic implantation of epithelium at the bone-implant interface and, if so, whether the epithelial cells could survive. The fate of grafted epithelial cells was also investigated. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Ten healthy male beagle dogs {{were included in the}} study and were divided into three groups. Group 1 dogs (n = 3) were implanted with miniscrews without any other procedures. In group 2, epithelial cells were collected, infected by adeno-associated virus- 2 containing green fluorescent protein (GFP), and injected into <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> drilled before miniscrew implantation in three dogs, and one dog was injected with epithelial cells as a negative control. In group 3, tiny gingival tissue pieces were injected into <b>pilot</b> <b>holes</b> drilled before miniscrew implantation. In group 1, hematoxylin-eosin and fluorescent immunohistochemical (IHC) staining of cytokeratin were performed on both undecalcified and decalcified slices. In groups 2 and 3, IHC staining of cytokeratin and apoptotic testing were performed. RESULTS: No ectopically implanted epithelial cells were found at the bone-implant interface of the miniscrews in group 1. In group 2, fluorescence emitted by cytokeratin antibody and by GFP was observed in specimens at 0 days, had decreased by 3 days, and had disappeared by 7 days. In group 3, areas of fluorescent cytokeratin-positive tissues were much smaller at 7 days than at 0 days, and none were found at 28 days. In groups 2 and 3, there were many apoptotic epithelial cells at the bone-implant interface at 3 days and 7 days, respectively. CONCLUSION: There was little possibility of implantation of epithelium into alveolar bone though placement of miniscrews with a nonincision procedure. Furthermore, even when epithelial cells or tissue was ectopically implanted, it was soon cleared through an apoptotic process. Yang Zhang,Jieli Ni, Roger J. Smales, Junqing Ma, Lin Wan...|$|R
