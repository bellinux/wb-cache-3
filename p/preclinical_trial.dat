50|$|Bretazenil (Ro16-6028) is an imidazopyrrolobenzodiazepine {{anxiolytic}} drug {{which is}} derived from the benzodiazepine family, and was invented in 1988. It is most closely related in structure to the benzodiazepine antagonist flumazenil, although its effects are somewhat different. It is classed as a high-potency benzodiazepine due to its high affinity binding to benzodiazepine binding sites where it acts as a partial agonist. Its profile as a partial agonist and <b>preclinical</b> <b>trial</b> data suggests that it may have a reduced adverse effect profile. In particular bretazenil has been proposed to cause a less strong development of tolerance and withdrawal syndrome. Bretazenil differs from traditional 1,4-benzodiazepines by being a partial agonist and because it binds to α1, α2, α3, α4, α5 and α6 subunit containing GABAA receptor benzodiazepine receptor complexes. 1,4-benzodiazepines bind only to α1, α2, α3 and α5 GABAA benzodiazepine receptor complexes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractCervical cancer ranks third {{among the}} most {{prevalent}} deadly cancer in women worldwide and ranks first in developing countries. It is caused by human papilloma virus (HPV) infection. Thus HDACs have become prominent inhibition target for cervical cancer treatment. In order to discover the new alternative HDAC inhibitors (HDACIs), we conducted a computer-aided drug discovery and development (CADDD) based on de novo approach. The compound library is based on 4 -[(2 -oxo- 1, 3 -thiazolidin- 3 -yl) carbonyl] aniline. Screening of the best drug leads was evaluated from several parameters, such as docking and interaction analysis, pharmacology, in silico <b>preclinical</b> <b>trial</b> and molecular dynamics analysis. The inhibitory activity of these new designed ligands against Homo sapiens class II HDAC was determined by molecular docking simulation. Docking analysis yielded eight best ligands which have better binding affinity than the standards. Therefore, interaction analysis indicated that all best ligands performed coordination with Zn 2 + cofactor in HDAC charge-relay system which are essential for HDAC inhibitory activities of these inhibitors. Pharmacology analysis and preclinical trials of these compounds including pharmacology properties, bioactivity, mutagenicity–carcinogenicity, absorption, distribution, metabolism, excretion and toxicity (ADMET) properties were done through in silico methods. Through this analysis, the best ligands meet Lipinski’s rule of five, have a better drug score than standards, and show good bioactivities, oral bioavailability and ADMET properties. All best ligands also have good synthetic accessibility and were proved to be new compounds {{that have never been}} synthesized before. Stability of HDAC–ligand complexes was also calculated through molecular dynamics (MD) simulation. Based on this simulation, complex of the best ligands with corresponding HDAC has a good stability based on RMSD (root mean square deviation) and interaction analysis. The study thus reveals eight best ligands (F, Ib 14, O 38, Kb 17, Gd 40, Aa 50, Gc 42 and Bb 38) which have better binding affinity against human class II histone deacetylase (HDAC) through molecular docking, dynamics and interaction analysis.

Thanks to cumulative studies on vasculature, new therapeutic approaches have been opened for us to some life-threatening diseases by controlling angiogenesis in the affected organs. In cancer therapy, for example, modulation of factors responsible for tumor angiogenesis may be beneficial in inhibiting of tumor progression.

We report here the results of a <b>preclinical</b> <b>trial</b> using the chimpanzee model to investigate a combination vaccine strategy involving sequential priming immunizations with different serotypes of adenovirus (Ad) /HIV- 1 MNenv/rev recombinants and boosting with an HIV envelope subunit protein, oligomeric HIVSF 162 gp 140 ΔV 2. The immunogenicities of replicating and nonreplicating Ad/HIV- 1 MNenv/rev recombinants were compared. Replicating Ad/HIV recombinants were better at eliciting HIV-specific cellular immune responses and better at priming humoral immunity against HIV than nonreplicating Ad-HIV recombinants carrying the same gene insert. Enhanced cellular immunity was manifested by a greater frequency of HIV envelope-specific gamma interferon-secreting peripheral blood lymphocytes and better priming of T-cell proliferative responses. Enhanced humoral immunity was seen in higher anti-envelope binding and neutralizing antibody titers and better induction of antibody-dependent cellular cytotoxicity. More animals primed with replicating Ad recombinants mounted neutralizing antibodies against heterologous R 5 viruses after one or two booster immunizations with the mismatched oligomeric HIV- 1 SF 162 gp 140 ΔV 2 protein.

The focus {{of this study was to}} determine the influence of sildenafil on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of pregabalin with the objective of informing the design of a quantitative pharmacodynamic (PD) study. Methods. The pharmacokinetics were determined in rats following 2 -hr intravenous infusions of pregabalin at doses of 4 mg/kg/hr and 10 mg/kg/hr with and without a sildenafil bolus (2. 2 mg) and steady state infusion (12 mg/kg/hr for 6 h). This PK model was utilized in a <b>preclinical</b> <b>trial</b> simulation with the aim of selecting the optimal sampling strategy to characterize the PK-PD profile in a future study. Eight logistically feasible PK sampling strategies were simulated in NONMEM and examined through trial simulation techniques. Results. A two-compartment population PK model best described pregabalin pharmacokinetics. Significant model covariates included either a binary effect of sildenafil administration (30. 2 % decrease in clearance) or a concentration-dependent effect due to sildenafil’s active metabolite. Conclusions. Analysis of simulations indicated that three post-PD samples had the best cost/benefit ratio by providing a significant increase in the precision (and minor improvement in bias) of both PK and PD parameters compared with no PK sampling.
