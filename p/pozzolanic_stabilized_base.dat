40|$|AbstractThis study {{evaluates the}} {{modeling}} of different base types under new jointed plain concrete pavements (JPCP) in the AASHTO Pavement ME Design Guide. It {{was found that}} the Pavement ME overestimated the stress in JPCP for unbonded <b>stabilized</b> <b>bases</b> and granular bases and underestimated the stress for bonded <b>stabilized</b> <b>bases</b> when compared to other models. The error in stress estimation results from modeling an unbonded base with a bonded-but-weightless base in the structural model, which is critical when the environmental loading is predominant and/or the base is stiff. Because the separation between layers that are not bonded cannot be accommodated, the behavior of a granular base cannot be accurately reflected, especially not by an elastic continuum...|$|R
40|$|<b>Stabilized</b> <b>bases</b> are {{normally}} {{designed for the}} heavy traffic categories or {{in the absence of}} base materials which should have the required material properties according to the specifications so that the higher strength category can be achieved. Bases can be constructed using soil or aggregates. Those are stabilized with various admixtures such as lime, sand or cement. Among them, cement stabilization is a common practice in road construction industry. The road construction industry has the experiences about the stabilization of dense graded aggregate bases with cement. Even though the content of cement has to be increased to get the higher strength capacity, shrinkage cracks may appear with the increase usage of the cement content and it has a tendency to convert the layer to a rigid pavement too. Hence, another feasible technique should be applied to achieve the required higher strength capacities concurrently to diminish shrinkage cracks and form the base withstand against higher number of heavy load repetitions as well as form the base withstand against higher number of heavy load repetitions without converting the layer into rigid. To achieve both phenomena, this research was carried out to introduce usage of a reinforcement type such as steel fibers in Dense Graded Aggregate bases. In this study, it is discussed about the high performance of Steel Fiber Reinforced Cement <b>Stabilized</b> <b>bases</b> over the conventional Cement <b>Stabilized</b> <b>Bases.</b> Based on the results, a Pavement Design Chart was developed for Steel Fiber Reinforced Cement <b>Stabilized</b> <b>Bases</b> suitable for higher Traffic Classes such as T 7 and T 8.

40|$|Cement {{stabilization}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common techniques for <b>stabilizing</b> recycled road <b>base</b> material, and offers a longer pavement life. With the cement effect, the increase in stiffness of the stabilized layer would provide better load transfer to the pavement foundation. The recycling method provides an environmental friendly option as the existing road base materials will not be removed. This paper presents a case study at a trial section along the North-South Expressway in Malaysia, where the Falling Weight Deflectometer (FWD) was adopted to determine the in situ stiffness of the cement <b>stabilized</b> road <b>base</b> material. The FWD would assess the compressive strength and the material stiffness of the cement stabilized layer. The improvement in the stiffness of the <b>stabilized</b> <b>base</b> layer was monitored, and samples were tested during the trial. FWD was found to be useful for the structural assessment of the cement <b>stabilized</b> <b>base</b> layer prior to the placement of asphalt layers. Results from the FWD were also used to verify the assumed design parameters for the pavement.

40|$|Abstract: Because of {{the high}} {{strength}} and sound stability, the cement <b>stabilized</b> <b>base</b> has been widely used in high grade pavement in China. But shrinkage cracking are easy {{to occur in the}} cement <b>stabilized</b> <b>base.</b> Under the repeating action of traffic loads and temperature loads, this kind of cracks are easy to propagate towards the asphalt surface, being called “reflective crack”. Shrinkage cracks are not normally avertable in the cement <b>stabilized</b> <b>base,</b> in contrast with a few wide cracks of broad spacing, numerous thin cracks of narrow spacing contribute little to the severe reflection cracking. On the basis of this thinking, the pre-cracking technique as a promising approach is brought forward. Several vibratory roller passes to the cement-treated base at a short curing stage, typically 1 to 3 days after placement, to create a fine network of cracks, which avoids the wide and/or long cracks and creates the ideal crack model. Comparing to wide cracking, the degree of the stress concentration resulting from thin cracking is by far mitigated. The Finite Element Method is used to predict the ideal crack model, and then the mechanical responses of the semi-rigid pavement of single wide cracking and net hairline cracking under vehicle loading are numerically simulated, simultaneously compared and analyzed. The simulation analyses indicate that the pre-cracking technique is a very useful tool to mitigate the reflective cracks...|$|R

40|$|Soils {{that can}} be {{stabilized}} are Granular, Sandy, Salty and Clayey materials. In Sri Lanka, lower quality coarse–grained and sandy materials are available which give higher elastic modulus than fine–grained material (Salty and Clayed materials). In order to control shrinkage cracks, Unconfined Compressive Strength (UCS) at seven days should be limited. According to the findings, {{it was revealed that}} the most practical thickness of the cement <b>stabilized</b> <b>base</b> is 200 mm and the most practical UCS at seven days is 3 - 4 MPa to achieve compaction and the decided life with economical pavement thickness. When the strength is measured in terms of CBR (California Bearing Ratio) and UCS, different cement contents arise from these two measuring methods. Therefore this study was performed to identify correct strength measure. The correct strength measure is UCS only and no relationship was found between UCS and CBR. For road pavements with <b>stabilized</b> <b>base,</b> critical tensile stress or strain is located {{at the bottom of the}} stabilized layer. To control the fatigue cracking for required number of axial load repetitions, this tensile stress should be limited. Above mentioned limitations cannot be analyzed using the conventional pavement design based on Structural Number principle. Hence a Mechanistic–Empirical Method is used to analyze pavements with a <b>stabilized</b> <b>base</b> which is difficult to carryout in general practice. Therefore, through this study, pavement design charts for pavements having 200 mm thickness of a Cement <b>Stabilized</b> soil <b>Base</b> (CSB) were developed by a Mechanistic– Empirical Method for various sub grade and traffic classes. According to the developed pavement design chart, it was revealed that CSB can be used for roads with traffic less than 1. 5 x 106 standard axial load repetitions...|$|R

However, in many cases, the RAP is unusable {{because it is not}} uniform (i. e. it may originate from different sources) or the underlying pavement does not provide adequate structural support. One solution to this inadequate support problem is construction of a base with full depth reclamation (FDR) materials stabilized with foamed asphalt.

The pavement industry looks for ways of improving lower quality materials that are readily available for use in roadway construction.

Indian Roads Congress (IRC) developed a Special Publication (SP) for mix design of lime/cement treated base/subgrade. No pavement design guideline is presently available for cement/lime treated base.

30|$|Fly ash {{is one of}} four coal {{combustion}} products (CCPs) that are produced as a by-product of burning coal, two major groups, Class C and Class F fly ash are produced. Burning lignite and subbituminous coal produces Class C fly ash. However, burning anthracite, other known as bituminous coal, produces Class F fly ash [50]. Although there can be multiple variations of the chemical additive, fly ash particles generally consist of hollow spheres of silicon, aluminum, and iron oxides and unoxidized carbon all of which make both classes of fly ash pozzolans-siliceous or siliceous and aluminous materials [50, 51, 52]. It is typically viewed as non-plastic fine silt (ML) when using the Unified Soil Classification System (USCS). Class F fly ash is not used as often because it requires an activator, either lime or cement, to form <b>pozzolanic</b> <b>stabilized</b> mixtures (PSMs) since it is not a self-cementing material [53, 54]. Zulkifley et al. [55] assessed the effect of off-specification fly ash on the engineering properties of tropical soils from Hawaii. They observed that the fly ash reduced the liquid limit and plasticity index, and enhanced the California bearing ratio (CBR) and unconfined compressive strength. Radhakrishnan et al. [56] performed unconfined compressive strength (UCS) and one-dimensional free swell tests on soil–lime mixtures altered with Class F fly ash. Observations showed that lime and fly ash are a good combination for stabilizing silty and sandy soils. It drastically increased the stiffness of the final product. Rupnow et al. [57] used Class C fly ash with lime to develop guidelines for estimating the coefficient of structural layer for the base layer of flexible pavement. The required base layer thickness decreased with the addition of both additives. Fly ash, when mixed with lime, can be used effectively to stabilize most coarse- and medium-grained soils; however, the PI should not be greater than 25. Soils classified by the USCS as SW, SP, SP-SC, SW-SC, SW-SM, GW, GP, GP-GC, GW-GC, GP-GM, GW-GM, GC-GM, and SC-SM can be stabilized with fly ash.|$|R

The momentum generated by dynamic upper body movements can induce instabilities that are often large {{enough to make the}} robot fall down. In this work, we describe a motion controller for a humanoid robot where the upper body is controlled in real time to imitate a human teacher, and the lower body is reactively <b>stabilized</b> <b>based</b> on the current measured state of the robot. Instead of relying on the accuracy of robot dynamics, we use biomechanically motivated push recovery controllers to stabilize the robot against unknown perturbations that include possible impacts. We demonstrate our approach experimentally on a small humanoid robot platform...|$|R
40|$|This {{document}} {{assesses the}} volume of drainable interstitial liquid (DIL) and pumpable liquid remaining in 119 single-shell tanks (SSTs) that were previously <b>stabilized.</b> <b>Based</b> on the methodology and assumptions presented, the DIL exceeded the stabilization criterion of less than 50, 000 gal {{in two of the}} 119 SSTs. Tank 241 -C- 102 had an estimated DIL of 62, 000 gal, and the estimated DIL for tank 241 -BY- 103 was 58, 000 gal. In addition, tanks 241 -BX- 103, 241 -T- 102, and 241 -T- 112 appear to exceed the stabilization criterion of 5, 000 gal supernatant. An assessment of the source of the supernatant in these tanks {{is beyond the scope of}} this document. The actual DIL and pumpable liquid remaining volumes for each tank may vary significantly from estimated volumes as a result of specific tank waste characteristics that are not currently measured or defined. Further refinement to the pumpable liquid and DIL volume estimates may be needed as additional tank waste information is obtained...|$|R
