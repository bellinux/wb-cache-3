50|$|<b>Pimethixene</b> is an {{antihistamine}} and anticholinergic of the thioxanthene {{chemical class}} {{that is often}} used to treat hyperactivity, anxiety, sleep disorders, and allergy. It is also used for anesthesia and as a bronchodilator (to dilate the bronchi and bronchioles for more airflow).|$|E
40|$|International audienceA virtual screening, {{involving}} flexible docking sequences {{within the}} LuxR, TraR and LasR binding sites, {{was used as}} a structural binding sites similarity filter to specifically target conserved residues in the proteins of the LuxR family (namely Tyr 62, Trp 66, Tyr 70, Asp 79, Trp 94 for LuxR). This docking-based screening, employing a genetic algorithm, was performed on a 2344 chemical compounds library, together with empirical binding free energy (DeltaG(bind)) calculations. Docking results were analysed, and the compounds detected with reproducible low DeltaG(bind) values or identified as being in the top 120 for most of the docking sequences, were selected as hits candidates which interact with conserved residues. Biological evaluation with LuxR-dependent quorum sensing led to the discovery of some new inhibitors, namely tamoxifen, sertraline, <b>pimethixene,</b> terfenadine, fendiline and calmidazolium. Notably, calmidazolium was identified {{as one of the most}} potent AHL-structurally unrelated inhibitors of LuxR-dependent quorum sensing, with an IC(50) value of 7. 0 +/- 0. 2 microM...|$|E
