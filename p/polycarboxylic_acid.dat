The crosslinked cellulose-containing materials passed the re-quired flammability standards for carpet when subjected to the methenamine pill test. This test is much less severe than the rigorous vertical flame test method required for textiles designated for other end uses.

30|$|Three {{adsorption}} mechanisms were indicated, which effected the (P)HCA adsorption {{over the}} whole pH range, albeit with different importance: electrostatic interaction as primary mechanism at low pH, hydrophilic interactions, i.e. hydrogen bonding, dominating at intermediate pH, and inner-sphere complex formation, including ternary complex formation, at high pH. Sorption in two stages pointed to the involvement of different sorption sites and different sorption mechanisms. At low pH, sorption behaviour of GLU was {{comparable to that of}} <b>polycarboxylic</b> <b>acids,</b> but the suggested mechanisms were different. In the alkaline pH range, the sorption behaviour of GLU differed from <b>polycarboxylic</b> <b>acids</b> but was similar to that of polyols, suggesting a significant contribution of partially deprotonated hydroxyl groups to the sorption process.
