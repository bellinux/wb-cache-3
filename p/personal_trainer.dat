40|$|The {{following}} phenomenologically oriented {{study examines}} and describes the relevance {{and effectiveness of}} professional development and continuing education programs for real-world situations of <b>personal</b> <b>trainers.</b> The participants were <b>personal</b> <b>trainers,</b> facility managers, and persons involved in the accreditation process.

The first phase consisted of the participants completing the PUMP Questionnaire, followed by focus groups with <b>personal</b> <b>trainers</b> and interviews with managers. The study's 3 data sets required reduction via a content analysis by question, content analysis by existential categories, and further thematic analysis using the lived relation existential dimension. The discussion contains the salient sites and issues of disconnect between clients, <b>personal</b> <b>trainers,</b> and facility managers and how they might affect the personal training experience. The intergenerational disconnect emphasized between Boomers as clients and Millennials as <b>personal</b> <b>trainers</b> requires further exploration and dialogue and underscores the need for different approaches to content and delivery of professional development and continuing education experiences for <b>personal</b> <b>trainers</b> and managers of fitness facilities...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Personal</b> <b>trainers</b> may {{specialize}} {{in a certain}} training type, training philosophy, performance type, exercise modality, or client population. In general, most <b>personal</b> <b>trainers</b> develop exercise prescription plans for aerobic exercise, resistance exercise, and/or flexibility training. With aerobic exercise prescription, <b>personal</b> <b>trainers</b> determine the type of exercise, duration of exercise, and frequency of exercise. For resistance exercise prescription, the type of exercise, total session volume, rest period, frequency, and intensity are determined. [...] <b>Personal</b> <b>trainers</b> may also be involved in prescription of stretching routines or other approaches. While some discuss nutrition, ergogenic supplementation, and spiritual practices with clients, there is debate within the industry {{as to whether it}} fits within their scope of practice and training qualifications.|$|R
50|$|The {{popularity}} of <b>personal</b> <b>trainers</b> {{can be explained}} by the analysis of rule-governed behaviour in terms of evolutionary thinking. From this perspective, <b>personal</b> <b>trainers</b> act as speaker to give rules, while trainees are listeners to follow the rules. Much human behaviour starts out from rule-governed behaviour and switches to long-term control. Whether the trainees will continue the training depends on the reinforcement by following the rule of <b>personal</b> <b>trainers,</b> because being fit and bodily well-being is a long-term contingency of fitness activities.|$|R

40|$|<b>Personal</b> <b>trainers</b> {{are well}} placed to provide {{nutrition}} care {{in line with}} their recommended scope of practice. However, providing nutrition care beyond their recommended scope of practice {{has been identified as}} an industry risk. The International Confederation of Registers for Exercise Professionals (ICREPs) have international standards for nutrition knowledge and skills that are recommended for all fitness professionals, including <b>personal</b> <b>trainers.</b> This study investigates whether the ICREPs standards align with i) national nutrition education standards and ii) national nutrition occupational standards and scopes of practice for <b>personal</b> <b>trainers</b> within ICREPs affiliated countries. Content analysis of each standard and/or scope of practice was undertaken to extract nutrition statements. Extracted statements were matched with nutrition components of the ICREPs standards to result in a score {{based on the number of}} aligned ICREPs knowledge and skills criteria. Ten countries, with 16 organisations, were identified as being involved in the development of national education standards, occupational standards or scopes of practice for <b>personal</b> <b>trainers.</b> The educational and occupational standards varied widely amongst countries and had minimal alignment with the ICREPs standards. As such, the expected role of <b>personal</b> <b>trainers</b> in providing nutrition care appeared to differ between countries. Further work is required to support <b>personal</b> <b>trainers</b> to develop a level of knowledge and skills that enables the provision of safe, consistent and effective nutrition care.

5|$|Unhappy {{with how}} his NHL career ended, Fleury hired a <b>personal</b> <b>trainer</b> in February 2009 and began {{an attempt to}} return to the NHL. By August, he petitioned Commissioner Gary Bettman to lift his suspension. He was {{reinstated}} on September 10 following a meeting with Bettman, Deputy Commissioner Bill Daly and league doctors. Fleury then accepted a try-out offer from the Flames. He said he wanted to prove to himself that he could still play at the NHL level, though his skeptics pointed to his child support payments and the failure of his concrete business, as well as the planned release of his autobiography, and argued Fleury's comeback was financially motivated.|$|E
5|$|Aware of his {{physical}} limitations, Messi employed a <b>personal</b> <b>trainer</b> {{to increase his}} muscle mass, returning to the squad in improved condition {{in time for the}} World Youth Championship, hosted by the Netherlands in June 2005. After he was left out of the starting line-up in their first match against the United States, a 1–0 defeat, the squad's senior players asked manager Francisco Ferraro to let Messi start, as they considered him their best player. After helping the team defeat Egypt and Germany to progress past the group stage, Messi proved decisive in the knockout phase as he scored their equaliser against Colombia, provided a goal and an assist against title favourites Spain, and scored their opening goal against reigning champions Brazil. Ahead of the final, he was awarded the Golden Ball as the best player of the tournament. He scored two penalties in their 2–1 victory over Nigeria, clinching Argentina's fifth championship and finishing the tournament as top scorer with 6 goals. His performances drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who had led Argentina to the title in 1979.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} his military service during the war, Musial returned to baseball in 1946 and resumed his consistent hitting. That year {{he earned his}} second MVP award and third World Series title. His third MVP award came in 1948, when he finished one home run short of winning baseball's Triple Crown. After struggling offensively in 1959, Musial used a <b>personal</b> <b>trainer</b> to help maintain his productivity until he decided to retire in 1963. At {{the time of his}} retirement, he held or shared 17 major league records, 29 National League records, and nine All-Star Game records. Ironically, in 1964, the season following his retirement, the Cardinals went on to defeat the New York Yankees in an epic 7-game clash, for St. Louis' first World Series championship in nearly two decades (a team which included future Hall of Famer Lou Brock performing what would have likely been Musial's left field duties). In addition to overseeing businesses, such as a restaurant both before and after his playing career, Musial served as the Cardinals' general manager in 1967, winning the pennant and World Series, then quitting that position. He also became noted for his harmonica playing, a skill he acquired during his playing career. Known for his modesty and sportsmanship, Musial was selected for the Major League Baseball All-Century Team in 1999. In February 2011, President Barack Obama presented Musial with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, one of the highest civilian awards that can be bestowed on a person by the United States government.|$|E
