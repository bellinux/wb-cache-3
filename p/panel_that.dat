5|$|Along with Oppenheimer, Compton, and Ernest Lawrence, Fermi {{was part}} of the {{scientific}} <b>panel</b> <b>that</b> advised the Interim Committee on target selection. The panel agreed with the committee that atomic bombs would be used without warning against an industrial target. Like others at the Los Alamos Laboratory, Fermi found out about the atomic bombings of Hiroshima and Nagasaki from the public address system in the technical area. Fermi did not believe that atomic bombs would deter nations from starting wars, nor did he think that the time was ripe for world government. He therefore did not join the Association of Los Alamos Scientists.|$|E

50|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{gameplay}} {{is based}} around using manga <b>panels</b> <b>that</b> represent characters to create decks on a four by five grid. Panels come in various shapes and sizes, taking up one to eight blocks. There are three kinds of <b>panels</b> <b>that</b> can be initialized in battle: Battle, Support, and Help panels, with decks needing {{at least one of}} each type and an assigned leader before being playable. Battle panels are four to eight block <b>panels</b> <b>that</b> represent playable characters. They are based on various manga panels and are used to represent what kind of special attacks the characters have. Support panels are two or three block <b>panels</b> <b>that</b> represent non-playable characters that can perform actions such as attacks, healing or status effects. Help panels are one block <b>panels</b> <b>that</b> can give different boosts to characters they are placed next to. Each battle panel comes with a certain nature. These natures (Knowledge, Strength, and Laughter) act in a Rock, Paper, Scissors relationship with Strength beating Knowledge, Knowledge beating Laughter, and Laughter beating Strength. The stronger type will deal more damage to the weaker type. New panels can be unlocked by clearing challenges in Story mode, or evolving existing panels using gems collected in Story Mode to unlock new paths and panels, such as stronger variations of Battle pannels.|$|R
