500|$|Francis Taylor is {{the first}} {{recorded}} fatality at the colliery, killed by a roof fall at [...] "Bradford coal pitt" [...] in 1622. Although the mines were relatively gas-free, there were nevertheless some gas-related incidents. One collier, working {{by the light of}} a candle in 1874, died from burns received in an explosion of firedamp. In 1907 a miner died in a shotfiring incident, when gas exploded as a fuse was lit. In 1924 a number of tubs transporting miners being hauled to the surface derailed and dislodged a <b>pit</b> <b>prop,</b> causing a roof collapse, known locally as a crump; three men were killed and nine injured. The heat from a fire in the main winding engine house in 1953 caused the winding cables to snap, sending two coal-carrying cages crashing {{to the bottom of the}} main shaft and trapping 350men underground. All managed to reach a smaller shaft [...] away and were subsequently brought safely to the surface.|$|E

50|$|John Osborn Williams (28 March 1886 - 6 July 1963) was {{the owner}} of the logging and <b>pit</b> <b>prop</b> {{exporting}} business known as The Labrador Development Company limited based in Port Hope Simpson, Newfoundland and Labrador from 1934-1948.|$|E
5000|$|... "It was logging, however, {{that was}} to be the {{economic}} backbone of Roberts Arm. Between 1930 and 1935 Peter Parsons from Long Island was contracted to produce pit props for the overseas market. The wood was driven via a brook to Tommy's Arm (a shipping depot for <b>pit</b> <b>prop</b> and pulpwood located about three miles outside of the community) and loaded on ships to be taken to its destination. William Faulkner from Point Leamington also produced <b>pit</b> <b>prop,</b> working from Tommy's Arm during the Depression years. Both operations were small scale and short term. By 1935, 45 residents lived in the community. By 1966 there were 978. Mark Rowsell was the local merchant, but many residents traded at Pilley's Island or Little Bay Islands. In 1937 Roberts Arm became a major center for pulpwood. Bowater came to town under the supervision of A. J. Hewlett who was born and raised there. Men from other communities working in Tommy's Arm moved to Roberts Arm with their families. The population was on the rise ... " ...|$|E
5000|$|... 45 {{minutes after}} the initial explosion, at 12:15, a rescue team descended the shaft. Because of the {{firedamp}} they used Spedding mills to light their way. It was noted that the sparks fell [...] "like dark drops of blood" [...] due to the foul air. Having attempted two directions and being forced back by difficulty breathing they retreated to the pit bottom. The party ascended, but while two were still below and two were in the shaft a second explosion occurred. Haswell and H. Anderson were the two left below and they hung onto a <b>pit</b> <b>prop</b> whilst the blast lifted them and turned them.|$|E
50|$|The now {{abandoned}} Soesterberg remained afloat and drifting, as did {{the stricken}} Assyrian. Soesterberg collided with Assyrians stern, then suddenly turned upright. Shortly thereafter Soesterberg sank, spilling her cargo of <b>pit</b> <b>props,</b> several of which fell on survivors of the Assyrian. This wrecked most of their liferafts, but the survivors then clung to the floating <b>pit</b> <b>props</b> as they awaited rescue.|$|R
50|$|Canada {{traditionally}} supplied <b>pit</b> <b>props</b> to the British market. As {{coal mining}} declined in importance and metal supports were used, the term became infrequently used.|$|R
50|$|After the German {{invasion}} of the Netherlands in May 1940 Soesterberg remained in Allied service, making transatlantic crossings between Canada and Britain. In June 1940 she sailed in Convoy OB-174 from Liverpool to Halifax, Nova Scotia. In July she returned from Halifax to Liverpool in Convoy HX-59 with a cargo of <b>pit</b> <b>props.</b> Early in September she sailed with Convoy OA-208 from Methil in Scotland to Halifax. Early in October she sailed from Chatham, New Brunswick, carrying 790 fathom m of <b>pit</b> <b>props</b> bound for Hull. She went via Sydney, Nova Scotia, where she joined Convoy SC-7 bound for Liverpool.|$|R
50|$|During early May 1897, {{dynamite}} {{had been}} used to enable the extension of the workings in the lowest part in order for the working levels to be extended and an inspection of the mine had been undertaken by the Government Inspector, along with the Mine Captain on Friday 7 May, the purpose of which was to ensure there was sufficient ventilation, with their findings being satisfactory. Miners had finished their shift on Saturday 8 May, and the mine was closed the following day, Sunday 9 May. Due to inadequate safety measures a stray candle had been allowed to continue burning which in turn set fire to a nearby <b>pit</b> <b>prop</b> consequently starting a fire in the shaft. The fire would have continued burning so long as oxygen was present, the process forming carbon monoxide which filled the lower parts of the shaft.|$|E
50|$|Kenyon {{was born}} at South Anston, South Yorkshire, the son of Henry Kenyon and Ann Hanson. He had no formal education, {{and went to work}} in a local stone quarry at the age of seven and a half. At 13, he walked to Conisbrough to work in the newly opened Denaby Main pit. At 16, he went to work at Darfield, where he was injured by a falling <b>pit</b> <b>prop.</b> From there, he went to Old Oaks, Barnsley, when it was reopened after the explosions which had killed 361 men. He moved frequently, working at Ashley Deep, Dukinfield; Ince Colliery, Wigan; and Kiveton Park. From 1876 to 1906 he worked at the Shireoaks Company’s Southgate Pit from 1880 as check-weighman, a {{representative}} elected by coal miners to check the findings of the mine owner's weighman where miners were paid by the weight of coal mined.|$|E

50|$|In {{northern}} Seaton Carew in 1949 a large fire {{broke out}} in a timber yard of imported Scandinavian timber intended for making into <b>pit</b> <b>props</b> for the Durham Coalfield.This was similar to an event that occurred in 1922.|$|R

25|$|Only a few tunnels were {{actually}} {{used by the}} Germans: Ho1, Ho4, Ho5, and Ho8; of these, only one was actually completed (Ho5) {{and the others were}} used while partially completed with unfinished galleries being walled off, or left with <b>pit</b> <b>props</b> in place.|$|R

50|$|Amongst {{the goods}} {{delivered}} to Göhrde were food, {{in the form}} of part-piece loads, and artificial fertiliser, briquets and coke, peat, sugar beet scraps and other feedstuffs in full wagon loads. Goods dipatched included eating and seed potatoes, sugar beet, straw, hay, <b>pit</b> <b>props,</b> oak, beech and spruce logs, animals for slaughter and for breeding. Even by imperial times, grain was loaded for dispatch to Berlin. In the 1920s wood for dolphins was delivered from Göhrde to Hamburg Harbour and, in the post-war years, large quantities of <b>pit</b> <b>props</b> were sent to the Ruhr area. Sugar beet was loaded here until the late 1980s. In the last years before the goods facilities were closed logs were the only freight to be loaded at Göhrde.|$|R

50|$|For {{most of its}} life, {{the port}} was most {{associated}} with the shipment of coal, and associated cargoes including the importation of <b>pit</b> <b>props.</b> With the demise the mining industry, the former Timber Pond is now a marina, trading under the name Goole Boathouse. It has berths for 150 boats.|$|R
50|$|His {{judgment}} {{was that the}} government {{went from being a}} supportive partner to being a strict creditor.

50|$|In 1215 {{during the}} First Barons' War, John, King of England laid siege to Rochester Castle.

50|$|There {{were several}} short private lines to mines at Rotowaro, Pukemiro and Glen Afton.
