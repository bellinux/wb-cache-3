The garden collects runoff and is maintained {{without the use of}} gasoline-powered lawn mowers and chemical pesticides or fertilizers.|$|E
5|$|The {{station is}} located in the {{residential}} area of Mortensrud, in Søndre Nordstrand. Mortensrud is an open station without any barriers and free access from the bus stops. The station area is one storey below from the surrounding area. It has step-free access, and at the same level as the buses. Only the western portion of the two side platforms is in use, where direct connection can be made with buses. The station is located adjacent to the shopping center at Mortensrud. The station is designed by Arkitektskap. It is built in concrete, covered in red brick, steel, natural rock and wood, that will allow lianas to grow on them. The roofover the western platform is curved, and made of wood and glass. There is an underground <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>in</b> two levels.|$|E
5|$|At Aliso Beach, {{the mouth}} of Aliso Creek, lies a {{freshwater}} pond that changes frequently in elevation and extent. Tidal activity at the creek's mouth results in sediment building gradually up into a sandbar, impounding it in a small lake about 0.2 miles (0.3km) long at its fullest extent. Afterwards, the water level rises upstream of the sandbar until one of two factors causes it to breach: either waves at high tide wash away {{the top of the}} sandbar, or the lagoon rises enough to overtop the sandbar by itself. Once the water level rises above the sandbar, rapid erosion quickly cuts through the sand and drains the approximately 3–5-foot (0.9–1.5 m)-deep lake in a matter of minutes. Peak flows through the sandbar can reach , even if the incoming flow of the creek is nowhere near that size. Because of the raised flow of the creek and the construction of a <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> <b>in</b> the lagoon area since the 1960s, the lagoon has never been able to fill to its much larger, historic extent without breaching. Species such as the tidewater goby have suffered because of loss of their habitat this way.|$|E

5|$|Like most stadiums {{demolished}} {{during this}} time whose replacements were located nearby (including the Civic Arena over a decade later), the site of Three Rivers Stadium mostly became a parking lot. Much like the Pittsburgh Penguins would do with the site of Civic Arena, the Steelers retained development rights {{to the site of}} Three Rivers, and would later build Stage AE on portions of the site, as well as an office building that hosts the studios for Root Sports Pittsburgh, the headquarters of StarKist Tuna, and the regional headquarters of Del Monte Foods. On December 23, 2012, on the 40th anniversary of the Immaculate Reception, the Steelers unveiled a monument at the exact spot where Franco Harris made the reception in the <b>parking</b> <b>lot.</b> <b>In</b> 2015, the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette moved into a new office building also built on a portion on the site after 53 years in the former Pittsburgh Press building and more than two centuries in Downtown.|$|E

40|$|This study {{examines}} that most bicycle <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> <b>in</b> the center area of Kumamoto city are filled {{early in the}} morning. There are many bicycle <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> <b>in</b> the center city area. Most of them are public. Therefore, a town visitor should use the space with precedence. However, many bicycle <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> become full before stores open, and the town visitor cannot use. This point {{is a big problem}} of the traffic plan of Kumamoto city. The {{purpose of this study is}} to clarify who fills the bicycle <b>parking</b> <b>lots</b> early <b>in</b> the morning and why. The outline of the result is 1. It developed that workers of store, office and city hall parked their bicycle for commuting. 2. This means that a commuter occupies a bicycle <b>parking</b> <b>lot</b> for town visitors illegally. Therefore, it turned out that immediate measures are necessary...|$|R
