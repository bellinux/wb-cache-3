5|$|Insurers {{claimed that}} because {{they have access to}} and collect patient data that allow {{evaluations}} of interventions, they are essential to ACO success. Large insurers formed their own ACOs. Many hospitals merged and purchased physician practices.

5|$|Historian Nancy Bristow {{has argued}} that the pandemic, when {{combined}} with the increasing number of women attending college, contributed to the success of women in the field of nursing. This was {{due in part to the}} failure of medical doctors, who were predominantly men, to contain and prevent the illness. Nursing staff, who were predominantly women, felt more inclined to celebrate the success of their <b>patient</b> <b>care</b> and less inclined to identify the spread of the disease with their own work.|$|E
5|$|In {{developed}} counties, {{training programs}} specifically {{relating to the}} international practice of emergency medicine are now available within many emergency medicine residencies. The curriculum that should be covered by such programs {{has been the subject}} of much discussion. <b>Patient</b> <b>care,</b> medical knowledge, practice-based learning, communication skills, professionalism, and system-based practice are the basic six competencies required of programs approved by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education, but the application of these goals can take many forms.|$|E
5|$|In response, Assistant to the Solicitor General Matthew D. Roberts argued {{on behalf}} of the United States that <b>patient</b> <b>care</b> and not {{educational}} curricula occupies the vast majority of residents' time. He also argued that although the 1939 FICA Amendment had originally specifically exempted interns, residents who had not yet obtained their unrestricted medical license, that exemption was removed in 1965 to allow doctors to begin paying into Social Security earlier so that they could be eligible for certain benefits.|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} {{was carried out}} in Kaduna State, Nigeria to determine whether Nursing Process is used in <b>patients</b> <b>care</b> or not. Utilizing an ex-post facto research design, a multistage sampling technique was used to select 210 nurses from urban and rural based hospitals from the three (3) senatorial districts of Kaduna State. Self-administered questionnaires were used for data collection. About 78 % (163) of the questionnaire was filled and returned. The major findings were that 57. 1 % {{of the respondents indicated that}} Nursing Process is used in <b>patients</b> <b>care</b> in Kaduna state General Hospitals while 14. 1 % revealed that the use of nursing process started and stopped and 25. 8 % indicated that it is not used in <b>patients</b> <b>care.</b> The major factors that militated against the implementation of Nursing Process were identified as shortage of nursing staff (54. 0 %) and insufficient equipment (28. 2 %) for the implementation of Nursing Process in <b>patients</b> <b>care.</b> Three null hypotheses tested at significant level of 0. 05 indicated that, years of experience and qualification does not relate significantly with the implementation of nursing process but rank of nurses relates significantly with the implementation of nursing process. The major opinions advanced by the respondents as a solution to these factors were that more nursing staff should be provided at every duty hours and the provision of basic care equipment for nursing <b>care</b> on <b>patients.</b> It is recommended that Nursing Process forms used in <b>patients</b> <b>care</b> should be adapted rather than adopted to suite the peculiarities of our environment in order to facilitate its full implementation in <b>patients</b> <b>care.</b> KEYWORDS- Evaluation, Nursing process, Nurse Clinician...|$|R
5|$|While {{attempting}} {{to provide a}} high level of <b>patient</b> <b>care</b> for Jews, Christians, and Arabs, Shaare Zedek operated without electricity, indoor plumbing, central heating, or gas cooking stoves. Kerosene heaters were used to warm bathwater, and paraffin lamps were used in the operating room. It was difficult to retain staff due to the working conditions and to the exacting, temperamental nature of Dr. Wallach. Nevertheless, Schwester Selma worked 18-hour days, and expected her nurses and aides to display the same work ethic.|$|E
5|$|By the 1970s, the city's {{economy had}} {{recovered}} after 30 years of economic downturn. A {{large number of}} high rises were constructed in the Financial District and in Boston's Back Bay during this time period. This boom continued into the mid-1980s and resumed after a few pauses. Hospitals such as Massachusetts General Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Brigham and Women's Hospital lead the nation in medical innovation and <b>patient</b> <b>care.</b> Schools such as Boston College, Boston University, the Harvard Medical School, Tufts University School of Medicine, Northeastern University, Wentworth Institute of Technology, Berklee College of Music, and Boston Conservatory attract students to the area. Nevertheless, the city experienced conflict starting in 1974 over desegregation busing, which resulted in unrest and violence around public schools throughout the mid-1970s.|$|E

The year before Arafiles came to Winkler County, the TMB restricted his ability to supervise nurse practitioners and physician assistants for three years and fined him $1,000.

5|$|Physician: Physicians {{involved}} in <b>patient</b> <b>care</b> may include the primary physician, {{who can provide}} valuable information about patient medical history, and physicians connected to the hospice team. These primarily provide support to other hospice team members, but may also treat the patient directly. The physician subspecialty of Hospice and Palliative Medicine was established in 2006, to provide expertise {{in the care of}} patients with life-limiting, advanced disease and catastrophic injury; the relief of distressing symptoms; the coordination of interdisciplinary patient and family-centered care in diverse settings; the use of specialized care systems including hospice; the management of the imminently dying patient; and legal and ethical decision making in end-of-life care.|$|E
5|$|Smith's {{departure}} {{provided for}} a period of expansion, both among the faculty and the student body. Former students of Nathan Smith's replaced him on the faculty, drawing medical professionals in the northeast such as Oliver Wendell Holmes, Sr. to join them. The first hospital at the school was founded by DMS alumnus Dixi Crosby in 1838, who used it to integrate academic instruction with hands-on <b>patient</b> <b>care.</b> In 1870, Carlton Pennington Frost, DMS '57, replaced Crosby as Dean of the school. Under Frost, the curriculum sustained another revamping, this time into a four-year program that included clinical and academic training. Frost also presided over the establishment of Mary Hitchcock Memorial Hospital in 1893, built to replace Crosby's defunct hospital.|$|E
