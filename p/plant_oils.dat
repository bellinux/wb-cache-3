5|$|There {{are several}} types of <b>plant</b> <b>oils,</b> {{distinguished}} by the method used to extract the oil from the plant. The relevant part of the plant may be placed under pressure to extract the oil, giving an expressed (or pressed) oil. The oils included in this list are of this type. Oils may also be extracted from plants by dissolving parts of plants in water or another solvent. The solution may {{be separated from the}} plant material and concentrated, giving an extracted or leached oil. The mixture may also be separated by distilling the oil away from the plant material. Oils extracted by this latter method are called essential oils. Essential oils often have different properties and uses than pressed or leached vegetable oils. Finally, macerated oils are made by infusing parts of plants in a base oil, a process called liquid-liquid extraction.|$|E

The use of <b>plant</b> <b>oil</b> as hydraulic fluid would help to minimize hazardous pollution caused by accidental spillage, lower disposal costs of the used fluid and meet the environmental regulations. This research was conducted to investigate the rheology elements and potential of <b>plant</b> <b>oil</b> in marine application.

The sustainability of the technology is ensured by the establishment of a <b>plant</b> <b>oil</b> production area and oil analysis laboratory at the <b>Plant</b> <b>Oil</b> Technology Center, based at the Department of Agricultural Engineering of the Visayas State University, the Philippines. The <b>plant</b> <b>oil</b> production area is equipped with a high capacity weighing scale, one hammer mill, three oil expellers, one settling tank, one filtering tank, and two storage tanks that can process about 400 − 500 kg of copra daily. Except for the weighing scale and oil expellers, all the equipment were designed and fabricated by the project. Technology for the small-scale production of coconut virgin oil, naturally fermented vinegar from coconut water, and laundry soap from filtered coconut oil were also developed to increase the income potential of coconut farmers. As a showcase of the technology, a village level oil processing centre was established in Barangay Ciabu in Baybay, Leyte, Philippines, in cooperation with the Local Government of Baybay and the Ciabu Primary Purpose Cooperative, a coconut-based cooperative with about 1500 members. The processing centre is provided with processing building, smoke-free copra dryer, and all the needed oil production equipment found in the <b>Plant</b> <b>Oil</b> Technology Center. Using the data available, the economic viability of the technology was determined by conducting a financial feasibility study through the use of the Benefit-Cost Analysis (BCA) framework that gave a net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and benefitcost ratio of PhP 658, 534, 36 %, and 1. 07, respectively, indicating the economic viability of the established coconut oil processing line...|$|R

2500|$|As {{in other}} traditions, chrism is usually olive oil (although other <b>plant</b> <b>oils</b> {{can be used}} in cases when olive oil is unavailable) and is scented with a sweet perfume, usually balsam.

[...] The oil of catechumens and the oil of the sick are usually also consecrated at this liturgy. Practices vary for the blessing of the chrism, from interpolations within the Eucharistic Prayer, to specific prayers of consecration, used at the discretion of the minister. [...] Some Lutheran and Anglican liturgical books, however, make provision for a pastor who is not a bishop (a presbyter) to consecrate chrism in time of need and in the absence of the bishop.|$|E
2500|$|Humans usually become {{infected}} after swimming in lakes or other bodies of slow-moving fresh water. Some laboratory evidence indicates snails shed cercariae most intensely {{in the morning}} and on sunny days, and exposure to water in these conditions may therefore increase risk. Duration of swimming is positively correlated with increased risk of infection in Europe and North America, and shallow inshore waters may harbour higher densities of cercariae than open waters offshore. Onshore winds are thought to cause cercariae to accumulate along shorelines. Studies of infested lakes and outbreaks in Europe and North America have found cases where infection risk appears to be evenly distributed around the margins of water bodies as well as instances where risk increases in endemic swimmer's itch [...] "hotspots". Children may {{become infected}} more frequently and more intensely than adults but this probably reflects their tendency to swim for longer periods inshore, where cercariae also concentrate. Stimuli for cercarial penetration into host skin include unsaturated fatty acids, such as linoleic and linolenic acids. These substances occur naturally in human skin and are found in sun lotions and creams based on <b>plant</b> <b>oils.</b>|$|E
