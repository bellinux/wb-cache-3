5|$|The name also {{occurs in}} the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, s.a. 501, as Bieda, one of {{the sons of the}} Saxon founder of Portsmouth. The Liber Vitae of Durham Cathedral names two priests with this name, one of whom is presumably Bede himself. Some manuscripts of the Life of Cuthbert, one of Bede's works, mention that Cuthbert's own priest was named Bede; it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> priest is the other name listed in the Liber Vitae.|$|E
5|$|According to the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, Ecgfrith only reigned for 141 days. Offa {{is known}} to have died in 796, on either 26 July or 29 July, so Ecgfrith's date of death is either 14 December or 17 December of the same year. Coenwulf succeeded Ecgfrith as king. Coenwulf's father's name was Cuthberht, who may have been the same person as an ealdorman of that name who {{witnessed}} charters during the reign of Offa. Coenwulf is also recorded as witnessing charters during Offa's reign. According to the genealogy of Mercian kings preserved in the Anglian collection Coenwulf was descended from a brother of Penda named Cenwealh, of whom there is no other record. It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> refers to Cenwealh of Wessex, who was married to (and later repudiated) a sister of Penda.|$|E

5|$|By the 18th century, Lajjun was {{replaced}} by Jenin as the administrative capital of the sanjak which now included the Sanjak of Ajlun. By the 19th century it was renamed Sanjak Jenin, although Ajlun was separated from it. Zahir al-Umar, who became the effective ruler of the Galilee {{for a short period}} {{during the second half of}} the 18th century, was reported to have used cannons against Lajjun in the course of his campaign between 1771-1773 to capture Nablus. It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> attack led to the village's decline in the years that followed. By that time, Lajjun's influence was diminished by the increasing strength of Acre's political power and Nablus's economic muscle.|$|E
5|$|Howden's {{account of}} events reveals that Haraldr {{and his family}} gained control of Moray early in 1196, and charter {{evidence}} suggests that William and royal forces were in the north that summer. Although the Chronicle of Melrose appears to indicate that Hvarflǫð and Haraldr's eldest son was defeated in 1197, it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> event dates to 1196 instead and relates to William's aforesaid northern campaign. Fordun's account records that William successfully asserted royal power in the northern regions; and Howden's account species that the king stripped Haraldr of his lordship in Caithness, and handed it over to Haraldr Eiríksson, a claimant to the Orcadian earldom. At some point after this, Howden's account reveals that Haraldr overcame and killed Haraldr Eiríksson, and the Icelandic Annals specifically date the latter's fall to 1198.|$|E

5|$|It {{is not yet}} {{known what}} {{specific}} agent in the body brings about the allergic reaction to the radiation. When patients with SU were injected with an irradiated autologous serum, many developed urticaria within the area of injection. When {{people who did not}} have SU were injected, they did not demonstrate similar symptoms. This indicates that the reaction is only a characteristic of the patients with solar urticaria and that it is not phototoxic. It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> photoallergen is located on the binding sites of IgE that are found on the surface of mast cells. The photoallergen is believed to begin its configuration through the absorption of radiation by a chromophore. The molecule, because of the radiation, is transformed resulting in the formation of a new photoallergen.|$|E
5|$|Massive {{resources}} {{were required to}} construct Castle Rising, which included three baileys with large earthwork defences and a stone keep, with an adjacent deer park just behind the castle. As part of the project, the existing settlement was moved away to the north, where it became a planned settlement adjacent to the new castle. A pre-existing Norman chapel on the site, built around 1100, was encircled by the castle defences, and the new parish church of St Lawrence {{was built in the}} town instead, although it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> church also pre-dates the castle. William received permission from King Stephen to open a mint at the castle in 1145 and, probably linked to this development, settled a community of Jews in the town.|$|E
5|$|The eyes of {{slow lorises}} are forward-facing, which gives stereo vision.

It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> layer blurs the images they see, as the reflected light may interfere with the incoming light. Slow lorises have monochromatic vision, meaning they see in shades of only one color.

5|$|The {{main source}} {{describing}} Daphnomeles's life, {{and indeed the}} Bulgarian campaigns (986–1018) of Emperor Basil II, is the late 11th century Synopsis Historion of John Skylitzes, whose chronology is often problematic to reconstruct. Daphnomeles came from the landed aristocracy of Asia Minor, which for centuries provided the Byzantine military elite. Traditional historiography places his first appearance in circa 1005, when the Adriatic port city of Dyrrhachium {{is said to have}} been surrendered by John Chryselios, a local magnate, to the Byzantines. Daphnomeles, at the head of a fleet, took possession of the city. Given the chronologically unclear narrative of Skylitzes, however, it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> episode reflects his later appointment (after 1018) as strategos (military governor) of the city.|$|E
5|$|The {{theme of}} {{confusion}} appears through the transplantation of characters from one world to another, for example from the characters' childhood culture {{to the one}} imposed upon them as occurs in The Kingdom of This World. Often, the characters find that reality does not lie entirely in either world. It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> theme is well-developed in Alejo Carpentier's work because of the author's own personal experience with cultural transplantation (Carpentier grew up in Havana but later moved to France for six years and travelled extensively).|$|E
5|$|An {{alternate}} hypothesis {{suggested by}} Benoit et al. involves {{some kind of}} sensory organ occupying the maxillary fossa. Uniquely among therapsids, the canal within the maxilla is exposed {{on the back side}} of the maxillary fossa, which implies that the canal, carrying the trigeminal nerve, would probably have extended across the fossa, outside of the outline of the skull. Benoit et al. hypothesized that the fossa may have supported a specialized sensory organ analogous to the pit organ of pit vipers and some other snakes, or alternatively a ganglion of nerve cells. It is also <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> organ functioned as a replacement for the parietal eye in Euchambersia, like the pit organ does in pit vipers. However, such an expanded sensory organ would be unprecedented among tetrapods, and the few other therocephalians that also lack a parietal eye do not have a maxillary fossa either. Thus, Benoit et al. considered the venom hypothesis as being more plausible.|$|E

5|$|Archaeological {{investigation}} of Olmec basalt workshops {{suggest that the}} colossal heads were first roughly shaped using direct percussion to chip away {{both large and small}} flakes of stone. The sculpture was then refined by retouching the surface using hammerstones, which were generally rounded cobbles that could be of the same basalt as the monument itself, although this was not always the case. Abrasives were found in association with workshops at San Lorenzo, indicating their use in the finishing of fine detail. Olmec colossal heads were fashioned as in-the-round monuments with varying levels of relief on the same work; they tended to feature higher relief on the face and lower relief on the earspools and headdresses. Monument20 at San Lorenzo is an extensively damaged throne with a figure emerging from a niche. Its sides were broken away and it was dragged to another location before being abandoned. It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> damage was caused by the initial stages of re-carving the monument into a colossal head but that the work was never completed.|$|E
5|$|As a {{powerful}} long-distance migrant, the nominate subspecies of Pacific swift has occurred as a vagrant far from its normal range. Birds {{have been recorded}} from Brunei, the Maldives, New Zealand and Macquarie Island, {{and there have been}} multiple occurrences in the Seychelles. In the US, this species is casual in the Pribilof and Aleutian Islands; a claimed 2010 sighting from the Yukon will be the first for Canada and the mainland of North America if ratified. In South America, there is a 1959 record from Colombia. There are 13 European records as of 2013, from Denmark (two), Spain, Sweden (four) and the UK (seven). It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> overstates the true number of visiting birds. All the listed countries had a sighting on different dates in the summer of 2013 which could be due to a single wandering bird. The four most recent English records in 2005, 2008, 2011 and 2013 all included sightings at Spurn, East Yorkshire and may refer to one returning individual.|$|E
5|$|In the Bibliotheca, the Arcadian genealogies are {{immediately}} {{followed by the}} Atlantids, and this progression is known to mirror {{the structure of the}} Catalogue because other fragments of the papyrus roll that transmits the Telephus myth cover families of Atlas' daughters: Taygete, Electra, Alcyone, Sterope, Celaeno, Maia and Merope. Maia bore Hermes to Zeus on Mount Cyllene. Taygete also slept with Zeus, becoming the mother of Lacedaemon, through whom much of the Spartan line was traced, including Tyndareos, the father of Helen, and Penelope, the wife of Odysseus. To Zeus yet again Electra bore Dardanus, the progenitor of the Trojan line, and Eetion, who was killed for sleeping with Demeter. Dardanus' sons were Erichthonius and Ilus. Hyrieus and Hyperes were Poseidon's children by Alcyone. Her section included the Ehoie of Hyrieus' daughter Antiope, who bore Amphion and Zethus to Zeus. Hyperes' daughter Arethusa slept with Poseidon and was changed to a spring in Euboea, but not before bearing Abas, the eponym of the Abantes. His line is traced down to Elephenor, leader of the Abantes in the Trojan War. Sterope lay with Ares and bore Oenomaus, but it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> union was delayed to book four as part of the section treating the family of Pelops and Oenomaus' daughter Hippodameia.|$|E

5|$|It is {{not known}} for certain who the {{causeway}} is named after, but the figure was at the latest pre-Renaissance, {{and the majority of}} sources agree that it has its origins in the medieval period or earlier. The name Wade appears {{as one of the most}} common surnames in a 1381 poll tax register from Suffolk, and philologist P H Reaney reports multiple instances of it from the 11th and 12th centuries. The names Wade or Wada were common in pre-medieval English history and historian William Searle records around a dozen historic Wades in his Onomasticon of early Anglo-Saxon names. The earliest figure from the region identified as Wade in extant writings is Duke Wada, a historical personage of Saxon descent who is recorded in 1083 as having been a prominent figure living in the Yorkshire area around 798. It is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> person was either named after—or has been conflated over time with—one of several earlier, mythological figures known as Wade. Chadwick states that it is most probable that the causeway is named directly after a well-known mythological, rather than historical, Wada.|$|E
5|$|One {{specimen}} {{discovered at}} the Cifelli #2 quarry, a right dentary catalogued as CEUM 34447, is unusual {{compared to other}} Eolambia specimens, including both adults and juveniles. While the ratio between the mid-point depth and overall length of the dentaries in other individuals generally ranges from 0.19 to 0.24, the same value in CEUM 34447 is 0.31, making it unusually deep. The dentary also does not deepen substantially at the front end, and thus lacks one of the distinguishing traits of Eolambia dentaries. However, the other distinguishing trait, which is {{the expansion of the}} front end of the coronoid process, is present in the specimen. Although it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> individual represents an unusual Eolambia specimen, McDonald and colleagues cautioned that it may represent a distinct hadrosauroid that differs in the morphology of the dentary from Eolambia (albeit one that is not suggested by any of the other materials at the quarry). Thus, they regarded it as an indeterminate basal hadrosauroid.|$|E
5|$|Shunt surgery, usually {{performed}} by neurosurgeons, involves {{the creation of}} a conduit by which CSF can be drained into another body cavity. The initial procedure is usually a lumboperitoneal (LP) shunt, which connects the subarachnoid space in the lumbar spine with the peritoneal cavity. Generally, a pressure valve is included in the circuit to avoid excessive drainage when the patient is erect. LP shunting provides long-term relief in about half the cases; others require revision of the shunt, often on more than one occasion—usually due to shunt obstruction. If the lumboperitoneal shunt needs repeated revisions, a ventriculoatrial or ventriculoperitoneal shunt may be considered. These shunts are inserted in one of the lateral ventricles of the brain, usually by stereotactic surgery, and then connected either to the right atrium of the heart or the peritoneal cavity, respectively. Given the reduced need for revisions in ventricular shunts, it is <b>possible</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> procedure will become the first-line type of shunt treatment.|$|E
