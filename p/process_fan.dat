40|$|The {{design process}} of modern {{aircraft}} engines extensively {{makes use of}} computational fluid dynamics (CFD). During the design <b>process</b> <b>fan,</b> compressor and turbine stages are typically evaluated using single passage CFD-simulations. For the design of an inlet distortion tolerant fan, the inhomogeneity of the inflow in circumferential direction does not allow the application of periodic boundary conditions and hence single passage simulations. Accordingly transient full annulus simulations have {{to be applied to}} correctly resolve the underlying physical interactions. The associated computation time for such a high fidelity simulation prohibit its application in today’s design procedures. This paper compares the simulation results of the ingestion of a mild and generic fuselage boundary layer of a blended wing body aircraft into an UHBR engine on the basis of four different simulation methods. The four different simulations include: transient full annulus CFD, Harmonic Balance frequency domain based CFD, steady full annulus CFD (Frozen Rotor) and steady single passage CFD for each blade passage. The results of the simulations are assessed using a newly developed stream tube based post-processing procedure. For the ingestion of the fuselage boundary layer the four numerical setups result in different aerodynamic conditions in the fan stage. For different aerodynamic measures different discrepancies are encountered for the different simulation methods. While the Harmonic Balance method can reproduce most features well, the simpler models overestimate the variations in the different flow features...|$|E
40|$|Mixed-phase clouds play an {{important}} role in the earth system. They affect earth radiative balance and the climate (Comstock et al., 2007; Solomon et al., 2007) as well as the formation of precipitation (de Boer et al., 2009; Fan et al., 2011; Lamb and Verlinde, 2011). Within such mixed-phase clouds supercooled water droplets and ice particles are coexisting in the same volume and interact via microphysical processes (Shupe et al., 2008). This processes lead to growing of ice particles via Wegener-Bergeron-Findeisen <b>process</b> (<b>Fan</b> et al., 2011), riming, and/or aggregation (Lamb and Verlinde, 2011). In theory (Fan et al., 2011; Lamb and Verlinde, 2011) and in laboratory experiments (Fukuta and Takahashi, 1999) this processes are well described. Observing such processes within mixed-phase clouds is still a challenge and closely connected to the two phases and their interaction. To measure all the different properties of the hydrometeors nowadays a synergy of different instruments have to be used (de Boer et al., 2011; Shupe et al., 2008; Verlinde et al., 2013). One of the main goals is to get a better understanding of such effects of supercooled water droplets on ice crystals within mixed-phase clouds. A first step is therefore to be able to separate liquid and ice phase within such clouds. To be able to do this for any kind on mixed phase cloud type this paper show the development of a radar-based technique which allow such observations for different cloud types. This technique is also compared with standard ones using a synergy with lidar and/or microwave radiometer. Geoscience & Remote SensingCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

By {{this type of}} monitoring of sound signals, using suitable sensors {{in the vicinity of}} el motor, impellor and slide bearings, gives an opportunity to monitor without any contact i. e. consideration of validity of change of sound signals on machine. This type of monitoring enables, in inexpensive and contactless way, consideration of time period when machines operation is correct. It also enables having a computer diagrams related to operation of these machines what provides consideration of possibilities for improvement of maintenance of these facilities. Also, in this way it is possible to provide continuous monitoring of sound signals and their tracking by computer. This approach and analysis of sound signals and conversion into diagrams can provide timely detection of anomalies in operation of such facilities; results can be compared with other types of diagnostics, feasibility of planned shutdowns as well as inspections, detection and maintenance.

40|$|Fan {{systems are}} {{responsible}} for approximately 10 % of the electricity consumption in industrial and municipal sectors, {{and it has been}} found that there is energy-saving potential in these systems. To this end, variable speed drives (VSDs) are used to enhance the efficiency of fan systems. Usually, fan system operation is optimized based on measurements of the system, but there are seldom readily installed meters in the system {{that can be used for}} the purpose. Thus, sensorless methods are needed for the optimization of fan system operation. In this thesis, methods for the fan operating point estimation with a variable speed drive are studied and discussed. These methods can be used for the energy efficient control of the fan system without additional measurements. The operation of these methods is validated by laboratory measurements and data from an industrial fan system. In addition to their energy consumption, condition monitoring of fan systems is a key issue as fans are an integral part of various production <b>processes.</b> <b>Fan</b> system condition monitoring is usually carried out with vibration measurements, which again increase the system complexity. However, variable speed drives can already be used for pumping system condition monitoring. Therefore, it would add to the usability of a variablespeed- driven fan system if the variable speed drive could be used as a condition monitoring device. In this thesis, sensorless detection methods for three lifetime-reducing phenomena are suggested: these are detection of the fan contamination build-up, the correct rotational direction, and the fan surge. The methods use the variable speed drive monitoring and control options for the detection along with simple signal processing methods, such as power spectrum density estimates. The methods have been validated by laboratory measurements. The key finding of this doctoral thesis is that a variable speed drive can be used on its own as a monitoring and control device for the fan system energy efficiency, and it can also be used in the detection of certain lifetime-reducing phenomena...|$|R

A direct multiple regression analysis indicated that, both for fans and youth players identification with the pre-merger club was the best predictor of identification with the new merger club, followed by the perceived success of the merger. Two other concepts emerged as significant, though modest, predictors of post-merger identification for fans and youth players: the perceived necessity of the merger and their satisfaction with the merger <b>process.</b> For the <b>fans,</b> the perceived continuity/representation of the in-group in the merger group was also a significant predictor.
