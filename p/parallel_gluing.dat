40|$|The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{evaluate}} the preservative treatment effect and the adhesive type in physical-mechanical properties of glue laminated bamboo (GLB) of Dendrocalamus giganteus. Thus, the bamboo stems were treated by immersion method with chemical product (solution of 1 % of active ingredients of copper chrome borate - CCB) and water by 15 days. Before treating the stems, the external and internal parts were removed to obtain the flat strips of bamboo with 4 mm of thickness, 45 cm of length and 5 cm of width. The "Cascophen RS" (resorcinol-formaldehyde) and "Cascorez-extra" (polyvinyl acetate) commercial adhesives were used to bond the flat strips. The resorcinol-formaldehyde adhesive showed superior moisture resistance than polyvinyl resin to GLB, and the samples obtained of pieces treated with CCB were more stable than treated with water. Among the mechanical properties tested, theadhesive factor was significant for the resistance to shear <b>parallel</b> to <b>glue</b> line and the preservative treatment for the rigidity. The interaction of the factors adhesive and treatment was significant for the rigidity, resistance to parallel compression and shear <b>parallel</b> to <b>glue</b> line. The pieces treated with water and adhered with resorcinolformaldehyde presented better results for the rigidity and parallel compression to the fibers and those treated with CCB, for the shear <b>parallel</b> to <b>glue</b> line...|$|R
40|$|In {{this thesis}} {{the design of}} timber {{footbridge}} across river Sava Bohinjka near Bohinjska Bistrica is presented. In the introduction the historical description {{of the development of}} the timber bridges is done, followed by description of the footbridge and its location. Afterwards, materials used on the construction and their material properties are presented. Action on footbridge and their combinations are written in accordance with Eurocod standards. An optimization of the ratio of spans is made to unify bending moments across main beams. Statical and modal analysis is made with computer program Tower 6 to get internal forces of construction, which are used to design sections of main constructional elements and joints between them. The construction contains of two <b>parallel</b> <b>glued</b> laminated timber beams which are straight at endings and curved with radius 180 m in the middle. Glued laminated timber beams are made from timber GL 28 h and are connected with cross-beams made from D 60 quality timber. On the top of crossbeams, secondary longitudinal beams made from glued laminated Gl 28 h timber are laid. Secondary crossbeams made from D 60 quality timber are laid on secondary longitudinal beams. Horizontal stiffness is provided with steel truss located between the crossbeams. All constructional elements are connected with steel plates and different fasteners...|$|R

Prior to the creep test, four-point bending tests were conducted according to Chinese national standard GB/T 17, 657 - 2013 [14]. The loading direction was <b>parallel</b> to <b>glue</b> plane. For each panel, six specimens were tested in bending. The loading details can be seen in Fig.  3. The density of bamboo panels, as well as their bending modulus of rupture (MOR), and modulus of elasticity (MOE) were calculated from the bending test data. The average mechanical properties of the test are given in Table  1. The maximum load was used to determine the applied stress level.|$|R
40|$|Let X be a {{connected}} non-compact 2 -dimensional manifold possibly with boundary and Δ be a foliation on X {{such that}} each leaf ω∈Δ is homeomorphic to R {{and has a}} trivially foliated neighborhood. Such foliations on the plane were studied by W. Kaplan who also gave their topological classification. He proved that the plane splits into a family of open strips foliated by <b>parallel</b> lines and <b>glued</b> along some boundary intervals. However W. Kaplan's construction depends on a choice of those intervals, and a foliation is described in a non-unique way. We propose a canonical cutting by open strips which gives a uniqueness of classifying invariant. We also describe topological types of closures of those strips under additional assumptions on Δ.

40|$|Glued {{laminated}} timber (glulam) is assembled layers of bonded pieces of timber. In Brazil, {{the use of}} native species timber to produce structural elements of glulam does not occur in satisfactory technological conditions. This is because the properties and performance of native species of wood, under various service conditions, are not entirely known. This study aims at determining and to relate the dynamic modulus of elasticity (EMvt) and the static modulus of elasticity (EM), the modulus of rupture (fM), the compression parallel strength (σcp) and the parallel elastic modulus (Ecp), and evaluating {{the performance of the}} native species Cedrinho (Erisma uncinatum Warm.) in the construction of glulam beams. Glulam beams were produced with random and nonrandom distributions of graded pieces of bonded lumber by using adhesives of phenol resorcinol formaldehyde (RFF) and polyurethane (PUR); the intensity of pressures used was 0. 8 MPa and 1. 2 MPa. The evaluation of these glulam beams was also performed using samples of compression <b>parallel</b> to <b>glue</b> lines and delamination. It was found that the EMvt obtained by transverse vibration dynamic testing revealed a correlation coefficient with the EM obtained on static bending test (R 2 = 0. 86) and significance level of 1 % probability (P < 0, 01). Thus, it can observed that the EMvt is a good estimator of EM. It was found that this wood species may be used for glulam, and that the hardwoods species is in strength class C 30...|$|R
40|$|Load bearing {{capacity}} of Glued-in Rods (GiR) is significantly {{influenced by the}} temperature of the adhesive. This paper presents an experimental program for GiR inserted into both laminated and solid timber elements, when subjected to elevated temperatures. Twenty-four specimens with a single 8 mm rod <b>glued</b> <b>parallel</b> to the grain were tested to evaluate the effect of elevated temperatures on GiR performance. To avoid post-curing effects in the adhesive, a constant load was applied to the bar in a pull compression configuration prior to temperature increase. Two types of adhesives were tested, as well as two different shapes for the internal hole surface (cylindrical and threaded), in order to evaluate whether different geometrical properties of the hole could affect the performances of the connection subjected to elevated temperatures. Experimental results show that an increase in {{the temperature of the}} bonding layer causes a significant decrease in the bond shear strength of the adhesive with respect to the cold state (approximately halves when approaching the Heat Deflection). Furthermore the strength of the adhesive at elevated temperature demonstrates a clear dependence on the adhesive type and a negligible dependence on the geometry of the hole...|$|R

40|$|In {{this work}} we {{investigate}} the parallel computation of homology using the Mayer-Vietoris principle. We present a two stage approach for parallelizing persistence. In the first stage, we produce {{a cover of}} the input cell complex by overlapping subspaces. In the second stage, we use this cover to build the Mayer-Vietoris blowup complex, a topological space, which organizes the various subspaces needed for employing the Mayer-Vietoris principle. Next, we compute the homology of each subspace in the blowup complex in <b>parallel</b> and then <b>glue</b> these results together in serial. We show {{how to use the}} persistence algorithm to organize these computations. In the first stage, any algorithm can be used to produce a cover of the input complex. We describe an algorithm for producing a cover of a space with a simple structure and bounded overlap based on graph partitions. Additionally, we present a simplistic model for the problem of finding covers appropriate for parallel algorithms and show that finding such covers is NP-HARD. Finally, we present a second parallel homology algorithm. This algorithm avoids the explicit construction of the blowup complex saving space. We implement our algorithms for multicore computers, and compare them against each other as well as existing serial and parallel algorithms with a suite of experiments. We achieve roughly 8 × speedup of the homology computations on a 10 -dimensional complex with about 46 million simplices using 11 cores...|$|R
30|$|Bamboo {{resources}} {{are rich in}} China due to their fast-growing and renewable characteristics. Due to their high strength-to-weight ratio and clear texture, bamboos are used widely in vernacular architecture; however, in modern buildings, it presents major challenges for bamboo culms’ thin wall and hollow structure as a construction material. To effectively utilize bamboo, it can be processed and reassembled into structure material with high strengths. Bamboo scrimber is an engineering material, where bundles of bamboo fiber are arranged in <b>parallel,</b> with fibers <b>glued</b> to each other using adhesive under a hot press after drying. “Scrimber”, originally proposed by Coleman [1, 2], means numerous wood splinters bonded together. Substantial proportion of splinters comprises a matrix of generally aligned splinters, overcoming the anisotropy of natural lumber. The research of bamboo scrimber is mainly carried out in several Asian countries. In 1980 s, bamboo scrimber {{was developed in the}} laboratory in China. Modulus of rupture (MOR) and modulus of elastic (MOE) of bamboo scrimber were much higher than wood-based panels and ordinary bamboo-based panels [3, 4]. Tensile strength and compression strength parallel to grain of bamboo scrimber (Neosinocalamus affinis) are 248.2 and 129.2  MPa, respectively [5], which are much higher than comparative values of lumber. Although good mechanical properties are found in bamboo scrimber, characteristic value and design value are still not available. Strength models, the theoretical basis for ascertaining characteristic value and design value of structural material, provide a mean for this dilemma. Therefore, our research aims to fill in this gap and provide a theoretical basis for more extensive use of bamboo scrimber products.|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{bleaching}} on the colour and gluing properties of Gigantochloa scortechinii, Dendrocalamus asper and Bambusa vulgaris bamboos were studied. The bamboo strips were bleached with sodium hydroxide (NaOH, 1 % w/v) followed by hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2, 12. 5 % w/v) {{and in a}} mixture of oxalic acid ((COOH) 2. 2 H 2 0, 1 % w/v) and NaOH (0. 5 %, w/v). The bleaching was carried out by cold soaking. The colour changes (ΔE) and whitish value (W) of the strips before and after bleaching process were examined using colour meter and Munsel soil colour chart. The unbleached and bleached strips were <b>glued</b> <b>parallel</b> to each other using phenol formaldehyde adhesive to produce three-ply laminates. The gluing properties were evaluated based on their shear strength and wood failure percentage. The tests were carried out in dry and cyclic boiling conditions (CBR) in accordance with BS 6566 : Part 8 : 1986. Regardless of species, strips that were soaked in NaOH followed by in H 2 O 2 solution had better colour properties than soaking in NaOH + ((COOH) 2. 2 H 2 O). B. vulgaris had the highest ΔE (10. 8 - 24. 5 %) whilst the G. scortechinii had the highest W (64. 6 - 67. 3 %) when bleached with these two processes. Bleaching with oxalic acid did not increase the W of D. asper even though the ΔE was 19. 98 %. The bleaching agents to some extent, reduced the gluing properties of the laminates. The unbleached G. scortechinii had dry shear strength of 4. 60 Nmm - 2 and CBR shear strength of 3. 47 Nmm - 2 whilst D. asper had 4. 40 and 2. 11 Nmm - 2, respectively. Nonetheless, the glue bond quality of the bamboo laminates still meets the minimum standard requirement...|$|R
