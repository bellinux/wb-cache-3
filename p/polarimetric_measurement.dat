40|$|Combining Doppler and polarimetric {{information}} is advantageous for atmospheric studies. On the one hand, Doppler information gives {{insight into the}} microphysical and dynamic properties of radar targets, that is, radial velocity and its variability. The polarization diversity, on the other hand, has a strong link to the microphysical properties of targets such as shape and orientation. <b>Polarimetric</b> <b>measurements,</b> however, have an adverse effect on Doppler processing. Measurements of the complete scattering matrix require at least two pulses and result in {{the reduction of the}} maximum unambiguous Doppler velocity that can lead to Doppler spectrum aliasing. Moreover, dynamic properties of targets, because of the nonsimultaneity of the measurements performed with different polarizations, affect the accuracy of <b>polarimetric</b> radar <b>measurements.</b> A solution to these two problems is given in this paper. It is shown that by applying a relatively simple processing technique the effect of nonsimultaneous <b>polarimetric</b> <b>measurements</b> can be reduced even in the case of strong Doppler spectrum aliasing. This leads to better estimates of the copolar cross-correlation coefficient. Furthermore, this processing results in the maximum unambiguous Doppler velocity as if no <b>polarimetric</b> <b>measurements</b> were performed, with the added advantage of obtaining the actual Doppler velocities. To illustrate the proposed processing technique, precipitation measurements taken with the Delft Atmospheric Research Radar (DARR) are used. 1...|$|R

40|$|Uncertainties in aerosol sources, microphysical properties, {{and global}} {{distributions}} undermine efforts {{to evaluate the}} radiative impacts of atmospheric aerosols. In this work, we investigate the feasibility of using remote <b>polarimetric</b> <b>measurements</b> for constraining aerosol and aerosol precursor emissions {{in light of these}} uncertainties. A model that incorporates a radiative transfer model with forward and adjoint chemical transport models has been applied to quantify the sensitivity of the reflectance at the top of atmosphere over land to aerosol emissions and microphysical properties. A set of simulated satellite observations, one intensity based and one capable of <b>polarimetric</b> <b>measurements,</b> are used to illustrate differences in the assimilation potential between the two. It is found that the sensitivity of the polarized reflectance to aerosol and aerosol precursor emissions tends to be significantly higher than that of the intensity for cases of non-absorbing aerosols. This is true even when the polarimetric sampling scheme is spatially sparser than that of the intensity sampling. This framework allows us to quantify upper limits on the uncertainties in the aerosol microphysical properties for which a 50 % change in aerosol emissions is detectable using these simulated observations. It was found that although typical current remote sensing instrumentation provides retrievals of the refractive index and effective radius with accuracies within acceptable limits to detect a 50 % change in emissions, retrievals of the effective variance contain uncertainties too large to detect these changes in emissions. These results may guide new applications of <b>polarimetric</b> <b>measurements</b> to constrain aerosol sources, and thus reduce uncertainty in our broader understanding of the impacts of aerosols on climate...|$|R
40|$|The Coronal Multichannel Polarimeter (CoMP) {{routinely}} performs coronal <b>polarimetric</b> <b>measurements</b> {{using the}} Fe XIII 10747 $AA$ and 10798 $AA$ lines, which {{are sensitive to}} the coronal magnetic field. However, inverting such <b>polarimetric</b> <b>measurements</b> into magnetic field data is a difficult task because the corona is optically thin at these wavelengths and the observed signal is therefore the integrated emission of all the plasma along the line of sight. To overcome this difficulty, we take on a new approach that combines a parameterized 3 D magnetic field model with forward modeling of the polarization signal. For that purpose, we develop a new, fast and efficient, optimization method for model-data fitting: the Radial-basis-functions Optimization Approximation Method (ROAM). Model-data fitting is achieved by optimizing a user-specified log-likelihood function that quantifies the differences between the observed polarization signal and its synthetic/predicted analogue. Speed and efficiency are obtained by combining sparse evaluation of the magnetic model with radial-basis-function (RBF) decomposition of the log-likelihood function. The RBF decomposition provides an analytical expression for the log-likelihood function that is used to inexpensively estimate the set of parameter values optimizing it. We test and validate ROAM on a synthetic test bed of a coronal magnetic flux rope and show that it performs well with a significantly sparse sample of the parameter space. We conclude that our optimization method is well-suited for fast and efficient model-data fitting and can be exploited for converting coronal <b>polarimetric</b> <b>measurements,</b> such as the ones provided by CoMP, into coronal magnetic field data...|$|R
