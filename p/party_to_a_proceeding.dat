40|$|In {{contemporary}} U.

This purely functionalist conceptualization of attorney bilingualism, however, ignores the surprising ways in which multilingualism can enhance a lawyer 2 ̆ 7 s professional work and can strengthen and reshape relationships among actors in the U. S. legal milieu. Drawing upon research from psychology, linguistics, and other disciplines, this Article advances a theory of the transformative potential of attorney bilingualism. Looking first {{to the development of}} lawyers themselves, the Article posits that attorneys who operate bilingually may, over time, enjoy cognitive advantages such as enhanced creative thinking and problem-solving abilities, a more analytical orientation to language, and greater communicative sensitivity. Moreover, the existence of lawyers who are fully immersed in the bilingual practice of law will transform and invigorate interactions between attorneys and limited English proficient (LEP) clients and, more broadly, among attorneys, the <b>parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> <b>proceeding,</b> and legal decision makers. Although many U. S. lawyers possess non-English language ability, few are equipped with the complement of knowledge, skills, and values needed to utilize that language ability effectively in a professional setting. Therefore, the Article also calls upon the legal profession <b>to</b> adopt <b>a</b> more rigorous approach to bilingual training and instruction and outlines a set of competencies that underlie effective bilingual lawyering. These competencies relate broadly to cross-cultural interactions, knowledge of foreign legal systems, specialized and versatile language ability, and verbal and nonverbal communication skills...|$|R
5000|$|Originally, {{the notion}} of in rem {{jurisdiction}} arose in situations in which property was identified but the owner was unknown.

This last style is awkward because in law, only a person may be <b>a</b> <b>party</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> judicial <b>proceeding</b> - hence the more common in personam style - and a non-person would at least have <b>to</b> have <b>a</b> guardian appointed <b>to</b> represent its interests, or those of the unknown owner.|$|R

In Chee Siok Chin v. Attorney-General (2006), allegations of actual bias were made based on the actions of the judge, Justice Belinda Ang. Her failure to prevent the opposing counsel from interrupting the appellant was supposedly reflective of a biased state of mind. Justice Ang adopted the view in Locabail (UK) Ltd. v. Bayfield Properties Ltd. (1999) that cases of actual bias are rare due to the difficulty of proving the existence of a prejudiced judicial mindset. Rather, the inclination of the law [...] "is to protect litigants who can discharge the lesser burden of showing a real danger of bias without requiring them to show that such bias actually exists".|$|R

40|$|When justice goes wrong, grave {{consequences}} entail. They are {{damaging to}} the standing {{of the legal system}} and people’s lives. Humans are not good at assessing uncertainties. <b>Parties</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> legal <b>proceeding</b> adduce evidence to support or reject hypotheses. Errors happen when the tribunal fails to consider properly all the evidence in the context of inherent probabilities or improbabilities. This research work does not advocate trials by mathematics or statistics. This work extends the understanding of the application of Bayesian Networks in the law domain. The original contribution to knowledge is the analysis of evidence by Bayesian Network in the context of specific legal requirements of Hong Kong. The research questions are: 1. What are the legal requirements for the analysis of evidence in a criminal trial in Hong Kong? 2. How can a Bayesian Network be constructed for the purpose of such analysis? 3. Is such a Bayesian Network effective for the analysis? In answering the questions, this research work examined the feasibility of generic models created for digital crime scene investigations and concluded that each case must be, for the purpose of analysis of evidence in the trial, represented by a different Bayesian Network. This research work examined the trial processes, the tasks of tribunal of facts of criminal trials and some appellate decisions in Hong Kong. The work also created models of reasoning processes for the juries in Hong Kong. The work then compared the properties of Bayesian Networks with the processes of evaluation of evidence during trials. This research work also considered the reluctance of courts in the United Kingdom to allow experts to express their opinions on the bases of Bayesian calculations; even though trials are practically evaluations of uncertainties and assignments of degrees of beliefs. This research work then constructed a schedule of levels of proof and proposed <b>a</b> schematic method, <b>to</b> be used with the schedule, to construct Bayesian Networks for any types of trial in Hong Kong. The method requires <b>an</b> analyst <b>to</b> go through <b>a</b> mass of evidence systematically, and analyse their relationships amongst the ultimate probandum, the penultimate probanda, the intermediate propositions, the facts in issue and the facts relevant to the issue. This work then demonstrated the applications by two criminal cases in Hong Kong. The analyses show that the construction of Bayesian Network by the schematic method enables <b>an</b> analyst <b>to</b> take precaution <b>to</b> reach <b>an</b> assessment rationally and to approximate as far as capable his or her belief to the facts in issue. published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
