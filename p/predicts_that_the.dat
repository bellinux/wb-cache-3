5|$|Northern mockingbirds {{adjust the}} sex ratio of their {{offspring}} {{according to the}} food availability and population density. Male offspring usually require more parental investment. There is therefore a bias for bearing the costlier sex {{at the beginning of}} a breeding season when the food is abundant. Local resource competition <b>predicts</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> parents have to share the resources with offspring that remain at the natal site after maturation. In passerine birds, like the northern mockingbird, females are more likely to disperse than males. Hence, it is adaptive to produce more dispersive sex than philopatric sex when the population density is high and the competition for local resources is intense. Since northern mockingbirds are abundant in urban environments, it is possible that the pollution and contamination in cities might affect sexual hormones and therefore play a role in offspring sex ratio.|$|E

5|$|The {{discovery}} of Saadanius provides new evidence for competing hypotheses about the facial {{appearance of the}} ancestral crown catarrhines, or common ancestor. One reconstruction is based on living catarrhine traits and predicts a short face and a rounded braincase, {{similar to that of}} a gibbon. Another reconstruction, based on the morphology of early Miocene apes and the basal cercopithecoid Victoriapithecus, <b>predicts</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> last common ancestor had a projecting snout and tall face, like that of living baboons and the oldest fossil apes and Old World monkeys. The conservative features of Saadanius, {{similar to those of the}} older stem catarrhines, support the latter hypothesis, according to Zalmout et al. However, one palaeontologist, Eric Delson, has cautioned that geological pressure may have distorted the shape of the skull.|$|E
5|$|The {{growth rate}} hypothesis, {{also known as}} the {{resource}} availability hypothesis, states that defense strategies are determined by the inherent growth rate of the plant, which is in turn determined by the resources available to the plant. A major assumption is that available resources are the limiting factor in determining the maximum growth rate of a plant species. This model <b>predicts</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> level of defense investment will increase as the potential of growth decreases. Additionally, plants in resource-poor areas, with inherently slow-growth rates, tend to have long-lived leaves and twigs, and the loss of plant appendages may result in a loss of scarce and valuable nutrients.|$|E
5|$|In the South Indian {{kingdom of}} Cholapuram Paalayam {{in the year}} 1771, Raja Mokkaiyappar and his queen, Rajamatha Bhavani Ammaiyar are desperate for a child, as all their {{previous}} twenty-two children have died at birth. Unknown to them, Bhavani's brother, Sangilimayan, {{who is also the}} Rajaguru (High priest), is {{responsible for the death of}} their children. Sangilimayan is shocked to see that his sister has given birth to twins. Before informing the king about the birth, he calls the palace astrologer, Chinnavadayaan, who <b>predicts</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> elder twin will be incapable of making decisions on his own while the younger one will be smarter. Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor, Kailasakaruppan, to kill the younger one, but Chinnavadayaan tells Sangilimayan that his actions would not be good for the kingdom. Instead, Sangilimayan orders the palace doctor to abandon the child in a nearby river. The elder child is named Pulikecei XXIII. Maragathavalli, Kailasakaruppan's childless wife, rescues the abandoned child from the river, and the couple decides to raise him as their own, naming him Ukraputhan.|$|E

5|$|Support for airport {{expansion}} {{is based on}} an economic case that regards the air transport industry not only as an important industry in its own right, but also as a facilitator of growth for the economy as a whole. One study <b>predicts</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> government's strategy will realise an additional £13billion per annum in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by 2030. Another study which is critical of the government approach, and which favours addressing environmental impacts through increased taxation of air transport, indicates a negative economic benefit resulting from airport expansion. In 2006 the industry was responsible for over 6 per cent of all UK carbon emissions, a figure that is set to rise as demand increases. Under current strategies of emissions reduction and growth in air transport, air travel in the UK could account for up to 50 per cent of the UK carbon budget by 2050. Industry attempts to address this issue are longer term efforts based on technological and operational improvements, whilst government policy is based on the inclusion of air transport within emissions trading schemes. Critics advocate a shift in government policy to address environmental impacts by constraining the growth in demand for air travel, primarily through the use of economic instruments to price air travel less attractively. Local environmental issues include noise and air quality, and the impact of these, particularly {{in the case of the}} former, is subject to debate. Government policy generally is that these are local issues best addressed locally, and has introduced legislation designed to facilitate this.|$|E
