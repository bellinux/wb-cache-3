5|$|London {{is home to}} the Grand Theatre, a {{professional}} <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch</b> theatre located in Central London. The building underwent renovations in 1975 to restore the stage's <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch</b> and to add a secondary performance space. The architectural firm responsible for the re-design was awarded a Governor General's award in 1978 for their work on the venue. In addition to professional productions, the Grand Theatre also hosts the High School Project, a program unique to North America that provides high school students an opportunity to work with professional directors, choreographers, musical directors, and stage managers. The Palace Theatre, located in Old East Village, originally opened as a silent movie theatre in 1929 and was converted to a live theatre venue in 1991. It is currently the home of the London Community Players, and as of 2016 is undergoing extensive historical restoration. The Original Kids Theatre Company, a nonprofit charitable youth organisation, currently puts on productions at the Spriet Family Theatre in the Covent Garden Market.|$|E
5|$|Founded in 1877, Tyldesley Good Templars Band was the town's first brass band. Tyldesley Band is {{a member}} of the North West Brass Band Association and meets in the chapel on Milk Street. Tyldesley Little Theatre in Lemon Street is home to an amateur {{dramatic}} society, members of the Greater Manchester Drama Federation. The auditorium is a small 150-seat theatre with a traditional <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch</b> stage, stalls and balcony seating. The town's industrial landscape was recorded in the 1960s and 1970s in the paintings and prints of artist Roger Hampson.|$|E
5|$|The dragon motif is {{repeated}} in the radial coffers of the caisson and the timbered coffers throughout the theatre. The Imperial dragon is accompanied by {{the symbol of the}} Empress, the Chinese phoenix (Fèng huáng), sometimes called Ho-Ho or Ho-Oh Bird from the Japanese. This personal symbol of the Empress is also repeated throughout the theatre, but most prominently in relief as part of the grills above false balconies that once screened organ pipes. In addition to these symbols, orange blossoms, chrysanthemums, and lotus flowers appear throughout the theatre. The highly decorated <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch</b> and safety curtain maintain the Chinese design influence.|$|E
50|$|In {{some older}} music theatres, though, {{it may be}} {{difficult}} to make permanent architectural modifications, because the theatre has been designated a historical site. While this may make the removal of <b>proscenium</b> <b>arches</b> or wood panelling impossible, the use of semi-permanent additions (e.g., acrylic glass) may still be permitted.|$|R
50|$|Set on 115 acre of grounds, {{the house}} {{contains}} 32 rooms on 3 stories. Its facade is built of English brick and French marble in a fanciful architecture with 19 <b>proscenium</b> <b>arches,</b> 84 stained glass windows, 2 turrets, parapet, and balcony. Its interior includes 13 fireplaces finished with imported tiles and bronze. Furnishings include Asian and European antiques, statuary, Chinese scrolls, and oriental rugs. The property {{also has a}} large orangery (greenhouse or conservatory) and an aviary.|$|R
5000|$|Until 2nd April 2017 It {{was part}} of the Blaenau Gwent Venues which also {{includes}} The Market Hall Cinema, Metropole Theatre and formerly Abertillery Community Theatre. It has been taken over as of 3rd of April 2017 by a community group, the theatre is still for hire to amateur groups for productions etc. It has a 338-seater auditorium and also has a Ballroom. It has a <b>proscenium</b> <b>arched</b> stage with an apron. The stage has some flying available, with 12 hemp sets, maximum flown height is 16ft. Lighting Bars can be lowered via a winch over stage, Front of House bars are fixed to the ceilings and walls.|$|R
25|$|The Playhouse (known as Ford Theatre until 2011): 797 seat <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch</b> theatre with dress {{circle and}} fly tower.|$|E
25|$|Named after Oliver Lyttelton, the National Theatre's first board chairman, {{it has a}} <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch</b> {{design and}} can {{accommodate}} an audience of 890.|$|E
25|$|The scenic {{stage was}} {{probably}} some 50’ deep and 30’ high. The <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch</b> {{may have been}} some 30’ wide and at least 25’ high to accommodate the scenery in operas such as Dioclesian, The Fairy-Queen, or The World in the Moon. Both the forestage and the scenic stage were raked. The music box above the <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch</b> could hold perhaps 8 to 10 musicians, to provide incidental music. A full orchestra would be sitting in the pit, {{just in front of the}} stage.|$|E
25|$|Following {{nearly a}} decade of campaigning by residents, in 1995, Frankston City Council opened a A$18.5million arts centre. Originally named the Frankston Cultural Centre, it houses an 800-seat theatre with the second largest <b>proscenium</b> <b>arched</b> stage in Victoria. It also houses the Frankston Library, {{exhibition}} spaces, and a 500-seat function hall. Designed by architect Daryl Jackson, and located {{on the corner of}} Davey Street and Young Street in the Frankston CBD, it was opened on 20 May by then Prime Minister of Australia the Hon. Paul Keating. A flexible 194-seat theatre named Cube37 with studios and a wet workshop was also built adjoining the northeast corner of the centre in 2001, and was opened on 30 March by then Prime Minister of Australia the Hon. John Howard. Now named the Frankston Arts Centre, it serves over 250,000 patrons annually.|$|R
5000|$|His best-known work, The Theatre and Its Double, was {{published}} in 1938. This book contained the two manifestos of the Theatre of Cruelty. There, [...] "he proposed a theatre that was in effect a return to magic and ritual and he sought {{to create a new}} theatrical language of totem and gesture - a language of space devoid of dialogue that would appeal to all the senses." [...] "Words say little to the mind," [...] Artaud wrote, [...] "compared to space thundering with images and crammed with sounds." [...] He proposed [...] "a theatre in which violent physical images crush and hypnotize the sensibility of the spectator seized by the theatre as by a whirlwind of higher forces." [...] He considered formal theatres with their <b>proscenium</b> <b>arches</b> and playwrights with their scripts [...] "a hindrance to the magic of genuine ritual." ...|$|R
2500|$|The Frankston Arts Centre is {{the largest}} art centre in Frankston and on the Mornington Peninsula, {{as well as one}} of the largest in the {{metropolitan}} area of Melbourne, which is owned by Frankston City Council. Located on the corner of Davey Street and Young Street in the Frankston Central Business District (CBD), and designed by architect Daryl Jackson, it opened in 1995. It houses an 800-seat theatre with the second largest <b>proscenium</b> <b>arched</b> stage in Victoria. Along with its 194-seat flexible theatre named Cube37, it also houses exhibition space, a studio and workshop and a 500-seat function hall. It plays host to [...] both state and national performing arts companies including regular shows by the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra and Victorian Opera and as a tour venue for the Australian Opera, Bell Shakespeare Company, Melbourne International Film Festival, Sydney Dance Company, and a number of other major production companies. It serves over 250,000 patrons annually.|$|R
25|$|The theater {{features}} a complete orchestra and balcony section, {{with the private}} booths featuring round openings separated by Doric posts with Adamesque detail. The <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch</b> also includes heavy classical detailing.|$|E
25|$|The {{auditorium}} {{was designed}} in the style typical of the period with a curved and banded ceiling and <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch.</b> Seating was provided for 900 on a single floor. During {{the first part of}} its life the cinema had its own Premier Orchestra which played during all films.|$|E
25|$|ESA's Nancy Main Auditorium, {{which is}} named after the {{founding}} principal, is a 571-seat <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch</b> style theatre {{that serves as the}} primary performing venue. The Nancy Main is updated regularly and provides students with performing opportunities and the chance to learn about technical production. ESA has on staff a professional theatre technician who oversees all productions at the school.|$|E
50|$|An {{image of}} Nike, winged goddess of victory, from an Attic vase of the 6th century BC (see gallery), {{shows how the}} {{sacrificial}} offering alluded to by the voluted altar and flame, {{the wings of the}} goddess and the victory being celebrated, all resonate with the same multiple underlying associations carried within the component forms of the palmette motif. Similar forms are found in the hovering winged disc and sacred trees of Mesopotamia, the caduceus wand of Hermes, the ubiquitous scrolled scallop shells in the canopy of the renaissance sculptural niche, originating in Greek and Roman sarcophagi, echoed above theatrical <b>proscenium</b> <b>arches</b> and on the doors, windows, wrought iron gates and balconies of palaces and grand houses; the shell-like fanlight over the door in Georgian and similar urban architecture, the 'gul' and 'boteh' motifs of Central Asian carpets and textiles, the trident of Neptune/Poseidon, both the trident and lingam of Shiva, the 'bai sema' lotus-petal-shaped boundary markers of the Thai inner-temple, Vishnu's mount, Garuda, the vajra thunderbolt, diamond mace or enlightenment jewel-in-the-lotus of Tibet and South-East Asia, the symmetrically scrolled cloud and bat motifs and the similarly scrolled ruyi or ju-i scepter and lingzhi or fungus of longevity of the Chinese tradition. Both as a form of the lotus rising from the swamps to touch the sun and as a (palm) tree reaching from earth to heaven, the palmette carries the characteristics of the axis mundi or world tree. The fleur de lis, which became a potent and enigmatic emblem of the divine right of kings, said to have been bestowed on early French kings by an angel, evolved in Egypt and Mesopotamia as a variant of the palmette.|$|R
5000|$|The {{stage is}} {{proscenium}} style, with [...] "a series of receding <b>proscenium</b> <b>arches</b> {{as if the}} Berkshire home were itself a stage," [...] all which help to create the visual effect of actually looking in on [...] "Amy's View". [...] "The curtain pulls up and opens like an ever-widening camera lens," [...] which is an interesting concept, as the play is metaphorically a [...] "series of snapshots from a woman's life." [...] The set is repeatedly described as being [...] "cozy", which helps the audience feel {{at home with the}} characters, while the distance of the actual stage still allows viewers see the performance through an outside perspective. However, as the play takes place over a period of sixteen years, there is a challenge when attempting to show the passage of time. Crowley flawlessly tackles the issue by putting [...] "us in a deceptively basic, wide rectangular sitting-room set in which only the slipcovers change through the years." [...] Set, and especially lighting, also play a large role in creating the atmosphere of the play. The casual set gives us a sense of the everyday human nature presented in the play, but the increasingly sharper and dark-contrast lighting gives us the additional sense of [...] "passage of time and the end of innocence." [...] This is most certainly important in the transition from Act 3 to Act 4, where we move from Esme's home to the dressing room of her current theater production. The mood here is much more urban and almost sends us [...] "into another genre, the backstage drama" [...] simply through altering visuals.|$|R
50|$|The theatre was {{designed}} by self-taught Ironwood architect Albert Nelson and was constructed in 1928 {{at a cost of}} $160,000 (equivalent of approximately $2 million today). The architecture was modeled after the Italian Renaissance style featuring hand-sculpted faux pillars and <b>arched</b> <b>proscenium</b> style stage. The building seated 1,000 guests when it was originally built including 600 seats on the main floor and 400 seats on the balcony level.|$|R
25|$|The theatre {{incorporated}} several cooling features. Four small waterfalls {{were located}} {{on either side}} of the <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch,</b> intended to cool the audience in tandem with electric fans and a retractable dome in the ceiling. The dome was split down the middle, with each half sliding to either side to open. The dome was decorated in imitation of an umbrella, with panels of gold and silver with scrollwork embellishment. The artificial waterfalls were removed early in the life of the theatre.|$|E
25|$|In the 1980s, supertitles (sometimes called surtitles) {{began to}} appear. Although supertitles were first almost universally {{condemned}} as a distraction, today many opera houses provide either supertitles, generally projected above the theatre's <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch,</b> or individual seat screens where spectators {{can choose from}} more than one language. TV broadcasts typically include subtitles even if intended for an audience who knows well the language (for example, a RAI broadcast of an Italian opera). These subtitles target not only the hard of hearing but the audience generally, since a sung discourse is much harder to understand than a spoken one—even in the ears of native speakers. Subtitles in one or more languages have become standard in opera broadcasts, simulcasts, and DVD editions.|$|E
25|$|The tower levels (L1 - L9) each {{comprise}} long, {{open floor}} plans with later lightweight partitions. Window sills are black terrazzo. Small services cores bookend each floor, {{on the east}} and west sides of the tower. These contain fire stairs, service risers, store rooms, and kitchenettes. Some levels retain original black bean veneer fire doors. The top level of the tower (L10) contains two large auditoriums. The larger of the two, named the Charles Barton Auditorium, is double-height and has a raised stage with a <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch,</b> velvet curtains, wings spaces either side, and a backstage area with changing rooms. Under the stage is a storage area accessed via original, battened timber doors. The auditoriums are serviced by a single projection room on a mezzanine between the rooms, accessed via a narrow timber stair.|$|E
5000|$|The stage, at 30 {{feet wide}} by 50 feet deep, could {{accommodate}} the largest, most lavish shows from New York. Under the 35-foot high <b>arched</b> <b>proscenium</b> an ornate painted border featured the [...] "Lady." [...] The {{image of the}} [...] "Lady" [...] eventually became {{the symbol of the}} Opera House, and in the 21st century, the Grand Opera House is often referred to affectionately as [...] "The Lady." ...|$|R
5000|$|The {{stage is}} {{underneath}} a <b>proscenium</b> style <b>arch.</b> The outside {{walls of the}} building are brick with cement plaster finish in imitation of Indiana limestone. The interior walls are brick, reinforced concrete or metal lath and plaster. The structural parts of the roof and balcony are reinforced concrete. The arena's hardwood floors are white maple over concrete sub-floor, and the roof is of [...] "Armso" [...] iron over felt. [...] The Auditorium hosted the Big West Conference men's basketball tournament in 1976 and was home of the University Pacific Tigers men's basketball until 1982, the year the Alex G. Spanos Center opened. (The Spanos Center has since been succeeded by Stockton Arena as Stockton's premiere indoor venue) The facility has hosted numerous concerts over the years including Carlos Santana, Rush, and Blue Oyster Cult.|$|R
50|$|The public hall is an {{elevated}} timber {{building with a}} gabled roof clad with corrugated iron. The building is clad externally with horizontal weatherboard. The western facade, facing the street, is lined with a verandah awning supported on simple stop chamfered columns. Between the columns is weatherboard panel balustrade which conceals timber stairs recessed in the verandah space. A large double timber boarded door, surrounded by lights and flanked by sash windows, is centrally located on this face {{of the building and}} provides access to a hall. The hall is lined on the southern side with an infilled verandah, and is lined internally with timber boarding and fibrous cement sheeting. At the front, eastern end of the hall is {{an elevated}} stage area, divided from the body of the hall by a timber <b>arched</b> <b>proscenium.</b>|$|R
25|$|After {{his plan}} to develop an {{entertainment}} complex on East Washington Avenue fell through, restaurateur Nick Schiavo purchased the Majestic from Fritz for $718,000, contingent {{on his ability to}} secure the site's first liquor license. Schiavo, whose family owned Cafe Continental across the street and had owned local restaurants and bars for generations, planned to convert the theater into a combination music club and banquet facility that retained the ability to screen films. Over $300,000 was spent installing an elevated dance floor, industrial-styled mezzanine and two bars, one of them above the stage. Flashing lights were installed in the ornate gold <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch</b> and the DJ booth was the theater's original art deco concessions stand. With a capacity of 472 making it the second largest dance club in Madison, the new Club Majestic opened in February 2003 with longtime Madison DJ Nick Nice providing the music.|$|E
25|$|The Theatre Royal {{went dark}} on 14 March 2011 {{due to a}} major {{restoration}} of the auditorium, box office, bars and restaurant. The restoration restored the theatre to the original 1901 Frank Matcham Edwardian interior. The whole interior was stripped apart from the original plasterwork which was carefully preserved. The <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch,</b> tiers and boxes were gold leafed and the plasterwork restored. On all levels the seats were replaced with Edwardian-style theatre seats {{in keeping with the}} restoration. The amphitheatre which was removed during previous renovations was restored to offer more leg room and better views than the gallery. This took the theatre to five distinct seating areas, the stalls, grand circle, upper circle, amphitheatre and gallery. Wheelchair spaces were installed on levels which had previously been inaccessible. As well as the boxes near the stage, boxes {{at the rear of the}} grand and upper circles were also restored taking the total number of boxes up to ten. The stage lift and orchestra pit were replaced to offer better facilities for opera and musicals. A new ventilation system was put in place to improve comfort levels in the theatre. New frescos for the lobby and upper circle were commissioned and put in place. This £4.75m project introduced higher standards of comfort and improved energy. The Theatre Royal reopened on 12 September 2011 with Alan Bennett’s epic period drama The Madness of George III; George III was in fact the monarch who gave the Theatre Royal its charter.|$|E
25|$|An earlier theatre {{burned down}} in 1906, the {{replacement}} theatre is basically intact today. The interior, with restrained ornament {{in what was}} described as Italian Renaissance style, consisted of a pit (with separate entrance) now seated and a single balcony, returned to the proscenium wall and divided into three areas: grand, upper and back circle. The <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch</b> is almost square with a central cartouche containing a female mask. In the ceiling is a round saucer dome with four relief plaster leaf scrolls and four smaller swags dividing the dome. The whole {{is surrounded by a}} moulded cornice. In the main part, above the stalls, there is an octagonal raised cornice. The balcony, supported on plain columns, has a panelled front with rich plaster scrolls. The walls at both levels are simply decorated with panels. The balcony is now divided into two areas separated by a barrier approximately two feet high. The disused entrance on the Esplanade (dated 1907) is in three bays, modestly detailed in classical style with a segmental pediment over the centre. The two entrance doors set in a projecting enclosed porch under a curved-fronted balcony supported on consoles.The entrance on South Marine Drive gives access to a good sized foyer nearly at circle level with the former main entrance on the Esplanade at stalls/pit level. In January 1932 the adjacent Royal Hall was gutted by fire. The Spa Theatre suffered minor smoke and water damage. An insurance settlement allowed rapid repair and full redecoration, the theatre reopening at Easter 1932. It remained open whilst the Royal Hall was reconstructed.|$|E
500|$|In February 1999, {{the city}} {{announced}} it was negotiating with Gehry to design a <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch</b> and orchestra enclosure for a bandshell in the new park, {{as well as a}} pedestrian bridge over Columbus Drive (which became BP Pedestrian Bridge). The city sought donors to cover Gehry's work, and the Chicago Tribune dubbed him [...] "the hottest architect in the universe" [...] for his acclaimed Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. The Tribune noted Gehry's designs would not include such Mayor Richard M. Daley trademarks as wrought iron and seasonal flower boxes.|$|E
500|$|For much of 1931, Stackpole {{partnered with}} other artists to {{decorate}} Pflueger's Paramount Theatre in Oakland, an Art Deco masterpiece. A bas-relief scene of horses, waves and a central winged figure was {{placed over the}} stage's <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch,</b> finished in gold-toned metal leaf—the work jointly designed by Stackpole and Robert Boardman Howard. The design worked into Pflueger's metal grille ceiling grid likely came unattributed from Stackpole's sketches. Pflueger was an able project leader; Stackpole later described his involvement: [...] "He was the boss alright, as an architect should be... He would call the plays just as a symphony conductor does... There wasn't a lock, molding, or window {{that he did not}} inspect in the drawings and in the actual building with the utmost thoroughness and care." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{original}} Broadway production, {{the stage was}} completely open, with no curtain and the fly area and grid exposed to the audience. [...] The <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch</b> was outlined with climb-ready scaffolding. [...] Wagner's spare set was painted in shades of grey with street graffiti stenciled on the stage. [...] The stage was raked, and a tower of abstract scaffolding upstage at the rear merged a Native American totem pole and a modern sculpture of a crucifix-shaped tree. [...] This scaffolding was decorated with found objects that the cast had gathered {{from the streets of}} New York. [...] These included a life-size papier-mâché bus driver, the head of Jesus, and a neon marquee of the Waverly movie theater in Greenwich Village. [...] Potts' costumes were based on hippie street clothes, made more theatrical with enhanced color and texture. [...] Some of these included mixed parts of military uniforms, bell bottom jeans with Ukrainian embroidery, tie dyed T-shirts and a red white and blue fringed coat. [...] Early productions were primarily reproductions of this basic design.|$|E
500|$|The {{play was}} revived {{early in the}} Restoration. When the {{existing}} stock of pre-civil war plays was divided between the two newly created patent theatre companies, Hamlet was the only Shakespearean favourite that Sir William Davenant's Duke's Company secured. It became the first of Shakespeare's plays to be presented with movable flats painted with generic scenery behind the <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch</b> of Lincoln's Inn Fields Theatre. This new stage convention highlighted {{the frequency with which}} Shakespeare shifts dramatic location, encouraging the recurrent criticism of his failure to maintain unity of place. In the title role, Davenant cast Thomas Betterton, who continued to play the Dane until he was 74. David Garrick at Drury Lane produced a version that adapted Shakespeare heavily; he declared: [...] "I had sworn I would not leave the stage till I had rescued that noble play from all the rubbish of the fifth act. I have brought it forth without the grave-digger's trick, Osrick, & the fencing match". The first actor known to have played Hamlet in North America is Lewis Hallam. Jr., in the American Company's production in Philadelphia in 1759.|$|E
500|$|In February 1999, {{the city}} {{announced}} it was negotiating with Frank Gehry to design a <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch</b> and orchestra enclosure for a band shell in the new park, {{as well as a}} pedestrian bridge crossing Columbus Drive between Millennium Park and Daley Bicentennial Plaza. The city also sought donors {{to cover the cost of}} Gehry's work, which would eventually become Jay Pritzker Pavilion and the BP Pedestrian Bridge. [...] At the time, the Chicago Tribune dubbed Gehry [...] "the hottest architect in the universe" [...] in reference to the acclaim for his Guggenheim Museum Bilbao. [...] Millennium Park project manager Edward Uhlir said [...] "Frank is just the cutting edge of the next century of architecture", and noted that no other architect was being sought. [...] Gehry was approached several times by Skidmore, Owings & Merrill architect Adrian Smith on behalf of the city. [...] In April 1999, the city announced that the Pritzker family had donated $15million to fund Gehry's band shell and an additional nine donors committed a total of $10million more to the park. [...] That same day, Gehry agreed to the design request.|$|E
500|$|The King's Company {{was forced}} with some {{reluctance}} to commission the technically advanced and expensive Theatre Royal playhouse {{by the success}} of the rival Duke's Company, which was drawing fascinated crowds with their [...] "moveable" [...] or [...] "changeable" [...] scenery and visually gorgeous productions at the former Lisle's Tennis Court at Lincoln's Inn Fields. Imitating the innovations at Lincoln's Inn Fields, the Theatre Royal also featured moveable scenery with wings or shutters that could be smoothly changed between or even within acts. When not in use, the shutters rested out of sight behind the sides of the <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch,</b> which also served as a visual frame for the on-stage happenings. The picture-frame-like separation between audience and performance was a new phenomenon in English theatre, though it had been found on the Continent earlier. However, theatre design in London remained ambivalent about the merits of the [...] "picture-box" [...] stage, and for many decades to come, London theatres including Drury Lane had large forestages protruding beyond the arch, often including the thrust stages found in the Elizabethan theatres. The players could still step forward and bridge the distance between performer and audience, and in addition, it was not unusual for audience members to mount the stage themselves.|$|E
500|$|As Misson points out, {{the seating}} was divided by class, and tickets were priced accordingly. Box seats, {{used by the}} nobility and wealthy gentry, cost 5 shillings; the benches in the pit where some gentry sat, but also critics and scholars, cost 3 shillings; tradesmen and {{professionals}} occupied the first gallery with seats costing 2 shillings, while servants and other [...] "ordinary people", as Misson refers to them, occupied the 1 shilling seats of the upper gallery. Seats were not numbered and were offered on a [...] "first come, first served" [...] basis, leading {{many members of the}} gentry to send servants to reserve seats well ahead of performances. The stage was [...] wide and [...] deep with a raked floor from the footlights to the backdrop. The angle of the rake rose one inch for every [...] of horizontal stage. The stage floor included grooves for wings and flats in addition to trap doors in the floor. The <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch</b> covered the stage equipment above the stage that included a pair of girondels – large wheels holding many candles used to counteract the light from the footlights. Towards {{the latter part of the}} 18th century, doors were placed on either side of the stage, and a series of small spikes traced the edge of the stage apron to prevent audiences from climbing onto the stage. At the very back of the stage, a wide door opened to reveal Drury Lane.|$|E
500|$|In February 1999, {{the city}} {{announced}} it was negotiating with Frank Gehry to design a <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch</b> and orchestra enclosure for a bandshell, {{as well as a}} pedestrian bridge crossing Columbus Drive, and that it was seeking donors to cover his work.

[...] Gehry was approached several times by Skidmore architect Adrian Smith on behalf of the city. [...] His hesitance and refusal to accept the commission was overcome by Cindy Pritzker, the philanthropist, who had developed a relationship with the architect when he won the Pritzker Prize in 1989. According to John H. Bryan, who led fund-raising for the park, Pritzker enticed Gehry in face-to-face discussions, using a $15million funding commitment toward the bandshell's creation. [...] Having Gehry get involved helped the city realize its vision of having modern themes in the park; upon rumors of his involvement the Chicago Sun-Times proclaimed [...] "Perhaps the future has arrived", while the Chicago Tribune noted that [...] "The most celebrated architect in the world may soon have a chance to bring Chicago into the 21st Century".|$|E
500|$|NME {{reported}} that the tour would comprise 250 travelling workers, 69 guitars, 12 trampolines and 100 pairs of kneepads. The stage's layout {{was similar to the}} Confessions Tour stage. It had two giant textile panels that defined the <b>proscenium</b> <b>arch,</b> supporting two giant M-shaped structures, lit from within. The lighting beams and structures were rigged from the ceiling. There were four different clusters of loudspeakers {{in the back of the}} stage, providing sound to the rear tiers. The main stage was accompanied by a catwalk which was shorter than the Confessions Tour one, and a satellite stage at the end of the runway. There was a set of screens on the main stage – which moved and changed shape and layout, from the shape of a cube at the beginning of the show. Also present were two semi-transparent, cylinder-shaped screens, above the satellite stage. Other structures included a number of smaller platforms, ramps, and conveyor belts, which usually were kept beneath the main stage, but were brought out during some of the performances. The catwalks were shaped as a ramp at the very beginning but was transformed into a flat runway eventually. The tour was the first to use a pair of DiGiCo SD7 digital mixing consoles at the sound production's core audio. Tim Colvard, who previously presided as the sound consultant of the 2006 Confessions Tour, decided to use the SD7 technology after researching it. Madonna and her background vocalists used Sennheiser SKM 5200 wireless microphones with the highly directional ME 5005 super-cardioid heads, and Sennheiser in-ear monitors. Monitor engineer Matt Napier commented that he chose [...] "the Evolution systems for backline, as their RF is rock-solid, the transmitter units are small and reliable and they are very competitively priced. [...] And I couldn't imagine giving Madonna another monitor system, she has become so accustomed and comfortable with the IEM G2." ...|$|E
