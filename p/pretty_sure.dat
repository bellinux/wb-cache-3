500|$|As {{early as}} 2004, agents working for Afghan {{intelligence}} determined that Bin Laden {{was living in}} a major settled area in Pakistan proper, rather than the semi-autonomous tribal areas on the Afghan-Pakistan border, Amrullah Saleh told The Guardian. Leading Saleh and Afghan intelligence to that conclusion were [...] "thousands of interrogation reports" [...] and the assumption that Bin Laden [...] "a millionaire with multiple wives and no background of toughness would not be living in a tent". [...] "I was <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> he was in the settled areas of Pakistan because in 2005 it was still very easy to infiltrate the tribal areas, and we had massive numbers of informants there.

[...] A series of protest sign designs were proposed on the Daily Show featuring messages such as [...] "I disagree with you, but I'm <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> you're not Hitler."

500|$|The {{story of}} her death was recounted {{throughout}} Europe. Jules Verne mentioned her in Five Weeks in a Balloon and, in The Gambler, Fyodor Dostoevsky likened the thrill of committing oneself in gambling to the sensation that Blanchard must have felt as she fell.

Charles Dickens commented [...] "The jug goes often to the well, but is <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> to get cracked at last". With the advent of powered flight, ballooning and Blanchard's story were relegated to the margins of aviation history. A novel inspired by Blanchard's story, Linda Donn's The Little Balloonist, was published in 2006.|$|E

She is asked by Starfleet to infiltrate the rebel Maquis, who are undermining the Federation treaty with Cardassia.

When Alex confesses that her only motive {{to join the}} Academy was {{to find out the}} truth about her father and was about to leave, Ryan makes her realize that she is meant to be an agent. Alex's on-again off-again relationship with Ryan has been described by Chopra as star-crossed. She said [...] "Alex and Ryan are star-crossed lovers. You love them and they fight and have this intense passionate bond. But Alex is also a little self-destructive. She's a solitary person and she's not vulnerable enough, whereas Ryan really is. She's a little rough around the edges and whatever's happened in the past, she has trust issues. So that leads to issues in their relationship." [...] Fans have dubbed Alex and Ryan [...] "Ralex". On being asked about the possibility of having to choose between Ryan and saving the world, Chopra said [...] "I'm <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> she'd pick saving the world, because she's that kind of person." ...|$|E

It's still <b>pretty</b> morose, <b>sure.</b> But nothing in its bitter passivity and contained rage comes off as a defeat or a sham ... Maxinquaye {{had that kind of}} cool.

Tim Story said he was interested in directing a third and fourth film and writer Don Payne stated while he had not discussed a sequel with the studio, he was interested in working with more Fantastic Four characters saying [...] "I’ve always loved the Inhumans, the Skrulls, the Puppet Master, and Annihilus and the Negative Zone".

Vince's heart rate elevated {{more and more as}} Prinze informed him on what was [...] "wrong" [...] with WWE since he went into a coma.

Staff from GamesRadar singled out the appearance of the Gravemind as a sign the Halo series had jumped the shark. [...] "Until Gravemind showed up, we were <b>pretty</b> <b>sure</b> we understood the Halo series' story," [...] they wrote, but that the appearance of a Venus Flytrap-like creature with an ego and [...] "a tendency to spout philosophical drivel" [...] was unexpected. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com bemoaned the fact that Gravemind was never explicitly stated to be the Flood leader in either Halo 2 or Halo 3 and was hardly seen in the third installment. Publications also took issue with the fact that the character's motivations were never fully explored; the South Florida Sun-Sentinel said that the [...] "unique and compelling characters" [...] of Halo 3, such as Cortana and the Master Chief, were overwhelmed by Gravemind.|$|E
