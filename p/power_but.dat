5|$|The December 1969 general election—in {{which all}} {{candidates}} {{were from the}} ruling KANU—resulted in Kenyatta's government remaining in <b>power,</b> <b>but</b> many members of his government were defeated by rivals from within the party.|$|E
5|$|A {{complex set}} of checks and {{balances}} developed between these three branches. For example, the assemblies theoretically held all <b>power,</b> <b>but</b> were called and governed by the magistrates, who, controlling discussion, exercised dominating influence over them. Similarly, to check the power of the magistrates, each magistrate could veto one of their colleagues and the plebeians elected tribunes who could intercede and veto the actions of a magistrate.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} his trusted {{advisers}} were Hungarian, and he remained interested in Hungarian politics. Báthory wished to recreate his native country into an independent, strong <b>power,</b> <b>but</b> the unfavorable international situation did not allow him to significantly advance any of his plans in that area. In addition to Hungarian, he was well versed in Latin, and spoke Italian and German; he never learned the Polish language.|$|E

5|$|During the Second and Third Age, {{they held}} some {{protected}} realms {{with the aid}} of the Rings of <b>Power,</b> <b>but</b> after the War of the Ring they waned further, and most Elves left Middle-earth for Valinor. Tolkien's published writings give somewhat contradictory hints as to what happened to the Elves of Middle-earth after the One Ring was destroyed {{at the end of the}} Third Age.|$|E
5|$|Radio {{became popular}} in Germany during the 1930s, with over 70 percent of {{households}} owning a receiver by 1939, {{more than any other}} country. Radio station staffs were purged of leftists and others deemed undesirable by July 1933. Propaganda and speeches were typical radio fare immediately after the seizure of <b>power,</b> <b>but</b> as time went on Goebbels insisted that more music be played so that listeners would not turn to foreign broadcasters for entertainment.|$|E
5|$|Some {{of those}} who have {{attempted}} to find an escape from the impulse to power have resorted to forms of quietism or pacifism. One major proponent of such approaches was the philosopher Laozi. From Russell's perspective, such views are incoherent, since they only deny themselves coercive <b>power,</b> <b>but</b> retain an interest in persuading others to their cause; and persuasion is a form of power, for Russell. Moreover, he argues that the love of power can actually be a good thing. For instance, if one feels a certain duty towards their neighbours, they may attempt to attain power to help those neighbours (Russell 1938:215–216). In sum, the focus of any policy should not be on a ban on kinds of <b>power,</b> <b>but</b> rather, on certain kinds of use of power (Russell 1938:221).|$|E

5|$|The cost of Nevada Solar One is in {{the range}} of $220–250million. The power {{produced}} is slightly more expensive than wind <b>power,</b> <b>but</b> was less than photovoltaic (PV) power. As photovoltaics became less expensive, some proposed CSP projects have been converted to photovoltaics projects.|$|E
5|$|The {{effects of}} {{electromagnetism}} are most visibly {{employed in the}} electric motor, which provides a clean and efficient means of motive power. A stationary motor such as a winch is easily provided with a supply of <b>power,</b> <b>but</b> a motor that moves with its application, such as an electric vehicle, is obliged to either carry along a power source such as a battery, or to collect current from a sliding contact such as a pantograph.|$|E
5|$|Timothy Bloodworth was {{withdrawn}} from the Reserve Fleet on 6 July 1954. It is not reported where the ship went {{or whether it was}} under her own <b>power,</b> <b>but</b> she reentered the fleet on 17 July, loaded with grain. On 29 October 1956, after {{a little more than two}} years, she was again {{withdrawn from the}} reserve fleet to unload the grain, and was returned empty on 6 November.|$|E

5|$|Amtrak ordered 26 E60s in 1973; 15 on March 26, 1973, and {{a further}} 11 on October 12. The {{total cost of}} the order was $18.4 million. The initial order was for 15 {{locomotives}} with steam generators and 11 with head-end <b>power,</b> <b>but</b> 9 of the first type were switched to using head-end power as Amtrak ramped up acquisition of Amfleet cars. Amtrak anticipated that E60-hauled Amfleet trains could displace both the GG1s and the mechanically-unreliable Metroliners.|$|E
5|$|At the 1928 {{election}} Bruce's {{government was}} returned to <b>power,</b> <b>but</b> it now had a majority of just nine a fragile result, given the growing propensity for Nationalist member defections. Most of the Nationalists' parliamentary gains from 1925 had been wiped out. James Scullin had assumed {{the leadership of the}} ALP earlier in the year, upon the retirement of Charlton, and the party was invigorated as a consequence. Bruce was undeterred, though, and became convinced that unless costs of production for industry in Australia could be lowered and industrial peace secured, Australia was heading towards a major economic crisis. This doctrine was the basis of his appeals to the public for the next year and a half.|$|E
5|$|Before {{the end of}} the year, Gaveston had {{returned}} to England, and civil war appeared imminent. In May 1312, Gaveston was taken captive by the Earl of Pembroke, but Warwick and Lancaster had him abducted and executed after a mock trial. This affront to Pembroke’s honour drove him irrevocably into the camp of the king, and thereby split the opposition. The brutality of the act initially drove Lancaster and his adherents away from the centre of <b>power,</b> <b>but</b> the Battle of Bannockburn, in June 1314, returned the initiative. Edward was humiliated by his disastrous defeat, while Lancaster and Warwick had not taken part in the campaign, claiming that it was carried out without the consent of the baronage, and as such in defiance of the Ordinances.|$|E

5|$|Engines and {{propellers}} numbers 1 to 3 suffered substantial {{damage in}} the crash, but engine and propeller number 4 suffered much less damage. The investigators determined {{that at the time}} of impact, propellers 1, 2 and 3 were turning normally and their engines were producing <b>power</b> <b>but</b> propeller number 4 was feathered and its engine was not operating. There was also some evidence that action was taken by the crew to unfeather propeller number 4 in the moments before impact. None of the engines contained evidence of any internal failure prior to impact. All the magnetos were tested and the results indicated normal ignition was available to all engines up to the time of impact.|$|E
5|$|In 1897, {{before the}} {{revolution}} in design brought about by HMS Dreadnought, the Royal Navy had 62 battleships in commission or building, a lead of 26 over France and 50 over Germany. In 1906, the Royal Navy owned the field with Dreadnought. The new class of ship prompted an arms race with major strategic consequences. Major naval powers raced {{to build their own}} dreadnoughts. Possession of modern battleships was not only seen as vital to naval <b>power,</b> <b>but</b> also, as with nuclear weapons after WWII, represented a nation's standing in the world. Germany, France, Japan, Italy, Austria, and the United States all began dreadnought programmes; while Ottoman Turkey, Argentina, Russia, Brazil, and Chile commissioned dreadnoughts to be built in British and American yards.|$|E
5|$|In September 1980, in the {{aftermath}} of the labor agreements, First Secretary Gierek was removed from office and replaced as party leader by Stanisław Kania. Kania made promises of the sort that Gomułka and Gierek had made when each came <b>power.</b> <b>But</b> whatever goodwill the new leader gained, it lasted for an even shorter period than it had been the case in 1956 and 1971, because there was no way that the regime could have kept the promises it had made at Gdańsk, even if it wanted to. The authorities were still trapped by the contradiction: if they followed economic necessity, they would generate political instability. GNP fell in 1979 by 2%, in 1980 by 8% and in 1981 by 15–20%.|$|E

5|$|In {{testing the}} {{transmitter}} proved only barely suitable in the air-to-air role, with short detection ranges {{due to its}} relatively low <b>power.</b> <b>But</b> to everyone's surprise, {{it was able to}} easily pick out the wharves and cranes at the Harwich docks a few miles south of Bawdsey. Shipping appeared as well, but the team was unable to test this very well as the Heyford was forbidden to fly over water. After this success, Bowen was granted two Avro Anson patrol aircraft, K6260 and K8758, along with five pilots stationed at Martlesham to test this ship-detection role. Early tests demonstrated a problem with noise from the ignition system interfering with the receiver, but this was soon resolved by fitters at the Royal Aircraft Establishment (RAE).|$|E
5|$|Mary Shelley {{believed}} in the Enlightenment idea that people could improve society through the responsible exercise of political <b>power,</b> <b>but</b> she feared that the irresponsible exercise of power would lead to chaos. In practice, her works largely criticise the way 18th-century thinkers such as her parents believed such change could be brought about. The creature in Frankenstein, for example, reads books associated with radical ideals but the education he gains from them is ultimately useless. Shelley's works reveal her as less optimistic than Godwin and Wollstonecraft; she lacks faith in Godwin's theory that humanity could eventually be perfected.|$|E
5|$|Mayberry {{has been}} used {{predominantly}} as a starting outfielder, despite some suggesting he is better suited as a platoon player. He hits for <b>power,</b> <b>but</b> strikes out frequently. He is a good athlete, with good speed, but does not steal many bases. Defensively, he is adequate, and possesses a strong and accurate arm. Mayberry has a degree in political science from Stanford. His father, John Mayberry, Sr., played {{in the major leagues}} for over a decade and was a two-time All Star.|$|E
