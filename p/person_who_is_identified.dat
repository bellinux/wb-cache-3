5|$|Stela 39 is {{the broken}} {{bottom half of}} a stela that was found inside Temple 5D-86, on the east-west axis running through the East Platform from the Lost World Pyramid. The {{monument}} is sculpted {{on the front and}} back faces and was deliberately broken in ancient times and was moved inside the temple in order to save it. The front of the stela shows the bottom half of a <b>person,</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> as a ruler by his costume; the back features two columns of hieroglyphs. The king depicted on the stela is ChakTokIch'aakI, who governed in the 4th century AD. This king is standing over a bound captive; the bearded captive appears to be a noble since he retains his clothing. The stela celebrates an event in AD 376 and appears to have been moved to the Mundo Perdido in relation to a funerary ceremony. The stela was possibly moved to the temple by king YaxNuunAyiinII to celebrate the changing of the 20-year k'atun Maya calendrical cycle in AD 771 and thereby link himself to ChakTokIch'aakI. It was placed directly over the most important of the late 4th century elite tombs. The stela continued to be worshipped in the Terminal Classic, as evidenced by the presence of polychrome ceramic offerings and incense burners.|$|E

5000|$|The {{concept has}} its roots in Derrida's {{discussion}} of Karl Marx in Spectres of Marx, specifically Marx's proclamation that [...] "a spectre is haunting Europe—the spectre of communism" [...] in The Communist Manifesto. Derrida also calls on Shakespeare's Hamlet, particularly a phrase spoken by the titular character: [...] "the time is out of joint." [...] Derrida's prior work in deconstruction, on concepts of trace and différance in particular, serves as the foundation of his formulation of hauntology, fundamentally asserting that there is no temporal point of pure origin but only an [...] "always-already absent present.." [...] The word functions as a deliberate near-homophone to [...] "ontology" [...] in Derrida's native French. Peter Buse and Andrew Scott, discussing Derrida's notion of hauntology, explain: Ghosts arrive from the past and appear in the present. However, the ghost cannot be properly said to belong to the past[...] [...] [...] Does then the ‘historical’ <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> <b>identified</b> with the ghost properly belong to the present? Surely not, as the idea of a return from death fractures all traditional conceptions of temporality. The temporality to which the ghost is subject is therefore paradoxical, at once they ‘return’ and make their apparitional debut. Derrida has been pleased to call this dual movement of return and inauguration a ‘hauntology’, a coinage that suggests a spectrally deferred non-origin within grounding metaphysical terms such as history and identity[...] [...] [...] Such an idea also informs the well-known discussion of the origin of language in Of Grammatology, where [...] [...] [...] any attempt to isolate the origin of language will find its inaugural moment already dependent upon a system of linguistic differences that have been installed prior to the ‘originary’ moment (11).|$|E

40|$|Aim: Costs {{associated}} {{with mental health}} treatment for young persons at 2 ̆ 7 ultra 2 ̆ 7 high risk (UHR) of developing a psychotic disorder have not previously been reported. This paper reports cost implications of providing psychological and pharmacological intervention for individuals at UHR for psychosis compared with minimal psychological treatment. Method: Mental health service costs {{associated with}} a randomized controlled trial of two treatments (Specific Preventive Intervention: SPI and Needs-Based Intervention: NBI) for UHR young persons were estimated and compared at three time points: treatment phase, short-term follow up and medium-term follow up. Results: Although the SPI group incurred significantly higher treatment costs than the NBI group over the treatment phase, they incurred significantly lower outpatient treatment costs over the longer term. Conclusion: This study indicates that specific interventions designed to treat young <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>identified</b> as being at UHR of psychosis might be associated with some cost savings compared with non-specific interventions. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Background. Epidemiologic {{evidence}} suggests that African Americans have higher rates of Alzheimer’s disease (AD) than do whites. Examining longitudinal trends {{in the number of}} <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>identified</b> as having AD in administrative databases may provide insights into this phenomenon. Methods. We analyzed 9 -year longitudinal data (1991 – 1999) for 29, 679 Medicare beneficiaries <b>who</b> <b>were</b> screened for the National Long-Term Care Survey. Cases of AD <b>were</b> <b>identified</b> using ICD- 9 -CM diagnosis codes from Medicare claims files. Results. Age-adjusted rates of Medicare beneficiaries identified as having AD rose from 1991 – 1999 for all groups studied, but particularly among African Americans. In 1991, African Americans made up 6. 5 % of the identified AD cases but comprised 11. 0 % of cases in 1999 (X 2 6. 79, p. 005). The rate of increase in identification of AD was particularly large for women <b>who</b> <b>were</b> aged 85 years and older. Conclusions. Reasons for increased identification of AD in Medicare claims is likely multifactorial; sharp increases among African Americans may reflect improved access. ALZHEIMER’S disease (AD) is a progressive neurode-generative disorder and is {{the most common cause of}} dementia in older adults in the United States (1, 2).

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} how mentally retarded persons accept or reject their disability by comparing perceptions that retarded individuals hold of themselves with their perceptions of persons labeled as mentally retarded. The study was also designed to compare perceptions that retarded individuals hold of themselves with their perceptions of persons with no disability label. Finally, the study was designed to compare perceptions that retarded individuals hold of persons labeled as mentally retarded with their perceptions of persons with no disability label. The subjects of this study were 48 males and 48 females from sheltered workshops in Arizona. All subjects <b>were</b> <b>identified</b> as mentally retarded by professional staff from the rehabilitation facilities and voluntarily participated in the study. The subjects were randomly assigned to one of six experimental groups. In Group 1, subjects successfully performed an assembly test and evaluated themselves; in Group 2, subjects failed on the assembly test and evaluated themselves. Subjects in Group 3 evaluated a person labeled as mentally retarded after observing that person successfully complete the assembly test; subjects in Group 4 evaluated the same labeled person after observing that person fail on the assembly test. Members of Group 5 observed an unlabeled person succeed at the assembly test and evaluated that person, and members of Group 6 evaluated the same unlabeled person after observing that person fail on the assembly test. A factorial design varying target persons (self vs. person labeled as mentally retarded vs. person with no label) and performance outcomes (success vs. failure) on the assembly test was employed. The dependent variables were: (1) each subject's assessment of the cause of the target person's performance outcome as measured by the Causal Attribution Scale; (2) each subject's description of the target person as measured by the Semantic Differential and the Adjective Checklist; and, (3) each subject's expectations of the target person as measured by the Expectancy Questionnaire. Rank mean scores on each instrument were produced for the experimental groups and analyzed by Mann-Whitney U tests. In general, the results of the study indicated that mentally retarded persons do not perceive extensive differences between themselves and <b>persons</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> <b>identified</b> as being mentally retarded. Similarly, someone labeled as mentally retarded is not perceived in any more less favorable terms than a <b>person</b> <b>who</b> <b>is</b> not <b>identified</b> as being mentally retarded...|$|R

40|$|Abstract:- The {{transportation}} {{industries have}} been subjected to unprecedented scrutiny and regulatory mandates in the post- 9 / 11 era. On the other hand, the inner border inspections were closed down in Europe with the Schengen agreement. Freedom of movement has brought new challenges to the authorities and transportation companies. Effective camera surveillance with a facial recognition system (FRS) could be a realistic solution. FRS requires camera(s) and a control device; a computer with special software. The software processes the material, face images, collected by the cameras. FRS has been used as monitoring and controlling tool in major events and border crossings. The aim of FRS is to maintain and improve safety and security in a cost efficient way by saving manpower. However, FRS is an additional security tool and therefore not to be trusted only. FRS is being used mainly as a verification method where the human face functions as an access or pin code. Optimal operational environment for FRS is a dry environment with stable illumination; most likely indoor environment is needed to guarantee the operational ability. Images of the faces should be collected in close distance and the <b>persons,</b> <b>who</b> <b>are</b> to <b>be</b> <b>identified,</b> should cooperate. FRS is composition of technical elements and applications which are commonly used in everyday life. Profiling the environment and setting reasonable aims, FRS could be used in various places. Hence FRS is challenging the traditional methods as a sophisticated security tool for the sophisticated situations. So far, the only operational FRS i...|$|R
