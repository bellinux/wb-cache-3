40|$|Purpose of {{this article}} was to {{introduce}} a new method of forging which is called “Cross Die Forging”. In this method, the required force (load) is reduced to the greatest possible degree through elimination of flash channel; however, this would also decrease the positive effect of flash channel, namely filling the gaps and pores within the mold. Cross die forging procedure provides a way for providing a better preform design which ensures that the mold is filled without allowing the material to enter the flash channel.

40|$|Superplastic forming is {{a viable}} method for shaping supperalloys {{including}} titanium based materials which are otherwise awkward to shape. Further eort is, however, required to commercialize this process and introduce it to metal forming enterprises. Special facilities capable of providing control-lable forming environment are needed for implementing this process. A hot isostatic/isothermal pressing machine possessing such a characteristic is an eective candidate for this purpose. Hot isostatic pressing has vastly been em-ployed for diusion bonding, powder metallurgy and investment casting, while its application to bulk- and sheet-metal forming needs far more investigation.

The objec-tives of this study were to establish the severity of the symptoms and the difference in vibration exposure between the new and the old machines. Vibration detection thresholds and grip forces were measured, as well as the vibration in the casting and in the wrist simultaneously. The mean latency for VWF among the grinders was 103 months after the change of pedestal grinding machines. All the grinders had numbness in their hands. The vibration detection threshold was significantly higher for the grinders than for their referents. At the same circle speed, the new wheels caused vibration levels up to 12 dB more than the old wheels. The circle speed had a slight influence on the vibration. The vibration levels of light (0. 5 kg) casting were up to 25 dB higher than the heavy (5 kg) casting. The use of a pneumatic <b>pressing</b> <b>device</b> decreased the vibration levels in the wrist by 5 - 10 dB.

40|$|Introduction: In {{order to}} improve the use of {{pesticides}} and pesticide consumption and prevent environmental pollution, manufactures and scientists have considered two major trends. The first major trend is improving techniques that are practical and effective use of small quantities of chemicals to reduce the negative effect of residues of pesticides. The use of new methods usually requires investment and cost. The second major trend is changing the parts that are more important to reform the sprayer components {{in order to reduce}} pollution, mainly by including engineering controls, and design and construction of appropriate nozzles. The optimization can be done with the least expensive pesticide. Nozzle is a device for spraying the solution in the form of particles with a certain pattern. Tip of a nozzle is placed in the nozzle’s body and has many different types. The main factors in choosing tips include: material, pattern of distribution, spray angle and the amount of the solution. The spray tip may be made of aluminum, brass, nylon, stainless steel, ceramic or other materials. Nanocomposites are composites that contain at least one component with dimensions in the nanometer range between 1 to 100 nm. This material is suitable as an alternative to overcome the limitations that exist with integrated microcomposites. The aim of this study was the construction and evaluation of a sprayer nozzle with ceramic nanocomposites with good shelf life and optimum performance. Materials and methods: This research was supported by the Agricultural Engineering Research Institute and Nanotechnology Committee of the Ministry of Agriculture. The operations of this study were as follows: 1 - Preparing of materials, including alumina powder and stabilized zirconia powder with yttrium. 2 - Design and manufacture of molds. 3 - Preparation of the samples pressing operations. 4 - Zintering of samples to achieve high density. 5 - Tests to determine the quality of the products. In order to prepare nanocomposite powder mixed with stabilized zirconia alumina, the ratio of 10 / 90 percent by volume of the powder was poured into the mill for three hours and it was stirred in the mixer. Pressing is placing the powder into a mold, and applying pressure to achieve the desired density. In this study, <b>pressing</b> <b>device</b> with 30 tons was manually used and powder sample in the amount of one gram was placed in a semi-cylindrical small hollow. After making a few samples and determining the optimal pressure and time of pressing in action, samples were manufactured under 90 kg cm- 2 pressure at 20 seconds. A high temperature furnace model F 3 L- 1720 was used for zintering. Samples were put into the furnace after forming by a single-axis press. Temperature the of furnace was raised up 1650 °C at a rate of 10 degrees per minute and then the samples were exposed for one hour in order for the heat to be evenly applied in all the body of the nozzle. Finally, a hollow cone spray pattern fan nozzle with a major diameter of 15 mm and an inner diameter of 2 mm was built. Equipment for analyzing used in this study included: X-Ray Diffraction device (XRD), Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM). The flow rate output was measured at a pressure of 2 bar in the period of 0 - 50 hours at 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 8, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, 40 and 50 hours. Results and Discussion: XRD analysis of nano-composite stabilizer in the presence of yttria- zirconia- alumina toughness with (Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 -Y 2 O 3), yttria stabilized zirconia (ZrO 2 -Y 2 O 3) and alumina indicates respective phases. For the samples made with better properties, it should be uniformly distributed within it. To evaluate the uniformity, SEM-Mapping test samples were made. The results showed that the distribution of Y, Zr, Al in nanocomposite (Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 -Y 2 O 3) is almost uniform. The results of changes in the level of output over time showed that the rate of flow in composite (Al 2 O 3 -ZrO 2 -Y 2 O 3) nozzle versus ceramic conventional (Al 2 O 3) nozzle after 50 hours of testing under static condition, flow rate was decreased to 30 - 35 percent. Conclusions: Nozzles {{are one of the most}} important terminal parts in sprayers and are used to spread the liquid evenly at a certain flow rate. Addinga nanomaterial ceramic structure as a new solution was effective. By paying attention to reduce the use of chemicals and protection of the resource bases, a correct approach to the development of agricultural mechanization equipment that are essential components should be a priorityas a low-cost solution...|$|E

As {{the upper}} {{temperature}} {{for use of}} reduced activation ferritic/martensitic (RAFM) steels is presently limited by a drop in mechanical strength at about 550 °C, Europe, Japan and the US are actively researching steels with high strength at higher operating temperatures, mainly using stable oxide dispersion.

30|$|The “activation” {{category}} {{refers to}} the initiation of an injection. The three subcategories “failure to release the safety lock”, “failure to push the button (at all, or with enough force)” and “failure to press the device against the injection site (at all, or with enough force)” {{were related to the}} device’s design. Some devices require a safety lock to be released before an injection can be triggered (Phillips et al., 2011; Callis Duffin et al., 2016). Some users failed to release the safety lock. Depending on the device, an injection can be triggered either by pushing a button or by <b>pressing</b> the <b>device</b> against the body. For devices with a dedicated button, two types of use error were reported. Firstly, some users were not aware that they had to activate the device by pushing a button (Robinson et al., 2014; Salter et al., 2014; Brown et al., 2013). Secondly, some users were not able to push the button with enough force to trigger the injection (Fujioka et al., 2015; Callis Duffin et al., 2016; Matfin et al., 2015; Demary et al., 2014). The same distinction could be made for devices that have to be activated by pressing them against the body. Ten publications reported on users who failed to activate an injection because they did not press the device against the injection site (Sicherer et al., 2000; Salter et al., 2014; Brown et al., 2013; Umasunthar et al., 2015; Bakirtas et al., 2011; Mehr et al., 2007; Arga et al., 2011; Topal et al., 2013; Saleh-Langenberg et al., 2017; Hanna et al., 2016). Three publications mentioned that users did not press the device against the body hard enough to activate an injection (Guerlain et al., 2010 a; Edwards et al., 2013; Raffa et al., 2017). Furthermore, one publication reported a “too short contact duration” between the device and the patient’s body; consequently, an injection could not be triggered (Schmid et al., 2013). Concerning the “unintentional activation” subcategory, one publication described a case in which the device was inadvertently activated during the dose setting (Rohrer et al., 2013).|$|R

30|$|Stroke {{recognition}}: Stroke recognition can {{be viewed}} as the problem of transforming text in the 2 D spatial cursive forms into symbolic representation. There are two categories: online and offline based on the way of data collection. Online indicates that the writing order is available while offline only has the finished writing results. Order information are collected using an electronic pad or touch screen by recording the ordered two-dimensional coordinates of successive points <b>pressing</b> on the <b>device.</b> Plamondon et al. [2] provide a comprehensive survey on stroke recognition in both categories, and Tappert et al. [1] review those online recognition state-of-the-art algorithms. However, all research reviewed in these two papers mainly focus on the recognition of alphabetic languages, but Chinese Mandarin is a pictographic language by connecting pictographic characters to form sentences instead of spelling the vocabularies. A Chinese character is generally composed of mostly straight lines or “poly-line” strokes. Many characters can be decomposed into relatively independent substructures, called radicals, and different characters may share some common radicals. Generally, recognition can utilize this property to simplify their recognition. Liu et al. [3] survey the advances in online Chinese character recognition. Although there are more feature extraction algorithms [14, 15] invented for image content understanding, developing proper features for Chinese characters is still problematic because of different personal writing habits. Furthermore, the concept can be extended furthermore to recognize the traffic sign while driving [16]. With the advance of mobile devices, social messaging becomes very important [17]. As a result, instant messaging replaces letter writing for personal communication, and typing is the most common input manner for message creation. Since mobile devices have a small screen for typing, they generally cause the following typing difficulties: fast input and fat finger. Therefore, with the entrance of scanners, graphics tablets, and touch screens, Plamondon et al. [2] propose to take handwriting as input and use stroke recognition to replace inconvenient typing. Prochasson et al. [4] collect handwriting data including skeletons, rebuses, and phonetic writing to construct a recognition system for texting input. Although stroke recognition can make texting more intuitive, the robustness of recognition is still problematic due to different writing habits among different users. Therefore, we intend to directly deliver the writing or drawing in a vectorized format without recognition. Furthermore, computer characters and words cannot deliver the emotion and feeling of the user while he/she creates the message. Therefore, this work aims at adding emotional aspects which are missing from texting into instant messaging through handwriting.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to research, design and build a shoe press for a local company called Soft Star Shoes. Soft Star Shoes were looking for {{different}} ways to replace their barging process, which {{is the process of}} attaching the rubber sole of the shoe to the upper leather. To perform this process, Soft Star Shoes used hammering, which was physically straining, caused operators to get frustrated, as well as, slowed the production process. After receiving the problem description and customer requirements, a decision to go with an automated press was made. The team researched existing shoe presses to use as benchmarks in the design process. The team then performed ergonomic analysis to understand the severity of the problem, and stress-strain and reliability analyses to find maximum loads, and fracturing points. In addition, the team interviewed Soft Star Shoes barge employees to determine the requirements that needed to be met for the press to be considered a good replacement for the hammering process. Using this information, the team designed and built a shoe press that meets the customer’s needs. The new device is a 17 ” by 17 ” by 12 ” press that is held by five vertical columns. These columns are attached to two 0. 5 ” thick steel plates (one on the top and one on the bottom). The press is powered using a 115 V ball screw device, which is inserted {{through a hole in the}} top steel plate, and carries a 14 ” x 14 ” x 0. 5 ” <b>pressing</b> plate. The <b>device</b> travels a vertical distance of 10 ” to perform the pressing process. Tests were started upon finishing the design process. The tests were conducted based on the engineering requirements generated. The press passed all these tests, which meant that the team has achieved the sponsor’s needs. However, the project was not done at that point. The press was dirty and the steel was rusted. So cosmetic operations were performed.
