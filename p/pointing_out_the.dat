5|$|Critical {{reception}} for {{the album was}} generally favorable, with several reviewers <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> fact that it highly resembled the band's debut album. Critics also said the album was less groundbreaking than their debut but had humorous and enjoyable pieces. The album peaked at 148 on the Billboard 200 despite its critical acclaim {{as well as the}} band members expecting more commercial success.|$|E
5|$|Game Revolution {{had a more}} {{critical}} review of Dino Crisis than others, saying the game expanded on the worse elements of Resident Evil while also ruining the good elements. They were impressed by the graphics but thought the environments looked too similar and got boring after a short time. Overall, they believed the game to be worse than Resident Evil 2, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> game's shorter length, more tedious puzzles, weaker action, and lesser scare factor.|$|E

5|$|In 2002 the Norwegian National Rail Administration {{warned that}} lack of funding {{might lead to a}} closure of all long-distance {{passenger}} trains in Norway, including the Bergen Line. Torild Skogsholm, Minister of Transport and Communications assured that it was not the government's policy to close railway lines. In 2004 the Progress Party suggested closing down the railway line and replacing it with a motorway between Bergen and Oslo, arguing that the railway was unprofitable, and that bus transport was cheaper while easier truck transport would aid business. Other political parties rejected the proposal <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> better environmental performance of the railway and that the railway transports large volumes of freight.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the move from Zeus to Nike-X was concern that the Zeus radars would not be able to tell the {{difference}} between the warhead and a decoy until it was too late to launch. One solution to this problem was the Sprint missile, which had the performance required to wait until decluttering was complete. Another potential solution was to look for some sort of signature of the reentry through the highest levels of the atmosphere that might differ between a warhead and decoy; specifically, it appeared that the ablation of the heat shield might produce a clear signature <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> warhead.|$|E
5|$|After the {{discovery}} of flerovium and livermorium was recognized by IUPAC on 1 June 2011, IUPAC asked {{the discovery}} team at the JINR to suggest permanent names for those two elements. The Dubna team chose to name element 114 flerovium (symbol Fl), after the Russian Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (FLNR), named after the Soviet physicist Georgy Flyorov (also spelled Flerov); earlier reports claim the element name was directly proposed to honour Flyorov. In accordance with the proposal received from the discoverers IUPAC officially named flerovium after the Flerov Laboratory of Nuclear Reactions (an older name for the JINR), not after Flyorov himself. Flyorov is known for writing to Stalin in April 1942 and <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> silence in scientific journals {{in the field of}} nuclear fission in the United States, Great Britain, and Germany. Flyorov deduced that this research must have become classified information in those countries. Flyorov's work and urgings {{led to the development of}} the USSR's own atomic bomb project.|$|E
50|$|After a spymaster {{gives the}} hint with its word and number, their field {{operatives}} make guesses about which code name cards bear words {{related to the}} hint and <b>point</b> them <b>out,</b> one at a time. When a code name card is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> spymaster covers that card with an appropriate identity card -- a blue agent card, a red agent card, an innocent bystander card, or the assassin card -- as indicated on the spymasters' map of the grid. If <b>the</b> assassin is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> game ends immediately, with the team who identified him losing. If {{an agent of the}} other team is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> turn ends immediately, and that other team is also one agent closer to winning. If an innocent bystander is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> turn simply ends; but note that this also eliminates one more potential wrong guess that the other team might have made, right before their turn. If an agent of the playing team is <b>pointed</b> <b>out,</b> <b>the</b> team may <b>point</b> <b>out</b> another card if they have guesses left. Again, the maximum number of guesses in any turn is the hint's number plus one.|$|R

The association implemented the first environmental resources management actions at the site and developed its first environmental management scheme In 2009, the association obtained the agreement establishing the regional nature reserve at the site for a period of 20 years.|$|E
5|$|In {{his review}} of the Director's Cut, IGN's Brian Albert, despite noting {{inconsistencies}} in enemy behavior, shared much of his praised with the original version {{in addition to the}} added gameplay mechanics and improved boss battles. GameSpot's VanOrd again noted dated facial animations and poor AI, but generally praised other aspects of the Director's Cut, particularly <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> improvements to boss battles. Bramwell, again writing for Eurogamer, particularly praised the revamped boss battles and the inclusion of additional content such as The Missing Link that did not function properly as a standalone release. He also echoed much of his praise for the original game. Michael Gapper of Official Nintendo Magazine stated that all the changes made to the game for the Director's Cut had improved it for the better, praising its gameplay balance and freedom of choice in addition to the new features.|$|E

Michael gets down on his knee and begins to make a speech when the sprinklers go off from the candles. The water drenches everyone in the office and Michael proposes. Holly accepts. Everyone then begins to congratulate Michael. However, Michael announces he is moving to Colorado with Holly. The scene ends with his employees in shock.|$|E

Later, when Sasuke attempts to kill Naruto, Orochimaru stays his hand by <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> boy's use in taking down the Akatsuki and thus lessening the number of enemies he has. Eventually, Sasuke uses his Sharingan to void Orochimaru's technique and retains control of his body while trapping Orochimaru's soul within him. The suppression, in turn, gives Sasuke access to many of Orochimaru's abilities in the process. During Sasuke's later fight with Itachi, Sasuke is left too weak to continue suppressing Orochimaru's soul, allowing Orochimaru to escape and try to take his body again. Before he can do so, Itachi seals him away.|$|E
5|$|When the war ended, Herring {{wished to}} return to Australia and see Mary before {{resuming}} his studies at the University of Oxford in October 1919. Mary wrote back <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> impracticality of this idea; while she would be disappointed not to see him, he should remain in England and complete his course at Oxford first. The university had awarded him a wartime Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree in 1915; the Rhodes Scholarship Trust allowed him to resume his scholarship, and he studied for a Bachelor of Civil Law (BCL) degree. Since it had been five years since he had been awarded his BA, he was entitled to a MA as well, and graduated with both degrees in July 1920. After a holiday in Britain and France with his sister Kathleen, he arrived back in Melbourne on 26 November 1920.|$|E
5|$|After {{three months}} of futile escape attempts, Springfield's {{residents}} finally make {{a crack in the}} dome; <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> damage, Cargill manipulates Schwarzenegger into ordering the town's destruction. In Alaska, the Simpsons see an advertisement starring Tom Hanks for a new Grand Canyon on the site of Springfield; realizing the town is endangered, Marge and the children {{want to go back to}} save it, but Homer refuses to help the people who tried to kill him. After failing to talk Homer into it, his family eventually leave him for good. Alone, Homer is stranded on an iceberg and floats away. Homer gets closer to Springfield, able to see the dome. While observing it (using imaginary binoculars that somehow work), he hears saxophone music coming from an armored van. Homer realizes that his family is inside, and tries to rescue them by knocking the truck over with a wrecking ball. Unfortunately, the plan doesn't work, and he gets hit by the wrecking ball painfully. Bart tries to break his shackles but the truck drivers fill the compartment with tranquilizer gas, knocking the family out.|$|E

5|$|Events {{come to a}} {{head when}} Ryotaro Dojima mistakenly accuses the protagonist of being {{involved}} in the murders. Nanako is kidnapped during the protagonist's interrogation, leading Ryotaro to engage in a vehicular pursuit with the culprit. The chase ends as they both crash; the kidnapper escapes with Nanako through a television set in his truck, and the gravely-injured Ryotaro entrusts her rescue to the group. The group tracks them down within the TV world; the culprit, Taro Namatame, becomes a god-like monster—Kunino-sagiri—which attacks them but is defeated, and both he and Nanako are taken to the Inaba hospital. When Nanako appears to die, the group furiously confronts Namatame; as the protagonist, the player must help the others realize that Namatame is not the killer by <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> lack of a proper motive, and subsequently work to determine that Ryotaro's assistant, Tohru Adachi, is the true killer. Failure to do so ends the game with the party unable to solve the case; Nanako either remaining dead, or reviving but remaining hospitalised; and the recurring fog permanently setting in, the last of which will eventually lead to humanity's demise.|$|E
5|$|In 1977 the Ethio-Somali War {{broke out}} over the disputed Ogaden region as Somalia invaded Ethiopia; {{although}} a former ally of Somali President Siad Barre, Castro had warned him against such action, and Cuba sided with Mengistu Haile Mariam's Marxist government of Ethiopia. He sent troops {{under the command of}} General Arnaldo Ochoa to aid the overwhelmed Ethiopian army. After forcing back the Somalis, Mengistu then ordered the Ethiopians to suppress the Eritrean People's Liberation Front, a measure Castro refused to support. Castro extended support to Latin American revolutionary movements, namely the Sandinista National Liberation Front in its overthrow of the Nicaraguan rightist government of Anastasio Somoza Debayle in July 1979. Castro's critics accused the government of wasting Cuban lives in these military endeavors; the anti-Castro Center for a Free Cuba has claimed that an estimated 14,000 Cubans were killed in foreign Cuban military actions. When U.S. state critics claimed that Castro had no right to interfere in these nations, he countered that Cuba had been invited into them, <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> U.S.' own involvement in various foreign nations.|$|E
5|$|It seems {{relatively}} {{certain that}} the Persian fleet was sent out to block the exit from the Straits the evening before the battle. Herodotus clearly believed that the Persian fleet actually entered the Straits at nightfall, planning to catch the Allies as they fled. However, modern historians have greatly debated this point, with some <b>pointing</b> <b>out</b> <b>the</b> difficulties of maneuvering in this confined space by night, and others accepting Herodotus's version. There are thus two possibilities; that during the night the Persians simply blocked the exit to the Straits, and then entered the straits in daylight; or that they entered the straits and positioned themselves for battle during the night. Regardless of when they attempted it, {{it seems likely that}} the Persians pivoted their fleet off the tip of Cape Vavari, so that from an initial east-west alignment (blocking the exit), they came round to a north-south alignment (see diagram). The Persian fleet seems to have been formed into three ranks of ships (according to Aeschylus); with the powerful Phoenician fleet on the right flank next to Mount Aigaleo, the Ionian contingent on the left flank and the other contingents in the centre.|$|E
