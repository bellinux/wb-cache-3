30|$|The <b>pexiganan</b> peptide recombinantly {{produced}} {{in this work}} (MBC ≈  16  µg/mL) showed an effective antimicrobial activity similar to the chemically-synthesized <b>pexiganan</b> peptide (MBC ≈  16  µg/mL) (Fig.  8). Previous work on the antimicrobial mechanism of <b>pexiganan</b> has revealed that the antimicrobial activity of <b>pexiganan</b> results from the unrepairable damage of bacteria membrane. <b>Pexiganan</b> peptides associate with the lipid head group of membranes and induce toroidal-pores in the membrane at a threshold concentration (Yang et al. 2001).

40|$|<b>Pexiganan,</b> a 22 -amino-acid {{antimicrobial}} peptide, is {{an analog}} of the magainin peptides {{isolated from the}} skin of the African clawed frog. <b>Pexiganan</b> exhibited in vitro broad-spectrum antibacterial activity when it was tested against 3, 109 clinical isolates of gram-positive and gram-negative, anaerobic and aerobic bacteria. The <b>pexiganan</b> MIC at which 90 % of isolates are inhibited (MIC 90) was 32 μg/ml or less for Staphylococcus spp., Streptococcus spp., Enterococcus faecium, Corynebacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp., Acinetobacter spp., Stenotrophomonas spp., certain species of the family Enterobacteriaceae, Bacteroides spp., Peptostreptococcus spp., and Propionibacterium spp. Comparison of the MICs and minimum bactericidal concentrations (MBCs) of <b>pexiganan</b> for 143 isolates representing 32 species demonstrated that for 92 % of the isolates tested, MBCs were the same or within 1 twofold difference of the MICs, consistent with a bactericidal mechanism of action. Killing curve analysis showed that <b>pexiganan</b> killed Pseudomonas aeruginosa rapidly, with 106 organisms/ml eliminated within 20 min of treatment with 16 μg of <b>pexiganan</b> per ml. No evidence of cross-resistance to a number of other antibiotic classes was observed, as determined by the equivalence of the MIC 50 s and the MIC 90 s of <b>pexiganan</b> for strains resistant to oxacillin, cefazolin, cefoxitin, imipenem, ofloxacin, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, and clindamicin versus those for strains susceptible to these antimicrobial agents.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to probe the {{potential}} anti-H. pylori activity of the synthetic antimicrobial peptide <b>pexiganan,</b> which is an analog of the peptide magainin, and its nanoparticles (PNPs) that were prepared in our laboratory. To compare their antibacterial effects in vitro and in vivo, studies of H. pylori growth inhibition, kinetics and resistance assays were undertaken. The gastric mucoadhesive efficiency and H. pylori clearance efficiency of <b>pexiganan</b> and PNPs were evaluated in rats and mice infected with H. pylori. The eradication of H. pylori was determined using urease tests and a microbial culture method. We observed that PNPs adhered to gastric mucosa more effectively owing to a prolonged stay in the stomach, which resulted in a more effective H. pylori clearance. In addition, PNPs had greater anti-H. pylori effect than <b>pexiganan</b> in infected mice. The amount of <b>pexiganan</b> required to eradicate H. pylori was significantly less using PNPs than the corresponding <b>pexiganan</b> suspension. The results confirmed that PNPs improved peptide stability in the stomach and more effectively eradicated H. pylori from mice stomachs than <b>pexiganan...</b>|$|E
30|$|Recently, we used {{a variant}} of DAMP 4 protein as a carrier to the {{antimicrobial}} <b>pexiganan</b> peptide (Zhao et al. 2015). The fusion protein DAMP 4 var-pexiganan [M(EPS MKQLADSLHQLARQVSRLEHA) 4 DPS GIGKFLKKAKKFGKAFVKILKKHH] has a molecular weight (MW) of 14.1  kDa and an isoelectric point (pI) of 10.7 (Zhao et al. 2015). <b>Pexiganan</b> (GIGKFLKKAKKFGKAFVKILKK) is a cationic peptide and shows attractive antimicrobial characteristics against both Gram-negative and Gram-positive bacteria (Ge et al. 1999). The four-helix bundle structure of DAMP 4 var was shown capable of protecting <b>pexiganan</b> peptide from degradation when the fusion protein was expressed in the E. coli system, and allowed for introduction of process-relevant features to the fusion protein to simplify purification. The D-P-S linker allowed a simple cleavage method to release <b>pexiganan</b> from the fusion protein due to the deamidation reaction at the D-P site under conditions of low pH and high temperature (Hamada and Swanson 1994). In our previous work, we reported that this fusion protein {{can be used to}} produce <b>pexiganan</b> via the same purification method as for DAMP 4 with acid-cleavage (Zhao et al. 2015). However, only a small amount of <b>pexiganan</b> at a low purity was obtained using the published approach.|$|E

30|$|In this work, we {{developed}} a new downstream process to produce <b>pexiganan</b> peptide with high purity and high yield. This work builds upon the purification process of another DAMP 4 -based fusion protein, D 4 S 2 (Wibowo et al. 2017). This novel method consists of (i) purification of fusion proteins based on the selective thermochemical precipitation, (ii) the acid-cleavage of fusion proteins to release the peptides and (iii) separation of targeted peptides via isoelectric precipitation. Our method results in a yield of bio-produced and purified <b>pexiganan</b> of around 1.6  mg from 800  mL bacterial cell culture (final cultivation OD 600 ~  2), which accounts for 31 % recovery of the theoretical yield of <b>pexiganan.</b> This recovery is twice the recovery obtained from the previous methods producing antimicrobial peptides which have similar physicochemical properties (Jang et al. 2009).|$|E
30|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} (AMPs) {{have significant}} potential as alternatives to classical antibiotics. However, AMPs are currently prepared using processes {{which are often}} laborious, expensive and of low-yield, thus hindering their research and application. Large-scale methods for production of AMPs using a cost-effective approach is urgently required. In this study, we report a scalable, chromatography-free downstream processing method for producing an antimicrobial peptide, <b>pexiganan,</b> using recombinant Escherichia coli (E. coli). The four helix bundle structure of the unique carrier protein DAMP 4 was used to facilitate a simple and cheap purification process based on a selective thermochemical precipitation. Highly pure fusion protein DAMP 4 var-pexiganan was obtained at high yield (around 24  mg per 800  mL cell culture with a final cultivation OD 600 ~  2). The purification yield of DAMP 4 var-pexiganan protein is increased twofold with a 72.9 % of the protein recovery in this study {{as compared to the}} previous purification processes (Dwyer in Chem Eng Sci 105 : 12 – 21, 2014). The antimicrobial peptide <b>pexiganan</b> was released and activated from the fusion protein by a simple acid-cleavage. Isoelectric precipitation was then applied to separate the <b>pexiganan</b> peptide from the DAMP 4 var protein carrier. The final yield of pure bio-produced <b>pexiganan</b> was 1.6  mg from 800  mL of bacterial cell culture (final cultivation OD 600 ~  2). The minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) test demonstrated that the bio-produced <b>pexiganan</b> has the same antimicrobial activity as chemically synthesized counterpart. This novel downstream process provides a new strategy for simple and probable economic production of antimicrobial peptides.|$|E
30|$|HCl {{was added}} to the {{purified}} DAMP 4 var-pexiganan protein to a final pH of 4, and then incubated at 60  °C with incubation times varied from 1 to 48  h to optimize the cleavage of <b>pexiganan</b> peptide from DAMP 4 var-pexiganan protein. Subsequently, an aqueous solution of 2  M NaOH was added into the solution (final pH 6.8) and incubated at room temperature for 30  min to induce the precipitation of cleaved DAMP 4 var protein (theoretical pI 6.8). Supernatant containing <b>pexiganan</b> peptide was collected by centrifugation (38, 000 ×g, 4  °C, 10  min), and then desalted against water by using an ÄKTA Explorer 10 system equipped with a 5 -mL column of Sephadex G- 25 resin (GE Healthcare, UK).|$|E

The peptides were synthesized using solid-phase method and purified by high-performance liquid chromatography. Biological tests were performed using the broth microdilution method. The antifungal activity of the peptide antibiotics was compared to that of nystatin and amphotericin B. We found synthetic peptides to be generally less potent than amphotericin B or nystatin. However, some of the naturally occurring peptides still retained reasonable antifungal activities which were higher than these of iseganan, <b>pexiganan</b> or omiganan.

40|$|This thesis {{comprises}} two parts, both {{concerned with}} the study of Escherichia coli bacterial suspensions. The first part investigates E. coli motility whilst the second part explores E. coli growth {{in the presence of}} the antimicrobial peptide <b>pexiganan.</b> In Part 1 I measure the three-dimensional diffusion of non-motile cells in an active suspension of E. coli, using Differential Dynamic Microscopy (DDM). It is found that tracer diffusivity is enhanced linearly as a function of the bath activity, defined as the product of the number density of active bacteria and their average speed. The absolute enhancement is measured to be 1 : 8 ± 0 : 1 times smaller that that published previously in the vicinity of a surface, in agreement with theoretical predictions of enhanced diffusion by far-field advection. The diffusivities of non-motile mutants with and without paralysed flagella are enhanced to the same extent, despite a difference in hydrodynamic radii. In addition, the protocol for growing, preparing and measuring motile E. coli is optimised using DDM. In Part 2 I investigate how E. coli density in liquid media supplemented with <b>pexiganan</b> influences the measurement of its Minimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC). Growth curves, peptide bioassays and single cell microscopy are used. It is found that population density drops rapidly when <b>pexiganan</b> is introduced, but regrowth occurs within 24 hours at sub-MIC concentrations. The shape of the density curve is explained by peptide depletion linked to cell death and immediate recovery of cells exposed to the peptide. As expected from these findings, the system displays a substantial inoculum effect, quantified with a fitted power law. Substantial variation is seen between replicate MIC assays; an inherent property of the system which derives from the drop to small numbers of viable cells before regrowth. Finally, I show that DDM measurements of E. coli motility in antimicrobial peptides can provide an alternative, high-throughput density curve...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{growing problem}} of {{bacterial}} resistance to conventional antibiotic compounds {{and the need}} for new antibiotics have stimulated interest in the development of antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) as human therapeutics. Development of topically applied agents, such as <b>pexiganan</b> (also known as MSI- 78, an analog of the naturally occurring magainin 2, extracted from the skin of the African frog Xenopus laevis) {{has been the focus of}} pharmaceutical development largely because of the relative safety of topical therapy and the uncertainty surrounding the long-term toxicology of any new class of drug administered systemically. The main hurdle that has hindered the development of antimicrobial peptides is that many of the naturally occurring peptides (such as magainin), although active in vitro, are effective in animal models of infection only at very high doses, often close to the toxic doses of the peptide, reflecting an unacceptable margin of safety. Though MSI- 78 did not pass the FDA approval, it is still the best-studied AMP to date for therapeutic purposes. Biophysical studies have shown that this peptide is unstructured in solution, forms an antiparallel dimer of amphipathic helices upon binding to the membrane, and disrupts membrane via toroidal-type pore formation. This article covers functional, biophysical, biochemical and structural studies on <b>pexiganan...</b>|$|E

Briefly, a single colony of E. coli ATCC® 25922 ™ (Manassas, VA) selected from a freshly streaked plate was inoculated into 5  mL Mueller-Hinton (MH) Broth (Becton–Dickinson, Sparks, MD) at 37  °C, 180  rpm, and then harvested at the exponential growth phase (OD 600 ~  0.5). After rinsing the cells twice by centrifugation (4000 ×g, 4  °C, 20  min), a standard cell suspension was prepared by resuspending the cell pellet in 0.9 % NaCl solution to a final concentration of 107 colony-forming units (CFU) per mL (OD 600 ~  0.08). Protein/peptide samples (at final concentrations ranging from 1 to 32  µg/mL) as well as water were added into the standard cell suspensions to a final volume of 2  mL. Following incubation at 37  °C, 180  rpm for 2  h, the mixtures (diluted 10, 000 × in sterilized water) were each spread onto MH agar plates (MH Broth, 1.5 % agar) and then incubated at 37  °C for overnight.

40|$|The {{evolution}} of resistance against antimicrobial peptides {{has long been}} considered unlikely due to their mechanism of action, yet experimental selection with antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) results in rapid {{evolution of}} resistance in several species of bacteria. Although numerous studies have utilized mutant screens to identify loci that determine AMP susceptibility, there is a dearth of data concerning the genomic changes that accompany experimental evolution of AMP resistance. Using genome resequencing, we analyzed the mutations that arose during experimental evolution {{of resistance to the}} cationic AMPs iseganan, melittin, and <b>pexiganan,</b> as well as to a combination of melittin and <b>pexiganan,</b> or to the aminoglycoside antibiotic streptomycin. Analysis of 17 independently replicated Staphylococcus aureus selection lines, including unselected controls, showed that each AMP selected for mutations at distinct loci. We identify mutations in genes involved in the synthesis and maintenance of the cell envelope. These include genes previously identified from mutant screens for AMP resistance, and genes involved in the response to AMPs and cell-wall-active antibiotics. Furthermore, transposon insertion mutants were used to verify that a number of the identified genes are directly involved in determining AMP susceptibility. Strains selected for AMP resistance under controlled experimental evolution displayed consistent AMP-specific mutations in genes that determine AMP susceptibility. This suggests that different routes to evolve resistance are favored within a controlled genetic background...|$|E

A 75  % reduction in pin site infections was achieved with the titanium–pexiganan group in comparison with the titanium control group (p =  0.019).

We expect that this new method could offer a cost-effective and high-yield approach which can be easily generalized and adapted to recover and purify other antimicrobial peptides from microbial cell factories. It {{should be noted that the}} described methods might not be suitable for facilitating the purification of large proteins such as enzymes, as these purification conditions might change the tertiary conformational structures of the proteins which can result in the loss of protein functionalities.|$|E
40|$|A novel {{class of}} {{antibiotics}} {{based on the}} antimicrobial properties of immune peptides of multicellular organisms is attracting increasing interest as a major weapon against resistant microbes. It has been claimed that cationic antimicrobial peptides exploit fundamental features of the bacterial cell so that resistance is {{much less likely to}} evolve than in the case of conventional antibiotics. Population models of the evolutionary genetics of resistance have cast doubt on this claim. We document the experimental evolution of resistance to a cationic antimicrobial peptide through continued selection in the laboratory. In this selection experiment, 22 / 24 lineages of Escherichia coli and Pseudomonas fluorescens independently evolved heritable mechanisms of resistance to <b>pexiganan,</b> an analogue of magainin, when propagated in medium supplemented with this antimicrobial peptide for 600 – 700 generations...|$|E
30|$|Unlike most peptide {{cleavage}} that uses, for example, hazardous cyanogen bromide (Zhou et al. 2005) or expensive enzyme (Huang et al. 2006), the DPS linker within DAMP 4 var-pexiganan protein {{provides an}} easily achievable cleavage method {{to produce the}} <b>pexiganan</b> via acid-cleavage between D and P residues in the DPS linker of the fusion protein under a mild heating condition (60  °C, pH 4, 48  h) (Dimitrijev-Dwyer et al. 2012) (Fig.  6). The bio-produced PS-pexiganan peptide (pI 11.2) can then be simply separated from DAMP 4 var protein (pI 6.8) based on the differences in their isoelectric points (Fig.  7). By adjusting the solution pH to 6.8, the number {{of positive and negative}} charges on DAMP 4 var protein is nearly equal and thus prone to undergo precipitation. Meanwhile, the bio-produced peptides were still soluble due to their ionic repulsion at pH 6.8.|$|E
40|$|We {{describe}} a novel prokaryotic expression {{system for the}} production of cationic antimicrobial peptides (AMPs). The method relies on a translationally coupled two-cistron system, in which the termination codon for the first cistron (which encodes the anionic polypeptide mIFc 2, a derivative of human gamma interferon) overlaps with the initiation codon for the second cistron (which encodes a cationic AMP) in the sequence of 5 ′-TAATG- 3 ′. By forming an insoluble complex with the AMP upon translation, the mIFc 2 protein efficiently neutralized the toxicity of the coexpressed cationic AMP and minimized the sensitivity of AMP to proteolytic degradation in a host. The AMPs were retrieved from the insoluble inclusion bodies without any chemical or enzymatic cleavage step by simple cation-exchange chromatography. With our system, ∼ 100 mg of various AMPs (buforin IIb, parasin I, and <b>pexiganan)</b> were obtained from 1 liter of Escherichia coli culture.

40|$|Antimicrobial {{peptides}} (AMPs) {{and their}} mimics are emerging as promising antibiotic agents. We present {{a library of}} “ampetoids” (antimicrobial peptoid oligomers) with helical structures and biomimetic sequences, several members of which have low-micromolar antimicrobial activities, similar to cationic AMPs like <b>pexiganan.</b> Broad-spectrum activity against six clinically relevant BSL 2 pathogens is also shown. This comprehensive structure–activity relationship study, including circular dichroism spectroscopy, minimum inhibitory concentration assays, hemolysis and mammalian cell toxicity studies, and specular x-ray reflectivity measurements shows that the in vitro activities of ampetoids are strikingly {{similar to those of}} AMPs themselves, suggesting a strong mechanistic analogy. The ampetoids' antibacterial activity, coupled with their low cytotoxicity against mammalian cells, make them a promising class of antimicrobials for biomedical applications. Peptoids are biostable, with a protease-resistant N-substituted glycine backbone, and their sequences are highly tunable, because an extensive diversity of side chains can be incorporated via facile solid-phase synthesis. Our findings add to the growing evidence that nonnatural foldamers will emerge as an important class of therapeutics...|$|E
30|$|The bio-produced <b>pexiganan</b> peptide was {{separated}} from the DAMP 4 var protein by precipitation based on the differences in their isoelectric points. The theoretical isoelectric points (pI) of DAMP 4 var protein and PS-pexiganan peptide are 6.8 and 11.2, respectively. By adjusting the solution pH to 6.8, the DAMP 4 var protein precipitated and the PS-pexiganan peptide remained in the bulk phase. The resultant supernatants after centrifugation were analyzed by RP-HPLC which showed two peaks at retention time of 15 and 30  min (Fig.  7). Based on the previous characterization study on the cleavage of DAMP 4 var-pexiganan protein (Zhao et al. 2015), we confirmed that the peaks at 15 and 30  min correspond to PS-pexiganan peptide and DAMP 4 var protein, respectively, indicating the successful cleavage of PS-pexiganan peptide. A yield of 3.2  mg PS-pexiganan peptides was achieved from 800  mL cell culture (OD 600 ~  2) with a 62 % of recovery. After the desalting process, the final yield of PS-pexiganan was 1.6  mg, achieving 31 % of overall recovery.|$|E
30|$|Although AMPs have broad {{spectrum}} of antimicrobial activity, the therapeutic applications of them still have many limitations, such as cytotoxicity, instability and high cost. Many antimicrobial peptides have cytotoxicity to mammalian cells at high concentrations, which {{may be due to}} membrane cracking mechanism (Marr et al. 2006). Moreover, AMPs could be degraded or removed by the endogenous protease or secreted by organism before arriving at the action sites. Therefore, their antimicrobial activities were greatly reduced or completely lost (Bowdish et al. 2005; Maisetta et al. 2008). The first commercial AMP was <b>pexiganan</b> acetate (MSI- 78) which was an α-helical magainin variant peptide.

BPI is a cationic protein from human neutrophil-derives which has antibacterial activity has just entered phase-III clinical trials (Ge et al. 1999; Hancock and Lehrer 1998). And up to now, no one have obtained US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval, except gramicidin for topical administrations (Steckbeck et al. 2014).|$|E
40|$|We {{subjected}} Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 to serial {{passage in}} the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of magainin 2 and gramicidin D for several hundred generations. We obtained S. aureus strains with induced resistance to magainin 2 (strain 55 MG) and gramicidin D (strain 55 GR) that showed different phenotypic changes in membrane properties. Both exhibited a change in membrane phospholipid content and an increase in membrane rigidity, while an alteration in net charge compared to that of the control occurred only in the case of 55 MG. The growing problem of resistance to conventional antibioticsin pathogens like Staphylococcus aureus and the need for new alternatives has stimulated interest in the development of antimi-crobial peptides (AMPs) as human therapeutics (1). This has led to many AMPs, such as <b>pexiganan</b> (analogue of magainin), grami-cidins, polymyxin, nisin, daptomycin, and defensin-mimetic mol-ecule, being entered into clinical trials (2 – 6). However, it has been argued in several in vitro studies and recent reports that the use of AMPs in therapeutic amounts {{over an extended period of}} time might lead to reduced susceptibility due to adaptive changes in phenotypic and genotypic characteristics of the organism (7 – 13) ...|$|E
30|$|Continued {{focus on}} {{materials}} development and novel methods of prophylactic antibiotic administration may provide insights {{that can be}} tested further in human clinical trials. Specifically, efforts are being made to produce an improved pin coating that has antimicrobial properties. This would have implications for external fixation but would revolutionize internal fixation for use over a site of previous pin use and for routine use as a prophylactic measure against infection. The findings of Chou et al. [9] are intriguing; topical <b>pexiganan</b> acetate applied to pin sites resulted in a 75  % decrease in pin site infections in a rabbit model. DeJong et al. [13] found that the pin site infection rate was significantly decreased by adding a coating of chlorhexidine, hydroxyapatite, and lipid to titanium and stainless steel pins implanted into goat tibiae. The coated pins had a 4.2  % infection rate and 12.5  % colonization rate at 14  days after inoculating the pin sites with S. aureus, {{in contrast to the}} 100  % infection rate in the uncoated pins (p <  0.01). Although the extraction torque of the coated pins decreased over the 14 -day study period, it was superior to the uncoated pins. These results suggest that this coating may be a viable option {{to reduce the risk of}} infection while maintaining a stable interface with bone. In an in vitro study by Chen et al. [8], a silver-containing HA pin coating was shown to decrease S. aureus and S. epidermidis adhesion in comparison with plain titanium pins without increased cytotoxicity to precursor osteoblast cells. The prevention measures tested in the Chou [9], DeJong [13], and Chen [8] studies, which seem promising in vitro or in animal models, would need to be shown to be effective in patients.|$|E
40|$|Objectives: To review {{systematically}} {{the evidence}} {{on the performance of}} diagnostic tests used to identify infection in diabetic foot ulcers (DFUs) and of interventions to treat infected DFUs. To use estimates derived from the systematic reviews to create a decision analytic model in order to identify the most effective method of diagnosing and treating infection and to identify areas of research that would lead to large reductions in clinical uncertainty. Data sources: Electronic databases covering period from inception of the database to November 2002. Review methods: Selected studies were assessed against validated criteria and described in a narrative review. The structure of a decision analytic model was derived for two groups of patients in whom diagnostic tests were likely to be used. Results: Three studies that investigated the performance of diagnostic tests for infection on populations including people with DFUs found that {{there was no evidence that}} single items on a clinical examination checklist were reliable in identifying infection in DFUs, that wound swabs perform poorly against wound biopsies, and that semi-quantitative analysis of wound swabs may be a useful alternative to quantitative analysis. However, few people with DFUs were included, so it was not possible to tell whether diagnostic performance differs for DFUs relative to wounds of other aetiologies. Twenty-three studies investigated the effectiveness (n = 23) or cost-effectiveness (n = 2) of antimicrobial agents for DFUs. Eight studied intravenous antibiotics, five oral antibiotics, four different topical agents such as dressings, four subcutaneous granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF), one evaluated oral and topical Ayurvedic preparations and one compared topical sugar versus antibiotics versus standard care. The majority of trials were underpowered and were too dissimilar to be pooled. There was no strong evidence for recommending any particular antimicrobial agent for the prevention of amputation, resolution of infection or ulcer healing. Topical <b>pexiganan</b> cream may be as effective as oral antibiotic treatment with ofloxacin for the resolution of local infection. Ampicillin and sulbactam were less costly than imipenem and cilastatin, a growth factor (G-CSF) was less costly than standard care and cadexomer iodine dressings may be less costly than daily dressings. A decision analytic model was derived for two groups of people, those for whom diagnostic testing would inform treatment people with ulcers which do not appear infected but whose ulcer is not progressing despite optimal concurrent treatment - and those in whom a first course of antibiotics (prescribed empirically) have failed. There was insufficient information from the systematic reviews or interviews with experts to populate the model with transition probabilities for the sensitivity and specificity of diagnosis of infection in DFUs. Similarly, there was insufficient information on the probabilities of healing, amputation or death in the intervention studies for the two populations of interest. Therefore, we were unable to run the model to inform the most effective diagnostic and treatment strategy. Conclusions: The available evidence is too weak to be able to draw reliable implications for practice. This means that, in terms of diagnosis, infection in DFUs cannot be reliably identified using clinical assessment. This has implications for determining which patients need formal diagnostic testing for infection, on whether empirical treatment with antibiotics (before the results of diagnostic tests are available) leads to better outcomes, and on identifying the optimal methods of diagnostic testing. With respect to treatment, it is not known whether treatment with systemic or local antibiotics leads to better outcomes or whether any particular agent is more effective. Limited evidence suggests that both G-CSF and cadexomer iodine dressings may be less expensive than 'standard' care, that ampicillin/ sulbactam may be less costly than imipenem/ cilastatin, and that an unlicensed cream (<b>pexiganan)</b> may be as effective as oral ofloxacin. Further research is needed to ascertain the characteristics of infection in people with DFUs that influence healing and amputation outcomes, to determine whether detecting infection prior to treatment offers any benefit over empirical therapy, and to establish the most effective and cost-effective methods for detecting infection, as well as the relative effectiveness and cost-effectiveness of antimicrobial interventions for DFU infection. ...|$|E
