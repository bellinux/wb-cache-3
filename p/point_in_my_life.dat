40|$|There exist several user {{interface}} widgets that grow or expand {{in response to}} the user’s fo-cus of attention. Some of these expand to facilitate their selection, allowing for a reduced initial size in an attempt to optimize screen space use. However, selection performance could plausibly suffer from a decreased initial widget size. We describe an experiment in which users select a single, isolated target button that expands just before it is selected. Our results suggest that users are able to take approximately full advantage of the ex-panded target size, even if the target only begins expanding after 90 % of the movement towards the target has been completed. For interfaces with multiple expanding widgets, however, care must be taken to mitigate the collisions or overlap that may occur between adjacent widgets. We present a number of design strategies that attempt to optimize the performance of multiple, tiled expanding targets. ii Acknowledgements One of the more significant turning <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> was <b>my</b> first day as a student hire at Alias|wavefront in 1996.

Being able to tell a story is one thing, but being able to tell a story well and in writing is another. The focus of my project is retrospective writing. The six written essays will be from the age of five when I entered first grade through my college years. A series of pictures will correlate with each essay. This will allow the reader of my work to compare their personal image to the real image from <b>points</b> <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life.</b> The six essays will also highlight significant moments <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> as well as my most vivid memories. Essentially, “a picture is worth a thousand words. ” The progression of these essays will allow me to improve my writing through editing, tone, and style. As a student at the University of Rhode Island, I have learned the importance of being well-rounded. For the {{past four years}} as a major in Bio Science, most of <b>my</b> writing was <b>in</b> research and lab report format. For my Senior Honors Project, I chose a storytelling format to be more creative <b>in</b> <b>my</b> writing. <b>My</b> time spent <b>in</b> English 243, The Short Story, inspired me to complete this project. Dr. Barbara Conti, the professor of this course, provided me with excellent feedback on the required writing assignments from her course and I wanted to do more. Dr. Conti and I have been able to bounce ideas off one another so that the essays are both well organized and well written. My final pieces will showcase a mixture of reflection and emotion.

I have always been aware of two <b>points</b> of view <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> and have spent much emotional energy balancing this tension. This dissertation provided me with an avenue to examine the visions of artists of Dutch Canadian heritage who, like myself, experienced this dualism. Their literary expressions of this dualism permitted me to explore the inherent tensions and determine what unique resolutions they may have discovered along the way. The Canadian attitude to the ethnic and cultural diversity in our society is a changing one. Our federal government takes pride in Canada's multicultural mosaic, recognizing it as a rich resource in which all Canadians share. The ethnic dimension of Canadian society, past and present, is one that needs examination if we are to understand fully the contours and nature of Canadian society and identity. Studies of Canadian history and literature have been largely controlled by the people of British or French origin. Due perhaps to fewer numbers, difference in keenness of sense of origin and identity, the immigrant experience itself, and the sheer force of Canadianism, other groups have been relatively silent until quite recently. Groups such as the Dutch, who have established themselves in Canada within the last hundred years or so, have traditions, values and visions they cherish, and particular members of this group have begun to express those in imaginative works...|$|R

So that was a big <b>point</b> for me <b>in</b> <b>my</b> <b>life</b> and career.When you make films in different places, you need to find the mercenary warriors to help you make the film, because no man is an island.

So a group of professionals plus a tremendous amount of support from Italy, because the Italian government and the Chinese were very close. So there was a bonding between the Italians and Chinese. In fact the British Council and British Embassy were rather hands off when we arrived there, they came to claim it later but... If an Emperor can become a gardener then what better, and one day they will tell this story. And then we came and we told that story.

It was terrifying but it happened.The difficult thing about the success of that film was that it was a difficult film to emulate, and I have never been to that pinnacle of a certain type of film.
