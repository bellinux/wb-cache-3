5|$|Initially, {{the caps}} {{are covered by}} a peridium—an outer {{covering}} layer of tissue. After the fruit body matures and begins to dry out, {{the lower part of}} the <b>peridium</b> starts to rip, usually starting from small longitudinal slits near where the <b>peridium</b> attaches to the top of the stem. However, the pattern of tearing is variable; in some instances, the slits may appear higher up on the <b>peridium,</b> in others, the <b>peridium</b> rips more irregularly. The <b>peridium</b> may also rip in such a way that it appears as if there is a ring at the top of the stem. The torn <b>peridium</b> exposes the internal gleba. The gleba is divided into wavy plates or lamellae, some of which are fused together to form irregular chambers. The gleba is a drab brown to blackish-brown color, and it becomes tough and brittle as it dries out. The flesh is firm when young, white, and will stain light to bright yellow when it is bruised.|$|E
5|$|Crucibulum {{species have}} light tan to cinnamon-colored fruiting bodies, {{known as a}} <b>peridium,</b> that are cup- or crucible-shaped. Depending on the species, {{the size of the}} <b>peridium</b> may range from 2–4tall by 1.5–3mm wide at the mouth (for C.parvulum) to 5–10mm tall by 5–8mm wide (for C.laeve). Viewed microscopically, the wall of the <b>peridium</b> is made of a single layer of tissue, in {{contrast}} to the three-layered <b>peridium</b> wall in Cyathus species. The outer surface of the <b>peridium</b> has hyphae that agglutinate so as to form a texture with visible filaments, a condition known as fibrillose; this outer layers of hairs typically wears off with age to leave a relatively smooth surface. Young specimens have a thin layer of tissue called an epiphragm that covers the top of the peridium; it wears off at maturity to expose the peridioles within. There are usually 4–6 peridioles (up to 15 have been noted for C.laeve) that are disc-shaped, whitish in color, and attached to the endoperidium by a strand called a funicular cord. Made of mycelia, The funicular cord tends to wither away and disappear as the fruiting body ages. Spores from Crucibulum species typically have an elliptical or roughly spherical shape, and are thick-walled, transclucent (hyaline) or light yellow-brown in color, with dimensions of 5–15 by 5–8µm. the spores of C.cyathiforme are notably slightly or strongly curved.|$|E
5|$|Pallidus group: Species with conspicuous, long, downward-pointing hairs, and {{a smooth}} (non-plicate) inner <b>peridium.</b>|$|E

5|$|The {{manner in}} which the puffball splits open (dehisces) has been {{described}} by 19th-century American mycologist William Henry Long. The thick and leathery <b>peridium</b> of the mature puffball remains unopened for several months without splitting. After several alternating cycles of wetting and drying, fissures develop across the top. These fissures usually radiate from a common center {{near the top of the}} fruit body and finally produce very irregular star-like teeth. In time, the entire upper half of the puffball is open and exposed during dry weather. In this condition, the spores are blown out by the wind and widely distributed. During every rainy spell the puffball promptly closes only to open again when dry weather returns. At each alternate opening and closing the <b>peridium</b> is split more and more, until finally it is expanded into a flat shape, or even curls backward. In the puffball, the outer layer of the <b>peridium</b> comprises cells arranged so that when wet they adsorb water and expand, thus closing the top of the puffball. Upon drying, these outer cells lose water and gradually shrink, thus producing an unequal tension between the outer and inner cells of the <b>peridium.</b> This tension causes the irregular star-like pieces of the <b>peridium</b> to gradually separate and curve outward, thus opening the top of the puffball during dry weather.|$|E
5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} L.incarnatum are tiny, oval to roughly spherical, and measure 35–1250 by 200–450μm. The {{floating}} balls are sometimes enclosed {{in a loose}} subiculum, with a whitish surface that is byssoid (consisting of fine threads). The <b>peridium</b> (the outer protective tissue layer) is 18–30μm thick, byssoid, and made of clamped hyphae typically 2.5–4μm in diameter intertwined with dendrophyses (irregularly branched cystidia) 1μm in diameter. The surface of the <b>peridium</b> is hydrophobic, a feature that helps keep water off the growing hymenium during its development, and gives the fruit body buoyancy.|$|E
5|$|Because {{of their}} thick outer <b>peridium,</b> Mycenastrum corium puffballs can {{withstand}} hard blows without breaking, and children have used them as replacements for balls. The puffballs {{have also been}} used medicinally in Mexico as a hemostatic, as a throat and lung tonic, and for their purported anti-inflammatory properties.|$|E
5|$|Fruit bodies {{arise from}} the tips or the lateral {{branches}} or rhizomorphs. New fruit bodies are made of an exterior of thick hyphae {{similar to those found}} in the rhizomorph core; in contrast, the hyphae of the interior originate from the puffball's core. Unlike some other puffball species, the <b>peridium</b> does not differentiate into a distinct exoperidium and endoperidium; rather, the outer layer develops the features of a pseudoparenchyma (a tightly organised tissue where the tightly packed cells resemble plant parenchyma) as the radial and tangential hyphae become interweaved. In time, the <b>peridium</b> dries and falls off in flakes to expose the underlying gleba.|$|E
5|$|Leucangium carthusianum, the Oregon black truffle, {{is roughly}} similar in appearance, habitat, and growing season, {{but can be}} {{distinguished}} by its darker (charcoal black) <b>peridium.</b> Microscopically, the spores of Leucangium are larger (60–90μm) and have a single large oil droplet. L.carthusianum is also edible and prized for its taste and aroma.|$|E
5|$|The inner <b>peridium</b> {{is a thin}} shiny {{tissue that}} is {{depressed}} into areas demarcated by the pyramidal plates. The puffball base, which occupies about a third to {{a quarter of the}} bottom of the fruit body, consists of moderately-sized chambers that persist even after the gleba has matured and the spores have dispersed. The base can assume a purplish hue after weathering. The base is rooted into the soil with rhizomorphs. Initially white, the gleba turns color from yellow to golden brown to dark brown as the spores mature. As the gleba dries, the inner <b>peridium</b> dries and cracks, exposing the spore mass in cracks between the scales. The gleba is supported by a yellowish-brown to light brown subgleba.|$|E
5|$|Tuber oregonense {{closely resembles}} Tuber gibbosum, which {{grows in the}} same habitats, but may be {{distinguished}} by the structure of its <b>peridium,</b> and differences in spores size and shape. Further, Tuber gibbosum grows from January to June.|$|E
5|$|Mature {{specimens}} of Battarrea phalloides roughly resemble the typical agaric mushroom stature of stem and cap. However, {{rather than a}} cap with gills, this species has a spore sac atop the stem. When young, the fruit body is roughly spherical and completely encased in an outer wall (exoperidium) that later splits in a circumscissile fashion (along a circular or equatorial line), the lower wall forming a volva and the upper part forming scales that cover the inner wall. The upper part rolls upward and backward and eventually falls away in one piece, exposing a spore sac lined with a narrow ring of capillitium and spores. The spores are sticky. As these are carried away by the wind, the drying action of the latter cause {{the edges of the}} <b>peridium</b> to shrivel and roll up more, exposing more spores. This is continued until the upper half of the <b>peridium</b> has shriveled and blown away and there remains only a few spores, which may be washed away by rain.|$|E
5|$|Peridioles are {{attached}} to the fruiting body by a funiculus, a structure of hyphae that may be differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the <b>peridium,</b> the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at one end to the peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. In Crucibulum species the peridioles is covered by a whitish tunica. The funiculus of Crucibulum species is markedly different from those of Cyathus species: in Crucibulum, the purse is a rounded knob 0.3–0.5mm wide, attached to the underside of the peridiole. Attaching the purse directly to the wall of the <b>peridium</b> is a stout yellow-grey cord 0.1mm wide and about 2.5mm long.|$|E
5|$|Species in {{the genus}} Cyathus have fruit bodies (peridia) that are vase-, trumpet- or urn-shaped with {{dimensions}} of 4–8mm wide by 7–18mm tall. Fruit bodies are brown to gray-brown in color, {{and covered with}} small hair-like structures on the outer surface. Some species, like C.striatus and C.setosus, have conspicuous bristles called setae {{on the rim of}} the cup. The fruit body is often expanded at the base into a solid rounded mass of hyphae called an emplacement, which typically becomes tangled and entwined with small fragments of the underlying growing surface, improving its stability and helping it from being knocked over by rain. Immature fruit bodies have a whitish membrane, an epiphragm, that covers the <b>peridium</b> opening when young, but eventually dehisces, breaking open during maturation. Viewed with a microscope, the <b>peridium</b> of Cyathus species is made of three distinct layers—the endo-, meso-, and ectoperidium, referring to the inner, middle, and outer layers respectively. While the surface of the ectoperidium in Cyathus is usually hairy, the endoperidial surface is smooth, and depending on the species, may have longitudinal grooves (striations).|$|E
5|$|Alexander H. Smith {{described}} a variety, Calbovista subsculpta var. fumosa, in 1965, {{based on a}} collection he made in Kaniksu National Forest (northeastern Washington) in 1964. This variety, known only from the type locality, differs from the nominate variety in its grayish outer <b>peridium</b> and minute scales. Because {{it was based on}} an invalid genus, it too was invalid; it was later published correctly in 2012 with the full name and authority Calbovista subsculpta var. fumosa A.H.Sm. ex J.C.Coetzee & A.E.van Wyk.|$|E
5|$|Calcium oxalate is {{a common}} {{crystalline}} compound found in many fungi, including the earthstars. The presence of calcium oxalate crystals—apparent as a whitish powder {{on the surface of}} the spore sac—has been verified for G.pectinatum using scanning electron microscopy. The calcium oxalate crystals occur in the tetragonal form, known as weddellite. A study on the related species Geastrum saccatum has shown that these crystals are responsible for the characteristic opening (dehiscence) of the outer peridial layers. The formation of calcium oxalate crystals stretches the layers of the outer walls, pushing apart the inner and outer layers of the <b>peridium.</b>|$|E
5|$|Gasteroid {{fruit body}} types are either roughly spherical or tuberous, {{occasionally}} with stipes, and {{usually have a}} <b>peridium</b> that is either simple or multi-layered. Mature gasteroid fruit bodies generally open irregularly at maturity to expose a powdery gleba with a color ranging from white to yellow or black-brown to black. Capillitia are generally absent from the gleba. Spores are spherical or nearly so, and have a surface texture that ranges from smooth to wart-like and spiny, or sometimes with reticulations. Hyphae have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|In the past, {{the species}} (when {{it was known}} as Calvatia utriformis) has been {{separated}} into three varieties (C.utriformis var. utriformis, C.utriformis var. hungarica and C.utriformis var. gruberi) based on differences in the ornamentation of the exoperidium (outer tissue layer of the wall, or <b>peridium)</b> and spores. However, a 1997 study of these characters revealed that the three varieties are not clearly demarcated. This study and others suggest that variations in the environmental conditions in which the specimens are grown can affect {{the development of these}} characteristics.|$|E
5|$|Myriostoma {{had been}} {{classified}} in the family Geastraceae until 1973, when British mycologist Donald Dring placed it in the Astraeaceae based {{on the presence of}} trabeculae (stout columns that extend from the <b>peridium</b> to the central core of the fruit body) in the gleba, and the absence of a true hymenium. In his 1989 monograph, Stellan Sunhede returned it to the Geastraceae. Molecular analysis of DNA sequences has confirmed the traditional belief that Myriostoma and Geastrum are closely related.|$|E
5|$|The fruiting bodies, or perida, are funnel- or barrel-shaped, 6–15mm tall, 4–8mm wide at the mouth, {{sometimes}} short-stalked, {{golden brown}} to blackish brown in age. The outside {{wall of the}} <b>peridium,</b> the ectoperidium, is covered with tufts of fungal hyphae that resembles shaggy, untidy hair. However, in older specimens this outer layer of hair (technically a tomentum) may be completely worn off. The internal wall of the cup, the endoperidium, is smooth and grey to bluish-black. The 'eggs' of the bird's nest – the peridioles – are blackish, 1–2mm in diameter, and there are typically about 20 in the cup. Peridioles are often attached to the fruiting body by a funiculus, a structure of hyphae that is differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the <b>peridium,</b> the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at {{one end to the}} peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. However, Brodie reports that sometimes C.stercoreus is found without a funiculus, which has led some authors to misidentify this species with the genus Nidula.|$|E
5|$|The protoplasmodium, a microscopic, {{undifferentiated}} granular {{mass with}} a slime sheath, is transparent and colourless. A single sporangiophore (the fruiting structure) is produced from the semispherical protoplasmodium, which is approximately {{one and a}} half times the diameter of mature sporangia. It acquires dark spots as it matures and the centre of the protoplasm later becomes dark. Then, the transparent and milk-white protoplasmodium climbs along the stem to the top, where first the capillitium and <b>peridium</b> and finally the spores are produced. At room temperature, this process lasts roughly one day.|$|E
5|$|This {{species was}} first {{described}} by Christian Hendrik Persoon in 1822 as Peziza fulgens, {{and has been}} grouped in several different genera since its original description. Phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequence data shows that within the Pezizales order, Caloscypha fulgens belongs in an evolutionary lineage with the families Helvellaceae, Morchellaceae, and Tuberaceae. Since 1968, Caloscypha {{had been placed in}} the Pyronemataceae family, a small grouping of fungi distinguished from other Pezizales by their relatively undeveloped <b>peridium.</b> In 2002, the new family Caloscyphaceae was described to contain the monotypic genus Caloscypha.|$|E
5|$|Cyathus olla bears a {{resemblance}} to a miniature bird's nest containing eggs, hence the common name bird's nest fungi. The fruiting body, or <b>peridium,</b> is roughly funnel-shaped, 10–18mm tall and 8–12mm wide. It is greyish yellow or greyish brown to fawn-colored {{and covered with}} even, fine-textured hairs on the outside surface. The inner surface is silver grey and smooth, often with faint transverse ridges. Cyathus olla is thick-walled, and flared outwards at the rim; the rim is typically wavy in outline. The 'eggs', or peridioles, typically number 8 to 10 in the cup, and they are white or grey in color, with a diameter of 2–4mm—conspicuously larger than other Cyathus species. They are covered with a thin membrane called a tunica.|$|E
5|$|In deposit, such {{as with a}} spore print, {{the spores}} appear almost black, tinged with purple. The spores are spherical in shape or nearly so, smooth, thick-walled, and lack a germ pore. They are nonamyloid (not {{absorbing}} iodine when stained with Melzer's reagent), black-brown, and have dimensions of 4.5–7.5 by 5.5–6.5µm. There is a prominent scar where the spore was once attached to the basidium (the spore-bearing cell) through the sterigma. The basidia are broadly club-shaped, and mostly four-spored, with long, slender sterigmata. Unlike other Agaricus species, the spores of A.deserticola are not shot off, but are instead dispersed when they sift out of the dried, mature fruit bodies after the <b>peridium</b> breaks open.|$|E
5|$|Peridioles are {{attached}} to the fruit body by a funiculus, a complex structure of hyphae that may be differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the <b>peridium,</b> the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. In the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at one end to the peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. In some species the peridioles may be covered by a tunica, a thin white membrane (particularly evident in C.striatus and C.crassimurus).|$|E
5|$|Peridioles {{are often}} {{attached}} to the fruiting body by a funiculus, a structure of hyphae that is differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the <b>peridium,</b> the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. Inside the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at {{one end to the}} peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. C.olla has a wide purse with an upper portion not easily distinguishable from the lower part.|$|E
5|$|The peridioles {{are about}} 1 to 1.5mm wide and rarely up to 2mm wide. They are disc-shaped, but may appear angular due to {{pressure}} from neighbouring peridioles. Peridioles may be dark, or a drab gray if still covered with a thin membrane called a tunica.Peridioles in C.striatus are sheathed and attached to the endoperidium by complex cords of mycelia known as a funiculus in the singular. The funiculus is differentiated into three regions: the basal piece, which attaches it to the inner wall of the <b>peridium,</b> the middle piece, and an upper sheath, called the purse, connected to the lower surface of the peridiole. Inside the purse and middle piece is a coiled thread of interwoven hyphae called the funicular cord, attached at {{one end to the}} peridiole and at the other end to an entangled mass of hyphae called the hapteron. When dry the funiculus is brittle, but when wet it is capable of long extension.|$|E
5|$|The smooth, {{thick-walled}} elliptical spores typically measure 7.5–10 by 5–7µm. They have {{a narrow}} germ pore. The mushroom {{does not produce}} a spore print, but the spores are yellow-brown in mass. The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are hyaline (translucent), club-shaped, usually four-spored (some are two-spored), and measure 17–21 by 6–8.2µm. Pseudoparaphyses (cells that grow down {{from the roof of}} locules, and often end up connecting the roof and the floor of the locule) are abundant in the gleba; they measure about 16 by 12.5µm. Cystidia are yellowish to brownish, thin-walled, with dimensions of 60–100 by 15–25µm. The <b>peridium</b> is made of two distinct tissue layers. The epicutis comprises narrow, gelatinous interwoven hyphae in a layer that is 15–50µm. Underneath the epicutis is the subcutis, which consists of thin-walled hyphae up to 12µm in diameter. All hyphae are inamyloid, and all have clamp connections.|$|E
5|$|This {{analysis}} shows {{that rather than}} fruit body structure, spore size is generally a more reliable character for segregating species groups in Cyathus. For example, species in the ollum clade all have spore lengths less than 15µm, while {{all members of the}} pallidum group have lengths greater than 15µm; the striatum group, however, cannot be distinguished from the pallidum group by spore size alone. Two characteristics are most suited for distinguishing members of the ollum group from the pallidum group: the thickness of the hair layer on the <b>peridium</b> surface, and the outline of the fruit bodies. The tomentum of Pallidum species is thick, like felt, and typically aggregates into clumps of shaggy or woolly hair. Their crucible-shaped fruit bodies do not have a clearly differentiated stipe. The exoperidium of Ollum species, in comparison, has a thin tomentum of fine hairs; fruit bodies are funnel-shaped and have either a constricted base or a distinct stipe.|$|E
5|$|The spores are spherical {{or nearly}} so, reddish-brown, {{thick-walled}} and verrucose (covered with warts and spines). The spores' dimensions are 7–11µm; the warts are about 1µm long. The spores are non-amyloid, {{and will not}} stain with iodine from Melzer's reagent. The use of scanning electron microscopy {{has shown that the}} spines are 0.90–1.45µm long, rounded at the tip, narrow, tapered, and sometime joined together at the top. The capillitia (masses of thread-like sterile fibers dispersed among the spores) are branched, 3.5–6.5µm in diameter, and hyaline (translucent). The basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four- to eight-spored, with very short sterigmata. The basidia are arranged in long strings of clusters; individual basidia measure 11–15 by 18–24µm. The threads of the capillitia arise from the inner surface of the <b>peridium,</b> and are thick-walled, long, interwoven, and branched, measuring 3–5.5µm thick. The exoperidium (the outer layer of tissue, comprising the rays) is made of four distinct layers of tissue: the mycelial layer contains branched hyphae that are 4–6μm in diameter; the hyphae of the fibrous layer are 6–8μm diameter and branched; the collenchyma-type layer has branched hyphae of 3–4μm diameter; the soft layer contains hyphae that are 3–6μm in diameter.|$|E
500|$|The fruit bodies push upward {{through the}} soil {{when they are}} about [...] tall. As growth progresses, the stem elongates and the <b>peridium</b> becomes more rounded, {{increasing}} in size until maturity. At {{about the time the}} <b>peridium</b> reaches [...] or slightly more in diameter, the columella exerts an upward tension on the tissue of the partial veil, and it begins to pull away from the stem. Typically, the veil tissue is weakest near the attachment to the stem, rather than to the attachment {{at the edge of the}} <b>peridium,</b> and the veil separates from the stem. The lower edge of the <b>peridium</b> is further stretched as it is pulled upward and outward. Usually, the arid environment causes the gleba to dry out rapidly. If the veil tissue at the base of the stem is [...] stronger than that attached to the edge of the <b>peridium,</b> the veil can rip so it remains attached to the stem as a ring. Scales begin to appear on the surface of the <b>peridium</b> of some specimens at about this time.|$|E
500|$|The {{resemblance}} that Cyathus helenae bears to {{a miniature}} bird's nest with eggs {{is the source}} for its common name, bird's nest fungi. The fruit body, or <b>peridium,</b> of C.helenae is obconic, that is, shaped roughly like an inverted cone. The upper third of the <b>peridium</b> is flared outwards sharply, and the opening is normally 5–6mm wide, while {{the height of the}} fruit body is 7mm. The outer surface of the <b>peridium,</b> the ectoperidium, is pale brown to grey in color, and covered with clusters of fungal hyphae that resemble hairs. These hairs appear to be aggregated into clusters ("nodular"), and generally point downward. The inner surface of the <b>peridium,</b> the endoperidium, is smooth with a grey to silver and somewhat shiny surface. This inner surface also has faint but distinct vertical ridges, known as plications. Like many other Cyathus species, the cup is attached to its growing surface by a clump of mycelium called an emplacement; in C.helenae the diameter of the emplacement is typically wider than that of the <b>peridium,</b> and it often incorporates bits of [...] "organic trash".|$|E
500|$|Fruit {{bodies are}} irregularly top-shaped to roughly spherical, {{measuring}} [...] wide by [...] high. It has a two-layered <b>peridium.</b> The outer {{layer of the}} <b>peridium</b> (the exoperidium) is thick and leathery (except where it thins toward the base), measuring [...] thick. It is divided into irregular three- to six-sided, low pyramids that are usually blunt, but sometimes pointed. The pyramids are 5–8mm thick. They have parallel markings, a feature Morse attributed to the differences in growth rate caused by variations in daytime and nighttime temperatures. The pyramid centers have short brownish hairs. The pyramids cover the entire <b>peridium</b> except for near the base, where it is smooth. Warts {{on the surface of}} young fruit bodies may be disproportionately thick.|$|E
500|$|Immature fruiting {{bodies of}} L.periphragmoides start as round or oval [...] "eggs" [...] {{that may be}} up to [...] in diameter. On the {{underside}} of the egg are whitish rhizomorphs that anchor it to the substrate. The <b>peridium</b> is white to buff-colored on the external surface, and has a gelatinous layer inside. An egg cut in half lengthwise reveals internal layers, including a tough white outer <b>peridium,</b> and a thick layer of firm, translucent, gelatinous matter transversed by strands (trabeculae) of denser white tissue. The strands are anastomosing partitions, connecting with the <b>peridium</b> externally and with the bars of the receptaculum within. The gelatinous layer is therefore divided up into many irregular longitudinal chambers.|$|E
500|$|The [...] "nest", or <b>peridium,</b> {{is usually}} about 7 to 10mm in height and 6 to 8mm in width, but the size is {{somewhat}} variable and specimens {{have been found}} with heights and widths of up to [...] The shape typically resembles a vase or inverted cone. The outer surface (exoperidium) ranges in color from slightly brownish to grayish buff to deep brown; the exoperidium has a shaggy or hairy texture (a tomentum), with the hairs mostly pointing downward. The inner surface of the <b>peridium</b> (the endoperidium) is striated or grooved, and shiny. Young specimens have a lid, technically called an epiphragm, a thin membrane that covers the cup opening. The epiphragm is hairy {{like the rest of}} the exoperidial surface, but the hairs often wear off leaving behind a thin white layer stretched across the lid of the cup. As the <b>peridium</b> matures and expands, this membrane breaks and falls off, exposing the peridioles within. The <b>peridium</b> is attached to its growing surface by a mass of closely packed hyphae called an emplacement; in C.striatus the maximum diameter of the emplacement is typically 8–12mm, and often incorporating small fragments of the growing surface into its structure.|$|E
500|$|The {{specific}} epithet triplex means [...] "threefold", and {{refers to}} the three-layered <b>peridium.</b> Geastrum triplex has acquired several vernacular names, including the collared earthstar, the saucered earthstar, and the triple earthstar.|$|E
