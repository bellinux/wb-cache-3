40|$|In {{the last}} years, {{freeform}} architecture {{became more and}} more popular. A variety of complex geometric shapes are used for the facades of buildings. Because of the large scale of architecture, it is necessary to decompose the surface into small panels. Here mathematics comes into play: In discrete differential geometry, presently emerging on the border between differential and discrete geometry, one aims to discretize smooth surfaces and the methods of differential geometry. This knowledge helps to efficiently design and manufacture freeform surfaces. A natural discretization is to cover the freeform surface by <b>planar</b> <b>panel</b> elements, leading to meshes with planar faces. It turns out that triangular meshes cause problems in the architectural realization when a support structure consisting of beams is needed. These beams cross each other in nodes, which are difficult to manufacture if the nodes have torsion, i. e. if the symmetry planes of the beams do not intersect in a common axis. In general, nodes of triangle meshes have torsion, in contrast to preferred planar quadrilateral meshes. Also, quadrilateral meshes do allow multilayer constructions often used in steel-glass constructions. Mathematically, multilayer constructions are described by edge-parallel meshes. A class of meshes with torsion-free nodes and equally-spaced parallel meshes are conical meshes. Equivalently, the faces adjacent to a node are tangent to a right circular cone. Any such mesh is parallel to a mesh whose faces are tangent to a sphere. If and only if the polar dual of the latter is discreteisothermic, the conical mesh has equilibrium forces. For this, one imagines the external forces acting in the nodes...|$|E
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{seeks to}} advance {{the current state of}} computer-based sound field simulations for room acoustics. The first part of the dissertation assesses the reliability of geometric sound-field simulations, which are approximate in nature. The second part of the dissertation uses the rigorous boundary element method (BEM) to learn more about reflections from finite reflectors: planar and non-planar. ^ Acoustical designers commonly use geometric simulations to predict sound fields quickly. Geometric simulation of reflections from rough surfaces is still under refinement. The first project in this dissertation investigates the scattering coefficient, which quantifies the degree of diffuse reflection from rough surfaces. The main result is that predicted reverberation time varies inversely with scattering coefficient if the sound field is nondiffuse. Additional results include a flow chart that enables acoustical designers to gauge how sensitive predicted results are to their choice of scattering coefficient. ^ Geometric acoustics is a high-frequency approximation to wave acoustics. At low frequencies, more pronounced wave phenomena cause deviations between real-world values and geometric predictions. Acoustical designers encounter the limits of geometric acoustics in particular when simulating the low frequency response from finite suspended reflector panels. This dissertation uses the rigorous BEM to develop an improved low-frequency radiation model for smooth, finite reflectors. The improved low frequency model is suggested in two forms for implementation in geometric models. ^ Although BEM simulations require more computation time than geometric simulations, BEM results are highly accurate. The final section of this dissertation uses the BEM to investigate the sound field around non-planar reflectors. The author has added convex edges rounded away from the source side of finite, smooth reflectors to minimize coloration of reflections caused by interference from boundary waves. Although the coloration could not be fully eliminated, the convex edge increases the sound energy reflected into previously nonspecular zones. This excess reflected energy is marginally audible using a standard of 20 dB below direct sound energy. The convex-edged panel is recommended for use when designers want to extend reflected energy spatially beyond the specular reflection zone of a <b>planar</b> <b>panel.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of freeform architecture provides interesting geometric challenges {{with regards to}} the design and manufacturing of large-scale structures. To design these architectural structures, we have to consider two types of constraints. First, aesthetic constraints are important because the buildings have to be visually impressive. Sec- ond, functional constraints are important for the performance of a building and its e cient construction. This thesis contributes to the area of architectural geometry. Specifically, we are interested in the geometric rationalization of freeform architec- ture with the goal of combining aesthetic and functional constraints and construction requirements. Aesthetic requirements typically come from designers and architects. To obtain visually pleasing structures, they favor smoothness of the building shape, but also smoothness of the visible patterns on the surface. Functional requirements typically come from the engineers involved in the construction process. For exam- ple, covering freeform structures using <b>planar</b> <b>panels</b> is much cheaper than using non-planar ones. Further, constructed buildings have to be stable and should not collapse. In this thesis, we explore the geometric rationalization of freeform archi- tecture using four specific example problems inspired by real life applications. We achieve our results by developing optimization algorithms and a theoretical study of the underlying geometrical structure of the problems. The four example problems are the following: (1) The design of shading and lighting systems which are torsion-free structures with planar beams based on quad meshes. They satisfy the functionality requirements of preventing light from going inside a building as shad- ing systems or reflecting light into a building as lighting systems. (2) The Design of freeform honeycomb structures that are constructed based on hex-dominant meshes with a planar beam mounted along each edge. The beams intersect without torsion at each node and create identical angles between any two neighbors. (3) The design of polyhedral patterns on freeform surfaces, which are aesthetic designs created by <b>planar</b> <b>panels.</b> (4) The design of space frame structures that are statically-sound and material-e cient structures constructed by connected beams. Rationalization of cross sections of beams aims at minimizing production cost and ensuring force equilibrium as a functional constraint...|$|R
40|$|The {{emergence}} of freeform structures in contemporary architecture raises numerous challenging research problems, {{most of which}} are related to the actual fabrication and are a rich source of research topics in geometry and geometric computing. The talk will provide an overview of recent progress in this field, with a particular focus on discrete geometric structures. Most of these result from practical requirements on segmenting a freeform shape into <b>planar</b> <b>panels</b> and on the physical realization of supporting beams and nodes. A study of quadrilateral meshes with planar faces reveals beautiful relations to discrete differential geometry. In particular, we discuss meshes which discretize the network of principal curvature lines. Conical meshes are among these meshes; they possess conical offset meshes at a constant face/face distance, which in turn leads to a supporting beam layout with so-called torsion free nodes. This work can be generalized to a variety of multilayer structures and laid the ground for an adapted curvature theory for these meshes. There are also efforts on segmenting surfaces into <b>planar</b> hexagonal <b>panels.</b> Though these are less constrained than <b>planar</b> quadrilateral <b>panels,</b> this problem is still waiting for an elegant solution. Inspired by freeform designs in architecture which involve circles and spheres, we present a new kind of triangle mesh whose faces' in-circles form a packing, i. e., the in-circles of two triangles with a common edge have the same contact point on that edge. These "circle packing (CP) meshes" exhibit an aesthetic balance of shape and size of their faces. They are closely tied to sphere packings on surfaces and to various remarkable structures and patterns which are of interest in art, architecture, and design. CP meshes constitute a new link between architectural freeform design and computational conformal geometry. Recently, certain timber structures motivated us to study discrete patterns of geodesics on surfaces. This topic is closely related to the classical geometry of webs. There are numerous open problems in the geometry of webs, in particular when one asks for webs formed by special types of curves, as preferred in applications such as architecture...|$|R

Using mesh data structures, I developed a system which provides a variety of construction methods. In order to {{demonstrate that}} mesh data structures {{can be used to}} categorize and construct physical polygonal models, this system visualizes the mathematical theory and generates developable multi-panels that can be printed and assembled to shapes similar to original virtual shapes.

40|$|In {{this work}} authors propose to {{calculate}} the deflection of <b>planar</b> <b>panels</b> from the longitudinal surface strain measurements by means of FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensors arrays properly bonded to (or embedded in) panels. To this aim a simple post processing analysis of FBG strain measurements is proposed and discussed. The relationship between the longitudinal strain and the vertical deflection is derived by classical beam theory. Indeed, a second derivative relationship exists between the displacement orthogonal {{to the surface and}} the strain component parallel to it. In order to know the strain components, FBG sensors have to be applied on both surface of the panel. The usefulness of the proposed technique can find important application in deflection monitoring of a novel detector, micromegas (MM), based on a micro mesh gaseous structure will be installed as a tracking detector in the ATLAS experiment at LHC (Large Hadron Collider) at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) by the end of 2018, during a major upgrade of the experiment. Thus, in order to validate the proposed methodology, measurements of the surface strain and then of the deflection of a relatively miniaturized MM panel prototype have been carried out.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{a set of}} novel optimization approaches for dealing with three different architecturally motivated rationalization tasks: First, a planarization technique for enabling efficient (e. g., glass) panelings of tessellated freeform geometries is presented. The formulation is based on plane intersections and yields <b>planar</b> <b>panels</b> by construction. Furthermore, the used constraints are straightforward algebraic expressions of lower polynomial degree than used in various comparable methods. The generality of the method is demonstrated by application {{to a variety of}} architecturally inspired optimization problems. Then, for a new type of support structures called point-folded structures an anti-diversification technique is developed for reducing the number of geometrically different panels. By a problem-adapted parametrization and carefully designed search strategy, the shape redundancy can be reduced by over 90 % for various freeform designs, enabling significant reductions of fabrication costs in practice. Finally, for the still largely unexplored high potential area of constrained tessellation techniques, i. e., tessellation algorithms restricted to using only structural elements from a predefined set, two novel approaches based on a commercially available construction system (Zometool) are presented. The first method concerns approximation of closed surfaces of arbitrary genus, and implements an effective model-exploration strategy to efficiently find a solution. Furthermore, for guaranteeing planarity of panels when tessellating the architecturally important class of freeform surface patches, a second method based on an advancing front method guided by a novel growing strategy is developed...|$|R

Form, structure and fabrication processes are closely linked, {{which makes the}} realization of complex architectural free-form structures even harder. Free-form transparent design today is mainly based on triangularly facetted forms or quadrilateral meshes supported by a structure composed of rectilinear bars, with strong shape restrictions. After {{a brief review of}} the history, we report on some very recent progress in this area. Beginning with a presentation of improved methods for triangle mesh design, we also discuss experiences in coupling triangular glass panels with continuous curved structures, seeking an optimised structural behaviour and simplified connections. Furthermore, we present how the results of research on planar quadrilateral (PQ) meshes lead the way to optimized beam layouts and the breakdown of free-form shapes using <b>planar</b> quadrilateral <b>panels.</b> PQ meshes are rooted in discrete differential geometry, an active area of mathematical research. Using recent projects as examples, we discuss how transparent free-form envelopes with a smooth visual appearance are achievable if the structure is designed to adhere to the limits of current glazing technology and the surfaces are reasonably simple (e. g. rotational, overall developable, or of a small scale). In section 6 we show how the latter restriction can be relaxed: the theoretical and computational methodology for PQ meshes can easily be extended to create nearly smooth approximations of free-form surfaces by single-curved panels. This has a strong impact on glass panelling design, since it avoids expensive double-curvature glass and exploits cold-bending technology. We elaborate on how this discretisation technique {{goes hand in hand with}} the technology for construction of the structure, glazing system and structural joints.

40|$|Surface tiling, {{as well as}} its {{counterpart}} in 3 D, i. e. volume tiling, is a fundamental research problem in the subject of computer graphics and geometric modeling, which has found applications in numerous areas, such as computer-aided design (CAD), physical simulation, realtime rendering and architectural modeling. The objective of surface tiling is to compute discrete mesh representations for given surfaces which are often required to possess some desirable geometric properties. Likewise, volume tiling focuses on the study of discretizing a given 3 D volume with complex boundary into a set of high-quality volumetric elements. This thesis starts with the study of computing optimal sampling for parametric surfaces, that is, decompose the surface into quad patches such that 1) each quad patch should have their sides with equal length; and 2) the shapes and sizes of all the quad patches should be the same as much as possible. Then, the similar idea is applied to the discrete case, i. e. optimizing the face elements of a quad mesh surface with the goal of making it possess, as much as possible, face elements of desired shapes and sizes. This thesis further studies the computation of hexagonal tiling on free-form surfaces, where the planarity of the faces is more concerned. Free-form meshes with planar hexagonal faces, to be called P-Hex meshes, provide a useful surface representation in discrete differential geometry and are demanded in architectural design for representing surfaces built with <b>planar</b> glass/metal <b>panels.</b> We study the geometry of P-Hex meshes and present an algorithm for computing a free-form P-Hex mesh of a specified shape. Lastly, this thesis progresses to 3 D volume case and proposes an automatic method for generating boundary-aligned all-hexahedron meshes with high quality, which possess nice numerical properties, such as a reduced number of elements and high approximation accuracy in physical simulation and mechanical engineering. published_or_final_versionComputer ScienceDoctoralDoctor of Philosoph...|$|R
40|$|A {{nonlinear}} continuous {{elastic system}} {{subjected to a}} combination of conservative and nonconservative forces is considered where parameters controlling the system are moving deep in the instability domain. New techniques are employed to present the numerical results in a compact form suitable for the interpretation of the system postcritical behavior. As an example, an initially <b>planar</b> elastic rectangular <b>panel</b> subjected to supersonic gas flow and loaded in the middle surface by "dead" forces is considered. Classical plate theory and piston theory approximation are used to simplify the statement and analysis of the problem. The steady states of the systems and their stability are analyzed without discretization of the problem, that is, within the framework of continuum solid mechanics. When dynamic behavior is concerned, the study is performed for a finite-degree-of-freedom approximation of the system. However. the number of degrees of freedom is chosen to be high enough to address the main features of the continuous system, and the final numerical results are discussed in terms of continuum systems. A variety of attractors is found in remote postcritical domains, and the high sensitivity of the system behavior to the variation of the control parameters and initial conditions is demonstrated...|$|R
