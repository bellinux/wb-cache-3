5|$|Director Jewison can put {{his cards}} on the table, let his camera cut suspensefully to the players' intent faces, but a pool shark sinking a tricky shot into a side pocket {{undoubtedly}} offers more range. Kid also has a less compelling subplot. Away from the table, McQueen gambles on a blonde (Tuesday Weld) and on the integrity of his dealer pal, Karl Malden. Pressure comes from a conventionally vicious Southern gentleman (Rip Torn), whose pleasures include a Negro mistress, a pistol range adjacent to his <b>parlor,</b> <b>and</b> fixed card games. As Malden's wife, Ann-Margret spells trouble of another kind, though her naive impersonation of a wicked, wicked woman recalls the era when the femme fatale wore breastplates lashed together with spider web. By the time all the bets are in, Cincinnati Kid appears to hold a losing hand.|$|E

Shay complained to busboy Eugene Jones about the placement of sugar bowls at his table. Clarence Euell, a black waiter at the cafe, came to address Shay's concern. An argument ensued during which Shay pulled out a gun and shot Euell in the abdomen. Euell wrestled Shay to the ground, pressing his foot down on Shay's head.|$|E

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 53). Unilever Bangladesh Ltd. {{is one of the}} world‟s most successful fast moving consumer goods manufacturing companies with local manufacturing facilities, reporting to regional business groups for innovation and business results. Unilever Bangladesh Limited has five departments to carry out all the organizational functions. I was appointed in Brand Activation Departments Headed by the Brand Activation Manager as an intern. This internship report is on “Hair Care Survey on Parlors & Salons in Dhaka”. The report comprises the survey of 60 ladies <b>parlors</b> <b>and</b> 34 men‟s salons in the Dhaka metropolitan city. The survey includes both qualitative and quantitative issues. The findings differed slightly between the two groups of gender. Women are more concerned about voluminous hair and prevention of split ends than men but both the gender are concerned about nourishment of hair, hair fall problems, dandruffs etc. Both men and women are becoming increasingly aware {{of the quality of the}} hair care products used in <b>parlors</b> <b>and</b> salons. According to the survey, majority of the parlors are using cheap Chinese, Thai or Indian herbal shampoos and conditioners. Caring conditioner is a prominent brand used in parlors owing to its cost effectiveness. Among the local brands, Sunsilk is the most commonly used brand in Grade B <b>and</b> Grade C <b>parlors</b> <b>and</b> Pantene is used in Grade A parlors especially for premium customers as Pantene is considered as high end product by customers. In men‟s salons, Pantene and Head & Shoulder dominate while conditioners are rarely used. Men‟s salon mostly prefers 2 in 1 shampoo and conditioner. One of the major necessities is to build and maintain a good relationship with <b>parlors</b> <b>and</b> salons and initiatives like beauty seminars, beauty talk shows on television or radios or other promotional campaign can be arranged that will lead to a win-win situation for both the company <b>and</b> the <b>parlors</b> <b>and</b> salons. An important concern of <b>parlors</b> <b>and</b> salons is the unavailability of 5 liters gallon shampoos in the market, limited sales on credit and direct delivery opportunities which should be considered if profit is to be boosted from this sector. This report includes valuable insights gained from the survey and suggestions to overcome some of the problems faced by <b>parlors</b> <b>and</b> salons regarding hair care products and how a good relationship can be built with <b>parlors</b> <b>and</b> salons to ensure attractive yield from this sector.

25|$|Another {{court case}} that {{paved the way}} for the IGRA was in the mid-1980s when the Cabazon Band of Mission Indians started a small bingo <b>parlor</b> <b>and</b> card club on their {{southern}} California reservation. Although the state attempted to shut down these gambling operations, the Cabazon tribe filed a lawsuit against the state, claiming that such an action was illegal in light of prior court rulings and the sovereign rights of the reservation. The state, on the other hand, argued that running such a high-stakes gambling organization was illegal and therefore punishable as a criminal violation of law, in accordance with Public Law 280. The Cabazon case eventually reached the U.S. Supreme Court.|$|E
