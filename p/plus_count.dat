40|$|This {{paper is}} {{motivated}} by the question whether there exists a logic capturing polynomial time computation over unordered structures. We consider several algorithmic problems near {{the border of the}} known, logically defined complexity classes contained in polynomial time. We show that fixpoint logic <b>plus</b> <b>counting</b> is stronger than might be expected, in that it can express the existence of a complete matching in a bipartite graph. We revisit the known examples that separate polynomial time from fixpoint <b>plus</b> <b>counting.</b> We show that the examples in a paper of Cai, Fürer, and Immerman, when suitably padded, are in choiceless polynomial time yet not in fixpoint <b>plus</b> <b>counting.</b> Without padding, they remain in polynomial time but appear not to be in choiceless polynomial time <b>plus</b> <b>counting.</b> Similar results hold for the multipede examples of Gurevich and Shelah, except that their final version of multipedes is, in a sense, already suitably padded. Finally, we describe another plausible candidate, involving determinants, for the task of separating polynomial time from choiceless polynomial time <b>plus</b> <b>counting.</b> ∗Partially supported by NSF grant DMS– 0070723 and a grant from Microsoft Research...|$|R

25|$|In each of {{the first}} nine boxes, play {{proceeds}} as follows: The first player bowls his first ball at the pins. The pins he knocks down are counted and scored. Then the player rolls a second and a third ball at any remaining targets. If all ten pins are knocked down with the first ball (a strike), the player receives ten points <b>plus</b> the <b>count</b> on the next two rolls, the pins are cleared, a new set placed. If all ten pins are knocked down with two balls (a spare), the player receives 10 points <b>plus</b> the <b>count</b> of the next ball, pins are cleared and reset. If all three balls are needed to knock all the pins down, the score for that frame is simply ten, and known in New England as a ten-box.

40|$|Sampling {{protocols}} {{for detecting}} Salmonella on poultry differ among various countries. In the United States, the U. S. Department of Agriculture Food Safety and Inspection Service dictates that whole broiler carcasses should be rinsed with 400 ml of 1 % buffered peptone water, {{whereas in the}} European Union 25 -g samples composed of neck skin from three carcasses are evaluated. The {{purpose of this study}} was to evaluate a whole carcass rinse (WCR) and a neck skin excision (NS) procedure for Salmonella and Escherichia coli isolation from the same broiler carcass. Carcasses were obtained from three broiler processing plants. The skin around the neck area was aseptically removed and bagged separately from the carcass, and microbiological analysis was performed. The corresponding carcass was bagged and a WCR sample was evaluated. No significant difference (alpha <= 0. 05) in Salmonella prevalence was found between the samples processed by the two methods, but both procedures produced many false-negative Salmonella results. Prechill, 37 % (66 carcasses), 28 % (50 carcasses), and 51 % (91 carcasses) of the 180 carcasses examined were positive for Salmonella by WCR, NS, and both procedures combined, respectively. Postchill, 3 % (5 carcasses), 7 % (12 carcasses), and 10 % (17 carcasses) of the 177 carcasses examined were positive for Salmonella by the WCR, NS, and combination of both procedures, respectively. Prechill, E. coli <b>plus</b> coliform <b>counts</b> were 3. 0 and 2. 6 log CFU/ml by the WCR and NS methods, respectively. Postchill.

40|$|I present two {{new methods}} for exactly summing {{a set of}} floating-point numbers, and then {{correctly}} rounding to the nearest floating-point number. Higher accuracy than simple summation (rounding after each addition) is important in many applications, such as finding the sample mean of data. Exact summation also guarantees identical results with parallel and serial implementations, since the exact sum is independent of order. The new methods use variations {{on the concept of}} a "superaccumulator" - a large fixed-point number that can exactly represent the sum of any reasonable number of floating-point values. One method uses a "small" superaccumulator with sixty-seven 64 -bit chunks, each with 32 -bit overlap with the next chunk, allowing carry propagation to be done infrequently. The small superaccumulator is used alone when summing a small number of terms. For big summations, a "large" superaccumulator is used as well. It consists of 4096 64 -bit chunks, one for every possible combination of exponent bits and sign bit, <b>plus</b> <b>counts</b> of when each chunk needs to be transferred to the small superaccumulator. To add a term to the large superaccumulator, only a single chunk and its associated count need to be updated, which takes very few instructions if carefully implemented. On modern 64 -bit processors, exactly summing a large array using this combination of large and small superaccumulators takes less than twice the time of simple, inexact, ordered summation, with a serial implementation. A parallel implementation using a small number of processor cores can be expected to perform exact summation of large arrays at a speed that reaches the limit imposed by memory bandwidth. Some common methods that attempt to improve accuracy without being exact may therefore be pointless, at least for large summations, since they are slower than computing the sum exactly...|$|R
