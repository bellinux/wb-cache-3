40|$|Organizations that {{leverage}} {{lessons learned}} from their experience {{in the practice of}} complex real-world activities are faced with five difficult problems. First, how to represent the learning situation in a recognizable way. Second, how to represent what was actually done in terms of repeatable actions. Third, how to assess performance taking account of the particular circumstances. Fourth, how to abstract lessons learned that are re-usable on future occasions. Fifth, how to determine whether to pursue practice maturity or strategic relevance of activities. Here, organizational learning and performance improvement are investigated in a field study using the Context-based Intelligent Assistant Support (CIAS) approach. A new conceptual framework for <b>practice-based</b> organizational <b>learning</b> and performance improvement is presented that supports researchers and practitioners address the problems evoked and contributes to a practice-based approach to activity management. The novelty of the research lies in the simultaneous study of the different levels involved in the activity. Route selection in light rail infrastructure projects involves practices at both the strategic and operational levels; it is part managerial/political and part engineering. Aspectual comparison of practices represented in Contextual Graphs constitutes a new approach to the selection of Key Performance Indicators (KPIs). This approach is free from causality assumptions and forms the basis of a new approach to <b>practice-based</b> organizational <b>learning</b> and performance improvement. The evolution of practices in contextual graphs is shown to be an objective and measurable expression of organizational learning. This diachronic representation is interpreted using a <b>practice-based</b> organizational <b>learning</b> novelty typology. This dissertation shows how lessons learned when effectively leveraged by an organization lead to practice maturity. The practice maturity level of an activity in combination with an assessment of an activity’s strategic relevance can be used by management to prioritize improvement effort...|$|R

5000|$|The {{curriculum}} at UConn {{consists of three}} phases taking place over a four-year period. The goal of the curriculum is for students to fulfill competencies aligned with the ACGME competencies, including patient-care, medical knowledge, <b>practice-based</b> <b>learning</b> and improvement, interpersonal and communication skills, professionalism, and systems-based practice. During their first and second years, students are enrolled in Phase 1, which covers core basic science instruction and the foundations of clinical medicine. In a unique fashion, medical students and dental students study the core basic sciences together for two years. Phase 2 takes place during the third year and provides core clinical experiences consisting of both inpatient and outpatient experiences. During this year, students return to the main UConn Health campus for a Home Week experience integrating concepts related to patient safety, clinical reasoning, and career development. Fourth-year students’ education culminates with phase 3, a highly customizable phase of advanced clinical experiences, electives, and a selective (which allows students to complete a capstone project).

40|$|<b>Practice-based</b> <b>learning</b> is {{a common}} {{component}} of urban planning education, yet there are few reported evaluations of specific student learning experiences. Assessing student perceptions and opinions of their university education is now standard in quality assurance of learning and teaching. In Australia, the Course Experience Questionnaire (CEQ) has been institutionalised as {{a national survey of}} graduand opinion and is now used as an indicator of tertiary teaching quality. A little-used variant of the CEQ called the Work Experience Questionnaire (WEQ) offers a survey instrument directly applicable for assessing student responses to a range of <b>practice-based</b> <b>learning</b> situations in planning education. Explained in the paper is the structure of the Bachelor of Planning degree at the University of New South Wales (UNSW), in Sydney. The rationale, including the educational significance, of the compulsory 12 months of work experience ‘sandwiched ’ {{in the middle of the}} degree, is enunciated. This paper seeks to report on the views of students who have completed this year of work experience. Three cohorts of undergraduate urban planning students at UNSW are monitored using the WEQ survey tool. The WEQ model is used to codify the experience of these students after their ‘sandwich year ’ out on industry training.

40|$|This paper synthesises and {{discusses}} {{a number of}} themes arising from self-evaluations conducted by four Central Academic Units in the Open University. Some of the themes were also discussed in an earlier paper, Issues {{in the assessment of}} <b>practice-based</b> professional <b>learning,</b> which is available on the PBPL CETL website. Some pedagogical implications of the difference between professional learning in two milieux, on placement and in one’s own workplace, are acknowledged. In the latter milieu, a course participant has the advantage of familiarity with the workplace environment, but this may make it difficult to draw in a proper manner on workplace resources when responding to course assessment tasks. A number of curricular issues are discussed, including the appropriate blending of theoretical and practical understandings; the problems of providing workplace learning opportunities; some aspects of e-learning; and the twin challenges of stating standards for courses involving professional learning, and assessing against them. The more individually focused is the curriculum, the greater the problems of ensuring robust assessments and the greater the cost implications (the same apply broadly in respect of the assessment of prior experiential learning). The problematic nature of grading is often under-appreciated. However, when even a three-point grading approach (fail/pass/distinction) is adopted in <b>practice-based</b> professional <b>learning,</b> challenge presents itself – and is particularly evident where the distinction grade is involved. This is an aspect of assessment that demands further inquiry. Another aspect of assessment that is worthy of further study is the use of assessors and/or verifiers from the workplace. The Foundation Degree in early years is pioneering the use of verifiers, which is an approach that merits formal study since it has implications that could extend well beyond the Open University. The challenging curricular and assessment issues have implications for staff and student development, and for quality assurance...|$|R

The Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education competencies mandate requires that ophthalmology residency programs both teach and assess <b>practice-based</b> <b>learning</b> and improvement. A systematically conducted review of the literature regarding the use of the journal club in resident medical education was performed to define specific recommendations for implementation of a journal club tool. Selected best practices for a successful journal club were gleaned from the existing medical literature. These include the following: 1) the use of a structured review checklist, 2) explicit written learning objectives, and 3) a formalized meeting structure and process. The journal club might prove to be an excellent tool for the assessment of competencies like <b>practice-based</b> <b>learning</b> which may be difficult to assess by other means.

40|$|AbstractUniversity Technology Transfer Offices (TTOs) need a {{wide range}} of {{abilities}} to facilitate commercial exploitation of research outputs; however, we know relatively little about how these important abilities are developed and refined over time. We draw on <b>practice-based</b> studies of <b>learning</b> to create a novel conceptualization of learning processes and their outcomes in TTOs and show that this conceptualization of learning provides new empirical insights into how learning in TTOs shapes their commercialization practice. We investigate learning-in-practice in case studies of six UK TTOs and find two approaches to commercialization, namely transactions-focused practice and relations-focused practice. We find that both practices co-exist and co-evolve in some TTOs while other TTOs are predominantly transactions-focused. For the latter the development of a relations-focused approach is difficult, but possible if there is strategic direction and if sources of inertia are removed by TTO directors. Given that evolving practice cannot be fully explained by informal learning processes, we suggest that so far separate streams of <b>practice-based</b> literature on <b>learning</b> and strategizing should be brought together. The implications for further investigations of TTO abilities and some recommendations for policy and practice are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Is {{social work}} ‘The Assessment Profession?’ This book argues that {{assessment}} is {{a defining feature of}} professional {{social work and}} it analyses how the power of assessment pervades both individual and institutional practices. Social workers’ roles and tasks are increasingly shaped by the need to carry out social assessments of people’s lives in complex and contestable public welfare environments. At the same time, social workers themselves are subject to assessment of their competence and capability through occupational standards and continuing education requirements. In highlighting social work as uniquely positioned within this nexus of assessment processes, the author offers a historical and contemporary synthesis of ideas that combine the critical social theories of Habermas with the pioneering constructivism of George Kelly’s Personal Construct Psychology. The book outlines an innovative research enquiry which is used to explore the dilemmas and opportunities of <b>practice-based</b> professional <b>learning</b> and offers a ‘conducive’ alternative approach to assessment in social work. This book will be important reading for students, practitioners and social care educators. ...|$|R
