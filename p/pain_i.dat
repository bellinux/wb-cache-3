5|$|The abscess in {{my ankle}} was painful and persistent.... Owing to faulty {{treatment}} and want of rest my ankle became perfectly stiff, {{as it is}} to this day. Of course, I said as little as possible about it, for even partial lameness would spoil my chances on the stage. I doubt if the management ever knew; the public certainly didn't; and those who saw me dancing and capering light-heartedly about the stage for twenty years little thought under what difficulties I did it, and the <b>pain</b> <b>I</b> often suffered.|$|E
5|$|It {{happened}} {{on my last}} day in Hanoi. I was exhausted and an emotional wreck after the 2-week visit... The translator {{told me that the}} soldiers wanted to sing me a song. He translated as they sung. It was a song about the day 'Uncle Ho' declared their country's independence in Hanoi's Ba Dinh Square. I heard these words: 'All men are created equal; they are given certain rights; among these are life, Liberty and Happiness.' These are the words Ho pronounced at the historic ceremony. I began to cry and clap. 'These young men should not be our enemy. They celebrate the same words Americans do.' The soldiers asked me to sing for them in return... I memorized a song called 'Day Ma Di', written by anti-war South Vietnamese students. I knew I was slaughtering it, but everyone seemed delighted that I was making the attempt. I finished. Everyone was laughing and clapping, including me... Here is my best, honest recollection of what happened: someone (I don't remember who) led me towards the gun, and I sat down, still laughing, still applauding. It all {{had nothing to do with}} where I was sitting. I hardly even thought about where I was sitting. The cameras flashed... It is possible that it was a set up, that the Vietnamese had it all planned. I will never know. But if they did I can't blame them. The buck stops here. If I was used, I allowed it to happen... a two-minute lapse of sanity that will haunt me forever... But the photo exists, delivering its message regardless of what I was doing or feeling. I carry this heavy in my heart. I have apologized numerous times for any <b>pain</b> <b>I</b> may have caused servicemen and their families because of this photograph. It was never my intention to cause harm.|$|E

500|$|In May 1946, the LDS Church excommunicated Brodie. She {{never tried}} to regain her membership. Brodie once wrote to a friend that what she {{suffered}} from her disillusionment with Mormonism [...] "had {{to do with the}} <b>pain</b> <b>I</b> caused my family. [...] The disillusionment itself was...a liberating experience." [...] Before No Man Knows My History was published, Brodie sought to comfort her parents, [...] "You brought us all up to revere the truth, which is the noblest ideal a parent can instill in his children, {{and the fact that we}} come out on somewhat different roads certainly is no reflection on you."

However, Captain Corcoran's curse [...] "Damme!"

He said, Damn me!' I cannot find words to convey to the reader the <b>pain</b> <b>I</b> felt in seeing those dear children taught to utter such words to amuse ears grown callous to their ghastly meaning... How Mr. Gilbert could have stooped to write, or Sir Arthur Sullivan could have prostituted his noble art to set to music, such vile trash, it passes my skill to understand".|$|E

500|$|In a 1988 {{interview}} with Barbara Walters, Fonda expressed regret {{for some of}} her comments and actions, stating:I {{would like to say}} something, not just to Vietnam veterans in New England, but to men who were in Vietnam, who I hurt, or whose <b>pain</b> <b>I</b> caused to deepen because of things that I said or did. I was trying to help end the killing and the war, but there were times when I was thoughtless and careless about it and I'm very sorry that I hurt them. And I want to apologize to them and their families. [...] I will go to my grave regretting the photograph of me in an anti-aircraft gun, which looks like I was trying to shoot at American planes. It hurt so many soldiers. It galvanized such hostility. It was the most horrible thing I could possibly have done. It was just thoughtless.|$|E
500|$|In {{the summer}} of 1902, Eleanor {{encountered}} her father's fifth cousin, Franklin Delano Roosevelt, on a train to Tivoli, New York. The two began a secret correspondence and romance, and became engaged on November 22, 1903. Franklin's mother, Sara Ann Delano, opposed the union, and made him promise that the engagement would not be officially announced for a year. [...] "I know what <b>pain</b> <b>I</b> must have caused you," [...] he wrote his mother of his decision. But, he added, [...] "I know my own mind, and known {{it for a long}} time, and know that I could never think otherwise." [...] Sara took her son on a Caribbean cruise in 1904, hoping that a separation would squelch the romance, but Franklin remained determined. The wedding date was set to accommodate President Theodore Roosevelt, who was scheduled to be in New York City for the St. Patrick's Day parade, and who agreed to give the bride away.|$|E
500|$|Tarwater {{was devastated}} by the trial results, later saying, [...] "It was the most empty feeling in the world." [...] He went home to Knoxville to reflect on {{swimming}} and life in general. He told his parents {{that he could not}} stand hearing coverage of the Olympics, so his father quickly organized a vacation to Costa Rica. After returning home, Tarwater's uncle, Richmond Flowers Jr., was able to help him through the experience. [...] In 1968, Flowers had been a gold medal favorite in the hurdles before suffering a hamstring injury two months before the Olympic Trials. [...] "I think he knew the <b>pain</b> <b>I</b> was feeling and the disappointment I was feeling, because he felt same thing," [...] Tarwater recalled. Flowers offered perspective, instead of comfort: [...] "I believe there is a God who created this, and it ain't no accident. [...] He's got a plan... maybe it just wasn't the right thing for you." [...] Soon after, Tarwater met pastor Doug Banister of All Souls Church in Knoxville. After several [...] "really tough conversions" [...] with Banister, Tarwater decided to [...] " [...] life to Christ and basically relinquished control." ...|$|E
