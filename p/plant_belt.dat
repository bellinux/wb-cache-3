40|$|Macrofossil {{analysis}} of a composite 19 m long sediment core from Rano Raraku Lake (Easter Island) wasrelated to litho-sedimentary and geochemical features of the sediment. Strong stratigraphical patterns are shown by indirect gradient analyses of the data. The good correspondence between the stratigraphical patterns derived from macrofossil (Correspondence Analysis) and sedimentary and geochemical data (Principal Component Analysis) shows that macrofossil associations provide sound palaeolimnological information in conjunction with sedimentary data. The main taphonomic factors influencing the macrofossil assemblages are run-off from the catchment, the littoral <b>plant</b> <b>belt,</b> and the depositional environment within the basin. Five main stages during the last 34, 000 calibrated years BP (calyrBP) are characterised from the lithological, geochemical, and macrofossil data. From 34 to 14. 6 calkyrBP (last glacial period) the sediments were largely derived from the catchment, indicating a high energy lake environment with much erosion and run-off bringing abundant plant trichomes, lichens, and mosses into the centre of Raraku Lake. During the early Holocene the infilling of the lake basin and warmer conditions favoured {{the growth of a}} littoral <b>plant</b> <b>belt</b> that obstructed terrigenous input. Cladoceran remains and Solanaceae seeds are indicative of reduced run-off and higher values of N and organic C indicate increased aquatic and catchment productivity. From 8. 7 to 4. 5 calkyrBP a swamp occupied the entire basin. The increase of Cyperaceae seeds reflects this swamp development and, with oribatid mites and coleopteran remains, indicates a peaty environment and more anoxic conditions in Raraku. At around 4. 5 calkyrBP dry conditions prevented peat growth and there is a sedimentary hiatus. About 800 calyrBP, peat deposition resumed. Finally, in the last few centuries, a small lake formed within the surrounding swamp. Evidence of human activity is recorded in these uppermost sediments. Â© 2011 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|Transfer chutes are {{essential}} components {{in almost all}} bulk material handling <b>plants.</b> <b>Belt</b> conveyors utilize transfer chutes to load and redirect bulk materials from one conveyor to another, with their reliability and performance being critical to the overall operation of the plant. While reliability and operational performance is typically measured by availability and throughput, transfer chutes must also operate with minimal environmental impact. Consequently, the design of transfer chutes in relation to entrained air flow, {{with the aim of}} minimizing fugitive dust emissions, is an area of ongoing research and investigation requiring the analysis of complex multiphase systems. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) has been successfully applied to evaluate potential dust emissions from transfer chutes, with the implementation of appropriate models and modelling parameters shown to be critical to the overall accuracy of the simulation results. A notable shortcoming in the current research is the lack of systematic guidelines available to appropriately select model parameters. The aim {{of this paper is to}} offer guidance in this regard, and provide a better understanding of the influence of the maximum fractional packing limit and evaluate the most appropriate model parameters for simulations, including particle-particle restitution coefficient values and solid slip conditions. For this purpose, the two-phase three-dimensional Euler-Euler model of commercial CFD software Fluent has been selected to model the granular and air flow in the transfer chute. Air velocities were measured experimentally by Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) with the simulated velocity profiles being in good overall agreement with the experimental data. 2013 Elsevier Ltd...|$|R

40|$|In China, the ridge-furrow water {{conservation}} planting (RC) system is advantageous for improving crop yields and rainwater use efficiency. In RC planting system, plastic film-mulched ridges are employed for water harvesting while the furrows serve as infiltration and <b>planting</b> <b>belts.</b> To optimize the RC {{system and to}} overcome problems {{due to the lack}} of water in semi-humid areas at risk of drought, we mulched the furrows with 8 % biodegradable film (RCSB), liquid film (RCSL), or no mulching in the furrows (RCSN), while conventional flat planting (CF) was employed as the control. After 4 year (2007 – 2010) consecutive field study, the results showed that the soil water storage level in the 0 – 100 cm layer with four treatments was ranked as follow: RCSB > RCSL > RCSN > CF, while the RCSB and RCSL were 26. 3 and 12. 2 mm greater than RCSN, respectively. Compared with CF, the average soil temperature was significantly (P < 0. 05) higher by 3. 1, 1. 7, and 1. 5 °C under the RC planting treatments (RCSB, RCSL, and RCSN) during each year, respectively. The average ET rate of RC treatments were all lower than CF in each experimental year, and the average decreased by 8. 0 % (P < 0. 05). The average yields with RCSB, RCSL, and RCSN increased by 2, 665, 1, 444, and 1, 235 kg ha− 1, respectively, and the water use efficiency (WUE) increased by 51. 6, 25. 6, and 21. 1 %, compared with CF. RCSB obtained the highest economic benefit, the average net income was higher than CF by 4, 020 Yuan ha− 1.
