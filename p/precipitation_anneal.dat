Summary Small variations of the MOS current leakage were de-tected for wafers from three different vendors after a MOS process s imulat ion with an initial 1150 ~ heat-t reatment in 02 and HC 1. However, without an 1150 ~ preanneal prior to s~mulation, the MOS leakage in-creased significantly. Vendor I, II, and III wafers differ in their oxygen precipitation during the MOS process simulation. Also, within a given vendor's wafers, the oxygen precipitation behavior can vary.

Internal gettering at intra-grain defects plays key a role during such <b>precipitation</b> <b>annealing.</b> External gettering to phosphorus diffused regions is crucial in reducing the dissolved iron concentration during cell processing, although its effectiveness depends strongly on the diffusion temperature and profile.

Common heat treatment processes include <b>annealing,</b> <b>precipitation</b> strengthening, quenching, and tempering. The annealing process softens the metal by heating it and then allowing it to cool very slowly, which gets rid of stresses in the metal and makes the grain structure large and soft-edged {{so that when the}} metal is hit or stressed it dents or perhaps bends, rather than breaking; it is also easier to sand, grind, or cut annealed metal. Quenching is the process of cooling a high-carbon steel very quickly after heating, thus [...] "freezing" [...] the steel's molecules in the very hard martensite form, which makes the metal harder. There is a balance between hardness and toughness in any steel; the harder the steel, the less tough or impact-resistant it is, and the more impact-resistant it is, the less hard it is. Tempering relieves stresses in the metal that were caused by the hardening process; tempering makes the metal less hard while making it better able to sustain impacts without breaking.|$|R
