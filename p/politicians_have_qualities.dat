60|$|They {{accused him}} of nepotism. His friends and family were {{certainly}} well cared for. In private life {{he was full of}} an affectionate intimacy; he pleased by being charmed and pleased. One might think at times there was no more of him than a clever man happily circumstanced, and finding an interest and occupation in politics. And then came a glimpse of thought, of imagination, like the sight of a soaring eagle through a staircase skylight. Oh, beyond question he was great! No other contemporary <b>politician</b> <b>had</b> his <b>quality.</b> In no man have I perceived so sympathetically the great contrast between warm, personal things and the white dream of statecraft. Except that he had it seemed no hot passions, but only interests and fine affections and indolences, he paralleled the conflict of my life. He saw and thought widely and deeply; but at times it seemed to me his greatness stood over and behind the reality of his life, like some splendid servant, thinking his own thoughts, who waits behind a lesser master's chair....|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates to {{what extent}} voters and <b>politicians</b> <b>have</b> the same {{preferences}} for locally provided welfare services. We make use of {{two different types of}} survey questionnaires; one directed towards voters and one directed towards politicians. We reach two main conclusions in the paper. First, we find that <b>politicians</b> <b>have</b> preferences for significantly different spending on locally provided welfare services compared to voters. Second, this difference remains even after controlling for <b>politicians</b> and voters <b>having</b> different socio-economic characteristics. For example, when analyzing female representation, we find that female <b>politicians</b> <b>have</b> significantly different preferences for spending than female voters. One implication of the latter result is that an increase in the ratio of female to male politicians may not {{be the only way to}} deal with the desire to increase the political representation of women. Political representation; local public...|$|R
