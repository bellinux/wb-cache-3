Elements 113, 115, 117 and 118, the most recent discoveries, were officially confirmed by the International Union of <b>Pure</b> <b>and</b> Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) in December 2015.

40|$|This {{research}} examined whether bully/victims {{in adolescent}} residential care are qualitatively different from <b>pure</b> bullies <b>and</b> <b>pure</b> victims. Male <b>and</b> female young people (NÂ =Â  601) aged 11 - 21 from 22 residential institutions in Croatia completed an anonymous self-report questionnaire measuring bullying {{as well as}} the Basic Empathy Scale, the Rosenberg Self-esteem Scale and the Big Five Personality Inventory. Based on the bullying questionnaire, the residents were classified as pure bullies, <b>pure</b> victims, bully/victims <b>and</b> those not involved in bullying/victimization. Bully/victims were compared to <b>pure</b> bullies <b>and</b> <b>pure</b> victims on a number of background and personality variables. The differences found were in degree rather than in kind. Bully/victims did not differ from both <b>pure</b> bullies <b>and</b> <b>pure</b> victims on any of the measures nor did they differ from <b>pure</b> bullies <b>and</b> <b>pure</b> victims in the way they bully or in the way they are victimized. Above those that could be expected by chance, there were no independent predictors that were unique to bully/victims nor were there strong interaction effects between bully and victim statuses. The results are discussed with reference to the existing prison and school-based literature about bully/victims and a number of research and policy recommendations are provided. It is concluded that bully/victims are not qualitatively different from <b>pure</b> bullies <b>and</b> <b>pure</b> victims, <b>and</b> that future research should focus on bullies and victims rather than bully/victims.

5|$|In 1985, the International Union of <b>Pure</b> <b>and</b> Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of <b>Pure</b> <b>and</b> Applied Physics (IUPAP) {{formed a}} Joint Working Party (JWP) aimed at {{assessing}} discoveries and establishing final {{names for the}} elements in question. The party held numerous meetings with delegates from the three competing institutes; in 1990, they established criteria on recognizing an element and in 1991, they completed the work on assessing discoverer statuses and the party was disbanded. These results were published in 1993. According to the report, the first definitely successful experiment was the April 1970 experiment in Berkeley, followed closely by the June 1970 Dubna experiment; thus, credit for discovery of the element should be shared between the two competing teams.|$|E

5|$|In December 2015, the Joint Working Party of {{international}} scientific bodies International Union of <b>Pure</b> <b>and</b> Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and International Union of <b>Pure</b> <b>and</b> Applied Physics (IUPAP) recognized the element's discovery and assigned {{the priority of}} the discovery to the Dubna–Livermore collaboration. This was on account of two 2009 and 2010 confirmations of {{the properties of the}} granddaughter of 294Og, 286Fl, at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, as well as the observation of another consistent decay chain of 294Og by the Dubna group in 2012. The goal of that experiment had been the synthesis of 294Ts via the reaction 249Bk(48Ca,3n), but the short half-life of 249Bk resulted in a significant quantity of the target having decayed to 249Cf, resulting in the synthesis of oganesson instead of tennessine.|$|E
5|$|In the 1960s, {{small amounts}} of {{rutherfordium}} were produced in the Joint Institute for Nuclear Research in the former Soviet Union and at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory in California.
