The remedy of specific performance is, in contractual matters, an order {{by the court}} which requires the <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>breach</b> of contract to perform his obligations.

Injunctions, on the other hand, are remedies which prevent a party from doing something (unlike specific performance, which requires them to do something).

2500|$|The main way {{contracts}} {{are brought to}} an untimely end is when one party does not perform the major primary obligations on {{their side of the}} bargain. As a rule, if a breach is small the other party must still go ahead and perform his obligations, but will then be able to claim compensation, or a [...] "secondary obligation" [...] from the <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>breach.</b> If, however, the breach is very big, [...] "fundamental" [...] or goes [...] "to the root of the contract", then the innocent party gets the right to elect to terminate his own performance for the future. The same goes where one party makes clear they have no intention of performing their side of the bargain, in an [...] "anticipatory repudiation", so the innocent party can go straight to court to claim a remedy, rather than waiting till the contract's date for performance which never arrives. The test for whether a term's breach will allow for termination essentially depends on construction of the contract's terms as a whole by the court, following the same rules as for any other term. In Bettini v Gye, Blackburn J held that although an opera singer arrived 4 days late for rehearsals, given that the contract was to last three and a half months, and only the first week of performance would be slightly affected, the Opera House owner was not entitled to turn the singer away. The opera owner could have withheld some payment to reflect his loss from the breach, but should have let the show go on. The intentions of the parties manifested in the contract showed that such a breach was not so serious as to give rise to the right to terminate.

40|$|This Essay formulates a {{positive}} model that predicts when commercial parties will employ private ordering to enforce their agreements. The typical enforcement mechanism associated with private ordering is the reputation mechanism, {{in which a}} merchant community punishes <b>parties</b> <b>in</b> <b>breach</b> of contract by denying them future business. The growing private ordering literature argues that these private enforcement mechanisms can be superior to the traditional, less efficient enforcement measures provided by public courts. However, previous comparisons {{between public and private}} contractual enforcement have presented a misleading dichotomy by failing to consider a third enforcement mechanim: the vertically integrated firm. This Essay develops a model that comprehensively addresses three distinct types of enforcement mechanisms [...] firms, courts, and reputation-based private ordering. The model rests on a synthesis of transaction cost economics, which compares the efficiencies of firms versus markets, and the private ordering literature, which compares the efficiencies of public courts versus private ordering. It hypothesizes that private ordering will arise when agreements present enforcement difficulties, high-powered market incentives are important, and the costs of entry barriers are low. The Essay then conducts an illustrative test by comparing the model 2 ̆ 7 s predictions to documented instances of private ordering...|$|R

However, a deposit {{is intended to be}} earnest for performance and will not be recoverable, at least generally. Six questions will be considered: (1) Is the penalty rule applicable to a deposit? (2) If not, is the deposit subject to any other common law control? (3) Is equitable relief against forfeiture applicable? (4) Does a stipulation of “non-refundable” payment describe the essential feature of a deposit as generally not subject to a restitutionary claim, or does it purport to exclude such a claim completely?

40|$|A <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>breach</b> of {{contract}} cannot sue {{the victim of}} breach to recover {{what would have been}} the victim’s loss on the contract. The doctrinal rationale is simple: A violator should not benefit from his violation. This rationale does not, however, provide an economic justification for the rule. Indeed, efficient breach theory is founded on the proposition that a breach {{of contract}} need not be met with reproach. Yet the prospect of a recovery by the party in breach—that is, the prospect of negative damages—has received scant attention in the contracts literature. Close analysis reveals potential costs to disallowance of negative damages particularly where a party with private information about the benefits of termination also has an incentive to continue under the contract. These costs can occur both ex post, at the time of a performance-or-termination decision, and ex ante, in anticipation of that decision. Nevertheless, allowance of negative damages could impose its own costs, where background information would create an incentive to repudiate a contract before either party could gather more information, for example. Ex ante contractual provisions, such as liquidated-damages or specific-performance clauses, permit parties some latitude to balance the costs of disallowance and allowance of negative damages, albeit imperfectly. Common law limitations on the mitigation duty, moreover, may be seen as a mechanism to approach this balance {{in the absence of an}} explicit contractual solution...|$|E
30|$|Such {{conflicts}} {{can play}} out {{in a number of}} ways, all of which potentially undermine flexibility and the willingness to engage in problem-solving tasks. The parties may haggle over work assignments, which may be costly in terms of lost production time, but by remaining within the area of potential agreement, neither side pushes the other to the point of termination. Alternatively, one might take advantage of the difficulty the other faces to find a replacement job or employee, and threaten termination in order to push the other party outside its zone of acceptance. These are sometimes referred to as ‘Dove’ and ‘Hawk’ strategies respectively. Both can be destructive of cooperation as they both send a signal to the other party that its partner is no longer seeking the joint benefit. Game theorists show that the best strategy, sometimes called ‘Bourgeois’, is to cooperate but be prepared to punish breaches should they occur. Its success requires that expected costs of sanctions facing the <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>breach</b> should exceed its expected gains, and that the offended party should always be ready to punish breaches if necessary (Maynard Smith 1982; Bowles 2004; Gibbons and Henderson 2012). 17 Following this line of argument, one can see that the greater the loss of benefit from foregone cooperation compared with the immediate gain from breach, the stronger the incentive for continued cooperation, which can then give rise to a virtuous circle comprising further on-the-job learning and growing mutual benefits.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{agreeing that}} courts should {{exercise}} great caution concerning anti-foreign-suit injunctions, the author argues {{in favor of}} such a remedy in a particular setting where enforcing an agreement to arbitrate is at stake. That setting occurs when the parties to an arbitration agreement place the arbitration seat in a particular country (F 1) and also choose that country 2 ̆ 7 s law to govern the arbitration agreement (its existence, validity and scope). Such an agreement should be understood as choosing F 1 courts to resolve any differences over the 2 ̆ 2 ordinary arbitrability 2 ̆ 2 of the dispute (existence, validity, {{and scope of the}} arbitration clause). Thus, if one of the parties tries to litigate the dispute in a different country (F 2), that <b>party</b> acts <b>in</b> <b>breach</b> of the arbitration agreement and may be enjoined from doing so. The author argues that parties wanting a strongly enforceable arbitration clause will favor this remedy and will want to place the arbitration seat in, and choose the law of, a country that will provide it. The author would make an exception where F 2 may have a strong public policy reason to treat the subject matter as not capable of settlement by arbitration - a 2 ̆ 2 public policy 2 ̆ 2 challenge to arbitrability, as opposed to a 2 ̆ 2 garden variety 2 ̆ 2 existence, validity, or scope challenge to arbitrability.

40|$|A marine {{insurance}} contract is a contract of utmost good faith (uberrimae fidei), which requires the duty of disclosure prior to {{the conclusion of a}} contract. This is essentially stated in ss. 17 and 18 of the Marine Insurance Act 1906. Despite the 100 -year application of these provisions, the defects are shown and the injustice occurs. The voluminous case laws and their complexity suggest nothing else apart from that this area of law is highly problematic. The criticisms are essentially rested upon two grounds: (1) the material fact which rests upon the view of the ‘prudent insurer’ makes it difficult for the assured to determine for himself the fact to be disclosed (2) in case of non-disclosure, the remedy of avoidance applies regardless of culpability of the <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>breach.</b> As such, the reform to the law is inevitable and the purpose of this thesis is to suggest how reform can be achieved. Two possible ways to bring the change to the law are considered. These are (1) to adopt the alternative solutions identified in other jurisdictions or (2) to re-consider whether the law on duty of disclosure as has been recognised since the seminal judgment of Lord Mansfield in Carter v. Boehm (1766) 3 Burr. 1905 has been correctly applied. This thesis concludes that the judgment of Lord Mansfield has been misunderstood in the UK and that, to constitute non-disclosure, only the deliberate intention is required and that the remedy of avoidance is justifiable upon the public policy ground. Such duty should be based upon the broad notion of good faith (bonae fidei), a flexible concept of fairness and justice. In the end, the draft provisions are formulated to reflect these suggestions.

40|$|First {{published}} online: August 11, 2015 Contractual relationships {{may have}} different content and functions {{depending on whether the}} enterprises operate in global open markets or in ‘close’ global supply chains (GSCs). GSCs are characterized, at least for an important segment, by stable and long-term relationships, a higher level of interdependencies, risks of opportunism and the necessity of stronger coordination among players located in different jurisdictions. Intermediaries, including certifiers, play an important role and favour coordination and cooperation along the chain influencing joint problem solving. By looking at contractual practices and the interplay with certification schemes, the authors observe that a cooperative approach to remedies against breach in food global value chains may require: (i) redefining the performance/breach divide; (ii) giving priority to corrective measures and other remedies in kind over contract termination whenever the former are possible and proportionate; (iii) vesting the <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>breach</b> with a right to correct non-performance when contract termination would cause the waste of relevant investments; (iv) expecting the aggrieved party to cooperate in both preventing the breach and mitigating its consequences; and (v) expecting the parties to consider the option of renegotiating contract terms after a breach whenever agreement on different conditions enables them to address the consequences of the breach with mutual advantage in the long run. From this analysis the authors draw normative implications concerning some of the most commonly applied doctrines in transnational commercial contracts and suggest changes and integrations to increase the effectiveness of cooperation. The article suggests expanding both the number and scope of doctrines related to remedies and revisiting their content in order to better reflect the need for stability, the focus on compliance and the integration of third parties’ interest into commercial transactions. The suggested changes, of particular relevance for long-term contracts in agri-food GSCs, may have broader scope and be applied to other GSCs where similar developments have taken place...|$|E
40|$|The default {{construction}} of pre-emption agreements proposed by Bhana is {{heavily influenced by}} the assumption that every contract of pre-emption entails that upon occurrence of a 'trigger event' an enforceable obligation to make an offer arises. As already noted, in Bhana’s construction, any manifestation {{of a desire to}} sell should amount to such a trigger event. Her assumption is mistaken. As argued in detail elsewhere (Naude 2004 South African Law Journal 636), two types of rights of pre-emption should be recognized when formulating residual rules for preference agreements / pre-emption agreements which contain an obligation not to contract with a third party first. As far as residual rules are concerned, any lesser manifestation of a desire to sell should only trigger a right to buy where the price at which the holder may buy is predetermined in the pre-emption contract itself (including by the creation of some mechanism for future determination of the price). This would be the case, for example, where the holder has a right to buy at a price to be determined by a third party when the grantor decides to sell. In that case, the grantor has no interest in sounding out the market. This type of (rare) right of pre-emption amounts to a conditional option, the condition being a manifestation of a decision to sell. But where the price is not pre-determined there are important policy reasons why only a contract with or offer to a third <b>party</b> <b>in</b> <b>breach</b> of the right of pre-emption should trigger the holder's right to buy. Inter alia, the grantor has a legitimate interest in sounding out the market first by soliciting offers from third parties and negotiating with third parties etc {{in order to determine the}} best possible price available, as long as the grantor does not offer to contract with or contracts with a third party first, but gives the holder the first chance to match a price offered by a third party for example. There are no reported South African cases in which a holder was entitled to exercise a right of pre-emption upon a lesser manifestation of a desire to sell. The suggestion in Soteriou v Retco Poyntons that "refusal imports an offer" to be made once the grantor desires to contract was only obiter as in that case the grantor did contract with a third party first without giving the holder a chance to contract first...|$|E
