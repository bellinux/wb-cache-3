During his {{undergraduate}} years, he received a University Gold Medal in both physics and chemistry. Slotin received a B.Sc. degree in geology from the university in 1932 and a M.Sc. degree in 1933. With the assistance {{of one of his}} mentors, he obtained a fellowship to study at King's College London under the supervision of Arthur John Allmand, the chair of the chemistry department, who specialized in the field of applied electrochemistry and <b>photochemistry.</b>|$|E
5|$|Photons {{can also}} be absorbed by nuclei, atoms or molecules, {{provoking}} transitions between their energy levels. A classic example is the molecular transition of retinal (C20H28O), {{which is responsible for}} vision, as discovered in 1958 by Nobel laureate biochemist George Wald and co-workers. The absorption provokes a cis-trans isomerization that, in combination with other such transitions, is transduced into nerve impulses. The absorption of photons can even break chemical bonds, as in the photodissociation of chlorine; this is the subject of <b>photochemistry.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many {{important}} processes involve <b>photochemistry.</b> The premier {{example is}} photosynthesis, {{in which most}} plants use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose, disposing of oxygen as a side-product. Humans rely on <b>photochemistry</b> {{for the formation of}} vitamin D, and vision is initiated by a photochemical reaction of rhodopsin. In fireflies, an enzyme in the abdomen catalyzes a reaction that results in bioluminescence. Many significant photochemical reactions, such as ozone formation, occur in the Earth atmosphere and constitute atmospheric chemistry.|$|E

25|$|As an {{exception}} to the conventional radical ion pair model, this mode of covalent bond formation is of interest to <b>photochemistry</b> research, as well as the many biological fields using fluorescence spectroscopy techniques. Evidence for the bonded exciplex intermediate has been given in studies of steric and Coulombic effects on the quenching rate constants and from extensive density functional theory computations that show a curve crossing between the ground state and the low-energy bonded exciplex state.|$|E
25|$|Beckman married Mabel on June 10, 1925. In 1926 {{the couple}} {{moved back to}} California and Beckman resumed his studies at Caltech. He became {{interested}} in ultraviolet photolysis and worked with his doctoral advisor, Roscoe G. Dickinson, on an instrument to find the energy of ultraviolet light. It worked by shining the ultraviolet light onto a thermocouple, converting the incident heat into electricity, which drove a galvanometer. After receiving a Ph.D. in <b>photochemistry</b> in 1928 for this application of quantum theory to chemical reactions, Beckman was asked to stay on at Caltech as an instructor {{and then as a}} professor. Linus Pauling, another of Roscoe G. Dickinson's graduate students, was also asked to stay on at Caltech.|$|E
25|$|His {{academic}} career began in 1948 with a teaching position at Iowa State College; {{he served as}} Assistant Professor of Chemistry. In his capacity there he published Hammon's postulate which has widely known {{as the most important}} publication in the field of organic <b>photochemistry.</b> He moved to the University of Oxford and University of Basel as a Guggenheim Fellow and National Science Foundation Fellow, respectively. In 1958, he moved to the California Institute of Technology as a Professor of Organic Chemistry. Later he was appointed the Arthur Amos Noyes Professor of Chemistry and subsequently went on to lead the Departments of Chemistry and Chemical Engineering. After 14 years teaching and serving as an academic administrator at Caltech he moved in 1972 to the University of Santa Clara. At Santa Clara he served as both a professor and the Chancellor of the natural sciences.|$|E
25|$|The high {{symmetry}} of the double-cone topology of the linear E ⊗ e JT system directly reflects the high underlying symmetry. It {{is one of}} the earliest (if not the earliest) examples in the literature of a conical intersection of potential energy surfaces. Conical intersections have received wide attention in the literature starting in the 1990s and are now considered paradigms of nonadiabatic excited-state dynamics, with far-reaching consequences in molecular spectroscopy, <b>photochemistry</b> and photophysics. Some of these will be commented upon further below. In general, conical intersections are far less symmetric than depicted in the figure. They can be tilted and elliptical in shape etc., and also peaked and sloped intersections have been distinguished in the literature. Furthermore, for more than two degrees of freedom, they are not point-like structures but instead they are seams and complicated, curved hypersurfaces, also known as intersection space. The coordinate sub-space displayed in the figure is also known as a branching plane.|$|E
25|$|MOFs {{might prove}} useful for both {{photochemical}} and polymerization reactions {{due to the}} tuneability of {{the size and shape}} of their pores. A 3D MOF { • 4DMF • H2O} (bpdc: biphenyldicarboxylate, bpy: 4,4′-bipyridine) was synthesized by Li and coworkers. Using this MOF <b>photochemistry</b> of o-methyl dibenzyl ketone (o-MeDBK) was extensively studied. This molecule was found to have a variety of photochemical reaction properties including the production of cyclopentanol. MOFs have been used to study polymerization in the confined space of MOF channels. Polymerization reactions in confined space might have different properties than polymerization in open space. Styrene, divinylbenzene, substituted acetylenes, methyl methacrylate, and vinyl acetate have all been studied by Kitagawa and coworkers as possible activated monomers for radical polymerization. Due to the different linker size the MOF channel size could be tunable on the order of roughly 25 and 100 Å2. The channels were shown to stabilize propagating radicals and suppress termination reactions when used as radical polymerization sites.|$|E
25|$|In 1890, Prokudin-Gorsky married Anna Aleksandrovna Lavrova, {{and later}} the couple had two sons, Mikhail and Dmitri, and a {{daughter}}, Ekaterina. Anna {{was the daughter of}} the Russian industrialist Aleksandr Stepanovich Lavrov, an active member in the Imperial Russian Technical Society (IRTS). Prokudin-Gorsky subsequently became the director of the executive board of Lavrov's metal works near Saint Petersburg and remained so until the October Revolution. He also joined Russia's oldest photographic society, the photography section of the IRTS, presenting papers and lecturing on the science of photography. In 1901, he established a photography studio and laboratory in Saint Petersburg. In 1902, he traveled to Berlin and spent six weeks studying color sensitization and three-color photography with <b>photochemistry</b> professor Adolf Miethe, the most advanced practitioner in Germany at that time. Throughout the years, Prokudin-Gorsky's photographic work, publications and slide shows to other scientists and photographers in Russia, Germany and France earned him praise, and in 1906 he was elected the president of the IRTS photography section and editor of Russia's main photography journal, the Fotograf-Liubitel.|$|E

Hammond would go on to invent Hammond's postulate, revolutionizing activation levels in chemical compounds. In physics, 1974 alumnus Steven Girvin, credited his time at the college as pivotal in his development of the fractional quantum Hall effect, now a pillar in Hall conductance. During the development and production of the first nuclear weapons during World War II, two students researching nuclear chemistry at the college were hired by the United States Army Corps of Engineers as part of the first Manhattan project scientific team.|$|E

2500|$|In sea water, ROS can be {{generated}} through abiotic as well as biotic processes, among which are the radiolysis and photolysis of water molecules and cellular respiration. [...] According to a model proposed by Fan for the prediction of ROS in surface waters, the biochemistry mediated by phytoplankton {{may be just as}} important for the production of ROS as <b>photochemistry.</b> Biological ROS is often synthesized in mitochondrial membranes, as well as the endoplasmic reticulum of animals, plants, and some bacteria. In addition, chloroplasts and the organelles peroxisomes and glyoxysomes are also sites for the generation of ROS. [...] The ROS most likely released to the environment are those produced at the cell surface as electrons get [...] "leaked" [...] from the respiratory chain and react with molecular oxygen, O2. [...] The products of this subsequent reduction of molecular oxygen are what are referred to as reactive oxygen species. [...] Thus, the production of ROS is in direct proportion to the concentration of O2 in the system, with increases of O2 leading to higher production of ROS. There are three main reactive oxygen species: the superoxide anion (O2−), hydrogen peroxide (H2O2), and the hydroxyl radical (OH•). [...] The superoxide anion is formed directly from the one-electron reduction of molecular oxygen. Hydrogen peroxide is then formed from the disproportionation of the superoxide anion. [...] This reaction occurs very quickly in seawater. [...] Next, the reduction of hydrogen peroxide yields the hydroxyl radical, H2O2↔2OH•, which can then get reduced to the hydroxyl ion and water. [...] However, the presence of reactive oxygen species in marine systems is hard to detect and measure accurately, for a number of reasons. [...] First, ROS concentrations are generally low (nanomoles) in seawater. [...] Second, they may react with other hard to identify molecules that occur in low quantities, resulting in unknown products. [...] Finally, they are (for the most part) transient intermediates, having lifetimes as little as microseconds.|$|E
