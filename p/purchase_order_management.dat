40|$|In {{recognition}} of the increasing importance of globalization and the resulting need for greater, faster and more flexible communications, a framework is required to allow any company to establish itself in no time or make optimum use of their legacy applications and run efficiently with minimal cost input. This paper presents such a framework called ELPIF for e-logistics processes integration based on Web Services via incorporating (1) common alliance layer (2) adaptation layer; and (3) dynamic data binding mechanism. This framework can be adopted as a new service delivery model which uses a design pattern and solution templates. The interaction between the e-logistics processes and business process manager that orchestrates e-logistics processes in an e-business solution will be described in this paper. A transportation planning in the <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> <b>management</b> process of a B 2 B solution is used as an example to illustrate the usage of ELPIF by encapsulating United Parcel Service (UPS) on-line XML Tools as Web Services.

40|$|With {{the advent}} of Service Oriented Architecture (SOA), {{organizations}} tend to use service-based applications (SBAs) that are dynamic, distributed, and ubiquitous. In recent years, SBAs have become {{the state of the}} art technologies for building large-scale and cost-effective applications on the web. SBAs that automate end-to-end business processes typically involve well–defined standard composite activities that are hosted at the sites of business partners. These activities encapsulate one to many operations. A business transaction is the successful execution of these operations that must satisfy the trading partners agreements which contain the clauses agreed upon by the business partners. In order to ensure the agreement is satisfied during operations, business transactions have to be designed by correlating agreements. Furthermore, business transactions are collaborative, distributed, and long-running and thus they are prone to failure. Therefore, flexibility is a paramount importance for business transactions. A business transaction model should provide design-elements and techniques to design highly flexible business transactions by correlating the trading partner agreements. Unfortunately, there is a dearth of a model that enables designing flexible business transactions by correlating the business perspective elements with the functional perspective elements. Existing business transaction models provide a limited number of design–elements and techniques. None of the existing business transaction models are able to provide the necessary and sufficient design-elements and techniques. Accordingly, there is a strong need for a business transaction model which is capable of addressing these shortcomings. This research has developed Solúbtha business transaction model that enables designing business transactions by correlating the business and functional perspective of end-to-end <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> <b>management</b> processes. Additionally, this thesis has extended the theory of classical atomic behaviour of business transactions to enable designing highly–flexible behaviour of business transactions. The model is built on five properties: fault-tolerance, failure-resiliency, operational autonomy, non-determinism, and extensibility, which are the basic building blocks of flexible behaviour of business transactions. The model is capable of providing recovery operators and other elements that are needed for implementing these properties...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{the problem of}} a group company that purchases one kind of products from a single supplier. Such companies typically consist of one headquarters and several geographically dispersed and operationally semi-autonomous subsidiaries. It is of great significance what and how the headquarters should provide services to its subsidiaries in terms of inventory and sourcing management. This paper focuses on headquarters-centered sourcing management services. Two sourcing management models are formulated. One is Subsidiary-Autonomous Sourcing Management (SD-ASM) where subsidiaries manage their inventories and place <b>purchasing</b> <b>orders</b> relatively independent of each other. The other is the Headquarters-centered Common Sourcing <b>Management</b> (HQ-CSM) where <b>purchasing</b> <b>orders</b> of all the subsidiaries are processed by the headquarter. In HQ-CSM, two <b>purchasing</b> <b>order</b> <b>management</b> policies are proposed. One is Order Coordination Policy in which common replenishment epochs or time periods are proposed by the headquarter and the subsidiaries are encouraged to coordinate the timing of their orders based on the common replenishment epochs. The other is Order Consolidation Policy in which the subsidiaries are enticed by a price discount to combine the quantity of their orders and the headquarter places a combined order with the supplier. In SD-ASM, each subsidiary places replenishment orders at any time interval corresponding to their economic order quantity (EOQ). In the Order Coordination Policy of HQ-CSM, the classic RAND heuristic to solve the well-known Joint Replenishment Problem is used {{to find the best}} common replenishment epoch and the best replenishment timing of each subsidiary. In the Order Consolidation Policy of HQ-CSM, the optimal order quantity of the combined order can be obtained from the mathematical model. Then, the combined order is allocated to the subsidiaries according to the proportional allocation rule. A series of simulation experiments is conducted to compare order quantities and costs in SD-ASM and HQ-CSM. The results show that. This achievement is largely due to the economies of process (simplified ordering process and reduced ordering cost) in the Order Coordination Policy and the economies of scale (large order quantity) in the Order Consolidation Policy. © 2011 IEEE. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

40|$|Logistics, {{as defined}} by the Council of Logistics Management, ―is that part of the supply chain process that plans, {{implements}} and controls the efficient, effective flow and storage of goods, services and related information from the point of origin to the point of consumption in order to meet customer’s requirements. ‖ To make this happen, transportation, distribution, warehousing, <b>purchasing</b> and <b>order</b> <b>management</b> organizations must execute together. Traditional approaches used by any environment using old systems stitched together by spreadsheets and manual procedure could not cope with the exploding complexity. They diverge in maturity and scope of coverage. The traditional Logistics tool is very slow in process execution and they lack of automation and decisions. By the use of multi-agent base architecture for Supply chain Logistics, it over comes the limitation of traditional logistics tools. In this paper we will show how Multi-agent Software (MAS) architecture interacts in the integrated Logistics architecture with the help of various intelligent agents to overcome limitations of Traditional approaches. Second aim is to design a flexible architecture that can deal with next generation supply chain problems based on a multi-agent architecture. Here in this article, a multi agent system has been developed to simulate a multi supply chain logistics. Each entity is modeled as one agent and their coordination and negotiation mechanism help an organization to control inventories and minimize the total cost of SC by sharing information and forecasting knowledge...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} in this paper was done in CV. Rooesman, a small scale shoes and bag manufacturer company located in Yogyakarta Indonesia. Their strategy to response the demand is make-to-order. This company receives many <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> from several countries such as Japan, South Korea, and USA. Each <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> is unique for example in term of design, complexity of the production process and raw material needed. Currently CV. Rooesman has difficulty to select which <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> should be accepted. Ideally, all <b>purchase</b> <b>orders</b> from the customers have to be accepted. However due to the some factors such as limitation of resources that the company have i. e. human resources (number of workers and skill of workers needed) and other factor such as characteristic of the <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> the company have to select which <b>purchase</b> <b>order</b> should be accepted.
