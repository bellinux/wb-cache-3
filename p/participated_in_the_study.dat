25|$|Women who {{experience}} domestic violence overwhelmingly {{tend to have}} greater overall emotional distress, as well as disturbingly high occurrences of suicidal thoughts and attempts. According {{to a study by}} the National Centre for Biotechnology Information, suicide attempts in India are correlated with physical and psychological intimate partner violence. Of the Indian women who <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> 7.5% reported attempting suicide. This correlation is supported by the high rates of domestic violence in India, although the rates differ greatly by region, individual socioeconomic status and other factors.|$|E
25|$|One study, {{sponsored}} by NIDA, randomly assigned cocaine abusers into four groups, individual drug counseling plus group drug counseling (GDC), cognitive therapy plus GDC, supportive expressive therapy plus GDC, or GDC alone. Individual drug counseling {{was based on}} the 12-step philosophy. Group drug counseling was designed to educate patients about the stages of recovery from addiction, to strongly encourage participation in 12-step programs, and to provide a supportive group atmosphere for initiating abstinence and an alternative lifestyle.

In response {{to a series of}} survey questions, the Marines felt Pointman allowed them to realistically: control viewing, perform tactical movements, control the virtual rifle, utilize cover, and control the avatar’s posture. They found it comfortable, easy to use, and that it enhanced the simulation. The primary recommendation of the MUA report was: “Transition the Pointman DISI (dismounted infantry simulation interface) enhancements into VBS2 to increase realism and efficacy as a virtual training aid.” ...|$|E
2500|$|The US Public Health Study of Syphilis at Tuskegee {{began as}} a 6-month {{descriptive}} epidemiological study {{of the range of}} pathology associated with syphilis in the Macon County population. At that time, it was believed that the effects of syphilis depended on the race of those affected. For African Americans, physicians believed that their cardiovascular system was more affected than the central nervous system. Initially, subjects were studied for six to eight months and then treated with contemporary methods, including Salvarsan, mercurial ointments, and bismuth. These methods were, at best, mildly effective. [...] The disadvantage that these treatments were all highly toxic. The Tuskegee Institute <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study,</b> as its representatives understood the intent was to benefit public health in the local poor population. The Tuskegee University-affiliated hospital effectively loaned the PHS its medical facilities, and other predominantly black institutions and local black doctors participated as well.|$|E
2500|$|There {{are very}} few {{specialist}} schools for gifted children. As German schools do not IQ-test children, most intellectually gifted children remain unaware that they fall into this category. The German psychologist, Detlef H. Rost, carried out a pioneer long-term study on gifted children called the Marburger Hochbegabtenprojekt. In 1987/1988 he tested 7000 third graders on a test based on the German version of the Cattell Culture Fair III test. Those who scored at least two standard deviations above the mean were categorised as gifted. A total of 151 gifted subjects <b>participated</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>study</b> alongside 136 controls. [...] All {{participants in the study}} were tested blind with the result that they did not discover whether they were gifted or not. The study revealed that the gifted children did very well in school. The vast majority later attended a Gymnasium and achieved good grades. However, 15 percent, were classified as underachievers because they attended a Realschule (two cases) or a Hauptschule (one case), had repeated a grade (four cases) or had grades that put them in the lower half of their class (the rest of cases). The report also concluded that most gifted persons had high self-esteem and good psychological health. Rost said that he was not in favour of special schools for the gifted. Gifted children seemed to be served well by Germany's existing school system.|$|E
