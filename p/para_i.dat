States should eliminate all violations of human rights and their causes, as well as obstacles to the enjoyment of these rights."And on ratification of international treaties on human rights, the VDPA states in Part <b>I,</b> <b>para</b> 26 that it [...] "welcomes the progress made in the codification of human rights instruments, which is a dynamic and evolving process, and urges the universal ratification of human rights treaties. All States are encouraged to accede to these international instruments; all States are encouraged to avoid, as far as possible, the resort to reservations."And on remedy and redress of human rights violation, VDPA states in Part <b>I,</b> <b>para</b> 27 that [...] "Every State should provide an effective framework of remedies and redress human rights grievances or violations. The administration of justice, including law enforcement and prosecutorial agencies and, especially, an independent judiciary and legal profession in full conformity with applicable standards contained in international human rights instruments, are essential to the full and non-discriminatory realization of human rights and indispensable to the processes of democracy and sustainable development".|$|R
