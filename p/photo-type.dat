40|$|Aims. We {{present a}} method, named <b>photo-type,</b> to {{identify}} and accurately classify L and T dwarfs onto the standard spectral classification system using photometry alone. This enables the creation of large and deep homogeneous samples of these objects efficiently, {{without the need for}} spectroscopy. Methods. We created a catalogue of point sources with photometry in 8 bands, ranging from 0. 75 to 4. 6 microns, selected from an area of 3344 deg^ 2, by combining SDSS, UKIDSS LAS, and WISE data. Sources with 13. 0 0. 8, were then classified by comparison against template colours of quasars, stars, and brown dwarfs. The L and T templates, spectral types L 0 to T 8, were created by identifying previously known sources with spectroscopic classifications, and fitting polynomial relations between colour and spectral type. Results. Of the 192 known L and T dwarfs with reliable photometry in the surveyed area and magnitude range, 189 are recovered by our selection and classification method. We have quantified the accuracy of the classification method both externally, with spectroscopy, and internally, by creating synthetic catalogues and accounting for the uncertainties. We find that, brighter than J = 17. 5, <b>photo-type</b> classifications are accurate to one spectral sub-type, and are therefore competitive with spectroscopic classifications. The resultant catalogue of 1157 L and T dwarfs will be presented in a companion paper. Comment: 15 pages, 12 figures, Accepted for publication in A &...|$|E
40|$|We present {{photometric}} typing {{analyses of}} three young supernovae observed with the Robotic 60 -inch Telescope at Palomar Observatory (P 60). This represents {{the first time}} that such <b>photo-typing</b> has been attempted, in a blind fashion, on newly-discovered supernovae. For one of the target supernovae, SN 2004 cs, our photometry provided the first constraint on the SN type, which we predicted would be type Ia. To the contrary, however, our subsequent Keck spectroscopy shows it to be an unusual type II supernova. For each of the other two supernovae, SN 2004 dh (type II) and SN 2004 dk (type Ib), our <b>photo-typing</b> results are consistent with the known type of the event as determined from ground-based spectroscopy; however, the colors of SN 2004 dk are also consistent with a type Ic or type II classification. We discuss our approach to the challenges of <b>photo-typing</b> - contamination by host galaxy light and the unknown photometric quality of the data - in the case where it is desirable to complete the analysis with just one night of observations. The growing interest in the properties and behavior of very young supernovae, and the increased discovery rate for such events, mean that prompt <b>photo-typing</b> analyses can provide useful input to observational campaigns. Our results demonstrate the value and feasibility of such a project for P 60, at the same time illustrating its chief inherent shortcoming: an inability to identify new and unusual events as such without later spectroscopic observations.

40|$|Background: The rate of {{non-compliance}} with vitamin D supplementation {{is as high}} as 45 %. This is why randomised controlled {{trials are}} needed to analyse the response to low doses of vitamin D 3. Objective: (1) To compare supplementation with 250 versus 500 units of vitamin D 3 and (2) to analyse sun exposure time/ultraviolet B (UVB) exposure during the first 6 weeks of life. Design: 40 breastfed infants (skin <b>photo-types</b> I, II) were recruited in Berlin, Germany (52. 5 °N), during summer (n= 20) and winter (n= 20) and randomised into equal groups on either 250 or 500 units of vitamin D 3 per day. Outcome measures were: parameters of vitamin D and bone metabolism at delivery and 6 weeks later, sun exposure time, UVB dosimetry and surrounding factors including maternal diet. Results: At delivery 25 -hydroxy vitamin D levels were insufficient: 68 (53 – 83) nmol/l in each group. 6 weeks later levels were sufficient: 139 (114 – 164) nmol/l on 250 units of vitamin D 3 per day and 151 (126 – 176) nmol/l on 500 units/day. There was no seasonal variation. Daily sun exposure time was 0. 4 – 3. 5 h and higher in summer. UVB exposure was 0. 01 – 0. 08 minimal erythema dose/day. Calcium levels were within normal. Conclusions: In Berlin, Germany, supplementation with 250 units of vitamin D 3 is sufficient for breastfed infants during their first 6 weeks of life in summer and winter.

40|$|When {{brown dwarfs}} were first {{discovered}} two decades ago, they were introduced as {{the missing link}} between stars and giant planets. This led to {{the extension of the}} stellar classification sequence down to the planetary regime by introducing the spectral types L,T and Y. We are now in the era of brown dwarf science where large homogeneous samples can be produced, allowing us to learn about their physical properties in a statistically meaningful way. In this thesis we present a new method, dubbed <b>photo-type,</b> which makes the classification of L 0 -T 8 dwarfs significantly faster as it only relies on already available multi-wavelength photometry. It is based on χ 2 template fitting and can be adapted to use on any photometric data. <b>photo-type</b> classifies L and T dwarfs to an accuracy better than 1 spectral type, making it comparable to spectroscopy. This is tested by a range of different methods, ranging from simulations to spectroscopic follow up. By searching the SDSS+UKIDSS+WISE for L and T dwarfs with 13. 0 < J < 17. 5 we produce the largest homogeneous sample of these dwarfs to date. These 1157 L and T dwarfs are used to find peculiar objects and populations (e. g. blue/red outliers), L/T binaries, and benchmark systems (by crossmatching with a proper motion catalogue). It also allows us to calculate the best estimates of the space densities of L and T dwarfs to date. By following up several of the peculiar ultra cool dwarfs in our sample, we found a very young object (10 Myrs), a number of dusty sources, and some that remain unexplained. Finally, we conducted a general search for rare objects in UKIDSS. Here we were interested in finding high redshift quasars, very cold white dwarfs or a yet unknown population by analysing objects with large χ 2 values. While none of the above were found, we did find a moderate temperature H and He atmosphere white dwarf, a carbon star and some medium redshift quasars. Open Acces...|$|E

40|$|We have {{developed}} a method "photo-type" to identify and accurately classify L and T dwarfs, onto the standard system, from photometry alone. We combine SDSS, UKIDSS and WISE data and classify point sources by comparing the izYJHKW 1 W 2 colours against template colours for quasars, stars, and brown dwarfs. In a sample of 6. 5 × 10 ^ 6 bright point sources, J< 17. 5, from 3150 deg^ 2, we identify and type 898 L and T dwarfs, making this the largest homogeneously selected sample of brown dwarfs to date. The sample includes 713 (125) new (previously known) L dwarfs and 21 (39) T dwarfs. For the previously-known sources, the scatter in the plot of <b>photo-type</b> vs spectral type indicates that our photo-types are accurate to 1. 5 (1. 0) sub-types rms for L (T) dwarfs. Peculiar objects and candidate unresolved binaries are identified.

40|$|A {{systematic}} {{revision of}} the literature was conducted in order to undertake a comprehensive meta-analysis of all published observational studies on melanoma. An extensive analysis of the inconsistencies and variability in the estimates was performed to provide some clues about its Epidemiology. Following a systematic literature search, relative risks (RRs) for sun exposure were extracted from 57 studies published before September 2002. Intermittent sun exposure and sunburn history were shown to play considerable roles as risk factors for melanoma, whereas a high occupational sun exposure seemed to be inversely associated to melanoma. The country of study and adjustment of the estimates adjuste for phenotype and <b>photo-type</b> {{were significantly associated with}} the variability of the intermittent sun exposure estimates (P = 0. 024, 0. 003 and 0. 030, respectively). For chronic sun exposure, inclusion of controls with dermatological diseases and latitude resulted in significantly different data (P = 0. 05 and 0. 031, respectively). Latitude was also shown to be important (P = 0. 031) for a history of sunburn; studies conducted at higher latitudes presented higher risks for a history of sunburns. Role of country, inclusion of controls with dermatological diseases and other study features seemed to suggest that "well conducted" studies supported the intermittent sun exposure hypothesis: a positive association for intermittent sun exposure and an inverse association with a high continuous pattern of sun exposure.

40|$|No {{human cancer}} is as {{aggressive}} as melanoma [1, 2]. Cutaneous melanoma is a quiet, but rapid invasive life threatening tumor. The extreme aggressivity might {{be avoided by}} prophylaxis:- {{the patient and the}} physician should identify the risk factors for melanoma [3, 4] (cutaneous <b>photo-type,</b> familial heritage of moles and melanoma, aggressive exposure to sunlight, a significant num-ber of moles etc.); this way implies a surveillance schedule, including a periodical clinical and/or dermoscopical examination;- revealing as early as possible a cutaneous melanoma, because the earlier the lesion is recog-nized, the faster (and optimal) therapy can be adopted [5, 6]; The images presented here are selected from 42 cases of patients diagnosed with cutaneous melanoma by digi-tal dermoscopic (Fotofinder, Nikon Coolpix 4500, and Immersiosal) and histopathologic criteria. Identification of elementary dermoscopic lesions enables the accurate diagnosis for cutaneous melanoma [7 – 11]. Although there are several algorithms for diagno-sis of pigmentary lesions, the surface microscopical identification of elementary dermoscopic lesions should become the routine step before the surgical approach. We support the idea that dermoscopy is more than an ‘extension of the clinician eye ’ [7]. Using dermoscopy, the accuracy of the diagnosis of cutaneous melanoma may increase from 65 – 80 % to 70 – 95 %, depending on clinician’s and/or dermo-scopist’s training, respectively. In conclusion, our images intend to be an argument for the obligativeness of the dermoscopical technique before the surgical procedure.

This study was encouraged by the possibility to collect data of personal UV exposure in the mountainous areas of Italy, for the first time. Personal UV exposure (expressed in terms of Exposure Ratio, ER) of two groups of volunteers (ski instructors and skiers) at the Alpine site of La Thuile (Valle d'Aosta region, Italy) was assessed using polysulphone dosimetry which was tested in a mountainous snow-covered environment. In addition measurements of biological markers of individual response to UV exposure such as skin colorimetric parameters were carried out. It was found that snow and altitude of study site affect calibration curves of polysulphone dosimeters in comparison to a situation without snow. The median ER, {{taking into account the}} whole sample, is 0. 60 in winter, with a range of 0. 29 to 1. 46, and 1. 02 in spring, ranging from 0. 46 to 1. 72. There are no differences in exposures across skiers and instructors in spring while in winter skiers experience lower values. UV exposures are not sensitive to the use of sunscreen across instructor/skier group by day or by seasons or by <b>photo-type.</b> With regard to colorimetric parameters, the main result was that both skiers and instructors had on average significantly lower values of L* and b* after exposure i. e. becoming darker but the inappropriate sunscreen use did not reveal any changes in skin colorimetric parameters except in one spring day. In conclusions UV intensities on the ski-fields are often significantly higher than those on horizontal surfaces. Given the high levels of exposure observed in the present study, dedicated public heath messages on the correct sunscreen use should be adopted...|$|E
40|$|A {{published}} meta-analysis {{on breast}} cancer and vegetables and fruit consumption was described to present a methodology used on meta-analysis in Epidemiology. Meta-analysis confirmed the association between intake of vegetables (RR= 0. 74; 95 %CI 0. 65 - 0. 84) and, to a lesser extent, fruit and breast cancer risk (RR= 0. 93; 95 %CI 0. 79 - 1. 09). Using this methodology, present in a peer-reviewed journal, a systematic meta-analysis on melanoma was conducted extracting RRs from published studies. Fully adjusted estimates were obtained from those studies, when available; RRs adjusted for confounders not related to sun exposure, such as naevi, were considered for sun exposure and sunburns pooled estimates. Pooled estimates were obtained for all main risk factors for melanoma: sun exposure (total, intermittent and chronic), sunburns (in childhood and in adulthood), indicators of actinic damage, family history of melanoma and phenotype characteristics. Investigation of biases and inconsistencies among studies {{was one of the}} key phases of the meta-analysis to look for patterns among studies that might explain discrepant findings. The analyses on pigmented lesions and sun exposure showed that the choice of sources of cases and controls influenced significantly the estimate. An indication of a protective effect of chronic sun exposure came from studies that did not include subjects with dermatological problems (significantly different from the other studies: p= 0. 01). Publication year was an important factor for total sun exposure (p= 0. 005). Latitude of the study seemed to be an important factor for sunburns (p= 0. 002) and for high density of freckles (p= 0. 04). Estimates for hair colour and eye colour adjusted for phenotype and/or <b>photo-type</b> were significantly lower than unadjusted ones (p= 0. 06 and p= 0. 06, respectively).

40|$|Mountain sites {{experience}} enhanced UV radiation levels due to {{the concurrent}} effects of shorter radiation path-length, low aerosol load and high reflectivity of the snow surfaces. This study was encouraged by the possibility to collect original data of personal dose on a specific anatomical site (erythemally effective UV dose on the forehead) of two groups of volunteers (ski instructors and skiers) in the mountainous areas of Italy (the Alpine site of La Thuile-Les Suches in Valle d'Aosta region). Personal doses were assessed using polysulphone dosimetry. Exposure Ratio (ER), defined as the ratio between the personal dose and the corresponding ambient dose (i. e. erythemally weighted dose received by a horizontal surface) during the same exposure period was taken into account. In addition measuring skin colours as biological markers of individual response to UV exposure, was also carried out on the forearm and cheek of each volunteer before and after exposure. The median ER, {{taking into account the}} whole sample, is 0. 60 in winter, with a range of 0. 29 to 1. 46, and 1. 02 in spring, ranging from 0. 46 to 1. 72. No differences in ERs were found between skiers and instructors in spring while in winter skiers experienced lower values. Regarding skin colorimetric parameters the main result was that both skiers and instructors had on average significantly lower values of luminance after exposure i. e. ~they became darker. It was found that the use of sunscreen and individual skin <b>photo-type</b> did not produce significant variations in ER across instructor/skier group by day and by seasons (p&gt; 0. 05). It seems that sunscreen use only {{at the beginning of the}} exposure or in a few cases a couple of times during exposure (at difference with the specific instructions sheets), was not sufficient to change significantly skin colorimetric parameters across participants. In conclusion UV personal doses on the ski-fields are often significantly higher than those on horizontal surfaces and consistently more intense respect to personal doses received by sunbathers on the beach in central Italy (ER range: 0. 09 – 0. 42). Given the high levels of exposure observed in the present study, specific public health warnings with regards to the efficacy of sun-protection behaviours (proper application and re-application of sunscreen and protective measures such as hats and sun glasses) should be adopted...|$|E

Results: Almost 69. 2 % of students attended a solarium, 80. 8 % of cosmetology and 58. 2 % of physiotherapy. Nearly 66. 2 % of the respondents knew that solarium use is unhealthy. Students used more often sun-beds - 72. 2 %, cosmetology students used them (28. 6 %), but physiotherapy students 2 - 3 twice a year (31. 3 %). Most respondents (89. 2 %) {{argued that it was}} an independent decision. More than 90 % of surveyed students said that solarium staff instructed them on solariurm operation, and during visit at solarium they could use a paper towel (94. 6 %), cosmetics (95. 5 %), sun glasses (89. 2 %), and the staff sanitized device (97. 3 %). Almost 51. 4 % of the surveyed were against the solarium use by children or youths. Sixty-nine of the cosmetology and 62. 5 % of the physiotherapy students said that solarium-tanning is dangerous. Almost 3 / 4 of the respondents said that solarium-tanning is as dangerous as sun-tanning. SPF abbreviation was known by 70. 3 % of solarium advocates. Most respondents 71. 6 % used UV-protection cosmetics, summer usually (68. 9 %) and avoided tanning between Noon- 15 o'clock (56. 8 %). Tanorexia as ""an addiction to solarium-tanning"" was defined by 29. 7 % of the respondents.
