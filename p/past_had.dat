By 2010, when the case was argued before the Supreme Court, regulations from the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education and the American Osteopathic Association had limited work hours to about 80 hours per week, and a first-year resident at the Mayo Clinic made $47,259 plus benefits.|$|E

5|$|A Link to the Past {{is one of}} {{the best-selling}} SNES games, with 4.61 million units sold worldwide, and has had an {{exceptionally}} long stay on Nintendo Powers top games list (ranking number 2 in Nintendo Power's last issue in December 2012): when the SNES list was finally retired, A Link to the <b>Past</b> <b>had</b> more than five consecutive years in the number one spot. It was re-released as a Player's Choice title in North America, indicating that it has sold a minimum of one million copies there. In the United States, A Link to the Pasts Game Boy Advance version alone sold 1.4 million copies and earned $41 million by August 2006.

5|$|Cristina Yang, M.D., Ph.D., is {{a fictional}} {{character}} {{from the medical}} drama television series Grey's Anatomy, which has aired for over 12 years on the American Broadcasting Company (ABC) in the United States. The character was created by series producer Shonda Rhimes, and is portrayed by actress Sandra Oh. Introduced as a surgical intern at the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital, Yang worked her way up to resident level, eventually becoming a cardiothoracic surgical fellow, while her relationships with colleagues Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo), George O'Malley (T. R. Knight), Izzie Stevens (Katherine Heigl), and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers) formed a {{focal point of the}} series.

5|$|The Liverpool badge {{is based}} on the city's liver bird, which in the <b>past</b> <b>had</b> been placed inside a shield. In 1992, to commemorate the centennial of the club, a new badge was commissioned, {{including}} a representation of the Shankly Gates. The next year twin flames were added at either side, symbolic of the Hillsborough memorial outside Anfield, where an eternal flame burns in memory of those who died in the Hillsborough disaster. In 2012, Warrior Sports' first Liverpool kit removed the shield and gates, returning the badge to what had adorned Liverpool shirts in the 1970s; the flames were moved to the back collar of the shirt, surrounding the number 96 for the number who died at Hillsborough.|$|E
5|$|When the manga {{moved from}} weekly to monthly {{serialization}} in 2009, Hoshino heard concerns from readers about its possible cancellation and reassured {{them that the}} series would continue. She set up Kanda's backstory by introducing the Third Exorcists, characters related to him and Alma Karma. In Hoshino's original drafts, Kanda's <b>past</b> <b>had</b> a number of plot holes. A rewritten, published version had a young Kanda walking along a path surrounded by dead people who had cared for him. Due to its violence, the image was replaced with one in which Kanda learns that Alma Karma had killed them all. When the chapters were collected into a volume, Hoshino added a small chapter which included the corpses.|$|E

5|$|The game {{begins as}} Professor E. Gadd completes his newest {{invention}} {{of a time}} machine powered by a gem called the Cobalt Star, which is presented at Peach's Castle. Peach enters the time machine into the past, but fails to return, only leaving {{a member of an}} alien species known only as the Shroobs within the damaged time machine. The Mushroom Kingdom of the <b>past</b> <b>had</b> actually been invaded by the Shroobs, with Peach being kidnapped and held hostage at her castle. After defeating the monster, a time hole opens, leaving a passageway into the past. While searching for Peach, Mario and Luigi locate their younger selves, and agree to locate the crystal shards, which are remnants of the Cobalt Star which had been shattered during Peach's journey. Unwittingly, the brothers collect all of the shards, while being pestered by Baby Bowser (Bowser in the past) who wants the Cobalt Star. At the end, they restore the Cobalt Star only to unleash the Elder Princess Shroob, who serves as the game's final boss character. The story ends when she is defeated, Peach is rescued, and the past returns to normal.|$|E

25|$|One find {{from such}} a program was the sour gas {{discovery}} at the village of Caroline, Alberta in south-central Alberta, in the mid-1980s.

25|$|For this viewpoint, {{one should}} {{consider}} how the archetypical scattering experiment is performed. The initial particles are prepared in well defined states where they are so far apart that they don't interact. They are somehow made to interact, and the final particles are registered when they are so far apart that they have ceased to interact. The idea {{is to look for}} states in the Heisenberg picture that in the distant <b>past</b> <b>had</b> the appearance of free particle states. This will be the in states. Likewise, an out state will be a state that in the distant future has the appearance of a free particle state.|$|E
25|$|Owing to {{uncertainty}} in the historical record, it is often impossible to determine whether notable composers and musicians of the <b>past</b> <b>had</b> absolute pitch. Since absolute pitch is rare in European musical culture, claims that any particular musician possessed it are difficult to evaluate. Among composers of the Baroque and Classical eras, evidence is available only for Mozart, who is documented to have demonstrated the ability at age 7. Experts have only surmised that Beethoven had it, as indicated from some excerpts from his letters. By the 19th century, it became more common {{for the presence of}} absolute pitch to be recorded, identifying the ability to be present in musicians such as Camille Saint-Saëns and John Philip Sousa.|$|E

25|$|There was {{excitement}} that The Philadelphia Inquirer and the Philadelphia Daily News {{would be under}} local ownership {{for the first time}} since Walter Annenberg sold the paper to Knight Newspapers in 1969. The buyout was met with skepticism, however, among the employees at The Inquirer, who feared the new owners might threaten the editorial independence of the newspaper. Concerns were especially directed to Brian Tierney, who in the <b>past</b> <b>had</b> criticized Inquirer reporters for doing negative stories about his clients during his time at Tierney Communications. Tierney allayed fears by having the members of Philadelphia Media Holdings sign a pledge not to interfere with the paper's editorial independence. Tierney said he would combat The Inquirers decreasing revenue and circulation by spending millions on advertisements and promotions and not by laying off staff.|$|E
25|$|During {{the ancient}} Han Dynasty (202 BC-220 AD) of China, the sluice gate and canal lock of the flash lock had been known. By the 10th century the latter design was {{improved}} upon in China with {{the invention of}} the canal pound lock, allowing different adjusted levels of water along separated and gated segments of a canal. This innovation allowed for larger transport barges to pass safely without danger of wrecking upon the embankments, and was an innovation praised by those such as Shen Kuo (1031–1095). Shen also wrote in his Dream Pool Essays of the year 1088 that, if properly used, sluice gates positioned along irrigation canals were most effective in depositing silt for fertilization. Writing earlier in his Dongpo Zhilin of 1060, Su Shi came to a different conclusion, writing that the Chinese of a few centuries <b>past</b> <b>had</b> perfected this method and noted that it was ineffective in use by his own time.|$|E
25|$|As prime minister, David Cameron {{wanted to}} put family policy {{at the heart of}} the Conservative Party {{claiming}} British politics in the <b>past</b> <b>had</b> got it wrong. He stated families should be the most important thing in the country's life, believing social responsibility and a strong family was key to an individuals success, and by extent becoming less reliant on the state. Both Cameron and Theresa May have aimed at helping families achieve a work-home balance and have previously proposed to offer all parents 12 months parental leave, to be shared by mother and father as they choose. Other policies have included doubling the free hours of childcare for working parents of three and four-year-olds from 15 hours to 30 hours a week during term-time, and fund 15 hours a week of free childcare for all disadvantaged two-year-olds, worth £2,500 a year per child. Tax schemes to support families, freezing fuel duty, cutting income tax. David Cameron in a speech mentioned businesses will have to help cut the costs imposed on society and families through the decisions businesses make, by becoming more socially responsible which would in turn reduce the need for state control to solve the problem.|$|E
