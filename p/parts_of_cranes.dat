The simulation of wind field {{is to determine}} the accurate wind force acting on different <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>cranes</b> and serves as the basis of the windproof design. Taking 300 t shipbuliding gantry crane as the study object, this paper uses computational fluid dynamics, calculates the mechanical response of cranes by FLUENT, obtains the graphs of pressure, streamline, force distribution of cranes under different wind loads. Through the result analysis, dangerous force position is pointed out. And the ideas of structural methods to improve the windproof ability of cranes are also proposed...|$|E

The force <b>of</b> tower <b>crane</b> is {{extremely}} complex when climbing, and climbing frame {{is the key}} to structure loaded by forces of climbing working condition, which supports all loads <b>of</b> the upper <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the tower <b>crane</b> when climbing. The guide wheels are arranged on climbing frame, and play the guiding role between climbing frame and tower body. The guide wheel pressure can reflect the upper horizontal loads and unbalanced moment, and climbing press reflects the upper vertical loads. This article is based on the climbing press and guide wheel pressure to analyze loads state <b>of</b> the upper <b>part</b> <b>of</b> the tower <b>crane</b> when climbing, ensure the upper load values in a safe range when the tower crane climbing...|$|R

The simulator has also been prepared for interconnection to a vessel simulator. The crane simulator is validated qualitatively by simulations; the various modules have been validated separately, and, successively, the modules have been jointly validated, and finally, the complete simulator is validated.

40|$|In {{order to}} {{ascertain}} the reliability <b>of</b> a <b>crane,</b> the crane must {{be regarded as a}} system. It includes not only the <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> the <b>crane,</b> but also the crane driver and another outer influence factors. Man, machine and environment contribute together the system reliability. But the influence factors are often unknown and fuzzy. Since the insufficiencies of conventional reliability theory, the Fuzzy-Technology is used as a solution. On the basis of an experiment, two methods have been represented in the dissertation, that make the analysis of the mechanical reliability and the human reliability under the fuzzy conditions possible. The methods are suited for the reliability analysis <b>of</b> a <b>crane</b> system or another mechanical systems. (orig.)
