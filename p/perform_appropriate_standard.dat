40|$|Since the White River in {{east central}} Indiana {{is a source}} of water for human use, the quality of its water is an {{important}} concern. Certain heavy metals, when present in high enough concentrations may cause discoloration, foul taste, or may even be a health hazard to man. The particular metals of interest in this investigation are iron, copper, mercury, lead, chromium, nickel, and cobalt. The present study is concerned with the measurement of the concentrations of these metals in the waters and sediment of the White River at Muncie, Indiana. The analyses for the metals listed were <b>performed</b> via <b>appropriate</b> <b>standard</b> methods, involving principally atomic absorption spectroscopy. Four river sites in the Muncie vicinity were sampled daily for a. week, one week per month, for two months, using techniques designed both for convenience and representative character of samples. The end-products of this study are a, comparison of the heavy metal concentrations in the White River with values from other studies and a discussion of the many variables needed to present a true picture of the metallic content of the river water.
