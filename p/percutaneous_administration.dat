40|$|The arthritogenic {{properties}} of adjuvant oil upon <b>percutaneous</b> <b>administration</b> in DA rats was investigated. Groups of rats were administered single or repeated percutaneous applications of Freund's incomplete adjuvant (FIA) or olive oil on shaved skin {{with or without}} prior abrasion of the skin. Control rats were shaved and abrased only. A transient arthritis developed in 8 / 16 animals after repeated applications of FIA on abrased skin. The incidence of arthritis increased to 7 / 8 animals when FIA was repeatedly administered via filter paper on abrased skin {{and covered with a}} bandage. Histological examination of the arthritic joints showed proliferation of the synovial lining layer, infiltration of mononuclear cells and polymorphonuclear cells in the subsynovial tissue. Some bone and cartilage destruction was also seen. Repeated treatment with olive oil on abrased skin induced joint swelling in 3 / 15 animals, which did not, however, correspond to any microscopically observable signs of inflammation. Also, a single application of FIA on abrased skin or repeated applications of FIA without abrasion induced arthritis, although with low penetration, whereas control animals had no clinical signs of joint involvement. These findings demonstrate that <b>percutaneous</b> <b>administration</b> of adjuvant oil can cause arthritis in genetically susceptible animals...|$|E

40|$|Object. Fusion {{procedures}} in the lumbar spine have been performed in the US since 1911. Since that time, the indications and techniques for spinal fusion have evolved. Despite technical advancements, spinal fusion remains a major operation, and fusion nonunion rates of up to 35 % are still reported. In this study, the authors were able to induce intertransverse process fusions in immune-competent New Zealand White rabbits by <b>percutaneous</b> <b>administration</b> of an adenoviral vector containing the bone morphogenetic protein (BMP- 6) gene (Ad-BMP- 6). The results represent an important step forward in finding new methods to increase the success and decrease the morbidity associated with spinal fusion. Methods. Five New Zealand White rabbits were used. Injection of the adenoviral construct was performed at multiple levels (bilaterally) in each animal while using fluoroscopic guidance. Injection consisted of either Ad-BMP- 6 or Ad—ß-galactosidase (ß-gal) (control). Because multiple levels were injected, each animal served as an internal control. The animals underwent postinjection computerized tomography (CT) scanning at 7 and 14 weeks. After undergoing final CT scanning, the animals were killed and the spines were harvested. The fusion sites were analyzed by gross inspection, histopathological methods, and micro—CT studies. Conclusions. The {{results of this study}} show that an anatomically precise fusion can be accomplished by <b>percutaneous</b> <b>administration</b> of gene therapy.

This study aimed to investigate the applicability of BC membranes in topical or transdermal drug delivery systems. To assess its therapeutic feasibility, the permeation through human epidermis of two model drugs (lidocaine hydrochloride and ibuprofen) in BC and other formulation systems was compared in vitro. A uniform distribution of both drugs in the BC membranes was achieved. Diffusion studies with Franz cells showed that the incorporation of lidocaine hydrochloride in BC membranes provided lower permeation rates than those obtained with the conventional formulations. However, the results obtained with the lipophilic drug were quite different, since permeation of ibuprofen in BC was almost three times higher than that of the drug in the gel or in a PEG 400 solution. These results indicate that this technology can be successfully applied to modulate the bioavailability of drugs for <b>percutaneous</b> <b>administration,</b> which could be particularly advantageous in the design of delivery systems that have, simultaneously, the ability to absorb exudates and to adhere to irregular skin surfaces.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine if common commercial cosmetic products containing mineral oil could induce arthritis in the highly susceptible DA (Dark Agouti) rat. Intradermal injection of five out of eight assayed cosmetic products without further additives resulted in arthritis with synovitis. One of the products induced a very aggressive arthritis, which had declined after 5 - 9 weeks.

Results: The protection against the lethality of SM was very good with the flavonoids (quercetin = 4. 7 folds; gossypin = 6. 7 folds and HR flavone = 5. 6 folds), compared to no protection with tocopherol acetate (0. 7 fold). SM (2 LD 50) showed decrease in reduced and oxidised glutathione (GSH and GSSG) levels, {{and an increase in}} malondialdehyde level (MDA). Oxidative stress enzymes like glutathione peroxidase, glutathione reductase and superoxide dismutase were significantly decreased. The total antioxidant status was also significantly decreased. Additionally, there was a significant increase in red blood corpuscles and hemoglobin content. All the flavonoids significantly protected the GSH, GSSG and MDA, and also the hematological variables. Tocopherol acetate failed to offer any protection in those parameters. Gossypin protected glutathione peroxidase, while HR flavone protected both glutathione reductase and glutathione peroxidase significantly.

The modified vaccinia virus Ankara is licensed as a smallpox vaccine in Europe and Canada and currently undergoing clinical development in the United States. MVA is also being investigated as a vector for the delivery of heterologous genes for prophylactic or therapeutic immunization. Since MVA is replication-deficient, MVA and MVA-vectored vaccines are often inoculated through the intramuscular, intradermal or subcutaneous routes. Vaccine inoculation via the intramuscular, intradermal or subcutaneous routes requires the use of injection needles, and an estimated 10 to 20 % {{of the population of the}} United States has needle phobia.

40|$|Steroid sulphatase (STS) inhibitors {{have been}} {{developed}} primarily {{for the treatment of}} hormone-dependent breast cancer, but may also have utility for the treatment of a number of androgen-dependent skin conditions. STS regulates the hydrolysis of steroid sulphates, such as oestrone sulphate (E 1 S) and dehydroepiandrosterone sulphate, (DHEAS). Liberated oestrone (E 1) can be converted to biologically active oestradiol (E 2) while dehydroepiandrosterone (DHEA) can undergo reduction to testosterone or aromatisation to E 1. In this study the ability of the STS inhibitor STX 64 (BN 83495) and its N,N-dimethyl analogue (STX 289) to inhibit liver and skin STS when applied orally or topically to nude mice was examined. Oral administration at 1 and 10 mg/kg resulted in almost complete inhibition of skin and liver STS. When applied topically to the dorsal neck region at 1. 0 and 10 mg/kg not only skin but, unexpectedly, also liver STS was effectively inhibited. An investigation into the metabolism of these two compounds by HepG 2 liver carcinoma cells, with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) analysis, was also undertaken. In the presence of HepG 2 cells a similar degree of desulphamoylation of STX 64 (68 %) or de-N, N-dimethylsulphamoylation of STX 289 (66 %) occurred over a 3 h period. In the absence of cells, however, STX 289 was resistant to de-N, N-dimethylsulphamoylation whereas STX 64 was completely desulphamoylated, demonstrating the more favourable pharmaceutical profile of STX 289 for development for topical application. It is concluded that both STX 64 and STX 289 are not only effective inhibitors of skin STS, but also liver STS when applied topically.

Despite advances in the treatment of heart failure, morbidity and mortality remain unacceptably high. Gene transfer therapy provides a novel strategy for targeting abnormalities in cardiac cells that adversely affect cardiac function. New vectors for gene delivery, mainly adeno-associated viruses (AAVs) that are preferentially taken up by cardiomyocytes, can result in sustained transgene expression. The cardiac isoform of sarco(endo) plasmic reticulum Ca 2 +ATPase (SERCA 2 a) {{plays a major role in}} regulating calcium levels in cardiomyocytes. Abnormal calcium handling by the failing heart caused by a reduction in SERCA 2 a activity adversely affects both systolic and diastolic function. The Calcium Upregulation by <b>Percutaneous</b> <b>Administration</b> of Gene Therapy in Cardiac Disease (CUPID) study was a Phase 2 a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, dose-finding study that was performed in patients with advanced heart failure due to systolic dysfunction. Eligible patients received AAV/SERCA 2 a or placebo by direct antegrade infusion into the coronary circulation. At the end of 12 months, patients receiving high-dose therapy (i. e. 1 × 1013 DNase Resistant Particles) had evidence of favorable changes in several clinically relevant domains compared to patients treated with placebo. There were no safety concerns at any dose of AAV/SERCA 2 a. Patients treated with AAV/SERCA 2 a exhibited a striking reduction in cardiovascular events that persisted through 36 months of follow-up compared to patients who received placebo. Transgene expression was detected in the myocardium of patients receiving AAV/SERCA 2 a gene therapy as long as 31 months after delivery. A second Phase 2 b study, CUPID 2, designed to confirm this favorable effect on heart failure events, is currently underway with the results expected to be presented later in 2015. Additional studies using other vectors and targets are in planning or underway making gene transfer therapy one of the most exciting new approaches under development for treating heart failure...|$|E

The defect alone is sufficient to disable vari-ous Ca 2 +-dependent homeostatic mechanisms that drive fur-ther deterioration of cardiac function and structure after a primary insult, such as myocardial infarction. 1 Translational studies, particularly in human-relevant large animal models, have successfully used recombinant adeno-associated viral (rAAV) vectors for cardiac- targeted delivery of therapeuti-cally formulated synthetic SERCA 2 a DNA that resulted in safe and long-term restoration of cardiac function and rever-sal of structural, electric, and metabolic remodeling in ex-perimental HF. 4 Hence, targeting defective components of the cardiomyocyte Ca 2 + signalosome in HF might bear therapeu-tic benefits beyond sole improvement of cardiac contractile performance (Figure). The Calcium Up-regulation by <b>Percutaneous</b> <b>Administration</b> of Gene Therapy In Cardiac Disease (CUPID) trial is the first translation of this concept into clinically reality. Intracoronary infusion of an rAAV serotype 1 (rAAV 1) carrying the human SERCA 2 a gene under control of a ubiquitous cytomegalovi-rus promoter (AAV 1 -cytomegalovirus-SERCA 2 a) is meant to replenish diminished SERCA 2 a protein levels in hearts of patients with New York Heart Association (NYHA) stage II/ III H...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe stated aims of {{treating}} acute {{deep vein thrombosis}} (DVT) are to prevent a pulmonary embolism, stop the clot from spreading, {{reduce the risk of}} a recurrence; they are less concerned with the late morbidity associated with post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS). In accordance with the French (Afssaps, 2009) and North American (ACCP, 2008) recommendations, anticoagulants (LMWH, heparin, AVK) form the cornerstone for treating DVT. These treatments appear to be far less effective in preventing post-thrombotic syndrome (PTS), associated with venous hypertension, residual occlusion, and with reflux caused by valve incompetence. Given that, the new aim is to optimise the prevention of PTS, the ACCP guidelines, unlike those of Afssaps, “suggest” for selected patients suffering from acute iliofemoral DVT, the use of both classic anticoagulants, and in situ <b>percutaneous</b> <b>administration</b> of thrombolytic drugs (recommendation grade 2 B) and simultaneous correction of any underlying anatomical anomalies using angioplasty and stenting (recommendation 2 C). Contemporary endovascular methods, referred to collectively as “facilitated” thrombolysis, combine low doses of rtPa or Urokinase administered locally, and the removal of the clot using various mechanical, rotating, rheolytic systems, or using ultrasound. The results of non-randomised, heterogeneous studies objectivised a lysis rate of 80 %, a 50 % lower risk of haemorrhage complications compared with systemic thrombolysis (< 4 %), and a clear reduction in treatment time (one-shot methods possible for procedures lasting less than 2 hours). This data ties in with the modern “open vein” concept which underpins the hope of an improvement in the late prognosis of acute DVT, through the removal of a clot, thereby improving permeability and valve integrity; this hypothesis is supported by the results at 24 months of a randomised CaVent objectifying absolute risk reduction of 15 % in the thrombolysis in situ. The current randomised study (ATTRACT trial) comparing the combination of “facilitated thrombolysis” in addition to the usual treatment with the traditional treatment alone for acute iliofemoral DVT, the statistical power of which has been established (600 patients) to authenticate a reduction by a third in the number of PTS (CaVent trial, showing a 15 % reduction rate of 24 months PTS in the thrombolysed group results expected in 2016), might, if the results are positive, lead to a profound change in the paradigms for the treatment of acute iliofemoral DVT...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{advances}} in pharmacological therapy, mortality and morbidity in heart failure remain high. Numerous underlying molecular abnormalities {{exist in the}} failing myocycte, of particular importance are those leading to deranged calcium handling. Gene therapy is an approach that can target these molecular abnormalities directly and a target that has received significant interest is sarcoplasmic (endoplasmic) reticulum calcium ATPase 2 a (SERCA 2 a) which is down regulated in heart failure. There is laboratory and early clinical evidence that SERCA 2 a gene therapy mediated through adeno-associated virus serotype 1 (AAV 1) can improve a number of measures of cardiac function, reduce cardiac alternans and reduce ventricular arrhythmias. T wave alternans (TWA) is a non-invasive marker of arrhythmia risk and is linked to abnormalities of calcium handling. As such, TWA may be a useful tool to assess the effect of AAV 1 -mediated SERCA 2 a gene therapy (AAV 1. SERCA 2 a) on arrhythmia risk in a heart failure population. I conducted {{a number of studies}} in an attempt to refine the TWA technique with the aim of using TWA as an efficacy measure of AAV 1. SERCA 2 a. The calcium upregulation by <b>percutaneous</b> <b>administration</b> of gene therapy in cardiac disease- 2 (CUPID- 2) study was a multi-national, multi-centre, placebo controlled randomised study recruiting 250 patients to assess if intracoronary AAV 1. SERCA 2 a was effective at reducing heart failure hospitalisations in advanced heart failure. As a sub-study of the CUPID- 2 trial I conducted the CUPID- 2 arrhythmia sub-study in patients with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). I investigated whether treatment with AAV 1. SERCA 2 a reduced appropriate ICD therapies and separately I examined if AAV 1. SERCA 2 a reduced TWA in those patients recruited at our site. I found that gene therapy trials are challenging to set up {{as a result of the}} number of legislative, safety and governance approvals that are required. Furthermore, gene therapy studies using AAV 1 are difficult to recruit to as more than half of patients are ineligible due to the presence of neutralising antibodies to the viral vector. I found that delivering AAV 1. SERCA 2 a could be performed safely at our site. AAV 1. SERCA 2 a gene therapy did not reduce ICD therapy or TWA as was expected after the publication of neutral results in the main CUPID- 2 trial. I found that a refinement of the TWA technique of examining multiple leads of the ECG could alter interpretation of TWA and could be tested as an approach to improve the prognostic value of TWA.

40|$|This thesis records {{a series}} of {{experimental}} observations on Bunostomum trigonocephalum. The studies were made under the following broad headings: a) pre-parasitic development b) comparison of routes of infection and studies of the mechanism of infection including exsheathment of the infective larvae c) the pathogenesis and patnogenicity of the parasite for the sheep host. The morphology {{and development of the}} first 1 second and third larval stages was examined, The moult of the first to the second stage was observed and the first stage cuticle appeared to disintegrate rather than be cast as an intact sheath. This moult occurred after about 5 days incubation at 21 °c. Little larval growth occurred after the first moult and the second moult followed comparatively quickly, 80 % of the larvae were in the infective stage after 7 days incubation. 0 0 Survival of infective larvae was compared at temperatures of 0 C, 10 c, 0 0 0 0 20 C, 27 C and 37 C. Larvae survived longest at 10 C. Infective larvae were administered to sheep intravenously, subcutaneously, intraruminally, orally and percutaneously. The largest infections were established after <b>percutaneous</b> <b>administration.</b> Infective larvae applied to the skin of sheep exsheathed rapidly and penetrated the keratinised layers of the skin. They were also found to exsheath on and penetrate into the skin of calves, gtli. nea pigs and rabbits. There was evidence that larvae migrated to the lungs in the guinea pigs and patent infections were established in some calves, During exsheathment the anterior portion of the sheath appeared to disintegrate allowing the larvae to emerge, This is unlike the processes which have been described in other strongylate nematodes. A variable proportion of the infective larvae were found to exsheath "spontaneously" in faecal cultures, Attempts were made to find what stimulates the infective larvae to exsheath, The results were inconclusive. The highest rate of exsheathment was obtained by·exposing larvae to buffer of pH 2. The addition of co 2 enhanced the exsheathment rate but only at pH 2. Even so, the results were variable and difficult to reconcile with conditions on the skin surface. After infection of sheep the prepatent period was found to range from 54 to 60 days. The 24 hour egg-output per female worm was estimated in 5 infected sheep and was found to range from 2579 to 10480 eggs. Most of the Bunostomum were found in the intestine between 5 and 35 feet posterior to the gastric pylorus. Numbers of Bunostomum in excess of 2 - 300 caused a significant and progressive decline in haemoglobin, packed cell volume and total serum protein levels over observation periods of up to 16 weeks after infection, The serum protein decline was primarily due to a fall in albumin concentration. The animals so affected also showed evidence of anorexia, retarded growth rate and loss of weight, Diarrhoea occurred sporadically...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} trials {{described in this}} article were presented at the Late Breaking Trials and the Clinical Science: Clinical Reports sessions of the American Heart Association Congress held in November 2010 in Chicago. The sessions and topics chosen for this article reflect the scope of interest of Cardiovascular Drugs and Therapy. The presentations should be considered preliminary, as further analyses may be done, which could alter the final publication of the results of these studies. PROTECT (ProBNP Outpatient Tailored Chronic Heart Failure Therapy) was designed to test the hypothesis that adjustment of intensity of chronic heart failure (HF) therapy on the basis of NT-proBNP plasma level monitoring would improve outcomes. The results provided some support of this concept, but needs further evaluation in larger, blinded trials. REVEAL (Reduction of Infarct Expansion and Ventricular Remodeling with erythropoietin after large myocardial infarctions) evaluated in the clinical setting of ischemia-reperfusion following STEMI that erythropoietin could salvage ischemic myocardium. The results did not show a reduction in infarct size, but, in contrast, an increase in adverse event rates in the erythropoietin group. GRAVITAS (Gauging Responsiveness with a VerifyNow assay-Impact on Thrombosis and Safety trial) investigated the effect of a standard vs. high maintenance clopidogrel dose in patients with stable myocardial ischemia or NSTEMI and drug–eluting stent insertion. Patients with high PRU values as determined by VerfyNow assay were randomized to 75  mg or 150  mg clopidogrel daily. The study did not show a significant difference in primary event rate between both groups. The Cholesterol Treatment Trialists’ Collaboration Studies group evaluated the concept proposed in the JUPITER study that HDL levels on statin treatment may not provide useful prognostic information. The CTTC in a large sample size of statin-treated patients observed, on the contrary, a significantly increased risk of CV events, even in patients with low LDL cholesterol levels. DEFINE (Determining the Efficacy and Tolerability of CETP inhibition with Anacetrapib) evaluated possible safety aspects with the CETP inhibitor anacetrapib (increase in blood pressure). The study did not show adverse safety aspects, but significantly reduced LDL cholesterol and increased HDL cholesterol levels. ASSERT, a phase 2 dose–ranging study, investigated whether RVX- 208 would increase Apo-A 1 production. Apo-A 1 may induce cholesterol efflux from macrophages and facilitate atherosclerosis regression. The study did not meet its primary endpoint, but significant prominent effects on lipids were found. ASCEND-HF was a large trial of nesiritide in > 7000 patients with acute heart failure. The study did not show convincing symptom benefit, {{but on the other hand}} did not show harmful effects of nesiritide. EMPHASIS-HF evaluated the long term effects of eplerenone in patients with mild (NYHA class II) heart failure and systolic dysfunction. The study was prematurely ended because of highly significant beneficial effects. CUPID (Calcium Up-regulation by <b>Percutaneous</b> <b>administration</b> of gene therapy In cardiac Disease) is the first human study with gene transfer of SERCA 2 a (AVV 1 /SERCA 2 a: Mydicar). In a small placebo-controlled dose-ranging study in advanced heart failure patients a multiple endpoint analysis provided positive effects of the highest dose on symptomatic, functional and structural efficacy endpoints without adverse effects...|$|E
40|$|Thoracic duct (TD) {{ligation}} {{has long}} been the treatment of choice for canine idiopathic chylothorax. Clear identification of all the TD branches at the surgical site is critical to facilitate complete ligation, and this can be difficult due to the highly variable nature of the TD system in number, location and patency of TD branches. Failure to ligate all of the TD branches may result in persistent flow of chyle into the pleural cavity through any missed ducts, and this is the single most common cause of failure with TD ligation. Performing direct positive contrast lymphography with a water soluble contrast medium, administered through a surgically implanted mesenteric lymphatic vessel catheter has been the conventional method used to identify TD branches. This procedure involves invasive surgery to both implant and remove the mesenteric lymphatic catheter, which increases patient risk and discomfort, as well as the diagnostic time and cost. Ultrasound (US) guided <b>percutaneous</b> <b>administration</b> of contrast medium into either a popliteal or mesenteric lymph node (LN) have been proposed as alternatives to mesenteric lymphatic vessel catheterisation, however their comparability with the conventional approach has not been assessed. Computed tomographic (CT) lymphography of the caudal canine TD was performed in seven beagles with contrast medium administered through a mesenteric lymphatic catheter, and by US guided percutaneous injection into a popliteal LN. Images of the TD system were collected using both helical and sequential CT modalities for each contrast medium administration technique. It was found that percutaneous popliteal lymphography had a total diagnostic procedure time just 46 % of that found with mesenteric lymphatic vessel administration, and resulted in a time saving of 52 minutes. It also incurred only 29 % of the total costs, and patients were assessed to have significantly less discomfort compared to mesenteric lymphatic vessel lymphography. There {{was no significant difference in}} the number of TD branches identified by the two contrast medium administration techniques (P = 0. 256). However administration of contrast medium into a mesenteric lymphatic vessel did result in the largest TD branch having a significantly greater widest diameter (P < 0. 001), cross-sectional area (P < 0. 001) and mean Hounsfield unit (HU) value (P < 0. 001) than popliteal administration. The significant difference in TD size and contrast medium concentration may help to explain the trend for popliteal administration of contrast medium to detect slightly fewer TD branches (CR = 0. 830), however this study could not confirm this trend nor its possible causes. There was no significant difference in the number of TD branches identified by the two CT modalities (P = 0. 417). However helical CT did result in the largest TD branch having a significantly greater widest diameter (P < 0. 001), cross-sectional area (P < 0. 001) and higher mean HU value (P < 0. 001). It should be noted however that in this study sequential CT was consistently performed after the helical CT was completed, which could explain the differences seen between the two CT modalities in TD branch size and contrast medium concentration. Despite helical CT having the apparent advantage of a larger TD branch which contained a higher concentration of contrast medium, it was actually found that there was a trend for helical CT to detect slightly fewer TD branches (CR = 0. 876). This is possibly due to the positive pressure breath hold that was used to minimise thoracic respiratory movement for the helical CT; while the sequential CT was performed during normal respiration and was therefore not subject to abnormally elevated intrapleural pressure. This study could not confirm the slight superiority of sequential CT in detecting TD branches nor the possible reasons for this apparent difference.
