40|$|This edited {{volume is}} a result of the {{international}} conference, “European Perspectives in Transformative Education,” held in Wrocław, on June 19 th–June 20 th. The conference and this publication are an integral part of the project European Doctorate in Teacher Education (EDiTE), which has spanned over the course of two projects: In the first preparatory stage, EDiTE was funded through the Lifelong Learning Programme of the European Commission, while the current project is supported by the European Union’s Horizon 2020 research and innovation programme, Marie-Skłodowska-Curie grant agreement number 676452. In the current project, researchers from eleven countries (Czech Republic, Ecuador, Germany, Greece, Hungary, Nepal, Poland, Serbia, Syria, Buthan and United States of America) are working in the partner universities (University of Innsbruck, University of Lower Silesia, University of Lisbon, Masaryk University and Eötvös Loránd University) where they cooperate closely with supervisors and pursue individual research projects in the framework of the EDiTE joint research programme. The theme of the EDiTE program, Transformative Teacher Learning for Better Student Learning within an Emerging European Context, draws on the deep interdependence of educational research and practice. Over the course of the project, the EDiTE community envisions growing into a European network for innovation in teacher education, accessible to academics, practitioners and policy makers. A key principle of the projects is its collaborative character. In addition to junior and senior academic researchers located at the partner universities, strong institutional partnerships are built with the field of practice – with schools, research and development institutes, as well as government agencies – seen as key partners in promoting quality and relevance in teacher education and research. Collaborations within the EDiTE program take place on multiple levels – within host institutions (between researchers, supervisors and partners), and trans-institutionally with other teams at partner universities. This cooperation is made possible by a number of structural and mobility solutions that constitute essential elements of the project design. This includes joint meetings during summer schools, virtual seminars and conferences; <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>secondment</b> for doctoral researchers at partner universities; virtual co-operation and networking between supervisors, researchers and partner institutions across the consortium and a knowledge portal...|$|R

To achieve the objectives of this paper, it has been divided into five parts. The first part is the theoretical framework of the issue in which we address the importance <b>of</b> <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> personnel {{in the public sector}} in Saudi Arabia. Then I will review the concept and importance <b>of</b> the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> personnel in general. In the second part we will review several international experiences, while in the third part, we will focus on the current reality <b>of</b> the <b>secondment</b> regulations applied in Saudi Arabia. In the fourth part, we will analyze the current situation by identifying strengths and weaknesses in the <b>secondment</b> regulation <b>of</b> the personnel in Saudi Arabia. Finally, the study will propose a policy to activate, coordinate and encourage the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> personnel in Saudi Arabia. It is worth mentioning that the paper concluded that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia devoted a regulation for the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> personnel both within and outside Saudi Arabia, through the public sector personnel may be seconded to some government, regional or international bodies. However, within the Kingdom does not allowed to second the public sector personnel except for some government agencies that have special private system and this deprives several government agencies {{to take advantage of the}} unique experiences in some government agencies. In addition, I will suggest new regulations that will allow private sector to second their employees to government agencies. In conclusion there is a need to develop the secondment regulation to allow the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> the government agencies personnel among them, regardless of being a ministry or a public institution, as there is an urgent need to add regulatory articles for the secondment to second Saudi employees working in the private sector to various government agencies through the <b>secondment</b> <b>of</b> their services for specific periods such as four years as an example along with providing them with financial incentives to encourage their services secondment...|$|R

40|$|Background - Experiential {{approaches}} to skills development using secondment models are shown to benefit healthcare organisations more generally, but {{little is known}} about the potential of this approach to develop capacity for knowledge translation (KT). Aim - To evaluate the success of KT capacity development secondments from the perspective of multiple stakeholders. Methods - A pluralistic evaluation design was used. Data were collected during 2011 - 12 using focus group and individual interviews with 14 clinical and academic secondees, and five managers from host and seconding organisations to gain insight into participants’ perceptions of the success <b>of</b> <b>secondments</b> and the criteria by which they judged success. Six After Action Reviews were undertaken with KT project teams to explore participants’ perceptions of the contribution secondees made to KT projects. Semi-structured interviews were undertaken with three healthcare managers on completion of projects to explore the impact <b>of</b> <b>secondments</b> on the organisation, staff and patients. Qualitative content analysis was used to identify criteria for success. The criteria provided a framework through which the overall success <b>of</b> <b>secondments</b> could be judged. Results - Six criteria for judging the success <b>of</b> the <b>secondments</b> at individual, team and organisation level were identified: KT skills development, effective workload management, team working, achieving KT objectives, enhanced care delivery, enhanced education delivery. Benefits to the individual, KT team, seconding and host organisations were identified. Implications for practice - Hosting teams should provide mentorship support to secondees, and be flexible to accommodate secondees’ needs as team members. On-going support of managers from seconding organisations is needed to maximise the benefits to individual secondees and the organisation. Conclusions - Experiential {{approaches to}} KT capacity development using secondments can benefit individual secondees, project teams, seconding and host organisations. </p...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Science, University of Tasmania, is entitled "Applied Research on Organometallics and Organic Materials". It represents work undertaken {{in the employment of}} the Commonwealth of Australia during the period 1951 - 78. The thesis resulted from a suggestion that some early work carried out by the author on compounds based on phosphorus, silicon and tin could still be of interest to scientists associated with organometallic chemistry. The approval for the unlimited public release of some of this work has enabled it now to be included. Prior to joining Defence Standards Laboratories, Department of Supply (now Materials Research Laboratories, Department of Defence) early in 1951, studies for the Degrees of Bachelor of Science and Bachelor of Science with Honours were undertaken at the University of Tasmania. A short period of post graduate research at the University followed the completion of the academic requirements for an Honours Degree. At the Ministry of Supply, Britain,during 1951 - 53,work was undertaken on special organometallic compounds. The synthesis of a new series of ether-containing organophosphorus compounds was initiated in collaboration with the late A. H. FORD-MOORE, a specialist in organophosphorus chemistry. This was followed, at my suggestion, by a detailed study of the structure-toxicity relationships of some silicon analogues of the organophosphorus compounds. In the early 1950 's, the chemistry of organosilicon compounds was at an early stage of development and this area of research was relatively unexplored. The interest generated in phosphorus and silicon chemistry in Britain stimulated further research on organometallics (and related materials) following my return to Australia. One of these activities was the synthesis of a new series of tetraorthoesters of titanium as these materials were of interest as vehicles for heat-resistant paints. This work was completed in 1957. At about the same period, the author became involved with scientific studies associated with several atomic tests conducted at Maralinga, South Australia, and code named Operation BUFFALO. A further area of research on organometallics was initiated in - 1957 and this work, on the chemistry and applications of organotin compounds, has continued for twenty years. During this period, other scientists at MRL have also been associated with some of the research activities. In the mid- 1960 's, during a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>secondment</b> to the US Army, work was initiated on the development of high performance, non-black, ethylene-propylene diene elastomers, using new synthetic materials that had been introduced in the USA, during 1963 - 64. On return to Australia, applied research on organotin compounds was continued as well as work {{on a wide range of}} organic materials, mainly rubbers and plastics. These types of activities are still in progress. The original aim of our research activities on organometallics was to find new applications for these interesting and versatile chemicals. In the role of additives they have shown considerable promise in the modification of the properties of a wide range of organic materials such as: rubbers; plastics; adhesives; sealants; coatings; and fibres. In this thesis details are given of our efforts to modify organic materials by the addition of organometallic compounds. To record my continuing interest in applied research, other items associated with organic analyses and organic materials are included. During the period 1951 - 74, the research was undertaken at Defence Standards Laboratories (DSL), first in Department of Supply and then in Department of Manufacturing Industry. On 19 September 1974, DSL'sincreasing role in scientific studies of defence materials was recognised by a change of name to Materials Research Laboratories (MRL) and the transfer of MEL from Department of Manufacturing Industry to Department of Defence. Summary details of research activities during the period 1951 - 78, are given at Appendix 1. The work reported in this thesis was initiated by the author and undertaken, either alone or, with the collaboration of other scientific staff. Where appropriate, results have been published in the open scientific literature or in the form of Government reports, with collaboration being recognised by co-authorship. Details of co-authors, including their past and present designations and present positions, are given at Appendix 2. Although the research described was conducted over a number of years, it has all been concerned with the understanding of unexpected chemical phenomena and the development of new and improved organic materials of primary interest to the Defence Force of Australia as well as to the scientific community in general. All the work reported in this thesis is original and is now unclassified. Some previously unpublished work is also included. The nature of this work is indicated in the text, together with details of official references to documents available from Materials Research Laboratories. To confirm the initiation of, and participation in, the reported research activities, copies of some specific documentation relating to the work presented are also included. It is a pleasure to record that the late Arthur FORD-M 00 RE, Chemical Defence Establishment, Ministry of Defence, Porton, Britain, was responsible for the stimulation of my interest in defence science in general, and organometallic chemistry in particular. The example of his aptitude towards the solving of chemical problems, his manipulative skill in the laboratory and his general philosophy to research, provided the stimulus that was necessary to maintain a long-term continuing interest in organometallics and organic materials of defence Interest.

Although effects are milder than heroin, potential for habit forming use, misuse and addiction remains of concern, with physical dependence occurring with regular use over a short <b>period</b> <b>of</b> time. Within trajectories of codeine use, misuse and dependence, a variety of distinct sub groups exist in the form of pain patients, elderly, youth, parents, recreational, problematic and opiate dependent drug users, and each with their own motives, patterns and outcomes for use. Increases in addiction treatment uptakes and reporting of adverse health consequences relating to additives in combination analgesics containing codeine and ibuprofen/paracetamol are observed globally.
