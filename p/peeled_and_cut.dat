The labor force in this region’s canneries included White, Portuguese (20%), Italian (50%) and Mexican workers. Cannery owners preferred women workers believing they were more adept at the preparation of the fruits and vegetables for canning. This included the ability to quickly sort, <b>peel</b> <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> the produce. These demographics determined the unionization of cannery workers. Additionally, the prevalence of women workers formed multiple demands during the strike.|$|R

40|$|Optimization of {{plantain}} {{drying process}} parameters to obtained {{high quality product}} is very vital as improper drying conditions can affect {{the composition of the}} plantain flour and thereby increases the risk of running into deterioration of the nutrient contents of the product and loss. Matured unripe plantains were processed by washing, <b>peeling</b> <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> into required size. The samples obtained were analysed in triplicate using different drying oven temperatures (60, 70 and 80 oC) and time (187, 242, and 311 minutes) at pulp size of 3 mm by employing Design of experiment (DOE). Statistical analysis and response surface methodology based on the D-Optimal were carried out. The significant factors on the experimental design response were identified from the analysis of variance. The optimum conditions for the processing of unripe plantain into dry product were obtained by using temperature of 80 oC, time of 187 minutes and pulp size of 3 mm which resulted in final carbohydrate content of 87. 4 %. From these results obtained, the use of response surface methodology in optimizing plantain drying process can be recommended...|$|R

Changes in package atmosphere composition, weight loss, color, texture, pH, soluble solids, sensory attributes, were evaluated after cutting and at three subsequent stages of storage (the 3 day, 6 d, 9 d, and the 12 day). Color parameters L and b significantly decreased {{over time in}} all packaging conditions and L variation was directly attributed to the translucency phenomenon in the fruit flesh. The pineapple and orange parameters highlighted the best visual score during the storage period, the lowest values of the browning index and the highest scores of all sensory descriptors at each sampling date.

The assay was carried out during 2013 at the Fruits and Vegetables Drying Laboratory from the National Institute of Agricultural Technology (INTA) Rama Caída Agricultural Experimental Station, Argentina. Franco variety tomatoes were used; these were <b>peeled</b> <b>and</b> <b>cut,</b> then 8 groups of 0, 5 kg each were formed in order to attain 4 treatments with two repetitions. The tomatoes were covered with sucrose (0, 5 kg) mixed with four doses of sodium metabisulfite (A: 0 %; B: 0, 2 %; C: 0, 5 %; D: 0, 8 %) and were left resting 24 hours.

40|$|Summary The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the potential of turnip extract and xanthan gum in the conservation of minimally processed apples. The apples were washed, sanitized with sodium hypochlorite (200 ppm) for 15 minutes, <b>peeled,</b> <b>and</b> <b>cut</b> into eight pieces prior to being subjected to one of the following treatments in aqueous solution: A – water (control); B – turnip extract; C – turnip extract and CaCl 2; D – xanthan gum, CaCl 2 and glycerol; E – turnip extract, xanthan gum, CaCl 2, and glycerol. Subsequently, the freshly cut apples were dried under ventilation on nylon screens to ensure drying of the coatings, and then packed in polystyrene trays, covered with polyvinylchloride films and stored at 4 ± 1 ° C for 13 days. The following parameters were evaluated: mass loss, firmness, colouration, pH value, soluble solids, and peroxidase/polyphenoloxidase activities. The edible coatings were found to be ineffective with respect to controlling mass loss, but the minimally processed apples coated with turnip extract maintained their initial levels of colouration, firmness and pH value. A considerable increase in peroxidase activity was registered for apples treated with turnip extract, suggesting that this effect may also be responsible for the reduction in browning. No advantage could be observed for the simultaneous presence of turnip extract and xanthan gum or calcium chloride. The turnip extract may represent an interesting alternative for applications to minimally processed apples, especially as it is a natural product, easily obtained, cost effective and contributes to the nutritional quality (e. g. as a source of calcium ions) ...|$|E

A completely randomized design was used in a 4 × 6 factorial consisting of the treatment (control, coating, antioxidant, or coating and antioxidant) and the storage period (0, 3 6, 9, 12 or 15 days), with three replicates in each group. The pH, blackened area and peroxidase and polyphenol oxidase activities of the cassava was reduced in treatments containing antioxidants and the scores of visual analysis and phenolic content were higher. Therefore, treatment with antioxidants was effective for reducing browning in minimally - processed cassava, retaining the quality of cassava pieces stored for 15 days at 5 ± 2 °C.
