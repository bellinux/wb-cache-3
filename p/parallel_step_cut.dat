The lubricant {{in the film}} region {{and also in the}} porous is modeled as Eringen’s micropolar fluid. A non-Newtonian modified Reynolds equation is derived for porous <b>parallel</b> <b>stepped</b> plates and applied to obtain solution of squeeze film characteristics. Comparing with the classical Newtonian lubricant case, the influence non-Newtonian micropolar fluids are found to enhance the load carrying capacity and lengthen the approaching the time of porous <b>parallel</b> <b>stepped</b> plates.

They may resemble the square-shaped Princess cut in passing, but a carré's lack of fire and simpler facets are distinctive. They {{may or may not}} have a culet. In Western jewelry dating to before the advent of brilliant-type cuts, very shallow step-cut stones were used as lustrous covers for miniature paintings: these are known in the antique trade as portrait stones. Characteristic of Indian jewelry are lasque diamonds, which may be the earliest form of <b>step</b> <b>cut.</b> They are flat stones with large tables and asymmetric outlines.|$|R

40|$|Abstract In {{this paper}} we propose novel {{algorithms}} for reconfiguring modular robots that are composed of n atoms. Each atom has {{the shape of a}} unit cube and can expand/contract each face by half a unit, as well as attach to or detach from faces of neighboring atoms. For universal reconfiguration, atoms must be arranged in 2 × 2 × 2 modules. We respect certain physical constraints: each atom reaches at most unit velocity and (via expansion) can displace at most one other atom. We require that one of the atoms can store a map of the target configuration. Our al-gorithms involve a total of O(n 2) such atom operations, which are performed in O(n) <b>parallel</b> <b>steps.</b> This improves on previous reconfiguration algorithms, which either use O(n 2) <b>parallel</b> <b>steps</b> [8, 10, 4] or do not respect the constraints mentioned above [1].

Antique jewelry of the period features step-cut stones prominently, {{and there is a}} market in producing new step-cut stones to repair antique jewelry or to reproduce it.

40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we propose a novel {{algorithm}} that, given a source robot S and a target robot T, reconfigures S into T. Both S and T are robots composed of n atoms arranged in 2 × 2 × 2 metamodules.

We show that the algorithm can also be implemented in a synchronous, distributed fashion. ...|$|R
