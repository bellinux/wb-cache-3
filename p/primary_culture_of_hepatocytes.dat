40|$|Background In farm animals, {{there is}} no {{suitable}} cell line available to understand liver-specific functions. This has limited our understanding of liver function and metabolism in farm animals. Cultur-ing and maintenance of functionally active hepatocytes is difficult, since they survive no more than few days. Establishing <b>primary</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> can help in studying cellu-lar metabolism, drug toxicity, hepatocyte specific gene function and regulation. Here we pro-vide a simple in vitromethod for isolation and short-term culture of functionally active buffalo hepatocytes. Results Buffalo hepatocytes were isolated from caudate lobes by using manual enzymatic perfusion and mechanical disruption of liver tissue. Hepatocyte yield was (5. 3 ± 0. 66) × 107 cells per gram of liver tissue with a viability of 82. 3 ± 3. 5 %. Freshly isolated hepatocytes were spheri-cal with well contrasted border. After 24 hours of seeding onto fibroblast feeder layer and dif-ferent extracellular matrices like dry collagen, matrigel and sandwich collagen coate...|$|E
40|$|Rat hepatocytes were cultured for 72 h with {{or without}} the {{addition}} of 0. 5 rriM clofibric acid. The activities of individual enzymes of the peroxisomal ^-oxidation pathway (acyl-CoA oxidase, enoyl-CoA hydratase- 3 -hydroxyacyl-CoA dehydro-genase bifunctional protein, and 3 -ketoacyl-CoA thiolase) decreased in the control culture, but markedly increased synchronously in the clofibric acid-treated culture. The levels of mRNAs coding for these enzymes and the rates of synthesis of the enzymes were also elevated in the clofibric acid-treated culture, although no pro-portional relationship was observed between the time-dependent changes of these parameters. The increase in mRNAs was much higher than the increase in the rate of synthesis of the enzymes. The activity of catalase, its mRNA level and the rate of its synthesis were slightly affected. The effects of clofibric acid on the peroxi-somal / 3 -oxidation enzymes and catalase in primary cultured hepatocytes were very similar to those observed in vivo. These results, therefore, suggest that <b>primary</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> should provide a useful means for investigating the mech-anism of induction of peroxisomal enzymes and the mechanism of action of peroxi...|$|E

Title of Doctoral Thesis: Sesquiterpenes {{in cancer}} therapy. Chemotherapy is an {{important}} part of treatment of cancer. Currently, the use of several anticancer drugs in combination seem to be more advantageous. This combination therapy prevents drug resistance development and make it possible to lower the doses of single drugs, which prevents the side effects in non-cancerous tissues. Large pool of potential drugs for combination therapy can be found among natural compounds, for example among sesquiterpenes. Our project was designed to evaluate the effect of Myrica rubra essential oil (MEO) and selected sesquiterpenes in combination cancer therapy. We focused on the potential ability of MEO and sesquiterpenes to increase the antiproliferative efficacy of classical cytostatics (doxorubicin, oxaliplatin, 5 -fluorouracil). In addition, we also studied the possible interaction of sesquiterpenes with other drugs in combination therapy, which could be caused by sesquiterpene-mediated modulation of drug-metabolizing enzymes. For these purposes, a panel of various cell lines (both cancerous and non-cancerous) and <b>primary</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> [...] ...|$|E

40|$|Defective acute {{regulation}} of hepatic glycogen synthase by glucose and insulin, caused by severe insulin deficiency, can be corrected in adult rat hepatocytes in <b>primary</b> <b>culture</b> by inclusion <b>of</b> insulin, triiodothyronine, and cortisol in a chemically defined serum-free culture medium over a 3 -day period (Miller, T. B., Jr., Garnache, A. K., Cruz, J., McPherson, R. K., and Wolleben, C. (1986) J. Biol. Chem. 261, 785 - 790). Using <b>primary</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> isolated from normal and diabetic rats {{in the same}} serum-free chemically defined medium, the present study addresses the effects of cycloheximide and actinomycin D on the chronic actions of insulin, triiodothyronine, and cortisol to facilitate the direct effects of glucose on the short-term activation of glycogen synthase. The short-term presence (1 h) of the protein synthesis blockers {{had no effect on}} acute activation of glycogen synthase by glucose in <b>primary</b> hepatocyte <b>cultures</b> from normal rats. Normal cells maintained in the presence of cycloheximide or actinomycin D for 2 and 3 days exhibited unimpaired responsiveness to glucose activation of synthase. The protein synthesis inhibitors were effective at blocking the restoration of glucose activation of synthase in diabetic cells in media which restored the activation in their absence. Restoration of glycogen synthase phosphatase activity by insulin, triiodothyronine, and cortisol in <b>primary</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> diabetic <b>hepatocytes</b> was also blocked by cycloheximide or actinomycin D.

40|$|Liver {{carnitine}} palmitoyltransferase I (L-CPT I) catalyses {{the transfer}} of long-chain fatty acid (LCFA) for translocation across the mitochondrial membrane. Expression of the L-CPT I gene is induced by LCFAs {{as well as by}} lipid-lowering compounds such as clofibrate. Previous studies have suggested that the peroxisome-proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) is a common mediator of the transcriptional effects of LCFA and clofibrate. We found that free LCFAs rather than acyl-CoA esters are the signal metabolites responsible for the stimulation of L-CPT I gene expression. Using <b>primary</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> we found that LCFAs failed to stimulate L-CPT I gene expression both in wild-type and PPARalpha-null mice. These results suggest that the PPARalpha-knockout mouse does not represent a suitable model for the regulation of L-CPT I gene expression by LCFAs in the liver. Finally, we determined that clofibrate stimulates L-CPT I through a classical direct repeat 1 (DR 1) motif in the promoter of the L-CPT I gene while LCFAs induce L-CPT I via elements in the first intron of the gene. Our results demonstrate that LCFAs can regulate gene expression through PPARalpha-independent pathways and suggest that the regulation of gene expression by dietary lipids is more complex than previously proposed...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} succeeded in {{cultivating}} normal adult rat hepatocytes {{for at least}} 85 days without losing their replicative potential and differentiation capacity. Small pieces of hepatocyte aggregates (clusters) were prepared from the <b>primary</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> and used as starting material for the growth experiment. Some of the hepatocytes started to proliferate at 3 days when the clusters were cultured in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium containing 10 % fetal bovine serum, 10 ng/ml epidermal growth factor, 10 mmol/L nicotinamide, 0. 2 mmol/L L-ascorbic acid 2 -phosphate, and 1 % dimethylsulfoxide. Clusters continued to grow and formed colonies. All the cells covering colonies expressed normal hepatocyte-specific proteins. The number of albumin-expressing cells in the most replicative colonies increased sixfold during 32 days. Most of the cells were mononucleate and small in size {{and some of them}} expressed immature hepatocyte markers such as alpha-fetoprotein. Electron microscopy of cells in colonies revealed the presence of peroxisomes in the cytoplasm and desmosomes, tight junctions, and bile canaliculus-like structures between the cells.

40|$|Background: Dedifferentiation {{and loss}} of {{hepatocyte}} polarity during <b>primary</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> are major drawbacks for metabolic analyses. As a prominent profibrotic cytokine and potent inducer of epithelial mesenchymal transition (EMT), TGF-β contributes to these processes in liver epithelial cells. Yet, a distinction between culture dependent and TGF-β driven hepatocyte dedifferentiation has not been shown to date. Results: Here, we show that in both settings, mesenchymal markers are induced. However, upregulation of Snai 1 and downregulation of E-Cadherin are restricted to TGF-β effects, neglecting a full EMT of culture dependent hepatocyte dedifferentiation. Mechanistically, the latter is mediated via FAK/Src/ERK/AKT pathways leading to the induction of the oncogene caveolin- 1 (Cav 1). Cav 1 was recently proposed as a new EMT marker, but our results demonstrate Cav 1 is not up-regulated in TGF-β mediated hepatocyte EMT, thus limiting validity of its use for this purpose. Importantly, marking differences on Cav 1 expression exist in HCC cell lines. Whereas well differentiated HCC cell lines exhibit low and inducible Cav 1 protein levels- by TGF-β in a FAK/Src dependent manner, poorly differentiated cell lines display high Cav 1 expression levels which are not further modulated by TGF-β.

40|$|Previously, we have {{determined}} that human annexin V (hAV), a Ca 2 +-dependent phospholipid-binding protein, and not rat AV, binds specifically to small hepatitis B surface antigen (SHBsAg), and that transfection of a rat hepatoma cell line with a construct containing the hAV gene led to hAV expression and conferred susceptibility to hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection. In this work, we have examined the effect of administration of hAV on in vitro binding of SHBsAg to human and to rat hepatocytes and on in vitro HBV infection. The results showed that hAV could bind to human {{as well as to}} rat <b>hepatocytes.</b> Because <b>of</b> this property, excess hAV was unable to prevent HBV infection in <b>primary</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> human <b>hepatocytes.</b> On the other hand, it enabled rat hepatocytes to specifically bind SHBsAg and conferred susceptibility to HBV infection.

40|$|Objectives The study`s aims were to {{evaluate}} the antimycobacterial activity of 13 synthetic neolignan analogues and to perform structure activity relationship analysis (SAR). The cytotoxicity of the compound 2 -phenoxy- 1 -phenylethanone (LS- 2, 1) in mammalian cells, such as the acute toxicity in mice, was also evaluated. Methods The extra and intracellular antimycobacterial activity was evaluated on Mycobacterium tuberculosis H 37 Rv. Cytotoxicity studies were performed using V 79 cells, J 774 macrophages and rat hepatocytes. Additionally, the in-vivo acute toxicity was tested in mice. The SAR analysis was performed by Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Key findings Among the 13 analogues tested, LS- 2 (1) was the most effective, showing promising antimycobacterial activity and very low cytotoxicity in V 79 cells and in J 774 macrophages, while no toxicity was observed in rat hepatocytes. The selectivity index (SI) of LS- 2 (1) was 91 and the calculated LD 50 was 1870 mg/kg, highlighting the very low toxicity in mice. SAR analysis showed that the highest electrophilicity and the lowest molar volume are physical-chemical characteristics important for the antimycobacterial activity of the LS- 2 (1). Conclusions LS- 2 (1) showed promising antimycobacterial activity and very weak cytotoxicity in cell culture, {{as well as an}} absence of toxicity in <b>primary</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes.</b> In the acute toxicity study there was an indication of absence of toxicity on murine models, in vivo.

Cytochromes P 450 (P 450 s) have recently been found in rat WAT and shown to be inducible through mechanisms similar to those in the liver. The aim of our study was to describe the cytochrome P 450 pattern and their induction mechanisms in human WAT. Explants of subcutaneous and visceral WAT and primary culture of subcutaneous adipocytes were used as WAT models, and liver biopsies and <b>primary</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> were used as liver models to characterize P 450 expression in both tissues. The WAT and liver models were then treated with typical P 450 inducers (rifampicin, phenobarbital, and 2, 3, 7, 8 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin) and lipophilic pollutants (lindane, prochloraz, and chlorpyrifos), and the effects on P 450 expression were studied. P 450 expression was considerably lower in WAT than in the liver, except for CYP 1 B 1 and CYP 2 U 1, which were the most highly expressed adipose P 450 s in all individuals. 2, 3, 7, 8 -Tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin and prochloraz induced CYP 1 A 1 and CYP 1 B 1 expression in both tissues. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor was also present in WAT. In contrast, neither phenobarbital nor rifampicin treatment induced CYP 2 or CYP 3 mRNA in WAT, and constitutive androstane receptor and pregnane X receptor were almost undetectable.

40|$|Cellular {{responses}} to adenosine {{depend on the}} distribution of the two adenosine receptor subclasses. In <b>primary</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> rat <b>hepatocytes,</b> adenosine receptors were coupled to adenylate cyclase via A 1 and A 2 receptors which inhibit and stimulate cyclic AMP production respectively. R-(-) -N 6 -(2 -phenylisopropyl) -adenosine (R-PIA), the adenosine A 1 receptor-selective agonist, inhibited glucagon-stimulated cyclic AMP production with an IC 50 of 19 nM. This inhibition was blocked by the A 1 -specific antagonist 8 -cyclopentyl- 1, 3 -dimethylxanthine (CPDX). 5 '-N- Ethylcarboxamidoadenosine (NECA), an agonist which stimulates A 2 receptors, increased cyclic AMP production with an EC 50 of 0. 6 microM. Treatment <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> rat <b>hepatocytes</b> with 100 mM ethanol for 48 h decreases the quantity and function of the inhibitory guanine-nucleotide regulatory protein (G(i)), resulting in a sensitization of receptor-stimulated cyclic AMP production [Nagy and deSilva (1992) Biochem. J. 286, 681 - 686]. When cells were cultured with 2 units/ml adenosine deaminase, to degrade extracellular adenosine, ethanol-induced increases in cyclic AMP production were completely prevented. Moreover, the specific A 1 -receptor antagonist, CPDX, also blocked the chronic effects of ethanol on receptor-stimulated cyclic AMP production. Treatment with adenosine deaminase or CPDX also prevented the decrease in quantity of the alpha subunit protein of G(i) observed in hepatocytes after chronic treatment with ethanol. Taken together, these results suggest that activation of adenosine A 1 receptors on <b>primary</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> is involved in the development of chronic ethanol-induced sensitization of receptor-stimulated cyclic AMP production...|$|R

40|$|The mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) ERK 1 and ERK 2 {{have been}} implicated in various {{physiological}} events, and specific targeting of these MAPKs could affect cell proliferation in many cell types. First, to evaluate the potential specific roles of these two MAPKs, we analyzed the mitogenic response in regenerating liver after partial hepatectomy (PH) and in <b>primary</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> isolated from ERK 1 -deficient mice. We show that ERK 1 knockout and wild-type (wt) cells replicate with the same kinetics after PH in liver, in vivo, and in primary cultures of hepatocytes, in vitro. Indeed, Cyclin D 1 and Cdk 1 appear to be expressed concomitantly in knockout and wt cells, highlighting that hepatocytes progress in the cell cycle independently {{of the presence of}} ERK 1. Second, we specifically abolished ERK 2 expression by RNA interference in mouse and rat hepatocytes. We investigated whether small interfering RNA (siRNA) targeting ERK 2 could specifically inhibit its expression and interfere with the process of replication. In ERK 1 -deficient hepatocytes, silencing ERK 2 expression by RNA interference and ERK 2 activation by U 0126 clearly demonstrate that DNA replication is regulated by an ERK 2 -dependent mechanism. Furthermore, in rat wt hepatocytes, whereas ERK 2 targeting inhibits late G(1) and S phase progression, ERK 1 silencing is devoid of any effect on cell proliferation, indicating that ERK 1 cannot rescue ERK 2 deficiency. CONCLUSION: Our results emphasize the importance of the MAPK cascade in hepatocyte replication and allow us to conclude that ERK 2 is the key form involved in this regulation, in vivo and in vitro...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Flobufen (F) is an {{original}} nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drug with one center of chirality. 4 -Dihydroflobufen (DHF), compound with two chiral centers, {{is the main}} metabolite of F in microsomes and cytosol in all standard laboratory animals. This work describes the biotransformation of F enantiomers and DHF stereoisomers in isolated male guinea pig hepatocytes. Guinea pigs were chosen with respect to similarities in F metabolism as in Man found earlier. R-F, S-F, (2 R; 4 S) -DHF, (2 S; 4 R) -DHF, (2 S; 4 S) -DHF and (2 R; 4 R) -DHF, structurally very similar compounds, served as substrates in order to observe their interaction with enzymes. Stereospecificity of the respective enzymes was studied in vitro, using hepatocytes monolayer. Chiral HPLC using R,R-ULMO column as chiral stationary phase was used for detection and quantitation of metabolites. Results (2 R; 4 S) -DHF and (2 S; 4 S) -DHF were the principle stereoisomers detected after incubation with rac -F, R-F and S-F. The ratio of (2 R; 4 S) -DHF/(2 S; 4 S) -DHF ranged from 1. 1 to 2. 4 depending on the substrate used. (2 R; 4 S) -DHF was the major stereoisomer found after incubation with (2 S; 4 S) -DHF and (2 R; 4 R) -DHF. (2 S; 4 S) -DHF was the principle stereoisomer found after incubation with (2 R; 4 S) -DHF and (2 S; 4 R) -DHF. Besides DHF stereoisomers, other metabolites (M- 17203, UM- 1 and UM- 2) were also detected after incubation of hepatocytes monolayer with F.

The hepatocytes from the C 57 BL/ 6 adult mouse liver were isolated by a two-step collagenase perfusion method and cultured in T 25 culture flasks. Similar to our previous studies, the mouse hepatocytes progressively changed their morphology into a fibroblastic appearance {{after a few}} days of culture. After 7 – 10  days of culture, Kupffer-like cells, which were contaminants in the hepatocyte fraction {{at the start of the}} culture, actively proliferated on the mixed fibroblastic cell sheet. At this stage, a retroviral vector containing the human c-myc oncogene and neomycin resistance gene was introduced into the mixed culture. Gentle shaking of the culture flask, followed by the transfer and brief incubation of the culture supernatant, resulted in a quick and selective adhesion of Kupffer cells to a plastic dish surface. After selection with G 418 and cloning by limiting dilutions, a clonal cell line (KUP 5) was established. KUP 5 cells displayed typical macrophage morphology and were stably passaged at 4 – 5  days intervals for more than 5  months, with a population doubling time of 19  h. KUP 5 cells are immunocytochemically positive for mouse macrophage markers, such as Mac- 1, F 4 / 80.

The present study was therefore designed to test whether 9 -cis RA stimulates hepatocyte DNA synthesis. Male Wistar rats were given a single intragastric dose of 9 -cis RA (10 - 100 mg/Kg) or all trans retinoic acid (RA) (200 mg/Kg and 100 mg/Kg), and levels of hepatocyte DNA synthesis after 24 hours were determined by BrdU immunohistochemistry. Effects of 9 -cis RA and RA(10 (- 9) - 10 (- 5) M) on hepatocyte DNA synthesis in primary culture were also examined. Over 10 fold increases in the levels of BrdU incorporation were noted 24 hours after a single dose of 9 cis RA at a dose of 60 and 100 mg/Kg. RA at a dose of 200 mg/Kg induced a 5 - 6 fold increases in BrdU labeling, while a dose of 100 mg/Kg had no significant effects. Since the RA effect only occurs at higher doses, it may be only after conversion to 9 -cis RA.

In vitro exposure of primary cultures of mouse hepatocytes to APAP, 6. 6 mM, resulted in apoptosis followed by necrosis. Loss of cell viability correlates with early mitochondrial membrane potential (Δψm) hyperpolarization followed by depolarization and cytochrome c translocation from mitochondria to cytosol. APAP-induced apoptosis associated with procaspase- 3 and - 9 cleavage, appearance of truncated Bid and activation of poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). Treating <b>primary</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> with 5 μM cyclosporine and 10 μM trifluoperazine for eight resulted in significant reduction of apoptosis induced by APAP suggesting that loss of Δψm was mechanistically involved in apoptosis induced by APAP in vitro. NCX- 1000, but not UDCA, concentration-dependently (ED 50 = 16 μM) protected against Δψm depolarization and reduced transition from apoptosis to necrosis caused by 6. 6 mM APAP. Treating primary cultures of hepatocytes with the NO-donor DETA-NO, 100 μM, reduced apoptosis induced by APAP and prevented caspase activation. In conclusion, NCX- 1000 is effective in protecting against APAP-induced hepatotoxicity when administered in a therapeutic manner. This protection may involve the inhibition of apoptosis {{and the maintenance of}} mitochondrial integrity...|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{recently}} {{demonstrated in}} several mammalian species, a novel procedure to obtain liver-macrophages (Kupffer cells) in sufficient numbers and purity using a mixed <b>primary</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes.</b> In this study, we applied this method to the C 57 BL/ 6 mouse liver and established an immortalized Kupffer cell line from this mouse strain. The hepatocytes from the C 57 BL/ 6 adult mouse liver were isolated by a two-step collagenase perfusion method and cultured in T 25 culture flasks. Similar to our previous studies, the mouse hepatocytes progressively changed their morphology into a fibroblastic appearance {{after a few}} days of culture. After 7 – 10  days of culture, Kupffer-like cells, which were contaminants in the hepatocyte fraction {{at the start of the}} culture, actively proliferated on the mixed fibroblastic cell sheet. At this stage, a retroviral vector containing the human c-myc oncogene and neomycin resistance gene was introduced into the mixed culture. Gentle shaking of the culture flask, followed by the transfer and brief incubation of the culture supernatant, resulted in a quick and selective adhesion of Kupffer cells to a plastic dish surface. After selection with G 418 and cloning by limiting dilutions, a clonal cell line (KUP 5) was established. KUP 5 cells displayed typical macrophage morphology and were stably passaged at 4 – 5  days intervals for more than 5  months, with a population doubling time of 19 h. KUP 5 cells are immunocytochemically positive for mouse macrophage markers, such as Mac- 1, F 4 / 80. KUP 5 cells exhibited substantial phagocytosis of polystyrene microbeads and the release of inflammatory cytokines upon lipopolysaccharide stimulation. Taken together, KUP 5 cells provide a useful means to study the function of Kupffer cells in vitro...|$|E

Incubation <b>of</b> <b>primary</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> with IL- 1 β, TNF-α or lipopolysaccharide promotes the expression of the inducible form of nitric oxide synthase and NO release, a process that is inhibited to a different extent by incubation of the cells with EGF.

Therefore, EGF by itself or in combination with other cytokines may be involved in the downregulation of the NO synthesis that occurs in the early steps of liver regeneration.

Treatment <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> with media containing hyperosmotic glucose (75 mM final), tumor necrosis factor � (TNF�, 1 ng/ml final), and hepatocyte growth factor (HGF, 1 ng/ml final) caused activation of JNK 1. Glucose, TNF�, or HGF treatments increased phosphorylation of c-Jun at serine 63 in the transactivation domain and stimulated hepatocyte DNA synthesis. Infection <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> with polyl-lysine–coated adenoviruses coupled to constructs to express either dominant negatives Ras N 17, Rac 1 N 17, Cdc 42 N 17, SEK 1 �, or JNK 1 � blunted {{the abilities of}} glucose, TNF�, or HGF to increase JNK 1 activity, to increase phosphorylation of c-Jun at serine 63, and to stimulate DNA synthesis.

40|$|Abstract In this study, we {{explored}} the paradox that in suckling rats the serum concentration of LDL is high although the liver secretes only minimal quantities of VLDL, the presumed precursor of LDL. Freshly isolated hepatocytes and hepatocytes in <b>primary</b> <b>culture</b> obtained from adult (90 days old) and suckling (17 days old) rats {{were used to}} investigate the synthesis and secretion of apolipoprotein B (apoB) and lipids {{as well as the}} density profile of secreted apoB-containing lipoproteins.

40|$|In farm animals, {{there is}} no {{suitable}} cell line available to understand liver-specific functions. This has limited our understanding of liver function and metabolism in farm animals. Culturing and maintenance of functionally active hepatocytes is difficult, since they survive no more than few days. Establishing <b>primary</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> can help in studying cellular metabolism, drug toxicity, hepatocyte specific gene function and regulation. Here we provide a simple in vitro method for isolation and short-term culture of functionally active buffalo hepatocytes. Buffalo hepatocytes were isolated from caudate lobes by using manual enzymatic perfusion and mechanical disruption of liver tissue. Hepatocyte yield was (5. 3 ± 0. 66) × 107 cells per gram of liver tissue with a viability of 82. 3 ± 3. 5 %. Freshly isolated hepatocytes were spherical with well contrasted border. After 24 hours of seeding onto fibroblast feeder layer and different extracellular matrices like dry collagen, matrigel and sandwich collagen coated plates, hepatocytes formed confluent monolayer with frequent clusters. Cultured hepatocytes exhibited typical cuboidal and polygonal shape with restored cellular polarity. Cells expressed hepatocyte-specific marker genes or proteins like albumin, hepatocyte nuclear factor 4 α, glucose- 6 -phosphatase, tyrosine aminotransferase, cytochromes, cytokeratin and α 1 -antitrypsin. Hepatocytes could be immunostained with anti-cytokeratins, anti-albumin and anti α 1 -antitrypsin antibodies. Abundant lipid droplets were detected in the cytosol of hepatocytes using oil red stain. In vitro cultured hepatocytes could be grown for five days and maintained for up to nine days on buffalo skin fibroblast feeder layer. Cultured hepatocytes were viable for functional studies. We developed a convenient and cost effective technique for hepatocytes isolation for short-term culture that exhibited morphological and functional characteristics of active hepatocytes for studying gene expression, regulation, hepatic genomics and proteomics in farm animals...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the metabolic phenotype of the NF-κB p 50 knock-out (p 50 -KO) mice. Compared with wild type mice, the p 50 -KO mice had {{an increase in}} food intake, but a decrease in body fat content. On chow diet, their blood glucose dropped {{much more than the}} wild type (WT) mice in the insulin tolerance test. Their glucose infusion rate was 30 % higher than that of the WT mice in the hyperinsulinemic-euglycemic clamp. Their hepatic glucose production was suppressed more actively by insulin, and their insulin-induced glucose uptake was not altered in skeletal muscle or adipose tissue. In the liver, their p 70 S 6 K (S 6 K 1) protein was significantly lower, and tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) expression was much higher. Their S 6 K 1 protein was reduced by TNF-α treatment in the <b>primary</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes.</b> S 6 K 1 reduction was blocked by the proteasome inhibitor MG 132. In their livers, IKK 2 (IKKβ) activity was reduced together with IKKγ. Their S 6 K 1 degradation was dependent on IKK 2 deficiency. Reconstitution of the S 6 K 1 protein in their liver blocked the increase in insulin sensitivity. S 6 K 1 degradation was not observed in hepatocytes of the WT mice. The data suggest that inactivation of NF-κB p 50 leads to suppression of IKK 2 activity in the liver. IKK 2 deficiency leads to S 6 K 1 inhibition through TNF-induced protein degradation. The S 6 K 1 reduction may contribute to insulin sensitivity in p 50 -KO mice. This study suggests that hepatic S 6 K 1 may be a drug target in the treatment of insulin resistance...|$|E
40|$|We {{studied the}} {{replacement}} of hepatic S 9 with in vivo and in vitro induced hepatocytes as a metabolic activation system {{with the aim of}} broadening the possibilities of mutagenic assays. Rats were pretreated with b-naphtho-¯avone (BNF), phenobarbital (PB), 3 -methylcholanthrene (MC) and a combination of BNF and PB (BNF + PB). Mutagenic activation of benzo[a]pyrene (BP) and 2 -ami-noanthracene (2 AA) by hepatic S 9 and hepatocytes was determined in the Ames test. Primary rat hepatocytes were used for in vitro induction and were used as the acti-vating system in the Ames test. In vivo BNF treatment greatly increased the metabolic activation capacity of hepatic S 9 and hepatocytes towards BP. With regard to 2 AA activation, S 9 and hepatocytes showed different BNF induction pro®les. PB treatment reduced the mutagenicity of both compounds. Although ethoxyresoru®n O-dealkyl-ase (EROD) activity of S 9 from BNF + PB-treated animals was almost 30 -fold greater than the control, its effective-ness in activation of 2 AA was below the control level. A large part of the EROD activity of control cells was lost during culture, together with the ability to activate 2 AA, however, 72 h of MC induction increased EROD activity to 200 -fold of the control, which corresponds to 28 % of that of in vivo induced hepatocytes. The mutagenic poten-tial of BP activated by in vitro induced hepatocytes was 10 -fold above the control, which is 47 % of the mutagenicity detected following in vivo induction. In vitro induced hepa-tocytes increased 2 AA mutagenicity to 14. 6 -fold over the control, which corresponds to 68 % of in vivo induction. Our results suggest that <b>primary</b> <b>culture</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> provides a useful model {{for the study of the}} role of meta-bolic activation processes concerning enzyme activity of cytochromes P 450 and other metabolic enzymes and induction pro®les of different inducers...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} the baculovirus Autographa californica multiple nuclear polyhedrosis virus (AcMNPV) as a vector for gene delivery into mammalian cells. A modified AcMNPV virus was prepared that carried the Escherichia coli lacZ reporter gene under control of the Rous sarcoma virus promoter and mammalian RNA processing signals. This modified baculovirus was then used to infect a variety of mammalian cell lines. After infection of the human liver cell lines HepG 2, > 25 % of the cells showed high-level expression of the transduced gene. Over 70 % of the cells in <b>primary</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> rat <b>hepatocytes</b> showed expression <b>of</b> beta-galactosidase after exposure to the virus. Cell lines from other tissues showed less or no expression of lacZ after exposure to the virus. The block to expression in less susceptible cells does not appear to result from the ability to be internalized by the target cell but rather by events subsequent to viral entry. The onset of lacZ expression occurred within 6 hr of infection in HepG 2 cells and peaked 12 - 24 hr postinfection. Because AcMNPV is able to replicate only in insect hosts, is able to carry large (> 15 kb) inserts, and is a highly effective gene delivery vehicle for <b>primary</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes,</b> AcMNPV may be a useful vector for genetic manipulation of liver cells...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} hypoinsulinemic nonketotic {{streptozotocin}} diabetes on hepatic apo B synthesis and secretion was studied in <b>primary</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> rat <b>hepatocytes.</b> Diabetic rats {{were characterized by}} their significantly elevated serum glucose, apo B, and triglyceride levels, while serum insulin levels were {{less than a third}} of normal. Serum transminase activities of diabetic rats were significantly elevated when compared with control rats, which was attributed to an increase in liver transaminase activity in diabetic rats. The pattern of enzyme activities <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> reflected that observed in livers of donor rats and the pattern was retained by <b>primary</b> <b>cultures</b> <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> over the <b>culture</b> period. Hepatocytes from diabetic rats secreted only one third of the apo B secreted by hepatocytes from control rats, which was determined by monoclonal immunoassay of rat total apo B. Decreases in secretion were confirmed by measurement of secretory [35 S]methionine-labeled lipoprotein apo B radioactivity. The decreased apo B content <b>of</b> media <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> from diabetic rats was not due to increased apo B catabolism since hepatocytes from diabetic rats were shown to degrade less lipoprotein-apo B than hepatocytes from normal rats in control experiments. In addition, the apo B content <b>of</b> detergent-solubilized <b>hepatocytes</b> from diabetic rats was significantly less than that <b>of</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> from control rats. These results suggest that insulin is necessary for normal hepatic apo B synthesis and secretion and that the hyperlipidemia associated with hypoinsulinemia in vivo is primarily of intestinal origin...|$|R
