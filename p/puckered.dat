Seam <b>puckering</b> is the subject of many scientific studies, but evaluation of seam <b>puckering</b> parameters dependence on the load is not. The samples of two fabrics were used: 100 % silk and 100 % viscose. Samples came to different ends of load weight: 50 g, 100 g, 200 g, 300 g. For some samples the load was fixed in front, for others in the back, and in yet others, on both ends of the sample. The samples are made at two different speeds and were monitored sewed, with seam <b>puckering</b> immediately and after 24 h. Investigating how loading influenced the number of <b>pucker,</b> <b>pucker</b> height and length, <b>pucker</b> sharpness and coefficient. It was found that the load has a significant impact on the seam <b>puckering.</b> Seam <b>puckering</b> decreases at higher loads and under the load on both ends of the sample. Samples sewn at higher speeds had <b>puckering</b> increased by more than 50 %. In addition the length of the samples was measured immediately after sewing, after 24 hours, and after drying. It was observed that the length of a specimen was decreasing with a decreasing load, and after 24 hours, and after drying the length of the sample is reduced even further...|$|R

40|$|Includes bibliographical references. Carbohydrates {{consist of}} one or more sub-units usually various 5 - and 6 -membered cycles (furanoses and pyranoses) which can twist, bend or flip into a variety of conformers that differ in strain - this is ring <b>puckering.</b> These <b>puckers</b> notably the {{strained}} <b>puckering</b> conformers are observed during enzymatically assisted bond formation or cleavage of the glycosidic bonds of carbohydrate substrates. In this thesis, the free energy of ring <b>puckering</b> is calculated by implementing the Hill-Reilly reduced coordinate <b>pucker</b> description into the sampling enhancing Free Energies from Adaptive Reaction Coordinate Forces (FEARCF) method. FEARCF non-Boltzmann simulations of prototypical sugars Î²-Dribose and Î²-D-glucose converged to yield free energy <b>pucker</b> surfaces and volumes when using several semi-empirical QM methods - AM 1, PM 3, PM 3 CARB- 1 and SCC-DFTB. From this, the accessible <b>puckering</b> conformations and minimum free energy paths of <b>puckering</b> were reasoned An analysis of the furanose and pyranose free energy <b>pucker</b> surfaces and volumes compared with both Density Functional Theory RB 3 LYP/ 6 - 311 ++G** optimised structures and a Hartree-Fock free energy surface revealed that SCC-DFTB provides the best semi-empirical description of 5 - and 6 - membered carbohydrate ring deformation. This illustrates that necessary high energy ring conformations observed in enzymatic binding sites requires the enzyme to induce and preserve high energy conformations required for successful hydrolyses and synthesis of the glycosidic bond. To further test this hypothesis, a 5 - and 6 -membered cycle were studied within enzymatic environments. The polysaccharide cellulose contains Î² 1 - 4 linked glucose subunit and is degraded by cellulase, a glycosidase. Specifically, the retaining cellobiohydrolase I (CBHI) of Trichoderma Reesei which cleaves cellobiose units from crystalline cellulose. The free energy volumes of <b>puckering</b> for the glucose sub-unit (in the catalytic position of an 8 unit cellulosic fragment - cellooctaose) were calculated and explored in vacuum, water and in the active site of CBHI. It was observed that the binding pocket of enzymes limits the ring <b>pucker</b> and that the active site amino acids preferentially stabilise certain <b>puckering</b> conformations. For CBHI, {{the first part of the}} glycosidase reaction is the glycosylation step. This was driven to completion during SCC-DFTB QM/MD FEARCF calculations where GLU 212, ASP 214 and GLU 217 and part of the substrate were treated quantum mechanically. The general hybrid orbital method was used to connect the QM and MM regions. The free energy barriers of glycosylation were computed and the <b>puckering</b> statistics during the conversion of cellooctaose to products were correlated with this.

40|$|The {{main focus}} of this thesis is to {{investigate}} the relative conformational flexibilities of α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrins in water by analysing their macrocyclic ring <b>puckering</b> motion from Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations. In particular, the <b>puckering</b> of the CDs is investigated through a coarse grained analysis of full atomistic simulations, where the CD conformational motions are studied on the macrocyclic scale rather than the atomistic scale. The flexibilities of the cyclodextrins (CDs) are then compared to their experimentally-observed aqueous solubility trend {{in order to try}} explain the anomalously flow solubility of β-cyclodextrin. β-CD has important applications in industry, such as the pharmaceutical industry, thus exploring the conformational reasons for its low solubility can help to design more effective cyclodextrin-based products in future. The ring <b>puckering</b> of the CDs is measured quantitatively using a reduced system of <b>puckering</b> coordinates based on the method of triangular tessellation. The triangular tessellation definition for monocylic 6 -membered rings is first extended to 7 - and 8 -membered rings, and the corresponding <b>puckering</b> coordinates are derived mathematically. The macrocyclic CD rings are then simplified to monocyclic representations through an appropriate coarse graining of the molecules (specifically, α-, β- and γ-cyclodextrins are simplified to 6 -, 7 - and 8 -sided rings, respectively), and the corresponding triangular tessellation definition is then used to measure their macrocyclic <b>puckering.</b> The rates of decay of the <b>puckering</b> motion are then calculated using time correlation functions, from which the relative flexibilities of the CDs is determined. Probability distributions are also used to investigate the ranges of the CD <b>puckering.</b> In addition, the horizontal contraction and expansion of the macrocyclic rings (termed """"breathing"""" herein) is analysed to supplement the <b>puckering</b> analysis. <b>Puckering</b> coordinates based on the triangular tessellation of 6 -membered rings have been used previously to characterise all 38 canonical states of cyclohexane. In this thesis, a systematic procedure is developed to generate the triangular tessellation <b>puckering</b> coordinates of all the canonical states of 6 -, 7 - and 8 -membered rings, and the coordinates for all canonical states of cycloheptane and cyclooctane are subsequently generated. These <b>puckering</b> coordinates can be useful not only in the conformational analysis of cyclohexane, cycloheptane and cyclooctane, but also to quantitatively characterise the conformations of 6 -, 7 - and 8 -membered rings in general, both from experimental and computational studies...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The {{pathogenesis}} of macular <b>pucker</b> and macular holes {{is poorly}} understood. Anomalous posterior vitreous detachment (PVD) and vitreoschisis {{have been proposed}} as possible mechanisms. This study used clinical imaging to seek vitreoschisis and study the topographic features of macular <b>pucker</b> and macular holes. Methods: Combined optical coherence tomography and scanning laser ophthalmoscopy (OCT/SLO) was performed in 45 eyes with macular hole and 44 eyes with macular <b>pucker.</b> Longitudinal imaging was used to identify vitreoschisis and measure retinal thickness. The topographic features of eyes with macular hole with eccentric macular contraction were compared to 24 eyes with unifocal macular <b>pucker</b> using coronal plane imaging. Results: Vitreoschisis was detected in 24 of 45 eyes (53. 3 %) with macular hole and 19 of 44 (43. 2 %) with macular <b>pucker.</b> Retinal contraction was detected eccentrically in the macula of 18 of 45 eyes (40 %) with macular hole. In eyes with macular hole with unifocal retinal contraction, the average surface area of contraction (23. 12 ± 18. 79 mm 2) was significantly smaller than in eyes with macular <b>pucker</b> (63. 20 ± 23. 68 mm 2; P =. 006). The distance {{from the center of}} retinal contraction {{to the center of the}} macula was significantly greater in eyes with macular hole (8. 64 ± 2. 33 mm) than eyes with macular <b>pucker</b> (4. 45 ± 1. 90 mm; P =. 0001).
