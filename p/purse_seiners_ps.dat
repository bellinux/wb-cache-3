40|$|The American style <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> {{developed}} in the United States was studied in comparision with the tuna long liner {{developed in}} Japan, in terms of principal particulars, speed, hull form and conditions expressed in mean value of four vessels each. In comparison with the tuna long liner of 500 GT class, the American style <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> {{of the same size}} is 20. 2 % broader in actual size and 16 % broader in L/B and has more stability. The speed which is required to be over 14 knots in cruising condition is 14. 7 knots for the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> and 12. 8 knots for the tuna long liner. The <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> has the hull form of greater midship section coefficient and smaller block coefficient, i. e., the hull form of fat midship and rapidly slim bow and stern. The incident angle of water line at the bow is 9 ～ 14 degrees for the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> while it is approximately 38 degrees for the tuna long liner. The trim of the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> in light load condition is by the head since this vessel carries net and skiff boat in the stern area. This is a significant characteristic of the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner.</b> The metacentric height (GM) in full load condition, i. e., in working condition is 0. 93 m which is about twice as much as that of ordinary fishing vessels, giving consideration to the safty against unvavorable condition in navigation and fishing operation. However, the period of rolling is 7 ～ 9 seconds which is an ordinary period for the fishing vessel of 500 GT class. 米国で開発された 500 総トン級米国式旋網船と日本で開発された 500 総トン級鮪延縄船各 4 隻の要目,速力、船型,性能の平均値を比較検討した。米国式旋網船は,甲板上の搭載物重量が重いため幅を鮪延縄船より 20. 2 %広げて復原力を増している。米国式旋網船の巡航速力である 3 / 4 負荷では, 14 ノット以上要求されているが,調査した限りでは平均で 14. 7 ノットであり,鮪延縄船では, 12, 8 ノットであった。米国式旋網船は,船体中央部では鮪延縄船より肥っているが船首および船尾で急激にやせている船型である。船首の水線入射角は,米国式旋網船は極端に小さく 9 度～ 14 度であり,鮪延縄船では 38 度位である。軽荷状態の米国式旋網船のTrimはTrim by the headである。船尾に重量物(漁網約 30 トン, 9 mスキフボート約 15 トン) を積む関係であるが,このTrimは顕著な特徴である。重量物の搭載後の満載状態では 1. 14 mTrim by the sternとなり,航海に適したTrimとなる。運航者が,船の安全度と初期復原力を知る目安としているMetacentric height (GM) は,稼働状態の満載状態では 0. 93 mで一般漁船の約 2 倍となっているが,漁撈時に於ける船体の傾斜,その他の航海,操業時における悪条件の中での安全性について考慮を払ったものと思われる。GMが大きければ横揺れ周期が短くなるが,周期は 7 ～ 9 秒で 500 トン級漁船としては通常の周期である...|$|R
40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the fishing effort exerted by <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> on tropical tuna requires a constant monitoring {{of the changes in}} individual fishing power of <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> due to changes in vessel characteristics, fishing gears or fishing strategies. Also, since the 1990 s, increasing numbers of drifting Fish Aggregating Devices have been used by this fleet. As dFADs contribute to a reduction of search times, traditional measures of fishing effort such as search time or fishing time are inappropriate. Here, using logbook data from the French and the Spanish purse seine fleets over 2003 - 2014, the effects of purse seiners' characteristics (length, the size of the wells, period of construction) and their use of support vessels on the efficiency of <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> are analyzed with GLM models. 3 dimensions of the efficiency of <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> are analyzed: monthly catch rates, monthly frequency of fishing sets and monthly distance of fishing sets. Among others, we find that support vessels contribute to an increase in catch rates (+ 10 tons per day) and in distance between fishing set. In a second steps, the results of the GLM models are used to build 3 indexes of fishing effort that are compared to a simple monitoring of the number of EU <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> over 2003 - 2014.

As to the motion characteristics of the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> in longitudinal wave, the relative pitching of the bow against the wave surface shows a 20 ～ 30 % greater amplitude when synchronized with the severest head sea as compared with the conventional avarage Japanese fishing vessels. However, since consideration has been given to the height of the bow freeboard and to the increase of flaring, the splash of waves from the bow may not be particularly strong. 米国で開発された 500 総トン級米国式旋網船と英国で開発され日本で改良固定された 500 総トン級船尾トロール船各 4 隻の諸要目,速力,船型,性能の平均値を比較検討した。米国式旋網船は船尾トロール船より巾が 15. 8 %広い。平均速力は,巡航速力(3 / 4 負荷) における米国式旋網船が 2. 8 ノット速い 14. 7 ノットであり,抵抗試験によれば米国式旋網船は現存の肥大船型に比べて推進馬力が半分以下でも同一速力が出せる燃料節減船型である事が推定されている。船型は,船体中央部が旋網船が肥っており船首尾でやせており,プロペラ前方の船底部分がきれいな流線型となっている。旋網船の縦波中の運動特性は,船首の波面に対する相対上下揺振を在来の平均的日本漁船と比べると最もきびしい向い波同調状態時において 20 ～ 30 %程度の振巾増加が見られるが,船首乾舷の高さとフレアーの増大が考慮されているので船首からの波浪打ち込みが特に激しくなる事は無いと考えられる...|$|R

To account for differences in fishing strategy and quality of data sources available, the fleet was split between a component of large <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> and a component composed of baitboats and <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> that can collaborate at sea.

40|$|The {{commercial}} tuna fishery of the East Atlantic {{and like}} wise the Ghanaian tuna fishery {{are based on}} the harvests of Bigeye, Skipjack and Yellowfin. In Ghana, baitboats and <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> commercially harvest these species of tuna. This study analysed the CPUE for the Ghanaian tuna fishery. The analysis was made for the three species and also for the two vessel types. The effort was standardized to large <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> days. The results when compared to the CPUE per species for the East Atlantic revealed that the Ghanaian vessels (1980 – 2000) were in some cases up to 40 times more efficient than large <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> in the East Atlantic (1967 - 1980). A single species bioeconomic analysis was conducted {{for each of the three}} species using biological parameters adopted from Conrad and Adu-Asamoah (1986). This showed that present harvest levels of Skipjack and Yellowfin for the East Atlantic region were in excess of the open access equilibrium. Thus a decline in future harvest levels of Skipjack and Yellowfin is expected.

40|$|Seabirds {{are known}} to make {{extensive}} use of fishery waste, a phenomenon that has been particularly well studied in relation to demersal fisheries, especially when operating during daylight hours. Contrarily, very {{little is known about}} the importance of predominantly nocturnal fisheries in providing feeding opportunities to seabirds. We considered the particular case of purse seining for small pelagic fish, which takes place basically at night, and assessed the significance of this fishing practice for seabirds off the Ebro Delta (NW Mediterranean). Fieldwork was conducted on board commercial <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> (nocturnal activity) in 1997 - 1998, and was complemented with observations performed on board both commercial bottom trawlers (diurnal activity; 1997 - 1998) and a research vessel (1999 - 2000). The purse seine fleet targets small clupeoids, which are attracted and concentrated by the light of a powerful lamp, and then captured using an encircling net. <b>Purse</b> <b>seiners</b> frequently changed fishing area, took very variable catches, and were strongly influenced by the weather. This made the fishery unattractive to most seabird species, which primarily attended <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> during the discarding process. This process took place on the way back to port after dawn (i. e. with daylight) during daylight and was quite irregular, thus attracting lower numbers of seabirds than did trawlers. The threatened Audouin's gull Larus audouinii was the only species attending <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> regularly at night, capturing live fish concentrated at the sea surface during the hauling process. This is in accordance with the specialisation of this gull in the capture of epipelagic fish at night, which seems facilitated by <b>purse</b> <b>seiners.</b> Indeed, the vessels would favour the direct capture of fish (illumination of the sea surface, concentration of the fish), as well as the location of the shoals (light signalling). The purse seining fishery was especially important for Audouin's gull during trawling moratoria (when trawling discards were not available) and in the non-breeding season. A simple bioenergetic model estimated that individual Audouin's gulls could obtain a mean of 669 kJ haul- 1, which would represent far more than hall of the daily energy requirements of breeding birds. Provided that Audouin's gulls feeding in a given area could attend more than one haul in a short time, birds attending <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> at night could easily meet their energy requirements. However, there was strong variability in our estimate (from 0 to 1659 kJ bird- 1 haul- 1, 95 % CI), and feeding at <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> would only sometimes be profitable for Audouin's gulls. Purse seine fisheries could be of importance for other nocturnal seabirds in other regions such as the SE Pacific, and this deserves further research. It is important to note that <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> could also be detrimental for many seabirds, through direct competition and eventual depletion of fish stocks.

40|$|In {{the term}} of {{promoting}} fish resources management to be sutainable and profitable as great as possible for the people welfare, the Government applies the PPP and PHP (Fishery Exploitation Levy and Fish Caught Levy) in giving a fish catching exploitation licence as for adding the state non-tax revenue. The purpose of study {{is to examine the}} fish catch compositions and kinds of fish species of the small pelagic <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> boat, the PPP and PHP influences on the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> fishermen incomes, and compare the amount of PHP determined by the Government and of the study result PHP. Case study method was used the study about existing of <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> boat fishermen in Pekalongan City as the study location. The sampling technique was carried out systematically. The data analysis used the qualitative descriptive and t-test statistic analysis. The qualitative descriptive analysis was used for analyzing the fish catch compositions and kind of fish species and determining the fish prices. The t-test was used for analyzing the significant differences of the PPP and PHP influences on determind the small pelagis <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> boat fisherman incomes, and comparing the amount of PHP by Goverment and study result PHP too. The result of study showed that the fish catch compositions of the 30 GT or more <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> boat {{for the last five years}}, namely in the 1997 — 2001 in Pekalongan, indicated that there were fluctuations of the production amounts. From the average production amount of each fish kind of <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> boat fish catches for the last five years the largest fish kind composition was Layang followed by Lemuru, then Banyar, Tembang, Selar and the other fish kinds have the least compositions. Of the fish kinds the salted fish composition was larger than the fresh or iced fish composition. The highest price of the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> boat fish catches was the species of Banyar/Kembung and the lowest one was Tembang species. Based on the fish quality price of fresh or iced fish price was higher than the salted one. The PPP and PHP influenced the incomes of fishermen, especially of the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> boat owner. Income at the first trip of the boat owner who has paid the PPP and PHP has a negative value or the boat owner suffered a financial loss. Mean while the boat owner who has not paid the PPP and PHP yet has a high income per trip. For the income per trip of captain, motorist, skilled worker, and crew who both has and has not paid PPP and PHP yet was not influenced by the magnitude of fishery levies. The one-year income of the <b>purse</b> <b>seiner</b> boat owner who has paid the PPP and PHP were lower than the owners who have not yet. While the incomes among their captains, motorist, siklled worker, crews were not much different. The PHP value of the government calculation based on the old HPI (Floor Price of Fish; The Decision of Trade and Industry Minister No. 213 / 2001) was much higher than the one based on the study calculation. But if we compared the PHP calculation based on the new HPI (Decision of Trade and Industry Minister No. 548 / 2002) with the one based on the study result calculation between them was not much differrence. Therefore it need immediately to socialize and iluminate the PHP imposition based on the new HPI calculation. ...|$|R

40|$|Competition {{between the}} yellow-legged gull Larus cachinnans and Audouin's gull Larus audouinii while {{foraging}} at commercial fishing vessels off the Ebro Delta (NW Mediterranean) was assessed in 1997 and 1998. Observations {{were performed on}} board two kinds of fishing vessels with different timetables: bottom trawlers (diurnal activity) and <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> (nocturnal activity). Three situations were distinguished {{with respect to the}} season and the fishing regime: (1) breeding season, both fleets operating; (2) breeding season, only <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> operating due to a trawling moratorium; (3) non-breeding season, both fleets operating. Overall, the yellow-legged gull behaved as an opportunist species and exerted pressure over Audouin's gull through kleptoparasitism and agonistic interactions (i. e. contest competition). Despite this, Audouin's gull was more efficient at capturing discards through scramble competition and was able to take profit from fishing vessels when the capture of fish required high skill, in accordance with its higher specialisation. Competition varied in intensity according to the fishing fleet and the season. Indeed, Audouin's and the yellow-legged gulls only interfered at trawlers, since only Audouin's gull attended <b>purse</b> <b>seiners.</b> During the breeding season competition at trawlers was not severe and Audouin's gull preferentially attended these vessels. <b>Purse</b> <b>seiners</b> acted as a secondary food resource and only attracted important numbers of Audouin's gulls during trawling moratoriums. Out of the breeding season the number of Audouin's gulls strongly declined in the area. Furthermore, the intensity of kleptoparasitism increased at trawlers, and the average size of the fish discarded was larger and less suitable. In parallel with these changes, Audouin's gull shifted to attend <b>purse</b> <b>seiners</b> preferentially, thus avoiding the high levels of competition at the trawlers. The lower representation of Audouin's gull in other breeding areas in the Mediterranean, as well as the less important fishing fleets in these areas, would probably reduce the attractiveness of trawlers for this species, even during the breeding season. Moreover, changes in fishing policies aimed to reduce discarding practices would lead to a globally less favourable situation for Audouin's gull. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
