40|$|Joint {{carbon and}} {{nitrogen}} isotope measurements {{were made from}} chlorins (chlorophyll a, phaeophytin a and <b>pyrophaeophytin</b> a) extracted from the last glacial-interglacial transition sediments of Lake Suigetsu, central Japan. These data highlight both the potential and difficulty of using chlorin-specific isotopes to track aquatic change from lake sediments. δ 13 C and δ 15 N of the three chlorins show coherent patterns with time, supporting the theory that phaeophytin a and <b>pyrophaeophytin</b> a are early diagenetic products of chlorophyll a and that despite this transition, their isotopic signatures remain intact. However, our {{data suggest that the}} isotopic composition of phaeophytin a and <b>pyrophaeophytin</b> a can be imprecise proxies for the isotope composition of chlorophyll a, possibly owing to the complex array of factors which affect the synthesis, transformation and sedimentation of these phaeopigments in nature. The total accumulation of organic matter in Lake Suigetsu appears to be controlled by the balance of allocthonous and authocthonous material as reflected by the C/N ratio. However, both bulk organic and chlorin-specific δ 13 C show similar changes, suggesting that the first order variability in bulk organic δ 13 C reflects aquatic change. By contrast, there is no similarity between chlorin and bulk δ 15 N, suggesting that interpretation of bulk δ 15 N in this setting is compromised by diagenetic alteration. The isotopic composition of chlorins are interpreted to reflect the response of aquatic primary productivity to post-glacial environmental change. However, further research into the synthesis and transformation of chlorins in the modern environment is required in order to facilitate a more rigorous approach to interpreting isotope ratios in chlorins extracted from sediments...|$|E
40|$|The transformations {{undergone}} by chlorophyll a under anoxic {{conditions have}} been simulated {{by using the}} widespread marine prymnesiophyte Emiliania huxleyi as a substrate for a mixed bacterial community by incubation in a sediment slurry under sulphate reducing conditions. This resulted {{in the formation of}} <b>pyrophaeophytin</b> a after 77 days, along with smaller amounts of phaeophorbide a, pyrophaeophorbide a and mesopyrophaeophorbide a, from an original pigment distribution comprising mainly phaeophytin a, with a lower abundance of chlorophyll a. Mesopyrophaeophorbide a has not been reported previously as a product of any chlorophyll a defunctionalization study. Its formation under the conditions used suggests that the reduction of the C- 3 vinyl substituent, required for transformation of chlorophyll a to a number of sedimentary porphyrins and chlorins, is a process which involves anaerobic bacterial communities...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—We have {{determined}} the chlorophyll pigment composition by liquid chromatography (LC) and LC/MS/MS in a 1. 45 -m long freeze core, representing 157 years of annually varved sedimentation, from Saanich Inlet, B. C, Canada. We investigated {{the very early}} diagenetic processes of chlorophyll a alteration in these anoxic sediments and the possible implications for palaeoproductivity studies. Excellent preservation of pigments is indicated by high total pigment concentrations, {{and the presence of}} labile compounds such as chlorophyllide a. The lack of systematic down core changes in both the total pigment concentration and the chlorin composition indicates that no detectable alteration of the pigment composition has occurred during the past 157 years. The sedimentary pigment composition is the result of processes occurring in the water column, or within few months after deposition. Chlorophyll derivatives corresponding to different diagenetic processes have distinct down core profiles. Profiles of compounds related to grazing activity steryl pyrophaeophorbide esters (SPE) and <b>pyrophaeophytin</b> a, are very similar. In contrast, dephytylated compounds (chlorophyllide a and phaeophorbide a), which are related to chlorophyllase activity during the degradation of ungrazed diatom cells, show an independent pattern. Quantifying pigment composition in Saanich Inlet sediments can help constrain processes regarding the transport of algal pigments to the sediments. Copyright © 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd 1...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} the results of experiments to determine the influence of selected physico-chemical factors - oxygen, visible light and temperature - on the decomposition of (1) chlorophylls a, b and c, chlorophyll a derivatives and beta-carotene in acetone solution, and (2) chlorophyll a and beta-carotene in axenic cultures of the blue-green algae Anabaena variabilis. The results indicate that both in acetone extracts and in blue-green algae cultures these pigments were most sensitive to light and oxygen; temperatures of up to 25 o C had no marked influence on these compounds. Under anoxia in acetone solution, the stability towards light decreased in the order chlorophyll a, chlorophyll b, chlorophylls c. Chlorophyll a, moreover, was less stable than its derivatives - phaeophorbides, phaeophytins, <b>pyrophaeophytins</b> and steryl chlorins - but more stable than beta-carotene, in the last case also in the blue-green algae cultures. Decomposition of all the pigments proceeded mainly via the breakdown of the porphyrin macrocycle, since the decomposition products were not detected in the VIS range. On the basis of these experiments one can state that while light and oxygen may have a decisive direct influence on the distribution of chlorophylls and beta-carotene in sediments, in the natural environment, temperatures of up to 25 o C may have very little immediate effect...|$|R
