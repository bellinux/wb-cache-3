40|$|This paper investigates {{whether it}} is costly for nonfinancial firms to enter the <b>public</b> <b>bond</b> market, and whether firms benefit from their bond IPOs. We find that both gross spreads and ex ante credit spreads are higher for IPO bonds, {{suggesting}} that firms pay higher underwriting costs on their first <b>public</b> <b>bond.</b> We also find that underpricing in the secondary market is higher for IPO bonds, further suggesting that it is costly to enter the <b>public</b> <b>bond</b> market. The costs of entering the <b>public</b> <b>bond</b> market are economically meaningful and are higher for risky firms. We investigate the benefits from entering the <b>public</b> <b>bond</b> market, {{by looking at the}} costs firms pay to raise external funding subsequently to their bond IPOs. Our results show that these benefits exist, but they accrue only to safe firms. These firms benefit from a reduction both in the interest rates they pay on bank loans and the costs they incur to issue private bonds after they enter the <b>public</b> <b>bond</b> market. Together with our the previous findings, these results lend support to the thesis that bond IPOs are unique. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: We {{analyze the}} role of {{different}} kinds of primary and secondary market interventions for the government’s goal to maximize its revenues from <b>public</b> <b>bond</b> issuances. Some of these interventions {{can be thought of as}} characteristics of a "primary dealer system". After all, we see that a primary dealer system with a restricted number of participants may be useful in case of only restricted competition among sufficiently heterogeneous market makers. We further show that minimum secondary market turnover requirements for primary dealers with respect to bond sales seem to be in general more adequate than the definition of maximum bid-ask-spreads or minimum turnover requirements with respect to bond purchases. Moreover, official price management operations are not able to completely substitute for a system of primary dealers. Finally it should be noted that there is in general no reason for monetary compensations to primary dealers since they already possess some privileges with respect to <b>public</b> <b>bond</b> auctions...|$|R
40|$|The current paper {{reviews the}} {{developments}} that took place, starting with November 2001, inside the Romanian Municipal and Treasury bond market segments at the Bucharest Stock Exchange. The {{development of a}} debt market has as a main objective to encourage the central, regional and local governments to consider bond ﬁnance as an important way for regional and local project investments; it could enhance the quality and the efﬁciency of ﬁnanced projects and encourage long term ﬁnancial planning. The relatively modest proﬁle of the Romanian <b>public</b> <b>bond</b> sector at Bucharest Stock Exchange {{can be explained by}} the late introduction of the T-bonds (7 years after the bond sector was launched). Lacking the benchmark the T-bonds could offer, it was only natural for investors to avoid the (Municipal) bond sector. The development of the domestic <b>public</b> <b>bond</b> sector is expected to continue in the years to come, mainly if through bond ﬁnancing the central/regional and local authorities will support investment projects that will trigger and/or generate economic development...|$|R
40|$|Modern {{corporate}} finance theory argues that although bank monitoring is beneficial to borrowers, {{it also allows}} banks to use the private information they gain through monitoring to "hold-up" borrowers for higher interest rates. In this paper, we seek empirical evidence for this information hold-up cost. Since new information about a firm's credit-worthiness is revealed {{at the time of}} its first issue in the <b>public</b> <b>bond</b> market, it follows that after firms undertake their bond IPO, banks with an exploitable information advantage will be forced to adjust their loan interest rates downwards, particularly for firms that are revealed to be safe. Our findings show that firms are able to borrow from banks at lower interest rates after they issue for the first time in the <b>public</b> <b>bond</b> market and that the magnitude of these savings is larger for safer firms. We further find that among safe firms, those that get their first credit rating at the time of their bond IPO benefit from larger interest rate savings than those that already had a credit rating when they entered the bond market. Since more information is revealed at the time of the bond IPO on the former firms and since this information will increase competition from uninformed banks, these findings provide support for the hypothesis that banks price their informational monopoly. Finally, we find that while entering the <b>public</b> <b>bond</b> market may reduce these informational rents, it is costly to firms because they have to pay higher underwriting costs on their IPO bonds. Moreover, IPO bonds are subject to more underpricing than subsequent bonds when they first trade in the secondary bond market. Corporate bonds; Credit ratings...|$|R
