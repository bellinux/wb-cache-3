He also plays Harmonica, Banjo, Lap Steel, Mandolin, sings and plays standard electric guitars.|$|E
50|$|These metal drums {{have two}} {{openings}} with flanges (2 in NPS and Â¾ in NPS). Once the drums are filled, the plugs (bungs) are screwed in the flanges using pneumatic or hand operated bung tightener (<b>plug</b> <b>wrench).</b> To secure {{the contents of}} the drums against theft and adulteration during shipment, cap-seals made of metal and other types like metal-plastic laminates are used. These cap-seals sit on top of the flanges and are crimped, using a drum cap-seal crimping tool, also called a drum cap sealer. Once cap-seals are crimped, the plugs can be unscrewed only by breaking these cap-seals. Pneumatic and hand-operated cap-seal crimping tools are available. Pneumatic ones are used in production lines for high production.|$|E
