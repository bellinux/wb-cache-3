5|$|The {{intertidal}} mud flats {{of the bay}} have a {{long history}} of use for fishing, with structures on Stert Flats being dated by dendrochronological analysis to between 932 and 966. It is the last site in England used for 'mudhorse fishing' in which a wooden sledge is propelled across the mudflats to collect fish from nets. Catches include: Thinlip mullet, <b>plaice,</b> dogfish, cuttlefish, skate, shrimp, prawns, sea bass, and sole. Watchet Boat Museum displays the unusual local flatner boats which were used for fishing in the bay, along with associated artefacts.|$|E
25|$|Other {{examples}} of coastal demersal fish are cod, <b>plaice,</b> monkfish and sole.|$|E
25|$|At nearby {{locations}} {{there is}} evidence of deep sea fishing for <b>plaice</b> and cod, and of consumption of venison.|$|E
25|$|In Britain and Ireland, {{cod and haddock}} appear most {{commonly}} as the fish used for fish and chips, but vendors also sell many other kinds of fish, especially other white fish, such as pollock or coley, <b>plaice,</b> skate, and ray (particularly popular in Ireland); and huss or rock salmon (a term covering several species of dogfish and similar fish). In Northern Ireland, cod, <b>plaice</b> or whiting appear {{most commonly}} in 'fish suppers'—'supper' being Scottish and Northern Irish chip-shop terminology for a food item accompanied by chips. Suppliers in Devon and Cornwall often offer pollock and coley as cheap alternatives to haddock, due to their regular availability in a common catch.|$|E
25|$|The fauna of the Baltic sea is {{a mixture}} of marine and {{freshwater}} species. Among marine fishes are cod, herring, hake, <b>plaice,</b> flounder, shorthorn sculpin, stickleback and turbot, and examples of freshwater species include perch, pike, whitefish and roach.|$|E
25|$|In recent decades, {{overfishing}} {{has left}} many fisheries unproductive, disturbing {{marine food chain}} dynamics and costing jobs in the fishing industry. Herring, cod and <b>plaice</b> fisheries may soon face the same plight as mackerel fishing, which ceased in the 1970s due to overfishing.|$|E
25|$|Most {{demersal}} fish of commercial or recreational interest are coastal, {{confined to the}} upper 200 metres. Commercially important demersal food fish species include flatfish, such as flounder, sole, turbot, <b>plaice,</b> and halibut. Also important are cod, hake, redfish, haddock, bass, congers, sharks, rays and chimaeras.|$|E
25|$|Typical Danish {{fish and}} chips are <b>plaice</b> fillets, breaded and fried, and served {{alongside}} a remoulade, a slice of lemon, and chips ("pommes frites") on the side. It is normally served in restaurants, not as fast food. Other light-coloured fish may be used, such as other flatfish, cod or saithe.|$|E
25|$|Young Atlantic cod or haddock {{prepared}} in strips for cooking is called scrod. In the United Kingdom, Atlantic cod {{is one of}} the most common ingredients in fish and chips, along with haddock and <b>plaice.</b> Cod's soft liver can be tinned (canned) and eaten. Cod is mainly consumed in Portugal, Spain, Italy and Brazil.|$|E
25|$|The fishing {{industry}} in the adjacent community of Northport is a significant economic activity, with landings by fishing boats totalling 3 million kilograms of species such as American lobster, mussels, snow crab, soft shell clams, cod, herring, American <b>plaice,</b> mackerel, sea scallop, yellowtail, eel, winter flounder, smelt, rock crab, tomcod, silversides, porbeagle, and blue shark.|$|E
25|$|In the United Kingdom, Atlantic cod {{is one of}} {{the most}} common kinds of fish to be found in fish and chips, along with haddock and <b>plaice.</b> It is also well known for being widely {{consumed}} in Portugal and the Basque Country, where it is considered a treasure of the nation's cuisine.|$|E
25|$|Cod {{is popular}} {{as a food}} with a mild flavour and a dense, flaky, white flesh. Cod livers are {{processed}} to make cod liver oil, {{an important source of}} vitamin A, vitamin D, vitamin E, and omega-3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA). Young Atlantic cod or haddock prepared in strips for cooking is called scrod. In the United Kingdom, Atlantic cod {{is one of the most}} common ingredients in fish and chips, along with haddock and <b>plaice.</b>|$|E
25|$|In the sea {{surrounding}} Amrum numerous {{fish species}} {{typical of the}} North Sea can be found, like <b>plaice</b> and atlantic herring. A 1940 report mentioned several worms like Nematodes, Archiannelida, Oligochaeta and Turbellaria, crustaceans like ostracods, and ciliate protozoans in the sands of the Kniepsand beach. Since the 1980s, the abundance of harbour porpoises in the sea off Amrum and Sylt has been increasing and a protected marine area was created in 1999 to provide shelter for them.|$|E
25|$|Copepods {{and other}} {{zooplankton}} are plentiful in the North Sea. These tiny organisms are crucial {{elements of the}} food chain supporting many species of fish. Over 230 species of fish live in the North Sea. Cod, haddock, whiting, saithe, <b>plaice,</b> sole, mackerel, herring, pouting, sprat, and sandeel are all very common and are fished commercially. Due to the various depths of the North Sea trenches and differences in salinity, temperature, and water movement, some fish such as blue-mouth redfish and rabbitfish reside only in small areas of the North Sea.|$|E
25|$|Roe deer {{occupy the}} {{countryside}} in growing numbers, and large-antlered red deer {{can be found}} in the sparse woodlands of Jutland. Denmark is also home to smaller mammals, such as polecats, hares and hedgehogs. Approximately 400 bird species inhabit Denmark and about 160 of those breed in the country. Large marine mammals include healthy populations of Harbour porpoise, growing numbers of pinnipeds and occasional visits of large whales, including blue whales and orcas. Cod, herring and <b>plaice</b> are abundant fish in Danish waters and form the basis for a large fishing industry.|$|E
25|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{typically}} Danish {{contribution to the}} meals {{of the day is}} the traditional lunch or smørrebrød consisting of open sandwiches, usually on thinly sliced rugbrød. The meal usually begins with seafood such as marinated herring, smoked eel, crab, or breaded <b>plaice</b> filets with remoulade and moves on with slices of roast pork or beef, frikadeller (meatballs), hams and liver pâté. The sandwiches are richly garnished with onion rings, radish slices, cucumbers, tomato slices, parsley, remoulade or mayonnaise. The meal is mostly accompanied by beer, on occassion also by shots of ice-cold snaps or akvavit.|$|E
25|$|Until the mid1960s, {{fishing was}} {{perceived}} as Lowestoft's main industry, although from the 1930s the percentage of those employed directly and in trades associated with fishing was actually only about 10 per cent of the working population. Fleets of drifters and trawlers caught fish such as herring, cod and <b>plaice.</b> Catches have diminished since the 1960s and, although by the 1980s 100 boats remained, there are now only a few small boats operating out of Lowestoft, with no large trawlers. By 2011 just three traders remained at the town's fish market which is under threat of closure due to the redevelopment of the port. The Centre for Environment, Fisheries and Aquaculture Science (CEFAS), a large fisheries research centre that {{is a part of}} Defra, is still located in Lowestoft.|$|E
25|$|A popular Finnish folk-song, Oolannin sota (Crimean War), {{evolved from}} the earlier Ålandin sota laulu (Åland war song) which tells of the prisoners' capture and {{imprisonment}} in Lewes and {{is thought to have}} been written by one of the Lewes prisoners during his captivity. Stephen <b>Plaice</b> used the story as the inspiration for the libretto of an opera, The Finnish Prisoner, set to music by Orlando Gough and incorporating the song Oolannin sota. The opera received its world premiere in Lewes in 2007 under the direction of Susannah Waters with a cast of professional singers including members of the Finnish National Opera, a locally recruited amateur chorus, and a chorus of children. The production {{was the subject of a}} Finnish television programme which included material related to the memorial.|$|E
500|$|The {{book was}} from the first edition onwards {{illustrated}} {{with a large number}} of small woodcuts. Some show cookware, like the pot used to serve Bouillon or the [...] "Mackerel Kettle", a deep oval saucepan with a lid, used to cook fish; some illustrate produce as the housekeeper would see it in the market, like the engravings of poultry and fish—educating the reader in the recognition of gurnard, sea bream, <b>plaice,</b> grey mullet, garfish, and sand-eel; others show finished dishes, like the Lady's Tourte or a moulded jelly, [...] "tastefully garnished with preserved, or with fresh fruit." ...|$|E
500|$|Once the castle's deer {{park was}} established, intensively farmed fallow deer became common on the lands, {{although}} wild boar, foxes and hare were also hunted. Like other rural castles, {{the occupants of}} Okehampton Castle consumed a relatively large amount of venison, a prestige meat during the period. Some {{of this would have}} come from the surrounding deer park, but prime cuts of venison, such as the haunches, were also brought in specially from other locations. Excavations have shown that in addition to fish from large ponds in the park, Okehampton Castle also imported fish from the coast, over [...] away, with hake, herring, <b>plaice</b> and whiting being most commonly eaten.|$|E
2500|$|Major {{demersal}} {{fishery species}} in the North Sea such as cod, <b>plaice,</b> monkfish and sole, are listed by the ICES as [...] "outside safe biological limits." ...|$|E
2500|$|Joseph [...] "Joe" [...] <b>Plaice</b> is an {{able seaman}} and long-time {{follower}} of Aubrey, described as [...] "deeply stupid" [...] but an excellent hand in Post Captain. He is Barret Bonden's cousin. The medical procedure to relieve {{pressure on the}} brain, leaving a flattened coin {{in place of the}} bone removed is performed by Maturin upon both <b>Plaice</b> (in The Far Side of the World) and Mr Day, the gunner of HM Sloop Sophie (in Master and Commander), among others. He is aboard HMS Worcester and HMS Surprise in The Ionian Mission. Like Awkward Davies/Davis, <b>Plaice</b> is a character whose name seems to change over time: in Treason's Harbour, for example, Stephen Maturin refers to [...] "William Plaice," [...] a shipmate whom O'Brian had earlier described as [...] "an elderly forecastle hand"—the same terminology he has used in other contexts to describe Joe Plaice; either a manuscript error or Maturin making a rare error in the name of someone he knows. <b>Plaice</b> is part of the crew on HMS Surprise in The Far Side of the World and in The Letter of Marque on the private ship Surprise when they take the French frigate Diane. He was played in the 2003 [...] by George Innes. In the film, Stephen Maturin saves his life by performing brain surgery after he sustains a depressed skull fracture.|$|E
2500|$|In Denmark, Sweden and Norway, the French name pommes frites is {{used for}} fries. They {{are the most common}} form of {{potatoes}} when served together with breaded <b>plaice</b> (or certain other low fat fishes). When pommes frites are served with fish, remoulade and a lemon slice, the plate represents the typical Danish version of fish and chips.|$|E
2500|$|Demersal {{fish are}} white fish. Unlike oily fish, white fish contain oils {{only in their}} liver, {{rather than in the}} gut, and can {{therefore}} be gutted as soon as they are caught, on board the ship. White fish has dry and white flesh. They can be divided into benthopelagic fish (mostly [...] "round" [...] fish) which live near the sea bed, such as cod, and [...] benthic fish (flatfish) such as <b>plaice</b> which live on the sea bed. Benthic fish tend to be [...] "flat", so they can lie on the bottom.|$|E
2500|$|River {{estuaries}} form important staging {{points during}} {{the migration of}} anadromous and catadromus fish species, such as salmon and eels, giving them time to form social groups and {{to adjust to the}} changes in salinity. Salmon are anadromous, meaning they live in the sea but ascend rivers to spawn; eels are catadromous, living in rivers and streams, but returning to the sea to breed. Besides the species that migrate through estuaries, there are many other fish that use them as [...] "nursery grounds" [...] for spawning or as places young fish can feed and grow before moving elsewhere. For example, herring and <b>plaice</b> are two commercially important species that use the Thames Estuary for this purpose.|$|E
2500|$|Sole, {{along with}} the other major bottom-feeding fish in the North Sea such as cod, monkfish, and <b>plaice,</b> is listed by the ICES as [...] "outside safe {{biological}} limits." [...] Moreover, they are growing less quickly now and are rarely older than six years, although they can reach forty. World stocks of large predatory fish and large ground fish such as sole and flounder were estimated in 2003 to be only about 10% of pre-industrial levels. According to the World Wildlife Fund in 2006, [...] "of the nine sole stocks, seven are overfished with the status of the remaining two unknown." [...] Data is insufficient to assess the remaining stocks; however, landings for all stocks are at or near historical lows." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flatfish are {{an order}} of ray-finned benthic fishes which lie flat on the ocean floor. Examples are flounder, sole, turbot, <b>plaice,</b> and halibut. The adult fish of many species have both eyes {{on one side of}} the head. When the fish hatches, one eye is located on each side of its head. But as the fish grows from the larval stage, one eye migrates to the other side of the body as a process of metamorphosis. [...] The {{flatfish}} then changes its habits, and camouflages itself by lying on the bottom of the ocean floor with both eyes facing upwards. The side to which one eye migrates depends on the species; with some species both eyes are ultimately on the left side, whereas with other species the eyes are on the right.|$|E
2500|$|Original Hamburg {{dishes are}} Birnen, Bohnen und Speck (green beans cooked with pears and bacon), Aalsuppe (Hamburgisch Oolsupp) is often mistaken to be German for [...] "eel soup" [...] (Aal/Ool {{translated}} ‘eel’), {{but the name}} probably comes from the Low Saxon allns , meaning [...] "all", [...] "everything and the kitchen sink", not necessarily eel. Today eel is often included {{to meet the expectations}} of unsuspecting diners. There is Bratkartoffeln (pan-fried potato slices), Finkenwerder Scholle (Low Saxon Finkwarder Scholl, pan-fried <b>plaice),</b> Pannfisch (pan-fried fish with mustard sauce), Rote Grütze (Low Saxon Rode Grütt, related to Danish rødgrød, a type of summer pudding made mostly from berries and usually served with cream, like Danish rødgrød med fløde) and Labskaus (a mixture of corned beef, mashed potatoes and beetroot, a cousin of the Norwegian lapskaus and Liverpool's lobscouse, all offshoots off an old-time one-pot meal that used to be the main component of the common sailor's humdrum diet on the high seas).|$|E
2500|$|Grampus {{also needed}} to be {{seaworthy}} and fast, {{so as to be}} able to collect fish from European waters and bring back to the United States fish such as sole, turbot, <b>plaice,</b> and brill [...] which were important to the European commercial fishing industry but did not occur naturally in the waters off North America [...] so that they could be introduced into waters off the United States. Grampus also was to demonstrate the method of beam trawling used by European fishermen in the North Sea but not in the United States at the time to catch groundfish, and to spur the use of beam trawling by American commercial fishermen in the hope of increasing the monetary value of the American catch and to provide additional employment for men aboard American fishing vessels. The Fish Commission believed that groundfish species native to the waters off North America could be profitably fished even though they differed from the species found in European waters, and Grampus was to use beam trawling to test this idea.|$|E
2500|$|Barret Bonden is Aubrey's highly competent, {{highly valued}} coxswain. Bonden {{appears in the}} first book of the series, Master and Commander, as the coxswain and captain of the maintop in HM Sloop Sophie. He is {{described}} as [...] "a fine open-looking creature, tough without brutality, cheerful, perfectly in his place and, of course, a prime seaman - bred to the sea from childhood." [...] In this same novel, Aubrey asks Bonden {{to become a member}} of the quarter-deck, but Bonden declines, responding, [...] "I ain't got the learning, sir." [...] (p.275). Nevertheless, Bonden's obvious abilities and trustworthiness enable Aubrey to entrust him with many missions of his own, several of which involve looking after Maturin during Maturin's activities as an intelligence agent. He appears in The Ionian Mission and Treason's Harbour. Bonden also proves to be valuable in always taking care to get the perpetually clumsy doctor safely on and off ship. Maturin returns the favor by teaching Bonden how to read and write. Bonden, along with his cousin, Joe <b>Plaice,</b> follows Aubrey from ship to ship. He was killed in an engagement with a xebec in [...] "The Hundred Days". [...] In the 2003 , Bonden was portrayed by Billy Boyd.|$|E
2500|$|The statue is {{carved from}} red {{sandstone}} and is twice life-size, standing [...] high. [...] It weighs 1.25 tonnes {{and is the}} largest surviving medieval statue of St Christopher in Britain. The statue depicts StChristopher carrying Christ, as a child, on his left shoulder, walking through water that contains fish; the saint is wearing medieval clothes. [...] It {{does not have the}} full thickness of a statue and is rather a carving in relief, having a maximum depth of [...] [...] It was created in three pieces, one of which is now missing. [...] The main piece is the section above the saint's knees and it includes the Christ child. [...] The smaller piece is the base, consisting of the saint's lower legs and the river. [...] The missing piece would have fitted into a hollow on the saint's right side. [...] The right arm of the saint and the Christ child's right arm are missing. [...] It is likely that the Christ child's arm would have been raised in benediction, and the saint's arm would have carried a staff. [...] The Christ child's head is not original having been replaced in the 17thcentury. [...] There is a break running from the saint's forehead to below Christ's knee. [...] The details of the carving remain fine, with little weathering. [...] The depictions of the fish are sufficiently realistic for the species of all but one to be identified; the species identified are garfish, pike, mullet, carp or bream, and <b>plaice</b> or flounder. [...] Fragments of paint remain on the surface showing that the statue was originally brightly coloured, with a vermilion cloak, naturally coloured skin, and a grey beard. [...] Traces of wax are also present, some of them overlaid by particles of blue-green paint.|$|E
2500|$|St. Anthony's {{was erected}} in {{the thirteenth century}} (some time before 1254), in the heart of London on Threadneedle Street, atop the less than ideal site of a Jewish synagogue. [...] The chapel of St. Anthony's was built in 1310 without {{permission}} of the bishop of London. To prevents its degradation, the hospital petitioned for a chapel on the bishops terms. Unlike St. Giles, there was insufficient land at St. Anthony's, London, for recreation or food production. As a result, herbs or 'erbys' and vegetables had to be bought on a daily basis for consumption by the entire community. Accounts of foreign expenses at St. Anthony's also show the purchase of various spices, often with intrinsic medicinal qualities that could alter the level of heat and moisture within the body. Some of the spices bought include, saffron, cloves, ginger, cinnamon, lavender, pepper and mustard. Interestingly, the amount spent on herbs, produce, and spices were far surpassed by the amount spent on fish and meat. According to quarterly expenditure reports, fifty-eight percent of the quarterly budget was spent on meat, thirty-four percent on fish, three percent on pottage, two percent on dairy, one percent herbs and one percent on eggs. The unusually detailed records of diet and expenditures at St. Anthony's have revealed that the diet of the clerical establishment ('the hall') and the diets of the almsmen, patients and children ('the hospital') were quite different and class-based. During a typical week, [...] "the entire community shared dishes of pottage, veal, mutton and eggs; the hall alone consumed pork, ribs of roast beef, duck, fresh salmon and eels; and the hospital was supplied with mutton, <b>plaice</b> and haddock." [...] It is clear that the hall, or more wealthy, enjoyed extravagant meals of meat and fish, while the hospital, the patients and the poor, were fed simpler and cheaper food.|$|E
