50|$|The Embrace infant warmer is a {{low-cost}} solution that maintains premature and low-birth-weight babies’ body temperature, {{that would give}} premature infants a better chance at survival. A baby born two weeks premature lacks the ability to regulate its own body temperature. The child will likely die if not transferred to an incubator within an hour. With the Embrace Warmer, which is a specially designed polymer blanket, that vital time span becomes 4 hours. The infant warmer is <b>portable,</b> <b>safe,</b> reusable, and requires onlyintermittent access to electricity. Each baby warmer is priced at approximately $25.The Embrace development team won the fellowship at the Echoing Green competition in 2008 for this concept. Embrace also won the 2007-2008 Business Association of Stanford Entrepreneurial Students Social E-Challenge competition grand prize. At a ceremony at BAFTA in London on December 3rd 2013 Jane Chen, Linus Liang, Naganand Murty and Rahul Panicker won an innovation award from the Economist.

Although validated laboratory methods exist for TBW and extracellular volume, no evidence incontrovertibly demonstrates that any concentration measurement, including plasma osmolality (P osm), accurately represents TBW gain and loss during daily activities. Further, one blood or urine sample cannot validly represent fluctuating TBW and fluid compartments. Future research should (a) evaluate novel techniques that assess hydration in real time and are precise, accurate, reliable, non-invasive, <b>portable,</b> inexpensive, <b>safe,</b> and simple; and (b) clarify the relationship between P osm and TBW oscillations in various scenarios. Key teaching points: • All hydration assessment techniques provide singular measures of a complex and dynamic fluid matrix, containing interconnected compartments. • A single gold standard, including plasma osmolality, is not possible for all hydration assessment requirements. • In the laboratory, measurement resolution and accuracy are essential. • Field assessment of hydration requires techniques that are easy-to-use, <b>safe,</b> <b>portable,</b> and inexpensive. • Total body water approximates “euhydration ” when morning body weight is near the normal baseline, fluid intake is adequate, urine color is pale yellow, and urine volume is normal. • Body weight change provides the simplest and most accurate index of hydration status in real time, when serial measurements are made in close proximity...|$|R

The use of SS catheters has not been evaluated in comparison with perfused catheters in children. This study aims to compare data provided by SS and WP catheters in children undergoing colonic manometry studies. Methods A SS catheter and a WP catheter were taped together such that their corresponding sensors were at the same location. Simultaneous recordings were obtained using the SS and WP catheters (both 8 channels, 10 cm apart) in 15 children with severe defecation disorders referred for colonic manometry. Signals were recorded for a minimum of 1 h during fasting, 1 h after ingestion of a meal, and 1 h after the administration of bisacodyl. Solid-state signals from the data logger were analyzed against the perfused signals. All high-amplitude propagated contractions (HAPCs), the most recognizable and interpreted colonic motor event, were evaluated for spatial and temporal features including their durations, amplitudes, and propagation velocities. Key Results A total of 107 HAPCs were detected with SS and 91 with WP catheters. All WP-HAPC were also observed with SS. Linear regression analysis showed that SS catheters tended to give higher readings in the presence of amplitudes 102 mmHg. An opposite trend was found for the duration of contractions. No significant difference was found for HAPC velocity. Conclusions & Inferences SS catheters are more sensitive in recording HAPCs in children with defecation disorders compared with the more traditional WP assembly. There is a difference in measurements of amplitude between the two systems. Solid-state catheters offer potential advantages over WP catheters in children, being <b>portable,</b> <b>safer</b> to use, and may provide data over a more prolonged perio...|$|R

40|$|Collections of {{biological}} specimens are fundamental to scientific understanding and characterization of natural diversity - past, present and future. This paper presents {{a system for}} liberating useful information from physical collections by bringing specimens into the digital domain {{so they can be}} more readily shared, analyzed, annotated and compared. It focuses on insects and is strongly motivated by the desire to accelerate and augment current practices in insect taxonomy which predominantly use text, 2 D diagrams and images to describe and characterize species. While these traditional kinds of descriptions are informative and useful, they cannot cover insect specimens "from all angles" and precious specimens are still exchanged between researchers and collections for this reason. Furthermore, insects can be complex in structure and pose many challenges to computer vision systems. We present a new prototype for a practical, cost-effective system of off-the-shelf components to acquire natural-colour 3 D models of insects from around 3 mm to 30 mm in length. ("Natural-colour" is used to contrast with "false-colour", i. e., colour generated from, or applied to, gray-scale data post-acquisition.) Colour images are captured from different angles and focal depths using a digital single lens reflex (DSLR) camera rig and two-axis turntable. These 2 D images are processed into 3 D reconstructions using software based on a visual hull algorithm. The resulting models are compact (around 10 megabytes), afford excellent optical resolution, and can be readily embedded into documents and web pages, as well as viewed on mobile devices. The system is <b>portable,</b> <b>safe,</b> relatively affordable, and complements the sort of volumetric data that can be acquired by computed tomography. This system provides a new way to augment the description and documentation of insect species holotypes, reducing the need to handle or ship specimens. It opens up new opportunities to collect data for research, education, art, entertainment, biodiversity assessment and biosecurity control. © 2014 Nguyen et al...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to develop an understanding of the high strain rate response of High Performance Fiber Reinforced Cementitious Composites (HPFRCC). The research is divided into four parts. In the first, HPFRCC with high tensile strength (> 10 MPa) and ductility (> 0. 5 %) is developed by using slip hardening fibers within a high strength mortar. Two types of fibers, twisted and hooked, are used in volume fractions ranging from 1 to 2 %. The large slip capacity of twisted fibers during pullout generates large pullout energy (large equivalent bond strength), and thus leads to high strain capacity composites with multiple micro-cracks. In the second part, experiments are performed to investigate the effect of strain rate on fiber pullout and composite response. The rate sensitivity of HPFRCC in tension depends on fiber type, volume fraction and matrix strength (or composition). As the strain rate increases, HPFRCC with twisted fibers exhibits a pronounced, beneficial strain rate effect, i. e. a higher tensile strength is achieved with no reduction in strain capacity. In contrast, HPFRCC with hooked fiber show no clear strain rate effect. In the third part of this work, a new impact test system that employs suddenly released elastic strain energy is developed to enable impact testing for cementitious composites with large-sized specimen. A prototype system that was simulated and built is only 1. 5 m in height and can generate a high rate impact pulse. Compared to current impact test system, the new setup is inexpensive, small, <b>portable,</b> <b>safe</b> and easy to operate. Finally, the source of strength enhancement for cement-based materials under high rate compressive loadings was investigated through computational simulation models. The observed strain rate effect or mortar under compression is primarily, but not totally, due to lateral inertial effects under high rate loading and the pressure dependent nature of cementitious materials. The test and simulation results show {{that it is possible to}} develop a high performance cementitious composite with 1 % to 2 % volume fraction of fibers that has high energy absorption capacity and that can therefore be used to mitigate the effect of extreme loading such as earthquakes, impact, and blast...|$|E

40|$|Despite the {{prevalence}} of falls among people with multiple sclerosis (MS), there are very limited evidence-based treatment approaches for fall prevention among this population. Controlled whole-body vibration (CWBV) training has recently emerged as a new modality to train older adults to reduce their risk of falls primarily because it is <b>portable,</b> <b>safe,</b> easy to use, and cost-effective; and requires less intensive physical activity than traditional exercise-based methods. Nevertheless, {{there is a lack}} of evidence about the impact of CWBV training on reducing falls in people with MS. The primary purpose of this study was to examine if an 8 -week CWBV training protocol can reduce risk of falls in people with MS. Twenty-two individuals with MS (mean ± standard deviation age: 52. 0 ± 13. 7 y/o; body height: 166. 0 ± 9. 3 cm; body mass: 79. 5 ± 24. 4 kg; disease duration: 15. 5 ± 11. 1 y; Patient Determined Disability Step: 3. 7 ± 1. 9; 15 females) underwent the vibration training 3 times per week for 8 weeks while standing on a side alternating vibration platform with knees slightly bent. Each training session consisted of 5 repetitions of 1 -min vibration exposure followed by a 1 -min rest. The vibration frequency and amplitude were 20 Hz and 3. 6 mm, respectively. Their risk of falls was quantified by the isometric knee extensor muscle strength capacity (normalized to the body mass), the EquiScale body balance scale, and the functional mobility measured by the Timed-Up-and-Go (TUG) test. All risk factors were evaluated prior to (pre-training) and after (post-training) the 8 -week training. Paired t-tests were used to examine if the training improves these risk factors. Our results revealed that the knee extensor strength capacity on the weak side increased significantly form 0. 88 ± 0. 45 Nm/kg for the pre-training test to 1. 02 ± 0. 50 Nm/kg for the post-training test (p 3 ̆c 0. 001). Compared to pre-training values, there was a significant improvement at post-training for both body balance (11. 1 ± 4. 0 vs. 12. 7 ± 3. 2, p 3 ̆c 0. 001) and TUG (14. 8 ± 6. 6 vs. 13. 0 ± 5. 5 sec, p 3 ̆c 0. 01). The finding of this study suggested that an 8 -week CWBV training program can be well accepted by people with MS. Our results supported that CWBV intervention could reduce the risk of falls among individuals with MS by strengthening their lower limb muscles, improving the body balance, and enhancing the functional mobility. The clinical application of CWBV may reduce falls for individuals with MS; however, more systematic studies based on large sample sizes are needed to investigate the longitudinal effects of vibration training to prevent real-life falls among persons living with MS...|$|E
40|$|Background: Queensland {{has one of}} {{the highest}} rates of SUDI {{compared}} to other regions in Australia, while Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander are almost three times more likely to die than non-Indigenous infants. Many infant deaths amongst this population have been associated with co-sleeping environments, a common practice in Australia that has cultural significance for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families. The Pēpi-pod program is a health promotion initiative originating in New Zealand that draws attention away from problems for vulnerable babies in unsafe sleeping situations and focuses on a solution: support for parents and protection for the baby. The program encompasses a <b>portable</b> <b>safe</b> infant sleep space paired with a Safe Sleep educational program that has been adapted for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities. Support for health professionals through evidence-based safe sleep education and allocation of leadership roles within service teams aims to empower communities. Objectives: 1. How to identify safe sleep practices of families through empowering and providing staff with clear roles as Safe Sleep Champions in the communities they serve; 2. Share a novel approach, the Pēpi-pod Program, a safe sleep space combined within a targeted safe sleeping health promotion initiative for Queensland families with known risk factors for SUDI. Methods: This project aims to determine the acceptability, effectiveness, feasibility and sustainability of the Pēpi-pod Program in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander communities in Queensland (target n= 350 families). An exploratory descriptive design is used to evaluate and report parent and health worker experiences of the Pēpi-pod Program. Measures include family risk assessment, acceptability, safe sleeping awareness (effectiveness), and extent of social networking in communities using longitudinal data collection through timed repeated participant survey. Health worker capacity is measured through completion of key training components. Feasibility, sustainability, and community awareness will be measured through feedback from participating services and community representatives. Results: To date six sites providing maternity care to Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families across Queensland have undergone competency training and are implementing the Pēpi-pod Program in their respective communities. This presentation will review the success of the consultation and development undertaken for the Pēpi-pod Program and competency training and development of Safe Sleep Champions at participating sites. The three interlinked components of the Pēpi-pod program: Safe Space; Safe Care and Role of the Family will be discussed in relation to the process of empowering families and carers to provide for safe sleep, every sleep for their babies. The findings to date will also be presented. Conclusion: Positive outcomes have been reported for two consecutive years to date in the parent study and pilot results for the current study identified that the Pēpi-pod was acceptable as a portable sleep space for infants with positive responses relating to utilisation, acceptability, safety and convenience. The results from this larger cohort will determine if the Pēpi-pod Program influences health outcomes for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander families in Queensland and will inform future implementation of the program within this population...|$|E

The applets that run on these devices are frequently intended for use in critical, highly distributed, mobile conditions. They are required to be <b>portable</b> and <b>safe.</b> Often, {{the requirements of the}} application impose the use of dynamic, on-card verifications, but most of the research developed to improve safety of Java Card applets concentrates on static verification methods. This work presents a runtime verification approach based on Design by Contract to improve the safety of Java Card applications. To this end, we propose JCML (Java Card Modeling Language) a specification language derived from JML (Java Modeling Language) and its implementation: a compiler that generates runtime verification code. We also present some experiments and quality indicators...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the growing}} {{popularity}} of GPGPU programming, there is not yet a portable and formally-specified barrier that one can use to synchronise across workgroups. Moreover, the occupancy-bound execution model of GPUs breaks assumptions inherent in traditional software execution barriers, exposing them to deadlock. We present an occupancy discovery protocol that dynamically discovers a safe estimate of the occupancy for a given GPU and kernel, allowing for a starvation-free (and hence, deadlock-free) interworkgroup barrier by restricting the number of workgroups according to this estimate. We implement this idea by adapting an existing, previously non-portable, GPU interworkgroup barrier to use OpenCL 2. 0 atomic operations, and prove that the barrier meets its natural specification in terms of synchronisation. We assess the portability of our approach over eight GPUs spanning four vendors, comparing the performance of our method against alternative methods. Our key findings include: (1) the recall of our discovery protocol is nearly 100 %; (2) runtime comparisons vary substantially across GPUs and applications; and (3) our method provides <b>portable</b> and <b>safe</b> inter-workgroup synchronisation across the applications we study...|$|R
50|$|Electrical {{properties}} of tissues {{have been described}} since 1872. These properties were further described for {{a wider range of}} frequencies on a larger range of tissues, including those that were damaged or undergoing change after death. Thomasset conducted the original studies using electrical impedance measurements as an index of total body water (TBW), using two subcutaneously inserted needles. Hoffer et al. and Nyboer first introduced the four-surface electrode BIA technique. A disadvantage of surface electrodes is that a high current (800 μA) and high voltage must be utilized to decrease the instability of injected current related to cutaneous impedance (10 000 Ω/cm2). By the 1970s the foundations of BIA were established, including those that underpinned the relationships between the impedance and the body water content of the body. A variety of single frequency BIA analyzers then became commercially available, and by the 1990s, the market included several multi-frequency analyzers. The use of BIA as a bedside method has increased because the equipment is <b>portable</b> and <b>safe,</b> the procedure is simple and noninvasive, and the results are reproducible and rapidly obtained. More recently, segmental BIA has been developed to overcome inconsistencies between resistance (R) and body mass of the trunk.|$|R
40|$|Lower {{extremity}} stroke rehabilitation exhausts considerable {{health care}} resources, is labor intensive, and provides mostly qualitative metrics of patient recovery. To overcome these issues, robots can assist patients in physically manipulating their affected limb {{and measure the}} output motion. The robots that have been currently designed, however, provide assistance over a limited set of training motions, are not portable for in-home and in-clinic use, have high cost and may not provide sufficient safety or performance. This thesis proposes the idea of incorporating a mobile drive base into lower extremity rehabilitation robots to create a <b>portable,</b> inherently <b>safe</b> system that provides assistance {{over a wide range}} of training motions. A set of rehabilitative motion tasks were established and a six-degree-of-freedom (DOF) motion and force-sensing system was designed to meet high-power, large workspace, and affordability requirements. An admittance controller was implemented, and the feasibility of using this portable, low-cost system for movement assistance was shown through tests on a healthy individual. An improved version of the robot was then developed that added torque sensing and known joint elasticity for use in future clinical testing with a flexible-joint impedance controller...|$|R
