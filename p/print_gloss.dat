This work focuses on the significance of the structural factors of porous coatings on <b>print</b> <b>gloss</b> development in a systematic way to elucidate the governing mechanisms. The coating roughness, porosity, and pore size were the three experimental variables. Generation of well defined model coating structures was a challenge and required the appropriate combinations of pigment, binder, and calendering conditions. Calendering techniques with rough substrates (polyester films) were found to produce various rough surfaces without compromising pore structure. Pore structures were controlled during the calendering process by adjusting general calendering parameters. Mercury porosimetry with compressibility corrections was used to evaluate the pore structure of model coatings.

40|$|Flexographic {{printing}} is {{a process}} that employs a flexible printing form and low viscous ink, often water-based. The flexible printing form is favourable for printing on rough surfaces, but the high surface tension of the ink may cause printability problems. This work has focused on the interaction between paper/paperboard coating and water-based flexographic ink, aimed at increasing the knowledge about the printing process in form of physical/chemical parameters that are important for ink setting. The effects of printing conditions on print quality, such as printing pressure and temperature, have also been in focus. The work has shown that fluids of different polarities, i. e. different dipole moments, behave differently when being absorbed by a coating layer. Due to their chemical compatibility to the coating layer, fluids with large dipole moment fill the pore matrix of the coating to a lesser extent but penetrate further into the coating than fluids with small dipole moments. On the other hand, polarity of the coating layer also affects the print. When printing on coatings with different polarities, higher print densities was obtained on the more polar substrates. As a tentative explanation, it is proposed that the ink builds different layer structures during drying depending on the coating polarity. <b>Print</b> <b>gloss</b> is related to the ink setting which, in turn, is affected by the solvent retaining capacity of the ink. Large water holding capacity allows the ink components to smoothen out before the structure is set, resulting in a higher <b>print</b> <b>gloss.</b> The rheology of inks is affected by temperature; at a higher temperature the viscosity is reduced. The reduction in ink viscosity at higher temperature has been shown to affect the print quality, e. g., print density and dot gain. It is suggested that a thicker layer is immobilised during impression due to the lower viscosity and that it is an explanation of the higher print density at a higher printing temperature. The influence of impression pressure on dot gain has been experimentally evaluated and mathematically modelled with good agreement. The dot gain is shown to respond non-linearly to the applied printing pressure. Studies based on pilot coated and printed paperboards is also reported, and it is shown that the print quality, e. g. print density, <b>print</b> <b>gloss</b> and dot gain, is largely dependent on the type of ink chosen and on the coating characteristics.

40|$|Some of the {{advantageous}} {{characteristics of}} ultra violet ink {{are said to}} be the absence of pollution and reasonable energy consumption as well as rapid drying (curing). Little is published about physical properties or print quality. Printers require information in this regard because the reports which are presently available are not clear and lack in detail. If the printability of UV inks were equal to that of conventional offset ink, this ink would be close to an ideal ink. This work was under taken so as to compare the properties of ultraviolet ink with conventional offset ink. The inks selected for study were black sheet-fed offset. One type of ultraviolet ink and a similar type of conventional offset ink were used for comparison. Comparisons were made as to tack, specific gravity, density, printing sharpness, slur, resolution, gloss and dot gain. Since it was learned that the ultra violet ink rendered a lower print density than conventional offset ink when using the same amount of ink, the on-press experiment was performed in order to: 1. Compare both inks at equal solid ink density. 2. Compare both inks under equal press conditions. All variables applied to both inks were the same {{in order to make the}} conditions as similar as possible. The experimental results indicated that the tack of ultraviolet ink at 400 rpm. 90 F was about the same as the tack of conventional offset ink during the first two minutes, but with increased time, the tack of ultraviolet ink increased more rapidly. The misting and flying of both inks were judged to be equal at 400 rpm. 2 ̆ 7 The specific gravity of UV ink was higher than conventional offset ink and the optical density was shown to be lower when using the same amount of ink. This experimental result indicated that more volume and more weight of UV ink had to be used to produce an optical density equal to conventional offset ink. At equal solid ink density, UV ink had much more dot gain than conventional ink at both low and high ink film thickness. The two inks were significantly different in terms of printing sharpness, slur, resolution and <b>gloss.</b> <b>Printing</b> sharpness, resolution and gloss were significantly effected by changing ink film thickness. The conventional offset ink provided better <b>printing</b> sharpness, <b>gloss,</b> resolution and less slur than UV ink at both low and high ink levels, with the exception that the slur values were approximately equal at low ink level. At equal press conditions (unequal solid ink density), the dot gain of the two inks was not much different. But it was obvious that the more ink film thickness or density, the more dot gain with UV ink. The two inks were significantly different in <b>printing</b> sharpness and <b>gloss</b> but not significantly different in slur and resolution. The change in ink film thickness affected <b>printing</b> sharpness, <b>gloss</b> and resolution.

40|$|Striping is {{the most}} common print {{non-uniformity}} on corrugated board. It is defined as periodic print density and/or <b>print</b> <b>gloss</b> variations parallel to the flutes. Corrugated boards are mainly printed with flexography, making striping a major concern for the flexographic post-printing industry. In spite of its long history, the basic mechanisms of striping have not been fully understood, and no concrete solution has been provided. The objective of this thesis is to obtain an understanding of the fundamental mechanisms behind and a solution to striping. Both experimental and numerical approaches have been taken in thiswork. Nonlinear finite element models have been constructed in both corrugated board and halftone dot scales to determine the pressure distributions in the printing nip. Ink transfer experiments have been performed to determine the print density vs. pressure relations. Parametric studies have been done for the effects of printing system variables and deformations. The results showed that striping is predominantly print density variations caused by pressure variations in the printing nip. The pressure variations are inherent to the corrugated board structure. Washboarding was shown to play a minor part in causing print density variations, but might contribute to gloss striping. A new printing plate design has been proposed to eliminate the pressure variations and hence the print density striping...|$|E

The selected coating was prepared from cellulose nanocrystals suspension that was derived from cellulose fibrils on the laboratory scale. The coating formulation examined in this paper was not yet used on the industrial scale. Experimental research was carried out in the form of preliminary laboratory tests for offset printing application using IGT test methods of ink transfer and set-off. Paper coated with cellulose nanocrystals was used as a printing substrate, while vegetable oil-based ink was used as a printing ink in order to stay in line with environmentally preferred choice of printing materials.

40|$|The ever rising {{need for}} {{detailed}} {{knowledge of the}} structure of paper coating urges the improvement and development of new techniques for gaining new and valuable information. The assessment, study and characterisation of factors that are assumed to affect the interaction between printing inks and coated paper surface may be accomplished by microscopy and image analysis techniques. The scanning electron microscope (SEM) is a most suitable tool for morphometrical studies of fibres and paper. Digital images acquired in a SEM, by the secondary electron imaging (SEI) or backscattered electron imaging (BEI) mode have suitable quality and resolution for further image processing and analysis. The present study exemplifies how microscopy and image analysis may be applied for structural studies of the coating layer. Image processing and analysis routines for acquiring information on the coating layer surface roughness and porosity details like the pore shape, size and orientation are described. A routine, based on the Sobel operators, for measuring the pigment particle orientation, is also described. The developed semi-automatic image analysis routines are useful methods for morphometric analysis of paper structure details, thus facilitating numerical data acquisition of the pores and the pigment particles’ geometry. Parts of the obtained information is assumed to be unattainable by other methods at this point. To discern the binder in the coating layer from the embedding epoxy and thus observe individual pores in the coating, the binder has to be stained before embedding. In the study, osmium tetroxide (O s O 4) was used to stain the latex binder in the coating layer. Morphometric analyses of paper cross-sections using SEM, BEI-mode images and stereo images were used to quantify the paper coating structure details. The smallest details to be quantified are approaching the limitations given by the imaging methods. It is shown that the staining procedures allow a quite accurate determination of pore fraction in the coating, and individual readings of the pores like pore area, aspect ratio and orientation. Two compared staining methods differed somewhat in their effect on the paper. O s O 4 dissolved in water gave good staining throughout the base paper/coating sandwich, allowing good visualisation and assessment of the coating structure. However, moisture tends to make the base paper fibre expand, raising the paper thickness and thus the macro-roughness. When staining by dry O s O 4 crystals, the base paper expansion is avoided, however, even the staining of the fibres is reduced. Critical coating parameters like mean pore area and micro-roughness of the coating layer do not differ between the two methods. In the study, the structure of commercial LWC paper coating layers were assessed and quantified by SEM, BEI-mode and digital image analysis of cross sections. It is quantified how clay particles cause a more densely packed coating structure compared to coatings containing mainly CaCO 3. The pores of clay coatings have a larger aspect ratio and are oriented more parallel to the paper surface. Pore orientation is affected by the pigment particle orientation. Besides the size of the pores, their orientation is proved to be an essential parameter affecting the achieved <b>print</b> <b>gloss</b> level for a given paper grade. The pore’s orientation/ diameter ratio seems to be a suitable parameter for describing its geometry and influence on <b>print</b> <b>gloss.</b> For a given pore diameter, the more horizontally oriented, the higher the delta gloss (print gloss-paper gloss). dr. ing. dr. ing...|$|E

Current trends show {{increased interest in}} printing fine art books on digital presses. It is necessary to understand {{the extent to which}} digital printing systems are capable of accurately rendering fine-art reproductions. This research analyzed paper properties that maximize image quality and preference for digitally printed fine art reproductions. Four images, representing four art media, were printed on twelve papers using two digital presses. The twelve papers represented different combinations of color, print-show-through, roughness and gloss. A psychophysical experiment was conducted in which observers ranked the twelve papers for each image on the basis of image quality, color rendering quality, and surface appearance quality. The results were analyzed and a model was developed to predict the probability that a paper was ranked in the top three. Paper color (coolness), basis weight, roughness, and gloss were model parameters. Unlike gloss, roughness, and print-show-through, there was no previous metric for quantifying coolness. Therefore, an additional experiment was conducted to develop a model to predict the perception of coolness using colorimetry. An alternative experiment model was also developed that included parameters such as caliper, <b>print</b> <b>gloss,</b> line raggedness, and dot circularity. The resulting models allowed for the optimization of paper parameters that maximize the probability a paper will produce preferred and high quality images. It was concluded that the probability a book was judged as having high image quality was optimized for papers with high coolness, low roughness and low gloss. Neither print show-through, line raggedness, nor mottle were significant factors. An additional lexical analysis was performed for observer descriptions of their ranking behavior. This analysis provided complementary data to the psychophysical results.

40|$|This licentiate thesis {{comprises}} {{two parallel}} studies dealing with water-based flexographic inks on PE-coated liquid packaging board. The commercial waterbased inks {{that were used}} in both studies vary in type of pigment and acrylatepolymer vehicle, and in pigment/vehicle mixing proportions. One vehicle is solely based on emulsion polymer, another contains solution polymer, and the third is a 50 / 50 blend of these two. The first study presents results from characterisation of a matrix of these water-based inks with respect to their rheology, surface tension and wetting of PE-coated board. The rheological properties were measured over a wide range of shear rates relevant to various stages in the printing process. All inks represent shear thinning fluids, forming thixotropic structures. The plastic viscosity and yield stress are shown to increase strongly with content of solution polymers (at comparable solids contents). Measurements of static surface tension and drop spreading, on untreated as well as corona treated board, clearly display differences in interfacial properties for the vehicles. An increasing amount of solution polymer give lower surface tension values, while the equilibrium contact angles increase. The validity of a simple model for expressing the ink drop spreading dynamics was tested and could be applied to spreading on treated board. The rheology, surface tension and wetting properties are also shown to depend on the pigment type (cyan or black) in the ink and on the pigment/vehicle mixing proportion. In the second study, the print performance of this matrix of inks on the PE-coated board was evaluated. Changes in the ink formulation are shown to have significant influence on the ink amount transferred to the board and the print quality parameters. The 50 / 50 intermediate vehicle consistently gave the highest ink amounts, although the highest print density generally was obtained with the vehicle containing most solution polymer. High contents of solution polymer also resulted in more uniform prints and high <b>print</b> <b>gloss.</b> Mottling was most severe with the vehicle containing solely emulsion polymers.

During investigation, prints of graphic elements printed by direct and indirect thermographic methods, digital and offset printing were used. Papers with different temperature sensitivity, surface morphology and hydrophobic properties were used for the specimens printing. It was show that thermographically produced specimens, subjected to temperature changes under mechanical wear, showed a different optical density decrease. The highest optical density decrease (from 2. 05 to 0. 30) was noticed in the element printed on COAT PC paper by indirect thermographic method, using Wax ink transfer ribbon. The prints on PP White paper, using Wax ink transfer ribbon, also showed significant decrease of wear resistance. In this case the print quality did not meet the standard requirements. The prints on PP White paper, using resin-based ink transfer ribbon, got wear much less (the optical density changed from 1. 71 to 1. 43, thus meeting the standard requirements).

The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a method and analytical protocol that can be used for calibration of a micro-goniophotometer. There are many reasons to do this, such as being able to measure material properties of printed images to help further the study of <b>printed</b> image <b>gloss.</b> The micro-goniophotometer is a device that measures this gloss, or specular reflection. It does this through the use of Fresnel’s laws and two polarizers. This is done by polarizing the incident light and reflected light. Three experiments were conducted for the calibration of the micro-goniophotometer. The first experimental procedure that happened was finding a reference material that will satisfy the parameters of the micro-goniophotometer. The cylinder of the micro-goniophotometer system can vary in diameter. By changing the diameter at which the sample under measurement is curved, it changes the angular resolution in the horizontal direction. A reference material needs to be found that can be used across many cylinder diameters and still not have much trouble with the integration of its measured BRDF curve. The second experiment that has been conducted is t...|$|R
