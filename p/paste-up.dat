2500|$|In 1972, Wolfman {{moved to}} Marvel Comics as a protégé of then-editor Roy Thomas. When Thomas stepped down, Wolfman {{eventually}} {{took over as}} editor, initially {{in charge of the}} publisher's black-and-white magazines, then finally the color line of comics. Wolfman said in 1981 that, [...] "Marvel never gave [...] full commitment to" [...] the black-and-white line. [...] "No one wanted to commit themselves to the staff." [...] He added, [...] "We used to farm the books out to Harry Chester Studios [...] and whatever they pasted up, they pasted up. I formed the first production staff, hired the first layout people, <b>paste-up</b> people." [...] Wolfman stepped down as editor-in-chief in order to spend more time writing.|$|E

50|$|Since most early {{phototypesetting}} machines {{can only}} create one column of type at a time, long galleys of type were pasted onto layout boards {{in order to}} create a full page of text for magazines and newsletters. <b>Paste-up</b> artists played an important role in creating production art. Later phototypesetters have multiple column features that allow the typesetter to save <b>paste-up</b> time.|$|E

5000|$|Much of the {{variance}} and incoherence of early newspapers was because last minute corrections were exclusively handled by typesetters. With photographic printing process, typesetting gave way to <b>paste-up,</b> whereby columns of type were printed by machines (phototypesetters) on high-resolution film for <b>paste-up</b> on photographed final prints. These prints in turn were [...] "shot to negative" [...] with a large format production camera [...] - directly to steel-emulsion photographic plates.|$|E

50|$|Van Ray's {{career began}} with public {{graffiti}} {{at the end}} of the 90s when he started using his art to communicate with the general public and to demonstrate social criticism. His works were based on various techniques (including stencils, stickers, <b>paste-ups,</b> and sculptures) and meant to express his view of Western society.|$|R
50|$|Though <b>paste-up</b> {{put an end}} to {{cumbersome}} typesetting, {{this still}} required planned layouts and set column widths. Photographic plates are (still) wrapped on printing drums to directly apply ink to newsprint (paper).In the mid-1990s, the <b>paste-up</b> process gave way to the direct to plate process, where computer-paginated files were optically transmitted directly to the photographic plate. Replacing several in-between steps in newspaper production, direct to plate pagination allowed for much more flexibility and precision than before. Designers today still used column grid layouts only with layout software, such as Adobe InDesign or Quark.|$|E
50|$|In this system, a final <b>paste-up</b> {{that needed}} no further changes or {{additions}} {{was ready to}} be photographed by the process camera and subsequently printed. This final document was camera-ready.|$|E
50|$|Another, yet {{less common}} form of Undenk's street-bound {{activism}} are stencils and graffitis, also in form of collaborations with other street- and graffiti-artists. In recent times, apparently home-made <b>paste-up</b> posters have been seen in various editions, numbers and designs.|$|E
50|$|In recent years, {{the use of}} <b>paste-ups</b> {{has been}} {{steadily}} replaced by desktop publishing software, which allows users to create entire document layouts on the computer. In the meantime, many printers now use technology to take these digital files and create printing plates from them without use of a camera and negative. Despite this, the term camera-ready continues {{to be used to}} signify that a document is ready to be made into a printing plate.|$|R
50|$|Born in Cambridge, Marderosian {{grew up in}} Newton, MA. He {{says that}} he started drawing when he was seven years old, after his parents took him to see Pinocchio. After high school Marderosian worked for {{advertising}} agencies and an art supply company, where he prepared <b>paste-ups</b> and mechanicals for catalogs. He also drew cartoons and comic strips and freelanced for a few magazines at the same time. In 1979, Marderosian enrolled at Massachusetts College of Art.|$|R
50|$|Born in London, Markow was a New Yorker {{from the}} age of two. He took art courses at the High School of Commerce (later Louis D. Brandeis High School), where he drew for the school magazine.

He later studied drawing and painting at the Art Students League.|$|R

50|$|At the age {{of twelve}} Maja's {{interest}} towards drawing was triggered by his babysitter's boyfriend, a graffiti artist. In the years that followed, Maja learned how to master urban canvases, developing a good sense of space which is reflected in his illustrations and drawings. Between 1998 and 2008, Helsinki had a zero tolerance policy in regards to street art, enforced with private security contractors. In this atmosphere many artists, including Maja, needed to develop both stealth and methods to create pieces quickly - stickers, stencils and <b>paste-ups.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 1941 Lee {{had been}} made the editor of Timely Comics, the future Marvel Comics, a {{division}} of a publishing company owned by a relative, Martin Goodman. Lieber began working for Goodman as an art assistant on the magazine side, [...] "doing <b>paste-ups....</b> I was working {{during the day and}} I went to Pratt Institute the evening." [...] There Lieber began illustrating comic books; his first known credit is penciling and inking the four-page story crime comics story [...] "Cop on the Beat", by an unknown writer, in All True Crime #44 (cover-dated May 1951).|$|R
5000|$|Rat was {{published}} {{during a period}} of layout innovation and had a dramatic look of jumbled letters and strong imagery. Stat camera reproduction of <b>paste-ups</b> composed of often [...] "swiped" [...] graphic elements, and letraset type, were fast and affordable. Contributing designers included Van Howell and Joe Schenkman. This largely forgotten period of innovation in communication is remembered for its association with period (mainly punk) music graphics and concert flyers, and for many campus publications and activist flyers. It is somewhat similar to the later desktop publishing revolution.|$|R
5000|$|In the mid-1920s, rotary presses {{came into}} use for {{printing}} stamps which used long rolls of paper rather than individual sheets, and this made the <b>paste-up</b> phase unnecessary, as sheets of any length could {{be produced by}} the press and merely needed to be cut into strips.|$|E

40|$|As an {{independent}} visual expression, street art won {{its position in}} urban culture {{at the beginning of}} the 1990 s. Different techniques used to present ideas, such as spraying, stencilling, putting up stickers or <b>paste-ups,</b> doing site specific interventions and so on, allowed artists to develop them more carefully and with a particular sense of the public space. Since 2008 and Lewisohn’s study Street Art; The Graffiti Revolution, street art has been the subject of academic research on many occasions. However, the issue of cute/kawaii features in street art has not yet been the subject of extensive research. This paper attempts to find out in what kind of relation within street art discourse we can place the aesthetic concepts of beauty and that of cute/kawaii, and whether a trend of producing cute/kawaii street art can be identified. Concepts of Western cute and Japanese kawaii will be compared, and the relationship between the concept of cute/kawaii and that of beauty will be addressed. Seen trough different aesthetic theories an effort is made to understand the relation between these two opposing and yet today very close concepts. There is also the question of a possible natural affection on the part of the viewers for the small and cute things, which we can usually find in stickers and <b>paste-ups.</b> As a result this study raises a broader question: to what extent is cute/kawaii aesthetics taking over the place of beauty in street art...|$|R
5000|$|In the old days, {{virtually}} every comics company {{had a big}} room where all the artists and writers sat together, creating their works of four-color wonder. Creative folks generally being the garrulous sort, typically, {{quite a bit of}} 'bull' got tossed around these legendary rooms, so the nickname 'bullpen' was a natural.... At any rate, these days, most comics artists and writers prefer to work in their own studios, but, still, here at Marvel, we have a big room, a production bullpen, where all of our art/production people work doing our <b>paste-ups,</b> lettering corrections, art corrections, and such — and even though the editorial folks are bunched in small offices off to the sides we still refer to the whole shebang as the Marvel Bullpen. It's a tradition dating back to the days when we actually were a one-room operation! ...|$|R
5000|$|Guesswho (or Guess Who) is an {{anonymous}} graffiti artist active since 2012 in Fort Kochi, Kerala, India. Guesswho uses street {{art as a}} subversive medium of expression to practice {{and participate in the}} creation of an ever-changing culture of a city’s visual landscape and experiments through wry commentary on socio-political issues. The artist(s)'s <b>paste-ups</b> and stencils have been cited in Trivandrum and Bangalore as well. [...] One news paper reported that Guesswho said his work was in part a reaction to the Kochi-Muziris Biennale, which he said restricted which artists were publicly showcased. However, in interview to another newspaper, the artist(s) has commended Kochin Biennalle's role in popularizing art in Indian art space. Guesswho clarifies in another interview that the work should be termed as a 'reaction' to Biennale, not a protest. [...] According to The Hindu, his work has [...] "gone viral" [...] since it was featured on the Internet.|$|R
50|$|Phototypesetting {{was invented}} in 1945; after {{keyboard}} input, characters were shot one-by-one onto a photographic negative, which could then {{be sent to the}} print shop directly, or shot onto photographic paper for <b>paste-up.</b> These machines became increasingly sophisticated, with computer-driven models able to store text on magnetic tape.|$|E
50|$|Some {{designers}} {{dispute that}} computers enhance the creative process.

(Steranko's 1981 Outland adaptation, in fact, constituted Bruzenak's first professional lettering job.) In the end, Bruzenak worked for Steranko for almost thirteen years.|$|E
40|$|Dryad Press had {{its origins}} in Dryad magazine, a {{literary}} journal co-founded by Merrill Leffler and Neil Lehrman in 1967 in the Washington, D. C., area. In 1974, the press published the first book bearing its imprint and has since published over sixty works, primarily volumes of poetry, which often have Jewish themes or subjects. Many of the authors published by Dryad {{are associated with the}} state of Maryland, by birth, education, or current residence. Much of the collection consists of correspondence with authors as well as with individuals and institutions involved in the publication and promotion of literary works. Major correspondents include Rod Jellema, Neil Lehrman, Myra Sklarew, Herman Taube and Paul Zimmer. Additionally, the collection includes manuscripts, proofs, printers' specifications, mock-ups, <b>paste-ups,</b> bluelines, galleys, and typescripts; photographs, slides, and negatives; reviews, articles, and clippings; brochures, flyers, and posters; financial statements, bills, invoices, receipts, and address lists; as well as copies of the actual publications of the press...|$|R

"Evaline Ness Papers" [...] at the Free Library of Philadelphia is a {{collection}} of work [...] "for the books Coll and His White Pig, The Truthful Harp, The Black Cauldron, The Castle of Llyr, Taran Wanderer, The High King, and Old Mother Hubbard and Her Dog. According to that archive, This collection contains dummies, sketches, <b>paste-ups,</b> preliminary and finished artwork, and color separations for eight books illustrated by Evaline Ness. [...] "Evaline Ness Papers" [...] at the University of Southern Mississippi is two boxes of material from her illustrations of four stories written by other authors, published 1965 to 1975.According to that archive,Because printer's ink is flat, Ness' constant concern was how to get texture into that flatness. The primary challenge in illustrating children's books, she believed, was how to maintain freedom within limitation. Some of the techniques she has used to combat these limitations include woodcut, serigraphy, rubber-roller technique, ink splattering, and sometimes spitting.|$|R
5000|$|Marvel's only staffers at {{that time}} were Lee and Steinberg herself, {{with the rest of}} the work handled freelance. [...] De facto {{production}} manager Sol Brodsky [...] "would come in and set up an extra little drawing board where he would do the <b>paste-ups</b> and mechanicals for the ads," [...] Seinberg said.. She recalled that the [...] "first real Bullpen" [...] — the roomful of artists at drawing boards making corrections, preparing art for printing, and, as envisioned later within Marvel's letter pages and [...] "Bullpen Bulletins", a mythologized clubhouse in which the likes of Lee, Jack Kirby, Steve Ditko, Don Heck and others would be found kibitzing — was created when Marvel moved downtown a few buildings from 655 Madison Avenue to 635 Madison Avenue. [...] "Stan finally had his own office. There was a big space with windows where I was, and Sol Brodsky, now on staff, had his own desk". She said that at the time, [...] "You were lucky to make $60 a week starting ... and Stan offered me $65, which was a big incentive to sign on!".|$|R
