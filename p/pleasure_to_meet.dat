According to a teammate, O'Mullane's reputation as a first-rate boxer was enough to dissuade the opposition from getting into melees with his club. Harrison remembered O'Mullane as a strong, but good-tempered player, and stated that [...] "it was a <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> him on the football field—even when the meeting was shoulder to shoulder, and you happened to get the trifle worst of it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In {{his final}} public {{statement}} Heath {{paid tribute to}} James Callaghan who died on 26 March 2005, saying [...] "James Callaghan was a major fixture in the political life of this country during his long and varied career. When in opposition he never hesitated to put firmly his party's case. When in office he took a smoother approach towards his supporters and opponents alike. Although he left the House of Commons in 1987 he continued to follow political life {{and it was always}} a <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> with him. We have lost a major figure from our political landscape".|$|E
2500|$|It {{was also}} claimed that one Sunday Liddell {{refereed}} a hockey match {{to stop fighting}} amongst the players, as he was trusted not to take sides. One of his fellow internees, Norman Cliff, later {{wrote a book about}} his experiences in the camp called [...] "The Courtyard of the Happy Way" [...] (Chinese 樂道院, also translated as [...] "The Campus of Loving Truth"), which detailed the remarkable characters in the camp. Cliff described Liddell as [...] "the finest Christian gentleman it has been my <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet.</b> In {{all the time in the}} camp, I never heard him say a bad word about anybody". Langdon Gilkey, who also survived the camp and became a prominent theologian in his native America, said of Liddell: [...] "Often in an evening I would see him bent over a chessboard or a model boat, or directing some sort of square dance– absorbed, weary and interested, pouring all of himself into this effort to capture the imagination of these penned-up youths. He was overflowing with good humour and love for life, and with enthusiasm and charm. It is rare indeed that a person has the good fortune to meet a saint, but he came as close to it as anyone I have ever known." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Mortlockese Language is an Austronesian {{language}} spoken {{primarily on the}} Mortlock islands in Micronesia. In Mortlock culture, there is a hierarchy with chiefs called samwool. When speaking to these chiefs or to anyone of higher status, one must use honorifics (in Mortlockese called kapas pwéteete or kapas amáfel) in order to convey respect. In the Mortlockese Language, {{there are only two}} levels of speaking - common language and respectful language(honorifics). While respectful language is used when speaking to people of higher status, common language is used when speaking to anyone of the same or lesser status. One example showing the difference between respectful and common language {{can be seen in the}} word sleep. The word for sleep using common language is maúr while the word for sleep using respectful language is saipash. Along with the respectful language, there are formal greetings called tiirou or fairo that are used in meetings and gatherings. In English, some examples of formal greetings would be [...] "good evening" [...] or [...] "it's a <b>pleasure</b> <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> you" [...] or [...] "how are you." [...] These formal greetings not only use words, but also gestures. It is the combination of the words and gestures that create the tiirou or fairo(formal greeting). In English a formal greeting like this would be like saying [...] "nice to meet you" [...] while offering a handshake.|$|E

In this paper, {{we examine the}} contribution of Freire for the Brazilian education, taking {{as a starting point}} his speech signals, denouncing the ¿collapse¿ of education that the working masses was undergoing due to the manipulation Manichean discourse of oligarchic power, disguised as ¿gifts¿ and paternalistic welfare, who seduced and sometimes condemned the ¿ostracism¿ socioeconomic, political and cultural. At the same time, score a few constructions of Freirian verve of neologism, which, in the semantic-conceptual load, contribute to specify certain situations analyzed by the thinker from Pernambuco. These creations support the thesis that Freire did not create words <b>to</b> <b>pleasure,</b> but was <b>to</b> <b>meet</b> a significant unmet need for vocabulary spelling in order to further reading of the world. From this perspective, it points to the semantic rigor of the theoretical and conceptual apparatus in the speech that expresses his sociopolitical and philosophical thought, becomes explicit and discusses how this accuracy is expressed in the written text, establishing the relationship between semantics and pedagogy to explain the expressive charge of his speech...|$|R
