Starting with {{critical}} questions from ERA, exposure scenarios (first for non target organisms, later for all other <b>partitions</b> of the <b>ERA)</b> were to be designed and potential monitoring characters ought to be identified. This was meant to facilitate the identification of potential CSM approach. Consideration was focussed on potatoes and wheat. Relevant pathways of plant-organism interactions through nutrients, toxins or mechanisms of attraction and defence were reviewed. The employment of CSM was reconsidered, taking into account variability among existing potato and wheat varieties, respectively, and environmental conditions. |$|R
50|$|The current Lithuania-Poland border {{has existed}} since the {{re-establishment}} {{of the independence}} of Lithuania on March 11, 1991. Until then the identical border was between Poland and Lithuanian SSR of the Soviet Union. That border {{was established in the}} aftermath of World War II. Until then the identical border was between Poland and Lithuanian SSR of the Soviet Union. A different border existed between the Second Polish Republic and Lithuania in the period of 1918-1939. Following the Polish-Lithuanian border conflict, from 1922 onward it was stable, and had a length of 521 km. During the <b>partitions</b> of Poland <b>era,</b> there were borders between the Congress Poland (Augustów Voivodeship) and the Lithuanian lands of the Russian Empire (Kovno Governorate and Vilna Governorate). From the Union of Lublin (1569) to the partitions, there was no Polish-Lithuanian border, as both countries were a part of a single federated entity, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth. In the medieval times, Kingdom of Poland and Grand Duchy of Lithuania shared yet another border.|$|R
40|$|The suffix tree is a data {{structure}} for indexing strings. It {{is used in}} a variety of applications such as bioinformatics, time series analysis, clustering, text editing and data compression. However, when the string and the resulting suffix tree are too large to fit into the main memory, most existing construction algorithms become very inefficient. This paper presents a disk-based suffix tree construction method, called Elastic Range (ERa), which works efficiently with very long strings that are much larger than the available memory. <b>ERa</b> <b>partitions</b> the tree construction process horizontally and vertically and minimizes I/Os by dynamically adjusting the horizontal partitions independently for each vertical partition, based on the evolving shape of the tree and the available memory. Where appropriate, ERa also groups vertical partitions together to amortize the I/O cost. We developed a serial version; a parallel version for sharedmemory and shared-disk multi-core systems; and a parallel version for shared-nothing architectures. ERa indexes the entire human genome in 19 minutes on an ordinary desktop computer. For comparison, the fastest existing method needs 15 minutes using 1024 CPUs on an IBM BlueGene supercomputer. 1...|$|R

The master plan of the cantonment is a planned grid like network of roads. It was one of the few cantonments which was established post <b>partition</b> <b>era.</b> It was constructed to station US troops in Pakistan, a plan which was partly reversed because of the U2 spy plane crash scandal.

In {{response to this}} prejudice Dr Muhammad Hussain bought agricultural land in the outskirts of Lahore on the canal Bank and hired professionals to plan a housing scheme, that was initially named as Islamabad. However, on the suggestion of his friend Dr. Allama Muhammad Iqbal, Dr. Hussain decided to rename the housing scheme as Muslim Town to emphasize its Muslim character {{in response to the}} exclusivity of Model Town as a Non Muslim locality in pre <b>partition</b> <b>era.</b> Dr. Hussain, initially built a house for himself on 40 kanals of this land at No 7 Muslim Town and donated plots of varied sizes ranging from 10 marlas to 12 kanals to his numerous relatives, friends, family retainers and household help. Some of his famous friends and early settlers included the renowned artist Ustad Allah Baksh, Abdul Majeed Salik (writer), Maulana Ghulam Rasool Mehr, Maulana Muhammad Ali (Translator of Holy Quran), the Faruqi family and the renowned Faqir family. Dr Muhammad Hussain constructed a mosque in Muslim Town ( [...] Aisha Masjid) in memory of his late mother. He also allocated land for a graveyard for his descendants in Shah Jamal and another graveyard in Muslim Town for the benefit of general public. The Shah Jamal graveyard is under the exclusive custodianship of his great grand daughter (by orders of honorable Lahore High Court).Dr Muhammad Hussain's agricultural land around Old Muslim Town was later acquired by Lahore Development Authority as part of Shah Jamal, Gulberg and New Muslim Town Schemes.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe eigensystem {{realization}} algorithm (ERA) {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular methods in civil engineering applications for estimating the modal parameters, including complex-valued modal frequencies and modal vectors, of dynamic systems. In dealing with noisy measurement data, the <b>ERA</b> <b>partitions</b> the realized model into principal (signal) and perturbational (noise) portions so that the noise portion can be disregarded. During the separation of signal and noise, a critical issue is the determination for the dimensions of the block Hankel matrix which is built from noisy measurement data. We show that the signal and noise matrices can be better separated when the number of blockrows and number of block-columns of the corresponding block Hankel matrix are chosen to be close to each other. We introduce the concept of using the Frobenius norm (L 2 -norm) of the signal and noise matrices to quantify the signal to noise ratio in the global sense (involving multiple signals). We also propose a verification procedure to justify that the estimated modal parameters are noise insensitive and thus indeed associated with the true system. The procedure involves artificially injecting random noise into the measured signals (which are noisy signals) to create noisy-noisy signals, then comparing the identification results obtained respectively from the measured and noisynoisy signals. Using experimental data collected from a test plate, we demonstrate that if signal and noise portions have been properly separated while using the measured data, then the artificial noise would almost completely accumulate to the noise portion. Therefore, the modal estimation based on the signal portion only would remain the same by using either the measured or the noisy-noisy signals...|$|R
5000|$|Singh {{was persuaded}} by Jawaharlal Nehru {{to set aside}} his {{memories}} of the <b>Partition</b> <b>era</b> to race successfully in 1960 against Abdul Khaliq in Pakistan, where a post-race comment by the then General Ayub Khan led to him acquiring the nickname of The Flying Sikh. Some sources say that he set a world record of 45.8 seconds in France, shortly before the Rome Olympics {{in the same year}} but the official report of the Games lists the record holder as Lou Jones, who ran 45.2 at Los Angeles in 1956. At those Olympics, he was involved in a close-run final race in the 400m competition, where he was placed fourth. Singh had beaten all the leading contenders other than Otis Davis, and a medal had been anticipated because of his good form. However, he made an error when leading the race at 250m, slowing down in the belief that his pace could not be sustained and looking round at his fellow competitors. Singh believes that these errors caused him to lose his medal opportunity and they are his [...] "worst memory". Davis, Carl Kaufmann and Malcolm Spence all passed him, and a photo-finish resulted. Davis and Kaufman were both timed at a world-record breaking 44.9 seconds, while Spence and Singh went under the pre-Games Olympic record of 45.9 seconds, set in 1952 by George Rhoden and Herb McKenley, with times of 45.5 and 45.6 seconds, respectively. The Age noted in 2006 that [...] "Milkha Singh is the only Indian to have broken an Olympic track record. Unfortunately he was the fourth man {{to do so in the}} same race" [...] but the official Olympic report notes that Davis had already equalled the Rhoden/McKenley Olympic record in the quarter-finals and surpassed it with a time of 45.5 seconds in the semi-finals.|$|E
