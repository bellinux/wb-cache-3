25|$|Open {{adoption}} allows {{identifying information}} to be communicated between adoptive and biological parents and, perhaps, interaction between kin and the adopted person. Rarely, it is the outgrowth of laws that maintain an adoptee's right to unaltered birth certificates and/or adoption records, but such access is not universal (it is possible in a few jurisdictions—including the UK and six states in the United States). Open adoption can be an informal arrangement subject to termination by adoptive <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> sole authority over the child. In some jurisdictions, the biological and adoptive parents may enter into a legally enforceable and binding agreement concerning visitation, exchange of information, or other interaction regarding the child.

Hunter {{receives}} information about the whereabouts of his parents, which inevitably lead him to Canada. There he finds his father, Daniel Niall, and discovers that his mother died just before Yule, when he was training Morgan. Hunter soon discovers that his father is talking to his mother (who is dead) using a Bith Dearc which is the use of what {{is considered to be a}} form of dark magick, against the wishes of Hunter's mother. Hunter must attempt to stop his father from doing this, while investigating a witch by the name of Justine Courceau, a witch collecting the true names of other witches, on the order of the International Council of Witches. He ends up kissing her, and then is faced with the fact that he has to tell Morgan about it.|$|E

She wrote, [...] "Beginning readers and <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> been helping them through the dreary activities of Dick and Jane and other primer characters are due for a happy surprise." [...] Helen Adams Masten of the Saturday Review called the book Geisel's tour de force and wrote, [...] "Parents and teachers will bless Mr. Geisel for this amusing reader with its ridiculous and lively drawings, for their {{children are going to}} have the exciting experience of learning that they can read after all."

500|$|Although {{she hears}} nothing from Milda after their night together, she still expects to reunite with her dream man shortly, so she breaks off with Tonda, who storms the {{dormitory}} demanding his ring back. After {{listening to a}} speech by the housemother on the virtues of fidelity and commitment, she packs up her suitcase and arrives on Milda's doorstep in the big city, ready to resume their romance. Milda is not home, and she meets his <b>parents,</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> never heard of her and don't know {{what they should do}} with her. Milda comes home very late, and after an evening of comically painful tension and uncertainty, his parents decide it's only decent to put the girl up for the night on the sofa, requiring Milda to climb into bed with them in order to avoid any appearance of impropriety. Forman has described this famous scene: [...] "It’s a tight fit. The old man wants to sleep; the son would like to get thrown out so he can join the girl on the couch, but the mother runs the show and won’t tolerate any such filthy ideas under her roof." [...] Andula, kneeling outside the door of their bedroom, overhears the family squabbling, and when it becomes clear to her that she is not valued in the least, she breaks down in tears and, the next morning, returns to her home. She tells her friends about her [...] "wonderful" [...] trip to the capital and how nice Milda's parents were to her, especially his father, and then she returns to work at the factory.|$|E
500|$|Stevie is {{the privately}} educated {{daughter}} of rich <b>parents,</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> abandoned {{her to go}} travelling. [...] She {{is said to be}} clueless about real life, with her profile on the official E20 website describing her as generous, creative and unlucky in love, though she has a boyfriend. Although she is described as posh, Fairbank-Hynes said Stevie is not just like a posh girl in East London, but would be out of place anywhere as she is in her own world. Fairbank-Hynes opined that posh characters in Walford stand out and can bring comedy to the show. Stevie is very naive and, according to Fairbank-Hynes, [...] "away with the fairies"—the most naive person anyone could meet. However, writer Emer Kenny was worried that Stevie being [...] "away with the fairies" [...] would make her unrealistic, but said that Fairbank-Hynes made the character recognisable. Because of Stevie's naivety and her kind nature, people see this as an invitation to take advantage of her. Stevie does not understand why people are cruel to her because she sees the good in them and wants to look after them, be around people and mother them. Fairbank-Hynes commented, [...] "Stevie's {{the type of person who}} thinks a stranger is a friend she hasn't met yet". However, Stevie is very forward, which can scare people away. She is also creative, empathetic and a complete daydreamer who lacks common sense but has bursts of assertiveness and intelligence, which can surprise people. Thompson said that Stevie has a good balance as she can be ditzy but also quite smart. Fairbank-Hynes identified with the character's mad outbursts, innocence and daydreaming, and also said Stevie is quirky, lovely and eccentric. Her daydreaming can lead people to believe she is a bimbo, but she is not.|$|E

500|$|Giving {{can be done}} {{in several}} ways. Some laypeople offer food, others offer robes and supplies, and others fund ceremonies, build monasteries or persuade a {{relative}} to ordain as a monk. Young people often temporary ordain as monks, because they believe this will not only yield fruits of merit for themselves, but also for their <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> allowed them to ordain. In China, Thailand and India, it used to be common to offer land or the first harvest to a monastery. Also, more socially oriented activities such as building a hospital or bridge, or giving to the poor are included in the Tipiṭaka, and by many Buddhists considered meritorious. In fieldwork studies done by researchers, devotees appreciated the merits of becoming ordained and supporting the building of a temple the most. Fisher found that building a temple was considered a great merit by devotees, because they believed they would in that way have part in all the wisdom which would be taught at that temple. People may pursue merit-making for different reasons, as Buddhist orthodoxy allows for various ideals, this-worldy or ultimate. Although many scholars have pointed out that devotees often aim for this-worldly benefits in merit-making, it has also been pointed out that in old age, people tend to make merit with a view on the next life and liberation. Among lay people, women tend to engage in merit-making more than men, and this may be a way for them to enhance empowerment. Very often, merit-making is done as a group, and it is believed that such shared merit-making will cause people to be born together in next lives. This belief holds for families, friends, communities and even the country as a whole. In some cases, merit-making took the form of a community-wide competition, in which different donors tried to outdo each other to prove their generosity and social status. This was the case during merit-making festivals in nineteenth-century Thailand. In modern Thailand, businesses and politicians often make merit to improve their public image and increase confidence among customers or voters. In Burma, lay devotees form associations to engage in merit-making as a community. People were so intent on merit-making and giving, that in some societies, people would even offer [...] and their family to a Buddhist temple, as one high-ranking minister did in the ancient Pagan Kingdom (ninth until fourteenth century Burma). On a similar note, in Sri Lanka, kings and commoners would offer slaves to the temple, and then donate money to pay for their freedom, that way accruing two merits at once. Even more symbolically, kings would sometimes offer their kingdom to a temple, which, returned the gift immediately, together with some Dhamma teaching. Also in Sri Lanka, King Mahakuli Mahatissa disguised himself as a peasant and started to earn his living working on a paddy field, so {{he would be able to}} gain more merit by working himself to obtain resources to give to Buddhist monks. In some cases, merit-making was even continued after a person's death: in ancient Thai tradition, it was considered meritorious for people to dedicate their corpses to feed the wild animals after death.|$|E
500|$|The Fourteenth Amendment {{provides}} that children {{born in the}} United States become American citizens regardless of the citizenship of their parents. At {{the time of the}} amendment's passage, three Senators, including Trumbull,Mr. Cowan: [...] "I will ask whether it will not have the effect of naturalizing the children of Chinese and Gypsies born in this country?"Mr. Trumbull: [...] "Undoubtedly."...Mr. Trumbull: [...] "I understand that under the naturalization laws the children who are born here of <b>parents</b> <b>who</b> <b>have</b> not been naturalized are citizens. This is the law, as I understand it, at the present time. Is not the child born in this country of German parents a citizen? I am afraid we have got very few citizens in some of the counties of good old Pennsylvania if the children born of German parents are not citizens."Mr. Cowan: [...] "The honorable Senator assumes that which is not the fact. The children of German parents are citizens; but Germans are not Chinese; Germans are not Australians, nor Hottentots, nor anything of the kind. That is the fallacy of his argument."Mr. Trumbull: [...] "If the Senator from Pennsylvania will show me in the law any distinction made between the children of German parents and the children of Asiatic parents, I may be able to appreciate the point which he makes; but the law makes no such distinction; and the child of an Asiatic is just as much of a citizen as the child of a European." [...] the author of the Civil Rights Act, as well as President Andrew Johnson, asserted that both the Civil Rights Act and the Fourteenth Amendment would confer citizenship on such children at birth; however, Senator Edgar Cowan of Pennsylvania had a definitively contrary opinion.Mr. Cowan: [...] "...Therefore I think, before we assert broadly that everybody who shall be born in the United States shall be taken to be citizen of the United States, we ought to exclude others besides Indians not taxed, because I look upon Indians not taxed as being much less dangerous and much less pestiferous to a society than I look upon Gypsies. I do not know how many my honorable friend from California looks upon Chinese, but I do know how some of his fellow citizens regard them. I have no doubt that now they are useful, and I have no doubt that within proper restraints, allowing that State and the other Pacific States to manage them as they may see fit, they may be useful; but I would not tie their hands by the Constitution of the United States so as to prevent them hereafter from dealing with them as in their wisdom they see fit..."Mr. Johnson: [...] "...Who is a citizen of the United States is an open question. The decision of the courts and doctrine of the commentators is, that every man who is a citizen of the State becomes ipso facto a citizen of the United States; but there is no definition as to how citizenship can exist in the United States except through the medium of a citizenship in a State..." [...] These congressional remarks applied to non-citizens lawfully present in the United States, as the problem of unauthorized immigration did not exist in 1866, and some scholars dispute whether the Citizenship Clause applies to unauthorized immigrants, although {{the law of the land}} continues to be based on the standard interpretation. Congress during the 21st century has occasionally discussed revising the clause to reduce the practice of [...] "birth tourism", in which a pregnant foreign national gives birth in the United States for purposes of the child's citizenship.|$|E
