500|$|The lyrical style varies {{depending}} on culture, denomination, and country. For example, in Northern Europe the bands with Lutheran members usually prefer a personal lyrical approach, which is seldom meant to [...] "convert" [...] in an aggressive manner, since evangelism has been more typical among American bands. Christian bands never deny their conviction but typically avoid preaching, and sometimes the matter is left unexpressed, leaving religion as a <b>private</b> <b>issue</b> of the listener. Certain bands choose to deal with everyday life experiences from a Christian perspective in order to draw both Christian and non-Christian listeners. In such cases, identifying a [...] "Christian band" [...] can be difficult. Secular bands that occasionally deal with Christian topics are a different matter altogether. Defining a Christian band is a much debated issue on Christian metal forums. A Christian band {{is expected to have}} either professed Christian members or a Christian message, preferably both.|$|E

This {{can be done by}} defining sophisticated investors as those who meet the stringent participation requirements of the private equity market. Our results show <b>private</b> equity <b>issuing</b> firms overstate their earnings in the quarter preceding private equity placement announcements and that sophisticated investors do not ask for a fair discount when purchasing the shares of the <b>private</b> <b>issuing</b> firms. We also find evidence showing that the reversal of the effects of pre-issue earnings management is a significant determinant of the long-term performance of <b>private</b> <b>issues.</b> Results further show that post-issue stock performance and operating performance of firms using "aggressive" earnings management significantly underperform those using more "conservative" earnings management.

The descent is easy down the wall into the ditch; and so, once more farewell, until I see thee again, my dear son.” And with this the intrepid father mounted the buffet with great agility and briskness, stepped across the window, lifting up the bars and {{framework}} again from the other side, and only leaving room for Harry Esmond to stand on tiptoe and kiss his hand before the casement closed, the bars fixing as firm as ever seemingly in the stone arch overhead.

In fact, the industry rival reaction for nonhigh-tech firms is significantly negative during bear markets only, while it is significantly positive during bull markets.
