40|$|We have {{investigated}} {{a mathematical model}} {{of the process of}} activation of the X chromosomes in eutherian mammals. The model assumes that the activation is brought about over some definite time interval T by the complete saturation of N receptor sites on an X chromosome by M <b>activating</b> <b>molecules</b> (or multiples of M). The probability λ of a first hit on the receptor site is considered to be very much lower than that of subsequent hits; that is, we assume strong co-operative binding. Assuming further that an incomplete saturation of receptor sites is malfunctional, we can show that for proper activation of X chromosomes in normal diploid males and females, we must have λMT ≥ 3 and 0 · 96 ≤ N/M ≤ 1. An extension of this analysis for the triploid cases shows that under these conditions, we cannot explain the activation of two X's if the number of <b>activating</b> <b>molecules</b> is fixed at M. This suggests that there must be two classes of triploid embryos differing from each other in a step-wise manner in the number of <b>activating</b> <b>molecules.</b> In other words, triploids with two active X chromosomes would require 2 M <b>activating</b> <b>molecules</b> as opposed to M molecules in triploids with a single active X.

40|$|The {{development}} of light-controlled molecular tools for in situ regulation of biological activity holds great promise e. g. for resolving dynamic aspects of cellular signal transduction and to overcome inherent pharmaceutic limitations such as poor drug selectivity. In this thesis, photoswitchable {{molecules from the}} spiropyran, dithienylethene, and azobenzene families {{as well as an}} o-nitrobenzyl-type caged compound were used in a variety of constellations intended for biological use. The presented research ranges from spectroscopic studies on isolated molecular interactions in solution to photoactivated kinase inhibition in live zebrafish. The first part of this thesis focuses on novel approaches for photocontrolled drug release, based on a supramolecular competitive binding methodology. Two host-guest systems were investigated for this purpose; a dithienylehtene – porphyrin dimer, and a spiropyran – cucurbit[7]uril (CB 7) system. In the first investigated system, it was found that drug release could be reversibly controlled by light. The spectral properties of the release scaffold also provided a fluorescence-based reporting function. In the second system, an unexpected loss of spiropyran bistability was observed upon complexation to CB 7. Also, the undesired hydrolysis of the spiropyran photoswitch was completely halted when bound to the macrocycle. The spiropyran hydrolysis reaction was further examined in a separate study, also included in this thesis. The second and thirds parts focus on photocontrolled small-molecules introduced to living systems. This includes a study on the cytotoxic properties of a DNA-binding spiropyran in live human cancer cells. It was demonstrated how cell-death could be selectively triggered by photoisomerizing the spiropyran to the merocyanine form inside the cells. Part three focuses on photocontrolled inhibition of the, for cancer highly relevant, REarranged during Transfection (RET) kinase. An azobenzenederived photoswitch and an o-benzyl-type caged inhibitor based on the pyrazolopyrimidine scaffold were developed and evaluated. Both compounds exhibited light-controlled RET inhibition in an isolated enzyme- and live cell assay. The caged compound was also used to <b>photonically</b> <b>activate</b> inhibition of RET in live zebrafish, confirming uptake and decaging of the compound inside the live organism...|$|R

40|$|Soon after Dennison had deduced {{from the}} specific-heat curve that {{ordinary}} hydrogen gas {{consists of a}} mixture of two types of molecule, the so called ortho and para hydrogen, a similar state of affairs {{in the case of}} iodine gas was demonstrated by direct experiment by R. W. Wood and F. W. Loomis (1). In brief, these experimenters found that the iodine bands observed in fluorescence stimulated by white light differ from those in the fluorescence excited by the green mercury line λ 5461, which happens to coincide with one of the iodine absorption lines. Half of the lines are missing in the latter case, only those being present which are due to transitions in which the rotational quantum number of the upper state is an even integer. In other words, in the fluorescence spectrum excited by λ 5461 only those lines appear which are due to what we may provisionally call the "ortho" type of iodine molecule. It is evident than that by irradiating iodine gas with the green mercury line it is possible to selectively <b>activate</b> <b>molecules</b> of the "ortho" type. Furthermore, as shown by these experiments, a molecule of the "ortho" type has an average life time in this form longer than the time it remains in the activated condition before emitting radiation.
