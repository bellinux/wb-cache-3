40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the changes in nutritional quality of <b>protein</b> <b>in</b> stored UHT milk. Commercial fresh and recombine ultra high temperature (FUHT and RUHT respectively) treated milk samples were used. Pasteurized milk (P-milk) samples were used for comparison. Milk samples were freeze-dried for the use in diet formulation. Pasteurized milk samples were freeze-dried within 24 h of production. FUHT and RUHT milk samples were freeze-dried after production (zero time). 3 and 6 months of storage at 37 ºC. Three nitrogen balance experiments were done at zero time, after 3 and 6 months of storage. The diet used in all experiments were similar in composition except for <b>protein</b> source. <b>In</b> each experiment egg white (low protein), casein (control, P-milk, and either 0, 3 or 6 months old FUHT and RUHT milk samples were used as the source of <b>protein</b> <b>in</b> the diets. In each experiment 30 (six for each diet) male Sprague-Dawley rats were used. Apparent digestibility (AD), true digestibility (TD), biological value (BV), and net protein utilization (NPU) were calculated for <b>protein</b> <b>in</b> casein and all milk samples. The nutritional quality of <b>protein</b> <b>in</b> FUHT milk before storage was similar to that of <b>protein</b> <b>in</b> pasteurized milk, but it decreased during storage for 3 months and then remained at the same quality up to 6 months of storage. BV and NPU of <b>protein</b> <b>in</b> FUHT milk after storage for 3 and 6 months were lower than that of <b>protein</b> <b>in</b> pasteurized milk by 4 % (not significant) and 5 % respectively. On the other hand, the nutritional quality of protein FUHT milk before storage was lower than that of <b>protein</b> <b>in</b> pasteurized milk and remained at the same level after storage for 3 months: however, it decreased significantly after storage for 3 months: however, it decreased significantly after storage for 6 months. AD and TD of <b>protein</b> <b>in</b> RUHT milk stored for 6 months were lower that that of <b>protein</b> <b>in</b> pasteurized milk by 5 % and BV and NPU were lower than that of <b>protein</b> <b>in</b> pasteurized milk 9 and 12 % respectively.
