In electrical installations with fre-quency converters various frequency and also direct earth fault current can occur. Most of re-sidual current devices cannot operate if direct earth current flows thus protection against elec-tric shock is not effective. Only few residual current devices operate in these circumstances. In circuits with frequency converters transient and steady state leakage current can occur as well. This influences residual current devices selection. If residual current devices are im-properly selected and installed, their unwanted tripping occurs {{even if there is}} no risk of elec-tric shock.

40|$|The {{worldwide}} {{global market}} requires electrical engineers {{to have a}} deep understanding of the bonding and earthing practices adopted in different countries around the world. This knowledge {{is essential to obtain}} effective designs and high safety standards and can promote the elimination of technical obstacles that can still create market barriers. The full comprehension of the "grounding" theory requires the command of key technical concepts regarding the earthing methods, which may cause confusion when used in the North American technical realm rather than in the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC) world. This issue is further worsened by the lack of literature in this matter, as well as of harmonization documents between national codes and international standards. This paper, by analyzing the <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>contact</b> in ac (50 / 60 -Hz) low-voltage power systems by automatic disconnection of supply, seeks to clarify both the terminologies and each type of grounding system adopted in IEC standards, with the intent to create a common reference for practicing engineers in the matter of bonding and earthing of power systems.

Street lighting systems typically include low-voltage loads, distributed in a large area, and are collectively protected by the same device. Under fault conditions, hazardous potentials may appear on the metal enclosures of these systems, and expose people to shock hazards. To reduce the risk to an acceptable level, different solutions for the bonding and grounding are available. The Standard IEC 60364 and a current worldwide tendency seem to {{encourage the use of}} Class II equipment for the street light systems.

40|$|Premio {{best paper}} award IEEE An IEC main <b>protection</b> <b>against</b> {{electric}} hazards by shock or burns or fire is the “active” measure. It {{is based on}} preventing {{the persistence of the}} electrical hazards limiting the time duration of the risk exposure to the contact for shock and fire and to the fault consequences. The active protection of detecting the hazardous fault and disconnecting automatically the supply is named in the paper “π-protection” to highlight the characteristic profile of the risk exposure. For studying the near miss incidents, complying with the Heinrich theory, characteristic parameters are introduced that allow dealing with the various classes of the “π -protection” like with dynamical collision problems. Considering the components of an electric hazard like massparticles in motion, the protection practice in IEC standards solves:- avoiding the “collision”, limiting the fault exposure time (probable protection);- controlling the “collision”, limiting the risk “weight” (safe conventional protection) or at the least limiting the colliding time (additional protection). In particular, the IEC approach recognizes the “π -protection”: - <b>against</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>contact,</b> coordinated with grounding, as acceptable, considering improbable the simultaneous operator contact (probable protection), and more as safe, if the limited exposure time guarantees also the prospective touch voltage lower than the safe admissible value (conventional <b>protection),</b> - <b>against</b> direct contact with the supply voltage to ground, as an additional protection (no-guaranteed safe), in spite of using residual current devices RCD up to 30 mA.

40|$|In the {{classical}} {{model of the}} photovoltaic (PV) cell/module, based on the single-exponential or double-exponential representation of PV cell/module behavior, parasitic parameters are ignored. Their presence, however, has multiple effects, such as the {{maximum power point tracking}} on the current-voltage curve, the switching ON/OFF of the inverters for grid connection, and the electrical safety of persons <b>against</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>contact</b> due to ground leakage currents and lightning phenomena. The effects of parasitic parameters can be visualized in the experimental results gathered through the transient charge of an external capacitor connected to the PV generator terminals. The impact of the parasitic components is different when considering a single PV module or a PV array composed of several PV modules. At the module scale, an oscillation occurs in the initial part of the current waveform, which indicates the presence of some inductive components. At the array scale, the inductive phenomena are overdamped, and parasitic capacitive effects become predominant. This paper shows how to determine the parameters of an extended model of PV modules embedding the parasitic parameter effects. It starts from the experimental results obtained from the fast-sampled voltage and current waveforms during the transient charge of an external capacitor. Numerical examples taken from real cases with different PV technologies are provided...|$|R

40|$|International (IEC) European (CENELEC) and American (NEC) Standards require, in each building, the {{connection}} of extraneous conductive parts (i. e. metal water or gas pipes) to the main grounding terminal. There are two good reasons for this: the voltage between extraneous conductive parts and exposed conductive parts is zeroed and extraneous conductive parts {{can contribute to the}} leakage of fault current into the ground. There is however a third advantage in the bonding connection: the entire structure (floors and walls of the building), together with the exposed and the extraneous metallic parts, forms a quasi-equipotential system, with the consequent strong reduction of touch voltages. Metallic pipes and reinforcement of reinforced concrete have a particular relevance thanks to their large widespread through buildings. However, in some practical cases, {{it is not possible to}} connect all extraneous conductive parts to the protective equipotential bonding because they are not accessible. In the paper, the reduction of touch voltages in buildings, when these extraneous conductive parts are present but not connected to the protective equipotential bonding is quantified. Different building models are created and solved by the finite element method in order to calculate touch voltages in different scenarios. The results show that the mere presence of widespread metallic parts in buildings helps to reduce touch voltages, but not enough to ensure safety <b>against</b> <b>indirect</b> <b>contacts.</b> The electrical installation safety performance is greatly improved in reinforced concrete buildings if at least some easily accessible parts, like water or central heating pipes, are connected to the main grounding terminal.
