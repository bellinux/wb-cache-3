At the same time there is also pressure to increase world trade in potatoes. Such pressure has to be balanced by the risks involved in the associated spread of these pests and subsequent problems in management. Populations of the <b>potato</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> from outside Europe, in particular South America, which is considered the origin of G. pallida and G. rostochiensis, pose a risk to those European countries where limited genetic variability of these nematode species has been recorded. The development and usage of resistant cultivars under such conditions has formed a pivotal role in integrated management programmes in Europe. Molecular studies have shown that populations of G. pallida and G. rostochiensis from South America have a different genetic composition from those in Europe. The introduction of such populations would pose a threat to the use of resistant cultivars as a major tool in reducing the potential spread and damage caused by these species. At present, an inability to link precisely genetic variability to the virulence characteristics of a specific nematode population, and quickly identify the virulence status of intercepted populations for inspection purposes, strengthens the case for using plant health legislation to prevent their introduction...|$|R

The interest of the islands for epidemiological studies is based on the occurrence of the oldest potato crops in the Old World and the use of several local cultivars and traditional management cropping systems.

The phytonematological problems of the potato crop on the Canary Islands is reported and the absence of Ditylenchus destructor, D. dipsaci, Nacobbus aberrans, Rotylenchulus reniformis and trichodorids pointed out. The <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes,</b> Globodera rostochiensis and G. pallida were found to cause severe damage to the crop and were studied in detail by field trials at Tenerife.

50|$|The {{speed of}} {{spread of the}} {{nematodes}} from field to field can be reduced by cleaning equipment of possibly infested soil before changing location and by using only certified PCN-free seed tubers. If possible, ask for seed potatoes grown on fields which were declared free of the <b>potato</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> using an AMI-intensive soil sampling scheme (currently only available in The Netherlands). Pesticides can be used, {{but they will not}} get a field free of nematodes. They will increase yields and are only profitable at high population densities, when the financial profit of the extra yield will surpass the cost of the pesticide application. Crop rotation with at least 6 years between planting of a susceptible crop is an effective means to reduce nematode population densities to below damage threshold. However, the best way to manage potato cyst nematodes is the use of (partial) resistant potato varieties. During the last 10 years a number of varieties have been developed which can keep both <b>potato</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematode</b> species below damage and detection threshold, without the use of pesticides.

40|$|The <b>potato</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> (PCN) Globodera pallida and G. rostochiensis {{are major}} pests of potatoes. The G. pallida (and G. rostochiensis) life cycle {{includes}} both diapause and quiescent stages. Nematodes in dormancy (diapause or quiescent) are adapted for long-term survival {{and are more}} resistant to nematicides. This study analysed the mechanisms underlying diapause and quiescence. The effects of several compounds (8 Br-cGMP, oxotremorine and atropine) on the activation of hatching were studied. The measurements of some morphometric parameters in diapaused and quiescent eggs after exposure to PRD revealed differences in dorsal gland length, subventral gland length and dorsal gland nucleolus. In addition, the expression of 2 effectors (IVg 9 and cellulase) was not induced in diapaused eggs in water or PRD, while expression was slightly induced in quiescent eggs. Finally, we performed a comparative study to identify orthologues of C. elegans diapause related genes in plant-parasitic nematodes (G. pallida, Meloidogyne incognita, M. hapla and Bursaphelenchus xylophilus). This analysis suggested {{that it was not}} possible to identify G. pallida orthologues of the majority of C. elegans genes involved in the control of dauer formation.

40|$|Plant {{parasitic}} nematodes {{associated with}} potato feed on roots and/or tubers. About 70 species, representing 24 genera, {{have been reported}} from potato. Since nematodes attack underground plant parts, there are no reliable foliar symptoms to show that nematodes may be the major cause of poor growth and reduced tuber yields. Potato roots damaged by nematodes may show lesions, abnormal proliferation of lateral roots, emerging white females and brown <b>cysts.</b> <b>Nematode</b> attacks may render plants vulnerable to other pathogens, so disease caused by microorganisms may have nematodes as an etiological component. Therefore, nematode damage may often {{have been attributed to}} other factors. In Scandinavia, <b>potato</b> <b>cyst</b> <b>nematodes</b> (Globodera rostochiensis and Globodera pallida) are by far the most important nematodes on potato.

Other important nematodes include root lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus spp.), stubby root nematodes (Trichodorus spp. and Paratrichodorus spp.), and potato rot and stem nematodes (Ditylenchus spp.). Root knot nematode Meloidogyne hapla is considered less important. Meloidogyne chitwoodi and Meloidogyne fallax are not known to be present in Nordic countries. In the control, crop rotations using non-host crops, alternating susceptible and resistant potato cultivars, are an important control measure.
