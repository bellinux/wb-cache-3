In a research project funded by the Electrical Contracting Foundation, several alternative WC systems were identified and analyzed. Unfortunately, some of the most efficient WC systems identified by the research are statutorily forbidden in most U. S. states. The performance of several alternative dispute resolution (ADR) programs was analyzed; but only in the state of Maryland was quantified data successfully procured from both the state and a functioning, independent ADR program. Worker benefits under traditional and ADR WC programs are analyzed using administrative data from the State of Maryland. Direct comparisons of benefits between the two programs indicate that the levels of benefits and the probability of receiving benefits are lower under the ADR program.

40|$|The {{workplace}} {{has evolved}} {{dramatically in the}} past decades. Technology has improved, innovative ways of utilising nuclear power have been developed, new chemicals have been introduced to {{the market and the}} adverse effects of other chemicals on both human health and safety and the environment have been discovered. This has influenced the nature of the workplace itself. While employees enjoy a common law right to a safe working environment and health and safety, state intervention currently provides restricted claims to an employee who has sustained injuries or contracted occupational diseases. This thesis explores the effect of section 35 of the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act 130 of 1993 which deprives an employee of its common law right to institute civil action against an employer for an injury sustained or disease contracted during the course and scope of employment. Furthermore, this thesis also explores the marriage between the Occupational Health and Safety Act 89 of 1993 and the Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act 130 of 1993 as well as the position of ‘employee’ and ‘employer’ insofar as the scope and application of these two acts are concerned with specific reference to the position of labour broker employees.

40|$|The thesis {{presents}} the main aspects {{connected with the}} knock-for-knock clauses used in the offshore sector and focus on how these provisions are treated in the United States (US) and Norwegian legal systems. The knock-for-knock agreements are very often used in the offshore business but despite of the wide application of those formulas, the particular mutual <b>indemnity</b> <b>clauses</b> may be interpreted differently in various countries – it concerns especially their enforceability {{in the case of}} gross negligence/wilful misconduct of one party. If a responsibility regulation includes a full exemption from liability for tortfeasor even in the case of his gross negligence or intentional act, this may come into conflict with the principles like fairness and reasonableness. This problem is the main issue analysed in this thesis where the various censorship in the US and Norwegian legal system are presented together with the various arguments that are submitted in their favour. Norway and the US were chosen, because these two countries have nowadays very strong position in the offshore business and they have developed specific solutions concerning enforceability of mutual hold harmless clauses. At the beginning, the short introduction concerning relevant tort and insurance law is given since these two branches of law are closely connected with the problem of knock-for-knock agreements. 	Then, the general characteristic of the knock-for-knock clauses is presented. In this part, the general rules concerning construction of mutual hold harmless formulas as well as indemnity and insurance issues are discussed. 	Afterwards, {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} such provisions are presented. 	In the last two chapters the enforceability of the knock-for-knock provisions in the US and Norway are analysed in detail. In the context of the US legal regime the main focus is put on the different solutions included in the anti-indemnity statutes in Texas and Louisiana since law of these two states will apply the most often to the offshore contracts in the US waters and the very specific limitations concerning the knock-for-knock agreements are included in their anti-indemnity statutes. In the Norwegian context the main problem is the enforceability of knock-for-knock clauses in the context of general contract law. In this part the enforceability of the mutual hold harmless provisions is analysed with reference to the NL 5 - 1 - 2 and the Norwegian Contract Act section 36...|$|R
5000|$|In 1970, President Richard Nixon {{created the}} Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and shifted control of {{pesticide}} regulation from USDA and FDA {{to the newly}} created EPA. By this time public awareness of potential human health and environmental health effects had increased. In addition, {{some members of congress}} began to express concerns about the adequacy of pesticide regulation. [...] The growing public concern created political pressure for pesticide regulation reform. These changes contributed to an environment that enabled an overhaul of pesticide regulation. FIFRA was amended in 1972 by the Federal Environmental Pesticides Control Act (FEPCA). FEPCA required manufacturers of new pesticides to perform a variety of tests to prove that the pesticide did not have “unreasonable adverse effects” on human health or the environment. The EPA was given the authority to refuse registration to any pesticide it concluded was unsafe. In addition, pesticide registration data was required to be made available to the public after a pesticide had been registered. Pesticides that had been registered prior to 1972 could only be banned after a special review board was convened and determined the pesticide was hazardous. If this occurred, the <b>indemnity</b> <b>clause</b> of FEPCA required the EPA to compensate pesticide manufacturers, distributors, and users for the value of any unused stock they possessed. FEPCA also required EPA to review the registration data from pesticides registered prior to 1972, but did not appropriate funds for the task.The reregistration process was beset by difficulties throughout the 1970s. FEPCA required the reregistration process to be complete by 1976; however EPA did not begin reregistration until the fall of 1975. Shortly after beginning the reregistration process, congressional investigations revealed that the EPA was taking shortcuts that undermined the purpose of reregistration. EPA was confirming the presence of registration data rather than determining whether the data was adequate. Shortly after this was revealed, an investigation into Industrial Bio-Test Laboratories (IBT) found that it had been routinely falsifying tests. IBT was the nation’s largest independent laboratory that conducted toxicity tests. The EPA and the Canadian Department of Health and Welfare determined that “only about 10% of the over 2000 IBT studies which had been submitted in support of pesticide registrations were valid.” After these two setbacks, EPA suspended its reregistration program in August 1976. EPA did not restart reregistrations until 1978.|$|R

Second, the influence of the final disability rating on the dollar amount of the permanent <b>partial</b> and total <b>indemnity</b> benefit award is measured.

40|$|During {{the later}} {{half of the}} 20 th century {{standard}} form contracts began to be used more frequently in contract situations. This trend has been consistent and in today’s world numerous commercial parties employ such contracts in their business transactions. The reasons for the extended use of standard form contracts are the benefits that can be obtained for the parties such as time efficiency, effectiveness and price advantages. Standardised contracts often regulate certain issues of the contract for example the way of delivery, remedies and complaints. The definition of such contracts is corresponding in Sweden and England as contracts containing in advance standardised terms with an aim to be used similarly in contract situations with most clients or customers. As the usage of standard form contracts increased, the number of unfair contract terms also enhanced. Therefore, the legislative powers in Sweden and England realised that the rules concerning the freedom of contract had to be restricted and governed. As a result, the legislative powers introduced an open control device through statutory control. This was done in Sweden in 1976 with the enforcement of Section 36 of the Contracts Act, and in England the year after when UCTA came into force. The statutory control in both Sweden and England {{makes it possible to}} appraise the fairness of exemption clauses. The statutory control is not identical in the two states. UCTA only concerns exclusion clauses and limitation clauses regarding contract terms and non-contractual notices. In Sweden, on the other hand, there is a general doctrine of unfairness and Section 36 of the Contracts Act can set aside all kinds of agreements. The statutory control is complemented by indirect means of controlling the content of a contract through non statutory methods. The non statutory methods are concerned with the incorporation, interpretation and construction of clauses in a contract. To be valid and for a party to be able to rely on a term it must have been incorporated into the contract. The rules concerning the interpretation of standard form contracts and exclusion clauses are also of great importance. In both states the approach held is that the statutory control should be used preferably over the indirect control means, though the indirect means still has a prominent role in England through common law. Both England and Sweden agree on that the weaker party in a contract situation is in a greater need of protection by the rules of law in unfair contract situations. However unfairness can only arise if the superior party has wrongfully used the exclusion clause. Our study shows the differences between Swedish and English contract law that can result in difficulties in the harmonisation process. These differences concern the test of reasonableness of exemption clauses, the doctrine of good faith, the legal effects and to what extent the indirect means of control should be applied. The Swedish test of reasonableness may include all relevant circumstances irrespective of the time of their occurrence, before or after the entry of the contract. The courts in England are limited to circumstances that have occurred before the closure of the contract. Section 36 of the Swedish Contracts Act includes a general rule of unfairness applicable to all kinds of contract terms. The rule of unfairness in the UCTA on the other hand, is only applicable to exemption <b>clauses</b> and <b>indemnity</b> <b>clauses</b> and there is no general rule of unfairness in English contract law. Instead the courts rely on indirect means of control, which therefore is of greater importance in English contract law. Finally, adjustments of unfair exemption clauses has a significant role in Swedish contract law, in contrast to English contract law where any adjustment is regarded as an intrusion of the freedom of contract. To endorse {{one of the most important}} aims of the EU; a well working inner market, discussions commenced in 2001. The discussions concerned the harmonisation of the contract law within the union. The questions that arose were whether or not it was possible at all to form a European common contract law and if so, what the effects would be. An action plan was developed by the Commission and today both the EU Parliament and the Council are positive in regard to the continuing work with a reference frame. The Commission aims to pass the reference frame in 2009. Since the EU member states are diverse and have different legal systems a harmonisation of the contract law could cause difficulties. There are differences concerning legal traditions and legal values, hence the legal expertise in Europe is divided in the harmonisation question. The following study aims to analyse the existing rules of law in Sweden and England representing two diverse legal systems existing in Europe; civil law and common law. The focus of this study regards the control of exclusion clauses in standard form contracts in both legal systems. The comparison will then be used to analyse the fundamental question if the harmonisation of contract law in the EU is feasible. Specific areas within the contract law have already been harmonised, which shows a possibility to coordinate common law and civil law. Directive 93 / 13 /EEC on Unfair Terms in Consumer Contracts is one example of harmonised contract law in the EU and the principles in PECL is another example which shows that it is possible to coordinate common law and civil law. A harmonisation of the contract law will probably promote the commerce within the union and be the next step towards one of the most prominent goals of the EU, namely a well functioning common market. However, our study shows that the differences between national legislation and the differences between the legal traditions within the EU are not insignificant and a harmonisation will probably not be enforced without difficulties...|$|R
40|$|Conditions of Use" are {{standardised}} contracts {{which are}} utilised within several areas of shipping. This thesis analyses the conditions issued by gas terminals to shipowners, allocating risks arising during the vessel's port call. The {{purpose of the}} paper is to examine risk allocation and insurance coverage in relation to such contracts. The contracts are built on a principle of unilateral liability, where the liability provisions are characterised by unlimited and strict, or far-reaching, liability for the shipowner {{in the form of}} comprehensive <b>indemnity</b> and disclaimer <b>clauses</b> which together produce the effect that the shipowner becomes liable for all and any damage to its own and the terminal's interests as well as third party interests. The liability provisions depart from ordinary legal principles inter alia with respect to the unlimited and strict liability for the shipowner, the lack of requirement for causation and the terminal's disclaiming of all fault on the part of itself and its servants. In order to facilitate an examination of the contracts, they are first of all placed in a legal, practical, geographical and historical context. Afterwards, certain issues related to contract formation are discussed, more specifically the contracts' binding effect and application with and without the master's signature. The main section of the thesis contains a detailed discussion of the contractual liability provisions with a view to examining their legal consequences for the shipowner, and this is followed by a discussion of whether such terms may be set aside or adjusted under Norwegian law. Subsequently, insurance coverage and risk allocation between shipowner and charterer are considered. Problems in relation to insurance are examined separately, and the presentation also includes a suggested charter party provision drawn up by Nordisk Defence Club. The final section summarises the main points of the thesis with an emphasis on how the contracts may be adjusted to obtain insurance cover. As a starting point, P&I insurers do not cover liabilities in excess of what is imposed by ordinary background law. The cover under hull insurance is more uncertain, since the decisive point for this insurance is whether such terms may be considered customary in the trade. However, some Conditions of Use have obtained P&I approval after negotiations with the terminal. What distinguishes the approved contracts from the others is primarily the negligence-based liability {{on the part of the}} shipowner, the existence of causation and the limitation of liability. This proves that it is possible to negotiate balanced solutions. Moreover, separate P&I insurances with an additional premium and limited liability cover are now available in the market...|$|R
50|$|For {{a number}} of years after the passing of the first Quarantine Act (1710) the {{protective}} practices in England were of the most haphazard and arbitrary kind. In 1721 two vessels laden with cotton goods from Cyprus, then a seat of plague, were ordered to be burned with their cargoes, the owners receiving as <b>indemnity.</b> By the <b>clause</b> in the Levant Trade Act of 1752 vessels for the United Kingdom with a foul bill (i.e. coming from a country where plague existed) had to repair to the lazarets of Malta, Venice, Messina, Livorno, Genoa or Marseille, to perform their quarantine or to have their cargoes sufficiently opened and aired. Since 1741 Stangate Creek (on the Medway) had been made the quarantine station at home; but it would appear from the above clause that it was available only for vessels with clean bills. In 1755 lazarets in the form of floating hulks were established in England for the first time, the cleansing of cargo (particularly by exposure to dews) having been done previously on the ship's deck. There was no medical inspection employed, but the whole routine left to the officers of customs and quarantine. In 1780, when plague was in Poland, even vessels with grain from the Baltic had to lie forty days in quarantine, and unpack and air the sacks; but owing to remonstrances, which came chiefly from Edinburgh and Leith, grain was from that date declared to be a non-susceptible article. About 1788 an order of the council required every ship liable to quarantine, in case of meeting any vessel at sea, or within four leagues of the coast of Great Britain or Ireland, to hoist a yellow flag in the daytime and show a light at the main topmast head at night, under a penalty of After 1800, ships from plague-countries (or with foul bills) were enabled to perform their quarantine on arrival in the Medway instead of taking a Mediterranean port on the way for that purpose; and about the same time an extensive lazaret was built on Chetney Hill near Chatham at an expense of which was almost at once condemned owing to its marshy foundations, and the materials sold for The use of floating hulks as lazarets continued as before. In 1800 two ships with hides from Mogador (Morocco) were ordered to be sunk with their cargoes at the Nore, the owners receiving About this period it was merchandise that was chiefly suspected: there was a long schedule of susceptible articles, and these were first exposed on the ship's deck for twenty-one days or less (six days for each instalment of the cargo), and then transported to the lazaret, where they were opened and aired forty days more. The whole detention of the vessel was from sixty to sixty-five days, including the time for reshipment of her cargo. Pilots had to pass fifteen days on board a convalescent ship. The expenses may be estimated from one or two examples. In 1820 the Asia, 763 tons, arrived in the Medway with a foul bill from Alexandria, laden with linseed; her freight was and her quarantine dues The same year the Pilato, 495 tons, making the same voyage, paid quarantine dues on a freight of In 1823 the expenses of the quarantine service (at various ports) were and the dues paid by shipping (nearly all with clean bills) A return for the United Kingdom and colonies in 1849 showed, among other details, that the expenses of the lazaret at Malta for ten years from 1839 to 1848 had been From 1846 onwards the establishments in the United Kingdom were gradually reduced, while the last vestige of the British quarantine law was removed by the Public Health Act 1896, which repealed the Quarantine Act 1825 (with dependent clauses of other acts), and transferred from the privy council to the Local Government Board the powers to deal with ships arriving infected with yellow fever or plague, the powers to deal with cholera ships having been already transferred by the Public Health Act 1875.|$|R
