40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Carotid endarterectomy (CEA) with <b>patch</b> {{angioplasty}} produces greater results {{than with}} primary closure; however, there remains uncertainty on the optimal <b>patch</b> material in CEA. A systematic review of randomized controlled trials (RCTs) {{was performed to}} evaluate the effect of angioplasty using venous <b>patch</b> versus synthetic <b>patch</b> material, and Dacron <b>patch</b> versus polytetrafluoroethelene (PTFE) <b>patch</b> material during CEA. METHODS: A multiple electronic health database screening was performed including the Cochrane library, Pubmed, Ovid, EMBASE and Google Scholar on all randomized controlled trials (RCTs) published before November 2012 that compared the outcomes of patients undergoing CEA with venous <b>patch</b> versus synthetic <b>patch.</b> RCTs were included if they compared carotid <b>patch</b> angioplasty with autologus venous <b>patch</b> versus synthetic <b>patch</b> material, or compared one type of synthetic <b>patch</b> with another. RESULTS: Thirteen RCTs were identified. Ten trials, involving 1946 CEAs, compared venous <b>patch</b> with synthetic <b>patch</b> materials. Two trials, involving 400 CEAs in 380 patients, compared Dacron <b>patch</b> with PTFE <b>patch.</b> The hemostasis time in CEA with PTFE <b>patch</b> was significantly longer than with venous <b>patch</b> (P 0. 05). One RCT of 95 CEAs in 92 patients compared bovine pericardium with Dacron <b>patch,</b> and demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in intraoperative suture line bleeding with bovine pericardium compared with Dacron <b>patch</b> (P< 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: The hemostasis time in CEA with PTFE <b>patch</b> was longer than with venous <b>patch</b> or Dacron <b>patch.</b> The overall perioperative and long-term mortality rate, stroke rate, restenosis, and operative time were similar when using venous <b>patch</b> versus synthetic <b>patch</b> material or Dacron <b>patch</b> versus PTFE <b>patch</b> material during CEA. More data are required to clarify differences between different <b>patch</b> materials...|$|R

40|$|<b>Patch</b> {{dynamics}} of the Mediterranean slow-growing seagrass Posidonia oceanica was studied in two shallow sites (3 - 10 m) of the Balearic Archipelago (Spain) through repeated censuses (1 - 2 year- 1). In the sheltered site of Es Port Bay (Cabrera Island), initial <b>patch</b> density (October 2001) was low: 0. 05 <b>patches</b> m- 2, and the <b>patch</b> size (number of shoots) distribution was bimodal: most of the <b>patches</b> had less than 6 shoots or between 20 and 50 shoots. Mean <b>patch</b> recruitment in Es Port Bay (0. 006 ± 0. 002 <b>patches</b> m- 2 year- 1) exceeded mean <b>patch</b> loss (0. 001 ± 0. 001 <b>patches</b> m- 2 year- 1), yielding positive net <b>patch</b> recruitment (0. 004 ± 0. 003 <b>patches</b> m- 2 year- 1) and a slightly increased <b>patch</b> density 3 years later (July 2004, 0. 06 <b>patches</b> m- 2). In the exposed site of S'Estanyol, the initial <b>patch</b> density was higher (1. 38 <b>patches</b> m- 2, August 2003), and <b>patch</b> size frequency decreased exponentially with size. <b>Patch</b> recruitment (0. 26 <b>patches</b> m- 2 year- 1) and loss (0. 24 <b>patches</b> m- 2 year- 1) were high, yielding a slightly increased <b>patch</b> density in the area 1 year later (October 2004, 1. 40 <b>patches</b> m- 2). Most recruited <b>patches</b> consisted of rooting vegetative fragments of 1 - 2 shoots. Seedling recruitment was observed in Summer 2004 at both sites. Episodic, seedling recruitment comprised 30 % and 25 % of total <b>patch</b> recruitment in Es Port Bay and S'Estanyol, respectively. <b>Patch</b> survival increased with <b>patch</b> size and no direct removal was observed among <b>patches</b> of 5 shoots or more. Most <b>patches</b> grew along the study, shifting <b>patch</b> distribution towards larger sizes. Within the size range studied (1 - 150 shoots), absolute shoot recruitment (shoots year- 1) increased linearly with <b>patch</b> size (R 2 = 0. 64, p < 4 × 10 - 5, N = 125), while specific shoot recruitment was constant (about 0. 25 ± 0. 05 year- 1), although its variance was large for small <b>patches.</b> Given the slow growth rate and the high survival of <b>patches</b> with 5 or more shoots, even the low <b>patch</b> recruitment rates reported here could {{play a significant role}} in the colonisation process of P. oceanica. © 2008 Elsevier B.

40|$|We {{investigated}} <b>patch</b> assessment by northern bobwhites (Colinus virginianus) in {{an experimental}} arena where {{the distribution of}} resources in <b>patches,</b> preharvest information about these <b>patches,</b> and spacing of <b>patches</b> varied. We found that preharvest information about <b>patch</b> quality and a bimodal distribution of <b>patch</b> rewards allowed birds to selectively exploit <b>patches</b> high in resources. In contrast, uniform distribution of <b>patch</b> qualities and lack of preharvest information caused birds to forage nonselectively among <b>patches.</b> Birds distinguished among <b>patches</b> of different quality when these <b>patches</b> were spaced 1 3 m apart, but failed to react to <b>patch</b> quality differences when <b>patches</b> were 0 or S m apart We also found a strong effect {{of the level of}} <b>patch</b> depletion on foraging decisions: as resources in die arena became scarce, birds increasingly foraged selectively in die most profitable <b>patches.</b> Foraging decisions of bobwhites are biased by die way they experience and memorize a spatially and temporally variable environment. The relative cost of this cognitive bias (i. e., lost opportunity) is nonlinearty related to die mean resource density in die environment and to die difference between this mean density and die resource density in die exploited <b>patch.</b> Cognitive bias should be considered when evaluating <b>patch</b> assessment capabilities of foragers in complex environments.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} a novel and efficient examplar-based inpainting algorithm through investigating the sparsity of natural image <b>patches.</b> Two novel concepts of sparsity at the <b>patch</b> level are proposed for modeling the <b>patch</b> priority and <b>patch</b> representation, which are two crucial steps for <b>patch</b> propagation in the examplar-based inpainting approach. First, <b>patch</b> structure sparsity {{is designed to}} measure the confidence of a <b>patch</b> located at the image structure (e. g., the edge or corner) by the sparseness of its nonzero similarities to the neighboring <b>patches.</b> The <b>patch</b> with larger structure sparsity will be assigned higher priority for further inpainting. Second, {{it is assumed that}} the <b>patch</b> to be filled can be represented by the sparse linear combination of candidate <b>patches</b> under the local <b>patch</b> consistency constraint in a framework of sparse representation. Compared with the traditional examplar-based inpainting approach, structure sparsity enables better discrimination of structure and texture, and the <b>patch</b> sparse representation forces the newly inpainted regions to be sharp and consistent with the surrounding textures.

40|$|This {{laboratory}} study describes the sediment patterns formed in a sand bed around circular <b>patches</b> of rigid vertical cylinders, representing a <b>patch</b> of reedy emergent vegetation.

For flows above the threshold of sediment motion, patterns of sediment erosion and deposition were observed around and within the <b>patch.</b> Scouring within the <b>patch</b> was positively correlated with turbulent kinetic energy in the <b>patch.</b> For sparse <b>patches,</b> sediment scoured from within the <b>patch</b> was mostly deposited within one <b>patch</b> diameter downstream of the <b>patch.</b> For dense <b>patches,</b> which experience greater flow diversion, sediment scoured from the <b>patch</b> was carried farther downstream before deposition along the <b>patch</b> centerline. Differences between the sparse and dense <b>patch</b> patterns of deposition are explained in the context of flow diversion and wake structure, which are related to a nondimensional flow blockage parameter.

40|$|<b>Patch</b> quality {{may affect}} {{software}} maintenance cost. However, {{there is a}} lack of understanding why <b>patches</b> are accepted/rejected. To provide empirical evidence of <b>patch</b> acceptance, we (1) present <b>patch</b> review criteria based on our literature survey and manual <b>patch</b> inspection, (2) show the result of a large scale online survey to understand the opinion of both <b>patch</b> reviewers and submitters, (3) propose <b>patch</b> acceptance prediction features based on the <b>patch</b> review criteria which show reasonable performance. Software developers submit <b>patches</b> to handle tens or even hundreds of bugs reported daily. However, not all submitted <b>patches</b> can be directly integrated into the codebase, since they might not pass <b>patch</b> review that is adopted in most software projects. As the result of <b>patch</b> review, incoming <b>patches</b> can be rejected or asked for resubmission after improvement. Both scenarios interrupt the workflow of <b>patch</b> writers and reviewers, increase their workload, and potentially delay the general development process. In this paper, we aim to help developers write acceptable <b>patches</b> to avoid <b>patch</b> rejection and resubmission. To this end, we derive a comprehensive list of <b>patch</b> rejection reasons from a manual inspection of 300 rejected Eclipse and Mozilla <b>patches,</b> a large-scale online survey of Eclipse and Mozilla developers, and the literature. We also investigate which patch-rejection reasons are more decisive and which are difficult to judge from the perspective of <b>patch</b> reviewers. Our findings include 1) suboptimal solution and incomplete fix are the most frequent patch-rejection reasons 2) whether a <b>patch</b> introduces new bugs is very important yet very difficult to judge 3) reviewers reject a large <b>patch</b> not solely because of its size, but mainly because of the underlying reasons that induce its large size, such as the involvement of unnecessary changes 4) reviewers consider certain problems to be much more destructive than <b>patch</b> writers expect, such as the inconsistency of documentation in a <b>patch</b> and 5) bad timing of <b>patch</b> submission and a lack of communication with team members can also result in a negative <b>patch</b> review...|$|R
