40|$|There {{is a wide}} {{geographical}} {{spread of}} skipjack pole-and-line fishing bases in east Indonesia. The article identifies and analyses {{the relative importance of}} several interactive factors on <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>vessel</b> catch performance, including the effects of the vessel (eg its size, horse power and age), baitfish (its availability and abundance), the crew (number and skill), season, weather, use of Fish Aggregating Devices (FADs), geographical location of the fishing ground, and 'fleet congestion'. The importance of FADs in improving catch performance is particularly highlighted. Partly from this comparative analysis, it is postulated that the resident stock in this area is supplemented by large seasonal migrations of skipjack from the western tropical Pacific stock. As the bulk of this migration passes through the waters north of Irian Jaya, this region must offer some of the best fishing opportunities, and hence will have the highest priority for the future development of skipjack pole-and-line and purse seine bases in Indonesia. ...|$|E
40|$|Successive {{meetings}} of the Standing Committee on Tuna and Billfish, and most recently the inaugural meeting of the Scientific Committee of the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission, have rec-ommended that a new large-scale tagging project, focusing on bigeye tuna, yellowfin tuna, and skipjack tuna, be carried out to provide new information that will increase the certainty {{in the assessment of}} these fish stocks. The tagging data generated by the project will be incorporated directly into stock assessment analyses and will provide data on medium- to large-scale tuna movements. As the first phase of this regional project, tagging will be conducted in the exclusive econom-ic zone of Papua New Guinea (PNG), using a chartered <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>vessel.</b> The first of two three-month tagging cruises in PNG is scheduled to begin in mid-August 2006. The second cruise will occur from March to June 2007. We will keep Fisheries Newsletter readers informed on the progress of this new project...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent trends}} in the Japanese tuna and billfish fishing activities by longline, pole-and-line, purse seine and other fisheries mostly in the WCPFC Convention Area (WCP-CA), including fleet size, catch and fishing effort statistics. The total number of longline vessels was 1, 208 in 2006, which was 25 vessels (2 %) {{less than that of}} 2005. For the <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>vessel,</b> total number of the vessels was 335 in 2006, which was 52 vessels (13 %) less than that in 2005. For the purse seine vessels, the number of vessels over 200 GRT, which operated in the equatorial waters, was 35 in 2006, which was equivalent to that in 2005. The number of the purse seine vessels of 50 - 200 GRT, which operate to catch tunas in north of 20 °N, was 84 in 2006, which are 3 vessels less than that in 2005. The total WCP-CA catch of tunas (Pacific bluefin, albacore, bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack) by the Japanese fishery in 2006 was 460, 000 mt, corresponding to 92 % of 501, 000 mt in 2005. In 2006, the catch of tunas by the purse seine fishery was 257, 000 mt (56 % of the total catch of tunas), with 124, 000 mt (27 %) by the pole-and-line, 67, 000 mt (15 %) by the longline, and the remaining (2 %) by the other gears. Japan conducted several research activities in relation to tuna in the WCP-CA in 2007 and 2008, such as tagging study for tropical tunas and sharks, research cruise for collecting tuna larvae. In addition, experimental longline cruises were conducted in order {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} circle hook in reducing hooking mortality of sea turtles, experiments on tori line, and sea turtle nesting survey. ...|$|E
40|$|Fish {{handling}} on vessels {{plays an}} important role in the quality of skipjack tuna. The purpose of this study was to identify the quality of pole-and-line caught skipjack tuna. The study was conducted using a descriptive method and purposive sampling, taking a sample of 3 vessels. An analysis was conducted through organoleptic, microbiological, and chemical (histamine) tests. Data were analyzed by descriptive, qualitative and quantitative displays via tables and graphics. The results of organoleptic, microbiological and chemical tests showed that skipjack tuna caught by <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>vessels</b> were still suitable to be consumed...|$|R
40|$|Around the Hawaiian Islands, {{a variety}} of small and medium-scale {{fisheries}} target bigeye (Thunnus obsesus) and yellowfin tuna (T. albacares) associated with offshore seamounts and weather monitoring buoys, an inshore network of fish aggregating devices (FADs), and natural aggregation sites (Itano and Holland, 2000). These fisheries, conducted from longline, troll and handline, {{and to a lesser}} extent from <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>vessels,</b> provide an important source of revenue for the state (Boggs and Ito, 1993; Ito and Machado, 1999). The small-gear fleet (essentially the trolling and handline vessels) supports recreational and subsistence fisheries for both residents and the tourist industry (Pooley, 1993; Hamilton and Huffman, 1997). An important sector within Hawai‘i’s small-scale commercial fisheries is the offshore handline fishery, which targets mixedspecies aggregations found in association with NOAA offshor...|$|R
40|$|The Pacific Tuna Tagging Programme (PTTP) is a WPCFC {{endorsed}} project {{being implemented}} {{through a variety}} of funding sources by the SPC-OFP to tag tropical tuna throughout the WCPO. The primary tag release platform will be chartered <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>vessel(s)</b> operating west of the Date Line to the Philippines and Indonesia. Tag releases in the Central Pacific will be accomplished through a combination of PTTP funded charters and externally funded PTTP affiliated national tagging programs. The first PTTP funded Central Pacific tagging effort consisted of a 30 day charter of the Hawaii-based FV Double D to the NOAA TAO oceanographic buoys south of Hawaii along the 155 °W meridian and east of the Line Islands of Kiribati. The objective of this cruise and other sub-regional components of the PTTP is to target difficult to access areas of the Central Pacific (including French Polynesia) to improve overall spatial coverage of PTTP tag releases. The Double D is a Honolulu-based multi-purpose pelagic handline/longline vessel equipped with the full complement of Hawaiian-style tuna handline gears in addition to hydraulic trolling reels. The vessel is also equipped with two mini longline reels for conventional or targeted short-set longline fishing on tuna and pomphret aggregations. A total of 1909 tropical tunas were tagged and released during the cruise comprising 1736 bigeye (90. 9 %), 57 skipjac...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{recent trends}} in the Japanese tuna and billfish fisheries, e. g., longline, pole-and-line, purse seine and other miscellaneous coastal fisheries in the WCPFC Convention Area (WCP-CA), including fleet size, catch and fishing effort statistics. Total number of commercial longline vessels (larger than 10 GRT) was 433 in 2010 which was 11 vessels (2 %) less than that in 2009. Total number of <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>vessels</b> (larger than 20 GRT) was 92 in 2010 which was 5 vessels (5 %) less than that in 2009. For the purse seine vessels, the number of vessels over 200 GRT was 37 in 2010, which were the same number as that in 2009. Out of the 37 vessels over 200 GRT, the number of vessels which are allowed to operate in tropical waters was 35 in 2010 and has been stabilized since 1995. The total 2010 WCP-CA catch of tunas (Pacific bluefin, albacore, bigeye, yellowfin and skipjack) by the Japanese fishery was still provisional and estimated to be 432, 657 mt, and this is corresponding to 104 % of 2009 total tuna catch (414, 299 mt).

40|$|The {{majority}} of the tuna tagged during the IOTC Regional Tuna Tagging Project of the Indian Ocean (RTTP-IO) were released in tuna schools associated with tagging vessels (72 % of all RTTP-IO tagged tuna) implementing the Associated School Fishing Technique (ASFT). This fishing technique was first developed off Mauritania Senegal by local <b>pole-and-line</b> <b>vessels</b> in the 1980 s. During the program the ASFT was implemented by the two RTTP-IO tagging vessels {{over a period of}} 71 / 2 months in 2006 and three months in 2007 generating release of 121, 068 tuna with a well-balanced species composition between the 3 species tagged (33. 3 % yellowfin, 39. 5 % skipjack and 27. 2 % bigeye). Fishing without using any live bait (only lures on the hooks) was also possible and very productive as 56 % of all tagged tuna were caught that way, The consequences of using ASFT on the results of the RTTP-IO are presented. While fishing associated schools (AS), 11, 016 recaptures of tagged tuna (61 % yellowfin, 18 % skipjack, 21 % bigeye) were registered by the tagging vessels and some tuna were recaptured several times, one tagged skipjack was caught nine times during a period of two months. This paper analyses the contribution of the ASFT within the overall RTTP-IO tagging program and the characteristics of the recoveries of tagged tuna by the tagging vessels fishing AS. The quite low level of local recaptures in AS fishing underlined a high turn-over of the three species in AS in particular, and in this area in general. This place was like a hub for tuna coming in and going out at a high rate, indicating a rapid and good dispersion of the tagged fish into the rest of the population. These results are compared with recoveries observed in the Atlantic Ocean, where similar tagging operations were carried out in the 1990 s, revealing disparate results in the two oceans...|$|R
