40|$|A <b>proximate</b> <b>determinant</b> of {{an outcome}} (or event) is a {{variable}} (or factor) {{that produces a}} direct effect on that outcome. It can act as an intermediary variable through which other variables (or factors) which have indirect effects on the same outcome variable operate to exhibit their effects. Socioeconomic, demographic and cultural factors (also called background or underlying factors) {{are known to have}} indirect effects on whether or not a pregnant woman would choose to deliver her baby in a healthcare facility. The background or underlying factors of the women can also determine if they will attend or not attend antenatal clinic during pregnancy. However, antenatal clinic attendance also has direct effect on a woman’s use of healthcare facility to deliver her baby. 	In this study we examined whether or not antenatal clinic attendance is a major <b>proximate</b> <b>determinant</b> of use of healthcare facility for delivery by Nigerian women. The study used quantitative data from the 2008 Nigeria Demographic and Health Surveys (NDHS). Mothers were asked to indicate where they delivered their last babies (i. e., in Healthcare Facility or outside the healthcare facility) and also the number of antenatal visits they attended during the pregnancy. A mother that had four or more visits during the pregnancy was considered to have had adequate number of visits {{and those who did not}} attend at all or attended for less than four times were considered not to have had adequate attendance. Information was also collected on the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the women. Information was also collected on the socio-economic and demographic characteristics of the women. 	The data analyzed consisted of 17, 635 women aged 15 - 49 years who had a live birth within the five years preceding the survey STATA 12 computer software was used to carry out data analyses. Data analyses were at univariate, bivariate and multivariate levels. Due to the dichotomous nature of the outcome variable (i. e., whether a child was delivered in a healthcare facility or not; coded as (1, 0)), the multivariate analyses technique used is Binary Logistic Regression, and Likelihood Ratio (LR) statistical test of significance was applied. 	Results from bivariate analysis indicated that the background (underlying) factors of the women (i. e., age, children ever born, region of residence, educational level, wealth index status, and religion) all have significant association with the number of antenatal visits made by mothers during their last pregnancy (P < 0. 001). Similarly, antenatal clinic attendance has significant relationship with delivery in healthcare facility (P < 0. 001). 	The binary logistic regression which includes all the six background variables and antennal clinic attendance (i. e., the <b>proximate</b> <b>determinant)</b> indicated a highly significant contribution to the model chi-square statistic. Women who had adequate number of antenatal clinic visits were about four times more likely to deliver their babies in healthcare facility than were those mothers who did not (OR = 4. 4, P < 0. 001). The likelihood Ratio (LR) test to determine the extent to which antenatal clinic attendance helped to explain the effect of the background variables on delivery in healthcare facilities also gave a highly significant result (chi-square = 891 on 1 degree of freedom, P < 0. 001). This means that antenatal clinic attendance is an important <b>proximate</b> <b>determinant</b> through which socioeconomic, demographic and cultural factors influence Nigerian women delivery in healthcare facilities. We conclude therefore that policies and programs targeted at encouraging Nigerian pregnant women to attend adequately antenatal clinics will also increase the prevalence of their delivery in healthcare facilities, thereby reducing the risk of maternal and infant mortality.

These relationships were first recognized by Davis and Blake (1956), who defined a large set of "intermediate fertility variables. " In the late 1970 s Bongaarts (1978) identified a smaller set of <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> and developed a relatively simple model to quantify their fertility effects. Objective : This paper fine-tunes the Bongaarts <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> model in light of new evidence, research, and data that have become available over the past three decades. Reproductive behavior has changed substantially and certain original simplifying assumptions have become less accurate over time. In addition, new research allows some features of the model to be improved. Methods : Six adjustments to the model are proposed and implemented. The revised model is compared with the original version and with a revision proposed by Stover (1998). Results : Revised estimates of the indexes of the <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> and total fecundity are provided for the most recent DHS surveys in 36 developing countries. The revised model provides a better fit than do earlier models. Conclusions : The <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> model, as originally conceived, remains conceptually sound. However, theoretical and empirical evidence accumulated over the past three decades suggests a number of ways to fine-tune the model to make it more robust and accurate in contemporary populations.

Recently, dramatically low fertility rates across the globe have raised questions regarding whether this model {{could be applied to}} exclusively below-replacement nations. This study follows Knodel, Chamratrithirong, and Debavalya's 1987 analysis of fertility decline in Thailand by conducting in-depth case studies of the <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> in two low fertility countries over time: South Korea, where fertility is well below the level of replacement, and the United States, where fertility has hovered around replacement level for many years. Then, the fertility-inhibiting effect of the <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> is assessed by comparing the quantitative index representing each determinant measured in the 1960 s/ 1970 s with its measurement in the 2000 s. For both years, I consider the fertility level that would prevail in the determinant's presence as well as the level that would exist in its absence. Finally, I use each of the indices to calculate the TFR and assess how the strength of the model varies over time in the two countries. Ultimately, results indicate that the <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> model does not offer a clean picture of the fertility level in either South Korea or the United States; when trends uncovered by the case studies are compared to the results of the quantitative analysis, a number of inconsistencies are revealed. This suggests that certain components in the model may need to be respecified for more effective application in low-fertility contexts. However, {{that is not to say}} that it offers no insight into fertility at all or that it is no longer a useful tool. On the contrary, it is shown that the <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> model holds a lot of potential for analysis in low-fertility nations.

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2008. Zimbabwe is {{amongst the}} few {{countries}} in Africa {{with a low}} fertility rate. The fertility transition began in the 1980 s and has continued in recent years. The total fertility rate (TFR) declined from 5. 5 births in 1988 to 4. 3 births in 1994 and further declined in 1999 and 2005 to 4. 0 births and 3. 8 births respectively. Fertility declined by 1. 7 births from 1988 to 2005. This study examines and evaluates the <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> responsible for fertility decline in Zimbabwe from 1988 to 2005. The study attempts to address two questions: What are the principal <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> responsible for fertility reduction in Zimbabwe? What is the contribution {{of each of the}} <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> to fertility decline at different periods of time in Zimbabwe? This study utilizes data from the Zimbabwe Demographic and Health Surveys (ZDHS) conducted in Zimbabwe from 1988 to 2005. The model introduced by Bongaarts (1978, 1982) and later modified by Jolly and Gribble (1993) will be utilized in this study to evaluate the impact of these <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> on fertility. The results from the study confirm that fertility has declined in Zimbabwe from 1988 to 2005. The decline in fertility was influenced by proportion of women married, contraceptive use and postpartum infecundability. Since abortion is illegal in Zimbabwe, there is no reliable data available to examine its impact on fertility. As a result this determinant was not examined in this study. The results show that contraceptive use is the leading inhibitive factor of fertility from 1988 to 2005 in Zimbabwe. The findings also confirm that postpartum infecundability followed by marriage patterns is also responsible for fertility reduction during the same period. The results also showed that there are no variations in <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> of fertility from 1988 to 2005. A review of the literature suggests that Zimbabwe is amongst the few countries in the subSaharan Africa with a high contraceptive rate. The family planning programmes introduced by the government before and after independence which were well organized and administered influenced fertility levels observed in Zimbabwe. It is hoped that this study will assist policy makers in developing countries especially Africa to reduce fertility rates...|$|R

Contrary to some popular perceptions, the dramatic surge in foreign exchange reserves since 2001 is mainly attributable to non-FDI capital inflows, rather than current account surpluses or FDI. ...|$|E

Results: Socio-economic distal determinants are important predictors for infant mortality. For example, in reference to infants of the richest class, the adjusted odds ratio of infant mortality was 1. 66 (95 % CI: 1. 00 – 2. 74) in middle class and 1. 87 (95 % CI: 1. 14 – 3. 08) in poorer class, respectively.

Male gender, wealth, unstable immigration classes, and unsecure employment statuses were independently associated with more frequent condom use. <b>Proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> mediating these relationships included: not having a cohabiting regular partner, not disliking condoms, and having a history of unwanted sex. The <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> mediated 85. 7 - 97. 6 % {{of the effects of the}} social determinants. These results link social context and proximate factors with condom use. They can be used to design evidence-informed interventions for ACB people...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Logistic {{regression}} {{analysis was used to}} analyse sex allocation in a population of the leaf-cutting ant Acromyrmex balzani occurring in a pasture in southern Brazil. The field sample consisted of 151 fungus-garden chambers (18 queenright and 133 queenless), belonging to 50 nests with three vertically stacked chambers per nest on average. Taking nest chamber as the unit of analysis, seven predictor variables were considered: sampling date, chamber depth, chamber volume, weight of fungus garden, presence of a queen, number of large workers, and number of small to medium workers. The population-level numerical proportion of females was 0. 548 and the inferred proportional energetic investment in females 0. 672. The former was not significantly dif-ferent from 0. 5 (P= 0. 168), but the latter was (P= 0. 0003). The proportional investment in females per fungus garden increased with the number of large workers present (P= 0. 0002) and decreased with the dry weight of the fungus garden (P= 0. 012). This implies that resource acquisition through foraging {{is likely to be a}} major <b>proximate</b> <b>determinant</b> of sex allocation. The negative correlation between female bias and fungus garden weight might be due to developing adult females requiring more food than males, but this hypothesis could not be confirmed by direct statistical evidence...|$|E

In this paper, we adopt a cross-country perspective to examine the evolution of capital flows into China, both in terms of volumes and composition. China’s inflows have generally been dominated by foreign direct investment (FDI), a pattern that appears to be favorable in light of the recent literature on the experiences of developing countries with financial globalization. We provide a detailed documentation of the evolution of China’s capital controls, a <b>proximate</b> <b>determinant</b> of the pattern of capital inflows. We also discuss a number of other intriguing hypotheses that attempt to capture the “deeper ” causes underlying China’s approach to capital flows. In particular, we argue that some popular mercantilist-type arguments are inconsistent with the facts. We also analyze the recent rapid rise of China’s international reserves and discuss its implications. Contrary to some popular perceptions, the dramatic surge in foreign exchange reserves since 2001 is mainly attributable to non-FDI capital inflows, rather than current account surpluses or FDI...|$|E
40|$|Life-history theory {{suggests}} that organisms face fitness trade-offs during reproduction. Using observational and experimental methods, I tested how variation in proximate factors influenced reproductive effort and success in the American kestrel (Falco sparverius), a small falcon. Specifically, I investigated how parasites, food supply and brood size affected parental effort decisions in kestrels {{and the consequences of}} those decisions for both parents and offspring. Parasites may compete with hosts for nutrients or force hosts to invest in immune function, thereby decreasing host reproductive effort ('parasite cost' hypothesis). Conversely, reproductive effort may affect parasite loads if hosts allocate resources to reproduction such that allocation to immune function is compromised ('reproductive cost' hypothesis). I tested these hypotheses by examining the relationship between effort invested in eggs and blood parasite loads of kestrels. Parasite loads measured prior to egg laying had no detectable effects on reproductive effort. Females that made large investments in reproduction subsequently had lower parasite intensities than those whose reproductive efforts were smaller, suggesting that females were capable of allocating energy to both forming clutches and reducing parasite loads. Females choosing high quality mates may not only have large reproductive outputs, but may also obtain sufficient resources from their mates to enable females to reduce their parasite burdens. Males that made large investments in reproduction were more likely to subsequently be parasitized and have more intense infections. I investigated how natural variation in the main prey of kestrels, small mammals, influenced reproductive success. My results suggest that provisioning behaviour of kestrels raising offspring was not constrained by the ' abundance' of food, but rather the 'availability' of food, mediated through variation in weather. Moreover, nestlings exposed to inclement weather were in poorer condition and less likely to survive to fledging. I also performed a food supplementation experiment to test how food supply influenced reproduction. Results from both unmanipulated and supplemented nests suggests kestrels raising offspring are limited by food. In addition to food supply, parental effort often varies with brood size. However, it is unclear whether brood size is the <b>proximate</b> <b>determinant</b> of parental effort, or conversely whether parental effort is the proximate factor to which brood size is adjusted. To distinguish between these hypotheses, I experimentally reduced brood sizes of kestrels. My results suggested that males adjusted their provisioning rates accordingly. Conversely, female kestrels did not adjust provisioning behaviour to brood size. Quality and survival of offspring in reduced broods were similar to control young, which I speculate {{may be the result of}} larger food requirements because of potentially higher thermoregulatory costs compared to young in control nests. I conclude that brood size is a <b>proximate</b> <b>determinant</b> of parental effort in kestrels. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|E
40|$|Almost all the World Fertility Surveys (WFS), {{and those}} repeating {{a similar pattern}} of {{pregnancy}} history data collection, like the Population, Labour Force, and Migration Survey (PLM) carried out in Pakistan in 1979 - 80, covered information on <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> for the last closed and open birth intervals. This paper, based on the PLM data, discusses the methodological issue of data collection. The types of restriction used have often been doubted as they have produced biased estimates of contraceptive use and duration of breast-feeding, which are important in the estimation of birth interval and in the ultimate estimation of the structures of the relationship predicting fertility. The representativeness of the last closed and open birth intervals is limited if these are probed deeper in the time before survey, as the proportion of births gets quite small. It is inappropriate to estimate <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> on fertility data that do not provide information on all the births. Therefore, an attempt {{has been made to}} estimate contraceptive use and breast-feeding with and without the WFS restrictions. The logit model has been used with a dichotomous variable, 'whether the next live birth occurs or not', on <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> and other socio-economic variables to estimate the amount of biasedness. The results reveal that {{there appears to be a}} higher proportion of unbiased estimates if they are derived through the unrestricted sample; and these results are in conformity with the results found elsewhere. The biasedness of the restricted samples also affects the studies aimed at observing the relationship between the predictor and the dependent variables. ...|$|R

The overall goal of this thesis is to guide HIV prevention interventions for ACB communities. It focuses on social factors that impact HIV vulnerability. This research used data from the Black, African, and Caribbean Canadian Health Study—a mixed methods study that used 30 semi-structured interviews, and a cross-sectional survey using a structured, self-administered quantitative questionnaire to collect information about HIV and health from 188 ACB people. The first manuscript compares risk perceptions to the social epidemiology of HIV risk. ACB people generally perceived their personal HIV risk to be low and they focused on sexual risks. Service providers’ perceptions about HIV risk behaviours were sometimes inconsistent with ACB people’s experiences. Quantitative results confirmed that HIV risk was mainly sexual. There were few gender-based differences in risk behaviours. Those living in poverty were more likely to be abstinent and use condoms. Born Canadians had the highest prevalences of forced sex, mixing alcohol or drugs with sex, and past STI diagnoses. Stable employment was associated with higher prevalences of not using condoms and past STI diagnoses. The second manuscript identified social and <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> of HIV testing in the past year. Approximately 20 % of ACB people had tested for HIV in the past year. Testing for HIV was independently associated with higher education, stable immigration classes, living in Canada foryears, and gender and ethnicity combined. <b>Proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> mediating these relationships included: lower English language proficiency, greater HIV knowledge, and higher numbers of lifetime and past-year sex partners. The third manuscript ascertains social and <b>proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> of the frequency of condom use. About 20. 5 % of sexually active ACB adults used condoms consistently. Male gender, wealth, unstable immigration classes, and less secure employment statuses status were independently associated with the frequency of condom use. <b>Proximate</b> <b>determinants</b> mediating these relationships included: not having a cohabiting regular partner, not disliking condoms, having one lifetime sex partner, and having a history of unwanted sex...|$|R
