500|$|The {{dispersal}} of spores {{is different from}} most [...] "typical" [...] mushrooms that spread their spores through the air. Stinkhorns instead produce a sticky spore mass on their tip which has a sharp, sickly-sweet odor of carrion to attract flies and other insects. Odorous chemicals in the gleba include methanethiol, hydrogen sulfide, linalool, trans-ocimene, <b>phenylacetaldehyde,</b> dimethyl sulfide, and dimethyl trisulfide. The latter compound {{has been found to}} be emitted from fungating cancerous wounds. The mature fruiting bodies can be smelled from a considerable distance in the woods, and at close quarters most people find the cloying stink extremely repulsive. The flies land in the gleba and in doing so collect the spore mass on their legs and carry it to other locations. An Austrian study demonstrated that blow-flies (species Calliphora vicina, Lucilia caesar, Lucilia ampullacea and Dryomyza anilis) also feed on the slime, and soon after leaving the fruit body, they deposit liquid feces that contain a dense suspension of spores. The study also showed that beetles (Oeceoptoma thoracica and Meligethes viridescens) are attracted to the fungus, but seem to have less of a role in spore dispersal as they tend to feed on the hyphal tissue of the fruiting body.|$|E

Epidemiological studies and clinical data {{provide evidence that}} isoflavone metabolites, such as the isoflavan equol, contribute to these beneficial effects. In this study we developed a new route to isoflavans and isoflavenes via 2 -morpholinoisoflavenes derived from a condensation reaction of <b>phenylacetaldehydes,</b> salicylaldehydes and morpholine. We report the synthesis of the isoflavans equol and deoxygenated analogues, and the isoflavenes 7, 4 &# 039;-dihydroxyisoflav- 3 -ene (phenoxodiol, haganin E) and 7, 4 &# 039;-dihydroxyisoflav- 2 -ene (isophenoxodiol). Vascular pharmacology studies reveal that all oxygenated isoflavans and isoflavenes can attenuate phenylephrine-induced vasoconstriction, which was unaffected by the estrogen receptor antagonist ICI 182, 780. Furthermore, the compounds inhibited U 46619 (a thromboxane A 2 analogue) induced vasoconstriction in endothelium-denuded rat aortae, and reduced the formation of GTP RhoA, with the effects being greatest for equol and phenoxodiol. Ligand displacement studies of rat uterine cytosol estrogen receptor revealed the compounds to be generally weak binders. These data {{are consistent with the}} vasorelaxation activity of equol and phenoxodiol deriving at least in part by inhibition of the RhoA/Rho-kinase pathway, and along with the limited estrogen receptor affinity supports a role for equol and phenoxodiol as useful agents for maintaining cardiovascular function with limited estrogenic effects...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of thesis {{describes}} the synthesis of carbonyl compounds from the styrene and derivatives using [hydroxy(tosyloxy) iodo]benzene, a hypervalent iodine compound, and p-toluenesulfonic acid monohydrate. Four equivalents of hypervalent iodine reagent was necessary to provide the products in high yields. The reaction was performed at 70 °C under argon to avoid further oxidation of benzaldehyde to carboxylic acid. Electron rich styrenes were converted into benzaldehydes in good to high yield, whereas electron deficient styrenes produced bis(tosylates) as the major products. Three paths were possible for the high yield of aldehydes (i) cleavage of glycol intermediate; (ii) cleavage of the epoxide intermediate; (iii) further oxidative cleavage of the rearrangement product - <b>phenylacetaldehydes.</b> The {{second part of the}} thesis describes the synthesis of substituted 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazoles from aldoximes. Hypervalent iodine was used at stoichiometric and catalytic level to synthesize 1, 2, 4 -oxadiazoles. The reaction was believed to proceed through nitrile oxide as an intermediate, followed by 1, 3 -dipolar cycloaddition with nitriles. Moderate yield was obtained when benzonitrile was used, whereas poor yield was obtained with acetonitrile. The possible reason for moderate yield was mainly attributed to two factors: (i) elimination of water molecule from aldoximes; (ii) diastereomeric purity of aldoxime. The study is in preliminary stage and requires further investigation...|$|R
40|$|The main aim of {{the work}} {{presented}} here is to develop new, practical, economical, and environmental friendly synthetic protocols for various organic transformations with hypervalent iodine compounds, which have attracted explosive interest among chemistry communities because of their versatility and mildness in inducing many organic transformations. 	Chapter 1 briefly introduces the history of hypervalent iodine compounds, nomenclature, classification, bonding and reactivity patterns. The preparation and practical applications of typical I(III) and I(V) compounds have also been briefly surveyed. 	Chapter 2 provides details on hypervalent iodine compounds catalyzed oxidation of benzylic C-H to the corresponding carbonyl compounds with Oxone. The catalytic efficiency {{is influenced by the}} rate of in situ generation of catalyst with Oxone and their stability. The effectiveness in situ generated 352 ̆ 7, 502 ̆ 7 and 512 ̆ 7 are almost the same, leading to low to moderate yields of products, while 18 and 472 ̆ 7 give moderate to high yields. Compound 482 ̆ 7 was founds to be the most active catalyst in this study. A possible mechanism is also proposed. 	Chapter 3 covers a surprising reaction between IBX or IBA and alkyl halides promoted by quaternary ammonium halides. In the absence of quaternary ammonium halides, no reaction occurred between IBX or IBA and alkyl halides. However, in the presence of quaternary ammonium halides, IBX or IBA and alkyl halides react smoothly to form the corresponding alkyl iodobenzoates. When IBX or IBA is treated with a quaternary ammonium halide, it will decompose to 2 -iodobenzoic acid. The presence of a nucleophilic halide ion is essential for such reaction to occur. Replacing halides with non-nucleophilic BF 4 - halts the reaction. Benzylic halides provides a better yield than aliphatic alkyl halide. Thus, it is believed that there is a fast interaction between the nucleophilic halides and electrophilic iodine in IBX or IBA. A plausible reaction mechanism is proposed. 	Chapter 4 details our research on the oxidative cleavage of C=C with PIFA/water. In the presence of a small amount of water in acetonitrile at 65 - 70 oC, [bis(trifluoroacetoxy) iodo]benzene (PIFA, 26) converts styrenes into benzaldehydes in good to high yields. Contrary to literature description that electron-rich styrenes primarily produces <b>phenylacetaldehydes</b> as major products through a 1, 2 -phenyl migration, we have found that these styrenes can be converted to benzaldehydes in high yields. It was found that three equiv of 26 and one equiv of water were necessary to achieve high yields. Two pathways were believed responsible for the high yield of benzaldehydes: (1) cleavage of the glycol intermediates; (2) further oxidative cleavage of the 1, 2 -phenyl migration product - <b>phenylacetaldehydes.</b> 	Chapter 5 describes a preliminary investigation on perfluoroalkylation reaction of styrene with [bis(trifluoroacetoxy) iodo]butane (32). p-t-Butylstyrene reacts with 32 in the presence of water produced moderate yields of hydroxyperfluorinated product, 1 -(4 -tert-butyl-phenyl) - 3, 3, 4, 4, 5, 5, 6, 6, 6 -nonafluoro-hexan- 1 -ol (73), along with 1 -(4 -tert-butyl- phenyl) - 2 -iodo-ethanol (72) and 1 -(4 -tert-butyl-phenyl) -ethane- 1, 2 -diol (74). Electrophilic addition of 32 on the C=C bond, hydration of the intermediate, and reductive elimination were believed to have been involved.
