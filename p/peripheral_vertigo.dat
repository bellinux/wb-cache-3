2500|$|Vertigo that {{is caused}} by {{problems}} with the inner ear or vestibular system, which is composed of the semicircular canals, the vestibule (utricle and saccule), and the vestibular nerve is called [...] "peripheral", [...] "otologic" [...] or [...] "vestibular" [...] vertigo. The most common cause is {{benign paroxysmal positional vertigo}} (BPPV), which accounts for 32% of all <b>peripheral</b> <b>vertigo.</b> Other causes include Ménière's disease (12%), superior canal dehiscence syndrome, labyrinthitis, and visual vertigo. [...] Any cause of inflammation such as common cold, influenza, and bacterial infections may cause transient vertigo if it involves the inner ear, as may chemical insults (e.g., aminoglycosides) or physical trauma (e.g., skull fractures).

40|$|Positional vertigo is {{a common}} {{neurologic}} emergency and mostly the etiology is peripheral. However, central diseases may mimic <b>peripheral</b> positional <b>vertigo</b> at their initial presentation. We here describe {{the results of a}} visual suppression test in six patients with spinocerebellar ataxia type 6 (SCA 6), a central positional vertigo, and nine patients with benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (BPPV), the major <b>peripheral</b> positional <b>vertigo.</b> As a result, the visual suppression value of both diseases differed significantly; e. g., 22. 5 % in SCA 6 and 64. 3 % in BPPV (p < 0. 001). There was a positive correlation between the visual suppression value and disease duration, cerebellar atrophy, and CAG repeat length of SCA 6 but they were not statistically significant. In conclusion, the present study showed {{for the first time that}} visual suppression is impaired in SCA 6, a central positional vertigo, but preserved in BPPV, the major <b>peripheral</b> positional <b>vertigo,</b> by directly comparing both groups. The abnormality in the SCA 6 group presumably reflects dysfunction in the central visual fixation pathway at the cerebellar flocculus and nodulus.

40|$|Dizziness can be {{classified}} mainly into 4 types: vertigo, disequilibrium, presyncope, and lightheadedness. Among these types, vertigo is a sensation of movement or motion due to various causes. The main causes of <b>peripheral</b> <b>vertigo</b> are {{benign paroxysmal positional vertigo}} (BPPV), acute vestibular neuritis (AVN), and Meniere’s disease. BPPV {{is one of the most}} common causes of <b>peripheral</b> <b>vertigo.</b> It is characterized by brief episodes of mild to intense vertigo, which are triggered by specific changes in the position of the head. BPPV is diagnosed from the characteristic symptoms and by observing the nystagmus such as in the Dix-Hallpike test. BPPV is treated with several canalith repositioning procedures. AVN is the second most common cause of <b>peripheral</b> <b>vertigo.</b> Its key symptom is the acute onset of sustained rotatory vertigo without hearing loss. It is treated with symptomatic therapy with antihistamines, anticholinergic agents, anti-dopaminergic agents, and gamma-aminobutyric acid-enhancing agents that are used for symptoms of acute vertigo. Meniere’s disease is characterized by episodic vertigo, fluctuating hearing loss, and tinnitus. It is traditionally relieved with life-style modification, a low-salt diet, and prescription of diuretics. However, diag-nosis and treatment of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>vertigo</b> can be difficult without knowledge of BPPV, AVN, and Meniere’s disease.

The literature provides many questionnaires to assess the outcome of rehabilitation programs for disequilibrium, but only for the Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) is an Italian translation available, validated on {{a small group of}} patients suffering from a <b>peripheral</b> acute <b>vertigo.</b> We translated and validated {{the reliability and validity of}} the DHI, the Situational Vertigo Questionnaire (SVQ), and the Activities-Specific Balance Confidence Scale (ABC) in 316 Italian patients complaining of dizziness due either to a peripheral or to a central vestibular deficit, or in whom vestibular signs were undetectable by means of instrumental testing or clinical evaluation. Cronbach’s coefficient alpha, the homogeneity index, and test–retest reproducibility, confirmed reliability of the Italian version of the three questionnaires. Validity was confirmed by correlation test between questionnaire scores. Correlations with clinical variables suggested that they can be used as a complementary tool for the assessment of vestibular symptoms.

40|$|Introduction: Vertigo {{prevalence}} {{is estimated}} to be 1. 8 % among young adults and more than 30 % in the elderly. 13 - 38 % of the referrals of patients over 65 years old in America are due to vertigo. Vertigo does not increase the risk of mortality but it can affect the patient’s quality of life. Therefore, {{this study was designed to}} evaluate the epidemiologic characteristics of vertigo patients referred to the emergency department (ED). Methods: In this 6 -month retrospective cross-sectional study, the profiles of all vertigo patients referred to the ED of Imam Hossein Hospital, Tehran, Iran, from October 2013 to March 2014 were evaluated. Demographic data and baseline characteristics of the patients were recorded and then patients were divided into central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>vertigo.</b> The correlation of history and clinical examination with vertigo type was evaluated and screening performance characteristics of history and clinical examination in differentiating central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>vertigo</b> were determined. Results: 379 patients with the mean age of 50. 69 ± 11. 94 years (minimum 18 and maximum 86) were enrolled (58. 13 % female). There was no sex difference in vertigo incidence (p = 0. 756). A significant correlation existed between older age and increase in frequency of central cases (p < 0. 001). No significant difference was detected between the treatment protocols regarding ED length of stay (p = 0. 72). There was a significant overlap between the initial diagnosis and the final decision based on imaging and neurologist’s final opinion (p < 0. 001). In the end, 361 (95. 3 %) patients were discharged from ED, while 18 were disposed to the neurology ward. No case of mortality was reported.

Posterior semicircular canal benign paroxysmal positional vertigo (PSC-BPPV) {{is the most common}} BPPV condition [2]. The incidence of horizontal semicircular canal BPPV (HSC-BPPV) is reported to range between 10 and 42. 7 % as the BPPV definition has been newly established and nystagmus recording techniques have advanced in recent years [3].

40|$|Betahistine {{hydrochloride}} is {{the drug}} of choice {{for the treatment of}} vestibular vertigo in the presence of benign paroxysmal positional vertigo, Meniere's disease, and vestibular neuronitis. Effective combination therapy regimens that contain, along with drugs from other pharmacological groups, betahistine hydrochloride that improves blood circulation in the vestibular structures, accelerates vestibular compensation, and prevents recurrent dizzy spells, have been elaborated to treat central vestibular vertigo in migraine-associated dizziness and in acute cerebrovascular accident. Of great importance is a combination of drug therapy and the current rehabilitation methods for vestibular diseases, which contribute to prompter and complete recovery of vestibular function. Biofeedback instrumental rehabilitation techniques using a stabilographic platform are highly effective. Successful treatment depends on the correctness of the established diagnosis. The diagnosis of <b>peripheral</b> and central vestibular <b>vertigo</b> frequently poses challenges. The essential reason for this is physicians’ unawareness about outpatient methods for the diagnosis of major vestibular diseases when the patient is at a doctor.

40|$|As L-type {{voltage-gated}} calcium channels (VGCCs) control Ca(2 +) influx and depolarisation {{of cardiac}} and vascular smooth muscle, {{they represent a}} specific therapeutic target for calcium channel blockers (CCBs), which are approved and widely used to treat hypertension, myocardial ischaemia and arrhythmias. L-type currents {{also play a role}} in calcium entry in the sensory cells of the inner ear. In hair cells of both cochlea and labyrinth, calcium cytoplasmic influx is the first physiological process that activates complex intracellular enzymatic reactions resulting in neurotransmitter release. Excessive calcium ion entry into sensory cells, as a consequence of L-VGCCs malfunction is responsible for over-activation of phospholipase A 2 and C, protein kinase II and C, nitric oxide synthase and both endonucleases and depolymerases, which can cause membrane damage and cellular death if the cytoplasmic buffering capacity is overcome. Nimodipine, a highly lipophilic 1 - 4 dihydropyridine that easily crosses the brain-blood barrier, is generally used to reduce the severity of neurological deficits resulting from vasospasm in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. Moreover, due to its selective blocking activity on L-channel calcium currents, nimodipine is also suggested to be an effective countermeasure for cochlear and vestibular dysfunctions known as channelopathies. Indeed, experimental data in amphibians and mammalians indicate that nimodipine has a stronger efficacy than other CCBs (aminopyridine, nifedipine) on voltage-dependent whole-cell currents within hair cells at rest and it is the only agent that is also effective during their mechanically induced depolarisation. In humans, the efficacy of nimodipine is documented in the medical management of <b>peripheral</b> vestibular <b>vertigo,</b> sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus, even in a pathology as complex as Ménière's disease. Nimodipine is also considered useful in the prophylaxis of damage to the facial and cochlear nerves caused by ablative surgery of cerebellopontine tumours; it has been recently hypothesised to accelerate functional recovery of recurrent nerve lesions during thyroid cancer surgery. Further trials with adequate study design are needed to test the efficacy of nimodipine in the treatment of vertigo due to cerebrovascular disease and vestibular migraine. As L-type voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) control Ca(2 +) influx and depolarisation of cardiac and vascular smooth muscle, they represent a specific therapeutic target for calcium channel blockers (CCBs), which are approved and widely used to treat hypertension, myocardial ischaemia and arrhythmias. L-type currents also play a role in calcium entry in the sensory cells of the inner ear. In hair cells of both cochlea and labyrinth, calcium cytoplasmic influx is the first physiological process that activates complex intracellular enzymatic reactions resulting in neurotransmitter release. Excessive calcium ion entry into sensory cells, as a consequence of L-VGCCs malfunction is responsible for over-activation of phospholipase A 2 and C, protein kinase II and C, nitric oxide synthase and both endonucleases and depolymerases, which can cause membrane damage and cellular death if the cytoplasmic buffering capacity is overcome. Nimodipine, a highly lipophilic 1 - 4 dihydropyridine that easily crosses the brain-blood barrier, is generally used to reduce the severity of neurological deficits resulting from vasospasm in patients with subarachnoid haemorrhage. Moreover, due to its selective blocking activity on L-channel calcium currents, nimodipine is also suggested to be an effective countermeasure for cochlear and vestibular dysfunctions known as channelopathies. Indeed, experimental data in amphibians and mammalians indicate that nimodipine has a stronger efficacy than other CCBs (aminopyridine, nifedipine) on voltage-dependent wholecell currents within hair cells at rest and it is the only agent that is also effective during their mechanically induced depolarisation. In humans, the efficacy of nimodipine is documented in the medical management of <b>peripheral</b> vestibular <b>vertigo,</b> sensorineural hearing loss and tinnitus, even in a pathology as complex as Ménière's disease.

40|$|Vestibular {{neuritis}} (VN) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common causes of <b>peripheral</b> <b>vertigo.</b> Caloric testing has been the traditional gold standard for detecting a peripheral vestibular deficit, but some recently developed bedside tests (head thrust, head heave, head shake and vibration test) were evaluated as a good alternative with similar sensitivity and specificity. These tests have shown both diagnostic value in the short term and prognostic value in the long term, and have availability and ease of use as an advantage. As an addition to clinical examination, vestibular evoked myogenic potentials can differentiate between involvement of superior and inferior branch of the vestibular nerve, but also between peripheral and central lesions. Although glucocorticoids are currently widely used in the treatment of VN, there is a lack of evidence for the validity of their administration. There are a number of high quality clinical trials that suggest vestibular rehabilitation exercises, which are based on the mechanisms of vestibular compensation, in the managment of VN. This review will focus on the latest developments in the pathophysiology, diagnosis and treatment of patients with VN...|$|E
40|$|Objectives: Methemoglobinemia {{could be}} a {{congenital}} or acquired condition. It causes clinical conditions ranging from simple cyanosis to hypoxia, lactic acidosis and death. Several cases of metoclopramide-induced methemoglobinemia both in infants and adults {{have been reported in}} literature. We aimed to investigate the incidence of metoclopramide-induced methemoglobinemia in our emergency department (ED). Methods: Adult patients who were admitted to the ED with renal colic, <b>peripheral</b> <b>vertigo,</b> acute gastroentiritis and vascular headache and who were given a single dose of 10 mg metoclopramide for nausea and/or vomiting were involved in the study. The total number of study sample was 270. Results: Of the 270 patients, 208 (77 %) were female and 62 (33 %) were male. Patients’ methemoglobin levels ranged between 0. 5 - 5. 20 gr/dl with an average value of 0. 97 gr/dl. There has been no significant difference found between methemoglobin levels and patients’ diagnoses, sex, age, comorbid diseases, and medications taken for comorbid factors. Conclusions: Although rarely seen, possibility of development of metoclopramide-induced methemoglobinemia following metoclopramide administration should be kept in mind...|$|E
40|$|Dizziness is a non {{specific}} and incapacitating symptom. Its classification {{is based on}} the patient complaints and categorized in pre-syncope, disequilibrium, lightheadness and vertigo. Vertigo is the most prevalent cause of dizziness. This article pretends to review the management of vertigo, its causes, differential diagnosis and treatment. The articles used in this review were obtained from a Medline search with the keywords vertigo and dizziness, from publications from the past 5 years in the English, Spanish and Portuguese languages. Vertigo is the most prevalent cause of dizziness in primary care. It is caused by an asymmetric involvement in the basal activity of the central and peripheric vestibular pathways. It occurs in episodes and the intensity of this symptom diminishes as the causative factor dissipates or compensation occurs. The clinical evaluation is bases on the clinical history and physical examination. The first step in the differential diagnosis is to differentiate central vertigo from <b>peripheral</b> <b>vertigo.</b> Knowing the duration of symptoms, precipitating factors and associated symptoms and performing the Dix-Hallpike manoeuvre is important in achieving this. The treatment of vertigo must be specific and oriented to the cause, and the use of symptomatic therapy must be reserved to the acute episodes. The definite treatment are rehabilitation exercises.

40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to assess the {{function}} of semicircular canal in videonystagmography head impulse test (VHIT) in the patients with vertigo and balance disorders. Material and Methods: The study was performed in 135 patients (86 women and 49 men) aged 22 – 79 years, who were divided into 2 groups: I (study group) – 73 patients with vertigo of peripheral, central or mixed origin, II (control group) – 62 patients without vertigo (healthy individuals). The function of canal was determined on the basis of GAIN and expressed as DG/RH× 100 % (where DG is deviation of gaze and RH is rotation of head). Results: In the study group the semicircular canal injuries were found in 37 (50. 69 %) patients, including 24 (32. 87 %) patients with 1 injury and 13 (17. 8 %) patients with 2 or more injuries in semicircular canal. The injured anterior semicircular canal was reported 13 times; the lateral – 9 times and the posterior – 31 times. Conclusions: In the study group, in the VHIT, injuries in semicircular canals were reported in <b>peripheral</b> <b>vertigo,</b> mixed vertigo with non-compensated and compensated function of the labyrinth in 50. 68 % cases, whereas in the caloric test dysfunction of the labyrinth was found in 58. 49 % cases...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIntroductionBenign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo (BPPV) is {{the most}} common {{peripheral}} vestibular disorder. The Dix-Hallpike and Roll maneuvers are used to diagnose BPPV. ObjectiveThis study aims to investigate the diagnostic value of repeated Dix-Hallpike and Roll maneuvers in BPPV. MethodsWe performed Dix-Hallpike and roll maneuvers in patients who admitted with <b>peripheral</b> <b>vertigo</b> anamnesis and met our criteria. The present study consists of 207 patients ranging in age from 16 to 70 (52. 67 ± 10. 67). We conducted the same maneuvers sequentially one more time in patients with negative results. We detected patients who had negative results in first maneuver and later developed symptom and nystagmus. We evaluated post-treatment success and patient satisfaction by performing Dizziness Handicap Inventory (DHI) at first admittance and two weeks after treatment in all patients with BPPV. ResultsOf a total of 207 patients, we diagnosed 139 in first maneuver. We diagnosed 28 more patients in sequentially performed maneuvers. The remaining 40 patients were referred to imaging. There was a significant difference between pre- and post-treatment DHI scores in patients with BPPV (p< 0. 001). ConclusionPerforming the diagnostic maneuvers only one more time in vertigo patients in the first clinical evaluation increases the diagnosis success in BPPV. Canalith repositioning maneuvers are effective and satisfactory treatment methods in BPPV...|$|E
40|$|Benign {{paroxysmal}} {{positional vertigo}} (BPPV) {{is the most}} common cause of <b>peripheral</b> <b>vertigo.</b> Numerous investigations have reported an increased BPPV incidence in females and in the aged population. The hormonal characteristics of BPPV patients have not been previously investigated. This study aimed to determine the risk of BPPV in relation to menopause in a population-based study. Materials and Methods: This retrospective population-based study was designed to use a nationwide longitudinal health insurance database to follow and analyze the incidence of and protective factors against BPPV in a Taiwanese population. Data Analyses: Univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to calculate the adjusted hazard ratio (aHR) for the incidence of BPPV using Cox-proportional regression models. Results: In the multivariate analyses, we found that older people (older than 65 years old) were more prone to develop BPPV (aHR: 5. 37, 95 % CI: 0 4. 83 – 5. 97, p 65 years old), patients who took estrogen for menopausal syndromes had a significantly lower incidence of BPPV (aHR; 0. 01, 95 % CI: 0. 06 – 0. 23, p < 0. 001). Conclusion: Our study provides a novel etiology and possible treatment method for the prevention of BPPV. Further studies may focus on the pathophysiological mechanism of estrogen in BPPV patients and the development of new drugs for the prevention and treatment of BPPV...|$|E
