40|$|Background: Myositis {{ossificans}} is localized inflammatory process affecting skeletal muscles. Very rarely it {{can affect}} {{one of the}} neck muscles and present as a neck tumor, it can be misdiagnosed as the clinical, radiological and histological examinations can mimic a sarcoma. Case Report: We report a 29 year old female patient with neck tumor suspected to be a sarcoma who underwent full diagnostics imaging and open bipsy with histopatological examination, afterwards surgical excision was performed. Conclusions: The {{aim of this study}} was to present the differential diagnosis based on diagnostics imaging between MO and malignant tumors, such as <b>parosteal</b> <b>sarcoma,</b> synovial sarcoma and malignant fibrous histiocytoma...|$|E
40|$|Nora's tumor, {{also known}} as bizzarre parosteal osteochondromatous {{proliferation}} (POPB), is an exophytic outgrowth arising from the cortical surface of the bone that consists of a mixture of bone, cartilage and fibrous tissue. It is a benign lesion with atipical microscopic features and a tendency to recur. It must be distinguishable from <b>parosteal</b> osteogenic <b>sarcoma,</b> <b>parosteal</b> chondrosarcoma, osteochondroma, florid reactive periostitis, turret exostosis, subungueal exostosis, myositis ossificans. The treatment is surgical, but {{a high rate of}} local relapse is described. The diagnosis is histological. We report a case of a patient with POPB involving the foot, underwent surgical excision and with no evidence of recurrence at one year...|$|R
