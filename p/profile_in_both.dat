5000|$|Returning {{from their}} first major concert tour, the boys were dropped off back at {{their homes in the}} {{projects}} and were given a check in the amount of $1.87 apiece for their efforts. Tour budget and expenses were given as the explanation as to why they were not paid more. Due to these financial reasons, New Edition parted company with Starr in 1984 (Starr responded by promptly creating the group New Kids on the Block, essentially formatted after New Edition, but with white teenagers.). Meanwhile, the group hired the law firm of Steven and Martin Machat and sued Streetwise for release from a contract that was unenforceable as well as materially breached by Streetwise. The Machats won the legal game and then secured the group a bigger recording deal with major label MCA Records, which won the bidding war among various other major labels. In need of management, the group signed with Steven Machat and his two management partners Rick Smith and Bill Dern. The management company, AMI, proceeded to escalate the group's <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> <b>both</b> the urban and pop music worlds. Through the production affiliate of AMI, Jump and Shoot, MCA released the group's self-titled second album the same year. Eclipsing their debut album, New Edition spun off the top five hit [...] "Cool It Now" [...] and the top twenty [...] "Mr. Telephone Man", and went on to be certified double platinum in the United States.|$|E

40|$|An {{experimental}} and mechanistic-modeling study is {{reported for the}} transient flow of aqueous foam through 1. 3 -{mu}m{sup 2 } (1. 3 -D) Boise sandstone at backpressures in excess of 5 MPa (700 psi) over a quality range from 0. 80 to 0. 99. Total superficial velocities range from as little as 0. 42 to 2. 20 m/day (1. 4 ft/day to 7 ft/day). Sequential pressure taps and gamma-ray densitometry measure flow resistance and in-situ liquid saturations, respectively. We garner experimental pressure and saturation <b>profiles</b> <b>in</b> <b>both</b> the transient and steady states. Adoption of a mean-size foam-bubble conservation equation along with the traditional reservoir simulation equations allows mechanistic foam simulation. Since foam mobility depends heavily upon its texture, the bubble population balance is both useful and necessary as the role of foam texture must be incorporated into any model which seeks accurate prediction of flow properties. Our model employs capillary-pressure-dependent kinetic expressions for lamellae generation and coalescence and also a term for trapping of lamellae. Additionally, the effects of surfactant chemical transport are included. We find quantitative agreement between {{experimental and}} theoretical saturation and pressure <b>profiles</b> <b>in</b> <b>both</b> the transient and steady states...|$|R

40|$|PSR B 1259 - 63 /LS 2883 is {{a binary}} {{system in which}} a 48 ms pulsar orbits around a Be star in a high {{eccentric}} orbit with a long orbital period of about 3. 4 yr. It is special for having asymmetric two-peak <b>profiles</b> <b>in</b> <b>both</b> the X-ray and TeV light curves. Recently, an unexpected GeV flare has been detected by the Fermi gamma-ray observatory several weeks after the last periastron passage. In this paper, we show that this observed GeV flare could be produced by the Doppler-boosted synchrotron emission in the bow-shock tail. An anisotropic pulsar wind model, which mainly affects the energy flux injection into the termination shock in a different orbital phase, is also used in this paper, and {{we find that the}} anisotropy in the pulsar wind can {{play a significant role in}} producing the asymmetric two-peak <b>profiles</b> <b>in</b> <b>both</b> X-ray and TeV light curves. The X-ray and TeV photons before periastron are mainly produced by the shocked electrons around the shock apex, and the light curves after periastron are contributed by the emission from the shock apex and the shock tail together, which result in asymmetric two-peak light curves. © 2012.
