5|$|Edmund McMillen from Team Meat, the {{developer}} of the indie game Super Meat Boy, created various accounts on PETA's official forums {{to try to}} get his game parodied by PETA. PETA developed Super Tofu Boy and released it in December 2010. It stars Tofu Boy, an anthropomorphic cube of tofu whose goal is to rescue Bandage Girl, the girlfriend of the original game's protagonist Meat Boy, from Meat Boy. It plays as a standard platformer and is <b>peppered</b> <b>with</b> inter-level pro-vegetarian messages and facts about meat consumption and the livestock industry.|$|E
5|$|Henry's men, {{the entire}} left wing, descended a bluff into {{the midst of}} several hundred Sauk and Fox warriors, and a desperate bayonet and musket battle followed. Women and {{children}} fled the fight into the river, where many drowned immediately. The battle continued for 30 minutes before Atkinson came up with Dodge's center element, cutting off escape {{for many of the}} remaining Native warriors. Some warriors managed to escape the fight to a willow island, which was being <b>peppered</b> <b>with</b> canister shot and gunfire by Warrior.|$|E
5|$|Mars (1.5AU {{from the}} Sun) {{is smaller than}} Earth and Venus (0.107 Earth masses). It has an {{atmosphere}} of mostly carbon dioxide with a surface pressure of 6.1 millibars (roughly 0.6% of that of Earth). Its surface, <b>peppered</b> <b>with</b> vast volcanoes, such as Olympus Mons, and rift valleys, such as Valles Marineris, shows geological activity that may have persisted until as recently as 2 million years ago. Its red colour comes from iron oxide (rust) in its soil. Mars has two tiny natural satellites (Deimos and Phobos) thought to be captured asteroids.|$|E

5|$|On Sword, 21 of 25 DD {{tanks of}} the first wave were {{successful}} in getting safely ashore to provide cover for the infantry, who began disembarking at 07:30. The beach was heavily mined and <b>peppered</b> <b>with</b> obstacles, making {{the work of the}} beach clearing teams difficult and dangerous. In the windy conditions, the tide came in more quickly than expected, so manoeuvring the armour was difficult. The beach quickly became congested. Brigadier Simon Fraser, 15th Lord Lovat and his 1st Special Service Brigade arrived in the second wave, piped ashore by Private Bill Millin, Lovat's personal piper. Members of No. 4 Commando moved through Ouistreham to attack from the rear a German gun battery on the shore. A concrete observation and control tower at this emplacement had to be bypassed and was not captured until several days later. French forces under Commander Philippe Kieffer (the first French soldiers to arrive in Normandy) attacked and cleared the heavily fortified strongpoint at the casino at Riva Bella, with the aid of one of the DD tanks.|$|E

The area {{is known for}} its massive {{reserves}} of crude oil, and contains both the National Petroleum Reserve–Alaska and the Prudhoe Bay Oil Field. Barrow, the northernmost city in the United States, is located here.

25|$|The {{majority}} of Thompson's {{most popular and}} acclaimed work appeared within the pages of Rolling Stone magazine. Along with Joe Eszterhas and David Felton, Thompson was instrumental in expanding {{the focus of the}} magazine past music criticism; indeed, Thompson was the only staff writer of the epoch never to contribute a music feature to the magazine. Nevertheless, his articles were always <b>peppered</b> <b>with</b> a wide array of pop music references ranging from Howlin' Wolf to Lou Reed. Armed with early fax machines wherever he went, he became notorious for haphazardly sending sometimes illegible material to the magazine's San Francisco offices as an issue was about to go to press.|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was (1) to develop a dehydrated <b>pepper</b> <b>with</b> 45 % humidity, determining the drying curves for <b>pepper,</b> <b>with</b> and without osmotic pre-treatment and (2) to evaluate the influence of both drying and osmotic treatment on the content ascorbic acid (vitamin C) in fresh <b>pepper</b> and <b>pepper</b> <b>with</b> 45 % humidity. The experiments were carried out using the peppers cut in half, with and without osmotic pre-treatment, followed by drying in an oven at 70 °C. The {{results showed that the}} osmotic pretreatment did not influence the retention of ascorbic acid during the drying of pepper. The sensory analysis regarding the color, flavor, and texture attributes revealed that {{there was no difference in}} the acceptability...|$|R

Ukrainian dances depicting Bukovynian music and dance is <b>peppered</b> <b>with</b> dichotomies and contrapuntal themes, perhaps reflecting the political histories of the region. In these dances, both men and women perform a variety of foot-stamps. Usually, the girls' headpieces are very distinctive, consisting of tall wheat stalks, ostrich feathers, or other unique protuberances. The embroidery on the blouses and shirts is typically stitched with darker and heavier threads, and women's skirts are sometimes open at the front, revealing an embroidered slip.|$|E
25|$|A large {{counter-attack}} {{was mounted}} on the French front on 22 March, which forced French cavalry and cyclists back over the Crozat Canal with many casualties but began too soon to ambush a large force that included artillery, as had been intended. A Booby-trap exploded in Bapaume town hall on 25 March, killing Australian troops and two French Deputies; French civilians were left behind at Bouvincourt, Vraignes and Tincourt on 26 March and Villers Faucon, Saulcourt and Guyencourt were lost on 27 March, to attacks by British cavalry and armoured cars. Supplies of armour-piercing bullets had been sent forward by the Germans after Roisel was captured the day before, resulting in the armoured cars being <b>peppered</b> <b>with</b> bullet-holes. The armoured cars decoyed the German defenders, while cavalry got round the flanks and captured the villages.|$|E

The randomize blok design was used 44 kind of arthropods. The status of arthropod are: fitofag (47. 73 %), omnivorus (6. 82 %), natural enemies (34. 09 %) and pollination (11. 36 %). Distribution of each species was various at each treatment, between 26 - 34 species.

The insect population of Acrididae, Tetrigidae, Grylidae (Orthroptera), Blattidae, Drosophillidae and Farmicidae always higher than an other insect. In this research were found 10 ordo of arthropod. Hymenoptera (Formicidae) and Araneida are dominant of arthropod and distributed at all treatment. Arthropod at pepper plant was the most abundant at <b>pepper</b> plan <b>with</b> A. pintoii. In the pepper standing plant it were only found three other, they are Hymenoptera, Araneida and Hemiptera.
