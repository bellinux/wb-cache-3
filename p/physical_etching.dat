These layers are selectively etched by photolithography and either a wet etch involving an acid or a dry etch involving an ionized gas, or plasma. Dry etching can combine chemical etching with <b>physical</b> <b>etching,</b> or ion bombardment of the material. Surface micromachining can involve as many layers as is needed with a different mask (producing a different pattern) on each layer. Modern integrated circuit fabrication uses this technique and can use dozens of layers, approaching 100. Micromachining is a younger technology and usually uses no more than 5 or 6 layers.

The shape of the electrode was chosen because all points of the cylinder surface are equivalent in this model system in the absence of magnetization and effects of the magnetic field can be easily separated from the effects of a different nature. The current density and Lorentz force are calculated in an electrolyte in the vicinity of the magnetized steel cylinder. The Lorentz force causes movement of an electrolyte perpendicular to the direction of the external magnetic field along the cylinder axis. Comparison of calculations with experimental data allows concluding that a certain part of paramagnetic ions in the electrolyte in a magnetic field represents the nanoclusters of paramagnetic ions, which can be for example nanobubbles.

As-received Cu prepared by a cold rolling process often has many defects [12, 15, 16], such as rolling lines, potential strains, impurities, and native oxide, which greatly impact the quality of the graphene. To improve the morphology of copper, a wide variety of pretreatment methods have been investigated, such as annealing [17 – 24], <b>physical</b> polishing [25], <b>etching</b> [15, 26], electro-polishing [13, 27 – 30], liquefying [31], and melting-resolidification [32].

With the rearranging of Cu surface atoms, releasing internal stress in copper and growing Cu crystal size, annealing has become an indispensable step in graphene growth [21 – 23]. However, limited by the formation of step bunching and evaporation of Cu atoms [23, 33], the surface of annealed Cu remains relatively rough which has a negative influence on graphene growth. Electro-polishing treatments can significantly improve the surface morphology of the substrate, which is critical to obtain homogenous graphene films as well as avoiding graphene adlayer formation [27, 34]. However, the defects of Cu such as etching pits and spike points are still hard to avoid by traditional electro-polishing techniques [28, 29].

Material analysis provides evidence of a titanium free etched surface with the crystallinity of the bulk lithium niobate remaining intact. The optical properties of the etched surface of lithium niobate also remain unaffected. These results {{provide insight into the}} <b>physical</b> mechanism causing <b>etching.</b> Evidence suggests that the etching is in fact hydrogen plasma etching that occurs in the proximity of the diffusing titanium strip. It is hypothesized that during titanium diffusion, charged ions originate at the interface of the lithium niobate/titanium interface, diffuse through the Ti film and emerge after some time at the surface. The charged ions react with water molecules and generate hydrogen which causes etching of the adjacent wafer. Control over etch depth was hence achievable through parameters that affect titanium diffusion such as annealing duration, titanium ¯lm thickness and patterned titanium strip widths. Optical waveguiding was observed under the etched trenches of narrow widths. These impurity free waveguides support both the ordinary and the extra-ordinary polarizations with modest transmission losses. This optical waveguiding phenomenon has been attributed to residual stress and offers great potential for high power handling and compact waveguiding. In summary, a novel and highly controllable etching technique has been discovered which creates smooth, precise features on the surface of lithium niobate without degrading material and optical properties. A physical and chemical model of the etching process is developed. This etching process is applied to the realization of impurity free stress waveguides and shows promise for the development of lithium niobate integrated optical systems with strong waveguides and compact grating reflectors...|$|R
30|$|Today, {{ferroelectric}} {{thin films}} {{have been identified}} as a promising candidate material for capacitors in the next generation ultra-large-scale integrated dynamic random access memories, infrared sensors, electro-optic, RF, and microwave devices [1 – 3]. Among the numerous ferroelectrics, barium titanate (BTO) thin films are {{known as one of the}} leading candidates for use in applications due to their high dielectric constant, low leakage current, lack of fatigue, and low crystallization temperature [4 – 6]. Currently, a new, green and environmentally friendly approach called aerosol deposition (AD) has attracted great interest to fabricate BTO, which is a low-temperature and low-cost method featuring room-temperature processing with high deposition rate and high density [7 – 9]. To realize highly integrated microelectronic silicon-based devices involving BTO films, dry etching processes should be developed [10, 11]. However, there is currently no feasible technology known for the etching of BTO films. In addition, the data concerning the etching properties of such films exhibit significant deviations from the results obtained from other studies conducted under similar conditions [12]. These obstacles have led to a misunderstanding of the basic effects of the BTO etching process and have hindered the optimization of this process. Therefore, the majority of the work conducted to understand the etching mechanisms has focused on elucidating the role of both <b>physical</b> and chemical <b>etching</b> effects. However, even after the SF 6 /O 2 /Ar-based over-etching process, a large amount of sticky black by-products (BaF 2 and TiF 4) is still observed on the desired etching area; moreover, BTO thin films exhibit relatively inferior electric properties than those in their bulk ceramic and single crystal counterparts [13]. The above-mentioned factors are influenced by the post-annealing process, which is essential for the cleanup of the by-products during the etching process and the densification of the BTO thin films. High annealing temperature is inevitable because the low-volatility compound BaF 2 requires more energy to break the Ba-F bonds [14]. Additionally, the annealing duration is indispensable for obtaining good quality crystalline BTO films [15, 16].|$|R
40|$|The area of {{nanotechnology}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} active fields in science today. It is often seen as the area that could lead to substantial progress in terms of finding new materials with new properties. In this respect, silicon nano-particles are found to be greatly attractive because of their significant technological implications. Considering different areas of research, the energy production, conversion and storage processes are definitely among the most important topics to be studied by science. The reason for that lies in the significant and immediate consequences of their related technology on the current society. Silicon has received a great interest in the energy storage field and is, in fact, considered as one the most promising chemical element for energy storage in modern electrochemical devices due to the fact that it can alloy with lithium. In this respect, energy storage based on lithium chemistry {{is one of the}} most advanced electrochemical system in terms of specific power and energy density. Accordingly, Li-ion batteries could be significantly improved in terms of volumetric and gravimetric energy density by using silicon as a negative electrode material. The aim of the present thesis is to find a complete pathway for the silicon nano-particles, from their synthesis to their final designed application: a negative electrode for Li-ion batteries. Since no conventional methods to produce silicon nano-particles have been already established, several synthesis routes have been explored: Electrochemical Etching, Spark Discharge Generation and Laser assisted Chemical Vapor Pyrolisys, respectively. In Chapter 2, the anodic dissolution of a p-type silicon wafer in a HF solution is discussed. Despite the fact that the reaction mechanism is rather complicated and involves many different <b>physical</b> parameters, electrochemical <b>etching</b> offers a simple way to produce porous silicon layers, which can be detached and fragmented into small nano-particles by means of sonication. A basic electrochemical cell is developed for this purpose, and the anodic dissolution of a p?doped silicon wafer was performed in a concentrated HF solution. A linear relation between the electrode mass loss and the current density used during the electrochemical etching confirms the reaction mechanism, where two electrons per atom of silicon etched are involved. More- over, with the current experimental conditions, a current density threshold is found. Below this current threshold, which corresponds to 20 mA/cm 2, porous silicon is no longer formed. Although the nano-particles production rate provided by the electrochemical etching is definitely not sufficient for batteries application, the morphological and optical properties of both the surface substrate and the nano-particles are considered very interesting for the application in optoelectronic devices. Strong ultra-violet luminescence is observed at room temperature for the resulting nano-particles suspended in ethanol. The position of the photoluminescence peak is found to be independent from the excitation wavelength, as it is determined by the interaction between the surface states and the selected solvent. Its position is evaluated by means of the quantum confinement effect, which is responsible for the energy gap widening between valence and conduction band. From the quantum confinement theory, the estimated size of the nano-particles is approximately 1. 2 nm. In Chapter 3 Spark discharge generation (SDG) of silicon nano-particles is discussed. The production rate of silicon nano-particles from intrinsic silicon electrodes by spark discharge is orders of magnitude smaller compared to metals, since less energy goes into a larger area at a lower rate. Replacing intrinsic silicon by boron-doped rods results in a considerable increase in the production rate, namely two orders of magnitude. Generally speaking, it can be concluded that particles can be generated from any semiconductor using spark discharge, as long as the resistance is kept sufficiently low by either n- or p-doping, heating the electrodes, or changing their shape to reduce the current path-length. Transmission electron micrographs revealed a rather narrow size distribution, comparable to SDG-prepared metal particles. By taking stringent measures to reduce the ingress of oxygen and water into the setup, the production of virtually pure, unoxidized silicon particles with a primary particle size of 3 - 5 nm is possible using doped silicon rods. Here the initial formed particles are used to getter oxygen from any source, before the actual production. A clear correlation between the color of the particles and the degree of oxidation is observed. This continuous technique can be combined with other steps, e. g. surface functionalization or the immediate impaction of freshly prepared nano-particles onto a substrate for several different applications. Whether or not spark discharge generation is suitable for the production of silicon particles depends on the particular application. In the case of battery and hydrogen storage applications, the high elemental Si content of 95 - 100 % implies more active material, which positively influences the energy content of both batteries and hydrogen storage materials. Since oxides inevitably act as diffusion barriers, their reduction or total elimination also results in higher reaction rates. With careful working and relatively simple measures, the purity can likely be further increased. Moreover, the size of the spark discharge produced nano-particles is also responsible for rapid reaction rates in the above-mentioned applications. Compared to liquid phase methods the production rate is however currently very low; the laboratory scale production rate is only of the order of 0. 1 mg/hr. Significant increases in the production rate are thus needed, since battery or hydrogen storage related applications require rather sizable quantities of materials. For this reason, future work will be focused on upscaling the production rate of spark discharge generation. This can be achieved by increasing the energy input per spark, the number of sparks per second and the number of spark gaps. The current production rate is well suitable for sensor applications though, where even the currently still limited laboratory scale production rate can provide sufficient material. The possibility of continuous operation, direct functionalization and application of the particles through impaction, makes spark discharge especially suited for sensor applications. The simplicity of the spark discharge setup is a real advantage, as there is for instance less need for safety measures related to the use of lasers and hazardous gases such as silane. Although of less importance for sensor applications, both laser ablation and laser pyrolysis also lack the good and simple possibilities for mixing as the use of different electrodes in a single spark gap offers. In Chapter 4 the mass production of silicon nano-particles via an im- proved and upscaled Laser assisted Chemical Vapor Pyrolisys reactor is presented. Silicon nano-particles are synthesized from a SiH 4 precursor in a N 2 atmosphere. The improvement of the setup consists in the design of a new reaction zone, which leads to a homogenous product in terms of size and composition. For these purposes the reaction zone has been studied in relation to the nozzle and the laser beam geometry. In particular, in order to have mono-dispersed nano-particles, it is important to match the laser beam in- tensity profile with the the gas velocity profile. In this way different gas elements have the same probability to absorb the same amount of energy, resulting in a uniform heating along the reaction zone and therefore in a mono-dispersed product. The concept results in a newly built reaction zone, consisting of a rectangular nozzle and a quasi-rectangular laser beam. The reaction zone is built into a new, flexible to use, reactor that is capable to produce highly pure nano-particles with production rates between 1 and 100 g/h. Its flexibility relies not only in the different types of material that can be produced, but also in the modular configuration of the reactor body towards the assembly pieces (i. e. : nozzles, hoods, probes). The new LaCVP set-up consists of a main core, the reaction chamber, extended with the following auxiliary units: gas supply system, CO 2 laser and optics, filtration section, pump and exhaust system, safety control unit (PLC). The effect of the laser power on the powder characteristics is analyzed and five different samples are chosen for a more extensive characterization. The products have been characterized via TEM, XRD, TGA and FTIR analyses and compared to a commercially available one (Aldrich). The synthesized products show a narrow size distribution and a small particle size compared to the commercial material. Both the particle size and the particle size distribution are found to be strictly dependent on the laser power used in the synthesis experiments. Silicon nano-particles are pure and chemically stable upon air exposure, due to a thin passivation layer on the particle surface. These three synthesis techniques have been investigated in order to select the most suitable one with respect to the final designated application of the nano-particles. The most promising technique, in terms of purity of the product, size and size distribution of the particles as well as its great capabilities in terms of production rate, it is found to be the LaCVP. Mass production via LaCVP of small silicon nano-particles allows for thin film composite preparation, their characterization and their application in high energy storage devices. Chapter 5 is the bridge between the synthesis step and the final application of the product. For most electronic and electrochemical applications, in fact, silicon nano-particles have to be incorporated in a real electrode|$|R
