6000|$|That {{mischief}} {{had been}} intended was obvious, {{for a piece}} of iron wire, bright as if cut with nippers at one end and broken off short at the other, had been driven right through the centre of the cable, so as to touch the inner wires--thus forming a leak, or conductor, into the sea. There could be no doubt that it had not got there by accident; neither had it been driven there during the making or shipping of the cable, for in that case the testings for continuity would have betrayed its presence before the starting of the expedition. The piece of wire, too, was the same size as that which formed the <b>protecting</b> <b>cover,</b> and it was of the exact diameter of the cable. There was also the mark of a cut on the Manilla hemp, where the wire had entered. It could have been done only by {{one of the men who}} were at work in the tank at the time the portion went over, and, strange to say, this was the same gang which had been at work there when the previous [...] "fault" [...] occurred.|$|E
5000|$|... 1901: The {{archaeologist}} Aurel Stein {{first visited}} Rawak during his First Central Asian expedition in April 1901. [...] At the site {{he found the}} large stupa which he described as 'by far the most imposing structure I had seen among the extant ruins of the Khotan region.' Part of the stupa, {{and almost all of}} the rest of the site, was covered by sand dunes, in places rising to about 25 ft. In places where the sand left the walls and structures uncovered, he found fragments of coloured stucco from the statues lying in the sand.His excavations over the following eight days uncovered 91 large stucco statues of buddhas and bodhisattvas, with smaller ones in between of attendant gods. The sand that filled the ruins also played a conserving role, protecting the stuccos from the fierce wind and holding them up where they would have collapsed on their own. Therefore, when Stein left the site, he replaced the sand he had removed, writing, 'All that could be done in the case of these large sculptures was to bury them again safely in the sand after they had been photographed and described, and to trust that they would remain undisturbed under their <b>protecting</b> <b>cover</b> — until that time, still distant it seems, when Khotan shall have its own local museum.' ...|$|E
50|$|The {{operation}} of the closure valve was to be critical:Along the upper surface of the pipe is a continuous slit or groove about two inches wide. This groove is covered by a valve, extending the whole length of the railway, formed of a strip of leather riveted between iron plates, the top plates being wider than the groove and serving to prevent the external air forcing the leather into the pipe when the vacuum is formed within it; and the lower plates fitting into the groove when the valve is shut, makes up the circle of the pipe, and prevents the air from passing the piston; one edge of this valve is securely held down by iron bars, fastened by screw bolts to a longitudinal rib cast on the pipe, and allows the leather between the plates and the bar {{to act as a}} hinge, similar to a common pump valve; the other edge of the valve falls into a groove which contains a composition of beeswax and tallow: this composition is solid at the temperature of the atmosphere, and becomes fluid when heated a few degrees above it. Over this valve is a <b>protecting</b> <b>cover,</b> which serves to preserve it from snow or rain, formed of thin plates of iron about five feet long hinged with leather, and the end of each plate underlaps the next {{in the direction of the}} piston's motion, thus ensuring the lifting of each in succession.|$|E

50|$|Wiedorfer's {{official}} Medal of Honor citation reads:He alone made {{it possible}} for his company to advance until its objective was seized. Company G had cleared a wooded area of snipers, and 1 platoon was advancing across an open clearing toward another wood when it was met by heavy machinegun fire from 2 German positions dug in {{at the edge of the}} second wood. These positions were flanked by enemy riflemen. The platoon took cover behind a small ridge approximately 40 yards from the enemy position. There was no other available protection and the entire platoon was pinned down by the German fire. It was about noon and the day was clear, but the terrain extremely difficult due to a 3-inch snowfall the night before over ice-covered ground. Pvt. Wiedorfer, realizing that the platoon advance could not continue until the 2 enemy machinegun nests were destroyed, voluntarily charged alone across the slippery open ground with no <b>protecting</b> <b>cover</b> of any kind. Running in a crouched position, under a hail of enemy fire, he slipped and fell in the snow, but quickly rose and continued forward with the enemy concentrating automatic and small-arms fire on him as he advanced. Miraculously escaping injury, Pvt. Wiedorfer reached a point some 10 yards from the first machinegun emplacement and hurled a handgrenade into it. With his rifle he killed the remaining Germans, and, without hesitation, wheeled to the right and attacked the second emplacement. One of the enemy was wounded by his fire and the other 6 immediately surrendered. This heroic action by 1 man enabled the platoon to advance from behind its protecting ridge and continue successfully to reach its objective. A few minutes later, when both the platoon leader and the platoon sergeant were wounded, Pvt. Wiedorfer assumed command of the platoon, leading it forward with inspired energy until the mission was accomplished.|$|E

Os cultivares apresentaram evento termico a 86, 77 e 95, 15 ‹C respectivamente, referente a desidratacao (perda de massa de 12, 71 % para IRGA 417 e 12, 19 % para BR-IRGA 409) e a 293, 97 e 292, 14 ‹C correspondente a degeneracao da materia organica e inorganica (- 70, 16 e - 75, 77 %, simultaneamente para cada amostra). Na faixa termica ilesa a qualquer evento de deterioracao (25 a 80 ‹C), os termogramas identificaram para a amostra IRGA 417 a 30, 2 ‹C e a 34, 2 ‹C para BR-IRGA 409 o fenomeno endotermico da gelatinizacao. Assim sendo, o processo de hidratacao proposto foi realizado nas temperaturas de 35, 45, 55, 60 e 65 ‹C por um periodo de 15 horas a fim de desencadear a gelatinizacao sem degradar o produto. Ao nivel de 95 % de confianca as amostras apresentaram as mesmas tendencias de hidratacao; com o aumento da temperatura houve acrescimo na taxa de absorcao. Condicoes testadas a 65 ‹C provocaram o rompimento da rasca, propiciando a perda de solidos soluveis para agua de maceracao. A densidade e o comprimento dos cultivares permaneceram invariaveis, enquanto o volume foi influenciado pelo ganho de umidade - expansao de 23, 5 e 27, 6 % para BR-IRGA 409 e IRGA 417, respectivamente. O raio, exclusivamente, foi sensivel a temperatura de 65 ‹C, em virtude do rompimento da camada protetora do grao. Micrografias (MEV) identificaram, a partir de 2 horas de processo, para todas as condicoes observadas, alteracao na estrutura morfologica do arroz; espacos intermoleculares presentes no grao in natura foram restaurados devido a gelatinizacao. A avaliacao da porosidade (BET) do grao durante a imersao apresentou dados inconclusivos em virtude da heterogeneidade da forma geometrica dos graos da mesma variedade. A cinetica do ganho de umidade das amostras foi estudada e representada por modelos empiricos. Entre os modelos matematicos explorados, o ajuste cinetico de primeira ordem, expos a menor qualidade de predicao (erro relativo de 3, 23. P. 5, 80 % e dispersao dos dados de 1, 16. SE. 2, 34 %Xbu). A equacao proposta por Weibull, contudo, delineou o melhor ajuste das respostas experimentais (93, 25. R 2. 97, 03) e apresentou os menores desvios das informacoes (0, 62. RMSE. 1, 82 %Xbu). Os modelos de Peleg, Pilosof e colaboradores e o modelo Singh e Kulshrestha estiveram correlacionados matematicamente. Os coeficientes, procedentes dos modelos, apontaram os ensaios realizados a 55 ‹C como eficazes em relacao ao periodo de processo e apresentaram os testes a 65 ‹C como propicios a desnaturacao de proteinas, retardando a difusao de agua inicial. Ao generalizar os modelos foi possivel satisfatoriamente predizer as principais tendencias do processo (desvio maximo de 10 %) sem a necessidade de ajuste de parametro.

Abstract: This study {{presents}} the thermal analysis (TGA/DTG and DSC) of the non processed rice grain, cultivar IRGA 417 and BR-IRGA 409 during the hydration process. The different cultivars had an thermal event registered at 86, 77 and 95, 15 °C, associated to the drying (loss of mass - 12, 71 % for IRGA 417 and - 12, 19 % for BR-IRGA 409) and at 293, 97 and 292, 14 °C {{corresponding to the}} organic and inorganic material degeneration (- 70, 16 and - 75, 77 %, simultaneously for each sample). In the thermal non destructive range (25 to 80 °C), the results identified to the sample IRGA 417 at 30, 2 °C and at 34, 2 °C for BR-IRGA 409 the endothermic phenomena of gelatinization. The hydration process proposed was realized in the temperatures 35, 45, 55, 60 and 65 °C {{for a period of}} 15 hours. At the level of significance of 95 % the confidence sample presented the same behavior during the hydration, {{in such a way that}} with the increase in the temperature it was observed an increase in the water soaking rate. The essay at 65 °C had a rush in the rice hulls, releasing solids to the water medium. The density and the axial rice dimension do not changed during the essay, while the volume was influenced by the increase of the water content, there was an swelling of 23, 5 and 27, 6 % for BR-IRGA 409 and IRGA 417, respectively. Surprisingly, the radius was an exception. It was sensible to the temperature of 65 °C, probably caused by the rupture of the grain shell that acts as a <b>protecting</b> <b>cover.</b> The images (MEV) identified, for instants larger than 2 hours of processing, for all the observed conditions, a modification on the structure of rice during the hydration process. As the hydration proceed, the previous intra molecular spaces present in non processed grain were filled probably ought to the gelatinization process. The evaluation of porosity (BET) of the grain during the immersion presented not conclusive results attributed to the non homogeneity of the grain geometry belonging to the same cultivar. The hydration kinetics was represented by empirical models. Among the mathematical models applied, the kinetic model of first order resulted in a poor quality of prediction. The proposed model by Weibull, however, showed the Best fit of the experimented results and presented the lower RMSE. The kinetic models of Peleg, Pilosof and the Singh & Kulshrestha were mathematically correlated. The constants adjusted showed the essays performed at 55 °C efficient related to the processing period. For the hydration experiments performed at 65 °C probably protein was denaturated, decreasing the initial water diffusion. In the generalizar the models was possible satisfactorily predict the main trends of the process (maximum deviation of 10 %) without the need for parameter setting.
