When {{financial}} operations in favour of the Germans in 1918 caused him trouble with the Allies of World War I, the bank was renamed Svensk Ekonomiebolaget. He was already a successful banker and businessman when he met first Willi Münzenberg who visited the Stockholm Youth Socialist Congress of 1917. Later, during the Bolsheviks aspirations to rebuild the Russian economy, it was Münzenberg's task to expand their modest <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> by floating a so-called [...] "workers' loan" [...] using his [...] "Workers International Relief" [...] (WIR). By means of this subterfuge the money used for buying machines and goods in the West looked like being the outcome of proletarian support, in reality it came directly from the Kremlin, confiscated from Russia's rich and the Church. Established in Berlin in the 1920s, Aschberg's Guarantee and Credit Bank for the East was charged with repayment of the WIR workers' loan, although {{he had not been}} very fond of it from its very beginning on and had even contributed to deep six it soon after the launch. Aschberg had already gained the Soviet leaders' esteem by being one of the main connections in the early years after 1917 in evading the international boycott on gold robbed by the Bolsheviks, which he offered on the Stockholm market after having the bullions melted down and given new markings.|$|E
40|$|Sustainability can {{be defined}} as {{maintaining}} or increasing society’s “genuine wealth ” or the pool of society’s capital. This <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> includes financial, physical, natural, and human capital. Sustainable natural resource management science is therefore fundamentally a capital management science. Natural resource management involves making tradeoffs across potential investments to maintain or enhance the <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> with a focus on natural capital. Making such tradeoffs, however, is complicated by the complexities of ecological and economic systems. Models are useful tools for exposing, analyzing, and aiding in making tradeoffs among potential natural resource management strategies or investments. This dissertation uses a variety modeling approaches to expose, analyze, and aid in making tradeoffs associated with thee fishery management problems.

The model addresses the problem of an investor with access to a limited <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital,</b> who makes sequential decisions on long-lasting investments, under uncertainty as to the timing or the quality of future opportunities. We derive optimal investment strategies for the cases where the return from investment is a convex or concave function, we present closed form solutions for commonly adopted return functions, and we evaluate how the optimal investment behavior should change when changes occur in the environment, or the underlying probability distributions. In addition, we analyze three modifications of the problem.

Since 1998 offshore CM bonds offered to the public have not been denominated in HK dollars probably because of concerns over the stability of HK's linked exchange rate and the differential credit ratings of the two economies. Even though HK has become increasingly well equipped to handle the clearing, settlement and custody of local and foreign currency bonds across its borders, it needs to continue to lobby for and attract CM government and corporate issues of foreign currency bonds (and Rmb bonds, if this were to be permitted) if it is to establish itself as a regional bond centre in Asia.

40|$|Biomedical {{innovation}} {{has become}} riskier, {{more expensive and}} more difficult to finance with traditional sources such as private and public equity. Here we propose a financial structure in which a large number of biomedical programs at various stages of development are funded by a single entity to substantially reduce the portfolio's risk. The portfolio entity can finance its activities by issuing debt, a critical advantage because a much larger <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> is available for investment in debt versus equity. By employing financial engineering techniques such as securitization, it can raise even greater amounts of more-patient capital. In a simulation using historical data for new molecular entities in oncology from 1990 to 2011, we find that megafunds of $ 5 – 15 billion may yield average investment returns of 8. 9 – 11. 4 % for equity holders and 5 – 8 % for 'research-backed obligation' holders, which are lower than typical venture-capital hurdle rates but attractive to pension funds, insurance companies and other large institutional investors...|$|E

40|$|Fire {{sales that}} occur during crises beg the {{question}} of why sufficient outside capital does not move in quickly to take advantage of fire sales, or in other words, why outside capital is so "slow-moving". We propose an answer to this puzzle {{in the context of an}} equilibrium model of capital allocation. Keeping capital in liquid form in anticipation of possible fire sales entails costs in terms of foregone profitable investments. Set against this, those same profitable investments are rendered illiquid in future due to agency problems embedded with expertise. We show that a robust consequence of this trade-off between making investments today and waiting for arbitrage opportunities in future is the combination of occasional fire sales and limited stand-by capital that moves in only if fire-sale discounts are sufficiently deep. An extension of our model to several types of investments gives rise to a novel channel for contagion where sufficiently adverse shocks to one type can induce fire sales in other types that are fundamentally unrelated, provided arbitrage activity in these investments is sourced from a common <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital.</b> ...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} decade venture capital markets {{around the world have}} {{experienced}} growth both in terms of capital under management and the number of venture capital firms providing finance. Despite this there is growing evidence that a 'funding gap' exists at the earliest stages of new firm development. This paper provides an initial investigation into crowdfunding, identifying how it may be appropriately adopted within the start-up equity-financing context so as to contribute to the aggregated <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> available to new (pre-commercial) ventures. An agency theoretical perspective is adopted to investigate the necessary agency-cost control mechanisms unique to emerging crowdfunding models. Given the relational character of the investment process, the venture capitalist's perceptions of agency dynamics in the investorinvestee relationship provide an appropriate lens for analysing the likely acceptance of crowdfunding in start-up financing. Data are drawn using a qualitative methodology (convergent interviews) with Australian venture capitalists that provide early stage financing. A total of 11 venture capitalists were interviewed before convergence of common themes was reached. Results suggest that agency dynamics in crowdfunding models in start-up financing comprise a combination of investor specific factors, and ex-ante and ex-post investment factors.

The 2 ̆ 018 poverty multiplier theory 2 ̆ 019 postulates that: (i) one unit of currency deposited abroad represents a loss in financial development at home (ii) a fraction of the unit currency placed in foreign bank accounts is redirected to the domestic economy in the form of external debt. This external debt is further siphoned overseas through interest and loan principal repayment. Policy implications of these processes are discussed...|$|E

In 2001 (the latest year for which data from Form 5500 filings are available), roughly $ 130 billion was paid in {{benefits}} to 11 million recipients.

40|$|It {{is by now}} a trite commonplace {{that we live in}} an {{increasingly}} integrated global economy, in which the barriers to the free movement of goods and capital, though not labor, are rapidly disappearing as a result of both policy reforms and the progress of technology in transport and communications. The rhetoric as well as the substance of national economic policy is now preoccupied with the problem of how each country can hope to survive and prosper in a world where capital controls and trade restrictions are off the agenda.

With the global <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> at any instant restlessly searching for the highest return, regardless of borders, a popular prescription has come to be the provision of public infrastructure and the training and education of the labor force.

40|$|The {{paper by}} Philip Lane {{looks at the}} role of {{external}} funding in the funding of infrastructure. He starts with a review of literature which is, in large part, a review of Philip’s own work. This is appropriate given that the body of work he has put together, particularly with Gian Maria Milesi‑Ferretti, is the standard-setter {{when looking at the}} issue of cross-border financial stocks and flows. The difference between Lane’s paper and the previous paper in this session by Marcel Fratzscher is primarily one of frequency. Fratzscher’s paper examines weekly data while Lane’s paper utilises decadal data. Lane uses this analysis of the data on external positions to examine the role of foreign capital flows in funding infrastructure. He notes that accessing this larger <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> available offshore for infrastructure reduces the likelihood of crowding out that could occur if only domestic funding were sought. I am not sure I would completely agree with this argument. Capital is essentially fungible, so there is no particular reason (on this grounds) why offshore funding is more desirable for funding infrastructure rather than any other part of the economy where desired investment or spending exceeds savings. For example, infrastructure could be entirely domestically funded, but other areas of corporate activity could be funded from abroad...|$|E
40|$|Special-purpose {{acquisition}} companies (SPACs) are {{publicly held}} investment funds with no operations {{of their own}} but a <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> that is set up to acquire or merge with an operating business. Using a sample of 115 U. S. listed SPACs, that completed IPOs between January 2007 and December 2012, {{we find that the}} stock market performance of SPACs is extremely poor. Median 12 month BHAR return is - 66. 71 percent, and only exceptionally do SPACs produce positive returns. We attribute this result to shareholder dilution, enormously unbalanced sponsor incentives and intense competition from actors such as banks and private equity firms. While we find few significant factors that can help investors predict the return performance of SPACs, we find several factors that affect investor behavior. This may be an indication that outside investors misjudge what the true determinants of SPAC performance are. From the perspective of firms that are acquired by SPACs we find that the cash contributions by SPACs are small and that, in many cases, SPAC-mergers effectively increase the debt of the target company without providing any additional cash. Furthermore, our evidence suggests that SPAC-mergers are significantly overpriced, and that taking firms public in this way therefore primarily benefits the selling shareholders of the target firm. </p...|$|E
40|$|Australia has {{suffered}} {{in line with}} other nations from the recession of the 1970 s. Behind the downturn lay a major structural change in the economies of Western Nations; a change which resulted from the movement from a system of monopoly capitalism to one of global capitalism. Much {{attention has been paid}} to the rise of multinational manufacturing corporations in this process; relatively little to the fundamental revision of the world's capital markets. The process of change began with the shortcomings of the Bretton Woods system and the rise of the Eurocurrencies. A vast and undisciplined international capital market was created, the hallmarks of which were highly volatile exchange rates and a greatly expanded <b>pool</b> <b>of</b> <b>capital</b> which was very mobile. The power of individual governments to control the system was reduced, and the new system was organized through a group of key global cities which operated the market throughout the world on a twenty-four-hour basis. A fourfold hierarchy of centres evolved. In Australia there was an historic transition from the dominance of Melbourne to that of Sydney as a result of the changing world scene. The growth of the international markets had produced a revolution in the distribution of wealth and activities throughout the world. The problems resulting from this have called for a regulatory body to control the new system. The prospects for creating such a body are clouded by the scale of the problem and by the lack of understanding of its causes.
