Rookie Conor Daly who had been leading the race from laps 39 to 50 was finally forced to pit during the yellow, cycling the lead to Sébastien Bourdais. Racing resumed 3 laps later until a multi-car crash in lap 55 once again involving Coletti as well as Sage Karam and Jack Hawksworth occurred in Turn 3.

40|$|A tracheid-level {{model was}} used to {{quantify}} the effects of differences in wood microstructure between coastal and interior Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Fran-co var. menziesii and var. glauca) wood on larger scale proper-ties like hydraulic conductivity. The model showed that tra-cheid length, the ease of flow through a bordered pit and effective tracheid diameter can all limit maximum hydraulic conductivity. Among the model parameters tested, increasing bordered pit conductivity and tracheid length resulted in the greatest increase in maximum conductivity in both the inland and coastal ecotypes. A sensitivity analysis of the uncertainty between parameters governing flow through the bordered pit and air-seeding potential showed that, although decreased pit flow resistance increased maximum hydraulic conductivity, in-creased cavitation led to lower conductivity over time. The benefits of {{increasing the number of}} bordered pits depended on the intensity of the meteorological driving function: in drier en-vironmental conditions, wood with fewer pits was more con-ductive over time than wood with more <b>pits.</b> <b>Switching</b> the bor-dered <b>pit</b> characteristics between coastal and interior wood indicated that the conductivity time course of coastal and inte-rior wood was primarily governed by differences in the number of bordered pits and not differences in tracheid dimensions. The rate at which tracheids refilled had little effect on the con-ductivity time course of either coastal or interior wood during the first two summers when the wood was highly saturated, but had a marked influence in subsequent years once the cavitation profile stabilized. Our work highlights the need for more em-pirical work on bordered pits to determine whether variation in their number and properties is related to changing environmen-tal conditions. In addition, a detailed simulation model of a bordered pit is needed to understand how variation in pit prop-erties affects the relationship between ease of flow through a bordered pit and its potential for facilitating air-seeding...|$|R
5000|$|After a slow start, Button {{caught and}} passed the heavier Renault of Alonso at turn {{thirteen}} for third place and set off after Trulli. Rosberg and Trulli stopped for fuel earlier than Button, {{who was able to}} pass them during the first round of pit stops and take the lead. Evidence of rain was barely noticed, but Kimi Räikkönen <b>pitted</b> to <b>switch</b> from dry to full wet tyres. However, his gamble did not pay off, as rain did not come as early as predicted, and he was forced to slow down significantly to delay the rapid wear of the wet tyres. (Without standing water on the track, wet tyres will not maintain structural integrity at high speeds, and will rapidly degrade {{over the course of a}} few laps.) ...|$|R
50|$|Due to Christijan Albers' {{departure}} from the Spyker F1 Team, Winkelhock was called in for the 10th race of the season, the European Grand Prix. Winkelhock started last on the 22-car grid alongside team mate Adrian Sutil. But on the formation lap {{with the rest of}} the field already on dry-weather tyres, the team made a last-second decision to call Winkelhock into the <b>pits</b> to <b>switch</b> to intermediate tyres. When pouring rain forced almost all the others to pit at the end of the first lap, Winkelhock was able to move into the lead, passing some cars as they pitted, and even passing Kimi Räikkönen on the track as the Finn tip-toed around to the pits, eventually building a lead of 19 seconds by the end of the second lap. By lap 4 he had a lead of 33 seconds over Ferrari's Felipe Massa in 2nd place.|$|R
40|$|The {{transition}} from open pit (OP) to underground (UG) {{is one of}} the challenging mining engineering issues. The mines which have the potential to make {{transition from}} OP mining to UG mining will eventually come to a point introduced as a ‘Transition Point’ where it needs to determine whether to extend the <b>pit</b> or <b>switch</b> to UG mining. This research proposes a new integer programming (IP) formulation to obtain the optimal transition point from OP to UG mining. The proposed model has been implemented on a three-dimensional (3 -D) gold deposit and a two-dimensional (2 -D) case study has been used to demonstrate the validity of the model. Due to the large number of variables, strategies have been proposed to shorten the solution time. The proposed model has successfully determined the optimal transition point and generated significantly better undiscounted profit than that of the traditional approach...|$|R

50|$|After ten laps, Massa {{had built}} up a lead of over three seconds to Hamilton and Räikkönen was a further seven seconds behind Hamilton. On lap twelve, Alonso was the first driver {{who came into the}} <b>pits.</b> He <b>switched</b> his super-soft tyres for the soft {{compound}} tyres and rejoined {{at the back of the}} field. Two laps later, teammate Nelson Piquet, Jr. lost control of his car and hit the wall at Turn 17, blaming his hard tyres for the accident. This resulted in the first safety car period of the race. The two Red Bull cars and Rubens Barrichello managed to come into the pits before it was closed. With very little fuel left, Rosberg and Kubica had no choice but to pit despite the pit lane being closed. Barrichello's Honda then had a mechanical failure and became the second retirement of the race. After all the cars were behind the safety car, the pit lane was opened and nearly all the drivers pitted.|$|R
50|$|Lap 8 {{confirmed}} that Ricciardo had damaged his front wing when he <b>pitted</b> to <b>switch</b> to the medium tyre and swap his damaged front wing {{for a new}} one. Button complained on the radio about his rear tyres losing performance while the Lotus looked very strong as Räikkönen again put the DRS to good use and claimed Alonso on the 9th lap for 5th position. Button, Massa and Nico Rosberg all pitted together with Button coming out into 'clean air' however Rosberg and Massa rejoined behind a Marussia. The next lap saw Hamilton, Webber, and Alonso all pit together in that order but Hamilton {{had a problem with}} the left rear and was stopped for nearly ten seconds forcing a slow pit time of 28.341 seconds, dropping him behind Alonso, Button and Rosberg. Compounding Hamilton's problems, on the straight before turn 4 Rosberg desperately forced Hamilton wide and off-road but could not hold Hamilton back from taking the position. The incident was to be looked at after the race. Replays showed Hamilton's disappointment as he shook his head while waiting to be released.|$|R
50|$|With 10 laps remaining, {{the first}} six drivers were split by fewer than four seconds. On lap 69 and Vergne <b>pitted</b> to <b>switch</b> to {{intermediate}} tyres; the only driver {{to do so in}} the race. Still behind Kovalainen, Button locked up his brakes next to the swimming pool and spun. That left Pérez behind him to attack the Caterham, which Pérez succeeded in passing. Vergne's move to intermediate tyres had not worked, as he was losing over seven seconds every lap to his rivals. Two laps after Button spun, he had caught back up to Kovalainen. Button attempted an overtake on Kovalainen around the outside of turn 1. Button, who was able to brake later in his McLaren, launched down the outside of Kovalainen in the braking zone of turn 1. At the same time Kovalainen moved left and the Finn's front wing hit Button's front right tyre, causing a puncture on the McLaren, and Kovalainen damaged his front wing. A subsequent pit stop for Kovalainen put him down to 13th place, meanwhile Button retired from the race due to his puncture.|$|R
30|$|The {{focus of}} this work is to examine {{theoretically}} multiple Fano resonances in two kinds of layered plasmonic nanostructures; the gold–silica–gold multilayered nanoshell (MNS) and double nanoshells (DNS). The MNS contains a spherical metallic core, a dielectric spherical shell, and an external metal spherical shell while the DNS contain two alternative layers of metal and dielectric. Higher-order tunable Fano resonances with large modulation depth are obtained in both the MNS and DNS nanostructures for the symmetric and asymmetric cases. The multiple Fano resonances in DNS nanostructure are obtained {{for the first time}} in this paper. Previous study on DNS nanostructures was restricted only to single Fano resonance that arises in the symmetric case. Here, the influence of symmetry breaking over the optical response of DNS nanostructure is studied for the first time to achieve multiple Fano resonances. The optical response of both the MNS and DNS nanoparticles is compared at the end and the MNS is found to exhibit Fano resonances with large modulation depth. These asymmetric Fano line shapes with steep variations are typically suitable for three-dimensional plasmon ruler [34], Plasmon-Induced Transparency (<b>PIT)</b> [35], <b>switching</b> [36], multi-wavelength SERS, and plasmon line shaping by modifying the plasmon line at various spectral locations simultaneously [7, 30].|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Soudan State Park {{contains}} Minnesota’s first iron {{mine and}} offers tours through {{parts of the}} old underground mine workings. The mine began in 1884 as an open <b>pit</b> before <b>switching</b> to an underground operation in 1892. U. S. Steel operated the mine from the 1920 's until it closed in 1962. The average mine dewatering discharge is around 60 gallons per minute and contains copper and cobalt {{in excess of the}} permit standards of 0. 020 mg/L copper and 0. 005 mg/L cobalt. Annual average concentrations have varied from 0. 083 to 0. 5 mg/L copper and 0. 006 to 0. 026 mg/L cobalt. Despite at least 60 years of discharge, all the copper and cobalt are removed in about a 5 -acre portion of a downstream wetland. Copper concentrations in the peat ranged from around 100 to 3380 mg/kg, and cobalt from 20 to 260 mg/kg. Both metals are strongly bound to the peat; less than 0. 5 % was removed in laboratory extraction tests About 94 % of the total copper and 44 % of the total cobalt come from one area in the mine. In 1998, DNR proposed to treat this water in an organic substrate/ limestone bed. Remaining low levels of metals in the mine discharge would b...|$|R
50|$|After {{the safety}} car period, Webber {{began to make}} his way through the field before {{becoming}} stuck behind the Sauber of Esteban Gutiérrez. He was unable to pass the Mexican for more than ten laps and pitted to try to get an advantage with fresh tyres and clean air. Meanwhile, the McLaren drivers were once again having a tussle, with Jenson Button getting past Sergio Pérez at turn one. Pastor Maldonado, driving in the 600th grand prix race for the Williams F1 Team, was in the points in eighth, along with his team-mate and rookie Valtteri Bottas in tenth. Räikkönen was leading on lap 41 after Vettel and Grosjean had pitted for the third time. Lotus waited until lap 49 to <b>pit</b> Räikkönen, <b>switching</b> him to the soft tyre, which left Vettel and Grosjean in first and second, with Alonso a threat from behind in fourth place. Grosjean was then told on the radio to not hold Räikkönen up, for championship title points reasons. It took a few laps for Räikkönen to pass Grosjean and afterwards he attempted to chase down Vettel. Alonso set the fastest lap of the race, almost a second faster than the first three drivers, and was rapidly catching Grosjean. Meanwhile, Hamilton made a move on his former team-mate Button at turn two, moving into fifth. Webber then made a move on Pérez to go into seventh.|$|R

The race was neutralised on the same lap because of Adam Carroll's stalled car and when the race restarted one lap later Vergne challenged di Grassi for the lead and passed him on lap three. Di Grassi lost second place to Buemi shortly afterwards and the Swiss driver moved into the lead after overtaking Vergne on the sixth lap. Buemi kept the lead after the mandatory <b>pit</b> stops to <b>switch</b> into his second car but despite having trouble with braking {{in a straight line}} Buemi remained in first place {{for the remainder of the}} event to secure the victory. There were four lead changes among four different drivers during the course of the race.|$|R
50|$|Oliver Turvey won {{the pole}} {{position}} after Daniel Abt was penalised for a tyre pressure infringement and maintained his advantage {{on the first}} lap. He came under pressure from José María López until {{he retired from the}} race with power issues, handing the lead to López. Di Grassi and Jérôme d'Ambrosio made early <b>pit</b> stops to <b>switch</b> into their second cars and di Grassi became the leader on lap 26 {{when the rest of the}} field made their stops. D'Ambrosio held off pressure from Vergne for second place until he was passed by the driver on the 43rd lap and di Grassi remained the leader for the rest of the race after conserving electrical energy to win. There were three lead changes among four different drivers and three safety car periods during the course of the race.|$|R
5|$|Due to {{the rain}} that had fallen, the drivers went out on track on {{intermediate}} tyres {{at the beginning of}} Q3. On these tyres, Hamilton set the fastest time, followed by Button and Ricciardo. The track dried quickly however, and soon the cars returned to the <b>pit</b> lane to <b>switch</b> to slick tyres. Hülkenberg twice set the fastest time, but was beaten to pole position by Hamilton. Rosberg went faster as well, but lost his second place on the grid to Hülkenberg due to his five-place grid penalty. Vettel went fourth fastest, but was relegated as well, handing third on the grid to Button, who had set the fifth fastest time. Räikkönen, Ricciardo, Valtteri Bottas, Verstappen and Felipe Massa rounded up the top ten. It was Hülkenberg's second front row start of his career, the first having been his pole position at the 2010 Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|R

Lynn stopped his car on track nine laps later, prompting a full course yellow flag, and several drivers made <b>pit</b> stops to <b>switch</b> into their second cars. Bird chose to remain on track for one additional lap, and emerged back in first position with extra electrical energy. Bird opened up a healthy advantage over the rest of the field, crossing the start/finish line after 49 laps to win the event. There was one lead change among two different drivers during the course of the race.|$|R

5|$|Nelson Piquet Jr. won {{the pole}} {{position}} by recording the fastest lap in qualifying and maintained his startline advantage {{on the first}} lap. He {{pulled away from the}} rest of the field and held first place until he collided with a barrier after swerving to avoid José María López's crashed car on the 17th lap allowing Sam Bird to move into the lead. Some drivers elected to make <b>pit</b> stops to <b>switch</b> to their second cars with Bird choosing to remain on the circuit until his own stop eight laps later. He had technical problems with his second car and Buemi inherited the first position. Di Grassi was no more than two seconds behind Buemi but was unable to get close enough to challenge him because he had to conserve electrical energy usage and Buemi remained the leader for the rest of the race to win.

25|$|Buemi won {{the pole}} {{position}} by recording the fastest time in qualifying and held off {{an attack by}} second-placed starter Jean-Éric Vergne to keep the lead {{at the beginning of}} the race. Buemi pulled away from Vergne but his advantage was reduced to nothing when a crash between championship rival Lucas di Grassi and António Félix da Costa on the 16th lap neutralised the event. All drivers, including Buemi, made their mandatory <b>pit</b> stops to <b>switch</b> into their second car. Buemi regained the lead three laps after the restart from Mike Conway when the latter made his own stop. Vergne crashed on lap 34 which caused the deployment of the safety car and Buemi fended off an attack by López at the restart four laps later. He held the lead for the remainder of the race to secure the victory. There were three lead changes among three different drivers during the course of the race.|$|R
50|$|All the jostling behind Vettel {{helped him}} to gain a two-second lead {{by the end of}} the first lap. That was soon erased out by Massa and Alonso who rapidly caught up. Jenson Button made his first <b>pit</b> stop to <b>switch</b> from the super-softs to the medium tyres after just four laps and was {{followed}} by many others. Webber lost even further time and places during this period with a slow pitstop due to an issue with his jacks. The leaders elected to stay longer than the others, Vettel waiting for seven laps before pitting, Massa eight and Alonso and Räikkönen two laps further. The quartet rejoined in the same order, but more spread out due to Vettel and Massa gaining an extra lap on the new set of tyres. Hamilton and Rosberg, having realized that they did not have the pace of those in front, ran till lap 13 and 14 respectively in order to attempt a two-stop strategy.|$|R

50|$|In the 3rd {{practice}} {{session of the}} , Verstappen had a small crash into the outside barrier of turn three. In Q1, Verstappen clipped the inside barrier in turn fifteen with his front right tire, breaking the steering linkage, pitching the car into the outside barrier of turn sixteen. Ricciardo qualified 1st, securing his first ever pole position, three-tenths of a second faster than 2nd place Rosberg. Verstappen had {{to apply to the}} stewards for permission to start the race because he failed to set a qualifying time within the 107% rule. Verstappen elected to start the race from pit lane in front of Felipe Nasr, who also failed to set a time within the 107% rule. The race started behind the safety car due to wet conditions. After the safety car came in, Ricciardo was able to build a thirteen second gap ahead of Hamilton. Ricciardo came into the <b>pits</b> to <b>switch</b> to intermediate tyres, while Hamilton stayed on the extreme wet weather tyres. Ricciardo was able to reduce the gap to Hamilton to half of a second. Hamilton pitted for dry weather tyres, with Ricciardo following suit the next lap, lap 31. Ricciardo's pit crew did not have tyres ready to put onto his car, resulting in a very long stop, narrowly handing the lead to Hamilton. Ricciardo finished the race in 2nd. After the start of the race, Verstappen was able to fight his way into the top ten. On lap 34, Verstappen crashed into the barriers, retiring himself from the race.|$|R
5000|$|Race Summary: Earlier {{in the day}} a heavy {{rainstorm}} {{passed through}} the area, drenching the track. However, {{by the start of}} the race the sun was coming out and the track began to dry. However, the league had declared the race a [...] "wet race" [...] and all cars were to start on rain tires. On the first lap, Mario Romancini ducked into the <b>pits</b> to <b>switch</b> to slick tires, a move that every car would eventually make, however most waited until laps 8 to 10 to make their stops. Indy Lights teams do not normally make pit stops and the cars had to be jacked up by a manually powered [...] "quick jack" [...] one half at a time. In addition each wheel nut is held in place by a retaining pin that must be removed and replaced when changing a wheel. This, along with the fact that many teams were not prepared to make pit stops meant that most stops were over 1 minute long. However, AGR-AFS Racing's two cars, J. R. Hildebrand and Sebastian Saavedra were able to pit much faster as, according to their team owner Gary Peterson, they do practice pit stops. Hildebrand left the pits with the lead however, Saavedra's car was much faster. Once a passing lane had dried enough to attempt a pass, Saavedra worked his way past on lap 18 and drove away for his second win of the season. The race had no caution flags or major incidents and only two cars retired from the race due to mechanical issues.|$|R
25|$|Di Grassi won {{the pole}} {{position}} for the first race by recording the fastest lap in qualifying and held off an challenge from Sarrazin to maintain the lead {{at the start of}} the event. He pulled away from the field and attention focused on his championship rival Sébastien Buemi, demoted from second to twelfth on the grid for changing his battery, after sustaining steering arm damage on the first lap but was able to move up the field during the course of the race. The race was neutralised with a full course yellow flag when Loïc Duval and Nick Heidfeld collided on the 14th lap. Most drivers made <b>pit</b> stops to <b>switch</b> into a second car and di Grassi remained the leader following the end of the pit stops. Sarrazin ceded second to teammate Vergne who then started to draw closer to di Grassi but his chase was neutralised when López crashed on lap 24, necessitating the safety car's deployment. Di Grassi kept the lead at the restart five laps later and held off Vergne for the remainder of the race to secure his second victory of the season and the sixth of his career. No lead changes occurred as di Grassi was the only driver to lead laps in the first race.|$|R
50|$|A {{maximum of}} fifty-nine points were {{available}} for the final ePrix which meant Buemi could still win the title if di Grassi won both races and Buemi took two pole positions and finished second twice. A heavy shunt in the second practice session by Buemi prompted his team to construct a new car around a spare monocoque, but was handed a ten-place grid penalty for changing his battery. Di Grassi clinched his third career pole position by going 0.196 seconds quicker than Buemi in qualifying but the latter's penalty demoted him to 12th. When the race started, di Grassi fended off an attack from Sarrazin to lead the first lap. Buemi drove conservatively and was thus delayed in a tight pack of cars and sustained steering damage from contact with Robin Frijns. While di Grassi pulled away to establish a healthy lead, attention switched to Buemi who fought back through the field to gain places. On the 14th lap, Heidfeld attempted to pass Duval but the driver defended his position and the two made contact. Duval continued driving but Heidfeld sustained front-right suspension damage and the full course yellow procedure was activated to allow his stricken car {{to be removed from}} the track. This prompted most of the field to enter the <b>pit</b> lane and <b>switch</b> into their second cars.|$|R
50|$|Of the 20 cars {{which started}} the race, Sutil had gained the most places {{by the second}} safety car period. The Force India started from 18th, rose one place after Kovalainen was pushed back to the pit lane, passed Piquet on the second lap and Bourdais a lap later. Sutil benefited as Button, Rosberg, Glock and Trulli made pit stops for repairs over the {{following}} laps, to sit in 11th by lap 14. Alonso, on extreme wet tyres behind Heidfeld, attempted to pass the BMW at the hairpin, but succeeded only in damaging his front wing and forming a stationary queue behind him. He also benefitted by overtaking three cars under yellow flags {{and would have been}} penalised if he had finished the race. Sutil took advantage of the situation and passed four cars to take seventh, behind Heidfeld and Webber. Running a long first stint until lap 53, he moved to fourth as the cars ahead of him made pit stops. Vettel gained 12 places from the start, battling with Barrichello and Nakajima early on before jumping several places on his first stint as his rivals made <b>pit</b> stops, eventually <b>switching</b> to dry tyres when he stopped on lap 52. Webber improved three places from the start to sit in sixth, ahead of Vettel, Barrichello and Nakajima.|$|R
5000|$|Pull begins {{promptly}} at 3 pm. Each {{team has}} 20 Pullers who each {{have their own}} Moralers. Moralers were once called [...] "Morale Girls" [...] but this was changed to allow more gender neutrality. While {{there have been several}} female Pullers, {{there has never been a}} male Moraler. As Pull is so physically and mentally straining, Moralers are important supporters in those respects. However, their key purpose is to act as the Pullers' eyes as they cannot see the Coach throwing the calls from their pits, and all 18 pits must move together for success. Even Year and Odd Year each have their own secretive methods for deciding the order in which Pullers may choose their Moralers. At the beginning of the event, the rope is marked at the front of Pit 1, so that a winner may be determined should it remain very close and that a margin of victory can be measured. While there are 20 pairs of Pullers and Moralers, there are only 18 pits. Each team has what are called [...] "sprinters" [...] and [...] "marathoners". Each year has a strategy as to which pits they reserve for these special members of the teams. As the first half hour of Pull is both very crucial and very tiring, the sprinters are in these pits for that time. At the half hour mark, both of these <b>pits</b> are <b>switched</b> and the marathoners go in for the remainder of the Pull. There are doctors and judges on each side, and if it is deemed that someone must come off the rope, a sprinter or marathoner may take his or her place. Each side also has two more special pits, at the back of the team. The very last Puller is the [...] "Anchor" [...] and is typically the heaviest member of the team. The Anchor and his Moraler are the only members of the team who are standing for the entirety of Pull. In front of the anchor is [...] "Pit 17" [...] who will occasionally take on the Anchor's duties while the Anchor and his Moraler adjust the rope, and as such Pit 17 and his or her Moraler must be specially trained.|$|R
40|$|Pit 2 {{is a type}} III sodium-dependent {{phosphate}} transporter and {{the cell}} surface receptor for amphotropic murine leukemia virus. Indirect arguments have previously suggested that retrovirus receptor assembly {{play a role in}} triggering membrane fusion. Using CHO cells expressing physiological amounts of functional versions of human Pit 2 fused to various tagging epitopes, we provide evidence that Pit 2 forms assemblies at the cell surface. Living cells were exposed to cross-linking reagents and protein extracts were treated with trifluoroacetic acid (TFA), a chemical that destroys all protein interactions but covalent links. Assemblies were also detected in the absence of cross-linking and TFA treatment, indicating that they are partially resistant to detergent denaturation. The formation of homo-oligomers was documented by the coimmunoprecipitation of differently tagged molecules. The amounts of Pit 2 assemblies detected in the presence or in the absence of cross-linking reagents varied with extracellular inorganic phosphate concentration ([Pi]). Variation of signal intensity was in the range of twofold, occurred in the absence of de novo protein synthesis and took place at the cell surface. These results indicate that Pit 2 assemblies exhibit variable conformations at the surface of living cells. Susceptibility to virus infection and phosphate uptake also vary with extracellular [Pi]. A model is proposed in which cell surface <b>Pit</b> 2 assemblies <b>switch</b> from a compacted to an expanded configuration in response to changes of extracellular [Pi], and possible relationships with the variation of biological activities are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Mining in the 21 st {{century is}} facing many challenges, among which are low-grade and high tonnage orebodies. One great (r) {{evolution}} in mining {{occurred in the}} early 20 th century when Daniel Jackling proposed the concept of economies of scale for large-scale (bulk) mining at Bingham Canyon. At that time, there were many shallow deposits around the world suitable for open pit mining. Hence, this method grew rapidly {{and the majority of}} iron, copper, and gold production came from open pit mines. Open pit mining method has many advantages such as increased safety, higher production rates, more flexibility, lower cost, less operational risk, etc., so normally it considered as preferred option; but break-even depth, high stripping ratios, and environmental issues have become significant challenges facing this method in 21 st century. In underground mining, block caving is the only method with the costs comparable to surface mining methods, especially open <b>pit</b> mining. A <b>switch</b> from open <b>pit</b> mining to block caving mining could be another great development in this century. However, even though an increasing number of mines are being developed using block caving, this method involves many technological and environmental challenges. The depth of the orebody {{is one of the most}} important factors governing selection of the mining method. This paper offers a numerical (quantitative) ranking system for mining method selection when both open pitting and block caving are feasible, which is true for many low-grade and super large hard rock mining operations...|$|R
5|$|Vergne {{dropped down}} the order when his car {{developed}} a water pump battery failure {{and was forced}} to make an unscheduled pit stop to move into his second vehicle on lap eight, while di Grassi made his required pit stop for a replacement front wing on the same lap and narrowly avoided striking a trackside marshal after leaving his pit stall. López had dropped to 18th place by the start of the following lap. Bird briefly reduced the time deficit to Piquet until the latter responded to the Virgin car's fast pace. Rosenqvist lost control of the back-end of his car and slid backwards into the turn five barrier on the 14th lap, damaging his rear wing. The incident forced him to make a pit stop for the switch into his second car. López carried a large amount of speed exiting the chicane and made heavy contact with the wall on lap 17. Piquet was close behind him and took avoiding action but reacted late and had an understeer which sent him into the barrier. He did not damage his car and was able to reverse out of the barrier but lost the lead to Bird and Buemi moved into second place. The incident necessitated the deployment of the safety car to allow marshals to repair the wall and extract López's car from the track. Some drivers (including Buemi) elected to make mandatory <b>pit</b> stops to <b>switch</b> into their second cars under safety car conditions {{at the end of the}} 20th lap.|$|R
5|$|Turvey's team {{asked him}} to reset his vehicle and a yellow flag was shown to warn drivers about his {{stranded}} car. After three laps, however, {{he was unable to}} restart his vehicle and retired, causing the safety car to be sent onto the track for the second time. With the field closed up, di Grassi and d'Ambrosio opted to make the mandatory switch into their second cars on the 18th lap. Although the switch would allow di Grassi and d'Ambrosio to gain positions when other drivers made their stops, it required them to conserve electrical energy towards the race's conclusion. The race restarted when the safety car drove into the pit lane on the following lap with López remaining in first place, followed by Heidfeld, Vergne, Bird and Buemi. López built a small lead over {{the rest of the field}} and attention switched to Heidfeld who came under pressure from Vergne, Bird, Buemi and Rosenqvist. Although he had enough electrical energy to do another lap, Vergne became the first of the leading drivers to make a <b>pit</b> stop to <b>switch</b> into his second car at the end of lap 24 in an effort to drive in clean air and undercut the field. The rest of the field followed in response one lap later. Swift work from López's team allowed him to remain narrowly ahead of Vergne, who in turn, moved in front of Heidfeld. The Mahindra driver lost seven positions while Buemi moved from fifth to tenth, both as a result of slow pit stops. Prost led the field for one lap before making his stop on lap 26.|$|R
5000|$|Michael Schumacher`s {{teammate}} Rubens Barrichello {{lined up}} third, despite an accident during Saturday morning final free practice session and a spin {{towards the end}} of qualifying. He starts just ahead of Michelin drivers Ralf Schumacher and Kimi Räikkönen. Ralf Schumacher, the winner of the previous Canadian Grand Prix had a technical problem, meant that he had to switch to the T-car which was set for Montoya. Ralf quoted, [...] "The T-car was set up for Juan but I have managed to take the best out of it anyway. I am confident for the race, also because I am sure that Michelin are competitive here." [...] David Coulthard in the McLaren and Jarno Trulli in the Renault were the other Michelin drivers to crack the top 10. It was a dramatic session for Trulli, who was hindered when he smashed his race chassis into one of the circuit`s concrete retaining walls and had to return the crippled car to the <b>pit</b> lane before <b>switching</b> to his team`s spare chassis for his final run. Jenson Button in the Renault led the remaining Michelin runners, ahead of Eddie Irvine, Pedro de la Rosa, Mika Salo, Allan McNish, Mark Webber and Alex Yoong. De la Rosa had to abort one run because of a spin. Yoong failed to complete the last of four qualifying laps because a technical problem forced him to pull off the track. Local favourite Jacques Villeneuve in the BAR started ninth, his best grid position of the season. Italian Giancarlo Fisichella gave the Jordan team heart by posting his first top-six qualifying performance of the season, but his teammate Takuma Sato`s session was ruined by a spectacular engine failure.|$|R
40|$|Pit latrines {{are one of}} {{the most}} common forms of onsite {{sanitation}} facilities in many developing countries. These latrines are suitable as a means of isolating human waste, however, conditions within pits often lead to nitrification of the contained waste. In areas with a near-surface aquifer, the potential for nitrate pollution arising from pit latrines cannot be ignored. In this study, site visits were made to three densely populated, peri-urban areas near three West African cities (Dakar, Abidjan, Abomey-Calavi) to gather relevant information about the latrines in use and the soil and groundwater underneath the sites. Modelling was then conducted to demonstrate the potential for nitrate pollution of the groundwater from the latrines in such settings. The depth from the bottom of the pits to the water table was considered as 5, 10 or 30 m, to represent the range of aquifer depths at the study sites. Nitrate half-lives ranging from 500 to 1500 days were considered, and time scales from 6 months to several years were modelled. The results highlighted the high likelihood of nitrate pollution of groundwater reaching levels exceeding the World Health Organization guideline value for nitrate in drinking water of 50 mg/L after as short a period as two years for the aquifer situated 5 m below the pits, when considering moderate to long nitrate half-lives in the subsurface. Careful siting of latrines away from high water table areas, more frequent <b>pit</b> emptying, or <b>switching</b> to urine diversion toilets may be effective solutions to reduce nitrate passage from pit latrines into groundwater, although these solutions may not always be applicable, because of social, technical and economic constraints. The study highlights the need for more reliable data on the typical nitrate concentrations in pit latrines and the nitrate half-life in different subsurface conditions...|$|R
