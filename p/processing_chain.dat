40|$|Remote sensing imagery {{has been}} widely used in urban growth and {{environment}} analysis with many effective and advanced strategies being developed. However, most of these approaches are separated from each other. There is an urgent need to combine different modules into some practical <b>processing</b> <b>chains.</b> Firstly, we present a comprehensive analysis of key <b>processing</b> <b>chains</b> in applying remote sensing images to urban environment analysis from such aspects as Land Use/Land Cover (LULC), urban landscape ecology, Urban Heat Islands (UHIs), vegetation and water monitoring, change detection, urban ecological security assessment and urban environmental mapping.

5000|$|An {{ultrasound}} research interface (URI) is {{a software}} tool loaded onto a diagnostic clinical ultrasound device which provides functionality beyond typical clinical modes of operation. Before an ultrasound image can be displayed to the user, it must undergo {{a series of}} transformations, typically {{referred to as the}} ultrasound <b>processing</b> <b>chain.</b> As data moves through the <b>processing</b> <b>chain,</b> it may be desirable to acquire it at certain intervals, so it can be processed offline for research purposes. A set of processing parameters sent to the ultrasound device control how the <b>processing</b> <b>chain</b> performs its operations. It may also be desirable to change these processing parameters to achieve different imaging results. A clinical ultrasound user only has access to the ultrasound data in its final processed form, referred to as a B-Mode image. The format of the images are typically in the DICOM file format. The clinical user also has limited access to the processing parameters that can be modified; for reasons of device usability, and so the device cannot be put into a state that renders itself inoperable.|$|E

40|$|With the {{implementation}} specification of the Web Processing Service (WPS), a standard to process spatial {{data on the}} web {{is available from the}} Open Geospatial Consortium (OGC). This new possibility in web-based information systems allow an interoperable processing of different data based on service-oriented architectures. This paper describes requirements and an implementation for web-based processing and workflow creation to generate and provide remote sensing products like fire hotspot points and land surface temperatures based on NASA MODIS data. Therefore, a WPS as well as service chains to process these remote sensing products are implemented. PyWPS is used as WPS and tested with focus on processing remote sensing data. To chain the developed processes, software like 52 Â° North Orchestration Engine, Apache ODE and internal software for executing <b>processing</b> <b>chains</b> and providing a workflow as WPS process are tested. A Web-GIS with open-source software was developed to manage started and finished processes, to search for available satellite data and to create <b>processing</b> <b>chains</b> interactively. An interface to retrieve and process archived data was integrated; the user of this system can search interactively for archived satellite data and process it with the developed processing services and workflows. The Web-GIS also acts as a WPS client, client for visualizing processed data and creator as well as security layer for <b>processing</b> <b>chains.</b> These developments and research work show that there is additional work to improve the WPS specification for example by adding domain-specific profiles for working with large raster data to define standardised rules for data-exchange between the processes.

40|$|Abstract – The {{development}} of the CryoClim system and its associated web service was started in 2008 {{by a group of}} Norwegian organisations. When the system becomes operational, it will perform long-term systematic climate monitoring of the cryosphere. The system and service are designed to be integrated with the international system of systems for global monitoring (GEOSS) as a contribution to the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS). Based on scientific and technological results from several past and current projects, a network-based system is developed based on international standards for interoperability. The network of <b>processing</b> <b>chains</b> and databases (the nodes) will be hosted by mandated organisations in order to ensure long-term and stable operation. In 2008, a system demonstrator was developed, including prototype products for snow, sea ice and glacier variables. When the <b>processing</b> <b>chains</b> are fully implemented, the system will be used to create long time series of climate products based on earth observation data starting from the late 1970 s and the beginning of 1980 s...|$|R
