40|$|AbstractVaccine potency {{and safety}} testing is {{characterized}} by extensive use of laboratory animals and a relatively high percentage of test methods that involve severe pain and distress. This is particularly true for tests {{that are based on}} infection or challenge with a virulent microorganism. Traditionally, vaccine potency tests on inactivated vaccines require a vaccination–challenge procedure using severe clinical signs or even lethality as endpoints. For several of these vaccines, 3 R methods have been developed that include a nonclinical endpoint, ultimately resulting in reduction of animal numbers and a significant decrease in severity level. An example is the use of serology in <b>potency</b> <b>testing</b> of tetanus and diphtheria toxoid vaccines. For some potency tests, however, replacement of the challenge procedure is not (yet) possible, and the implementation of humane endpoints might be an approach to limit the level and duration of pain and distress. The application of these endpoints is now allowed in most pharmacopoeias. Establishing humane endpoints in vaccine <b>potency</b> <b>testing</b> requires the identification of parameters that are predictive of death, or severe clinical signs, in the animal during the observation period. As a case study, we present the results of work we performed on the identification of humane endpoints in whole cell pertussis (wP) vaccine <b>potency</b> <b>testing</b> (the mouse protection test or the Kendrick test). In this potency test, mice are challenged by intracerebral route 14 days after immunization with a lethal dose of virulent B.  pertussis microorganisms. Animals are observed for 14 days, and the number of mice per dose group surviving this period is used for probit analysis and estimation of potency. We have studied two types of humane endpoints: clinical signs and pathophysiological parameters (body weight and body temperature). Clinical signs in a wP potency test range from piloerection, hunched back posture, apathy, and convulsions to moribund condition. Also body temperature drops, and animals lose up to 50 % of their body weight post-challenge. Parameters were “validated” for relevance (prediction of death within the observation period) and reliability.

The aim of this study was to determine the common components of commercially available serovar Canicola vaccines to aid development of an in vitro potency test; lipopolysaccharide and protein were chosen for analysis due to their known immunogenic properties. Analysis of five serovar Canicola vaccines (A-E) using the Limulus amebocyte lysate assay and silver stained sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gels, indicated that lipopolysaccharide was not detectable in all vaccines tested preventing it from being a suitable biomarker for an in vitro test. Therefore the protein contents of vaccines A-E were determined by two dimensional liquid chromatography mass spectrometry (22 l± 3 l, 9 ± 8, 34 ± 4, 2 l± 5 and 34 ± 17 proteins [mean ± 1 standard deviation] found respectively) to identify conserved proteins.

A análise estatística dos resultados obtidos nas titulações, feita através dos testes Limites para uma Média e "t" de Student, mostrou que para as cepas Moraten e Biken CAM- 70, as diferenças de títulos não foram estatisticamente significantes, o mesmo não ocorrendo com a cepa Schwarz, para a qual as células Vero IB se mostraram mais sensíveis. Vero cells used by {{distinct}} {{measles vaccine}} control laboratories had their susceptibility to Moraten, Schwarz and Biken CAM- 70 vaccine strains assayed. Of {{a total of}} 72 lots of measles vaccine whose potency was titrated by microtechnique in two Vero cell samples (Vero IB and Vero INCQS), 25 had been produced with Moraten strain, 24 with Schwarz and 23 with Biken CAM- 70. The statistical analysis of the results demonstrated that both Vero cells assayed presented comparable susceptibility to Moraten and Biken CAM- 70 strains. As to the Schwarz strain, Vero IB cells were more susceptible than the other cell sample tested, thus confirming the existence of different sensitivities of Vero cells to some measles vaccine strains, or even to viruses derived from the same strain but with different passage histories. An altered cell susceptibility to virus replication may significantly alter the results in <b>potency</b> <b>testing.</b> Such alteration may be caused {{not only by the}} adoption of distinct protocols for the maintenance of cell cultures by different control laboratories but also by the methodology followed in the vaccine titration. In order to minimize the differences existing among the results obtained in the <b>potency</b> <b>testing,</b> it is suggested that all control laboratories should use the same protocols for cell culture maintenance as well as for vaccine <b>potency</b> <b>testing...</b>|$|E

However, testing necessary to ensure vaccine effectiveness and safety can involve large numbers of animals and significant pain and distress. NICEATM and ICCVAM convened an international workshop to review the state of the science of human and veterinary vaccine potency and safety testing methods and to identify opportunities to advance new and improved methods that can further reduce, refine, and replace animal use. This workshop report is the fourth in a series of six, and addresses methods and strategies for veterinary vaccine <b>potency</b> <b>testing</b> that can avoid or lessen pain and distress, improve animal welfare, and reduce animal use. Vaccine potency tests considered to have the highest priority for further reduction and refinement were those that require an infectious agent challenge test or an in vivo toxin neutralization test, those that require large numbers of animals, and those that require the use of infectious agents hazardous to laboratory workers and/or animals. Vaccines identified as high priorities for improved alternative test methods were rabies, Clostridium spp., Leptospira spp., foreign animal diseases (e. g., foot and mouth disease), and poultry and fish vaccines. The workshop recommended priority research, development, and validation activities to address critical knowledge and data gaps, including opportunities to apply new science and technology. Recommendations to support more humane animal use included development and use of humane endpoints for all challenge tests, development of serologic assays to replace challenge tests, and development of in vitro toxin neutralization tests to replace in vivo TNTs. Workshop participants recommended approaches {{to reduce the number of}} animals required for <b>potency</b> <b>testing,</b> and recommended enhanced international harmonization and cooperation, and closer collaborations between human and veterinary researchers to expedite progress in the development and application of alternative methods. Implementation of the workshop recommendations is expected to advance new methods for veterinary vaccine <b>potency</b> <b>testing</b> that will benefit animal welfare and reduce animal use while ensuring continued protection of human and animal health.

Accelerated stability and long term stability study performed for three batches of trivalent oral poliomyelitis vaccine (OPV) and three batches of monovalent OPV (type 1) manufactured by Razi institute. After sampling, the samples tested intervals in months for long term stability and after 48 h incubation in 37 0 C for accelerated stability. All of quantitative and qualitative control <b>tests</b> including <b>Potency,</b> Sterility, Mycoplasma detection and Physicochemical testes performed in each period. <b>Potency</b> <b>test</b> for trivalent OPV (tOPV) in three batches of vaccines until 26 months and in two batches, until 27 months after production, met the specification. <b>Potency</b> <b>test</b> for monovalent OPV (mOPV) in all batches of vaccines until 18 month after production met the specification. Sterility, mycoplasma and physicochemical testes on these samples for mOPV and tOPV until expiry date and after that, passed. All batches of vaccines in accelerated stability met the specification after incubation and the reduction titer of vaccines was less than 0. 5 (-LogCCID 50 /dose). Results of this research indicated razi polio vaccines are stable for 24 months if the cold chain considered properly...|$|R
