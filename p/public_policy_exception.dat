40|$|<b>Public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>exceptions</b> arguably {{exist in}} all fields {{of private and}} commerciallaw, not only in private {{international}} law but also in substantive law. In substantive private law, the term 'public policy exception' {{could be used to}} indicate general illegality rules that make an act of private autonomy (a contract, a testament, etc.) invalid when it conflicts with <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> or good morals. In primary EU law, one may call 'public policy exceptions' the derogations from the four freedoms for reasons of <b>public</b> morality, <b>public</b> <b>policy,</b> <b>public</b> security, or public health. Like the ordre public exceptions in private international law, the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>exceptions</b> in substantive private and commercial laws can also be seen as conflict rules. In fact, the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>exceptions</b> in substantive private law address the conflict between state regulation and policy, on the one hand, and private (self-) regulation and policy, on the other hand. Moreover, the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> derogations from the four freedoms regulate the conflict between EU and national law and policy. A long-term research project initiated in Groningen aims at a cross-cutting comparison of interpretations and applications of concepts that function as <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>exceptions</b> in different branches of substantive, international, and EU private and commerciallaw. In particular, this project aims at discovering and comparing the governance aspects, the fundamental rights based aspects, and the social justice aspects of these interpretations and applications...|$|R

40|$|International {{arbitration}} is {{an integral}} element of the globalized modern economy. It is the principal method of resolving commercial disputes between States, individuals, and corporations in {{almost every aspect of}} international trade. Arbitration relies on the notion of party autonomy—that the parties to an agreement may freely choose the law applicable to their agreement and to the resolution of any dispute arising out of it. However, agreements have to be performed and arbitral awards rendered somewhere, and in the modern world in which the preeminent legal authority is the sovereign State, these actions necessarily occur under a legal framework and a <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> not shaped by the parties. When rules of <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> are implicated in the agreement underlying a dispute in arbitration—or in the award resulting from the for arbitration proceedings, a State must navigate between the Scylla and Charybdis of lending its authority to the recognition of an agreement or enforcement of an award contrary to its fundamental principles or of appearing not to respect the principle of finality of arbitral awards underpinning the system of modern international commerce. What route should national courts—the “watchmen of public policy”—choose? Should party autonomy cabined by respect for international <b>public</b> <b>policy?</b> Or should <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> be viewed as a safety valve utilized only in emergencies, where recognition and enforcement would be fundamentally at odds with a State’s most cherished principles and values? This thesis details the provisions for refusal of recognition or enforcement of arbitral awards on the grounds of <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> that currently exist in major international conventions and model legislation {{as well as in the}} legislation of the United States and selected European Union Member States. The various ways in which <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> can be understood is explained, and the application of the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>exceptions</b> in the United States and selected European Union Member States are detailed. Finally, trends in the United States and the European Union with respect to <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> and arbitration are examined...|$|R
40|$|Traditional {{concepts}} {{concerning the}} law regarding employment relationships of an indefinite duration {{have been the}} object of much criticism in recent years. The source of this controversy stems from {{the application of the}} so-called employment-at-will rule which provides that employment relationships of this nature may be terminated by either party at any time with or without notice or cause. The at-will rule, however, is not about to be abandoned. The overwhelming majority of jurisdictions continue to adhere to the view that employment relationships of an indefinite duration may be terminated at any time without notice 2 ̆ 2 for good cause, for no cause, or even for cause morally wrong.... 2 ̆ 2 Even those jurisdictions which have recognized exceptions to the at-will rule are limiting the application of those exceptions to clearly articulated <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> as expressed in federal or state law. Courts have also examined the effect of statements of personnel policy, whether oral or written, on an employer 2 ̆ 7 s ability to discharge at-will employees. This article discusses the various approaches of law regarding at-will employment relationships. The rationale for the employment-at-will rule, its exceptions and recent limitations on these exceptions are examined. In addition, this Article analyzes the effect of personnel policies on the at-will rule, and reviews the law concerning employee rights to personnel benefits. Finally, this Article proposes the adoption of a uniform approach to recognizing <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>exceptions</b> to the at-will rule...|$|R

5000|$|The {{generality}} of the characterisation {{process is}} not, and cannot be, a wholly scientific process. It {{is always a}} matter of interpretation. For example, if A who is a national of Arcadia, dies having made a valid local will leaving land situated in Barsoom to C who is domiciled in Catilage, how is the issue to be classified? One might say that any rights that C might have are vested by the will that was made in Arcadia (i.e. the lex loci actus). Equally, the right to succeed to title might be an aspect of C's status as the oldest surviving male heir under Cartilagean law (the lex loci domicilii). Or {{it may be a}} matter for the law of Barsoom since all matters of title to land must be adjusted by the lex situs as the law of the place where the land is situated. Thus, completely different judgments might result depending on how the forum court characterises the action. One of the most enduring solutions to this problem was proposed by Savigny (1779-1861). He argued that it was always necessary for the court to find the [...] "natural seat" [...] or [...] "centre of gravity" [...] for the case by identifying the largest cluster of [...] "connecting factors" [...] to a particular legal system. If all courts adopted such an international outlook, he reasoned, this would eliminate forum shopping by producing the same choice of law no matter where the case was begun. Unfortunately, the theory has not delivered the desired results. Forum shopping remains a problem, and neither legislators nor judges have been able to agree on characterisation issues, producing classifications that extend rather than reduce international divergences. In an attempt to avoid obviously unjust results in particular cases, some judges therefore created a number of <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>exceptions</b> to justify decisions [...] "on the merits". Ernest G Lorenzen commented that this strategy was a warning that there must be serious problems with the rules if <b>policy</b> <b>exceptions</b> were the solution.|$|R
40|$|This article {{examines}} the negative impact that the U. S. Supreme Court’s recent jurisprudence interpreting the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”) {{will have on the}} ability of states to promote the public interests that ground state employment regulation and argues for a reordering of the relationship between federal arbitration law and state public-policy-based employment arbitration doctrine. The article proceeds in three steps. First, the article demonstrates that the U. S. Supreme Court’s 2011 decision in AT 2 ̆ 6 T Mobility LLC v. Concepcion and 2013 decision in American Express Co. v. Italian Colors Restaurant together extinguish the state effective-vindication and <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>exceptions</b> to FAA application. In doing so, this case law preempts a significant amount of state employment arbitration regulation and, thus, enables employers to use employment arbitration agreements imposed on employees as a condition of employment as a means to evade the strictures of state employment regulation. Second, the article argues that, as a normative matter, the FAA should allow for consideration of the public interest in determining whether an employment arbitration agreement will be enforceable. Thus, in practice, the FAA should allow for consideration of the need for a worker to effectively vindicate her state statutory employment rights and for consideration of her ability to do so in arbitration. Finally, the article suggests a way forward. Specifically, the article proposes that Congress limit the FAA’s preemptive scope by carving out an exception to section 2 of the FAA that would allow states to regulate predispute employment arbitration agreements subject to the approval of the U. S. Department of Labor or a similar body. Pursuant to this reform, a state would be authorized to propose employment arbitration regulations tailored to the specifics of that state’s employment statutes. A federal overseer with expertise in employment law would be charged, however, with evaluating any such proposed employment arbitration regulation by balancing the federal interest in promoting arbitration agreements as written with the state interest in vindicating state statutory employment rights...|$|R
40|$|The European Union {{is perhaps}} the most {{elaborate}} venture into applying the idea of ‘unity in diversity’ ever attempted. This ambitious book – the first in English to thoroughly explore this vast and multifaceted ground – convincingly demonstrates {{that there is such a}} thing as an autonomous EU ordre public, and its co-existence with the concepts of ordre public of the Member States is indeed intricate. In a cogent, detailed analysis, the author ‘reconstructs’ the legal order of the European Union in a way that best gives meaning to the Treaties, the case law of the Court of Justice, and the various underlying principles of integration that have emerged over the decades. He focuses on instances, or touchstones, in relation to which EU law seems to be building and integrating an ordre public. Among these are the following: 	private international law; 	international trade law and arbitration; 	public international law; 	the ECHR and EctHR; 	<b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>exceptions</b> to the four freedoms; 	European citizenship; 	competition law; 	national and EU procedural law; and 	protection of social and labour standards. In-depth inquiry into questions which seem subject to very specific limitations – such as when national or EU courts are under an obligation to raise issues of EU law of their own motion, or norms from which private parties may not deviate – captures the breadth of the EU ordre public, greatly clarifying the concept and the variety of ways it operates. Seeking to reconcile numerous strands and processes of EU law in a principled manner, the book reveals a significant potential for a deeper constitutional framework defining the EU ordre public and putting it into operation as a tool to help ensure unity in diversity. It will be welcomed and read closely by jurists, policymakers, and interested academics in Europe and wherever the matter of European integration is studied. nrpages: xvi+ 496 status: publishe...|$|R

5000|$|Wisconsin's public-policy {{exception}} to the employment-at-will doctrine is narrow.

[...] It also reiterated the Brockmeyer court's characterization of the narrowness of this exception: public policy did not entail a [...] "broad implied duty of good faith termination", since such a duty [...] "would unduly restrict an employer's discretion in managing the work force" [...] and [...] " [...] 'subject each discharge to judicial incursions into the amorphous concept of bad faith.' [...] " [...] Rather, the <b>public</b> <b>policy</b> <b>exception</b> is 'narrow," [...] i.e. applicable only where the discharge [...] "clearly contravenes the public welfare and gravely violates paramount requirements of public interest." [...] And since the action is predicated on [...] "the breach of an implied provision that an employer will not discharge an employee for refusing to perform an act that violates a clear mandate of public policy," [...] in sounds in contract not tort.|$|E
40|$|For some twenty‐five centuries, the “nature {{of human}} nature ” has been the central issue in Western {{political}} thought.

40|$|BACKGROUND: There {{has been}} {{insufficient}} research attention to alcohol industry methods of influencing <b>public</b> <b>policies.</b> With the <b>exception</b> {{of the tobacco}} industry, {{there have been few}} studies of the impact of corporate lobbying on public health policymaking more broadly. METHODS: We summarize here findings from documentary analyses and interview studies in an integrative review of corporate efforts to influence UK policy on minimum unit pricing (MUP) of alcohol 2007 - 10. RESULTS: Alcohol producers and retailers adopted a long-term, relationship-building approach to policy influence, in which personal contacts with key policymakers were established and nurtured, including when they were not in government. The alcohol industry was successful in achieving access to UK policymakers {{at the highest levels of}} government and at all stages of the policy process. Within the United Kingdom, political devolution and the formation for the first time of a Scottish National Party (SNP) government disrupted the existing long-term strategy of alcohol industry actors and created the conditions for evidence-based policy innovations such as MUP. CONCLUSIONS: Comparisons between policy communities within the United Kingdom and elsewhere are useful to the understanding of how different policy environments are amenable to influence through lobbying. Greater transparency in how policy is made is likely to lead to more effective alcohol and other <b>public</b> <b>policies</b> globally by constraining the influence of vested interests...|$|R
