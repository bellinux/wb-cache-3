The Florida Department of Transportation {{purchased}} the track from CSX in 1989. Under {{the terms of}} the agreement, CSX would continue to provide dispatch services and physical <b>plant</b> <b>maintenance</b> for the track and would have exclusive freight trackage rights until certain conditions were met. As of Sunday March 29, 2015 at 12 midnight, CSX handed over dispatching and maintenance to SFRTA (Tri-Rail). While this should have the advantage of giving passenger trains signal priority over freight trains, it was at first wreaked with delays.|$|E

A fire caused 5–10 million dollars worth of damage to New York's Indian Point Energy Center in 1971. The arsonist {{turned out to be}} a <b>plant</b> <b>maintenance</b> worker. Sabotage by workers has been reported at many other reactors in the United States: at Zion Nuclear Power Station (1974), Quad Cities Nuclear Generating Station, Peach Bottom Nuclear Generating Station, Fort St. Vrain Generating Station, Trojan Nuclear Power Plant (1974), Browns Ferry Nuclear Power Plant (1980), and Beaver Valley Nuclear Generating Station (1981). Many reactors overseas have also reported sabotage by workers.|$|E

[...] Equalization basins {{may be used}} for temporary storage of diurnal or wet-weather flow peaks. [...] Basins provide a place to temporarily hold incoming sewage during <b>plant</b> <b>maintenance</b> and a means of diluting and distributing batch discharges of toxic or high-strength waste which might otherwise inhibit biological secondary treatment (including portable toilet waste, vehicle holding tanks, and septic tank pumpers). [...] Flow equalization basins require variable discharge control, typically include provisions for bypass and cleaning, and may also include aerators.

Project management became recognized as a distinct discipline arising from the management discipline with engineering model. In the United States, prior to the 1950s, projects were managed on an ad-hoc basis, using mostly Gantt charts and informal techniques and tools. At that time, two mathematical project-scheduling models were developed. The [...] "critical path method" [...] (CPM) was developed as a joint venture between DuPont Corporation and Remington Rand Corporation for managing <b>plant</b> <b>maintenance</b> projects. The [...] "program evaluation and review technique" [...] (PERT), was developed by the U.S. Navy Special Projects Office in conjunction with the Lockheed Corporation and Booz Allen Hamilton as part of the Polaris missile submarine program.|$|E
