Their length and weight were measured individually, and they consisted of 28 species of fin fish, 9 species of crustacean and 2 species of mollusk. Trash fish included undersized individuals of species of commercial value, which were sold in the market. ...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. —Understanding {{sampling}} {{effectiveness is}} critical to gear selection and the determi-nation of larval fish dynamics. We evaluated bow-mounted push nets for collecting larval fish across reservoirs and habitats and compared them with traditional tow nets. By means of a pushed 0. 5 -m-diameter conical net and towed 0. 5 -m-diameter and 0. 75 -m-diameter conical nets, ichthyo-plankton samples were taken during daylight hours from May to July on 21 reservoirs that varied in morphological and environmental characteristics. The <b>push</b> <b>net</b> had higher catches than the same-diameter tow net. However, the <b>push</b> <b>net</b> was not as efficient as the larger-sized tow net in July, when larvae are larger. For pelagic habitats, bow-mounted push nets or large tow nets will sample the larval fish community more efficiently than traditional 0. 5 -m-diameter conical tow nets. We also assessed push nets for sampling nearshore littoral habitats (, 1. 0 m in depth). Across reservoirs the littoral areas had much higher catch rates than did the offshore pelagic zone; estimates of peak larval fish densities were four times as high in the littoral zone. Deriving estimates of larval fish abundance from pelagic habitats only will probably lead to underestimation of total larval fish densities. The versatility of the <b>push</b> <b>net</b> in sampling littoral habitats is an important consideration when designing surveys to estimate larval fish communities. Bow-mounted pus...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Three new {{zooplankton}} nets {{have been}} designed to enable improved collection of zooplankters from ice-covered waters. These nets also enable quanti-tative sampling of species not adequately sampled by other methods. The first net is a vertical tow net which can be folded like an umbrella to pass through a small ice hole (10 cm). This 'Umbrella Net ' takes an integrated sample of zoo-plankton from all sample depths. The second net is a collapsible free-fall net designed to collect mobile zooplankters capable of avoiding towed nets. This was the only net used which was capable of collecting all furcilia stages of Euphausia crystallorophias from Ellis Fjord, Vestfold Hills, Antarctica. The third net is a diver-operated <b>push</b> <b>net</b> designed to collect zooplankters in the top 15 cm of the under-ice water column. Because of the high standing crop of phytoplankton at and near the under-ice surface at particular times of the year, some species of zooplankton tend to congregate there.

40|$|A {{study was}} {{conducted}} to assess fish catch in the Baila beel of Maljhee-Kangsa floodplain in the north-central part of Bangladesh. A total of 7 types of fishing gear were found in use by the fishermen which are: <b>push</b> <b>net,</b> gill net, cast net, lift net, current net, fish traps and hooks. The duration of fishing depends on use of fishing gear, season, habitat type, water depth and abundance of fishes. From the survey {{it was found that the}} highest average fishing time was estimated in fish trap (18. 04 h/day) and the lowest in <b>push</b> <b>net</b> (3. 21 h/day). There are variations in the Catch Per Unit of Effort (CPUE) of different gears in different seasons. The highest and the lowest CPUE were recorded in current net and hook which were 0. 31 and 0. 02 kg/gear/h, respectively. According to the fishermen, the highest catch was obtained during the receding of floodwater in post-monsoon season (October-December) and the lowest during the pre-monsoon season (April-June). A total of 39 fish species were identified in the catches of different gears. From the survey it was found that a fisherman daily catches an average 1. 43 kg of fish. Alarmingly, the catch of fish has declined by an estimated 20 % in the past five years. Concerns arise about the sustainable catches due to over fishing and indiscriminate use of gears. It is therefore necessary to provide institutional and organisational supports for artificial stocking and establishing fish sanctuaries through active community participation for sustainable catches...|$|E

Use of commercial trotlines is now mostly limited to the tributaries of the Chesapeake Bay. In the Gulf of Mexico, trotline use drastically declined after invention of the crab pot in 1938. Crab pots are rigid boxlike traps made of hexagonal or square wire mesh. They possess between two and four funnels that extend into the trap, with the smaller end of the funnel inside of the trap. A central compartment made of smaller wire mesh holds bait. Crabs attracted by odorant plumes from the bait, often an oily fish, enter the trap through the funnels and cannot escape.|$|R

40|$|Research PaperA rapid {{increase}} in the Thai trawl and <b>push</b> <b>net</b> fisheries had led to over fishing and thus fishery resource degradation. Catch per unit effort decreased from over 300 kg/hr in the past 30 years to less than 20 kg/hr recently. The impact has placed a greater burden on coastal fishermen who have limited alternative fishing grounds. In response to the degradation of resources, Thai fishermen adjusted their fishing gears, turning to the "available" resources. Examples were anchovy fisheries in place of small trawl fisheries. Nevertheless such a response led to the degradation of another resource. Ecological, economic and social factors can explain such patterns of resource exploitation. Societal cost - a concept being developed within the ECOST project - includes ecological cost, economic cost, and social cost to form a measure that would better elaborate the value of Thai fisheries resources.

Acetes serrulatus johni is given specific rank, whereas A. australis and A. sibogalis are ranked as subspecies of A. sibogae. The male of A. binghami is described for the first time. Keys are given to the {{species of the}} genus. Ten species are distributed in the Indo-West Pacific, and the Indo-Malayan region is particularly rich in species. One species is restricted to Pacific America and 2 species are found in Atlantic America. No species are known either from East Atlantic-Mediterranean or from the islands of the Central Pacific. Available information on geographic distribution is summarized for each species. Specific relationships and biogeography are discussed. Acetes affords {{a major source of}} protein to {{some of the people in}} Asia and East Africa. Present status of the Acetes fishery in various countries is reviewed. The shrimp is mainly fished with various kinds of <b>push</b> <b>nets</b> and bag nets set near the shore against the flow of the tide. Boat seines and shore seines are used, too. The average world catch is estimated at 170, 000 metric tons per year. It account...|$|R

The published article is copyrighted by Springer and can be found at: [URL] coastal South Carolina, most impounded marshes are managed for waterfowl; fewer are managed for fishes. Tidal control is central to each strategy but raises concerns that nursery function could be impaired. This research examined the assemblage composition of fishes during early-life stages. We sampled two impoundments of each management type monthly in 2008 and 2009. We used light traps to collect 61, 527 sub-adult fish representing 21 species and 16 families and <b>push</b> <b>nets</b> to collect 12, 670 sub-adult fish representing 13 species and 11 families. The effective number of species detected at larval stage in “fish” impoundments (summer mean = 2. 52 ± 0. 20, winter mean = 2. 02 ± 0. 66) was greater than in “waterfowl” impoundments (summer mean = 1. 27 ± 0. 14, winter mean = 1. 06 ± 0. 09); CI = 90 %. Species richness did not differ between management types, but hierarchical linear models predicted differences in assemblage composition. These findings underscore the importance of frequent water exchange for maintaining diverse assemblages of early-life-stage fishes in marsh impoundments...|$|R
50|$|The {{yellowstripe scad}} is an {{important}} species for commercial and subsistence fisheries throughout its range. Between 1990 and 2010 the FAO reported worldwide catch has ranged between 113,000 and 195,000 t, with a consistent trend towards higher catches. These statistics only include Indonesia, Malaysia and the UAE, suggesting true catch sizes to be higher. Of the countries that report catches to the FAO, Indonesia takes the highest amount, with between 129,000 t and 180,000 t reported each year between 2000 and 2010. Locally yellowstripe scad make up {{a high percentage of}} the catch; in an Indian example, it accounted for up to 36% of total landings in one survey. However, in India overall, yellowstripe scad makes up only 1.5% of total carangid catches. The species is predominantly taken in trawls, however is also caught by gill net, bag net, purse seines or ring <b>nets,</b> and <b>push</b> <b>nets.</b> The species is most abundant during spawning periods in India and consists of 8-13 cm individuals. A study on the population dynamics in an Indian fishery during 1994 found there was low fishing pressure on the stocks, however a later assessment found stocks elsewhere in India to be overexploited. The novel use of hydroacoustic sounding to estimate the school size of yellowstripe scad, as well as other scad species, has been trialled with varying levels of effectiveness.|$|R
