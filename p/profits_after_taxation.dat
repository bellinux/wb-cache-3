40|$|The lack of {{satisfaction}} {{about using the}} traditional performance assessment has resulted in presenting several suggestions about new performance assessment criteria. Economic value added {{is one of the}} most important items among these criteria. In this research the superiority of economic value added as an economic criterion of performance assessment, was tested in comparison with other accounting performance assessment criteria. Our sample involves 120 companies accepted in Tehran Stock Exchange during the time period between the years 2003 and 2010. We have used panel regression to test the relative data content of economic value added and other accounting criteria and also to test differential (growing) data content of economic value added elements. The results of testing the research hypotheses showed that accounting profit (net profit and net operational <b>profit</b> <b>after</b> <b>taxation)</b> has more data content to describe the traits of stock return compared to economic value added and operational cash flows. The promissory goods and operational cash flows also have differential (growing) data content compared to other economic value added elements in describing the traits of stock return...|$|R
40|$|After {{accession}} to the European Union, tax issues acquired {{and are still}} acquiring an entirely new character. A new legal environment is forming both in the Czech Republic and in the European Union. Until now, only indirect taxes have been harmonised, with direct taxes having remained {{in the domain of}} each member state. However, we are now feeling pressure to harmonise this area as well. Cases concerning value added tax belong to those that are now most often being resolved in front of the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg. Cases regarding direct taxes are also becoming increasingly important. Will direct taxes be harmonized to the same extent as indirect taxes have? When potential investor is considering his investment into a company, he needs to match comparable figures. Definitely, {{one of the most important}} criterions is the amount of <b>profit</b> <b>after</b> <b>taxation</b> followed by payout of dividends. If there are different ways of taxation of corporations in various EU Member States, then there would be no possibility to compare corporations placed in various EU Member States objectively. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is, based on the research in the whole EU regarding taxation of corporations, to suggest a method how to harmonize taxation of corporations, which now prevents companies from trading in a single EU market, and also to minimize corporation’s costs of fulfilment of tax administration requirements of each Member State. This aim has been achieved through the following partial aims: [...] An analysis of taxation of corporations in each of all 27 EU Member States, [...] An analysis of proposals of the European Commission regarding harmonisation of taxation of companies, [...] Suggestion of own method of harmonization of taxation of corporations in the EU.
