This type of air classifier plays an important role due to the efficiency of the device and the characteristics of segregation. The authors report the results of research into image analysis of segregation of shredded waste {{on the basis of the}} use of image analysis...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} the importance of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>classification</b> process to improve the performance of many applications using solid polidisperse materials, particularly the sugar cane bagasse. It was designed a classification column with the appropriate characteristics to separate sugar cane bagasse into three fractions, designated as coarse, medium, and fine fractions. The classification took place in the column due to the fine-tuning of airflow regimes. In the evaluation of the classification, the following indicators are used: purity index, classification efficiency, and degree of separation. These indicators were experimentally determined in a laboratory installation for sugar cane bagasse particles. A fine fraction with a mean diameter of 0. 398 mm with an efficiency of classification of 84. 5 % and an index of purity of 98. 4 % was obtained during the experimental research work carried out. This gives an idea of the percentage of separation and homogeneity of the fine fraction contained in the bagasse fed to the column. In conclusion, the bagasse fractions are separated within a definite particle size range, which can improve its practical applications in processes such as hydrolysis, combustion, and in many other operations where a classified solid polidisperse material is necessary...|$|E
40|$|Coal {{moisture}} control (CMC) in coking process, which reduces coal moisture before loading the coal into the coke oven, allows substantial reduction in coking energy consumption and increase in coke productivity. The technology {{is seeking to}} integrate the coal classification, thus calling it the coal classifying {{moisture control}} (CCMC), to separate the fine and coarse coal fractions in the CMC process so that the downstream coal crushing can only treat the coarse fraction. CCMC adopts a reactor that integrates a fluidized bottom section and a pneumatic conveying top section. The present work investigates the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>classification</b> behavior in a laboratory CCMC reactor with such a configuration by removing the coal fraction below a given size (e. g., 3. 0 mm) from a 0 to 20. 0 mm coal feed. The {{results show that the}} coal classification were dominated by the gas velocity in the top conveying section, and the required gas velocity for ensuring the maximal degree of removing a fine coal fraction could be roughly predicted by the Richardson and Zaki equation. The effect of bottom fluidization on the performance of CCMC is also examined. (c) 2012 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.

40|$|AbstractThe {{research}} {{results of the}} material, chemical and mineral compositions of waste coal from the processing plant Abashevskaya and carbonaceous argillites from the Korkino coal mine are provided. The technology of waste coal recycling is offered {{that can be used}} in the production of coal fuel for bricks burning and preparation of the raw material for ceramics manufacture. On the basis of the pilot plant tests it is shown that the <b>pneumatic</b> waste <b>classification</b> allows coal residues to be extracted from argillites and a stable ceramic raw material to be obtained for the brick manufacture. Such complex processing of waste coal does not only provide a significant expansion of the raw material base for the production of building materials and generation of additional energy, but will also help to solve environmental problems and improve the environmental situation in industrial regions. Due to the introduction of the patented method of production and rational compositions of the granulated molding materials there is an increase in operational properties of ceramic wall materials produced from the waste coal after secondary processing. The study of thin sections using a polarizing microscope and SEM was conducted to examine the structures of the obtained ceramic cork. It was established that high physical and mechanical properties of the brick were achieved by forming the matrix structure of a ceramic crock, intensive generation of the glass phase at the interphase boundary of the composite material and the temperature reduction of processes of a solid-phase sintering during burning...|$|R
