500|$|General Prem Chand was {{particularly}} anxious about Bunche's visit. Keenly aware of this, Bunche {{did his best}} to alleviate the general's worries, asking to stay at his residence in Élisabethville instead of a hotel. Prem Chand was alarmed when Bunche presented him with a letter from Thant, but Bunche reached into his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> out a suggested response. The general was surprised by the accuracy of the draft in its considerations of the military situation of UN troops during the advance, though the following day he gave Bunche a full explanation of what had occurred. In his official report on the events in Katanga, Bunche concluded, [...] "I have found beyond doubt that it is our machinery that is at fault, far more than the individuals." [...] He returned to UN Headquarters on 10 January with an official apology from ONUC commanders. Thant later commented on the matter, writing, [...] "I felt that it was I, not they, who should have apologised for my miscalculation and apprehensions based on scare reports from London and Brussels." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{town meeting}} {{attracted}} a packed crowd of over a thousand, with Nixon supporters distributing anti-Voorhis literature at the door. The Senate proxies spoke first for their candidates, followed by Voorhis. Nixon, who had notified organizers {{that he would}} be late due to another commitment, arrived during Voorhis's speech, and remained backstage until the congressman had completed his talk. He then came onstage, shook hands with Voorhis, and delivered a fifteen-minute address. A question-and-answer period then followed, with a Nixon supporter asking Voorhis about his onetime Socialist registration, and about his views on monetary policy. [...] After the representative responded, a Voorhis supporter asked Nixon why he was making [...] "false charges" [...] about the supposed Voorhis CIO-PAC endorsement. [...] In response, Nixon reached into his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> out a copy of a Southern California NCPAC bulletin mentioning the group's endorsement of Voorhis. [...] The congressman was unaware of the endorsement; those of his aides in the know had [...] "completely forgotten" [...] to tell him. [...] Nixon walked halfway across the stage and displayed it to Voorhis, asking him to read it for himself. Voorhis came from his seat and took it, and (according to Bullock, who served as timekeeper at the debate) [...] "mumbled" [...] that this seemed to be a different organization from the CIO-PAC. [...] Nixon reclaimed the document, and began to read out names {{of the members of the}} boards of directors of the two groups, [...] "It's the same thing, virtually, when they have the same directors." [...] The crowd began to cheer Nixon, who later wrote, [...] "I could tell by the audience reaction that I had made my point", and to jeer Voorhis, who wrote, [...] "They'd boo and laugh at my remarks, and this disturbed me." ...|$|E

60|$|Grenfell, who did {{not appear}} to hear him, thrust a hand into his <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> out a few silver coins counted them deliberately.|$|R
60|$|The two now started off, the Pupil first {{putting a}} line and hook in his <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> out a fishing-rod from under some bushes.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, sir," [...] said Amy, [...] "I'll {{enable you}} to lose that £20 immediately;" [...] and so {{she put her hand}} in her <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> out her purse.|$|R
60|$|He put {{his hand}} contemptuously in his trouser <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> out some small change.|$|E
60|$|This {{statement}} angered Powell and {{he quickly}} dove into his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> out the sum mentioned.|$|E
60|$|Rising to take leave, the Elder put {{his hand}} in his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> out a large clasp-knife.|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here!" [...] said he, {{putting his}} hand in his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> out several [...] "greenbacks." [...] "I reckon that'll keep Aunt Matilda until the company begins to make money." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've got {{something}} here that'll outlast an El Sol a whole day," [...] continued Captain Breast, tugging at his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> out a six-inch cigar {{as black as}} the night. [...] "Just you try that." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Take them lil' silver bottle {{out of my}} <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> the top off him," [...] he {{said very}} slowly; and when Amadu had done so he gulped down a draught of lukewarm brandy before he spoke again.|$|R

60|$|He felt in 'is <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> out a little, crumpled-up {{photograph}} of a ship he'd been fireman aboard of some years afore, {{and showed it to}} 'er.|$|E
50|$|As {{the police}} {{show up to}} clear up the mess Barry has created he sits forlornly on a park bench. Disillusioned with the police he throws his badge away before rifling through his <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> out a pin, a police radio and a grenade. Realising too late that the pin was {{actually}} from the grenade and it goes off, ending the film.|$|R
60|$|One {{among her}} several trivial errands {{was to make}} a small {{purchase}} at the druggist's. Near the druggist's stood the County Bank. Looking out of the shop window, between the coloured bottles, she saw Manston come down the steps of the bank, in the act of withdrawing his hand from his <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> his coat close over its mouth.|$|R
60|$|Mr Montmorency, in his embarrassment, fingered {{one of his}} <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> nervously <b>pulled</b> out a snake, which crawled {{about the}} table.|$|R
60|$|Mose {{thrust his}} hand into his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> out all his money, a handful of small change. His face grew bitter, his last dollar was broken into bits.|$|E
60|$|The {{little man}} felt {{carefully}} in his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> out the tiny piglets, setting them upon the grass one by one, where they ran around and nibbled the tender blades.|$|E
6000|$|... "You’ll do now," [...] said Joe. [...] "I ain’t got much, {{but what}} I have you’re welcome to." [...] He {{put his hand}} into his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> out some loose coin. [...] "What have you got, mates?" ...|$|E
60|$|I {{searched the}} <b>pocket</b> again, <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> out a ring. Evidently he had thrust these two things {{there when he}} saw me {{pursuing}} him, and had forgotten or neglected them {{in the heat of the}} mêlée.|$|R
60|$|Chief Inspector Heat {{suddenly}} {{pulled out}} a pink newspaper he had bought less than half-an-hour ago. He was interested in horses. Forced by his calling into an attitude of doubt and suspicion towards his fellow-citizens, Chief Inspector Heat relieved the instinct of credulity implanted in the human breast by putting unbounded faith in the sporting prophets of that particular evening publication. Dropping the extra special on to the counter, he plunged his hand again into his <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> out the piece of cloth fate had presented him with out of a heap of things {{that seemed to have}} been collected in shambles and rag shops, he offered it to Mrs Verloc for inspection.|$|R
60|$|JACK. Hello! I've {{got home}} all ri----[Defiantly.] Who says I sh'd never 've opened th' door without 'sistance. [He {{staggers}} in, fumbling with the reticule. A lady's handkerchief and purse of crimson silk fall out.] Serve her joll' well right--everything droppin' out. Th' cat. I 've scored her off--I 've got her bag. [He swings the reticule.] Serves her joly' well right. [He takes a cigarette {{out of the}} silver box {{and puts it in}} his mouth.] Never gave tha' fellow anything! [He hunts through all his <b>pockets</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> a shilling out; it drops and rolls away. He looks for it.] Beastly shilling! [He looks again.] Base ingratitude! Absolutely nothing. [He laughs.] Mus' tell him I've got absolutely nothing.|$|R
60|$|And he put {{his hand}} into his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> out some silver. Then he made signs of {{mounting}} one of the mules, and waved his hand over the surrounding country to signify that he wanted a general ride.|$|E
6000|$|A flush darkened {{his face}} beneath its cosmetics, {{and with an}} oath he dipped finger and thumb into his {{waistcoat}} <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> out a dog whistle. [...] "No more of that," [...] said he, [...] "or I whistle up the police this minute." ...|$|E
60|$|Alice had no {{idea what}} to do, and in despair she put her hand in her <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> out a box of comfits, (luckily the salt water had not got into it), and handed them round as prizes. There was exactly one a-piece all round.|$|E
6000|$|Agga-Groo {{looked at}} the compass with {{interest}} and tested its power of pointing north. Then {{he shook his head}} and handed it back to Cap'n Bill. The sailor dived into his <b>pocket</b> again <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> out a pair of scissors, which he placed beside the compass on the palm of his big hand. [...] "You may have them both," [...] he said.|$|R
6000|$|... "After {{a little}} while she comes back, and says, 'I've done it, Peck! She's mighty close, and as proud as Lucifer; but she's only a dressmaker, for all that.' 'A dressmaker!' says I; 'how {{did you find out}} she was a dressmaker?' 'Why, I looked at her forefinger, in course,' says Peggy, 'and saw the pricks of the needle on it, and soon made her talk a bit after that. She knows fancy-work and cuttin' out--would ye ever have thought it? And I'll show her how to give the workhouse the go-by to-morrow, if she only holds out, and keeps in her senses. Stop where you are, Peck! I'm going to make Jubber put his dirty hand into his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pull</b> out some money; and that's a sight worth stoppin' to see any day in the week.' ...|$|R
60|$|But he was striding moodily {{along with}} his hands in his <b>pockets,</b> <b>and</b> his hat <b>pulled</b> down over his eyes, passing the old beech without a glance at it. Lucinda checked another sigh, {{gathered}} up an escaped flutter of voile, and marched on.|$|R
60|$|Slow and ox-like, on {{the face}} of the Swede dawned relief and comprehension. The pang over, the finger felt better. The pain was gone. He {{examined}} the finger curiously, with wondering eyes, slowly crooking it back and forth. He reached into his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> out a gold-sack.|$|E
6000|$|I beckoned to Crowded Owl, and he {{immediately}} {{ran up to}} the wall, and said [...] "How?" [...] in an uncertain tone, {{as if he was}} not sure how we should take it. However, Corny offered him her hand, and Rectus and I followed suit. After this, he put his hand into his <b>pocket,</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> out three sea-beans.|$|E
6000|$|Denis nodded. Mr. Barbecue-Smith put {{his hand}} in his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulled</b> out a notebook. [...] "I did a few in the train to-day," [...] he said, turning over the pages. [...] "Just dropped off into a trance {{in the corner of}} my carriage. I find the train very conducive to good work. Here they are." [...] He cleared his throat and read: ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{video for}} the song opens with a man {{standing}} in front of a jukebox, his face unseen by the camera. He scrolls his finger up a list of songs and stops at [...] "Any Way You Want It". He then reaches into his <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulls</b> out a coin which he inserts into the jukebox. He then selects the song and we see a record being flipped over and beginning to spin. This dissolves into a shot of a studio tape spinning which leads to the group performing the song in the studio. The band's performance comprises most of the video until the song ends. At this point the man at the jukebox is revealed to actually be lead singer Steve Perry who turns and smiles at the camera. Another video exists which is a live performance during the Departure Tour. Both videos were omitted from the band's Greatest Hits 1978-1997 DVD in favor of another live version of the song from the Escape Tour.|$|R
60|$|Morning, noon, {{and night}} the visitor is perpetually putting {{his hand into}} his side <b>pocket</b> <b>and</b> <b>pulling</b> out coppers. He drips coppers all day in an unending stream. You enter a French theatre. You buy a programme, fifty centimes, and ten more {{to the man who}} sells it. You hand your coat and cane to an aged harpy, who presides over what is called the vestiaire, pay her twenty-five centimes and give her ten. You are shown to your seat by another old fairy in dingy black (she has a French name, but I forget it) and give her twenty centimes. Just think of the silly {{business}} of it. Your ticket, if it is a good seat in a good theatre, has cost you about three dollars and a half. One would almost think the theatre could afford to throw in eight cents worth of harpies for the sake of international good will.|$|R
