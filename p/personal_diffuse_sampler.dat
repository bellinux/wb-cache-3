A Monte-Carlo-based simulation program (SRIM: Stopping and Range of Ions in Matter) was utilized to simulate and extract doses and energies of Mg ions to have different depths for p-doped regions with 1 E 19 cm - 3 concentration. Diffusion runs were performed at three different temperatures of 400, 440 and 475 °C for 15 minutes. Dark current and photoresponse measurements were performed on different doped areas {{as a function of}} temperature and detector bias for all <b>samples.</b> <b>Samples</b> <b>diffused</b> at high temperatures (440 and 475 °C) showed a high leakage current and were highly conductive.

It is associated with hardness and paleness of the muscle, necrosis, fibrosis and macrophage infiltration. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the differences in sarcomere length and tensile strength between normal and Wooden Breast in chicken. For the sarcomere length measurements 20 unaffected chicken breasts and 21 Wooden Breasts were used. For half of each group electrical stimulation was applied. Sarcomere length was measured in four different locations of each breast: cranial and medial area, surface and depth. The tensile test experiment involved three experimental groups, with 20 samples for each group: unaffected, with focal lesion and with <b>diffuse</b> lesion. <b>Samples</b> were cut from the surface layer of cranial and medial area of every chicken breast, both on longitudinal and transversal direction of the muscle fibers. Results showed that Wooden Breast syndrome has a significant effect on sarcomere length, leading to increased lengths in the affected muscles compared with the normal muscles (p< 0. 05). There was less lengthening of the sarcomere as result of electrical stimulation in WB muscles compared with normal chicken breasts (p< 0. 05). The difference in sarcomere length between WB and Normal was smaller in the surface layer of the muscle in comparison with the depth layer.

The rust was most common on Melampyrum sylvaticum with 21 % of the plants and 2 % of the leaves carrying telia. Telia occurred occasionally also on Euphrasia frigida, E. nemorosa, E. stricta, Pedicularis palustris ssp. palustris and Melampyrum pratense (less than 5 % of the plants and 0. 3 % of the leaves). The rust was absent on Rhinanthus minor. Second, a <b>diffuse</b> <b>sample</b> of each of M. sylvaticum, M. pratense, Euphrasia sp. and Rhinanthus sp. was collected from 10 sample plots surrounding the city area. C. flaccidum occurred on 0. 29 % of the leaves of M. sylvaticum, and 0. 02 %- 0. 03 % of M. pratense and Euphrasia, but it was lacking from Rhinanthus. The results indicated that C. flaccidum was most common and widespread on M. sylvaticum, but sporulated sporadically also on Euphrasia sp., P. palustris and M. pratense. This is the first report of sporulation of C. flaccidum on Euphrasia frigida and E. nemorosa in their natural habitats.

40|$|This paper {{demonstrates}} {{a method to}} determine the bidirectional transfer distribution function (BTDF) using an integrating sphere. Information about the sample's angle dependent scattering is obtained by making transmittance measurements with the sample at different distances from the integrating sphere.

The resulting system of equations is an ill-posed problem which rarely gives a physical solution. A solvable system is obtained by using Tikhonov regularization on the ill-posed problem. The solution to this system can then be used to obtain the BTDF. Four bulk-scattering samples were characterised using both two goniophotometers and the described method to verify the validity of the new method.

Scleroderma is a chronic connective tissue disease that occurs one in about every 5, 000 individuals. It is characterized by skin fibrosis along with other organ involvement, such as interstitial lung disease, gastro-esophageal reflux disease, and renal crisis. SSc is generally preceded by a condition known as Raynaud's Syndrome. Raynaud's presents with the purpling or whitening of the finger tips and toes, especially in cold weather. Raynaud's is caused by vascular dysfunction in the circulation in the fingers and toes. About 10 - 15 % of people over the age of 35 developing Raynaud's will eventually develop some sort of connective tissue disease. Patients diagnosed with SSc can be placed into one of two categories, Limited or Diffuse Cutaneous Disease. Limited Disease, also known as CREST Syndrome, presents with skin disease limited to the forearms and face, typically with limited systemic involvement. Diffuse Disease presents with more proximal skin disease with typically more severe internal organ involvement. To help diagnose patients, physicians can test for autoantibodies in the serum, specifically anti-topoisomerase antibodies associated with Diffuse Disease and anti-centromere antibodies associated with Limited Disease. Clinically physicians assess the severity of skin disease with a technique known as the Modified Rodnan Skin Score, which determines the extent of skin disease throughout the body. While the molecular pathways involved in the pathogenesis of SSc are largely unknown, some researchers believe that SSc is caused primarily by excessive inflammation, leading to vascular injury, and excessive collagen production causing systemic fibrosis. The pathways involved in inflammation and collagen deposition involve numerous different cytokines, including TGF-β, IL- 6, and IFN Type I. All three of these cytokines further regulate gene expression of other proteins involved in inflammation and collagen deposition. One previous study has determined a useful 4 -gene biomarker of skin disease using skin biopsy <b>samples</b> from <b>diffuse</b> patients. However, skin samples are hard to obtain so physicians are searching a useful set of biomarkers of disease activity in serum. Researchers seek to identify these proteins in serum and determine their involvement in the pathogenesis of SSc. Identification of these proteins might provide insights on the molecular mechanisms involved and might also indicate therapeutic targets. Serum biomarkers might predict disease severity at different points in time and thus allow physicians to track disease progression over time. In this study we examined TGF-β regulated proteins as potential serum biomarkers. These potential biomarkers included cartilage oligomeric protein (COMP), matrix metalloproteinase- 9 (MMP- 9), osteopontin and periostin. All four of these proteins have been implicated in the pathogenesis of skin fibrosis in previous studies and therefore are classified as potential biomarkers for SSc skin disease. We studied the levels of each of the four biomarkers in serum samples through ELISA analysis. Results for COMP analysis showed a statistically significant increase between control and <b>diffuse</b> SSc serum <b>samples</b> and results for osteopontin showed a moderate correlation between MRSS values. COMP levels did not correlate with the MRSS, and osteopontin levels showed no statistical significance between controls and <b>diffuse</b> <b>samples.</b> In contrast to previous reports, MMP- 9 results showed no correlation with MRSS values or statistical significance between control and <b>diffuse</b> <b>samples.</b> Periostin analysis showed a negative correlation with the MRSS but no statistical significance between control and <b>diffuse</b> <b>samples.</b> Periostin's negative cmrelation with MRSS values is of particular interest as it implies a potential protective role of periostin for fibrosis. The results of this current study varied greatly from previous studies. This variation in results between the current study and previous studies is likely due to a different patient population in Boston. The variation could also be due to the use of different ELISA kits and protocols. It is also possible that the correlations found in previous studies are not as robust as researchers once believed as none of the studies included a validation cohort. In an attempt to detetmine the utility of each biomarker in determining disease trajectory, the four potential biomarkers were compared to delta MRSS values over six months. Interestingly, osteopontin showed a high negative correlation with delta MRSS values, while periostin and COMP showed a high positive correlation with delta MRSS values. Further {{research is needed to determine}} whether the proteins in question can be useful biomarkers for SSc skin disease. Also, further research including IFN regulated proteins might help develop an efficient multiple gene biomarker for serum in diffuse patients...|$|R
40|$|The {{irradiance}} cache is an acceleration {{data structure}} which caches indirect <b>diffuse</b> <b>samples</b> {{within the framework}} of a distributed ray-tracing algorithm. Previously calculated values can be stored and reused in future calculations, resulting in an order of magnitude improvement in computational performance. However, the irradiance cache is a shared data structure and so it is notoriously difficult to parallelise over a distributed parallel system. The hurdle to overcome is when and how to share cached samples. This sharing incurs communication overheads and yet must happen frequently to minimise cache misses and thus maximise the performance of the cache. We present a novel component-based parallel algorithm implemented on a cluster of computers, whereby the indirect diffuse calculations are calculated on a subset of nodes in the cluster. This method exploits the inherent spatial coherent nature of the irradiance cache; by reducing the set of nodes amongst which cached values must be shared, the sharing frequency can be kept high, thus decreasing both communication overheads and cache misses. We demonstrate how our new parallel rendering algorithm significantly outperforms traditional methods of distributing the irradiance cache. 3 C Research Programme.

Furthermore, some species exhibit breaks in different places, and others exhibit no breaks in this region. We analyze the phylogeographic patterns of 2 mitochondrial genes from 10 populations of the bamboo worm Clymenella torquata (Annelida: Maldanidae) focused around Cape Cod but extending from the Bay of Fundy, Canada, to New Jersey. A common invertebrate along the US coast, C. torquata, possesses life-history characteristics that should make it sensitive to factors such as dispersal barriers, bottlenecks, and founder events. As an inhabitant of soft sediments, C. torquata offers a unique contrast to existing research dominated by organisms dwelling on hard substrates.

The potential toxicity as well as heavy metal concentrations of the smokeless tobacco products analysed was found to be much higher than acceptable limits. For instance, the levels of lead, cadmium, copper and zinc of 2. 5, 1, 4 and 23 ppm, respectively, are well above their recommended limits.

These different surface preparations and cleaning sequences were performed on undiffused and boron diffused n-type Cz Si wafers, followed by the deposition of either silicon nitride (SiNx) or an aluminum oxide film capped with SiNx (Al 2 O 3 /SiNx stack). Additionally, both planar and anisotropically textured wafers were used. Injection-level dependent photoconductance measurements and calibrated photoluminescence imaging were performed on symmetrical boron <b>diffused</b> <b>samples</b> based on the different cleaning processes and passivation materials described above.

Equipment {{for measuring the}} diffuse reflectivity of materials (e. g. paint samples) is already in existence and requires only minor modification for the proposed experiment which will include the measurement of the polarizing properties of the lunar samples. Measurements can be made {{as a function of}} both illumination angle and angle of observation...|$|R
40|$|The {{interaction}} of hydrogen with Fe-related centers in p-type Si was investigated by deep level transient spectroscopy (DLTS). After {{wet chemical etching}} (WCE) of iron <b>diffused</b> Si <b>samples</b> the interstitial iron concentration exceeds the equilibrium concentration close to the surface. The iron depth profiles exhibit an exponential dependence with a characteristic length identical to the hydrogen penetration depth, which is about ten {{times larger than the}} iron diffusion length. On the other hand, after reverse bias annealing (RBA) the iron profile deviates clearly from the exponential distribution. Our results give evidence for a release of iron by a hydrogen-stimulated dissociation of iron-related defects. © 2000 Elsevier Science S. A. All rights reserved...|$|R

Zeta potential {{of the samples}} were determined using ZETA POTENTIAL METER, MFGPRO- 52400035. ICP-MS measurements were carried out using a Perkin Elmer Optima 2000 DV instrument. BET surface measurements were done using SMARTSORB- 92 of Smart Instruments. X-ray photoelectron spectra (XPS) were recorded using Model ESCA+ by Omicron UK using a Al k alpha source. Raman spectra were recorded using Renishaw Invia Raman microscope powered by a laser source @ 785  nm. ICP-MS {{studies were carried out}} with an Agilent- 7700 ICP-MS instrument using EPA method 200.8.

40|$|Very large {{diffusion}} {{coefficients were}} encountered and required {{the determination of}} impurity profiles for samples approximately 1 cm thick. Since conductivity values are readily converted into concentrations of electrically active impurities, the major problem became that of accurately determining the conductivity profiles of beryllium <b>diffused</b> silicon <b>samples.</b> Four-point probe measurements on samples having depth conductivities are interpreted in terms of conductivity profiles, based on an exact solution {{of the problem of}} exponentially depth dependent conductivity. Applications include surface conductivity determination where the form of the conductivity profile is known, and conductivity profile determination from probe measurements taken as the sample surface is progressively lapped away. The application is limited to samples having conductivity monotonically decreasing with depth from the probed surface...|$|R
40|$|Vibrational {{characteristics}} of Ba(NO 3) 2, {{one of the}} key components in an important automotive catalytic technology, NOx storage and reduction (NSR), were investigated by ab initio molecular dynamics. In particular, the fundamental, overtone, and combination bands of surface and bulk Ba(NO 3) 2 were calculated and compared with experimental infrared (IR) spectra measured by internal and <b>diffuse</b> reflection <b>sampling</b> configurations. Using the densities of characteristic internal vibrational modes, the origins of the experimental IR bands in the regions of fundamental as well as overtone and combination vibrations were clarified. Furthermore, the molecular dynamics based vibrational analysis showed that the bands in the overtone and combination band region (1600 ? 3000 cm? 1), typically neglected in NSR studies, contain chemically rich information and can assist in the firm identification of surface nitrates and their adsorption configurations...|$|R
40|$|The {{magnetic}} properties of manganese (Mn) doped zinc oxide (ZnO) tetrapod structures were studied by diffusion doping at temperatures 600 and 800 °C. The samples showed clear magnetic hysteresis at 5 K and Curie temperature {{was determined to}} be ∼ 50 K. The <b>sample</b> <b>diffused</b> at 600 °C exhibited higher Mn concentration and higher remnant magnetization at 5 K. The samples exhibited very high coercive field, which is about one order of magnitude higher compared to values reported for ZnO:Mn thin films. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|A special {{goniometer}} {{is a part}} of {{a system}} for the measurement of the reflection properties of surfaces. The adopted measuring procedures are based on a CCD luminance meter with the aim of having a good selection of the sample under test. In particular, two methods allow the measurement of the luminance coefficient independently on the absolute calibration of the luminance meter; they allow the reduction of the overall measurement uncertainty. The methods are based on the ratio of luminance measurement of the sample under test and on the measurement of the luminance either of the light source used in the test, or of a <b>diffusing</b> reference <b>sample.</b> The measures of the luminance coefficient, with an observation angle of 1 °, of a white diffuse reflectance standard and of a road paving sample are presented as examples of applications of the described methods...|$|R
40|$|The microvasculature was {{investigated}} in the normal bowel (n = 43 patients) and in radiation bowel disease (n = 18 patients). Tissue samples obtained from postoperative colectomy specimens in which the intramural vessels had been perfused with barium sulphate suspension were examined. Microradiography was used to study vascular pattern which was abnormal in radiation bowel disease. A recently described radiograph fluorescence system was used to estimate barium concentration, and hence microvascular volume. The radiation group showed a highly significant reduction in barium concentration (p less than 0. 001), {{when compared with the}} normal group. This reduction was <b>diffuse</b> in <b>samples</b> from 15 patients who had received combined intracavity and external radiotherapy, but localised in two patients who had received intracavity treatment only. It is concluded that microvascular compromise {{is an important factor in}} the natural history of radiation bowel disease...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} one {{important}} component of the energy system - the window. Windows are installed in buildings mainly to create visual contact with the surroundings and to let in daylight, and should also be heat and sound insulating. This thesis covers four important aspects of windows: antireflection and switchable coatings, energy simulations and optical measurements. Energy simulations have been used to compare different windows and also to estimate the performance of smart or switchable windows, whose transmittance can be regulated. The results from this thesis show the potential of the emerging technology of smart windows, not only from a daylight and an energy perspective, but also for comfort and well-being. The importance of a well functioning control system for such windows, is pointed out. To fulfill all requirements of modern windows, they often have two or more panes. Each glass surface leads to reflection of light and therefore less daylight is transmitted. It is therefore of interest to find ways to increase the transmittance. In this thesis antireflection coatings, similar to those found on eye-glasses and LCD screens, have been investigated. For large area applications such as windows, it is necessary to use techniques which can easily be adapted to large scale manufacturing at low cost. Such a technique is dip-coating in a sol-gel of porous silica. Antireflection coatings have been deposited on glass and plastic materials to study both visual and energy performance and {{it has been shown that}} antireflection coatings increase the transmittance of windows without negatively affecting the thermal insulation and the energy efficiency. Optical measurements are important for quantifying product properties for comparisons and evaluations. It is important that new measurement routines are simple and applicable to standard commercial instruments. Different systematic error sources for optical measurements of patterned light <b>diffusing</b> <b>samples</b> using spectrophotometers with integrating spheres have been investigated and some suggestions are made for how to avoid such errors...|$|R
