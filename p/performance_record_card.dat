When a teacher produces comments on a <b>record</b> <b>card</b> for a student in a class, the teacher does not only need comments on academic results but also on attitudes, awards and punishment, and extra-curricular activities. The comment component of a student <b>record</b> <b>card</b> could provide choices of comments according to categories such as academic, behaviors, communication skills, participation in extra-curricular activities etc. {{and the level of}} achievements, which again as a result of detailed analysis. However, the teacher may also want to make an informed decision on producing the comments for students. The dynamic linking of the data to the <b>record</b> <b>card</b> system might provide teachers with all the necessary data so as to have a picture of the overall performance of a student before making the comments.|$|R
