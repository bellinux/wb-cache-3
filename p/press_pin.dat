5000|$|This move is {{the second}} most common version of a powerslam and is often {{referred}} to as simply a [...] "powerslam". The attacking wrestler places one arm between an opponent's legs, and reach over the opponent's shoulder with the other arm. Then, the opponent is spun over onto their back while keeping the opponent horizontal across the wrestler's body at all times. As the opponent falls to the mat, the attacking wrestler will continue to fall face-down on top of them in a lateral <b>press</b> <b>pinning</b> position. This powerslam is usually performed on a charging opponent, using the opponent's own momentum to power the throw. An inverted version exists, where the opponent is lifted from behind, and slammed in a manner similar to a scoop powerslam, only onto their face/abdomen.|$|R

40|$|Reliability {{studies of}} press fit {{contacts}} {{have been performed}} during environmental stress tests as well as during the manufacturing process. We investigated several <b>press</b> fit <b>pin</b> geometries according to their reliability under thermal, mechanical and electrical load. Correlations with the push-out force have been performed. In this paper we also focus on the mechanical reliability of electronic components which are soldered nearby the press-in pins. During press-in of the contact pin, a strain affected zone is created in the printed circuit board (PCB) near the contacts. The reliability of electronic components soldered near the <b>press</b> fit <b>pins</b> can be reduced if the solder joints are bearing strains > 400 µm/m. We investigated the strains {{on the surface of}} PCBs during press fit injection by two different sensor technologies and numerical simulations. Apart from standard electrical strain gauges we used fiber optic Bragg grating sensors. Their advantage is the ability to detect strain gradients, which are common in the sphere of influence of a press fit contact. In a distance of 3 mm away from the investigated contact pins the surface strain on the PCB is around 0. 1 %; in a distance of 10 mm at least 500 µm/m...|$|R
5000|$|Some chain {{tools are}} better at {{removing}} pins than they are at inserting them. Once completely removed, chain pins are often very difficult to insert with a tool unless it has been specifically designed to do so. Users may overcome this limitation of some tools by never completely removing a pin that they intend to replace. They push the pin so that the chain can be broken, to shorten it for example, but {{so that it is}} firmly retained in the farthest plate. This way, even simple chain tools can <b>press</b> the <b>pin</b> back into place.|$|R

50|$|A Pogo pin is {{a device}} used in {{electronics}} {{to establish a}} (usually temporary) connection between two printed circuit boards. Named by analogy with the pogo stick toy, the pogo pin usually {{takes the form of}} a slender cylinder containing two sharp, spring-loaded <b>pins.</b> <b>Pressed</b> between two electronic circuits, the sharp points at each end of the pogo pin make secure contacts with the two circuits and thereby connect them together.|$|R
50|$|The chain tool has two {{positions}} where a chain can {{be inserted}} {{perpendicular to the}} tool, one close to the movable screw portion, and one lower down just above the fixed end. In each position, there are a pair of protruding tabs; one fits {{into the center of}} one link of the chain, the other fits {{into the center of the}} next link. With the chain properly in place, the pin is held in the center of the tool, so that the tip of the movable screw can press on the end of the pin.

Often the end of the screw is a removable piece which can be replaced when worn.|$|R
30|$|The {{surfaces}} {{chosen for}} the reproduction of the firing pin and breech face impression were lead and plasticine.

50|$|Additional to the {{traditional}} screw contacts the electrical connection between the module {{and other parts of}} the power electronic system can also be achieved by pin contacts (soldered onto a PCB), press-fit contacts pressed into PCB vias, spring contacts that inherently press on contact areas of a PCB or by pure pressure contact where corrosion-proof surface areas are directly <b>pressed</b> together.Press-fit <b>pins</b> achieve a very high reliability and ease the mounting process without the need for soldering. Compared to press-fit connections, spring contacts have the benefit of allowing easy and non-destructive removal of the connection several times, as for inspection or replacement of an module, for instance. Both contact types have rather limited current-carrying capability due to their comparatively low cross-sectional area and small contact surface. Therefore, modules often contain multiple pins or springs for each of the electrical power connections.|$|R

50|$|The concert harp is a pedal harp. Pedals {{were first}} used in 1697. Pedal harps use the {{mechanical}} action of pedals {{to change the}} pitches of the strings. There are seven pedals, each affecting the tuning of all strings of one pitch-class. The pedals, in order from left to right, are D, C, B (on the left side) and E, F, G, A (on the right). Each pedal {{is attached to a}} rod or cable within the column of the harp, which then connects with a mechanism within the neck. When a pedal is moved with the foot, small discs {{at the top of the}} harp rotate. The discs are studded with two pegs that pinch the string as they turn, shortening the vibrating length of the string. Each pedal has three positions. In the top position no pegs are in contact with the string and all notes are flat; thus the harp's native tuning is to the scale of C major. In the middle position the top disc <b>presses</b> its <b>pins</b> against the string, resulting in a natural, giving the scale of C major if all pedals are set in the middle position. In the bottom position the second, lower disc is turned, shortening the string again to create a sharp, giving the scale of C major if all pedals are set in the bottom position.|$|R

The 7 kg recoil spring wraps around and is guided by the barrel. The {{spring-loaded}} trigger guard is pivoted down and swung to either side on the frame, allowing removal of the slide. The front sight is integrally machined into the slide, and a 3-4 mm wide textured strip is engraved {{on top of the}} slide in order to prevent aim-disturbing glare. The rear sight is dovetailed into the slide and multiple heights are available to adjust the impact point. The extractor is of an external spring-loaded type, and features a prominent flange preventing loss if a case should rupture. The breech face is deeply recessed in order to aid in extraction and ejection reliability. The stamped sheet steel slide-lock lever has a tail serving the purpose of ejector. The one-piece, wraparound bakelite or plastic grip is reinforced with steel inserts and has a detent inside the screw bushing preventing unscrewing during firing. The sheet-metal mainspring housed inside the grip panel powers the hammer in both the main and rebound stroke, the trigger and the disconnector, while its lower end is the heel and spring of the magazine catch. The sear spring also serves another function, powering the slide lock lever. Makarov pistol parts seldom break with normal usage, and are easily serviced using few tools.|$|R
50|$|Next {{the round}} is rolled {{with a special}} steel rolling pin. The pin has deep grooves about 1/8 inch wide and 1/8 inch apart. It is also cut {{laterally}} at 1/8 inch intervals. The <b>pin</b> <b>presses</b> creases into the round {{but because of the}} lateral grooves it does not cut the round into ribbons of dough. This pin is firmly rolled across the round and then again at right angles to the original direction leaving a cross-hatch pattern which seals the top and bottom surfaces of the round to each other. The round may also be slightly sealed to the tabletop. A lefse stick is a thin, flat, wooden stick with straight sides about 2 ft long and 1½ inches wide which has been sanded smooth. This stick is used to slide under the krotekake to release it from the floured surface. It is also used to scrape the table or pin clean of dough.|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{preserve}} contact situations occurring during a tribological test, an experiment was performed to investigate the pin–disc interface while keeping the <b>pin</b> <b>pressed</b> against the disc. The pin was made from a commercial brake pad material and the disc from gray cast iron. Thus the experiment simulated a moderate brake application. After fixation of the friction-couple, macro- and micro-cross-sections were prepared by conventional metallography and focused ion beam technique, respectively. The amount of third body between the two first bodies and its structure and chemical composition was determined by microscopic and micro-analytical techniques including SEM, FIB, TEM and EDX. Furthermore, the size and structure of wear particles ejected from the contact area during the test was examined. Although testing conditions were moderate in respect to energy input and corresponding temperature rise, at least the main features of the third body structure are comparable to features observed after severe braking conditions. The observations confirm that during braking the first bodies are separated by a third body which is mainly responsible for the friction response. Lacking evidence of third body films after braking with certain pad materials {{can be attributed to}} film loss after braking due to weak adherence to the disc surface...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{study was conducted}} to determine the accuracy of current press fit theory when applied to press fit design. Brass and nylon hex samples were press fitted with hardened steel dowel <b>pins.</b> <b>Press</b> fit force and torque required to induce slipping were measured experimentally. Sample dimensions and material properties were utilized to predict expected force and torque levels, which were then measured experimentally. Brass press fit forces proved difficult to predict due to plowing effects in tight interference press fits where material yielding was observed. However, once vertical force was removed, torque was applied to each sample. The observed torque values matched press fit theory well suggesting that the interface pressure of the press fit can be accurately predicted by theory. The brass torque samples matched theory well once material yield conditions were taken into account. The creep sensitivity of the nylon samples made predictions over the testing period unreliable. Results show the need for further testing with specific attention to precision in sample machining and measurements. Other considerations include press fit interface roughness and plowing effects during press fitting. by Alexandra T. Nelson. Thesis (S. B.)

40|$|Most {{chains are}} an {{assembly}} [1] of five parts namely, outer plate, inner plate, bush, pin and roller. Two inner plates are press fitted with two bushes {{to form an}} inner block assembly. The outer plates are <b>press</b> fitted with <b>pins</b> after keeping the pins through the assembled bushes of the inner block. Roller is a rotating member and placed over the bush during inner block assembly. Inner block assembly is the load transfer member from sprocket tooth. The outer block assembly helps in holding and also to pull the inner block over the sprocket teeth. If a chain length is in odd number of pitches, it requires an offset plate as shown in Figure 1 to connect two ends of the chain together to make chain endless. When the chain is assembled with an offset plate, the chain fatigue life was observed only 20 to 25 % of the total life of a chain, assembled without an offset plate. The holes in the offset plate are {{of the same size}} as in the outer and inner plates respectively and it is a complex in shape chain plate. A inbuilt thinning zone at the centre of the chain plate as shown in Figure 1 is unavoidable. The stresses and its distribution in this complex shape chain plate geometry {{play a critical role in}} the fatigue life performance of a chain assembly. However, it is difficult identify the stress distribution and stress concentration zones precisely using only the conventional industrial friendly tools such as routine quality control test, breaking load test and numerical computations. In this context the transmission photoelastic technique has made it possible to identify the stress distribution, its concentration and also to quantify the stress and strain [2 - 3] at any point in the chain plate. This paper explains how transmission photoelastic technique is used to estimate the stress distribution and its concentration zones in a complex chain plate when it isloaded. An epoxy chain plate model was made through the casting method using a Perspex mould [2 - 3]. A loading fixture was used to load the model during stress freezing in the furnace. The integrated fringe pattern of the offset chain plate is shown in Figure 2. Slices are cut in the offset zone to understand the nature of the stress distribution.
