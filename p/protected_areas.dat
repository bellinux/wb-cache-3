5|$|A {{critical}} {{issue is how}} to design <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> for amphibians which will provide suitable conditions for their survival. Conservation efforts {{through the use of}} <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> have shown to generally be a temporary solution to population decline and extinction because the amphibians become inbred. It is crucial for most amphibians to maintain a high level of genetic variation through large and more diverse environments.|$|E

40|$|In 1992, a {{planning}} process was begun in British Columbia to develop regional land use plans. One {{component of the}} Land and Resource Management Planning (LRMP) process was the BC <b>Protected</b> <b>Area</b> Strategy (PAS). Its purpose was to recommend <b>areas</b> for <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> status. Within the LRMP process, both environmental and socioeconomic criteria were considered in determining <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> recommendations. Specific research questions investigated in this project were: What criteria were important in LRMP <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> selections; and, How did <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> decisions contribute to land use planning? These research questions were investigated using a literature review of <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> selection methods and criteria, and with a mail-out survey to participants of four LRMP processes: Mackenzie, Okanagan-Shuswap, Cassiar- Iskut-Stikine and Kalum South. The research findings indicated the prominence of environmental criteria over social and economic criteria, and that the LRMP <b>protected</b> <b>area</b> selection process contributed positively to land use planning...|$|R

5|$|Conservation of cacti {{can be in}} situ or ex situ. In situ {{conservation}} involves preserving habits through {{enforcement of}} legal protection {{and the creation of}} specially <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> such as national parks and reserves. Examples of such <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> in the United States include Big Bend National Park, Texas; Joshua Tree National Park, California; and Saguaro National Park, Arizona. Latin American examples include Parque Nacional del Pinacate, Sonora, Mexico and Pan de Azúcar National Park, Chile. Ex situ conservation aims to preserve plants and seeds outside their natural habitats, often with the intention of later reintroduction. Botanical gardens {{play an important role in}} ex situ conservation; for example, seeds of cacti and other succulents are kept in long-term storage at the Desert Botanical Garden, Arizona.|$|E

5|$|It may {{always have}} been thinly spread, {{but there has been}} {{widespread}} deforestation within its range resulting in loss and fragmentation of suitable habitat. The rail has been protected under Indonesian law since 1972, and the large Lore Lindu and Bogani Nani Wartabone National Parks are within its range, but logging and rattan cutting occurs even in these <b>protected</b> <b>areas,</b> and human encroachment is also a problem at Lore Lindu. The rail has been trapped for food in the past, and is sometimes killed by dogs, cats and other introduced predators. A 2007 survey of <b>protected</b> <b>areas</b> of Sulawesi failed to find the rail, suggesting that it is genuinely rare even in reserves.|$|E
