40|$|<b>Poly(sulphur</b> oxide) {{has been}} {{prepared}} by the low temperature thermal decomposition of the lower oxides of sulphur. This yellow, elastic solid resists water hydrolysis. It is unstable at room temperature when stored under vacuum and decomposes slowly to a powdery yellow white cyclic(sulphur oxide) and sulphur dioxide. In the presence of silicon tetrachloride, the thermal decomposition gives rise to an adduct of the lower oxide of sulphur along with the <b>poly(sulphur</b> oxide). The adduct hydrolyses to silica, hydrogen chloride, hydrogen sulphide and hydrogen sulphite. Based on {{the analysis of the}} hydrolysed products and the IR data, the adduct is assigned a formula of $SiCl_{ 4 }* 2 (SO) $, in which the silicon is hexacoordinated...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{overview}} of the development of organic photovoltaics is given, with emphasis on polymer-based solar cells. The observation of photoconductivity in solid anthracene {{in the beginning of the}} 19 th century marked the start of this field. The first real investigations of photovoltaic (PV) devices came in the 1950 s, where a number of organic dyes, particularly chlorophyll and related compounds, were studied. In the 1980 s the first polymers (including <b>poly(sulphur</b> nitride) and polyacetylene) were investigated in PV cells. However, simple PV devices based on dyes or polymers yield limited power conversion efficiencies (PCE), typically well below 0. 1 %. A major breakthrough came in 1986 when Tang discovered that bringing a donor and an acceptor together in one cell could dramatically increase the PCE to 1 %. This concept of heterojunction has since been widely exploited in a number of donorâ€“ acceptor cells, including dye/dye, polymer/dye, polymer/polymer and polymer/fullerene blends. Due to the high electron affinity of fullerene, polymer/fullerene blends have been subject to particular investigation during the past decade. Earlier problems in obtaining efficient charge carrier separation have been overcome and PCE of more than 3 % have bee...|$|E
