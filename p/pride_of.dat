40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2012 I {{argue that}} there are two sorts <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> [...] the emotion <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> and the {{character}} trait <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> [...] and defend descriptive and normative accounts of each sort <b>of</b> <b>pride.</b> The emotion <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> involves an evaluation that one is living in accordance with one's personal ideals; having the character trait <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> is having a firm commitment to living in accordance with one's personal ideals. Thus, the two sorts <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> are conceptual related insofar as they each embody a distinct aspect of the moral psychology of personal ideals: the emotion embodies the evaluative use of personal ideals, whereas the character trait embodies the practical influence of personal ideals. In Chapter 1, I outline and defend a conceptual framework for analyzing emotions that distinguishes between two kinds of considerations that may count in favor of having an emotion. In Chapter 2, I survey the philosophical literature on the emotion <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> and argue that extant accounts <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> are classifiable into three groups: identification accounts, agency accounts, and possession accounts. I argue that each of the three sorts of accounts has significant merits, but that each ultimately fails to provide a satisfactory descriptive account <b>of</b> <b>pride.</b> In Chapter 3, I develop and defend personal ideal-based descriptive and normative accounts of the emotion <b>of</b> <b>pride.</b> In Chapter 4, I provide a relational account of personal ideals that solves two puzzles about pride: the sociality puzzle (to explain how pride can be both a profoundly personal and a deeply social phenomenon) and the hierarchy puzzle (to explain how pride can be implicated in the social dynamics of both hierarchy and solidarity). In Chapter 5, I defend a descriptive and a normative account of the character trait <b>of</b> <b>pride</b> in terms <b>of</b> being firmly committed to living in accordance with one's personal ideals...|$|R

However, while Pipp was hit in the head by a pitch from Caldwell and was hospitalized, this event occurred on July 2, a month after Pipp's benching.|$|E
5|$|Between World War I and World War II, the Auxois was the <b>pride</b> <b>of</b> {{regional}} farmers. Before {{the advent}} of motorization, it was the preferred pulling animal, even for slow work, winning out over the local Charolais cattle breed used as oxen. The Auxois was bred solely for agricultural work, and used exclusively for this purpose. The strongest horses were used for multi-horse hitches {{in the fields and}} for logging. The Auxois competed in popularity with the Nivernais horse, and it was not uncommon for farmers in the region to have both the black-coated Nivernais and the red-coated Ardennais and Auxois to satisfy the color preferences of all potential buyers.|$|E
5|$|Bitterness {{between the}} Assyrians and the Arabs was {{reported}} by British historians {{as far back as}} 1920.

This, coupled {{with the fact that the}} British and Assyrian levies succeeded in suppressing Kurdish revolts when the Iraqi Army failed created an inferiority complex among some Iraqi corps towards the British and the Assyrians.|$|E

5|$|Certain {{scenes in}} Cannibal Holocaust {{have also been}} noted as being similar to scenes in Antonio Climati's Mondo film Savana violenta, {{specifically}} the scene in which Monroe bathes naked in {{the river and the}} scene of the forced abortion rite. The cinéma vérité style used heavily in Cannibal Holocaust was also used before in Climati's first Mondo film, Ultime grida dalla savana, in a scene where a tourist is attacked and killed by a <b>pride</b> <b>of</b> lions. Another scene, in which a native man is captured, tortured, and murdered by mercenaries in South America, uses a similar filming style, and both scenes may have been influential on Deodato's direction.|$|E
