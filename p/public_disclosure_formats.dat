40|$|Firms {{normally}} disclose {{quality information}} to consumers using two alternative formats: either directly to consumers or indirectly through downstream retailers. This study investigates optimal disclosure strategies/formats in a channel setting with bilateral monopolies. It shows that retail disclosure leads to more equilibrium information revelation. This is because the manufacturer can, through wholesale price cuts, partially absorb the retailer's effective disclosure cost and thus increase the retailer's incentive for disclosure. The conditions under which a particular <b>disclosure</b> <b>format</b> arises as the manufacturer's optimal choice are also examined. Even though direct disclosure is the ex post dominated option, the manufacturer may benefit from committing ex ante to the direct <b>disclosure</b> <b>format</b> when the cost of disclosure is sufficiently high. communication, <b>disclosure,</b> <b>disclosure</b> <b>format,</b> distribution channel, quality...|$|R

40|$|Supporters of <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> of {{personal}} tax information point to its deterrent effect on tax evasion, but this effect {{has not been}} empirically explored. Although Norway {{has a long tradition}} of <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> of tax filings, it took a new direction in 2001 when anyone with access to the Internet could obtain individual information on income, wealth, and income and wealth taxes paid. We exploit this change in the degree of exposure to identify the effects of <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> on income reporting. Identification of the deterrence effects of <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> is facilitated by the fact that, prior to the shift to the Internet in 2001, some municipalities had exposure which was close to the Internet type of <b>public</b> <b>disclosure,</b> as tax information was distributed widely through paper catalogues that were locally produced and disseminated. We observe income changes that are consistent with <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> deterring tax evasion: an approximately 3 percent average increase in reported income is found among business owners living in areas where the switch to Internet disclosure represented a large change in access...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – This study {{seeks to}} measure the level of {{responsible}} investment (RI) disclosure of the world's largest pension funds. Design/methodology/approach – The <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> of environmental, social and governance factors by the world's largest pension funds reflect their genuine commitment to this new investment paradigm. The UNPRI criterion is employed {{to measure the}} level of <b>public</b> <b>disclosure.</b> One hour was allocated to every asset owner's web site to search and collect public information. Findings – Overall, the level of <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> of RI activities is not prolific. The study is negatively influenced by North American pension funds who dominate this sample. <b>Public</b> <b>disclosure</b> practices are positive for European funds. The size of funds under management positively influences the <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> and reflects their leadership role in the industry. Research limitations/implications – Limitations include: the largest pension funds are dominated by North American funds and reflect the impact of fund size. The results are from the largest pension funds {{and may not be}} representative of the entire industry; the positive findings from European funds reflect a material subset of the global asset owners; and, we do not engage directly with the funds in question. Measurements are sourced from <b>public</b> <b>disclosure.</b> Originality/value – The lack of <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> of RI by North American funds suggests that these institutions do not believe {{that it is important to}} investors. It suggests that these asset owners have not yet been exposed to the same influences as European funds. Given that North American funds together own substantial interests in listed corporations, they are much more important to influence than corporations.

50|$|<b>Public</b> <b>disclosure</b> is any non-confidential {{communication}} {{which an}} inventor or invention owner makes available {{to one or}} more members of the public, revealing the existence of the invention and enabling an appropriately experienced individual ("person having ordinary skill in the art") to reproduce the invention. In the U.S., <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> of an invention results in the loss of patentability of the invention after a period of one year. In other countries, <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> may result in the immediate loss of invention patentability unless a patent application has already been filed, and disclosure may be considered to include oral as well as written communication.|$|R

40|$|This study {{examined}} the therapeutic impact of <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> for survivors of sexual assault. The purpose was to identify how <b>disclosure</b> in a <b>public</b> setting affected the recovery process of survivors of sexual assault. Three adult women were interviewed about their experiences. This study analyzed the meaning of <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> for these women {{in order to understand}} if it had therapeutic value in their recoveries. Each woman indicated that <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> helped strengthen her recovery. <b>Public</b> <b>disclosure</b> helped these women connect with other survivors and supporters, which assisted in alleviating feelings of shame. There is a need to study <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> for survivors of sexual assault further, but this study found that it can be helpful during recovery.

As a result, defendants frequently used the <b>public</b> <b>disclosure</b> bar as a defense to a plaintiff's claims and grounds for dismissal of the same. PPACA amended the language of the FCA to allow the federal government to have the final word on whether a court may dismiss a case based on a <b>public</b> <b>disclosure.</b> The language now provides that [...] "the court shall dismiss an action unless opposed by the Government, if substantially the same allegations or transaction alleged in the action or claim were publicly disclosed."
