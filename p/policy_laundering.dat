Looking at the instruments and proposals put in place by a number of institutions including the United Nations (UN), the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the European Union, the book begins by reclassifying and expanding the traditional global anti-laundering policy to include aspects such as having a national money laundering strategy in place, the implementation of international instruments and the role of government and regulatory agencies. Ryder then offers a comparative analytical review of the anti-money <b>laundering</b> <b>policies</b> adopted in the United States of America, Canada, the United Kingdom and Australia and considers to what extent they have followed and implemented the identified global anti-money <b>laundering</b> <b>policy.</b> Money <b>Laundering</b> – An Endless Cycle? will be of particular interest to academics and students in the fields of Law, Finance, Banking and Criminology...|$|R

50|$|Since ACTA is an {{international}} treaty, it {{is an example of}} <b>policy</b> <b>laundering</b> used to establish and implement legal changes. <b>Policy</b> <b>laundering</b> allows legal provisions to be pushed through via closed negotiations among private members of the executive bodies of the signatories. This method avoids use of public legislation and its judiciary oversight. Once ratified, companies belonging to non-members may be forced to follow the ACTA requirements since they will otherwise fall out of the safe harbor protections.

40|$|Anti-money <b>laundering</b> <b>policy</b> {{has become}} a major issue in the Western world, {{especially}} in the United States after 9 - 11. Basically all countries in the world are more or less forced to cooperate in the global fight against money laundering. In this paper, the criminalization of money laundering is modelled, assuming rational behaviour of criminals, following the law and economics strand of the literature which is described as the economics of crime. The theoretical model shows that a) the probability to be caught for money laundering, b) the sentence for money laundering, c) the probability to be convicted for the predicate crime and d) the transaction costs of money laundering are negatively related to the amount of crime. Under the assumption that these factors are all positively influenced by a stricter anti-money <b>laundering</b> <b>policy,</b> the hypothesis empirically tested in this paper is that anti-money <b>laundering</b> <b>policy</b> deters potential criminals from illegal behavior and therefore lowers the crime rate. Since the data on anti-money <b>laundering</b> <b>policy,</b> used in the literature so far, is not all-embracing, a new unique indicator is constructed by using all the information from the mutual evaluation reports on money laundering of the FATF, IMF and World Bank. This unique dataset is used in an empirical estimation based on a Mundlak specification to test the effect of antimoney <b>laundering</b> <b>policy</b> on the crime rate. Among the four policy areas measured – the role of laws, the institutional framework, the duties of the private sector in law enforcement, and international cooperation, the latter {{turned out to be the}} most important policy area for reducing crime. This should be an extra incentive for countries and international organizations to continue their efforts to promote and develop international cooperation in the fight against money laundering...|$|R

Regulations can change in any direction, however: regulations may be pushed to the lowest common denominator; but may equally benefit from the 'California effect', where one regulator pushes for the highest standards, setting models for others to follow. Harmonization requires further interrogation, however. In their review of global business regulation, Braithwaite and Drahos find that some countries (notably the U.S. and the UK) push for certain regulatory standards in international bodies and then bring those regulations home under the requirement of harmonization and the guise of multilateralism; this is what we refer to as <b>policy</b> <b>laundering.</b> Ian Hosein, 2004 ...|$|E

40|$|The Anti-counterfeiting Trade Agreement (ACTA) {{is being}} {{considered}} by the Obama Administration as an Executive Order. If signed, this Order will greatly enhance controls placed at the borders of 36 countries to attempt to stop the international flow of so-called counterfeit goods. To remove the social, political and emotional sensitivity, I adopt the value neutral term of “imitative commodity” to describe what some call counterfeits, knockoffs, pirates, etc. This article uses just three manufacturers of luxury status goods to consider whether the ACTA will have positive or negative consequences. It concludes that the data supporting {{the need for the}} ACTA is overstated and unverified, that the ACTA is actually not responsive to the precise problem which it purports to correct, that the ACTA merely acts a <b>policy</b> <b>laundering</b> getting the Obama Administration something they fear they could not get in the public law forum, and consists of vague and misdirected border measures and criminal provisions. The ACTA is raised in the context of international terrorism supporting and/or maintaining the imitative commodity industry. However, just like the value of the imitative commodity industry, the value of actual support the imitative commodity industry receives from terrorists and the benefit derived to terrorists is grossly overstated. In fact, there are many positive elements to imitative commodity. Some claim it is actually socially optimal to have some imitative commodity. Imitative commodities operate as free advertising for the legitimate good maker. Imitative commodities improve the goodwill of a legitimate good maker. The shear existence of imitative commodities allows legitimate high-end makers to sustain otherwise unsustainable prices for their luxury status goods. In the end, we have vilified imitative commodities makers without giving thorough and analytical thought to the economic, social or legal advantages made possible by some imitative commodities. This article is about quantity not quality. The ACTA operates as a sledge hammer to kill an ant. The ACTA works to make public the intellectual property rights of some manufacturers that used to be private. As such, the ACTA also operates as a corporate bailout.

40|$|Both in the US and in Europe {{anti money}} <b>laundering</b> <b>policy</b> {{switched}} from a rule- to a risk-based reporting system {{in order to}} avoid over-reporting by the private sector. However, reporting increased in most countries, while the quality of information decreased. Governments drowned in data because private agents feared sanctions for not reporting. This ``crying wolf'' problem. (Takats 2007) did not happen in the Netherlands, where the number of reports diminished but information quality improved. Reasons for this can be found in differences in legal institutions and legal culture, notably the contrast between US adversarial legalism and Dutch cooperative informalism. The established legal systems also provide for resistance to change. Thus lowering sanctions in order to reduce over-reporting may not be a realistic option in a legal system which traditionally uses deterrence by fierce criminal and private legal sanctions. Furthermore, a risk-based approach may not be sustainable in the long run, as litigation may eventually replace a risk-based approach again by a rule-based one, now with precise rules set by the courts. money laundering, anti money <b>laundering</b> <b>policy,</b> risk based regulation, rules, standards, comparison of legal systems, tort law...|$|R
