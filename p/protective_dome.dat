40|$|The Arctic is a {{challenging}} environment for making in-situ radiation measurements. A standard suite of radiation sensors is typically {{designed to measure}} the total, direct and diffuse components of incoming and outgoing broadband shortwave (SW) and broadband thermal infrared, or longwave (LW) radiation. Enhancements can include various sensors for measuring irradiance in various narrower bandwidths. Many solar radiation/thermal infrared flux sensors utilize <b>protective</b> glass <b>domes</b> and some are mounted on complex mechanical platforms (solar trackers) that rotate sensors and shading devices that track the sun. High quality measurements require striking a balance between locating sensors in a pristine undisturbed location free of artificial blockage (such as buildings and towers) and providing accessibility to allow operators to clean and maintain the instruments. Three significant sources of erroneous data include solar tracker malfunctions, rime/frost/snow deposition on the instruments and operational problems due to limited operator access in extreme weather conditions. In this study, a comparison is made between the global and component sum (direct [vertical component] + diffuse) shortwave measurements. The {{difference between these two}} quantities (that theoretically should be zero) is used to illustrate the magnitude and seasonality of radiation flux measurement problems. The problem of rime/frost/snow deposition is investigated in more detail for one case study utilizing both shortwave and longwave measurements. Solutions to these operational problems are proposed that utilize measurement redundancy, more sophisticated heating and ventilation strategies and a more systematic program of operational support and subsequent data quality protocols...|$|R
40|$|Ein mono-ellipsoider Strahlungsofen mit einer 1 kW Xenon-Kurzbogenlampe als Strahlungsquelle wurde entwickelt und gebaut. Die Probe wird im oberen Fokus des vertikal gerichteten Reflektors radiativ geheizt. Mit dem Ofen sind Untersuchungen an festen und geschmolzenen Proben bei Temperaturen bis {{mindestens}} 2500 K unter kontrollierter Atmosphäre möglich. Die Proben liegen auf einer kalten Unterlage, was eine Kontamination der Schmelze mit dem Tiegelmaterial verhindert. Während der Reaktion freiwerdende kondensierbare Gase wie z. B. Schwefel werden durch eine geeignete Strömungsführung von der Glaswand des Reaktorraums ferngehalten. Die heissen Produkte können bei Bedarf mit einem Hammer gequencht werden und stehen dann für chemische und/oder physikalische Analysen zur Verfügung. Die Evaluierung von Zink- und Kupferproduktionsprozessen anhand von Literaturdaten machte deutlich, dass die Emission des giftigen Schwefeldioxids bei den konventionellen Röst-Reduktions-Verfahren eine der grössten Herausforderungen der Nichteisen-Metall-Produktion darstellt. Es wurde die solare Extraktion von Zink und Kupfer direkt aus den Sulfiderzen, ohne den Schritt der problematischen Schwefelverbrennung, vorgeschlagen. Die prinzipielle Machbarkeit einer Kupfergewinnung direkt aus den Sulfiden konnte erfolgreich anhand von Zersetzungsexperimenten von synthetischem Kupferglanz und Kupferkies demonstriert werden. Beide synthetische Sulfide konnten im Strahlungsofen bei Temperaturen um 2500 K teilweise zu metallischem Kupfer reduziert werden. Dies bestätigte ausserdem die Leistungsfähigkeit des Strahlungsofens. Demnächst wird die online Temperaturmessmethode flash assisted multi-wavelength pyrometry (FAMP) implementiert. An imaging furnace for {{the investigation}} of materials at temperatures above 2500 K under controlled atmosphere has been built and characterized. The sample is radiatively heated by a 1 kW xenon short arc lamp placed in the upper focus of a vertically oriented mono-ellipsoidal reflector. By placing the sample on a water-cooled support contamination of the sample by crucible material is avoided. A remotely controlled hammer freezes the high-temperature composition of the sample by a fast quench. Thus, it can be analyzed later by conventional methods such as XRD or TEM. A <b>protective</b> glass <b>dome</b> enables to study samples which release condensable or corrosive gases. The dome itself is protected from condensable compounds by an appropriate laminar flow of inert gas. Measured peak flux densities clearly exceed 500 Wcm^{- 2 } required to access temperatures of at least 2500 K. On {{the basis of a}} literature survey processes for production of zinc and copper were analyzed. This showed that the emission of toxic sulfur dioxide during the conventional roasting reduction processes is the most challenging weakness of nonferrous metal mining industry. A direct solar extraction of zinc and copper from their sulfide ores without problematic burning of sulfur was thus proposed. The principal feasibility of direct extraction of copper was demonstrated by decomposition experiments with synthetic chalcocite and chalcopyrite. The two synthetic sulfides could be partially reduced to metallic copper in the imaging furnace at temperatures of about 2500 K. This also confirmed the good operation of the furnace. In the near future flash assisted multi-wavelength pyrometry (FAMP) will be implemented to measure sample temperatures online...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND AND OBJECTIVE: Lymphangiomas of {{the tongue}} and neck are {{uncommon}} benign congenital lymphatic tumors. These vascular lesions are difficult to treat, frequently recur, and can cause patients significant morbidity. Treatment may also be complicated by adjacent vital anatomic structures. Magnetic resonance (MR) -controlled laser-induced interstitial thermotherapy (LITT) has been {{proven to be a}} noninvasive safe treatment. Real-time monitoring of tissue temperature with thermosensitive sequences allows controlled coagulation necrosis. STUDY DESIGN/MATERIALS AND METHODS: LITT was performed in a lymphangioma specimen ex vivo. In four patients (eight procedures) with lymphangiomas {{of the tongue}} and neck, MR-guided LITT was performed with a percutaneous approach in a multiapplicator technique. The laser system consisted of a titanium catheter and a <b>protective</b> catheter. The <b>dome</b> of the fiber end had a diameter of 1. 4 mm with an active length of 20 mm. Temperature sensitive sequences were used in a 0. 5 T open-configured MR scanner with the proton frequency shift technique to map the spatial and temporal distribution of Nd:YAG laser effects (7 Watts, 30 pulses per second, 10 minutes/location). Postoperative MR follow-up was performed at 1 week and at 3 months. In three patients, partial resection of the tumor was performed 6 months after LITT. RESULTS: In three patients, MR clearly showed a diminished tumor volume. All four patients reported subjective amelioration and in three patients former functional problems, such as speech and swallowing were improved. MR thermometry allowed accurate demarcation of changes by heat and distinction of affected tumor volume (3. 0 cm +/- 0. 3 cm). The histology of the patients 6 months after LITT showed laser-induced fibrosis of former lymphatic tissue. CONCLUSION: The results suggest that LITT can be performed safely with tissue preserving of vital structures and can be effective in the treatment of deep tumors, such as lymphangiomas. However, given the nature of the lesion, the potential for recurrence exists no matter what modality is chosen...|$|R
50|$|Thal {{history was}} revised in Genesis of the Daleks (1975), {{in which they}} were {{depicted}} as having been involved in a generations-long war of attrition with the Kaleds. This transformed Skaro into a toxic wasteland, with the survivors of each race forced to live under their own huge, <b>protective</b> <b>dome.</b> The Kaled chief scientist, Davros, genetically engineers mutated members of the Kaled species and places the results into travel machines, which he names Daleks. Davros simultaneously provides the Thals with the technology they need to destroy the Kaled dome, so as to wipe out all opposition to his plan to create a species consisting of what he considers to be the ultimate Kaled form. He then sends the Daleks to the Thal dome, where they kill nearly all the inhabitants. A small group of Thals use explosives to seal the Daleks and Davros in a Kaled bunker but the Fourth Doctor speculates that they have only delayed the Dalek development and rise to power by a matter of centuries.|$|E

Orin's brother, Shalako, departed with a number of followers through underground tunnels in order to reclaim another sunken city of their empire, Tritonis, whose inhabitants had not survived. After a few years, Atlantean scientists developed a serum that would permanently let their people breathe underwater; as a consequence of the magic used by Shalako in settling Tritonis, the Tritonians were further mutated to have fish-tails instead of legs. Some descendents of Shalako's son Dardanus also inherited his telepathy, which was marked by blonde hair, extremely rare among Atlanteans.

5000|$|These removal {{actions were}} {{ineffective}} at making the park safe, particularly because the <b>protective</b> <b>dome</b> the city installed {{had not been}} maintained or checked and had cracked. [...] In 1993, the African American Development Organization lead a drive to force the government to evaluate {{the safety of the}} park, after a yellow-white substance had begun to ooze out of cracks in basketball courts in the park. [...] Later that same year, the City of Oakland fenced off the park and began testing the area, the EPA was also involved. The EPA's evaluation of the site found that soil lead levels as high as 6,700 ppm were still present in the park, as well as zinc levels in excess of 7,450 ppm, and arsenic levels in excess of 700ppm. The evaluation also found that residential properties within seven blocks of the park also had significantly elevated levels of lead, in some cases as high as 10,000 ppm. (84% of houses in the area were built before 1950, and were thus extant while the battery plant was still operational.) Elevated levels of lead, presumably from the park, were also found at a nearby elementary school. Although much of the contamination in these areas was likely due to the park, lead paint and leaded gas from nearby highways probably contributed to the contamination as well. An additional series of actions were taken by joint local, state, and federal agencies between 1993 and 1996 aimed to remediate the park and surrounding residential properties. [...] The park reopened in 1996, and cleanup of all nearby residential properties with a soil lead concentration >1000 ppm was performed by AlliedSignal (the owner of the plant, and its final completion was agreed to by the EPA in 2001 in a way that absolved AliedSignal of any future liability.|$|E

40|$|SLR 2000 is {{a concept}} for a totally {{automated}} subcentimeter SLR system presently being studied at GSFC. If funding permits, a prototype would be installed and tested at the Goddard Geophysical and Astronomical Observatory (GCAO) in FY 98 and {{a small number of}} automated stations would be fielded by the year 2000. Unlike present systems, the "SLR 2000 " system is being designed to: 1) operate autonomously without the need for onsite operators; 2) present no hazards (i. e., optical, electrical, and/or chemical) to personnel in the vicinity or to overflying aircraft; and 3) have a mean time between failures (MTBF) of at least three months. It is assumed that the systems are located at "friendly" sites where some level of security is provided and where certain low level service functions (e. g. commercial power, communications, heat pump service cleaning, etc.) are available or can be contracted for locally on an as-needed basis.

40|$|The 1 -meter Swedish Solar Telescope (SST) obtains {{images of}} the solar surface with an {{unprecedented}} resolution of 0. 1 arcsec. It consists of a relatively slender tower with on top only the vacuum turret for reflecting downward the solar beam and no <b>protective</b> <b>dome.</b> This is a favourable situation to get good local seeing.

To reduce the risk on stick-slip a special design of the teeth for high stiffness combined with low friction and smooth transition from one tooth to the next was made. Furthermore, extreme precision in the fabrication was pursued such that relatively small contact forces give already line contact. This required a special order of the successive fabrication steps of the combination of bearing and gear teeth.
