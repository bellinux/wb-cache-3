5|$|During {{the civil}} war and the ensuing Soviet war in Afghanistan, most of the country's {{infrastructure}} was destroyed. Normal patterns of economic activity were disrupted. The Gross national product (GNP) fell substantially during Karmal's rule because of the conflict; trade and transport was disrupted with loss of labor and capital. In 1981 the Afghan GDP stood at 154.3 billion Afghan afghanis, a drop from 159.7 billion in 1978. GNP per capita decreased from 7,370 in 1978 to 6,852 in 1981. The dominant form of economic activity was in the agricultural sector. Agriculture accounted for 63 {{percent of gross domestic product}} (GDP) in 1981; 56 percent of the labor force was working in agriculture in 1982. Industry accounted for 21 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>GDP</b> in 1982, and employed 10 percent of the labor force. All industrial enterprises were government-owned. The service sector, the smallest of the three, accounted for 10 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>GDP</b> in 1981, and employed an estimated one-third of the labour force. The balance of payments, which had grown in the pre-communist administration of Muhammad Daoud Khan, decreased, turning negative by 1982 at 70.3 million $US. The only economic activity which grew substantially during Karmal's rule was export and import.|$|E
5|$|Other key {{sectors of}} the Turkish economy are banking, construction, home appliances, electronics, textiles, oil refining, {{petrochemical}} products, food, mining, iron and steel, and machine industry. In 2010, the agricultural sector accounted for 9 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>GDP,</b> while the industrial sector accounted for 26 percent and the services sector for 65 percent. However, agriculture still accounted {{for a quarter of}} employment. In 2004, it was estimated that 46 percent of total disposable income was received by the top 20 percent of income earners, while the lowest 20 percent received only 6 percent. The rate of female employment in Turkey was 30 percent in 2012, the lowest among all OECD countries.|$|E
5|$|The euro was {{established}} by the provisions in the 1992 Maastricht Treaty. To participate in the currency, member states are meant to meet strict criteria, such as a budget deficit of less than three percent of their GDP, a debt ratio of less than sixty <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>GDP</b> (both of which were ultimately widely flouted after introduction), low inflation, and interest rates close to the EU average. In the Maastricht Treaty, the United Kingdom and Denmark were granted exemptions per their request from moving to the stage of monetary union {{which resulted in the}} introduction of the euro.|$|E

5|$|Bulgaria has a {{universal}} healthcare system financed by taxes and contributions. The National Health Insurance Fund (NHIF) pays a gradually increasing {{portion of the}} costs of primary healthcare. Projected healthcare expenditures for 2013 amount to 4.1 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>GDP.</b> The number of doctors is above the EU average with 181 physicians per 100,000 people, but distribution by fields of practice is uneven, there is a severe shortage of nurses and other medical personnel, and the quality of most medical facilities is poor. Personnel shortages in some fields are so severe that patients resort to seeking treatment in neighboring countries. Bulgaria ranks 121st globally by average life expectancy, which stands at 74.5 years for both genders. The primary causes of death are similar to those in other industrialised countries, mainly cardiovascular diseases, neoplasms and respiratory diseases.|$|E
5|$|On 18 May 2014, Portugal {{left the}} EU bailout {{mechanism}} without additional need for support, {{as it had}} already regained a complete access to lending markets back in May 2013, and with its latest issuing of a 10-year government bond being successfully completed with a rate as low as 3.59%. Portugal still has many tough years ahead. During the crisis, Portugal's government debt increased from 93 to 139 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>GDP.</b> On 3 August 2014, Banco de Portugal announced the country's second biggest bank Banco Espirito Santo would be split in two after losing the equivalent of $4.8 billion in the first 6 months of 2014, sending its shares down by 89 percent.|$|E
5|$|Some Australian {{politicians}} and defense commentators proposed that Australia {{should attempt to}} purchase F-22s instead of the planned F-35s, citing the F-22's known capabilities and F-35's delays and developmental uncertainties. However, the Royal Australian Air Force (RAAF) determined that the F-22 was unable to perform the F-35's strike and close air support roles. The Japanese government also showed interest in the F-22 for its Replacement-Fighter program. The Japan Air Self-Defense Force (JASDF) would reportedly require fewer fighters for its mission if it obtained the F-22, thus reducing engineering and staffing costs. However, in 2009 {{it was reported that}} acquiring the F-22 would require increases to the defense budget beyond the historical 1 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>GDP.</b> With the end of F-22 production, Japan chose the F-35 in December 2011. Israel also expressed interest, but eventually chose the F-35 because of the F-22's price and unavailability.|$|E

5|$|A second {{important}} {{factor is the}} success of the IMF Stand-By-Arrangement in the country since November 2008. The SBA includes three pillars. The first pillar is a program of medium term fiscal consolidation, involving painful austerity measures and significant tax hikes. The result has been that central government debts have been stabilised at around 80–90 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>GDP.</b> A second pillar is the resurrection of a viable but sharply downsized domestic banking system on the ruins of its gargantuan international banking system which the government was unable to bail out. A third pillar is the enactment of capital controls and the work to gradually lift these to restore normal financial linkages with the outside world. An important result of the emergency legislation and the SBA is that the country has not been seriously affected by the European sovereign debt crisis from 2010. Despite a contentious debate with Britain and the Netherlands over the question of a state guarantee on the Icesave deposits of Landsbanki in these countries, credit default swaps on Icelandic sovereign debt have steadily declined from over 1000 points prior to the crash in 2008 to around 200 points in June 2011. The fact that the assets of the failed Landsbanki branches are now estimated to cover most of the depositor claims has had an influence to ease concerns over the situation.|$|E

Under a $4 trillion deficit reduction scenario for that decade, federal debt held by the public would fall to 42 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>GDP</b> in 2039.

25|$|The International Monetary Fund 2014 Country Report {{described}} {{the effect of}} the global financial crisis (GFC) as reducing demand for the services of Tuvaluan seafarers. As of October 2013, there were about 112 Tuvalu seafarers working on cargo boats, compared to 361 in 2006. The consequence is that remittances from seafarers to their families in Tuvalu fell by about 9 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>GDP</b> for Tuvalu.

25|$|If current laws {{remained}} generally unchanged in the future, {{federal debt}} {{held by the}} public would decline slightly relative to GDP {{over the next few}} years.

Twenty-five years from now, in 2039, federal debt held by the public would exceed 100 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>GDP.</b> Moreover, debt would be on an upward path relative {{to the size of the}} economy, a trend that could not be sustained indefinitely. By 2039, the deficit would equal 6.5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>GDP,</b> larger than in any year between 1947 and 2008, and federal debt held by the public would reach 106 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>GDP,</b> more than in any year except 1946—even without factoring in the economic effects of growing debt.|$|E
