40|$|<b>Patient</b> {{empowerment}} <b>and</b> <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> public involvement are a {{focus for}} NHS policy, {{with an emphasis on}} <b>patient</b> decision making <b>and</b> representation as core features of a patient-focused NHS. <b>Patient</b> empowerment <b>and</b> <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> public involvement imply a rebalancing of power in the nurse-patient relationship. In reality this is complicated by wider issues of power and control in a complex health service influenced by professional agendas, healthcare leadership, government targets and a developing business culture. Despite these ideological and organisational constraints, there are many ways in which nurses can support aspects of individual <b>patient</b> empowerment <b>and</b> <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> public involvement...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Clinical {{practice}} guidelines (CPG) {{are important}} tools for improving <b>patient</b> care. <b>Patient</b> <b>and</b> public involvement is recognised {{as an essential}} component of CPG development and implementation. The Guideline International Network <b>Patient</b> <b>and</b> Public Involvement Working Group (G-I-N PUBLIC) aims to support the development, implementation and evaluation of guideline-oriented <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> public involvement programmes (PPIPs). OBJECTIVE: To develop an international practice and research agenda on <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> public involvement in CPG. METHOD: 56 CPG developers, researchers, and patient/public representatives from 14 different countries, were consulted in an international workshop. Recommendations were validated with G-I-N PUBLIC steering committee members. RESULTS: Many CPG organisations have set up PPIPs that use a range of participation, consultation and communication methods. Current PPIPs aim to improve the quality and responsiveness of CPGs to public expectations and needs, or to foster individual healthcare decisions. Some organisations use structured involvement methods, including providing training for <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> public representatives. A number of financial, organisational and sociopolitical barriers limit <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> public involvement. The paucity of process and impact evaluations limits our current understanding of the conditions under which <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> public involvement is most likely to be effective. CONCLUSION: Greater international collaboration and research are needed to strengthen existing knowledge, development <b>and</b> evaluation of <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> public involvement in CPG...|$|R

40|$|The {{present study}} {{describes}} {{the structure of}} nursing care on the first consultation brought by the third person. The third person is the person such as a neighbor, except for the <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> family members Data was collected from nursing practice on new 21 cases at a Home Care Support Center (HCSC). Nursing intentions were taken out from the nursing records and interviews with nurses on the first consultation to the third person who brought the consultation, and investigated the content and the construction. Nursing care for the third person had intention to identify the demand of the <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> family members with them, and also to grow the third person into a good support deliverer. Nursing care for the <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> family members included planning to deliver a immediate care by the nurse of the HCSC, and supporting the third person to deliver a good support to the <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> family members. The judgment on {{a connection between the}} third person <b>and</b> the <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> family members was done primarily. In conclusion, the structure of nursing care show that nurses consider the third person <b>and</b> the <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> family members as a unit. Nurses respect the autonomy of the <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> family members. On the other hand, nurses also support the third person to deliver good support autonomously. 当事者以外の者が持ち込んだ相談における看護援助の構造を明らかにすることにより,プライマリーレベルで対応する看護援助の特質を追究した。ひとつの在宅介護支援センターに当事者以外の住民が持ち込んだ相談 21 事例について,看護職による対応実績を,来談者に向けた対応意図及び当事者に向けた意図に分けて抽出し,内容・構成を検討した。来談者に向けた援助では,当事者の求めているものを共に確認することにより,支え手としての成長を助けていた。当事者に向けた援助は,看護職自らが当事者に会うことを計画する直接的方法と,来談者による適切な手助けを実現させる間接的方法があった。以上は,いずれも来談者・当事者間の関係の判断を起点としていた。以上から,来談者と当事者の双方を一組と捉えて対応し,当事者の主体性を確保した援助を第一に考えると同時に,来談者自身も主体性を持った支え手と捉えて働きかけるという,看護援助の構造的特質を明らかにした...|$|R

Methods: The QOL-AD Chinese version was established following standard guidelines for cross-cultural adaptation of measures. The reliability was assessed by internal consistency and test–retest reliability. The validity included construct and convergent validity. A paired Stu-dent t test was performed to determine differences between <b>patient</b> reports <b>and</b> caregiver reports. Results: The reliability for both <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> caregiver reports on the QOL-AD was good (Cronbach a values of 0. 66 and 0. 87; intraclass correlation coefficients of 0. 84 and 0. 90 for <b>patient</b> <b>and</b> caregiver reports, respectively).
