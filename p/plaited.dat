5|$|Another steep climb of 800 feet {{brought us}} to the Marei Parei spur, {{to the spot where}} the ground was covered with the {{magnificent}} pitcher-plants, of which we had come in search. This one has been called the Nepenthes Rajah, and is a plant about four feet in length, with broad leaves stretching on every side, having the great pitchers resting on the ground in a circle about it. Their shape and size are remarkable. I will give the measurement of one, to indicate the form: the length along the back nearly fourteen inches; from the base {{to the top of the}} column in front, five inches; and its lid a foot long by fourteen inches broad, and of an oval shape. Its mouth was surrounded by a <b>plaited</b> pile, which near the column was two inches broad, lessening in its narrowest part to three-quarters of an inch. The <b>plaited</b> pile of the mouth was also undulating in broad waves. Near the stem the pitcher is four inches deep, so that the mouth is situated upon it in a triangular manner. The colour of an old chalice is a deep purple, but that of the others is generally mauve outside, very dark indeed in the lower part, though lighter towards the rim; the inside is of the same colour, but has a kind of glazed and shiny appearance. The lid is mauve in the centre, shading to green at the edges. The stems of the female flowers we found always a foot shorter than those of the male, and the former were far less numerous than the latter. It is indeed one of the most astonishing productions of nature.|$|E
25|$|Modern slings are {{begun by}} {{plaiting}} the cord for the finger loop {{in the center}} of a double-length set of cords. The cords are then folded to form the finger-loop. The cords are <b>plaited</b> as a single cord to the pocket. The pocket is then <b>plaited,</b> most simply as another pair of cords, or with flat braids or a woven net. The remainder of the sling is <b>plaited</b> as a single cord, and then finished with a knot. Braided construction resists stretching, and therefore produces an accurate sling.|$|E

Plane cut-out and {{expansion}} method {{is used for}} clothing structure, based on clothing pattern design through paralleled expansion method and revolved expansion method. <b>Plait</b> is {{an important element of}} clothing design with strong 3 D effects which mainly includes natural <b>plait</b> and regular <b>plait.</b> Plane cut-out {{and expansion}} method should be used flexibly in order to design different styles of clothing <b>plaits.</b> The conclusion provides reference for costume styling designer. Preface <b>Plait</b> is an eternal fashion element in costume design with three dimensions. <b>Plait</b> is widely used not only in men’s, women’s and kid’s clothing, but also in detailed design and entire styling design. The pattern design includes graphic design method and 3 D structural method. 3 D structural method is better for <b>plait</b> style which has art infection such as exaggerated <b>plait</b> and ball-flower. However, it has a complicated process, detailed line and it is hard to handle. It needs long-term experience accumulation {{and it is difficult to}} spread. So this method is not good for volume production. As for pattern design method, which is preponderant to operate easily and quickly, is widely used to design costume <b>plait.</b> In the process of designing, changing component of width of the original pattern through plane cut-out and expansion method to make up a perfect costume <b>plait</b> style. Classifications of <b>plait</b> It is classified into natural <b>plait</b> and regular <b>plait</b> according to style characteristics. Natural <b>plait</b> is flowing, and it includes wavy <b>plait</b> and gathered <b>plait</b> as shown in Fig. 1. Regular <b>plait</b> shows regularly dynamic, including drape <b>plait</b> which has a difference between left and right, and tucker <b>plait</b> which makes a distinction into apparent and hiding <b>plait</b> (Fig. 2). For each kind of <b>plait,</b> the two component of width can be equaled, differed or even one component equals zero. (Tuck <b>plait)</b> (Drape <b>plait...</b>|$|R

5000|$|A Polish <b>plait</b> (Koltun in Polish, meaning [...] "Knot", {{but often}} {{referred}} to in English as an [...] "Elf-Lock") is a lock of matted hair similar to a dreadlock.

His courtiers were said to have adopted the hairstyle in order to flatter the king. Due to superstitious beliefs, the Polish <b>plait</b> used to be particularly common in Poland (hence its name).

25|$|In {{addition}} to straightforward theft, Paneb also resorted to misappropriating labour {{and other resources}} for his own ends.

In one case, he not only ordered his workers to make a <b>plaited</b> bed, but made their wives weave clothing for him. In addition, he stole several work tools, breaking one (Recto 2.13). Some tools were apparently of great value, as the workers searched for an entire month for a tool he stole before he snuck it back onto the worksite.|$|E
