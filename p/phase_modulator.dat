50|$|An optical {{modulator}} is an optical device {{which is used}} to modulate a beam of light with a perturbation device. It is a kind of transmitter to convert information to optical binary signal through optical fiber (optical waveguide) or transmission medium of optical frequency in fiber optic communication. There are several methods to manipulate this device depending on the parameter of a light beam like amplitude modulator (majority), <b>phase</b> <b>modulator,</b> polarization modulator etc.The easiest way to obtain modulation is modulation of intensity of a light by the current driving the light source (laser diode). This sort of modulation is called direct modulation, as opposed to the external modulation performed by a light modulator. For this reason, light modulators are called external light modulators.According to manipulation of the properties of material modulators are divided into two groups, absorptive modulators (absorption coefficient) and refractive modulators (refractive index of the material). Absorption coefficient can be manipulated by Franz-Keldysh effect, Quantum-Confined Stark Effect, excitonic absorption, or changes of free carrier concentration. Usually, if several such effects appear together, the modulator is called electro-absorptive modulator. Refractive modulators most often make use of electro-optic effect (amplitude & phase modulation), other modulators are made with acousto-optic effect, magneto-optic effect such as Faraday and Cotton-Mouton effects. The other case of modulators is spatial light modulator (SLM) which is modified two dimensional distribution of amplitude & phase of an optical wave.|$|E

In this dissertation, a phase-interpolator based open-loop <b>phase</b> <b>modulator</b> is proposed, which leverages a digital calibration technique to mitigate the sources of phase errors and achieves excellent phase resolution. At the heart of this technique, a time-to-digital converter performs high resolution measurement of phase errors of the <b>phase</b> <b>modulator.</b> These measurements are used to continuously pre-distort the modulation data, so that the linearity of the overall transfer function is enhanced, thereby resulting in low out-of-band emission and low in-band noise. A prototype IC was implemented in 0. 13 m CMOS process. Measurements on the prototype show that out-of-band quantization noise is 56 -dB lower than the signal when transmitting 20 -Mb/s GFSK signal and the r. m. s. error is only 3. 2 %.
