5|$|Many insects possess very {{sensitive}} and, or specialized organs of perception. Some insects such as bees can <b>perceive</b> ultraviolet wavelengths, or detect polarized light, while the antennae of male moths can detect the pheromones of female moths over distances of many kilometers. The yellow paper wasp (Polistes versicolor) {{is known for}} its wagging movements as a form of communication within the colony; it can waggle with a frequency of 10.6±2.1Hz (n=190). These wagging movements can signal the arrival of new material into the nest and aggression between workers can be used to stimulate others to increase foraging expeditions. There is a pronounced tendency for there to be a trade-off between visual acuity and chemical or tactile acuity, such that most insects with well-developed eyes have reduced or simple antennae, and vice versa. There are a variety of different mechanisms by which insects <b>perceive</b> sound; while the patterns are not universal, insects can generally hear sound if they can produce it. Different insect species can have varying hearing, though most insects can hear only a narrow range of frequencies related to the frequency of the sounds they can produce. Mosquitoes have been found to hear up to 2kHz, and some grasshoppers can hear up to 50kHz. Certain predatory and parasitic insects can detect the characteristic sounds made by their prey or hosts, respectively. For instance, some nocturnal moths can <b>perceive</b> the ultrasonic emissions of bats, which helps them avoid predation. Insects that feed on blood have special sensory structures that can detect infrared emissions, and use them to home in on their hosts.|$|E

Despite these interests, little research has addressed the <b>perceived</b> value construct, {{and there is no}} well-accepted <b>perceived</b> value measure. This thesis aims at developing, testing, and applying a <b>perceived</b> value measure, while demonstrating its application in management. It also sets out to test a set of antecedent and consequent relationships to explore influences on, and behavioural outcomes of <b>perceived</b> value in the parcel postal industry. <b>Perceived</b> value is defined in this thesis as the judgement by the consumer of the associated <b>perceived</b> benefits offered by (or linked to) a product or service, when the associated sacrifices have been evaluated or assessed (assuming that through the evaluation process one may either reduce, eliminate or ignore any associated sacrifices). Using <b>perceived</b> risk as a focal measure of associated sacrifices to determine <b>perceived</b> value, the various dimensions of <b>perceived</b> value were researched. Data were collected using a questionnaire which assessed the various dimensions of <b>perceived</b> risk. Since these dimensions provide a <b>perceived</b> risk measure, this measure was then used to assess <b>perceived</b> value and other service evaluation constructs. A model is suggested which shows the relationships between <b>perceived</b> risk, <b>perceived</b> value, satisfaction, and behavioural intentions. It was found that there is an average, and direct negative relationship between <b>perceived</b> risk and <b>perceived</b> value. Also, there is a strong, direct and positive relationship between <b>perceived</b> value and satisfaction, and an average, and direct positive relationship between <b>perceived</b> value and behavioural intentions. The relationships between <b>perceived</b> risk and satisfaction, <b>perceived</b> risk and behavioural intentions were found to be partially mediated by <b>perceived</b> value. Also, the effect of <b>perceived</b> value on behavioural intentions was found to be partially mediated by satisfaction. This thesis provides academics with a new conceptualisation and framework for further research into the <b>perceived</b> value concept.
