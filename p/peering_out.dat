5|$|Landing safely on the Moon, {{the astronomers}} {{get out of}} the capsule (without the need of space suits) and watch the Earth rise in the distance. Exhausted by their journey, they unroll their {{blankets}} and sleep. As they sleep, a comet passes, the Big Dipper appears with human faces <b>peering</b> <b>out</b> of each star, old Saturn leans out of a window in his ringed planet, and Phoebe, goddess of the Moon, appears seated in a crescent-moon swing. Phoebe causes a snowfall that awakens the astronomers, and they seek shelter in a cavern where they discover giant mushrooms. One astronomer opens his umbrella; it promptly takes root and turns into a giant mushroom itself.|$|E
25|$|The {{first scene}} opens in the McArdle's stateroom. Teddy is {{standing}} on his father’s expensive suitcase, <b>peering</b> <b>out</b> of the porthole. Mr. McArdle, apparently hung-over, is attempting to verbally assert control over his son; Mrs. McArdle indulges the boy as a provocative counterpoint to her husband’s bullying: neither adult has any real impact on the child's behavior.|$|E

25|$|A mega mural was {{installed}} {{on the top floor}} of the signal station in March 2015; the mural is part of the City of Fremantle's cultural development plan. The mural by artist Nami Osaki depicts a girl and dingo in a Japanese manga style reflecting the site's indigenous history. It wraps around the whole building, with the girl positioned so as to be <b>peering</b> <b>out</b> over the river while she sits with her dingo at a camp fire.|$|E
25|$|Usually {{referred}} to in works on architecture as foliate heads or foliate masks, carvings of the Green Man may take many forms, naturalistic or decorative. The simplest depict a man's face <b>peering</b> <b>out</b> of dense foliage. Some may have leaves for hair, perhaps with a leafy beard. Often leaves or leafy shoots are shown growing from his open mouth and sometimes even from the nose and eyes as well. In the most abstract examples, the carving at first glance appears to be merely stylised foliage, with the facial element only becoming apparent on closer examination. The face is almost always male; green women are rare.|$|E

500|$|The artwork for Subterranean Jungle {{features}} {{an image of}} the band inside a subway car. The photograph was taken by George DuBose at the subway station on 57th Street and Sixth Avenue in Manhattan. This cover concept was designed by Dubose, who suggested that since the B Sixth Avenue Express train stopped at the empty station for about 20 minutes. In the photograph, Marky is featured <b>peering</b> <b>out</b> the subway window—Marky was positioned this way after Johnny asked DuBose to do so because [...] "they were kicking him out of the band, but he didn't know it yet." [...] Marky recalled that he [...] "liked that shot, but [...] knew something was up." ...|$|E
500|$|Herman Bang's {{novel was}} {{inspired}} by an incident in 1883 when he was passing through Skørping Station {{in the north of}} Jutland. He noticed a young woman at the window who, her pale face couched in her hands, stared after his departing train. In the introduction to Stille Eksistenser he explains: [...] "For the rest of the journey, I could see the woman's face between the flowers. Her look was not quite one of longing — longing would have perhaps fluttered to death by breaking its wings in such tight confines — just a quite resignation, a waning sorrow. And when the train had slid by, she would be <b>peering</b> <b>out</b> with the same look over Egnens Lyng — over the dreary plain." ...|$|E
500|$|Towards {{the end of}} the engagement, Worden {{directed}} Williams {{to steer}} Monitor around the stern of Confederate ironclad, where Lieutenant Wood fired his 7-inch Brooke gun at the vessel's pilothouse, striking the forward side directly beneath the sight hold, cracking the structural [...] "iron log" [...] along the base of the narrow opening just as Worden was <b>peering</b> <b>out.</b> Worden was heard to have cried out, My eyes—I am blind! Others in the pilothouse had also been hit with fragments and were also bleeding. Temporarily blinded by shell fragments and gunpowder residue from the explosion and believing the pilothouse to be severely damaged, Worden ordered Williams to sheer off into shallow water, where Virginia with her deep draft could not follow. There Monitor drifted idly for about twenty minutes. At the time the pilothouse was struck Worden's injury was only known to those in the pilothouse and immediately nearby. With Worden severely wounded, command passed to the Executive Officer, Samuel Greene. Taken by surprise and confused he hesitated briefly and was undecided as to what action to take next, but after assessing the damage soon ordered Monitor to return to the battle area.|$|E

500|$|There {{are only}} a handful of {{existing}} ceramic models of multi-story towers from pre-Han and Western Han eras; the bulk of the hundreds of towers found so far were made during the Eastern Han period. Model towers could be fired as one piece in the kiln or assembled from several different ceramic pieces to create the whole. No one tower is a duplicate of the other, yet they share common features. They often had a walled courtyard at the bottom, a balcony with balustrades and windows for every floor, roof tiles capping and concealing the ceiling rafters, human figures <b>peering</b> <b>out</b> the windows or standing on the balconies, door knockers, and pets such as dogs in the bottom courtyard. Perhaps the most direct pieces of evidence to suggest that miniature ceramic tower models are faithful representations of real-life Han timber towers are tile patterns. Artistic patterns found on the circular tiles that cap the eave-ends on the miniature models are exact matches of patterns found on real-life Han roof tiles excavated at sites such as the royal palaces in Chang'an and Luoyang, and even the tiles of the original White Horse Temple. The ceramic model towers featured below come from tombs of the Han dynasty: ...|$|E

2500|$|Unfortunately for Lane, in 1989, {{the appeal}} of the Guildford Four proved police {{malpractice}} conclusively. In this case, Lane overturned the convictions. One observer described his appearance: [...] "The Lord Chief Justice seemed to sniff something nasty in the air. <b>Peering</b> <b>out</b> over half-moon spectacles, Lord Lane's weary face was the mask of Justice embarrassed." [...] Lane refused to free Paul Hill, one of the Four, because of a separate conviction for murder in Northern Ireland, although this later turned out also to have been a wrongful conviction.|$|E
2500|$|The {{newspapers}} lampooned Lincoln for slipping through Baltimore in {{the dead}} of night. Adalbert J. Volck, a Baltimore dentist and caricaturist, was inspired to pen his famous satirical etching [...] "Passage through Baltimore". Volck's image of a startled Lincoln in his nightshirt <b>peering</b> <b>out</b> of the side of his rail car as it passes through Baltimore {{has become part of the}} Lincoln iconography. [...] "In the nineteenth century, when pictures were less common and more prized, the scotch-cap symbol remained a prop in Confederate graphics, and some Northern-made prints as well, for years—the reminder of Lincoln fleeing in disguise an automatic accusation of his supposed lack of character." ...|$|E

2500|$|Stories {{of alleged}} ghostly {{phenomena}} at the Stephenson House {{date back to}} at least the 1970s. Speculation about {{the identity of the}} purported spirit has centered around Benjamin Stephenson, who died in the house. One former resident, who lived in the house during the 1970s told a local newspaper about phantom footsteps, odd noises, and the appearance of someone on the terrace when no one was there. Members of the Sigma Phi Epsilon fraternity recalled similar and different incidents. Former fraternity members reported, not only the phantom footsteps, but servants <b>peering</b> <b>out</b> from behind mirrors and [...] "people" [...] in military uniforms. A Stephenson House volunteer and Edwardsville historian reported that in her years of work at the house she has yet to experience any ghostly phenomena.|$|E
2500|$|United for Peace and Justice (UFPJ), a {{coalition}} of more than 1,300 international and U.S.-based organizations opposed to what they describe as [...] "our government's policy of permanent warfare and empire-building" [...] organized the March 19 actions. The events – involving up to 1000 people – took place throughout the downtown with protesters marching on 12th street to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) building on Constitution Avenue declaring {{that they do not}} want any more tax money being used to wage war. Led, in part, by the War Resisters League and Code Pink, 31 people were arrested for crossing police lines at the IRS and blocking three entrances. [...] Demonstrators also gathered in front of institutions which profit from the war, such as the American Petroleum Institute – where they staged a sit-in blocking traffic – and at military recruitment offices. The protesters, including war veterans, demanded the arrests of President George W. Bush, Vice President Dick Cheney and Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as war criminals. Students for a Democratic Society protesters marched up and down K Street as part of their [...] "Funk the War" [...] protest to [...] "put on the map all the people who profited from the war". Other protesters hurled balloons full of red paint at a military recruiting station and smeared it on buildings of defense contractors Bechtel and Lockheed Martin. Many protesters marched to beating drums, and chanted, [...] "No blood for oil!" [...] Traffic in many areas was disrupted, and interruptions at the IRS were evident as workers inside were seen <b>peering</b> <b>out</b> windows at the protesters. At least thirty demonstrators were arrested around the IRS headquarters for crossing a police barricade. Two blocks from the Whitehouse, in McPherson Square, over two hundred protesters declared victory in shutting down traffic with some engaging the police while others chained their hands together inside school desks while demanding cuts in war spending and more money for education. [...] According to a Congressional Budget Office (CBO) report published in October 2007, the U.S. war in Iraq could cost taxpayers $1.9 trillion by 2017 when counting the huge interest costs because combat is being financed with borrowed money.|$|E
