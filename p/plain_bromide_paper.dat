50|$|Some cabinet card {{images from}} the 1890s have the {{appearance}} of a black-and-white photograph in contrast to the distinctive sepia toning notable in the albumen print process. These photographs have a neutral image tone and were most likely produced on a matte collodion, gelatin or gelatin <b>bromide</b> <b>paper.</b>|$|R
50|$|Paper {{prints were}} the {{positive}} opaque copies of their transparent film negative source. Just like film wound {{on a film}} core, the paper print was also tightly wound in the same way. Most accounts of the paper prints collection never mention the chemical composition of the photographs, but archivists at Ohio State University who received one of the restoration printers used for the conversion project refer to these photographic prints as existing on <b>bromide</b> photographic <b>paper.</b> No specifications could {{be found on the}} composition of <b>bromide</b> <b>paper</b> of the time, but one manufacturer today is Kentmere. Their <b>bromide</b> <b>paper</b> “features a conventional double weight fiber-base, coated with a neutral tone bromide emulsion…Glossy unglazed surface only. The double weight paper is approximately 276 g/m² and a thickness of approximately 260 μm.” Photos of the paper on cores have a density that look very much like the films would, although there are no specifications on film of the time. Motion picture film was not standardized in the early years, and therefore, neither were their paper copies.|$|R

50|$|An imagesetter is an ultra-high {{resolution}} large-format {{computer output}} device. It exposes rolls or sheets of either photographic film or <b>bromide</b> <b>paper</b> to a laser light source. Once the film or paper is developed, {{a very high}} quality black-and-white image is revealed. Development (processing) usually occurs in a unit separate to the imagesetter, as does raster image processing.|$|R
25|$|When {{working with}} wet {{photographic}} plates, Swan noticed that heat increased {{the sensitivity of}} the silver bromide emulsion. By 1871 he had devised a method of using dry plates and substituting nitro-cellulose plastic for glass plates, thus initiating the age of convenience in photography.

50|$|Selenium toning is {{a popular}} archival toning process, {{converting}} metallic silver to silver selenide. In a diluted toning solution, selenium toning gives a red-brown tone, while a strong solution gives a purple-brown tone. The change in color depends upon the chemical make-up of the photographic emulsion being toned. Chloro-bromide papers change dramatically, whilst pure <b>bromide</b> <b>papers</b> change little. Fibre-based papers are more responsive to selenium toning.|$|R
50|$|The main use of {{bromides}} is for proofing documents before expensive lithography {{plates are}} made. Proofing on <b>bromide</b> <b>paper</b> {{is much easier}} than film, since it doesn't require a light table or other backlighting in order to read. Because of the uptake of platesetters, this function of imagesetters in modern printing houses has been reduced, although not completely eliminated, with proofs made on special proofing printers instead.|$|R

50|$|Sawyer's first {{photographs}} were originally printed from glass negatives on a platinum paper ("platinotypes").

Satista was mainly used for watercolors; <b>bromide</b> <b>papers</b> were primarily used to support oils. These papers were dipped in water and then sponge-dried. Sawyer's earliest prints were painted with watercolor. Because of this, prints surviving from this period are usually more muted.|$|R

50|$|In the {{original}} version of the printing process, carbon tissue (a temporary support sheet coated {{with a layer of}} gelatin mixed with a pigment—originally carbon black, from which the name derives) is bathed in a potassium dichromate sensitizing solution, dried, then exposed to strong ultraviolet light through a photographic negative, hardening the gelatin in proportion to the amount of light reaching it. The tissue is then developed by treatment with warm water, which dissolves the unhardened gelatin. The resulting pigment image is physically transferred to a final support surface, either directly or indirectly. In an important early 20th century variation of the process, known as carbro (carbon-bromide) printing, contact with a conventional silver <b>bromide</b> <b>paper</b> print, rather than exposure to light, was used to selectively harden the gelatin. A wide variety of colored pigments can be used instead of carbon black.|$|R
40|$|The {{observation}} of the intensity of solar ultra-violet radiation was carried out on the roof,as {{well as in the}} field of the meteorological observatory of the Kyushu Imperial University, during the pericd August 1 st 1932 to August 31 st 1933, as one of the programs adopted by the committee for the second polar year, observation in Japan. To measure ultr a -violet radiation, two methods were used. (1) Hill 2 ̆ 7 s method :- 5. 8 cc solution of pure methylene-blue is added to 3 o cc of pure acetone and made up to I oo cc with distilled water. With this solution, a small silica tube with the inner diameter 3 mm and length 5 cm is filled to the brim. The tube is exposed to sunlight for 30 minutes and then the decolorization was measured by the colorimeter, comparing with the series of ten differently decolorised solutions. The decolorization is made by exposing the normal solution to the mercury lamp, each differing by 5 minutes. Table I is the outcome of the measurement on each International Day i. e. Thursday. (2) The method of the photoelectric cell :?T o record the d aily variation of the ultra-violet radiation continuously, the sodium photoelectric cell was used. The solar ray was filtered by a nickel glass which passes only the rays 2910 - 4000 A. The solar ray reflected on the silvered uviol glass attached to a heliostat placed {{on the roof of the}} building enters into the cell which is electrically connected with the galvanometer and its mirror makes the point image on the <b>bromide</b> <b>paper</b> on the revolivng drum. Table II is prepared by measuring the area of the record-strip of the <b>bromide</b> <b>paper.</b> As clearly shown in the tables, th e maximum intensity reaches usually at 12 h 30 min. and the month of maximum intensity and that of minimum are respectively August and January. The time and month of the maximum intensity occur usually therefore at those of highest temperature in Japan. 1879 の萬國氣象會議で北南兩極に關係ある諸國が共同して極地の地磁氣及氣象などの親測をやろうと云ふ申合せがあつて 1882 の 8 月 1 日より翌年 9 月 1 日まで極地觀測と云ふものを行ふた。これを佛語で I 2 ̆ 7 Ann?e Polaire といつてゐる。こう云ふことは時々行ふことが願しいことであるので第二回極地觀測を 50 年後の 1932 の 8 月 1 日より 1933 の 8 月 31 日まで行ふことをコーペンハーゲンで開れた萬國氣象會議で決議されたのである, 我國も此れに參加することになり委員會を設けて數ケ所にて共同觀測をすることになつた。九州帝國大學農學部の氣象學教室に於ても此の期間太陽紫外線の強度を實測する委囑を受け餘それを擔當し本學囑託農學士大熊義一觀測主任となり大森福義, 黒瀬良照之れが副となつて實測に從事した。以下の報告はその觀測結果であつて充分な歸納は今後の研鑚を待つて發表することにし此虜には主として數字のみを羅列することにした。萬國觀測日は木曜日であるが當教室にてはその日以外に於ても毎日同樣な觀測を行つたのである。然し紙數の都合上木曜日のもののみに限定したのは遺憾と申さねばならぬ。その觀測日には參加諸國同時に觀測することになつてゐたけれども紫外線の觀測は日中でなければ行れぬから時刻に於て各所と一致することが出來兼ねたのは止むを得ぬ次第である。實測方法は化學的と物理的との二種によつた後者による自記裝置は完全無缺とは申されぬかも知れぬが然し前記三氏の努力によつて所期の目的を達し得たのは餘の喜びとするところである...|$|R

In the course of the 1930 s, younger men and government officials employed in the administration in Sarajevo started to wear European-style suits. The Bosniaks combined them with the fes. The style was somewhat outdated, reminiscent of the late 1920 s. During the winter, men in Sarajevo dressed in long coats and suits with white shirts and a tie. They preferred narrow lapels, and wore their coats buttoned up to the top. Trousers were straight and rather short, leaving the socks visible. Some men wore Oxford Bags and fitted coats with broad lapels. It was common to fold back the sleeves, like the man in the photograph.

50|$|In {{the early}} 1890s Stening started practising photography. A {{few years later}} in 1894, {{he was one of}} the {{founding}} members of the Photographic Society of New South Wales, then later in 1916 he became involved with the Sydney Camera Circle. Also, in 1909, Stening assisted Harold Cazneaux with him arguably making Cazneaux's first exhibition possible. Stening also was involved with the Ashfield District Camera Club which consisted of his friends Norman Deck, Henri Mallard and Frank Hurley. His style of photography was focused on finely detailed landscapes which he gained inspiration from off Norman Deck, with a liking more to the tones of platinum printing papers. Stening occasionally delved into impressionistic soft-focus photographs printed on <b>bromide</b> <b>paper.</b> In an exhibition in 1907 at the Art Gallery of NSW which included Stening's work, one of the comments made by the reviewer was ‘what wonderful strides have been made in the art of the camera, when manipulated by an artist, and how closely the modern photographer is getting to pure pictorial representation’ 1920, he chose to leave all photographic societies. Despite this, Stening took on new technology in the form of a 35mm Leica camera which was released in 1925, continuing his photography practise for a some time after this. The Art Gallery of New South Wales later received a donation of his negatives from Norman Deck.|$|R

40|$|This tromometer {{constructed}} with {{the object of}} observing with it microseisms of 4 sec period at three or more places simultaneously in order to enable investigation {{into the nature of}} microseisms. It consists of a horizontal pendulum, suspended with two flat springs, and an optical recording device. The pendulum bob weighs 1550 g, the length of the pendulum arm being 20 cm. A copper plate, attached {{to the end of the}} pendulum, which swings the poles of an MK magnet, serves as an electromagnetic damper. In order to avoid the resonance of the pendulum to microseisms of 4 sec period, the period of free vibration of the pendulum can be made to exceed ten seconds. The geometrical magnification is about 400 when lens of 50 cm focal length is used in the optical recording system, and about 800 when the focal length is 100 cm. For recording, in place of the recording drum, a sheet of <b>bromide</b> <b>paper,</b> about 56 × 11. 5 cm, is wound directly round two wheels which are fixed on an axis of rotation, the rate of rotation being once in ten minutes, the driving power being an AC 100 V synchronous motor.

40|$|In {{an earlier}} paper in these PROCEEDINGS (Van Overbeek 1936) {{it was shown}} that decapitated Avena coleoptiles to which auxin-a was applied unilaterally, curved less if they were {{continuously}} exposed to light than if they were kept in the dark. This paper presents a closer study of the phenomenon; when the relation of time to the auxin curvatures is considered. This was possible by using a device designed by Went (in press) with which it has become possible to record the curvatures {{of a large number}} of decapitated coleoptiles at any time desired, without exposing them to light. The principal points of this method are the following. The primary leaves of etiolated seedlings were pulled out and removed and a straw from Bermuda grass (Cynodon Dactylon) about 10 cm. long, was stuck about 2 - 3 mm. into the lumen of the coleoptiles. A small part near the tip of these straws was photographed by a small horizontal beam of light on a revolving drum to which <b>bromide</b> <b>paper</b> was attached. In this way a record is obtained showing for each of the plants every 6 minutes the distance the straw has moved from its original position. For small angles this distance is practically proportional to the angle of curvature of the coleoptile. The curvatures of the exposed plants were recorded in a similar way. These plants were placed between two mirrors which reflected the light from a 10 -watt lamp above them on two opposite sides of the coleoptiles. Between the lamp and mirrors was a water layer of about 10 cm. to check the heat radiation from the lamp. The intensity of the light striking the plants was about 500 M. C...|$|R
40|$|Simple, universally {{adaptable}} {{techniques for}} fabricating conductive patterns {{are required to}} translate laboratory-scale innovations into low-cost solutions for the developing world. Silver nanostructures have emerged as attractive candidates for forming such conductive patterns.

Reminiscent of the photographic process of `salt printing', a desktop office printer was used to deposit desired patterns of silver <b>bromide</b> on <b>paper,</b> which were subsequently exposed to light and then immersed in a photographic developer. Percolating silver nanowire networks that conformally coated the paper fibres were formed after 10 min of exposure to light from a commercial halogen lamp.

40|$|Citrus fruits are an {{essential}} component of some of the human nutritional requirements like vitamins, minerals and organic acids. Preservation of these products, however, is one of the central problems encountered by producers worldwide. The postharvest losses of fruit and vegetable stands at 20 - 40 % in the average. The use of synthetic chemicals on harvested fresh produce is becoming more difficult to justify due to the concerns about human health risks associated with the chemical residues particularly in the diets of children, the widespread occurrence of fungicide-resistance isolates, the environmental problems associated with the disposal of water used in packing operations, and a lack of approved fungicides for the control of sour rot. Therefore, the interest in “non-conventional ” methods for postharvest decay control of fruits and vegetables has become increasingly important. Hot water treatments to control postharvest diseases of citrus avoid residue and disposal issues associated with chemical treatment. Heat treatment technologies are currently a relatively simple, non-chemical alternative to methyl bromide that can kill quarantine pests in perishable commodities, as well as control some postharvest diseases. Unlike methyl bromide, heat treatments do not pose significant health risks from chemical residues and, as a result, are more appealing to consumers than methyl <b>bromide</b> fumigation. This <b>paper</b> reviews some of the developments in hot water treatment and its effect on the quality of citrus fruits...|$|R
