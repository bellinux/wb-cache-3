5|$|The {{first set}} of {{relatives}} that had claim to an epikleros were the <b>paternal</b> uncles and any heirs of the uncles. Next in line were any sons of the sisters {{of the father and}} any of their heirs. Third in line were the grandsons of the father's <b>paternal</b> uncles, and following them the grandsons of the <b>paternal</b> aunts of the father. After these <b>paternal</b> relatives were exhausted, then the half-brothers of the father by the same mother were in line, then sons of the maternal half-sisters of the father. Seventh in line were the grandsons of maternal uncles of the father and then grandsons of maternal aunts of the father. It appears that if there were two or more relatives that were related in the same degree, the eldest of the similarly-related relatives had priority in claiming the epikleros.|$|E
