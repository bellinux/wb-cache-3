40|$|Low {{velocity}} impact damages (LVIDs) on {{composite structures}} can cause critical failure modes like matrix cracking, delamination and fibre breakage. These damages {{can be difficult}} to detect if there are no visible surface damage from the impact. Guided wave ultrasonics through active structural health monitoring can sensitively track variations in material stiffness even from low energy transfers due to low velocity impacts. However, the guided wave response may not be clearly interpreted as a significant stiffness change in either the time domain or the frequency space due to dispersion and mode conversion. A wavelet analysis scheme is proposed where the guided waves time signal is decomposed into constituent <b>pseudo</b> <b>frequency</b> scale components to evaluate the zeroth-order moment (ZOM). This is shown to be a promising approach to increase the probability of detection (PoD) of LVIDs located on carbon-fibre reinforced laminate bars interrogated with flexural waves...|$|E
40|$|Fractional {{calculus}} is {{a mathematical}} tool for augmenting conventional integrals and derivatives. When introduced to control theory, it poses new {{opportunities and challenges}} for engineers. In the literature, pioneers have revealed the benefits brought to some general control theory by fractional order (FO) modeling and control techniques. Yet, there has notbeen a systematic study of such techniques for specific industrial processes. Therefore, this dissertation makes the efforts to fulfill the task. This research originates from the equipment control in the semiconductor manufacturing industry, and most problems under discussion are very practical. Newly developed methodologies for solving these problems are exhibited: for example, the relay feedback identification of FO models, auto-decoupling of FO multi-input-multi-output (MIMO) processes, relative gain array of FO MIMO processes, feedback linearization of nonlinear FO systems, and the FO sliding-mode based extreme seeking control for impedance matching, etc. In addition, comprehensive literature surveys on relevant topics are provided; and an extensive review and evaluation of existing numerical tools for fractional calculus and FO controls are conducted. Novel concepts, such as the <b>pseudo</b> <b>frequency</b> response, are promoted; and potential future research opportunities are identified. Through these efforts, fractional order modeling and control are expected to receive wider adoption so that this powerful tool can be used more broadly {{for the development of}} modern industry. Fractional calculus is like a mutated gene fragment which generates varieties of research spices when it is grafted to any research breed. Beside the research in the scope of pure FO modeling and control, a cadenza chapter is provided in the end of this dissertation, in which some interesting thinking, experimental results and hypothesis on miscellaneous research topics are presented. These discussions involve topics related to either fractional calculus or controls, such as Arduino based control demo gadgets for education, EtherCAT timing jitter characterization, Levy distribution based random search, fractal analysis of the financial market, a Hurst exponent based technical indicator, etc...|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We {{propose a}} {{proximity}} probabilistic model (PPM) that advances a bag-of-words probabilistic retrieval model. In our proposed model, a document is transformed to a pseudo document, {{in which a}} term count is propagated to other nearby terms. Then we consider three heuristics, i. e., the distance of two query term occurrences, their order, and term weights, and try four kernel functions in measuring a positiondependent term count, which {{can be viewed as}} a <b>pseudo</b> term <b>frequency.</b> Finally, we integrate term proximity into the probabilistic model BM 25 by using the <b>pseudo</b> term <b>frequency</b> to replace term frequency. Experimental results on TREC data sets indicate that the proximity probabilistic model with the reverse kernel function consistently improves the BM 25 model by 5 %- 11 %, in terms of Mean Average Precision. ...|$|R

30|$|Thanks to the {{significant}} evolution in processor technology {{over the last}} few years, processors with variable voltages and frequencies are now available, they adapt low power and energy techniques to minimize the energy consumption. Reduction in supply voltage requires reduction in operating frequency. That is why, when calculating the overhead of OS services, we execute the application on the hardware platform while adapting a low power technique: The dynamic voltage frequency scaling (DVFS) technique, it has been particularly distinguished by its efficiency to reduce CPU power consumption. It can execute various tasks of an application at different couples of voltage / frequency depending on the workload of the processor. Several strategies have been proposed to exploit certain aspects of DVFS and offer a particular method to build <b>pseudo</b> intermediate <b>frequencies</b> for use in conjunction with the techniques of dynamic voltage scaling (DVS)[19].|$|R
40|$|In this study, {{hydrodesulphurization}} (HDS), hydrodenitrogenation (HDN), hydrodemetallization (HDM), and micro {{carbon residue}} (MCR) removal were investigated using residuum hydrocracking catalysts containing a zeolite component. The first family of catalysts containing H-mordenite was tested at a pressure of 13. 9 MPa and at temperatures of 400 and 450 ∘C in an upward flow packed bed reactor. The results showed increased overall HDM, but decreased overall HDS, HDN, and MCR removal with increasing catalyst H-mordenite content. Analysis based on constant residence time and constant catalyst surface area, i. e., calculation of <b>pseudo</b> turnover <b>frequency</b> (PTOF) and PTOF per unit residence time, showed increased catalyst activity for all reactions with increasing catalyst H-mordenite content. The second family of catalysts containing HY was tested {{at the same}} conditions, but at temperatures of 400 and 370 ∘C. For these catalysts there was similar results compared to the first family of catalysts.

40|$|A brief {{overview}} of {{the workings of the}} human auditory system is followed by a review of literature concerning both the theories and experimental investigations of human pitch perception. The application of these theories to the inharmonic complex tones produced by bells is discussed, and further experiments using bell sounds are reviewed. A methodology for psychoacoustic experiments with specific reference to those investigating pitch perception of inharmonic complex tones is presented. This methodology is then implemented in an experimental investigation of pitch perception of ringing and chiming bell sounds. A pitch matching experiment using ringing and chiming sounds from four bells aimed to determine perceived pitch differences between ringing and chiming bells. This experiment was inconclusive because insufficient data was collected. Known experimental results, such as the inability of non-musicians to match the pitches of sounds with different timbres were confirmed. Spectral analyses of the stimuli were performed. The presentation of stimuli at a low level of sensation is questioned, as this might have prevented <b>pseudo</b> high <b>frequency</b> noise resulting from stronger upper partials in the ringing sound from being audible, and hence the pitch differences between ringing and chiming bells would not be observed. ...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{systematically}} {{studies the}} use of mixed-frequency data sets and suggests that {{the use of}} high frequency data in forecasting economic aggregates can improve forecast accuracy. The best way of using this information is to build a single model, for example, an ARMA model with missing observations, that relates data of all frequencies. The implementation of such an approach, however, poses serious practical problems in all but the simplest cases. As a feasible and consistent alternative, we propose a two-stage procedure to obtain <b>pseudo</b> high <b>frequency</b> data and to subsequently use these artificial values as proxies for macroeconomic or financial models. This alternative method yields a sub-optimal forecast in general but avoids the computational problems of a full-blown single model. Our approach differs from classical interpolation since we only use past and current information to get the pseudo series. A proxy, which is constructed by classical interpolation, may fit very well in sample, but it is not useful for out-of-sample forecasts. As applications of linking series generated at different frequencies, we show {{that the use of}} monthly proxies of GDP improves the predictability of absolute stock returns and the unemployment rate compared to the use of industrial production as an alternative proxy.

40|$|A {{probabilistic}} {{treatment to}} the problem of rocking and overturning of a simply-supported rigid block is presented in the context of Performance-Based Earthquake Engineering (PBEE). To this end, a two-dimensional rectangular block resting at ground surface on a rough, horizontal, tensionless and cohesionless rigid base is considered, subjected to a suite of 44 horizontal earthquake excitations. The roughness of the interface is assumed to be sufficiently large so that sliding is prevented, while the flexibility of the block and aerodynamic effects are neglected. Rocking response curves are calculated for increasing ground motion intensity (or decreasing uplift strength) via Incremental Dynamic Analysis (IDA), and results are summarized in the form of 16 %, 50 % and 84 % fractile IDA curves. The solution based on a geometrically linearized rocking equation is advantageous, as it limits the problem parameters to just three that is, uplift “yield ” strength, <b>pseudo</b> natural <b>frequency</b> and coefficient of restitution (damping), as in the classical yielding oscillator. On the other hand, the slenderness angle of the block is not an essential independent variable, as it simply normalizes the response angle. Generalized overturning criteria are proposed covering a wide set of excitations and block parameters. By employing non-linear regression analysis, simple formulae are developed for both the median/mean and the dispersion of response to provide a complete probabilistic characterization of rocking response for use in PBEE...|$|R
40|$|The Pohang Light Source (PLS) {{storage ring}} was origi-nally {{designed}} {{to store the}} beam current up to 400 mA at 2. 0 GeV. But owing to the interactions between the HOMs of RF cavities and bunched beams which make the coupled bunch mode instabilities (CBMIs) such as dipole, quadrupole, and sextupole modes, the beam current can be stored up to 200 mA. Thus, a longitudinal feedback system (LFS) using parallel digital signal processors has been in-stalled to cure those CBMIs at the PLS storage ring. This programmable LFS is useful for various beam diagnostic-s {{as well as for}} the cure of the CBMIs. At present, via this LFS, we have obtained the various useful bunch-by-bunch diagnostic information such as growth rates of the instabilities, beam <b>pseudo</b> spectra, HOM <b>frequencies</b> of R-F cavities which generate the CBMIs, the threshold beam currents, and the dependence on RF cavities temperatures. ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} work is concerned {{to the use}} of a Doppler ultrasound system aiming to study the effect caused in the blood flow by stenotic lesions. In order to accomplish this study, an experimental blood flow phantom was constructed. This is a controlled platform that allows to generate a range of blood flow profiles, and also to produce different degree of stenosis on a testing vessel. The phantom has also been electrically modeled in order to asses the response under conditions both normal and pathological (with stenosis). The flow average velocity is estimated by calculating the <b>Pseudo</b> Instantaneous Mean <b>Frequency</b> (PIMF) of a discrete Doppler ultrasound signal produced with a blood flow phantom. This signal is conditioned, digitized and processed in order to generate a 2 -D spectrogram to be displayed and for calculating suitable clinical parameters like flow, pulsatile index and resistance index, among others. A graphical user interface (GUI) has been developed for input, output and set control variables and monitoring the system. The results in this study demonstrate a suitable use of Doppler ultrasound spectral analysis of blood flow in order to evaluate the degree of stenosis in vessels...|$|R
