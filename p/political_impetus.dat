5|$|The {{plan was}} {{supported}} by Secretary-General Joseph Louis Anne Avenol, who like Bruce recognised that the League was rapidly becoming moribund and that a major change of direction was needed, although neither was successful in convincing key states in contributing to the plan. Critically, new British Prime Minister Neville Chamberlain could not be convinced by Bruce to invest further into {{the development of the}} League, and the body began to lose its <b>political</b> <b>impetus</b> as war loomed. He would continue to press for League reform in the lead up to the war. The Bruce committee to advise on League reform was formed in 1939 {{in the aftermath of the}} partition of Czechoslovakia by Nazi Germany and the apparent failure of Chamberlain's appeasement policy. This committee, which met in July and August 1939, proposed a significant expansion of Bruce's earlier ideas to the League, bringing a wide range of economic and social programs under its purview as a means of fostering international cooperation. Their work, however, would be rendered moot by the outbreak of World War II.|$|E
5|$|The exit of Finland {{from the}} war on 3 September {{provided}} the <b>political</b> <b>impetus</b> for abandoning Estonia. The next day, Generaloberst Heinz Guderian suggested {{that it would not}} be possible to hold Ostland and ordered plans for the evacuation operation, codenamed Königsberg, to be drawn up. Hitler, however, declared that Ostland must not be given up at any cost, since doing so would provide support to those Finns that did not favour the new course of the government, and would influence Sweden to maintain its current foreign policy. After lunch, Guderian ordered that the Königsberg plan nevertheless be secretly initiated. On the next day, Oberst Natzmer visited the headquarters of Army Detachment Narwa to discuss details of the evacuation. On 11 September, the evacuation of Estonia was discussed in the Army Headquarters at length. On 15 September, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army Group, Generaloberst Ferdinand Schörner, requested that Guderian convince Hitler to order the evacuation of German troops from the continental part of Estonia, codenamed Operation Aster. Schörner emphasised that although the front was still holding, delaying the order would mean the units in Estonia would be trapped. Hitler agreed on 16 September.|$|E

It {{is based on}} the framework of a recent paper where the young and unfamous authors criticized three of the most prominent? architects today in regard to sustainable architecture and its aesthetics. Leading architects expressed their skepticism as to whether {{there is such a thing}} as aesthetics in sustainable architecture, or for that matter, if architecture can indeed be sustainable at all. ?Against such a setting, DGJ will illustrate what we believe to be the landscape perspective’s inherent relationship to the natural environment, the principles behind it as well as the potentials that these landscape perspective holds for sustainable design. After first discussing the kind of professional and <b>political</b> <b>impetuses</b> that have made sustainability one of the most compelling changes to face the profession of architecture, we argue that the mandate for a sustainable environment did not come about by choice of the architects and planners, but rather, that sustainability is imposed on the profession by the necessary, external forces that influence it. To bridge the existing gaps ?between current practice and sustainability, we will trace some thoughts and principles of landscapes? and territories. Our approach views the landscape as a human interface with nature, as a basis for the design of sustainable architecture and a new context for sustainable aesthetics. It will be illustrated with practical work samples from a small but globally operating practice DGJ Architects & Landscapes. They will demonstrate how sustainable design happens in practice, throughout its evolutionary process, with some of our recent projects. UrbanismArchitectur...|$|R

Political actors for decades have been unsure how to organize an effective response.

40|$|The Popular {{party in}} the eighteenth century Church of Scotland has {{received}} little attention from historians and {{there has never been a}} comprehensive analysis of its nature and ideology. This dissertation is an attempt to remedy that defect. It commences by surveying the nineteenth and twentieth century literature which has dealt with the ecclesiastical history of eighteenth century Scotland and identifies the deficiencies in this as they affect the Popular party. It is suggested that an analysis of the theological writings of members is a prerequisite for understanding the nature of the party. Prior to providing this, however, the results of an attempt to identify members of the party are analysed. It is suggested that the most workable method of identification is one based on preparedness to dissent from pro-patronage measures and decisions at the General Assembly. This provides a means of identification of the most committed members of the party. Its geographical spread is then delineated, as are the theological, ecclesiastical and secular interests of its members, and the effects of party dominance on them. The dissertation then analyses Popular theology in the areas of the premises of theology, the nature of sin and salvation, and the practical implications of theology. The picture which emerges is one of considerable theological complexity which calls in question the assumption of doctrinal unity within the party. Popular thought on secular issues is then analysed in the areas of the nature of society, government, poverty and wealth, and culture. The interplay of liberal and conservative <b>political</b> <b>impetuses</b> is examined and the theological bases of the party's secular thought elicited. The patronage dispute is analysed and an interpretation is offered, based on both the published works of the party and proceedings at the General Assembly, which argues that the fundamental religious or spiritual motivation of Popular opposition to the patronage system has not been appreciated, and that therefore the evolution of the Popular response to patronage as revealed at the General Assembly has been misconstrued. The Popular {{party in the}} Church of Scotland between 1740 and 1800 emerges as a doctrinally complex party, including within its membership the full range of doctrinal opinion from Moderatism to traditional orthodoxy. The most influential section within the party, however, was an evangelical grouping which combined doctrinal orthodoxy with an Enlightened learning. It is suggested, finally, that preoccupation with the patronage dispute had led historians to misunderstand the Church of Scotland in the latter half of the eighteenth century and to underestimate the complexity and significance of the evolving theological alignment which was the key development in the perio...|$|R

40|$|The European Union (EU) has {{traditionally}} taken a rather nuanced {{view of the}} activities of Hezbollah. Despite historic links to violent activity, Europe always remained reluctant to place the Lebanese militant group on its list of terrorist organisations. Internal divergences among member states, {{as well as the}} strategic-realist goals of the EU in both Lebanon and the Middle East more generally meant that such a listing never materialised. This remained the case even in the initial turmoil following the Arab uprisings, when Hezbollah’s relatively moderating objectives were viewed as a force for stability. However, the EU shifted policy in July 2013 by listing the military wing of Hezbollah as a terrorist entity. This paper will investigate the reasons behind this decision, as well as the likely implications and effectiveness of the new policy. Two principal catalysts were behind the decision. The first was a Hezbollah-linked bombing in Bulgaria which provided the focal point around which a consensus of the EU member states could emerge in the Council. Secondly, the escalation both of the Syrian conflict and Hezbollah’s role in it provided a more <b>political</b> and strategic <b>impetus</b> for the decision.

40|$|UnrestrictedThis {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} two components. The first {{is a collection of}} poems, collectively titled Simulations, which seek to examine the liminal spaces between the reader and the writer, text and meaning. I explore the anxieties behind the impetus, both {{on the part of the}} reader and the writer, to control the written text by ascribing meaning, form, plot or structure to it. These poems often directly engage with the texts of other writers, ranging from Benjamin Franklin to Darwin to Lewis Carroll, playing with ideas of authorship and authorial intent. By emphasizing the reader s power over the text, this work is especially concerned with exploring reading as a method of rewriting.; The second component is a meditative long essay on the work of poet, novelist, and visual artist Rikki Ducornet. I examine Ducornet's poetry as an extension and reformulation of the original surrealist theories and techniques as conceived and practiced by early male members of the surrealist movement. Ducornet's poems, for example, with their many images of mutilated and maimed female bodies, recall Hans Bellmer's Poupées, often criticized for objectifying women's bodies and eroticizing female pain. Yet Ducornet uses these same surrealist methodologies as tools for socio-political critique, to re-envision female agency and intersubjectivity. In exploring Ducornet's work, I will also trace a genealogy of feminist writers and artists who co-opt and reinvigorate surrealist techniques with a <b>political</b> and artistic <b>impetus,</b> underscoring surrealism's relevance and utility today both as an aesthetic and political practice...|$|R
40|$|Geographical {{studies on}} the {{development}} represent {{a proposal for a}} integration of some of research topics undertaken by both physical and human geography. Their aim is to analyze the social and economic processes through the prism of natural conditions and their position in particular spaces. Such an assumption makes that the main object of the researchers are the relationships and spatial phenomena of development and underdevelopment. The concept of geography of development was introduced to geography by Jürgen Blenck in 1979. In the center of the geographical studies on development Blenck puts society that occupying a defined space of the specific conditions of the natural environment are creating a network of relations that will either lead to the development or inhibit this process. Blenck postulated the concentration of geography of development on the investigation of processes of development and underdevelopment of specific pieces of geographical space and not strictly on developing countries, as it has been done previously. Thus, there has been a change of paradigm of geographical research from purely spatial analyzes of differences of phenomena and processes to the socio-cultural causes of underdevelopment and differentiation of living standards. Geography began to use to explain the spatial aspects of the development the theories and concepts borrowed from the social sciences and economics. It emerged the need for interdisciplinary research on development directed to the micro-regional analysis. At the same time incorporating of geography into the debate about globalization – its conditions and environmental, social, economic, cultural and <b>political</b> effects gave <b>impetus</b> to the discussion on the broader spatial level, on the sclae of large geographic regions and globally.

40|$|Part I {{will begin}} {{the story with}} the Founders 2 ̆ 7 {{understanding}} of the structural role of the First Amendment. In this understanding, the First Amendment served as a bulwark of state independence. Along {{with the rest of}} the Bill of Rights, the First Amendment had as its primary purpose maintenance of the federal system [...] or, more precisely, protection of the states against federal government overreaching. The Founders 2 ̆ 7 plan left the individual states entirely free to regulate speech, while strictly prohibiting the federal government from displacing the states 2 ̆ 7 various speech regimes. When the Civil War dramatically reshaped the federal-state relationship, the structural purpose of the Bill of Rights changed in response. Part II will describe this change. No longer were the Constitution 2 ̆ 7 s protections of individual rights aimed exclusively at the national government. Indeed, over the seventy years following the Civil War, imposing restrictions on state governments became a central constitutional concern. But this concern found expression not through the Free Speech Clause of the First Amendment but through the property-focused guarantees of the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. Free speech was relegated to the periphery. This period, from the Civil War to the New Deal, was the nadir of the First Amendment. Part III will show how the New Deal brought free speech to the center of constitutional jurisprudence. This shift, too, was the product of a broad-gauged reconfiguration. The legitimation of activist government rendered previous constitutional understandings unworkable. No longer could liberty be guaranteed [...] as in the Federalist era [...] by protecting the independent authority of the states, or [...] as in the Civil War era [...] by preserving common law rights to property and contract. Instead, the Supreme Court has interpreted the constitutional guarantee of liberty as protecting the processes of democracy and electoral accountability. In the New Deal era, the Court has extended to political affairs the libertarianism it earlier applied to economic affairs: The First Amendment prohibits the government from rearranging private distributions of <b>political</b> resources. The <b>impetus</b> for this interpretation comes from the highly undemocratic and unaccountable nature of the administrative state. Because the New Deal era government is so powerful, the liberty principle embedded in the First Amendment requires the Court to ensure the state 2 ̆ 7 s subjection to popular control. Having identified the three eras of free speech jurisprudence in Parts I, II, and III, Part IV will elaborate the scholarly method and the premises about constitutional theory that underlie this recounting. This method is holistic, structural, and historical. It understands each constitutional component in relation to other provisions; it focuses on the concrete institutional endowments effected by constitutional lawmakers rather than the general principles those lawmakers arguably endorsed; and it is sensitive to the development of constitutional structure over time. Part IV will conclude by examining the normative implications of the history of the First Amendment. Contemporary free speech doctrine suffers from many of the same defects that eventually forced the abandonment of earlier eras 2 ̆ 7 liberty jurisprudence. Understanding the origins of the modern orthodoxy will suggest directions for future change...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{possibilities}} for syncretic Afrikaans language theatre within a post- 1994 South African society. The research sets out to explore in what manner theatre can be language-specific, {{while at the same}} time being able to cross language contexts. This exploration is driven by the wish to develop strategies for creating Afrikaans theatre that is able to reflect on a society “united in diversity”. In this regard it is argued that for theatre to be able to both retain and cross language barriers, processes of bonding and bridging are necessary. The thesis sets out first to explain why these processes are required and then to suggest ways in which such processes can be implemented in practice. A triangular approach is used, in which conceptual and theoretical frameworks are developed to reflect on actual theatre practices. Three of my own productions are used as case studies, namely Hex (2000; 2003), Lady Anne (2007) and Ekspedisies (2008). These productions can be understood to be “boundary objects” in Henk Borgdorff’s (2012 : 177) sense of the word, in that they fulfil a dual function: they are artistic productions that can also be reconstituted to serve a research purpose beyond the productions themselves. All three works were first created for public consumption before becoming cases for this thesis. Many of the strategies that were developed and tested in creating these productions are examples of ways in which bonding and bridging in Afrikaans language theatre can be understood. Chapter One of the thesis contextualises the political currents and events that necessitated the impulse towards “bonding and bridging”. In this case the <b>political</b> and ethical <b>impetus</b> behind the practical explorations has been related predominantly to the democratisation of South African society, in which a paradigm shift happened from viewing the Afrikaans language as one over many to one amongst many. Within a multilingual South Africa, concerns are raised about ways in which to create theatre in South African languages other than English (often understood to be the only possible bridging language) that are able to cross language divides. Following this introduction to language-related concerns, Chapter Two explains how the shift from apartheid to democracy made space for shifts in identity – on personal as well as institutional levels: a progression from essentialised notions of culture to the celebration of plurality. This progression is then related to theatre, with an explanation of how the post- 1994 theatre landscape demanded a reimagining of the form and function of theatre. In this re-imagination the notion of a “third space” is important; something that is introduced in this chapter as an alternative to polarised identity constructions. The function of the “third space” as an in-between space and a meeting point for diverse people and entities is a strong underlying theme of this thesis and it serves as a reoccurring touchstone to the ideas put forward. Chapter Three discusses the South African arts festival culture and its contribution to the South African theatre landscape. Particular focus is placed on the Klein Karoo National Arts festival (KKNK) as a platform for the development of the Afrikaans language within a post- 1994 context. What is emphasized in particular is the attempt by the KKNK festival to be linguistically and culturally exploratory and inclusive in the face of language protectionism. After the contextual background of the first three chapters, the thesis shifts to an analysis of theories related to “hybridity” and “syncretism”. In Chapter Four the argument is put forward that of the various inclusive performance and theatre models that represent a multicultural society, the most responsive forms are those that are syncretic and hybrid. Principles that can contribute to the unification and merging of diverse and polarized societal groups are described, and suggestions are made for possible ways to bring about bonding and bridging within cultural practices. Having introduced these principles, examples are offered of how these theories might be understood in other disciplines, namely, religious studies, anthropology, history and a range of cultural practices. Following this broad discussion, Chapter Five describes syncretism and hybridity more specifically in theatre by means of relevant examples. Taking the discussion further into the realm of application, Chapter Six offers an overview of “workshop theatre”, “translation” and “collage making” as strategies for putting theories of hybridity and syncretism into practice. This is followed (in Chapters Seven, Eight and Nine) by a discussion of the three productions (Hex, Lady Anne and Ekspedisies) as case studies that demonstrate how these theories can be understood in practice. Practical strategies for bridging language divides are foregrounded, such as code switching as an approach for enabling a “co-habitation” of languages; physical theatre as a means for crossing language divides; and the creation of more than one language version of a production as a tactic to accommodate shifting contexts. Following on from the discoveries made in the foregoing chapters, I conclude that theories and practices related to notions of “third space”, “hybridity” and “syncretism” are ideal for creating theatre forms (in the Afrikaans language in particular) that can truly reflect a South African society which is “united in diversity”. The thesis ends by offering suggestions for ways in which new, future identities, can be developed...|$|R
