40|$|Abstract. <b>Planetary</b> <b>gear</b> {{trains are}} {{commonly}} used in various transmissions due to the following reasons: compact size, light weight, and multi-degrees of freedom. For example, <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> trains can be designed for following functions: gear reducers for power machinery, internal gear hubs for bicycle, gear increasers for wind generator, gear reducers for robot. In general, the reduction of non-coupled <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> train is less than 10. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to introduce the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> train with high reduction ratio. Coupled <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> train can be designed to has high reduction ratio. Hence, this paper focuses on innovative, kinematic, and engineering design of coupled <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> train with high reduction ratio. The coupled <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> train synthesized in this paper is a <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> train with simple planet gears. It can be used as the gear reducer for a robot. Refer to the train value equation, the reduction-ratio equation of coupled <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> train is derived for the design purpose. Then, the coupled <b>planetary</b> coupled <b>gear</b> train with simple planet gears is synthesized based on the above reduction-ratio equation. Finally, the corresponding engineering design drawing is accomplished...|$|R

A nonlinear multi-gap <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> system finite element method model was established, and the engagement stress, the displacement, and the velocity curve with time of nodes of the <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> system were obtained by using explicit dynamic solution method. Under different speeds and different load, the variation of <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> system dynamic transmission error was then studied combined with the theory of gearing. The results showed that it is different from the dynamic transmission error of <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> system and <b>planetary</b> <b>gear.</b> Time-varying mesh stiffness of sun gear and the ring gear are also different along with their speed change. There are some correlation among time-varying mesh stiffness, meshing impact stress, and dynamic transmission errors. Therefore, it is suggested that the meshing stiffness and impact stress effect on the dynamic transmission error should be considered in the study of transmission error of wind turbine <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> system...|$|R
50|$|Manual {{transmissions}} {{are characterized}} by gear ratios that are selectable by locking selected gear pairs to the output shaft inside the transmission. Conversely, most automatic transmissions feature epicyclic (<b>planetary)</b> <b>gearing</b> controlled by brake bands and/or clutch packs to select gear ratio. Automatic transmissions that allow the driver to manually select the current gear are called manumatics. A manual-style transmission operated by computer is often called an automated transmission rather than an automatic, even though no {{distinction between the two}} terms need be made.|$|E
50|$|Epicyclic gearing or <b>planetary</b> <b>gearing</b> is a {{gear system}} {{consisting}} {{of one or}} more outer gears, or planet gears, revolving about a central, or sun gear. Typically, the planet gears are mounted on a movable arm or carrier, which itself may rotate relative to the sun gear. Epicyclic gearing systems also incorporate the use of an outer ring gear or annulus, which meshes with the planet gears. Planetary gears (or epicyclic gears) are typically classified as simple or compound planetary gears. Simple planetary gears have one sun, one ring, one carrier, and one planet set. Compound planetary gears involve {{one or more of the}} following three types of structures: meshed-planet (there are at least two more planets in mesh with each other in each planet train), stepped-planet (there exists a shaft connection between two planets in each planettrain), and multi-stage structures (the system contains two or more planet sets). Compared to simple planetary gears, compound planetary gears have the advantages of larger reduction ratio, higher torque-to-weight ratio, and more ﬂexible conﬁgurations.|$|E
50|$|A new Shift-on-the-move {{four-wheel drive}} system with {{two-speed}} dual range New Process 208 aluminium transfer case was introduced on K-Series pickups for the 1981 model year. It replaced the {{permanent four-wheel drive}} system, on pre-1980 models. The shift-on-the-move four-wheel drive system featured new automatic self locking hubs and synchronized direct high range <b>planetary</b> <b>gearing,</b> such that the truck could be shifted from two-wheel drive, to fully locked four-wheel drive at speeds of up to 25 mph. Once the shift from two-wheel drive to four-wheel drive was made, the vehicle could be driven at any forward or reverse speed. Four drive modes were offered: Two High, Four High, Neutral, and Four Low. Two High gave a 0:100 torque split, with Four High yielding a locked 50:50 torque split through direct synchronized gearing. Four Low applied reduction gearing with a 2.61:1 ratio, compared to the previous New Process 205's 1.96:1. The front and rear propeller shafts were locked at all times in Four High and Four Low. Neutral was provided for disengagement of both propeller shafts. Conventional four-wheel drive was still available with manual locking hubs.|$|E

One of the causes being the improper interpretation of the vibration spectrum. The structure of the lines present in the spectrum of the vibrations measured on a non-faulty <b>planetary</b> <b>gear</b> transmission, with a sensor mounted on the outer part of the ring gear, is strictly related to the geometry of the transmission.
