40|$|The human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) Vif protein plays {{a critical role in}} the production of infectious virions. Previous studies have demonstrated the presence of small amounts of Vif in virus particles. However, Vif packaging was assumed to be nonspecific, and its functional significance has been questioned. We now report that <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> Vif is dependent on the <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> viral genomic RNA in both permissive and restrictive HIV- 1 target cells. Mutations in the nucleocapsid zinc finger domains that abrogate <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> viral genomic RNA abolished <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> Vif. Additionally, an RNA packaging-defective virus exhibited significantly reduced <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> Vif. Finally, deletion of a putative RNA-interacting domain in Vif abolished <b>packaging</b> <b>of</b> Vif into virions. Virion-associated Vif was resistant to detergent extraction and copurified with components of the viral nucleoprotein complex and functional reverse transcription complexes. Thus, Vif is specifically packaged into virions as a component of the viral nucleoprotein complex. Our data suggest that the specific association of Vif with the viral nucleoprotein complex might be functionally significant and could be a critical requirement for infectivity of viruses produced from restrictive host cells...|$|R

5|$|After the storm, the United Nations Disaster Management Team (UNDMT) {{assisted}} the Conseil National de Secours (CNS) in Madagascar with surveying areas affected by Hudah. The UNDMT also appealed for relief materials {{for at least}} 50,000–100,000people. Two light helicopters in Mahajanga and Sambava were dispatched to support two planes in providing assistance to affected populations. Médecins Sans Frontières(MSF) also provided food and medical aid. The United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) served as a channel for donations to relief efforts, and also made available US$50,000from the United Kingdom's Department for International Development(DFID) for immediate relief purposes. Although the Red Cross had appealed for relief materials for Madagascar before Hudah had hit, these materials would arrive in April, assisting residents affected by Hudah and serving as a backbone for a long-term rehabilitation plan. Due to inclement weather, surveys by humanitarian organizations on the island were not conducted until April4, a full two days after Hudah first struck the island. A Malagasy aircraft delived 6tonnes (6.6metric tons) of rice along with <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> other various supplies to affected regions. The CNS planned to deliver 10tonnes (11short tons) of rice to Antalaha. Although initial reports indicated that 24people were killed due to Hudah, later reports raised the death toll in Madagascar to 111.|$|E
5|$|On November7, despite no {{official}} appeal for international aid, {{the governments of}} France and the United States provided $34,783 and $25,000 in funds.

A team from the United Nations Disaster Relief Organization, specializing with relief coordination and flood management, was also sent. The Red Cross appealed for $418,000 to support 15,000families for one month. A cash grant of $17,300 from the United Kingdom was received on November8. Two United States Air Force AC-130s from Subic bay naval base flew to Cebu carrying ready-to-eat meals. International funding reached $2.5million on November12, with grants of $1.05million, $1million, $188,000 from the Netherlands, Japan, and Australia respectively. Additionally, the United States provided 55,000 <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> food rations.

The first update came {{as a set of}} specialized armor for Oblivions ridable horses; released on April 3, 2006. Although gamers generally displayed enthusiasm for the concept of micropayments for downloadable in-game content, many expressed their dissatisfaction at the price they had to pay for the relatively minor horse-armor package on the Internet and elsewhere. Hines assured the press that Bethesda was not going to respond rashly to customer criticism. New releases continued into late 2006, at lower prices with more substantial content, leading to a better reception in the gaming press. Other small DLC packs include a set of houses themed after the game's factions, a new dungeon, and new spells that were absent in the initial release.

The remaining 116 games were retained by Sky who paid £760million-a-year. The total domestic rights have raised £3.018billion, an increase of 70.2% over the 2010–11 to 2012–13 rights. The value of the licensing deal rose by another 70.2% in 2015, when Sky and BT paid a total of £5.136billion to renew their contracts with the Premier League for another three years up to the 2018–19 season.|$|E

5|$|The soup {{has even}} {{played a role}} in the Soviet space program. In March 1961, as part of a {{communications}} equipment test, a pre-recorded recipe for borscht was broadcast from the Korabl-Sputnik 4 spacecraft. The craft, carrying animals and a mannequin, had been launched into low Earth orbit in preparation for manned space flights. Actual borscht eventually made its way into outer space as space food for Soviet and, later, Russian cosmonauts. Originally, a puréed version of borscht was supplied in tubes. All ingredients for the space borscht (which include beef, beetroots, cabbage, potatoes, carrots, onions, parsley root and tomato paste) were cooked separately, then combined one by one in strictly controlled order, sterilized, packed into tubes, sealed airtight and autoclaved. In the 1970s, the tubes were replaced with <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> rehydratable freeze-dried borscht with regular-size bits of cooked vegetables.|$|E
5|$|The first Sky {{television}} rights {{agreement was}} worth £304million over five seasons. The next contract, negotiated {{to start from}} the 1997–98 season, rose to £670million over four seasons. The third contract was a £1.024billion deal with BSkyB for the three seasons from 2001–02 to 2003–04. The league brought in £320million {{from the sale of}} its international rights for the three-year period from 2004–05 to 2006–07. It sold the rights itself on a territory-by-territory basis. Sky's monopoly was broken from August 2006 when Setanta Sports was awarded rights to show two out of the six <b>packages</b> <b>of</b> matches available. This occurred following an insistence by the European Commission that exclusive rights should not be sold to one television company. Sky and Setanta paid a total of £1.7billion, a two-thirds increase which took many commentators by surprise as it had been widely assumed that the value of the rights had levelled off following many years of rapid growth. Setanta also hold rights to a live 3pm match solely for Irish viewers. The BBC has retained the rights to show highlights for the same three seasons (on Match of the Day) for £171.6million, a 63percent increase on the £105million it paid for the previous three-year period. Sky and BT have agreed to jointly pay £84.3million for delayed television rights to 242 games (that is the right to broadcast them in full on television and over the internet) in most cases for a period of 50 hours after 10pm on matchday. Overseas television rights fetched £625million, nearly double the previous contract. The total raised from these deals is more than £2.7billion, giving Premier League clubs an average media income from league games of around £40million-a-year from 2007 to 2010.|$|E
