The Aliso Creek Water Reclamation Facility went into operation in 2014. It removes polluted runoff in Aliso Creek, improves ocean water quality, and creates local recycled water. With a grant from Cal Trans, the city is undertaking a transition plan to implement Complete Streets for all users. A North-South bicycle route with signs and sharrows was completed through town in 2014. Laguna Beach passed a city-wide 'Idaho Stop' for cyclist, a no plastic bag ordinance and a no plastic bottle <b>purchasing</b> <b>policy</b> for its government.|$|E
500|$|As president, Hudema {{opposed the}} {{university}} administration's proposed tuition increase, {{and particularly the}} portion of the increase that would see students in some programs pay more than those in others. [...] Despite his opposition, the basic increase was approved as proposed, and two of the three program-based differentials were also approved. [...] He also opposed the extension of degree granting powers (which were only granted to universities at the time) to colleges, advocated against the inclusion of education in the General Agreement on Trade in Services and Free Trade Agreement of the Americas, and unsuccessfully lobbied the City of Edmonton to stop assessing property taxes on university residences. [...] He expanded the Students' Union's involvement in environmental issues - creating a Students' Union environmental office, spearheading an energy audit of the Students' Union's building, passing an ethical buying and <b>purchasing</b> <b>policy,</b> helping to open a Women's Centre on campus, and founding a car pool registry.

2500|$|Published in 2008, Princeton's Sustainability Plan {{highlights}} three {{priority areas}} for the University's Office of Sustainability: reduction {{of greenhouse gas}} emissions; conservation of resources; and research, education, and civic engagement. Princeton has committed to reducing its carbon dioxide emissions to 1990 levels by 2020, without the purchase of offsets. The University published its first Sustainability Progress Report in November 2009. The University has adopted a green <b>purchasing</b> <b>policy</b> and recycling program that focuses on paper products, construction materials, lightbulbs, furniture, and electronics.

2500|$|The Dutch {{province}} of Groningen was sued in 2007 by coffee supplier Douwe Egberts for explicitly requiring its coffee suppliers to meet fair trade criteria, {{most notably the}} payment of a minimum price and a development premium to producer cooperatives. Douwe Egberts, which sells a number of coffee brands under self-developed ethical criteria, believed the requirements were discriminatory. After several months of discussions and legal challenges, the {{province of}} Groningen prevailed in a well-publicized judgement. Coen de Ruiter, director of the Max Havelaar Foundation, called the victory a landmark event: [...] "it provides governmental institutions the freedom in their <b>purchasing</b> <b>policy</b> to require suppliers to provide coffee that bears the fair trade criteria, so that a substantial and meaningful contribution {{is made in the}} fight against poverty through the daily cup of coffee".|$|E

UNB recycles electronics in addition to traditional materials and operates a move-out materials collection program. The university adheres to a green <b>purchasing</b> <b>policy</b> and has reduced greenhouse gas emissions 26 percent since 1990; they have also decreased water consumption since 2005 through the adoption of new technologies.

30|$|Since the State Council {{issued the}} house <b>purchase</b> {{restriction}} <b>policy</b> (“Guo Shi Tiao”) in 2010, {{local governments have}} also introduced relevant house <b>purchase</b> <b>policies</b> to prevent housing prices from becoming overheated. Generally, most of the housing <b>purchase</b> restriction <b>policies</b> {{limit the number of}} houses a resident can buy. For those people without hukou, the number of houses they are permitted to purchase is always less than that of local residents. The purchasing procedure is also more complicated and several cities do not allow residents without hukou to buy houses at all. This policy has been successful in supporting the government’s stated goal, i.e., “housing is for living in, not for speculation,” but it creates significant difficulties for migrants without hukou in integrating into their new places of residence.|$|R

While literature in operations research has built <b>purchase</b> <b>policy</b> models incorporating uncertain price expectations, these models have been built for commodities.

The model demonstrates how commodity <b>purchase</b> <b>policy</b> models recognizing price uncertainty {{can be adapted to}} the study of multi-brand markets. The model is used to analyze the normative impact of changes in price promotion policies and holding costs on individual purchase behavior.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the formation of}} self-enforcing climate agreements, or stable climate coalitions, when all countries {{have the option to}} fight climate change by purchasing (the right to extract) fossil-energy deposits. First, we consider the stand-alone deposit <b>purchase</b> <b>policy</b> and then combine that policy with the option to tax or subsidize the supply of deposits. In either case, coalitions of any size turn out to buy deposits while the non-cooperative countries do not. In case of the standalone deposit <b>purchase</b> <b>policy</b> either no coalition is stable or the grand coalition is the only stable coalition. If the two-instrument policy is implemented, all countries inside and outside the coalition are better off than in case of the stand-alone deposit policy, but the conditions for stable grand coalitions are more favorable under the stand-alone deposit policy than under the two-instrument policy due to weaker free-rider incentives...|$|R
