5000|$|One of the wittier raids from Balliol, in 1962 or 1963, {{involved}} the turfing {{of the whole}} of Trinity JCR (complete with daffodils). One {{of the most famous}} incidents was practised by three Trinity students (Richard Todd, Richard Cohen and Deidrie Small) on the new intake of freshers to Balliol in October 1985. They sent personally addressed letters to each of Balliol's new freshers on Balliol headed notepaper. It enclosed a narrow neck 100ml screw-top receptacle. The attached letter read, [...] "Dear X, Welcome to Balliol. As you are aware the university requires a short medical check-up as part of your Coming-Up. Could you therefore <b>please</b> <b>provide</b> <b>a</b> urine sample in the attached sample bottle and return it to your college tutor's office by no later than 5.00 PM on Wednesday." [...] The letters were sent out on that Wednesday evening. Balliol admitted to some 57 being returned. The incident was subsequently reported in the Daily Express under the headline, [...] "students play wee joke on neighbours". The incident concluded with Todd and Cohen unfurling a banner over Balliol reading, [...] "We are Balliol. Please Don't Take The Piss!". The last incident suspected to relate to the feud was the vandalism of Trinity's SCR pond in 2010, which led to the death of {{all but one of the}} fish.|$|E

40|$|<b>Please</b> <b>provide</b> <b>an</b> {{explanation}} why DOE {{believes that}} the current approach of using only the Brodsky 1994 porosity (density) – permeability correlation is appropriate, even though {{there appears to be}} additional applicable and relevant data (e. g., Spiers et al 1988) on the salt permeability and density relationship. EPA-Provided Background DOE has elected to use the Brodsky 1994 (SAND 93 - 7058) permeability versus density data set to establish permeability ranges for the T 2 and T 3 times for the ROM salt panel closure. In addition to the Brodsky 1994 data, our review identified that there are laboratory and in situ permeability test results that may be applicable to the panel closure permeability issue. For example, Hansen et al., 1993 (Figure 4, SAND- 93 - 1348 C) and Case et al. 1987 provide additional relevant data. In addition Spiers et al. 1988 reports laboratory results on the constitutive properties of ROM salt which include permeability, porosity/density correlations (pages 82 - 93) with several correlations dependant on the moisture content and porosity type of the consolidated salt. IT (IT Corporation, 1987) conducted laboratory tests on crushed salt producing permeability with respect to density. The data are given in Table 1 and plotted in Figure 1 below.
