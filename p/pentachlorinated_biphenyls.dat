40|$|Polychlorinated {{biphenyl}} (PCB) and ΣDDT (i. e. p,p′-DDT + p,p′-DDE + p,p′DDD) {{concentrations were}} determined {{from the analysis}} of 115 Welsh breast milk samples collected in 1990 and 1991. Fifty PCB congeners were screened, of which 24 were identified in most samples. The PCB congener pattern was consistent between individual milk samples, with IUPAC congeners 28, 138, 153 and 180 being the most abundant and accounting {{for an average of}} 50 % of the ΣPCB concentrations determined. PCB concentrations varied between 2 and 70 ng g− 1 whole milk, were positively correlated with age, and negatively correlated with the total lactation period and with the percent lipid content of the milk. PCB pattern distributions differed between milk and adipose tissue samples. Human milk had a higher proportion of tri- (18 and 28), tetra- (44, 52 and 66) and <b>pentachlorinated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> (101) compared to human adipose tissue. ΣDDT concentrations ranged from 0 · 3 to 71 ng g− 1 of whole milk, with p,p′-DDE contributing towards an average of 92 % of the ΣDDT concentrations. ΣDDT levels were also positively correlated with age and negatively associated with the lactation period, though these correlations were rather weak. No significant differences in the ΣPCB and ΣDDT concentrations were noted between milk samples from donors living in rural and urban locations, or between the subjects' body weight, smoking habits or diet...|$|E
40|$|Information on the {{historical}} global production and consumption of polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) is urgently needed for estimating PCB fluxes {{to the environment and}} for interpreting global contamination patterns by these pollutants. This study presents the methodology, principal uncertainties and selected results from an inventory, aiming to quantify the global production and consumption of total PCBs as well as 22 PCB congeners. The available data on {{the historical}} production of PCBs and the chemical composition of various technical mixtures have been compiled from the literature. For some producers with less detailed information, the production of individual PCB constituents has been estimated to derive a global estimate for individual homologues and selected congeners. Information on imports, exports and consumption, as well as restrictions on production and imports, has further been compiled for individual countries. These data, along with assumptions on the trade between countries and regions, have been utilised to derive an estimate of the global historical consumption pattern. Although there are substantial uncertainties involved in these estimates, important aspects governing the large scale temporal and spatial patterns are most likely captured in these estimates. In particular, the information on imports and exports for the principal users of PCBs around the time of peak production is considered to be fairly reliable. The estimates account for a reported historical global production of 1. 3 million t PCBs, more than 70 % of which are tri-, tetra- and <b>pentachlorinated</b> <b>biphenyls.</b> The results further suggest that almost 97 % of the global historical use of PCBs have occurred in the Northern Hemisphere...|$|E
40|$|Burkholderia sp. strain LB 400 {{is one of}} {{the most}} potent aerobic polychlorobiphenyl (PCB) -degrading {{microorganisms}} that have been characterized. Its PCB-dioxygenating activity originates predominantly or exclusively from the biphenyl dioxygenase encoded by its bph gene cluster. Analysis of the dioxygenation products of several di- to <b>pentachlorinated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> formed by this enzyme revealed a complex dependence of the regiospecificity and the yield of dioxygenation on the substitution patterns of both the oxidized and the nonoxidized rings. No dioxygenolytic attack involving chlorinated meta or para carbons was observed. Therefore, the ability of the enzyme to hydroxylate chlorinated carbons appears to be limited to the ortho position. However, it is not limited to monochlorinated rings, as evidenced by dioxygenation of the 2, 4 -disubstituted ring at carbons 2 and 3. This site of attack is strikingly different from that of the 2, 5 -dichlorinated ring, which has been shown to be dihydroxylated at positions 3 and 4 (J. D. Haddock, J. R. Horton, and D. T. Gibson, J. Bacteriol. 177 : 20 – 26, 1995). These results demonstrate that a second substituent of ortho-chlorinated rings crucially influences the site of dioxygenation at this ring and thereby determines whether or not the initial chlorobiphenyl oxidation product is further metabolized through the bph-encoded pathway. The 2, 4 -dichlorinated ring can alternatively be attacked at carbons 5 and 6. The preferred site crucially depends on the substitution pattern of the other ring. The formation of more than a single dioxygenation product was found predominantly with congeners that contain two chlorinated rings, both of which are similarly prone to dioxygenation or one is substituted only at carbon 3...|$|E
40|$|This study {{analyzes}} acidic herbicides from an aqueous {{sample by}} developing a methylated postderivatization on the fiber following solid-phase microextration (SPME) with diazomethane gas procedure combined with GC/MS. Analysis results indicate that a silica fiber coated with polyacrylate (PA) yields a higher extraction efficiency than that obtained with poly(dimethylsiloxane) (PDMS) using the SPME technique. Detection limits are achieved {{at the level of}} 10 - 30 ng/L, Linearity is obtained over a wide range, with precision below 12 % RSD. In addition, the significant reduction in extraction efficiency is attributed to the concentration of humic acids exceeding 5 mg/L. Various degradation compounds of acidic herbicides in basic solution are also detected, including 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, 2, 4, 5 -trichlorophenol, 4 -chloro- 3 -methylphenol, <b>pentachlorinated</b> <b>biphenyl,</b> and tetrachlorinated biphenyl. Moreover, the amount of <b>pentachlorinated</b> <b>biphenyl</b> and tetrachlorinated biphenyl increases over time...|$|R

This study proposed coupling two different treatment technologies, chemical dehalogenation using potassium polyethylene glycol (KPEG) and bioremediation, to optimize the destruction and detoxification of PCB-contaminated soil. Changes in toxicity over time were monitored through the use of the Salmonella/microsome assay and the E. coli prophage induction assay. In order to examine the efficacy of integrating chemical dehalogenation and bioremediation, a greenhouse (microcosm) study was conducted. Three different treatment conditions were examined in the study: (1) chemical dehalogenation by KPEG; (2) inoculation with PCB-degrading bacteria (Alcaligenes eutrophus H 850); and (3) chemical dehalogenation with inoculation of PCB-degrading bacteria. Samples were taken at day 0, 90, and 180. Changes in the composition of specific PCB congeners (one trichlorobiphenyl, two tetrachlorobiphenyls, two pentachlorobiphenyls, and one heptachlorobiphenyl) were monitored by gas chromatograph-electron capture detection following treatment. The toxicity of residual PCB congeners following treatment was monitored using the Salmonella/microsome and E. coli prophage induction bioassays. Data collected in this study include solvent extractable organics for untreated and treated soils, biological test data for the two microbial genotoxicity assays, and PCB concentrations for the six congeners being monitored. Results indicated that KPEG was not appreciably degraded in the soil as 69 % more residue was extracted from the samples treated with KPEG than from the sterile control soils at day 0 and day 180. There was no decline in total solvent extractable organics in the sterile control soils or the KPEG treated soils over the study period. The soils receiving bacterial treatment alone did show decreases in extractable organics over time, with the exogenous bacterial treatments showing a decrease in extractable organics of 29 % and the indigenous treatment showing a decrease of 43 % over the study period. The genotoxicity of the soil for all treatment conditions was unchanged over the study period. All samples from treated soils were non-genotoxic in both bioassays at all sampling times. The PCB concentrations in the KPEG treated boxes did show a slightly higher level of PCB degradation than their non-KPEG treated counterparts. No decrease in the concentrations of the two <b>pentachlorinated</b> <b>biphenyls</b> was seen in the soils treated with bacteria only. Based on these results, KPEG did not appreciably enhance the degradation of PCBs under the conditions used in this study. Further research on the optimal parameters for KPEG dehalogenation are needed in order to make this a feasible method for the destruction of PCBs in soil...|$|E
