500|$|In The New York Times James Woods {{described}} True at First Light as {{a travel}} journal {{that became a}} [...] "fanciful memoir" [...] and then a novel of sorts. Patrick Hemingway believed adamantly the manuscript {{was more than a}} journal. He emphasized the storyline because, as he explains, [...] "the essential quality of the book is an action with a love interest". He tightened the hunting scenes, and to honor his father's statement to the reader that [...] "where I go, you go" [...] he emphasized the mid-20th century Africa scenes and [...] "the real relation between <b>people...</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> continent". [...] Although he fictionalized the storyline, Patrick Hemingway said of the characters, [...] "I knew every single one... very well indeed". [...] Hemingway scholar Robert Fleming (who reworked the manuscript [...] as Under Kilimanjaro) considers Patrick Hemingway's editing essentially to be correct because he believes the work shows evidence of an author unable to [...] "turn off the mechanism that produces fiction". The marital conflict is where Fleming believes [...] the book took [...] "a metafictional turn". The published book is marketed as fiction.|$|E
500|$|In July 1977, on {{the final}} date at the Montreal Olympic Stadium, {{a small group of}} noisy and excited fans near the stage irritated Waters {{to such an extent that}} he spat at one of them. [...] He was not the only band member to feel disaffected at the show: guitarist David Gilmour refused to perform the band's usual encores ("Money" [...] and [...] "Us and Them"), leaving the band, with backup guitarist Snowy White, to improvise a slow, sad twelve-bar blues, which Waters {{described}} as [...] "some music to go home to". [...] Later that night, returning from hospital after an injury sustained to his foot while play-fighting backstage with manager Steve O'Rourke, Waters spoke with music producer Bob Ezrin, and a friend of Ezrin's, a psychiatrist sharing their car, about the feelings of alienation he was experiencing on the tour. He articulated his desire to isolate himself by constructing a wall across the stage between the performers and the audience. He later said, [...] "I loathed playing in stadiums ... I kept saying to <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> tour, 'I'm not really enjoying this ... there is something very wrong with this.'" [...] While Gilmour and Wright were in France recording solo albums, and Nick Mason was busy producing Steve Hillage's Green, Waters began to write new material. The spitting incident became the starting point for a new concept, which explored the protagonist's self-imposed isolation after years of traumatic interactions with authority figures and the loss of his father as a young child. To execute The Wall concept was to attempt to analyse the performer's psychological separation from the audience, using a physical structure as a metaphorical and theatrical device.|$|E

It was the first song that she and Naughty Boy had worked together on and she {{pointed out that the}} song {{has nothing to do with}} her father. It has the sound of an early 1990s dance hit, and the song has been compared to the music by Seal and Adamski. The track is about her struggle while trying to get into the music industry and how people can get fanatical about money, drugs, fame or religion. [...] "Daddy" [...] also represents how that one thing you can keep returning to, like how drug addiction in the music industry and how easy it is to turn to. However, at the same time as she wrote the song she was thinking about The Jeremy Kyle Show, and the fact that people laugh at the <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> show, and that they are desperate enough to go on the show and talk about their problems. She also said that the song was written very quickly in two or three hours.|$|E
2500|$|Bronski called The Mismeasure of Desire [...] "a smart {{book that}} raises {{skepticism}} {{to a fine}} art", [...] "groundbreaking", and [...] "meticulously researched and argued". He credited Stein with discrediting gay politics based on genetic theories of sexual orientation and showing the harmful consequences of arguing that sexual orientation is innate. However, according to Bronski, LeVay expressed disagreement with many of Stein's conclusions. Stoltenberg wrote that, despite Stein's [...] "careful method and measured tone", his book was [...] "radically discombobulating". He considered Stein's work a [...] "landmark book". He credited Stein with writing [...] "simply and straightforwardly" [...] despite his philosophical approach, and with refuting [...] "biological arguments for lesbian and gay rights" [...] and discrediting the [...] "conventional wisdom" [...] {{about the nature of}} sexual orientation, including the question of whether it makes sense to classify <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> basis. He was convinced by Stein's argument that, even if a sound scientific case for a biological basis to sexual orientation were made, this would not advance gay rights. Hemmes found the book informative, but also poorly written. He accused Stein of writing in [...] "too much detail" [...] and of presenting [...] "tortuous examples".|$|E
2500|$|The German {{historian}} Eberhard Jäckel wrote {{a series}} of newspaper articles later turned into the book David Irving's Hitler: A Faulty History Dissected, attacking Irving and maintaining that Hitler was {{very much aware of}} and approved of the Holocaust. Jäckel attacked Irving for claiming that a note from Heinrich Himmler's notebook – [...] "Jewish transport from Berlin, not to be liquidated", dated 30 November 1941 – proved that Hitler {{did not want to see}} the Holocaust happen. Jäckel maintained that the order referred only to that train, and argued that if Hitler had ordered the <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>that</b> train to be spared, it must stand to reason that he was aware of the Holocaust. Jäckel went on to argue that because the [...] "Final Solution" [...] was secret, it is not surprising that Hitler's servants were ignorant of the Holocaust, and that anyhow, five of Hitler's servants interviewed by Irving later claimed that they believed that Hitler was aware of the Holocaust. Jäckel argued on the basis of Hitler's statements in Mein Kampf that the Führer was always committed to genocide of the Jews, and that because Hitler later attempted to execute the foreign policy he outlined in Mein Kampf, it is a reasonable assumption that Hitler was always committed to genocide, which in Jäckel's opinion disproves Irving's claim that Hitler was unaware of the Shoah. Jäckel used Hitler's tendency to involve himself in minutiae to argue that it is simply inconceivable that Hitler was unaware of the Holocaust. As evidence against Irving, Jäckel used Hitler's [...] "Prophecy Speech" [...] of 30 January 1939, where Hitler declared: ...|$|E
