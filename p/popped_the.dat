25|$|In {{the fall}} of 1994, Lawler {{initiated}} a feud with Doink the Clown. Lawler <b>popped</b> <b>the</b> balloons carried by Doink's midget sidekick, Dink. After Doink and Dink retaliated, Lawler introduced a midget sidekick of his own, who he named Queasy. In the following weeks, Doink added two more sidekicks, Wink and Pink, while Lawler introduced Sleazy and Cheesy. This led to an elimination match at Survivor Series 1994, which Lawler's team won. After the match, however, Lawler's team turned on him, joining with Doink's team to attack Lawler.|$|E
25|$|The rest of {{the half}} was a tight affair, with England edging in front from {{applying}} pressure and Jonny Wilkinson's boot put them up to a 9–5 lead after Australian indiscipline gave away several penalties, but were unable to capitalise on their territory. Towards {{the end of the}} first half, England stretched their lead further. Lawrence Dallaglio made a break and <b>popped</b> <b>the</b> ball inside to Jonny Wilkinson, who drew the defence before putting Robinson away in the corner for a try. The conversion was missed, but England went in at half time leading by 14–5.|$|E
25|$|In {{what was}} the most financially {{successful}} UFC event up to that point, Liddell fought a rematch with Tito Ortiz at UFC 66, which took place on December 30, 2006. Liddell's takedown defense neutralized Ortiz's wrestling ability forcing Ortiz to stand up with a known striker. Although Ortiz did take Liddell down {{at one point in the}} fight, Liddell went on to defeat Ortiz via TKO in the third round to successfully defend his light heavyweight championship for a fourth time. It was later revealed that Liddell tore his MCL prior to the fight. In addition, during the fight he <b>popped</b> <b>the</b> tendon out on the middle finger on his left hand.|$|E

25|$|At {{his first}} {{competition}} of the season, Skate Canada Autumn Classic International, he received 112.72 points for his short program. Hanyu cleanly executed the quadruple Salchow, the triple Axel and the quadruple toe loop-triple toe loop combination, breaking {{the world record}} he had set previously at the 2015-16 Grand Prix Final (110.95). In this competition, due to a pain in his right knee, the quadruple loop jump {{was replaced by the}} quadruple Salchow. During the free skating, Hanyu <b>popped</b> <b>the</b> opening jump into a single Lutz and fell on a triple Axel, which was uncharacteristic for him. He also had troubles with other jumps and his quadruple toe loop was downgraded for a two-footed landing. He got a score of 155.52 points, and was surpassed by Fernández.|$|E

2500|$|According to this narrative, {{in recent}} decades [...] "economic fundamentals" [...] were in a poor state; nothing much was done about that, except that workers were beaten down; instead, the economy was artificially pumped up with cheap credit and cheap imports, {{prompting}} a housing and spending boom; when the credit bubble <b>popped,</b> <b>the</b> economy sagged right back into its poor state. Such arguments may have some plausibility, {{but if they are}} examined in fine detail, it is clear that a whole series of different arguments are actually being made about the way that falling profitability is connected to economic slumps. In reality, therefore, it is still far from resolved what the role of profitability in crises actually is.|$|E
