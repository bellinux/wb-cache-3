AIMS: To review the frequency, nature and impact of expert <b>psychiatric</b> and psychological <b>evidence</b> in the Supreme Court in Iceland over a 7 -year period where all appeals in Iceland are heard. METHOD: All cases listed on the Supreme Court's Website between 2001 and 2007 were identified. The judgements were carefully screened for relevant information. Details {{of the nature of}} the criminal offences for the sample were obtained from official records. RESULTS: 3367 cases were identified. <b>Psychiatric</b> and psychological <b>evidence</b> was considered in 213 (6. 3 %) cases (2. 7 % and 4. 2 % for the two disciplines, respectively), with only 10 % cases involving reports from both disciplines. Psychiatrists focused primarily on assessing violent offenders, diminished responsibility issues, restraining orders, and mental state examinations and diagnosis, whereas psychologists were more commonly involved in custody disputes and credibility assessments of victims of sexual offending. No oral expert evidence was heard in the Supreme Court. <b>Psychiatric</b> and psychological <b>evidence</b> was typically that previously presented in the District Courts. CONCLUSIONS: This is the first comprehensive study to investigate the contribution of forensic psychiatry and psychology in appeal cases. Psychiatrists and psychologists have complementary skills for the assessment of court referrals. Their evidence and recommendations in appeal cases in Iceland are accepted by the Supreme Court in the great majority (78 %) of cases...|$|R

500|$|In response, Duchesne gave what Nosanchuk writes was a [...] "well-reasoned argument", {{which the}} jury paid rapt {{attention}} to. Duchesne {{declared that the}} incident had been the cold, calculated murder of a defenceless group of innocent young people by an ex-convict, released only three weeks earlier and already known as an anti-social psychopath. The defendant had given wildly conflicting stories to different doctors, Duchesne said, yet had convinced each one. Duchesne {{said that this was}} possible as Lamb was highly intelligent and able to project a false front if it suited him. The prosecutor then moved off the topic of Lamb's mental state and focussed on the matter of criminal responsibility in general. Five out of the eight psychiatrists in the court, the prosecutor said, had testified that Lamb had understood on an intellectual level that shooting Chaykoski and Woloch would kill them, which he asserted should be enough to incur criminal responsibility, even taking the <b>psychiatric</b> <b>evidence</b> into account. Finding Lamb {{not guilty by reason of}} insanity, he reasoned, would provide an inexpedient precedent in Canadian law and cause a spate of similar insanity defence attempts.|$|E
500|$|The defence {{began to}} present its <b>psychiatric</b> <b>evidence</b> {{on the third}} day of the trial, 18 January 1967, when Yaworsky was called to testify on Lamb's behalf. Yaworsky recounted in detail his {{examination}} of the defendant two days after the shootings; he put weight on the fact that Lamb had laughed while incoherently describing the events of 25 June, and had at one point giggled and exclaimed [...] "poor [...] ", referring to Edith Chaykoski. So far Lamb had sat through the trial in muted silence, showing no emotion whatsoever, but when Yaworsky mentioned the boy's having [...] "giggled" [...] at this point of the 27 June interview, Lamb did so again in a similar manner. Yaworsky said that he had interviewed Lamb four more times between December 1966 and the trial, and that in these discussions the young man had been able to remember more about the incident; Lamb told Yaworsky that he remembered confronting the people in the street, but that everything had then [...] "felt fuzzy" [...] when he fired the gun. Yaworsky quoted Lamb: [...] "It was as if I was invisible. ... The next clear memory I have is standing minutes later in the Heaton living room. All of a sudden, I was standing there with a gun in my hand—that is when I ran out." [...] The doctor hypothesised that this had been when Lamb returned to the real world following a psychopathic episode during which he had been divorced from reality. Dolan then testified along similar lines, describing his interview with Lamb two days after Yaworsky's and telling the court that he also believed that Lamb had been suffering a psychotic break that had made him unable to appreciate [...] "the nature and quality of the act of killing another human being".|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Several somatic {{illnesses}} {{are associated}} with <b>psychiatric</b> comorbidity. <b>Evidence</b> is provided that availability of the essential amino acid tryptophan, which is the precursor of serotonin, may cause this phenomenon. METHODS: We performed a database search to find relevant articles published between 1966 and 2002. For our search strategy, we combined several diseases from the categories hormonal, gastrointestinal, and inflammatory with the search terms "tryptophan" and "serotonin. " RESULTS: The catabolism of tryptophan is stimulated {{under the influence of}} stress, hormones and inflammation by the induction of the enzymes tryptophan pyrrolase (in the liver) and IDO (ubiquitous). Because of the reduction in blood levels of tryptophan under these circumstances the formation of cerebral serotonin is decreased. CONCLUSIONS: It is argued that the coupling of peripheral tryptophan levels and cerebral serotonin levels has physiological significance. The clinical implications and therapeutic consequences of changes in tryptophan and consequently serotonin metabolism are discussed...|$|R

40|$|Objective: This study {{utilized}} the Traumatic Brain Injury Model Systems (TBIMS) National Database {{to examine the}} prevalence of depression and suicidal behaviour in a large cohort of patients who sustained moderate-to-severe TBI. Method: Participants presented to a TBIMS acute care hospital within 72 hours of injury and received acute care and comprehensive rehabilitation in a TBIMS designated brain injury inpatient rehabilitation programme. Depression and suicidal ideation were measured with the Patient Health Questionnaire (PHQ- 9). Self-reported suicide attempts {{during the past year}} were recorded at each follow-up examination, at 1, 2, 3, 10, 15 and 20 years post-injury. Results: Throughout the 20 years of follow-up, rates of depression ranged from 24. 8 – 28. 1 %, suicidal ideation ranged from 7. 0 – 10. 1 % and suicide attempts (past year) ranged from 0. 8 – 1. 7 %. Participants who endorsed depression and/or suicidal behaviour at year 1 demonstrated consistently elevated rates of depression and suicidal behaviour 5 years after TBI. Conclusion: Compared to the general population, individuals with TBI are at greater risk for depression and suicidal behaviour many years after TBI. The significant <b>psychiatric</b> symptoms <b>evidenced</b> by individuals with TBI highlight the need for routine screening and mental health treatment in this population...|$|R
40|$|Anorexia nervosa (AN) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common chronic {{illnesses}} in female adolescents and exhibits the highest mortality risk of all <b>psychiatric</b> disorders. <b>Evidence</b> for the effectiveness of psychotherapeutic or psychopharmacological interventions is weak. Mounting data indicate that the gut microbiome interacts with the central nervous system and the immune system by neuroendocrine, neurotransmitter, neurotrophic and neuroinflammatory afferent and efferent pathways. There is growing evidence that the gut microbiota influences weight regulation and psychopathology, such as anxiety and depression. This article reviews how the gut [...] brain interaction may impact the development and course of AN. A ``leaky gut'', characterized by antigens traversing the intestinal wall, was demonstrated in an animal model of AN, and could underlie the low-grade inflammation and increased risk of autoimmune diseases found in AN. Moreover, starvation has a substantial impact on the gut microbiome, and diets used for re-nutrition based on animal products may support the growth of bacteria capable of triggering inflammation. As there is currently no empirically derived agreement on therapeutic re-nourishment in AN, this review discusses how consideration of gut [...] brain interactions may be important for treatment regarding the determination of target weight, rapidity of weight gain, refeeding methods and composition of the diet which might all be of importance to improve long-term outcome of one of the most chronic psychiatric disorders of adolescence...|$|R
