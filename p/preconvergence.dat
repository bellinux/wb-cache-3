40|$|In {{this article}} the major result characterizes <b>preconvergence</b> {{compactness}} {{in terms of}} the <b>preconvergence</b> closedness of second projections. Applying this result to a topological space (X,T) yields similar characterizations for H-closed, nearly compact, completely Hausdorff-closed, extremely disconnected Hausdorff-closed, Urysohn-closed, S-closed and R-closed spaces, among others. Moreover, it is established that the s-convergence of Thompson (i. e. rc-convergence) is equivalent to topological convergence where the topology has as a subbase the set of all regular-closed elements of T...|$|E
40|$|A reduce {{algorithm}} {{based on}} the neighborhood granulation and niche Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is proposed for {{the reduction of the}} real decision system with numerical attributes. In this scheme, a rough model is used {{based on the}} neighborhood equivalence. The indiscernibility relation is measured by the neighborhood relation, and the universe spaces are approximated by the neighborhood information granules. The use of the niche technology can avoid the <b>preconvergence</b> of the PSO. The select of fitness function and the adaptive across probability are designed, and the reduction algorithm is presented as well. Furthermore, the dependency function is used to evaluate the significance of the numerical attributes. Experimental results demonstrate the validity and feasibility of the proposed algorithm, in application to a classical data set and four University of California at Irvine (UCI) machine learning databases...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relative importance}} of country and industry factors as determinants of international equity returns in the Euro-zone over the period 1990 to 2003. We conduct our analysis from a portfolio performance perspective, using mean-variance spanning and efficiency tests as well as style analysis, and show how to adjust the tests for time varying market wide volatility. Although unconditional analysis over the full sample suggests that country-based or industry-based EMU-wide portfolios provide similar risk-return trade-offs, a rolling window analysis indicates a striking change in the structure of equity returns in the Euro-zone over the last decade. From 1992 to 1998 country-based strategies outperform industry-based strategies: country based strategies offer higher Sharpe ratios and higher diversification potential as indicated by both spanning tests and style analysis. In the <b>preconvergence</b> period, equity returns in the EMU-zone clearly had a country structure. In contrast, after the introduction of the Euro the country outperformance has disappeared, both in terms of mean-variance efficiency and in terms of mimicking abilities. Industry factors and country factors are now equally important. Our findings suggest that following the adoption of the single currency, Euro-zone sector-based strategies, while not dominating country-based strategies, offer similar risk return trade-offs and diversification benefits. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} {{to address issues}} raised by the convergence of the telecommunications, broadcasting and IT sectors. The approach taken is to provide an analysis of the path to convergence, with the assertion that the United States NII initiative was in many respects the catalyst for the whole process. The American vision of the information age is contrasted with the European Union's version, which highlights not only the strategic importance both place on the new communications world but also the differing emphasis placed on social needs in the new world. To provide {{a better understanding of the}} whole subject area a basic analysis of the sectors <b>preconvergence</b> is provided, with particular emphasis on the pre-convergence regulatory structures in the UK, European Union and United States. Consideration is given to the whole philosophical issue of how the converged industry should best be regulated, whether by strong regulatory controls or by competition law. This will highlight many of the tensions in this field of activity. The main thrust of the paper is that proper analysis and discussion have not so far been made in what is an area of fundamental importance for the whole of the world's population. Vital issues affected by convergence which are addressed, include social exclusion, cultural imperialism, universal service and public service broadcasting, citizenship and democracy. Without proper debate it is premised that gigantic transnational corporations will eventually control the converged industry, with national governments impotent to prevent abuse of the power such corporations will wield. The implications of this are profound, with democracy itself potentially hanging in the balance...|$|E
