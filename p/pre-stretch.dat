The results indicated that more heterogeneous nucleation sites can be provided by the high density of dislocations caused by the plastic <b>pre-stretching</b> deformation, as well as speeding up {{the growth rate of}} precipitates. Comparison of microstructure in non-pre-stretched specimens after artificial aging showed that <b>pre-stretched</b> specimens exhibited a higher number density of precipitates.

40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the formability of sheet materials forming limit diagrams (FLD) are recorded which represent the values of major and minor strain when necking occurs. FLDs are recorded {{based on the assumption}} that exclusively linear strain paths occur. In real forming parts, however, particularly in those with complex shapes, predominantly non-linear strain paths occur which reduce the accuracy of the failure prediction according to a conventional FLD. For this reason forming limits after loading with non-linear strain paths have to be investigated. In this contribution a systematic analysis of the forming limits of a conventional AA 6014 alloy after loading with non-linear strain paths is presented. This material is <b>pre-stretched</b> in uniaxial, plane strain and biaxial direction up to several levels before performing Nakajima experiments in order to determine FLDs. During the <b>pre-stretching</b> process as well as during the Nakajima experiment the strain distribution can be measured online very precisely with the optical deformation measurement systems GOM Aramis or VIALUX. The gained curves are compared to the FLD of the as-received material. The results prove a significant influence of the <b>pre-stretching</b> condition on the forming limits of the used aluminum alloy. For a low <b>pre-stretching</b> in uniaxial as well as in biaxial direction the FLDs show a slightly reduced formability while after higher <b>pre-stretching</b> levels the forming limit can be improved such as for biaxial loading after uniaxial <b>pre-stretching.</b> The formability after <b>pre-stretching</b> in plane strain direction was changed.

40|$|Abstract Dielectric {{elastomer}} (DE) <b>pre-stretching</b> {{is a key}} {{aspect of}} attaining better actuation performance, as it helps prevent electromechanical instability (EMI) and usually lowers the Young's modulus, thus leading to easier deformation.

The excellent performance of PA hydrogels is ascribed to dynamic ionic bond formation through inter-and intra-chain interactions. The randomness results in ionic bonds of wide strength distribution, the strong bonds, which serve as permanent crosslinking, imparting the elasticity, while the weak bonds reversibly break and re-form, dissipating energy. In this work, we developed a simple physical method, called a <b>pre-stretching</b> method, to promote the performance of PA hydrogels.

Purpose: This {{study was designed to}} evaluate the effect of <b>pre-stretching</b> on force degradation of the synthetic elastomeric chains. Materials and Method: This experimental study had two categories of synthetic elastomeric chains: 1. Control (unprestretched) 2. Test (prestretched). The test groups were <b>pre-stretched</b> to 33 %, 100 % and 200 % of the original length. We evaluated 4 control and 16 test groups from four manufacturers. In a period of 5 seconds, each specimen was <b>pre-stretched</b> in the rate of 30 mm per minute. Then, all the specimens were stretched to 25 mm and fixed in this distance on the frames and were merged in 37 degree water. Their forces were measured at 0 hour, 1 hour, 24 hours, 1 week, and 3 weeks. Data were analyzed using Friedman, ANOVA and Green house-Geisser test. Results: All the 20 groups had force degradation in the study period (p < 001). The highest rate of force degradation (about half of the total force degradation) occurred at the first hour. But the rate of force degradation declined over time. In all brands, force degradation was smaller in <b>pre-stretching</b> 200 % than the control group (p < 0. 01 - 0. 001).

This thesis will introduce the fundamentals of DEs, derive the field and finite element equations for simulating its deformation, and then focus on numerically studying electromechanical instabilities, in particular electrostatically driven creep and the effect of <b>pre-stretch</b> on surface (creasing) instabilities. First, a nonlinear, dynamic finite element model coupled with a finite deformation viscoelastic constitutive law is utilized to study the inhomogeneous deformation and instabilities resulting from the application of a constant voltage to dielectric elastomers. Theoretical studies are performed of two problems that have been experimentally observed, i. e. electromechanical snap-through instability and bursting drops in a dielectric elastomer. In general, increasing the viscoelastic relaxation time leads to an increase in time needed to nucleate the electromechanical instability. However, it is found that the time needed to nucleate the instability of these two cases scales with the relaxation time. Second, the effect of <b>pre-stretch</b> on the performance of dielectric elastomers is studied. Two cases are studied, the electromechanical snap-through instability under equibiaxial pre-stress, and a strip under uniaxial <b>pre-stretch.</b> It is found that prestress markedly increases the stability of the elastomers, while <b>pre-stretch</b> increases the critical field for electro-creasing instability. 2031 - 01 - 0...|$|E

One possible {{strategy to}} biofabricate tissue constructs of desirable thickness and material properties {{without the need}} for cell invasion is to use thin (< 2 µm) porous electrospun meshes and self-assembling (capable of tissue fusion) tissue spheroids as building blocks. <b>Pre-stretched</b> electrospun meshes remained taut in cell culture and were able to support tissue spheroids with minimal deformation. We hypothesize that elastic electrospun scaffolds could be used as temporal support templates for rapid self-assembly of cell spheroids into higher order tissue structures, such as engineered vascular tissue. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate how the attachment of tissue spheroids to <b>pre-stretched</b> polyurethane scaffolds may interfere with the tissue fusion process. Tissue spheroids attached, spread, and fused after being placed on <b>pre-stretched</b> polyurethane electrospun matrices and formed tissue constructs. Efforts to eliminate hole defects with fibrogenic tissue growth factor-β resulted in the increased synthesis of collagen and periostin and a dramatic reduction in hole size and number. In control experiments, tissue spheroids fuse on a non-adhesive hydrogel and form continuous tissue constructs without holes. Our data demonstrate that tissue spheroids attached to thin stretched elastic electrospun scaffolds have an interrupted tissue fusion process. The resulting tissue-engineered construct phenotype is a direct outcome of the delicate balance of the competing physical forces operating during the tissue fusion process at the interface of the <b>pre-stretched</b> elastic scaffold and the attached tissue spheroids.

Stiffnesses were related to <b>pre-stretch</b> torque (K/PST) by a linear fit. The KIPST relationship of the elderly subjects exhibited a steeper slope, indicating a greater increase in stiffness with an increase in <b>pre-stretch</b> torque.

40|$|Dielectric {{elastomers}} (DE) {{are used}} in various applications, such as artificial eye lids, pressure sensors and human motion energy generators. For many applications, {{one of the major}} factors that limits the DE performance is premature electrical breakdown. There are many approaches that have been reported to increase the breakdown strength of DEs such as compositing and <b>pre-stretching.</b> Some of the techniques, however, affect other parameters related to DEs negatively. For instance, the elastomers with hard filler particles (e. g. metal oxides) used as DEs experience difficulties to maintain their long-term mechanical reliability as they are susceptible to Mullins effects as the results of <b>pre-stretching.</b> Therefore, two strategies are developed in this thesis in order to produce DEs with high electrical performance and long-term electromechanical reliability. The first strategy is to study the mechanisms behind the electrical- breakdown of 'DEs and the second strategy is to investigate the long-term electromechanical reliability of DEs. In the first strategy, the electrothermal breakdown in polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) elastomers was modelled in order to evaluate the thermal mechanisms behind the electrical failures. From the modelling based on the fitting of experimental data, it showed that the electrothermal breakdown of the PDMS elastomers was strongly influenced by the increase in both relative permittivity and conductivity. In addition to that, a methodology in determining the parameters that affect the breakdown strength of the <b>pre-stretched</b> DEs was developed. Breakdown strength was determined for samples with and without volume conservation and was found to depend strongly on the strain and, the thickness of the samples. In order for DEs to be fully implementable in commercial products, the lifetime of elastomer materials needs further investigation. Therefore, in the second strategy, several DE parameters such as Young's moduli, breakdown strengths and dielectric permittivities of PDMS elastomers filled with hard filler particles were investigated after being subjected to <b>pre-stretching</b> for various timespans. The study showed that electromechanical reliability when <b>pre-stretching</b> was difficult to achieve with PDMS elastomers filled with hard filler particles. Subsequently, the long-term mechanical and electrical reliability was further investigated to the PDMS elastomers filled with the soft fillers (e. g. oils). Interestingly, the results also showed that soft fillers significantly influence the long-term electromechanical reliability of PDMS elastomers. However, despite the <b>pre-stretched</b> PDMS elastomers filled with hard and soft filler experience difficulties to maintain their long-term electromechanical reliability, the study paves the way for electromechanically reliable DEs by indicating that simply post-curing PDMS elastomers before use.

The cats walked on a row of elevated pegs, some of which were spring-loaded and could be triggered to pop up at the moment of foot touchdown, rapidly dorsiflexing the foot. <b>Pre-stretch</b> EMG activity in MG as well as short-, medium- and long-latency responses to the dorsiflexions were compared before and after unilateral denervation of synergists.

When swollen in different pH buffer solutions, the membrane undergoes buckling of pores to slits at pH 3 (achiral, swelling ratio ∼ 2. 0) to onset of symmetry breaking of slits at pH 4. 7 (swelling ratio ∼ 2. 3), {{to the formation of}} twisted, “S” shaped slits at pH 6. 4 (chiral, swelling ratio ∼ 5. 8). While swelling of the square array hydrogel membranes leads to ∼ 50 / 50 mixture of right- and left-handed chiral structures, predominant single handedness with enantiomeric excess fraction > 95 % (i. e.  the absolute difference between the mole fraction of each enantiomer) is obtained from the oblique array of porous membranes. Single left-handedness is obtained from the ones with low <b>pre-stretching</b> angles (15 ° and 30 °), while nearly exclusive right-handedness is obtained from the ones with larger <b>pre-stretching</b> angles (60 ° and 75 °) ...|$|R
40|$|Stretching {{has been}} a part of warm-up for a very long time. Some recent {{research}} has shown that stretching could possibly hinder performance and others have shown it enhances performance. The purpose of this study was to examine whether stretching has an effect on vertical jump, and if so, how long the effects last. Twenty Western Kentucky students (10 M and 10 F) performed three trials each. There was a non-stretching group, a <b>pre-stretching</b> group and a between-stretching group; each of the subjects performed all three. The stretching protocol included a static stretching routine of the gluteus maximus, hamstrings, quadriceps, and triceps surae. This stretching protocol lasted 7 minutes. The non-stretching group did not stretch, they performed two jump tests; the <b>pre-stretching</b> group stretched first and then performed the two jump tests; and the between-stretching group did the first jump test, stretched and performed the final jump test. Subjects were randomly selected for order of performance in each trial. Results showed a significant difference (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) in <b>pre-stretching</b> group reaction time 1 versus reaction time 2 (p = 0. 035) and a significant difference in the between-stretching group jump height 1 versus jump height 2 (p = 0. 004). There were no other significant differences. This suggests that stretching hinders reaction time and the height of a vertical jump...|$|R
