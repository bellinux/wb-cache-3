40|$|BACKGROUND: Few {{studies have}} {{examined}} whether cognitive symptom patterns differ by age and length of time before dementia onset. Our objective was to investigate whether different patterns of cognitive symptoms at ages 70, 75, and 79 years predict short-term ( 5 years) dementia onset. METHODS: A representative sample of 382 nondemented 70 -year-olds from Gothenburg, Sweden was examined periodically up to age 90 years. Information on dementia in those lost to follow-up was obtained from medical records. Cognitive assessments at ages 70, 75, and 79 years included psychiatric and <b>psychometric</b> <b>examinations.</b> Four patterns of cognitive performance were examined in relation to dementia onset: (1) unimpaired cognition, (2) isolated low memory, (3) low non-memory, and (4) global low cognitive performance. RESULTS: Short-term onset was predicted by global low performance at ages 70, 75, and 79 years and by low non-memory performance at ages 70 and 75. Isolated low memory was not a short-term predictor at any examination, but it predicted long-term onset at ages 70 and 75 years. CONCLUSIONS: A global pattern of low cognitive performance predicts short-term but not long-term onset of dementia, whereas isolated low memory performance predicts dementia only in the long-term. Our findings also suggest that preclinical symptoms of dementia might differ by age...|$|R
40|$|Against the {{background}} of steadily increasing air traffic {{and more and more}} people being affected by aircraft noise, additional efforts are necessary to investigate alternative means for the acceptance of aircraft noise, since the potential of reducing noise will be limited in the future in view of current progress in technical research after having been realized in practice. Therefore a novel approach for manipulating aircraft sounds has been launched by a multi-disciplinary research group, taking into account the frequency spectrum of sounds. A major objective of the project `Sound Engineering for Aircraft´ (SEFA) is to reduce annoyance of people affected by aircraft noise by revealing and ranking the most disturbing aircraft sounds and define target sounds which are perceived as more pleasant and that can be technically achieved by aircraft manufacturers in the future. This requires extensive <b>psychometric</b> <b>examinations</b> in an inter-cultural setting. Results and rankings of most common current aircraft sounds, originally recorded at European airports, and of synthetically modified aircraft sounds will be presented, acquainted in extensive laboratory examinations in seven European countries using Paired Comparison and Semantic Differential data.

40|$|The {{increase}} in proportion of elderly worldwide, {{coupled with the}} fact that increasing age is a primary risk factor for dementia, have fuelled the efforts to unveil the warning signs of dementia. Although important achievements have been made in this field during the last decades, many questions are still to be answered. We set out four studies to clarify which are the symptom patterns that predict dementia onset in the short and in the long-term, at different ages and in different birth cohorts, and also to clarify if cognitive decline in late life is related to mortality in the absence of dementia. In summary, we found that although low performance in memory was necessary to predict dementia, it was not sufficient. Other cognitive domains needed to be affected shortly of dementia onset. Isolated low memory performance predicted dementia only on a longer time frame. In addition, not only Alzheimer’s, but also vascular dementia appeared to have a short prodromal stage, with low performance in all four cognitive domains studied. Relying on self-reports or key informants for early detection of dementia excluded a large group of the population at risk. A global pattern of low cognitive performance according to both psychiatric and <b>psychometric</b> <b>examinations</b> predicted short-term development of dementia with a high positive predictive value. However, the sensitivity for dementia was low. Mortality was also related to declining cognitive performance in the absence of dementia. Furthermore, non-memory cognitive symptoms predicted short-term development of dementia in 70 -year-olds born 1901 - 02, but not in those born 30 years later. Only low memory performance according to the psychiatric examination predicted short-term onset of dementia in the later born cohort.

Age at operation was less than 1 month in 43 % and more than 6 months in 45 %. Abnormal scans were found in 17 (74 %) and showed diffuse findings consistent with hypox-ic-ischemic encephalopathy, with or without areas of cortical infarction; focal cortical infarction alone; and (in one patient) callosal agenesis and abnormal neuronal migration. Normal IQ and neurologic examinations were found in all six of those who had a normal MRI, and five of six children with changes consistent with focal cortical infarction with-out diffuse change had a normal neurologic examination. Cerebral palsy and mental retardation was common in the group with diffuse abnormality (in eight of nine children), and this was more likely to occur in those who underwent prolonged (> 45 minutes) hypothermic circulatory arrest and operation during early infancy (P =. 004). Focal cortical findings without diffuse changes were more likely in those who underwent open heart surgery without hypothermic cir-culatory arrest and were older than 6 months at operation, and these children were less likely to have frank neurodevel-opmental sequelae.

Reliability expressed as intraclass correlation coefficient was 0. 88 (95 % CI 0. 84 – 0. 92) for the overall COMI score and was generally good for most of individual core items. The minimum detectable change (MDC 95 %) was 1. 97. Conclusion This version of the COMI-neck is a valid and reliable instrument, with good psychometric properties. It can be recommended for Polish-speaking patients...|$|R
40|$|The oldest old are the {{fastest-growing}} segment {{of our population}} and have the highest prevalence of dementia. Little {{is known about the}} genetics of cognitive health in the very old. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine whether the genetic risk factors for Alzheimer disease (AD) [...] namely, apolipoprotein E (APOE) epsilon 4 allele and a family history of dementia-continue to be important factors in the cognitive health of the very old. Case-control studies suggest that the effect of genetic factors diminishes at age > 75 years. The present prospective study provided evidence to the contrary. We studied 114 Caucasian subjects who were physically healthy and cognitively intact at age 75 years and who were followed, for an average of 4 years, with neurological, <b>psychometric,</b> and neuroimaging <b>examinations.</b> Excellent health at entry did not protect against cognitive decline. Incidence of cognitive decline rose sharply with age. epsilon 4 and a family history of dementia (independent of epsilon 4) were associated with an earlier age at onset of dementia. Subjects who had epsilon 4 or a family history of dementia had a ninefold-higher age-specific risk for dementia than did those who had neither epsilon 4 nor a family history of dementia. These observations suggest that the rate of cognitive decline increases with age and that APOE and other familial/genetic factors influence the onset age throughout life...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – This paper {{seeks to}} present {{and discuss the}} {{findings}} of a study of staffing practices in the Sri Lankan private sector with particular reference to junior level managerial jobs. The scope of staffing practices consisted of six major areas, namely the usage of information from job analysis in staffing, the sources of labour, selection criteria and selection methods in use, the validation of staffing practices and the involvement of HR managers and line managers in staffing. Design/methodology/approach – Sixty-two companies were selected based on a stratified random sample method from two major types of companies – those listed on the stock exchange and those not listed. A self-administered questionnaire was chosen as the main mode for data collection. For the study, a combination of quantitative and qualitative inquiries was adopted. Findings – Sri Lankan companies placed higher weighting on the external labour market in recruitment and the use of objective criteria in selection. The common ground for the companies is the heavy role that interviews, written <b>examinations,</b> <b>psychometric</b> tests and assessment centres play as selection methods. Originality/value – The credibility of management concepts is partly determined by their diffusion across the world. Also, such credibility will be enhanced if the concepts are viewed to be applicable in different country contexts. However, staffing practices remain dubious {{due to the lack of}} empirical studies in the context of Asian developing countries. Specifically, no such studies have been conducted in the context of Sri Lanka...|$|R
