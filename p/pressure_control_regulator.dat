Other locations require one or more onsite compressors to boost the fuel gas pressure. A rising concern is the fuel gas system transient response immediately after {{a significant reduction in}} the plant fuel gas consumption. Transient analysis models have been developed for typical fuel gas systems of combined cycle plants to ensure that the system is configured to respond appropriately to unplanned disturbances in fuel gas flow such as when a gas turbine trip occurs. <b>Pressure</b> <b>control</b> (<b>regulator)</b> and booster compressor control loop tuning parameters based on quantitative transient model results could be applied to set up targets for use in specifying and commissioning the fuel gas system.

The fuel distributor is mounted atop a control vane through which all intake air must pass, and the system works by varying fuel volume supplied to the injectors based on {{the angle of the}} air vane in the air flow meter, which in turn is determined by the volume of air passing the vane, and by the <b>control</b> <b>pressure.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>pressure</b> is regulated with a mechanical device called the <b>control</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> (CPR) or the warm-up regulator (WUR).

The system, marketed by Öhlins under the brand name CES (Continuously controlled Electronic Suspension), enables a wide working range and ability {{to adapt to the}} current road conditions. By controlling  the valve in different ways there are also possibilities to decide on a specfic damper characteristic such as sport or comfort. The CES valve is working as a pilot <b>controlled</b> <b>pressure</b> <b>regulator</b> and is continuously controlled with help of an electro magnet. The CES valve is mounted in a uniflow damper which in turn guarantees the flow through the valve to go in only one direction independently ofdamper stroke direction. The rst part of the thesis investigates the damping characteristics in the latest model of the CES valve (i. e the CES 8700). A simulation model is made to approximate the damping in the solenoid plunger. Questions that are answered are: How is damping dened, what creates damping in the valve, how large is the damping, what parameters aect the damping.

50|$|A {{clinical}} {{control group}} {{can be a}} placebo arm or it can involve an old method used to address a clinical outcome when testing a new idea. For example in a study released by the British Medical Journal, in 1995 studying the effects of strict blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> versus more relaxed blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> in diabetic patients, the clinical control group was the diabetic patients that did not receive tight blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control.</b> In order {{to qualify for the}} study, the patients had to meet the inclusion criteria and not match the exclusion criteria. Once the study population was determined, the patients were placed in either the experimental group (strict blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> <150/80mmHg) versus non strict blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> (<180/110). There were a wide variety of ending points for patients such as death, myocardial infarction, stroke, etc. The study was stopped before completion because strict blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> was so much superior to the clinical control group which had relaxed blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control.</b> The study was no longer considered ethical because tight blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> was so much more effective at preventing end points that the clinical control group had to be discontinued. The clinical control group is not always a placebo group. Sometimes the clinical control group can involve comparing a new drug to an older drug in a superiority trial. In a superiority trial, the clinical control group is the older medication rather than the new medication. For example in the ALLHAT trial, Thiazide diuretics were demonstrated to be superior to calcium channel blockers or angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors in reducing cardiovascular events in high risk patients with hypertension. In the ALLHAT study, the clinical control group was not a placebo it was ACEI or Calcium Channel Blockers.Overall, clinical control groups can either be a placebo or an old standard of therapy.|$|R

BackgroundThere is growing evidence that ambulatory blood pressure improves risk stratification in untreated subjects with essential hypertension. Surprisingly, {{little is known}} on the prognostic value of this procedure in treated subjects. MethodsDiagnostic procedures including 24 -h noninvasive ambulatory blood pressure monitoring were undertaken in 790 subjects with essential hypertension (mean age 48 years) before therapy and after an average follow-up of 3. 7 years (2, 891 patient-years). ResultsAt the follow-up visit, 26. 6 % of subjects achieved adequate office blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> (< 140 / 90 mm Hg), and 37. 3 % of subjects achieved adequate ambulatory blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> (daytime blood <b>pressure</b> < 135 / 85 mm Hg). Months or years after the follow-up visit, 58 patients suffered a first cardiovascular event. Event rate was lower (0. 71 events/ 100 person-years) among the subjects with adequate ambulatory blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> than among those with higher blood pressure levels (1. 87 events/ 100 person-years) (p = 0. 0026). Ambulatory blood <b>pressure</b> <b>control</b> predicted a lesser risk for subsequent cardiovascular disease independently of other individual risk factors (RR 0. 36; 95 % confidence intervals: 0. 18 to 0. 70; p = 0. 003), including age, diabetes and left ventricular hypertrophy.
