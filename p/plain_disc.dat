Each disc was immersed in ammonium acetate buffer {{in a sealed}} container, and fluid from each container was sampled at zero, one, three, six, 24, 48 and 72 hours and at one, and two weeks. The concentration of gentamicin in the fluid was analysed using high performance liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The fluid sampled at 72 hours from the indented discs containing 0. 17 g gentamicin (0. 88 % w/w) contained a mean of 113 mcg/ml (90. 12 to 143. 5) compared with 44. 5 mcg/ml (44. 02 to 44. 90) in the fluid sampled from the <b>plain</b> <b>discs</b> (p = 0. 012).

40|$|The {{cooling air}} in a gas turbine engine is subject to windage as it flows through the {{internal}} air system. The work in this thesis focuses on the windage generated as the cooling air passes over the rotor surface, particularly for case where bolts are encountered. Reducing windage heating of the cooling air is of great importance to turbomachinery engineers, particularly in the aerospace industry, since the use of compressor air for cooling greatly reduces the thrust potential of an engine. The ability to accurately predict windage can help reduce the quantity of cooling air required, resulting in increased efficiency. A purpose built rig {{was used to measure}} both windage and rotor surface temperature as air passes through an enclosed rotor-stator cavity. A wide range of flow conditions were tested with some being close to those found in a modern gas turbine engine. A variety of both stator and rotor mounted bolts were investigated, of varying size and shape, as well as cavities in the disc surface. In addition, PIV measurements of the core tangential velocity were obtained. Test results show that windage is increased substantially with rotor bolts present, compared with a <b>plain</b> <b>disc,</b> and that it increases with increasing bolt size. For hexagonal rotor bolts a new correlation was produced between the moment coefficient and bolt diameter to pitch ratio for a range of flow conditions, characterised by the rotational and throughflow Reynolds numbers.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a numerical {{study of the}} effect of rotor mounted bolts on the moment coefficient and flow structure within a rotor-stator cavity representative of modern gas turbine engine design.

The simulation methodology is first validated using experimental data from <b>plain</b> co-rotating <b>disc</b> and rotor-stator cavities from the open literature. Comparisons are then made with experimental data obtained from a test rig at the Thermo Fluid Mechanics Research Centre (TFMRC), University of Sussex. Computations were performed at Reφ = 6. 8 × 106, Cw = 5929 (λT = 0. 35) with different numbers of bolts (0 < N < 60), and also a continuous ring, at r/b = 0. 9. The study has improved the current understanding of the effect on moment coefficient and flow structure that rotor mounted protrusions have in rotor-stator systems. It is seen that the contribution of skin friction to the moment coefficient reduces as the number of bolts is increased. The size and shape of the wake created by a rotating bolt also means that the pressure loss per bolt reduces with N but the overall effect is to increase the moment coefficient because there are more bolts.

The problematic frequency is 2400 Hz, the rotor blade exhibiting a 5 - diametric mode order of vibration. The asymmetry is introduced by drilling sets of radial holes into the disc rim. Modal analysis is carried out over a range of frequencies using added masses applied magnetically to the rim of the rotor.

When a set of 5 masses is added to the rotor the vibration amplitude at the troublesome frequency is seen to be considerably reduced. Finite element analysis complements the experimental results. The analysis of a <b>plain</b> <b>disc</b> initially shows the two normal modes at very close frequencies but when asymmetry is introduced, by drilling holes in the rim of the disc, there is a noticeable frequency decoupling of the 2 normal modes.

Comparison of film thickness results to theoretical models shows reasonable qualitative agreement. Experimental results show both a reduced horseshoe, which is limited {{to the rear of the}} contact, and wedge-shaped film thickness profile within the Hertzian contact region. This is unlike conventional hard EHL contacts where the horseshoe-shaped pressure constriction extends around the contact toward the inlet. Experimental results suggest that film thickness profiles take on a convergent wedge shape similar to that used in many hydrodynamic bearings. It is likely that this wedge is largely responsible for generating fluid pressure and therefore the load-carrying capacity of the contact. Copyright © 2011 Elsevier B. V...|$|R

When foam is rotated in a half full RBC (rotary {{biological}} contactor), drops are formed and mass transfer of oxygen to drops is much faster. Most fungi and some mammalian cells need oxygen. Corrugated fibers with holes in the valleys also produce drops. White rot fungus needs oxygen and it degrades many chlorine compounds, azo dyes, PAHs (polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons), and TNT. Old cardboard boxes are readily available and when buried in soil, oxygen is entrapped. In a lake, the boxes expose high area. Celite entrapped in fibers provides even more area. Fibers have high surface area for immobilizing cells and, when the fibers are rotated, fast reactions occur, converting one chemical to another. Sugar has been fermented to alcohol in 10 - 15 minutes. Ethanol has high octane and does not need lead.

40|$|Abstract. In this paper, an FE {{detailed}} study of a gas turbine test disc, subjected to similar conditions as in the rim-spinning test, is presented. Finite element analysis were derived from a <b>plain</b> <b>disc</b> (without cracks) and for a geometry with two types of cracks, both at the notch root of the blade insert and located {{in the corner and}} in the centre (central crack). A crack aspect ratio of (a/c) = 1 was assumed. Fracture mechanics parameters, J integral and K were used in the assessment, and these were computed with the linear elastic and elastic plastic finite element method. Using a crack propagation program with appropriate fatigue creep crack growth rate data, previously obtained in specimens for the nickel base superalloy IN 718 at 600 ºC, fatigue life predictions were made. The predicted life results were checked against experimental data obtained in real test discs, and very good agreement was found. The FE method, based on experimental fatigue data obtained in small laboratory specimens, have shown a great potential for development, and may be able to reduce the enormous costs involved in the testing of real size components and replace tests made in test components.

40|$|The torque {{associated}} with overcoming the losses on a rotating disc {{is of particular}} importance to the designers of gas turbine engines. Not only does this represent a reduction in useful work, but it also gives rise to unwanted heating of metal surfaces and the adjacent fluid. This paper presents a numerical study {{on the effect of}} rotor-mounted bolts on the moment coefficient and velocity distributions within a rotor-stator cavity under conditions representative of modern gas turbine engine design. Steady-state, 2 D and 3 D, CFD simulations are obtained using the FLUENT commercial code with a standard k- turbulence model. The model is validated against experimental data and then used to investigate the effects of varying the number of bolts and also a continuous ring. Two test cases are investigated: one corresponds to where the flow structure is dominated by the superimposed flow (T = 0. 35); the other, where rotation is expected to govern the flow structure (T = 0. 35). It is possible to separate out the contributions due to skin friction and pressure related (form drag and pumping loss) in the CFD results. This shows that the contribution of skin friction to the overall moment coefficient reduces as the number of bolts increases and the pressure related losses increase. There also appears to be a point where increasing the number of bolts does not bring about an increase in the overall moment coefficient. It is also interesting to report that the moment coefficient {{associated with}} a continuous ring is similar to that for a <b>plain</b> <b>disc...</b>|$|E

Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual backup lights, windshield washer, dual speed wipers, wheel <b>discs,</b> <b>plain</b> fender skirts, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows and 2-way power seats. Rubberized front and rear coil springs replaced the trouble prone air suspension system. Four-barrel induction systems were now the sole power choice and dual exhaust were no longer available. A new short-decked four-door Town Sedan hardtop appeared mid-season.|$|R
3000|$|The {{cells were}} seeded into 12 -well cell culture plates {{containing}} the selected substrate at a seeding density of 2 [*]×[*] 104 cells per cm 2 (1.5  mL into each well; {{surface area of}} a well is 3.7  cm 2) and incubated in a controlled atmosphere for either 24  h or for 7  days. A neutral red uptake (NRU) assay was carried out according to the protocol published in Nature Protocols [28]. Briefly, the wells with cells on the substrate were washed three times with PBS, whereupon the substrate was removed into new, clean wells. The cells growing around the substrates remained attached to the surrounding wells; therefore, cell viability of both the old wells (with cells attached to the plastic) and the new wells (with cells attached to the substrate) was assessed using the NRU assay. Then, 1  mL of the freshly prepared medium, supplemented with 40  μg/mL neutral red (NR), was added to each well of both the cell culture plates. After 2  h of incubation at 37  °C, the medium was removed and the NR dye, trapped inside the cellular lysosomes, was released {{by the addition of}} 0.4 mL of de-staining solution (50  % of EtOH, 1  % of glacial acetic acid and 49  % of deionized H 2 O; v/v [...]) per well. For the quantification, 0.1 mL of the sample were transferred into a 96 -well plate and the fluorescence of NR (ex: 530  nm; em: 645  nm) was measured. The cell viability of the cells grown on the control substrate (cover glass), the reference group substrates (Si, Si[*]+[*]Au, Si[*]+[*]Au[*]+[*]PVDF-HFP) and finally the main group substrates (Si[*]+[*]Au[*]+[*]ZnO, Si[*]+[*]Au[*]+[*]ZnO[*]+[*]PVDF-HFP) was assessed. Additionally, the cell viability of cells grown on <b>plain</b> Zn <b>discs</b> was tested in order to assess the viability of the cells grown on a plain, untreated Zn surface. All cell viability tests were performed following the same experimental procedure (NRU assay).|$|R
40|$|Decisions {{about the}} {{treatment}} of neck pain are largely {{made on the basis}} of information gained from plain X-rays and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI), which are used routinely as part of preliminary investigation. We performed a descriptive cadaveric study to compare histology with radiography and MRI. We correlated <b>plain</b> radiography, <b>disc</b> height [Farfan index (FI) ] and MRI findings with histology to assess the ability of radiology to detect significant pathologic lesions. The study included 52 motion segments from nine subjects over the age of 50, who underwent routine hospital autopsy. Disc degeneration was assessed by histology, radiography, disc height (FI: anterior disc height plus posterior disc height divided by anterioposterior diameter) and MRI using established grading systems. Most of the discs were classified radiologically as grade 1 (19 / 52), grade 2 (13 / 52), grade 3 (9 / 52) or grade 4 (3 / 52). Eight of the discs were graded as normal. The distribution of MRI grades was grade 0 (9 / 36), grade 1 (9 / 36), grade 2 (7 / 36), grade 3 (8 / 36) and grade 4 (3 / 36). Half of the discs (26 / 52) showed advanced (grade 4) degeneration histologically. FI correlated with histological grade (P= 0. 013), MRI grade (P= 0. 02) and radiological grade (P< 0. 001) of degeneration. Radiological and histological grade of degeneration showed a weak correlation (r= 0. 3, P= 0. 033). MRI correlated with overall histological grade (r= 0. 41, P= 0. 015, n= 34). Histological features (e. g., tears, rim lesions, prolapse of nucleus material) were poorly recognised by MRI, which had a sensitivity for disc material prolapse and annulus tears of less than 40 %. Our study showed that discs from patients over 50 years are histologically severely degenerated; however, these changes may not be detected by conventional radiography and MRI. A. Christe, R.

5000|$|Cadillac was restyled and {{re-engineered}} for 1961. The Eldorado Biarritz convertible was technically reclassified as a subseries of the De Ville (Series 6300), {{a status}} {{it would keep}} through 1964. An Eldorado convertible would remain in the Cadillac line through 1966, but its differences {{from the rest of}} the line would be generally more modest. The new grille slanted back towards both the bumper and the hood lip, along the horizontal plane, and sat between dual headlamps. New forward slanting front pillars with non-wraparound windshield glass were seen. The Eldorado Biarritz featured front series designation scripts and a lower body [...] "skeg" [...] trimmed with a thin three quarter length spear molding running from behind the front wheel opening to the rear of the car. Standard equipment included power brakes, power steering, automatic transmission, dual back up lights, windshield washer, dual speed wipers, wheel <b>discs,</b> <b>plain</b> fender skirts, outside rearview mirror, vanity mirror, oil filter, power windows, 6-way power bench seat or bucket seats, power vent windows, whitewall tires, and remote control trunk lock. Rubberized front and rear coil springs replaced the trouble prone air suspension system. Four-barrel induction systems were now the sole power choice and dual exhaust were no longer available.
