25|$|In {{a complex}} with reengineered {{bacterial}} <b>phytochrome,</b> biliverdin has been employed as an IR-emitting chromophore for in vivo imaging. In contrast to fluorescent proteins which form their chromophore through posttranslational modifications of the polypeptide chain, phytochromes bind an external ligand (in this case, biliverdin), and successful imaging {{of the first}} bacteriophytochrome-based probe required addition of the exogenous biliverdin. Recent studies demonstrated that bacteriophytochrome-based fluorescent proteins with high affinity to biliverdin can be imaged in vivo utilizing endogenous ligand only and, thus, with the same ease as the conventional fluorescent proteins. Advent of the second and further generations of the biliverdin-binding bacteriophytochrome-based probes should broaden the possibilities for the non-invasive in vivo imaging.|$|E
40|$|AbstractPhytochromes are broadly {{distributed}} photochromic photoreceptors {{that are}} most sensitive in the red and far-red region of the visible spectrum. Three different bilins {{can be used as}} chromophores: plant <b>phytochromes</b> incorporate phytochromobilin, while phycocyanobilin serves as a chromophore of some cyanobacterial <b>phytochromes,</b> whereas all other <b>phytochromes,</b> including cyanobacterial orthologs incorporate biliverdin. During the evolution of plant and cyanobacterial <b>phytochromes,</b> the chromophore binding site has changed from a cysteine close to the N-terminus of the protein, the biliverdin attachment site, to a cysteine which lies within the so-called GAF domain and serves as phytochromobilin or phycocyanobilin attachment site. Since phylogenetic analyses imply that plant <b>phytochromes</b> are not direct successors of cyanobacterial <b>phytochromes,</b> chromophore exchange and the switch of the chromophore binding site has probably occurred at least twice in evolution. This may be regarded as an example for convergent evolution at the molecular level...|$|R
40|$|Plants {{have evolved}} {{exquisite}} sensory systems for monitoring their light environment. The intensity, quality, direction {{and duration of}} light are continuously monitored by the plant and the information gained is used to modulate all aspects of plant development. Several classes of distinct photoreceptors, sensitive to {{different regions of the}} light spectrum, mediate the developmental responses of plants to light signals. The red-far-red light-absorbing, reversibly photochromic <b>phytochromes</b> are perhaps the best characterized of these. Higher plants possess a family of <b>phytochromes,</b> the apoproteins of which are encoded by a small, divergent gene family. Arabidopsis has five apophytochrome-encoding genes, PHYA-PHYE. Different <b>phytochromes</b> have discrete biochemical and physiological properties, are differentially expressed and are involved in the perception of different light signals. Photoreceptor and signal transduction mutants of Arabidopsis are proving to be valuable tools in the molecular dissection of photomorphogenesis. Mutants deficient in four of the five <b>phytochromes</b> have now been isolated. Their analysis indicates considerable overlap in the physiological functions of different <b>phytochromes.</b> In addition, mutants defining components acting downstream of the <b>phytochromes</b> have provided evidence that different members of the family use different signalling pathways...|$|R
40|$|<b>Phytochromes</b> {{regulate}} light- and sucrose-dependent anthocyanin synthesis and accumulation in many plants. Mesophyll-specific phyA {{alone has}} been linked to the regulation of anthocyanin accumulation in response to far-red light in Arabidopsis thaliana. However, multiple mesophyll-localized <b>phytochromes</b> were implicated in the photoregulation of anthocyanin accumulation in red-light conditions. Here, we report a role for mesophyll-specific phyA in blue-light-dependent regulation of anthocyanin levels and novel roles for individual phy isoforms in the regulation of anthocyanin accumulation under red illumination. These results provide new insight into spatial- and isoform-specific regulation of pigmentation by <b>phytochromes</b> in A. thaliana...|$|R
500|$|While this is {{the most}} {{commonly}} understood relationship, Davis et al. (2013) using a combination of plastid genomes have suggested that if Asparagales is treated sensu stricto [...] by excluding its largest and most atypical family, Orchidaceae then Aparagales sensu APG may not be monophyletic and that Orchidaceae and Liliales may be sister groups, and in turn are the sister of Asparagales. However, their data produced conflicting models. Zeng et al. (2014) using nuclear genes also found evidence for a sister relationship between Asparagales and Liliales. Although divergence time estimates within the lilioids have varied considerably, they were also able to obtain molecular clock estimates for the origin of the lilioids at approximately 125mya (Cretaceous period). On the other hand, a large data set using a combined analysis of nuclear, mitochondrial and plastid genes together with nuclear <b>phytochrome</b> C was in agreement with the earlier APG relationships.|$|E
2500|$|Plants use four {{kinds of}} {{photoreceptor}}s: <b>phytochrome,</b> cryptochrome, a UV-B photoreceptor, and protochlorophyllide a. [...] The first two of these, <b>phytochrome</b> and cryptochrome, are photoreceptor proteins, complex molecular structures formed by joining a protein with a light-sensitive pigment. [...] Cryptochrome {{is also known}} as the UV-A photoreceptor, because it absorbs ultraviolet light in the long wave [...] "A" [...] region. [...] The UV-B receptor is one or more compounds not yet identified with certainty, though some evidence suggests carotene or riboflavin as candidates. [...] Protochlorophyllide a, as its name suggests, is a chemical precursor of chlorophyll.|$|E

50|$|Phototropism {{in plants}} such as Arabidopsis thaliana is {{directed}} by blue light receptors called phototropins. Other photosensitive receptors in plants include <b>phytochromes</b> that sense red light and cryptochromes that sense blue light. Different organs of the plant may exhibit different phototropic reactions to different wavelengths of light. Stem tips exhibit positive phototropic reactions to blue light, while root tips exhibit negative phototropic reactions to blue light. Both root tips and most stem tips exhibit positive phototropism to red light.Cryptochromes are photoreceptors that absorb blue/ UV-A light, and they help control the circadian rhythm in plants and timing of flowering. <b>Phytochromes</b> are photoreceptors that sense red/far-red light, but they also absorb blue light. The combination of responses from <b>phytochromes</b> and cryptochromes allow the plant to respond to various kinds of light. Together <b>phytochromes</b> and cryptochromes inhibit gravitropism in hypocotyls and contribute to phototropism.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT It is {{well known}} that <b>phytochromes</b> mediate a wide range of photomorphogenic {{processes}} in plants. In addition, many studies have demonstrated the involvement of <b>phytochromes</b> as part of abiotic stress signaling responses. However, little is known about cadmium (Cd) stress regulation by <b>phytochromes.</b> Thus, in this study, we used the phyA (far red-insensitive; fri), phyB 1 (temporary redinsensitive; tri) and phyB 2 (phyB 2) tomato (Solanum lycopersicum L.) mutants to investigate the roles of these three <b>phytochromes</b> on Cd stress responses. The plants were grown over a 21 -d period in the presence of Cd. We evaluated plant growth, Cd and chlorophyll content and anatomical changes in the leaves. The results indicated that all genotypes were affected by Cd and showed reduced growth of the shoots and roots, as well as reduced chlorophyll content. The accumulation of Cd was similar for all genotypes, and a higher Cd content was found in roots. Anatomical analysis of the vascular bundles revealed that fri and tri seem to be more disrupted by Cd. Overall, these results indicate that <b>phytochromes</b> do not determine Cd stress tolerance in tomato plants...|$|R

2500|$|Plants produce {{hormones and}} other growth {{regulators}} which act to signal a physiological response in their tissues. [...] They also produce compounds such as <b>phytochrome</b> that {{are sensitive to}} light and which serve to trigger growth or development in response to environmental signals.|$|E
2500|$|Although a short day plant cannot flower {{during the}} long days of summer, it is not {{actually}} the period of light exposure that limits flowering. [...] Rather, a short day plant requires a minimal length of uninterrupted darkness in each 24-hour period (a short daylength) before floral development can begin. [...] It has been determined experimentally that a short day plant (long night) does not flower if a flash of <b>phytochrome</b> activating light is used on the plant during the night.|$|E
2500|$|The most studied of the photoreceptors {{in plants}} is <b>phytochrome.</b> [...] It is {{sensitive}} to light in the red and far-red region of the visible spectrum. Many flowering plants use it to regulate the time of flowering based {{on the length of}} day and night (photoperiodism) and to set circadian rhythms. It also regulates other responses including the germination of seeds, elongation of seedlings, the size, shape and number of leaves, the synthesis of chlorophyll, and the straightening of the epicotyl or hypocotyl hook of dicot seedlings.|$|E
40|$|<b>Phytochromes</b> are red and far-red light photoreceptors that {{regulate}} {{various aspects of}} plant development. One of the less-understood roles of <b>phytochromes</b> is the inhibition of hypocotyl negative gravitropism, which refers {{to the loss of}} hypocotyl gravitropism and resulting random growth direction in red or far-red light. This light response allows seedlings to curve toward blue light after emergence from the soil and enhances seedling establishment in the presence of mulch. <b>Phytochromes</b> inhibit hypocotyl negative gravitropism by inhibiting four phytochrome-interacting factors (PIF 1, PIF 3, PIF 4, PIF 5), as shown by hypocotyl agravitropism of dark-grown pif 1 pif 3 pif 4 pif 5 quadruple mutants. We show that <b>phytochromes</b> inhibit negative gravitropism by converting starch-filled gravity-sensing endodermal amyloplasts to other plastids with chloroplastic or etioplastic features in red or far-red light, whereas PIFs promote negative gravitropism by inhibiting the conversion of endodermal amyloplasts to etioplasts in the dark. By analyzing transgenic plants expressing PIF 1 with an endodermis-specific SCARECROW promoter, we further show that endodermal PIF 1 is sufficient to inhibit the conversion of endodermal amyloplasts to etioplasts and hypocotyl negative gravitropism of the pif quadruple mutant in the dark. Although the functions of <b>phytochromes</b> in gravitropism and chloroplast development are normally considered distinct, our results indicate that these two functions are closely related...|$|R

40|$|Phototropism enables {{plants to}} orient growth towards the {{direction}} of light and thereby maximizes photosynthesis in low-light environments. In angiosperms, blue-light photoreceptors called phototropins are primarily involved in sensing {{the direction of}} light. <b>Phytochromes</b> and cryptochromes (sensing red/far-red and blue light, respectively) also modulate asymmetric hypocotyl growth, leading to phototropism. Interactions between different light-signaling pathways regulating phototropism occur in cryptogams and angiosperms. In this review, {{we focus on the}} molecular mechanisms underlying the co-action between photosensory systems in the regulation of hypocotyl phototropism in Arabidopsis thaliana. Recent studies have shown that <b>phytochromes</b> and cryptochromes enhance phototropism by controlling the expression of important regulators of phototropin signaling. In addition, <b>phytochromes</b> may also regulate growth towards light via direct interaction with the phototropins...|$|R
2500|$|Maize is a facultative {{short-day plant}} [...] and flowers {{in a certain}} number of growing degree days > [...] in the {{environment}} to which it is adapted. The magnitude of the influence that long nights have on the number of days that must pass before maize flowers is genetically prescribed and regulated by the <b>phytochrome</b> system. Photoperiodicity can be eccentric in tropical cultivars such that the long days characteristic of higher latitudes allow the plants to grow so tall {{that they do not have}} enough time to produce seed before being killed by frost. These attributes, however, may prove useful in using tropical maize for biofuels.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{flowering}} plants use the pigment <b>phytochrome</b> to sense seasonal changes in day length, which they take as signals to flower. This sensitivity to day length is termed photoperiodism. Broadly speaking, {{flowering plants}} {{can be classified}} as long day plants, short day plants, or day neutral plants, depending on their particular response to changes in day length. [...] Long day plants require a certain minimum length of daylight to starts flowering, so these plants flower in the spring or summer. Conversely, short day plants flower when the length of daylight falls below a certain critical level. Day neutral plants do not initiate flowering based on photoperiodism, though some may use temperature sensitivity (vernalization) instead.|$|E
2500|$|Ethylene is a {{gas that}} forms through the {{breakdown}} of methionine, which is in all cells. Ethylene has very limited solubility in water and does not accumulate within the cell but diffuses out of the cell and escapes out of the plant. [...] Its effectiveness as a plant hormone is dependent on its rate of production versus its rate of escaping into the atmosphere. Ethylene is produced {{at a faster rate}} in rapidly growing and dividing cells, especially in darkness. New growth and newly germinated seedlings produce more ethylene than can escape the plant, which leads to elevated amounts of ethylene, inhibiting leaf expansion (see Hyponastic response). As the new shoot is exposed to light, reactions by <b>phytochrome</b> in the plant's cells produce a signal for ethylene production to decrease, allowing leaf expansion. Ethylene affects cell growth and cell shape; when a growing shoot hits an obstacle while underground, ethylene production greatly increases, preventing cell elongation and causing the stem to swell. The resulting thicker stem can exert more pressure against the object impeding its path to the surface. If the shoot does not reach the surface and the ethylene stimulus becomes prolonged, it affects the stem's natural geotropic response, which is to grow upright, allowing it to grow around an object. [...] Studies seem to indicate that ethylene affects stem diameter and height: When stems of trees are subjected to wind, causing lateral stress, greater ethylene production occurs, resulting in thicker, more sturdy tree trunks and branches. Ethylene affects fruit-ripening: Normally, when the seeds are mature, ethylene production increases and builds-up within the fruit, resulting in a climacteric event just before seed dispersal. [...] The nuclear protein Ethylene Insensitive2 (EIN2) is regulated by ethylene production, and, in turn, regulates other hormones including ABA and stress hormones.|$|E
50|$|In 2009, a {{new kind}} of Infrared Fluorescent Protein (IFP) was {{developed}} by Tsien's group, and further reported and described by Science. The new IFPs are developed from bacterial <b>phytochromes</b> instead of from multicellular organism like jellyfish. Under normal conditions, bacterial <b>phytochromes</b> absorb light for signaling instead of fluorescence, but they can be turned fluorescent after deleting some of the signaling parts by genetic means such as site-directed mutagenesis. In order to fluoresce, IFPs require an exogenous chromophore, biliverdin.|$|R
40|$|<b>Phytochromes</b> {{constitute}} {{one of the}} six well-characterized {{families of}} photosensory proteins in Nature. From the viewpoint of computational modeling, however, <b>phytochromes</b> {{have been the subject of}} much fewer studies than most other families of photosensory proteins, which is likely a consequence of relevant high-resolution structural data becoming available only in recent years. In this work, hybrid quantum mechanics/molecular mechanics (QM/MM) methods are used to calculate UV-vis absorption spectra of Deinococcus radiodurans bacteriophytochrome. We investigate how the choice of QM/MM methodology affects the resulting spectra and demonstrate that QM/MM methods can reproduce the experimental absorption maxima of both the Q and Soret bands with an accuracy of about 0. 15 eV. Furthermore, we assess how the protein environment influences the intrinsic absorption of the bilin chromophore, with particular focus on the Q band underlying the primary photochemistry of <b>phytochromes...</b>|$|R

50|$|In 1983 the {{laboratories}} of Peter Quail and Clark Lagarias reported the chemical purification of the intact <b>phytochrome</b> molecule, and in 1985 the first <b>phytochrome</b> gene sequence {{was published by}} Howard Hershey and Peter Quail. By 1989, molecular genetics and work with monoclonal antibodies {{that more than one}} type of <b>phytochrome</b> existed; for example, the pea plant was shown to have at least two <b>phytochrome</b> types (then called type I (found predominantly in dark-grown seedlings) and type II (predominant in green plants)). It is now known by genome sequencing that Arabidopsis has five <b>phytochrome</b> genes (PHYA - E) but that rice has only three (PHYA - C). While this probably represents the condition in several di- and monocotyledonous plants, many plants are polyploid. Hence maize, for example, has six phytochromes - phyA1, phyA2, phyB1, phyB2, phyC1 and phyC2. While all these phytochromes have significantly different protein components, they all use phytochromobilin as their light-absorbing chromophore. <b>Phytochrome</b> A or phyA is rapidly degraded in the Pfr form - much more so than {{the other members of the}} family. In the late 1980s, the Vierstra lab showed that phyA is degraded by the ubiquitin system, the first natural target of the system to be identified in eukaryotes.|$|E
40|$|Physiological studies over a {{long period}} have shown that light acts to {{regulate}} flowering through the three main variables of quality, quantity, and duration. Intensive molecular genetic and genomic studies with the model plant Arabidopsis have given considerable insight into the mechanisms involved, particularly with regard to quality and photoperiod. For photoperiodism light, acting through <b>phytochromes</b> and cryptochromes, the main photomorphogenetic photoreceptors, acts to entrain and interact with a circadian rhythm of CONSTANS (CO) expression leading to transcription of the mobile floral integrator, FLOWERING LOCUS T (FT). The action of <b>phytochromes</b> and cryptochromes in photoperiodism is augmented by ZEITLUPE (ZTL) and FLAVIN-BINDING, KELCH REPEAT, F-BOX (FKF 1) acting as accessory photoreceptors on entrainment and interaction, respectively. Light quality acts independently of the circadian system through <b>Phytochromes</b> B, D, and E to regulate FT. Light quantity effects, on the other hand, are still incompletely understood but are likely to be linked either directly or indirectly to patterns of assimilate partitioning and resource utilization within the plant...|$|R
40|$|AbstractTime {{measurement}} and light detection are inextricably linked. Cryptochromes, the blue-light photoreceptors shared between plants and animals, {{are critical for}} circadian rhythms in flies and mice [1 â 3]. WC- 1, a putative blue-light photoreceptor, is also essential {{for the maintenance of}} circadian rhythms in Neurospora[4]. In contrast, we report here that in Arabidopsis thaliana the double mutant lacking the cryptochromes cry 1 and cry 2, and even a quadruple mutant lacking the red/far-red photoreceptor <b>phytochromes</b> phyA and phyB as well as cry 1 and cry 2, retain robust circadian rhythmicity. Interestingly, the quadruple mutant was nearly blind for developmental responses but perceived a light cue for entraining the circadian clock. These results indicate that cryptochromes and <b>phytochromes</b> are not essential components of the central oscillator in Arabidopsis and suggest that plants could possess specific photosensory mechanisms for temporal orientation, in addition to cryptochromes and <b>phytochromes,</b> which are used for both spatial and temporal adaptation...|$|R
40|$|Angiosperm seeds {{integrate}} various environmental signals, such {{as water}} availability and light conditions, to make a proper decision to germinate. Once the optimal conditions are sensed, gibberellin (GA) is synthesized, triggering germination. Among environmental signals, light conditions are perceived by <b>phytochromes.</b> However, it is not well understood how <b>phytochromes</b> regulate GA biosynthesis. Here we investigated whether <b>phytochromes</b> regulate GA biosynthesis through PIL 5, a phytochrome-interacting bHLH protein, in Arabidopsis. We found that pil 5 seed germination was inhibited by paclobutrazol, the ga 1 mutation was epistatic to the pil 5 mutation, and the inhibitory effect of PIL 5 overexpression on seed germination could be rescued by exogenous GA, collectively indicating that PIL 5 regulates seed germination negatively through GA. Expression analysis revealed that PIL 5 repressed the expression of GA biosynthetic genes (GA 3 ox 1 and GA 3 ox 2), and activated {{the expression of a}} GA catabolic gene (GA 2 ox) in both PHYA- and PHYB-dependent germination assays. Consistent with these gene-expression patterns, the amount of bioactive GA was higher in the pil 5 mutant and lower in the PIL 5 overexpression line. Lastly, we showed that red and far-red light signals trigger PIL 5 protein degradation through the 26 S proteasome, thus releasing the inhibition of bioactive GA biosynthesis by PIL 5. Taken together, our data indicate that <b>phytochromes</b> promote seed germination by degrading PIL 5, which leads to increased GA biosynthesis and decreased GA degradation...|$|R

50|$|The Pfr state {{passes on}} {{a signal to}} other {{biological}} systems in the cell, such as the mechanisms responsible for gene expression. Although this mechanism is almost certainly a biochemical process, {{it is still the}} subject of much debate. It is known that although phytochromes are synthesized in the cytosol and the Pr form is localized there, the Pfr form, when generated by light illumination, is translocated to the cell nucleus. This implies a role of <b>phytochrome</b> in controlling gene expression, and many genes are known to be regulated by <b>phytochrome,</b> but the exact mechanism has still to be fully discovered. It has been proposed that <b>phytochrome,</b> in the Pfr form, may act as a kinase, and it has been demonstrated that <b>phytochrome</b> in the Pfr form can interact directly with transcription factors.|$|E

40|$|<b>Phytochromes</b> are {{multi-domain}} {{red light}} photosensor proteins, which convert red light photons to biological activity utilizing {{the multitude of}} structural and chemical reactions. The steady increase in structural information obtained from various bacteriophytochromes has increased understanding about the functional mechanism of the photochemical processes of the <b>phytochromes.</b> Furthermore, a number of spectroscopic studies have revealed kinetic information about the light-induced reactions. The spectroscopic changes are, however, challenging {{to connect with the}} structural changes of the chromophore and the protein environment, as the excited state properties of the chromophores are very sensitive to the small structural and chemical changes of their environment. In this article, we concentrate on the results of ultra-fast spectroscopic experiments which reveal information about the important initial steps of the photoreactions of the <b>phytochromes.</b> We survey the excited state properties obtained during the last few decades. The differences in kinetics between different research laboratories are traditionally related to the differences of the studied species. However, we notice that the variation in the excited state properties depends on the subunit composition of the protein as well. This observation illustrates a feedback mechanism from the other domains to the chromophore. We propose that two feedback routes exist in <b>phytochromes</b> between the chromophore and the remotely located effector domain. The well-known connection between the subunits is the so-called tongue region, which changes its secondary structure while changing the light-activated state of the system.
