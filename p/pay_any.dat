5|$|The scandal grew {{to involve}} {{a slew of}} {{additional}} allegations against the President, ranging from the improper use of government agencies to accepting gifts in office and his personal finances and taxes; Nixon repeatedly stated his willingness to <b>pay</b> <b>any</b> outstanding taxes due, and paid $465,000 in back taxes in 1974.|$|E

5|$|The {{reference}} {{must state}} {{the questions on}} which the Tribunal's opinion is required in a form which allows, as far as possible, answers to be given in the affirmative or the negative. There must also be a concise statement of facts, and documents must be included, as are necessary to enable the Tribunal to decide the questions referred. During the hearing of a reference, the procedure in proceedings before the Court of Appeal applies. The President of Singapore is treated as the appellant and all other parties as respondents. However, the Tribunal is not bound by strict rules of evidence. The proceedings of the Tribunal, except for the hearing for directions, are held in open court. No party to any proceedings is ordered to <b>pay</b> <b>any</b> costs, and no court fees are payable in respect of any proceedings.|$|E

5|$|Wilkinson opened Wallace's Book Store in June 1965 after a local {{stockbroker}} {{helped him}} raise the initial capital needed through a public stock offering. By this time, Kentucky had adopted free textbook legislation {{at the behest}} of Governor Julian Carroll, so Wilkinson transitioned to selling college textbooks to students at the University of Kentucky. Throughout the 1960s, Wilkinson refused to pay the state sales tax on his transactions; he and Joe Kennedy, the owner of Kennedy Book Store, both claimed that paying the tax put them at a competitive disadvantage with the university's book store, which did not pay state taxes because it was operated by the university, a tax exempt entity. In 1977, the state Board of Tax Appeals ruled that all three bookstores should have been paying the tax, but by this time, the statute of limitations had expired, and none of the three were required to <b>pay</b> <b>any</b> back taxes. Wallace's Book Store continued to expand rapidly, opening retail stores in twenty-eight states and becoming one of the country's largest book firms. In January 1971, he considered issuing more stock to raise capital to buy Providence, Rhode Island-based Barnes & Noble, but the executive committee of Wallace's was averse to purchasing a company so far away and blocked the move. In April 1977, Wilkinson was cited for false and misleading advertisement in conjunction with claims made in radio ads for Wallace's Book Store claiming they were offering the first discounts in history on new college textbooks. In a court filing, Wilkinson admitted the claims were untrue, promised to stop airing the ads, and agreed to refund any money overpaid by customers.|$|E

25|$|In 1894, Democrats in Congress {{passed the}} Wilson-Gorman tariff, which imposed the first peacetime income tax. The rate was 2% on income over $4000, which meant fewer than 10% of {{households}} would <b>pay</b> <b>any.</b> The {{purpose of the}} income tax was {{to make up for}} revenue that would be lost by tariff reductions.|$|E

25|$|Light {{developed}} George Town {{as a free}} port, {{thus allowing}} merchants to trade without having to <b>pay</b> <b>any</b> form of tax or duties. In effect, this measure was intended to entice traders from the Dutch ports in the region. The number of incoming vessels rose from 85 in 1786 to 3,569 in 1802; George Town's population had also increased to 10,000 by 1792.|$|E

Stewart filed for divorce from Williams on March 22, 2013, {{on the grounds that}} the marriage was irretrievably broken.

25|$|While brothels and prostitutes {{are subject}} to federal income tax and also pay local fees, Nevada has no state income tax, and brothels are exempt from the state {{entertainment}} tax and do not <b>pay</b> <b>any</b> other state taxes. In 2005, brothel owners lobbied to be taxed {{in order to increase}} the legitimacy of the business, but the legislature declined. Brothels pay taxes to their respective counties. Lyon County receives approximately $400,000 to $500,000 per year from these taxes.|$|E

25|$|The {{reserve for}} future claims {{liabilities}} was {{set aside in}} an unusual way. The syndicate bought a reinsurance policy to <b>pay</b> <b>any</b> future claims; the premium was equal {{to the amount of}} the reserve. In other words, rather than putting the reserve into a bank to earn interest, the syndicate transferred its (strictly, its members') liability to pay future claims to a reinsurer. This was RITC – a transaction that allowed the syndicate to be closed, and a profit or loss declared.|$|E
25|$|Penn did {{not always}} pay {{attention}} to details, and had not taken the fairly simple step of determining where the 40th degree of latitude (the southern boundary of his land under the charter) actually was. After he sent letters to several landowners in Maryland advising the recipients that they were probably in Pennsylvania and not to <b>pay</b> <b>any</b> more taxes to Lord Baltimore, trouble arose between the two proprietors. This led to an eighty-year legal dispute between the two families.|$|E

He emphasized it did not appear to him to be an important or even relevant fact in the Joe Wilson controversy.|$|E

This quest leads him to the girl's stepfather, Gregory Belkin, who would <b>pay</b> <b>any</b> price to fulfill his messianic dream via his immense worldwide religious organization, the Temple of the Mind of God.|$|E
25|$|The {{sovereign}} {{and other}} members of the Royal Family are only supported by tax dollars in the performance of their official duties. Should a province be hosting events that involve royal participation, the costs are also split between the federal and provincial spheres—the provincial Crown may pay for accommodation and transport, while the federal Crown supplies funds for Royal Canadian Mounted Police security and other household staff. Residents of the provinces do not <b>pay</b> <b>any</b> money to the royals, either as personal income or to support royal residences outside of the province.|$|E
25|$|Australia {{does not}} <b>pay</b> <b>any</b> {{money to the}} Queen, either for {{personal}} income or to support the royal residences outside Australia. Only when the Queen is in Australia does the Australian government support her {{in the performance of}} her duties. This rule applies equally to other members of the Royal Family. Usually the Queen's Australian governments pay only for the costs associated with the Governor-General and state governors in their exercising of the powers of the Crown on behalf of the Queen, including travel, security, residences, offices and ceremonial occasions.|$|E
