Both PSE and PSA feeding resulted in decreased plasma triglyceride concentrations compared with HFD, while plasma cholesterol levels were unchanged. Interestingly, hepatic cholesterol levels were decreased in the PSE/PSA groups compared with HFD and no differences were found in hepatic triglyceride levels between groups. To investigate the mechanism underlying the hypotriglyceridemic effects from PSE/PSA feeding, we measured chylomicron and VLDL secretion. PSE and PSA feeding resulted in reduced VLDL secretion, while no differences were found between groups in chylomicron secretion. In conclusion, our data indicate that plasma triglyceride-lowering resulting from PSE and PSA feeding is associated with decreased hepatic VLDL secretion...|$|R

5000|$|The name Becel {{originates}} {{from the}} three letter acronym BCL (Blood Cholesterol Lowering). When introduced, the blood cholesterol lowering effect was achieved by modifying the triacylglycerol (TAG) profile of the fat used in the margarine: an increased level of poly-unsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) reduces the blood cholesterol level.

In recent years the Becel/Flora brand has added cooking oil, pot yogurt and yogurt drinks to the non-margarine products, all of which are designed to help lower blood cholesterol level. This is achieved by a highly increased resorption of beta-sitosterol and other phytosterols which accumulate especially in the intima of blood vessels and may cause arteriosclerotic plaques.

40|$|LDL {{cholesterol}} {{is associated}} with the development of atherosclerosis and is therefore considered an important target for intervention to prevent cardiovascular diseases. The inhibition of cholesterol absorption in the small intestine is an attractive approach to lowering plasma cholesterol, one that is exploited by drug therapy as well as dietary supplementation with plant sterols. The mechanism of action of <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> <b>esters</b> (PSE) is still incompletely understood, therefore this study was conducted to test the hypothesis that hydrolysis of <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> <b>esters</b> is necessary for their cholesterol-lowering effects to be realized. Male Syrian hamsters were fed diets containing no PSE, PSE containing stearic acid, palmitic acid, oleic acid or plant sterol ethers containing stearic acid. Treatment compounds were added at 5 % of the diet (g/g). Diets were high is cholesterol and saturated fat to induce hyperlipidemia. The treatments effectively created a spectrum of PSE hydrolysis across which cholesterol metabolism could be compared. Stearate ethers, Stearate Esters and Palmitate Esters were poorly hydrolyzed (1. 69 - 4. 12 %), while oleate sters were hydrolyzed at 88. 29 %, and cholesterol absorption correlated negatively with percent hydrolysis with a correlation coefficient of - 0. 8504. These results suggest that PSE hydrolysis plays a necessary role in the cholesterol-lowering effects of PSE. In addition, these data also suggest that poorly hydrolyzed <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> <b>esters</b> may act through an alternative mechanism than that of competition with cholesterol for micelle incorporation. We suggest that these PSE that are not well hydrolyzed may lower cholesterol by forming an oil phase into which cholesterol is solubilized making it unavailable for absorption into enterocytes. In summary, our results demonstrated that PSE hydrolysis is necessary for cholesterol-lowering. Additionally, poorly hydrolyzed PSE may function through an alternative pathway than micelle competition with cholesterol. Advisor: Timothy P. Car...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Studies {{have been}} {{conducted}} on supplementing the daily diet with plant sterol ester-enriched milk derivatives {{in order to reduce}} LDL-cholesterol levels and, consequently, cardiovascular risk.

The main objective {{of this study is to}} determine the efficacy of the intake of 2 g of <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> <b>esters</b> a day in lowering LDL-cholesterol levels in patients diagnosed with hypercholesterolaemia. The specific objectives are: 1) to quantify the efficacy of the daily intake of <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> <b>esters</b> in lowering LDL-cholesterol, total cholesterol and cardiovascular risk in patients with hypercholesterolaemia; 2) to evaluate the occurrence of adverse effects of the daily intake of plant sterol esters; 3) to identify the factors that determine a greater reduction in lipid levels in subjects receiving plant sterol ester supplements. Methods/Design Randomised, double-blind, placebo controlled experimental trial carried out at family doctors' surgeries at three health centres in the Health Area of Albacete (Spain). The study subjects will be adults diagnosed with "limit" or "defined" hypercholesterolaemia and who have LDL cholesterol levels of 130 mg/dl or over.

This study aims to characterize the compositional and functional effects of several nutritional, neutraceutical, and pharmaceutical cardiovascular disease interventions on the gut microbiome, through metagenomic and metabolomic approaches. Apolipoprotein-E-deficient mice were fed for 24 weeks either high-fat/cholesterol diet alone (control, HFC) or high-fat/cholesterol in conjunction with one of three dietary interventions, as follows: <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> <b>ester</b> (PSE), oat β-glucan (OBG) and bile salt hydrolase-active Lactobacillus reuteri APC 2587 (BSH), or the drug atorvastatin (STAT). The gut microbiome composition was then investigated, in addition to the host fecal and serum metabolome. Results: We observed major shifts in the composition of the gut microbiome of PSE mice, while OBG and BSH mice displayed more modest fluctuations, and STAT showed relatively few alterations. Interestingly, these compositional effects imparted by PSE were coupled with an increase in acetate and reduction in isovalerate (p < 0. 05), while OBG promoted n-butyrate synthesis (p < 0. 01). In addition, PSE significantly dampened the microbial production of the proatherogenic precursor compound, trimethylamine (p < 0. 05), attenuated cholesterol accumulation, and nearly abolished atherogenesis in the model (p < 0. 05). However, PSE supplementation produced the heaviest mice with the greatest degree of adiposity (p < 0. 05).

Apolipoprotein-E-deficient mice were fed for 24  weeks either high-fat/cholesterol diet alone (control, HFC) or high-fat/cholesterol in conjunction with one of three dietary interventions, as follows: <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> <b>ester</b> (PSE), oat β-glucan (OBG) and bile salt hydrolase-active Lactobacillus reuteri APC 2587 (BSH), or the drug atorvastatin (STAT). The gut microbiome composition was then investigated, in addition to the host fecal and serum metabolome. Results We observed major shifts in the composition of the gut microbiome of PSE mice, while OBG and BSH mice displayed more modest fluctuations, and STAT showed relatively few alterations. Interestingly, these compositional effects imparted by PSE were coupled with an increase in acetate and reduction in isovalerate (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), while OBG promoted n-butyrate synthesis (p[*]<[*] 0. 01). In addition, PSE significantly dampened the microbial production of the proatherogenic precursor compound, trimethylamine (p[*]<[*] 0. 05), attenuated cholesterol accumulation, and nearly abolished atherogenesis in the model (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). However, PSE supplementation produced the heaviest mice with the greatest degree of adiposity (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Finally, PSE, OBG, and STAT all appeared to have considerable impact on the host serum metabolome, including alterations in several acylcarnitines previously associated with a state of metabolic dysfunction (p[*]<[*] 0. 05). Conclusions We observed functional alterations in microbial and host-derived metabolites, which may have important implications for systemic metabolic health, suggesting that cardiovascular disease interventions may {{have a significant impact on}} the microbiome composition and functionality. This study indicates that the gut microbiome-modifying effects of novel therapeutics should be considered, in addition to the direct host effects. peer-reviewedPaul M.

40|$|The aim of {{the current}} study was to {{evaluate}} the therapeutic effects of omega– 3 <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> <b>esters</b> (n– 3 –PSE) on lipid profile and other coronary heart disease risk factors in subjects with mixed hyperlipidemia. N– 3 –PSE treatment did not result in a significant change in LDL–C levels. Triglyceride levels were reduced significantly in the n– 3 –PSE group in comparison with the placebo group (p = 0. 025). Diastolic blood pressure and level of high-sensitivity C–reactive protein (hsCRP) were reduced significantly, too. So, in patients with mixed hyperlipidemia, n– 3 –PSE treatment may offer a safe and effective therapy for triglyceride level reduction while avoiding the typical increase in LDL–C levels associated with n– 3 fatty acid treatment. The observed reduction in blood pressure and inflammation markers warrants further evaluation. The positive effect of n– 3 –PSE treatment was preserved {{at the end of the}} follow up phase. </strong...|$|E
40|$|Abstract: In this study, we {{evaluated}} {{the effects of}} dietary plant sterols and stanols as their fatty acid esters {{on the development of}} experimental colitis. The effects were studied both in high- and low-fat diet conditions in two models, one acute and another chronic model of experimental colitis that resembles gene expression in human inflammatory bowel disease (IBD). In the first experiments in the high fat diet (HFD), we did not observe a beneficial effect of the addition of plant sterols and stanols on the development of acute dextran sulphate sodium (DSS) colitis. In the chronic CD 4 CD 45 RB T cell transfer colitis model, we mainly observed an effect of the presence of high fat on the development of colitis. In this HFD condition, the presence of plant sterol or stanol did not result in any additional effect. In the second experiments with low fat, we could clearly observe a beneficial effect of the addition of plant sterols on colitis parameters in the T cell transfer model, but not in the DSS model. This positive effect was related to the gender of the mice and on Treg presence in the colon.

40|$|Glycerolipids, sphingolipids, and sterol lipids {{constitute}} the major lipid classes in <b>plants.</b> <b>Sterol</b> lipids {{are composed of}} free and conjugated sterols, i. e., <b>sterol</b> <b>esters,</b> <b>sterol</b> glycosides, and acylated sterol glycosides. Sterol lipids play crucial roles during adaption to abiotic stresses and plant-pathogen interactions. Presently, no comprehensive method for sterol lipid quantification in plants is available. We used nanospray ionization quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (Q-TOF MS) to resolve and identify the molecular species of all four sterol lipid classes from Arabidopsis thaliana. Free sterols were derivatized with chlorobetainyl chloride. <b>Sterol</b> <b>esters,</b> <b>sterol</b> glycosides, and acylated sterol glycosides were ionized as ammonium adducts. Quantification of molecular species was achieved in the positive mode after fragmentation {{in the presence of}} internal standards. The amounts of sterol lipids quantified by Q-TOF MS/MS were validated by comparison with results obtained with TLC/GC. Quantification of sterol lipids from leaves and roots of phosphate-deprived A. thaliana plants revealed changes in the amounts and molecular species composition. The Q-TOF method is far more sensitive than GC or HPLC. Therefore, Q-TOF MS/MS provides a comprehensive strategy for sterol lipid quantification that can be adapted to other tandem mass spectrometers...|$|R

In the present study, thirty six rats divided into six groups were investigated to know the role of ω- 3 fatty acid rich <b>sterol</b> <b>esters</b> (eicosapentaenoic acid-docosahexaenoic acid rich <b>sterol</b> <b>ester,</b> α-linolenic acid rich <b>sterol</b> <b>ester)</b> on hypercholesterolemia. Hypercholesterolemia was developed in the rats by adding cholesterol in the diet at the level of 1 % and they were treated with two therapeutic doses (0. 25, 0. 5 g kg - 1 b. wt. day - 1) of two sitosterol esters (eicosapentaenoic acid-docosahexaenoic acid rich <b>sterol</b> <b>ester,</b> α-linolenic acid rich <b>sterol</b> <b>ester).</b> Both the <b>sterol</b> <b>esters</b> proved to be hypolipemiant but the effect of eicosapentaenoic acid-docosahexaenoic acid rich <b>sterol</b> <b>ester</b> was more pronounced than α-linolenic acid rich <b>sterol</b> <b>ester.</b> Both the <b>sterol</b> <b>esters</b> proved to be antioxidative by increasing the levels of antioxidant enzymes in the liver of the treated rats but the effect of α-linolenic acid rich <b>sterol</b> <b>ester</b> was about 40 % greater than eicosapentaenoic acid-docosahexaenoic acid rich <b>sterol</b> <b>ester.</b> The overall results show that the higher dose (0. 5 g kg - 1 b. wt. day - 1) was much effective than the lower dose...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Consumption of <b>plant</b> <b>sterol</b> (PS) <b>esters</b> lower low-density {{lipoprotein}} (LDL) -cholesterol levels by suppressing intestinal absorption of cholesterol. Commercially available PS are mainly esterified to omega- 6 fatty acid (FA), such as sunflower oil (SO) FA. Emerging trends include using other {{sources such as}} olive oil (OO) or omega- 3 FA from fish oil (FO), known to exert potent hypotriglyceridemic effects. Our objective was to compare the actions of different FA esterified to PS on blood lipids, carotenoid bioavailability as well as inflammatory and coagulation markers. Methods Twenty-one moderately overweight, hypercholesterolemic subjects consumed experimental isoenergetic diets enriched with OO (70 % of fat), each lasting 28 -day and separated by 4 -week washout periods, using a randomized crossover design. Diets were supplemented with three PS esters preparations, PS-FO, PS-SO, or PS-OO. All PS treatments contained an equivalent of 1. 7 PS g/d, and the PS-FO provided a total of 5. 4 g/d FO FA (eicosapentaenoic and docosahexaenoic acids). Results There were no differences between PS-containing diet effects on total cholesterol, LDL-cholesterol, or high-density lipoprotein (HDL) -cholesterol levels. However, PS-FO consumption resulted in markedly lower (P Conclusion Our findings suggest that, in hypercholesterolemic subjects consuming an OO-based diet, PS-FO results in lowered blood triglyceride and PAI- 1 concentrations, and higher fat-soluble vitamin levels {{in comparison to the}} vegetable oil FA esters of PS (PS-SO and PS-OO). Thus, PS-FO may offer hyperlipidemic subjects a more comprehensive lipid lowering approach while reducing the potential risk of decreased plasma carotenoid concentrations. </p...|$|R
