5|$|Pheochromocytomas are {{tumors of the}} {{adrenal medulla}} that arise from chromaffin cells. They can produce a variety of nonspecific symptoms, which include headaches, sweating, anxiety and <b>palpitations.</b> Common signs include {{hypertension}} and tachycardia.

40|$|Introduction: Atrial {{arrhythmia}} is {{a common}} complication in patients with gastro esophageal reflux disease (GERD). The treatment of <b>palpitation</b> is relatively problematic in these patients, especially {{if there is not}} enough evidence of cardiovascular or systemic diseases. The esophagus is in close proximity to the left atrium posterior wall. Hypothetically, locally released cytokines from esophageal injuries could stimulate the left atrium and produce premature atrial contractions. In this study we aimed to evaluate the effects of pantoprazole on <b>palpitation</b> in patients with reflux <b>palpitation.</b> Materials and Methods: This study was conducted on patients presented with <b>palpitation</b> and symptom of GERD from January 2014 to June 2014 in the General Clinic of Imam Reza Hospital. In order to establish the precise effects of pantoprazole on the treatment of <b>palpitation</b> in GERD patients, pantoprazole was added to the beta-blockers during treatment, and the patients were followed-up for one month. Results: In total, 10 patients within the age range of 21 - 35 years with a history of <b>palpitation</b> were enrolled in this study. The mean age of the subjects was 25 years, and the study group consisted of 6 men and 4 women. After a one-month follow-up, a significant reduction was observed in the <b>palpitation</b> of these patients (...|$|R

5|$|Saint-Amant {{wanted a}} third match, but Staunton was {{initially}} unwilling {{as he had}} developed heart <b>palpitations</b> during the second match. Von der Lasa later suggested this was why Staunton faded in the second match. However, after a long, difficult negotiation, which he reported in the Chess Player's Chronicle, Staunton went to Paris intending to start their third match in October 1844, but he caught pneumonia while travelling and almost died; the match was postponed and never took place.|$|E
5|$|The major {{side effects}} include dilated pupils, blurred vision, dryness of the mouth, extreme alertness, pruritus, confusion, agitation, tremor, {{extrapyramidal}} symptoms (dystonia, akathisia), headache, dizziness, anxiety, insomnia, vomiting, chest pain, hallucinations, paresthesia, tachycardia, hypertension, <b>palpitations,</b> collapse, hyperventilation, sweating, hyperthermia and problems with urine retention. The more severe toxic effects include psychosis or adverse psychiatric events, renal toxicity, respiratory failure, hyperthermia, serotonin syndrome, rhabdomyolysis and seizure. Blood benzylpiperazine concentrations have been measured either to confirm clinical intoxication or {{as part of}} a medicolegal death investigation.|$|E

5|$|Excessive {{production}} of the thyroid hormones is called hyperthyroidism, which is most commonly a result of Graves' disease, a toxic multinodular goitre, a solitary thyroid adenoma, or inflammation. Other causes include drug-induced excess of iodine, particularly from amiodarone, an antiarrhythmic medication; an excess caused by the preferential uptake of iodine by the thyroid following iodinated contrast imaging; or from pituitary adenomas which may cause an over{{production of}} thyroid stimulating hormone. Hyperthyroidism often causes a variety of non-specific symptoms including weight loss, increased appetite, insomnia, decreased tolerance of heat, tremor, <b>palpitations,</b> anxiety and nervousness. In some cases it can cause chest pain, diarrhoea, hair loss and muscle weakness. Such symptoms may be managed temporarily with drugs such as beta blockers.|$|E
5|$|The disease-modifying {{treatments}} {{have several}} adverse effects. One {{of the most}} common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with intramuscular injections). Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart <b>palpitations,</b> and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes. More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, and acute myeloid leukemia (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, and progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated).|$|E
5|$|The {{first part}} of the episode was written by Al Septien and Turi Meyer, whereas the second half was written by Peterson and Souders. Due to the {{important}} nature of the episode, Septien, Meyer, Peterson, and Souders began working on the script before Christmas, in the fall of 2010 after the writers had a general idea for the {{first part of}} the 10th season episodes. Souders later explained that the script had been finalized when Rosenbaum agreed to return to the series. As such, this forced the writers to redo parts of the episode to make room for his character. The work was so stressful, Souders said, that she experienced heart <b>palpitations</b> due to exhaustion, excitement, and the emotion of the experience.|$|E
50|$|Before {{necropsy}} takes place, diagnosis by <b>palpitation</b> {{can be used}} to find tubular lesions. Those tubular lesions are firm, firmly {{attached to}} organs, and are felt in the subcutaneous tissue. While <b>palpitation</b> is practical and simple, errors can be made in nestlings’ examinations because their ribs have the potential to present as lesions. Diagnosis is also attainable by examining fecal samples, but has the high potential of false negatives. That possibility is increased in fledging feces “where severe disease may precede appearance of eggs in the feces”.|$|R

5|$|The {{most common}} {{conditions}} associated with thrombophilia are {{deep vein thrombosis}} (DVT) and pulmonary embolism (PE), which are referred to collectively as venous thromboembolism (VTE). DVT usually occurs in the legs, and is characterized by pain, swelling and redness of the limb. It may lead to long-term swelling and heaviness due to damage to valves in the veins. The clot may also break off and migrate (embolize) to arteries in the lungs. Depending on the size {{and the location of}} the clot, this may lead to sudden-onset shortness of breath, chest pain, <b>palpitations</b> and may be complicated by collapse, shock and cardiac arrest.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the early}} regency, both the Pierlot and {{subsequent}} Achille Van Acker governments attempted to avoid confronting {{the issue of}} Leopold's return despite calls from Communists, some Socialists and trade unionists for the King's abdication in April and May 1945. Soon after the King's liberation, Van Acker and a government delegation headed to Strobl, Austria to negotiate with Leopold. At {{a series of meetings}} between 9 and 11 May 1945, Van Acker insisted that the King publicly announce his support for the Allied cause and his commitment to parliamentary democracy. No agreement was reached. In the meantime, Leopold took up residence in Pregny (near Geneva) in Switzerland under the pretext that heart <b>palpitations</b> made further negotiations or thoughts of return to political life impossible.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} of the toxic effects information came from a study conducted between 1 April 2005 to 1 September 2005. The study recorded all presentations associated with party pill use at the Emergency Department of Christchurch Hospital, New Zealand by recording them on a prospective data collection form. The aim was to study the patterns of human toxicity related {{to the use of}} benzylpiperazine-based 'party pills'. 61 patients presented on 80 occasions. Patients with mild to moderate toxicity experienced symptoms such as insomnia, anxiety, nausea, vomiting, <b>palpitations,</b> dystonia and urinary retention. Significantly, fourteen toxic seizures were recorded with two patients suffering life-threatening toxicity with status epilepticus and severe respiratory and metabolic acidosis. It was concluded that BZP appears to induce toxic seizures in neurologically normal subjects. The results of this study and others like it showed that BZP can cause unpredictable and serious toxicity in some individuals, but the data and dosage collection were reliant on self reporting by drug users, which may result in under-reporting (or over-reporting), and there were complicating factors like the frequent presence of alcohol and other drugs.|$|E
40|$|In 54 {{patients}} with preexcitation, 30 (56 %) had inducible A-V re-entrant paroxysmal tachycardia. Of these 30, 20 had spontaneous paroxysmal tachycardia (four also had atrial fibrillation), four had spontaneous paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, five {{had a history}} of <b>palpitation</b> without arrhythmia, and one was asymptomatic. In 24 patients (44 %), paroxysmal tachycardia was not inducible. Of these 24, none had documented paroxysmal tachycardia, four had atrial fibrillation, nine had <b>palpitation</b> without arrhythmia, and 11 were asymptomatic. The incidence of documented paroxysmal tachycardia was higher in the {{patients with}} inducible tachycardia (P < 0. 001). Tachycardia induction was noted in 20 of 20 patients with spontaneous paroxysmal tachycardia, eight of 12 patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation, five of 14 patients with <b>palpitation</b> and no arrhythmia, and one of 12 asymptomatic patients. The frequency of ability to induce paroxysmal tachycardia was significantly higher in both the patients with documented spontaneous paroxysmal tachycardia and the patients with paroxysmal atrial fibrillation than in the asymptomatic group (P < 0. 01) ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Palpitation</b> is {{a common}} {{presenting}} symptom in the emergency department. Wolf-Parkinson White (WPW) syndrome is a cardiac conduction disorder that may present with <b>palpitation</b> and lead to sudden cardiac death. WPW could be detected by  electrocardiogram (ECG). In this case report, we present two young male patients with WPW syndrome admitted to our hospital with history of repeated and progressive <b>palpitation.</b> ECG of the first patient revealed supraventricular tachycardia which converted to sinus rhythm after propanolol treatment. ECG showed sinus rhythm with delta wave in lead II,III,aVF, V 1 suggesting the presence of accessory pathway (AP) in left lateral wall. Electrophysiology study confirmed the presence of AP and radio frequency catheter ablation was successfully done resulted in disappearance of delta on outpatient clinic ECG. Patient has no symptom and he {{do not have to}} take medication. ECG of the second patient revealed supraventricular tachycardia with abberancy. After amiodarone infusion, ECG showed sinus rhythm with delta wave in lead I,II,aVL suggesting the presence of accessory pathway in anteroseptal wall. Electrophysiology study and catheter ablation did not perform for this patient because of financial problem, however amidarone has to be taken regularly to prevent the recurrence of supraventricular tachycardia.

5|$|Graves' {{disease is}} an {{autoimmune}} disorder {{that is the}} most common cause of hyperthyroidism. In Graves' disease, for an unknown reason autoantibodies develop against the thyroid stimulating hormone receptor. These antibodies activate the receptor, leading to development of a goitre and symptoms of hyperthyroidism, such as heat intolerance, weight loss, diarrhoea and <b>palpitations.</b> Occasionally such antibodies block but do not activate the receptor, leading to symptoms associated with hypothyroidism. In addition, gradual protrusion of the eyes may occur, called Graves' ophthalmopathy, as may swelling of the front of the shins. Graves' disease can be diagnosed by the presence of pathomnomonic features such as involvement of the eyes and shins, or isolation of autoantibodies, or by results of a radiolabelled uptake scan. Graves' disease is treated with anti-thyroid drugs such as propylthiouracil, which decrease the production of thyroid hormones, but hold a high rate of relapse. If there is no involvement of the eyes, then use of radioactive isotopes to ablate the gland may be considered. Surgical removal of the gland with subsequent thyroid hormone replacement may be considered, however this will not control symptoms associated with the eye or skin.|$|E
