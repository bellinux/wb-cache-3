50|$|Theoretically {{this system}} is also {{applicable}} to <b>cancel</b> <b>messages.</b> However, it would not only require a key pair for every Usenet user but also that the respective public key is known to every news server. Cancel-lock is much simpler, but neither commonly accepted, nor implemented in popular news servers and newsreaders.|$|R
50|$|According to RFC 1036 {{only the}} author of the target message or the local news {{administrator}} is allowed to send a cancel. To verify authorization the From: line (or Sender: line, if it exists) of the <b>cancel</b> <b>message</b> must match the target article. This verification does not work well in modern day Usenet and is rarely used.|$|R
50|$|Automated Retroactive Minimal Moderation (ARMM) was {{a program}} {{developed}} by Richard Depew in 1993 {{to aid in}} the control of Usenet abuse. Concerned by abusive posts emanating from certain anonymous-posting sites, Depew developed ARMM to allow news administrators to automatically issue <b>cancel</b> <b>messages</b> for such posts. This was a controversial act, as many news administrators and users were concerned about censorship of the netnews medium.|$|R
5000|$|A {{culture of}} {{neutrality}} towards content precluded defining spam {{on the basis}} of advertisement or commercial solicitations. The word [...] "spam" [...] was usually taken to mean [...] "excessive multiple posting (EMP)", and other neologisms were coined for other abuses [...] - [...] such as [...] "velveeta" [...] (from the processed cheese product of that name) for [...] "excessive cross-posting". A subset of spam was deemed [...] "cancellable spam", for which it is considered justified to issue third-party <b>cancel</b> <b>messages.</b>|$|R
25|$|In {{cases where}} {{unsuitable}} content has been posted, Usenet has support for automated {{removal of a}} posting from the whole network by creating a <b>cancel</b> <b>message,</b> although {{due to a lack}} of authentication and resultant abuse, this capability is frequently disabled. Copyright holders may still request the manual deletion of infringing material using the provisions of World Intellectual Property Organization treaty implementations, such as the United States Online Copyright Infringement Liability Limitation Act, but this would require giving notice to each individual news server administrator.|$|R
5000|$|Serdar Argic - alias used {{in one of}} {{the first}} {{automated}} newsgroup spam incidents on Usenet, with the objective of denying the Armenian Genocide, it was an automated bot that made thousands of posts to several newsgroups (especially [...] "soc.history", [...] "soc.culture.turkish", and [...] "misc.headlines") in 1994. The deluge of posts suddenly disappeared in April, 1994, after Stefan Chakerian created a specific newsgroup ("alt.cancel.bots") to carry only <b>cancel</b> <b>messages</b> specifically for any post from any machine downstream from the UUNET feed which carried Serdar Argic's messages.|$|R
50|$|During playback, it is {{necessary}} to send the audio data at a rate that keeps the audio playing smoothly, but without sending it faster than the modem can handle it. It is also desirable to make sure the modem can always abort playback and discard any buffered audio in case a message is to be <b>canceled.</b> <b>Message</b> cancellation is expected by callers who already know the answers to voice prompts and provide their answer early (and who would become irritated at being forced to listen to a prompt they've already responded to).|$|R
5000|$|A UDP was {{implemented}} against UUNET on 1 August 1997 after {{it became a}} host for many spammers and was unresponsive to abuse complaints. It forced the provider to implement antispam policies and tools and close their open relays. Executives called the UDP [...] "digital terrorism", threatened legal action, and asserted they had been planning to move against spammers anyway. As the volume of spam from UUNET decreased, the organizers called off the penalty on August 6, though their announcement was stifled by <b>cancel</b> <b>messages</b> from UDP opponents.|$|R
5000|$|Usenet {{convention}} defines spamming as [...] "excessive multiple posting", that is, {{the repeated}} posting {{of a message}} (or substantially similar messages). During the early 1990s there was substantial controversy among Usenet system administrators (news admins) {{over the use of}} <b>cancel</b> <b>messages</b> to control spam. A [...] "cancel message" [...] is a directive to news servers to delete a posting, causing it to be inaccessible. Some regarded this as a bad precedent, leaning towards censorship, while others considered it a proper use of the available tools to control the growing spam problem.|$|R
50|$|After an HLR {{receives}} an Update Location request from a visiting network, the HLR {{must be able}} to identify whether the new and old visiting networks are Super-Charged or not. If the old visiting network is Super-Charged, the HLR does not send a <b>Cancel</b> Location <b>message.</b> If the old visiting network is not Super-Charged, the HLR sends the <b>Cancel</b> Location <b>message.</b> If the new visiting network is Super-Charged and has previously received the subscriber information and it is not outdated, the HLR does not send an Insert Subscriber Data request. Otherwise, the HLR will send the Insert Subscriber Data request.|$|R
50|$|On Usenet, the Usenet Death Penalty (or UDP) is a final penalty {{that may}} be issued against Internet service {{providers}} or single users who produce too much spam or fail to adhere to Usenet standards. Messages that fall {{under the jurisdiction of}} a Usenet Death Penalty will be <b>cancelled.</b> <b>Cancelled</b> <b>messages</b> are deleted from Usenet servers and not allowed to propagate. This causes users on the affected ISP to be unable to post to Usenet, and it puts pressure on the ISP to change their policies. Notable cases include actions taken against UUNET, CompuServe, and Excite@Home.|$|R
5000|$|The Serdar Argic posts {{suddenly}} {{disappeared in}} April 1994, after Stefan Chakerian created a specific newsgroup (alt.cancel.bots) to carry only <b>cancel</b> <b>messages</b> specifically for any post from any machine downstream from the [...] "anatolia" [...] UUNET feed which carried Serdar Argic's messages. This {{dealt with the}} censorship complaints of direct cancellations, because carrying a newsgroup was always the option of the news feed, and no cancellations would propagate unless the news administrator intentionally carried the alt.cancel.bots group. If sites chose to carry the group, which most did, all of Serdar Argic's messages were removed from all newsgroups.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{introduces}} a Delta-Sigma fractional-N digital PLL {{based on a}} single-bit TDC. A digital-to-time converter, placed in the feedback <b>path,</b> <b>cancels</b> out the quantization noise introduced by the dithering of the frequency divider modulus and permits to achieve low noise at low power. The PLL is implemented in a standard 65 -nm CMOS process. It achieves 102 -dBc/Hz phase noise at 50 -kHz offset and a total absolute jitter below 560 fsrms (integrated from 3 kHz to 30 MHz), even in the worst-case of a 42 -dBc in-band fractional spur. The synthesizer tuning range spans from 2. 92 GHz to 4. 05 GHz with 70 -Hz resolution. The total power consumption is 4. 5 mW, {{which leads to the}} best jitter-power trade-off obtained with a fractional-N synthesizer. The synthesizer demonstrates the capability of frequency modulation up to 1. 25 -Mb/s data rate...|$|R
25|$|Removal of copyrighted {{content from}} the entire Usenet network is a nearly {{impossible}} task, due to the rapid propagation between servers and the retention done by each server. Petitioning a Usenet provider for removal only removes it from that one server's retention cache, but not any others. It is possible for a special post cancellation message to be distributed to remove it from all servers, but many providers ignore <b>cancel</b> <b>messages</b> by standard policy, {{because they can be}} easily falsified and submitted by anyone. For a takedown petition to be most effective across the whole network, {{it would have to be}} issued to the origin server to which the content has been posted, before it has been propagated to other servers. Removal of the content at this early stage would prevent further propagation, but with modern high speed links, content can be propagated as fast as it arrives, allowing no time for content review and takedown issuance by copyright holders.|$|R

40|$|Abstractâ€”The central {{question}} {{of this paper}} is: can we enhance the spectral purity of nonlinear circuits by using polyphase multipath circuits? The basic idea behind polyphase multipath circuits is to split the nonlinear circuits into two or more paths and exploit phase differences between these <b>paths</b> to <b>cancel</b> undesired distortion products. It turns {{out that it is}} very well possible to use polyphase multipath circuits to cancel distortion products produced by a nonlinear circuit. Unfortunately, there are also some spectral components that cannot be canceled with the polyphase multipath circuits...|$|R
50|$|The {{relation}} between ESME and SMSC is somehow a master-slave relation because SMSC is {{providing services to}} ESME, and usually ESME just uses these services from SMSC.One of {{the functions of the}} SMSC is to store and forward the messages while the ESME doesn't have this function. When a message is sent by an ESME to SMSC towards its destination, this message may stay in a SMSC queue until its destination will become available. During this time the ESME has the options to <b>cancel</b> the <b>message</b> in queue, to replace it or to check its status. ESME can also send a message to multiple destinations which will be handled by SMSC.|$|R
50|$|The {{stellarator}} {{was invented}} by Lyman Spitzer of Princeton University in 1951, and much of its early development {{was carried out by}} his team at what became the Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory (PPPL). The basic concept is to lay out the magnetic fields so that particles circulating around the long axis of the machine follow twisting <b>paths,</b> which <b>cancels</b> out instabilities seen in purely toroidal machines. This would keep the fuel confined long enough to allow it to be heated to the point where fusion would take place. Spitzer outlined an aggressive plan of four machines in series that would produce a commercial reactor in a short period.|$|R
50|$|Further {{signalling}} traffic reductions {{can occur}} by not sending acknowledgements. Typically, when a HLR instructs a subscriber purge (via a <b>Cancel</b> Location <b>message)</b> to a visiting network, the visiting network purges the subscriber information and sends an acknowledgment {{back to the}} HLR. The networks can further cut back on signalling traffic by not returning an acknowledgment, and just having the HLR assume the purge was completed. However, since Super-Charged visiting networks can purge subscriber data on their own due to periodic database cleanups, the visiting network register must identify whether the subscriber purge is externally instructed. If the purge is externally instructed, no acknowledgment is returned. If the purge is internally instructed, an acknowledgment {{is sent to the}} HLR.|$|R
5000|$|In late November, {{the band}} made an {{announcement}} on their MySpace and Facebook pages that their current tour was <b>canceled.</b> The <b>message</b> posted was: [...] "Due to {{a need for}} an emergency medical procedure within the band, The Latency {{will be forced to}} drop off the remainder of their Winter â€™09 tour." [...] No names were mentioned, but there were rumors that it involved Ryan Stead, the lead guitarist. In January 2010, it was reported that the reason was that the guitarist, Stead, had a heart infection and needed surgery. On January 7, 2010, Stead posted on his Facebook account that his heart infection had gone, and that he was very grateful for the fans' support during that time.|$|R
