40|$|This study {{investigates the}} main factors of production, their {{interaction}} and influence on cycle time efficiency for shovel-truck systems on surface mines. The main factors are truck payload, cycle time and operator proficiency. It is now routine that shoveltruck cycles are analysed using simulation methods. The Elbrond, FPC, Talpac, Arena and Machine Repair simulation models are discussed {{to explain how}} their model characteristics contribute to the differences in their reported cycle efficiency as indicated by productivity results. The Machine Repair Model based on Markov chains is adapted for shovel-truck systems and examined for calculating shovel-truck cycle times. The various probability distributions that can be use to model particular cycle time variables and some methods in selecting the “best” fit are examined. Truck cycle time variable sensitivity is examined by using the Excel® add-on program @Risk (Palisade Corp.) in determining their respective weighting or contribution within the total cycle time variability. The analysis of cycle efficiency leads ultimately to sizing of a shovel-truck system. When determining a fleet size for a particular surface operation the planning engineers will tend to use one {{and to a lesser}} extent perhaps two separate simulation models. This study calculates the <b>productivity</b> (<b>tonnes</b> per hour) for a “virtual mine” with a variable number of trucks, variable cycle distances and variable truck loading times. The study also includes a separate analysis of cycle time variables and their probability distributions for the Orapa diamond mine in Botswana, to show possible distributions for various cycle variables. The study concludes with a calculation of the truck fleet size using the Elbrond, FPC, Talpac and Arena and Machine Repair models for the Optimum Colliery coal mine and then compares the results and their correlation. The main findings are that the calculation of waiting time is different for the various models, each model yields a unique fleet sizing solution and any solution in effect represents a range of results...|$|R
40|$|Background: On a {{national}} level, South Africa’s freight logistics industry is inefficient. The country ranks 36 th out of 40 countries {{in terms of}} transport <b>productivity</b> (<b>tonne</b> kilometres as a ratio of gross domestic product, or GDP); the ratio of freight logistics costs to GDP measured 11. 1 % in 2013, {{compared to that of}} developed regions which measures in the order of 9 %; and rail tonne-km market share on the two most dense long-distance corridors, namely, GautengDurban and Gauteng-Cape Town, is only 12. 8 % and 4. 4 %, respectively, whereas rail is globally acknowledged as a more efficient provider of long-distance freight solutions, given appropriate investments and service commitments. Objectives: A cornerstone of improved national freight logistics performance is the availability of reliable indicators to quantify the efficiency and capacity of the logistics network over the intermediate and long term, thereby enabling an evidence-based policy and investment environment. The objective {{of this article is to}} describe the foundation framework (i. e. phase 1) for South Africa’s freight corridor performance measurement system (CPMS). Once populated, the CPMS will be a key generator of indicators to facilitate the systemic management of corridors as {{a national}} production factor and thereby contributing to South Africa’s competitiveness. Method: The design of South Africa’s CPMS was informed by desktop research and refined through an extensive stakeholder consultation process. A distinction was made between South Africa’s dedicated bulk corridors and the multi-modal corridors. Results: Facilitating both stakeholder involvement and agreement on key indicators, as well as the eventual development of a system supporting the population, aggregation and dissemination of the CPMS are critical outcomes for the management of corridors as a national production factor. Three overarching corridor indicators were defined, relating to increased throughput, lower costs and optimal modal application – the key rationale to improve the competitiveness of South African industry. This is supported by three corridor measurement perspectives, that is, a policy, customer service and infrastructure perspective. The purpose of the policy perspective is to support the role of national government in facilitating logistics competitiveness and equitable access through appropriate policy instruments. The customer service perspective should track service reliability and efficiency as contracted, at costs and cycle times that facilitate the competitiveness of the freight owner. The infrastructure perspective indicates whether sufficient capacity is provided, and whether this capacity is both available when required and utilised optimally. Conclusion: Elevation of logistics to the macroeconomic realm through the development of appropriate indicators will enable the management of logistics as a national production factor, thereby contributing to reducing national freight logistics costs and improving industry competitiveness. </p...|$|R
5|$|In 1980, the mine's {{production}} peaked with {{an export}} of 2.4million <b>tonnes</b> and 1,000 <b>employees.</b> In 1984, {{to improve the}} workplace environment, a used Allmänna Svenska Elektriska Aktiebolaget (ASEA)-built T45 locomotive was bought from Sweden. However, it suffered several breakdowns and was retired in 1989. As a replacement, a new G 1203 BB was bought from Maschinenbau Kiel and was delivered to Kirkenes on 8 February 1991. In 1988, {{the first part of}} the Kirkenes plant was closed, and the mining company drastically reduced production because its owner, the Ministry of Trade and Industry, would no longer subsidize operations. All mining ceased in the spring of 1996, and the last load of ore was hauled in April 1997. After operations closed, the oldest G12 was transferred to Sør-Varanger Museum.|$|R
5000|$|Coal mining {{employed}} 4,000 {{workers at}} 30 locations in 2013, extracting 13 million tonnes of coal. The three deep-pit mines were Hatfield and Kellingley Collieries in Yorkshire and Thoresby in Nottinghamshire. There were 26 opencast sites in 2014, mainly in Scotland. British coal mines achieve the most economically produced coal in Europe, {{with a level}} of <b>productivity</b> of 3,200 <b>tonnes</b> per man year. [...] Most coal is used for electricity generation and steel-making, but its use to heat homes has decreased because of pollution concerns. The commodity is also used for fertilisers, chemicals, plastics, medicines and road surfaces. Hatfield Colliery closed in June 2015, as did Thoresby, and in December 2015, Kellingley, bringing to an end deep coal mining in the UK. On 20 December, thousands of people turned out for a march in Yorkshire to mark the occasion. The march began in Knottingley and finished with a rally and party at Kellingley Miners Welfare club.|$|R
40|$|Images of a {{clean and}} green New Zealand {{environment}} are no longer enough to satisfy increasingly sophisticated customers that are demanding validation of environmental sustainability claims. This paper reports the findings of research that developed a detailed inventory of resource inputs for New Zealand merino wool and assessed its total energy use profile relative to other textiles. Total energy use was studied using LCA methodology. The system boundary included the production and use of all farm inputs, wool processing and shipping wool top to China. Total on-farm energy use average 890 MJ/ha and 230 MJ/stock unit (s. u.). Fuel and electricity accounted for 50 % of total farm energy use, fertiliser 36 %, purchased feed and agrichemicals 5 %, and capital 9 %. Total energy <b>productivity</b> per <b>tonne</b> of wool is very dependant upon the allocation methodology. Resource allocation was base on mass, being the only underlying physical property common to all economic farm outputs. Wool top landed in China consumes 48, 100 MJ/tonne dry top. An economic allocation model increases the energy footprint to 76, 575 MJ/tonne dry top. In the merino wool life cycle from farm to spinning mill in China on-farm inputs account for 52 % of total energy use, wool processing 45 % and transport is just 3 %. Results of this study show that New Zealand merino wool production consumes 42 % of the energy need to manufacture polyester, 30 % of acrylic and just 21 % of the energy need to manufacture nylon to the spun fibre stage. New Zealand merino fibre production and early stage processing uses significantly less energy than synthetic fibres...|$|R
40|$|<b>Productivity</b> (metric tons (<b>tonnes)</b> /day), {{efficiency}} (kg cane cut/litre Vo 2), {{and effort}} (percent Vo 2 max sustained during an 8 -hour workday) have been measured in 54 Colombian sugar cane cutters. In workers who sustained less than 40 % Vo 2 max during the workday, the effort expended {{was related to}} productivity (4 = 0 - 71) but efficiency and productivity were not significantly correlated. In 16 workers sustaining a greater than 40 % Vo 2 max during the workday, productivity and effort were not related and efficiency was significantly reduced. Subjects using less than 40 % Vo 2 max were divided into good, average and poor producers and compared with the men with low efficiencies. In general, these inefficient men had the anthropometric and physical fitness characteristics of low productivity workers (smaller stature, weight and Vo 2 max). However, the frequency of good, average, and poor cutters in the inefficient group {{did not differ from}} that of the men expending less than 40 % of their maximum effort nor was their average productivity different. No obvious reasons for the differences in efficiency and effort of these men were found...|$|R
40|$|There {{are three}} models of {{partnership}} {{in the development}} of smallholders plantation of palm oil in Center of Kalimantan Province, those are: (1) inti-plasma model that is managed by cooperative; (2) inti-plasma model that is managed by company; (3) inti-plasma model that is managed by individual farmers.   This research aims to find the best partnership model amongst them. This research has been done in Kotawaringin Barat District for the first and the third type of  models and in Katingan District for the second type. Collecting data and informations was done by Focus Group Discussion (FGD) and interviewed to the farmer respondents. A random sampling of 30 farmers was chosen for the first and the second models. For the second model, all of the farmers who follow the program as many as 20 farmers was chosen as this research respondent. The research found that the first type of those models is the best amongst of the partnership models because of following reasons: (1) highest <b>productivity,</b> about 20 <b>tonnes</b> FFB/ha/year; (2) highest farmer income about Rp 15, 682, 711 /ha/year; (3) business risks are shared by all of the cooperative members; (4) there is guarantee of the input supply and marketing of farming yied from company as a business partner; (5) farmers have some opportunities to increase their household income as company workers or through the other activities. This research recommends to the Government of  Kalimantan Tengah Province  to oblige the plantation companies to implement an inti-palsma partnership model that is managed by cooperative for whom obligation to develop about 20 % of their plantation area for smallholders...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} of this techno-economic analysis (TEA) was to define the production cost of the microalga Tetraselmis suecica in a 1 -ha plant made of “Green Wall Panel-II” (GWP®-II) photobioreactors. The study {{was based on an}} energy analysis carried out for a similar plant located in Tuscany (Italy) and considers the steps from inoculum preparation to the wet algal paste. Costs of equipment and materials were obtained from manufacturers and suppliers, while operating costs and output data (e. g. biomass composition and productivity) were collected during several years of trials at the Fotosintetica & Microbiologica S. r. l. facilities (Florence, Italy). Other data were obtained from Microalghe Camporosso S. r. l. (Imperia, Italy), where a commercial 1500 -m 2 GWP®-I plant is in operation and two 250 -m 2 GWP®-II modules were built and used in the framework of the EU project BIOFAT. This TEA shows that, given a <b>productivity</b> of 36 <b>tonnes</b> per hectare per year, T. suecica biomass can be produced at a cost of € 12. 4 kg− 1 (dry weight). Using conservative assumptions it was estimated that at the 100 -ha scale the cost will be € 5. 1 kg− 1. Locating the plant in more favorable climatic conditions (e. g. in Tunisia) will allow reaching 54 tonnes per hectare annually and reducing cost to € 6. 2 kg− 1 at the 1 -ha scale and to € 3. 2 kg− 1 at the 100 -ha scale. The major cost factors are labor at 1 -ha scale in Tuscany and capital expenses in all the other cases. This TEA confirms that microalgal technologies have high potential not only for high-value, but also for medium- and low-value products, while the production of biofuels, protein, food and feed seems currently out of reach. However, the global scenario of agriculture commodities is rapidly changing and other factors (e. g. sustainability), besides a pure economic evaluation, will assume greater importance in the future...|$|R
