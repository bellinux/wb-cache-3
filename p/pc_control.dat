2500|$|USS PC-552 was a Class 461 Patrol Craft ("PC") {{which was}} at the {{forefront}} of the naval efforts during the Normandy invasion. It served as convoy protection in the North Atlantic and, as one of about ten <b>PC</b> <b>control</b> vessels off [...] Omaha Beach during the Normandy invasion. PC-552 was among the first ships to reach waters off Omaha Beach. PC-552, primary control vessel for Fox Green sector of the beach, was forced into rescue efforts and recovery of bodies at the departure line for Fox Green when the Duplex Drive tanks that survived the initial disastrous launch were swamped at the line with only two surviving. The PC was diverted into this effort for forty-five minutes and ultimately only five tanks, the two that survived the launch disaster and three that were aboard LCT-600 whose commander raised his ramp when the first off foundered and instead landed them on the beach, reached the beach.|$|E

5000|$|The {{limitation}} {{of the amount of}} buttons compared to a PC keyboard or a custom arcade cabinet means that controller buttons will commonly perform multiple, different actions {{to make up for the}} lack of extra buttons.

5000|$|Despite Herzog Zwei, a console game, {{laying the}} {{foundations}} for the real-time strategy genre, RTS games never gained popularity on consoles like they did on the PC platform. Real-time strategy games made for video game consoles have been consistently criticized due to their control schemes, as the PC's keyboard and mouse are {{generally considered to be}} superior to a console's gamepad for the genre. Thus, RTS games for home consoles have been met with mixed success. Scott Sharkey of 1UP notes that Herzog Zwei had already [...] "offered a nearly perfect solution to the problem by giving the player direct control of a single powerful unit and near autonomy for everything else," [...] and is surprised [...] "that more console RTS games aren't designed with this kind of interface in mind from the ground up, rather than imitating" [...] <b>PC</b> <b>control</b> schemes [...] "that just doesn't work very well with a controller".|$|E

5000|$|At its launch, the 3270 PC {{used the}} 3270 <b>PC</b> <b>Control</b> Program as its {{operating}} system. PC DOS 2.0 (and later 2.1) could {{run as a}} task under the Control Program. Only one PC DOS task could be run at any given time, but in parallel with this, the Control Program could run up to four mainframe sessions. The Control Program also provided a basic windowing environment, with up to seven windows; besides the four mainframe and one DOS session, it also provided two notepads. The notepads {{could be used to}} copy text from the PC DOS session to the mainframe sessions but not vice versa. Given the small size of the character display, a review by PC Magazine concluded that the windowing features were hardly useful, and the notepads even less so. The Control Program was also described as a [...] "memory hog" [...] in this review, using about 200 KB of RAM in a typical configuration. More useful were the specialized PC DOS file transfer utilities that were available (called simply SEND and RECEIVE), which allowed files to be exchanged with the mainframe and provided ASCII/EBCDIC conversion. The list prices for the Control Program and file transfer utilities were $300 and $600, respectively. At the launch of the 3270 PC, the Control Program was the distinguishing software feature between a 3270 PC and an XT with an added 3278 board.|$|E
5000|$|Coordinating the {{activities}} of the various material handling sub-systems {{is the role of the}} warehouse control system (WCS). The WCS directs the [...] "real-time" [...] data management and interface responsibilities of the material handling system as well as provides common user interface screens for monitoring, control, and diagnostics. As the focal point for managing the operational aspects of the material handling system, the WCS provides the critical link between the non-real time based host and the real-time MHE control system. It receives information from the upper level Host and coordinates the various real-time control devices (conveyors, print and apply applicators, etc.) to accomplish the daily workload. At each decision point, the WCS determines the most efficient routing of the product and transmits directives to the equipment controllers to achieve the desired result.At the lowest level, closest to the physical equipment, are the equipment controller(s). These controllers are typically some form of a programmable logic controller (PLC) or a dedicated, real-time <b>PC</b> <b>control</b> system. They interface to peripheral Input/Output (I/O) devices such as photo-eyes scanners, motors, etc. as well as data collection devices such as bar code scanners (barcode reader) and weigh scales and are responsible for the physical operation of the material handling equipment. The equipment controllers are also responsible for the physical handling of product and tracking it from point-to-point based on the direction from the upper level control systems. Typically a single controller is only concerned with the operations of a defined area or sub-system of the overall material handling system.|$|E
