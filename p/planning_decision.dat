500|$|The {{locality}} {{where the}} interference occurred also influences {{whether or not}} it was unreasonable; in Sturges v Bridgman, Thesiger LJ wrote that [...] "what would be a nuisance in Belgrave Square [...] would not necessarily be so in Bermondsey [...] ". If an activity is out of place with the locality, it is likely to be held as unreasonable. However, the nature of areas can change over time; in Gillingham Borough Council v Medway (Chatham) Dock Co Ltd, it was held that the granting of planning permission to develop a commercial dock in an area changed that area's character, preventing the local residence from claiming in private nuisance for the disturbance the dock created. The granting of planning permission does not constitute immunity from a claim in nuisance, however; in Wheeler v Saunders Ltd. the Court of Appeal said that it would be [...] "a misuse of language to describe what has happened in the present case as a change in the character of the neighbourhood. It is a change of use of a very small piece of land... it is not a strategic <b>planning</b> <b>decision</b> affected by considerations of public interest. Unless one is prepared to accept that any <b>planning</b> <b>decision</b> authorises any nuisance which must inevitably come from it, the argument that the nuisance was authorised by planning permission in this case must fail". In situations where the defendant's activities cause physical damage, as in St Helen's Smelting Co v Tipping, the locality of the activities is not a factor in deciding their unreasonableness.|$|E

40|$|Tez (Doktora) [...] İstanbul Teknik Üniversitesi, Fen Bilimleri Enstitüsü, 2015 Çalışmada irdelenen temel problem şehir planlama kararlarının, stratejik kararların alındığı, belirli bir vizyon temelli üst ölçek plan kararlarından bağımsız olarak oluşturulduğu durumlarda; yörenin bütününü kapsamayan, noktasal değer artışlarının oluşmasıdır. Bu çerçevede çalışmada farklı özellikleri olan bölgelerdeki şehir planlama kararlarının ve bu kararların verildiği plan oluşum süreçlerinin kentsel mekanda arazi değer artışları üzerindeki etkilerinin gösterilmesi amaçlanmış olup İstanbul ilinden iki bölge örnek alan olarak belirlenmiştir. Tez kapsamında öncelikle dünya genelinde büyükkentlerin üst ölçek planlarının oluşum süreçleri incelenmiş ve plan değerlendirme kriterleri çerçevesinde İstanbul İli Çevre Düzeni Planı ile karşılaştırmalı analizi yapılarak İstanbul İli içinden çalışma konusu için uygunluk gösteren alanlar belirlenmiştir. Çalışma alanlarının belirlenmesinde esas alınan plan değerlendirme kriterleri; planın dışsal tutarlılığı ve planın etkileme derecesi olarak belirlenmiştir. Yapılan değerlendirme neticesinde çalışmada irdelenen problemin test edileceği örnek alanlar olarak nazım plan kararları etkisinde gelişen Beyoğlu İlçesi ile parsel bazında plan kararları etkisinde gelişen Şişli ilçeleri içinden altbölgeler seçilerek plan kararlarının arazi değer artışları üzerindeki etkileri incelenmiştir. Çalışmada uygulama görmüş olan plan kararlarını kapsayan dönem olan 2006 - 2010 yılları esas alınmış olup örnek alanlarda bu dönemdeki planlama süreçleri içerisindeki plan kararları, nitelikleri ve oluşum süreçleri bakımından sınıflanmış ve bu plan kararlarının mekansal dağılımları ortaya konmuştur. Ardından 2006 ve 2010 yılları için, çalışma alanı dahilinde, ele alınan planlama kararlarının verildiği alanlara bitişik parsellere cepheli sokak ve caddelere ilişkin birim m² arazi değerleri saptanmış ve bu değerlerin yine 2006 ve 2010 yılları için plan kararlarıyla karşılaştırmalı analizi yapılmıştır. Son olarak da her bir analiz alanının hem kendi içinde hem de birbirleriyle gruplandırma, korelasyon ve regresyon yöntemleri ile kıyaslanarak benzerlik ve farklılık gösteren özellikleri saptanmıştır. Elde edilen sonuçlar göstermektedir ki stratejik kararların alındığı, belirli bir vizyon temelli üst ölçek plan kararlarından bağımsız olarak verilmiş olan parsel bazında plan kararlarından içinde ticaret alanı olan ve emsal artışı öneren plan kararları, nazım plan kararlarından farklı olarak yüksek düzeyde ve noktasal arazi değer artışları oluşturmaktadır. Çalışmada plan kararlarının arazi değer artışları üzerindeki etkileri incelenirken 2006 - 2010 yılları arasındaki değişimler ve plan kararları dikkate alınmış olup çalışmanın yapıldığı örnek alanlarda 2010 yılı sonrasında da parsel bazında plan kararlarıyla kentsel mekanda uygulamalar devam etmektedir. Bu çalışmada elde edilen bulgular bundan sonra bu konuda yapılacak çalışmalara yön vermesi bakımından önem arz etmektedir. The {{main problem}} {{addressed}} {{in this study is}} that in such cases where urban <b>planning</b> <b>decisions</b> are constituted independently from the strategic upper-scale <b>plan</b> <b>decisions</b> which are based upon a specific vision, there take place local value increases which do not cover the whole area. Within this framework, it is aimed to put forth the effects of urban <b>planning</b> <b>decisions</b> in regions with different characteristics and the relevant planning processes where these decisions are taken on the land value increases in the urban space. To this aim, different methods were used so as to test the problem examined herein in line with the various assumptions and literature review was conducted for the theoretical framework. Establishment of the theoretical framework covers a general literature research for the already developed theories in this field and the previously conducted studies. Accordingly, the subjects designated as the main areas of interest of this study are as follows: rent-value concept, urban ground rent, land values, urban planning processes and economic value relations of the urban planning processes. Urban <b>planning</b> <b>decisions,</b> based on their nature, cause different effects on the land values and when functions change with zoning decisions, effects on the land values differentiate as well. In line with this assumption, land value increases which are connected with the urban <b>planning</b> <b>decisions</b> for different regions and with different functions were analyzed. Furthermore, lands which are located around the <b>plan</b> <b>decisions</b> proposing commercial activities bring about value increases. This finding is important to lay down the relation between the <b>plan</b> <b>decisions</b> suggesting commercial activities and the land values in the examined regions of the study. Among the social reinforcement areas, urban green space <b>plan</b> <b>decisions</b> create value increases for the surrounding lands and houses. Therefore, effects of the urban green spaces, which are proposed under the different plan formation processes, on the land value increases were analyzed and which characteristics of the green spaces are effective on the land values were determined. After the theoretical framework regarding economic value relation of the urban planning processes was specified; London, New York, Paris, Montreal and Lisbon were chosen among the large cities worldwide, their upper-scale formation processes were examined, plan success assessment was performed on the basis of certain assessment criteria and the elements which are pertaining to economic effects of the <b>planning</b> <b>decisions</b> on the urban space were designated. Plan assessment criteria were specified as internal coherence, external coherence, plan relevance to the city needs and ambitions, public participation, commitment of human and financial resources and plan effectiveness. Subsequently, plan success assessment of Istanbul Environmental Plan was performed based on the assessment criteria above and it was analyzed comparatively with upper-scale plans of the large cities worldwide. Plan assessment criteria which are important for the the case study are external coherence and plan effectiveness. As a result of the analysis, it is found that sub-scale planning and application activities which are generally conforming to the <b>plan</b> <b>decisions</b> were conducted for New York, London, Montreal and Paris plans whereas sub-scale planning and application activities which are partially conforming to the <b>plan</b> <b>decisions</b> were conducted for Lisbon plan. When Istanbul Environmental Plan was compared with the sub-scale <b>planning</b> <b>decisions</b> and applications, many applications were found out to be independent from the strategic objectives, policies and <b>planning</b> <b>decisions</b> of the upper-scale. The fact that Istanbul Environmental Plan includes strategic objectives and <b>planning</b> <b>decisions</b> which do not match up with the sub-scale <b>planning</b> <b>decisions</b> and applications especially in the central business district and in the north of the conventional central business district and that there are plans and applications independent from upper-scale plans due to plot-based <b>plan</b> <b>decisions</b> such as local zoning plans and plan amendments, etc. in these areas are among the issues that come forward regarding the problem {{addressed in this}} study. Within this framework, the areas which are suitable for this study were designated in Istanbul. Pursuant to the assessments, sub-regions were selected - as the sample areas where the problem herein will be tested - from Beyoglu district which has developed under the influence of master <b>plan</b> <b>decisions</b> and Sisli district which has developed under the influence of plot-based <b>plan</b> <b>decisions</b> and effects of the <b>plan</b> <b>decisions</b> on land value increases were examined. Years 2006 - 2010 which cover the applied <b>plan</b> <b>decisions</b> have been taken as basis in the study; <b>plan</b> <b>decisions</b> within the <b>planning</b> processes of the sample areas were classified in terms of their qualities and constitution processes and spatial distribution of these <b>plan</b> <b>decisions</b> were put forth. Subsequently, land values per square meter were established for the streets and avenues which face the plots adjoining to the areas for which the adressed <b>planning</b> <b>decisions</b> were taken between 2006 and 2010, and these values were analyzed again comparatively with the <b>plan</b> <b>decisions</b> of 2006 - 2010. Finally, each survey area was compared in itself and with one another through grouping, correlation and regression methods and similarities and differences were specified. Following the analysis results of street and avenue groups and according to the field visits in the sub-regions of Beyoglu district and the interviews held with real estate agents, there were determined different characteristics and applications effective on the land value increases, apart from the master <b>plan</b> <b>decisions.</b> Different characteristics of the area are that buildings which face the streets and avenues are new and well-kept; there are no worn-out and unused buildings; streets and avenues are more favorable in terms of topography and slope and the region is preferable due to social environment and security issues. Morever, some applications carried out by the local municipality in the region are the efective factors apart from the <b>plan</b> <b>decisions.</b> These applications of the local municipality include the street landscaping and facade arrangements as well as the works performed at the entrances/exits of the subways for transportation. Besides, pursuant to the analysis, it is understood that land value increase rates of the streets and avenues which are located in the sub-regions of Beyoglu district and remain under the influence of master <b>plan</b> <b>decisions</b> are close to the general average and exhibit a homogenous distribution while land value increase rates of the streets and avenues which are located in the sub-regions of Sisli district and remain under the influence of plot-based <b>plan</b> <b>decisions</b> have great differences.
