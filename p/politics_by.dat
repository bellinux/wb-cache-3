5|$|According to {{historian}} George H. Haynes, {{during his}} nearly {{thirty years of}} public service Wilson practiced principled <b>politics</b> <b>by</b> championing unpopular causes, sometimes {{at the expense of}} his personal ambition. The causes Wilson supported included abolition of slavery, and the rights of workers, both black and white.|$|E
5|$|After being urged into <b>politics</b> <b>by</b> his uncle, Judge Roscoe Tartar, Cooper ran unopposed {{for a seat}} in the Kentucky House of Representatives as a Republican in 1927. As {{a member}} of the House, he was one of only three Republicans to oppose Republican Governor Flem D. Sampson's {{unsuccessful}} attempt to politicize the state department of health; the measure failed by a single vote. Cooper supported the governor's plan to provide free textbooks for the state's school children and sponsored legislation to prohibit judges from issuing injunctions to end labor strikes, although the latter bill did not pass.|$|E

In her second year at the university, Gillard was introduced to <b>politics</b> <b>by</b> the daughter of a State Labor Minister. Accordingly, she joined the Labor Club and became involved in a campaign to fight federal education budget cuts. Gillard cut short her courses in 1982, and moved to Melbourne to work with the Australian Union of Students.|$|E
5|$|In his {{comprehensive}} study, Soviet Military Deception in the Second World War, Glantz {{summarized the}} Russian doctrine as involving both active and passive deception and surprise. For the Soviets, deception permeated {{all levels of}} war. And since they thought of war as just an extension of <b>politics</b> <b>by</b> other means, deception could and should be used and constantly considered in politics before a war began, if it was to work effectively.|$|E
5|$|Opinions of Hamilton {{have run}} the gamut: both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson viewed him as unprincipled and dangerously aristocratic. Hamilton's {{reputation}} was mostly negative in the eras of Jeffersonian democracy and Jacksonian democracy. By the Progressive era, Herbert Croly, Henry Cabot Lodge, and Theodore Roosevelt praised his leadership {{of a strong}} government. Several nineteenth- and twentieth-century Republicans entered <b>politics</b> <b>by</b> writing laudatory biographies of Hamilton.|$|E

5|$|A flashforward {{occurs in}} the narration, to find Daniel's ship under attack by the fleet of Edward Teach (Blackbeard) in 1713. Then the story returns to the past as Daniel and Newton return to London: Newton is under the {{patronage}} of Louis Anglesey, the Earl of Upnor, and Daniel becomes secretary of the Royal Society when Henry Oldenburg is detained by the King for his active foreign correspondence. During his stint in London, Daniel encounters {{a number of important}} actors from the period. Daniel remains one of the more prominent actors in the Royal Society, close to Royal Society members involved in court life and <b>politics.</b> <b>By</b> 1672 both Daniel and Newton become fellows at Trinity College where they build an extensive alchemical laboratory which attracts other significant alchemists including John Locke and Robert Boyle. Daniel convinces Newton to present his work on calculus to the Royal Society.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} his gubernatorial term, Isaac Shelby {{retired from}} public life but he was called back into <b>politics</b> <b>by</b> the {{impending}} War of 1812. Kentuckians urged Shelby to run for governor again and lead them through the anticipated conflict. He was elected easily, and at the request of General William Henry Harrison, commanded troops from Kentucky at the Battle of the Thames. After the war, he declined President James Monroe's offer to become Secretary of War. In his last act of public service, Shelby and Andrew Jackson acted as commissioners to negotiate the Jackson Purchase from the Chickasaw Indian tribe. Isaac Shelby died, at his estate in Lincoln County, Kentucky, on July 18, 1826.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{focused his}} {{attention}} on Indians while in South Africa. He {{was not interested in}} politics. This changed after he was discriminated against and bullied, such as by being thrown out of a train coach because of his skin colour by a white train official. After several such incidents with Whites in South Africa, Gandhi's thinking and focus changed, he felt he must resist this and fight for rights. He entered <b>politics</b> <b>by</b> forming Natal Indian Congress. According to Ashwin Desai and Goolam Vahed, Gandhi's views on racism are contentious, in some cases distressing to those who admire him. Gandhi suffered persecution from the beginning in South Africa. Like with other coloured people, white officials denied him his rights, the press and those in the streets bullied and called him a parasite, semi-barbarous, canker, squalid coolie, yellow man, and other epithets. People would spit on him as an expression of racial hate.|$|E

5|$|In January 1960 Heffron {{provided}} his {{old friend}} H. V. Evatt a dignified exit from federal <b>politics</b> <b>by</b> nominating him to succeed Sir Kenneth Street as Chief Justice of New South Wales. His Attorney General Reg Downing, however, was horrified, having favoured the senior puisne justice Sir William Owen as the most suitable candidate while also realising that Evatt's worsening health would render him less than equal {{to the task of}} chief justice. Therefore, while Downing, as attorney general, would normally be the person to move the nomination of chief justice in cabinet, he refused to do so, leaving Heffron to do it himself. Heffron's motion to nominate Evatt was passed narrowly by 8 votes to 6. Downing's concerns would come to pass as Evatt indeed proved highly ineffective, often wracked by mental and physical ill-health, was reduced to having most of his judgements written or co-written for him, and resigning in 1962 after only two years as chief justice.|$|E
5|$|James Patrick McGovern {{was born}} in Worcester, Massachusetts on November 20, 1959. He grew up in Worcester, where his mother Mindy was a dance {{instructor}} and his father Walter owned a liquor store. In junior high school, he first became involved in <b>politics</b> <b>by</b> campaigning for Democratic U.S. Senator George McGovern (to whom he is not related) in his unsuccessful 1972 presidential bid. After graduating from Worcester Academy he moved to Washington, D.C., where from 1977 to 1980, he worked as an aide to George McGovern. He attended American University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts in history in 1981 and a Masters of Public Administration in 1984. George McGovern ran for president again in 1984, Jim McGovern was the state coordinator of his Massachusetts campaign branch, and he made his nominating speech at the 1984 Democratic National Convention.|$|E
5|$|Riel's {{execution}} and Macdonald's refusal to commute his sentence caused lasting discord in Quebec, {{and led to}} a fundamental alteration in the Canadian political order. In Quebec, Honoré Mercier exploited the discontent to reconstitute the Parti National. This party, which promoted Quebec nationalism, won a majority in the 1886 Quebec election by winning a number of seats formerly controlled by the Quebec Conservative Party. The federal election of 1887 likewise saw significant gains by the federal Liberals, again {{at the expense of the}} Conservatives. This led to the victory of the Liberal party under Sir Wilfrid Laurier in the federal election of 1896, which in turn set the stage for the domination of Canadian federal <b>politics</b> <b>by</b> the Liberal party in the 20th century.|$|E

5|$|Though the League for Social Reconstruction {{began as}} more of a {{discussion}} group than a political party, it became a force in Canadian <b>politics</b> <b>by</b> the mid-1930s. After Havelock joined the Co-operative Commonwealth Federation, along with several other members of the League, he was pressured by his superiors at the University to curtail his political activity. He did not, continuing to act as an ally and occasional spokesman for Underhill and other leftist professors. He found himself in trouble again in 1937 after criticising both the government's and industry's handling of an automotive workers' strike. Despite calls from Ontario officials for his ouster, he was able to remain at Victoria College, but his public reputation was badly damaged.|$|E
5|$|Tillman {{raised his}} profile in state <b>politics</b> <b>by</b> {{attending}} the 1876 state Democratic convention, which nominated Hampton as the party's candidate for governor. While Hampton presented a fatherly image, urging support from South Carolinians, black and white, Tillman led fifty men to Ellenton, intending to join over one thousand rifle club members who slaughtered thirty militiamen, with the survivors saved {{only by the}} arrival of federal authorities. Although Tillman and his men arrived too late to participate in those killings, two of his men murdered Simon Coker, a black state senator who had come to investigate reports of violence. They shot him as he knelt in final prayer.|$|E
5|$|A major crisis {{gripped the}} ACLU in 1968 when a debate erupted {{over whether to}} defend Benjamin Spock and the Boston Five against federal charges that they {{encouraged}} draftees to avoid the draft. The ACLU board was deeply split over whether to defend the activists; half the board harbored anti-war sentiments, and felt that the ACLU should lend its resources {{to the cause of}} the Boston Five. The other half of the board believed that civil liberties were not at stake, and the ACLU would be taking a political stance. Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial, and provided legal advice without regard to the political views of the defendants. The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted the ACLU to defend the anti-war activists, without endorsing the activist's political views. Some critics of the ACLU suggest that the ACLU became a partisan political organization following the Spock case. After the Kent State shootings in 1970, ACLU leaders took another step towards <b>politics</b> <b>by</b> passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam War. The resolution was based in a variety of legal arguments, including civil liberties violations and a claim that the war was illegal.|$|E

5|$|Beshear's initial rise to {{political}} prominence was interrupted in 1987 {{when he finished}} third in a five-candidate Democratic gubernatorial primary election. The Beshear campaign's sparring with that of former Governor Brown, the second-place finisher in the primary, {{opened the door for}} political novice Wallace Wilkinson's well-financed campaign to achieve a come-from-behind upset in the race. For the next 20 years, Beshear practiced law at a Lexington law firm. His only foray into politics during this period was an unsuccessful challenge to Senator Mitch McConnell in 1996. In 2007, however, Beshear was drawn back into <b>politics</b> <b>by</b> the vulnerability of incumbent Republican Governor Ernie Fletcher, whose administration was under extended investigation by then-Attorney General Greg Stumbo, over violations of the state's merit system. In the 2007 gubernatorial election, Beshear emerged from a six-candidate Democratic primary – largely on the strength of his pledge to expand casino gambling as a means of further funding social programs like education – and defeated Fletcher in the general election. Beshear won re-election in 2011, defeating Republican David L. Williams and Independent Gatewood Galbraith. He was ineligible for re-election in 2015 due to term limits imposed by the Kentucky Constitution.|$|E
