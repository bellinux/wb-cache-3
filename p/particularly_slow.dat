Both {{missions}} were hampered by storms {{that made the}} going <b>particularly</b> <b>slow,</b> but were otherwise uneventful. Still, confidence in the wisdom of using battleships as an escort was fading at the Admiralty, and Admiral Beatty in particular was opposed to it. When the American ships returned to the new Grand Fleet base at Rosyth {{at the end of}} the second mission on 20 April, it was the last time they were used to escort the Scandinavian Convoy.|$|E
5|$|The {{drive to}} capture wildlife, and <b>particularly</b> <b>slow</b> lorises, is {{increasingly}} dominated by demands from wealthy urban areas, replacing the subsistence hunting traditionally performed in poor rural areas. In {{the case of}} long-lived primates, such as the slow lorises, populations replenish themselves slowly. Slow lorises are particularly vulnerable {{because they tend to}} freeze when spotted. Lastly, increased access to new technologies, such as improved transport, guns, wire snares, and spotlights, have facilitated hunting and pushed extraction levels beyond the point of sustainability. These new factors threaten slow loris survival.|$|E

25|$|Movements over 30 {{kilometers}} (daily horse travel limit) were <b>particularly</b> <b>slow</b> and complex. Longer hauls were {{relegated to}} trucks at first opportunity, while horses persisted at divisional level and in auxiliary units. Horse transports were particularly inadequate in deep offensive operations, {{just like they}} were in 1914. American trucks supplied to the Soviets allowed operations up to 350 kilometers away from the railhead, a distance impossible for horse-drawn sleighs. Likewise, replacement of field artillery horses with jeeps allowed towing 120-mm mortars in line with advancing troops, another tactic not possible with horses.|$|E
25|$|The first match had led {{to media}} consternation about the {{appropriateness}} of India's batting strategy. Rahul Dravid had been promoted up the batting order from number three to open along with Wasim Jaffer, while regular opener Dinesh Karthik was dropped prior to the first Test. This was done to create a middle-order vacancy for Yuvraj Singh, who had scored a century in India's previous Test, when he substituted for the injured Sachin Tendulkar. During the first Test, both Dravid and Jaffer failed to pass 20 in either innings, with the former attracting attention for his <b>particularly</b> <b>slow</b> and defensive approach. This allowed the Australian bowling to assert control over the Indian batsmen from the outset and prevent them from gaining the momentum at the outset. Yuvraj also failed; he was particularly fidgety in scoring 0 and 5. The failures of the rearranged line-up prompted calls {{for the return of}} Virender Sehwag, who had been taken on tour as the reserve opener. Sehwag had been dropped from the side in early-2007 and had been unproductive in recent Ranji Trophy matches in India; however, his extremely aggressive approach had been successful against Australia in the past and cricket pundits felt that he could counter-attack the Australian bowlers, rather than letting their new ball attack seize the initiative. Jaffer, Dravid and Yuvraj were all mooted as possible omissions to make way for Sehwag.|$|E

2500|$|Equilibrium {{thermodynamic}} calculations {{predict that}} As(V) concentrations should {{be greater than}} As(III) concentrations in all but strongly reducing conditions, i.e. where SO42− reduction is occurring. [...] However, abiotic redox reactions of arsenic are slow. Oxidation of As(III) by dissolved O2 is a <b>particularly</b> <b>slow</b> reaction. For example, Johnson and Pilson (1975) gave half-lives for the oxygenation of As(III) in seawater ranging from several months to a year. In other studies, As(V)/As(III) ratios were stable over periods of days or weeks during water sampling when no particular care was taken to prevent oxidation, again suggesting relatively slow oxidation rates. Cherry found from experimental studies that the As(V)/As(III) ratios were stable in anoxic solutions for up to 3 weeks but that gradual changes occurred over longer timescales. Sterile water samples have been observed to be less susceptible to speciation changes than non-sterile samples. Oremland found that the reduction of As(V) to As(III) in Mono Lake was rapidly catalyzed by bacteria with rate constants ranging from 0.02 to 0.3 day−1.|$|E
50|$|There {{are also}} {{negative}} aspects of narrow head gaps, particularly for magnetic recording. The narrower the head gap, the more bias signal must be used to maintain linearity of the signal on tape which in turn will reduce the high frequency headroom or SOL (Saturated Output Level), <b>particularly</b> with <b>slower</b> tape speeds. Manufacturers must find a compromise between intended tape speeds and head gaps for this reason.|$|R

40|$|International audienceEukaryotic {{ribosome}} biogenesis {{requires the}} function {{of a large number}} of trans-acting factors which interact transiently with the nascent pre-rRNA and dissociate as the ribosomal subunits proceed to maturation and export to the cytoplasm. Loss-of-function mutations in human trans-acting factors or ribosome components may lead to genetic syndromes. In a previous study, we have shown association between the SBDS (Shwachman-Bodian-Diamond syndrome) and NIP 7 proteins and that downregulation of SBDS in HEK 293 affects gene expression at the transcriptional and translational levels. In this study, we show that downregulation of NIP 7 affects pre-rRNA processing, causing an imbalance of the 40 S/ 60 S subunit ratio. We also identified defects at the pre-rRNA processing level with a decrease of the 34 S pre-rRNA concentration and an increase of the 26 S and 21 S pre-rRNA concentrations, indicating that processing at site 2 is <b>particularly</b> <b>slower</b> in NIP 7 -depleted cells and showing that NIP 7 is required for maturation of the 18 S rRNA. The NIP 7 protein is restricted to the nuclear compartment and co-sediments with complexes with molecular masses in the range of 40 S- 80 S, suggesting an association to nucleolar pre-ribosomal particles. Downregulation of NIP 7 affects cell proliferation, consistently with an important role for NIP 7 in rRNA biosynthesis in human cells...|$|R
