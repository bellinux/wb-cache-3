50|$|Previously, this {{hornbill}} {{was placed}} in the genus Aceros. It has often been lumped with the <b>plain-pouched</b> <b>hornbill</b> (R. subruficollis), and sometimes considered to include the Narcondam hornbill (R. narcondami) and the wreathed hornbill (R. undulatus) as subspecies.|$|E
50|$|The <b>plain-pouched</b> <b>{{hornbill}}</b> (Rhyticeros subruficollis) is {{a species}} of hornbill in the family Bucerotidae. It is found in forests of the Dawna Range and the Tenasserim Hills of southern Myanmar, adjacent parts of western Thailand and northern Peninsular Malaysia.|$|E
50|$|The Dawna Range {{provides}} a habitat for the tiger, the wild Asian elephant and Fea's muntjak. Endangered {{species in the}} area are the <b>plain-pouched</b> <b>hornbill</b> and Gurney's pitta. There are other rare species some of which have only recently been discovered.|$|E
40|$|The Ulu Muda Forest Reserve {{plays an}} {{important}} role as a water catchment area that supplies fresh water for domestic, industrial and agriculture sectors of the northern part of Peninsular Malaysiafor the states of Kedah, Penang and Perlis. The largest rice growing state Kedah, it also known as "Rice Bowl" of Malaysia, is heavily dependant on the fresh water sourced from Ulu Muda Forest Reserve. Other than supply of fresh water,the forest is also rich is biodiversity, and has many rare species such as the globally-threatened <b>plain-pouch</b> <b>hornbill,</b> elephants, tapir and dipterocarp species (high economic value timber). There also the number of saltlicks which have high tourism related potentials. In 2002,the state government of Kedah granted in principle a timber harvesting project 122, 798 ha of forests to be logged by the privatesector via helicopter-logging method. However, the project was stalled after strong lobbying from the friend of Ulu Muda (FoUM), a coalition of non-governmental organizations (NGOs) and community based organizations,as well as well rejection of detailed environmental Impact Assesment by the Department of Environmental, which is under the purview of the Ministry of Natural Resources and the Environment. In 2008,FoUM II was reintiated when the logging project was again being proposed by the current Kedah state government. FoUM II has made their stand strong and firm and has come out with several suggestions to prevent the forest from being logged. This article examines the importance and treats of Ulu Muda Foreat Reserve, the role of FoUM in protecting Ulu Muda Forest Reserve and recommendations to protect Ulu Muda Forest Reserve (UMFR) ...|$|R
50|$|All species {{generally}} {{placed in}} Rhyticeros have relatively low, conspicuously wreathed casques and a mainly dull whitish horn-colored bill. Both sexes have mainly black plumage, but {{the head and}} neck of the males are white or rufous. The tail is white except in the black-tailed Sumba hornbill. They have conspicuous inflatable skin on the throat, which is blue in all except the males of the <b>plain-pouched</b> and wreathed <b>hornbills,</b> where it is yellow.|$|R
50|$|Belum Temenggor {{is home to}} over 300 avian species. It is {{the only}} {{existing}} forest where all 10 species of hornbill that inhabit Malaysia are found, namely the white-crowned hornbill, bushy-crested hornbill, wrinkled hornbill, wreathed hornbill, <b>plain-pouched</b> <b>hornbill,</b> black hornbill, Oriental pied hornbill, rhinoceros hornbill, great hornbill and helmeted hornbill. In the forest {{you can also find}} 3,000 species of flowering plants, including 3 species of Rafflesia, the world's largest flower.|$|E
50|$|The main {{purposes}} of the reserve are habitat conservation of both marine and island resources. 228 species of birds including 19 threatened species such as <b>plain-pouched</b> <b>hornbill</b> and Wallace's hawk-eagle, 10 species of amphibians and 19 species reptile with 3 species of endangered sea turtles (green, loggerhead and olive ridley), 19 species of mammals including sunda pangolin are present. The typical habitats are coral reefs, tropical evergreen forest and mangroves. There are also beach and dune habitats, as well as sea grass beds which feed the dugongs. Whales and dolphins are also migrant to the waters.|$|E
50|$|The wreathed {{hornbill}} (Rhyticeros undulatus), {{also known}} as the bar-pouched wreathed hornbill, is a species of hornbill found in forests from far north-eastern India and Bhutan, east and south through mainland Southeast Asia and the Greater Sundas in Indonesia, except Sulawesi. It is 75 - 100 cm long. Males weigh from 1.8 kg to 3.65 kg, and females weigh from 1.36 kg to 2.7 kg. Both sexes are similar to the respective sexes of the closely related <b>plain-pouched</b> <b>hornbill,</b> but the wreathed hornbill can be recognized by the dark bar on the lower throat (hence the alternative common name, bar-pouched). Though commonly considered monotypic, evidence suggests some geographical variation in the appearance.|$|E
50|$|None of the African {{species of}} {{hornbills}} are seriously threatened, but many Asian hornbills {{are threatened by}} hunting and habitat loss, as they tend to require primary forest. Among these threatened species, only the <b>plain-pouched</b> <b>hornbill</b> and rufous-necked hornbill are found on the Asian mainland; all others are insular in their distribution. In the Philippines alone, one species (the Palawan hornbill) is vulnerable, and two species (the Mindoro and Visayan hornbills) are endangered. The only critically endangered hornbills, the rufous-headed hornbill and the Sulu hornbill, are also restricted to the Philippines. The latter species {{is one of the}} world's rarest birds, with only 20 breeding pairs or 40 mature individuals, and faces imminent extinction. The Ticao hornbill, a subspecies of the Visayan hornbill, is probably already extinct.|$|E
40|$|AbstractMalaysia and Thailand share {{a common}} border {{stretching}} from Perlis, Kedah, Perak and Kelantan in Malaysia; and Satun, Songkhla, Yala and Narathiwat in Thailand. Malaysia's Belum-Temengor Forest Complex (BTFC) and Ulu Muda Forest Reserve are well within Thailand's Sungalakiri NP (National Park), Nam Tok Than To FP (Forest Park), Banglang NP, Bang Lang Reservoir, Si-Po Waterfall NP and Khao Luang NP (THAI-NPs). This paper intends to study the tourism potential of hornbill migration between BTFC in Northern Perak, Peninsular Malaysia and the enclave of THAI-NPs. BTFC is the only forest complex in Malaysia with 10 species of hornbill in the world. <b>Plain-pouched</b> <b>Hornbill</b> (Aceros subruficollis) is the fascinating species of hornbill that seasonally migrate daily in large numbers. An ongoing study by Malaysian Nature Society (MNS) on the migrating, roosting and feeding sites of the <b>Plain-pouched</b> <b>Hornbill</b> (PPHB) is in progress. There is no record of large daily migrating PPHB anywhere else known in the world. Preliminary observations indicate {{there is a possibility}} for PPHB crossing into Thailand from BTFC. This made it an important tourist attraction and a natural phenomenon worth conserving and perhaps promoting as wildlife cross border migration tourism. The methods include researching data from various sources and interviews. Results showed that the sheer large numbers of PPHB {{has been one of the}} attractions for bird watching and tourists visiting BTFC. Promoting this phenomenon will helps prevent the lost of the natural habitats sharing the same common border that support this PPHB. This study could promote the hornbill migration tourism with the indirect biodiversity conservation of our common border...|$|E
