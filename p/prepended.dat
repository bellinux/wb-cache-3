40|$|This article {{considers}} the AS path <b>prepending</b> approach to engineer inbound traffic for multihomed ASs. The AS path <b>prepending</b> approach artificially inflates {{the length of}} the AS path attribute on one of the links in hopes of diverting some of the traffic to other links. Unlike the current practice that determines the <b>prepending</b> length in a trial-and-error way, we propose AutoPrepend, a systematic and automated procedure for conducting <b>prepending.</b> The entire process consists of four components: passive measurement, active measurement, traffic change prediction, and AS path update. The main idea is to predict the traffic change due to a new <b>prepending</b> value before effecting the change. We have also employed a number of mechanisms to minimize intrusion into the normal operation of the Internet. We have deployed AutoPrepend on a noncommercial site and evaluated its effectiveness based on the measurements collected over six months. Department of Computin...|$|R
