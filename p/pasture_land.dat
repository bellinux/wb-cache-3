5|$|The islanders' {{livelihood}} {{was based}} on fishing (for white fish, herring and lobster), crofting (with up to 55 ha (0.21 sq mi) of arable and <b>pasture</b> <b>land</b> fertilised by wrack on which sheep, cattle, ponies, pigs and poultry were kept) and very dependent on the bounty provided by seabirds. For example, rent was payable to The MacNeil in fachaich or ‘fatlings’ - shearwater chicks.|$|E
5|$|A {{significant}} {{exception to}} the above are the fossil-bearing beds of Old Red Sandstones found principally along the Moray Firth coast. The Highlands are generally mountainous and the highest elevations in the British Isles are found here. Scotland has over 790 islands divided into four main groups: Shetland, Orkney, and the Inner Hebrides and Outer Hebrides. There are numerous bodies of freshwater including Loch Lomond and Loch Ness. Some parts of the coastline consist of machair, a low lying dune <b>pasture</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
5|$|Below {{the tree}} line there are several zones of climax forest. Birch dominates {{to the west and}} north, Scots Pine with Birch and oak in the eastern Highlands and oak (both Quercus robur and Q. petrea) with Birch in the Central Lowlands and Borders. Much of the Scottish {{coastline}} consists of machair, a fertile dune <b>pasture</b> <b>land</b> formed as sea levels subsided after the last ice age. Machairs have received considerable ecological and conservational attention, chiefly because of their unique ecosystems.|$|E

The brook extends west for a mile (about 1.6km) before joining the Thames River.|$|E
5|$|Over {{the last}} twelve {{thousand}} years {{the most significant}} new geological features have been the deposits of peat {{and the development of}} coastal alluvium. Post-glacial rises in sea level have been combined with isostatic rises of the land resulting in a relative fall in sea level in most areas. In some places, such as Culbin in Moray, these changes in relative sea level have created a complex series of shorelines. A rare type of Scottish coastline found largely in the Hebrides consists of machair habitat, a low lying dune <b>pasture</b> <b>land</b> formed as the sea level dropped leaving a raised beach. In the present day, Scotland continues to move slowly north.|$|E

5|$|The Church in England {{was a major}} {{landowner}} {{throughout the}} medieval period and played {{an important part in}} the development of agriculture and rural trade in the first two centuries of Norman rule. The Cistercian order first arrived in England in 1128, establishing around 80 new monastic houses over the next few years; the wealthy Augustinians also established themselves and expanded to occupy around 150 houses, all supported by agricultural estates, many of them in the north of England. By the 13th century these and other orders were acquiring new lands and had become major economic players both as landowners and as middlemen in the expanding wool trade. In particular, the Cistercians led the development of the grange system. Granges were separate manors in which the fields were all cultivated by the monastic officials, rather than being divided up between demesne and rented fields, and became known for trialling new agricultural techniques during the period. Elsewhere, many monasteries had significant economic impact on the landscape, such as the monks of Glastonbury, responsible for the draining of the Somerset Levels to create new <b>pasture</b> <b>land.</b>|$|E
