In uniaxial pressing the specimens were compacted up to a pressure of 800 MPa. Cold isostatic pressing (CIP) resulted in better densification {{for both of}} the studied powder materials.

The pressing tools can be made of two parts (for seats, backrests and shells) or several parts, e.g. for U-shaped moldings that also require pressure from the side.

50|$|In {{the tablet}} <b>pressing</b> <b>process,</b> the main {{guideline}} {{is to ensure}} that the appropriate amount of active ingredient is in each tablet. Hence, all the ingredients should be well-mixed. If a sufficiently homogenous mix of the components cannot be obtained with simple blending processes, the ingredients must be granulated prior to compression to assure an even distribution of the active compound in the final tablet. Two basic techniques are used to granulate powders for compression into a tablet: wet granulation and dry granulation. Powders that can be mixed well do not require granulation and can be compressed into tablets through direct compression.|$|E

The One Step vinyl album uses the original lacquer to create the Father or Master stamper. Typically most vinyl records are made with the Three Step process whereby Father, Mother and Stampers are all created from one lacquer, hence three steps from the original. The One step process is one step from the original lacquer and therefore closer to the master tape/tracks. The Moonlight Sessions Volumes One and Two were recorded in February 2017 by Al Schmitt and Steve Genewick. Mixing Engineer was Michael Bishop of Five/Four Productions and the album was mastered by Bernie Grundman of Bernie Grundman Mastering. The musicians on this project include pianists Mike Garson, Christian Jacob and Tamir Hendelman; bassist Chuck Berghofer; guitar by John Chiodini; drummers include Joe La Barbara, Bernie Dresel, and Ray Brinker.

40|$|POLYFLOW is an {{advanced}} general purpose finite-element-based CFD software product {{for the analysis}} of polymer processing and particularly well-known for its extensive library of viscoelastic fluid models. These numerical capabilities of POLYFLOW software translate into substantial cost reduction and time savings. POLYFLOW offers a wealth of advanced features, such as complex rheological models (including the widest suite of viscoelastic models in commercial CFD software), very large free surface deformations (using the arbitrary Lagrange Eulerian (ALE) technique), contact detection, native fluid-structure interaction (FSI), and a unique remeshing as well as adaptive meshing technique to accommodate the development of new mesh formation due to the occurred large deformation. In the current application, two applications for the problem solution of semiconductor industries are presented, namely Wafer Level Packaging (WLP) and Paste Flow to study some behavior of compound materials under compression or <b>pressing</b> <b>processes.</b> The advantages of employing POLYFLOW for WLP and Paste Flow processes to investigate current semiconductor design are to specify the loading speed of upper mold when pressing the compound to form the specific shape according to their design, to understand the behavior of compound during the <b>pressing</b> <b>processes</b> so that the spread out of compound can be detected and found out better using POLYFLOW, to define the microchip position for obtaining its better arrangement so that every compound material can fill up the gaps perfectly, to determine the volume of the compound required to achieve optimal usage as well as gaining the output parameters generated from running POLYFLOW analysis, such as pressure contours, local shear rate, velocity. In short, POLYFLOW is beneficial to be employed for current semiconductor applications due to its powerful capabilities in modeling compressing modeling with large viscosity, large deformation, transient analysis, complex geometry and contact surface...|$|R
