40|$|Four {{different}} types of nanocomposite reverse osmosis (RO) membranes were formed by interfacial polymerization of either polyamide (PA) or zeolite A-polyamide nanocomposite (ZA-PA) thin films over either pure polysulfone (PSf) or zeolite A-polysulfone nanocomposite (ZA-PSf) support membranes cast by wet phase inversion. All three nanocomposite membranes exhibited superior separation performance and interfacial properties relative to hand-cast TFC analogs including: (1) smoother, more hydrophilic surfaces (2) higher water permeability and salt rejection, and (3) improved resistance to physical compaction. Less compaction occurred for membranes with nanoparticles embedded in interfacially <b>polymerized</b> <b>coating</b> films, which adds further proof that flux decline associated with physical compaction is influenced by coating film properties in addition to support membrane properties.

The BBSome is the major effector of the Arf-like GTPase Arl 6 /BBS 3, and the BBSome and GTP-bound Arl 6 colocalize at ciliary punctae in an interdependent manner. Strikingly, Arl 6 GTP-mediated recruitment of the BBSome to synthetic liposomes produces distinct patches of <b>polymerized</b> <b>coat</b> apposed onto the lipid bilayer. Finally, the ciliary targeting signal of somatostatin receptor 3 needs to be directly recognized by the BBSome in order to mediate targeting of membrane proteins to cilia.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Program in Materials Science and Engineering, Washington State UniversityAtmospheric {{pressure}} plasmas {{have gained}} considerable interest from researchers recently for their unique prospective of engineering surfaces with plasma {{without the need}} of vacuum systems. They offer the advantage of low energy consumption, minimal capital cost and their simplicity as compared to conventional low pressure plasmas make them easy to upscale from laboratory to industry size. The present dissertation summarizes results of our attempt at applying atmospheric pressure weakly ionized plasma (APWIP) to the engineering of plastic composites filled with cellulose based substrates. An APWIP reactor was designed and built based on a multipoint-to-grounded ring and screen configurations. The carrier gas was argon and acetylene serves as the precursor molecule. The APWIP reactors showed capability of depositing plasma <b>polymerized</b> <b>coating</b> rich in carbon on substrates positioned within the electrode gap as well as downstream of the plasma discharge into the afterglow region. Our findings show that films grow by forming islands which for prolonged deposition time grow into thin films showing nodules, aggregates of nodules and microspheres. They also show chemical structure similar to films deposited from hydrocarbons with other conventional plasma techniques. The plasma polymerized deposits were used on substrates to modify their surface properties. Results show the surface of wood veneer and wood flour can be finely tuned from hydrophilic to hydrophobic. It was achieved by altering the topography of the surfaces along with their chemical composition. The wettability of wood veneer was investigated with contact angle measurements on capacitive drops and the capillary effect was utilized to assess surface properties of wood flour exposed to the discharges.

40|$|The aim of {{this project}} was to {{characterize}} the surface properties of materials used in tablet formulations with sub-micron resolution by the techniques of Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM), Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Scanning Thermal Microscopy (SThM), Nano-TA system, Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC), Attenuated Total Reflectance Infrared (ATR-IR), Near-Infrared Spectroscopy (NIR) and Time-of-Flight Secondary Ion Mass Spectrometry (ToF-SIMS). In particular, the work aimed to develop new AFM based methodologies to advance this method {{both in terms of}} quantification and mapping. AFM was employed to investigate properties of solid materials such as surface free energy, Young’s modulus, melting point and phase transition temperatures from pharmaceutical materials in blend mixtures with the nanoscale resolution. These approaches developed here provide new tools to understand the process induced changes and stability issues in solid dosage forms such as tablets and inhalation formulations from minute amounts of materials. The surface free energy values of solid materials obtained from AFM adhesion force measurements were described in Chapter 3. The adhesion forces obtained with AFM in low relative humidity environments were used to derive the surface free energy values using the Hertzian and JKR based models. The surface free energy was proposed to be close to the so called dispersion surface free energy since the adhesion forces at low relative humidity mainly resulted from van der Waals forces in the systems studied here. The comparison of surface free energy between AFM and those derived from a contact angle method showed that the dispersion surface free energy values derived from the contact angle method were generally higher than those from AFM. For example, the surface free energy value derived from AFM adhesion force measurements for lactose monohydrate was 33. 0 mJ/m 2, while from contact angle method the value was 46. 8 mJ/m 2. Whilst in reasonable agreement, the variation was believed to result from the differences in probe substance (liquid in contact angle and solid in AFM method), scale of measurements (contact area 200 nm 2 in AFM, several mm 2 in contact angle) and possible polar interactions. However, the surface free energy values derived from direct solid-solid interactions in AFM adhesion force measurements may have more relevances in applications that relate to solid-solid interactions, such as in pharmaceuticals. The influence of polar interaction in AFM adhesion force measurements at low relative humidity was further investigated in Chapter 4. The techniques of colloid probe and plasma <b>polymerized</b> <b>coating</b> were employed: Plasma polymerized hexane and allylamine were coated on the surfaces of glass beads mounted on AFM cantilevers. Plasma Polymerized Hexane had only a dispersion surface free energy while plasma polymerized allylamine had both dispersion and polar surface free energy components. The differences in normalized adhesion forces between these two kinds of colloid probes can reveal the influence of polar interactions at low relative humidity in AFM adhesion force measurements. For most samples, the experimental adhesion forces with plasma polymerized allylamine colloid probes were smaller than the theoretical values calculated from dispersion interactions. The polar interactions in such conditions were repulsive so they had decreased the experimental adhesion forces. So in AFM adhesion force measurements, the polar interactions existed even at very low humidity. However the relative magnitude of polar interactions were smaller than the dispersion interactions and for silicon sample the polar interactions were negligible. In Chapter 5, properties including Young’s modulus, melting points and phase transition temperature were measured at the nanoscale with AFM, SThM and the nano-TA system. The variation of Young’s modulus with temperature, for the excipients hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), dibasic calcium phosphate dihydrate (DCPD) was studied. The differences in Young’s modulus between DCPD and its anhydrous form were revealed with AFM measurements. The melting point and phase transition temperature were measured by nano-TA system with sub- 100 nm spatial resolution. The thermal properties obtained from nano-TA system were consistent with those from bulk measurements using DSC: e. g. the dehydration of lactose monohydrate (150 ºC) was confirmed by nano-TA system and DSC measurements. In Chapter 6, the methods to derive surface free energy and thermal properties described in previous chapters were employed to spatially locate and characterize an API (AZD 3409 malate salt) and excipient (lactose monohydrate) on the surface of a model tablet at the nanoscale using AFM and the nano-TA system. The API and excipient were mixed with the ratio of 20 : 80. 50 : 50 and 80 : 20 w/w and compressed into discs to create the model tablets. The surfaces of model tablets were first characterized by ATR-IR, NIR and ToF-SIMS. Then AFM adhesion force measurements were carried out to map the location of each component in the mixed discs. In addition, in situ topography AFM images of the discs were recorded. At the position of force mapping, the nano-TA system was employed to correlate the thermal properties including the melting points of both materials and the dehydration of the lactose monohydrate with surface free energy information from force mapping. The surface free energy and thermal properties data were consistent with bulk measurements in previous chapters. In situ correlation between AFM force mapping (surface energy) and nano-TA system (thermal properties) at 5 differences positions on a model disc surface showed consistent identification of the two materials. This proof of principal work can be extended to more complex formulations and {{has the potential to be}} employed in early stage solid state stability testing to identify the appearance of new species at surfaces or solid-solid interfaces.

To {{investigate}} {{the reason for}} this phenomenon, uromucoid (Tamm-Horsfall protein) was purified from human urine and its capacity to block a 0. 2 [mu]m Millipore filter was measured under different conditions. In the presence of cations (H+, Na+, Ca 2 +) uromucoid blocked the filter. The blocking varied with cation concentration. Scanning electron microscopy of the filter surface revealed different arrangements of <b>polymerized</b> uromucoid <b>coating</b> the filter surface depending on ionic conditions.

In the absence of ions uromucoid formed a homogeneous coat on the filter surface (as demonstrated by scanning electron microscopy, Western blotting and 125 I-uromucoid binding studies) but did not block the filter.

The brush is compressed and a repulsive force arises with an approach of another body and the applied force is supported by fluid. Polymer brush is pro-duced by means of graft polymerization. It is possible to reduce friction and wear of catheters and artificial joints by graft polymerization. Hydration lubrication is inevitable in preventing wear of articular cartilage.

We solved structures of F-BAR modules bound to flat and curved bilayers using electron (cryo) microscopy. We show that membrane tubules form when F-BARs <b>polymerize</b> into helical <b>coats</b> that are {{held together by}} lateral and tip-to-tip interactions. On gel-state membranes or after mutation of residues along the lateral interaction surface, F-BARs adsorb onto bilayers via surfaces other than their concave face. We conclude that membrane binding is separable from membrane bending, and that imposition of the module's concave surface forces fluid-phase bilayers to bend locally. Furthermore, exposure of the domain's lateral interaction surface through a change in orientation serves as the crucial trigger for assembly of the helical coat and propagation of bilayer bending. The geometric constraints and sequential assembly of the helical lattice explain how F-BAR and classical BAR domains segregate into distinct microdomains, and {{provide insight into the}} spatial regulation of membrane invagination...|$|R

Therefore, this study aimed to investigate the abilities of direct current ES through electrospinning conductive polymer composites composed of polypyrrole and Poly (l-lactic acid-co-ε-caprolactone) (PPY/PLCL) in peripheral nerve regeneration. PPY/PLCL composite conduits were synthesized by <b>polymerizing</b> pyrrole <b>coated</b> electrospun PLCL scaffolds. Morphologies and chemical compositions were characterized by scanning electron microscope and attenuated total reflection fourier transform infrared (ATR-FTIR). Rat pheochromyctoma (PC 12) cells and dorsal root ganglia (DRG) cells cultured on PPY/PLCL scaffolds were stimulated with 100 mV/cm for 4 h per day. The median neurite length and cell viability were measured in PC- 12 cells. The levels of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), glial cell derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF) and neurotrophin- 3 (NT- 3) were analyzed in DRG cells. In rats, 15 -mm gaps of sciatic nerves were bridged using an autograft, non-stimulated PPY/PLCL conduit and PPY/PLCL conduit stimulated with 100 mV potential, respectively.

MATERIALS AND METHODS: 10 Class I cavities with dentin caries were included in each group. Following complete caries removal, a total-etch technique was performed with 32 % phosphoric acid (Uni-Etch) for 15 s. After rinsing, each cavity was air-dried for 1 s, then a slow setting vinyl polysiloxane (President) impression was taken. As a control, impressions were taken from three additional cavities in teeth that were anesthetized with Mepivacaine 3 % but not acid etched. A TEM-grade epoxy resin was used to prepare replicas from the impressions. <b>Polymerized</b> replicas were <b>coated</b> with gold and examined with a scanning electron microscope.

40|$|In Eukaryotes {{vesicular}} transport mechanisms collectively {{ensure the}} transport {{and distribution of}} proteins and lipids between cellular compartments to maintain their unique composition and their specialized functions. COPI vesicles mediate retrograde transport from the ERGIC/Golgi to the ER as well as intra-Golgi transport. Formation as well as consumption of COPI-coated transport vesicles is directly controlled by small GTPases of the Arf family, which in turn are regulated via specific Guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) and GTPase Activating Proteins (GAPs). COPI vesicle formation is initiated by recruitment of Arf 1 to membranes, which subsequently recruits the heptameric coat complex coatomer. GTP hydrolysis within Arf 1 {{is a prerequisite for}} COPI vesicle uncoating. Three ArfGAPs are associated with COPI vesicle formation in mammalian cells: ArfGAP 1, ArfGAP 2 and ArfGAP 3. During the course of this work mechanistic aspects of COPI vesicle biogenesis were investigated: i) the interaction of ArfGAPs with coatomer isoforms, ii) the regulation of ArfGAP activity by p 24 family proteins, and iii) the molecular mechanism of COPI vesicle uncoating. We have determined the dissociation constants of the ArfGAPs {{for each of the four}} individual coatomer isoforms and found that all three ArfGAPs displayed a higher affinity for the γ 1 ζ 1 isoform than for the other isoforms. This result is in accordance with the localization of both ArfGAP 2 / 3 and γ 1 ζ 1 to the cis-Golgi, whereas ArfGAP 1 is equally distributed throughout the Golgi apparatus. Furthermore, we have investigated an effect on the GAP activity of ArfGAP 1 and ArfGAP 2 of the cytoplasmic tail of the transmembrane protein p 23, a COPI vesicle machinery protein. p 23 was reported to induce a conformational change in coatomer, resulting in a structure that resembles coatomer conformation within the <b>polymerized</b> COPI <b>coat.</b> Interestingly, p 23 influenced the activity of ArfGAP 1 and ArfGAP 2 in an opposite fashion: whereas ArfGAP 2 displayed a higher rate of Arf 1 GTP hydrolysis in the presence of p 23, ArfGAP 1 displayed a lower rate. Thus, ArfGAP 2 / 3 might preferentially interact with polymerized coatomer as found on a completed COPI vesicle. Although GTP hydrolysis in Arf 1 is commonly considered necessary for coat disassembly, it remains obscure whether it is sufficient to complete this process. To investigate this pivotal mechanistic question, we have established a real-time assay to follow the fate of the COPI coat components of purified vesicles upon addition of ArfGAPs, and discovered an unanticipated essential role of the non-catalytic domains of ArfGAPs. While GTP-hydrolysis within Arf 1, induced by the isolated catalytic domain of the ArfGAP, released the small GTPase from the coat, the network of coatomer remained associated with vesicle membranes. Only in the presence of full-length ArfGAP 1, including the non-catalytic part, the coat network was completely disassembled. We propose that the energy released upon GTP-hydrolysis in Arf 1 is coupled by GAP-coatomer interactions to mediate conformational changes in coatomer that are required for COPI coat disassembly...|$|R
40|$|UHMWPE fibre {{is one of}} {{the most}} popular high {{performance}} fibres that have been widely used for load bearing and high-energy absorption applications. An examination of the theoretical strength of PE suggests that the strength of the state-of-the-art UHMWPE is still far from reaching its theoretical potential. The discovery of carbon nanotubes (CNT) has created promising opportunities for super high performance materials. A natural scientific enquiry is the feasibility of creating super strong fibres by reinforcing UHMWPE (ultrahigh molecular weight polyethylene) with CNT. Several groups including the Hong Kong Polytechnic University and Donghua University have explored the CNT/UHMWPE composite fibre concept. The Hong Kong group reported a 11. 6 %, 18. 8 % and 15. 4 % increase in tensile modulus, strength and strain respectively with the addition of 5 % MWCNT (multi-wall carbon nanotube tube) in UHMWPE whereas the Donghua group reported an 8. 88 %, 1. 34 % and 14. 1 % increase in tensile modulus, strength and breaking strain respectively by the addition of 1 % MWCNT. However, considering the theoretical strength of UHMWPE fibre and the reported range of CNT strength on the order of 30 to 180 GPa, the load transfer efficiency from CNT to the matrix is still far from being fully realized. This may be attributed to the lack of strong chemical bonding between the CNT and UHMWPE matrix. To address the weak fibre-matrix interface issue a thin layer of polymer (grafted and in situ <b>polymerized</b> PS) was <b>coated</b> on to SWCNT(single-wall carbon nanotube) surface with desired functional groups, which were further reacted with PE-g-GMA for additional interfacial compatibility. The polymer coated SWCNT-PE composite was successfully gel-spun and super drawn (as high as DR= 100). The strength of the gel-spun fibres was shown to be diameter dependent following a classical exponential relationship. It was found that the critical fibre diameter to achieve high strength appears to be below 15 micron. Fibre strength as high as 6. 7 GPa was produced with elongation at break of 18 %o. This remarkable combination of strength and toughness implied significant improvement of interfacial bonding between SWCNT and UHMWPE and that the strength of individual SWCNT could be as high as 75 GPa (in the 1 middle range 30 GPa to 180 GPa as reported in the literature). The processing, structure and properties of the super strong UHMWPE/SWCNT composite fibres are reported in this paper. Peer reviewed: YesNRC publication: Ye...|$|R
