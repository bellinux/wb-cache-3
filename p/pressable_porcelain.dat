40|$|Objectives: This study {{compared}} {{the reliability and}} fracture patterns of zirconia cores veneered with <b>pressable</b> <b>porcelain</b> submitted to either axial or off-axis sliding contact fatigue. Methods: Forty-two Y-TZP plates (12 mm x 12 mm x 0. 5 mm) veneered with <b>pressable</b> <b>porcelain</b> (12 mm x 12 mm x 1. 2 mm) and adhesively luted to water aged composite resin blocks (12 mm x 12 mm x 4 mm) were stored in water at least 7 days prior to testing. Profiles for step-stress fatigue (ratio 3 : 2 : 1) were determined from single load to fracture tests (n = 3). Fatigue loading was delivered on specimen either on axial (n = 18) or off-axis 30 degrees angulation (n = 18) to simulate posterior tooth cusp inclination creating a 0. 7 mm slide. Single load and fatigue tests utilized a 6. 25 mm diameter WC indenter. Specimens were inspected by means of polarized-light microscope and SEM. Use level probability Weibull curves were plotted with 2 -sided 90 % confidence bounds (CB) and reliability for missions of 50, 000 cycles at 200 N (90 % CB) were calculated. Results: The calculated Weibull Beta was 3. 34 and 2. 47 for axial and off-axis groups, respectively, indicating that fatigue accelerated failure in both loading modes. The reliability data for a mission of 50, 000 cycles at 200 N load with 90 % CB indicates no difference between loading groups. Deep penetrating cone cracks reaching the core-veneer interface were observed in both groups. Partial cones due to the sliding component were observed along with the cone cracking for the off-axis group. No Y-TZP core fractures were observed. Conclusions: Reliability was not significantly different between axial and off-axis mouth-motion fatigued pressed over Y-TZP cores, but incorporation of sliding resulted in more aggressive damage on the veneer.

30|$|One {{limitation}} of this present study was that only one CAD/CAM ceramic was tested {{and it was not}} do any aging process. Further research should be carried out to include <b>pressable</b> and stackable <b>porcelain,</b> as well as other CAD/CAM ceramics.|$|R
40|$|A {{technique}} of fabricating feldspathic <b>porcelain</b> <b>pressable</b> ingots was proposed. A 5 ml disposable syringe {{was used to}} condense the powder slurry. The condensed porcelain was sintered at 900 ΀C to produce porcelain ingots. The fabricated porcelain ingots were used in pressable ceramic machines. The technological advantages of pressable system improve the properties, and the fabricated ingot enhances the application of feldspathic porcelain...|$|R
40|$|Objective: To {{compare the}} {{translucency}} of six different porcelains indicated for veneers, with various shades and opacities. Methods: 13 mm diameter and 0. 7 mm thickness discs were fabricated {{for the following}} porcelains (A 1 shade; n= 5) : Empress Esthetic (EE), e. maxPress (EP), InLine (IL) (Ivoclar Vivadent); VITA PM 9 (VPM), Vitablocks MarkII (VMII) (Vita Zahnfabrik); Kavo Everest G-Blank (KEG) (KaVo Dental GmbH) and Lava Zirconia (LZ) (3 M ESPE). IL and LZ respectively served as positive and negative controls. Groups with different shades (BL 2, BL 4, A 1, B 1), as well as high (HT) and low translucencies (LT), were fabricated for e. maxPress. The luminous reflectance (Y) and color coordinates (CIE L*a*b*) were measured with a colorimeter (CIE illuminant D 65, 2 -degree observer function) with the specimens placed on black and white backgrounds. Contrast ratios (CR = YB/YW) and translucency parameters (TP= [(LB* - LW*) 2 + (aB* - aW*) 2 + (bB* - bW*) 2] 1 / 2) were calculated. One-way ANOVA and post-hoc Tukey 2 ̆ 7 s HSD tests were {{used to analyze the}} data (α = 0. 05). Results: Statistically significant differences in CR and TP were found among porcelains (P 3 ̆c. 0001). The CR means in order of decreasing translucency were: VPM (0. 15) 3 ̆e VMII (0. 24), IL (0. 25), KEG (0. 26) 3 ̆e EP HTB 1 (0. 32), EE (0. 34) 3 ̆e EP HTA 1 (0. 37), EP HTBL 4 (0. 37) 3 ̆e EP HTBL 2 (0. 43), EP LTA 1 (0. 47) 3 ̆e LZ (0. 73). The TP means in order of decreasing translucency were: VPM (40. 34) 3 ̆e VMII (33. 66), KEG (33. 52), IL (32. 44) 3 ̆e EP HTB 1 (27. 96), EE (27. 64) 3 ̆e EP HTA 1 (26. 59), EP HTBL 4 (26. 14) 3 ̆e EP HTBL 2 (22. 70), EP LTA 1 (21. 35) 3 ̆e LZ (10. 43). Translucency of conventional feldspathic porcelain was comparable to that of machinable feldspathic <b>porcelain.</b> <b>Pressable</b> feldspathic <b>porcelain</b> presented the greatest translucency. Shade and thickness influenced lithium disilicate porcelain translucency. Conclusion: Various ceramics systems designed for porcelain veneers present various degrees of translucency...|$|R
