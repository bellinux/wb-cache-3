5|$|Much of the {{management}} work {{carried out in the}} nature reserve is aimed at encouraging ducks to breed, and small numbers of tufted duck (Aythya fuligula), common <b>pochard</b> (Aythya ferina), common shelduck (Tadorna tadorna) and gadwall raise broods most years. Recent breeding successes also include water rail (Rallus aquaticus) and Cetti's warbler (Cettia cetti).|$|E
5|$|The Bucklands Pool/Backwell Lake Local Nature Reserve, {{southeast}} of the town centre {{and close to the}} Nailsea and Backwell railway station, was constructed as a balancing pond in the mid-1970s, and has since become home to various wildfowl and dragonflies and a foraging area for bats. Bird species seen on the reserve include gadwall, shoveller, <b>pochard,</b> tufted duck, grey heron and mute swans.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{with lead}} shot, {{along with the}} use of lead sinkers in angling, has been {{identified}} as a major cause of lead poisoning in waterfowl, which often feed off the bottom of lakes and wetlands where the shot collects. A Spanish study showed that northern pintail and common <b>pochard</b> were the species with the highest levels of lead shot ingestion, higher than in northern countries of the western Palearctic flyway, where lead shot has been banned. In the United States, Canada, and many western European countries, all shot used for waterfowl must now be non-toxic, and therefore may not contain any lead.|$|E

5|$|Swans {{and geese}} usually start {{to arrive in}} late October. Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and green sandpipers. Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, pink-footed goose, barnacle goose and Taiga bean goose. The swans tend to fly off {{in the day and}} return to feed in the late afternoon, and another spectacular sight at the end of winter afternoons is the arrival of large flocks of starlings. Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, common <b>pochard,</b> northern pintail, water rail, dunlin, redshank, curlew, golden plover, snipe and ruff.|$|E
5|$|Southlake Moor {{is another}} SSSI, which forms {{part of an}} {{extensive}} grazing marsh and ditch system. When conditions in the River Parrett are suitable, the moor can be deliberately flooded in winter by opening a sluice in the river's floodbank. Some 96species of aquatic and bankside vascular plant species have been recorded on Southlake Moor, including the greater water-parsnip (Sium latifolium). When the moor is flooded it can be occupied by large numbers of wildfowl; up to 22,000 wigeon (Anas penelope), 250Bewick's swan (Cygnus bewickii) and good numbers of <b>pochard</b> (Aythya ferina), teal (Anas crecca) and tufted duck (Aythya fuligula). Signs of European otters (Lutra lutra) are regularly seen on the muddy banks of the River Parrett. The ditches {{on the east side}} of the site are populated by palmate newts (Triturus helveticus).|$|E
5|$|The {{tangible}} and intangible {{cultural heritage}} of Antananarivo is extensive and highly significant to regional and national populations. The city has numerous monuments, historic buildings, sites of significance and traditions related to the customs {{and history of the}} central highlands people. The city skyline is dominated by the Rova of Antananarivo, which was destroyed in a 1995 fire but are undergoing reconstruction. The nearby Andafiavaratra Palace was the home of 19th century Prime Minister Rainilaiarivony and currently contains a museum featuring historic artifacts of the Kingdom of Imerina, including items saved from the fire at the Rova. Downhill from the palaces is Andohalo square, where Merina kings and queens delivered speeches to the public. Tsimbazaza Zoo displays many of the island's unique animal species and a complete skeleton of the now-extinct elephant bird. Other historic buildings include the Ambatondrafandrana tribunal where Ranavalona I dispensed judgement, the second residence of Rainilaiarivony with its indigenous medicinal plant garden, the recently renovated Soarano railroad station, four late 19th century memorial churches built to commemorate early Malagasy Christian martyrs, the tomb of Prime Minister Rainiharo, and the early 20th century pavilions of the Analakely market. Open air markets include Le <b>Pochard</b> and the artisan market at Andravoahangy. The Museum of Art and Archaeology in the Isoraka neighborhood features exhibits on the history and cultures of Madagascar's diverse ethnic groups.|$|E

50|$|Wildlife include little egrets, spotbills, and carps, {{seasonally}} also tufted ducks, northern pintails, {{and common}} <b>pochards.</b>|$|R
50|$|Their {{breeding}} habitat {{consists of}} marshes and lakes with a metre or more water depth. <b>Pochards</b> breed {{in much of}} temperate and northern Europe into Asia. They are migratory, and spend winter {{in the south and}} west of Europe.|$|R
25|$|Waterfowl which {{breed in}} or pass through Kaziranga include several rare species of geese (lesser white-fronted goose), and ducks (ferruginous <b>pochard,</b> Baer's <b>pochard).</b> Other rare {{riverine}} birds include kingfishers (Blyth's kingfisher), herons (white-bellied heron), pelicans (Dalmatian pelican, spot-billed pelican), shanks (spotted greenshank) and terns (black-bellied tern). Rare migratory storks and cranes are also seen wintering {{in the park}} (lesser adjutant, greater adjutant, black-necked stork, Asian openbill).|$|E
25|$|The {{park has}} some 8,800 trees, {{including}} Ginkgo biloba, Cinnamomum camphora, Zelkova serrata, Formosan cherry, Somei-Yoshino cherry, and Japanese cherry. There {{is a further}} 24,800m2 of shrubs. Shinobazu Pond is a small lake with an area of 16 ha, extensive lotus beds, and marshland. It provides an important wintering ground for birds. Species commonly found include the tufted duck, Eurasian wigeon, northern pintail, common <b>pochard,</b> little grebe, great egret, and great cormorant. The Baer's <b>pochard,</b> ring-necked duck, and American wigeon have also been recorded.|$|E
25|$|Other {{wintering}} waterfowls are coot, cormorant, goldeneye, mallard, <b>pochard,</b> teal, and tufted duck. Other {{species that}} {{live on the}} lakes are the black-headed gull, little grebe, and mute swan.|$|E
50|$|Several {{species have}} been {{recorded}} here, including Gadwall, Canada Geese, Moorhens, Cormorants, mallard, Tufted ducks, Northern Shovellers, Gulls, Coots, Great crested Grebe, Sand Martin, Temminck's Stint and <b>Pochards.</b> Raptors have also been seen here, including Osprey, Kestrel and Horned owl.|$|R
50|$|The diving ducks, {{commonly}} called <b>pochards</b> or scaups, are {{a category of}} duck which feed by diving {{beneath the surface of}} the water. They are part of Anatidae, the diverse and very large family that includes ducks, geese, and swans.|$|R
50|$|Major {{part of the}} {{mountain}} is covered by mixed broadleaf and coniferous forest and protected in a 30,000 ha national park. It has been identified by BirdLife International as an Important Bird Area (IBA) because it supports populations of Oriental storks and critically endangered Baer's <b>pochards.</b>|$|R
25|$|Birds such as {{the lesser}} white-fronted goose, {{ferruginous}} duck, Baer's <b>pochard</b> duck and lesser adjutant, greater adjutant, black-necked stork, and Asian openbill stork migrate from Central Asia to the park during winter.|$|E
25|$|Mainland has a {{great deal}} of marine life {{surrounding}} it, especially seabirds. Corncrakes can also be found in some parts. The Loch of Harray can host up to 10,000 wintering duck and is important for <b>pochard.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{world was}} {{believed}} to have been formed out of a <b>pochard</b> egg. The sky {{was believed to}} be the upper cover of the egg, alternately it was seen as a tent, which was supported by a column at the north pole, below the north star.|$|E
40|$|Wild {{birds have}} {{been implicated in}} the {{expansion}} of highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus (H 5 N 1) outbreaks across Asia, the Middle East, Europe, and Africa (in addition to traditional transmission by infected poultry, contaminated equipment, and people). Such a role would require wild birds to excrete virus {{in the absence of}} debilitating disease. By experimentally infecting wild ducks, we found that tufted ducks, Eurasian <b>pochards,</b> and mallards excreted signifi-cantly more virus than common teals, Eurasian wigeons, and gadwalls; yet only tufted ducks and, to a lesser degree, <b>pochards</b> became ill or died. These fi ndings suggest that some wild duck species, particularly mallards, can potentially be long-distance vectors of highly pathogenic avian infl uenza virus (H 5 N 1) and that others, particularly tufted ducks, are more likely to act as sentinels...|$|R
50|$|The {{reservoir}} has {{a nationally}} important population of gadwalls, {{and it also}} has significant numbers of <b>pochards,</b> teal, tufted ducks and pintails. The chalk sludge lagoon has several unusual plants, including golden dock and marsh dock, {{and there is a}} rare moss Brachythecium mildeanum {{at the foot of the}} southern dam.|$|R
50|$|The {{site was}} {{formerly}} settling ponds to remove washings from sugar beet. The east side has a lake with water birds such as grey herons, tufted ducks and <b>pochards.</b> In the west {{there is a}} reedbed which has pools and channels, with great crested newts and unusual species of water beetle.|$|R
25|$|The Staines Moor SSSI also {{includes}} King George VI Reservoir {{which is to}} the east. The reservoir carries nationally important wintering populations of tufted ducks, <b>pochard,</b> goosander and common goldeneye. The moor is separated from Wraysbury Reservoir to the west by the M25 and a footpath-accessible viaduct once used by the short-lived Staines and West Drayton Railway.|$|E
25|$|The {{forest cover}} of the {{district}} has dwindled with increasing use of land for agriculture. There are areas with high prevalence of mango (Mangifera indica), mahua (Madhuca longifolia), sal (Shorea robusta), and bamboo (Bambusa arundinacea) trees. Some of the wild animals of the district are the nilgai (Boselaphus tragocamelus), antelok (Anelok cervicapra), pig (Sus scrofa), wolf (Canis lupus), jackal (Conis aureus), fox (Vulpes bengalensis), hare (Lepus ruficandatus), monkey (Macaca mulatta), wild cat (Felis bengalensis) and the porcupine (Hystric leucura). Several species of game birds are also seen, including the peafowl (Pavo cristatus), the black partridge (Frencolinus francolinus) and the gray partridge (Francalinus pondicervanus). A number of migratory water fowls visit the water bodies of the district in winter, such as the goose (Anser anser), common teal (Anas crecca), red-crested <b>pochard</b> (Netta rufina), white-eyed <b>pochard</b> (Aythya rufa) and the wigeon (Mareca penelope). The cobra (Naja naja), krait (Bungarus caeruleus), and rat-snake (Ptyas mucosus) are commonly found. The Indian crocodile or naka (Crocodylus palustris), and the ghariyal (Gavialis gangeticus) are {{also found in the}} river Ghaghra. The common fish species are rohu (Lebeo rohita), bhakur (Catla catla), nain (Cirrhina mrigala), parhin (Wallagonia attu), krunch (Labeo calbasu), and tengan (Mystus seenghala).|$|E
25|$|This type of {{ecosystem}} is {{noted for its}} variety and large population of birds, some of them very rare. The most important are the tufted duck (Aythya fuligula, red-crested <b>pochard</b> (Netta rufina), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), greylag goose (Anser anser), pygmy cormorant (Microcarbo pygmeus), purple heron (Ardea purpurea), great white egret (Egretta alba), little egret (Egretta garzetta), eurasian spoonbill(Platalea leucorodia), great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus), mute swan (Cygnus olor), and glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus). A recent and welcomed newcomer is the pheasant (Phasianus colchicus).|$|E
50|$|The lake {{is home to}} a {{large number}} of wild birds {{including}} Black swans, Mute swans, Tundra swans, Whooper swans, Little egrets, Intermediate egrets, Great egrets, Eurasian widgeons, Mallards, Spot-billed ducks, Common coots, White wagtails, Black-headed gulls, Herring gulls, Great Crested Grebes, Little grebes, Moorhens, Northern Pintails, <b>Pochards</b> and Kingfishers.|$|R
50|$|Breeding birds include <b>pochards,</b> {{which are}} nationally scarce, mute swans, {{great crested grebe}} and grey herons. There are many more {{waterfowl}} in the winter. The site is also important for bats, and amphibians include the protected great crested newt. Aquatic plants include bogbean and frogbit, {{both of which are}} rare in London.|$|R
50|$|Many {{waterfowl}} {{have taken}} up residence on the lake and the peninsula. Most commonly found are Eurasian coots, Mallard ducks, herons, <b>pochards,</b> and mute swans. A protected island for bird nesting, as well as floating nesting grounds within the lake, have been provided to encourage these species to settle at the lake.|$|R
25|$|The {{valley of}} the Charente {{upstream}} from Angoulême is a Natura 2000 zone with remarkable species: 64 species of birds. Among them are species for marshland and wetland; and at Angoulême {{it is common to}} see diving and swimming birds, swans (mute swan), grebes (black-necked grebe, little grebe, horned grebe, great crested grebe), geese (greylag goose), ducks (gadwall, pintail, wigeon, shoveler), teal (garganey, teal) and scaup (<b>pochard,</b> tufted duck) on the Charente. It is more rare to see waders. Terns, gulls (laughing gull), great cormorants, return during periods of storms from far upstream on the river.|$|E
25|$|A heronry {{is located}} by Trentabank Reservoir within the reserve; with around twenty-two nests, {{it is the}} largest in the Peak District. The heronry is visible from several viewpoints, and {{close-up}} CCTV pictures of the nests can also be seen in the Trentabank ranger station. Other birds observed in the woodland include crossbills, siskins, goldcrests, pied flycatchers, garden warblers, blackcaps and woodcocks, while the reservoirs support abundant waterfowl including cormorants, coots, goldeneyes, <b>pochard,</b> mallards, tufted ducks, teal, great crested grebe, little grebe and common sandpipers. A herd of around twelve red deer, the remnant of the royal forest herd, still frequents the forest. Small mammals present in the woodland include badgers and weasels.|$|E
25|$|Lough Leane, and {{the other}} lakes to a lesser extent, support {{wintering}} birds that travel south from higher latitudes. These species include redwing, fieldfare, golden plover and waterfowl such as teal, goldeneye, wigeon, <b>pochard</b> and whooper swan. The park's native bird populations are augmented by migrant species in both winter and summer. A small flock of Greenland white-fronted geese (Anser albifrons flavirostris) from the world population of approximately 12,000 migrates to winter on boglands in the Killarney Valley within the park. The numbers of this bird that stay in the park are currently low, at less than twenty individuals. This population {{is important because it}} is the most southerly in Ireland {{and one of the few}} remaining populations remaining that feed entirely on bogland, and whose habitat almost entirely lies within a protected area.|$|E
50|$|In spring, {{a variety}} of birds can be seen, {{including}} gadwalls, shovelers and <b>pochards,</b> which {{can be seen in}} the open water and in the ditches; lapwings, avocets, oystercatchers and redshanks nest in the marshes; marsh harriers and barn owls can also be found. Migrant waders and whimbrels can also be found in the grassland.|$|R
50|$|There are 241 {{recorded}} {{species of}} birds, including 49 wetland species. Coots are {{often found in}} the lake. During the winter, great-crested and black-necked grebes, red-crested <b>pochards,</b> mallard, common teal (Anas crecca), and common merganser are common. Other birds seen often include the Himalayan snowcock, chukar partridge, Himalayan monal, kalij pheasant and blood pheasant.|$|R
50|$|The higher vegetated {{areas of}} the lake support moorhens, coots and jacanas. Pond herons and night herons can be seen along the shores with kingfishers and rollers. Little {{cormorants}} are seen on perches around the lake, Compact flocks of brahminy ducks, as well as shovellers, pintails, gadwall, teals, <b>pochards,</b> geese and coots, are also seen.|$|R
