5000|$|The other {{decision}} is the labor-leisure tradeoff.

50|$|Shadow {{institutions}} {{are not subject}} to the same prudential regulations as depository banks, so {{that they do not have}} to keep as high financial reserves relative to their market exposure. Thus they can have a very high level of financial leverage, with a high ratio of debt relative to the liquid assets available to pay immediate claims. High leverage magnifies profits during boom periods and losses during downturns. This high leverage will also not be readily apparent to investors, and shadow institutions may therefore be able to create the appearance of superior performance during boom times by simply taking greater <b>pro-cyclical</b> risks. Money market funds have zero leverage and thus do not pose this risk feature of shadow banks.|$|E
5000|$|Thus the {{financial}} regulations of the Basel II Accord {{have been criticized}} for their possible procyclicality. The accord requires banks to increase their capital ratios when they face greater risks. Unfortunately, this may require them to lend less during a recession or a credit crunch, which could aggravate the downturn. A similar criticism has been directed at fair value accounting rules. [...] The effect of the single Eurozone interest rate on the relatively high-inflation countries in the Eurozone periphery is also <b>pro-cyclical,</b> leading to very low or even negative real interest rates during an upturn which magnifies the boom (e.g. 'Celtic Tiger' upturn in Ireland) and property and asset price bubbles whose subsequent bust magnifies the downturns.|$|E

5000|$|The {{shift from}} Craft to Mass Production leads to new policy requirements; {{it calls for}} what Abba Lerner called Functional Finance, but this {{approach}} fell out of favor during the difficult times following the oil shocks. There was a widespread, if temporary, experiment with monetarism, and a lasting disillusionment with fine tuning and demand management. But the basics of functional finance are sound, and reflect understanding of modern (fiat and credit-based) money, money which has no anchor. Reviving this approach today leads to the program for an [...] "employer of last resort", (ELR). This offers a policy framework that will support full employment, while constraining inflation. It offers an opportunity to fulfill many social objectives as well. And it takes advantage of transformational growth, which changes the Federal budget from neutral or <b>pro-cyclical</b> to counter-cyclical.|$|E
5000|$|All {{mentioned}} above market-based measures have a one important drawback. In particular, according to Da et al. (2014): [...] "Although market-based measures {{have the advantage}} of being readily available at a relatively high frequency, they have the disadvantage of being the equilibrium outcome of many economic forces other than investor sentiment." [...] In other words, one can never be sure that a particular market-based indicator was driven due to investor attention. Moreover, some indicators can work <b>pro-cyclical.</b> For example, a high trading volume can draw an investor attention. As a result, the trading volume grows even higher. This, in turn, leads to even bigger investor attention. Overall, market-based indicators are playing a very important role in measuring investor attention. However, an investor should always {{try to make sure that}} no other variables can drive the result.|$|E

5000|$|Utilities have {{traditionally}} been businesses where the customer is the regulator rather than the rate-payer using the service. This has traditionally meant innovation, including {{through the use of}} corporate venturing, has been of lower priority than gaining market share and pricing power unless required by regulatory action. Corporate venturing at utilities, therefore, has historically been more <b>pro-cyclical</b> to the economic than other industry sectors. [...] However, telecom operators in particular, such as Deutsche Telekom's T-Venture and formerly France Telecom's Innovacom, have built up a successful track record through at least one economic cycle and an increasing number of utilities across the electric, gas and phone industries have started to increase their use of external innovation and corporate venturing.

5000|$|A “balance sheet mechanism” {{focuses on}} {{institutional}} features of financial markets. It provides {{an explanation for}} feedback loop mechanisms between the asset prices and balance sheets, and investors' preference for liquidity. The idea is that if investors' balance sheets depend on asset prices under delegated investment management, then a negative asset price shock tightens the investors' balance sheets, forcing them to liquidate assets, and makes investors prefer more liquid and less risky assets. Forced liquidation and changes in investors' preferences further lower asset prices and deteriorate the balance sheets, amplifying the initial shock.

[...] "ERNs would be long-term bonds with the feature that any interest or principal payable on a date when the stock price is lower than a pre-specified price would be paid in stock at that pre-specified price." [...] Through ERNs, distressed banks would have access to much needed equity as willing investors purchase tranches of ERNs similar to pooling tranches of subprime mortgages. In this case however, the market, not the public takes the risks. Banking can be <b>pro-cyclical</b> by contributing to booms and busts. Stressed banks become reluctant to lend since they are often unable to raise capital equity through new investors.

50|$|In particular, the East Asian crisis (1997-1998) {{is widely}} {{known as a}} {{large-scale}} financial crisis caused by {{the combination of the}} three policies which violate the impossible trinity. The East Asian countries were taking a de facto dollar peg (fixed exchange rate), promoting the free movement of capital (free capital flow) and making independent monetary policy at the same time. First, because of the de facto dollar peg, foreign investors could invest in Asian countries without the risk of exchange rate fluctuation. Second, the free flow of capital kept foreign investment uninhibited. Third, the short-term interest rates of Asian countries were higher than the short-term interest rate of the United States from 1990-1999. For these reasons, many foreign investors invested enormous amounts of money in Asian countries and reaped huge profits. While the Asian countries' trade balance was favorable, the investment was <b>pro-cyclical</b> for the countries. But when the Asian countries' trade balance shifted, investors quickly retrieved their money, triggering the Asian crisis. Eventually countries such as Thailand ran out of dollar reserves and were forced to let their currencies float and devalue. Since many short term debt obligations were denoted in US dollars, debts grew substantially and many businesses had to shut down and declare bankruptcy.|$|E
50|$|A wage-led growth {{strategy}} aims at {{establishing a}} full-employment growth {{model in which}} sustained wage growth drives demand growth via consumption growth and via accelerator effects of investment growth, as well as productivity growth via labor-saving-induced technological change. Due to this strategy's repeating itself in a cyclical manner, this theory {{is thought to be}} more stable in the long run than profit-led growth because a wage-led growth strategy will result in stable or rising wage shares if it follows the circular cumulative causation behavior. This theory commands slower paced growth and is more viable in the long run, however, it relies heavily on technological change to redistribute wages and labor in order to continue along the cumulative causation trend. A wage-led growth strategy includes measures to restrict financial speculation, encourage a more long-term view in corporate governance, strengthen the role of stakeholders, and rein in excessive pay in the financial sector. A restructuring of the financial sector is needed to prevent or reduce the frequency and severity of financial crises. Such measures are likely to include restrictions on bank bonuses, financial transactions taxes, <b>pro-cyclical</b> credit management, regulation of the shadow banking industry, and closing of secrecy jurisdictions (tax havens), as well as the establishment of a sizable not-for-profit segment within the banking industry and a strengthening of stakeholders within corporate governance that will also lead to an improvement in labor's bargaining power and the wage share.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} the so-popular anecdote {{according to which}} <b>pro-cyclical</b> fiscal policies in SSA countries are due to <b>pro-cyclical</b> behavior of financing. We {{address the question of}} whether or not the pro-cyclicality of Official Development Assistance (ODA) with respect to donor macroeconomic conditions leads to <b>pro-cyclical</b> fiscal policies in recipient countries. To this end, we employed panel data techniques covering 39 Sub-Saharan Africa countries over the period from 1985 to 2012. We find that results depend on the type of ODA: <b>pro-cyclical</b> bilateral aid is negatively associated to <b>pro-cyclical</b> fiscal policy, while <b>pro-cyclical</b> ODA from multilateral agencies leads to more <b>pro-cyclical</b> fiscal policy. This finding is robust to potential error bias in ODA cyclicality coefficients, alternative specifications, additional controls and different estimation methods. Furthermore, the effects seem to differ between British legal system‘s countries where bilateral aid leads to counter-cyclical fiscal policy and other ones French where ODA from multilateral agencies appears more better for fiscal policy. However, both bilateral and multilateral ODA pro-cyclicality can lead to more <b>pro-cyclical</b> fiscal policy when the country is opened to international trade, oil or primary products exporter...|$|E
