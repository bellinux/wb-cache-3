5|$|Camel milk is {{a staple}} food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for palmitic acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% <b>palmitoleic</b> acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, {{but it does not}} compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
5|$|Locusts yield {{about five}} times more edible protein per unit of fodder than cattle, and produce lower levels of {{greenhouse}} gases in the process. The feed conversion rate of orthopterans is 1.7kg/kg, while for beef it is typically about 10kg/kg. The protein content in fresh weight is between 13–28 g/100g for adult locust, 14–18 g/100g for larvae, as compared to 19–26 g/100g for beef. The calculated protein efficiency ratio is however low, with 1.69 for locust protein compared to 2.5 for standard casein. A serving of 100 g of desert locust provides 11.5 g of fat, 53.5% of which is unsaturated, and 286mg of cholesterol. Among the fatty acids, <b>palmitoleic,</b> oleic and linolenic acids {{were found to be}} the most abundant. Varying amounts of potassium, sodium, phosphorus, calcium, magnesium, iron, and zinc were present.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{total fat}} {{composition}} is roughly: 1%ω-3, 14%ω-6, 71%ω-9 (65% oleic and 6% <b>palmitoleic),</b> and 14% saturated fat (palmitic acid).|$|E
25|$|An isotope {{labeling}} {{study in}} humans {{concluded that the}} fraction of dietary stearic acid that oxidatively desaturates to oleic acid is 2.4 {{times higher than the}} fraction of palmitic acid analogously converted to <b>palmitoleic</b> acid.|$|E
50|$|<b>Palmitoleic</b> acid can be {{abbreviated}} as 16:1∆9. Dietary {{sources of}} <b>palmitoleic</b> acid include breast milk, {{a variety of}} animal oils, vegetable oils, and marine oils. Macadamia oil (Macadamia integrifolia) and sea buckthorn oil (Hippophae rhamnoides) are botanical sources with high concentrations, containing 17% and 19-29% of <b>palmitoleic</b> acid, respectively.|$|E
50|$|Botanical {{alternatives}} to mink oil {{as a source}} of <b>palmitoleic</b> acid include macadamia nut oil (Macadamia integrifolia) and sea buckthorn oil (Hippophae rhamnoides), both of which contain as much or more <b>palmitoleic</b> acid (17% and 19-29% respectively) than does mink oil (17%).|$|E

50|$|<b>Palmitoleic</b> acid {{at such a}} high {{concentration}} is rarely found in vegetable oils. This fatty acid is mostly found in fish oils. <b>Palmitoleic</b> acid is found in macadamia oil in concentrations as high as 21%.Derivatives of macadamia oil in cosmetics include the light emollient ethyl macadamiate and water-soluble PEG-16 macadamia glycerides.|$|E
50|$|<b>Palmitoleic</b> acid {{also serves}} as a {{biomarker}} for metabolic status. More specifically, a low concentration in the free acid component of the serum indicates a risk of metabolic disease, and that de novo lipogenesis should be stimulated. Additionally, administering <b>palmitoleic</b> acid to a subject (via nutraceutical or other means), positively impacts lipid metabolism.|$|E

5000|$|Typical {{total fat}} {{composition}} is roughly: 1% ω-3, 14% ω-6, 71% ω-9 (65% oleic and 6% <b>palmitoleic),</b> and 14% saturated fat (palmitic acid).|$|E
50|$|Common {{monounsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} are <b>palmitoleic</b> acid (16:1 n&minus;7), cis-vaccenic acid (18:1 n&minus;7) and oleic acid (18:1 n&minus;9). <b>Palmitoleic</b> acid has 16 carbon atoms {{with the first}} double bond occurring 7 carbon atoms away from the methyl group (and 9 carbons from the carboxyl end). It can be lengthened to the 18-carbon cis-vaccenic acid. Oleic acid has 18 carbon atoms with the first double bond occurring 9 carbon atoms away from the carboxylic acid group. The illustrations below show a molecule of oleic acid in Lewis formula and as a space-filling model.|$|E
50|$|Oxidation of omega-7 {{unsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} {{on the skin}} surface, such as <b>palmitoleic</b> acid and vaccenic acid, may {{be the cause of}} the phenomenon commonly known as old person smell.|$|E
50|$|The main {{function}} of beta-ketoacyl-ACP synthase {{is to produce}} fatty acids of various lengths {{for use by the}} organism. These uses include energy storage and creation of cell membranes. Fatty acids {{can also be used to}} synthesize prostaglandins, phospholipids, and vitamins, among many other things. Further, palmitic acid, which is created by the beta-ketoacyl-synthases on type I FAS, is used in a number of biological capacities. It is a precursor of both stearic and <b>palmitoleic</b> acids. <b>Palmitoleic</b> can subsequently be used to create a number of other fatty acids. Palmitic acid is also used to synthesize sphingosines, which play a role in cell membranes.|$|E
50|$|Examples of {{unsaturated}} {{fatty acids}} are <b>palmitoleic</b> acid, oleic acid, myristoleic acid, linoleic acid, and arachidonic acid. Foods containing unsaturated fats include avocado, nuts, and vegetable oils such as canola and olive oils. Meat products contain both saturated and unsaturated fats.|$|E
50|$|Omega-7 {{fatty acids}} are {{a class of}} {{unsaturated}} fatty acids in which the site of unsaturation is seven carbon atoms {{from the end of}} the carbon chain. The two most common omega-7 fatty acids in nature are <b>palmitoleic</b> acid and vaccenic acid.|$|E
50|$|Mink oil is {{a source}} of <b>palmitoleic</b> acid, which {{possesses}} physical properties similar to human sebum. Because of this, mink oil is used in several medical and cosmetic products. Mink oil is also used for treating, conditioning and preserving nearly all kinds of leather.|$|E
50|$|The lipokine <b>palmitoleic</b> acid (C16:1n7-palmitoleate) {{travels to}} the muscles and liver, where it {{improves}} cell sensitivity to insulin and blocks fat accumulation in the liver. In addition, researchers observed that palmitoleate suppresses inflammation, which {{is considered by many}} to be a primary factor leading to metabolic disease.|$|E
50|$|Compared {{with other}} common edible nuts, such as almonds and cashews, {{macadamias}} {{are high in}} total fat and relatively low in protein (table). They have a high amount of monounsaturated fats (59% of total content, table) and contain, as 17% of total fat, the monounsaturated fat, omega-7 <b>palmitoleic</b> acid.|$|E
5000|$|Oils {{from sea}} {{buckthorn}} seeds and pulp differ considerably in fatty acid composition. While linoleic acid and α-linolenic acid {{are the major}} fatty acids in seed oil, sea buckthorn pulp oil contains approximately 65% combined of the monounsaturated fatty acid, <b>palmitoleic</b> acid, and the saturated fatty acid, palmitic acid.|$|E
50|$|The oil is {{semi-solid}} at {{room temperature}} and {{does not have a}} strong odor. Gas-liquid chromatography analysis has shown the oil to contain the following fatty acids - hydnocarpic acid, chaulmoogric acid, gorlic acid, lower cyclic homologues, myristic acid, palmitic acid, stearic acid, <b>palmitoleic</b> acid, oleic acid, linoleic acid and linolenic acid.|$|E
50|$|In Knock-out mice studies, DECR1−/− {{subjects}} accumulate significant {{concentrations of}} mono and polyunsaturated fatty acids {{in the liver}} during fasting (such as oleic acid, <b>palmitoleic</b> acid, linoleic acid, and linolenic acid). Mutant subjects were also found to have poor tolerance to cold, decrease in diurnal activity, and an overall reduction in adaptation to metabolic stressors.|$|E
50|$|The grease of the bacuri oil {{has a high}} {{absorption}} rate, due to {{its high}} level of tripalmitin (50% to 55%), which penetrates the skin quickly. The high amount of fatty <b>palmitoleic</b> acid (5%), compared to other oils (less {{than or equal to}} 0.5 to 1.5%), makes the bacuri oil useful as an emollient and moisturizing agent.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Palmitoleic</b> acid, or (9Z)-hexadec-9-enoic acid, is an omega-7 {{monounsaturated}} {{fatty acid}} with the formula CH3(CH2)5CH=CH(CH2)7COOH that is a common constituent of the glycerides of human adipose tissue. It is present in all tissues but, in general, found in higher concentrations in the liver. It is biosynthesized from palmitic acid {{by the action of}} the enzyme delta-9 desaturase.|$|E
5000|$|Anaerobic {{bacteria}} dominate {{within a}} body following death, which promote the anaerobic degradation of fatty acids by hydrogenation. [...] The process of hydrogenation transforms unsaturated bonds (double and triple bonds) into single bonds. This essentially increases {{the amounts of}} saturated fatty acids, while decreasing the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids. Therefore, hydrogenation of oleic and <b>palmitoleic</b> acids, for example, will yield stearic, and palmitic acids, respectively.|$|E
50|$|An isotope {{labeling}} {{study in}} humans {{concluded that the}} fraction of dietary stearic acid that oxidatively desaturates to oleic acid is 2.4 {{times higher than the}} fraction of palmitic acid analogously converted to <b>palmitoleic</b> acid.Also, stearic acid is less likely to be incorporated into cholesterol esters.In epidemiologic and clinical studies, stearic acid was found to be associated with lowered LDL cholesterol in comparison with other saturated fatty acids.|$|E
50|$|Macadamia oil {{contains}} approximately 60% oleic acid, 19% <b>palmitoleic</b> acid, 1-3% {{linoleic acid}} and 1-2% α-linolenic acid. Some varieties contain roughly equal omega-6 and omega-3. Although macadamia is cultivated {{in many different}} parts of the world, the oil's fatty acid profile is not greatly influenced by environmental factors. The oil displays chemical properties typical of a vegetable triglyceride oil. It is also very stable due to its low polyunsaturated fat content.|$|E
50|$|Sapienic acid (16:1, n-10, cis-6 hexadecenoic, or sapienate) is a {{fatty acid}} {{that is a}} major {{component}} of human sebum. Sapienic acid is a sebum fatty acid that is unique to humans (from whose scientific name it takes the root sapiens). The equivalent fatty acid in mouse sebum is <b>palmitoleic</b> acid. Sapienic acid has been implicated in the development of acne, and it may have potent antibacterial activity.|$|E
5000|$|Lipids in {{the body}} are mainly {{contained}} in adipose tissue, which {{is made up of}} about 5-30% water, 2-3% protein, and 60-85% lipids, by weight, of which 90-99% are triglycerides. [...] Adipose tissue is largely composed of neutral lipids, which collectively refers to triglycerides, diglyercides, phospholipids, and cholesterol esters, of which triglycerides are the most common. [...] The fatty acid content of the triglycerides varies from person to person, but contains oleic acid in the greatest amount, followed by linoleic, <b>palmitoleic,</b> and palmitic acids.|$|E
50|$|The {{seeds are}} eaten raw, cooked {{in boiling water}} or toasted. The nuts contain about 12 percent protein, 49 percent oil, and 24 percent carbohydrates. The seed has a very high {{concentration}} of monounsaturated oils and is also obtained for several purposes in Chile. It is rich in antioxidants such as vitamin E (α-tocotrienol) and β-carotene. Its oil is an ingredient in some sunscreens. Gevuina oil is a used as cosmetic ingredient for its moisturizing qualities {{and because it is}} a source of omega 7 fatty acids (<b>palmitoleic</b> acid).|$|E
50|$|Rhodoferax {{species are}} Gram-negative rods, ranging in {{diameter}} from 0.5 to 0.9 µm {{with a single}} polar flagellum. The first two species described for the genus, R. fermentans and R. antarcticus, are facultative photoheterotrophs that can grow anaerobically when exposed to light and aerobically under dark conditions at atmospheric levels of oxygen. R. ferrireducens is a nonphototrophic facultative anaerobe capable of reducing Fe(III) at temperatures as low as 4 °C. All Rhodoferax species possess ubiquinone and rhodoquinone derivatives with eight unit isoprenoid side chains. Dominant fatty acids in Rhodoferax cells are <b>palmitoleic</b> acid (16:1) and palmitic acid (16:0), as well as 3-OH octanoic acid (8:0). Major carotenoids found in the phototrophic species are spheroidene, OH-spheroidene, and spirilloxanthin.|$|E
50|$|A {{research}} work {{was published in}} Industrial Engineering Chemistry Research Journal. The authors show that recovery of lipids from the alligator fat tissue was studied by solvent extraction {{as well as by}} microwave rendering. Microwave rendering resulted in oil recovery of 61% by weight of the frozen fat tissue obtained from producers. The fatty acid profile of the lipid showed that palmitic acid (C16:0), <b>palmitoleic</b> acid (C16:1), and oleic acid (C18:1) were the dominant fatty acids accounting for 89-92% of all lipids by mass; 30% of the fatty acids were saturated and 70% were unsaturated. The biodiesel produced from alligator oil was found to meet the ASTM specifications of biodiesel concerning kinematic viscosity, sulfur, free and total glycerin, flash point, cloud point, and acid number.|$|E

50|$|Total {{phospholipids}} {{range from}} 3.9 to 10.3% of the oil, {{with a mean}} of 6.0%. Mean sterol percent is 0.9 and ranges from 0.6% of the total oil for 178-18RS-10 accession to 1.2% for Everglades 71. Palmitic (20.1% of the total fatty acids), oleic (29.2%), and linoleic (45.9%) are the major fatty acids, and <b>palmitoleic</b> (1.6%), linolenic (0.7%), and stearic (3.5%) acids are the minor components. Medium (C12-C14) and long (C22-C24) chain fatty acids are less than 1%. Sphingomyelin (4.42% of the total phospholipids), phosphatidyl ethanolamine (12.8%), phosphatidyl choline (21.9%), phosphatidyl serine (2.9%), phosphatidyl inositol (2.7%), lysophosphatidyl choline (5.3%), phosphatidyl glycerol (8.9%), phosphatidic acid (4.9%), and cardiolipin (3.6%) were identified in the nine genotypes. Phosphatidyl choline, phosphatidyl ethanolamine, and phosphatidyl glycerol are the dominant phospholipids. In addition, eight unidentified phospholipids were also found, β-sitosterol (72.3% of the total sterols), campsterol (9.9%), and stigmasterol (6.07%) being prevalent among the kenaf genotypes. Kenaf's relatively high oil content and its similarity to cottonseed oil suggest that the seed oil may be used as a source of edible oil. The variation among genotypes indicates potential for genetic improvement in oil yield and quality.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background Studies have {{demonstrated}} the beneficial effect of <b>palmitoleic</b> acid (C 16 : 1 n- 7) on reducing muscle insulin resistance and preventing beta-cell apoptosis. However, the effect of <b>palmitoleic</b> acid on diabetes remains to be elucidated. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the antidiabetic effect of <b>palmitoleic</b> acid in KK-A y mice, a spontaneous model for studies of obese type 2 diabetes with low insulin sensitivity. Methods KK-A y mice were orally administered vehicle, 300 mg/kg of <b>palmitoleic</b> acid, or 300 mg/kg of palmitic acid (C 16 : 0) on a daily basis for 4 weeks. Results <b>Palmitoleic</b> acid reduced body weight increase, ameliorated the development of hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia, and improved insulin sensitivity. In addition, hepatic characteristics were significantly affected, as weight of the liver and hepatic triglyceride levels were lower in the <b>palmitoleic</b> acid group when compared to the control (vehicle and palmitic acid groups). Oil red O staining clearly indicated reduced hepatic lipid accumulation in response to <b>palmitoleic</b> acid. Furthermore, <b>palmitoleic</b> acid down-regulated mRNA expressions of proinflammatory adipocytokine genes (TNFα and resistin) in white adipose tissue and lipogenic genes (SREBP- 1, FAS, and SCD- 1) in liver. Conclusions These results suggest that <b>palmitoleic</b> acid improves hyperglycemia and hypertriglyceridemia by increasing insulin sensitivity, in part owing to suppressing proinflammatory gene expressions and improving hepatic lipid metabolism in diabetic mice. </p...|$|E
