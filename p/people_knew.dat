5|$|Common names include gillbird, gilly warbler, barkingbird, muttonbird, butcherbird, what's o {{clock and}} chock. Unlike many species in southwestern Australia, the red wattlebird was given names {{by the local}} {{indigenous}} people that were onomatopoeic (sounding like the calls they make). Names recorded include wodjalok, durdal, doongorok, and djoongong (this last name is also applied to the western wattlebird). In the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, the local Barngarla <b>people</b> <b>knew</b> it as ngarkarko or ngarkabukko. The local people of Denial Bay in South Australia called it noggal, and the Ngarrindjeri people of the Lower Murray region in South Australia knew it as rungkan.|$|E
5|$|Suspicion {{moved to}} Beauchamp, {{as he was}} loyal to the Old Court Party, and was known to hate Sharp for his {{political}} principles. <b>People</b> <b>knew</b> of Sharp's earlier alleged involvement with Anna Cooke before her marriage to Beauchamp. Witnesses placed Beauchamp in Frankfort {{the night of the}} killing, and his host, Joel Scott, said that he had heard Beauchamp leave the house during the night. After presenting preliminary testimony, Commonwealth's Attorney Charles Bibb asked for additional time to assemble more witnesses. Beauchamp assented to the request. A second delay pushed the hearings back to mid-December.|$|E
5|$|While Jenner was alive, {{very few}} <b>people</b> <b>knew</b> of him, {{and the effects}} of his evangelism were largely unrecognised. After his death, however, stories about his evangelism {{circulated}} widely. Stories of his evangelistic activities generated a largely oral tradition, and elements of some stories contradicted others. Many storytellers said that Jenner was small in stature and that he had white hair; this description is contradicted by interviews with family members.|$|E
50|$|For instance, say {{a team of}} 30 people {{produces}} {{bread in}} three necessary steps: mixing ingredients, kneading the dough, and baking. 10 <b>people</b> <b>know</b> how to mix ingredients, all 30 <b>people</b> <b>know</b> how to knead the dough, and 5 <b>people</b> <b>know</b> how to bake. If all 5 <b>people</b> who <b>know</b> how to bake disappear, then the team can not produce bread, so the team's bus factor is 5.|$|R

25|$|The tone of {{the piece}} {{is to ensure that}} the citizenry would not backslide into their old monarchical ways. In particular, Milton relied on {{predictions}} of the future combined with biblical analogies to ensure that <b>people</b> <b>knew</b> the dangers inherent in such a governmental system. In particular, Milton argued {{that it would be a}} sin against God to bring back the monarchy and warned against the lack of freedom and virtue that would correspond with a king. The second edition emphasises the prophetic qualities of the work.|$|E
25|$|Early in the investigation, {{the police}} felt {{confident}} that the assailant or assailants {{were familiar with the}} victims and that the victims probably knew their killer. The investigators theorized that the time of the killings had not been coincidental. Based on the fact that only a handful of <b>people</b> <b>knew</b> that Anne would be visiting on that precise time, the investigators concluded that the killer had the house under careful surveillance, and acting when seeing her car parked outside. The main theory is that Anne Orderud Paust was the main target of the killer or killers.|$|E

25|$|Jewitt gives a {{thorough}} {{description of the}} village of Nootka in Friendly Cove, the appearance and construction of the longhouses, and the geography of the surrounding terrain (starting p.59). The Spanish had occupied the area a generation before, forced the people to migrate a few miles away, and built a garrison called Fort San Miguel. With the Nootka Conventions of the 1790s, an agreement signed in Europe and of which the indigenous <b>people</b> <b>knew</b> nothing, the Spanish left and the Nootka returned to their village. The foundations {{of the church and}} the governor's house and the remnants of the kitchen garden were visible during Jewitt's time there.|$|E
25|$|With {{the success}} of the Captain America character, Simon said he felt that Goodman was not paying the pair the promised {{percentage}} of profits, and so sought work {{for the two of them}} at National Comics Publications (later renamed DC Comics). Kirby and Simon negotiated a deal that would pay them a combined $500 a week, as opposed to the $75 and $85 they respectively earned at Timely. The pair feared Goodman would not pay them if he found they were moving to National, but many <b>people</b> <b>knew</b> of their plan, including Timely editorial assistant, Stan Lee. When Goodman eventually discovered it, he told Simon and Kirby to leave after finishing work on Captain America Comics #10.|$|E
25|$|During {{its design}} and development, the Northrop B-2 {{program was a}} gray project before its revelation to the public.

Both during development and in service, there has been considerable importance placed to the security of the B-2 and its technologies. Staff working on the B-2 in most, if not all, capacities have to achieve a level of special-access clearance, and undergo extensive background checks carried out by a special branch of the Air Force.|$|E

25|$|Penicillin {{had been}} {{discovered}} in 1928, and {{in the years that}} followed, antibiotics were increasingly used to fight bacterial illness. However, one side effect was that these antibiotics allowed for a rapid growth of fungus, which could lead to sore mouths or upset stomachs. Other fungal diseases without cures including infections attacking the central nervous system, athlete’s foot, and ring worms were also a major problem during this time. However, fungal diseases were not well understood at this time, and there were no antifungal medications safe for human use. At this time, <b>people</b> <b>knew</b> of microorganisms called actinomycetes that lived in soil and were known to produce antibiotics, some of which killed fungus. However, these antibiotics also proved fatal in tests involving lab mice and thus could not be put into production.|$|E
25|$|In January 1827, Pathkiller, the Cherokee's {{principal}} {{chief and}} last hereditary chief, and, two weeks later, Charles R. Hicks, Ross's mentor, both died. Ross, {{as president of}} the National Committee and Major Ridge, as speaker of the National Council, were responsible for the affairs of the tribe. In a letter dated February 23, 1827, to Colonel Hugh Montgomery, the Cherokee agent, Ross wrote that with the death of Hicks, he had assumed responsibility for all public business of The Nation. Charles Hicks' brother William served briefly as interim chief until a permanent chief could be elected. Although he believed he was the natural heir to his brother's position, William Hicks had not impressed the tribe with his abilities. A majority of the <b>people</b> <b>knew</b> that during the year Ross, not Hicks, had taken care of all of the mundane business of the tribe. On October 17, 1828 the Cherokee elected John Ross as principal chief.|$|E
25|$|Madame Patti has {{practically}} {{opened the}} Severn Tunnel… It {{is true that}} very few <b>people</b> <b>knew</b> it, and perhaps Madame Patti herself did not know it, but everybody {{will be talking about}} it to everybody else. The facts are these. On Sunday Madame Patti and party—a large one—wanted to get from London to Neath with comfort and speed. A special train was arranged for, and the great songstress paid for it out of her own pocket, or wherever she keeps the great piles of money she has made. Many people will be interested to know that the special train ran along the new route through the Severn Tunnel, and that the whole distance from Paddington to Neath was comfortably traversed in four hours and twelve minutes. This was the first through train from London to South Wales via Bristol and the Severn Tunnel, and Madame Patti chartered it, rode in it, and paid for it, and therefore she has the honour of having opened the Severn Tunnel route to London.|$|E

25|$|Papen was {{a member}} of the highly {{exclusive}} Deutscher Herrenklub (German Gentlemen's Club) of Arthur Moeller van den Bruck. Papen, a man completely unknown to the general public, was well known in elite circles in Berlin for his sense of style which together with his colorful and much embellished recounting of his adventures in Mexico, the United States, Canada, Flanders, France and the Ottoman Empire in the World War and his capacity to tell a seemingly endless number of jokes all combined to make a much sought after dinner guest among the elite. Most <b>people</b> <b>knew</b> that the more fanciful exploits Papen described were exaggerations, if not fabrications, but Papen was such an entertaining raconteur who excelled at light conversation that few cared. At the Deutscher Herrenklub, Papen would spend hours drinking and talking with his best friend General Kurt von Schleicher who enjoyed his company. Schleicher and his friends liked to call Papen Fränzchen, a somewhat disparaging diminutive of his name Franz, but the French ambassador André François-Poncet who also a member of the Herrenklub noted:"Papen sometimes served as the butt of their jokes; they enjoyed making fun of and teasing him, without him taking the least offense".|$|E
25|$|Many {{major events}} have {{occurred}} at Our Chalet and in Adelboden, {{such as the}} Quo Vadis Council of 1933 for national and international Guiding leaders, World Committee conferences, and International Training seminars. In 1934, the first International Brownie Training, for training leaders of young girls, {{was held at the}} Chalet and the eighth World Conference, for Guiding leaders, took place at the Hotel Regina in Adelboden. The first Round Table of Trainers, for training people who do training, was held at Our Chalet in 1935. In the late 1930s, an International Ranger Conference—for Guides involved in high adventure programs, a Round Table for Ranger Captains—for Ranger leaders, a Round Table for Brown Owls—for leaders of the young girls' Brownie program, and more Quo Vadis Councils were held. In 1938 the tenth World Conference was held in Adelboden. By the time the second Round Table of Trainers was held in the spring of 1939, <b>people</b> <b>knew</b> it might be the last major international event for a while as the storm clouds of war were gathering. In August 1986, the first Helen Storrow Seminar was held. Each Helen Storrow Seminar focuses on a different theme, such as the rights and responsibilities of women or how women can fight HIV and AIDS.|$|E
25|$|On November 8, 1997, one {{day before}} Survivor Series, McMahon met with Pat Patterson and Michaels {{in a hotel room}} in Montreal and planned the screwjob. It is unclear how many <b>people</b> <b>knew</b> of the {{impending}} screwjob, but McMahon's close aides Gerald Brisco and Sgt. Slaughter had been involved in the planning. Jim Ross has insisted {{that he did not know}} the screwjob would take place, although many, including various members of Hart's family, thought he was involved. In a radio interview, Ross also confirmed that Jerry Lawler also did not know that the screwjob would take place. Hart and Michaels had met with Pat Patterson to discuss the match setup and plan, during which Hart agreed to allow Michaels to put him into the Sharpshooter hold at a time when the referee would be unconscious, as Patterson suggested. The rest of the match was planned to proceed thus: Hart would grab Michaels' foot and reverse the hold, putting him in the Sharpshooter. Michaels would submit to the hold, but the referee would still be unconscious. Hart would let go of the hold to try to revive the referee, but Michaels would hit Hart with his finisher, Sweet Chin Music, and make the pin. A second referee would then run to the ring with Owen Hart, Jim Neidhart, and Davey Boy Smith following close behind. The second referee would start the count, but Owen and Davey Boy would break the pin. The original referee would then recover and start to make the count, but Hart would kick out, setting up about five more minutes of brawling that would result in a disqualification.|$|E

25|$|The first Pro Spectacular was {{launched}} in Reno, Nevada on January 4, 1985. While a critical success, the racing was exciting with the ABA put on its usual show of efficiency and the pros generally liked the concept (although the track itself was too tight and ungroomed for their taste) and more than enough pros participated to make it interesting (the ABA dropped its vaunted Direct Transfer System and ran the qualifying motos three times just like the National Bicycle League). In an effort to enhance the awards, $10,000 purses for each race was offered. The winner of the Pro Spectacular series would win a Pontiac Trans Am, just like {{the winner of the}} ABA No. 1 pro plate for the year. The spectator attendance, which was the key, were lackluster. Despite the relatively low admission fee at $5.00, which was about the same as the racer's sign up fee at a local race and the heavy promotion the venues were, if not empty was well below seating capacity. At the first event held at the Lawlor Events Center of the University of Nevada in Reno, Nevada, only about 2,000 spectators were on hand in a facility that could seat 10,000. Many in the crowd were probably there for the standard National that was to be held the next day (those who signed up to race in the National the next day got a discount on the spectator's fee in the Pro Spectacular). Perhaps it was a losing situation from the start. Not enough <b>people</b> <b>knew</b> about the existence of BMX to care and bicycle racing of any type hasn't been big in the United States since the 1920s indoor track racing fad. In Europe by comparison capacity crowds fill venues and racers are front page news in Europe, even previously unknown BMX racers. The same was true for South America. As a comparison the 1983 International Bicycle Motocross Federation (IBMXF) sanctioned World Championship held in Slagharen, the Netherlands drew an incredible (by US standards) 15 to 20,000 paying spectators and was televised live in Europe. In the US you would be lucky to get a mention in sports section of an American newspaper for any form of cycling outside of yearly reporting of the Tour de France, never mind a BMX race. It seems ironic that BMX was invented in the United States in light of the lackluster attitude of the public at large toward cycling. However, {{when you look at the}} fact that BMX wasn't so much derived from cycling but from kids imitating motocross racing then it is much more understandable why BMX was invented here. Still, it was cycling even if it was aping Motocross. In that light, despite the expensive 68 30 second TV advertisements shown on then popular programs like Magnum, P.I., Dynasty and Good Morning America, it was a steep uphill battle to win over the public. The light attendance most likely did not justify the reputed $4000 in television advertising the ABA invested. The most successful of the Spectaculars in terms of non racer attendance was the fifth round held in Phoenix, Arizona on February 8. Albeit a far cry from the 15 to 20,000 that came to see the IBMXF World Championship in the Netherlands, it did draw 2,600 paying spectators despite Phoenix's first snow fall in seven years. However, considering the cost of renting the arena with the deliberate lack of amateur involvement and hence their entrance fees it was a financial burden the ABA could ill afford. By the time of Land of Lincoln Pro Spectacular on April 28, the last in the series, they had dropped the TV advertisement campaign, as a result only a few dozen of spectators were on hand for the event at the Coliseum State Fair Grounds in Springfield, Illinois. To help defray the cost, the ABA started to run a few selected Amateur open classes to collect entry fees to offset at least partially the losses.|$|E
