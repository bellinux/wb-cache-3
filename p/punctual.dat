5|$|Eurostar's {{punctuality}} has fluctuated {{from year}} to year, but usually remains over 90%; {{in the first quarter}} of 1999, 89% of services operated were on time, and in the second quarter it reached 92%. Eurostar's best punctuality record was 97.35%, between 16 and 22 August 2004. In 2006, it was 92.7%, and in 2007, 91.5% were on time. In the first quarter of 2009, 96% of Eurostar services were <b>punctual</b> compared with rival air routes' 76%.|$|E
5|$|From his Oxford years onward, Auden's friends uniformly {{described}} him as funny, extravagant, sympathetic, generous, and, partly by his own choice, lonely. In groups he was often dogmatic and overbearing in a comic way; in more private settings he was diffident and shy except when certain of his welcome. He was <b>punctual</b> in his habits, and obsessive about meeting deadlines, while choosing to live amidst physical disorder.|$|E
5|$|Lactarius {{is mainly}} {{known from the}} north {{temperate}} zone, but some species also occur in tropical Asia and Africa. Lactifluus has a more tropical distribution than Lactarius, with most species known from tropical Africa, Asia, South America, and Australasia, but some also occurring in the north temperate zone. Multifurca is the rarest among the four mushroom genera, known only from some <b>punctual</b> records in North and Central America, Asia, and Australasia.|$|E
25|$|Alitalia was {{nominated}} as Europe's most <b>punctual</b> airline in 2010, {{and as one}} of the world's five most <b>punctual</b> airlines in 2011.|$|E

25|$|The suffix of {{a verbal}} complex can {{indicate}} {{one of the}} following eight categories: past actual <b>punctual,</b> past actual continuous or future positive continuous, past irrealis, present actual, present irrealis, future positive <b>punctual,</b> future negative, or imperative. Positive and irrealis forms require the potential prefix u-.|$|E
25|$|Compared {{with air}} transport, the Shinkansen has several advantages, {{including}} scheduling frequency and flexibility, <b>punctual</b> operation, comfortable seats, and convenient city-center terminals.|$|E
25|$|Poirot is {{extremely}} <b>punctual</b> and carries a pocket watch {{almost to the}} end of his career. He is also particular about his personal finances, preferring to keep a bank balance of 444pounds, 4 shillings, and 4 pence.|$|E
25|$|The neural {{representation}} for speech units {{occurring in}} the speech sound map (see below: DIVA model) is a <b>punctual</b> or local representation. Each speech item or speech unit is represented here by a specific neuron (model cell, see below).|$|E
25|$|The college, {{as well as}} the {{leadership}} staff, has a system of pupil prefects and leaders. Every year the school allocates roles to the highest achieving, most <b>punctual</b> and attendant pupils. There is also a Head Boy and Head Girl elected each year.|$|E
25|$|The TGV {{high-speed}} rail network, train à grande vitesse is a fast rail transport which serves several {{areas of the}} country and is self-financing. There are plans to reach most parts of France and many other destinations in Europe in coming years. Rail services to major destinations are <b>punctual</b> and frequent.|$|E
25|$|While {{drunkenness}} {{was still}} an accepted part {{of life in the}} 18th century, the 19th century would bring a change in attitudes as a result of increasing industrialization and the need for a reliable and <b>punctual</b> work force. Self-discipline was needed in place of self-expression, and task orientation had to replace relaxed conviviality. Drunkenness would come to be defined as a threat to industrial efficiency and growth.|$|E
25|$|In October 2008, Luxair {{decided to}} place an order for its first Boeing 737–800. This {{aircraft}} replaced the last Boeing 737–500 in Luxair's fleet and facilitated Luxair's offer on its holiday destinations. In 2009, the airline was awarded as the most <b>punctual</b> scheduled operator at London City Airport during 2008 by Flight on Time, based on CAA statistics. In 2011 Luxair carried 1,302,771 passengers.|$|E
25|$|Hemmer {{noted that}} the coal company, which had been quite <b>punctual</b> in its {{dealings}} with the media throughout the rescue attempt, had not given any information to corroborate the allegations that 12 miners had been rescued, and that the always-available Manchin {{was nowhere to be}} found, yet the cable news channels continued to report the story anyway until doctors in a hospital many miles away stated that they had had no contact with emergency service personnel about any of the miners except for McCloy.|$|E
25|$|On {{the other}} hand the speech sound map, if {{activated}} for a specific speech unit (single neuron activation; <b>punctual</b> activation), activates sensory information by synaptic projections between speech sound map and auditory target region map and between speech sound map and somatosensory target region map. Auditory and somatosensory target regions {{are assumed to be}} located in higher-order auditory cortical regions and in higher-order somatosensory cortical regions respectively. These target region sensory activation patterns - which exist for each speech unit - are learned during speech acquisition (by imitation training; see below: learning).|$|E
25|$|The {{divisions}} of the lunar geologic time scale {{are based on the}} recognition of a few convenient geomorphological markers. While these divisions are extremely useful for ordering geological events in a relative manner, it is important to realize that the boundaries do not imply any fundamental change of geological processes. Furthermore, as the oldest geological periods of the Moon are based exclusively on the times of individual impact events (in particular, Nectaris, Imbrium, and Orientale), these <b>punctual</b> events will most likely not correspond to any specific geological event on the other terrestrial planets, such as Mercury, Venus, Earth, or Mars.|$|E
25|$|As {{for plants}} and animals, fungal hybrids and polyploids display {{structural}} and functional modifications {{compared to their}} progenitors and diploid counterparts. In particular, the structural and functional outcomes of polyploid Saccharomyces genomes strikingly reflect the evolutionary fate of plant polyploid ones. Large chromosomal rearrangements leading to chimeric chromosomes have been described, {{as well as more}} <b>punctual</b> genetic modifications such as gene loss. The homoealleles of the allotetraploid yeast S. pastorianus show unequal contribution to the transcriptome. Phenotypic diversification is also observed following polyploidization and/or hybridization in fungi, producing the fuel for natural selection and subsequent adaptation and speciation.|$|E
25|$|In Helmand, the Afghan {{government}} {{only had}} a tenuous hold outside the provincial capital of Lashkar Gah. The NATO presence in the province was sparse, limited to 130 American soldiers undertaking <b>punctual</b> anti-terrorist missions, as part of Operation Enduring Freedom. Through the month of April, a new British unit, the Helmand Task Force, was deployed in order to counter the Taliban. The core of the fighting force was drawn from the 16th Air Assault Brigade, and in particular from the 3rd battalion, of the Parachute Regiment. Based at Camp Bastion, then under construction, the task force numbered 3,300 men, though {{only a third of}} these were combat troops.|$|E
25|$|O'Hare's {{high volume}} and crowded {{schedule}} {{can lead to}} long delays and cancellations that, due to the airport being a major hub, can have a ripple effect on air travel across North America. Official reports rank O'Hare {{as one of the}} least <b>punctual</b> airports in the United States based on percentage of delayed flights. In 2004, United Airlines and American Airlines agreed to modify their flight schedules to help reduce congestion caused by clustered arrivals and departures. Because of the air traffic departing, arriving, and near the airport, air traffic controllers at O'Hare and its nearby facilities are among the leaders in {{the world in terms of}} number of controlled flights handled per hour.|$|E
25|$|A neural mapping connects two {{cortical}} neural maps. Neural mappings (in {{contrast to}} neural pathways) store training information by adjusting their neural link weights (see artificial neuron, artificial neural networks). Neural mappings {{are capable of}} generating or activating a distributed representation (see above) of a sensory or motor state within a sensory or motor map from a <b>punctual</b> or local activation within the other map (see for example the synaptic projection from speech sound map to motor map, to auditory target region map, or to somatosensory target region map in the DIVA model, explained below; or see for example the neural mapping from phonetic map to auditory state map and motor plan state map in the ACT model, explained below and Fig. 3).|$|E
25|$|Lee's duties at Fort Monroe were varied, {{typical for}} a junior officer, and ranged from {{budgeting}} to designing buildings. Although Mary Lee accompanied {{her husband to}} Hampton Roads, she spent {{about a third of}} her time at Arlington, though the couple's first son, Custis Lee was born at Fort Monroe. Although the two were by all accounts devoted to each other, they were different in character: Robert Lee was tidy and <b>punctual,</b> qualities his wife lacked. Mary Lee also had trouble transitioning from being a rich man's daughter to having to manage a household with only one or two slaves. Beginning in 1832, Robert Lee had a close but platonic relationship with Harriett Talcott, wife of his fellow officer Andrew Talcott.|$|E
25|$|When Sir Gervase Chevenix-Gore {{writes to}} Hercule Poirot to unceremoniously summon {{him down to}} the Chevenix-Gore ancestral pile, Poirot is {{initially}} reluctant to go. However, there is something that intrigues him and so he catches the train that Sir Gervase wanted him to. On arrival, it is clear that no-one was expecting him, and, {{for the first time in}} memory, Sir Gervase himself, who is always <b>punctual,</b> is missing. Poirot and guests go to his study and find him there dead, having apparently shot himself. Poirot is not convinced, however, and soon starts to prove that Sir Gervase was murdered because of various improbable factors surrounding the death, including the position at which the bullet is believed to have struck a mirror and the many different moods that Chevenix-Gore exhibited during the day.|$|E
25|$|Bacon was a meticulous, frugal and <b>punctual</b> overseer, {{and kept}} {{a close watch}} over the daily {{activities}} at Monticello. At times he would even politely challenge Jefferson's instructions or advice as to how various activities and business should be conducted. When guests came to stay he looked after their needs {{and took care of}} fed their horses. He was once scolded by Jefferson because he was rationing feed for their horses trying to cut costs. During the entire time Bacon was in Jefferson's employ, he had permission to contact Jefferson at any time, even in his sleeping quarters if business required. However, Bacon in an interview claimed that in the twenty years of his employment, he only twice had to disturb Jefferson after he retired for the evening.|$|E
500|$|Trollope would not. [...] The Gentleman's Magazine was, in Michael Sadleir's words, [...] "a very {{inferior}} {{paper with}} a lower class of reader and a poor general reputation". Moreover, personal feelings were involved: Trollope resented the fact that he, a <b>punctual</b> Englishman, was being asked to yield to a dilatory Frenchman.|$|E
500|$|Verbal roots were {{inherently}} imperfective (durative, present) or perfective (<b>punctual,</b> aoristic). To form a verb {{from the}} root's own aspect, verb endings were attached {{directly to the}} root, either {{with or without a}} thematic vowel. The [...] "other" [...] aspect, if it was needed, would then be a so-called [...] "characterised" [...] stem, as detailed in Proto-Indo-European verb. The characterised stems are often different in different descendants, which suggests that they did not yet exist in PIE proper.|$|E
500|$|McGarty was {{suspended}} from the show in July 2012 across four weeks for [...] "persistent lateness to arrive on set". A show insider described her lateness as a big problem because it [...] "regularly held up the filming of vital scenes." [...] McGarty apologised for her lateness. In 2016, she discussed her suspension with The Sun magazine Fabulous and said her actions were [...] "lazy and irresponsible" [...] and the suspension made her realise the consequences of her actions. McGarty promised fans that she was now <b>punctual</b> for work.|$|E
500|$|A {{southern}} Indian temple at Thirukalukundram near Chengalpattu was {{famed for}} a pair of birds that reputedly visited the temple for [...] "centuries". These birds were ceremonially fed by the temple priests and arrived before noon to feed on offerings made from rice, wheat, ghee, and sugar. Although normally <b>punctual,</b> the failure of the birds to turn up was attributed to the presence of [...] "sinners" [...] among the onlookers. Legend has it the vultures (or [...] "eagles") represented eight sages who were punished by Shiva, with two of them leaving in each of a series of epochs.|$|E
500|$|ASL has a rich {{system of}} verbal inflection. This {{involves}} both grammatical aspect—how {{the action of}} verbs flows in time—and agreement marking. Aspect can be marked by changing the manner of movement of the verb; for example, continuous aspect is marked by incorporating rhythmic, circular movement, while <b>punctual</b> aspect is achieved by modifying the sign so {{that it has a}} stationary hand position. Verbs may agree with both the subject and the object, and are marked for number and reciprocity. Reciprocity is indicated by using two one-handed signs; for example, the sign SHOOT, made with an L-shaped handshape with inward movement of the thumb, inflects to SHOOT, articulated by having two L-shaped hands [...] "shooting" [...] at each other.|$|E
500|$|The {{massacre}} {{appeared to}} have been planned for several months if not longer. [...] In August 1989, Lépine picked up an application for a firearms-acquisition certificate, and in mid-October, he received his permit. [...] On November 21, 1989, Lépine purchased a Ruger Mini-14 semi-automatic rifle at a local sporting goods store. [...] Between October and December 1989, Lépine was seen at least seven times at the École Polytechnique. Four days before the shooting, he brought his mother a present, though it was several weeks before her birthday; he also brought a note and two bags of belongings, which she did not discover until long after the shooting. Lépine had previously always been very <b>punctual</b> paying his rent, but had not done so in December 1989.|$|E
500|$|Menon {{talked to}} The National {{about the film}} prior to its release, saying that the story was close to her heart as it was {{inspired}} by her own personal experience. On working with Koechlin and Shah she said, [...] "He (Shah) was <b>punctual</b> and always prepared, he gave his best performance in the first take. Kalki allows herself to be vulnerable. She is more porous and chilled out." [...] Menon acknowledged the chemistry of the leading duo {{and said that they}} were committed to the project and non-demanding. She described Waiting as a [...] "gentle and poignant film" [...] and said, [...] "It would make the audiences want {{to reach out to the}} leading characters and help them find their answers." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{awaiting}} official approval, Dutch planning went ahead. A {{contract with}} Ferrostaal A.G. Essen was drawn up, and on [...] {{a list of}} products for purchase in Germany was submitted. Two months later, talks were held in Bremen and Berlin (on 13 and 31July, respectively) in which the Germans agreed to release plans and drawings that, although not specifically of the Scharnhorst-class, would reveal their ideas on battlecruiser design. Delivered on 21 August of that year, these showed various modern protection schemes {{that could be used}} in the new battlecruisers. On 4 October 1939, a German admiral previously appointed as a liaison between the two navies asserted that while Germany could not guarantee <b>punctual</b> delivery dates, it could assure the Netherlands that it would pressure the companies to meet the contractual dates and that the Kriegsmarine would not interfere with orders from the same companies. A month later, Ferrostaal A.G. Essen was formally appointed as the Dutch proxy in most of their dealings with Germany; this appointment did not include Germaniawerft.|$|E
500|$|Within a year {{of moving}} to Manchester, Brady was caught with a sack full of lead seals he had stolen {{and was trying to}} smuggle out of the market. He was sent to Strangeways for three months. Because he was still under 18, he was sentenced to two years in borstal for [...] "training". He was sent to Latchmere House in London, and then Hatfield borstal in the West Riding of Yorkshire. After being {{discovered}} drunk on alcohol he had brewed he was moved to the much tougher unit at Hull. Released on 14 November 1957, Brady returned to Manchester, where he took a labouring job, which he hated, and was dismissed from another job in a brewery. Deciding to [...] "better himself", he obtained a set of instruction manuals on book-keeping from a local public library, with which he [...] "astonished" [...] his parents by studying alone in his room for hours. In January 1959, Brady applied for and was offered a clerical job at Millwards, a wholesale chemical distribution company based in Gorton. He was regarded by his colleagues as a quiet, <b>punctual,</b> but short-tempered young man. He read books including Teach Yourself German and Mein Kampf, as well as works on Nazi atrocities. He rode a Tiger Cub motorcycle, which he used to visit the Pennines.|$|E
