The most sensitive conditions have to be found for ultrasonic inspection and the measured acoustic parameters have also to be linked to the state of the complex chemical structure of polymers. Ultrasonic reflectometry is tested to investigate the thermal ageing of epoxy coatings. As function of frequency and incident angle, the most sensitive modes have been identified from simulation and validated by experiments using an ultrasonic reflection goniometer system working around 5 MHz. Scanning Acoustic Microscopy has been complementary used to check the bonding quality and the layer homogeneity. The effect of local variations of the coating thickness on the sensitivity of this acoustic reflection method is presented as well as acoustic beam diffraction limitation. Next, these 100 µm thick <b>paint</b> <b>films</b> <b>on</b> steel plates have been submitted to thermal ageing tests up to 110 °C for several weeks.
