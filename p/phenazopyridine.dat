5|$|The {{mainstay}} of treatment is antibiotics. <b>Phenazopyridine</b> is occasionally prescribed {{during the first}} few days in addition to antibiotics to help with the burning and urgency sometimes felt during a bladder infection. However, it is not routinely recommended due to safety concerns with its use, specifically an elevated risk of methemoglobinemia (higher than normal level of methemoglobin in the blood). Acetaminophen (paracetamol) may be used for fevers. There is no good evidence for the use of cranberry products for treating current infections.|$|E
5|$|In {{uncomplicated}} cases, UTIs {{are treated}} with a short course of antibiotics such as nitrofurantoin or trimethoprim/sulfamethoxazole. Resistance {{to many of the}} antibiotics used to treat this condition is increasing. In complicated cases, a longer course or intravenous antibiotics may be needed. If symptoms do not improve in two or three days, further diagnostic testing may be needed. <b>Phenazopyridine</b> may help with symptoms. In those who have bacteria or white blood cells in their urine but have no symptoms, antibiotics are generally not needed, although during pregnancy is an exception. In those with frequent infections, a short course of antibiotics may be taken as soon as symptoms begin or long-term antibiotics may be used as a preventative measure.|$|E
25|$|Certain {{medications}} such as rifampin and <b>phenazopyridine</b> {{can cause}} orange urine.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenazopyridine's</b> {{mechanism}} of action is not well known, and only basic information on its interaction with the body is available. It is known that the chemical has a direct topical analgesic effect on the mucosa lining of the urinary tract. It is rapidly excreted by the kidneys directly into the urine. Hydroxylation is the major form of metabolism in humans, and the azo bond is usually not cleaved. On the order of 65% of an oral dose will be excreted directly into the urine chemically unchanged.|$|R
25|$|Many {{substances}} {{are potentially}} harmful {{to people with}} G6PD deficiency. Variation {{in response to these}} substances makes individual predictions difficult. Antimalarial drugs that can cause acute hemolysis in people with G6PD deficiency include primaquine, pamaquine, and chloroquine. There is evidence that other antimalarials may also exacerbate G6PD deficiency, but only at higher doses. Sulfonamides (such as sulfanilamide, sulfamethoxazole, and mafenide), thiazolesulfone, methylene blue, and naphthalene should also be avoided by people with G6PD deficiency as they antagonize folate synthesis, as should certain analgesics (such as <b>phenazopyridine</b> and acetanilide) and a few non-sulfa antibiotics (nalidixic acid, nitrofurantoin, isoniazid, dapsone, and furazolidone). Henna has been known to cause hemolytic crisis in G6PD-deficient infants. Rasburicase is also contraindicated in G6PD deficiency. High dose intravenous vitamin C has also been known to cause haemolysis in G6PD deficiency carriers, thus G6PD deficiency testing is routine before infusion of doses of 25g or more.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenazopyridine</b> {{produces}} a vivid color change in urine, typically {{to a dark}} orange to reddish color. This effect is common and harmless, and indeed a key indicator {{of the presence of}} the medication in the body. Users of <b>phenazopyridine</b> are warned not to wear contact lenses, as <b>phenazopyridine</b> has been known to permanently discolor contact lenses and fabrics. Some may be mistakenly concerned that this indicated blood in the urine.|$|E
50|$|It can {{be caused}} by <b>phenazopyridine.</b>|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenazopyridine</b> is a {{chemical}} which, when excreted into the urine, has a local analgesic effect. It {{is often used}} to alleviate the pain, irritation, discomfort, or urgency caused by urinary tract infections, surgery, or injury to the urinary tract. <b>Phenazopyridine</b> was discovered by Bernhard Joos, the founder of Cilag.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenazopyridine</b> is an azo dye. Other azo dyes, {{which were}} {{previously}} used in textiles, printing, and plastic manufacturing, have been implicated as carcinogens {{that can cause}} bladder cancer. While <b>phenazopyridine</b> has never been shown to cause cancer in humans, evidence from animal models {{suggests that it is}} potentially carcinogenic.|$|E

50|$|The American Urological Association has {{recommended}} {{the use of}} <b>phenazopyridine</b> as a first stage treatment for interstitial cystitis.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenazopyridine</b> is {{prescribed}} for its local analgesic {{effects on the}} urinary tract. It is sometimes {{used in conjunction with}} an antibiotic or other anti-infective medication at the beginning of treatment to help provide immediate symptomatic relief. <b>Phenazopyridine</b> does not treat infections or injury; it is only used for symptom relief. It is recommended that it be used for no longer than the first two days of antibacterial treatment as longer treatment may mask symptoms.|$|E
50|$|This {{medication}} is pregnancy category B. This {{means that the}} medication has shown no adverse events in animal models, but no human trials have been conducted. It is not known if <b>phenazopyridine</b> is excreted in breast milk.|$|E

50|$|The full {{pharmacokinetic}} {{properties of}} <b>phenazopyridine</b> {{have not been}} determined. It has mostly been studied in animal models, {{but they may not}} be very representative of humans. Rat models have shown its half-life to be 7.35 hours, and 40% is metabolized hepatically (by the liver).|$|E
50|$|This {{medication}} {{is not used}} to treat infection and may mask symptoms of inappropriately treated UTI. It provides symptom relief during a UTI, following surgery, or injury to the urinary tract. UTI therapy {{should be limited to}} 1-2 days. Long-term use of <b>phenazopyridine</b> can mask symptoms.|$|E
50|$|Formed by the {{adhesion}} of metabolic {{breakdown products}} or drug pigments, these casts are so named {{due to their}} discoloration. Pigments include those produced endogenously, such as hemoglobin in hemolytic anemia, myoglobin in rhabdomyolysis, and bilirubin in liver disease. Drug pigments, such as <b>phenazopyridine,</b> may also cause cast discoloration.|$|E
50|$|Sulfafurazole (INN, {{also known}} as sulfisoxazole) is a sulfonamide {{antibacterial}} with an oxazole substituent. It has antibiotic activity against {{a wide range of}} Gram-negative and Gram-positive organisms. It is sometimes given in combination with erythromycin (see erythromycin/Sulfafurazole) or <b>phenazopyridine.</b> It is used locally in a 4% solution or ointment.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenazopyridine</b> is also {{prescribed}} for other cases requiring relief from irritation or discomfort during urination. For example, {{it is often}} prescribed after {{the use of an}} in-dwelling Foley catheter, endoscopic (cystoscopy) procedures, or after urethral, prostate, or urinary bladder surgery which may result in irritation of the epithelial lining of the urinary tract.|$|E
5000|$|He {{attained}} a PhD in chemistry at the University of Zurich in 1925, {{and was an}} assistant of Paul Karrer, who won the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 1937. After a stay in the USA, Joos returned to Switzerland in 1932 and started his own laboratory where he discovered the analgesic properties of <b>phenazopyridine</b> (later branded as Pyridazil).|$|E
50|$|Double {{dye test}} {{is useful for}} {{diagnosing}} vesicovaginal or ureterovaginal fistulae. For this test, the patient takes oral <b>phenazopyridine</b> (Pyridium) 200 mg three times a day, and indigo carmine or methylene blue is filled into the empty urinary bladder via a urethral catheter. Pyridium turns urine orange in the kidneys, and methylene blue (or indigo carmine) turns urine blue in the bladder.|$|E
50|$|<b>Phenazopyridine</b> {{should be}} avoided by people with glucose-6-phosphate {{dehydrogenase}} deficiency, because it can cause hemolysis (destruction of red blood cells) due to oxidative stress. It {{has been reported to}} cause methemoglobinemia after overdose and even normal doses. In at least one case the patient had pre-existing low levels of methemoglobin reductase, which likely predisposed her to the condition. It has also been reported to cause sulfhemoglobinemia.|$|E
50|$|False {{positive}} reactions can {{be due to}} unusual pigments in the urine (for example, yellowy orange <b>phenazopyridine</b> metabolites, indican and the metabolites of the medicine Lodine (Etodolac)). False negatives can also be given by poorly stored samples as the bilirubin is photosensitive and undergoes photo oxidation to biliverdin when it is exposed to light, or hydrolysis of the glucuronide can occur producing free bilirubin which is less reactive.|$|E
50|$|Physicians {{may also}} {{prescribe}} an oral urinary analgesic, <b>phenazopyridine</b> {{or a combination}} (urinary) analgesic/anti-infective/anti-spasmodic medication containing methylene blue, methanamine, hyoscyamine sulfate and phenyl salicylate for irritation and/or dysuria patients may experience after the procedure. At two weeks post-procedure, the practitioner may order a follow-up evaluation including {{a repeat of the}} urinalysis with cultures and sensitivities, and a uroflowmetric study (which evaluates the volume of urine released from the body, the speed with which it is released, and how long the release takes).|$|E

50|$|<b>Phenazopyridine</b> {{can also}} cause headaches, upset stomach (especially when not taken with food), or dizziness. Less {{frequently}} it can cause a pigment change in the skin or eyes, to a noticeable yellowish color. This {{is due to a}} depressed excretion via the kidneys causing a buildup of the medication in the skin, and normally indicates a need to discontinue usage. Other such side effects include fever, confusion, shortness of breath, skin rash, and swelling of the face, fingers, feet, or legs. Long-term use may cause yellowing of nails.|$|E
50|$|Prior to {{discharge}} from the surgical facility, the patient will be instructed on proper care of the urinary drainage system, how to monitor for signs of infection, and the limitations of physical activity necessary {{for the safety of}} the patient, and the success of the procedure. A course of oral antibiotics or anti-infective agents will be prescribed. Additionally, a urinary analgesic such as <b>phenazopyridine</b> or urinary analgesic/anti-spasmodic combination containing methanamine, methylene blue, and hyoscyamine sulfate will be offered. Palliative medications may sometimes be prescribed, but are often not necessary because there is usually minimal discomfort post-procedure.|$|E

40|$|Possible {{interactions}} among drugs contemplated for use during manned spaceflights {{have been studied}} in several animal species. The following seven drugs were investigated: nitrofurantoin, chloral hydrate, hexobarbital, phenobarbital, flurazepam, diphenoxylate, and <b>phenazopyridine.</b> Particular combinations included: chloral hydrate, hexabarbital or flurazepam with nitrofurantoin; phenobarbital or flurazepam with phenazopyridine; and diphenoxylate with two does formulations of nitrofurantoin. Studies were carried out in several species to determine whether induction of liver microsomal enzymes would increase the tendency of <b>phenazopyridine</b> to produce methemoglobin in vivo. Animals were premedicated with phenobarbital, a known inducer of azoreductase, and in a separate experiment with flurazepam, before administration of <b>phenazopyridine.</b> Methemoglobin production was determined in each animal after receiving <b>phenazopyridine.</b> No evidence was found for increased production of methemoglobin in the rat, dog, or rabbit that {{could be attributed to}} increased amounts of microsomal enzymes...|$|E
