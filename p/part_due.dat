5|$|During this period, {{there was}} also {{substantially}} more interaction among the various poetic traditions, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> {{to the spread of}} European colonialism and the attendant rise in global trade. In addition to a boom in translation, during the Romantic period numerous ancient works were rediscovered.|$|E
5|$|Engelbart {{slipped into}} {{relative}} obscurity after 1976. Several of his researchers became alienated {{from him and}} left his organization for Xerox PARC, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to frustration, and in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to differing views {{of the future of}} computing. Engelbart saw the future in collaborative, networked, timeshare (client-server) computers, which younger programmers rejected in favor of the personal computer. The conflict was both technical and ideological: the younger programmers came from an era where centralized power was highly suspect, and personal computing was just barely on the horizon.|$|E

5|$|Peanut, or {{groundnut}} (Arachis hypogaea), {{originally from}} South America, {{has grown from}} a relatively minor crop {{to one of the most}} important commercial nut crops, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to the work of George Washington Carver at the beginning of the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|The Americans {{were still}} unaware {{that this was}} not the main British attack, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to the ferocity of the {{fighting}} and the number of British troops engaged.|$|E

5|$|The same year, Philip invaded Pergamon; {{although}} {{unable to}} take the easily defended city, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to precautions taken by Attalus to provide for additional fortifications, he demolished the surrounding temples and altars.|$|E
5|$|This {{rapid rise}} {{in the power of}} Macedon was in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to Philip's {{exceptional}} military and diplomatic skills. However, it was also in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to the weakened state of the major powers of Greece. Sparta had never recovered from Epaminondas's liberation of Messenia, whilst in turn Thebes was still weakened by Epaminondas's death and the aftermath of Mantinea. Athens, as discussed above, was embroiled in a war with its allies; in 355 BC, the Athenians agreed a peace that left many of its former allies independent, severely weakening Athenian power. Although these powers protested against Philip's actions, they had too many other problems to attempt any intervention; Philip thus went largely unchallenged until 354 BC.|$|E

5|$|Worker {{death is}} an {{important}} factor in colony failure, and is the cause of 13–76% of colony failures. This may be in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to the small colony size. Because the colonies are small, worker longevity is crucial for the survival of the nest.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with most}} of the Riverina region, the {{majority}} of Wagga Wagga residents supported the federation of the Australian colonies, in large <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to the prospect of free trade across colonial borders. In 1898, a group of residents promoted Wagga Wagga for consideration as the site of the future national capital due to its location equidistant from Sydney and Melbourne and its ample water supply. Despite the bid's lack of success, in the 1899 referendum Wagga Wagga residents voted strongly in favour of federation.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{tradition}} {{declined in the}} early to mid-twentieth century, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to opposition from some local Christian clergy and changing social conditions, it was revived in new forms in the mid-to-latter part of the century. The tradition has also inspired various artistic depictions, appearing, for instance, {{in the work of the}} painter Clive Hicks-Jenkins and the poet Vernon Watkins.|$|E

5|$|An {{affiliate}} of the MTV Network until then, Comedy Central decided, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> {{to the success}} of South Park, to have its own independent sales department. By the end of 1998, Comedy Central had sold more than $150 million worth of merchandise for the show, including T-shirts and dolls. Over the next few years, Comedy Central's viewership spiked largely due to South Park, adding 3 million new subscribers {{in the first half of}} 1998 alone and allowed the network to sign international deals with networks in several countries.|$|E
5|$|As {{the city}} has a high {{proportion}} of public servants, the Commonwealth Government contributes the largest percentage of Gross State Product and is the largest single employer in Canberra, although no longer the majority employer. Compared to the national averages, the unemployment rate is lower and the average income higher; tertiary education levels are higher, while the population is younger. Property prices are relatively high, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to comparatively restrictive development regulations.|$|E
5|$|Attendance was low, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to Tech fans' {{reluctance}} to travel {{across the country}} and pay high prices for the chance to do so. Travel agents indicated low business in {{the weeks leading up to}} the game, and Tech sold approximately 5,000tickets—a far lower total than the Hokies' two previous bowl games, when 25,000tickets each were sold to games in Florida and Louisiana.|$|E

5|$|Columbia {{has many}} bars and {{restaurants}} that provide diverse styles of cuisine, which is in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to it being a college town with three colleges.

5|$|Costa {{was born}} in Lagarto, Sergipe, Brazil, to parents José de Jesus and Josileide. His father named him in honour of Argentine footballer Diego Maradona despite the rivalry between the two nations, and he has an elder brother named Jair after Brazilian player Jairzinho. Despite {{regularly}} playing street football, Costa did not believe as a child that he would turn professional, in <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to the remote location of his hometown. He has since set up a football academy in his hometown, where he pays all the costs. Costa {{is a fan of}} Palmeiras.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse {{became one}} of the most {{influential}} team owners in the NFL, and was credited with modernizing the league, even while his teams were rarely competitive on the field. He oversaw the league's course of direction through two player strikes, and the modern league's financial stability is in great <b>part</b> <b>due</b> to his leadership. He held influence for over a decade, before stepping back due to criticism of what other owners saw as his overly-secretive ways.|$|E
