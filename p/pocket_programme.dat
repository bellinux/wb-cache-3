40|$|Aim: All {{around the}} world 10 - 12 million people/year receive rabies prophylaxis. Rabies is an acute fatal central nervous system viral enfection. The virus can infect all warm-blooded animals and almost in all cases the enfection results with fatal encephalitis. The {{aim of this study}} is to {{determine}} the demographic characteristics of cases with rabies risk exposures and behind this to emphasise the significance of cooperation between the institutions to perform effective and accurate treatment. Material and Method: This study was performed with retrospective analysis of 1429 cases who attended to Emergency Department of Diyarbakir Goverment Hospital between January 2007 - 2010 for animal bites and exposures with the risk of rabies. Statistical analysis of data was performed SPSS V 16 <b>pocket</b> <b>programme.</b> Data were defined as frequency and %. For statistical analysis Chi-Square and Fischer exact test was used. A value of P< 0. 05 was accepted statistically significant. Results: A total of 1055 (73. 8 %) were male, 374 (26. 2 %) were female and the mean age was 21. 75 ± 16. 9 (6 months- 87 years). The major group in children was 6 - 11 years old and 651 (% 45. 5) of the cases attended to hospital were under 18 years old. The vast majority (39. 3 %) in adults were between 19 - 49 years. In our study 808 (56. 5 %) of the cases  were bitten, 597 (41. 8 %) of the cases  were scrabbled by the animal and 24 (1. 7 %) of them  had indirect contact with the animal Both of them were taken into prophylactic vaccination programme (p< 0. 05). The vast majority of animal bites were dog (67 %)   and cat (28 %). 3 doses of Human diploid cell vaccine-HDCV were administered to 1001 (70 %) of the patients and 5 doses to 428 (30 %) of patients. Human rabies immune globulin-HRIG were administered to 475 (33, 3 %) of the patients in addition to vaccine. Discussion:  In our region rabies risk exposure is an important public health problem. Public oriented education should be given about attending to health care facilities as soon as possible in risk exposure situations...|$|E

Both square and park are outcomes of the Better Barkingside regeneration project.|$|R

As {{soon as they were}} {{ascending}} a hill, and he could find time to free his hand, he pulled off his glove, and drawing from his <b>pocket</b> a <b>programme</b> of the Melchester concert referred to, contemplated therein the name of one of the intended performers. The name was that of Mr. C. Julian. Replacing it again, he looked ahead, and some time after murmured with wily mirth, 'An excellent test--a lucky thought!' ...|$|R
50|$|The Goodwill Campaign {{was created}} in 1991 to share {{humanitarian}} and medical aid with impoverished communities in Jordan. The campaign runs a number of events throughout the country every year, typically providing free medical days, financial funding for scholarships, or toys, winter items, food, {{and other forms of}} in-kind assistance. Along with providing more immediate assistance, JOHUD also runs separate projects that tackle the source of poverty in Jordan; the <b>Pockets</b> of Poverty <b>programme</b> specifically tackles the extreme poverty found in the poorest areas through microcredit loans, infrastructure repair, and business skills classes.|$|R
40|$|The {{target of}} this thesis is data {{collection}} via pocket PC and GPS receiver, together with data processing and visualization in the OziExplorer programme. To the partial goals belongs {{the description of}} the specific parts of mobile mapping from the data collection to their visual processing in this programme. The mapping was done {{in the area of the}} national protected zone of the Boubín forest, located in the Bohemian Forest. Before the mapping, it was necessary to study the theory of the GPS system, <b>pocket</b> computer, OziExplorer <b>programme</b> and their practical usage including the operation of all the basic functions of the OziExplorer programme. The subsequent step was configuration of the measuring devices and preparation of the data for mapping. A very important part of the data preparation was a diligent calibration of scanned maps which was essential for reaching correct consecutive measurements. The data collection was done by a pocket computer ASUS A 639 with an integrated GPS antenna, operation system Windows Mobile 5. 0 CZ, and a PDA version of the programme OziExplorerCE. The data collected from the field work in the area of the national protected zone of the Boubín forest, where the measured route was the educational path called the Boubín forest, were processed in the PC programme OziExplorer. Some corrections were made and the final route was transformed to the 3 D model via the programme OziExplorer 3 D. The result of the thesis is {{the description of the}} constituent stages of the mobile mapping from the preparation and the data collecting to the visual processing in the OziExplorer programme and 3 D model of the relief of the Boubín forest...|$|R
