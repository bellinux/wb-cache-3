5|$|Mezi avant Mézières (1981) – a {{collection}} of Mézières' early work for magazines such as <b>Pilote.</b>|$|E
5|$|Valérian first {{appeared}} on 9 November 1967 in issue #420 of the Franco-Belgian comics magazine <b>Pilote,</b> and every Valérian story from Bad Dreams to The Rage of Hypsis was initially serialised in <b>Pilote.</b> The second Valérian story, The City of Shifting Waters (La Cité des Eaux Mouvantes), {{was the first to}} be collected in graphic novel album format by Dargaud. Since On the Frontiers, every Valérian story has debuted in album format. Seven short stories were also published in the digest-sized Super Pocket <b>Pilote</b> in 1969 and 1970 and later collected in Across the Pathways of Space (Par Les Chemins De l’Espace) in 1997. The series was originally published under the title Valérian: Spatio-Temporal Agent. However, with the publication of The Order of the Stones in 2007, the series now goes under the title Valérian and Laureline.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time as he has been working on Valérian and various film and {{television}} projects, Mézières has worked extensively producing illustrations and comic strips for magazines and newspapers such as <b>Pilote,</b> Métal Hurlant and Le Monde, covers for books, art for advertising campaigns, etc. For Le Monde, in 1993, he was a regular illustrator for the Heures Locales column.|$|E

5|$|Mon Amérique à moi (My Very Own America) (1974) – an 8-page autobiographical strip, first {{published}} in <b>Pilote,</b> recounting Mézières' time in America in the mid-1960s. An English translation was published {{in black and white}} in 1996 as a part of European Readings of American Popular Culture an academic publication edited by John Dean and Jean-Paul Gabillet.|$|E
5|$|When winter {{came and}} there was no work {{available}} on the ranches, he collaborated with Christin on a six-page strip called Le Rhum du Punch, a copy of which he sent to Jean Giraud who was by now writing and illustrating Blueberry for the Franco-Belgian comics magazine <b>Pilote.</b> Giraud showed the strip to Pilotes editor, Rene Goscinny, who agreed to publish it (issue 335, 24 March 1966). This was followed by another collaboration titled Comment réussir en affaires en se donnant un mal fou (How to succeed in business by almost killing oneself through hard work) which was also published in <b>Pilote</b> (issue 351, 14 July 1966). By this stage Mézières visa was almost expired and so he used the money from these strips to pay for his ticket home. In leaving America, Mézières also left behind a young woman, Linda, one of Christin's students: she followed him to France some months later and is now his wife.|$|E
5|$|On {{his return}} from the United States, Mézières visited the offices of <b>Pilote</b> {{magazine}} to see René Goscinny and Jean-Michel Charlier. Goscinny put him to work on L'extraordinaire et Troublante Aventure de Mr. August Faust (The Extraordinary and Troubling Adventure of Mr August Faust), written by Fred. This {{would be the first}} serialised strip that Mézières would work on. Due to the lack of artistic freedom he was given (because Fred's script came with all the strip panels already blocked out), Mézières found this a difficult assignment.|$|E

5|$|L'Empire des Mille Planètes (Empire of a Thousand Planets) premiered in <b>Pilote</b> in 1969 {{and marked}} a further {{development}} for the Valérian series and for Mézières art. This story was the series' first full-blown attempt at space opera and it {{set out for the}} first time the two main signature elements of Valérian: the use of science fiction as a political allegory and Mézières' meticulously detailed depictions of alien worlds. The follow-up story World Without Stars saw the final evolution of Mézières' art into the style that became prevalent in the Valerian stories of the 1970s and 1980s, with the first realistic renderings of Valérian and Laureline, as opposed to the caricatures of the earlier stories.|$|E
5|$|Mézières {{experiences}} in the United States have provided the inspiration for several magazine articles published in <b>Pilote,</b> Tintin, and GEO magazines {{as well as two}} books – Olivier chez les cow-boys (Olivier with the Cowboys), a children's book written by Pierre Christin with photographs and illustrations by Mézières about a visit Christin's son Olivier paid to the ranch Mézières worked on in Utah and Adieu, rêve américain... (Farewell, American dreams...), again written by Christin with photographs and illustrations by Mézières, a nostalgic look back at their time in the United States.|$|E
5|$|By {{this time}} Pierre Christin was {{dividing}} {{his time between}} Paris and Bordeaux, where {{he was working on}} founding the school of journalism at the Institut Universitaire de Technologie (IUT). Meeting up with Mézières one day, Christin suggested that they work on creating a comic strip together. Both had their experiences in the American West to draw upon but felt, thanks to Lucky Luke, Jerry Spring and Blueberry, that the market for Westerns was already crowded. Instead, Christin suggested that they turn their hands to science fiction, a genre that, at that time, was not prevalent in French comics. Although Goscinny was not a science fiction fan, he wanted to promote innovation and originality in <b>Pilote</b> and so commissioned them to produce a strip.|$|E

25|$|In 1970, de Beketch {{was hired}} by the Havas Conseil consultancy, where he took part in {{creating}} a media department. One-time freemason and member of the Grande Loge de France (then the Grande Loge nationale) he quickly distanced himself from freemasonry, as he often took the opportunity to explain. From 1969, René Goscinny had invited de Beketch to write theatre reviews for the weekly <b>Pilote</b> magazine. Besides this, he would write various stories in cartoon form and prepare French versions of the American offerings Eerie, Creepie and Vampirella for éditions Publicness. He also worked for the international visual arts review Zoom. In 1975, de Beketch left <b>Pilote</b> following the departure of Goscinny. He became head of information, then chief editor of Minute in 1979. He left Minute following a disagreement about the paper's new direction, and took on the role of editor-in-chief of National-Hebdo at the request of Jean-Marie le Pen.|$|E

This ichthyodectiform fossil was collected in a marl flagstone quarry on Los <b>Pilotes</b> Ranch, Muzquiz County, Coahuila. The rocks of the quarry are of Turonian age, and constitute part of the Eagle Ford Formation. This Gillicus arcuatus specimen fits within the known temporal distribution of Gillicus, but extends the geographical distribution of this species to include Northern Mexico, where once the North American Western Interior Sea and the Western Tethys Sea converged. Los <b>Pilotes</b> Ranch is the southernmost fossil locality so far known where Gillicus has been found...|$|R
