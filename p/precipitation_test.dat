40|$|The {{capacity}} of the serum of rabbits following intradermal pneumococcus infections to precipitate {{in the presence of}} pneumococcus C polysaccharide has been studied during the resultant periods of active infection and during recovery. In rabbits infected with Type I, III, or VIII pneumococci, large hemorrhagic lesions are produced which frequently bring about death of the animals after a febrile illness of 3 to 4 days. Repeated <b>precipitation</b> <b>tests</b> with the sera of these animals have been uniformly and consistently negative, not only during the acute illness but in the recovery period as well. On the other hand, the sera of monkeys of the Macacus cynomolgos species actively ill with experimental Type III pneumonia have been shown to react in <b>precipitation</b> <b>tests</b> with the C substance. The serum reaction appears within the first 24 hours after infection, remains positive in high titer for 2 to 3 days during the acute illness, and disappears with the onset of recovery. The precipitation reaction with C also occurs with the sera of monkeys following intradermal and intraperitoneal infection with pneumococci. The results of <b>precipitation</b> <b>tests</b> of the serum of monkeys during experimental pneumonia are similar to those obtained with the sera of patients suffering from pneumococcus lobar pneumonia. From the results of these studies it would appear improbable that the demonstration of the serum precipitation phenomenon with C polysaccharide in monkeys, and possibly also in man, is conditioned by previous exposure to pneumococcus antigen...|$|R

Polymyxin-lysozyme-EDTA-thallous acetate {{can be used}} to isolate B. anthracis from {{contaminated}} specimens, and bicarbonate agar is used as an identification method to induce capsule formation. Bacillus spp. usually grow within 24 hours of incubation at 35 °C, in ambient air (room temperature) or in 5% CO2. If bicarbonate agar is used for identification, then the medium must be incubated in 5% CO2. B. anthracis colonies are medium-large, gray, flat, and irregular with swirling projections, often referred to as having a [...] "medusa head" [...] appearance, and are not hemolytic on 5% sheep blood agar. The bacteria are not motile, susceptible to penicillin, and produce a wide zone of lecithinase on egg yolk agar.

40|$|Agar gel <b>precipitation</b> <b>test</b> was applied, for {{diagnosis}} of toxoplasmosis. In the former {{part of this}} experiment, various kinds of antigens were prepared from harvests of toxoplasma from mouse peritoneal exudate and were compared their antigenicities against rabbit serum immunized with RH strain in agar gel. Generally, 3 precipitate lines were observed, and one of these which formed at the side closer to antibody well, was intense and clear. The antigen participated in this line formation was not inactivated by heating 100 ℃ for 15 min. Other line yield at the side closer to the antigen well was faint and wide. The antigen of the line was heat labile. Of 10 kinds of antigens tested, freeze and thawed antigen was most active. The antigen fractionated by ammonium sulfate showed also high antigenicity. The antigen extracted by alkaline solution was less active, and no antigenicity was observed in trichloroacetic acid treated antigen. The freeze and thawed antigen was therefore applied for diagnosis in the following experiment. In {{the latter part of}} this experiment, the <b>precipitation</b> <b>test</b> with the antigen was performed using sera obtained from 110 apparently healthy pigs of field samples and also from 3 pigs of experimetal toxoplasmosis.

In liver diseases, it remarkably reacted to the liver antigen and showed many precipitation bands, and the precipitation band became numerous with the progress of disease in order of acute hepatitis, chronic hepatitis and liver cirrhosis. On the other hand, it remarkably reacted to the kidney antigen and showed many precipitation bands, in kidney diseases. 2. Comparing each form on the classification of epidemic hepatitis {{with the results of}} the Oudin's <b>precipitation</b> <b>test</b> in the agar layer, the liver antigen remarkably reacted to the typical form, jaundiced form and influenza form and the precipitation band appeared few in the gastroenteric form, mixed form and latent form, in comparison with the former. On the other hand, the kidney antigen showed no difference on the number of precipitation band in each form of kidney diseases. 3. Comparing the number of days after the attack of epidemic hepatitis with the results of the Oudin's <b>precipitation</b> <b>test</b> in the agar layer by the liver antigen, the appearance of precipitation band was remarkably seen at 6 - 9 th month after the attack of disease and it became more remarkable at the chronic stadium and the shifting stadium to liver cirrhosis. 4.

No correlation between the above <b>precipitation</b> <b>test</b> and the hippuric acid test was observed, but there were some correlation between the above, <b>precipitation</b> <b>test</b> and the bromsulphalein test, and the appearance of precipitation band was remarkably observed on the cases with the liver function damage. 5.

The present study investigates the ability of these amino acids to prolong the supersaturation of indomethacin in both aqueous and biorelevant conditions either when freely in solution or when formulated as co-amorphous mixtures. The co-amorphous amino acid-indomethacin mixtures (molar ratio 1 : 1) and amorphous indomethacin were prepared by cryomilling. Dissolution and <b>precipitation</b> <b>tests</b> were performed in buffer solutions (pH 5 and 6. 5) and in Fed and Fasted State Simulated Intestinal Fluids (FeSSIF and FaSSIF, respectively). <b>Precipitation</b> <b>tests</b> were conducted with the solvent shift method. The supersaturation stability of indomethacin and the precipitation inhibitory effect of amino acids were evaluated by calculating the supersaturation factor and the excipient gain factor, respectively. Biorelevant media exerted {{a significant effect on}} indomethacin solubility but had little effect on the supersaturation stability. Arginine had the most significant impact on the dissolution properties of indomethacin, but also phenylalanine and tryptophan stabilized supersaturation in some media when formulated as co-amorphous mixtures with indomethacin. Only arginine stabilized supersaturation without co-amorphization, an effect only observed in media of pH 6. 5. The unique behavior of the arginine-indomethacin mixture was further demonstrated by the abrupt formation of a precipitate, when an excess physical mixture of arginine and indomethacin was added to FeSSIF (pH 6. 5). The solid-state investigation of this precipitate indicated that it probably consisted of crystalline arginine-indomethacin salt with possibly some residual crystalline starting materials...|$|R
