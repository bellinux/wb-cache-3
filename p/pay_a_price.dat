25|$|During the {{previous}} day at Giants Stadium in New Jersey, Italy's World Cup hopes seemed to be diminishing fast as goalkeeper Gianluca Pagliuca was sent off with the game still at 0–0. Yet despite this, Italy {{was still able to}} salvage an important 1–0 victory. Norway would ultimately <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> for their inability to take advantage of Pagliuca's dismissal. With the four teams level on points, the final two group games would each have to finish as draws for things to stay that way. Republic of Ireland made it through after a dreary 0–0 draw with Norway; midfielders Massaro and Bernal traded strikes as Italy and Mexico played to a 1–1 draw.|$|E
25|$|When Yūko dies, Watanuki {{resolves}} to {{take care}} of the shop so he can wait for her return. During the climax of Tsubasa, Watanuki and Syaoran have to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> to survive Fei-Wang's dying curse with Watanuki's price being able to stay in the shop. From this he becomes the new master of the shop and takes up Yūko's job of granting wishes to the shop's customers during the last volume from xxxHolic subtitled xxxHolic Rō. His personality changes as he adopts some of Yūko's quirks and habits. He works with help from Domeki who brings him materials from outside. Over the following years, Watanuki's powers become stronger since he retains his ability to see spirits. His lifespan also increases, though he has the appearance of a teenager. More than a hundred years after taking over the shop, Watanuki's powers grow strong enough to allow him to leave the shop, but he decides to remain there and continue to fulfill the promise he made to Yūko.|$|E

500|$|The {{transport}} economics rationale for implementing congestion pricing on roads, described as [...] "one policy {{response to the}} problem of congestion", was summarized in testimony to the United States Congress Joint Economic Committee in 2003: [...] "congestion is considered to arise from the mispricing of a good; namely, highway capacity at a specific place and time. The quantity supplied (measured in lane-miles) is less than the quantity demanded at what is essentially a price of zero. If a good or service is provided free of charge, people tend to demand more of it—and use it more wastefully—than they would if they had to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> that reflected its cost. Hence, congestion pricing is premised on a basic economic concept: charge a price in order to allocate a scarce resource to its most valuable use, as evidenced by users' willingness to pay for the resource".|$|E
500|$|Within {{attachment}} theory, attachment means [...] "a biological instinct {{in which}} proximity to an attachment figure is sought {{when the child}} senses or perceives threat or discomfort. Attachment behaviour anticipates a response by the attachment figure which will remove threat or discomfort". Such bonds may be reciprocal between two adults, but between a child and a caregiver these bonds {{are based on the}} child's need for safety, security and protection, paramount in infancy and childhood. John Bowlby begins by noting that organisms at different levels of the phylogenetic scale regulate instinctive behavior in distinct ways, ranging from primitive reflex-like [...] "fixed action patterns" [...] to complex plan hierarchies with subgoals and strong learning components. In the most complex organisms, instinctive behaviors may be [...] "goal-corrected" [...] with continual on-course adjustments (such as a bird of prey adjusting its flight to the movements of the prey). The concept of cybernetically controlled behavioral systems organized as plan hierarchies (Miller, Galanter, and Pribram, 1960) thus came to replace Freud's concept of drive and instinct. Such systems regulate behaviors in ways that need not be rigidly innate, but—depending on the organism—can adapt in greater or lesser degrees to changes in environmental circumstances, provided that these do not deviate too much from the organism's environment of evolutionary adaptedness. Such flexible organisms <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>price,</b> however, because adaptable behavioral systems can more easily be subverted from their optimal path of development. For humans, Bowlby speculates, the environment of evolutionary adaptedness probably resembles that of present-day hunter-gatherer societies for the purpose of survival, and, ultimately, genetic replication. Attachment theory is not an exhaustive description of human relationships, nor is it synonymous with love and affection, although these may indicate that bonds exist.|$|E

2500|$|Nash equilibria with equally scoring {{alternatives}} can be ESSes. [...] For example, in {{the game}} Harm everyone, C is an ESS because it satisfies Maynard Smith's second condition.

2500|$|At its outbreak, the war enjoyed support {{across the}} nation. However, Whig Congressman Columbus Delano accused Polk of {{engineering}} the war, and Whig {{resistance to the}} war spread. In August 1846, Polk asked Congress to appropriate $2 million as a down payment for the potential purchase of California. Polk's request ignited opposition to the war, as Polk had never before made public his desire to annex parts of Mexico (aside from lands claimed by Texas). A freshman Democratic Congressman, David Wilmot of Pennsylvania, offered {{an amendment to the}} bill that would ban slavery in any newly acquired lands. The [...] "Wilmot Proviso", as it became known, injected the slavery debate into the Mexican-American War. The appropriation bill, with the Wilmot Proviso attached, passed the House in an 87–64 vote, but the bill died in the Senate. Polk's Democrats would <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> for the resistance to the war and the growing issue of slavery, as Democrats lost control of the House in the 1846 elections. However, in early 1847, Polk was successful in passing a bill raising further regiments, and he also finally won approval for the money he wanted to use for the purchase of California.|$|E

Livni faced tough negotiations with Kadima's coalition partners, particularly the Shas party, which had set conditions for joining a Livni government, including an increase in child allowances to Haredi communities, and a vow not to negotiate the status of Jerusalem during peace talks with the Palestinians. Livni was able to sign a coalition agreement with the Labor party, led by former prime minister Ehud Barak, but on October 26, informed the President that she was unable to form a government and suggested Israel go to elections. Livni cited her unwillingness to sell out her principles just to become prime minister, stating, [...] "I was willing to <b>pay</b> <b>a</b> <b>price</b> to form a government, but I was never willing to risk the political and economic future of Israel. If someone is willing to sell out his principles for the job, he is not worthy of it." [...] For its part, Likud, the main opposition party led by Benjamin Netanyahu, lobbied Shas and other parties essential to Livni's government to support early elections.|$|E
