[...] Other subjective methodological practices have included interviews with focus groups asking about stressors and stress level. In one study {{participants were asked to}} remember a past stressful event and then answer questionnaires on coping skills, job well-being, and appraisal of the situation (viewing the stressful event as a challenge or a threat). Common subjective methodologies were incorporated in a holistic stress model created in 2007 to acknowledge the importance of eustress, particularly in the workplace. This model uses hope, positive affect, meaningfulness, and manageability as a measure of eustress, and negative psychological states, negative affect, anxiety, and anger as a measure of distress. Objective measures have also been used and include blood <b>pressure</b> <b>rate,</b> muscle tension, and absenteeism rates. Further physiological research has looked for neuroendocrine changes as a result of eustress and distress. Research has shown that catecholamines change rapidly to pleasurable stimuli. Studies have demonstrated that eustress and distress produce different responses in the neuroendocrine system, particularly dependent on the amount of personal control one feels over a stressor.|$|E

40|$|Abstract A {{modified}} Reynolds stress turbulence {{model for}} the <b>pressure</b> <b>rate</b> of strain can be derived for dispersed two-phase flows taking into account gas-particle interaction. The transport equations for the Reynolds stresses {{as well as the}} equation for the fluctuating pressure can be derived starting from the multiphase Navier– Stokes equations. The unknown <b>pressure</b> <b>rate</b> of strain correlation in the Reynolds stress equations is then modelled by considering the multiphase equation for the fluctuating pressure. This leads to a multiphase <b>pressure</b> <b>rate</b> of strain model.

40|$|Diurnal {{variations}} in blood pressure, {{heart rate and}} <b>pressure</b> <b>rate</b> product were analyzed in 68 hospitalized diabetics (male 42, female 26) and 33 hospitalized controls (male 21, female 12) to investigate the influence of diabetic autonomic neuropathy on hemodynamics. The severity of autonomic damage was assessed by measuring the variabilities in R-R intervals of 100 consecutive heart beats in ECGs during quiet and deep breathing in the supine position and with the Schellong test. According to the results, the diabetics were divided into three groups: Normal ANS (31 patients without diabetic autonomic neuropathy), Abnormal PS (27 patients with parasympathetic damage alone) and Abnormal PS+S (10 patients with both parasympathetic and sympathetic damage). The blood pressure and heart rate of all subjects were recorded for 24 hours under near-basal conditions using an ambulatory blood pressure recording device (Pressurometer® Ⅱ, Del Mar Avionics, USA). The patterns of diurnal variations and the diurnal variabilities in blood pressure, heart rate and <b>pressure</b> <b>rate</b> product were analyzed in 22 control, 21 normal ANS, 20 abnormal PS and 10 abnormal PS+S patients. The effects of atropine sulfate (2. 0 mg daily, p. o.) were also studied in 11 control, 10 normal ANS and 11 abnormal PS patients {{to determine the effect}} of parasympathetic nerve damage on the variations. Hourly mean heart rates during the daytime and mean 24 -hour heart rates were not different among the groups. However, with the progress of autonomic neuropathy, there was a significant reduction in the diurnal variation in heart rates, with greater mean night heart rates and greater hourly minimum mean heart rates. On the other hand, with the progress of autonomic neuropathy, there was {{a significant increase in the}} diurnal variation in the systolic blood pressure. However, diastolic blood pressure varied to the same extent regardless of the severity of autonomic nerve damage. The diabetics with autonomic neuropathy had significantly greater hourly mean and mean 24 -hour systolic and diastolic blood pressure, and <b>pressure</b> <b>rate</b> product. The diurnal variation in the <b>pressure</b> <b>rate</b> product was similar to the heart rate results. Indices of the diurnal {{variations in}} heart rate and systolic blood pressure in controls and normal ANS patients approached those of abnormal PS patients after atropine sulfate administration.

30|$|Induced {{seismicity}} as {{generated by}} the injection of fluids in a homogeneous, permeable medium with faults with variable proximity to rupture conditions is simulated using the rate- and state-dependent frictional fault theory (RST) of Dieterich (J Geophys Res 99 (B 2): 2601 – 2618, 1994) and the critical pressure theory (CPT) developed by Shapiro (Fluid-induced seismicity, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2015). In CPT, the induced local seismicity density {{is proportional to the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>rate,</b> limited by the Kaiser Effect, and apparently un-related to the tectonic background seismicity. There is no time delay between a change in <b>pressure</b> <b>rate</b> and seismicity density. As a more complex theory, RST includes a time delay between a pressure change and induced seismicity and it is proportional to the natural tectonic background seismicity. Comparing both modelling approaches at a fixed location, this delay can be significant, dependent on a ‘free’ parameter that represents the lower threshold for pressure below which seismicity is not triggered. This parameter can be tuned so that the results of CPT and RST become similar. Approximations of the RST allow a new interpretation of the parameter ‘tectonic potential’ that controls the level of induced seismicity in CPT.|$|E
