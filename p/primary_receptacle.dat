40|$|Sample {{collection}} {{procedures and}} <b>primary</b> <b>receptacle</b> (sample container and bag) decontamination methods should prevent contaminant transfer between contaminated and non-contaminated surfaces and areas during bio-incident operations. Cross-contamination of personnel, equipment, or sample containers {{may result in}} the exfiltration of biological agent from the exclusion (hot) zone and have unintended negative consequences on response resources, activities and outcomes. The current study was designed to: (1) evaluate currently recommended sample collection and packaging procedures to identify procedural steps that may {{increase the likelihood of}} spore exfiltration or contaminant transfer; (2) evaluate the efficacy of currently recommended <b>primary</b> <b>receptacle</b> decontamination procedures; and (3) evaluate the efficacy of outer packaging decontamination methods. Wet- and dry-deposited fluorescent tracer powder was used in contaminant transfer tests to qualitatively evaluate the currently-recommended sample collection procedures. Bacillus atrophaeus spores, a surrogate for Bacillus anthracis, were used to evaluate the efficacy of spray- and wipe-based decontamination procedures. Both decontamination procedures were quantitatively evaluated on three types of sample packaging materials (corrugated fiberboard, polystyrene foam, and polyethylene plastic), and two contamination mechanisms (wet or dry inoculums). Contaminant transfer results suggested that size-appropriate gloves should be worn by personnel, templates should not be taped to or removed from surfaces, and primary receptacles should be selected carefully. The decontamination tests indicated that wipe-based decontamination procedures may be more effective than spray-based procedures; efficacy was not influenced by material type but was affected by the inoculation method. Incomplete surface decontamination was observed in all tests with dry inoculums. This study provides a foundation for optimizing current B. anthracis response procedures to minimize contaminant exfiltration.

40|$|This {{study was}} {{designed}} to experimentally characterize factors that can cause electrical failures (i. e., overheating connections), to assess the damage and potential forensic signatures of these failures, and to characterize the similarities and differences between arcing and melting in receptacle components and wiring. Laboratory testing evaluated the impact {{of a wide range of}} variables on the formation of overheating connections in residential duplex receptacles including screw terminal torque, wiring method (back-wired, or side-wired), and <b>primary</b> <b>receptacle</b> materials. A total of 408 trials of receptacles with various terminal connections were tested in the laboratory setting; receptacles were powered for up to 16 months. A small portion of receptacles with loose connections overheated to the point of failure of the receptacle; some including flaming events. Failure events occurred between 5 and 365 days after tests were started. Four hundred and sixty eight (468) receptacles were placed in compartment fire tests and furnace fire tests. These tests were designed to evaluate the persistence after fire exposure of overheating/arcing evidence from failure events (i. e., from potential fire cause events). The fire exposure tests also served to analyze the characteristic traits of arcing and melting damage. The results indicated that only very loose connections (less than 0. 339 N-m [3 in-lb]) at moderately high currents (9 A or higher) tend to form significant overheating connections and receptacle failures, irrespective of other variables such as receptacle materials and installation. Characteristic indicators of overheating and glowing terminal connections were identified and were found to persist after fire exposure...|$|E
40|$|Peatland {{catchments}} store {{vast amounts}} of carbon. Humic lakes and pools are the <b>primary</b> <b>receptacles</b> for terrigenous carbon in these meta-ecosystems, representing sequestration hotspots; boreal lakes alone store ca. 120 Pg C. But {{little is known about}} the mechanisms that preserve aquatic carbon stocks. Here, we determined the regulatory pathway of decomposition in relation to â��traditionalâ�� limitations, namely anoxia, decay inhibiting compounds, low nutrients and acidity, using in vitro manipulation, mesocosms and natural gradients. We show that anoxia represents a powerful hierarchical preservation mechanism affecting all major limitations on decomposition and recapturing carbon that would otherwise escape from peatlands. Oxygen constraints on microbial synthesis of oxidases and nutrient-cycling enzymes, prevents the decay of organic matter to CO 2, CH 4 and N 2 O by allowing inhibitor accumulation and lowering nutrients. However, this pathway is sensitive to direct nutrient inputs and therefore eutrophication could initiate catastrophic feedback to global warming via dramatically increased greenhouse gas emissions. Identifying these process-specific limitations should inform better management and conservation of these vital systems...|$|R
40|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>receptacles</b> improve {{profitability}} legumes are limiting demonstrations {{and acts of}} plant diseases and pests. Pathogens are 25 - 50 % lower yield of soybean, chickpea, beans, peas. Pests focally up to 87 % of viable seeds sown {{reduce the number of}} plants per 1 ha. Only effective protection against disease and estimates of crop production can increase the average profitability of legume crops by 15 - 30 %. Livestock is very important, but in the Southern Urals requires real support for its production with a positive balance (in the calculations with a deviation of 5 %). The most important resource in our opinion may be a reduction in price of fodder. Thus, legumes are sought for animal protein. Soybeans, chickpeas, beans, peas universal culture and the possibility of their use in the food balance for a healthy diet of ordinary people engaged in recreational and other sports niche expands further improve the profitability of their production. Regulation of the balance of the distribution of food and feed produced grain legumes allows fine regulation of the cost of fodder for a particular type of livestock activities. Phytosanitary capabilities, the balance of influence of legumes on arable land, also requires a fine regulation of these processes. Obtaining long-term public support for this production is unlikely in the WTO because actual search for ways to improve the profitability of production of agricultural technologies. In our view, a comprehensive approach taking into account the capacity of local markets for crop production. Such activity can act as a guaranteed quality of agro-technology and animal products from local resources specific zonal conditions of production...|$|R

40|$|Pertinent {{stages of}} {{development}} of the <b>receptacle,</b> <b>primary</b> and secondary appendages, and perithecium of Idiomyces peyritschii are described and illustrated and comparison is made between this species and the type species of Diplomyces, Sandersoniomyces, Symplectromyces, and Teratomyces for which early stages of receptacular and appendage development also are described and illustrated. Possible close relationship of these genera with one another is examined in the light not only of morphological similarities and differences but also of host range. It is concluded that Diplomyces, Sandersoniomyces, Symplectromyces, and Teratomyces do indeed constitute a closely allied group of genera. However, the gap between this alliance and Idiomyces is deemed great enough to warrant their separation into separate tribes within the Laboulbeniales, proposed by Thaxter in 1908, i. e., ldiomyceteae for Idiomyces and Teratomyceteae for the other four genera...|$|R
50|$|C. baccata is a tough, {{leathery}} seaweed of a yellowish or brownish colour. It is a perennial, {{each year}} growing new branches up to 50 cm long {{from a dark}} brown, cone-shaped base. The main axis is flattened and has {{a cross section of}} 1 cm x 0.5 cm. The side branches are alternate and cylindrical, being arranged in a pinnate fashion. The smallest branches are fine and wiry. There are small, lemon-shaped aerocysts or air bladders on the smaller branches. Usually these are single but sometimes there are several in a chain. When the lateral branches are shed in the winter, the base of the main axis can be seen to have a zigzag shape caused by the deciduous <b>primary</b> laterals. The <b>receptacles</b> are terminal, up to 5 cm long, cylindrical with knot-like swellings and covered with tiny threads. In the spring when new lateral shoots grow there are few if any aerocysts. By the autumn they are more numerous and noticeable.|$|R
