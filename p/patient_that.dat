5|$|Sector General is a {{gigantic}} multi-species hospital space station founded as a peace-promoting project by two heroes from {{opposite sides of}} humanity's first full interstellar war. The hospital accommodates patients and staff from dozens of species, with different environmental requirements, behaviors and ailments, {{but many of the}} stories feature types of <b>patient</b> <b>that</b> the builders did not anticipate. Initially most of the stories center round the career of Doctor Conway, who rises from junior surgeon to the top level, Senior Diagnostician. In the fourth book the Galactic Federation decides that the emergency service which the hospital offers to victims of space accidents and planetary catastrophes is its most effective means of making peaceful contact with new spacefaring species, which allows the series to expand its range of plots, characters and locations.|$|E
5|$|During {{a routine}} liposuction {{operation}} in Winnetka, Illinois, Dr. Harrison Lloyd (John Juliani) suddenly begins to remove so much fat from a <b>patient</b> <b>that</b> the patient dies. Following the unusual experience, Lloyd tells Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) {{that he killed}} the patient because he was possessed. Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) is skeptical about Lloyd's claims, believing he's only making it up to escape legal consequences. Mulder inspects the operation room and discovers a pentagram burned into the floor; he begins to suspect that witchcraft might have {{played a part in}} the crime. Meanwhile, the staff at Lloyd's clinic are shocked when another plastic surgeon, Dr. Ilaqua (Paul Raskin), murders an elderly patient by burning a hole through her cheek and neck with a surgical laser, severing her brain stem. Scully interviews Ilaqua, who claims that he cannot remember anything of the incident. Mulder's suspicions are strengthened when he reviews the tape of the second murder, and he sees a pentagram-like pattern on the stomach of the victim.|$|E

5|$|The {{residents}} initially {{arrive at}} the hospital each morning and argue over who will care for a certain <b>patient</b> <b>that</b> arrives each day. A hospital superior {{is in charge of}} assigning cases, often translating to tense feelings between the residents and their superiors. Episodes migrate {{back and forth from the}} doctors interacting with their patients, and with their co-workers. Once assigned a case, each doctor diagnoses the patient, with the help of his or her attending physician, which usually leads to surgery. The surgeons tend to form personal connections with their patients, with a patient often conveying a message to his or her doctor, which unintentionally relates to the doctor's private life. The show displays the growth of relationships between the doctors, either friendly or sexual, often stemming to a clash between their personal and professional lives. Emotional scenes are often accompanied by an indie rock background song, something that has become a hallmark of the series. At the conclusion of each episode, one of the characters delivers another voice-over, typically contrasting or following up on their initial one.|$|E

25|$|Psychic surgery, a pseudoscience constituting medical fraud, {{is when a}} {{practitioner}} creates the illusion of performing surgery {{with his or her}} bare hands and uses trickery, fake blood, and animal parts to convince the <b>patient</b> <b>that</b> the diseased lesions were removed and that the incision spontaneously healed.|$|E

25|$|In the United States {{and most}} other industrialized nations, {{emergency}} medical providers are required to treat any <b>patient</b> <b>that</b> has a life-threatening condition, irrespective of the patient's financial resources.

One drawback comes from emerging data that suggests very frequent ventricular ectopy may be associated with cardiomyopathy through a mechanism thought to be similar to that of chronic right ventricular pacing associated cardiomyopathy. <b>Patients</b> <b>that</b> have underlying chronic structural heart disease and complex ectopy, mortality is significantly increased.|$|R

25|$|For {{decades the}} New Deal was {{generally}} held in very high regard in the scholarship and the textbooks. That {{changed in the}} 1960s when New Left historians began a revisionist critique that said the New Deal was a bandaid for a <b>patient</b> <b>that</b> needed radical surgery to reform capitalism, put private property in its place, and lift up workers, women and minorities. The New Left believed in participatory democracy and therefore rejected the autocratic machine politics typical of the big city Democratic organizations.|$|E
25|$|Active {{treatments}} are light repetitive exercises that work {{the area to}} maintain normality. Basic information is also given to teach the <b>patient</b> <b>that</b> exercises as instructed will not cause any damage to their neck. These exercises are done at home or {{under the care of}} a health professional. When beginning a rehabilitation regimen, it's important to begin with slow movements which include cervical rotation until pain threshold three to five times per day, flexion and extension of the shoulder joint by moving the arms up and down two to three times, and combining shoulder raises while inhaling and releasing the shoulder raise while exhaling. Soderlund and colleagues also recommend that these exercises should be done every day until pain starts to dissipate. Early mobilization is important for preventing chronic pain, but pain experienced from these exercises might cause psychological symptoms that could have negative impact on recovery. Rosenfeld found that doing active exercises as often as once every waken hour during one month after trauma decreases the need for sick leave three years after trauma from 25% to 5.7%.|$|E

500|$|The show {{features}} various references {{relating to}} music, media, film, and other pop cultural phenomenon. Character Dr. Edwin Jenner was {{modeled after the}} English physician Edward Jenner, {{a pioneer in the}} eradication of smallpox. The episode title is an acronym for Test Subject 19, a <b>patient</b> <b>that</b> was examined by Jenner for clinical research. As [...] "TS-19" [...] comes to a close, one can hear the song [...] "Tomorrow Is a Long Time" [...] (1971) by American singer-songwriter Bob Dylan play in the background. The Washington Post Liz Kelly suggested that it could have referred to the seemingly long hiatus that proceeded after the season finale. Jenner later reveals to the group that the symptoms of the walker virus are evocative to that of meningitis. As Rick desperately tries to break out of a nearly incinerating Centers for Disease Control and Prevention building, Carol hands him a grenade, which was the same grenade that Rick had found in a tank in the series premiere, [...] "Days Gone Bye".

[...] Series producer Emma Turner said at the time that [...] "(Abra) made a huge impact in the few episodes that he was involved in" [...] and expressed her delight that Edmondson had agreed to reprise the role.

However, Digital Spy's Dek Hogan was more positive about the plot strand, and especially the role of Abra therein, stating: [...] "It’s been a cracking take this, another example of the excellent form that medical drama has been in this year, thanks in no small part to Adrian Edmondson marvellous turn as maverick surgeon Abra." ...|$|E
500|$|Most notably, he {{performed}} {{the first ever}} kidney transplant in the UK, at the Royal Infirmary of Edinburgh. Woodruff {{had been waiting for}} the right patient for some time, hoping to find a patient with an identical twin to act as the donor, as this would significantly reduce the risk of rejection. The <b>patient</b> <b>that</b> Woodruff eventually found was a 49-year-old man suffering from severely impaired kidney function who received one of his identical twin brother's kidneys on 30 October 1960. [...] Both twins lived an additional six years before dying of an unrelated disease. Woodruff thought that he had to be vigilant with his first kidney transplant, as he regarded the British medical community's attitude to be conservative towards transplantation. From then until his retirement in 1976, {{he performed}} 127 kidney transplants. Also in 1960, Woodruff published The Transplantation of Tissues and Organs, a comprehensive survey of transplant biology and one of seven books he wrote. He was awarded the 1969 Lister Medal for his contributions to surgical science. The corresponding Lister Oration, given at the Royal College of Surgeons of England, was delivered on 8 April 1970, and was titled 'Biological aspects of individuality'.|$|E
