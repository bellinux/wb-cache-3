5000|$|It {{should be}} noted that another factor {{affecting}} the administration of the Session at the time was the international situation behind the iron curtain. Many of the units attached to the General Conference were unable to send delegates to the Zeist session due to restrictions on religious bodies in communist lands. [...] Proxy letters from a number of Union Conferences were held by the General Conference Secretary enabling the session to convene legally (a provision enabled in the 1949 corporate registration), though the <b>proxy</b> <b>holder</b> still only had one vote regardless of the number of proxies held. Those Units not represented directly accounted for approximately 60% of the organization's membership. Consequently, neither of the two factions that became evident at the Zeist session were {{in a position to make}} any unilateral decisions.|$|E

The document outlined a short-, medium- and long- term plans for enhancing corporate governance. Strengthening shareholders' rights {{has been one}} of its objectives. Following the plan, The Directive 2007 / 36 /EC of the European Parliament and of the Council on the exercise of certain rights of shareholders in listed companies was enacted on 11 July 2007. It has been transposed into the Czech legal system in the law 420 / 2009 Sb. which came into force on 1 st December 2009. The directive addresses an important corporate governance issue of overcoming shareholders' apathy by removing barriers, which have been keeping shareholders from actively exercising their rights. It however failed to provide a definition of a shareholder. The directive set out rules for proxy voting in a general shareholders' meeting. Member states or companies are not allowed to restrict the exercise of shareholder rights through proxy holders for any purpose other than to address potential conflicts of interest between the <b>proxy</b> <b>holder</b> and the shareholder by one of three prescribed methods. The Czech Business Code has [...] ...|$|E
50|$|Proxy {{voting is}} said to have some anti-deliberative consequences, in that <b>proxy</b> <b>holders</b> often lack {{discretion}} about how to cast votes due to the instructions given by their principal. Thus, they cannot alter their decision based on the deliberative process of testing the strength of arguments and counter-arguments.|$|R
40|$|This article reconsiders the {{important}} question which came to light {{as a result of}} the controversial 2002 Coles Myer annual general meeting: do directors that are appointed as proxy have an obligation to vote as directed (and indeed should they) ? A recent decision of the New South Wales Supreme Court, which was subsequently approved on appeal, stands for the proposition that <b>proxy</b> <b>holders</b> are agents of the shareholders that appointed them. However, currently the Corporations Act only requires a Chairman appointed as proxy to vote as directed — not an ordinary director. This article briefly explains the present state of the law in Australia on this issue, and then explores some interesting recent judicial remarks which may suggest that ordinary directors appointed as proxy must vote as directed in order to satisfy their director’s duties (both common law and statutory) to the company. We finally outline a proposed statutory reform initiative which seeks to remove the present uncertainty in the law by introducing a blanket requirement that all <b>proxy</b> <b>holders</b> must vote as directed. <br /...|$|R

40|$|Empirical {{research}} on mortgage default in the single-family market {{has focused on}} the value of the borrower's put option using house price indices to estimate contemporaneous loan-to-value ratio or the probability of negative equity. But since the borrower possesses the option to increase leverage by taking on additional debt secured by junior liens subsequent to loan origination (a phenomenon termed here equity dilution), even a perfect house price adjustment cannot be expected to accurately measure changes in borrower equity over time. Since junior liens are generally unobservable to senior debt <b>holders,</b> <b>proxies</b> are required in empirical applications. This paper employs an independent estimate of junior lien probability developed from the 1998 Survey of Consumer Finances combined with loan level mortgage performance data to examine the role junior liens play in increasing default risk.

40|$|SUMMARY: We {{are proposing}} new rules that would, under certain circumstances, require {{companies}} {{to include in}} their <b>proxy</b> materials security <b>holder</b> nominees for election as director. These proposed rules are intended to improve disclosure to security holders to enhance their ability to participate meaningfully in the proxy process for the nomination and election of directors. The proposed rules would not provide security holders {{with the right to}} nominate directors where it is prohibited by state law. Instead, the proposed rules are intended to create a mechanism for nominees of long-term security holders, or groups of long-term security holders, with significant holdings to be included in company proxy materials where there are indications that security holders need such access to further an effective proxy process. This mechanism would apply in those instances where evidence suggests that the company has been unresponsive to security holder concerns as they relate to the proxy process. The proposed rules would enable security holders to engage in limited solicitations to form nominating security holder groups and engage in solicitations in support of their nominees without disseminating a proxy statement. The proposed rules also would establish the filing requirements under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 for nominating security holders.
