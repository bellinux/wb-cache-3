[...] Present-day remote controls are commonly consumer infrared devices which send digitally-coded pulses of infrared radiation to control {{functions such as}} power, volume, channels, <b>playback,</b> <b>track</b> change, heat, fan speed, or other features varying from device to device. [...] Remote controls for these devices are usually small wireless handheld objects {{with an array of}} buttons for adjusting various settings such as television channel, track number, and volume. For many devices, the remote control contains all the function controls while the controlled device itself has only a handful of essential primary controls. The remote control code, and thus the required remote control device, is usually specific to a product line, but there are universal remotes, which emulate the remote control made for most major brand devices.|$|E

50|$|A common {{workaround}} is {{to encode}} consecutive tracks as one single file, relying on cue sheets (or something similar) for navigation. While this method results in gapless <b>playback</b> within consecutive <b>tracks,</b> {{it can be}} unwieldy because of the possibly large size of the resulting compressed file. Furthermore, unless the playback software or hardware can recognize the cue sheets, navigating between tracks may be difficult.|$|R
50|$|Listeners can {{indicate}} their preferences by directly responding to each track played, either favorably (by selecting the happy face button), or unfavorably (by selecting the sad face button), which determines if the track should be played, {{as well as}} how often similarly classified songs should be played on the station. Responding unfavorably to a track (selecting the sad face button) immediately stops <b>playback</b> of the <b>track.</b>|$|R
50|$|Shuffle play is a mode {{of music}} {{playback}} in which songs are played in a randomized order that is decided upon for all tracks at once.

50|$|Rowe Customusic is a {{background}} music {{system for the}} 1960s and 1970s. The playback machine can load up to six Fidelipac type C endless magnetic tape cartridges, which could hold the longest tape of its kind. Like the 3M Cantata 700, the playback machine moves the tape head in between the cartridges, and also usual for Fidelipac <b>playback</b> machines, <b>track</b> by track on the current cartridge, to access each to the four tracks per cartridge. The current cartridge number is indicated on a seven-segment display. Changing to the next track was triggered automatically by a conductive tape strip where the endless tape joined its both ends, or even manually by pressing a key to move the tape head to the next track. An other switch located next to the main switch disables changing the cartridge an make the player remain the playback procedure on the current cartridge.|$|R
50|$|A CD {{player has}} three major {{mechanical}} components : a drive motor, a lens system, and a tracking mechanism.The drive motor (also called spindle) spins the disc to a scanning velocity of 1.2-1.4 m/s (constant linear velocity) - equivalent to approximately 500 RPM at {{the inside of}} the disc, and approximately 200 RPM at the outside edge. (A disc played from beginning to end slows its rotation rate during <b>playback.)</b> The <b>tracking</b> mechanism moves the lens system along the spiral tracks in which information is encoded, and the lens assembly reads the information using a laser beam, typically produced by a laser diode. The laser reads information by focusing a beam on the CD, which is reflected off the disc's mirrored surface back to a photodiode array sensor. The sensor detects changes in the beam, and a digital processing chain interprets these changes as binary data. The data are processed, and eventually converted to sound using a digital-to-analog converter (DAC).|$|R

50|$|SDDS's much-touted eight <b>track</b> <b>playback</b> {{capability}} {{never quite}} caught on, as {{it required that}} a separate eight channel sound mix be created {{in addition to the}} six channel mix that is needed for SRD and DTS, an additional expense for the studios. Out of the 1,400 plus films mixed in SDDS, only 97 of them to date have been mixed to support the full 8 channels, most of them Sony (Via Sony Pictures/Columbia/Tristar) releases. Because of the added installation expense, the majority of SDDS installations are 6 channel (5.1) installations, as opposed to 8 channel (7.1) installations.|$|R
5000|$|Ampex built {{a handful}} of {{multitrack}} machines during the late 1950s that could record {{as many as eight}} tracks on 1 inch tape. The project was overseen by Ross Snyder, Ampex manager of special products. To make the multitrack recorder work, Snyder invented the Sel-Sync process, which used some tracks on the head for <b>playback</b> and other <b>tracks</b> on the head for recording. This made the newly recorded material be in sync with the existing recorded tracks. [...] The first of these machines cost $10,000 and was installed in Les Paul's home recording studio by David Sarser.|$|R
5000|$|Various software, {{firmware}} {{and hardware}} components may add up a substantial delay associated with starting <b>playback</b> of a <b>track.</b> If not accounted for, the listener is left waiting in silence as the player fetches the next file (see harddisk access time), updates metadata, decodes the whole first block, before having any data {{to feed the}} hardware buffer. The gap can {{be as much as}} half a second or more — very noticeable in [...] "continuous" [...] music such as certain classical or dance genres. In extreme cases, the hardware is even reset between tracks, creating a very short [...] "click".|$|R
5000|$|The 6280 {{can play}} back MPEG 4 [...] ".mp4" [...] video files, {{such as those}} {{designed}} to be played on an iPod, provided {{they have not been}} encrypted under DRM. AVI files can be transcoded using software on the PC. During video <b>playback,</b> the audio <b>track</b> tends to stop after about 20 minutes. To get around this problem it is possible to split mp4 files into several pieces, but in software version 6.x or later the problem does not occur. The default format used by the phone for video encoding is [...] ".3GP", which QuickTime will decode. This is the format used by the phone when video is selected from the camera option.|$|R
5000|$|As the {{recording}} sessions progressed, keyboardist Paul Griffin was {{moved from the}} Hammond organ to piano. Kooper quickly suggested to producer Tom Wilson {{that he had a}} [...] "great organ part" [...] for the song (which he later confessed was just a ruse to play in the session), and Wilson responded, [...] "Al, you're not an organ player, you're a guitar player", but Kooper stood his ground. Before Wilson could explicitly reject Kooper's suggestion, he was interrupted by a phone call in the control room. Kooper immediately went into the studio and sat down at the organ, though he had rarely played organ before the session. When Wilson returned, he was shocked to find Kooper in the studio. By this time, Kooper had been playing along with Dylan and his backing band. His organ can be heard coming in an eighth note behind {{the other members of the}} band, as Kooper followed to make sure he was playing the proper chords. During a <b>playback</b> of <b>tracks</b> in the control room, when asked about the organ track, Dylan was emphatic: [...] "Turn the organ up!" ...|$|R
50|$|The Mark III system {{followed}} in 2000. The Mark III included {{a variety of}} underlying technical improvements to the record and playback system. An especially noteworthy improvement was its ability to play back performances at very low volume levels. Additional user features included recording and playback of synchronous audio <b>tracks,</b> <b>playback</b> of specially encoded CD-ROM disks from a built-in CD player, and the SmartKey system that provided a play-along feature in which the user is prompted to press silently wiggling keys. The Mark III also introduced support for video-sync recording and playback based on the generation and reception of MIDI Time Code. Another upgrade known as the DCD1 was available that could provide early Disklavier owners with a CD drive for reading Cd's like the Mk III.|$|R
50|$|The data {{structure}} and operation of a MiniDisc {{is similar to that}} of a computer's hard disk drive. The bulk of the disc contains data pertaining to the music itself, and a small section contains the table of contents (TOC), providing the playback device with vital information about the number and location of tracks on the disc. Tracks and discs can be named. Tracks may easily be added, erased, combined and divided, and their preferred order of <b>playback</b> modified. Erased <b>tracks</b> are not actually erased at the time, but are marked so. When a disc becomes full, the recorder can simply slot track data into sections where erased tracks reside. This can lead to some fragmentation but unless many erasures and replacements are performed, the only likely problem is excessive searching, reducing battery life.|$|R
