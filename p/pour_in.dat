5|$|The pouring {{process has}} an {{influence}} on a beer's presentation. The rate of flow from the tap or other serving vessel, tilt of the glass, and position of the <b>pour</b> (<b>in</b> the centre or down the side) into the glass all influence the end result, such as the size and longevity of the head, lacing (the pattern left by the head as it moves down the glass as the beer is drunk), and the release of carbonation.|$|E
5|$|In January 1933, the Nazi Party came {{to power}} in Germany. In May, Born became one of six Jewish professors at Göttingen who were {{suspended}} with pay; Franck had already resigned. In twelve years they had built Göttingen into one of the world's foremost centres for physics. Born began looking for a new job, writing to Maria Göppert-Mayer at Johns Hopkins University and Rudi Ladenburg at Princeton University. Offers soon started to <b>pour</b> <b>in,</b> and he accepted one from St John's College, Cambridge. At Cambridge, he wrote a popular science book, The Restless Universe, and a textbook, Atomic Physics, that soon became a standard text, going through seven editions. His family soon settled into life in England, with his daughters Irene and Gritli becoming engaged to Welshman Brinley (Bryn) Newton-John (Olivia Newton-John's parents; Born is Olivia's grandfather and Irene is her mother) and Englishman Maurice Pryce respectively.|$|E
5|$|Most beers are {{cleared of}} yeast by {{filtering}} when packaged in bottles and cans. However, bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered, or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast. It is usually {{recommended that the}} beer be poured slowly, leaving any yeast sediment {{at the bottom of}} the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to <b>pour</b> <b>in</b> the yeast; this practice is customary with wheat beers. Typically, when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer, 90% of the contents are poured, and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, the bottle may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers.|$|E

It was examined on March 6, 2008.|$|R

5|$|After {{the army}} was marshaled, Skanderbeg would not permit the {{trumpets}} to give the signal for battle until he saw Ali Pasha advancing. After looking upon the Albanian army, the Pasha ordered his army to charge {{with one of the}} units ahead of the rest. The Albanian front line retreated; Skanderbeg sent a body of horsemen to prevent the line from breaking and marshaled the retreating troops back to their places. Ali Pasha believed he had the Albanians trapped. The same situation occurred on the left wing and, when all were in their places, the army prepared for the main offensive. As it began, the wings were fiercely led on by Thopia and Golemi and pushed back the Ottoman wings. In the centre, Skanderbeg assaulted a selected battalion. When the proper signal was given, the 3,000 horsemen hidden in the woods sprang out and charged into the Ottoman rear, causing large parts of their army to rout. The wings of the Albanian army turned towards the Ottoman centre's flanks. Ajdin Muzaka, having charged the Turkish centre, was met by fierce resistance and the Turks continued to <b>pour</b> <b>in</b> fresh forces until Vrana Konti came in with his reserves and decided the battle. The Turkish army was surrounded. The Ottoman front ranks were annihilated except for 300 soldiers. Ali Pasha's personal battalion fled although the commander nearly met his death.|$|E
5|$|The Season {{began on}} November 9, with a Depression hitting Tamil Nadu. Rainfall begin <b>pour</b> <b>in</b> the places of Nellore and Chittor district. Tirumala getting a heavy {{rainfall}} of 309mm along with Tirupathi with 148mm in 24 hours triggered a flood situation in Chittoor District. Coastal places of Tada recorded 114mm of rainfall the same day. There were 3-4 good spells of rain between 9th and 15th. As rainfall began in Andhra Pradesh on 16 November, local authorities closed schools in Nellore district. Heavy rain of about 27cm pounded the temple town of Tirupathi. Thousands of lakes and ponds across the district overflowed, with breaches reported in some areas. At Sri Kalahasti, a pilgrimage centre in the region, the Swarnamukhi River {{was reported to}} be rising. Three people were swept away by floodwaters in Chittoor district, and water entered some houses. Roads were damaged in many parts of Nellore district, disrupting transport services. Andhra Pradesh chief minister Chandrababu Naidu held a teleconference with the district collectors of affected districts and asked disaster response personnel to be on alert.|$|E

25|$|The enemy, Brinkmann thought, {{could and}} would glean {{important}} intelligence {{from the most}} seemingly innocuous messages and consequently his fleet commander was foolish to issue them. At 08:01, once again without consulting Lindemann or Brinkmann, he radioed the Naval High Command his intent to sail to St. Nazaire and detach his heavy cruiser for commerce operations. No mention {{of the extent of}} the damage incurred by Bismarck was relayed to Germany. The ship was down by the bow, having been hit. The shell had severed the fuel lines to forward fuel tanks by allowing sea water to <b>pour</b> <b>in</b> through the hole located just above the waterline. In Germany, Raeder and his staff felt unable to issue Lütjens with any orders since they had no information {{on the state of the}} task force.|$|E
25|$|On April 30, the Rev. George Burroughs, Lydia Dustin, Susannah Martin, Dorcas Hoar, Sarah Morey and Philip English (Mary's husband) were arrested. Nehemiah Abbott Jr. was {{released}} because the accusers agreed {{he was not}} the person whose specter had afflicted them. Mary Eastey {{was released}} for a few days after her initial arrest because the accusers failed to confirm that it was she who had afflicted them; she had been arrested again when the accusers reconsidered. In May, accusations continued to <b>pour</b> <b>in,</b> but some of those suspects began to evade apprehension. Multiple warrants were issued before John Willard and Elizabeth Colson were apprehended; George Jacobs Jr. and Daniel Andrews were not caught. Until this point, all the proceedings were investigative, but on May 27, 1692, William Phips ordered the establishment of a Special Court of Oyer and Terminer for Suffolk, Essex and Middlesex counties to prosecute the cases of those in jail. Warrants were issued for more people. Sarah Osborne, one of the first three persons accused, died in jail on May 10, 1692.|$|E

25|$|There {{are several}} types of {{different}} materials that are used throughout this building. The main materials used in the building envelope consist of concrete, glass, granite and steel. The curtain wall facade of this building uses large glass panels, framed with black granite framing. While the glass used for the lower box is completely transparent, the curtain wall for the upper seven floors uses fritted glass {{with a series of}} light gray circles, each approximately the size of a CD. This creates a protective screen that hinders view out from the building, but provides privacy to its users while reducing heat gain, and maintaining a certain level of sophistication is its aesthetics at the same time. Each of the twelve hypostyle columns are made of reinforced concrete. The columns supporting the tower are Agilia Concrete, which is more enhanced in design effect and construction process compared to traditional concretes: it can be placed 50% faster than the traditional concrete, and form complex shapes that would have been impossible in previous years. Each colossal column spans spanning one meter in diameter and 19 meters high; each one was constructed in a single <b>pour</b> <b>in</b> order to achieve the highest quality and a sense of grace and elegance. A striking urban colonnade is created through this series of columns; asserting its presence on campus while setting distinct boundaries between the street, public space of the campus and the privacy of the pharmacy faculty. Self-compacting concrete is used as the structural support system {{throughout the rest of the}} structure. The pods were constructed as “steel baskets” suspended by steel rods. The shells of these pods are constructed of structural steel and plaster and silver reflective paint are used for the finishes of these pods.|$|E

500|$|Bretagne {{was hit by}} four [...] {{projectiles}} from , , and [...] (no ship is individually credited). The two first shells struck {{simultaneously in}} the third British salvo. The first hit the ship below the waterline under turret IV, igniting some 340 mm shells and triggering a massive explosion. The deflagration blew up bulkheads and watertight doors and set all the stern ablaze, killing about 350 sailors. In the meantime, a hole on the starboard {{side of the ship}} allowed water (estimated at a rate of 300 tons per minute) to <b>pour</b> <b>in.</b> This flooding prevented the complete destruction of the ship: it limited the fire around the aft 340 mm magazines, which were now open to the air.|$|E

500|$|Because of her limited range, UB-8 {{would not}} have been able to make the entire journey to Turkey, so on 2 May, she was towed by the Austrian cruiser [...] from Pola down the Adriatic and through the Straits of Otranto. The duo {{continued}} until spotted by French forces near Kefalonia. UB-8 slipped the tow and Novara raced back into the Adriatic without incident. Two days after her departure, UB-8 was running on the surface when the stern of the boat suddenly dropped. The watch officer, on the conning tower with the helmsman and a lookout, was able to partially close the hatch before the entire submarine slipped below the waves, depositing the three men in the water. On board the submarine, water continued to <b>pour</b> <b>in</b> through the hatch and the boat was sinking by the stern. Voigt ordered the interior hatch to the control room sealed and all the ballast tanks filled with compressed air to increase buoyancy. The tactic returned UB-8 to the surface where the boat's diesel engines were restarted. Voigt circled back for the missing crewmen but only the watch officer and helmsman were recovered; the lookout had drowned.|$|E
500|$|Letters {{began to}} <b>pour</b> <b>in</b> for her {{from all over}} the country. There were mostly propositions from men, but the letters from women thanked her profusely and begged her for {{reassurance}} that they would be all right. Bannon described the impact her books had from the letters she received from people who were isolated in small towns: [...] "The most important things they learned (from the books) were that 1) they weren't unique and doomed to lifelong isolation, 2)... they weren't 'abnormal,' and 3) there was hope for a happy life. They wrote to me in thousands, asking me to confirm these wonderful things, which I gladly did—even though I felt only marginally better informed than they were." [...] The books were even translated into other languages, which was also quite rare for the brief lives of pulp novels. Bannon received international and domestic mail from women, saying, [...] "This is the only book (and they would say this about all of them) that I've read where the women really love each other, where its OK for them to love each other, and they don't have to kill themselves afterwards." ...|$|E
500|$|Matthew Rolston {{directed}} the music video for [...] "The Climb", which premiered on Cyrus's Myspace page on February 11, 2009. The video commences {{with a shot}} of Cyrus holding a guitar and a suitcase as she begins to walk down a long path extending through a valley. At {{the end of the}} valley, the sun breaks out over a distant mountain. The entire scene is enhanced with computer-generated imagery. Cyrus has her hair tied in a bun and wears a traveling jacket, a gray tank top and cowboy boots. In a separate setting, Cyrus, wearing a gray short sleeve shirt and her hair loose, begins to sing [...] "The Climb" [...] beneath a blue spotlight in a purple room. The two settings alternate throughout the video. A vignetted scene from Hannah Montana: The Movie appears in front of Cyrus as she walks on the path. The video zooms into the scene and a montage of film clips plays, featuring Cyrus's character and her love interest, Travis Brody (played by Lucas Till) horseback riding. The video returns to Cyrus walking; she picks up a rose fallen on the path, then throws it behind her. As the video progresses, she also sees things such as a herd of horses and a shooting star cross her path. A new setting enters the video in which Cyrus dances in a purple room with a countdown or, occasionally, film clips projected on the wall behind her. Rain begins to <b>pour</b> <b>in</b> the path setting. Cyrus puts down her jacket, guitar case, suitcase and boots, and continues onwards with only her guitar strapped to her shoulder. More film clip montages play {{in the same manner as}} the first. As the last montage ends, Cyrus finally reaches the summit of a reddish, CGI mountain and triumphantly looks over the cliff's edge to watch the sun shining over a shimmering lake. An alternate version of the music video excluding the Hannah Montana: The Movie clips exists and was sent to several channels, including VH1.|$|E
