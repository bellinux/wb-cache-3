When the transmitting node {{is ready to}} transmit data, it senses the transmission medium for idle or busy. If idle, then it transmits a frame with probability p. If busy, then it senses the transmission medium continuously until it becomes idle, then transmits with probability p. If the node does not transmit (the probability of this event is 1-p), it waits until the next available time slot. If the transmission medium is still not busy, it transmits again with the same probability p. This probabilistic hold-off repeats until the frame is finally transmitted or when the medium is found to become busy again (i.e. some other node has already started transmitting). In the latter case the node repeats the whole logic cycle (which started with sensing the transmission medium for idle or busy) again. <b>p-persistent</b> <b>CSMA</b> is used in CSMA/CA systems including Wi-Fi and other packet radio systems.|$|E

Analysing the effect of fading and near–far effect on the performance of 802. 11 is a fundamental consideration in practical situations since the wireless channels are error-prone.

40|$|Motivated {{by their}} {{tremendous}} potentials in civil and military applications, {{wireless sensor networks}} have raised tremendous research interests in recent years. The fundamental function of wireless sensor networks is the gathering of information from a covered area. Information thus gathered by the sensor nodes are processed by the sink nodes according to the applications deployed in the network. Therefore, delivering information from sensor nodes to sink nodes effectively {{is one of the}} fundamental challenges in wireless sensor networks. To achieve flexibility in deployment, sensor nodes are generally battery-driven. Furthermore, battery replacement is very difficult, if at all possible, due to the random deployment nature of wireless sensor networks. Thus, sensor nodes have limited operational time and the operational time of the sensor networks is also limited. Hence, energy efficiency is another fundamental challenge in wireless sensor networks. To improve the performance of wireless sensor networks, data delivery should be both energy efficient and effective, which is the focus of this thesis. First, we observe the conflict of the two objectives -viz., the application performance and the network lifetime - when optimizing the performance of wireless sensor networks. We find that the tradeoff between them can be studied by investigating the interaction between the network lifetime maximization problem and the rate allocation problem. Then, we formulate the tradeoff problem as a constrained convex optimization problem by introducing a tradeoff factor. We first tackle this problem at the transport layer, and then from a cross layer perspective. Using Lagrange dual decomposition, algorithms are obtained to achieve the best tradeoff. Then, we note that the notion of reliability in certain wireless sensor networks is probabilistic. Based on this, the problem of providing minimum energy probabilistic reliable data delivery is studied. First we tackle the problem at the MAC layer, using <b>p-persistent</b> <b>CSMA</b> protocols.

In this paper, the users of a distributed LAN are modeled as selfish users with independence {{to choose their}} individual strategies. With these selfish users, the contention-based distributed medium access scenario is modeled as a complete-information, noncooperative game, designated the “Access Game. ” A novel MAC strategy based on <b>p-persistent</b> <b>CSMA</b> is presented to achieve fairness in the “Access Game. ” It is proven that there are {{an infinite number of}} Nash Equilibria for the “Access Game, ” but they do not result in fairness. Therefore, it may be beneficial for the selfish users to adhere to a set of constraints that result in fairness in a noncooperative fashion. This leads to the formulation of a constrained “Access Game ” with fairness represented as a set of algebraic constraints. It is proven that the solution of the constrained game, the Constrained Nash Equilibrium, is unique. Further, it is shown that, in addition to achieving fairness, this solution also optimizes the throughput. Finally, these results are extended to a more realistic incomplete-information scenario by approximating the incomplete-information scenario as a complete-information scenario through information gathering and dissemination.

In this paper, {{we consider the}} joint design of opportunistic spectrum access and adaptive power management under the setting of multi-radio nodes and multi-channel wireless local area networks (WLANs) under the distributed coordination function (DCF) mode. This design problem is particularly challenging due to the conflicting nature of the multi-radio capability of a node, i. e., multiple radios improve throughput and delay performance {{at the cost of}} increased energy consumption. To address this problem, we propose a power-saving multi-channel MAC protocol (PSM-MMAC), which is capable of reducing the collision probability and the waiting time in the ‘awake ’ state of a node, resulting in improved throughput, delay performance, and energy efficiency. The key ideas of PSM-MMAC are the following: we first estimate the number of active links; given this estimation as well as queue lengths and channel conditions, we appropriately select channels, radios, and power states (i. e., awake or doze state); then we optimize the medium access probability in <b>p-persistent</b> <b>CSMA</b> used in the data exchange. Another contribution of this paper is an analytical model that characterizes the throughput performance. Simulation results validate the accuracy of our analytical model and show that our proposed protocol is able to significantly improve both throughput and energy efficiency. I...|$|E
3000|$|In this work, we {{consider}} a general semi-distributed cooperative spectrum sensing (SDCSS) and access framework under the heterogeneous environment where statistics of wireless channels, and spectrum holes can be arbitrary {{and there is}} no central controller to collect sensing results and make spectrum status decisions. In addition, we assume that each SU is equipped with only one spectrum sensor so that SUs have to sense channels sequentially. This assumption would be applied to real-world hardware-constrained cognitive radios. The considered SDCSS scheme requires SUs to perform sensing on their assigned sets of channels and then exchange spectrum sensing results with other SUs, which can be subject to errors. After the sensing and reporting phases, SUs employ the <b>p-persistent</b> <b>CSMA</b> MAC protocol [30] to access one available channel. In this MAC protocol, parameter p denotes the access probability to the chosen channel if the carrier sensing indicates an available channel (i.e., no other SUs transmit on the chosen channel). It is of interest to determine the access parameter p that can mitigate the collisions and hence enhance the system throughput [30]. Also, optimization of the spectrum sensing set for each SU (i.e., the set of channels sensed by the SU) is very critical to achieve good system throughput. Moreover, analysis and optimization of the joint spectrum sensing and access design become much more challenging in the heterogeneous environment, which, however, can significantly improve the system performance. Our current paper aims to resolve these challenges whose contributions can be summarized as follows: [...]...|$|E
40|$|UnrestrictedWe {{consider}} {{two fundamental}} {{building blocks for}} many applications in wireless sensor networks - location support and efficient medium access for one-hop data collection.; In {{the first part of}} the thesis we identify two important problems of location support - accurate localization and fast & fair localization - and propose novel solutions. We address the problem of accurate localization by proposing two novel, light-weight RF localization techniques called Ecolocation and Sequence-Based Localization. We define constructs called location constraints and location sequences based on distance ranks of reference nodes from the location of the unknown node and use them for localization. We compare and contrast the two localization techniques and show their robustness to RF channel non-idealities through examples. Through extensive systematic simulations and a representative set of real mote experiments, we show that our light-weight RF localization techniques provide comparable or better accuracy than other state-of-the-art radio signal strength-based localization techniques over a range of wireless channel and node deployment conditions.; In addition to being accurate, the location support service should also be fast and fair. The response times of the reference nodes to localization requests from the unknown node should be minimized and multiple unknown nodes, at different locations, should not have widely varying response times. We identify this as a fast/fair localization problem and formulate it as a min-max optimization problem, show that it is related to the well-known, NP-hard, maximum broadcast frame length problem, and investigate a heuristic scheduling based solution. We study the attributes that determine the response times of the reference nodes, called the localization delay, and derive closed-form expressions for it. We then investigate the heuristic solution's performance in terms of localization delay, fairness and average and minimum localizable speeds.; In the second part of the thesis, we address the problem of medium access for one-hop data collection, which occurs frequently in many wireless sensor network applications. We consider a wide spectrum of one-hop data collection applications with continuous data collection at one end and one-shot data collection at the other. While in the continuous data collection problem the contending wireless nodes always have a packet to transmit, in the one-shot data collection problem each contending node has a single packet to transmit. Medium access mechanisms for continuous data collection have been studied extensively in the past by numerous researchers, but such mechanisms for one-shot data collection have received much less attention. In this thesis we address the medium access problem for this spectrum of application scenarios through three different pieces of work.; We model and analyze the performance of slotted Aloha medium access techniques for the one-shot data collection problem. Owing to the transient nature of the network in this problem we use non-ergodic Markov chain analysis and derive flow equations that accurately capture the temporal dynamics of the network. Using these equations we evaluate the medium access techniques' performance in terms of delay and energy consumption.; We then present a novel location-aware medium access protocol for the one-shot data collection problem that uses the location information of contending nodes to reduce collisions and improve the overall performance. We evaluate the protocol in terms of delay and energy consumption and compare it with location-unaware medium access protocols using simulations. Results show that our protocol can take advantage of the location distribution of nodes to provide significantly lower delay and energy consumption compared to location-unaware protocols.; Finally, we model, analyze, and evaluate the performance of the IEEE 802. 15. 4 MAC protocol for both ends of the one-hop data collection application spectrum. We find that the IEEE 802. 15. 4 MAC protocol performs poorly for one-hop data collection in dense sensor networks, showing a steep deterioration in both throughput and energy consumption with increasing number of transmitters. We propose a channel feedback-based enhancement to the protocol that is significantly more scalable, showing a relatively flat, slow-changing total system throughput and energy consumption as the network size increases. A key feature of the enhancement is that the back-off windows are updated after successful transmissions instead of collisions. The window updates are based on an optimality criterion we derive from mathematical modeling of <b>p-persistent</b> <b>CSMA...</b>|$|E
