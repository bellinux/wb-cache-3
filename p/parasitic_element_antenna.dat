This {{system is designed}} with one actively fed radiating element and N-parasitic radiating elements. The radiation pattern can be electronically controlled {{by means of the}} loads terminating the <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements.</b> The <b>antenna</b> system is designed as ESPAR to have a minimum number of controlling elements thereby minimising the power consumed. The dual band operation of this antenna is for the frequency bands of the wireless local area network (WLAN), which are 2. 412 - 2. 482 GHz for IEEE 802. 11 b/g (known as the 2. 4 GHz band) and 5. 15 - 5. 825 GHz for IEEE 802. 11 a (known as the 5 GHz band). In the upper band, only the 5. 8 GHz sub-band was considered. The dual-band capability was targeted by conducting a structural parameter modification on the antenna system. The structural modification involves optimisation of the length of the active element, the length of the <b>parasitic</b> <b>element,</b> the distance of the <b>parasitic</b> <b>element</b> from the active element and most importantly, by application of a loading technique on the elements. The loading was done by using optimisation tools, such as fminsearch, fminbnd and the genetic algorithm. The specific circuit that was used for the loading was a series connection inductors inserted into the <b>antenna’s</b> <b>elements</b> at positions found via a global optimization [...] The method used was to first identify the optimal length per specific resonant frequency and consider the optimal length with respect to both resonant frequencies. The second step was to load the three resulting optimised different monopoles, and the loading with results closest to the requirements. The optimum monopole of the three in the second step was then used as the fixed input parameter for the main optimisation of ESPAR antenna. Using a ground plane with a skirt, an acceptable return loss performance has been achieved for the antenna's main building M. J. Bembe ii block, a monopole element, in both frequency bands. The challenge was found in steering of the beam in different directions; it was then concluded that the usage of more elements could provide the necessary freedom for the optimisation process. Six elements were arranged symmetrically close to the active fed element in order to achieve a dual band resonance, with different designs meeting the requirements differently.

40|$|Multiple-Input-Multiple-Output (MIMO) is a {{technology}} that uses multiple antennas at both the transmitter and the receiver {{to be able to}} enhance the spectral efficiency. This technology gained a high popularity among researchers, which shows off in the high number of publications on the area. There are however some drawbacks when it comes to how many antennas may be put inside a small volume, when it is required that each additional antenna should give a substantial increase in the obtained spectral efficiency. This dissertation considers an alternative approach for achieving higher capacities. Part I of the thesis explores the concept of a virtually fast rotating directional receive antenna, which rotates once or several times during a symbol interval. The antenna rotation is obtained by using a single active <b>antenna</b> <b>element</b> and multiple <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements.</b> This concept has some similarities with MIMO technology, but also many differences. The rotating antenna consists of multiple antennas which also MIMO receivers do. In addition, the antenna rotation results in spatial multiplexing, which is also obtained by MIMO receivers. It is shown in the thesis that the rotating receiver antenna provides a much higher capacity than a single receiver antenna. But at the same time, it looses in terms of capacity performance when comparing with multiple antennas that occupy the same volume as the rotating antenna. Part II of the thesis considers a novel compact transmitter that consists of a single active <b>antenna</b> <b>element</b> and multiple <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements.</b> The <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements</b> are used for creating directive antenna patterns. The directive antenna patterns are not used for achieving high signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) at the receiver as in beamforming, but rather the choice of antenna pattern itself represents information. The transmitter encodes information both by the choice of antenna pattern (chooses possibly a different antenna pattern on each symbol interval) and the choice of symbol to be transmitted with the antenna pattern. The spectral efficiency obtained by this scheme is demonstrated to be comparable to the performance of widely spaced antennas. The similarity between Part I and I I of the thesis is that in both cases a single active <b>antenna</b> <b>element</b> and multiple <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements</b> are considered. In addition, the <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements</b> are used for creating antenna patterns, which means that the mutual coupling between the <b>antenna</b> <b>elements</b> is taken advantage of.

Results for the horizontal coverage are presented with the main beam(s) directed at 00, 900, 1800, and/or 2700, as well as for an omnidirectional configuration resemblance. It is expected that increasing the number of <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements</b> will improve directional properties further...|$|R
40|$|<b>Parasitic</b> <b>elements</b> do {{not show}} up on the {{schematic}} or parts list! Even though much attention has been focused recently on modeling of power supply circuits, that one major drawback has greatly diminished the success and effectiveness of modeling. Values of <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements</b> are not easily determined. This paper describes the application of computer-aided engineering and computer-aided test equipment, which can identify and quantify these <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements.</b> Actual test data are used to determine component values in a model where five of the eight components are <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements...</b>|$|R

The aim is to realize an antenna with a dipolar radiation at several resonance frequencies. The radiating element is a monopole antenna. This antenna naturally exhibits a dipole and quadripole radiation pattern {{for the first and}} second resonance frequency respectively. This behavior is due to the current distribution on the antenna. To constrain the second mode to change into a dipolar radiation pattern, two decorrelated and non-radiating <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements</b> are added to the antenna. At this second resonance frequency, the current distribution is different from the one of the quadripolar mode by the <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements.</b> The dimensions of these <b>parasitic</b> <b>elements</b> are defined by electromagnetic simulation and measurement. To validate this method, the monopole antenna is studied. The radiating <b>element</b> of the <b>antenna</b> is sewn on the textile flexible substrate. This substrate was previously characterized in terms of relative permittivity and losses. The near-field magnetic field and the far-field radiation pattern are studied in simulations and measurements...|$|R
50|$|One way of {{thinking}} about the operation of such an antenna is to consider a <b>parasitic</b> <b>element</b> to be a normal dipole element of finite diameter fed at its centre, with a short circuit across its feed point. As is well known in transmission line theory, a short circuit reflects all of the incident power 180 degrees out of phase. So one could as well model the operation of the <b>parasitic</b> <b>element</b> as the superposition of a dipole element receiving power and sending it down a transmission line to a matched load, and a transmitter sending the same amount of power up the transmission line back toward the <b>antenna</b> <b>element.</b> If the transmitted voltage wave were 180 degrees out of phase with the received wave at that point, the superposition of the two voltage waves would give zero voltage, equivalent to shorting out the dipole at the feedpoint (making it a solid element, as it is). Thus a half-wave <b>parasitic</b> <b>element</b> radiates a wave 180° out of phase with the incident wave.|$|R
