25|$|Often, {{archaeology}} {{provides the}} only means to learn of the existence and behaviors of people of the past. Across the millennia many thousands of cultures and societies and billions of <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> and gone of which {{there is little or}} no written record or existing records are misrepresentative or incomplete. Writing as it is known today did not exist in human civilization until the 4th millennium BC, in a relatively small number of technologically advanced civilizations. In contrast, Homo sapiens has existed for at least 200,000 years, and other species of Homo for millions of years (see Human evolution). These civilizations are, not coincidentally, the best-known; they are open to the inquiry of historians for centuries, while the study of pre-historic cultures has arisen only recently. Even within a literate civilization many events and important human practices are not officially recorded. Any knowledge of the early years of human civilization – the development of agriculture, cult practices of folk religion, the rise of the first cities – must come from archaeology.|$|E

500|$|Discussing the {{apparent}} {{failure of the}} cinematic universe's first team-up film, , to establish a successful equivalent to the MCU, Todd VanDerWerff noted that where the MCU has a television-like [...] "showrunner" [...] in Feige, [...] "the visionary behind Marvel's entire slate", the DCEU has director Zack Snyder, whose DC films [...] "seemingly start from the assumption that <b>people</b> <b>have</b> <b>come</b> not to see an individual story but {{a long series of}} teases for other ones.

TV certainly isn't immune to that problem, but shows that get caught up in high-concept premises and big-picture thinking before doing the necessary legwork to establish characters and their relationships tend to be canceled." [...] Subsequently, in May 2016, Warner Bros. gave oversight of the DCEU to Johns and executive Jon Berg in an attempt to [...] "unify the disparate elements of the DC movies" [...] and emulate Marvel's success.

After the successful release of Wonder Woman in June 2017, DC decided to begin deemphasizing the shared nature of their films, with DC Entertainment president Diane Nelson stating, [...] "Our intention, certainly, moving forward is using the continuity to help make sure nothing is diverging in a way that doesn’t make sense, but there’s no insistence upon an overall story line or interconnectivity in that universe... Moving forward, you’ll see the DC movie universe being a universe, but one that comes from the heart of the filmmaker who’s creating them."
