5|$|As the {{collapse}} continues, the rotation rate can increase {{to the point}} where the accreting <b>protostar</b> can break up due to centrifugal force at the equator. Thus the rotation rate must be braked during the first 100,000years to avoid this scenario. One possible explanation for the braking is the interaction of the protostar's magnetic field with the stellar wind in magnetic braking. The expanding wind carries away the angular momentum and slows down the rotation rate of the collapsing <b>protostar.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{main problem}} in the physics of {{accretion}} disks is the generation of turbulence and the mechanism responsible for the high effective viscosity. The turbulent viscosity {{is thought to be}} responsible for the transport of the mass to the central <b>protostar</b> and momentum to the periphery of the disk. This is vital for accretion, because the gas can be accreted by the central <b>protostar</b> only if it loses most of its angular momentum, which must be carried away by the small part of the gas drifting outwards. The result of this process is the growth of both the <b>protostar</b> and of the disk radius, which can reach 1,000AU if the initial angular momentum of the nebula is large enough. Large disks are routinely observed in many star-forming regions such as the Orion nebula.|$|E

We use maps of dust emission at multiple wavelengths to determine the column density structure of the cloud. In combination with an empirically verified model of the magnitude distribution of background stars, this column density map allows us to reliably determine overdensities of red sources that are due to embedded <b>protostars</b> in the cloud. We also identify <b>protostars</b> through their extended emission in the K band which comes from excited H 2 in protostellar outflows or reflection nebulosity. We find a population of distributed low-mass <b>protostars,</b> suggesting that low-mass <b>protostars</b> may form earlier than, or contemporaneously with, high-mass <b>protostars</b> in such a filament. The low-mass protostellar population may also produce the narrow line-width SiO emission observed in some clouds without high-mass <b>protostars.</b> Finally, we use a molecular line map of the cloud to determine the virial pa-rameter per unit length along the filament and find that the highest mass <b>protostars</b> form in the most bound portion of the filament, as suggested by theoretical models. 1...|$|R
50|$|In 1990, Kenyon, Hartmann and Karen & Steve Strom {{identified}} the luminosity problem: <b>protostars</b> in the Taurus-Auriga star-forming region are approximately 10 times less luminous than predicted by star formation theory. In this theory, <b>protostars</b> form by gravitational {{collapse of a}} cloud of gas and dust. Over their lifetimes, <b>protostars</b> radiate a total energy comparable to their binding energy. With apparent lifetimes of about 100,000 yr, they have expected luminosities of 10-20 larger than the solar luminosity. Recent observations of larger numbers of <b>protostars</b> with the Spitzer Space Telescope confirm that <b>protostars</b> have typical luminosities closer to the solar luminosity. Kenyon and colleagues identified several possible solutions to this luminosity problem. Adopting larger ages allows <b>protostars</b> to radiate {{the same amount of}} energy over a longer time, reducing their average luminosity. If <b>protostars</b> spend a small fraction of their lifetimes at much higher luminosity, as in the FU Orionis stars, then their average luminosity can be much larger than their typical luminosity. McKee & Offner note that ejecting material in a bipolar outflow reduces the expected luminosity of <b>protostars</b> but does not resolve the luminosity problem. Data from Spitzer resolve the luminosity problem by deriving better estimates for the time spent in a high luminosity state and larger ages of 300,000 yr for <b>protostars.</b> This resolution leads to an improved understanding of the early life histories of stars.|$|R
5|$|However, that meaning {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the process of accretion forming the planets. In this context, accretion refers to the process of cooled, solidified grains of dust and ice orbiting the <b>protostar</b> in the protoplanetary disk, colliding and sticking together and gradually growing, up to and including the high-energy collisions between sizable planetesimals.|$|E
5|$|The initial {{collapse}} of a solar-mass protostellar nebula takes around 100,000years. Every nebula begins {{with a certain amount}} of angular momentum. Gas in the central part of the nebula, with relatively low angular momentum, undergoes fast compression and forms a hot hydrostatic (not contracting) core containing a small fraction of the mass of the original nebula. This core forms the seed of what will become a star. As the collapse continues, conservation of angular momentum means that the rotation of the infalling envelop accelerates, which largely prevents the gas from directly accreting onto the central core. The gas is instead forced to spread outwards near its equatorial plane, forming a disk, which in turn accretes onto the core. The core gradually grows in mass until it becomes a young hot <b>protostar.</b> At this stage, the <b>protostar</b> and its disk are heavily obscured by the infalling envelope and are not directly observable. In fact the remaining envelope's opacity is so high that even millimeter-wave radiation has trouble escaping from inside it. Such objects are observed as very bright condensations, which emit mainly millimeter-wave and submillimeter-wave radiation. They are classified as spectral Class0 protostars. The collapse is often accompanied by bipolar outflows—jets—that emanate along the rotational axis of the inferred disk. The jets are frequently observed in star-forming regions (see Herbig–Haro (HH) objects). The luminosity of the Class0 protostars is high— a solar-mass <b>protostar</b> may radiate at up to 100 solar luminosities. The source of this energy is gravitational collapse, as their cores are not yet hot enough to begin nuclear fusion.|$|E
5|$|The {{protoplanetary disk}} is {{sometimes}} referred to as an accretion disk, because while the young T Tauri-like <b>protostar</b> is still contracting, gaseous material may still be falling onto it, accreting on its surface from the disk's inner edge. In an accretion disk, there is a net flux of mass from larger radii toward smaller radii.|$|E

We use observations of 20 <b>protostars</b> of both Class 0 and I taken in the HCO+ (J= 3 - 2) line that show the classic double-peaked profile. We find that some Class 0 sources show high levels of turbulence whilst others demonstrate much lower levels. In Class I <b>protostars</b> we find predominantly low levels of turbulence. The observations are consistent with a scenario in which Class 0 <b>protostars</b> form {{in a variety of}} environments and subsequently evolve into Class I <b>protostars.</b> The data {{do not appear to be}} consistent with a recently proposed scenario in which Class 0 <b>protostars</b> can only form in extreme environments.

50|$|The modern {{picture of}} <b>protostars,</b> {{summarized}} above, was first suggested by Chushiro Hayashi. In the first models, {{the size of}} <b>protostars</b> was greatly overestimated.

This basic theoretical result has been confirmed by observations, which find that the largest pre-main-sequence stars are also of modest size.|$|R
5|$|Under certain {{circumstances}} the disk, which {{can now be}} called protoplanetary, may {{give birth to a}} planetary system. Protoplanetary disks have been observed around a very high fraction of stars in young star clusters. They exist from the beginning of a star's formation, but at the earliest stages are unobservable due to the opacity of the surrounding envelope. The disk of a Class0 <b>protostar</b> is thought to be massive and hot. It is an accretion disk, which feeds the central <b>protostar.</b> The temperature can easily exceed 400K inside 5AU and 1,000K inside 1AU. The heating of the disk is primarily caused by the viscous dissipation of turbulence in it and by the infall of the gas from the nebula. The high temperature in the inner disk causes most of the volatile material—water, organics, and some rocks to evaporate, leaving only the most refractory elements like iron. The ice can survive only in the outer part of the disk.|$|E
5|$|Stars are {{believed}} to form {{as the result of}} a collapse of a low-temperature cloud of gas and dust. As the cloud collapses, conservation of angular momentum causes any small net rotation of the cloud to increase, forcing the material into a rotating disk. At the dense center of this disk a <b>protostar</b> forms, which gains heat from the gravitational energy of the collapse.|$|E
5|$|The {{study of}} stars and stellar {{evolution}} is fundamental {{to our understanding of}} the Universe. The astrophysics of stars has been determined through observation and theoretical understanding; and from computer simulations of the interior. Star formation occurs in dense regions of dust and gas, known as giant molecular clouds. When destabilized, cloud fragments can collapse under the influence of gravity, to form a <b>protostar.</b> A sufficiently dense, and hot, core region will trigger nuclear fusion, thus creating a main-sequence star.|$|E
40|$|In recent {{simulations}} of primordial star-forming clouds, {{it has been}} shown that a number of primordial <b>protostars</b> are ejected from the cluster of their origin with the velocity exceeding their escape velocity. There is a possibility that some of these <b>protostars</b> can enter the main sequence and survive until the present epoch. We develop a semi-analytical model guided by results of cosmological simulations to study the mass accretion by these <b>protostars</b> as a function of the original stellar mass, and other parameters such as angular momentum and gravitational drag due to ambient gas. We aim to determine whether the <b>protostars</b> can remain sufficiently low-mass and long-lived to survive to the present day. This requires that the <b>protostars</b> stop accreting before being ejected from the cluster, and have a final mass less than 0. 8 Msolar. Assuming the <b>protostars</b> obey the spherical Bondi-Hoyle flow while interacting with the ambient gas medium, we show that Pop III <b>protostars</b> which initially form within a certain range of mass M < 0. 65 Msolar and velocity larger than the escape velocity may survive with a mass lower than the cutoff.

40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a prescription for}} the luminosity from accreting <b>protostars</b> into smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulation and apply the method to simulations of five primordial minihaloes generated from cosmological initial conditions. We find that accretion luminosity delays fragmentation within the haloes but does not prevent it. In haloes that slowly form a low number of <b>protostars,</b> the accretion luminosity can {{reduce the number of}} fragments that are formed before the <b>protostars</b> start ionizing their surroundings. However, haloes that rapidly form many <b>protostars</b> become dominated by dynamical processes, and the effect of accretion luminosity becomes negligible. Generally, the fragmentation found in the haloes is highly dependent on the initial conditions. Accretion luminosity does not substantially affect the accretion rates experienced by the <b>protostars</b> and is far less important than dynamical interactions, which can lead to ejections that effectively terminate the accretion. We find that the accretion rates on to the inner regions of the discs (20 au) around the <b>protostars</b> are highly variable, in contrast to the constant or smoothly decreasing accretion rates currently used in models of the pre-main-sequence evolution of Population III stars...|$|R
5|$|Because of the {{conservation}} of angular momentum, the nebula spun faster as it collapsed. As the material within the nebula condensed, the atoms within it began to collide with increasing frequency, converting their kinetic energy into heat. The centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. Over about 100,000 years, the competing forces of gravity, gas pressure, magnetic fields, and rotation caused the contracting nebula to flatten into a spinning protoplanetary disc with a diameter of about 200AU and form a hot, dense <b>protostar</b> (a star in which hydrogen fusion has not yet begun) at the centre.|$|E
5|$|The {{physics of}} {{accretion}} disks encounters some problems. The {{most important one}} is how the material, which is accreted by the <b>protostar,</b> loses its angular momentum. One possible explanation suggested by Hannes Alfvén was that angular momentum was shed by the solar wind during its T Tauri star phase. The momentum is transported to the outer parts of the disk by viscous stresses. Viscosity is generated by macroscopic turbulence, but the precise mechanism that produces this turbulence is not well understood. Another possible process for shedding angular momentum is magnetic braking, where the spin of the star is transferred into the surrounding disk via that star's magnetic field. The main processes responsible for {{the disappearance of the}} gas in disks are viscous diffusion and photo-evaporation.|$|E
5|$|The various {{planets are}} thought to have formed from the solar nebula, the {{disc-shaped}} cloud of gas and dust left over from the Sun's formation. The currently accepted method by which the planets formed is accretion, in which the planets began as dust grains in orbit around the central <b>protostar.</b> Through direct contact, these grains formed into clumps up to 200 metres in diameter, which in turn collided to form larger bodies (planetesimals) of ~10kilometres (km) in size. These gradually increased through further collisions, growing at the rate of centimetres per year {{over the course of the}} next few million years.|$|E

We derived simple analytic estimates of accretion rates and final masses of <b>protostars.</b> Results. Radiation-driven implosion mechanism can increase accretion rates of <b>protostars</b> by 1 - 2 orders of magnitude.

5|$|When a <b>protostar</b> {{is formed}} from the {{collapse}} of a giant molecular cloud of gas and dust in the local interstellar medium, the initial composition is homogeneous throughout, consisting of about 70% hydrogen, 28% helium and trace amounts of other elements, by mass. The initial mass of the star depends on the local conditions within the cloud. (The mass distribution of newly formed stars is described empirically by the initial mass function.) During the initial collapse, this pre-main-sequence star generates energy through gravitational contraction. Upon reaching a suitable density, energy generation is begun at the core using an exothermic nuclear fusion process that converts hydrogen into helium.|$|E

5|$|The Solar System formed 4.568 {{billion years}} ago from the {{gravitational}} collapse of a region within a large molecular cloud. This initial cloud was likely several light-years across and probably birthed several stars. As is typical of molecular clouds, this one consisted mostly of hydrogen, with some helium, and small amounts of heavier elements fused by previous generations of stars. As the region that would become the Solar System, known as the pre-solar nebula, collapsed, conservation of angular momentum caused it to rotate faster. The centre, {{where most of the}} mass collected, became increasingly hotter than the surrounding disc. As the contracting nebula rotated faster, it began to flatten into a protoplanetary disc with a diameter of roughly 200AU and a hot, dense <b>protostar</b> at the centre. The planets formed by accretion from this disc, in which dust and gas gravitationally attracted each other, coalescing to form ever larger bodies.

These <b>protostars</b> were ejected from the central gas cloud by N-body interactions with more massive <b>protostars</b> and stopped accreting.
