50|$|Long {{distance}} {{calling from}} landlines was opened to {{competition in the}} early 1990s {{and the use of}} long distance revenue to subsidise local service phased out a few years later. It is not possible for mobile telephone subscribers or coin-paid telephone users to select a default carrier, so long distance calls are often priced higher from these services. The use of <b>prepaid</b> <b>telephone</b> calling <b>cards</b> is a possible workaround.|$|R
2500|$|Greece {{issued a}} postage stamp in his honour (1996) and a <b>prepaid</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>card</b> (1996). However, the Greek state {{after the fall of}} the Colonels did not honor him for a long time. For instance, his actions are not {{mentioned}} in school textbooks, with very few exceptions. There is still growing suspicion regarding this, given that a minority of active current politicians in Greece are allegedly linked to the Colonels' regime and do not wish to promote Panagoulis' deeds. The Greek Ministry of Culture (under the minister Evangelos Venizelos) refused to contribute €1,500 in order to facilitate the translated publication of Panagoulis' poems. This has changed during the last years: by 2008, 22 streets in Athens and its suburbs are named after him and a metro station in Athens (Agios Dimitrios, which is close to the place of his death) was renamed to carry his name (...)

50|$|The {{postage meter}} {{normally}} {{consists of a}} keyboard for entering the postage, three seals, and a stamping mechanism. Years ago, users needed to take their meter to a postal office in order to add additional postage (sometimes called a “reset” or “refill”). That changed in 1979 when Pitney Bowes invented remote meter resetting, otherwise known as Postage by Phone. Today, users can add to their postage balance by <b>telephone,</b> <b>prepaid</b> <b>cards,</b> via the web or through a direct connection over the Internet. The first counter shows the remaining balance. The second counter shows the total postage of the franked consignments. The third one counts the number of prints and is for statistic purposes only.|$|R

50|$|Whilst {{the full}} 5,000 {{production}} of KX+ remain today, a successful scheme {{which took place}} {{around the same time}} as the introduction of the KX+ was to reinstall the iconic K6 design telephone boxes in places that have parted with them, with many places continuing to be reunited with K6s. These replacement projects have included replacing a KX altogether, such as in Hampstead Norreys, Berkshire in December 2009, following a campaign of 600 protesters. BT phonecards with a magnetic stripe are no longer sold but it is still possible to use <b>prepaid</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>cards</b> in BT phone boxes by manually keying in the card access number and PIN number. Another development that became possible after the deregulation of the telephone industry of 1996 was that many companies followed in Mercury Communications' footsteps by erecting their own kiosks, including Spectrum Interactive and Cable & Wireless. Perhaps in another attempt to sustain public usage of payphones, several modern BT payphone kiosks have a cash machine on one side, some of them, introduced in 2005, taking the shape of the KX+. In 2005, BT announced they were scrapping plans to remove 200 telephone boxes in rural Yorkshire owing to their importance to the isolated communities.|$|E
5000|$|The hobby is {{sometimes}} called [...] "fusilately" [...] in the UK and a collector {{is known as a}} [...] "fusilatelist"; In the USA it is called [...] "telegery". The word 'telegery' pronounced: TELL EGG UH REE was introduced in 1993 by Dr. Gary S. Felton in his published article WHAT'S IN A NAME? (see citation #5 below). The article summarizes the history of different terms used to name the hobby of collecting <b>prepaid</b> <b>telephone</b> <b>cards,</b> none of which actually was ever used across the board internationally. To speak to this issue, Dr. Felton (author of more than 125 professional articles on the subject of 'telephone cards') brought the non-unanimity of a name for the hobby to attention and showed through linguistic process and reasoning that + phone + card + legery = + (phone card) + legery = + legery = telegery. This concept called 'blended definition' was soon accepted internationally and adopted in general use and to this day is not only the American way of naming the hobby, but is internationally referred to when talking about the collecting of phonecards. Phonecards have been collected worldwide since the mid-1970s and peaked in the mid-1990s, when over 2 million people collected phonecards.|$|E
5000|$|Stored-value {{cards are}} most {{commonly}} used for low-value transactions, such as transit system farecards, <b>telephone</b> <b>prepaid</b> calling <b>cards,</b> cafeterias, or for micropayments in shops or vending machines. They also have an advantage over most other payment cards in that when making, say, a purchase telecommunication facilities are not needed, which may be important in situations where the availability or reliability of these facilities are uncertain or costly, especially for low-value transactions. A benefit to the merchant is that bank transaction fees are not incurred as the transaction is processed offline and there {{need not be a}} reference to the bank for processing. A limitation is that these cards cannot be used for online, telephone, mail order and other [...] "card not present transactions".|$|R
