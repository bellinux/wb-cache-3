This paper presents a color laser <b>printer</b> <b>identification</b> method based on cascaded learning of deep neural networks. The refiner network is trained by adversarial training to refine the synthetic dataset for halftone color decomposition. The halftone color decomposing ConvNet is trained with the refined dataset, and the trained knowledge is transferred to the printer identifying ConvNet to enhance the accuracy. The robustness about rotation and scaling is considered in training process, which is not considered in existing methods.

In this study developed a <b>printer</b> forensic <b>identification</b> process, especially compared with the comparative evidence documents originating from the printer that has the same type and type. Tests carried out using five types of printer, one of which is a printer used to print the proof.

40|$|This paper explores current <b>printer</b> <b>identification</b> {{techniques}} {{which allow}} {{the origins of}} a printed document to be established. The printer {{used to create a}} particular document can be traced by using unique and hidden information contained within that document. <b>Printer</b> <b>identification</b> can ultimately lead to the printer’s owner(s) which provides a valuable tool to government agencies during criminal investigations involving forged documents or associated correspondence. Two groups of <b>printer</b> <b>identification</b> technique are examined. Passive techniques utilise microscopic flaws in a document’s print for printer matching while active techniques explicitly embed traceable data into a document. Evidence has emerged to suggest that embedding tracking data into printed documents has been employed since the 1980 s.

40|$|We {{present a}} {{forensic}} technique for analyzing a printed image {{in order to}} trace the originating printer. Our method, which is applicable for commonly used electrophotographic (EP) printers, operates by exploiting the geometric distortion that these devices inevitably introduce in the printing process. In the proposed method, first a geometric distortion signature is estimated for an EP printer. This estimate is obtained using only the images printed on the printer and without access to the internal printer controls. Once a database of printer signatures is available, the printer utilized to print a test image is identified by computing the geometric distortion signature from test image and correlating the computes signatures against the printer signatures in the database. Experiments conducted over a corpus of EP printers demonstrate that the geometric distortion signatures of test documents exhibit high correlation with the corresponding printer signatures and a low correlation with other printer signatures. The method is therefore quite promising for forensic <b>printer</b> <b>identification</b> applications. We highlight several of the capabilities and challenges for the method.

In the electrophotographic process (EP) quasiperiodic banding artifacts {{can be used as}} an effective intrinsic signature. However, in text only document analysis, the absence of large midtone areas makes it difficult to capture suitable signals for banding detection. Frequency domain analysis based on the projection signals of individual characters does not provide enough resolution for proper <b>printer</b> <b>identification.</b> Advanced pattern recognition techniques and knowledge about the print mechanism can help us to device an appropriate method to detect these signatures.

In order to create a highly effective pattern recognition tool, this high dimensional projection data has to be represented in a low dimensional space. The dimension reduction can be performed by some well known pattern recognition techniques. Then a classifier can be built based on the reduced dimension data set. A popular choice is the Gaussian Mixture Model where each printer can be represented by a Gaussian distribution. The distributions of all the printers help us to determine the mixing coefficient for the projection from an unknown printer. Finally, the decision making algorithm can vote for the correct printer.

Identifying the {{originating}} {{device for}} a given media, i. e. the type, brand, model and other characteristics of the device, is currently {{one of the important}} fields of digital forensics. This paper proposes a forensic technique based on the Benford’s law to identify the printer’s brand and model from the printed-and-scanned images at which the first digit probability distribution of multi-size block DCT coefficients are extracted that constitutes a feature vector as the input to support vector machine (SVM) classifier. The proposed technique is different from the traditional use of noise feature patterns appeared in the literature.

One of the major image quality issues in EP printers is known as banding which {{is related to the}} fluctuations of the internal printer components. In this thesis, we have proposed a robust and accurate system for banding measurement from the output of an EP printer. The developed tool will measure banding frequencies of a monochrome EP printer from different independent sources. The complete system includes a measurement unit, a specially designed test page, and analysis software. The banding measurement tool will be helpful in the development of new monochrome EP printers by providing a quantitative assessment of banding characteristics for these engines. The banding artifact can also be treated as an intrinsic signature of a printer {{that can be used to}} identify a specific printer. <b>Printer</b> <b>identification</b> based on a printed document has many desirable forensic applications.

In addition to intrinsic features (intrinsic signatures) of the printer, modulating the printing process to embed specific features (extrinsic signatures) will further extend the encoding capacity and decoding accuracy. One {{of the key}} issues with embedding extrinsic signatures is that the embedding should not degrade the image quality, but needs to be detectable by a detection algorithm. In this dissertation, we will demonstrate the feasibility of embedding code sequences in EP halftone images by modulating dot size through laser intensity modulation. We have developed corresponding embedding and detection algorithms to embed and extract information. Experimental results indicate that using a 600 dpi native resolution printer 2 ̆ 7 s default halftone algorithm, we can encode 5 bits of information in every 310 printer scan-lines or approximately every 0. 5 inches. ^ We also develop a printing-scaning model incorporating {{the impact of the}} process modulation parameter, e. g. laser intensity, with a stochastic dot interaction model and scanner modulation transfer function (MTF) to estimate the impact of the modulation on a known halftone pattern. This model can be used to examine the embedding and detection algorithm without extensive measurements. Experimental data validates the effectiveness of the proposed model in predicting the impact of laser intensity modulation on the reflectance of the printout. ^ To ensure the extrinsic signature is detectable, the modulation amplitude can not be too low. To find the minimum modulation amplitude with required detection performance, significant amount of printing and measurements are needed. To reduce the required time and effort, a fast search based on a computational model is developed based on the proposed printing-scanning model. With the proposed fast search method, experimental data indicates that more than 90...|$|E
40|$|In {{this paper}} we propose a new {{imperceptible}} yellow printer dot watermarking scheme for documents printed on a colour printer. The scheme takes advantage of the imperfections of the human visual system to hide thousands of yellow dots over the entire page. It takes inspiration from the methods used by laser printer manufacturers for <b>printer</b> <b>identification.</b> The novelty of our approach is in providing an automatic embedding and detection method that can survive the distortions of printing and scanning. In order to achieve this a new moving window detection method is proposed. An error correction code is employed to handle the errors that could be present following detection. The scheme is evaluated through embedding and detection experiments on different types of documents; including text, architectural drawings and a cartoon. Our scheme offers an embedding capacity of 26, 190 bits per page. Experiments were conducted using error correction codes with rates of 1 / 2, 1 / 3 and 1 / 5, given payloads of 13, 095, 8, 730, and 5, 238 bits per A 4 page respectively. We are able to successfully recover the watermark in all documents at a rate of 1 / 2 and 1 / 5, and in all document except one at 1 / 3. Further experiments were conducted with a smaller dot size to evaluate the impact it has on our results. With the smaller dot size we were still able to recover the watermarks from all documents when using an error correction code with rate 1 / 5. The capacity offered by this approach far exceeds the capacity offered by existing binary watermarking schemes, which are robust to printing and scanning. The substantially larger capacity opens up a wider range of possible applications as well as the possibility of using more robust cryptographic techniques for authentication...|$|E
40|$|In today 2 ̆ 7 s digital world {{securing}} {{different forms}} of content {{is very important in}} terms of protecting copyright and verifying authenticity. One example is watermarking of digital audio and images. We believe that a marking scheme analogous to digital watermarking but for documents is very important. There currently exist techniques to secure documents such as bank notes using paper watermarks, security fibers, holograms, or special inks. There are a number of applications in which it is desirable to be able to identify the technology, manufacturer, model, or specific unit that was used to print a given document even if the printer in question does not make use of these existing security devices to explicitly identify itself. It would be useful to achieve the same or a better level of protection without the use of any additional devices or technologies. Two strategies are proposed for <b>printer</b> <b>identification</b> based upon examination of a printed document. The first strategy is passive. It involves characterization of the printer by finding features in the printed document that are intrinsic to that particular printer, model, or manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s products. The second strategy is active. It involves the embedding of an extrinsic signature into a printed page. This signature can be generated by modulating the process parameters of the printer mechanism to encode identifying information such as the printer serial number and date of printing. It is shown that good separation between printers is achievable using gray-level co-occurrence based texture features obtained from text documents. Experiments using ten printers and a support vector machine classifier show very low classification error even between printers with the same electromechanical structure. The technique is also shown to work for various font sizes, font types, paper types, and printer age. The features are observed to migrate with the age of the consumables indicating that {{it may be possible to}} estimate the age of the consumables at the time of printing. In addition, the intrinsic nature of the features makes it difficult to obscure or remove them without physically modifying the printer itself. Combining both texture features and banding features it is possible to identify a printer under several attack scenarios. A coding technique for embedding extrinsic signatures in text documents is presented. Both time and frequency domain signaling and detection schemes are investigated. It is shown that better performance is achieved using a time domain signaling scheme with a correlation detector due to the limited length of text character edges.

40|$|Printed media, such as facsimile, newspaper, document, {{magazine}} {{and any other}} publishing works, {{plays an important role}} in communicating information in today's world. The printed media can be easily manipulated by advanced image editing software. Image authentication techniques are, therefore, indispensable for preventing undesired manipulations and protecting infringement of copyright. In this thesis, we investigate image authentication for multi-level greyscale and halftone images using digital watermarking, image hashing and digital forensic techniques including application for printing-and-scanning process. Digital watermarking is the process of embedding information into the cover image which is used to verify its authenticity. The challenge of digital watermarking is the trade-off between embedding capacity and image imperceptibility. In this thesis, we compare the work of halftone watermarking algorithm proposed by Fu and Au. We observe that the image perceptual quality is reduced after watermark embedding due to the problems of sharpening distortion and uneven tonality distribution. To optimize the imperceptibility of watermark embedding, we propose an iterative linear gain halftoning algorithm. Our experiments show that the proposed halftone watermarking algorithm improves a significant amount of image quality of 6. 5 % to 12 % by Weighted Signal-to- Noise Ratio (WSNR) and of 11 % to 23 % by Visual Information Fidelity (VIF), compared to Fu and Au's algorithm. While halftone watermarking provides a limited robustness against print-and-scan processes, im- age hashing provides an alternative way to verify the authenticity of the content. Little work has been reported for image hashing to printed media. In this thesis, we develop a novel image hashing algorithm based on SIFT local descriptor and introduce a normalization procedure to syn- chronize the printed-and-scanned image. We compare our proposed hashing algorithm with the singular value decomposition based image hashing (SVD-hash) and feature-point based image hashing (FP-hash) using the average Normalized Hamming Distance (NHD) and the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC). The proposed hash algorithm has shown good performance trade-off between robustness and discrimination, as compared to the SVD-hash and FP-hash al- gorithms quantified by the results obtained via NHD and ROC. Our proposed algorithm is found to be robust against a wide range of content preserving attacks, including non-geometric attacks, geometric attacks and printing-and-scanning. For our work in digital forensics, we propose in this thesis a statistical approach based on Multi- sized block Benford's Law (MBL), and a texture analysis based on Local Binary Pattern (LBP) to identify the origins of printed documents. We compare MBL-based and LBP-based approaches to a statistical feature-based approach proposed by Gou et al [...] The proposed MBL-based approach provides an ability to identify printers from a relatively diverse sets, while it proves less accurate at identifying printers of similar models. The proposed LBP-based approach provides a highly accurate identification rate at approximately 99. 4 %, with a low variance. In particular, our LBP- based approach only causes 2 % mis-identification rate between two identical printers, whereas Gou et al. 's approach causes 20 % mis-identification rate. Our proposed LBP-based approach has also successfully demonstrated on printed-and-scanned text documents. Moreover, it remains robust against common image processing attacks, including averaging filtering, median filtering, sharpening, rotation, resizing, and JPEG compression, with computational efficiency of the order of O(N).
