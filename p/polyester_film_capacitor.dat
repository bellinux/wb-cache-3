25|$|Modern {{electronic}} ballasts usually {{change the}} frequency of the power from a standard mains frequency of 50 or 60 Hz up to 40 kHz or higher, often using a Switched Mode Power Supply (SMPS) circuit topology with Power Factor Correction (PFC). First the AC input power is rectified to DC, and then it is chopped at a high frequency to improve the power factor. In more expensive ballasts, a film capacitor is often paired with the inductor to correct the power factor. In the picture at right, the flat grey rectangular component {{in the middle of the}} ballast circuit is a <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> used for PFC.|$|E

25|$|The small {{physical}} dimensions of PET <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{are the result}} of a high relative permittivity of 3.3, combined with a relatively high dielectric strength leads to a relatively high volumetric efficiency. This advantage of compactness comes with some disadvantages. The capacitance temperature dependence of <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> is relatively high compared to other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors,</b> ±5% over the entire temperature range. The capacitance frequency dependence of <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> compared with the other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> is -3% in the range from 100nbsp&Hz to 100nbsp&kHz at the upper limit. Also, the temperature and frequency dependence of the dissipation factor are higher for <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> compared with the other <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> types.|$|R

25|$|<b>Film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{have become}} much smaller since the {{beginning}} of the technology. Through development of thinner plastic films, for example, the dimensions of metallized <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> were decreased by a factor of approximately 3 to 4.|$|R
25|$|For simple higher-frequency filter circuits, or in voltage {{regulator}} or voltage doubler circuits, low-cost metallized <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> provide long-term stability, and can replace more-expensive tantalum capacitors. Because capacitors pass AC signals but block DC, <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> with their high insulation resistance and low self-inductance are well-suited as signal coupling capacitors for higher frequencies. For similar reasons, <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{are widely used}} as decoupling capacitors to suppress noise or transients.|$|R
2500|$|Polystyrene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors,</b> {{sometimes}} {{known as}} [...] "Styroflex Capacitors", were {{well known for}} many years as inexpensive <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> for general purpose applications, in which high capacitance stability, low dissipation factor and low leakage currents were needed. But because the film thickness could be not made thinner than 10nbsp&µm, and the maximum temperature ratings reached only 85nbsp&°C, the PS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> have mostly been replaced by <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> as of 2012. However, some manufacturers may still offer PS <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> in their production program, backed by large amounts of polystyrene film stocked in their warehouse.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Polyester</b> <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> using a {{dielectric}} {{made of the}} thermoplastic polar polymer material {{polyethylene terephthalate}} (PET), trade names Hostaphan or Mylar®, from the polyester family. [...] They are manufactured both as metallized wound and stacked versions, as well as film/foil types. The <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> adsorbs very little moisture, and this feature makes it suitable for [...] "naked" [...] designs without any further coating needed. They are the low-cost mass-produced capacitors in modern electronics, featuring relatively small dimensions with relatively high capacitance values. [...] PET capacitors are mainly used as general purpose capacitors for DC applications, or for semi-critical circuits with operating temperatures up to 125 nbsp&°C. The maximum temperature rating of 125nbsp&°C also allows SMD <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> to be made with PET films. The low cost of polyester and the relatively compact dimensions are {{the main reasons for}} the high prevalence of PET <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> in modern designs.|$|R
2500|$|<b>Film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{made with}} lower-cost {{plastics}} {{are used for}} non-critical applications which do not require ultra-stable characteristics over a wide temperature range, such as for smoothing or AC signal coupling. [...] <b>Polyester</b> <b>film</b> (KT) <b>capacitors</b> of the [...] "stacked" [...] type are often used now instead of polystyrene capacitors (KS), which have become less available.|$|R
2500|$|An early special type {{of plastic}} <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> were the {{cellulose}} acetate <b>film</b> <b>capacitors,</b> also called MKU capacitors. The polar insulating dielectric cellulose acetate was a synthetic resin {{that could be}} made for metallized <b>capacitors</b> in paint <b>film</b> thickness down to about 3µm. [...] A liquid layer of cellulose acetate was first applied to a paper carrier, then covered with wax, dried and then metallized. During winding of the capacitor body, the paper was removed from the metallized film. The remaining thin cellulose acetate layer had a dielectric breakdown of 63V, enough for many of general purpose applications. The very small thickness of the dielectric decreased the overall dimensions of these capacitors compared to other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> of the time. MKU <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are no longer manufactured, because <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> can now be produced in the smaller sizes that were the market niche of the MKU type.|$|R
25|$|The voltage at the {{terminals}} {{generated by}} the dielectric absorption may possibly cause problems in the function of an electronic circuit. For sensitive analog circuits such as sample and hold circuits, integrators, charge amplifiers or high-quality audio circuits, Class-1 ceramic or polypropylene capacitors instead of Class-2 ceramic <b>capacitors,</b> <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> or electrolytic capacitors are used. For most electronic circuits, particularly filtering applications, the small dielectric absorption voltage has no influence on the proper electrical function of the circuit. For aluminum electrolytic capacitors with non-solid electrolyte which are not built into a circuit, the dielectric absorption voltage generated can be a personnel safety risk. The voltage can be quite substantial, for example 50V for 400V electrolytic capacitors, and can cause damages to semiconductor devices, or cause sparks during installation in the circuit. Larger aluminum electrolytic capacitors and high-voltage power capacitors are transported and delivered short-circuited to dissipate this unwanted and possibly dangerous energy.|$|R
2500|$|The {{rated voltage}} of {{different}} film materials depends on {{factors such as}} the thickness of the film, the quality of the material (freedom from physical defects and chemical impurities), the ambient temperature, and frequency of operation, plus a safety margin against the breakdown voltage (dielectric strength). But to a first approximation, the voltage rating of a <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> depends primarily on the thickness of the plastic film. For example, with the minimum available <b>film</b> thickness of <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> (about 0.7µm), it is possible to produce capacitors with a rated voltage of 400VDC. If higher voltages are needed, typically a thicker plastic film will be used. [...] But the breakdown voltage for dielectric films is usually nonlinear. For thicknesses greater than about 5 mils, the breakdown voltage only increases approximately with the square-root of the film thickness. On the other hand, the capacitance decreases linearly with increased film thickness. [...] For reasons of availability, storage and existing processing capabilities, it is desirable to achieve higher breakdown voltages while using existing available film materials. This can be achieved by a one-sided partial metallization of the insulating films in such a manner that an internal series connection of capacitors is produced. By using this series connection technique, the total breakdown voltage of the capacitor can be multiplied by an arbitrary factor, but the total capacitance is also reduced by the same factor.|$|R
40|$|The {{goal of the}} Development of High Temperature Capacitor Technology and Manufacturing Capability {{program was}} to mature a production-ready supply chain for {{reliable}} 250 °C FPE (fluorinated <b>polyester)</b> <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> by 2011. These high-temperature <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> enable both the down hole drilling and aerospace industries by enabling a variety of benefits including: − Deeper oil exploration in higher temperature and pressure environments − Enabling power electronic and control equipment to operate in higher temperature environments − Enabling reduced cooling requirements of electronics − Increasing reliability and life of capacitors operating below rated temperature − Enabling capacitors to handle higher electrical losses without overheating. The key challenges to bringing the FPE <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> to market have been manufacturing challenges including: − FPE Film is difficult to handle and wind, resulting in poor yields − Voltage breakdown strength decreases when the film is wound into capacitors (~ 70 % decrease) − Encapsulation technologies must be improved to enable higher temperature operation − Manufacturing and test cycle time is very long As {{a direct result of}} this program most of the manufacturing challenges have been met. The FPE film production metalization and winding yield has increased to over 82 % from 70 %, and the voltage breakdown strength of the wound capacitors has increased 270 % to 189 V/μm. The high temperature packaging concepts are showing significant progress including promising results for lead attachments and hermetic packages at 200 °C and non-hermetic packages at 250 °C. Manufacturing and test cycle time will decrease as the market for FPE capacitors develops...|$|R
25|$|The {{double-sided}} metallized film is electrostatically field-free {{because the}} electrodes {{have the same}} voltage potential {{on both sides of}} the film, and therefore does not contribute to the total capacitance of the <b>capacitor.</b> This <b>film</b> can therefore be made of a different and less expensive material. For example, a polypropylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> with double-sided metallization on a <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> carrier makes the capacitor not only cheaper but also smaller, because the thinner polyester foil improves the volumetric efficiency of the <b>capacitor.</b> <b>Film</b> <b>capacitors</b> with a double-sided metallized film effectively have thicker electrodes for higher surge current handling, but still do retain their self-healing properties, in contrast to the film/foil capacitors.|$|R
25|$|The plastic films {{used as the}} {{dielectric}} for <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are Polypropylene (PP), Polyester (PET), Polyphenylene sulfide (PPS), Polyethylene naphthalate (PEN), and Polytetrafluoroethylene or Teflon (PTFE). Polypropylene film material with a market share of something about 50% and <b>Polyester</b> <b>film</b> with something about 40% are the most used film materials. The rest of something about 10% will be used by all other materials including PPS and paper with roughly 3%, each.|$|R
2500|$|Polypropylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> have a {{dielectric}} {{made of the}} thermoplastic, non-polar, {{organic and}} partially crystalline polymer material Polypropylene (PP), trade name Treofan, from the family of polyolefins. They are manufactured both as metallized wound and stacked versions, as well as film/foil types. Polypropylene film is the most-used dielectric <b>film</b> in industrial <b>capacitors</b> and also in power capacitor types. The polypropylene film material absorbs less moisture than <b>polyester</b> <b>film</b> and is therefore also suitable for [...] "naked" [...] designs without any coating or further packaging. But the maximum temperature of 105nbsp&°C hinders use of PP films in SMD packaging.|$|R

25|$|In 1984, a new <b>film</b> <b>capacitor</b> {{technology}} that {{makes use of}} vacuum-deposited electron-beam cross-linked acrylate materials as dielectric in <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> was announced as a patent in the press.

25|$|These {{capacitors}} {{have a low}} {{dissipation factor}} and because of their relatively temperature-independent electrical properties of about ±80nbsp&ppm over the entire temperature range, they had many applications for low-loss and temperature-stable applications such as timing circuits, precision analog circuits, and signal filters in applications with tough environmental conditions. PC <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> had been manufactured since the mid-1950s, but the main supplier of polycarbonate <b>film</b> for <b>capacitors</b> had ceased the production of this polymer in film form as of the year 2000. As a result, most of the manufacturers of polycarbonate <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> worldwide had to stop their production of PC <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> and changed to polypropylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> instead.

25|$|A related type is {{the power}} <b>film</b> <b>capacitor.</b> The {{materials}} and construction techniques used for large power <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> mostly {{are similar to those}} of ordinary <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> However, capacitors with high to very high power ratings for applications in power systems and electrical installations are often classified separately, for historical reasons. The standardization of ordinary <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> is oriented on electrical and mechanical parameters. The standardization of power capacitors by contrast emphasizes the safety of personnel and equipment, as given by the local regulating authority.|$|R
25|$|From simple {{beginnings}} <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{developed into}} a very broad and highly specialized range of different types. By {{the end of the}} 20th century mass production of most <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> had shifted to the Far East.

2500|$|The {{dissipation}} factor of PP <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{is smaller than}} that of other <b>film</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Due to the low and very stable {{dissipation factor}} over a wide temperature and frequency range, even at very high frequencies, and their high dielectric strength of 650nbsp&V/µm, PP <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{can be used in}} metallized and in film/foil versions as capacitors for pulse applications, such as CRT-scan deflection circuits, or as so-called [...] "snubber" [...] capacitors, or in IGBT applications. In addition, polypropylene <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are used in AC power applications, such as motor run capacitors or PFC capacitors.|$|R
2500|$|Two main {{advantages}} of <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are very low ESR and ESL values. <b>Film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are physically {{larger and more}} expensive than aluminum electrolytic capacitors (e-caps), [...] but have much higher surge and pulse load capabilities. As <b>film</b> <b>capacitors</b> are not polarized, {{they can be used}} in AC voltage applications without DC bias, and they have much more stable electrical parameters.
