The approach uses ARMOS©, an areal two-dimensional multiphase flow, finite-element simulation model. Systematic simulations of free oil area changes to <b>pumping</b> <b>rates</b> are analyzed. <b>Pumping</b> <b>rates</b> are determined that achieve LNAPL plume containment at different times (i. e. 90, 180 and 360 days) for a planning period of 360 days.

Stepwise pumping is shown to improve oil recovery by increasing recoveredoil volume (11 %) and decreasing residual oil (15 %) when compared with traditional steady pumping strategies.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{develop a}} {{technique}} to estimate the corneal endothelial <b>pump</b> <b>rate</b> in human subjects. METHODS: Corneal hydration control {{is thought to be}} maintained by a pump-leak mechanism whereby the leak of solutes and fluid across the endothelial barrier into the stroma is, in the steady state, exactly balanced by the pumping of solutes and passive fluid transfer across the endothelium to the aqueous humor. Overall corneal hydration control can be measured from {{the rate at which the}} swollen cornea thins (deswells), and a measure of the leak can be obtained simultaneously from the endothelial permeability to fluorescein. From the pump-leak hypothesis, the deswelling rate is directly proportional to the <b>pump</b> <b>rate</b> and inversely proportional to the leak rate. The relative endothelial <b>pump</b> <b>rate</b> can be estimated as the product of the normalized deswelling rate and the normalized endothelial permeability. This procedure was used to obtain the relative endothelial <b>pump</b> <b>rate</b> in 41 patients with diabetes mellitus, 12 patients with long-term corneal transplants, 20 long-term wearers of contact lenses, and 19 normal volunteer subjects after the short-term administration of topical dorzolamide. RESULTS: The relative endothelial <b>pump</b> <b>rate</b> did not differ significantly from that of control subjects in diabetics, in contact lens wearers, and after dorzolamide administration, but was markedly decreased in the patients with corneal transplants, despite a reduction in permeability (reduced leak). CONCLUSIONS: This method allows the estimation of both the barrier and pump arms of corneal endothelial function and should be useful in the investigation of causes and mechanisms of functional endothelial insufficiency...|$|R

40|$|Groundwater {{users are}} often the last to be {{affected}} by drought. Also, groundwater users are the last to experience a return to normal water levels. Less than average precipitation will affect the sustainability of the aquifer use and the hydraulically connected surface water. We examine the effect of drought on perennial and deferred perennial yield strategies developed for long-term average conditions. An optimal perennial yield strategy gives areal distribution of groundwater <b>pumping</b> <b>rates</b> that will cause acceptable consequences to the aquifer and hydraulically connected surface water bodies. Such strategies have relatively constant annual <b>pumping</b> <b>rates</b> and check for annual average conditions. Deferred perennial yield strategies differ from perennial yield strategies in that <b>pumping</b> <b>rates</b> can initially be high while aquifer mining is allowed for hydrological or economic reasons. Afterwards, <b>pumping</b> <b>rates</b> are reduced allowing for aquifer recovery. Reconnaissance optimization problems or scenarios are constructed to help explore the options for mitigating drought (less than average) effect on groundwater. One scenario computes the maximum allowed junior water rights to be granted if less-than average precipitation exists. Another scenario will be invoked if junior rights can not be granted and unacceptable consequences are still noticed. This scenario computes an optimal unified reduction percentage in background pumping or shaving groundwater senior water rights. The third scenario will reduce senior water rights by an optimal proportion and prevent junior water rights from pumping more than their perennial yield <b>pumping</b> <b>rates.</b> Cache Valley aquifer system will be used as a representative aquifer to evaluate the results of the three scenarios.
