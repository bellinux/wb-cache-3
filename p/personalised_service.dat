The bank was nationalised in 1980, along with 5 other private sector banks. After nationalisation, the pace of growth of the bank accelerated and it made all-round progress. Started as a common man's bank, it changed with the times to meet the aspirations of the people but never swerved from its motto- Sarve Janah Sukhino Bhavantu meaning [...] "Prosperity for All". It endeavoured and succeeded in striking a balance between traditional values and an innovative approach, <b>personalised</b> <b>service</b> and professional outlook, and commercial considerations and public concern. The bank has been paying dividend continuously for the last 98 years, since its inception. Today, with modern, technology-driven products and services, and nationwide branches and ATMs (second-largest ATM network in the public sector), Corporation Bank is regarded as well-managed, with an excellent track record.|$|E

40|$|In many European countries, {{municipalities}} {{are becoming}} increasingly important as providers of electronic public services to their citizens. One of the horizons for further expansion is the delivery of <b>personalised</b> electronic <b>services.</b> In this paper, we describe the diffusion of <b>personalised</b> <b>services</b> in the Netherlands over the period 2006 - 2009 and investigate how and why various municipalities adopted <b>personalised</b> electronic <b>services.</b> In achieving this, we analyse data that were gathered during interviews with key stakeholders in ten selected Dutch municipalities. We synthesise the findings in an explanatory model of <b>personalised</b> electronic <b>service</b> delivery diffusion. The model emphasizes persuasive pressures that are channelled to potential adopters of <b>personalised</b> <b>services.</b> Furthermore, the model shows how persuasive pressure (as perceived by adopters) is followed-up by organisational search activities, and how, in various circumstances, the idea of <b>personalised</b> <b>services</b> is ‘framed’ by innovation champions, knowledge brokers and new members of staff as to appeal to specific organisational priorities and ambitions. In doing so, this article contributes to an institutional view on adoption and diffusion of innovations, in which (1) horizontal and vertical channels of persuasion and (2) human agency, rather than technological opportunity and rational cost-benefit considerations, account for actual diffusion of innovations...|$|R

Even before the news can sink in his system, he gets a call from an 'unknown number' with caller claiming that his name is 'Dawood'. Dawood then, [...] "orders" [...] Prithvi to get into a mutually profitable deal with him, as he has to deliver the money time to time at different places to dawood's lady hechmen Rasheeda (Talia Bentson).

40|$|Through a Privacy Calculus (i. e. risk–benefit trade-off) lens, {{this study}} {{identifies}} {{factors that contribute}} to consumers’ adoption of <b>personalised</b> nutrition <b>services.</b> We argue that consumers’ intention to adopt <b>personalised</b> nutrition <b>services</b> is determined by perceptions of Privacy Risk, Personalisation Benefit, Information Control, Information Intrusiveness, Service Effectiveness, and the Benevolence, Integrity, and Ability of a service provider. Data were collected in eight European countries using an online survey. Results confirmed a robust and Europe-wide applicable cognitive model, showing that consumers’ intention to adopt <b>personalised</b> nutrition <b>services</b> depends more on Perceived Personalisation Benefit than on Perceived Privacy Risk. Perceived Privacy Risk was mainly determined by perceptions of Information Control, whereas Perceived Personalisation Benefit primarily depended on Perceived Service Effectiveness. Services that required increasingly intimate personal information, and in particular DNA, raised consumers’ Privacy Risk perceptions, but failed to increase perceptions of Personalisation Benefit. Accordingly, to successfully exploit <b>personalised</b> nutrition, <b>service</b> providers should convey a clear message regarding the benefits and effectiveness of <b>personalised</b> nutrition <b>services.</b> Furthermore, service providers may reduce Privacy Risk by increasing consumer perceptions of Information Control.
