40|$|We {{present an}} Echelle+CCD, high S/N, high {{resolution}} (R = 20 000) spectroscopic atlas of 108 well-known objects {{representative of the}} most common types of <b>peculiar</b> and <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b> The wavelength interval extends from 4600 to 9400 Ang, and includes the RAVE, Gaia and HERMES wavelength ranges. Multi-epoch spectra are provided for the majority of observed stars. A total of 425 spectra of peculiar stars are presented, which have been collected during 56 observing nights between November 1998 and August 2002. The spectra are given in FITS format and heliocentric wavelengths, with accurate subtraction of both the sky background and the scattered light. Auxiliary material useful for custom applications (telluric dividers, spectro-photometric stars, flat-field tracings) is also provided. The atlas aims to provide a homogeneous database of the spectral appearance of stellar peculiarities, a tool useful both for classification purposes and inter-comparison studies. It could also serve the planning for and training of automated classification algorithms designed for RAVE, Gaia, HERMES and other large scale spectral surveys.

40|$|We present new optical (BVI) {{time-series data}} for the evolved <b>variable</b> <b>stars</b> in the Carina dwarf {{spheroidal}} galaxy. The quality of the data and the observing strategy allowed us to identify 14 new <b>variable</b> <b>stars.</b> Eight out of the 14 are RR Lyrae (RRL) stars, 4 are Anomalous Cepheids (ACs), and 2 are geometrical variables. Comparison of the period distribution {{for the entire sample}} of RRLs with similar distributions in nearby dwarf spheroidal galaxies and in the Large Magellanic Cloud indicates that the old stellar populations in these systems share similar properties. This finding is also supported by the RRL distribution in the Bailey diagram. On the other hand, the period distribution and the Bailey diagram of ACs display significant differences among the above stellar systems. This evidence suggests that the properties of intermediate-age stellar populations might be affected both by environmental effects and structural parameters. We use the BV Period-Wesenheit (PW) relation of RRLs together with evolutionary prescriptions and find a true distance modulus of 20. 09 ± 0. 07 (intrinsic) ± 0. 1 (statistical) mag that agrees quite well with similar estimates available in the literature. We identified four <b>peculiar</b> <b>variables.</b> Taking into account their position in the Bailey diagram and in the BV PW relation, two of them (V 14 and V 149) appear to be candidate ACs, while two (V 158 and V 182) might be peculiar RRLs. In particular, the variable V 158 has a period and a V-band amplitude very similar to the low-mass RRL—RRLR- 02792 —recently identified by Pietrzyński et al. in the Galactic bulge...|$|R
