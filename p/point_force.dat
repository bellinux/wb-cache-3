40|$|Abstract—The {{location}} of <b>point</b> excitation <b>force</b> {{is an important}} factor to influence sound radiation of underwater structure. A vibroacoustic model of a simply supported rectangular plate covered by decoupling coating is presented. The influences of the locations and the number of <b>point</b> excitation <b>force</b> to sound radiation power insertion loss are analyzed. The results show that: 1) The {{location of}} <b>point</b> excitation <b>force</b> has much influence to sound radiation power insertion loss; 2) The average sound radiation power insertion loss is closer to convergence as the number of <b>point</b> excitation <b>force</b> becomes larger; 3) When The location of <b>point</b> excitation <b>force</b> is closer to the corner of plate, sound radiation power insertion loss compares well with that of multi-point average. When plate model is used to measure the performance of noise reduction of decoupling coating, the location of <b>point</b> excitation <b>force</b> should be located of the position from a corner of the tested plate so that as many plate modes as possible are excited.

For surfaces with positive S ij the new approach avoids the introduction of a cutoff length. The classical and the new approaches are compared in case of 1 -D periodic ribbons...|$|R

5000|$|In physics, a {{field is}} a {{physical}} quantity, represented by a number or tensor, that has a value for each point in space and time. For example, on a weather map, the surface wind velocity is described by assigning a vector to each point on a map. Each vector represents the speed {{and direction of the}} movement of air at that point. As another example, an electric field {{can be thought of as}} a [...] "condition in space" [...] emanating from an electric charge and extending throughout the whole of space. When a test electric charge is placed in this electric field, the particle accelerates due to a force. Physicists have found the notion of a field to be of such practical utility for the analysis of forces that they have come to think of a force as due to a field. [...] The sloppy use of language to which physicists are prone may lead to confusion in the student as to whether field here means [...] "region" [...] or [...] "single <b>point</b> <b>force</b> vector" [...] within a given region or [...] "a set of <b>point</b> <b>force</b> vectors" [...] within a given region or [...] "all <b>point</b> <b>force</b> vectors" [...] within a given region (bear in mind the fact that Gravitational and Electromagnetic Forces have ranges that are theoretically infinite).|$|E
5000|$|A {{simple support}} (pin or roller) is {{equivalent}} to a <b>point</b> <b>force</b> on the beam which is adjusted {{in such a way}} as to fix the position of the beam at that point. A fixed support or clamp, {{is equivalent to}} the combination of a <b>point</b> <b>force</b> and a point torque which is adjusted {{in such a way as}} to fix both the position and slope of the beam at that point. Point forces and torques, whether from supports or directly applied, will divide a beam into a set of segments, between which the beam equation will yield a continuous solution, given four boundary conditions, two at each end of the segment. Assuming that the product EI is a constant, and defining [...] where F is the magnitude of a <b>point</b> <b>force,</b> and [...] where M is the magnitude of a point torque, the boundary conditions appropriate for some common cases is given in the table below. The change in a particular derivative of w across the boundary as x increases is denoted by [...] followed by that derivative. For example, [...] where [...] is the value of [...] at the lower boundary of the upper segment, while [...] is the value of [...] at the upper boundary of the lower segment.

5000|$|The {{equations}} {{of motion}} for Stokes flow, called the Stokes Equations, are a linearization of the Navier-Stokes Equations, and thus can be solved {{by a number of}} well-known methods for linear differential equations.

5000|$|If {{it is not}} {{acceptable}} (obviously e.g. {{in the case of}} gravitational force), such [...] "volume/surface" [...] force should be described as a system of forces (components), each acting on a single particle, and then the calculation should be done for each of them separately. Such a calculation is typically simplified by the use of differential elements of the body volume/surface, and the integral calculus. In a number of cases, though, it can be shown that such a system of forces may be replaced by a single <b>point</b> <b>force</b> without the actual calculation (as in the case of uniform gravitational force).|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the fundamental problem of the non-uniform subsonic motion of a <b>point</b> <b>force</b> and line forces in an unbounded, homogeneous, isotropic medium in analogy to the electromagnetic Liénard-Wiechert potentials. The exact closed-form solutions of the displacement and elastic fields produced by the <b>point</b> <b>force</b> and line forces are calculated. The displacement fields can be identified with the elastodynamic Liénard-Wiechert tensor potentials. For a non-uniformly moving <b>point</b> <b>force,</b> we decompose the elastic fields into a radiation part and a non-radiation part. We show that the solution of a non-uniformly moving <b>point</b> <b>force</b> is the generalization of the Stokes solution towards the non-uniform motion.
