5|$|Floods are {{the most}} common natural {{disaster}} in India. The heavy southwest monsoon rains cause the Brahmaputra and other rivers to distend their banks, often flooding surrounding areas. Though they provide rice paddy farmers with a largely dependable source of natural irrigation and fertilisation, the floods can kill thousands and displace millions. Excess, erratic, or untimely monsoon rainfall may also wash away or otherwise ruin crops. Almost all of India is flood-prone, and extreme precipitation events, such as flash floods and torrential rains, have become increasingly common in central India over the <b>past</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades,</b> coinciding with rising temperatures. Mean annual precipitation totals have remained steady due to the declining frequency of weather systems that generate moderate amounts of rain.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{styles of}} {{architecture}} in Madagascar have been impacted {{over the past}} two hundred years by the increasing influence of European styles. A shift toward brick construction in the Highlands began during the reign of Queen Ranavalona II (1868–1883) based on models introduced by missionaries of the London Missionary Society and contacts with other foreigners. Foreign influence further expanded following the collapse of the monarchy and French colonization of the island in 1896. Modernization over the <b>past</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades</b> has increasingly led to the abandonment of certain traditional norms related to the external orientation and internal layout of houses and the use of certain customary building materials, particularly in the Highlands. Among those with means, foreign construction materials and techniques – namely imported concrete, glass and wrought iron features – have gained in popularity, to the detriment of traditional practices.|$|E

Moreover, a probable course of action would be to deny terrorists the use of foreign territory from which to stage their attacks.

At one stage in the 1990s, over 300 million Muslims – at that time, between one-third and a quarter of the world's entire Islamic population – were simultaneously ruled by women when elected heads of state Tansu Çiller (the 22nd Prime Minister of Turkey), Khaleda Zia (the 9th Prime Minister of Bangladesh) and Benazir Bhutto (the 11th Prime Minister of Pakistan) led their respective countries.|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{developing}} countries, NGO activists, multinational corporations, and governments increasingly have clashed over intellectual property policies. Not all intellectual property is alike. A 2 K campaigners come from diverse backgrounds and emphasize different things. Some campaigners champion creative expression and equate creativity with freedom. Others {{focus more on}} human rights, health, nutrition, and economic development. Still others worry about {{the disappearance of the}} scientific commons and the stifling of innovation. All share a skeptical view of the contemporary intellectual property rights regime and agree that too many intellectual property rights are having a negative effect on many aspects of the human experience. This chapter focuses on A 2 K campaigns for books, drugs, and seeds. Access to educational materials (including software, books, digital media, scientific and other scholarly journals), life-saving medicines, and seeds for sustainable and nutritious agriculture is {{the sine qua non of}} economic development. First, access to these resources has the potential to spur lasting development and build capacity for innovation. Yet, the strong trend toward transforming these into private commodities for sale at premium prices by making them subject to higher levels of intellectual property protection has made them less available to those who need them most. Second, notable economic concentration that has increased over the <b>past</b> <b>several</b> <b>decade...</b>|$|R

25|$|The city’s and municipality’s {{recent history}} has {{centered}} on violence related to drugs and the environment.

The violence and threats of violence have left streets empty after 7 pm. Pickups and SUVs with darkened windows are a common sight. These vehicles are associated with the many shootings and even grenade attacks that have taken place in and around the city in recent years. The violence {{is not limited to the}} city of Petatlán; it also occurs in its small rural communities such as La Morena, El Camalote and Las Humedades. A number of these have been partly or fully abandoned as drug-related violence grows. The violence is among local drug lords over turf.|$|E
25|$|However, {{the larger}} {{societal}} context of Bedouin culture is changing, {{particularly in the}} Negev. For the <b>past</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades,</b> {{the policy of the}} Israeli government has been to move the Negev Bedouin from the desert to official settlements. This has had several significant effects on Negev Bedouin society. Significantly, the move from a nomadic lifestyle to a sedentary one has displaced the Bedouin women from their previously critical economic roles. Moreover, the shift to a sedentary lifestyle means that wage labor has largely replaced agriculture as the main economic structure for the Negev Bedouin. Traditionally, women in Negev Bedouin society were not allowed to work outside the home. This expectation is still in place today. As the Negev Bedouin have shifted away from agriculture, the productive responsibilities have shifted to the men. Meanwhile, the patriarchal system that developed around the traditional economic structure has been maintained. Ultimately, this has resulted in a loss of power within the household for Bedouin women. It is still considered culturally inappropriate for women to interact with strangers (especially strange men), and the men of the family still mediate their families' interactions with society as a whole. The loss of their economic capabilities has meant that Negev Bedouin women are increasingly excluded from decision-making within the household. As a result, the overwhelming majority of important household decisions are made by men.|$|E
25|$|While {{cognitive}} science endeavors to explain human thought and the conscious mind, {{the work of}} cognitive biology {{is focused on the}} most fundamental process of cognition for any organism. In the <b>past</b> <b>several</b> <b>decades,</b> biologists have investigated cognition in organisms large and small, both plant and animal. “Mounting evidence suggests that even bacteria grapple with problems long familiar to cognitive scientists, including: integrating information from multiple sensory channels to marshal an effective response to fluctuating conditions; making decisions under conditions of uncertainty; communicating with conspecifics and others (honestly and deceptively); and coordinating collective behaviour to increase the chances of survival.” Without thinking or perceiving as humans would have it, an act of basic cognition is arguably a simple step-by-step process through which an organism senses a stimulus, then finds an appropriate response in its repertoire and enacts the response. However, the biological details of such basic cognition have neither been delineated for a great many species nor sufficiently generalized to stimulate further investigation. This lack of detail is {{due to the lack of}} a science dedicated to the task of elucidating the cognitive ability common to all biological organisms. That is to say, a science of cognitive biology has yet to be established. A prolegomena for such science was presented in 2007 and several authors have published their thoughts on the subject since the late 1970s. Yet as the examples in the next section suggest, there is neither consensus on the theory nor widespread application in practice.|$|E
