40|$|Diploma work {{focuses on}} the meaning of cooperation, {{kindergarten}} and parents partnership as well as families by raising preschool children. In the theoretical part I introduced the cooperation of kindergarten and family because by the child's inclusion into kindergarten beside family education there also appears education in kindergarten. It helps parents to raise children because educators give them advice, help them and direct them how to solve educational and other problems. That is the reason why it is important for educators and parents to cooperate because this cooperation is important and precious for the both sides. M. Bošnjak (2012) emphasizes, that the good cooperation with parents bases on mutual respect and trust, {{this is the only way}} for educational efforts to be proportional and helpful for more successful education of children. With this research I wanted to analyse the views of <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> and parents on cooperation between kindergarten and parents. I was interested in what <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> and parents think about different methods and forms of mutual cooperation, what form of cooperation they use the most often and how they estimate mutual cooperation. With my research I also wanted to analyse the views of <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> and parents {{on the meaning of}} education in kindergarten for a child. The results have shown, that <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> in kindergarten in Lenart as well as parents agree that cooperation and involving parents in the programme of kindergarten work is very important and useful for children. <b>Professional</b> <b>workers</b> in kindergarten in Lenart and parents also agree, that for development of children is important to be included in kindergarten. About different forms of mutual cooperation <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> in kindergarten in Lenart think, that the first parents meeting is important, because it bays the foundations of mutual cooperation during the school year, but parents agree, that common meetings of parents, children and <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> are important and needed. <b>Professional</b> <b>workers</b> in kindergarten in Lenart and parents do not agree, that parents meetings are poorly attended and they also do not agree, that talk time is the most successful form of cooperation. <b>Professional</b> <b>workers</b> in kindergarten in Lenart and parents agree, that education in kindergarten supplements family education and also that good cooperation bases on mutual trust and respect. ...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of the {{professional}} literature, we discovered that teachers, special and rehabilitation teachers, and also the other <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> within the teamwork recognize various advantages of the teamwork. Most of the <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> recognize the advantages of teamwork for students with special needs, <b>professional</b> <b>workers,</b> and educational institution. However, everybody does not realize its importance. By realizing the importance of the recognized advantages of the teamwork, they positively influence the efficiency of educational work and motivation for further teamwork. All the <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> should be made aware that teamwork regarding the students with special needs is an efficient approach with numerous positive influences for the students with special needs, for the <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> and educational institution. In the research part of the master’s thesis we studied: which advantages of the teamwork in the elementary school are recognized by the teachers and which by the special and rehabilitation teachers in working with students with special needs, {{what is the relationship between}} self-awareness of the efficiency of the team and recognizing the advantages of the teamwork in working with the students with special needs, what is the relationship between self-awareness of the efficiency of the team and the number of years of service in the field of education within the work with students with special needs, what is the relationship between the type of education and evaluation of the efficiency of the teamwork in working with the students with special needs, what is the relationship between the number of years of service and the experiences with teamwork in working with the students with special needs, what is the relationship between the number of years of service in the field of education and recognizing the advantages of the teamwork in working with the students with special needs, and what is the relationship between the frequency of performing various stages of teamwork and self-awareness of the efficiency of the team in working with students with special needs. In the pattern, we included 150 surveyed <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> (teachers, and special and rehabilitation teachers). In the research, we used our own survey questionnaire with three content sections. By means of the research, we ascertained that in recognizing the advantages of the teamwork in working with students with special needs there are no statistically significant differences between the teachers, and special and rehabilitation teachers, and that only a few <b>professional</b> <b>workers,</b> who evaluate the work of their team as successful, recognize several advantages in working with students with special needs, in comparison to those <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> who evaluate the work of their teams as inefficient (depending on the advantages). It is an interesting fact that <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> with more years of service do not evaluate the work of their team as more efficient, in comparison to <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> with fewer years of service. Additionally, we ascertained that in self-awareness of the efficiency of the team in working with students with special needs, there are no statistically significant differences between the teachers, and the special and rehabilitation teachers, and that <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> with more years of service have more experiences with the teamwork in working with students with special needs, in comparison to the ones with fewer years of service. The <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> with more years of service recognize no more advantages of the teamwork in working with students with special needs, as the ones with fewer years of service, which shows that all the <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> – regardless of the years of service – realize the importance of the teamwork. However, the <b>professional</b> <b>workers,</b> who carry out the stages of the teamwork (team planning, team implementation, team evaluation) in working with the students with special needs more often, evaluate the work of their team as more efficient in comparison to those <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> who carry out the stages of the teamwork less often – this was expected, of course. ...|$|R

40|$|In this master thesis I try to {{discover}} the perspective of parents, <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> {{in health care and}} kindergarten on the process of early intervention of children with special needs (continuing as children with SN). In the theoretical part I present early intervention as a period without which we cannot imagine the intervention of children with SN, and it includes medical, therapeutic, psychological, social and special-pedagogical help for high-risk children and their families. The success of early intervention depends a lot on the cooperation between parents and professionals of different disciplines who have various starting points for work with children with SN, which causes differences when including children in the process of early intervention. Early intervention is not defined in Slovenia at the moment. For the purpose of this research I distributed 33 questionnaires to parents with children with SN, 30 to <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> in health care, and 35 to <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> in kindergartens. The results of the research have shown that there are no statistically important differences in the field of opinion, experience, imputing meaning to principles of early intervention, forms of cooperation and perceiving obstacles when cooperating with groups integrated from the side. Parents with children with SN have higher, more specific and emotionally-coloured anticipations of the process of early intervention than <b>professional</b> <b>workers.</b> The differences in views of parents, whose children attend the first age group, and parents, whose children attend the second age group in kindergarten, can be noticed in the claims for complimentary help for the family, cooperation of parents in the process of early intervention, their emotional response {{at the start of the}} process, cooperation between parents and <b>professional</b> <b>workers,</b> and perceiving cooperation between <b>professional</b> <b>workers.</b> For better cooperation, I designed guidelines for parents and <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> based on my gathered information...|$|R
40|$|In the {{published}} expert literature, we often read that teachers and assistant teachers feel increasingly stressed, for they encounter situations during their work, {{which they are}} not sufficiently trained for. Among the <b>professional</b> <b>workers,</b> such situations cause stress and a feeling {{that they are not}} fit for the tasks. In practice, we realize increasingly larger needs for education and training of the <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> for working with children with special needs, and for some directives for easier incorporation of those children into the life and work of the kindergarten unit. Special and rehabilitation teachers, as the experts for working with children with special needs, can offer various forms of help and support, by means of which they would acquire some new knowledge, upgrade them and develop their competencies, necessary for the work with the children with special needs. The professional team of a kindergarten, guided by a special and rehabilitation teacher, is one of the effective forms of help and support to the <b>professional</b> <b>workers.</b> Through such team, the <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> gain high levels of expertise from the field of working with children with special needs, which derive from special skills of the special and rehabilitation teacher, experiences of the <b>professional</b> <b>workers,</b> and various <b>professional</b> literature. The competencies are upgraded in such a way. Consequently, the <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> cope with situations, which they encounter more easily while working with the children with special needs. In the research part, we formed and used a survey questionnaire, which was appropriately filled in by 110 <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> – teachers of the preschool children and assistant teachers from kindergartens from all over Slovenia. The purpose of the research was to ascertain how <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> percept their competencies and educational needs in the field of working with children with special needs, and which forms of help and support they need by special and rehabilitation teachers. By means of a questionnaire, we were also discovering, whether the <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> in the kindergarten express a need for forming a professional team, led by the special and rehabilitation teacher, with the purpose of offering some help, support and additional professional knowledge and competencies for working with children with special needs. By means of the acquired data, we gained an insight into what kind of forms of help and support in working with children with special needs are expected by the <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> in kindergartens in order for their professional work with children with special needs would be more successful and more qualitative. The results of the research have shown that <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> are offered help and support by the special and rehabilitation teacher, but they would wish more of that. Most support and help would be needed in the fields of discovering the children with special needs, communication and cooperation with parents, and cooperation in the professional team/group, for in these fields they perceive a lack of factual competencies for working with children with special needs. At the same time, we have discovered that the <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> wish that a special team/group would be formed within the kindergarten, led by a special and rehabilitation teacher. ...|$|R

40|$|Preschool {{represents}} a child’s first contact with any social institutions, therefore an appropriate {{approach of the}} <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> to the {{children and their parents}} should not be neglected. Subjective theories of the <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> have an important role since they influence their behaviour more than the knowledge acquired through their educational process. Subjective theories include explicitly stated standpoints, values, understanding of child development and education as well as implicit assumptions that can be seen from their practice, and are often in contradiction with explicitly stated standpoints and beliefs (Batistič Zorec, 2004). Subjective theories of <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> in preschool have not been thoroughly researched yet. In most case the researchers use questionnaires to examine their standpoints. We have not find any researche that would use interviews and the observation of practice. However, a research of Rutar Leban (2010) should be highlighted as it shows that the preschool <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> relatively scarcely understand the development of children in early years. Furthermore, the Slovene evaluation study (Marjanovič Umek, Fekonja and Bajc, 2005) has shown that the <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> who work with toddlers do not sufficiently encourage their language, though they find the encouragement of language development very important. The purpose of the thesis is to determine the standpoints of <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> in toddlers’ classes, namely their knowledge of children’s development, the importance of quality routine activities, how do they plan and reflect educational work and how do they care for their professional development. Another research point was whether the standpoints of the <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> match with their actual practice. Qualitative methodology of research has been used, where the analysis of interviews, observations and documentations of six preschool <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> from three classes have been done. The results show that they have the greatest lack of knowledge {{in the area of the}} children’s attachment to parents and educators, whereas their knowledge of toddlers’ socio-emotional development and play are slightly better. Yet, the understanding of language development of the toddlers and the ways of encouraging it is, in our opinion, good enough from the professional point of wiev. The observations of daily routine in the same classes has shown that most of the activities of the <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> are in accordance with their standpoints. Less suitable practice was seen only in two classes while observing the toilette and hygiene activities, which were too collective. In sum, on our opinion the <b>professional</b> <b>workers</b> should pay more attention to planning and evaluation of daily routine, which especially in toddlers’ classes offers numerous possibilities for individual and group encouragement of child’s development in all areas. We suggest that preschools promote quality of work in toddlers’ classes by encouraging teamwork, cooperation, additional teacher’s education and training. ...|$|R
