50|$|The <b>plain</b> <b>swift</b> (Apus unicolor) is a {{medium-sized}} swift. Although this bird is superficially {{similar to a}} barn swallow or house martin, it {{is not related to}} those passerine species. The resemblances between the groups are due to convergent evolution reflecting similar life styles.|$|E
50|$|Distinguishing the <b>plain</b> <b>swift</b> {{from the}} {{similarly}} plumaged common swift {{is much more}} difficult, although juvenile common can be easily eliminated due to its white throat. The plain is slimmer and appears longer winged than the common, and has scaly underparts, difficult to see except with excellent views. The call is a loud dry scream {{similar to that of}} the common swift, though possibly higher pitched.|$|E
40|$|The {{biometrics}} and moult of swifts {{are poorly}} known, yet represent {{important aspects of}} their breeding biology. In this study we investigated moult and used molecular sexing to characterise sexual size dimorphisms in the <b>Plain</b> <b>Swift</b> Apus unicolor. In contrast to previous work based on skin specimens, males were significantly larger than females with respect to wing length (2. 0 mm difference) and tail length. The sexes {{did not differ in}} body mass. We derived a discriminant function by binary logistic regression to separate the sexes using wing, bill and tail length; the function was accurate in assigning 70 % of the birds to their correct sex. Moult data obtained from 30 birds suggested that almost 25 % of individuals overlapped breeding with the start of moult (estimate: 16 August Â± 20 days) and that the progress of primary-feather moult was slow and initiated from at least two moult centres. Further studies are needed to investigate moult in relation to migratory strategy in this swift species...|$|E

50|$|<b>Plain</b> <b>swifts</b> {{breed in}} colonies on cliffs, bridges and {{buildings}} on the Canary Islands and Madeira, laying two eggs in a saucer-shaped nest made of floerheads glued with saliva. They are partially migratory, with some birds leaving to winter in northwest Africa.|$|R
60|$|It {{was a long}} ride, and as he {{rode the}} dawn came over the <b>plains,</b> <b>swift,</b> silent, majestic with color. His blood warmed in his limbs and his head lifted. He was {{at home in the}} wild once more, all ties were cut between him and the East. Mary was not for him. Maud had grown indifferent, Jack would never come West, and Mr. and Mrs. Burns were merely cheery memories. There was nothing now to look {{backward}} upon--nothing to check his career as hunter and explorer. All that he had done up to this moment was but careful preparation for great journeys. He resolved to fling himself into unknown trails--to know the mountains as no other man knew them.|$|R
50|$|The Weeden Island culture 400-1000. The Weeden Island {{culture is}} {{believed}} to have emerged from the Hopewell culture-based Swift Creek cultural tradition of northwest Florida during the Middle Woodland Period (c. 200 - 500) in the lower Chattahoochee-Apalachicola river drainage, persisting in some areas {{until the end of the}} Woodland period c. 1200 CE. Weeden Island sites have been found from Mobile Bay to south of Tampa Bay, extending as far north as lower-central Georgia.Concentrated around lakes Lake Miccosukee and Lake Iamonia.

6000|$|Sir Henry Craik is {{satisfied}} with the evidence for the marriage. Mr. Leslie Stephen is of opinion that it is inconclusive, and Forster could find no evidence that is at all reasonably sufficient; while Mr. Stanley Lane-Poole, Mr. Churton Collins, and others are strongly of opinion that no such marriage ever took place. A full discussion of the evidence would involve the consideration of {{the reliability of the}} witnesses, and the probability of their having authentic information, and would be out of place here. My own opinion is that the evidence for the marriage is very far from convincing, and this view seems to be confirmed by all that we know from his own letters of Swift's relations with Stella. It has been suggested that she was pained by reports of Swift's intercourse with Vanessa, and felt that his feelings towards herself were growing colder; but this is surmise, and no satisfactory explanation has been given to account for a form of marriage being gone through after so many years of the closest friendship. There is no reason to suppose that there was at the time any gossip in circulation about Stella, and if her reputation was in question, a marriage of which the secret was carefully kept would obviously be of no benefit to her. Moreover, we are told that there was no change in their mode of life; if they were married, what reason could there be for keeping it a secret, or for denying themselves the closer relationship of marriage? The only possible benefit to Stella was that Swift would be prevented marrying anyone else. It is impossible, of course, to disprove a marriage which we are told was secretly performed, without banns or licence or witnesses; but we may reasonably require strong evidence for so startling a step. If we reject the tale, the story of Swift's connection with Stella is at least intelligible; while the acceptance of this marriage introduces many puzzling circumstances, and makes it necessary to believe that during the remainder of Stella's life Swift repeatedly spoke of his wife as a friend, and of himself as one who had never married.(7) What right have we to put aside <b>Swift's</b> <b>plain</b> and repeated statements? Moreover, his attitude towards Vanessa for the remaining years of her life becomes much more culpable if we are to believe that he had given Stella the claim of a wife upon him.(8) ...|$|R
