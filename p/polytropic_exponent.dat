The effect of compressibility on attitude angle was significant, even when the bearing number was low. A small amount of fluid compressibility was enough to obtain stable running conditions.

Using this method, the cost of solving the nonlinear least-squares problem is only slightly higher than solving the linear least-squares problem. Both methods show good statistical behavior.

40|$|The {{focus of}} this study was to apply and {{evaluate}} two separate techniques for estimating of the completeness of combustion in a multi-cylinder engine fueled with compressed natural gas. The degree of correlation between such two independent estimates of the combustion completeness was sought. One technique, with better time resolution and viewed to be more accurate, calculates the completeness of combustion on a cycle-by-cycle basis using in-cylinder pressure measurements. The technique utilizes the normalized pressure rise parameter due to combustion to describe the completeness of combustion. The second technique evaluates the completeness of combustion based on time-averaged measurements of unburned hydrocarbons in engine exhaust gases. Both the in-cylinder pressure and exhaust gas composition data were obtained from a test multi-cylinder engine fuelled with compressed natural gas (CNG). The crank angle resolved pressure data were analyzed with combustion analysis software. The establishment of the correlation between the two estimates of the completeness of combustion could allow dispensing with elaborate in-cylinder pressure measurements. The successful aspect of this investigation was to propose and test a new parameter that is strongly related to completeness of combustion. The advantage of the new parameter is that its calculation does not require computations of the pressure rise due to combustion and avoids difficulties associated with that procedure in finding such parameters as the <b>polytropic</b> <b>exponents,</b> the start and end of combustion, etc. Dept. of Mechanical, Automotive, and Materials Engineering.

40|$|The {{interstellar}} medium of galaxies {{is governed by}} supersonic turbulence, which likely controls the star formation rate (SFR) and the initial mass function (IMF). Interstellar turbulence is non-universal, {{with a wide range}} of Mach numbers, magnetic fields strengths, and driving mechanisms. Although some of these parameters were explored, most previous works assumed that the gas is isothermal. However, we know that cold molecular clouds form out of the warm atomic medium, with the gas passing through chemical and thermodynamic phases that are not isothermal. Here we determine the role of temperature variations by modelling non-isothermal turbulence with a polytropic equation of state (EOS), where pressure and temperature are functions of gas density, P~rho^Gamma, T~rho^(Gamma- 1). We use grid resolutions of 2048 ^ 3 cells and compare <b>polytropic</b> <b>exponents</b> Gamma= 0. 7 (soft EOS), Gamma= 1 (isothermal EOS), and Gamma= 5 / 3 (stiff EOS). We find a complex network of non-isothermal filaments with more small-scale fragmentation occurring for Gamma 1 smoothes out density contrasts. The density probability distribution function (PDF) is significantly affected by temperature variations, with a power-law tail developing at low densities for Gamma> 1. In contrast, the PDF becomes closer to a lognormal distribution for Gamma<= 1. We derive and test a new density variance - Mach number relation that takes Gamma into account. This new relation is relevant for theoretical models of the SFR and IMF, because it determines the dense gas mass fraction of a cloud, from which stars form. We derive the SFR as a function of Gamma and find that it decreases by a factor of ~ 5 from Gamma= 0. 7 to Gamma= 5 / 3.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 The {{expansion}} {{of a gas}} within a piston-cylinder arrangement is studied {{in order to obtain}} {{a better understanding of the}} heat transfer which occurs during this process. While the situation of heat transfer during the {{expansion of}} a gas has received considerable attention, the process is still not very well understood. In particular, the time dependence of heat transfer has not been well studied, with many researchers instead focused on average heat transfer rates. Additionally, many of the proposed models are not in agreement with each other and are usually dependent on experimentally determined coefficients which have been found to vary widely between test geometries and operating conditions. Therefore, the expansion process is analyzed in order to determine a model for the time dependence of heat transfer during the expansion. A model is developed for the transient heat transfer by assuming that the expansion behaves in a polytropic manner. This leads to a heat transfer model written in terms of an unknown <b>polytropic</b> <b>exponent,</b> n. By examining the physical significance of this parameter, it is proposed that the <b>polytropic</b> <b>exponent</b> can be related to a ratio of the time scales associated with the expansion process, such as a characteristic Peclet number. Experiments are conducted to test the proposed heat transfer model and to establish a relationship for the <b>polytropic</b> <b>exponent.</b> The tests are performed using an apparatus that consists of a single piston-cylinder, which allows for pressure-volume data to be collected during the expansion of a hot gas. These experiments justify the polytropic expansion assumption, and from these results models are developed for the <b>polytropic</b> <b>exponent.</b> Heat transfer data are also collected from these experiments through applying an energy balance on the gas during expansion. These heat transfer data are used to compare the Nusselt number predicted by the proposed model with the experimentally determined Nusselt number. It is found that the proposed model agrees very well with the experimental data, and accurately captures the time dependence of the heat transfer characteristics. The proposed model also accurately handles variations in the heat transfer characteristics due to the different test conditions studied. By capturing the transient effects of heat transfer during the expansion process, the proposed model should be a more accurate tool in determining heat loss during the expansion of a gas than previously developed models...|$|E
40|$|The {{subject of}} the {{analysis}} presented in {{the paper is the}} idea and implementation method of the ignition point of homogeneous air-fuel mixture, used in the IC engine with HCCI system. Autoignition of the combustible mixture can occur only upon reaching the characteristic self-ignition temperature Tz. It should take place during (near end) the load compression. In order to achieve the fuel mixture ignition temperature Tz in the system, usually it is proposed adjusting the engine compression ratio,H. However, it is quite cumbersome especially in case of frequent changes of engine load (there are also difficulties with the precise advance angle adjusting of fuel mixture ignition). According to our conception, the other method of autoignition adjustment can be successfully applied. The essence of the new idea consists in proper selection, according to engine load, of the exponent N of charge polytropic compression. Introducing the defined dose of monoatomic gas (e. g. argon Ar, N | 1. 667) to air-fuel mixture, the higher values of the <b>polytropic</b> compression <b>exponent</b> N of working medium can be achieved. It will result in significant increase of the temperature rise ǻTmax of the compressed charge and accordingly progressive increase of the advance angle of the mixture ignition...|$|R
40|$|For {{dry running}} {{displacement}} vacuum pumps {{the abolition of}} cooling, sealing and lubricating fluids causes the problem of an increased thermal load. The thermodynamics of this process differ fundamentally from the thermodynamics of an air compressor. The former are characterised by a - usually - unadjusted pressure ratio, the oscillation of the working fluid and the periodic mixing process of the working gas (that has already been expelled) and the gas in the working chamber. This process results in adiabatic outlet temperatures that are distinctly higher than the outlet temperatures of an adjusted isentropic process. Lower suction pressure results in a discrepancy between the adiabatic model and reality, which {{is the reason why}} a calculation of the diabatic process is necessary. In support of a isothermal model the dependence of the working behaviour on both the speed and the gap height of the screw vacuum pump can be demonstrated, but it does not allow conclusions to be drawn about the thermal load of the gas and the pump. This work describes additional modules of the simulation program Kasim that has been developed as a solution to this problem. The lack of Nußelt equations for rotating systems in vacuum results in the application of heat transfer models of the overpressure range in order to calculate the heat transfer of those systems. Pressure-dependent substance properties have been based on gas cinematic models. Apart from these further models were investigated {{in order to determine the}} flow velocity and state variables of the working gas at the heat transferring areas. Initially, the simulation program was applied to a cold model machine which consisted of a srew vacuum pump with constant pitch. Compared with the steady state machine, the cold machine had the advantage of known boundary conditions. The large differences between simulation and experiment cannot be explained either by the sensitivity of the heat transfer models or the property models, or by the <b>polytropic</b> <b>exponents</b> of the expansion flow in the gap. Measurement technique appears to be the most likely explanation. That is the reason why a further investigation was carried out on the steady state machine. This included also body temperatures and an energy balance. In order to find out about body temperatures, a module was developed which allowed the surface elements of the finite element mesh of the pump to be allocated to the capacities and connections of the thermodynamic simulation system. After the boundary conditions had been defined, this assignment formed the basis for the calculation of the heat fluxes, based on a homogenous, isothermal machine whose temperature was to be re-determined by the thermal FE-calculations of its parts. This allowed a calculation of the steady state heat balance to be carried out iteratively. The verification was successful. The calculated heat flows of the machine parts were acceptably close to the experimental energy balance. Moreover, both the body temperatures and the maximum gas temperatures during the working process displayed a high degree of concordance. The present study proves that both the adaptation of heat transfer models of the overpressure range in the rotating system of a vacuum pump and the implementation of gas cinematic property models results in a good representation of the working behaviour. At the same time, it offers the possibility of further improvements. Moreover, it opens up the perspective of a completely closed simulation of rotating displacement vacuum pumps...|$|R

40|$|Identifying the {{processes}} that determine the initial mass function of stars (IMF) is a fundamental problem in star formation theory. One of the major uncertainties is the exact chemical state of the star forming gas and its influence on the dynamical evolution. Most simulations of star forming clusters use an isothermal equation of state (EOS). However, theoretical predictions and observations suggest that the effective <b>polytropic</b> <b>exponent</b> gamma in the EOS varies with density. We address these issues and study {{the effect of a}} piecewise polytropic EOS on the formation of stellar clusters in turbulent, self-gravitating molecular clouds using three-dimensional, smoothed particle hydrodynamics simulations. To approximate the results of published predictions of the thermal behavior of collapsing clouds, we increase the <b>polytropic</b> <b>exponent</b> gamma from 0. 7 to 1. 1 at some chosen density n_c, which we vary. The change of thermodynamic state at n_c selects a characteristic mass scale for fragmentation M_ch, which we relate to the peak of the observed IMF. Our investigation generally supports the idea that the distribution of stellar masses depends mainly on the thermodynamic state of the star-forming gas. The thermodynamic state of interstellar gas {{is a result of the}} balance between heating and cooling processes, which in turn are determined by fundamental atomic and molecular physics and by chemical abundances. Given the abundances, the derivation of a characteristic stellar mass can thus be based on universal quantities and constants. Comment: 13 pages, 7 figures, accepted by A&...|$|E

It is assumed that the cooling mechanisms in the disks are bremsstrahlung and Compton scattering. This extends the previous work of Takahara et al. (1989) which did not analyze winds within a self-consistent disk model. It is shown that the disks have winds for accretion rates higher than about 10 percent of the Eddington rate, depending on the viscosity parameter of the disks and the <b>polytropic</b> <b>exponent</b> of wind gases. The poloidal velocity of winds at the foot-point is shown to {{be as high as}} 10 percent of light speed...|$|E
40|$|We study {{electrically}} charged compact {{stars in}} the framework of extended theory of gravity (ETG). We assume that the charge density is proportional to the energy density. The polytropic equation of state is chosen to describe the state of the charged perfect fluid. We aim to find the Oppenheimer Volkoff (OV) mass limit for charged compact stars. A detailed numerical study is performed. We show the dependence of the mass-radius diagram of the spheres on the values of the perturbatif parameter β, the <b>polytropic</b> <b>exponent</b> γ and the charge fraction α. Our results are compared with those found in the literature in the case of applying General Relativity (GR). Comment: 12 pages, 7 figure...|$|E
40|$|A few CVs with orbital {{periods in}} the range 3. 5 - 7 h seem to possess mass ratios q=M_ 2 /M_ 1 {{that would make them}} {{thermally}} stable but dynamically unstable. We analyze how the magnetic fields produced in the secondaries can alter the theoretical mass ratio limits for their dynamical stability. Since magnetic fields change the specific heats and the <b>polytropic</b> <b>exponent</b> γ of the gas in the convective envelope, the mass-radius adiabatic exponent ξ_ad will also change. We find that turbulent magnetic fields can produce less restrictive critical q-profiles while strong large-scale fields might account for the stability of many of, if not all, the anomalous CVs identified. Some consequences of the presence of magnetic cycles of activity are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{compression}} {{process in}} a piston cylinder device in a Compressed Air Energy Storage (CAES) system is studied computationally. Twelve different cases featuring four different compression space length-to-radius aspect ratios and three different Reynolds numbers are studied computationally using the commercial CFD code ANSYS FLUENT. The solutions show that for compression with a constant velocity, the compression can be approximated by a polytropic pressure vs. volume relation. The <b>polytropic</b> <b>exponent,</b> �, characterizes the heat transfer and temperature rise of the air being compressed. For the cases computed, it varies from 1. 124 to 1. 305 and {{is found to be}} more affected by Reynolds number and less by the length-to-radius ratio. Since the efficiency and storage power of the compressor depend on pressure vs. volume trajectory durin...|$|E
40|$|A {{theoretical}} {{examination of}} the jump conditions of the bow shock is used to investigate {{the influence of the}} solar wind magnetic fields on the structure of the parameters behind the bow shock. Through the assumption that the average values of the parameters along the radial direction in the magnetosheath are equal to their values just behind the bow shock, the influence of the direction of the solar wind magnetic fields on the average structure of the magnetosheath is determined. From this assumption, a zero-order formula for the thickness of the magnetosheath is deduced which satisfies the boundary conditions and conservation laws of mass and momentum flux. The theoretical estimate of the thickness is compared with satellite observations to check the assumption and select the optimum value of the <b>polytropic</b> <b>exponent</b> of the plasma gas...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{investigate}} {{the properties of}} highly compressible turbulence {{and its ability to}} produce self-gravitating structures. The compressibility is parameterized by an effective <b>polytropic</b> <b>exponent</b> γe. In the limit of small γe, the density jump at shocks is shown to be of the order of eM 2, and the production of vorticity by the nonlinear terms appears to be negligible. In the presence of self-gravity, we suggest that turbulence can produce bound structures for γe < 2 (1 − 1 /n), where n is the typical dimensionality of the turbulent compressions. We show, by means of numerical simulations, that, for sufficiently small γe, small-scale turbulent density fluctuations eventually collapse even though the medium is globally stable. This result is preserved {{in the presence of a}} magnetic field for supercritical mass-to-flux ratios...|$|E
