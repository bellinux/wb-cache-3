The increasing generation of construction waste such as used timber formwork, obsolete concrete and packaging, has caused significant pollution to the environment and risen public concern particularly in densely populated cities, such as Hong Kong. The minimization of construction waste has therefore become a pressing issue in pursuing the practice of sustainable construction. This paper shows the betterment of replacing in situ concreting with <b>precast</b> <b>slabs</b> for temporary works to improve sustainable construction performance. Construction waste from the obsolete concrete constitutes {{a large part of the}} construction solid waste in a typical building project.

This study identifies cost saving and the betterment of environmental performance by using <b>precast</b> concrete <b>slabs</b> over the in situ concreting.

Then, FEM results for zero foundation stiffness were verified with those of experiments, which were in good agreement.

Thermal cracks are not decisive for the load-bearing capacity but cause costs for repair and {{may reduce the}} life of the structure. The risk of cracking can be judged through safety values, (partial coefficients) given in building codes. In the thesis, partial coefficients for thermal cracking problems are determined with a probabilistic model. One crucial parameter influencing the risk of cracking is the restraint. In the report, methods are derived and presented for the determination of the restraint. Rotational boundary restraint from elastic foundations is treated as well as the restraint in internal points in the structures. For the determination of the rotational boundary restraint coefficient, applicable and simple graphical tools are presented. The restraint in internal points is based on a so-called plane-section restraint coefficient, a resilience factor for structures with length to height ratios smaller than seven, and a factor for slip failures in joints between the young and old parts. Four experiments of walls cast on slabs are presented in the thesis. On a <b>precast</b> <b>slab,</b> concrete walls are cast and loaded by restraint stresses induced by the temperature during the hydration.
