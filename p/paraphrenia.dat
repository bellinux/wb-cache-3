25|$|<b>Paraphrenia</b> is {{different}} from schizophrenia because, while both disorders result in delusions and hallucinations, individuals with schizophrenia exhibit changes and deterioration of personality whereas individuals with <b>paraphrenia</b> maintain a well-preserved personality and affective response.|$|E
25|$|Studies {{suggest that}} the {{prevalence}} of <b>paraphrenia</b> in the elderly population is around 2-4%.|$|E
25|$|The {{development}} of paranoia and hallucinations {{in old age}} have been related to both auditory and visual impairment, and individuals with <b>paraphrenia</b> often present with {{one or both of}} these impairments. Hearing loss in paraphrenics is associated with early age of onset, long duration, and profound auditory loss.|$|E
25|$|Delusions {{typically}} {{occur in}} the context of neurological or psychiatric disease, although they are not tied to any particular disorder and have been found to {{occur in the}} context of many pathological states (both physical and mental). However, they are of particular diagnostic importance in psychotic disorders including schizophrenia, <b>paraphrenia,</b> manic episodes of bipolar disorder, and psychotic depression.|$|E
25|$|His wife {{contracted}} tuberculosis {{while in}} Australia, leaving her bedridden for years {{until her death}} in September 9, 1931. Devastated, Girault's behaviour increasingly became erratic and paranoid. One afternoon, around 1936, Girault started shouting at their neighbours for hours for no apparent reason. This continued on into the night until someone finally called the police who took him away. Two days later, his sons, Ernest and Frank, drove him to an insane asylum in Goodna, Queensland. He was admitted several more times into the asylum. He was on leave from Goodna, Queensland {{in the care of}} his son until 9 May 1940 when he was admitted to Dunwich Benevolent Asylum on Stradbroke Island on 16 July 1940 where he died in May 2, 1941 at the age of 57. His cause of death was officially listed as <b>paraphrenia</b> and exhaustion. He was buried at Dunwich and now lies in an unmarked grave.|$|E
25|$|In {{his book}} Soul snatchers: the {{mechanics}} of cults, Jean-Marie Abgrall describes how Altered States Of Consciousness (ASCs) are used in many cults to make the initiate more susceptible to the group will and world view. He cites research by Barmark and Gautnitz which showed {{the similarities between the}} states obtained by Transcendental Meditation and ASCs. In this way, not only does the subject become more reliant on the ASC, but it allows for a weakening of criticism of the cult and increase in faith therein. Abgrall goes on to note that the use of mantras {{is one of the most}} widespread techniques in cults, noting in TM this mantra is produced mentally. He says that a guru is usually central to a cult and that its success will rely on how effective that guru is. Among the common characteristics of a guru he notes <b>paraphrenia,</b> a mental illness that completely cuts the individual from reality. In regard to this he notes for example, that the Maharishi recommended the TM-Sidhi program including 'yogic flying' as a way to reduce crime.|$|E
500|$|The {{religion}} {{received little}} {{opposition from the}} Catholic Church, which has sometimes criticized it but only on doctrinal issues, considering it heretic. For example, in 1918, priest of Liège Hubert Bourguet published a 50-page brochure in which he expressed concerns on the doctrines, qualified the sacred texts of Antoinism as [...] "gibberish" [...] and concluded that Antoine would have suffered from <b>paraphrenia.</b> In 1925, Father Lucien Roure considered Antoinism [...] "a doctrine of anarchy and amorality", with [...] "negative teachings", confused and incoherent writings, and [...] "credulous and docile" [...] followers. In 1949, author Jacques Michel blamed Antoine for having substituted himself for Jesus Christ and deemed Antoinism a [...] "demonic" [...] faith. Later, in 1953, Maurice Colinon, then in 1954, the Father Henri-Charles Chéry, published books which analyzed non-conformist groups, including Antoinism. According to Debouxhtay, Protestants {{were concerned about the}} Antoinist expansion in the 1930s, and several pastors published writings on this subject (Giron-Galzin, 1910; Rumpf, 1917; Wyss, c.1924). More recently, the religion was studied from a Protestant perspective by pastor Gérard Dagon.|$|E
2500|$|While <b>paraphrenia</b> {{can occur}} in both men and women, it {{is more common in}} women, even after the {{difference}} has been adjusted for life expectancies. [...] The ratio of women with <b>paraphrenia</b> to men with <b>paraphrenia</b> is anywhere from 3:1 to 45:2 ...|$|E
2500|$|The term <b>paraphrenia</b> was {{originally}} popularized by Karl Ludwig Kahlbaum in 1863 {{to describe the}} tendency of certain psychiatric disorders to occur during certain [...] transitional periods in life (describing <b>paraphrenia</b> hebetica as the insanity of the adolescence and <b>paraphrenia</b> senilis as the insanity of the elders.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Paraphrenia</b> is not {{included}} in the DSM-5; psychiatrists often diagnose patients presenting with <b>paraphrenia</b> as having atypical psychoses, delusional disorder, psychoses not otherwise specified, schizoaffective disorders, and persistent persecutory states of older adults. [...] Recently, mental health professionals have also been classifying <b>paraphrenia</b> as very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis.|$|E
2500|$|While the {{diagnosis}} of <b>paraphrenia</b> is not currently included in the DSM-IV or the ICD-10, many studies have recognized the condition as [...] "a viable diagnostic entity that is distinct from schizophrenia, with organic factors {{playing a role in}} a significant portion of patients." [...] As such, <b>paraphrenia</b> is seen as being distinct from both schizophrenia and progressive dementia in old age. [...] Ravindran (1999) developed a list of criteria for {{the diagnosis}} of <b>paraphrenia,</b> which agrees with much of the research done up to the time it was published.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{patients}} who present with <b>paraphrenia</b> have significant auditory or visual loss, are socially isolated {{with a lack}} of social contact, do not have a permanent home, are unmarried and without children, and have maladaptive personality traits. [...] While these factors do not cause <b>paraphrenia,</b> they do make individuals more likely to develop the disorder later in life.|$|E
2500|$|It is {{suggested}} that individuals who develop <b>paraphrenia</b> later in life have premorbid personalities, and {{can be described as}} “quarrelsome, religious, suspicious or sensitive, unsociable and cold-hearted.” Many patients were also described as being solitary, eccentric, isolated and difficult individuals; these characteristics were also long-standing rather than introduced by the disorder. [...] Most of the traits recognized prior to the onset of <b>paraphrenia</b> in individuals can be grouped as either paranoid or schizoid. [...] Patients presenting with <b>paraphrenia</b> were most often found to be living by themselves (either single, widowed, or divorced). [...] There have also been reports of low marriage rate among paraphrenics and these individuals also have few or no children (possibly because of this premorbid personality).|$|E
2500|$|Individuals {{who develop}} <b>paraphrenia</b> {{have a life}} {{expectancy}} similar to the normal population. [...] Recovery from the psychotic symptoms seems to be rare, {{and in most cases}} <b>paraphrenia</b> results in in-patient status {{for the remainder of the}} life of the patient. [...] Patients experience a slow deterioration of cognitive functions and the disorder can lead to dementia in some cases, but this development is no greater than the normal population.|$|E
2500|$|The main {{symptoms}} of <b>paraphrenia</b> are paranoid delusions and hallucinations. [...] The delusions often involve the individual being {{the subject of}} persecution, although {{they can also be}} erotic, hypochondriacal, or grandiose in nature. [...] The majority of hallucinations associated with <b>paraphrenia</b> are auditory, with 75% of patients reporting such an experience; however, visual, tactile, and olfactory hallucinations have also been reported. [...] The paranoia and hallucinations can combine in the form of “threatening or accusatory voices coming from neighbouring houses [...] are frequently reported by the patients as disturbing and undeserved". [...] Patients also present with a lack of symptoms commonly found in other mental disorders similar to <b>paraphrenia.</b> [...] There is no significant deterioration of intellect, personality, or habits and patients often remain clean and mostly self-sufficient. [...] Patients also remain oriented well in time and space.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Paraphrenia</b> is {{a mental}} {{disorder}} {{characterized by an}} organized system of paranoid delusions with or without hallucinations (the positive symptoms of schizophrenia) without deterioration of intellect or personality (its negative symptom).|$|E
2500|$|<b>Paraphrenia</b> {{is often}} {{associated}} with a physical change in the brain, such as a tumor, stroke, ventricular enlargement, or neurodegenerative process. [...] Research that reviewed the relationship between organic brain lesions and the development of delusions suggested that [...] "brain lesions which lead to subcortical dysfunction could produce delusions when elaborated by an intact cortex".|$|E
2500|$|In recent medicine, {{the term}} <b>paraphrenia</b> has been {{replaced}} by the diagnosis of [...] "very late-onset schizophrenia-like psychosis" [...] and has also been called [...] "atypical psychoses, delusional disorder, psychoses not otherwise specified, schizoaffective disorders, and persistent persecutory states of older adults" [...] by psychotherapists.

2500|$|The {{term was}} also used by Sigmund Freud {{for a short time}} {{starting}} in 1911 {{as an alternative to the}} terms schizophrenia and dementia praecox, which in his estimation did not correctly identify the underlying condition, and by Emil Kraepelin in 1913, who changed its meaning to describe <b>paraphrenia</b> as it is understood today, as a small group of individuals that have many of the symptoms of schizophrenia with a lack of deterioration and thought disorder. [...] Kraepelin's study was discredited by Wilhelm Mayer in 1921 when he conducted a follow-up study using Kraepelin's data. [...] His study suggested that there was little to no discrimination between schizophrenia and paraphrenia; given enough time, patients presenting with <b>paraphrenia</b> will merge into the schizophrenic pool. However, Meyer's data are open to various interpretations. In 1952, Roth and Morrissey conducted a large study in which they surveyed the mental hospital admissions of older patients. [...] They characterized patients as having [...] "paraphrenic delusions which… occurred in each case in the setting of a well-preserved intellect and personality, were often ‘primary’ in character, and were usually associated with the passivity failings or other volitional disturbances and hallucinations in clear consciousness pathognomonic of schizophrenia".|$|E

50|$|According to Michael Phelan, Padraig Wright, and Julian Stern (2000), {{paranoia}} and <b>paraphrenia</b> are debated {{entities that}} were detached from dementia praecox by Kraepelin, who explained paranoia {{as a continuous}} systematized delusion arising much later in life with no presence of either hallucinations or a deteriorating course, <b>paraphrenia</b> as an identical syndrome to paranoia but with hallucinations. Even at the present time, a delusion need not be suspicious or fearful to be classified as paranoid. A person might be diagnosed with paranoid schizophrenia without delusions of persecution, simply because their delusions refer mainly to themselves.|$|E
