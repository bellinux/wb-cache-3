500|$|The Regional Flag and Regional Emblem Ordinance states what {{manner of}} use of the Hong Kong flag is {{prohibited}} and that desecration of the flag is prohibited; it also states {{that it is a}} <b>punishable</b> <b>offence</b> for a person to use the flag in a prohibited manner or desecrate the flag. [...] According to the ordinance, a flag may not be used in advertisements or trademarks, and that [...] "publicly and wilfully burning, mutilating, scrawling on, defiling or trampling" [...] the flag is considered flag desecration. Similarly, the National Flag and National Emblem Ordinance extends the same prohibition toward the national PRC flag. The ordinances also allow for the Chief Executive to make stipulations regarding the use of the flag. [...] In stipulations made in 1997, the Chief Executive further specified that the use of the flag in [...] "any trade, calling or profession, or the logo, seal or badge of any non-governmental organisation" [...] is also prohibited unless prior permission was obtained.|$|E

5000|$|Addition of IPC {{offences}} attracting {{committed against}} Dalits or Adivasis as <b>punishable</b> <b>offences</b> under the POA Act. Presently, only those offences listed in IPC as attracting punishment of 10 {{years or more}} and committed on Dalits/ Adivasis are accepted as offences falling under the POA Act. A number of commonly committed offences (hurt, grievous hurt, intimidation, kidnapping etc.) are excluded from the Act. This provides loopholes for the perpetrators of crime to escape from being punished for these commonly committed crimes. Therefore, a Schedule of list of IPC offences is provided in the amended act.|$|R

2500|$|Throughout Owen's {{lifetime}} and for decades after, homosexual activity between men was a <b>punishable</b> <b>offence</b> in British law, and {{the account of}} Owen's sexual development has been somewhat obscured because his brother Harold removed what he considered discreditable passages in Owen's letters and diaries {{after the death of}} their mother. Andrew Motion wrote of Owen's relationship with Sassoon: [...] "On the one hand, Sassoon's wealth, posh connections and aristocratic manner appealed to the snob in Owen: on the other, Sassoon's homosexuality admitted Owen to a style of living and thinking that he found naturally sympathetic." ...|$|E
2500|$|Given {{that the}} Quran is {{allegedly}} vague regarding {{the punishment of}} homosexual sodomy, Islamic jurists, turned to the collections of the hadith and seerah (accounts of Muhammad's life) to support their argument for Hudud punishment. There were varying opinions on how {{the death penalty was}} to be carried out. Abu Bakr apparently recommended toppling a wall on the evil-doer, or else burning alive, while Ali bin Abi Talib ordered death by stoning for one [...] "luti" [...] and had another thrown head-first from the top of a minaret—according to Ibn Abbas, this last punishment must be followed by stoning. With few exceptions all scholars of Sharia, or Islamic law, interpret homosexual activity as a <b>punishable</b> <b>offence</b> as well as a sin. There is no specific punishment prescribed, however, and this is usually left to the discretion of the local authorities on Islam. There are several methods by which sharia jurists have advocated the punishment of gays or lesbians who are sexually active. One form of execution involves an individual convicted of homosexual acts being stoned to death by a crowd of Muslims. Other Muslim jurists have established ijma ruling that those committing homosexual acts be thrown from rooftops or high places, and this is the perspective of most Salafists.|$|E

In this matter of Mabey--assuming your {{statement}} of it to be exact--the gamekeeper may have exceeded his duty; but by so little that it is hardly worth comment.

It is before the magistrates of his own appointing that such a matter must be laid, since it is matter strictly concerning his own seigneurial jurisdiction.

60|$|A {{day or so}} later--and again {{his freedom}} to go as he pleased upon the roads may {{be taken as a}} mark of {{increasing}} social disorganisation and police embarrassment--he wandered out into the open country. He speaks of the roads of that plutocratic age as being 'fenced with barbed wire against unpropertied people,' of the high-walled gardens and trespass warnings that kept him to the dusty narrowness of the public ways. In the air, happy rich people were flying, heedless of the misfortunes about them, as he himself had been flying two years ago, and along the road swept the new traffic, light and swift and wonderful. One was rarely out of earshot of its whistles and gongs and siren cries even in the field paths or over the open downs. The officials of the labour exchanges were everywhere overworked and infuriated, the casual wards were so crowded that the surplus wanderers slept in ranks under sheds or in the open air, and since giving to wayfarers had been made a <b>punishable</b> <b>offence</b> there was no longer friendship or help for a man from the rare foot passenger or the wayside cottage....|$|E
6000|$|The {{state of}} repair of {{inhabited}} buildings is also already {{a matter of public}} concern. All that is needed is a slow, persistent tightening-up of the standard. This would ensure, at any rate, that the outer shell of the child's surroundings gave it a fair chance in life. In the next place comes legislation against overcrowding. There must be a maximum number of inhabitants to any tenement, and a really sane law will be far more stringent to secure space and air for young children than for adults. There is little reason, except the possible harbouring of parasites and infectious disease, why five or six adults should not share a cask on a dust heap as a domicile--if it pleases them. But directly children come in we touch the future. The minimum permissible tenement for a maximum of two adults and a very young child is one properly ventilated room capable of being heated, with close and easy access to sanitary conveniences, a constant supply of water and easy means of getting warm water. More than one child should mean another room, and it seems only reasonable if we go so far as this, to go further and require a minimum of furniture and equipment, a fire-guard, for instance, and a separate bed or cot for the child. In a civilized community little children should not sleep with adults, and the killing of children by [...] "accidental" [...] overlaying should be a <b>punishable</b> <b>offence.</b> [Footnote: In the returns I have quoted from Blackburn, Leicester, and Preston the number of deaths from suffocation per 100,000 infants born was 232 {{in the first year of}} life. ] ...|$|E

60|$|Second, it's {{impossible}} to pass over altogether the most unpleasant, {{but the most}} important part of this problem. I will deal with it as distantly as possible. I do not believe there is any harm whatever in reading about murders; rather, if anything, good; for the thought of death operates very powerfully with the poor in the creation of brotherhood and a sense of human dignity. I do not believe there is a pennyworth of harm in the police news, as such. Even divorce news, though contemptible enough, can really in most cases be left to the discretion of grown people; and how far children get hold of such things is a problem for the home and not for the nation. But there is a certain class of evils which a healthy man or woman can actually go through life without knowing anything about at all. These, I say, should be stamped and blackened out of every newspaper with the thickest black of the Russian censor. Such cases should either be always tried in camera or reporting them should be a <b>punishable</b> <b>offence.</b> The common weakness of Nature and the sins that flesh is heir to we can leave people to find in newspapers. Men can safely see in the papers what they have already seen in the streets. They may safely find in their journals what they have already found in themselves. But we do not want the imaginations of rational and decent people clouded with the horrors of some obscene insanity which has no more to do with human life than the man in Bedlam who thinks he is a chicken. And, if this vile matter is admitted, let it be simply with a mention of the Latin or legal name of the crime, and with no details whatever. As it is, exactly the reverse is true. Papers are permitted to terrify and darken the fancy of the young with innumerable details, but not permitted to state in clean legal language what the thing is about. They are allowed to give any fact about the thing except the fact that it is a sin.|$|E
