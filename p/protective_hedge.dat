50|$|Ananas bracteatus {{is grown}} as an {{ornamental}} plants for its decorative red fruit. The leaves are long with sharp spines, {{so it can}} be used as a <b>protective</b> <b>hedge</b> for home security. In colder places they can be grown indoors as a houseplant. It grows throughout Brazil at elevations of 450 to(-) 1050 ft.|$|E
50|$|Vachellia horrida {{is used as}} forage for livestock, for its {{wood and}} for fuel. Because of its huge thorns, it makes an {{excellent}} <b>protective</b> <b>hedge.</b> It {{used to be the}} most important tree for the tanning industry in South Africa, but extract from its bark leaves the leather with a rather bad smell. The tree produces good gum, but it is yellowish in color.|$|E
5000|$|The {{treeless}} uplands of the Eifel (at around 500 metres) {{east of the}} High Fens in Germany's {{border region}} with Belgium are exposed to strong - and in winter, ice-cold - west winds; this is even reflected {{in the name of}} Kalterherberg (kalt = [...] "cold"). The laying of <b>protective</b> <b>hedges</b> made of red beech in the Monschau Land is recorded from the late 17th century. They grow to a size of 0.7 to 1 metre thick and 6 to 10 metres high and are thus higher than the houses in places; they can be over 40 metres long. The hedges are given stability by a careful interweaving of stems and branches and regularly trimming.|$|R

Negative consequences are in situ erosion and land impoverishment, and even more serious damage such as physical and chemical pollution in downstream areas. Land impoverishment {{is due to the}} loss of fertile topsoil with its load of organic matter and nutrients. Nonetheless, the overland flowing water could be beneficial by helping to reduce the drought risk, if it could be controlled and encouraged to infiltrate the soil. Grass hedges are a cheap and effective structure for controlling overland flow and for filtering nutrients and pollutants, but research has mainly focused on their use in tropical, subtropical and Mediterranean environments. Here, two grass species were tested for their ability to reduce overland flow and soil erosion. Simulated rainfall was applied during sets of three 1 -h runs to evaluate the effects of <b>protective</b> grass <b>hedges.</b> We tested two different grasses, Pennisetum alopecuroide and Arundinella hirta, under three rain intensities of 14, 22 and 36 mm h− 1, and 5 - 20 % slope gradients on overland flow and soil loss. Plots without grass hedges were used as control. Our results show that grass hedges reduced overland flow by 72 % for Pennisetum and by 36 % for Arundinella on average. Such native, non-invasive, perennial grasses proved to be very promising for use in conservation practices...|$|R
6000|$|So {{much for}} the {{material}} results to the sex. What are the moral results? One does not like to speak of them, particularly {{to those who do}} not and can not know--to good women in whose innocent minds female immorality is inseparable from flashy gowning and the painted face; to foolish, book-taught men who honestly believe in some <b>protective</b> sanctity that <b>hedges</b> womanhood. If men of the world with years enough to have lived out of the old régime into the new would testify in this matter there would ensue a great rattling of dry bones in bodices of reform ladies. Nay, if the young man about town, knowing nothing of how things were in the [...] "dark backward and abysm of time," [...] but something of the moral difference between even so free-running a creature as the society girl and the average working girl of the factory, the shop and the office, would speak out (under assurance of immunity from prosecution) his testimony would be a surprise to the cartilaginous virgins, blowsy matrons, acrid relicts and hairy males of Emancipation. It would pain, too, some very worthy but unobservant persons not in sympathy with [...] "the cause." ...|$|R
