40|$|It {{is notable}} that {{successful}} implementation of strategy {{is very important in}} any organization - private or public. As such {{it is not surprising that}} public sector managers are expected to implement strategies to improve organizational performance and service delivery. Consequently, strategy implementation in the public sector has become an increasingly relevant and topical issue, especially because public sector organizations exist to meet the needs of particular stakeholder groups and maximize organizational performance rather than realize profits. Despite this growing focus of public sector management literature on strategy, “there have so far been few explanations about how public sector managers develop and implement new strategic approaches” (Pablo, Reay, Dewald and Casebeer, 2007 : 687). This qualitative study explores the implementation of a decentralised water service <b>provision</b> <b>model</b> at Chris Hani District Municipality (CHDM) which is located in the Eastern Cape Province in South Africa. The Chris Hani District Municipality is comprised of eight local municipalities: Lukhanji, Lady Frere, Sakhisizwe, Inkwanca, Tsolwana, Inxuba Yethemba, Intsika Yethu and Engcobo. All eight municipalities were delegated to perform the water service provision function of CHDM. The research questions are: How effective was the implementation of the CHDM decentralised water services <b>provision</b> <b>model?</b> and What are the enablers of and barriers to implementing a decentralised water <b>provision</b> <b>model</b> in CHDM? The study used the McKinsey 7 S framework of strategy execution to evaluate the implementation of the decentralised water services <b>provision</b> <b>model</b> in CHDM, enablers and barriers to executing this model were also identified. Purposively, a total of seven area managers were interviewed as the eighth Area Manager resigned and left the employment of CHDM during the time of the study. Data was gathered from Area Managers who are intimately involved in the daily operation of water services provision. Data was gathered through semi-structured interviews which were audio recorded, transcribed and data was coded and categorised according to the theoretical perspectives of the McKinsey 7 S framework. The draft report was given to the research participants for verification or comments not only as input but also as a member check before the final report. Predominantly most of the Area Managers reflected that the implementation of the decentralised water services <b>provision</b> <b>model</b> by CHDM manifested four cornerstones: (a) reducing distance to water services, (b) delegating of water provision function and accountability, (c) improving delivery of water services, and (d) putting people first in water provision. Drivers and barriers of the implementation of the decentralized water provision strategy were identified to empower local municipalities and enhance operational efficiencies and service quality. Recommendations were made to CHDM on how the implementation of the decentralised water services <b>provision</b> <b>model</b> could be enhanced for better performance. This study will benefit CHDM on improving and strengthening the alignment of all the 7 S’s elements of strategy execution to enhance the performance of the decentralised water <b>provision</b> <b>model.</b> Since no studies had been conducted previously to evaluate the implementation of a decentralised water services provision strategy at CHDM, this research is valuable to CHDM as it provides insight on the effectiveness of implementing the decentralised water <b>provision</b> <b>model.</b> Furthermore, the use of the McKinsey 7 S framework to evaluate the decentralised model is valuable as it identifies and highlights the gaps where there is misalignment of the 7 S’s of strategy execution.

40|$|Abstract Background Antenatal care models {{vary widely}} around the world, {{reflecting}} local contexts, drivers and resources. Randomised controlled trials (RCTs) have tested {{the impact of}} multi-component antenatal care interventions on service delivery and outcomes in many countries since the 1980 s. Some have applied entirely new schemes, while others have modified existing care delivery approaches. Systematic reviews (SRs) indicate that some specific antenatal interventions are more effective than others; however the causal mechanisms leading to better outcomes are poorly understood, limiting implementation and future research. As {{a first step in}} identifying what might be making the difference we conducted a scoping review of interventions tested in RCTs in order to establish a taxonomy of antenatal care models. Methods A protocol-driven systematic search was undertaken of databases for RCTs and SRs reporting antenatal care interventions. Results were unrestricted by time or locality, but limited to English language. Key characteristics of both experimental and control interventions in the included trials were mapped using SPIO (Study design; Population; Intervention; Outcomes) criteria and the intervention and principal outcome measures were described. Commonalities and differences between the components that were being tested in each study were identified by consensus, resulting in a comprehensive description of emergent models for antenatal care interventions. Results Of 13, 050 articles retrieved, we identified 153 eligible articles including 130 RCTs in 34 countries. The interventions tested in these trials varied from the number of visits to the location of care provision, and from the content of care to the professional/lay group providing that care.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{concerned}} with the increasingly formalised provision of adventure recreation facilities via a mixed economy <b>provision</b> <b>model.</b> Utilising a figurational analysis based upon the work of Norbert Elias, the study highlights how such an analysis of the processes impacting upon the wide stakeholder environment of - ' providers, funding bodies and operational partners can assist in understanding the successes and failures of such provision. Through a case study analysis of a skatepark in Dundee, Scotland, the thesis charts the development of a civilising process within skateboarding as a recreational activity. This process is shown to emerge {{as a result of the}} development of a standardised approach to provision dominated by centrally supported 'arm's length' funding bodies, such as SportScotland which focuses upon instilling the activity with a series of behaviour codes and approaches, which contradict the anti-structural characteristics of the typical skateboarding participant: The thesis argues that this civilising process, inadvertently leads to the social exclusion of the original target community, who reject the formalised provision mechanism offered to them. As a result, the thesis concludes that the current <b>provision</b> <b>model</b> is both ineffective and inefficient in its work and requires re- consideration in order to meet the needs of emerging sports such as those within the adventure recreation realm.

The trials included a range of care providers, including midwives, nurses, doctors, and lay workers. Conclusions Interventions can be defined and described in many ways. The intended antenatal care population group proved the simplest and most clinically relevant way of distinguishing trials which might otherwise be categorised together. Since our review excluded non-trial interventions, the taxonomy does not represent antenatal care provision worldwide. It offers a stable and reproducible approach to describing the purpose and content of models of antenatal care which have been tested in a trial.
