40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{avifauna}} of the Thule {{district was}} studied during three breeding season visits in 1983 - 85. The {{results are presented}} here, supplemented by data from four late summer expeditions made in 1983 - 86 by M. Lea, A. Erskine and W. Higgs. Counting the two redpolls as one, 47 species have been recorded from the Thule district, 17 of them seabirds, 10 shorebirds and 7 waterfowl. There are at least 21 species with established breeding <b>populations.</b> <b>Status</b> changes are demonstrated for three species, and three Nearctic species are recorded here for the Thule district for the first time...|$|R

5|$|The bristle-faced free-tailed bat {{appears to}} be {{extremely}} rare across its range. It has been detected at {{a limited number of}} localities and at these sites it {{appears to be}} uncommon, often comprising less than 2% of the bats captured during surveys. In NSW it has only been recorded at a small number of locations despite recent extensive surveys at over 300 sites in suitable habitat. Its preferred mode of foraging by flying at low levels along stream corridors suggests that the low numbers captured in surveys using mist nets and harp traps are an indication of rarity and are not an artifact of the survey methodology. Long-term monitoring of known populations is required to determine changes in <b>population</b> <b>status</b> of the bristle-faced free-tailed bat.|$|E
25|$|However, {{for many}} of those sites, even {{confirmation}} as to whether Orthalicus reses reses persists {{in recent years is}} lacking. Survey and monitoring efforts have been limited and highly variable, and methodologies are usually not reported in detail. Whereas Orthalicus reses reses occupies more sites at present than in the recorded past, the total area occupied remains unknown, as are trends in abundance and demographics. Overall, however, the Orthalicus reses reses <b>population</b> <b>status</b> appears to be more secure than when it was listed, due to the widespread translocations that occurred subsequently.|$|E

The head of the Project, Dr. Elena Chelysheva, was working in 2001-2002 as Assistant Researcher at the Kenya Wildlife Service (KWS) Maasai-Mara Cheetah Conservation Project. At that time, she developed original method of cheetah identification based on visual analysis of the unique spot patterns on front limbs (from toes to shoulder) and hind limbs (from toes to the hip), and spots and rings on the tail (Cat News #41, 2004 http://www.catsg.org/cheetah/01_information/1_3_periodical-reports/cat-news/cat-news.htm). Collected over the years, photographic data allows the Project team tracing kinship between generations and building Mara Cheetah Pedigree. The data collected helps to reveal parental relationship between individuals, survival rate of cubs, cheetah lifespan and personal reproductive history. This work has {{never been done before}} and the team is sharing results with the Mara stakeholders and respondents. The ongoing research is a follow-up study, which will compare results with the previous one in terms of cheetah <b>population</b> <b>status</b> and effect of human activity on cheetah behavior and surviving. The project {{is working in}} affiliation with Kenya Wildlife Service, Narok and Transmara County Councils and with assistance of Coordinator of Maasai-Mara Cultural Village Tour Association (MMCVTA). The team is cooperating with Mara Hyena Project and working with managers and driver-guides from over 30 different Mara camps and lodges. Rangers and driver/guides are trained cheetah identification techniques and provided with Catalogues of the Mara cheetahs.|$|E

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] Health {{expectancy}} is {{an increasingly}} used indicator of <b>population</b> health <b>status.</b> It collapses both mortality and morbidity {{into a single}} indicator, and is therefore preferred to the total life expectancy index for populations with low mortality but high morbidity rates. Three methods of calculation exist: the Sullivan, double decrement, and multi-state methods. This report aims to describe their relative advantages and limitations when used to monitor changes in <b>population</b> health <b>status</b> over time. DESIGN [...] The differences between the three methods are explained. Using a dynamic model of heart disease, {{the effect of the}} introduction of thrombolytic treatment on the survival of patients with acute myocardial infarction is calculated. The resulting changes in health expectancy are calculated according to the Sullivan and multi-state methods. MAIN RESULTS [...] As opposed to the double decrement and the multi-state methods, the Sullivan method produces spurious trends in health expectancy in response to the change in survival. CONCLUSIONS [...] Estimates of health expectancy in a dynamic situation can be very misleading when based on the Sullivan method, with its attractively moderate data requirements. The multi-state method, which requires longitudinal studies of <b>population</b> health <b>status,</b> is often indispensable...|$|R
500|$|Due to a {{combination}} of unstable political situations in its range, and its nocturnal, arboreal lifestyle, population data for the pygmy slow loris are scarce. The population in China has been estimated at less than 500 individuals. In the 1980s, one estimate placed the population at roughly 72,000 individuals, while another estimate from the same period placed the number around 600â€“700 individuals. This enormous discrepancy underlines the difficulty to calculate population size without detailed field studies. In Laos, the wildlife status report of 1999 describes the species as [...] "little known" [...] and [...] "common", based on availability of potential habitat. In 2000 the IUCN classified the pygmy slow loris as [...] "Vulnerable", as did the Vietnam Red Data Book the same year. The European Union (EU) (2005) describes the <b>population</b> <b>status</b> in Laos as [...] "apparently widespread, but not common anywhere".|$|E
500|$|The {{giant otter}} is an apex predator, and its <b>population</b> <b>status</b> {{reflects}} the overall health of riverine ecosystems. It feeds mainly on fish, including cichlids, characins (such as piranha), and catfish. One full-year study of giant otter scats in Amazonian Brazil found fish {{present in all}} fecal samples. Fish from the order Perciformes, particularly cichlids, were seen in 97% of scats, and Characiformes, such as characins, in 86%. Fish remains were of medium-sized species that seem to prefer relatively shallow water, {{to the advantage of}} the probably visually oriented giant otter. Prey species found were also sedentary, generally swimming only short distances, which may aid the giant otter in predation. Hunting in shallow water has also been found to be more rewarding, with water depth less than [...] having the highest success rate. The giant otter seems to be opportunistic, taking whatever species are most locally abundant. If fish are unavailable, it will also take crabs, snakes, and even small caimans and anacondas.|$|E
500|$|Jaguar {{conservation}} {{is complicated by}} the species' extremely large range which spans 18 countries with different policies and regulations. One approach has been to pinpoint specific areas of high importance for jaguar conservation efforts, so-called [...] "hotspots". These hotspots, described as jaguar conservation units, are large areas populated by about 50 jaguars. This method has been used in tiger conservation, and has seen some success. Each unit was graded on a scale integrating unit size, connectivity, habitat quality, jaguar hunting, prey hunting, and jaguar <b>population</b> <b>status</b> into a prioritization assessment. The result of an analysis across the Jaguarâ€™s historic range was the identification of about 51 areas that are priorities for jaguar conservation. However, recent studies underlined that to maintain the robust exchange across the jaguar gene pool necessary for maintaining the species, it is important that jaguar habitats are interconnected. To facilitate this, a new project, the Paseo del Jaguar, has been established to connect several jaguar hotspots.|$|E

500|$|The eastern small-footed bat (Myotis leibii) is {{a species}} of vesper bat. It {{can be found in}} Ontario and Quebec in Canada and in the Eastern United States. It is among the {{smallest}} bats in eastern North America and is known for its small feet and black face-mask. Until recently all North American small-footed Myotis were considered to be [...] "Myotis leibii". The western population is now considered to be a separate species, Myotis ciliolabrum. The Eastern small footed bat is rare throughout its range, although the species may be locally abundant where suitable habitat exists. Studies suggest white-nose syndrome has caused declines in their populations. However, most occurrences of this species have only been counted within the past decade or two and are not revisited regularly, making their <b>population</b> <b>status</b> difficult to assess. Additionally, bat populations in the Eastern U.S. have typically been monitored using surveys conducted in caves and mines in the winter, but small-footed bats hibernate in places that make them unlikely to be encountered during these surveys. As a result, numbers of small-footed bats counted in winter tend to be low and relatively variable compared to other species of bats. Many biologists believe the species is stable, having declined little in recent times, but that it is vulnerable, especially in its cave hibernacula.|$|E

40|$|The need to {{synthesise}} mortality and morbidity information {{to achieve a}} more global and relevant measure of <b>population</b> health <b>status</b> is well recognised, with health expectancy indices being the most common approach used to date. Using New Zealand hospital discharge and mortality data over the 1980 - 98 period, we introduce readers to a newly developed health index, the Hospital Utilisation Expectancy (HUE).

Some major threats to tigers have been identified.
