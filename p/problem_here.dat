5|$|Control {{systems have}} a need for {{smoothing}} filters in their feedback loops with criteria to maximise the speed of movement of a mechanical system to the prescribed mark {{and at the same}} time minimise overshoot and noise induced motions. A key <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> is the extraction of Gaussian signals from a noisy background. An early paper on this was published during WWII by Norbert Wiener with the specific application to anti-aircraft fire control analogue computers. Rudy Kalman (Kalman filter) later reformulated this in terms of state-space smoothing and prediction where it is known as the linear-quadratic-Gaussian control problem. Kalman started an interest in state-space solutions, but according to Darlington this approach can also be found in the work of Heaviside and earlier.|$|E
5|$|Another {{parasitic}} trematode {{example is}} seen in a terrestrial setting. Leucochloridium is a genus of flatworm (phylum Platyhelminthes) which matures in the intestine of songbirds. Their eggs pass out of the bird in the feces and are then taken in by Succinea, a terrestrial snail that lives in moist environments. The eggs develop into larvae inside this intermediate host, and then must {{find their way into}} the digestive system of a suitable bird. The <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> is that these birds do not eat snails, so the sporocyst must find some way of manipulating its future host into eating it. Unlike related species, these parasites are brightly colored and able to move in a pulsating manner. A sporocyst sac forces its way into the snail's eye stalks, and pulsates at high speed, enlarging the tentacle in the process. It also affects the host's behavior: the snail moves towards light, which it usually avoids. These combined factors make the sporocysts highly conspicuous, such that they are soon eaten by a hungry songbird. The snail then regenerates its tentacles, and Leucochloridium carries on with its life cycle.|$|E

25|$|Distant rumblings of a nebulous entity {{dubbed the}} 'gay plague', later {{standardised}} in nomenclature as AIDS, were heard emanating from America. There was some relief when US doctors {{discovered that it}} affected not exclusively gays, but also Haitians and haemophiliacs. However, it caused some local homosexuals to cast a wary eye on Caucasians and promiscuous Singaporeans returning from Western countries. The possibility that it would become a <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> seemed remote at the time.|$|E
25|$|Producing {{deuterium}} by fission is also difficult. The <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> {{again is}} that deuterium is very unlikely due to nuclear processes, and that collisions between atomic nuclei {{are likely to}} result either in the fusion of the nuclei, or in the release of free neutrons or alpha particles. During the 1970s, cosmic ray spallation was proposed {{as a source of}} deuterium. That theory failed to account for the abundance of deuterium, but led to explanations of the source of other light elements.|$|E
25|$|Another {{suggestion}} for simplifying {{the proof is}} to make greater use of representation theory. The <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> is that representation theory seems to require very tight control over the subgroups of a group {{in order to work}} well. For groups of small rank one has such control and representation theory works very well, but for groups of larger rank no-one has succeeded in using it to simplify the classification. In {{the early days of the}} classification there was considerable effort made to use representation theory, but this never achieved much success in the higher rank case.|$|E

25|$|Wood burning: when wood is burned, it {{is usually}} best to dry it first. Damage from {{shrinkage}} is not a <b>problem</b> <b>here,</b> and the drying may proceed more rapidly than {{in the case of}} drying for woodworking purposes. Moisture affects the burning process, with unburnt hydrocarbons going up the chimney. If a 50% wet log is burnt at high temperature, with good heat extraction from the exhaust gas leading to a 100°C exhaust temperature, about 5% of the energy of the log is wasted through evaporating and heating the water vapour. With condensers, the efficiency can be further increased; but, for the normal stove, the key to burning wet wood is to burn it very hot, perhaps starting fire with dry wood.|$|E
25|$|On 20 February 2009, a {{group of}} men in a pickup truck threw {{explosive}} devices at the installations of the Secretariat of Public Safety of the municipality of Zihuatanejo, resulting in five persons injured. The attack occurred at 7:45 pm near the municipal docks. At the time of the attack, the 56th Infantry Battalion had been stationed in Zihuatanejo, mostly to interdict the traffic in arms, drugs and stolen vehicles. The grenade attack on the security headquarters was followed by a highway ambush that killed four policemen. Kidnapping of Mexican citizens has been a <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> as well. In one instance four kidnapping victims were rescued by elements of the Mexican military and police, killing one suspect in the process.|$|E
25|$|It {{also must}} {{double as a}} clean room to {{preserve}} the science value of the samples. The <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> is that, while it {{is relatively easy to}} simply contain the samples once returned to Earth, researchers would also want to remove parts of the sample and use them in experiments. During all these handling procedures, the samples would need to be contained to prevent contamination of Earth. However {{at the same time the}} samples would need to be kept free from contamination by Earth micro-organisms and biological material; even a single amino acid of Earth origin could confuse the analysis. This introduces conflicting requirements. They surely can be reconciled but to date, no facility has had to do this, so new building requirements would need to be imposed.|$|E

25|$|For {{a simple}} example, take the {{presentation}} {a | a3}. Writing A for the inverse of a, we have possible strings combining {{any number of}} the symbols a and A. Whenever we see aaa, or aA or Aa we may strike these out. We should also remember to strike out AAA; this says that since the cube of a is the identity element of G, so is the cube of the inverse of a. Under these conditions the word problem becomes easy. First reduce strings to the empty string, a, aa, A or AA. Then note that we may also multiply by aaa, so we can convert A to aa and convert AA to a. The {{result is that the}} word <b>problem,</b> <b>here</b> for the cyclic group of order three, is solvable.|$|E
25|$|On March 19, 1944 the Germans invaded Hungary and Gestapo chief Adolf Eichmann {{immediately}} {{organized the}} round-up, ghettoization, and deportation of Hungarian Jews to Auschwitz. The Klausenburg ghetto was established on May 1, 1944, and was liquidated via six transports to Auschwitz between late May and early June. Knowing that the Gestapo targeted community leaders first, the Rebbe hid {{in an open}} grave in a cemetery for several weeks. He then fled {{to the town of}} Nagybánya, where he was conscripted into a forced-labor camp along with 5000 other Hungarian Jews. Though hunger was not a <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> (the barbed-wire enclosure had a back exit through which Jews could buy bread and milk from non-Jews) the Hungarian soldiers constantly badgered and searched inmates for their valuables. The Rebbe shaved his beard as authorized by the Hungarian Chief Orthodox Rabbinate. He continued to conduct prayer services and even a Shabbat tisch. Conditions were not harsh, and he and many prisoners bribed the authorities to refrain from labor.|$|E

A precedent for feather loss can be seen in other dinosaur groups such as ornithischians, in which filamentous structures were lost, and scales reappeared.

500|$|Where {{funds are}} mixed with those of another trust, or mixed with the funds of an [...] "innocent volunteer", certain general {{principles}} apply. As laid out in Re Diplock, the principle applied is that the claimant's entitlement ranks pari passu {{to that of the}} volunteer; each has an equal claim to their funds. Whether the fund decreases or increases in value, each party can claim a percentage equal to their contribution. The <b>problem</b> <b>here</b> comes if the mixed funds are used in unequal chunks to acquire other property. The long-standing rule is that established in Clayton's Case; that the money deposited first is deemed to be spent on the first property purchased. The problem with this is that if the first property becomes less valuable than the second property purchased, the first claimant loses some of their money while the second claimant is able to claim their money in its entirety. The alternate approach is the previously mentioned pari passu idea; whatever the total property is worth, the claimants get a share proportionate to their input, without assuming that the first claimant's money is tied to the first property purchased and the second claimant's money to the second property. In Barlow Clowes International v Vaughan, the Court of Appeal applied a similar set of principles, holding that the size of the contribution and the amount of time the money was part of the mixed fund were the factors to be considered.|$|E
