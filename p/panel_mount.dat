50|$|A <b>panel</b> <b>mount</b> {{computer}} monitor {{is intended for}} mounting into a flat surface with {{the front of the}} display unit protruding just slightly. They may also be mounted {{to the rear of the}} panel. A flange is provided around the LCD, sides, top and bottom, to allow mounting. This contrasts with a rack mount display where the flanges are only on the sides. The flanges will be provided with holes for thru-bolts or may have studs welded to the rear surface to secure the unit in the hole in the panel. Often a gasket is provided to provide a water-tight seal to the panel and the front of the LCD will be sealed to the back of the front panel to prevent water and dirt contamination.|$|E
5000|$|At {{some point}} before 1937, the {{catalogue}} {{number of the}} actual [...] "I. victor" [...] type specimen was mistakenly reassigned to the <b>panel</b> <b>mount.</b> Later reports of the specimen, even by the Peabody Museum's staff, therefore mistakenly stated that the original [...] "I. victor" [...] specimen comprised most of the skeleton, when {{it was in fact}} only three bones. By 1997, the situation had become so confused that Jacques Gauthier, the current curator of the museum's vertebrate paleontology collection, authorized the dismantling of both panel mounts. This allowed the bones to be properly sorted out and studied in three dimensions, which had been impossible previously when they were embedded in plaster. A full re-description of these specimens was published by paleontologist Julia Clarke in 2004.|$|E

This paper presents fabrication and installation of a solar <b>panel</b> <b>mount</b> with a dual-axis solar tracking controller. This is done so that rays from the sun fall perpendicularly unto the solar panels to maximize the capture of the rays by pointing the solar panels towards the sun and following its path across the sky.

40|$|Within {{the recent}} years many {{different}} proposals {{have been published}} about the best design of display contents for helicopter pilot assistance during DVE landing. The guidance cues are typically shown as an overlay possibly on top of additional sensor or database imagery. This overlay represents the main information source for helicopter pilots for landing. Display technology within this field applies two different principles: Multicolor head-down display (<b>panel</b> <b>mount),</b> and monochrome head-up display (helmet-mounted). For both types the state-of-the-art imagery doesn’t make use of conformal symbol sets. They rather expose the pilots to mixed views (2 D forward and bird’s eye view). Even so the trained pilots can easily interpret the presented data it doesn’t {{seem to be the}} best design for head-up displays. A study was realized to compare different proposed symbol sets (e. g. BOSS, DEVILA and JEDEYE). During approach and landing trials in our helicopter simulator these different formats were presented to the pilots on head-down and helmet-mounted displays. The evaluation of this study is based on measured flight guidance performance (objective measures) and on questionnaires (subjective measures). The results can pave the way for the planned development of a new conformal wide field of view perspective display for DVE landing assistance...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to monitor and log the output of solar <b>panels</b> <b>mounted</b> at {{different}} angles. Two solar <b>panels</b> are <b>mounted</b> {{on the roof of}} Hogue hall, one at 20 degrees, and one at 37 degrees. I expect the power output of the <b>panel</b> <b>mounted</b> at 20 degrees to be approximately 5 percent greater than the <b>panel</b> <b>mounted</b> at 37 degrees during April and May. A field programmable gate array (FPGA) from National Instruments was used to collect the data. The module used in the FPGA only accepts voltage levels between - 10 and 10 volts. Because of this, a voltage divider was used to decrease the panel 2 ̆ 7 s voltage to an acceptable level. The voltage readings are sent through an Ethernet connection to a host computer where the current and power are calculated. The voltage, power, and a time stamp were then logged to a text file for analysis. The initial readings support the hypothesis that a 17 degree shallower panel angle correlates to about 5 percent greater power output during the spring months...|$|R

40|$|Ottawa, Canada, {{where he}} is {{involved}} in data collection and flight trials in support!of GPS applications for aircraft. Mr. Graham holds an engineering degree from the University of Ottawa, a commercial pilot’s licence and an instrument rating. The safety benefits of approaches with vertical guidance are well recognised, but this level of service is typically available only at major airports (with ILS) or to aircraft with sophisticated and costly avionics (Baro VNAV). In May 2000, when selective availability was set to zero, GPS accuracy increased significantly. Ionospheric effects are now {{the major source of}} error, yet even {{at the height of the}} sunspot cycle, vertical accuracy in the order of 8. 5 m (95 %) is being observed. Studies indicate that raw GPS, with suitable monitoring techniques, is able to meet the certification requirements for VNAV equipment, and in fact outperforms currently certified barometric VNAV systems in terms of accuracy and integrity. Newer TSO C 129 a <b>panel</b> <b>mount</b> receivers are being designed with analogue hardware to support!VNAV, and the aviation databases already accommodate the parameters required to define a vertical path. This paper investigates the concept of using raw GPS altitude data to provide vertical guidance, with integrity, on LNAV-only and LNAV/VNAV approaches...|$|E
