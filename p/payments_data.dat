The error graphs of one-step-ahead predictions on real-world <b>payment</b> <b>data</b> reveal that the moving average model performs best, followed by the dynamic system with constraint, and finally the dynamic system without constraint...|$|R

50|$|Capital {{movements}} {{offset the}} surpluses or deficits {{in the current}} account. A current account surplus, for example, implies that rather than using all the foreign currency earned by selling exports to buy imports, corporations and individuals choose to invest the money in foreign-currency-denominated assets instead. As measured in Japan's balance of <b>payments</b> <b>data,</b> capital movements consist of long- and short-term investments and movements in official foreign exchange reserves and private bank accounts. Capital movements include loans, portfolio investments in corporate stock, and direct investment (establishment or purchase of subsidiaries abroad). A capital outflow occurs when a Japanese individual or corporation makes a loan, buys foreign stock, or establishes a subsidiary abroad. A capital inflow occurs when foreigners engage in these operations in Japan.|$|E
50|$|In Japan's {{balance of}} <b>payments</b> <b>data,</b> {{these changes are}} most readily seen in the {{long-term}} capital account. During {{the first half of}} the 1960s, this account generally showed small net inflows of capital (as did the short-term capital account). From 1965 on, however, the long-term capital account consistently showed an outflow, ranging from US$1 billion to US$12 billion during the 1970s. The sharp shift in the balance of payments brought about by the oil price hike at the decade's end produced an unusual net inflow of long-term capital in 1980 of US$2.3 billion, but thereafter the outflow resumed and grew enormously. From nearly US$10 billion in 1981, the annual net outflow of long-term capital reached nearly US$137 billion in 1987 and then dropped slightly, to just over US$130 billion, in 1988.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{contributes}} to the emerging literature on the application of smart card fare <b>payment</b> <b>data</b> to public transportation planning. The research objective is to identify and assess complete, multimodal journeys using Oyster smart card fare <b>payment</b> <b>data</b> in London. Three transfer combinations (bus-to-Underground, Underground-to-bus, and bus-to-bus) are considered to formulate recommendations for maximum elapsed time thresholds to identify transfers between journey stages for each passenger on the London network. Recommended elapsed time thresholds for identifying transfers are 20 min for Underground-to-bus, 35 min for bus-to-Underground, and 45 min for bus-to-bus, but a range of values that account for variability across the network are also assessed. Key findings about bus and Underground travel in London include an average of 2. 3 daily public transportation journeys per passenger, 1. 3 journey stages per public transportation journey, and 23 % of Underground journeys involving a transfer to or from a bus. The application of complete journey data to bus network planning is used to illustrate the value of new information that {{would be available to}} network planners through the use of smart card fare <b>payment</b> <b>data.</b> Transport for London (Organization...|$|R

40|$|Balance of <b>payments</b> <b>data</b> are {{sometimes}} {{used to try}} to predict currency or financial crises. A high current account deficit relative to GDP, a large proportion of external debt relative to equity flows, and a large proportion of investment portfolio flows versus longer-term debt or direct investment have been considered "warning signals" of potential impending financial crises in some economies. Using balance of <b>payments</b> <b>data</b> for these purposes suggests the need for a careful understanding of what underlies the data. This article aims to further our understanding of some of the elements in New Zealand's balance of payments current account and financial account data so that we can make more insightful interpretations of developments in the balance of payments. It provides several examples of how corporate financing choices could affect measured flows. Because of legal arrangements, certain corporate transactions may result in the overstatement of one type of capital flow relative to another in economic terms. Therefore, analysis of capital flows at face value could be misleading when interpreting the flows from a macro-financial stability perspective. ...|$|E

High direct investment outflows and low inflows compared with the United Kingdom and France are often seen as a sign of weakness of the Gennan "Standort". The relative attractiveness of different countries for foreign direct investment is usually measured in tenns of the balance of <b>payments</b> <b>data</b> of the host countries. However, owing to still very divergent recording practices across the industrial countries, such comparisons may be misleading. In this paper it is shown that the statistical eITors are minor if investor countries", rather than host countries", data are used to compare the relative attractiveness of different economies for foreign direct investments. Over aperiod of 11 years, foreign balance of <b>payments</b> <b>data</b> show that Gennany has received a considerably higher amount of foreign direct investments than is recorded in the Gennan balance of payments. On the outflow side the different data sources give a more homogeneous picture of a persistently heavy commitment of Gennan companies abroad [...] ...|$|E
