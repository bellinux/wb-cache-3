No one cared to rescue Judd when he was harmed throughout his youth. Despite Judd's growing into a harsh man, reviewer Hary Sheehan noted, he preserves a glimmer of empathy. Journalist Kate Cavanaugh wrote that Judds' inability to love and cherish Shiloh is borne because of the love his family nurtured in him.|$|E

25|$|The prize contest begins. Beckmesser {{attempts}} {{to sing the}} verses that he had obtained from Sachs. However, he garbles the words (Morgen ich leuchte) and fails to fit them to an appropriate melody, and ends up singing so clumsily that the crowd laughs him off. Before storming off in anger, he yells that the song was not even his: Hans Sachs tricked him into singing it. The crowd is confused. How could the great Hans Sachs have written such a bad song? Sachs tells them that the song is not his own, and also {{that it is in}} fact a beautiful song which the masters will love when they hear it sung correctly. To prove this, he calls a witness: Walther. The <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> curious about the song (correctly worded as Morgenlich leuchtend im rosigen Schein) that they allow Walther to sing it, and everyone is won over in spite of its novelty.|$|E

500|$|The play {{repeatedly}} mocks Victorian {{traditions and}} social customs, {{marriage and the}} pursuit of love in particular. In Victorian times earnestness was considered to be the over-riding societal value, originating in religious attempts to reform the lower classes, it spread to the upper ones too throughout the century. The play's very title, with its mocking paradox (serious <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> because they do not see trivial comedies), introduces the theme, it continues in the drawing room discussion, [...] "Yes, but you must be serious about it. I hate people who are not serious about meals. It is so shallow of them," [...] says Algernon in Act 1; allusions are quick and from multiple angles.|$|E

The Soviet Union's involvement in a war in Afghanistan was in its third year, a matter which was also contributing to international tension. In this atmosphere, on November 22, 1982, Time magazine published an issue with Andropov on the cover.

The ambience at Hut Point was gloomy, and the unrelieved diet of seal was depressing. This seemed particularly to affect Mackintosh, and on 8 May, despite the urgent pleadings of Joyce, Richards and Ernest Wild, he decided to risk the re-formed ice and walk to Cape Evans. Victor Hayward volunteered to accompany him. Joyce recorded in his diary: [...] "I fail to understand how these <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> anxious to risk their lives again". Shortly after their departure a blizzard descended, and the two were never seen again.|$|E

500|$|Mardas {{often said}} that the Abbey Road studio was [...] "no good", much to {{producer}} George Martin's annoyance: [...] "The trouble was that Alex was always coming to the studios {{to see what we}} were doing and to learn from it, {{while at the same time}} saying ‘These <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> out of date.’ But I found it very difficult to chuck him out, because the boys liked him so much. Since it was very obvious that I didn’t, a minor schism developed". Mardas boasted that he could build a much better studio, with a 72-track tape machine, instead of the 4-track at Abbey Road—which was being updated at the time to an 8-track—so he was given the job of designing the new Apple Studio in the basement of Apple headquarters on Savile Row. One of Mardas' more outrageous plans was to replace the acoustic baffles around Starr's drums with an invisible sonic force field. Starr remembered that Mardas bought some [...] "huge" [...] computers from British Aerospace, which were stored in his barn, but [...] "they never left the barn", and were later sold as scrap metal.|$|E
500|$|Jean {{returned}} full-time to The Simpsons {{during the}} tenth season (1998). He once again became show runner with {{the start of}} the thirteenth season in 2001, this time without Reiss. Jean called it [...] "a great job with a lot of responsibility," [...] and cited [...] "the fact that people love it so much" [...] as [...] "great." [...] He adds, however, that [...] "the hardest thing at this point is just thinking of fresh ideas. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> on top of things that we've done before, so the challenge now is to think of an idea that's good, but hasn't been seen." [...] Jean's return was initially welcomed, with MSNBC's Jon Bonné stating: [...] "Jean, who took the show's helm from executive producer Mike Scully in 2001, has guided the show away from its gag-heavy, Homer-centric incarnation...these are certainly brighter days for the show's long-time fans." [...] However, some critics have argued that the quality of the show has declined in recent years during Jean's tenure. Jean has responded to this criticism by saying: [...] "Well, it's possible that we've declined. But honestly, I've been here the whole time and I do remember in season two people saying, 'It's gone downhill.' If we'd listened to that then we would have stopped after episode 13. I'm glad we didn't." ...|$|E

[...] "When someone isn't around you create what you imagine your father might be – 'a race-car driver, a four-leaf clover'," [...] Lewis explained. Lewis has said that a lot of her inspiration, for both Acid Tongue and previous work, comes from her parents. Lewis also told The Independent, [...] "I just don't know them very well. And I'm still trying to understand what happened [...] and why. It's this blank slate, I can't even remember what happened.

500|$|... "The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by series co-founder Trey Parker, and was rated TV-MA in the United States. It originally aired on Comedy Central in the United States on March 24, 2010. The episode serves primarily as a satire of pop culture criticism. Although the South Park boys wrote The Tale of Scrotie McBoogerballs simply to shock and offend people, readers delve too deeply into the meaning behind the book, finding hidden allegories and symbolism that the actual authors insist are not present. People with conflicting philosophies, including liberals and conservatives, and pro-choice and pro-life advocates, attempt to claim that the same work conveys and validates their own ideology. The script serves as a criticism of people who take such works of pop culture too seriously. Although this is demonstrated specifically through literary criticism in the episode, the theme can be extended to film criticism and television criticism as well. The episode suggests <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> desperate for inspiration, they are willing to impose their hopes and dreams into works of art, even if they completely lack those qualities. Some commentators thought South Park creators Parker and Matt Stone were implicitly mocking the amount of analysis into deeper meaning South Park itself often receives in its reviews. Others have suggested this over-analysis is a reference to the number of adult themes identified in the Harry Potter and Twilight young adult novel series.|$|E
500|$|In the United Kingdom, [...] "Just Dance" [...] debuted {{at number}} {{three on the}} UK Singles Chart, on January 4, 2009. It rose to number one the next week with total sales of 65,764 copies, and {{remained}} at the top for three weeks. In an interview with Daily Mail, Gaga explained her feelings on reaching number-one in the United Kingdom saying, [...] "It's been a long running dream {{to have a big}} hit in the UK– my fans there are so sexy and the <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> innovative and free in how they think about pop culture and music. I was in my apartment in Los Angeles {{getting ready to go to}} dance rehearsal when they called and told me, and I just cried." [...] According to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI) the song was certified platinum, and in July 2016 it became Gaga's third song to pass one million combined sales in the United Kingdom based on streaming. By January 2017, it had been streamed 6.3 million times in the nation according to the Official Charts Company, and has sold 961,000 copies as of September 2017.

500|$|Peters {{was born}} in Wesel, North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. He began riding at age seven, and {{competing}} in weekend dressage shows. By 15, he was competing outside of Germany, at international competitions in Belgium and Denmark. He received his first horse, Udon, at age 16 as a gift from his father; this horse would carry him to a bronze medal in the 1996 Summer Olympics. In 1984, he spent the summer training in San Diego, California, before returning to Germany to perform his army service. In 1985, {{he returned to the}} United States with Udon. In 1991, he opened his own barn and acquired his first sponsor, Lila Kommerstad, who purchased Udon and as of 2012 owned a portion of Peters' Arroyo Del Mar training barn. Peters gained his US citizenship in 1992, saying, [...] "The whole idea of being so patriotic, of feeling so close to one's country makes a difference. There are not too many other countries where the <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> patriotic. I really enjoy this about America." [...] Peters continues to live in the San Diego area with his wife, Shannon. Their large dressage barn is home to approximately 65 horses as of 2012, around half of which the couple trains and the other half of which are in training under other riders. Outside of his competition and training schedule, he teaches in around 30 training seminars each year. His staff call him [...] "a machine" [...] with regard to his training and competition schedule, and in addition to riding, he participates in swimming, cycling and tennis.|$|E

It was great. I'll be jammin' to it on Friday, Friday." [...] Fellow teenage singer Miley Cyrus denied that she had criticized Black, saying [...] "I am a fan" [...] and that she sang [...] "Friday" [...] while driving. Simon Cowell praised Black, saying [...] "I love her [...] the fact that she's gotten so much publicity. <b>People</b> <b>are</b> <b>so</b> upset about the song, but I think it's hysterical. [...] Anyone who can create this much controversy within a week, I want to meet. I love people like that." [...] He observed that [...] "any song to do with the weekend annoys you. It reminds me of 'Saturday Night'... It's what we call a 'hair-dryer song,' a song girls sing into their hair dryers as they're getting ready to go out. But the fact that it's making people so angry is brilliant." [...] Cowell advised Black not to [...] "listen to anyone over the age of 18. I'm being deadly serious. Whatever she's done has worked. Whether you like her or not, she's the most talked-about artist in America right now. Nobody over the age of 18 should understand her or like her. So she should just do it her way." ...|$|E
