40|$|It is {{important}} to derive priority weights from interval-valued fuzzy preferences when a pairwise comparative mechanism is used. By focusing on the significance of consistency in the pairwise comparison matrix, two numerical-valued consistent comparison matrices are extracted from an interval fuzzy judgement matrix. Both consistent matrices are derived by solving the linear or nonlinear programming models {{with the aid of}} assessments from Decision Makers (DMs). An interval priority weight vector from the extracted consistent matrices is generated. In order to retain more information hidden in the intervals, a new probability-based method for comparison of the interval priority weights is introduced. An algorithm for deriving the final <b>priority</b> <b>interval</b> weights for both consistent and inconsistent interval matrices is proposed. The algorithm is also generalized to handle the pairwise comparison matrix with fuzzy numbers. The comparative results from the five examples reveal that the proposed method, as compared with eight existing methods, exhibits a smaller degree of uncertainty pertaining to the priority weights, and is also more reliable based on the similarity measure. © 2014 Elsevier Inc.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to present a new fuzzy approach to partnership selection in the formation of virtual enterprises. The phases of the virtual enterprise life cycle are briefly described and it is shown that the partnership selection is a key factor in the formation of such complex organisations. It is justified that the partnership selection process should be formulated as a multiple criteria decision-making problem under uncertainty. A new fuzzy programming method is proposed for assessment of uncertain weights of partnership selection criteria and uncertain scores of alternative partners, in the basic framework of the Analytic Hierarchy Process. The proposed fuzzy prioritisation method uses interval pairwise comparison judgements rather than exact numerical values of the comparison ratios and transforms the initial prioritisation problem into a linear program. The method can derive <b>priorities</b> from inconsistent <b>interval</b> comparison matrices, thus eliminating the drawbacks of the existing interval prioritisation methods. Moreover, the method generalises the known prioritisation methods, since it can be used for deriving <b>priorities</b> from exact, <b>interval</b> or mixed comparison matrices, regardless of their consistency. A numerical example, illustrating the application of this method to partnership selection process is given.

40|$|The {{analytic}} hierarchy process (AHP) is {{a popular}} tool used in decision making for ranking alternatives based on quantitative and qualitative criteria. In this thesis, we investigate two applications involving the AHP: determining the greatest sports records and generating priority vectors for inconsistent interval judgments. We determine rankings of the greatest active single-season, career, and single-event sports records by applying the ratings mode of the AHP. In addition, we present an extension to a linear programming method used for generating <b>priority</b> vectors for <b>interval</b> pairwise comparison matrices. By introducing multiplicative stretch factors for each interval comparison, our linear programming method with stretching {{can be used to}} solve problems when inconsistent interval judgments are present. We describe the linear programming method, apply it to three problems, and compare its performance to other methods for solving inconsistent interval AHP problems...|$|R
40|$|In project management, owners seek {{to choose}} an {{appropriate}} project delivery method, {{as it is a}} key project success factor: In this study, a hybrid model using the Analytical Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Rough Sets Theory (RST) is developed to select the most appropriate project delivery method. The factors affecting this selection are determined from a number of benchmarks. With the application of rough sets theory {{and the development of a}} new definition for interval indiscernibility relation these factors are reduced to a set of decision criteria in order to form a hierarchical decision-making structure. Employing the rough approximations of the AHP model established, the uncertainties caused by the imprecise data involved in the project delivery method selection could be efficiently managed. An optimization procedure is performed via obtaining upper and lower linear programming models to determine <b>interval</b> <b>priorities</b> for ranking the alternative project delivery systems. The applicability and usefulness of this method will be demonstrated in a real world case study...|$|R
40|$|Some simple yet pragmatic {{methods of}} {{consistency}} test are developed to check whether an interval fuzzy preference relation is consistent. Based on {{the definition of}} additive consistent fuzzy preference relations proposed by Tanino (Fuzzy Sets Syst 12 : 117 – 131, 1984), a study is carried out to examine the correspondence between the element and weight vector of a fuzzy preference relation. Then, a revised approach is proposed to obtain priority weights from a fuzzy preference relation. A revised definition is put forward for additive consistent interval fuzzy preference relations. Subsequently, linear programming models are established to generate <b>interval</b> <b>priority</b> weights for additive interval fuzzy preference relations. A practical procedure is proposed to solve group decision problems with additive interval fuzzy preference relations. Theoretic analysis and numerical examples demonstrate that the proposed methods are more accurate than those in Xu and Chen (Eur J Oper Res 184 : 266 – 280, 2008 b) ...|$|R
40|$|Selecting {{an optimal}} project {{delivery}} {{system is a}} critical task that owners should do to ensure project success. This selection is a complex decision-making process. The complexity arises from the uncertain or not well-defined parameters and/or the multiple criteria structure of such decisions. In this study, a decision aid model using the analytical hierarchy process (AHP) coupled with rough approximation concepts is developed to assist the owners. The selection criteria are determined by studying a number of benchmarks. The model ranks the alternative delivery systems by considering both benchmark results and owner’s opinion. In interval AHP, an optimization procedure is performed via obtaining the upper and the lower linear programming models to determine the <b>interval</b> <b>priorities</b> for alternative project delivery systems. In cases having incomparable alternatives, {{which is the most}} likely case in uncertain decision making, the model uses rough set-based measures {{to reduce the number of}} decision criteria to a subset, which is able to fully rank the alternatives. To illustrate the applicability and usefulness of this methodology, a real world case study will be demonstrated...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} dynamic {{bandwidth}} allocation algorithm for Ethernet Passive Optical Networks (EPON), which makes use of the Multipoint Control Protocol (MPCP) with threshold reporting and with inter- and intra-ONU priority scheduling. Three varieties of this algorithm are compared under both symmetric and asymmetric traffic conditions, {{by means of a}} detailed simulation program, regarding average packet delay for several priorities, delay variation for constant bit rate (CBR) traffic and bandwidth utilization. Two types of intra-ONU priority scheduling algorithms are considered, being full and <b>interval</b> <b>priority</b> scheduling, called FPS and IPS, respectively. It is shown that by combining IPS with the threshold reporting mechanism one can achieve a nearly optimal bandwidth utilization (by avoiding nearly all fragmentation losses). IPS, however, causes an increased packet delay and delay variation for CBR traffic in comparison with FPS. In order to eliminate this drawback, we combine the IPS scheduling algorithm with a rate-based scheme for the highest priority (CBR) traffic. The combined IPSA algorithm provides an interesting trade-off between the efficiency, which is still near to the optimal, and the delay characteristics of time critical applications. Finally, we also demonstrate that unfairness arises with FPS under asymmetric traffic conditions, that is, ONUs with more best effort traffic are favored by FPS. Whereas asymmetric traffic conditions only slightly affect the fairness of IPS under low load conditions...|$|R
30|$|Safety {{applications}} usually demand direct V 2 V ad hoc communication networks due {{to highly}} dynamic topology {{of the networks}} and the stringent delay requirements [6]. They will likely work in a broadcast fashion since safety information can be beneficial to all vehicles around a sender and safety message senders might not expect a response at the application level. For the purpose of high reliability and simple implementation, some direct (or single-hop) broadcast solutions to safety-related message transmission have been suggested and investigated. Xu et al. [7] propose several single-hop broadcast protocols to improve reception reliability and channel throughput. Torrent-Moreno et al. [8] propose a priority access scheme for IEEE 802.11 -based vehicular ad hoc networks and show that the broadcast reception probability can become very low under saturation conditions. Jiang et al. [9] raise channel congestion control issues for vehicular safety communication, and introduce feedback information to enhance system performance and reliability. ElBatt et al. [10] discuss the suitability of DSRC periodic broadcast message for cooperative collision warning application. To date, all analyses and observations are mainly based on simulations [8, 11]. Although the connectivity of unicast wireless networks is studied theoretically [12], the factors that affect DSRC system performance and reliability such as IEEE 802.11 backoff counter process, hidden terminals, channel access <b>priority,</b> message generation <b>interval,</b> and high mobility on the road have not been theoretically addressed yet {{for the analysis of}} the DSRC safety broadcast communications. As a matter of fact, the exact analysis of such broadcast ad hoc networks with hidden terminal is still an open problem [13].|$|R
