5000|$|Modern welfare {{programs}} are chiefly distinguished from earlier forms of poverty relief by their universal, comprehensive character. The institution of social insurance in Germany under Bismarck was an influential example. Some schemes were based {{largely in the}} development of autonomous, mutualist <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits.</b> Others were founded on state provision. In an influential essay, [...] "Citizenship and Social Class" [...] (1949), British sociologist T.H. Marshall identified modern welfare states as a distinctive combination of democracy, welfare, and capitalism, arguing that citizenship must encompass access to social, as well as to political and civil rights. Examples of such states are Germany, all of the Nordic countries, the Netherlands, France, Uruguay and New Zealand and the United Kingdom in the 1930s. Since that time, the term welfare state applies only to states where social rights are accompanied by civil and political rights.|$|E

40|$|We use {{evidence}} from {{a survey of}} approximately 200 Polish state-owned, privatized, and de novo private manufacturing firms to investigate the nature and scope <b>of</b> enterprise-level <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> social <b>benefits,</b> and in particular how enterprise-level social provision is changing with transition, privatization {{and the emergence of}} the new private sector. We find that social provision remains surprisingly widespread, and has not been greatly reduced in either the state-owned or the privatized sectors. De novo private firms offer a substantially smaller but still significant range <b>of</b> social <b>benefits</b> to workers and, if anything, they are tending to increase rather than reduce the scale <b>of</b> their <b>provision.</b> The other main determinants of the scale <b>of</b> social <b>provision</b> aside from ownership form are firm size and employee power (the latter not explicitly via the union structure), both of which are associated with higher levels <b>of</b> social <b>provision.</b> Money wages and the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> social <b>benefits</b> appear to be complementary rather than substitutes.

The Connecticut Constitution requires that there be equal protection and due process of law, not that there be equivalent nomenclature for such protection and process. She noted that [...] "the plaintiffs may feel themselves to be relegated to a second class status, {{but there is nothing}} inthe text of the Connecticut statutes that can be read to place the plaintiffs there." [...] She also described the court's [...] "very limited authority to interfere with the determination of the General Assembly", i.e., the legislature, which she called [...] "the arbiter of public policy".|$|E
50|$|Once a {{regulatory}} agency has determined the clinical benefit {{and safety of}} a product and pricing has been confirmed (if necessary), a drug manufacturer will typically submit it for evaluation by a payer of some sort. Payers may be private insurance plans, governments (through the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> plans to insured populations or specialized entities like Cancer Care Ontario, which funds in-hospital oncology drugs) or health care organizations such as hospitals. At this point the critical issue is cost-effectiveness. This is where the discipline of pharmaco-economics is often applied. This is a specialized field of health economics that looks at the cost/benefit of a product in terms of quality of life, alternative treatments (drug and non-drug) and cost reduction or avoidance {{in other parts of}} the health care system (for example, a drug may reduce the need for a surgical intervention, thereby saving money). Structures like the UK’s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence and Canada’s Common Drug Review evaluate products in this way. Some jurisdictions do not, however, evaluate products for cost-effectiveness. In some instances, individual drug benefit plans (or their administrators) may also evaluate products. Additionally, hospitals may have their own review committees (often called a Pharmacy and Therapeutics (P&T) committee) to make decisions about which drugs to fund from the hospital budget.|$|E

30|$|Higher {{labor costs}} {{resulting}} from {{an increase in}} compliance can lead firms to make an additional adjustment. Firms can switch to a capital-intensive technology avoiding the increase in labor costs and {{the reduction in the}} production level (Loayza 1996) 7. The level of investment and labor productivity can also be negatively affected (Besley and Burgess 2004). Firms can also adjust by affecting some job attributes. They can reduce hourly wages or the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> non-mandated <b>benefits,</b> such as meals and housing. Reductions in hourly wages can affect women more than men because women can be considered “outsiders” with less bargaining power and less negotiating abilities (Montenegro and Pagés 2004). However, the final effect on hourly wages will also depend on the reallocation of workers between the formal and informal sectors of the economy. Reductions in the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> non-mandated <b>benefits</b> such as food and housing are also expected. This set <b>of</b> <b>benefits</b> should be easier to adjust for firms if they are provided voluntarily. However, if the <b>provision</b> <b>of</b> non-mandated <b>benefits</b> consists <b>of</b> an in-kind part of the monthly pay, the expected effect of an increase in enforcement is not clear. Firms may prefer to increase in-kind payments as that will provide them with more liquidity to face the increase in labor costs 8.|$|R
