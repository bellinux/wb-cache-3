50|$|The BA-3 is {{externally}} {{very similar}} to the BA-6; the BA-3 retained door {{in the rear of the}} hull that was not present in the BA-6. More important improvement of BA-6 were the new GK tires, filled with sponge (<b>porous</b> <b>rubber),</b> and thus much less vulnerable to small-caliber fire. On the downside, the tires reduced both the speed and range of the vehicle, despite it had a somewhat thinned armor. BA-3/6 cars were superseded by BA-10 model. All cars of this series were very heavily armed for the era; they could knock out other vehicles with ease, including tanks. However, their thin armor made them vulnerable to heavy machine gun fire and small caliber cannon fire.|$|E
40|$|AIM: Dental implant-supported reconstructions {{demonstrate}} {{significantly less}} physiological flexibility for loading and traumatic forces {{compared with a}} normal dentition because of their rigid integration with the adjacent bone. Ethylene vinyl acetate (EVA) material has become widely accepted as a mouthguard material; however, many studies indicate the necessity of improving the impact absorption ability by considering the design and developing new materials. The {{aim of this study}} was to compare the shock-absorbing ability of a novel dual component material comprising EVA and <b>porous</b> <b>rubber</b> with that of EVA alone. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Three groups of samples were tested: Group 1  = EVA (thickness, 4  mm), Group 2  = type 1 material (2 -mm thick <b>porous</b> <b>rubber</b> sheet sandwiched between two sheets of 1 -mm thick EVA sheets), and Group 3  = type 2 material (1 -mm thick <b>porous</b> <b>rubber</b> sheet sandwiched between EVA sheets with 1 and 2 -mm thickness, respectively). Shock absorption was determined by means of a hammer impact testing device equipped with strain gauge, accelerator, and load cell. RESULTS: The value of shock-absorbing ability of group 2 (40. 6  ±  12. 5 %) was significantly higher than those of group 1 (15. 6  ±  2. 1 %) and group 3 (21. 2  ±  9. 2 %). The material with thicker rubber sheet showed significantly higher shock-absorbing ability compared with that of the material with thinner rubber sheet. CONCLUSIONS: The novel dual material was superior to conventional EVA material in shock-absorbing ability depending on the thickness of <b>porous</b> <b>rubber,</b> and it may be potentially effective as mouthguard material, in particular, for patients wearing implant-supported constructions...|$|E

40|$|A {{problem of}} an {{increase}} {{of the power of}} turbine by improving heat transfer in condensers of steam turbines is considered in the article as a topical one. The analysis of contamination of the internal surfaces of cooling tubes and of the influence of pollution on the process of heat transfer in turbine condensers has been fulfilled. The existing method of cleaning of condenser tubes with the use of porous elastic balls of sponge rubber that is implemented on a number of large thermal power plants and state region power plants of the Republic of Belarus is examined. In the operation of the ball cleaning system a significant drawback has been revealed, viz. a low efficiency of this method due to the failure to comply with preparation the system of circulating water for operation. Also, a certain imperfection of ball cleaning system technology has been determined. One of the prerequisites for the effective functioning of the ball cleaning system is a certain degree of purity of the pipe system of the condenser, characterized by the coefficient of purity. To determine the effectiveness of ball cleaning system a series of experiments on the launching of <b>porous</b> <b>rubber</b> balls in the pipe system of the main and the embedded bunches of the T- 250 / 300 - 240 UTMZ turbine has been produced. Immediately before the experiments hydraulic cleaning of the tubes of the condenser by a high-pressure installation were carried out. During the experiments, records of the number of downloaded <b>porous</b> <b>rubber</b> balls, of the number of rubber balls captured in a loading chamber, and of the number of rubber balls that remained in a calibration device were kept. A large proportion of default of the balls caused by the presence of residues of the carbonate sediments, that obstruct the movement of <b>porous</b> <b>rubber</b> balls in the tubes of the condenser, was determined. The presence of carbonate deposits in the tubes of the condenser indicates a lack of effectiveness of antiscale treatment of circulating water and of hydraulic method of cleaning tubes of the condenser.  </p...|$|E

40|$|Increasing {{population}} and extensive urbanization have strained resources around the world, promoting water scarcity and solid waste accumulation. Addressing {{the issues of}} access to safe drinking water and basic sanitation in developing countries is challenging due to limited technological and financial resources. Therefore, {{it is imperative that}} durable, low-cost, and sustainable technologies are developed to help alleviate these problems. At the same time, the production of solid waste has increased and includes waste tires, which pose a health and environmental hazard. Although efforts have been made to develop new markets for recycled scrap tires, a vast majority are still being stockpiled or landfiled. This study aims to evaluate a water treatment system that addresses the problem of access to safe drinking water and sanitation, while providing a new market for recycled scrap tires. The system, termed ECOL-Mem, utilizes commercially available <b>porous</b> <b>rubber</b> tubing (PRT), which is marketed for drip irrigation purposes. To our knowledge, {{this is the first time}} this product has been used in a water treatment system. The PRT is manufactured through a hot extrusion process and contains 65 % recycled crumb rubber and a binder (e. g. polyethylene). The proposed configuration simulates a hollow fiber membrane filtration system driven by a vacuum that operates inside-out. The system was first tested using clean water to obtain intrinsic characteristics. It was then tested using bentonite and sludge solutions that simulated impaired source water. For the case of a bentonite solution containing 700 mg/L, 20 L of permeate could be obtained in one hour while the total solids removal remained around 20 %. In order to improve the water quality, a flocculation-enhanced filtration phase was explored. The flocculant is chitin, a biopolymer that can be derived from waste shellfish. Upon addition of the chitin, between 60 % and 70 % of total solids removal could be obtained for different feed waters. Although optimization is needed, the PRT system has shown promising results, while providing a technology that targets the needs of developing countries in the areas of safe drinking water, basic sanitation, and solid waste recycling...|$|E
40|$|A 1 kW {{phosphoric acid}} fuel-cell (PAFC) stack with 30 cells, was designed, fabricated, {{assembled}} with "in-house" developed components at ERI, KACST, and successfully operated for 250 h. The stack was operated at 180 Â°C, 1 bar, using commercial H 2 /CO 2 gas and air.

From {{the results of the}} successful operation of the stack, {{it was found that the}} stack was stable during the operation and the heat generated in the stack was sufficient to retain the temperature at 175 to 180 Â°C without any external heating. To cool the stack, three cooling plates were used in the stack. Insulation was applied to the stack to get a more uniform temperature. The water formed in the stack was collected through the H 2 gas outlets and air manifolds during the operation of the stack. As the temperature of the stack at the centre was slightly high, it is recommended introducing two more cooling-plates to achieve a more uniform temperature and better stack performance.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} is to develop and {{implement}} methods for determining the local structure and dynamics of heterogeneous samples (e. g. rocks, <b>rubber,</b> <b>porous</b> materials, etc.). From the physical point of view, the heterogeneities are best described in terms of variations in the local susceptibility. The proposed methods are based on analyzing the modulation of spin dynamics by the Magic Angle Sample Spinning (MASS) method in the presence of both local variations in the bulk magnetic susceptibility and molecular diffusion. The correlations between the dipolar and susceptibility fields are used for extracting information on the detailed structure and composition of heterogeneous samples. In {{the first part of this}} dissertation, a new method for characterizing porous media, diffusive MASS, is presented. This method is combining MASS and molecular diffusion, providing thus a unique way to simultaneously obtain high resolution spectra and information on the geometry and the internal fields inherent to porous samples. The second part is concerned with obtaining detailed information about the structure and dynamics in rubber samples with the aim of understanding the elastomer-carbon black interactions. The processes that occur at the elastomer-carbon black interface are responsible for the special properties that make rubber so useful and these processes are not yet fully understood. We use the dipolar and susceptibility interactions to characterize the elastomer spatial distribution relative to the carbon black surface, the elastomer mobility and the local order. The last section presents a MASS study of the relaxation and wettability of actual rock samples. (cont.) It is important to design experiments for characterizing wettability which are less time consuming than the current core-flooding and imbibition experiments. The combination of MASS and relaxation measurements permits the determination of the chemical composition and wetting fluid in core samples.

40|$|Technical {{specifications}} for the asphalt concrete properties are developed {{to be able}} to specify mixtures that will perform well in pavement applications. Being able to identify and determine properties related to pavement performance in practice is crucial for both road authorities and contractors, since it allows for design and risk management by determining design life times and reliability. However, the properties of Asphalt Concrete (AC) change over its lifetime and since most pavement layers last for a decade or more these changes are crucial in determining the performance in practice. For many of the standard materials the effect of aging is implicitly dealt with in the safety factors that also account for other effects such as the variation rest periods/healing and variations in traffic and weather in the design methods and specifications. Rapid changes in the materials used (increasing percentages reclaimed asphalt, bio-bitumen, rejuvenators, waste materials) and in the production of both bitumen (new refining methods resulting in different composition of bitumen) and asphalt concrete itself (warm mix asphalt, <b>porous</b> asphalt concrete, <b>rubber</b> asphalt mixtures) lead to increased uncertainty in the effects of aging. As a result, the uncertainties in pavement performance increase, which means the prediction of maintenance and the necessary budgets is getting more inaccurate. In order to maintain the ability to reliably design and maintain pavements and determine the most cost-effective solutions for a given situation, {{a better understanding of the}} aging processes and objective methods to take into account aging effects on material properties is needed. This need is widely recognized, in the USA the Mechanical Empirical Design Guide takes aging into account through aging tests on the bitumen used and in Europe CEN TC 227 works on establishing a method to assess the aging sensitivity of asphalt mixtures. This symposium aimed at combining the existing information and insights from ongoing research into recommendations that will allow the development of methods to determine aging sensitivity and the impact on pavement performance, facilitate the exchange of obtained data and stimulate further developments The resulting recommendations are: Do make long term aging sensitivity of binders part of the bitumen standards and take the results from the aging sensitivity of binders into consideration when assessing AC properties. Be aware that RTFOT testing only gives an indication of the sensitivity of a penetration grade binder to aging during hot mix production and construction, it doesn’t work for hard grades, PMB’s or warm mixes. Because of the many variables involved, developing one test method to characterise aging sensitivity seems improbable. However, PAV aging is both practical and, if tests at various conditions are carried out, able to give kinematic properties. A PAV protocol for testing at two temperatures and time intervals could provide practical characterisation information for the short term and enable model development and validation on the long term. RCAT and other aging procedures could also be used in this sense, but considering the availability of equipment and the wide spread experience, PAV is the best candidate to allow the rapid development of international experience with the approach. Based on the current standards and the work presented during the symposium, PAV tests at 90 and 100 degrees Celsius and 20 and 40 hours, respectively, are suggested. The low values for temperature and duration are based on the current standards and fit both the USA and CEN procedure, while research shows that after 40 hours at 100 degrees the chemical (FTIR) and rheological (DSR) properties of laboratory aged and field samples were similar (Section 6. 5 and 8. 5). At 100 oC the temperature is low enough so that the effect of secondary reactions is negligible. As such, these conditions are appropriate for kinetic expressions for in service pavement performance. For high temperature processes and possibly also for repeated recycling (very long term) more sophisticated methods are needed. Set-up and maintain field monitoring of temperature and UV radiation in various climate zones, as well as regular sampling over time and height to keep checking the predicted changes (from both tests and models), versus the actual changes in properties order to ensure reliability of the data as well as the applicability for pavement performance prediction. In setting up field tests, it is important to get both the composition of the virgin bitumen and the composition after mixing, transport and placement in the pavement. These compositions provide the starting points from both the material and pavement structure point of view and can be used to assess the development of aging products over time. There is a lot of discussion about the impact of binder recovery methods on the observed composition, so until it is proven that this does not have an influence, for comparisons the same recovery method should be used. Set up a coordination and support action on AC-Aging to continue to exchange information and experiences, both in research and in construction projects. develop an IR testing protocol, to facilitate the exchange of results and information. Compare the bitumen composition that is found through various recovery methods to establish if there is an effect and if so, develop a procedure to address this. To further understanding of aging, a Round Robin test on the differences in test conditions between US and EU, allowing better access to each other’s data and knowledge would be useful. When developing aging tests for AC, it would be useful to look at the US experience. As long as there is no fundamentally correct method for assessing the aging, it would be preferable to standardize it as much as possible in order to allow cooperation and exchange of data...|$|R
