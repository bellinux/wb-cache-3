Originally the College Street Baptist Church, built in 1889, replacing a smaller structure constructed in 1872, was until recently used by a Portuguese-speaking Seventh-Day Adventist congregation which sold the property. A developer has converted the former church into condominium units. The Church was listed on Toronto's Heritage <b>Properties</b> <b>Inventory</b> in early 2006. In 2009, City Council approved the designation of the Church under Part IV, Section 29 of the OntarioHeritage Act.http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2009/te/bgrd/backgroundfile-21950.pdf ...|$|R

40|$|IEEE International Conference on Systems, Man and Cybernetics, NASHVILLE, TN, OCT 08 - 11, 2000 International audienceIn {{order to}} support the design of complex systems such as optronic ones, and {{especially}} the function-processing-oriented part of this work, we propose a method set on a connection of stages. This assistance aims at making formal and thus checkable {{the representation of the}} system itself {{on the one hand and}} of its properties on the other hand. Then, it points to use those formalizations to manage the real verification of this system and to determine the agreement between ifs model and the expected properties. The principle is to follow the first steps (corresponding to the design phase) of the traditional V-cycle of system development, and to enrich each step with formal features: the first step is the elaboration, based on initial requirements, of a function processing oriented specification. The first result is then a formalized (functional and non-functional) requirements set. It allows the system designer to construct, using the generic model and <b>properties</b> <b>inventory,</b> on one hand the precise model of the system (i. e. an instantiated model, called MOTI), and on the other hand the list of properties to be verified. This MOTI is then (automatically) translated into a so-called MOTIF expressed into a formalism dedicated to formal proof (required for formal verification and validation processes). Concurrently, the expected properties (which have been extracted from the generic <b>properties</b> <b>inventory</b> enriched by specific characteristics such as user-defined values or :application-specific parameters), are translated into the accurate formalism for automated proof. By developing a solution dedicated to optronic systems, this project bn,aches the concept of multi-technologies system design. In {{order to support}} reuse, the approach is voluntarily generic and complete, thus allowing modeling and verification of (possibly any kind of) optronic systems...|$|R

The major advantage is saving {{large amounts of}} energy in recycling compared to primary raw material, which is another big plus for recycling non-ferrous metals - save primary raw material. The Czech Republic and many other countries are largely dependent on imports of certain raw materials (aluminum, lead, copper, etc.) or just on mentioned recycling. Nowadays, {{increase in the number}} of electrical devices (computers, mobile telephones, tablets, etc.), is recycling of scrap metal very important, because in each device occurs a certain amount of non- ferrous metals, noble metals, which can be used again.

50|$|The depot was {{originally}} located {{at a different}} site, on Washington Avenue near 9th Street. The rail line was sold to Southern Pacific Railroad (SP) in December 1907. In 1910, the building was moved to a site on 7th Street at Western Blvd., replaced by a new cast-stone SP depot at the original location, but remained in use for freight at its new location. In 1927, it was moved yet again, to its present site, on 7th Street at Washington Avenue. The rail line on which the former WV&C Railroad depot is located has been leased by SP to the Willamette and Pacific Railroad since 1991.
