40|$|Background: Retrospective {{clinical}} studies frequently utilize surgeon records {{as a source}} of outcomes data. The ac-curacy of data derived from surgeon records, however, is unknown. The {{purpose of the present study}} was to evaluate the accuracy of surgeon records in documenting the prevalence of subjective adverse outcomes. Methods: Consecutive patients who had undergone anterior cervical arthrodesis by four spine surgeons during a ten-month period were included. Surgeon records from the routine six-week, three-month, and six-month postoperative visits were examined for documentation of persistent dysphagia and dysphonia. <b>Patients</b> completed <b>surveys</b> inquiring about the presence and magnitude of symptoms at these three time-points. Agreement between the surgeon records and the <b>patient</b> <b>surveys</b> was analyzed with use of the kappa coefficient. Results: One hundred and sixty-six patients had 342 postoperative visits. Dysphagia was documented twenty-six times in the surgeon records, compared with 107 times on the <b>patient</b> <b>surveys.</b> Dysphagia was thus underreported in 80 % of cases. Similarly, dysphonia was documented ten times in the surgeon records, compared with seventy-two times on the <b>patient</b> <b>surveys.</b> Poor correlation between the surgeon records and the <b>patient</b> <b>surveys</b> was observed regardless of symptom severity, previous anterior cervical surgery, anterior arthrodesis of three motion segments or more, arthrode-sis cephalad to the fifth cervical level, and anterior cervical plate use. Poor correlation between the surgeon records and the <b>patient</b> <b>surveys</b> also was observed for each surgeon, regardless of subspecialty or institution...|$|R

5000|$|<b>Patient</b> {{satisfaction}} <b>surveys</b> are {{the main}} qualitative measure of the patient perspective. Patients {{may not have the}} clinical judgement of physicians and often judge quality on the basis of practitioner's concern and demeanor, among other things. [...] As a result, <b>patient</b> satisfaction <b>surveys</b> have become a somewhat controversial measure of quality care. Proponents argue that <b>patient</b> <b>surveys</b> can provide needed feedback to physicians to assist on improving their practice. In addition, patient satisfaction often correlates with patient involvement in decision making and can improve patient-centered care. Patients' evaluation of care can identify opportunities for improvement in care, reducing costs, monitoring performance of health plans, and provide a comparison across health care institutions. Opponents of <b>patient</b> satisfaction <b>surveys</b> are often unconvinced that the data is reliable, that the expense does not justify the costs, and that what is measured is not a good indicator of quality.|$|R
50|$|In the 2012 Acoustic Neuroma Association <b>patient</b> <b>survey,</b> 29% of the {{respondents}} reported facial weakness or paralysis, some of which were pre- and some were post-treatment. This represents a significant improvement from the 1998 Acoustic Neuroma Association <b>patient</b> <b>survey</b> of post-treatment acoustic neuroma patients, which revealed that at the time they completed the survey, only 59% were satisfied with the appearance of their face. Treatment for an acoustic neuroma may damage the facial nerve - either with surgery or radiation. It is usually possible, however, to preserve some degree of facial function even in cases where the nerve is extensively involved. For those with partial nerve regeneration, in whom some facial weakness remains, non-surgical facial rehabilitation therapies also may be beneficial.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: <b>Patient</b> {{experience}} <b>surveys</b> {{are increasingly}} {{important in the}} measurement of, and attempts to improve, health-care quality. To date, little research has focused upon doctors' attitudes to surveys which give them personalized feedback. AIM: This paper explores doctors' perceptions of <b>patient</b> experience <b>surveys</b> in primary and secondary care settings in order to deepen understandings of how doctors view the plausibility of such surveys. DESIGN, SETTING AND PARTICIPANTS: We conducted a qualitative study with doctors in two regions of England, involving in-depth semi-structured interviews with doctors working in primary care (n = 21) and secondary care (n = 20) settings. The doctors in both settings had recently received individualized feedback from <b>patient</b> experience <b>surveys.</b> FINDINGS: Doctors in both settings express strong personal commitments to incorporating patient feedback in quality improvement efforts. However, they also concurrently express strong negative views about the credibility of survey findings and patients' motivations and competence in providing feedback. Thus, individual doctors demonstrate contradictory views regarding the plausibility of <b>patient</b> <b>surveys,</b> leading to complex, varied and on balance negative engagements with patient feedback. DISCUSSION: Doctors' contradictory views towards <b>patient</b> experience <b>surveys</b> are likely to limit the impact of such surveys in quality improvement initiatives in primary and secondary care. We highlight the need for 'sensegiving' initiatives (i. e. attempts to influence perceptions by communicating particular ideas, narratives and visions) to engage with doctors regarding the plausibility of <b>patient</b> experience <b>surveys.</b> CONCLUSION: This study {{highlights the importance of}} engaging with doctors' views about <b>patient</b> experience <b>surveys</b> when developing quality improvement initiatives.

Patients {{are advised to}} set manageable daily activity/exercise goals and balance their activity and rest to avoid possible over-doing which may worsen their symptoms. People who can function within their individual limits may then try to gradually increase activity and exercise levels (GET) while maintaining pacing methods.
