40|$|The {{interaction}} of aerosols with the photochemistry of the troposphere is simulated in a smog chamber. The aerosol smog chamber {{consists of a}} solar simulator (with up to three-fold light intensity of the lower troposphere) and a cylindrical glass vessel (2. 4 cubic meters volume with thermostatted lid and bottom). It enables us to obtain long residence times of aerosols longer than 1 day. A photochemical smog is produced by irradiating a mixture of NO sub x (200 ppb NO 2 + 100 ppb NO) and various n-alkanes (from propane up to n-nonane), iso-alkanes and aromatics (up to 30 compounds, 100 ppb each). The concentrations of the active constituents of the <b>photosmog,</b> NO sub x and O 3, are monitored using chemiluminescent analysers, the concentrations of other active species are computed from the degradation rate of the hydrocarbons using known rate constants. In the presence and absence of SiO 2 aerosol (Aerosil) the degradation behaviour of the hydrocarbons is observed {{to be dominated by}} reactions of OH radicals. Aerosol densities up to 1 mg m - 3 have been without any impact on the chemistry of OH radicals. This enables us to study the photodegradation of non-volatile organic compounds, adsorbed as a layer on the inert SiO 2 carrier, by the reaction of the active species, OH and O 3, from the <b>photosmog.</b> In contrast to the results in the presence of SiO 2 aerosol in the presence of TiO 2 (which is an UV-absorbing semiconductor material) the concentration of OH is enhanced by a factor of ten.

The automatic monitor for sulphuric acid and sulphate of the TU Berlin has been used for sensitive measurements of sulphuric acid and other particulate sulphur aerosols under the condition of a smog chamber. The formation of both compounds is observed in irradiation experiments with the biogenic hydrocarbon alpha-pinene in a NOx <b>photosmog</b> in the presence of SO 2.

40|$|The {{photooxidation}} {{processes of}} SO 2 and the biogenic hydrocarbon alpha-pinene {{can be studied}} {{in the presence of}} a synthetic <b>photosmog</b> in bags made from teflon. A major portion of the SO 2 is converted to H 2 SO 4 and sulfur particles by, probably, heterogeneous reactions. The yield of these products is dependent on the presence of humidity. Under dry condition, the main product is H 2 SO 4 and third of the consumed SO 2 is recovered in the airborne aerosols. In the presence of 60 % relative humidity sulfurous particles are the almost exclusive product with a yield of 50 %. The nature of the sulfur aerosols is yet unknown.

40|$|During a <b>photosmog</b> {{period in}} summer 1993, several ozone plumes (enrichment of O 3 of 10 - 45 ppb over levels of {{surrounding}} air masses) {{were observed in}} the southern part of eastern Germany. Analyses of the plumes for other species reveal that SO 2, NOy, CO, and photochemically formed CH 2 O were enriched synchronously with O 3. The measured enhancement factors SO 2 /CO and NOy/CO agree well with emission factors of local emission inquiries. The O 3 production potential in the plumes must have originated from emissions from furnaces burning sulfur rich lignite coal under non-optimum conditions such as old power plants, industrial plants, and domestic water heating systems. The co-emission of VOC's with SO 2 lead to the formation of O 3 and CH 2 O. Most of the plumes seem to be less than one day old...|$|E
40|$|This article {{investigates the}} {{environmental}} profile {{and costs of}} woody BTL production and use by reviewing existing LCA studies. The findings reveal that BTL from sustainably managed forest biomass and woody waste may have a lower overall environmental impact than fossil diesel. The benefits of using BTL instead of fossil diesel are largely due to savings in fossil energy use, which offer savings in GHG emissions since {{a large part of}} the lifecycle CO 2 emissions are biogenic. Improvements in the impact category <b>photosmog</b> or summer smog have also been reported. On the other hand, wood based BTL may increase eutrophication and acidification, and increased ozone depletion and toxicity may also be expected. While global indicators like climate change, non-renewable resources and ozone depletion are fairly easy to interpret, the local indicators such as eutrophication, acidification, <b>photosmog</b> and toxicity are site specific, and an LCA will not take into account where, when and at which rate the emissions occur, which are important parameters when estimating local pollution effects. In addition, increased logging or the establishment of short rotation plantations may impact biodiversity, land-use changes and the value of nature. The reported results differed when assessing the same fuel due to differences in methodology and data assumptions. For the methodological part, differences in system boundaries, system completeness and chosen allocation methods contributed to the ranges in results. Differences regarding data inputs, such as plant efficiency and fuel consumption were also important for the differences in results. The most influential or sensitive factors within the reviewed studies were the assumed type of feedstock, plant efficiency and drivetrain. The reported production costs of BTL are in the range of 0. 70 - 1. 12 euros per liter. The costs are largely influenced by plant scale, biomass costs and plant efficiency. Biofuels are generally not considered a cost effective climate mitigation means, but there are no other feasible solutions than biofuels for the heavy transport sector in the short to medium term.

40|$|Simulation {{experiments}} were {{performed in a}} smog chamber to study the ozone formation of forestal air with special regard {{of the influence of}} biogenic hydrocarbons. According to recent field measurments in the Black Forest and near the Harz mountains a synthetic mixture of about 50 components was used for the laboratory studies. An NOx <b>photosmog</b> was used to study the ozone formation at different hydrocarbon/NOx ratios ranging from 0. 5 to 25. Compared to hydrocarbonless air the ozone formation increases up to tenfold. In first experiments the impact of terpenes on the ozone formation was studied at hydrocarbon levels around two orders of magnitude above environmental conditions. A decrease in the ozone maximum of a factor of two could be ovserved when terpene concentration is increased by two orders of magnitude compared to the field measurements. Simultaneously the ozone maximum is reached more rapidly...|$|E
40|$|A 10 -year {{study of}} surface ozone mixing ratios in the Central Mediterranean was {{conducted}} based on continuous ozone measurements from 1997 to 2006 by a background regional Global Atmospheric Watch (GAW) {{station on the}} island of Gozo. The mean annual maximum mixing ratio is of the order of 66 ppbv in April–May with a broad secondary maximum of 64 ppbv in July–September. No long-term increase or decrease in the background level of surface ozone could be observed over the last 10 years. This is contrary to observations made in the Eastern Mediterranean, where a slow decrease in the background ozone mixing ratio was observed over the past 7 years. Despite the very high average annual ozone mixing ratio exceeding 50 ppbv—in fact, the highest average background ozone mixing ratio ever measured in Europe—, the diurnal O 3 max/O 3 min index of < 1. 40 indicates that the island of Gozo is a good site for measuring background surface ozone. However, frequent <b>photosmog</b> events from June to September during the past 10 years with ozone mixing ratios exceeding 90 ppbv indicate that the Central Mediterranean is prone to long-range transport of air pollutants from Europe by northerly winds. This was particularly evident during the so-called “August heatwave” of the year 2003 when the overall ozone mixing ratio was 4. 6 ppbv higher than the average of all other 9 months of August since 1997. Air mass back-trajectory analysis of the August 2003 <b>photosmog</b> episodes on Gozo confirmed that ozone pollution originated from the European continent. Regression analysis was used to analyse the 10 -year data set in order to model the behaviour of the ozone mixing ratio in terms of the meteorological parameters of wind speed, relative humidity, global radiation, temperature, month of year, wind sector, atmospheric pressure, and time of day (predictors). Most of these predictors were found to significantly affect the ozone mixing ratios. From March to November, the monthly average of the AOT 40 threshold value for the protection of crops and vegetation against ozone was constantly exceeded on Gozo during the past 10 years. peer-reviewe...|$|E

40|$|Although {{biogenic}} compounds like isoprene and terpenes {{constitute a}} significant portion of the organic compounds released, the influence of biogenic hydrocarbons on the formation of ozone and photooxidants remains still uncertain. In order to simulate the photochemical behaviour of these compounds a smog chamber facility was designed and tested. The smog chamber is equipped with a solar simulator with matched tropospheric uv spectrac distribution with up to threefold intensity. The chamber is thermostated in order to achieve long enclosure times of aerosols for future investigations. Using a cryogenic enrichment technique the decay of the hydrocarbons (up to 20 compounds simultaneously) is monitored in the ppb level by gas chromatography. Reactions with the active species, O 3 and OH, are investigated either in the dark or in the irradiated chamber: In dark experiments low concentrations of O 3 are produced by uv photolysis of O 2 using a mercury pen ray lamp in an external photoreactor.

40|$|The {{heterogeneous}} photodegradation {{of organic}} compounds adsorbed on various sands or on silica gel {{has been investigated}} previously in the bulk in static or rotating drum photoreactors. Since {{it is not possible}} to monitor or to control the active species of such degradation reactions we decided to construct a smog chamber optimized for long residence times of airborne aerosols. This facility enables us to monitor OH and O 3 and other active species of the <b>photosmog</b> and to get insight into the mechanism of heterogeneous photodegradation of chemicals in the atmosphere. The decay of di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate, adsorbed as a monolayer on SiO 2 aerosol (Aerosil 200), is correlated with the concentration of OH in the smog chamber. The decay can be monitored down to the 1 % level and it is observed to obey second order kinetics, proportional to OH and to the compound itself.

At the conception of the projects these selected groups were classes of VOC or intermediates for which the atmospheric oxidation mechanisms were either poorly characterised or totally unknown. The motivation for these studies was the attainment of significant improvements {{in our understanding of}} the atmospheric chemical oxidation processes of these compounds, particularly with respect to their involvement in photooxidant formation in the troposphere.

40|$|An aerosol {{smog chamber}} {{facility}} is described, {{which is used}} to simulate the atmospheric, abiotic degradation of gaseous chemicals in the presence and absence of airborne aerosols, and also to simulate the degradation of condensed chemicals adsorbed on the aerosols. The aerosol materials SiO 2, Fe 2 O 3, coal fly ash and NaCl are investigated in a <b>photosmog</b> of sun-irradiated No sub x/hydrocarbon mixtures at the ppb level. The production of OH radicals (and Cl atoms in the presence of NaCl) in the gas-phase are computed from the degradation pattern of the hydrocarbons, and a heterogeneous degradation of hydrocarbons on the surfaces of irradiated TiO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 is detected. The kinetics for the consumption of a monolayer of the organic compound di (2 -ethylhexyl) -phthalate on SiO 2 and Fe 2 O 3 by reaction with gas-phase OH is studied in detail.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{analysed}} the ozone time series {{data collected by}} the local monitoring network in the Naples urban area (southern Italy) during the spring/summer period of 1996. Our aim was to identify a reliable and effective model {{that could be used}} for the real-time forecasting of <b>photosmog</b> episodes. We studied the applicability of seasonal autoregressive integrated moving average models with some exogenous variables (ARIMAX) to our case study. The choice of exogenous variables - temperature, [NO 2]/[NO] ratio and wind speed - was based on physical reasoning. The forecasting performance of all models was evaluated with data not used in model development, by means of an array of statistical indices: the comparison between observed and forecast means and standard deviations; intercept and slope of a least squares regression of forecast variable on observed variable; mean absolute and root mean square errors; and 95 % confidence limits of forecast variable. The assessment of all models was also based on their tendency to forecast critical episodes. It was found that the model using information from the temperature data set to predict peak ozone levels gives satisfactory results, about 70 % of critical episodes being correctly predicted by the 24 h ahead forecast function...|$|E
40|$|A {{compact and}} simple {{instrument}} for the sensitive detection of NO 2 {{in the atmosphere}} has been developed. NO 2 is sampled in a stripping coil by a selective chemical reaction, converted into a highly absorbing dye, which is detected by long path absorption in a liquid core waveguide. Several interferences were quantified in the laboratory which so far can all be neglected. The significant interferences against HONO and O 3 were suppressed by using an upstream HONO/O 3 -scrubber. The instrument has a detection limit of 2 pptv, an accuracy of 10 % and a precision of 0. 5 % for 3 min time resolution. Thus, the new NO 2 -LOPAP technique is more sensitive than known commercial NO 2 instruments. The new analyzer is much simpler to apply than other highly sensitive and selective NO 2 methods, e. g. LIF or REMPI methods. The new instrument allows an absolute calibration {{that can be easily}} performed with liquid nitrite standards, which is a significant advantage compared with other NO 2 measurement techniques for which NO 2 calibration gas mixtures are typically necessary. The new instrument has been validated against the chemiluminescence technique during an urban field campaign and against the FTIR technique in a smog chamber under complex <b>photosmog</b> conditions. The data sets exhibit high correlation and excellent agreement...|$|E
40|$|The time {{resolved}} {{chemical composition}} of aerosol particles, {{formed by the}} oxidation of alpha-pinene has been investigated by liquid chromatography/mass spectrometry (LC-MS) using negative and positive ionisation methods (ESI(-) and APCI(+)). The experiments were performed at the EUPHORE facility in Valencia (Spain) under various experimental conditions, including dark ozone reactions, <b>photosmog</b> experiments with low NO x mixing ratios and reaction with OH radicals {{in the absence of}} NO x (H 2 O 2 -photolysis). Particles were sampled on PTFE f ilters at different stages of the reaction and extracted with methanol. The predominant products from alpha-pinene in the particulate phase are cis-pinic acid, cis-pinonic acid and hydroxy-pinonic acid isomers. Another major compound with molecular weight 172 was detected, possibly a hydroxy-carboxylic acid. These major compounds account for 50 % to 80 % of the identified aerosol products, depending on the time of sampling and type of experiment. In addition, more than 20 different products have been detected and structures have been tentatively assigned based on their molecular weight and responses to the different ionisation modes. The different experiments performed showed that the aerosol formation is mainly caused by the ozonolysis reaction. The highest aerosol yields were observed in the dark ozone experiments, for which also the highest ratios of mass of identified products to the formed aerosol mass were found (30 % to 50 %, assuming a density of 1 g cm - 3) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{smog chamber}} for the {{simulation}} of tropospheric chemistry {{in the presence}} of aerosols was installed. Thermostating of lid and bottom of the cylindrical, vertically arranged vessel of 2. 4 cubic meters volume facilitates aerosol residence times of 1 day {{in the presence of}} simulated sunlight, and of 2 days in the dark. At initial mass concentrations up to 3 mg mE- 3, the aerosols SiO 2, TiO 2, Fe 2 O 3, coal fly ash and NaCl are investigated in a <b>photosmog</b> of NOx and hydrocarbons. SiO 2 and fly ash show inert behaviour. The rate constants of OH, observed in the presence of these aerosols, agree well with literature values. In the smog chamber (and in a further 0. 5 cubic meter chamber) rate constants for further compounds are determined for the first time, among them the n-alkanes up to n-hexadecane. In the presence of TiO 2, at 2 mg mE- 3, concentrations of OH enhanced by one order of magnitude are observed, reaching levels of 10 E 8 cm E- 3. In addition, a heterogeneous photodegradation occurs wi th an intensity inversely proportional to the vapour pressure of the hydracarbons: for compounds, less volatile than n-hexane, the heterogeneous photo-degradation surpasses the reaction with OH in the gas phase. A similar, possibly vapour pressure-dependent photodegradation is detected with low volatile aromatics in the presence of Fe 2 O 3. In the presence of NaCl aerosol, Cl atoms are formed, competing and surpassing the contribution of OH to the consumption of alkanes after a few hours. (ITA...|$|E

During ESCOMPTE, measurements have been performed at numerous surface stations, by radars and lidars, and several aircraft in the planetary boundary layer. The data from these different sources have been merged to obtain a consistent description of the spatial distribution of wind, temperature, humidity, and ozone for the <b>photosmog</b> episode on June 25, 2001 (IOP 2 b). On this day, moderate synoptic winds favour the evolution of different mesoscale circulation systems. During daytime, the sea breeze penetrates towards the north in the Rhône valley. As the winds above the sea breeze layer come from the east, polluted air from the metropolitan area of Marseille leads to an increase of ozone at elevated layers above the convective boundary layer (CBL). At the mountainous station of Luberon about 55 km north of Marseille around noon, when the CBL top surpasses {{the height of the}} mountain summit, polluted air with ozone concentrations of about 120 ppbv arrived from southerly directions, thus indicating the passage of the city plume of Marseille. At Cadarache and Vinon in the Durance valley, about 60 km inland, the ozone maximum at the surface and at flight level 920 m MSL appears between 14 and 15 UTC. At this time, southwesterly valley winds prevail in the valley, while southerly winds occur above. This finding highlights the height-dependent advection of ozone due to interacting mesoscale circulation systems.
