5|$|Alternating current, {{commonly}} used when welding aluminum and magnesium manually or semi-automatically, combines the two direct currents {{by making the}} electrode and base material alternate between positive and negative charge. This causes the electron flow to switch directions constantly, preventing the tungsten electrode from overheating while maintaining the heat in the base material. Surface oxides are still removed during the electrode-positive portion of the cycle and the base metal is heated more deeply during the electrode-negative portion of the cycle. Some power supplies enable operators to use an unbalanced alternating current wave by modifying the exact percentage of time that the current spends in each state of polarity, giving them {{more control over the}} amount of heat and cleaning action supplied by the power source. In addition, operators must be wary of rectification, in which the arc fails to reignite as it passes from straight polarity (negative electrode) to reverse polarity (<b>positive</b> <b>electrode).</b> To remedy the problem, a square wave power supply can be used, as can high-frequency voltage to encourage ignition.|$|E
25|$|Recently some {{asymmetric}} hybrid supercapacitors {{were developed in}} which the <b>positive</b> <b>electrode</b> {{were based on a}} real pseudocapacitive metal oxide electrode (not a composite electrode), and the negative electrode on an EDLC activated carbon electrode.|$|E
25|$|Electrodeionization: Water {{is passed}} between a <b>positive</b> <b>electrode</b> and a {{negative}} electrode. Ion exchange membranes allow only positive ions to migrate from the treated water toward the negative electrode and only negative ions toward the <b>positive</b> <b>electrode.</b> High purity deionized water is produced continuously, similar to ion exchange treatment. Complete removal of ions from water is possible {{if the right}} conditions are met. The water is normally pre-treated with a reverse osmosis unit to remove non-ionic organic contaminants, and with gas transfer membranes to remove carbon dioxide. A water recovery of 99% is possible if the concentrate stream is fed to the RO inlet.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. CoO {{was usually}} {{added to the}} <b>positive</b> <b>electrodes</b> of MH/Ni {{batteries}} as the conductive agent. In this paper, well crystallized multi-walled carbon nanotubes (CNTs) with diameter about 10 nm {{were added to the}} <b>positive</b> <b>electrodes</b> of MH/Ni batteries together with CoO. During the process of transformation from CoO to CoOOH, a complex conductive network was created with CNTs as the frame. Because of the high conductivity and the excellent tension characteristics of CNTs, the charge-transfer capability of the electrode was improved and the integrality of the complex conductive network was enhanced. The electrochemical measurements indicated that the impedance of the electrode with CNT-CoO complex conductive agent was lessened compared to the electrode with simple CoO agent. Performance tests of the sealed batteries showed that the <b>positive</b> <b>electrodes</b> with CNT-CoO complex conductive agent exhibited higher discharge voltage, improved capacity, modified discharge stability and prolonged lifespan, especially at high current rates...|$|R

25|$|In 1832, Michael Faraday's {{experiments}} led him {{to state}} his two laws of electrochemistry.

25|$|The {{electrolyte}} {{forms an}} ionic conductive {{connection between the}} two electrodes which distinguishes them from conventional electrolytic capacitors where a dielectric layer always exists, and the so-called electrolyte (e.g. MnO2 or conducting polymer) is in fact part of the second electrode (the cathode, or more correctly the <b>positive</b> <b>electrode).</b> Supercapacitors are polarized by design with asymmetric electrodes, or, for symmetric electrodes, by a potential applied during manufacture.|$|E
25|$|The UltraBattery is {{a hybrid}} {{rechargeable}} lead-acid battery and a supercapacitor invented by Australia's national science organisation CSIRO. Its cell construction contains a standard lead-acid battery <b>positive</b> <b>electrode,</b> standard sulphuric acid electrolyte and a specially prepared negative carbon-based electrode that store electrical energy with double-layer capacitance. The presence of the supercapacitor electrode alters the chemistry of the battery and affords it significant protection from sulfation in high rate partial state if charge use, which is the typical failure mode of valve regulated lead-acid cells used this way. The resulting cell performs with characteristics beyond either a lead-acid cell or a supercapacitor, with charge and discharge rates, cycle life, efficiency and performance all enhanced. UltraBattery has been installed in kW and MW scale applications in Australia, Japan and the U.S.A. in frequency regulation, solar smoothing and shifting, wind smoothing and other applications.|$|E

25|$|Batteries convert {{chemical}} energy directly to electrical energy. A battery consists of some number of voltaic cells. Each cell {{consists of two}} half-cells connected in series by a conductive electrolyte containing anions and cations. One half-cell includes electrolyte and the negative electrode, the electrode to which anions (negatively charged ions) migrate; the other half-cell includes electrolyte and the <b>positive</b> <b>electrode</b> to which cations (positively charged ions) migrate. Redox reactions power the battery. Cations are reduced (electrons are added) at the cathode during charging, while anions are oxidized (electrons are removed) at the anode during charging. During discharge, the process is reversed. The electrodes do not touch each other, but are electrically connected by the electrolyte. Some cells use different electrolytes for each half-cell. A separator allows ions to flow between half-cells, but prevents mixing of the electrolytes.|$|E
500|$|The {{potential}} difference and subsequent electric field pull the bound electrons (negative) toward the anode (<b>positive</b> <b>electrode)</b> while the cathode (negative electrode) pulls the nucleus. As the voltage increases, the current stresses the material (by electric polarization) beyond its dielectric limit (termed strength) into {{a stage of}} electrical breakdown, marked by an electric spark, where the material transforms from being an insulator into a conductor (as it becomes increasingly ionized). The underlying process is the Townsend avalanche, where collisions between electrons and neutral gas atoms create more ions and electrons (as {{can be seen in}} the figure on the right). The first impact of an electron on an atom results in one ion and two electrons. Therefore, the number of charged particles increases rapidly (in the millions) only [...] "after about 20 successive sets of collisions", mainly due to a small mean free path (average distance travelled between collisions).|$|E
500|$|The {{required}} {{direction of}} current depended on {{the direction in which}} electric current was thought to flow in nerves in the human or animal body. [...] For motor functions, for instance, the flow was taken to be from the centre towards the muscles at the extremities, so artificial electrical stimulation needed {{to be in the same}} direction. [...] For sensory nerves, the opposite applied: flow was from the extremity to the centre, and the <b>positive</b> <b>electrode</b> would be applied to the extremity. [...] This principle was demonstrated by Bird in an experiment with a living frog. [...] A supply of frogs was usually on hand, as they were used in the frog galvanoscope. [...] The electromagnetic galvanometer was available at the time, but frogs' legs were still used by Bird because of their much greater sensitivity to small currents. [...] In the experiment, the frog's leg was almost completely severed from its body, leaving only the sciatic nerve connected, and electric current was then applied from the body to the leg. [...] Convulsions of the leg were seen when the muscle was stimulated. [...] Reversing the current, however, produced no movement of the muscle, merely croaks of pain from the frog. [...] In his lectures, Bird describes many experiments with a similar aim on human sensory organs. [...] In one experiment by Grapengiesser, for instance, electric current is passed through the subject's head from ear to ear, causing a sound to be hallucinated. [...] The ear connected to the positive terminal hears a louder sound than that connected to the negative.|$|E
