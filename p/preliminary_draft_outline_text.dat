40|$|Cryptosystems {{often take}} {{slightly}} different {{amounts of time}} to process different messages. With network-based cryptosystems, cryptographic tokens, and many other applications, attackers can measure {{the amount of time}} used to complete cryptographic operations. This abstract shows that timing channels can, and often do, leak key material. The attacks are particularly alarming because they often require only known ciphertext, work even if timing measurements are somewhat inaccurate, are computationally easy, and are difficult to detect. This <b>preliminary</b> <b>draft</b> <b>outlines</b> attacks that can find secret exponents in Diffie-Hellman key exchange, factor RSA keys, and find DSS secret parameters. Other symmetric and asymmetric cryptographic functions are also at risk. A complete [...] ...|$|R
