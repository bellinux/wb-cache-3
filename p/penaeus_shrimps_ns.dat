40|$|We {{compared}} the size selectivity of the intake screens at the P. H. Robinson generating station on Galveston Bay, Texas {{with that of}} a 3 -m otter trawl hauled in the intake waters and evaluated a means of predicting size selectivity of the intake screens. We did this for brown <b>shrimp</b> (<b>Penaeus</b> aztecus), white <b>shrimp</b> (<b>Penaeus</b> setiferus), gulf menhaden (Brevoortia patronus), bay anchovy (Anchoa mitchilli), sand seatrout (Cynoscion arenarius), and Atlantic croaker (Micropogonias undulatus). The trawl generally caught smaller individuals than the intake screens, with the relative frequency of catch by size gradually increasing to a peak at an indeterminate length of a species, then decreasing as its length increased. Conversely, the relative frequency of collection at the intake screens increased abruptly at a predictable threshold length. Above this threshold, catches decreased gradually, presumably because larger individuals were both less abundant and less susceptible to capture than smaller ones. Based on our results, we concluded that intake screens are a practical means of sampling fish populations and provide data that are as useful as trawl data for most fishery analysis...|$|R
30|$|Presently, people mainly raise black-tiger <b>shrimp</b> (<b>Penaeus</b> Monodon), {{although}} white-legged <b>shrimp</b> (<b>Penaeus</b> Vannamei) {{have also}} been raised recently. The latter type of shrimp was introduced in Central Vietnam in 2000 and permitted to be raised in the Mekong Delta only in 2008. Although they grow more quickly and have a higher yield, white-legged shrimp usually cause extreme pollution to shrimp ponds due to their higher waste excretion. Thanks to their high effectiveness in terms of high yield, although being previously {{claimed to be a}} potential cause of disease outbreak and harmful to other species, white-legged shrimp are under consideration for removal from the list of harmful species and considered as an appropriate species for commercial production.|$|R

40|$|Infectious hypodermal and hematopoietic {{necrosis}} virus (IHHNV) is {{a widely}} distributed single-stranded DNA parvovirus that {{has been responsible for}} major losses in wild and farmed penaeid shrimp populations on the northwestern Pacific coast of Mexico since the early 1990 ’s. IHHNV has been considered a slow-evolving, stable virus because shrimp populations in this region have recovered to pre-epizootic levels, and limited nucleotide variation has been found in a small number of IHHNV isolates studied from this region. To gain insight into IHHNV evolutionary and population dynamics, we analyzed IHHNV capsid protein gene sequences from 89 <b>Penaeus</b> <b>shrimp,</b> along with 14 previously published sequences. Using Bayesian coalescent approaches, we calculated a mean rate of nucleotide substitution for IHHNV that was unexpectedly high (1. 39610 24 substitutions/site/year) and comparable to that reported for RNA viruses. We found more genetic diversity than previously reported for IHHNV isolates and highly significant subdivision among the viral populations in Mexican waters. Past changes in effective number of infections that we infer from Bayesian skyline plots closely correspond to IHHNV epizootiological historical records. Given the high evolutionary rate and the observed regional isolation of IHHNV in shrimp populations in the Gulf of California, we suggest regular monitoring of wild and farmed shrimp and restriction of shrimp movement as preventative measures for future viral outbreaks...|$|R
