5|$|The tunnel reopened {{to service}} on September 24, 2007, with tunnel routes {{modified}} to group common destinations together. Stations were given new entrance signs, lighting fixtures, electronic <b>passenger</b> <b>information</b> <b>signs,</b> and restored paint. The peak bus-only restrictions on 3rd Avenue remained in {{place after the}} reopening, along with the skip-stop service that Metro implemented on the street. The tunnel was temporarily closed for nine days in December after a computer glitch disrupted the tunnel's new emergency-control system, which was repaired and replaced.|$|E
50|$|Trial runs were {{undertaken}} {{using the}} 373/2 sets {{on both the}} East and West Coast Main Lines and <b>passenger</b> <b>information</b> <b>signs</b> and Eurostar lounges were installed at stations along the route. As the high-speed rail line between London and the Channel Tunnel, High Speed 1, was not under construction Eurostar services within the UK were forced to use existing rail lines and connecting junctions were built to allow Regional Eurostars access via the congested North London Line. In all British Rail invested £140 million in infrastructure to allow the services to operate.|$|E
5000|$|The NTT models utilize {{a common}} car design; {{stainless-steel}} car bodies {{with a black}} front fascia on the [...] "A" [...] (cab) cars, open lexan-glass windows on non-cab ends allowing passengers to see through to the next car, and electronic outer route signs, {{as opposed to the}} rollsigns used by previous models. Improvements to the conductors' interface include the addition of speedometers as well as electronic consoles that monitor mechanical problems that may occur on the train. The cars feature a white fiberglass interior with blue-gray plastic bench seats both to combat vandalism, along with bright fluorescent lighting and LED interior <b>passenger</b> <b>information</b> <b>signs.</b> The bench-style seats, designed with lumbar supports, also replaced the unpopular bucket-style seats used on rolling stock built in the 1970s and '80s, which were both uncomfortable for passengers and hard to clean. The trains utilize an airbag suspension (replacing conventional springs) for a more comfortable ride, and employ regenerative braking which converts the energy from brake application into electricity that is fed back into the third rail.|$|E

40|$|Public {{transport}} {{operators are}} legally obliged to ensure {{equal access to}} transportation services. This includes equal access to information and communication related to those services. Deaf passengers mostly prefer to communicate in sign language. For this reason, {{the specific needs of}} deaf and hard-of-hearing passengers still are not adequately addressed – despite the tremendous efforts public transport operators have put in providing accessible communication services to their passengers. This article describes a novel approach to <b>passenger</b> <b>information</b> in <b>sign</b> language based on the automatic translation of natural (written) language text into sign language. This includes the use of a sign language avatar to display the information to deaf and hard-of-hearing passengers...|$|R
