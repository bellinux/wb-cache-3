At that time the only westerner to see the valley had been Younghusband. Now Mason began its survey using a <b>photo-theodolite</b> and stereographic techniques, laboriously collecting great quantities of data. His results, plotted in Switzerland using what, at the time, was the world's most advanced Stereoplotter, were acclaimed as brilliantly successful, winning him the award of the 1927 Royal Geographic Society's Founder's Gold Medal.|$|E
40|$|Industrial {{surveying}} and photogrammetry {{are being}} increasingly {{applied to the}} measurement of engineering objects which have typical dimensions in the range 2 - 100 metres. Both techniques are examples {{of the principle of}} triangulation. By applying photocrammetric concepts to surveying methods and vice-versa, a general approach is established which has a number of advantages. In particular. alternative strategies for constructing and analysing measurement networks are developed. These should help to strengthen the geometry and simplify the analysis. The primary results concern the use of non-levelled theodolites, which have applications on board floating objects, and three new suggestions for controlling and computing relative orientations in photogrammetry. These involve reciprocal observations with theodolites. the photographing of linear scales defined by three target points and employing cameras which have been levelled. As a secondary result, some consideration Is given to automation, and instrument design. It is suggested that polarimetry could be successfully applied to improve the transfer of orientation in confined situations, such as in mining. In addition, the potential use of electronic cameras as <b>photo-theodolites</b> is discussed...|$|R
40|$|A {{series of}} flight tests were {{performed}} to evaluate the vortex wake characteristics of a Boeing 727 (B 727 - 200) aircraft during conventional and two-segment ILS approaches. Flights of the B 727, equipped with smoke generators for vortex marking, were flown wherein its vortex wake was intentionally encountered by a Lear Jet model 23 (LR- 23) or a Piper Twin Comanche (Pa- 30); and its vortex location during landing approach was measured using a system of <b>photo-theodolites.</b> The tests showed that at a given separation distance {{there were no differences}} in the upsets resulting from deliberate vortex encounters during the two types of approaches. Timed mappings of the position of the landing configuration vortices showed that they tended to descend approximately 91 meters (300 feet) below the flight path of the B 727. The flaps of the B 727 have a dominant effect on the character of the trailed wake vortex. The clean wing produces a strong, concentrated vortex. As the flaps are lowered, the vortex system becomes more diffuse. Pilot opinion and roll acceleration data indicate that 4. 5 nautical miles would be a minimum separation distance at which roll control could be maintained during parallel encounters of the B 727 's landing configuration wake by small aircraft...|$|R

50|$|The glaciers of Georgia {{are mainly}} located along the Greater Caucasus Mountain Range.The spatial {{distribution}} of contemporary glaciers in the territory of Georgia is stipulated by the peculiarities of atmospheric processes, morphological-morphometric conditions of the relief and their interaction. Main centers of glaciation {{are related to the}} elevated Greater Caucasus watershed range and Kazbegi massif. Individual centers {{can be found in the}} Greater Caucasus branch ranges: Bzipi, Kodori, Samegrelo, Svaneti, Lechkhumi, Pirikita, etc. According to the data of 2015 there are 637 glaciers in Georgia with a total area of 355.80 km2. Contemporary glaciers are mainly concentrated in the Enguri, Rioni, Kodori and Tergi River basins, where there are the peaks of 4500 m and higher. 89.32% of the amount and 97.15% of the area of glaciers of Georgia are located in these basins. Contemporary glaciers are unevenly distributed between the different river basins. Here the leading place belongs to the Enguri River basin; 42.22% of the total number of the glaciers of Georgia is the share of it, as well as 62.78% of the total area of the glaciers of Georgia is a share of the Enguri River basin. Except the Enguri River basin the shares of the other river basins in the total number of the glaciers of Georgia are distributed as follows: the Kodori River basin - 22.76%; the Rioni River basin - 15.22%; the Tergi River basin - 9.10%; the Pirikita Alazani River basin - 3.19%; the Bzipi River basin - 2.82%; the Liakhvi River basin - 1.56% and the Khobistskali River basin - 1.41%. As for the basins of the rivers of Arghuni, Asa, Aragvi and Kelasuri, their joint share is 1.72% of the total number of the glaciers of Georgia. Except the Enguri River basin the shares of the other river basins in the total area of the glaciers of Georgia are distributed as follows: the Rioni River basin - 13.11%; the Kodori River basin - 11.25%; the Tergi River basin - 9.99%; the Bzipi River basin - 1.12%; the Pirikita Alazani River basin - 0.68%. As for the basins of the rivers of Liakhvi, Asa, Khobistskali, Arghuni, Aragvi and Kelasuri, their joint share is 1.07% of the total area of the glaciers of Georgia. Great Georgian scientist Vakhushti Bagrationi gives the first scientific information on the glaciers of Georgia in the beginning of the 18th century. are big mountains, which have the Caucasus to the North from the Black Sea to the Caspian Sea, the height of which is of one day walking and the highest of it is permanently frosty, the length of the ice is of k-l arm, and in summer it breaks and, if a man stays there, he cannot endure the cold even for a little time; and under it the rivers flow, and the ice is green and red, as a rock due to its age‚Äù. After almost hundred years the foreign scientists began to describe the glaciers of Georgia. Information about the glaciers of Georgia can be found in the works of G. Abikh (1865), G. Radde (1873), N. Dinik (1884), I. Rashevskii (1904), etc. This information is related to the individual glaciers and mostly is of descriptive nature. However, their findings greatly assist us in determining the dynamics of the individual glaciers. In the years of 1880-1910 the topographical surveying of the Greater Caucasus was carried out. On the basis of the created maps K. I. Podozerskiy (1911) compiled the first detailed catalogue of the glaciers, which still has not lost its importance, but it must be mentioned, that the errors were made during its compilation. A. L. Reinhardt (1916, 1917) noted these errors further, who compiled the new catalogue for many glacial basins of the investigated region and defined the location of the snow line. The research conducted by A. Reinhardt is of high quality and more reliable by its scientific value in comparison with its previous researchers. Interesting researches were conducted by F. Rutkovskaia (1936) in connection with the 2nd International Polar Year. In 1932-1933 the glaciations of the Enguri River was studied and the dynamics (in the one-year period) of the individual glaciers were identified. In 1959 P. A. Ivankov gave us the total number and area of glaciers of the study area based on the new topographic maps and the aeroimages of 1946. In the same year P. Kovalev (1961) described in details the glaciers and carried out their labeling. Much work has been conducted by D. Tsereteli for the study of the glaciers of Georgia, who in 1937 together with Al. Aslanikashvili surveyed several glaciers and in 1963 gave us the dynamics of the glaciers during the period of 1937-1960. Particularly should be mentioned the great and versatile work, which was done by the Glaciological Laboratory of Vakhushti Bagrationi Institute of Geography, the multiannual work of which is summarized in the 1975 year‚Äôs edition of the Catalogue of Glaciers, as well as by the Hydrographical Division of the Hydro-Meteorological Department, which published the work about the Glaciers of the Greater Caucasus (Editors: V. Tsomaia and E. Drobishev, 1970). It should be also noted the many years research of various glaciers in the major river basins by R. Gobejishvili. It can be considered his honor that after the 1990s the glaciological studies have not been stopped in Georgia. L. Maruashvili, D. Ukleba. T. Kikalishvili, G. Kurdghelaidze, D. Tabidze, R. Khazaradze, O. Nikolaishvili, V. Tsomaia, O. Drobishevi, R. Shengelia, R. Gobejishvili, K. Mgeladze, T. Lashkhi, Sh. Inashvili, N. Golodovskaia, L. Serebryannii, A. Orlov, O. Nadirashvili, N. Zakarashvili, A. Rekhviashvili, O. Samadbegishvili and others studied the glaciers of Georgia according to the river basins. Glacial-geomorphological works were being carried out from 1968 (R. Gobejishvili). The largest glaciers of the different river basins were surveyed by the <b>photo-theodolite</b> method, such as: Zopkhito-Laboda, Kirtisho, Brili, Chasakhtomi, Edena, Khvargula, Boko, Buba, Tbilisa, Adishi, Chalaati, Dolra, Kvishi, Ladevali, Shkhara, Namkvani, Koruldashi, Marukhi, Klichi and the cirque type glaciers of the Klichi basin. Today in Georgia the Vakhushti Bagrationi Institute of Geography is the only institution, which scientifically researches the Caucasus glaciers. Glaciological group, by the leadership of Levan Tielidze, every year conducts glaciological expeditions to the Caucasus glaciers in the different river basins.|$|E

The trajectory reconstruction utilized an anchor epoch of GMT corresponding to an initial altitude of h 356 kft, selected {{in view of}} the limited tracking coverage available. The final state utilized IMU 2 measurements and was based on processing radar tracking from six C-bands and a single S-band station, plus six <b>photo-theodolite</b> cameras in the vicinity of Runway 17 at Edwards Air Force Base. The final atmosphere (FLAIR 9 /UN= 581199 C) was based on a composite of the remote measured data and the 1978 Air Force Reference Atmosphere model. The Extended BET is available as STS 9 BET/UN= 274885 C. The AEROBET and MMLE input files created are discussed.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{retrieval}} of vanishing points in uncalibrated images. Many authors did work on that subject in the computer vision field because the vanishing point represents a major information. In our case, starting with this information gives {{the orientation of the}} images {{at the time of the}} acquisition or the classification of the different directions of parallel lines from an unique view. The goal of this paper is to propose a simple and robust geometry embedded into a larger frame of image work starting with an efficient vanishing point extraction without any prior information about the scene and any knowledge of intrinsic parameters of the optics used. After this fully automatic classification of all segments belonging to the same vanishing point, the error analysis of the vanishing points found gives the covariance matrix on the vanishing point and on the orientation angles of the camera, when using the fact that the 3 D directions of lines corresponding to the vanishing points are horizontal or vertical. A validation of estimated parameters with the help of the <b>photo-theodolite</b> has been experimented that demonstrate the interest of the method for real case. The algorithm has been tested on the database of a set of 100 images available on line. 1...|$|E
40|$|Stereoscopic terrain models, {{constructed}} from photographs, {{have been in}} use for more than 100 years. They {{formed the basis for}} compilation of contour lines in topographic maps. This is likely to continue in the era of digital technologies. So the investigation of metric features of a digital stereoscopic model is valuable for the modern photogrammetry. We should also note that the widely used automatic stereoscopic measurements will be always rationally integrated with visual human-assisted measurements. Investigations in this area are conducted at the Laboratory of Aerospace Methods of Lomonosov Moscow State University in two directions: study of the influence of discretization on the formation of stereoscopic model; and study of influence of different factors on the accuracy of stereoscopic model measurements. The first direction implies research of discrete stereomodel formation at micro-level, namely the investigation of the influence of images pixel structure on geometric properties of the stereomodel. The main method used here is the construction of graphic stereogramms for different positions of an image in relation to the pixel matrix and their stereoscopic observations for control. Experiments have shown that pixel discretization of images may lead to horizontal and vertical distortion of stereomodel‚Äôs points for up to 1 - 2 pixels. The second direction includes experimental investigations of digital stereomodel metric properties by computer measurements of a real pair of stereo pictures (<b>photo-theodolite</b> images), digitized with different pixel sizes. The influence of various factors on the accuracy of visual computer measurements of a digital stereomodel has been experimentally investigated. The factors are the pixe...|$|E
