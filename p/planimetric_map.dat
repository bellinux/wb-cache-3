40|$|We {{present a}} {{mathematical}} model for a UAV-based, multi-sensor data integration. As a background, we first discuss the design and {{the implementation of a}} low-cost civilian UAV system, including its field flight validation, system calibration, and mapping accuracy evaluation. Then, this photogrammetry-based mathematical model is developed. The field flight tests demonstrate that the designed low-cost UAV is capable of collecting clear and high-resolution video. The UAV can be controlled and navigated remotely and video stream and navigation data strings, including position and attitude, can be downlinked to the ground control station in real-time. The present multi-sensor, mathematical model reveal that the boresight matrix in a low-cost UAV system does not remain constant. This contradicts the practice in traditional airborne mapping systems where the boresight matrix is assumed to be a constant over an entire mission. Thus, to achieve a high-accurate mapping, EOPs of each video frame in a low-cost UAV mapping system have to be estimated.

This paper focuses on the implementation of photogrammetry program mapping of index maps for the registration system being developed for Albania. Photogrammetric work occupies an important place among the well-known methods of mapping. Methods for various types of map production based on aerial information are being developed. Analytical photogrammetry is completed theoretically, on an advanced technological base and with hands-on experience in all phases. At present, photogrammetry and remote sensing is changing from analog to digital, from aerial to space-based imaging/mapping, from local to global concepts, and from manually managed to computerized information systems such as the geographic information system. It is not always possible for technology to change from the old to the new. This depends on economic and financial possibilities, on existing technological bases, and, more importantly, on efficiency of the new technology to resolve the problem. In a lot of cases, analogical equipment has been adapted using various types of alterations in order to process as much information as possible and gradually to pass on to higher levels of technology.

Urban and rural areas are viewed as large complex heterogeneous systems that include buildings, road and water networks, bridges, man-made features, natural elements such as agricultural land, water bodies, shorelines, …etc. All these objects are spatially distributed within a certain geographical extent and have to be associated and linked with a larger external world. Moreover, because of continuous development, expansion, up-grading, and other circumstances, the spatial locations and physical conditions of natural and man-made features can change.

40|$|Abstract__ This article {{engages the}} {{narrative}} of fragmentation in international law by asserting that legal academics and professionals have failed to probe more deeply into ‘fragmentation’ as a concept and, more specifically, as a spatial metaphor. The contention here is that however central fragmentation has been to analyses of contemporary international law, this notion has been conceptually assumed, ahistorically accepted and philosophically under-examined. The ‘fragment’ metaphor is tied historically to a cartographic rationality – and thus ‘reality’ – of all social space being reducible to a geometric object and, correspondingly, a <b>planimetric</b> <b>map.</b> The {{purpose of this article}} is to generate an appreciation among international lawyers that the problem of ‘fragmentation’ is more deeply rooted in epistemology and conceptual history. This requires an explanation of how the conflation of social space with planimetric reduction came to be constructed historically and used politically, and how that model informs representations of legal practices and perceptions of ‘international legal order’ as an inherently absolute and geometric. This implies the need to dig up and expose background assumptions that have been working to precondition a ‘fragmented’ characterization of worldly space. With the metaphor of ‘digging’ in mind, I draw upon Michel Foucault’s ‘archaeology of knowledge’ and, specifically, his assertion that epochal ideas are grounded by layers of ‘obscure knowledge’ that initially seem unrelated to a discourse. In the case of the fragmentation narrative, I argue obscure but key layers can be found in the Cartesian paradigm of space as a geometric object and the modern States’ imperative to assert (geographic) jurisdiction. To support this claim, I attempt to excavate the fragment metaphor by discussing key developments that led to the production and projection of geometric and planimetric reality since the 16 th century...|$|E

Until the 1960 s, maps were made the time-honored, {{traditional}} way: Draw an original map by hand, based on land survey measurements and other information. Print as many copies as you need. That change {{with the advent of}} computers, satellite imagery, and Global Positioning System (GPS), made making maps much easier. Most paper maps now are generated or produced on a computer. Now a day, GPS become one of the important tools of map data collection. It preserves time, reduces cost, provides reliable accuracy, digital data transferring and manipulation, more over data can be collected at any time. Survey GPS receiver provides high accuracy compared with hand-held one. At the same time, the later is the much cheaper and is usually used for navigation purposes. This research work is oriented to practically evaluate the field horizontal accuracy that can be obtained using the hand held GPS receiver. Results obtained, showed that the hand held GPS receiver can practically provides horizontal accuracy of about 4 m.

Although Bagley’s team arrived in Europe too late to complete the planned trials under wartime conditions, the camera was evaluated after the Armistice to photograph sectors of the St-Mihel and Meuse-Argonne battlefields to assess its effectiveness for military reconnaissance. Bagley’s design was judged to be effective, although opinion favored the use of a longer focal length camera for military use (Air Service History, Vol. 13, p. 65).
