2500|$|In March 1962, the Dental Health Education and Research Foundation was {{established}} at the University of Sydney to promote the philosophy and practice of <b>preventive</b> <b>dentistry</b> and, in particular, communicate positive dental health messages to the general [...] population. Preliminary studies had convinced the Foundation that [...] "dental health literature of a hand-out nature was virtually useless unless {{it was used to}} supplement information or knowledge already passed on to the recipient by a dentist or some other authoritative person". Moreover, it was soon found that the presence of Dental Health Educators in primary schools, instructing children up to 12 years in such things as diet, oral hygiene and plaque control, was not as effective as anticipated.|$|E

The first performance — which, it had been decided by that time, would run [...] "in parallel with" [...] (rather than [...] "as part of") the dental health educator programme — was in February 1968, with the specific target of the younger, primary school children.|$|E

The incidence of osteomyelitis of the jaw has dramatically decreased since the introduction of antibiotics and <b>preventive</b> and restorative <b>dentistry.</b> Osteomyelitis of the maxilla is much less frequent than that of the mandible.

40|$|These two {{case reports}} {{highlight}} the enormous clin-ical difficulties faced by dentists in providing satis-factory long-term dental care {{to patients who}} suffer from Epidermolysis bullosa. Problems of bullae formation in oral soft tissues and subsequent scar-ring are outlined in relation to the difficulty of main-taining satisfactory oral hygiene and a diet leading to minimal dental caries experience. The behavioural problems of maintaining patient compliance for <b>preventive</b> and restorative <b>dentistry</b> in this painful and debilitating disease are illustrated in these case reports. Difficulties in providing restorative care, either under local anaesthesia or general anaes-thesia are discussed, and a novel replacement of non-viable carious anterior teeth using a nine-unit porcelain fused to metal Rochette type bridge is presented. Dental management of patients with Epidermolysis bullosa should commence at birth, and non-compliance in dental attendances should be followed up by social workers to prevent the disastrous oral morbidity that frequently occurs in such patients...|$|R
30|$|In vitro {{effect of}} 1 % {{theobromine}} addition {{on the physical}} and chemical properties of conventional glass ionomer (GIC) cement was investigated. Conventional GIC (GIC-C) and 1 % theobromine added to GIC (GIC-THEO) specimens were compared regarding the microhardness (n[*]=[*] 10), sorption (n[*]=[*] 5), solubility (n[*]=[*] 5), color change (n[*]=[*] 10), fluoride release in saliva (n[*]=[*] 10) and the amount of biofilm deposition (n[*]=[*] 20). Compared against conventional GIC, adding 1 % theobromine increased microhardness (p[*]<[*] 0.05), while its sorption, solubility, color and fluoride release to saliva (p[*]>[*] 0.05) remained unchanged. On the other hand, Streptococcus mutans biofilm amount deposited on its surface decreased statistically when theobromine was added to GIC (p[*]<[*] 0.05). Based on the results, it could be concluded that 1 % theobromine addition to GIC can be a good strategy as it keeps some of its properties and improves microhardness and biofilm deposits strengthening its role in the <b>preventive</b> approach of <b>dentistry.</b>|$|R
40|$|Solomon O NwhatorDepartment of <b>Preventive</b> and Community <b>Dentistry,</b> Obafemi Awolowo University, Ile-Ife, NigeriaAbstract: Advancements in {{restorative}} dentistry {{have resulted in}} people keeping their teeth for longer, {{and an increase in}} gingival recession as the gums recede due to age, periodontal disease, thin gingiva, or other factors. The demand for periodontal plastic surgery appears to be increasing. Several methods have been used in the treatment of denuded roots. Of these, the free gingival autograft, the coronally displaced flap, guided tissue regeneration, and, lately, the connective tissue graft appear to be the main methods employed. There are as yet no reports of periodontal plastic surgery performed in Nigeria. We report two cases of Miller&rsquo;s Class 2 gingival recession treated by free gingival autografts in the specialist periodontal clinic of a South-Western teaching hospital in Nigeria. The challenges of awareness, a dearth of expertise, cost of materials, consequent cost of treatment, and how these affect the accessing of treatment are highlighted. The methods used in getting over these hurdles to provide treatment are also discussed. Keywords: gingival recession, free gingival autograft, Nigeri...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: The {{purpose of}} this cross- {{sectional}} study was to evaluate the prevalence of dental caries in 15 year old high school students of Yazd. Methods: A total of 295 boy students with mean age of 15 years± 6 month in 2002 and 180 boy students in 2009 were selected randomly and after necessary examination, the obtained data was recorded and evaluated. Results: The over all mean DMFT was 4. 8 ± 3. 13 and 11. 5 % of the subjects(34 cases) were caries free. 4. 4 % of the population had DMFT> 10 and 6. 92 % of DMFT was due to extracted teeth. Meanwhile, 77. 5 % of the DMFT was due to decayed teeth. Also, the percentage of teeth with fillings was 15. 53 %.

40|$|Osteomyelitis of {{the jaws}} was {{relatively}} common before {{the era of}} antibiotic therapy and <b>preventive</b> and restorative <b>dentistry.</b> Osteomyelitis is an acute or chronic inflammatory process that can involve cortical and trabecular aspects of bone or bone marrow. Cranial bones are infrequently involved, but spreading of inflammation with involvement of surrounding structures represents important risk, such as cerebral abscess, encephalitis, or meningitis. The mandible is more commonly involved than the maxilla. Dentogenic infections cause 38 % of mandibular and 25 % of maxillary involvement. Involvement of zygoma is very rare. Factors like viral fevers, malnutrition, malaria, anemia,tobacco chewing, immunodeficiency, osteopetrosis, Paget’s disease of bone, and florid cemento-osseous dysplasia (FCOD) result in decreased vascularity of the affected bone, predisposing {{to the development of}} osteomyelitis. We present a case of osteomyelitis of left maxilla and zygoma with oroantral fistula in an immunocompetent adult male caused by dentogenic infection. The complete resolution of infection was gained with surgical treatment using nasal endoscope and antibiotic therapy. The aims of this paper are to illustrate diagnostic patterns, to report radiographic findings and surgical treatment using nasal endoscope in a case of osteomyelitis of maxilla and zygoma.

It includes {{a discussion of the}} social responses given by the Brazilian State to oral health policies and the relationship of these responses with the ideological oral health movements that have developed globally, and that have specifically influenced oral health policies in Brazil. The influence of these movements has affected a series of hegemonic practices originating from both Market <b>Dentistry</b> and <b>Preventive</b> and Social <b>Dentistry</b> in Brazil. Among the state activities that have been set into motion, the following stand out: the drafting of a law to regulate the fluoridation of the public water supply, and the fluoridation of commercial toothpaste in Brazil; epidemiological surveys to analyze the status of the Brazilian population's oral health; the inclusion of oral health in the Family Health Strategy (Estratégia de Saúde da Família - ESF); the drawing up of the National Oral Health Policy, Smiling Brazil (Brasil Sorridente). From the literature consulted, the progressive expansion of state intervention in oral health policies is observed. However, there remains a preponderance of hegemonic "dental" practices reproduced in the Unified Public Health Service (Sistema Único de Saúde - SUS) and the Family Health Strategy...|$|R
