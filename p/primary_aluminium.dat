40|$|Aluminium alloys {{have gained}} {{popularity}} in many industries {{due to their}} high strength and low weight. One shortcoming of aluminium alloys is their poor resistance to abrasion and erosion wear compared to materials such as stainless steels. In this project, aluminium alloy 2014 (AA 2014) was coated with a 1. 5 mm thick laser-deposited layer composed of silicon, copper, and aluminium {{with the aim of}} increasing the wear resistance. The amount of silicon, copper, and aluminium added to each sample was determined by a mixtures model. It was discovered that the Al-Cu system is very sensitive to silicon additions and that wear resistance depends on the primary phase to solidify {{as well as on the}} final phase distribution. Two primary phases were identified; alpha aluminium and theta intermetallic. It was observed that the clad layer increases both the hardness and wear resistance of AA 2014, and that the material solidifying as <b>primary</b> alpha <b>aluminium</b> displayed a lower hardness but higher wear resistance than the samples containing primary theta phase. All clad layers performed better in terms of wear resistance than the unclad samples. The knowledge gained and principles used in this project could be applied to many other aluminium alloys.

40|$|Summary. To verify whether {{aluminium}} phytotoxicity causes {{oxidative stress}} in developing greengram seedlings, {{the present investigation}} was carried out. An uniform decrease in root and shoot elongations was marked as the <b>primary</b> signs of <b>aluminium</b> injury. A significant increase in lipid peroxidation {{measured in terms of}} TBARS content was noticed which was also correlated with an increase in membrane injury index. The increase in peroxide content was accompanied by a decrease in catalase (CAT, EC 1. 11. 1. 6) activity. However, superoxide dismutase (SOD, EC 1. 15. 1. 9), peroxidase (POX, EC 1. 11. 1. 6) and glutathione reductase (GR, EC 1. 6. 4. 2) activities increased with increasing aluminium concentrations. Both glutathione and ascorbate contents showed a decrease at a higher metal concentration. These results suggested an induction of oxidative stress in developing greengram seedlings under aluminium phytotoxicity...|$|R
