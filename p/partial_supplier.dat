40|$|The public {{increasingly}} holds companies {{accountable for}} environmental misbehavior in their supply chains. To offset that risk corporations start initiatives to green their supply chains. Yet suppliers {{often fail to}} properly participate in these initiatives. This paper presents a conceptual framework to explain supplier participation in green initiatives, by investigating customer requirements, supplier readiness, relational norms and customer investment as possible drivers. The framework and hypotheses were tested using survey data of 54 German automotive <b>suppliers.</b> <b>Partial</b> least squares methodology was deployed for hypothesis testing. The study found supplier readiness and customer requirements to be significant drivers in supplier participation. Relational norms and customer investment did not per se yield significant importance for explaining supplier participation, but when taking into account firm size, the data suggests that cooperative relation norms and customer investment work as an additional driver in green supply chain management for larger suppliers. This research {{is one of the}} few studies that explore drivers for supply chain participation at the supplier's level...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{utilizes}} {{the decision}} tree approach {{to determine the}} optimal number of suppliers {{in the presence of}} supplier failure risks. Previous proposed models have considered only two states of nature: all suppliers fail to deliver and not all suppliers fail to deliver. In practice, however, there is clearly a partial loss associated with the failure of any individual supplier. We present models that allow a more realistic decision-making process by taking into consideration the independent risks of individual supplier failures when the probability of failure for each of the suppliers is equal as well as the case where the probability of failure from each of the suppliers is not equal. We also consider various levels of supplier failure probability and possible procurement or operating cost savings gained from using less reliable suppliers. The results indicate that when suppliers are highly reliable, sole sourcing is the lowest cost approach under all experimental conditions. However, as the suppliers become less reliable, additional suppliers may be required to obtain the lowest cost. Finally, it was shown that only in the extreme conditions of unreliable suppliers, high loss to operational cost per supplier, and low ability to mitigate the failure from a <b>partial</b> set of <b>suppliers,</b> having a large number of suppliers is an effective strategy.
