500|$|Gainey {{explained}} the changing {{fortunes of the}} franchise following their playoff defeat {{at the hands of}} the Nordiques in 1982: [...] "We can't <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> sweaters anymore and expect to win." [...] The Canadiens' mystique had been broken by consecutive playoff losses to the upstart Minnesota North Stars, the Oilers and the Nordiques. The loss to Quebec in 1982 was the culmination of a vicious series where the players attempted to hurt and intimidate their opponents, while the media argued over which team better represented francophone Quebec. Montreal's growing rivalry with Quebec peaked two years later in 1984 when they eliminated the Nordiques in six games, but not before the Good Friday Massacre made headlines. A hit by Quebec's Dale Hunter on Montreal goaltender Steve Penney sparked a bench-clearing brawl at the end of the second period. A second brawl, including some players who were ejected as a result of the first, erupted before the start of the third period. Ten players were ejected from the game, and 198 penalties in minutes were handed out as a result of the incidents, which proved a turning point in the game as Montreal scored five third period goals to win.|$|E

Several journalists noted {{the similarities between}} the song and other Gaga works, with Brad Wete of Entertainment Weekly stating that it sounded like [...] "a watered down version of 'Poker Face'" [...] and Scott Shetler of PopCrush elaborating that [...] "like many of [...] Gaga's songs", it is [...] "likely to stick in your head long after the song has ended". Allison Stewart from The Washington Post further expanded on this view, stating that [...] "without the slightest hint of noblesse oblige" [...] to Gaga, [...] "Hypnotico" [...] is a synthy, [...] "burbly slip" [...] of a song. Eliot Glazer of MTV Buzzworthy stated that the song seems to continue right where Lopez's 1999 hit single [...] "Waiting for Tonight" [...] left off, [...] "making us want to <b>put</b> <b>on</b> <b>our</b> short shorts and dance". In addition, he concluded that [...] "The thump that rides the song's undercurrent of ethereal echoes and a group chant of the chorus is a pretty solid reminder that this is most definitely a Gaga jam, which quickly gained J. Lo's approval". Amos Barshad of Vulture showcased his displeasure with the song, elaborating that although [...] "you can sort of tell" [...] that Gaga wrote the song, that was not an indication that it would become an instant hit, casting it as [...] "Bland and half-baked", and concluding that [...] "it was certainly farmed out for a reason".|$|E
