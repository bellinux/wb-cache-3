5|$|Following {{a similar}} form of play to Shogun: Total War, the player builds a dynastic empire in Europe, North Africa and the Middle East, {{spanning}} {{the period of}} 1087 to 1453. Gameplay is both strategic and tactical, with strategy <b>played</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> turn-based fashion on a province-by-province level, while military units of varying types and capabilities fight {{against each other in}} real time on a 3D battlefield.|$|E
5|$|Although lynchings and racially {{motivated}} murders {{had occurred}} throughout the South for decades, {{the circumstances surrounding}} Emmett Till's murder and the timing acted as a catalyst to attract national attention {{to the case of}} a 14-year-old boy who had allegedly been killed for breaching a social caste system. Till's murder aroused feelings about segregation, law enforcement, relations between the North and South, the social status quo in Mississippi, the activities of the NAACP and the White Citizens' Councils, and the Cold War, all of which were <b>played</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a drama staged in newspapers all over the U.S. and abroad.|$|E
5|$|As the {{sectional}} conflict {{leading up}} to the Civil War escalated, Breckinridge was put in the unusual position of being a slaveholder who opposed slavery. His support of Abraham Lincoln for president in the election of 1860 put him at odds with his nephew, John C. Breckinridge. The tragic scenario of brother against brother literally <b>played</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Breckinridge's family, with two of his sons joining each side during the war. Following the war, Breckinridge retired to his home in Danville, where he died on December 27, 1871.|$|E

5|$|Different factions {{may have}} {{existed in the}} royal court. The k'uhul ahaw and his {{household}} would have formed the central power-base, but other important groups were the priesthood, the warrior aristocracy, and other aristocratic courtiers. Where ruling councils existed, as at Chichen Itza and Copán, these may have formed an additional faction. Rivalry between different factions would have led to dynamic political institutions as compromises and disagreements were <b>played</b> <b>out.</b> <b>In</b> such a setting, public performance was vital. Such performances included ritual dances, presentation of war captives, offerings of tribute, human sacrifice, and religious ritual.|$|E
5|$|Kennedy decided {{toward the}} end of 1871 to end his {{business}} partnership with Eddy. She had accused him in front of others of cheating at cards; it was one of several scenes she had caused between them and he walked out on her. There was a temporary reconciliation, but he was unhappy about the abandonment of head rubbing, and after a dispute between Eddy and a student over a refund was <b>played</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the local press, he decided to go his own way.|$|E
5|$|Other {{multi-ethnic}} {{parts of}} Europe frequently found war memorials equally contentious. In Flanders, the IJzertoren, a controversial Flemish memorial tower, was opened in 1930, commemorating the sacrifices during the war, but also celebrating Flemish identity and marking the hard treatment of Flemish activists by the Belgian authorities during the conflict. In disputed multi-ethnic territories in the east, such as Transylvania, {{the war had}} created bitter memories between Hungarian and Romanian inhabitants. The arguments were <b>played</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> differences {{as to how the}} dates of the war-in which Hungary and Romania had entered and left at different times-were recorded on tombstones and other memorials. In Serbia, the Kosovo Maiden was extensively used in war memorials, drawing a link between the war and the Battle of Kosovo.|$|E

5|$|Overtime, {{traditional}} Calvinism played {{less of a}} role {{in shaping}} the church's doctrines and practices—it was influenced by Arminianism and revivalism early in the 19th century, liberal theology late in the 19th century, and neo-orthodoxy by the mid-20th century. The theological tensions within the denomination were <b>played</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the Fundamentalist–Modernist Controversy of the 1920s and 1930s, a conflict that {{led to the development of}} Christian fundamentalism and has historical importance to modern American Evangelicalism. Conservatives dissatisfied with liberal trends left to form the Orthodox Presbyterian Church in 1936.|$|E
5|$|The mill site in Billerica was {{not without}} some controversy. The dam, which had been {{constructed}} in the 1790s to provide water for the Middlesex Canal, was believed {{by some to be}} responsible for the flooding of fields upstream as far as Sudbury. There were calls to remove the dam, as well as legal action, which Talbot vigorously resisted. The dispute was partly <b>played</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> the state legislature, and brought Talbot to the attention of political leaders as a potential candidate for office. Talbot also opposed plans developed by the city of Boston to divert waters of the Sudbury River (a major tributary of the Concord River) for its water supply.|$|E
5|$|The {{game is a}} turn-based {{strategy}} and revolves around Battle of Austerlitz, in which the forces {{under the command of}} Napoleon must defend the Austrian village of Austerlitz from the invading Austro-Russian army, led by Tsar Alexander. In the game, the battle itself begins at 7am on 2 December 1805 and is <b>played</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> a series of turns. A turn lasts fifteen minutes and a total number of eight orders must be issued {{before the end of the}} turn. The player may choose either French or Russian forces to control throughout the game. In order to move a unit, the player must select them and point their the cursor over the desired location; however, movement is restricted within a turn. At the start of a movement phase, the player can issue a command to one of their units. Orders include move, attack, defend, shell, stay in reserve, retreat and report.|$|E

5|$|After the Romans left, Britain was {{invaded by}} Anglo-Saxon peoples. By AD 600 they had {{established}} control {{over much of}} what is now England, but Somerset was still in native British hands. The British held back Saxon advance into the south-west for some time longer, but by the early eighth century King Ine of Wessex had pushed the boundaries of the West Saxon kingdom far enough west to include Somerset. The Saxon royal palace in Cheddar was used several times in the 10th century to host the Witenagemot. After the Norman Conquest, the county was divided into 700 fiefs, and large areas were owned by the crown, with fortifications such as Dunster Castle used for control and defence. Somerset contains HM Prison Shepton Mallet, which was England's oldest prison still in use prior to its closure in 2013, having opened in 1610. In the English Civil War Somerset was largely Parliamentarian, with key engagements being the Sieges of Taunton and the Battle of Langport. In 1685 the Monmouth Rebellion was <b>played</b> <b>out</b> <b>in</b> Somerset and neighbouring Dorset. The rebels landed at Lyme Regis and travelled north, hoping to capture Bristol and Bath, but they were defeated in the Battle of Sedgemoor at Westonzoyland, the last pitched battle fought in England. Arthur Wellesley took his title, Duke of Wellington from the town of Wellington; he is commemorated on a nearby hill by a large, spotlit obelisk, known as the Wellington Monument.|$|E
