40|$|This paper explores and {{advances}} {{the debate surrounding}} online research ethics. The use of internet mediated research using online research methods has increased significantly in recent years raising the issue of online research ethics. Obviously, many ethical issues of onsite research are directly translatable to the online context, {{but there is also}} a need for existing ethical principles to be examined in the light of these new virtual research strategies. Five key issues of ethical conduct are commonly identified in the literature pertaining to online research ethics: informed consent, confidentiality, privacy, debriefing and netiquette. These are the issues that are most commonly discussed in <b>procedural</b> ethical <b>guidelines</b> for online research. However, this paper proposes that given the recent increased formal regulation and research governance over research ethics in many countries, it is important that discussion of such issues continues as an embedded part of professional self-regulation and <b>procedural</b> ethical <b>guidelines</b> are used as creative forums for reflexive debate rather than simply being routinely applied by bureaucratic ethics committees.

Furthermore, because the samples used in the pilot and in the large-scale assessment study comprise students from diverse academic backgrounds within a wide age range, this questionnaire is suitable for implementation in a variety of instructional situations and contexts. In addition, by allowing to collect data on various elements in a single application, this instrument is a time-efficient option even for studies with tight research agendas. However, more than present the science education research community with a novel quantitative measurement instrument, this work contributes with the definition of a <b>procedural</b> <b>guideline</b> for studies framed within the scope of quantitative assessment that {{can be applied to the}} improvement of the validity and reliability of the data collected in diverse evaluative settings. In this context, it must be mentioned that this study does not seek to produce a better or generally more suitable instrument than the biotechnology knowledge inventories and attitudes scales available in published research. Likewise, the validation procedure presented is not exclusive nor to be applied in every science education survey developmental study. The goal is to provide an insightful perspective on an efficient and easily available validation procedure that has wide applicability in quantitative research.

40|$|Background Severe {{hypothermia}} (SH, 30 °C) {{increases the}} risk of pacing-induced ventricular fibrillation (PIVF) by enhancing spatially discordant alternans (SDA). Whether moderate hypothermia (MH, 33 °C), which is clinically used for therapeutic hypothermia, also facilitates SDA remains unclear. We hypothesized that MH attenuates SDA occurrence compared with that achieved by SH, and decreases the susceptibility of PIVF. Methods Using an optical mapping system, action potential duration (APD) /conduction velocity restitutions and thresholds of APD alternans were determined by S 1 pacing in Langendorff-perfused isolated rabbit hearts. In the MH group (n = 7), S 1 pacing was performed at baseline (37 °C), after 5 -min MH, and after 5 -min rewarming (37 °C). In the SH group (n = 9), pacing was also performed at baseline (37 °C), after 5 -min SH, and after 5 -min rewarming (37 °C). The thresholds of APD alternans were defined as the longest S 1 pacing cycle length at which APD alternans were detected. Results Although the thresholds of APD alternans were not different between the MH (273 ± 46 ms) and the SH (300 ± 35 ms) (p = 0. 281) groups, SDA threshold was shorter (at a faster heart rate) during MH (228 ± 33 ms) than that during SH (289 ± 42 ms) (p = 0. 028). At APD alternans threshold, SH hearts showed more SDA than that during MH (SH: 7 hearts, MH: 2 hearts, p = 0. 049). SDA could be induced in all 9 SH hearts (100 %), while only 4 MH hearts (57 %) had SDA (p = 0. 029). The PIVF inducibility during SH (44 ± 53 %) was higher than that during MH (0 %) (p = 0. 043). Conclusions Compared with SH, the MH group showed greater attenuation of SDA and decreased the susceptibility of PIVF. Therefore, MH is safer as a <b>procedural</b> <b>guideline</b> for use in clinical therapeutic hypothermia than SH...|$|R

My review of the literature indicated few research studies examining how traditionally trained science teachers develop STEM-related understandings about the complex relationships between concepts associated with STEM-related contexts, such as those existing within the context of earthquake engineering. STEM researchers currently know little about how teachers develop deep conceptual understanding of complex and interdisciplinary content knowledge. To address the gap I found in the literature, I designed three studies to: (1) conduct a modified Delphi study to create a list of key concepts as a knowledge base in earthquake engineering, (2) examine changes in science teachers? conceptual understanding of earthquake engineering {{as a result of their}} participation to an engineering-oriented teacher professional development (EOTPD), and (3) investigate changes in the quality of science teachers? argumentation discourse after their participation in a week-long EOTPD. Researchers suggest identification of key concepts in critical engineering content areas for high school science teachers to increase their engineering content knowledge. In my first study, I identified and verified key concepts in earthquake engineering necessary for high school learners to acquire a basic understanding of earthquake engineering. Results included a key concepts list and an interdisciplinary strand map with 35 earthquake engineering key concepts in five domains. Furthermore, stakeholders suggest providing opportunities for STEM teachers to improve their conceptual understanding in critical engineering areas within EOTPDs. In my second study, I developed a conceptual framework, Meaningful Conceptual Learning, for successful conceptual understanding of complex and interdisciplinary content knowledge, implemented the framework into an EOTPD on earthquake engineering, used individual and group concept mapping as authentic assessment method. Results indicated science teachers enhanced their conceptual understanding of the earthquake engineering content knowledge after the EOTPD. Stakeholders in science education also emphasize the critical role of using argumentation discourse in teaching science and indicate most science teachers still lack the pedagogical skills to introduce and enhance students? argumentation discourse skills. In my third study, I implemented argumentation discourse with a <b>procedural</b> <b>guideline</b> involving EOTPD participants? reasons for the inclusion of various concepts in their concept maps.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel resistivity method called Multi-Electrode resistivity technique (MERIT) {{that is used}} for high resolution imaging of complex geologic features at depth and near the edges of survey lines. The MERIT electrodes are especially shaped and designed to be self-driven using a robust-direct push technique. Measurements are taken using optimized arrays that are generated using {{a modified version of}} the “Compare-R” optimization algorithm. This work focused on both two-dimensional (MERIT 2 D) and three-dimensional (MERIT 3 D) applications of the buried array and show the relevance of the additional information gained by the addition of deep electrodes especially in sites with limited survey area. Numerical and laboratory studies are used to test and develop the technique and are later applied to image complex subsurface geologic structures on the field. The configuration of MERIT arrays brings some additional problems in terms the sensitivity of the deep MERIT arrays to a problem of non-uniqueness, mis-information, geometric error and resolution break between the two layers of electrodes. Multiple vertical resolution characteristic curves (RC curves) are analyzed to study the effect of array type, resistivity contrast, target resistivity and implant depth on the above-mentioned problems. Results show that MERIT measurements taken using standard dipole -dipole and wenner arrays along the surface and deep electrodes will strongly suffer from the problem of non-uniqueness or ambiguity while measurements taken using optimized arrays is suitable for MERIT configuration and will not suffer from any problem of ambiguity or non-uniqueness. Based on our result, a <b>procedural</b> <b>guideline</b> is developed to determine optimal MERIT implant depth and resolution cutoff that can be used for successful field implementation and for controlling misinformation during data interpretation. Numerical studies involving simple shapes and complex geometries mostly based on actual geological cross-sections from karst environments were used to compare the effectiveness of MERIT 2 D in terms its high depth resolution and is compared in detail with traditional 2 D and 3 D surface resistivity methods of equal foot prints. Similar comparison was made between MERIT 3 D technique and 3 D surface resistivity measurements. Results show that both methods achieve high depth resolution compared to their equivalent traditional resistivity methods. Laboratory experiment conducted using a complex analogue model mimicking actual sinkhole structure is used to test MERIT 2 D. Also laboratory experiment involving a 3 D printed plastic cave model mimicking an actual cave was conducted using MERIT 3 D approach. Both results show the promise of MERIT approach to image and solve complex geological structures or problems. Finally, the method is applied to collect field data in three case study sites involving complex karst related sinkhole structures and an old landfill site. The result shows the promising capability of the MERIT technique to study challenging geologic conditions with high depth resolution...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: With {{the onset}} of the new {{statutory}} merger in South Africa, the impact of the practical implementation of the procedure has revealed numerous holes and uncertainties readers concerning the reorganisation of assets and liabilities. One of the major stumbling blocks of the procedure stems from the lack of guidelines provided in the current legislation. By way of normative methodology this paper will consider in detail and highlight discrepancies in the wording used to describe the process of the transfer of assets and liabilities. An attempt has been to provide an analysis through the minefield of the <b>procedural</b> requirements. The <b>guidelines</b> can be used to prevent delays in the implementation of the statutory merger and navigate the interaction between the Companies Act and other legislation. To this end, it appears that the legislature will need to review the procedure as well as provide appropriate guidelines when dealing with inconsistencies in other legislation.

40|$|The National Credit Act 1 {{has brought}} about {{significant}} changes to the South African credit market. Amongst these changes are the provisions that introduced concepts such as ?over-indebtedness? and ?reckless credit?, {{as well as the}} provisions that implemented a new alternative debt relief measure into our law. Section 86 of the NCA introduced the debt review process in terms whereof an over-indebted consumer can voluntarily apply to a debt counsellor to be placed under debt review with regard to credit agreements that fall within the scope of application of the NCA. 2 Upon receipt of a consumer application, a debt counsellor will proceed to conduct an assessment of the consumer?s financial means, prospects and obligations with the aim of ascertaining whether or not the consumer is indeed over-indebted. During this period of assessment, a moratorium becomes operative which restricts the right of credit providers with whom the consumer has a credit agreement, subject to debt review, to proceed with debt enforcement proceedings against the defaulting consumer. Only once the prescribed period of 60 business days has lapsed, 3 but before the matter is filed at court, may the credit provider terminate the debt review and consequently proceed with debt enforcement proceedings. Although the NCA affords credit providers the right to terminate a debt review this right is however not absolute, as the NCA also affords consumers with the opportunity to apply for the revival of the terminated debt review. Consequently, {{it will be up to}} the court hearing such an application for revival to make a ruling. The legislature, however, failed to include into the NCA detailed <b>procedural</b> rules and <b>guidelines</b> in respect of the debt review process, more specifically in respect of the termination procedure. This oversight of <b>procedural</b> rules and <b>guidelines</b> by the legislature has proven to be very problematic and has resulted in a vast range of conflicting judgments by our courts. This dissertation aims to analyse the procedural issues pertaining to the termination procedure, in its original and amended forms, as well as the reinstatement procedure. These issues will be discussed and inferences will be made. Recommendations will also be provided in the hope of contributing to streamlining the debt review process and in particular the termination and revival procedures.

40|$|Procedural {{sedation}} and analgesia (PSA) {{techniques for}} pediatrics are developing rapidly (1, 2) {{but there are}} still tensions amongst specialties with regard to safe implementation, autonomy, and limits of practice, competences, training and credentialing. Practice varies around the world and even within countries, and an important factor is availability of pediatric anesthesiology services to undertake large numbers of cases under anesthesia. In the United Kingdom (UK), some regions have these services well organized and the demand for pediatric PSA is quite limited. Other regions or individual centers have a relative shortage of pediatric anesthesiology provision or hotspots of high demand, for example for diagnostic imaging, and this can only be met by introducing a pediatric PSA service. An example from the UK is the nurse-led pediatric sedation service at Great Ormond Street Hospital (3, 4). Another clinical pressure point in the UK is in Emergency Medicine with 4 -h waiting time targets and reduction in availability of primary care out-of-hours services. Drawing on experience from the USA (5) and Australia, a number of enthusiasts in the UK have introduced PSA with ketamine into their pediatric emergency medicine practices and have argued cogently for its more widespread use (5 – 10). Not all agree however that the UK is ready for this yet (11) and in the Scottish pediatric <b>procedural</b> sedation <b>guidelines,</b> ketamine is regarded as a general anesthetic agent for use by anesthesiologists (12). There are no universally agreed national guidelines in the UK for pediatric PSA and this has led to the proliferation of a number of specialty-specific guidelines, including in pediatric emergency medicine (13).
