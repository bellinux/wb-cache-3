50|$|The Cyclone Engine {{is built}} of three major components, the Steam Generator, <b>Piston</b> <b>Block,</b> and Condenser. The working fluid, {{deionized}} water, travels continuously through these three components. Beginning in the steam generator, {{moving into the}} pistons, then to the condenser, and finally pumped back into the steam generator.|$|E
50|$|The {{condenser}} is a {{stack of}} interleaved circular plates, with an open core containing an impeller and a condensate sump underneath it. The exhaust vapor enters {{the top of the}} condenser from the <b>piston</b> <b>block</b> and is forced by the impeller onto the sides of the condenser and into the leaves of the circular plates. On the outside of the plates, a blower circulates air around the interleaved plates. This effectively condenses the exhaust vapor, which falls into the condensate sump {{at the bottom of the}} engine. A high pressure pump then pumps the condensate out of the sump, through the regenerative heating coils around the cylinder, and back into the steam generator.|$|E
40|$|A {{parts of}} the {{contemporary}} rotary compressors are supported as by revolving crankshaft (rotor, roller, etc.), so by the housing (stator, pump, suction accumulator, etc.). Such dual supporting structure complicates assembly of a compressor due to the necessity of precision axial and radial positioning of the pump parts, motor rotor and stator. Developed novel rotary compressor provides a unitary assembly, in which a rotor of the driver -external rotor electric motor, is integrated with concentrically situated pump and rotatably arranged on stationary crankshaft. Stationary crankshaft is fixedly connected to the hermetic housing and supports as the fixed to it motor stator, so the rotor block and the <b>piston</b> <b>block</b> revolving around it. The single structure supporting the motor stator, the rotor block, the <b>piston</b> <b>block</b> and housing simplifies compressor assembly, and allows precision, reliable setting of the parts due to the common single reference - axial line. The <b>piston</b> <b>block</b> and the rotor block have only one line rolling contact, where tangential velocities of blocks are unidirectional and equal in magnitude. It means that the sliding frictional losses at the line contact are minimal. The frictional losses between the rotor blocks radial surfaces and facing surfaces of the <b>piston</b> <b>block</b> heads are also minimal due to the low relative rubbing speed between synchronously revolving in one direction contacting surfaces. Suction system of the novel rotary compressor excluded direct delivery of the refrigerant to the suction chamber by positioning a suction input cavity and a motor cavity in between the suction intake located {{at the top of}} the housing and suction port inlet {{at the top of the}} motor cavity. The arrangement of a refrigerant delivery eliminates external accumulator, increases the liquid refrigerant storage capacity and provides cooling of the compressor motor during and after its duty cycle. The vapor will be delivered substantially free of liquid refrigerant into the suction chamber under higher pressure (supercharged) due to the action of the impeller positioned in the motor cavity. The rotation of the <b>piston</b> <b>block</b> is due to the distributed forces which have been transmitted from an external rotor of the motor through the direct, no sliding line contact between both blocks and through a mechanical link – vane, which is rigidly fixed in the <b>piston</b> <b>block</b> wall. Another advantage of the novel rotary compressor is that the discharge gas will be tangentially ejected in form of one or more high-speed jets in the direction opposite to the direction of rotation. It creates a reaction forces acting in the direction of rotation and added to the forces revolving the <b>piston</b> <b>block.</b> The design modifications described above, employment of an external rotor motor as a driver, elimination of the roller, reciprocating movement of the vane, vane spring, and external accumulator, utilization of new developed tubular discharge valve improve performance of novel rotary compressor, make it compact, (smaller package space), reliable, and reduce manufacturing cost. *) Dreiman N.

The term is extremely popular among spud gun enthusiasts who often build homemade piston valves for use in pneumatic cannon.

50|$|From an army manual on {{pile driving}} hammers:The initial start {{up of the}} hammer {{requires}} the piston (ram) to be raised {{to a point where}} the trip automatically releases the piston, allowing it to fall by gravity. As the piston falls, it activates the fuel pump, which discharges a metered amount of fuel into the ball pan of the impact <b>block.</b> The falling <b>piston</b> also <b>blocks</b> the exhaust ports, and compression of fuel trapped in the cylinder begins. The compressed air exerts a pre-load force to hold the impact block firmly against the drive cap and pile. At the bottom of the compression stroke, the piston strikes the impact block, atomizing the fuel and starting the pile on its downward movement. In the instant after the piston strikes, the atomized fuel ignites, and the resulting explosion exerts an even greater force on the already moving pile, driving it further into the ground. The reaction of the explosion rebounding from the resistance of the pile drives the piston upward. As the piston rises, the exhaust ports open, releasing the gases and force of the explosion into the atmosphere. After the piston stops its upward movement, it again falls by gravity to start another cycle.|$|R

Soil samples were taken using a 50 mm Swedish STII piston sampler and the Norwegian University of Science and Technology (NTNU) mini-block sampler from a soft clay test site.

Hitherto such comparisons have focused on differences in basic engineering properties such as strength and stiffness. The effect of choosing alternative model parameters from <b>piston</b> and <b>block</b> samples is demonstrated through {{the analysis of the}} long-term settlement of an embankment. The simulations show that substantially larger settlements and lateral displacements are predicted using parameters obtained from the piston samples. Furthermore, the magnitude of the differences is larger than expected. This demonstrates that for this application, relatively small differences in the assessed sample quality, using traditional laboratory data interpretation methods, are amplified when applied to a prototype boundary value problem. It is suggested that a little more care in sampling and testing can result in large cost savings {{as a result of the}} more reliable model parameters that can be extracted, particularly when the improved sampling is combined with the use of an advanced constitutive model...|$|R

The Td5 engine is often mistakenly attributed to BMW; it was derived from the Rover L-series passenger car engine and further developed by Land Rover. The 3,948 cc V8 petrol version from the Discovery 1 was replaced with the Range Rover P38 Thor 4.0-litre Rover-derived V8. There was no actual increase in capacity over the previous 3.9-litre engine. Although the basic design of the engine was similar, it was actually quite different internally: it used a different crankshaft, had larger bearing journals with cross bolted caps, different con rods, and different <b>pistons.</b> The <b>blocks</b> were machined differently, to accept extra sensors for the Gems and Bosch (Thor) injection system and to allow the extra stroke of the 4.6 crankshaft.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND PURPOSE: Hypereutectic aluminum-silicon (Al-Si) alloys {{are widely}} used in the {{aerospace}} and automobile industries because of their low density, excellent wear and corrosion resistance, low coefficient of thermal expansion, good strength, and excellent castability. They are used in applications that typically require a combination of light weight and high wear resistance, such as liner-less engine <b>blocks,</b> <b>pistons,</b> and pumps. However, the performance of these alloys depends on the fineness of their cast microstructure, especially dendrite cell size, primary and eutectic Si particles. METHODS AND MATERIALS: In this study, the effects of applied electric current on the cast microstructure of Al- 13 wt. %Si and Al- 20 wt. %Si were investigated. This involved application of an electric current density of about 500 mA/cm 2 of melt surface area during solidification of laboratory-size ingots in a metal mold. The electric current was applied with a constant voltage power supply. RESULTS: Microscopic examination of the cast ingots with a metallurgical microscope revealed that the applied electric refined the cast microstructure of the hypereutectic Al-Si alloys. Specifically, {{it appeared that the}} electric current slightly modified the eutectic silicon particles and changed the size distribution of the primary silicon particles by increasing the population of comparatively smaller size particles.

40|$|AIM: Feedback during CPR may {{facilitate}} quality in chest compressions, but {{has also been}} associated with caregiver complaints such as stiff wrists, {{the need for more}} force and increased fatigue. This concern about extra work is, when using the CPREzy with its own spring-loaded surface, particularly relevant {{in the face of an}} increased number of successive compressions. This manuscript evaluates the objective workloads for caregivers with and without the CPREzy. MATERIALS AND METHODS: An air pressure driven, piston device was used to generate controlled compressions in a manikin model. The pressure was applied for chest compressions with each of the following: the cylindrical end of the <b>piston,</b> a wooden <b>block</b> as dummy for the CPREzy, and the CPREzy itself. Three manikins with subjectively different spring compliances were selected for the tests. Series of 20 compressions were performed over a wide range of pressures. RESULTS: No additional force is required to achieve a given depth of compression with or without the CPREzy. However, some additional work is required, ranging from 21 to 26. 5 %. This work is caused by the longer compression distance associated with the need to compress two springs (e. g. the CPREzy and the chest wall) instead of one (e. g. the chest wall). CONCLUSION: The subjective feeling of increased rescuer fatigue with the CPREzy can, at least in part, be attributed to the extra work required for compressing the spring of the CPREzy. Improved accuracy in chest compression depth is likely to be another, more significant, factor in rescuer fatigue...|$|R

50|$|The Mazda FE-DOHC was the DOHC {{variant of}} the FE. The {{official}} Mazda engine codes are FE-DE and FE-ZE, depending on output level. It is still commonly called the FE3 because of its head castings. The FE-DOHC shares the same dimensions as the original FE-SOHC, including the square 86 mm bore × stroke and it has an ideal 1.74 rod/stroke ratio. The FE-DOHC is usually identified by a gold-coloured cam cover, however not always. There were at least five different FE-DOHC engines available with various compression ratio, camshaft and ECU tuning combinations, however none were fitted with a turbocharger from the factory. Despite this, the FE-DOHC is already built for turbo with large forged connecting rods, large journal dimensions, oil cooler, <b>piston</b> oilers, web-stiffened <b>block</b> with main girdles (and braceplate where equipped). This robust engine design is a favourite of tuners who are aware of its capability because it already has a high-power capacity perfect for custom turbo jobs. As much as 600 whp has been seen on a stock engine. The common FE-DOHC crankshaft is cast while the forged crankshaft is fitted to the aluminum sump engines with both the main bearing braces and the main bearing girdle plate. In European 10.0:1 compression, non-catalytic trim, the FE-DOHC produces 148 ps (108 kW) at 6000 rpm and 133 lb/ft (182 Nm) at 4000 rpm. The 9.2:1 compression, catalytic converter version produces 140 ps. The Japanese domestic market variants produce anywhere between 145 ps and 165 ps. The only vehicle with 165ps was the 96-97 Capellas Wagons, FX (MT or AT) or FX Cruising (Only exists in AT). They had different tail lights to the earlier wagons.|$|R
