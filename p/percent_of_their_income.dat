5|$|Minnesota has a {{progressive}} income tax structure; the four brackets of {{state income tax}} rates are 5.35, 7.05, 7.85 and 9.85 percent. As of 2008, Minnesota was ranked 12th {{in the nation in}} per capita total state and local taxes. In 2008, Minnesotans paid 10.2 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>income</b> in state and local taxes; the U.S. average was 9.7 percent. The state sales tax in Minnesota is 6.875 percent, but there is no sales tax on clothing, prescription drug medications, some services, or food items for home consumption. The state legislature may allow municipalities to institute local sales taxes and special local taxes, such as the 0.5 percent supplemental sales tax in Minneapolis. Excise taxes are levied on alcohol, tobacco, and motor fuel. The state imposes a use tax on items purchased elsewhere but used within Minnesota. Owners of real property in Minnesota pay property tax to their county, municipality, school district, and special taxing districts.|$|E

25|$|Concerning affordability, an {{analysis}} of the 2007 household budget survey shows that the wealthiest quintile of Tanzanians spends more than 4000 Tanzanian Shilling (US$3.10) per month for water, corresponding to about 1 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>income.</b> Those in the poorest quintile spend only about 1000 Tanzanian Shilling (US$0.77) per month for water, but this represents 4.5 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>income.</b> One of the reasons why the poor spend less in absolute terms on water is that they fetch water for free from wells and streams. The data are not differentiated between rural and urban areas, although {{it is likely that the}} urban poor who have no access to free water sources pay much more for water than those in rural areas.|$|E

25|$|According to a {{household}} survey concerning water use that {{was carried out}} in 2005 among 110 poor households in various neighbourhoods, poor households typically rely on a variety of water sources, including foremost network water, vended water and groundwater. Network water and groundwater are usually bought from other households that have a connection or a well, or from public hydrants that are operated by private vendors. Use of different water sources varies over time depending on changes in quality, availability and pressure. Some households also collect rainwater.

2500|$|On January 1, 2011, a {{group of}} twelve lawmakers from the ruling and {{opposition}} parties introduced a bill into the South Korean National Assembly {{to allow for the}} establishment of a [...] "unification tax". The bill called for businesses to pay 0.5 percent of corporate tax, individuals to pay 5 percent of inheritance or gift taxes, and both individuals and companies to pay two <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> <b>income</b> tax towards the cost of unification. The bill initiated legislative debate on practical measures to prepare for unification, as proposed by President Lee Myung-bak in his Liberation Day speech the previous year. The proposal for a unification tax was not warmly welcomed at the time. Lee has since reiterated concerns regarding the imminence of unification, which, combined with North Korean behavior, led to the tax proposal gaining wider acceptance. Practical measures to prepare for unification are becoming an increasingly frequent aspect of political debate, as concern regarding imminent and abrupt unification increases.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{and details}} the {{main sources of}} household income in Washington using the Census of Population PUMS microsample. In accord with the generally good economy in the 1990 ’s, the share of property type income in total household income increased from 1990 to 2000. And with welfare reform in the mid- 1990 ’s the share of public assistance type income decreased {{as a share of}} household income. In order to better understand the relative importance of alternative sources of income to Washington households, each household was identified according to the income source which provided the largest contribution to household income. For example, a household whose largest source of income comes from salary and wages was identified as a Labor household. Similarly, households whose largest source of income was interest, dividends or net rentals were identified as Capital households. Labor and capital households are not very different in terms of mean household income. In 2000, average household income of Labor households was $ 65, 300 while the average household income of Capital households was $ 96, 200. However, Labor households were very different than Capital household regarding diversification of income source. Labor households depended upon wage income for 92 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> mean household income. Capital households obtained 70 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mean household <b>income</b> from interest, dividends and rents, but also had 11 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mean <b>income</b> from wages and 15 <b>percent</b> <b>of</b> <b>their</b> mean <b>income</b> from social security and pensions.
