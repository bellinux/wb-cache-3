25|$|A simple example {{would be}} a GPU program that {{collects}} data about average lighting values as it renders some view from either a camera or a computer graphics program {{back to the main}} program on the CPU, so that the CPU can then make adjustments to the overall screen view. A more advanced example might use edge detection to return both numerical information and a <b>processed</b> <b>image</b> representing outlines to a computer vision program controlling, say, a mobile robot. Because the GPU has fast and local hardware access to every pixel or other picture element in an image, it can analyze and average it (for the first example) or apply a Sobel edge filter or other convolution filter (for the second) with much greater speed than a CPU, which typically must access slower random-access memory copies of the graphic in question.|$|E
2500|$|The three color {{records are}} stacked as shown at right, with a UV filter on top {{to keep the}} {{non-visible}} ultraviolet radiation from exposing the silver-halide crystals, which are naturally sensitive to UV light. [...] Next are the fast and slow blue-sensitive layers, which, when developed, form the latent image. [...] When the exposed silver-halide crystal is developed, it is coupled with a dye grain of its complementary color. [...] This forms a dye [...] "cloud" [...] (like {{a drop of water}} on a paper towel) and is limited in its growth by development-inhibitor-releasing (DIR) couplers, which also serve to refine the sharpness of the <b>processed</b> <b>image</b> by limiting the size of the dye clouds. The dye clouds formed in the blue layer are actually yellow (the opposite or complementary color to blue). [...] There are two layers to each color; a [...] "fast" [...] and a [...] "slow." [...] The fast layer features larger grains that are more sensitive to light than the slow layer, which has finer grain and is less sensitive to light. [...] Silver-halide crystals are naturally sensitive to blue light, so the blue layers are {{on the top of the}} film and they are followed immediately by a yellow filter, which stops any more blue light from passing through to the green and red layers and biasing those crystals with extra blue exposure. [...] Next are the red-sensitive record (which forms cyan dyes when developed); and, at the bottom, the green-sensitive record, which forms magenta dyes when developed. [...] Each color is separated by a gelatin layer that prevents silver development in one record from causing unwanted dye formation in another. On the back of the film base is an anti-halation layer that absorbs light which would otherwise be weakly reflected back through the film by that surface and create halos of light around bright features in the image. In color film, this backing is [...] "rem-jet", a black-pigmented, non-gelatin layer which is removed in the developing process.|$|E

40|$|Fourth-order partial {{differential}} equation (PDE) proposed by You and Kaveh (You-Kaveh fourth-order PDE), which replaces the gradient operator in classical second-order nonlinear diffusion methods with a Laplacian operator, {{is able to}} avoid blocky effects often caused by second-order nonlinear PDEs. However, the equation brought forward by You and Kaveh tends to leave the <b>processed</b> <b>images</b> with isolated black and white speckles. Although You and Kaveh use median filters to filter these speckles, median filters can blur the <b>processed</b> <b>images</b> to some extent, which weakens the result of You-Kaveh fourth-order PDE. In this paper, the reason why You-Kaveh fourth-order PDE can leave the <b>processed</b> <b>images</b> with isolated black and white speckles is analyzed, and a new fourth-order PDE based on the changes of Laplacian (LC fourth-order PDE) is proposed and tested. The new fourth-order PDE preserves the advantage of You-Kaveh fourth-order PDE and avoids leaving isolated black and white speckles. Moreover, the new fourth-order PDE keeps the boundary from being blurred and preserves the nuance in the <b>processed</b> <b>images,</b> so, the <b>processed</b> <b>images</b> look very natural...|$|R
