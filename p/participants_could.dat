5|$|The game also {{features}} a multiplayer mode, in which 8 players race each other using the DS Download Play feature or a multi-card wireless LAN connection. Until its discontinuation on May 20, 2014, Mario Kart DS supported online play via the Nintendo Wi-Fi Connection, in which up to 4 players could play together. When playing online, <b>participants</b> <b>could</b> only race against each other; Battle mode is not available when playing via an online connection. These features are not available in the Wii U VC version because the multiplayer features have not been emulated. R.O.B. is a middleweight character.|$|E
5|$|Due to a {{small number}} of embassies, Azerbaijan can be more {{difficult}} to obtain a visa when compared to other countries which have hosted the Olympiad. This issue was briefly raised during the 83rd FIDE Congress, and Azad Rahimov noted the country had a positive experience with the Eurovision Song Contest 2012, where all <b>participants</b> <b>could</b> receive a visa on arrival at the airport without any problem. In a similar manner, in April 2016, the President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev signed an order on simplifying the visa procedures for travellers to Azerbaijan in connection with the Chess Olympiad, allowing them to get visas in the country's international airports.|$|E
5|$|Economists have {{referred}} to the onset of World War I {{as the end of}} an age of innocence for foreign exchange markets, as it was the first geopolitical conflict to have a destabilizing and paralyzing impact. The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on August 4, 1914 following Germany's invasion of France and Belgium. In the weeks prior, the foreign exchange market in London was the first to exhibit distress. European tensions and increasing political uncertainty motivated investors to chase liquidity, prompting commercial banks to borrow heavily from London's discount market. As the money market tightened, discount lenders began rediscounting their reserves at the Bank of England rather than discounting new pounds sterling. The Bank of England was forced to raise discount rates daily for three days from 3% on July 30 to 10% by August 1. As foreign investors resorted to buying pounds for remittance to London just to pay off their newly maturing securities, the sudden demand for pounds led the pound to appreciate beyond its gold value against most major currencies, yet sharply depreciate against the French franc after French banks began liquidating their London accounts. Remittance to London became increasingly difficult and culminated in a record exchange rate of $6.50 USD/GBP. Emergency measures were introduced in the form of moratoria and extended bank holidays, but to no effect as financial contracts became informally unable to be negotiated and export embargoes thwarted gold shipments. A week later, the Bank of England began to address the deadlock in the foreign exchange markets by establishing a new channel for transatlantic payments whereby <b>participants</b> <b>could</b> make remittance payments to the U.K. by depositing gold designated for a Bank of England account with Canada's Minister of Finance, and in exchange receive pounds sterling at an exchange rate of $4.90. Approximately $104 million USD in remittances flowed through this channel in the next two months. However, pound sterling liquidity ultimately did not improve due to inadequate relief for merchant banks receiving sterling bills. As the pound sterling was the world's reserve currency and leading vehicle currency, market illiquidity and merchant banks' hesitance to accept sterling bills left currency markets paralyzed.|$|E
30|$|During the experiment, we {{examined}} participants’ swing speed and participants’ maximum waist, shoulder, elbow, and wrist acceleration. The first variable shows whether a <b>participant</b> <b>could</b> increase swing speed and bat swing skill, {{and the second}} showed whether beginner <b>participant</b> <b>could</b> develop the ideal kinetic chain.|$|R
30|$|Based on the {{definition}} above, DIDs {{could be viewed}} as urban areas, while non-DIDs represents rural areas, suburban areas, etc. Then, the address of each <b>participant</b> <b>could</b> be located into DID or non-DID areas.|$|R
30|$|Since {{most of our}} {{participants}} (see next section) are native German speakers, the questionnaire was created in German and later translated to English. Every <b>participant</b> <b>could</b> freely choose to complete the questionnaire in either language.|$|R
25|$|In 1888, Galton {{established}} a lab {{in the science}} galleries of the South Kensington Museum. In Galton's lab, <b>participants</b> <b>could</b> be measured to gain knowledge of their strengths and weaknesses. Galton also used these data for his own research. He would typically charge people a small fee for his services.|$|E
25|$|However, such {{retrospective}} {{studies were}} subject to certain biases that may have affected the results. For example, the <b>participants</b> <b>could</b> {{have been influenced by}} a number of memory biases such as a possible selective memory bias for events that were more emotionally intense, or a possible bias to more easily recall more recent events.|$|E
25|$|Part of {{the survey}} {{required}} a short answer portion where <b>participants</b> <b>could</b> write a sentence or so to explain some answers given. Several said they also felt an extreme amount of shame or continued sadness because they had blamed themselves for their partner’s straying. “Because maybe it was my fault,” said one survey-taker, a female in her 20s, who experienced {{a high level of}} shame. The survey revealed that 72% of the participants self-esteem was directly affected when their partners cheated on them (Johnson, 2017).|$|E
30|$|The second {{significant}} information {{found during}} the first study was that not a single <b>participant</b> <b>could</b> reuse the framework faster by using the conventional process than by using the reuse tool in the same activity.|$|R
30|$|Seven student {{participants}} used a button-style {{switch device}} (Origin Instruments, 2013) {{that is similar}} to a computer mouse, but specially designed for people with motor disabilities that use switch keyboards. A <b>participant</b> <b>could</b> attend at most two sessions each day (in the morning and afternoon, respectively). Before the formal experiments, a 1 h tutorial was given so that the <b>participant</b> <b>could</b> practice and get familiar with the keyboard and the switch devices. To motivate participants to perform their best, each participant received a base of $ 5 for each session and a reward of $ 0.025 for each correct character entry. On average, participants earned around $ 45 for a session.|$|R
50|$|Before {{computers}} became ubiquitous, tachistoscopes {{were used}} extensively in psychological research to present visual stimuli for controlled durations. Some experiments employed pairs of tachistoscopes so that an experimental <b>participant</b> <b>could</b> be given different stimulation in each visual field.|$|R
25|$|The {{explanation}} {{given for}} the success of administrating Tetris as opposed to other interventions is that Tetris draws heavily on visuospatial processing power. Because the brain only has a limited supply of resources to process information, playing Tetris hinders the ability of the brain to focus on other visual information, such as traumatic images. However, the details of the event can still be thought of and rehearsed verbally, as Tetris should not interfere with verbal processes of the brain. This explains why <b>participants</b> <b>could</b> remember the details of the footage they watched but why they still experienced fewer flashbacks.|$|E
25|$|Composition on the Table (1998/99) {{comprises}} {{four white}} tables bearing physical interface components: switches, dials, and turntables. Computer graphics images are projected onto the tables from ceiling-mounted video projectors, and loudspeakers are present. As the audience manipulates the interface elements, graphical and audio changes {{take place in}} a way that is intimately connected to the audience's input. The objective of this work was to create a mixed reality environment where multiple <b>participants</b> <b>could</b> create visuals and music together. Elements of this work are recognizable in Iwai's Nintendo DS videogame Electroplankton. The piece was presented as part of the Art Gallery at SIGGRAPH'99, Los Angeles.|$|E
25|$|If a {{participant}} indicated a {{tip of the}} tongue state, {{they were asked to}} provide any information about the target word they could recall. Brown and McNeill found that <b>participants</b> <b>could</b> identify the first letter of the target word, the number of syllables of the target word, words of similar sound, words of similar meaning, syllabic pattern, and the serial position of some letters in the target word better than would be expected by chance. Their findings demonstrated the legitimacy of the feeling of knowing experienced in a tip of the tongue state. This study was the foundation for subsequent research about tip of the tongue phenomenon.|$|E
50|$|Instead of many {{participants}} competing to solve communal cards {{for a set}} time, each <b>participant</b> <b>could</b> be presented with an entire pack of cards. The times taken {{to work through the}} pack, solving all cards, would be recorded and compared.|$|R
30|$|The arrows {{used in the}} {{implemented}} technique {{were designed}} to always originate from {{the centre of the}} interface. The tail of an arrow remained in the centre of the interface while the <b>participant</b> <b>could</b> drag the arrowhead to any location on display. The arrow being manipulated would therefore point from the centre of the interface towards the location of a participant’s last relevant touch (“relevant” being defined as a touch within a certain distance of the arrowhead); this allowed participants to determine the direction and length of the arrow. The <b>participant</b> <b>could</b> reposition an arrowhead as much as they wanted. Once a participant has finished establishing an arrow’s direction they would then be expected to press a button on the interface to confirm their arrangement.|$|R
50|$|Castroville, Watsonville and Napa hosted parades where bands <b>could</b> <b>participant</b> and <b>could</b> qualify (compete to {{earn enough}} {{competition}} points {{to gain a}} berth at nationals) then {{to go to the}} state championship.|$|R
25|$|The sambandham {{relationship}} was usually arranged by the karanavan but occasionally they would arise {{from a woman}} attracting {{a man in a}} temple, bathing pool or other public place. The first sambandham of a man was deemed to be momentous and his ability to engage in a large number of such relationships increased his reputation in his community. Sambandham relationships could be broken, due to differences between the spouses or because a karavanan forced it due to being pressured by a man of higher rank who desired to marry the woman. Marriage by sambandham was neither legally recognised nor binding. The relationship could end at will and the <b>participants</b> <b>could</b> remarry without any ramifications. Attempts to regulate sambandham marriages by the Nayar Regulation Act of 1912 in Travancore and the Malabar Marriage Act of 1896 in British Malabar were not very successful.|$|E

30|$|The City, Department, Doctor and Hospital tables have an “Id, Name” structure, with “Id” {{as primary}} key. The “Doctor” table {{contains}} “Id, Name, Age, Sex and BornIn”. The latter field is the “Id” {{of the city}} where the doctor was born. The junction tables allow {{for the expression of}} the “many-to-many” relationships indicated by each junction table’s title. It {{is important to note that}} each participant was offered the opportunity to choose between several sub-schemas from the main schema. For instance, a <b>participant</b> <b>could</b> choose only to convert the sub-schema composed of the entities Hospital—HospitalDepartment—Department or the sub-schema Doctor—DoctorDepartment—Department or the <b>participant</b> <b>could</b> select the entire schema. Note the five key aspects of this RDB conversion that best represent the items that must undergo conversion: Tables, Constraints, Primary Keys (PK), Foreign Keys (FK) and other elements (others like; fields, types of relationships, views, indexes, procedures and triggers).|$|R
500|$|In September 1986, {{the local}} {{government}} and the Council of Communal Development ( [...] , CODECO) made a public call for tenders to create a coat of arms for the commune, {{with the purpose of}} [...] "counting with a symbolic expression of representativeness, and to exalt distinctive features of the area and its people,"}} adding that they were [...] "seeking a coat of arms similar, but not identical to that of the province of Cardenal Caro." [...] <b>Participants</b> <b>could</b> send as many designs as they wanted, as far as it included the name of the commune and the date of its creation, 21 December 1891. Authors could add a motto and an inscription to their coat of arms if they wanted to. An article in local newspaper Pichilemu stated that the new coat of arms was to be chosen by a jury composed of the mayor of Pichilemu, the director of Municipal Works, two members of the CODECO, a representative of the culture department of the regional secretariat of the Education Ministry, an artist, and a teacher. The eventual winner would earn a prize of 100,000 pesos, and a diploma. Once past the deadline, set for 31 October 1986, the jury had a month to make a decision.|$|E
2500|$|After {{the turn}} of the 19th century, the facón became more of a utility and {{ceremonial}} weapon, though it was still used to settle arguments [...] "of honor".
