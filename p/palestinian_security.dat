The next year it became the first Palestinian-controlled town to be the site of major operation by Israeli forces during the Second Intifada. When Fathiya Barghouti Rheime was elected mayor in 2005, Bani Zeid became the first Palestinian locality with a woman as head of the municipality, in concurrence with nearby Ramallah. The current mayor is Abdel Karim Abu Aql, elected in 2012.|$|E

On 9–10 February night, a barrage of 25–50 Qassam rockets and mortar shells hit Neve Dekalim settlement, and another barrage hit at noon. Hamas said it was in retaliation for an attack in which one Palestinian was killed near an Israeli settlement. As {{a response to the}} mortar attack, Abbas ordered the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>security</b> forces to stop such attacks in the future. He also fired senior commanders in the <b>Palestinian</b> <b>security</b> apparatus. On 10 February, Israeli security forces arrested Maharan Omar Shucat Abu Hamis, a Palestinian resident of Nablus, who was about to launch a bus suicide attack in the French Hill in Jerusalem.|$|E
25|$|As {{violence}} between the Israeli army and Palestinian militants intensified, Israel expanded its security apparatus around the West Bank by re-taking {{many parts of}} land in Area A. Israel established a complicated system of roadblocks and checkpoints around major Palestinian areas to deter violence and protect Israeli settlements.

25|$|The {{former deputy}} {{national}} security adviser to President George W. Bush, Elliott Abrams, characterized the impetus for founding the USSC as based on three factors: George W.

[...] Haaretz reported that details from a preliminary Hamas investigation procured by the newspaper suggested that al-Mabhouh was assassinated by agents of an Arab government, and that al-Mabhouh was wanted by Egypt and Jordan.

25|$|On 29 March, Israel {{launched}} Operation Defensive Shield, {{which lasted}} until 3 May. The IDF made sweeping incursions throughout the West Bank, and into numerous Palestinian cities.

The UN estimated that 497 Palestinians {{were killed and}} 1,447 wounded by the Israeli response from 1 March to 7 May, although B'Tselem registered 240 killed. Most of the casualties were members of <b>Palestinian</b> <b>security</b> forces and militant groups. Israeli forces also arrested 4,258 Palestinians during the operation.

All the armed Palestinian organizations except Hamas' al-Qassam Brigades issued statements threatening to harm Israel should it not halt the operation. Meanwhile, the Israel Prison Service decided to raise the alert level in all Israeli prisons where <b>Palestinian</b> <b>security</b> prisoners were being held.

Preparations to reinforce the Iraqi army were made and <b>Palestinian</b> <b>security</b> forces were to be reduced to the minimum. British forces in East Africa were to study operations to destroy the Italian forces and support local risings, all in support of the main Allied offensive, which was planned to be launched from French Somaliland.
