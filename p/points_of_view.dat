40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{analysis}} of the use of the first person <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> in Wilkie Collins' The Woman in White. The Woman in White is a novel of mystery. The use of the first person <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> <b>of</b> more than one characters is suitable to reveal the mystery of the story. It is through Walter Hartright's <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> Marian Halcombe's <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> Vincent Gilmore's <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> and Count Fosco's <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b> The narrators' interpretations on the story's actions are limited. For by using the first person <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> they can tell only what they know and observe by themselves. They cannot report the thoughts and feelings of other characters for they cannot enter their minds. However these limitations have their advantages. The narrators' separate reports create a unity of the story. Their reports then reveal the story's mystery. Therefore the use of the first person <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> is effective for it can create the suspense and the tension of the novel...|$|R

Welles also dispenses {{with the idea of}} a single storyteller and uses multiple narrators to recount Kane's life. The use of multiple narrators was unheard of in Hollywood films. Each narrator recounts a different part of Kane's life, with each story partly overlapping. The film depicts Kane as an enigma, a complicated man who, in the end, leaves viewers with more questions than answers as to his character, such as the newsreel footage where he is attacked for being both a communist and a fascist.|$|E

5|$|The {{extremely}} nested pseudonymity of {{this work}} adds a problem of interpretation. A and B are {{the authors of the}} work, Eremita is the editor.

His art correspondingly changed sharply from being mainly observational, with a strong emphasis on the realistic details of things seen in nature and architecture, to being the product of his geometric analysis and his visual imagination.

5|$|Representative {{of the new}} {{historical}} perspective is the 2003 biography by Pauline Croft. Reviewer John Cramsie summarises her findings:Croft's overall assessment of James is appropriately mixed. She recognises his good intentions in matters like Anglo-Scottish union, his openness to different <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view,</b> and his agenda of a peaceful foreign policy within his kingdoms' financial means. His actions moderated frictions between his diverse peoples. Yet he also created new ones, particularly by supporting colonisation that polarised the crown's interest groups in Ireland, obtaining insufficient political benefit with his open-handed patronage, an unfortunate {{lack of attention to}} the image of monarchy (particularly after the image-obsessed regime of Elizabeth), pursuing a pro-Spanish foreign policy that fired religious prejudice and opened the door for Arminians within the English church, and enforcing unpalatable religious changes on the Scottish Kirk. Many of these criticisms are framed within a longer view of James' reigns, including the legacy – now understood to be more troubled – which he left Charles I.|$|E
5|$|Sometimes Venus only grazes the Sun {{during a}} transit. In {{this case it}} is {{possible}} that in some areas of the Earth a full transit can be seen while in other regions there is only a partial transit (no second or third contact). The last transit of this type was on 6 December 1631, and the next such transit will occur on 13 December 2611. It is also possible that a transit of Venus can be seen {{in some parts of the}} world as a partial transit, while in others Venus misses the Sun. Such a transit last occurred on 19 November 541 BC, and the next transit of this type will occur on 14 December 2854. These effects occur due to parallax, since the size of the Earth affords different <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> with slightly different lines of sight to Venus and the Sun. It can be demonstrated by closing an eye and holding a finger in front of a smaller more distant object; when you open the other eye and close the first, the finger will no longer be in front of the object.|$|E

The research design used in this research: 1) this research was categorized as a library research by using documentation and interview as the method in collecting data. 2) The data and data sources in this research were the fan fiction entitled Bad Boy and the result of interview conducted to the writer as the primary sources, meanwhile secondary sources used were: text book, online sources, ebook, journal, and other printed materials. 3) the approaches used in this research were expressive objective approach, 4) The credibility and dependability in this research were checked by using theoretical triangulation, 5) In collecting data, the researcher used some steps such as: a) Studying Bad boy fan fiction comprehensively and critically, b) conducting an interview towards the author of Bad Boy fan fiction, c) finding out the data related to research problems, d) organizing the data. 6) The process of data analysis were: a) Reading the novel comprehensively, b) identifying and dividing the data, c) concluding data analysis. The result of this research revealed that kinds <b>of</b> <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> found in bad boy fan fiction based on Minderop’s Theory <b>of</b> <b>Point</b> <b>of</b> <b>View</b> were 1) Physical <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> that consisted <b>of</b> position of place and position of time; 2) Mental <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> that showed the character being brave, steadfast, honest, supportive, and patient; 3) Personal <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> which showed that the author used second person <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> in narrating the story so that the reader could feel as if she was the one experiencing the events in the story during the process of reading the story. The advantages <b>of</b> second person <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> used in Bad Boy fan fiction based on the interview conducted towards the author were, 1) Second person <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> makes the reader becomes more than an observer, 2) Second person <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> gives new different experience, 3) Second person <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>view</b> lets the reader question the story in a more personal way...|$|R

5|$|The novella {{illustrates}} the differences perspectives can make. The stories {{told in the}} Odyssey by Nestor and Menelaus to Telemachus, and Odysseus to a Scherian court make Odysseus into a hero as he fights monsters and seduces goddesses. According to Penelope in The Penelopiad, Odysseus was a liar who drunkenly fought a one-eyed bartender then boasted it was a giant cannibalistic cyclops. Homer portrays Penelope as loyal, patient, and the ideal wife, as he contrasts her to Clytemnestra who killed Agamemnon upon his return from Troy. In The Penelopiad, Penelope feels compelled {{to tell her story}} because she is unsatisfied with Homer's portrayal of her and the other myths about her sleeping with the suitors and giving birth to Pan. She rejects the role of the ideal wife and admits she was just trying to survive. The Odyssey makes the maids into traitors who consort with the suitors. From the maids' perspective, they were innocent victims, used by Penelope to spy, raped and abused by the suitors, and then murdered by Odysseus and Telemachus. Atwood shows the truth occupies a third position between the myths and the biased <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b>|$|E

He had always been a great admirer of animation and was impressed after being shown a direct-to-DVD computer-animated short film that Cory had made called Wobots. He suggested the possibility of producing an animated feature with them that would tell a familiar story with a twist, and gave them a month to come up with a story idea. Kanbar had expressed interest in Cinderella or Pinocchio, but the Edwards brothers did not like these ideas as they had already been done by Walt Disney. A few days after the brothers' initial meeting with Kanbar, Todd found inspiration in non-linear crime dramas, such as Rashomon, Pulp Fiction, Run Lola Run, and Memento and came up with the idea of telling the fairy tale Little Red Riding Hood as a police investigation, using multiple <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>view.</b>|$|E
