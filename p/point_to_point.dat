5|$|New Forest ponies are raced in {{an annual}} <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> {{meeting in the}} Forest, usually on Boxing Day, {{finishing}} at a different place each year. The races {{do not have a}} fixed course, but instead are run across the open Forest, so competitors choose their own routes around obstructions such as inclosures (forestry plantations), fenced paddocks, and bogs. Riders with a detailed knowledge of the Forest are thus at an advantage. The location of the meeting place is given to competitors on the previous evening, and the starting point of the race is revealed once riders have arrived at the meeting point.|$|E
5|$|It is {{important}} not to over-interpret these diagrams. Nothing is implied about how a particle gets from one point to another. The diagrams do not imply that the particles are moving in straight or curved lines. They do not imply that the particles are moving with constant speeds. The fact that the photon is often represented, by convention, by a wavy line and not a straight one does not imply that it is thought that it is more wavelike than is an electron. The images are just symbols to represent the actions above: photons and electrons do, somehow, move from <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> and electrons, somehow, emit and absorb photons. The theory does not explain how these things happen, but it does tell us the probabilities of these things happening in various situations.|$|E

25|$|The {{scale of}} the field can be redefined to absorb the {{coefficient}} A, and then {{it is clear that}} A only determines the overall scale of fluctuations. The ultralocal model describes the long wavelength high temperature behavior of the Ising model, since in this limit the fluctuation averages are independent from <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point.</b>|$|E

40|$|We {{present a}} {{probabilistic}} framework for matching of point clouds. Variants of the ICP algorithm typically pair <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>points</b> or <b>points</b> <b>to</b> lines. Instead, we pair data <b>points</b> <b>to</b> probability functions that are {{thought of having}} generated the data points. Then an energy function is derived from a maximum likelihood formulation. Each such distribution {{is a mixture of}} a bivariate Normal Distribution to capture the local structure of points and an explicit outlier term to achieve robustness. We apply our approach to the SLAM problem in robotics using a 2 D laser range scanner...|$|R

25|$|The town of Newmarket is the {{headquarters}} of British horseracing – home to the largest cluster of training yards {{in the country and}} many key horse racing organisations including the National Stud, and Newmarket Racecourse. Tattersalls bloodstock auctioneers and the National Horseracing Museum are also in the town. <b>Point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> racing takes place at Higham and Ampton.|$|E
25|$|Riemannian {{geometry}} is {{the branch}} of differential geometry that studies Riemannian manifolds, smooth manifolds with a Riemannian metric, i.e. with an inner product on the tangent space at each point that varies smoothly from <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point.</b> This gives, in particular, local notions of angle, length of curves, surface area and volume. From those, some other global quantities can be derived by integrating local contributions.|$|E
25|$|In any dimension, the Ising {{model can}} be productively {{described}} by a locally varying mean field. The field {{is defined as the}} average spin value over a large region, but not so large so as to include the entire system. The field still has slow variations from <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point,</b> as the averaging volume moves. These fluctuations in the field are described by a continuum field theory in the infinite system limit.|$|E

25|$|A Finsler {{manifold}} {{allows the}} definition of distance but {{does not require the}} concept of angle; it is an analytic manifold in which each tangent space is equipped with a norm, ||·||, in a manner which varies smoothly from <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point.</b> This norm can be extended to a metric, defining the length of a curve; but it cannot in general be used to define an inner product.|$|E

25|$|Attempts {{have been}} made to promote isospin from a global to a local symmetry. In 1954, Chen Ning Yang and Robert Mills {{suggested}} that the notion of protons and neutrons, which are continuously rotated into each other by isospin, should be allowed to vary from <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point.</b> To describe this, the proton and neutron direction in isospin space must be defined at every point, giving local basis for isospin. A gauge connection would then describe how to transform isospin along a path between two points.|$|E
25|$|Sir Alec Douglas-Home gave Hughes-Young a {{hereditary}} peerage in {{his resignation}} honours list. He took the title Baron St Helens, of St Helens in the County palatine of Lancashire. His maiden speech on 10 March 1965 was on immigration; {{a month later}} he called {{for some of the}} commons on the outskirts of London to be used for temporary housing. He opposed the Bill to suspend the use of capital punishment. In March 1970 his elder son Patrick died from injuries received in <b>Point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point</b> racing.|$|E
25|$|To measure {{distances}} and angles on manifolds, the manifold must be Riemannian. A 'Riemannian manifold' is a differentiable manifold {{in which each}} tangent space is equipped with an inner product ⟨⋅,⋅⟩ in a manner which varies smoothly from <b>point</b> <b>to</b> <b>point.</b> Given two tangent vectors u and v, the inner product ⟨u,v⟩ gives a real number. The dot (or scalar) product is a typical example of an inner product. This allows one to define various notions such as length, angles, areas (or volumes), curvature and divergence of vector fields.|$|E
