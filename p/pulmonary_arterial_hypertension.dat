However, driven by recent intense research efforts, topical treatments {{are starting to}} show benefits for <b>pulmonary</b> <b>hypertension,</b> <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension,</b> atherosclerosis, ischemia-reperfusion injury, heart failure, peptic ulcer, and acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. The beneficial effects of sulphurous mineral waters, sulphurous mud, or peloids made from sulphurous mineral water {{have been attributed to}} the presence of sulphur mainly in the form of hydrogen sulphide. This form is largely available in conditions of low pH when oxygen concentrations are also low. In the organism, small amounts of hydrogen sulphide are produced by some cells where they have numerous biological signalling functions. While high levels of hydrogen sulphide are extremely toxic, enzymes in the body are capable of detoxifying it by oxidation to harmless sulphate. Hence, low levels of hydrogen sulphide may be tolerated indefinitely. In this paper, we review the chemistry and actions of hydrogen sulphide in sulphurous mineral waters and its natural role in body physiology.

Early detection of PAH through routine screening improves survival in patients with SSc. Right heart catheterization is mandatory to diagnose PAH. SSc-PAH patients should be managed by a multidisciplinary team comprising of rheumatologist, pulmonologist, cardiologist, and physiotherapist. Various pharmacotherapy options to treat SSc-PAH are derived from the idiopathic PAH management. Upfront or sequential combination therapy of PAH-specific drugs seems to confer a clinical benefit compared to monotherapy.

40|$|Arginase metabolizes the semi-essential {{amino acid}} L-arginine to L-ornithine and urea. There are two {{distinct}} isoforms of arginase, arginase I and II, which are encoded by separate genes and display differences in tissue distribution, subcellular localization, and molecular regulation. Blood vessels express both arginase I and II but their distribution appears to be cell-, vessel-, and species-specific. Both isoforms of arginase are induced by numerous pathologic stimuli and contribute to vascular cell dysfunction and vessel wall remodeling in several diseases. Clinical and experimental studies have documented increases in the expression and/or activity of arginase I or II in blood vessels following arterial injury and in <b>pulmonary</b> and <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension,</b> aging, and atherosclerosis. Significantly, pharmacological inhibition or genetic ablation of arginase in animals ameliorates abnormalities in vascular cells and normalizes blood vessel architecture and function {{in all of these}} pathological states. The detrimental effect of arginase in vascular remodeling is attributable to its ability to stimulate vascular smooth muscle cell and endothelial cell proliferation, and collagen deposition by promoting the synthesis of polyamines and L-proline, respectively. In addition, arginase adversely impacts arterial remodeling by directing macrophages towards an inflammatory phenotype. Moreover, the proliferative, fibrotic, and inflammatory actions of arginase in the vasculature are further amplified by its capacity to inhibit nitric oxide synthesis by competing with nitric oxide synthase for substrate, L-arginine. Pharmacologic or molecular approaches targeting specific isoforms of arginase represent a promising strategy in treating obstructive fibroproliferative vascular disease...|$|R

ObjectivesThis {{study sought to}} determine whether metabolite profiling could identify plasma signatures of right ventricular-pulmonary vascular (RV-PV) dysfunction. MethodsWe measured plasma concentrations of 105 metabolites using targeted mass spectrometry in 71 individuals (discovery cohort) who underwent comprehensive physiological assessment with right-sided heart catheterization and radionuclide ventriculography at rest and during exercise. Our findings were validated in a second cohort undergoing invasive hemodynamic evaluations (nÂ = 71), {{as well as in}} an independent cohort with or without known <b>pulmonary</b> <b>arterial</b> (PA) <b>hypertension</b> (nÂ = 30). ResultsIn the discovery cohort, 21 metabolites were associated with 2 or more hemodynamic indicators of RV-PV function (i. e., resting right atrial pressure, mean PA pressure, pulmonary vascular resistance [PVR], and PVR and PA pressure-flow response [Î”PQ] during exercise). We identified novel associations of RV-PV dysfunction with circulating indoleamine 2, 3 -dioxygenase (IDO) â€“dependent tryptophan metabolites (TMs), tricarboxylic acid intermediates, and purine metabolites and confirmed previously described associations with arginineâ€“nitric oxide metabolic pathway constituents. IDO-TM levels were inversely related to RV ejection fraction and were particularly well correlated with exercise PVR and Î”PQ. Multisite sampling demonstrated transpulmonary release of IDO-TMs. IDO-TMs also identified RV-PV dysfunction in a validation cohort with known risk factors for pulmonary {{hypertension and}} in patients with established PA hypertension.

40|$|Introduction. Amiodarone, an {{antiarrhythmic}} drug, {{which contains}} iodine compound, {{has a tendency}} to accumulate in some organs including the lungs. This is age, drug dosage and therapy duration dependent. Case Outline. We present a case of a 73 -year-old man, a smoker, who was admitted as emergency case due to severe dyspnea, tachypnea with signs of cyanosis and respiratory insufficiency. Chest x-ray revealed bilateral diffuse pulmonary shadows in the middle and upper parts of the lungs, similar to those in tuberculosis. His illness history showed chronic obstructive <b>pulmonary</b> disease, <b>arterial</b> <b>hypertension,</b> and atrial fibrillation which has been treated with amiodarone for six years. Sputum smears were negative for mycobacteria, and by the diagnostic elimination method for specific, non-specific and malignant disease the diagnosis of amiodarone pulmonary toxicity was made. Fiberoptic bronchoscopy and pathohistological findings of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia confirmed the diagnosis. As the first therapeutic approach, amiodarone therapy was stopped. Then, systemic therapy with methylprednisolone 21 (sodium succinate) 40 mg i. v. daily during the first two weeks was initiated and continued with daily dose of methylprednisolone 30 mg orally during the next three months. The patient showed a marked subjective improvement during the first week, which was followed by the improvement of respiratory function and withdrawal of pulmonary changes with complete radiographic and CT resolution after eight months. Conclusion. Amiodarone pulmonary toxicity should be taken into consideration, especially in elderly patients with respiratory symptoms and pulmonary changes, even if only a low dose of amiodarone is administred over a longer time period...|$|R
