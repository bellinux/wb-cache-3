40|$|The very {{existence}} of the physical vacuum provides a framework to propose a general mechanism for propelling bodies through an agency of electromagnetic fields, that seat in that medium. When two sub-systems of a general closed device interact via nonlocal and retarded electromagnetic pulses, it is easily shown that they give a nonzero force, and that only tend {{to comply with the}} action-to-reaction force in the limit of instantaneous interactions. The arrangement of sub-systems provide a handy way to optimize the unbalanced EM force with the concept of impedance matching. The general properties of the differential electromagnetic force (DEF) are the following: i) it is proportional to the square of the intensity and to the angular wave frequency ω; ii) to the space between the sub-systems (although in a non-linear manner); iii) it is inversely proportional to the speed of interaction; iv) when the two sub-systems are out-of-phase, DEF is null.

The study concluded:Any reader by now would have concluded the obvious - that the planes described above are the best poor concoctions, rather than expressions of something real.

The text and the drawings do not correlate with each other even thematically. The drawings definitely point to a knowledge of modern machinery. This can be explained on the basis of the fact that Shri Ellappa who made the drawings was in a local engineering college and was thus familiar with names and details of some machinery. Of course the text retains a structure in language and content from which its 'recent nature' cannot be asserted. We must hasten to point out that this does not imply an oriental nature of the text at all. All that may be said is that thematically the drawings ought to be ruled out of discussion.

40|$|The Ram Accelerator, a {{chemically}} propelled, impulsive mass launch system, {{is presented}} as a viable concept for directly launching acceleration-insensitive payloads into low Earth orbit. The <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>propulsion</b> are based on those of an airbreathing supersonic ramjet. The payload vehicle acts as the ramjet centerbody and travels through a fixed launch tube that acts as the ramjet outer cowling. The launch tube is filled with premixed gaseous fuel and oxidizer mixtures that combust {{at the base of the}} vehicle and produce thrust. Two modes <b>of</b> in-tube <b>propulsion</b> involving ramjet cycles are used in sequence to accelerate the vehicle from 0. 7 km/sec to 9 km/sec. Requirements for placing a 2000 kg vehicle into a 500 -km circular orbit, with a minimum amount of onboard rocket propellant for orbital maneuvers, are examined. It is shown that in-tube propulsion requirements dictate a launch tube length of 5. 1 km to achieve an exit velocity of 9 km/sec, with peak accelerations not to exceed 1000 g's. Aerodynamic heating due to atmospheric transit requires minimal ablative protection and the vehicle retains a large percentage of its exit velocity. An indirect orbital insertion maneuver with aerobraking and two apogee burns is examined to minimize the required onboard propellant mass. An appropriate onboard propulsion system design to perform the required orbital maneuvers with minimum mass requirements is also determined. The structural designs of both the launch tube and the payload vehicle are examined using simple structural and finite element analysis for various materials...|$|R

40|$|The ram {{accelerator}} mass launch {{system has been}} proposed to greatly reduce the costs of placing acceleration-insensitive payloads into low earth orbit. The {{ram accelerator}} is a chemically propelled, impulsive mass launch system capable of efficiently accelerating relatively large masses from velocities of 0. 7 km/sec to 10 km/sec. The <b>principles</b> <b>of</b> <b>propulsion</b> are based on those of a conventional supersonic air-breathing ramjet; however the device operates in a somewhat different manner. The payload carrying vehicle resembles the center-body of the ramjet and accelerates through a stationary tube which acts as the outer cowling. The tube is filled with premixed gaseous fuel and oxidizer mixtures that burn {{in the vicinity of}} the vehicle's base, producing a thrust which accelerates the vehicle through the tube. This study examines the requirement for placing a 2000 kg vehicle into a 500 km circular orbit with a minimum amount of on-board rocket propellant for orbital maneuvers. The goal is to achieve a 50 pct payload mass fraction. The proposed design requirements have several self-imposed constraints that define the vehicle and tube configurations. Structural considerations on the vehicle and tube wall dictate an upper acceleration limit of 1000 g's and a tube inside diameter of 1. 0 m. In-tube propulsive requirements and vehicle structural constraints result in a vehicle diameter of 0. 76 m, a total length of 7. 5 m and a nose-cone half angle of 7 degrees. An ablating nose-cone constructed from carbon-carbon composite serves as the thermal protection mechanism for atmospheric transit...|$|R

The problem is solved by applying the general theory for oscillating deformable airfoils. The thrust, power required, and the energy imparted to the wake are calculated, and the propulsive efficiency is also evaluated.

40|$|Interplanet and {{interstellar}} travels require long-term <b>propulsion</b> <b>of</b> spacecrafts, {{whereas the}} conventional schemes <b>of</b> <b>propulsion</b> {{are limited by}} the velocity of the ejected mass. In this study, alpha particles released by nuclear decay are considered as a potential solution for long-time acceleration. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> near-light-speed particle <b>propulsion</b> (NcPP) was elucidated and the stopping and range of ions in matter (SRIM) was Used to predict theoretical accelerations. The results show that NcPP by means of alpha decay is feasible for long-term spacecraft propulsion and posture adjustment in space. A practical NcPP sail can achieve a speed > 150 km/s and reach the brink {{of the solar system}} faster than a mass equivalent solar sail. Finally, to significantly improve the NcPP sail, the hypothesis of stimulated acceleration of nuclear decay (SAND) was proposed, which may shorten the travel time to Mars to within 20 days.

25|$|Rocket engines {{employ the}} <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> jet <b>propulsion.</b> The rocket engines {{powering}} rockets {{come in a}} great variety of different types; a comprehensive list can be found in rocket engine. Most current rockets are chemically powered rockets (usually internal combustion engines, but some employ a decomposing monopropellant) that emit a hot exhaust gas. A rocket engine can use gas propellants, solid propellant, liquid propellant, or a hybrid mixture of both solid and liquid. Some rockets use heat or pressure that is supplied from a source other than the chemical reaction of propellant(s), such as steam rockets, solar thermal rockets, nuclear thermal rocket engines or simple pressurized rockets such as water rocket or cold gas thrusters. With combustive propellants a chemical reaction is initiated between the fuel and the oxidizer in the combustion chamber, and the resultant hot gases accelerate out of a rocket engine nozzle (or nozzles) at the rearward-facing end of the rocket. The acceleration of these gases through the engine exerts force ("thrust") on the combustion chamber and nozzle, propelling the vehicle (according to Newton's Third Law). This actually happens because the force (pressure times area) on the combustion chamber wall is unbalanced by the nozzle opening; {{this is not the case}} in any other direction. The shape of the nozzle also generates force by directing the exhaust gas along the axis of the rocket.|$|R

Inspired by the oar-like legs of water beetles, designing a robot that swims under the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> drag-powered <b>propulsion</b> can lead to highly agile mobility. But its motion can easily be discontinuous and jerky due to backward motions (i. e. retraction) of the legs. Here we proposed novel hair-like appendages and consider their coordination to achieve steady and efficient swimming on the water surface. First of all, we propose several design schemes and fabrication methods of the hair-like appendages, which can passively adjust their projected area while obtaining enough thrust. The coordination between the two pairs of legs, as with water beetles in nature, were also investigated to achieve steady swimming without backward movement by varying the beating frequency and phase of the legs. To verify the functionality of the hair-like appendages and their coordinations, six different types of appendages were fabricated, and two robots (one with {{a single pair of}} legs and the other with two pairs of legs) were built. Locomotion of the robots was extensively compared through experiments, and it was found that steady swimming was achieved by properly coordinating the two pairs of legs without sacrificing their speed. Also, owing to the lower velocity fluctuation during swimming, it was shown that using two pairs of legs was more energy efficient than the robot with single pair of legs...|$|R

40|$|Dimensionless {{numbers are}} {{important}} in biomechanics because their constancy can imply dynamic similarity between systems, despite possible differences in medium or scale. A dimensionless parameter that describes the tail or wing kinematics of swimming and flying animals is the Strouhal number, St = fA/U, which divides stroke frequency (f) and amplitude (A) by forward speed (U). St is known to govern a well-defined series of vortex growth and shedding regimes for airfoils undergoing pitching and heaving motions. Propulsive efficiency is high over a narrow range of St and usually peaks within the interval 0. 2 < St < 0. 4 (refs 3 - 8). Because natural selection is likely to tune animals for high propulsive efficiency, we expect it to constrain the range of St that animals use. This seems to be true for dolphins, sharks and bony fish, which swim at 0. 2 < St < 0. 4. Here we show that birds, bats and insects also converge on the same narrow range of St, but only when cruising. Tuning cruise kinematics to optimize St therefore {{seems to be a}} general <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> oscillatory lift-based <b>propulsion...</b>|$|R

40|$|In {{the last}} decades the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> laser <b>propulsion</b> has been {{demonstrated}} by several laboratory experiments all over the world. The primary goal of these investigations was the development of alternative launch concepts for very small satellites (nanosats) from earth’s surface to low earth orbits (LEO). Unfortunately, it turned out, that the required laser power will not be available in near future. The rapid progress {{in the field of}} solid-state laser technology triggered the development of powerful compact pulsed laser sources even for applications in zero gravity environments and space. Equipped with this new laser sources laser propulsion technology offers new concepts for position keeping and attitude control of satellites or satellite constellations in orbit. Beam control with active and adaptive optical systems enables long range or remote laser propulsion. A future step may be space missions with sampling probes to asteroids or small planets and the return on a tractor beam. Today, the main objective is the development and evaluation of precise laser thrusters in the range from 0. 1 µN to 1 mN. Alternative micro propulsion concepts are absolutely essential for many missions with precise attitude and orbit control. There is a growing demand due to geodesic missions measuring earth’s gravity (successors of CHAMP, GRACE or GOCE), x-ray astronomy with telescopes built out of 2 satellites with highly constant distance, and astronomical missions with arrays of telescopes in a synthetic aperture architecture (Darwin). Due to its high precision and the simple (propellant) infrastructure laser propulsion is an ideal technology for micro thrusters. Precise adjustable thrust can be generated by laser induced ablation of metals or composites with pulsed laser sources.
