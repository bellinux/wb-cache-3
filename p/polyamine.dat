5|$|Suicide {{inhibition}} is {{an unusual}} type of irreversible inhibition where the enzyme converts the inhibitor into a reactive form in its active site. An example is the inhibitor of <b>polyamine</b> biosynthesis, α-difluoromethylornithine or DFMO, which is an analogue of the amino acid ornithine, and is used to treat African trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness). Ornithine decarboxylase can catalyse the decarboxylation of DFMO instead of ornithine, as shown above. However, this decarboxylation reaction {{is followed by the}} elimination of a fluorine atom, which converts this catalytic intermediate into a conjugated imine, a highly electrophilic species. This reactive form of DFMO then reacts with either a cysteine or lysine residue in the active site to irreversibly inactivate the enzyme.|$|E

40|$|Summary. The {{available}} information on plant <b>polyamines</b> is reviewed. The polycationic character of <b>polyamines</b> is suggested as a rationale of their properties and functions. Different aspects of <b>polyamines</b> are examined: chemistry, occurrence, localization, uptake, transport, interactions with nucleic acids, proteins, membranes and cell walls, and role in maintaining of pH, ion and osmotic cell homeostasis. The biosynthetic and catabolic pathways of <b>polyamines</b> and {{their relation to}} the overall metabolism, especially to the alcaloid formation, are outlined. The physiological functions of <b>polyamines</b> are discussed, namely their involvement in cell cycle, cell division, growth, development, senescence, {{as well as in}} stress phenomena. Alternative views on <b>polyamines</b> as a new class of plant growth regulators or second messengers are presented. An emphasis is laid on the phenylamides (conjugates of <b>polyamines</b> and hydroxy cinnamic acids) as specific plant molecules with regulatory and radical scavenging properties. The possibilities for practical application of <b>polyamines</b> are concerned...|$|R
40|$|Extraction {{of whole}} cells of Salmonella typhimurium and Escherichia coli with 1 M NaCl {{released}} 8 to 13 % {{of their total}} cellular <b>polyamines</b> (putrescine, cadaverine, and spermidine). This extraction did not cause significant cell lysis, release of outer membrane (OM) constituents, or leakage of periplasmic beta-lactamase. The extraction released nearly equal amounts of <b>polyamines</b> from mdo (membrane-derived oligosaccharide) mutants and wild type. These {{findings suggest that the}} released <b>polyamines</b> are apparently bound to the cell envelope. NaCl (1 M) was as effective as trichloroacetic acid in releasing <b>polyamines</b> from isolated OM and lipopolysaccharide (LPS). Isolated OM contained four times more <b>polyamines</b> than the cytoplasmic membrane. The increased binding to the OM is apparently due to the association of <b>polyamines</b> with the polyanionic LPS. Nearly identical amounts of <b>polyamines</b> were found in the OM and LPS preparations (as quantified per milligram of LPS). These amounts are equal to those released from the intact cells by 1 M NaCl (quantitation as above). However, redistribution of <b>polyamines</b> took place after cell disruption, because the relative proportions of different <b>polyamines</b> varied in the OM and LPS preparations. These results indicate that <b>polyamines</b> released from intact cells during 1 M NaCl extraction are preferentially derived from the OM...|$|R
2500|$|In the mid-1960s, {{the role}} of tRNA in protein {{synthesis}} was being intensively studied. [...] At this point, ribosomes had been implicated in protein synthesis, {{and it had been}} shown that an mRNA strand was necessary for the formation of these structures. [...] In a 1964 publication, Warner and Rich showed that ribosomes active in protein synthesis contained tRNA molecules bound at the A and P sites, and discussed the notion that these molecules aided in the peptidyl transferase reaction. However, despite considerable biochemical characterization, the structural basis of tRNA function remained a mystery. [...] In 1965, Holley et al. purified and sequenced the first tRNA molecule, initially proposing that it adopted a cloverleaf structure, based largely on the ability of certain regions of the molecule to form stem loop structures. The isolation of tRNA proved to be the first major windfall in RNA structural biology. [...] Following Robert W. Holley's publication, numerous investigators began work on isolation tRNA for crystallographic study, developing improved methods for isolating the molecule as they worked. [...] By 1968 several groups had produced tRNA crystals, but these proved to be of limited quality and did not yield data at the resolutions necessary to determine structure. In 1971, Kim et al. achieved another breakthrough, producing crystals of yeast tRNAPHE that diffracted to 2-3 Ångström resolutions by using spermine, a naturally occurring <b>polyamine,</b> which bound to and stabilized the tRNA. [...] Despite having suitable crystals, however, the structure of tRNAPHE was not immediately solved at high resolution; rather it took pioneering work in the use of heavy metal derivatives and a good deal more time to produce a high-quality density map of the entire molecule. [...] In 1973, Kim et al. produced a 4 Ångström map of the tRNA molecule in which they could unambiguously trace the entire backbone. [...] This solution would be followed by many more, as various investigators worked to refine the structure and thereby more thoroughly elucidate the details of base pairing and stacking interactions, and validate the published architecture of the molecule.|$|E

Here we investigated the effects of <b>polyamines</b> on ion channel activities by applying patch-clamp techniques to protoplasts derived from barley (Hordeum vulgare) seedling root cells.

Together, by restricting Na+ influx into roots and by preventing K+ loss from shoots, <b>polyamines</b> were shown to improve K+/Na+ homeostasis in barley seedlings.
