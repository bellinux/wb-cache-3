40|$|In this paper, {{water vapor}} up to 41 % {{is added to}} an argon {{dielectric}} barrier discharge at medium pressure to profoundly investigate the effect of water vapor addition on the surface modification of polyethylene (<b>PE).</b> <b>Contact</b> angle measurements show that the wettability of PE significantly increases after a pure argon plasma treatment. However, the addition of water vapor to the argon feeding gas can give an extra 30 % decrease in water contact angle. This extra decrease {{is due to the}} incorporation of additional oxygen containing groups such as CO, CO, OCO, and OCO. AFM results reveal that the surface roughness of PE only increases for plasma treatments with no or low water vapor concentrations. All this indicates that a water vapor based plasma can be an excellent tool for the surface activation of PE...|$|E
40|$|The cotton {{bollworm}} (CBW) Helicoverpa armigera {{and to a}} lesser extent plant bugs (PB) (Hemiptera: Miridae) are important pests of cotton in Africa. For sustainability reasons, it is necessary to reduce use of chemical control measures for these pests. A promising alternative to chemical control of both CBW and PB is trap cropping, assisted with botanical pesticides sprays, if needed. We report studies conducted from 1995 – 98 on sorghum attractiveness to PB and CBW, on the potential of physic nut (Jatropha curcas) extracts [particularly the phorbol ester (PE) fraction of the oil] for sorghum protection fromPB damage, and on the insecticidal activity of Jatropha extracts on CBW. At the ICRISAT research station (Samanko, Mali), infestation by the five main species of PB (accounting for 96 % of total) was much higher on sorghum than on cotton. In the Kolokani region, CBW infestation was negligible on the Guinea loose-panicled sorghum cultivar Bibalawili, while it was significant on both compact-panicled PB susceptible ICSH 89002 and PB resistant Malisor 84 - 7. At Samanko, Jatropha oil application on sorghum panicles showed some effect on PB when damage level was high, better than Jatropha and neem aqueous extracts. However, it did not compete with pyrethroid protection level. <b>PE</b> <b>contact</b> toxicity on CBW larvae was too low to determine a LC 50. Aningestion insecticidal activity of PE was found on all tested larval instars. Contact toxicity LC 50 of PE on eggs was 1. 66 g ml- 1. Development of larvae and reproductive ability of adults derived from new-laid eggs treated with solutions of 0. 35 g ml- 1 PE and above were considerably affected. Prospects for using sorghum and Jatropha extracts for cotton protection against insect pests in an assisted trap-cropping strategy are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of the local anesthetics tetracaine (TTC) and procaine (PRC) on bilayers of specifically deuterated phosphatidylethanolamines (PE) has been studied by 2 H and: 1 ip NMR. Dimyristoylphosphatidylethanolamines (DMPE), deuterated at positions 2, 4, and 14 ofthe sn- 2 chain, position 2 ofthe sn-i chain, and in the ethanolamine headgroup, were mixed 1 : 1 with a semisynthetic egg PE {{and the effect of}} measured quantities of TTC and PRC on the 2 H quadrupole splittings, spin-lattice relaxation times, and 31 P chemical shift anisotropy were observed. Experiments were performed at pH 5. 5, when the anesthetics are primarily charged, and at pH 9. 5, when they are uncharged. Tetracaine was observed to disorder the hydrocarbon region of the bilayer and to induce a confor-mational change in the PE headgroup. Conversely, procaine had little or no effect on the hydrocarbon region and induced only a small change in the headgroup. These confor-mational changes and disordering effects, when adjusted for anesthetic partitioning, are essentially independent of the charge on the anesthetic. However, at pH 5. 5 and low TTC/PE molar ratios (< 0. 1), the 2 H NMR spectra showed two lipid environments-one corresponding to free PE and the other to <b>PE</b> in <b>contact</b> with TTC. Continued addition of TTC resulted in the eventual disappearance ofthe free PE signal and the corresponding growth of the signal from <b>PE</b> in <b>contact</b> with TTC. At pH 9. 5, when TTC is uncharged, only one signal is observed. This indicates that at low pH, when TTC is primarily charged, it has a much slower rate of lateral diffusion in the PE bilayer. In mixtures of PE and phosphatidylserine, a conformational change in the headgroup was noted which was similar to that seen in the pure PE; however, there was no evidence for slow lateral diffusion of the anesthetics. The effects of TTC and PRC on the PE bilayer, when combined with our earlier study of the labeled anesthetics [Kelusky, E. C., and I. C. P. Smith, Biochemistry, 22 : 6011 - 6017 (1983) ], indicate that TTC penetrates into the hydrocarbon portion of the bilayer whereas PRC sits only in the headgroup region...|$|R
40|$|Haematopoietic {{progenitor}} cells (HPC) traffic {{between the}} circulation and the bone marrow. Through contact with osteoblasts {{in the bone}} marrow niche, their survival, maintenance and proliferation is regulated. This review summarizes recent observations regarding the interaction between osteoblasts and HPCs, and the resulting downstream effects on signaling and niche maintenance. Using live imaging, amongst other techniques, HPCs were found to make prolonged contact with the osteoblast, via a specialized region of their membrane with high expression of prominin 1, CD 63 and rhodamine <b>PE.</b> Following <b>contact,</b> portions of the HPC membrane expressing these molecules were phagocytosed by the osteoblast into SARA-positive signaling-endosomes. In response, Smad signaling was downregulated in the osteoblasts, leading to increased production of SDF- 1; a chemokine involved in progenitor cell homing to the bone marrow, and thus regulating progenitor cell trafficking. The study summarised here presents important findings regarding progenitor cell trafficking, maintenance, proliferation and survival in the bone marrow and potentially other niche microenvironments, following signaling events initiated and propagated through single cell interactions...|$|R
40|$|The two-century old {{theory of}} Young and Laplace retains a {{powerful}} influence on surface and interface studies because it quantitatively predicts {{the height of}} rise of capillary liquids from the contact angles of drops. But the classical theory does not acknowledge that equilibrium requires separate minimization of partial free energies of one-component liquids bonded to immiscible solids. We generalize a theorem of Gibbs and Curie to obtain a partial equilibrium (PE) theory that does so and that also predicts the height of capillary rise from contact angles of drops. Published observations and our own measurements of contact angles of water bonded to glass and Teflon surfaces support the conclusion of <b>PE</b> theory that <b>contact</b> angles of meniscuses and of drops are different dependent variables. PE theory provides thermodynamic and kinetic guidance to nanoscale processes that the classical theory obscures, as illustrated by examples in our concluding section...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{high-pressure}} processing on mechanical and thermal properties of four complex packaging materials (polyethylenelethylene vinyl alcohol/ polyethylene: PEIEVOHIPE; metallized polyester/polyethylene: PETmetlPE; polyester/ polyethylene: PETIPE; polypropylene SiOx recovered: PPSiOx) was studied. Pouches {{of the different}} materials containing distilled water or olive oil as food simulants, as well as empty ones, were subjected to 400 MPa for 30 min, at temperatures of 20 or 60 °C. Delamination and wrinkling were a general consequence of the high-pressure processing of multilayer polymeric systems. However, no significant changes were observed regarding the mechanical properties of PE containing laminates after pressurization. PPSiOx underwent significant modifications as SiOx completely broke down. Neither thermal property was affected by pressure, {{as it was the}} processing temperature that induced tempering effects on the crystallization behaviour of polymeric components. Only PE/EVOH/ <b>PE,</b> when in <b>contact</b> with water as a simulant, presented a decrease in the melting point temperature. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Background and Purpose. Poststroke {{depression}} (PSD) is {{a common}} complication after stroke. There is no adequate treatment for PSD. This study examined efficacy of cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT) {{in the treatment of}} PSD among stroke survivors. Methods. An experimental design, 30 participants with poststroke depression were randomly assigned into 3 groups of cognitive rehabilitation therapy (CRT), psychoeducation (PE), and the control group (CG). CRT consisted of nine sessions with three-phased sessions focusing on activity stimulation, negative thoughts, and people <b>contacts,</b> <b>PE</b> consisted of nine sessions focusing on knowledge on stroke and poststroke depression, and the CG group was on the waiting list. The BDI scale was used for assessing PSD at posttest. Results. There was {{a significant difference in the}} efficacy of CRT, PE, and the CG on PSD, with CRT–CG mean difference of − 9. 4 [*]±[*] 3. 11 and PE–CG 1. 0 [*]±[*] 3. 83. Furthermore, stress was not a confounding variable on the efficacy of CRT. The type of therapy significantly influenced PSD at posttest, with the CRT having greater mean reduction to CG (− 11. 1 [*]±[*] 3. 1) than PE to the CG (3. 0 [*]±[*] 3. 8). Conclusions. Cognitive rehabilitation therapy significantly reduced poststroke depression. Hence, it should be integrated as an adjunct treatment of poststroke depression...|$|R
40|$|Cellular {{communication}} {{within a}} larger microenvironment is critical {{for a number of}} physiological processes. Within the bone marrow niche, direct cell communication between hematopoietic progenitor cells (HPCs) and osteoblasts provides essential cues for their proliferation and survival. While contact-dependent communication between HPCs and osteoblasts is known to be critical, the molecular pathways that govern this interaction are largely unclear. Moreover, the downstream events occurring at the HPC/osteoblast contact site remain uncharacterized, despite their major role in signaling and remodeling within the niche microenvironment. Using live cell imaging approaches, we found that intercellular transfer is a novel mode of cell communication within the bone marrow niche microenvironment. HPCs made prolonged contact with the osteoblast surface via a specialized membrane domain enriched in prominin 1, CD 63 and rhodamine <b>PE.</b> At the <b>contact</b> site, portions of the HPC specialized domain containing these molecules were taken up by the osteoblast and internalized into long-lived, SARA-positive, signaling endosomes. This resulted in the down-regulation of Smad signaling by the osteoblasts and a subsequent increase in the production of stromal-derived factor- 1 (SDF- 1), a chemokine responsible for HPC homing to bone marrow. These findings identify a novel mechanism involving intercellular transfer to signaling endosomes for targeted regulation of signaling and remodeling events within the osteoblastic niche microenvironment...|$|R
40|$|The Pulse Echo (PE) {{technique}} {{is a widely}} used ultrasonic non destructive testing technique to test materials by analyzing ultrasound echoes reflected from flaws and discontinuities. In conventional <b>PE</b> technique, called <b>contact</b> type <b>PE,</b> an ultrasonic transducer is in constant contact with a test piece, transmitting and receiving ultrasonic signals from the test specimen. The inherent shortcomings of PE are the need for; uniform couplant conditions, the ultrasonic transducer to remain {{in contact with the}} test object throughout the scan and a limitation to scan regular surfaced objects only. This paper provides for extending a system initially developed for <b>contact</b> type <b>PE,</b> to perform Immersion Testing (IT) which is a contactless pulse-echo inspection method with the probe and test piece separated by a predetermined volume of water of certain thickness. A computer controlled 3 -axis transducer position manipulator (motion frame) is constructed for assistance in conducting automated tests. The efficacy of immersion testing relies on the precise control of the motion of transducer. The existing immersion type motion controllers along with dedicated data acquisition and analysis system are quite expensive and are beyond the affordability of smaller ultrasonic labs. Hence the proposed system including the motion frame and Data Acquisition Unit (DAQ) can serve as a competent, low-cost and reliable IT system benefitting several small scale industries and labs...|$|R
40|$|The {{physiological}} and psychological conditions of subjects supplying blood for hemocompatibility tests significantly affect {{the behavior of}} platelets {{in terms of both}} adhesion and activation. The responses of platelets to a standard biomaterial, polyethylene (PE), were examined with blood collected from male rabbits both in basal conditions and after stress, Different media were utilized. First, platelet-rich plasma (PRP) was used to obtain a <b>PE</b> response to <b>contact</b> with platelets. Then platelets drawn from PRP were isolated and washed with Krebs-Ringer solution. One aliquot was suspended in serum (Pw-S) where fibrinogen was absent, another aliquot in Krebs-Ringer solution (Pw-KR) tin order to avoid the influence of the plasma proteins on platelets), and a third aliquot in the original plasma from which the platelets were drawn (Pw-PPP) tin order to restore the initial condition of the plasma but with washed platelets). The analysis of platelet adhesion and morphology was performed by Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM). Differences in platelet adhesion and morphology were observed with four different media in nonstressed animals, with Pw-PPP showing a higher number and Pw-S and PW-KR lower numbers. Platelet morphology indicated low levels of activation. The platelets drawn from stressed subjects could not be counted in either PRP or PPP medium because they were fully aggregated and adhered; in contrast, in Pw-KR and Pw-S, {{no significant differences were found}} with respect to nonstressed conditions, and there was little difference in platelet morphology. All of these factors underline the role of plasma proteins, in particular fibrinogen, in the stress-induced activation of platelet...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Protein {{topology}} representations such as residue contact {{maps are}} an important intermediate step towards ab initio prediction of protein structure. Although improvements have occurred over the last years, the problem of accurately predicting residue contact maps from primary sequences is still largely unsolved. Among {{the reasons for this}} are the unbalanced nature of the problem (with far fewer examples of contacts than non-contacts), the formidable challenge of capturing long-range interactions in the maps, the intrinsic difficulty of mapping one-dimensional input sequences into two-dimensional output maps. In order to alleviate these problems and achieve improved contact map predictions, in this paper we split the task into two stages: the prediction of a map's principal eigenvector (PE) from the primary sequence; the reconstruction of the contact map from the PE and primary sequence. Predicting the PE from the primary sequence consists in mapping a vector into a vector. This task is less complex than mapping vectors directly into two-dimensional matrices since the size of the problem is drastically reduced and so is the scale length of interactions that need to be learned. Results We develop architectures composed of ensembles of two-layered bidirectional recurrent neural networks to classify the components of the PE in 2, 3 and 4 classes from protein primary sequence, predicted secondary structure, and hydrophobicity interaction scales. Our predictor, tested on a non redundant set of 2171 proteins, achieves classification performances of up to 72. 6 %, 16 % above a base-line statistical predictor. We design a system for the prediction of contact maps from the predicted PE. Our results show that predicting maps through the PE yields sizeable gains especially for long-range contacts which are particularly critical for accurate protein 3 D reconstruction. The final predictor's accuracy on a non-redundant set of 327 targets is 35. 4 % and 19. 8 % for minimum contact separations of 12 and 24, respectively, when the top length/ 5 contacts are selected. On the 11 CASP 6 Novel Fold targets we achieve similar accuracies (36. 5 % and 19. 7 %). This favourably compares with the best automated predictors at CASP 6. Conclusion Our final system for contact map prediction achieves state-of-the-art performances, and may provide valuable constraints for improved ab initio prediction of protein structures. A suite of predictors of structural features, including the <b>PE,</b> and PE-based <b>contact</b> maps, is available at [URL]. </p...|$|R
