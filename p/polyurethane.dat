Male condoms are put on a man's erect penis and {{physically}} block ejaculated sperm from entering the body of a sexual partner. Modern condoms are most often made from latex, but some are made from other materials such as <b>polyurethane,</b> or lamb's intestine. Female condoms are also available, most often made of nitrile, latex or <b>polyurethane.</b> Male condoms have the advantage of being inexpensive, easy to use, and have few adverse effects. Making condoms available to teenagers does not appear to affect the age of onset of sexual activity or its frequency. In Japan about 80% of couples who are using birth control use condoms, while in Germany this number is about 25%, and in the United States it is 18%.|$|E

A set of four novel AB-type monomers was prepared via the use of environmentally benign thiol-ene chemistry. These AB-type monomers were self-polycondensed (with or without catalyst) in two ways: (a) the hydroxyl-acyl azide approach and (b) the melt transurethane method {{in order to obtain}} reasonably high molar mass <b>polyurethanes.</b> The resulting polymers were thoroughly characterized by NMR, SEC, DSC, TGA and MALDI-TOF mass spectroscopy. The MALDI-TOF analysis confirmed the formation of linear <b>polyurethanes</b> with a trace amount of macrocycles. All the <b>polyurethanes</b> exhibited fair thermal stability with no significant weight loss below 200 degrees C. The <b>polyurethanes</b> based on undecylenic acid as a monomer displayed a thermoplastic behavior with well-identified melting transitions.

5|$|The term {{track and}} field is {{intertwined}} with the stadiums that first hosted such competitions. The two basic features of a {{track and field}} stadium are the outer oval-shaped running track and an area of turf within this trackâ€”the field.

As the sport developed, the IAAF standardised the length to 400m and stated that the tracks must be split into six to eight running lanes. Precise widths for the lanes were established, as were regulations regarding the curvature of the track. Tracks made of flattened cinders were popular in the early 20th century but synthetic tracks became standard in the late 1960s. 3M's Tartan track (an all-weather running track of <b>polyurethane)</b> gained popularity after its use at the 1968 US Olympic Trials and the 1968 Summer Olympics and it began the process in which synthetic tracks became the standard for the sport.
