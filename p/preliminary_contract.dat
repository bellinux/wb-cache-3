2500|$|Most {{of foreigners}} {{arriving}} in Russia are seeking jobs. In many cases {{they have no}} <b>preliminary</b> <b>contracts</b> or other agreements with a local employer. A typical problem is the illegal status of many foreigners (i.e., they are not registered and have no identity papers), what deprives them of any social assistance (as of 2004) and often leads to their exploitation by the employer. Despite that, foreigner workers still benefit, what with seeming reluctance of regional authorities {{to solve the problem}} forms a sort of modus vivendi. As Gil-Robles noted, it's easy to imagine that illegal status of many foreigners creates grounds for corruption. [...] Illegal immigrants, even if they have spent several years in Russia may be arrested at any moment and placed in detention centres for illegal immigrants for further expulsion. As of 2004, living conditions in detention centers are very bad, and expulsion process lacks of funding, what may extend detention of immigrants for months or even years. Along with that, Gil-Robles detected a firm political commitment to find a satisfactory solution among authorities he spoke with.|$|R

The report further recommended an air force of [...] "fighting airplanes and bombers" [...] well beyond the numbers of airplanes providing auxiliary support of ground forces by observation.
