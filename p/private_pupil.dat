25|$|McClellan {{entered into}} the sophomore class at Yale {{at the age of}} sixteen and excelled in {{mathematics}} and published natural sciences articles in the American Journal of Science. In 1815, at age 18, he obtained his baccalaureate degree. He then took up the study of medicine, first with Thomas Hubbard of Pomfret, Connecticut, later Professor of Surgery of the Medical College of New Haven, with whom he remained one year. In 1817, he went to Philadelphia to attend medical lectures at the University of Pennsylvania, and to become the <b>private</b> <b>pupil</b> of John Syng Dorsey, Professor of Materia Medica, receiving his Doctor of Medicine degree in 1819.|$|E
25|$|Edward Jenner {{was born}} in Berkeley, England. At the age of 13, he was apprenticed to apothecary Daniel Ludlow and later surgeon George Hardwick in nearby Sodbury. He {{observed}} that people who caught cowpox while working with cattle were known not to catch smallpox. Jenner assumed a causal connection but the idea was not taken up at that time. From 1770 to 1772 Jenner received advanced training in London at St Georges Hospital and as the <b>private</b> <b>pupil</b> of John Hunter, then returned to set up practice in Berkeley. When a smallpox epidemic occurred he advised the local cattle workers to be inoculated, but they told him that their previous cowpox infection would prevent smallpox. This confirmed his childhood suspicion, and he studied cowpox further, presenting a paper on it to his local medical society.|$|E

500|$|Unlike many leading English composers, Britten was {{not known}} as a teacher, but in 1949 he {{accepted}} his only <b>private</b> <b>pupil,</b> Arthur Oldham, who studied with him for three years. Oldham made himself useful, acting as musical assistant and arranging Variations on a Theme by Frank Bridge for full orchestra for the Frederick Ashton ballet Le Rêve de Léonor (1949), but he later described the teacher–pupil relationship as [...] "beneficial five per cent to [...] and ninety-five per cent to me!" ...|$|E
500|$|Verdi set {{his sights}} on Milan, then the {{cultural}} capital of northern Italy, where he applied unsuccessfully to study at the Conservatory. Barezzi made arrangements for him to become a <b>private</b> <b>pupil</b> of , who had been maestro concertatore at La Scala, and who described Verdi's compositions as [...] "very promising." [...] Lavigna encouraged Verdi to take out a subscription to La Scala, where he heard Maria Malibran in operas by Gioachino Rossini and Vincenzo Bellini. Verdi began making connections in the Milanese world of music that were to stand him in good stead. These included an introduction by Lavigna to an amateur choral group, the Società Filarmonica, led by Pietro Massini. Attending the Società frequently in 1834, Verdi soon found himself functioning as rehearsal director (for Rossini's La cenerentola) and continuo player. It was Massini who encouraged him to write his first opera, originally titled Rocester, to a libretto by the journalist Antonio Piazza.|$|E

2500|$|Notable {{teachers}} at the Munich Academy of Fine Arts {{at the time were}} Carl Theodor von Piloty, Wilhelm von Diez, Ludwig von Löfftz and Wilhelm von Lindenschmit the Younger. In addition, Eckenfelder was the first <b>private</b> <b>pupil</b> of Heinrich von Zügel. The latter was also a pupil of Hölder; their relationship was a [...] "...mixture of teacher/pupil, friendship and father/son relationship." [...] Eckenfelder also had contact with his family on excursions to the Dachau Marsh for painting En plein air or on autumn visits to Zügel's home town of Murrhardt. Eckenfelder {{was not part of the}} class when Zügel began his academy career. The intensive teacherpupil relationship existed only in private gatherings and meetings. Zügel took an interest in Eckenfelder's economic situation. He tried to provide Eckenfelder with a professorship at the academy, but failed because of the latter's introversion. Both artists were members of the artists' society Allotria and in 1892 founding members of the Munich Secession. Eckenfelder showed two horse paintings at the founding exhibition in 1888, and at the exhibitions in 1896, 1899, 1903, 1906 and 1911.|$|E

6000|$|Both Mr. and Mrs. Peacocke were {{accustomed}} to dine with the boys at one, when Carstairs, being a <b>private</b> <b>pupil,</b> only had his lunch. But on this occasion she did not come into the dining-room. [...] "I don't think I can to-day," [...] she said, when he bade her to take courage, and not be altered more than she could help, in her outward carriage, by the misery of her present circumstances. [...] "I could not eat if I were there, {{and then they would}} look at me." ...|$|E
2500|$|Desiring {{to remain}} in Oxford, Newman then took <b>private</b> <b>pupils</b> and read for a {{fellowship}} at Oriel, then [...] "the acknowledged centre of Oxford intellectualism." [...] He was elected at Oriel on 12 April 1822. Edward Bouverie Pusey was elected {{a fellow of the}} same college in 1823.|$|R
60|$|After this {{he became}} tutor and fellow of his college, taking <b>private</b> <b>pupils,</b> {{and at the}} same time {{preparing}} for Holy Orders, not only by study of books, but by work among the poor, with whom his exceeding kindness and intense reality gave him especial influence at all times.|$|R
50|$|Rundall went on {{to publish}} another similar book and she made an income from taking on <b>private</b> <b>pupils.</b> She is not known to have any {{children}} {{but she was the}} aunt of ten children born to her sister and her husband Robert William Elliston who was a London theatre manager.|$|R
6000|$|That night Mrs. Wortle {{felt herself}} {{constrained}} {{to tell the}} whole story to her husband. It was indeed impossible for her to keep any secret from her husband. When Mary, in her younger years, had torn her frock or cut her finger, that was always told to the Doctor. If a gardener was seen idling his time, or a housemaid flirting with the groom, that certainly would be told to the Doctor. What comfort does a woman get out of her husband unless she may be allowed {{to talk to him about}} everything? When it had been first proposed that Lord Carstairs should come into the house as a <b>private</b> <b>pupil</b> she had expressed her fear to the Doctor,--because of Mary. The Doctor had ridiculed her fears, and this had been the result. Of course she must tell the Doctor. [...] "Oh, dear," [...] she said, [...] "what do you think has happened while we were up in London?" ...|$|E
6000|$|John Dryden, the poet's second son, {{was born}} in 1667, or 1668, was {{admitted}} a King's Scholar in Westminster in 1682, and elected to Oxford in 1685. Here he became a <b>private</b> <b>pupil</b> of the celebrated Obadiah Walker, Master of University College, a Roman Catholic. It seems probable that young Dryden became a convert to that faith before his father. His religion {{making it impossible for}} him to succeed in England, he followed his brother Charles to Rome, where he officiated as his deputy in the Pope's household. John Dryden translated the fourteenth Satire of Juvenal, published in his father's version, and wrote a comedy entitled, [...] "The Husband his own Cuckold," [...] acted in Lincoln's Inn Fields in 1696; Dryden, the father, furnishing a prologue, and Congreve an epilogue. In 1700-1, he made a tour through Sicily and Malta, and his journal was published in 1706. It seems odd, that in the whole course of his journal, he never mentions his father's name, nor makes the least allusion to his very recent death. John Dryden, the younger, died at Rome soon after this excursion.|$|E
60|$|His {{first step}} forward in life had arisen from his having been sent, while still very young, as a <b>private</b> <b>pupil</b> {{to the house of}} a clergyman, who was an old friend and {{intimate}} friend of his father's. This clergyman had one other, and only one other, pupil--the young Lord Lufton; and between the two boys, there had sprung up a close alliance. While they were both so placed, Lady Lufton had visited her son, and then invited young Robarts to pass his next holidays at Framley Court. This visit was made; and it ended in Mark going back to Exeter with a letter full of praise from the widowed peeress. She had been delighted, she said, in having such a companion for her son, and expressed a hope that the boys might remain together during the course of their education. Dr. Robarts was a man who thought much of the breath of peers and peeresses, and was by no means inclined to throw away any advantage which might arise to his child from such a friendship. When, therefore, the young lord was sent to Harrow, Mark Robarts went there also.|$|E

60|$|Of all {{the dancing}} academies that ever were established, {{there never was}} one more popular in its {{immediate}} vicinity than Signor Billsmethi’s, of the ‘King’s Theatre.’ It was not in Spring-gardens, or Newman-street, or Berners-street, or Gower-street, or Charlotte-street, or Percy-street, or any other of the numerous streets which have been devoted time out of mind to professional people, dispensaries, and boarding-houses; {{it was not in}} the West-end at all—it rather approximated to the eastern portion of London, being situated in the populous and improving neighbourhood of Gray’s-inn-lane. It was not a dear dancing academy—four-and-sixpence a quarter is decidedly cheap upon the whole. It was very select, the number of pupils being strictly limited to seventy-five, and a quarter’s payment in advance being rigidly exacted. There was public tuition and private tuition—an assembly-room and a parlour. Signor Billsmethi’s family were always thrown in with the parlour, and included in parlour price; that is to say, a <b>private</b> <b>pupil</b> had Signor Billsmethi’s parlour to dance in, and Signor Billsmethi’s family to dance with; and when he had been sufficiently broken in in the parlour, he began to run in couples in the assembly-room.|$|E
60|$|If {{some of the}} {{surrounding}} lodging-house keepers, as I have no doubt they did, disliked the little Duchess for the airs which she gave herself, as they averred; they must have envied her too her superior prosperity, for there was scarcely ever a card in her window, whilst those ensigns in her neighbours' houses would remain exposed to the flies and the weather, and disregarded by passers-by for months together. She had many regular customers, or what should be rather called constant friends. Deaf old Mr. Cricklade came every winter for fourteen years, and stopped until the hunting was over; an invaluable man, giving little trouble, passing all day on horseback, and all night over his rubber at the club. The Misses Barkham, Barkhambury, Tunbridge Wells, whose father had been at college with Mr. Honeyman, came regularly in June for sea air, letting Barkhambury for the summer season. Then, for many years, she had her nephew, as we have seen; and kind recommendations from the clergymen of Brighton, and a constant friend in the celebrated Dr. Goodenough of London, who had been her father's <b>private</b> <b>pupil,</b> and of his college afterwards, who sent his patients {{from time to time}} down to her, and his fellow-physician, Dr. H----, who on his part would never take any fee from Miss Honeyman, except a packet of India curry-powder, a ham cured as she only knew how to cure them, and once a year, or so, a dish of her tea.|$|E
60|$|DURING {{the last}} six months Mr. Peacocke's most {{intimate}} friend at Bowick, excepting of course his wife, {{had been one of the}} pupils at the school. The lad was one of the pupils, but could not be said to be one of the boys. He was the young Lord Carstairs, eldest son of Earl Bracy. He had been sent to Bowick now six years ago, with the usual purpose of progressing from Bowick to Eton. And from Bowick to Eton he had gone in due course. But there, things had not gone well with the young lord. Some school disturbance had taken place when he had been there about a year and a half, in which he was, or was supposed to have been, a ringleader. It was thought necessary, for the preservation of the discipline of the school, that a victim should be made;--and it was perhaps thought well, in order that the impartiality of the school might be made manifest, that the victim should be a lord. Earl Bracy was therefore asked to withdraw his son; and young Lord Carstairs, at the age of seventeen, was left to seek his education where he could. It had been, and still was, the Earl's purpose to send his son to Oxford, but there was now an interval of two years before that could be accomplished. During one year he was sent abroad to travel with a tutor, and was then reported to have been all that a well-conducted lad ought to be. He was declared to be quite worthy of all that Oxford would do for him. It was even suggested that Eton had done badly for herself in throwing off from her such a young nobleman. But though Lord Carstairs had done well with his French and German on the Continent, it would certainly be necessary that he should rub up his Greek and Latin before he went to Christ Church. Then a request was made to the Doctor to take him in at Bowick in some sort as a <b>private</b> <b>pupil.</b> After some demurring the Doctor consented. It was not his wont to run counter to earls who treated him with respect and deference. Earl Bracy had in a special manner been his friend, and Lord Carstairs himself had been a great favourite at Bowick. When that expulsion from Eton had come about, the Doctor had interested himself, and had declared that a very scant measure of justice had been shown to the young lord. He was thus in a measure compelled to accede to the request made to him, and Lord Carstairs was received back at Bowick, not without hesitation, but with a full measure of affectionate welcome. His bed-room was in the parsonage-house, and his dinner he took with the Doctor's family. In other respects he lived among the boys.|$|E
