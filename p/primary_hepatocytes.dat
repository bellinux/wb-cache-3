5000|$|<b>Primary</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> are {{commonly}} used in cell biological and biopharmaceutical research. In vitro model systems based on hepatocytes have been of great help {{to better understand the}} role of hepatocytes in (patho)physiological processes of the liver. In addition, pharmaceutical industry has heavily relied on the use of hepatocytes in suspension or culture to explore mechanisms of drug metabolism and even predict in vivo drug metabolism. For these purposes, hepatocytes are usually isolated from animal or human [...] whole liver or liver tissue by collagenase digestion, which is a two-step process. In the first step, the liver is placed in an isotonic solution, in which calcium is removed to disrupt cell-cell tight junctions by the use of a calcium chelating agent. Next, a solution containing collagenase is added to separate the hepatocytes from the liver stroma. This process creates a suspension of hepatocytes, which can be seeded in multi-well plates and cultured for many days or even weeks. For optimal results, culture plates should first be coated with an extracellular matrix (e.g. collagen, Matrigel) to promote hepatocyte attachment (typically within 1-3 hr after seeding) and maintenance of the hepatic phenotype. In addition, and overlay with an additional layer of extracellular matrix is often performed to establish a sandwich culture of hepatocytes. The application of a sandwich configuration supports prolonged maintenance of hepatocytes in culture. Freshly-isolated hepatocytes that are not used immediately can be cryopreserved and stored. They do not proliferate in culture. Hepatocytes are intensely sensitive to damage during the cycles of cryopreservation including freezing and thawing. Even after the addition of classical cryoprotectants there is still damage done while being cryopreserved. Nevertheless, recent cryopreservation and resuscitation protocols support application of cryopreserved hepatocytes for most biopharmaceutical applications.|$|E

Liver tissue was obtained from general surgical patients, and PHHs were isolated and maintained in culture. <b>Primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> cultures were challenged with various doses of lipopolysaccharide (LPS), and the inflammatory signal transcription cascade was determined by real-time PCR. In subsequent experiments, <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> cultures were challenged with LPS and insulin was added in various doses. Glucose was determined by colorimetric assays. PHHs treated with 100 μg/mL LPS showed a profound inflammatory reaction with increased expression of interleukin (IL) - 6, IL- 10, IL- 1 β, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), and signal transducer and activator of transcription 5 (STAT- 5). Insulin at 10 IU/mL significantly decreased IL- 6, TNF, and IL- 1 β at pretranslational levels, an effect associated with decreased STAT- 5 mRNA expression (P < 0. 05). Glucose concentration and cellular metabolic activity were not different between controls and insulin-treated cells.

We hypothesized that the hepatocyte response to IFN signalling is context-dependent, and that specific growth factors, via phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase (PI(3) K) and protein kinase B/Akt signalling pathways, confer a cytoprotective effect. We established an in vitro model of IFNγ-mediated <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> injury.

Following turpentine injection, increased serum levels of C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A protein, haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin, and decreased concentrations of albumin were observed. In contrast to what is observed in man, concentrations of alpha 2 -macroglobulin and transferrin were increased. Co-culture of <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> cultures with lipopolysaccharide-activated human peripheral blood monocytes or incubation with conditioned medium prepared from lipopolysaccharide-activated human or rabbit monocytes resulted in dose-dependent induction of serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin and transferrin and depression of albumin synthesis, while C-reactive protein synthesis and mRNA levels remained unchanged. A variety of interleukin- 1 preparations induced dose-dependent increases in the synthesis and secretion of serum amyloid A, haptoglobin, ceruloplasmin and transferrin and decreased albumin synthesis. Human recombinant tumour necrosis factor (cachectin) induced a dose-dependent increase in synthesis of haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin. In general, human interleukin- 1 was more potent than mouse interleukin- 1 and tumour necrosis factor. None of the monokines we studied had an effect on C-reactive protein synthesis or mRNA levels. These data confirm that C-reactive protein, serum amyloid A, haptoglobin and ceruloplasmin display acute phase behaviour in the rabbit, and demonstrate that, in contrast to their behaviour in man, alpha 2 M and transferrin are positive acute phase proteins in this species.

Additionally, LCN 13 alone was able to suppress HGP, whereas neutralization of LCN 13 increased HGP in <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocyte</b> cultures. These data suggest that LCN 13 regulates glucose metabolism by both insulin-dependent and insulin-independent mechanisms. LCN 13 and LCN 13 -related molecules {{may be used to}} treat insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes...|$|R
40|$|The {{susceptibility}} of {{the tree}} shrew Tupaia belangeri to human hepatitis B virus (HBV) has been demonstrated both in vivo and in vitro. In this study, we show that purified HBV infects <b>primary</b> T. belangeri <b>hepatocyte</b> cultures in a very specific manner, as detected by HBV covalently closed circular DNA, mRNA, HBV e antigen, and HBsAg production. A monoclonal antibody (MAb), MA 18 / 7, directed against the pre-S 1 domain of the large HBs protein, which {{has been shown to}} neutralize infectivity of HBV for <b>primary</b> human <b>hepatocytes,</b> also blocked infection of <b>primary</b> Tupaia <b>hepatocytes.</b> MAbs against the pre-S 2 domain of HBs inhibited infection only partially, whereas an S MAb and polyvalent anti-HBs antibodies neutralized infection completely. Thus, both pre-S 1 and S antigens are necessary for infection in the tupaia. Using subviral particles, > 70 % of <b>primary</b> Tupaia <b>hepatocytes</b> are capable of specific binding of pre-S 1 -rich HBsAg, showing localization in distinct membrane areas. The data show that the early steps of HBV infection in Tupaia hepatocyte cultures are comparable to those in the human system...|$|R
40|$|The liver plays a {{key role}} in {{maintaining}} physiological homeostasis and hepatocytes are largely responsible for this. The use of isolated <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> has become an essential tool for the study of nutrient physiology, xenobiotic metabolism and several liver pathologies. Since hepatocytes are removed from their normal environment, the isolation procedure and in vitro culture of <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> is partially known to induce undesired metabolic changes. We aimed to perform a thorough metabolic profiling of primary cells before, during and after isolation using state-of-the-art techniques. Extensive metabolite measurements using HPLC were performed in situ in the liver, during hepatocyte isolation using the two-step collagenase perfusion method and during in vitro cell culture for up to 48 hours. Assessment of mitochondrial respiratory capacity and ATP-linked respiration of isolated <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> was performed using extracellular flux analysis. <b>Primary</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> displayed a drastic decrease in antioxidative-related metabolites (NADPH, NADP, GSH and GSSG) during the isolation procedure when compared to the in situ liver (P< 0. 001). Parallel assessment of citric acid cycle activity showed a significant decrease of up to 95 % in Acetyl-CoA, Isocitrate/Citrate ratio, Succinate, Fumarate and Malate in comparison to the in situ liver (P< 0. 001). While the levels of several cellular energetic metabolites such as Adenosine, AMP, ADP and ATP were found to be progressively reduced during the isolation procedure and cell culture (P< 0. 001), higher ATP/ADP ratio and energy charge level were observed when primary cells were cultured in vitro compared to the in situ liver (P< 0. 05). In addition, a significant decrease in the respiratory capacity occurred after 24 hours in culture. Interestingly, this was not associated with a significant modification of ATP-linked respiration. In conclusion, major metabolic alterations occur immediately after hepatocytes are removed from the liver. These changes persist or increase during in vitro culture. These observations need to be taken into account when using <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> for the study of metabolism or liver physiopathology...|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{showed the}} impairment of insulin-regulated gene {{expression in the}} <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> from Zucker fatty (ZF) rats, and its association with alterations of hepatic glucose and lipid metabolism. However, the molecular mechanism is unknown. A preliminary experiment shows that the expression level of protein kinase C ζ (PKCζ), a member of atypical PKC family, is higher in the liver and hepatocytes of ZF rats than that of Zucker lean (ZL) rats. Herein, we intend to investigate the roles of atypical protein kinase C in the regulation of hepatic gene expression. The insulin-regulated hepatic gene expression was evaluated in ZL <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> treated with atypical PKC recombinant adenoviruses. Recombinant adenovirus-mediated overexpression of PKCζ, or the other atypical PKC member PKCι/λ, alters the basal and impairs the insulin-regulated expressions of glucokinase, sterol regulatory element-binding protein 1 c, the cytosolic form of phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase, the catalytic subunit of glucose 6 -phosphatase, and insulin like growth factor-binding protein 1 in ZL <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocytes.</b> PKCζ or PKCι/λ overexpression also reduces the protein level of insulin receptor substrate 1, and the insulin-induced phosphorylation of AKT at Ser 473 and Thr 308. Additionally, PKCι/λ overexpression impairs the insulin-induced Prckz expression, indicating the crosstalk between PKCζ and PKCι/λ. We conclude that the PKCζ expression is elevated in hepatocytes of insulin resistant ZF rats. Overexpressions of aPKCs in <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> impair insulin signal transduction, and in turn, the down-stream insulin-regulated gene expression. These data suggest that elevation of aPKC expression {{may contribute to the}} hepatic insulin resistance at gene expression level...|$|E
40|$|The {{synthesis}} of some class 1 acute-phase proteins (APP), including C-reactive protein (CRP) and serum amyloid A (SAA) protein is completely {{blocked by the}} IL- 1 receptor antagonist (IL- 1 Ra), whereas the production of fibrinogen, a class 2 APP, is increased by IL- 1 Ra in hepatoma cells, but this has never been tested in human hepatocytes in primary culture. Since previous studies on the contributions of cytokine inhibitors in connective tissues diseases suggested that IL- 1 and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha) might {{play an important role}} in the regulation of CRP, we decided to examine in more detail the respective roles of IL- 1 beta, IL- 6, and TNF-alpha and their inhibitors in the production of APP by human <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> versus the hepatoma cell line PLC/PRF/ 5. In the hepatoma cell line, IL- 1 beta and/or TNF-alpha had synergistic effects with IL- 6 on the production of CRP and SAA. In contrast, these cytokines were devoid of effect in normal hepatocytes. The production of fibrinogen was increased by IL- 6 and decreased by IL- 1 (and TNF-alpha) in both cell types. The secretion of CRP and SAA by <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> incubated with a cytokine-rich mononuclear cell-conditioned medium was totally unaffected by IL- 1 Ra or anti-TNF-alpha antibodies. In contrast, the addition of IL- 1 Ra increased the production of fibrinogen by both hepatoma cells and <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocytes</b> incubated with the mononuclear cell-conditioned medium. We therefore conclude that IL- 1 beta and TNF-alpha do not exert any significant effect on the {{synthesis of}} CRP and SAA by human <b>primary</b> <b>hepatocytes...</b>|$|E
