5|$|Of the British rear ships, {{only two}} made a {{determined}} effort {{to break the}} French line. Admiral Hood's flagship HMS Royal George pierced it between Républicain and Sans <b>Pareil,</b> engaging both closely, while HMS Glory came through the line behind Sans <b>Pareil</b> and threw herself into the melee as well. The rest of the British and French rearguard {{did not participate in}} this close combat; HMS Montagu fought a long range gunnery duel with Neptune which damaged neither ship severely, although the British captain James Montagu was killed in the opening exchanges, command devolving to Lieutenant Ross Donnelly. Next in line, HMS Ramillies ignored her opponent completely and sailed west, Captain Henry Harvey seeking Brunswick, his brother's ship, in the confused action around Queen Charlotte.|$|E

5|$|On {{the morning}} of 30 May, Howe sent a signal to all his captains asking if they {{considered}} their ships ready for combat. All but Caesar replied in the affirmative and Howe pushed his ships after the retreating French. Despite holding the weather gage, Howe's pursuit was soon hampered by descending fog, and unable to see or {{come to grips with}} the enemy throughout the whole day, the admiral feared he may have lost his opportunity for battle. However, by 31 May the fog had cleared and the French were still within sight to the north. To the surprise of the British, none of the 26 battleships in the French fleet appeared to show battle damage, whereas many of the British ships were nursing damaged rigging and battered hulls. Villaret had made use of the fog to reorganise his force, losing Montagnard and the frigate Seine to the convoy but gaining the independently sailing battleship Trente-un-Mai and Nielly's squadron of Sans <b>Pareil,</b> Trajan, and Téméraire. Villaret had also dispatched the battered Indomptable for home, escorted by an undamaged French ship.|$|E
5|$|Out in the Atlantic, the {{detached}} squadrons of Nielly (French) and Montagu (British) were commerce raiding against enemy merchant shipping, but had {{thus far}} {{failed to find}} the main food convoy. Nielly encountered a British convoy from Newfoundland and took ten ships as prizes—including the convoy escort, the 32-gun frigate HMS Castor. Thomas Troubridge, captain of the Castor, would spend the entire campaign aboard Nielly's flagship Sans <b>Pareil.</b> Montagu also met with some success on 15 May, recapturing the merchant ships Nielly had taken, along with the French corvette Marie-Guiton and accurate intelligence on the direction {{and size of the}} French convoy which Montagu immediately passed to Howe. Resuming his patrol in the Mid-Atlantic, Nielly found the convoy from America a few days later, and transferred two of his ships to Vanstabel's escort to augment the convoy's defences. He then returned to the Eastern Atlantic to look for signs of British activity which might pose a threat to its passage. He also dispatched frigates to Villaret, carrying information about the convoy's location and speed.|$|E
5|$|Troubridge {{and most}} of his crew were removed from their ship and taken aboard Nielly's {{flagship}} Sans <b>Pareil,</b> where they remained {{for the rest of the}} campaign. They were replaced by 200 French sailors taken from Nielly's squadron, as Castor was hastily refitted at sea for service with the French Navy. Command was given to Captain L'Huillier, who operated as a scout for Nielly's squadron until 24 May, when he became detached while chasing the Dutch merchant ship Maria Gertruda, which had been separated from a Dutch convoy that had been attacked by Villaret's fleet on 19 May. Separated from Nielly's ships, L'Huillier turned back towards Europe with the Dutch ship in tow. While the French fleets and squadrons searched the Eastern Atlantic for the convoy, the Royal Navy was equally active with a number of squadrons and independently sailing warships complementing the main fleet under Lord Howe. One such ship was the small 28-gun frigate HMS Carysfort under Captain Francis Laforey. Laforey was cruising the Eastern Atlantic for signs of the French convoy when on 29 May his lookouts sighted two sails ahead.|$|E

40|$|Solution {{layering}} {{technique was}} used to prepare pellets of Salbutamol Sulphate. A multiparticulate system was prepared with pH independent and pH dependent coatings, and evaluated as pulsatile drug delivery system. Salbutamol sulphate release was studied from methacrylate coated pellets from non <b>pareils.</b> Morphology was studied using Scanning Electron Microscopy for the characterization of prepared pellets. Combination of Eudragit RSPO (pH independent) and Eudragit L 100 (pH dependent) was used for coating of the pellets. Different concentrations of this polymeric combination were loaded on to the drug-loaded pellets. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of physicochemical properties of the polymers on the release profile of Salbutamol sulphate from the pellets dosage form. The in-vitro study suggested that Eudragit RSPO and Eudragit L 100 at 10 % coating level led to an optimum pulsatile release behavior. The coated pellets prepared by solution layering technology successfully released drug after specific lag time indicating pulsatile drug delivery. It was revealed that Eudragit RSPO has the effect to retard drug release. The results generated in this study showed that proper selection of polymeric materials based on their physicochemical properties is important in designing pellets dosage form with suitable dissolution profile...|$|R

40|$|Background: Phymas {{are slowly}} progressive, disfiguring {{disorders}} {{of the face}} and ears that represent the end stage of rosacea. The most common phyma is rhinophyma, yet similar swellings may occur on the chin (gnatophyma), forehead (metophyma), one or both ears (otophyma), and eyelids (blepharophyma). Objective: Unlike rhinophyma, otophyma is rarely seen. We report two rare phymas: a case of gnatophyma and a case of otophyma. Methods: A 56 -year-old African American man presented {{with a history of}} bumps on his chin that had begun about 7 years earlier. Physical examination was remarkable for lobulated plaques on the chin, coalescing into hypertrophic nodules and dilated pores. A 73 -year-old African American male presented with bilateral cauliflower-like earlobe growths for the past 17 years. Results: A skin biopsy was performed for each patient demonstrating cystic follicular dilatation with keratin plugging, dermal scarring, psoriasiform epidermal hyperplasia, and chronic inflammation of some of the follicles. Conclusion: This case report describes a relatively rare gnatophyma and otophyma. Surgical management is well accepted as the best mode of therapy to treat rhinophyma and is becoming a first-line treatment for all phymas. Antécédents: Les phymas sont une classe de maladies cutanées, a ̀ progression lente, qui défigurent le visage et les oreilles et représentent le dernier stade de la rosacée.

It {{is a collection of}} apologues recited by a learned Brahman, Vishnu Sharma by name, for the edification of his pupils, the sons of an Indian Raja.

25|$|Stephenson's Rocket was the {{outright}} winner as {{the only}} locomotive that stayed the course whilst fully complying with the rules. In the event, none of the contestants really answered the railway's requirements. Hackworth stayed on after the event, repairing the Sans <b>Pareil</b> {{and was able to}} show that it more than met requirements. On the strength of this, the L management did purchase the locomotive, subsequently reselling it at a loss to the Bolton and Leigh Railway where it worked until 1844. As Ahrons points out, the vertical cylinders would have given rise to considerable hammer blow at speed and made it unsuited to passenger service on the track of that time in the long term. Nevertheless, it was a formidable contender, largely due to the carefully designed and tuned blastpipe.|$|E
25|$|The {{success of}} the Stockton and Darlington {{encouraged}} the rich investors in the rapidly industrialising North West of England to embark upon a project to link the rich cotton manufacturing town of Manchester with the thriving port of Liverpool. The Liverpool and Manchester Railway was the first modern railway, in that both the goods and passenger traffic were operated by scheduled or timetabled locomotive hauled trains. When it was built, there was serious doubt that locomotives could maintain a regular service over the distance involved. A widely reported competition was held in 1829 called the Rainhill Trials, {{to find the most}} suitable steam engine to haul the trains. A number of locomotives were entered, including Novelty, Perseverance and Sans <b>Pareil.</b> The winner was Stephenson's Rocket, which steamed better because of its multi-tubular boiler (suggested by Henry Booth, a director of the railway company).|$|E
25|$|Stephenson's {{most visible}} {{decision}} {{was to use}} {{a single pair of}} driving wheels, with a small carrying axle behind. This was the first 0-2-2 and first single driver locomotive. The use of single drivers gave several advantages. The weight of coupling rods was avoided and the second axle could be smaller and lightweight, as it only carried a small proportion of the weight. Rocket placed just over 2½tons of its 4¼ton total weight onto its driving wheels, a higher axle load than Sans <b>Pareil,</b> even though the 0-4-0 was heavier overall at 5ton, and officially disqualified by being over the 4½ton limit. Early locomotive designers had been concerned that the adhesion of a locomotive's driving wheels would be inadequate, but Stephenson's past experience convinced him that this would not be a problem, particularly with the light trains of the trials contest.|$|E
