25|$|The unique subgame perfect {{equilibrium}} (and every Nash equilibrium) {{of these}} games {{indicates that the}} first player take the <b>pot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> very {{first round of the}} game; however, in empirical tests, relatively few players do so, and as a result, achieve a higher payoff than the payoff predicted by the equilibria analysis. These results are taken to show that subgame perfect equilibria and Nash equilibria fail to predict human play in some circumstances. The Centipede game is commonly used in introductory game theory courses and texts to highlight the concept of backward induction and the iterated elimination of dominated strategies, which show a standard way of providing a solution to the game.|$|E
25|$|Sephardi-style hamin {{typically}} includes whole {{eggs in the}} shell, {{which are}} placed {{on top of the}} mixture in the stewing pot and turn brown in the course of all-night cooking. The brown eggs, called haminados (güevos haminadavos in Ladino, huevos haminados in Spanish), are shelled before serving and placed {{on top of the other}} cooked ingredients. In a Tunisian version, the brown eggs are cooked separately in a metal <b>pot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> all-night stove with water and tea leaves (similar to tea eggs). Haminados can be cooked in this way even if no hamin is prepared. The addition of tea leaves, coffee grinds, or onion skins to the water dyes the shell purple and the white a light brown, giving the egg a smooth creamy texture. In Israel, brown eggs are a popular accompaniment to ful medames (a dish of mashed broad beans) and they may also be served with hummus (a dip of mashed chickpeas mixed with tahini) and in a Sabich sandwich.|$|E

Gumbo is almost always served {{directly}} from the <b>pot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stove, although in wealthier or fancier homes the dish might be transferred to a tureen on the table. Often, gumbo and bread are the sole courses in a meal, although many Cajun families provide a side dish of potato salad. Occasionally, gumbo is served {{as part of a larger}} menu.|$|E

Betty Driver said of the range's launch: [...] "Betty Turpin's hotpots have become something of an institution at the Rover's and she's very proud of her reputation for good, wholesome food. I think it is a lovely idea that people will be able to buy them in supermarkets now." [...] Driver discussed her astonishment at the general level of interest in her character's hotpots, disclosing: [...] "I was on a cruise on the QE2 a few weeks ago, and everyone was asking me about it.

This time Taylor, stretching a fraction {{to avoid having to}} use the rest, sunk the black ball on his fourth shot. As the audience erupted, one of snooker's greatest-ever comebacks was complete at 12.23 a.m. on a Monday morning (29 April 1985).

2500|$|In game theory, the {{centipede}} game, {{first introduced}} by Robert Rosenthal in 1981, is an extensive form {{game in which}} two players take turns choosing either to take a slightly larger share of an increasing pot, or to pass the pot to the other player. [...] The payoffs are arranged so that if one passes the pot to one's opponent and the opponent takes the <b>pot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> next round, one receives slightly less than if one had taken the pot on this round. [...] Although the traditional centipede game had a limit of 100 rounds (hence the name), any game with this structure but a different number of rounds is called a centipede game.|$|E

[...] Hurston's biographer Valerie Boyd described it as [...] "an inspired moniker that was simultaneously self-mocking and self-glorifying, and sure to shock the stuffy black bourgeoisie". [...] Hurston was actually the coiner of the name. [...] The quickest wit in what was a very witty group, which encompassed Helene Johnson, Countee Cullen, Augusta Savage, Dorothy West (then a teacher), Harold Jackman, and John P. Davis (a law student at the time), as well as hangers-on, friends, and acquaintances, Hurston dubbed herself the [...] "Queen of the Niggerati".

2500|$|After being a stalwart of chat shows, in {{the mid-1980s}} Monkhouse {{presented}} his own for the BBC, The Bob Monkhouse Show. The show lasted two series and showcased comedians of every age. Monkhouse was criticised for sycophancy towards his guests but {{said that they were}} all heroes of his and that was how he really felt about them. Monkhouse was known as a keen supporter of new comedy and he used the show to introduce audiences to new comedians such as Kelly Monteith, Robin Williams and Jim Carrey. The format of the interviews varied between [...] "true" [...] chat and analysis of comedy, to scripted routines in which Monkhouse would willingly play the role of the guest's stooge as he did with Bob Hope. On one occasion the guest was the comedian Pamela Stephenson who, after prior arrangement with the show's producer, appeared in a series of fake plaster casts, apparently the result of accidents whilst at home. During the interview she produced a handgun and fired it on several occasions, destroying a plant <b>pot</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> set and a series of lights in the studio roof. She then presented a rocket launcher which she promptly [...] "fired" [...] destroying a camera. The gun, launcher and camera were props. None of this was known to Monkhouse who appeared genuinely frightened (although the production crew were aware).|$|E
