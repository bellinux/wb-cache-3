We employ a uniform <b>pole</b> <b>width</b> so that {{the width of the}} rotor pole is {{the same as that of}} the stator salient pole. This design aims to minimize the cogging torque. Second, we used a skewed rotor with one-half the <b>pole</b> <b>width</b> to improve the commutation. Finally, based on the flux linkage of the skewed rotor, we used a six-state commutating mode to control the motor. We validated the feasibility of these new design concepts by simulations, field analysis, and experimental measurements of the prototype.

40|$|Track and μtrack scans {{are common}} {{techniques}} in hard disk systems for investigating side writing and side reading, and for characterizing {{the response of}} MR read heads. These methods are implemented less in tape systems, where the contact recording mode and flexible medium {{make it difficult to}} obtain a smooth relative movement between head and medium. Positioning instability generates fluctuations in track profiles (S. Fukuda et al, 2000). We optimized an experimental system, using helical scan type heads and tape wound on a rotary drum, for measuring sub-μm track profiles. Writing and reading operations are performed with the same helical scan silicon (HSS) head, fabricated with advanced thin film technology. HSS heads feature unique properties such as an integrated solenoid coil (DC resistance < 8 Ω for 40 turns), and very small <b>pole</b> <b>widths.</b> The very good alignment of the polar pieces is expected to minimize side effects. In this paper, we report μtrack profile measurements for investigation of track edge behavior of HSS heads in combination with MP and ME tapes. Heads with optical <b>pole</b> <b>widths</b> as narrow as 3. 3 μm and 0. 11 μm gap length have been studied. Narrower tracks are obtained by recording a first track and partially erasing it from one side by writing a second track at a different wavelength. The positioning accuracy achieved, better than 0. 1 μm with all precautions, allows use of this method for side erasure measurements. Using a 0. 5 μm wavelength track to partially overwrite a 0. 4 μm wavelength we find a side erasure band of 0. 3 μm (with MP tape, Hc= 135 kA/m). Results are compared with MFM observations and qualitative agreement is proved. We also describe novel profiling methods for quantifying side reading, and report experimental results. The difference between the side erasure band (SEB) and the side reading band (SRB) can be determined by writing a track in the middle of two adjacent tracks having different wavelengths. All wavelengths are read during the same scan...|$|R

30|$|The rule of {{levitation}} force variation {{with different}} structure and electromagnetic parameters provides {{a basis for}} electromagnet design of electromagnetic suspension (EMS) medium and low speed maglev vehicles. In order to acquire accurate calculation results of levitation force, different calculation methods, including analytical method, 2 D FEM (finite element method), and 3 D FEM, are applied to investigate the impact of various structural parameters, such as excitation current, air gap, lateral offset, and <b>pole</b> <b>width,</b> on levitation force. The analytical analysis {{is based on the}} classic mathematical model of levitation force between electromagnet and rail and performed with MATLAB. In the 2 D and 3 D FEMs, the numerical calculation of the levitation force is conducted with Ansoft by taking the magnetic saturation into account. In addition, the longitudinal end effect on the levitation force calculation is considered in the 3 D FEM. The results show that the 3 D FEM is the most accurate among the above three methods for calculating the levitation force, and the analytical method can only work for small current and/or large air gap conditions. A lateraloffset between vehicle and rail will reduce the levitation force; the levitation force descends sharply once the lateral offset exceeds the threshold, i.e., 8 % of the <b>pole</b> <b>width</b> for U-shaped electromagnets. The maximum lift-to-weight ratio emerges when the <b>pole</b> <b>width</b> ratio of F type rail to electromagnet is 6 : 7.

40|$|In {{this study}} we present morphometrical {{evaluation}} of some kidney’s anatomical characteristics in two different pig breeds reared in Macedonian farms in order to determinate whether the investigated pig kidneys could be suitable as an experimental model in human medicine. The material was consisted of 156 pig kidneys taken from two adult pig breeds (96 kidneys of Landrace/Yorkshire crossbreed and 60 kidneys from breed Dalland), slaughtered at age of 5. 5 months and weighting of 95 kg of mean. The kidneys were evaluated morphmetrically, considering weight, length, cranial and caudal <b>pole</b> <b>width</b> and cranial and caudal pole thickness. The data was statistically evaluated and compared with previous published findings for human kidneys. The results for the pig kidney morphometric measurements for Landrace/Yorkshire crossbreed were the following: weight 158. 95 g, length 12. 73 cm, cranial <b>pole</b> <b>width</b> and thickness: 6. 39 cm and 3. 00 cm respectively, caudal <b>pole</b> <b>width</b> and thickness 5. 75 cm and 2. 83 cm, respectively. In breed Dalland, the renal morphometric measurements showed: weight 182. 98 g, length 12. 61 cm, cranial pole width: 6. 59 cm and cranial pole thickness: 3. 15 cm, caudal pole width: 5. 91 cm and caudal pole thickness: 3. 04 cm. There were positive correlations between several variables considering the renal morphometry. Except for the length, the results of other morphmetrical measurements for Landrace/Yorkshire crossbreedwere smaller than those obtained for breed Dalland. From anatomical view despite the differences among these two breeds founded in this study, there are many similarities between the pig and human kidney morphometry. Considering that the best anatomical region for kidney implantation in humans depends on kidney’s anatomical features (length of blood vessels and urinary loop {{as well as the}} number of blood vessels) and renal morphological characteristics (weight, length, width and thickness) we can conclude that the pig kidneys from both investigated breeds in selected category could be suitable as an experimental models for endourological research...|$|E

A related rate, as a proxy for the relation between size diminution betwenn each lake's population had a value of - 1. 25 which indicates that each population vegetatively reproduces at a different rate.

This thesis {{is concerned with the}} investigation of the recording process in narrow tracks down to the submicron range, with emphasis on edge effects. Side writing and erasing were primarily treated, as they represent critical limitations for increasing the track density. Side reading was also addressed, however, it is not considered to be a severe issue for modern tape storage systems. Diverse investigation methods were applied and explored, including track profiling techniques and magnetic force microscope (MFM) imaging. A novel triple-track profiling model able to assess erase bands down to 0. 2 µm and below was introduced, as well as an original technique for studying the recording process in submicron tracks, based on microtrack measurements. The principles for developing a recording tester with ultimate performances aimed at track widths below 0. 5 µm were also laid down. Narrow track recording and edge effects were analyzed using advanced Helical Scan Silicon (HSS) heads and MIG heads with <b>pole</b> <b>widths</b> from 1. 3 µm to 6. 2 µm.
