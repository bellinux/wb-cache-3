40|$|Black carbon (BC) is a quantitatively {{important}} C pool in {{the global}} C cycle due to its relative recalcitrance compared with other C pools. However, mechanisms of BC oxidation and accompanying molecular changes are largely unknown. In this study, the long-term dynamics in {{quality and quantity of}} BC were investigated in cultivated soil using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS), Fourier-transform infrared (FTIR) and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) techniques. BC particles and changes in BC stocks were obtained from soil collected in fields that were cleared from forest by fire at 8 different times in the past (2, 3, 5, 20, 30, 50, 80 and 100 years before sampling) in western Kenya. BC contents rapidly decreased from 12. 7 to 3. 8 mg C g− 1 soil during the first 30 years following deposition, after which they slowly decreased to a steady state at 3. 5 mg C g− 1 soil. BC-derived C losses from the top 0. 1 m over 100 years were estimated at 6, 000 kg C ha− 1. The initial rapid changes in BC stocks resulted in a mean residence time of only around 8. 3 years, which was likely a function of both decomposition as well as transport processes. The molecular properties of BC changed more rapidly on surfaces than in the interior of BC particles and more rapidly during the first 30 years than during the following 70 years. The Oc/C ratios (Oc is O bound to C) and carbonyl groups (C=O) increased over the first 10 and 30 years by 133 and 192 %, respectively, indicating oxidation was an important process controlling BC quality. Al, Si, polysaccharides, {{and to a lesser extent}} Fe were found on BC particle surfaces within the first few years after BC deposition to soil.

40|$|D. Phil. The {{progress}} of the South African economy relies heavily upon earnings from <b>physical</b> <b>exports,</b> which depend increasingly upon the competitiveness in global markets of the maritime supply chains that serve the country. Competition in world markets is becoming increasingly stronger as production resources are obtained globally and subsequently the competition exists between the effectiveness of whole supply chains rather than only production costs. South Africa therefore has great interest in ensuring that its maritime supply chains compare with world best practice. Amongst other things, this world best practice requires those chains to function as entities structured to serve their logistical purpose, i. e. {{that it should not}} include links consisting of separate transport businesses. In practice, this requires that links traditionally provided by third parties be structurally integrated as cost centres instead of profits centres in the chains. Such integrated maritime supply chains will inevitably only be developed by the intervention of chain leaders. South Africa’s major supply chains conveying commodities and manufactured products are examined {{in order to determine the}} scope for the integration of their links as a means of raising their efficiency as ‘complete chains’. Features of selected maritime supply chains serving other countries that could serve as models for the structuring of South Africa’s are identified. Transnet’s role in the existing maritime supply chains in accordance with the policy of the Government is examined and attention is focused on the under-investment in recent years that has led to the deterioration in the company’s performance. The rejection by the Government of the privatisation of the core assets of the railways and ports in favour of public-private partnerships, as a means of overcoming the problems, is considered in order to conclude whether a solution will be forthcoming in that manner. Special consideration is given to Transnet’s proposed spending of R 40 bn on infrastructure projects and attention is focused on the fact that this will not address all the problems. The marine links in South Africa’s maritime supply chains are currently provided by foreigners. Virtually all South Africa’s bulk exports are sold free-on-board, which concedes control over the shipping of the cargo to foreign importers. Reasons for such arrangements are complex and chartering by South African exporters in order to maintain control is often not feasible, although it is done in the fruit trade and by Australian exporters of iron ore competing with South African exporters. Ship owning by South Africans will facilitate new legislation to increase the market share of citizens in the country’s exports and imports, but price-wise market entry will be difficult and it is debatable whether exporters will make use of their services. In the liner trades, the trend is for shipping companies to integrate port and overland links into their services, and the efficiency of South Africa’s container supply chains will need to be raised in that manner. The criteria for determining maritime supply chain efficiency and the integration of the links of particular South African chains based on their cost structures, as well as the leadership needed to pursue such development, are motivated. Proposals are also made for the integration of the links of the iron ore and coal supply chains under the leadership of public-private partnerships, as well as for a container supply chain incorporating both a dedicated terminal in the Port of Ngqura and the railway between Coega and Gauteng, under the leadership of a liner shipping company or consortium of companies. The conclusion is reached that the present role of Transnet in accordance with the declared policy of the Government is not conducive to improving maritime supply chain efficiency through the structural integration of the links. It is also concluded that the efficiency of the chains could be raised through private leadership with public participation, subject to a change in the Government’s policy towards the role of Transnet in order to allow such leadership.

Image processing {{is an important}} application domain that is particularly impacted by this growing performance gap. Image processing algorithms tend to have poor memory locality because they access their data in a non-sequential fashion and reuse that data infrequently. As a result, they often exhibit poor cache and TLB hit rates on conventional memory systems, which limits overall performance. Most current approaches to addressing the memory bottleneck focus on modifying cache organizations or introducing processor-based prefetching. The Impulse memory system takes a different approach: allowing application software to control how, when, and where data are loaded into a conventional processor cache. Impulse does this by letting software configure how the memory controller interprets the <b>physical</b> addresses <b>exported</b> by a processor. Introducing an extra level of address translation in the memory controller enables an application to dynamically change how its data are fetched from memory.

SoftRate also uses abrupt changes in the BER estimate to identify interference, enabling it to reduce the bit rate only in response to channel errors caused by attenuation or fading. Our experiments conducted using a software radio prototype show that SoftRate achieves 2 × higher throughput than popular frame-level protocols such as SampleRate [4] and RRAA [24].

And the third filter describes the level of availability {{from the point of view}} of logistics costs and trade barrier. 17 countries which fail the selection were enrolled in the list due to potentially promising markets for Russian products. Then the total export potential was calculated on the basis of Russian potential share in a particular country taking into account index trade availability and the average price of a car imported to each country. As a result, top- 5 countries for Russian cars and trucks exports are found, and aggregate export potential is estimated at 194 thousand passenger vehicles and 30 thousand trucks per year for the next few years...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of IEEE 802. 11 with different network densities and protocol configurations is of interest, particularly in distributed coordination function (DCF) mode. A mathematical model for single hop network IEEE 802. 11 protocol {{was introduced by}} Bianchi [1] to analytically derive the saturated throughput. The {{ultimate goal is to}} enhance the capacity of Ad-hoc network closer to the analytical values of this model. As an attempt, the Receiver Based Capacity Enhancement Algorithm using Cross-Layer Design Approach (RCECLD) is proposed which dynamically adapts the data rate. It uses Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SNR) values calculated by <b>Physical</b> layer and <b>exported</b> to Medium Access Control (MAC) layer via the cross-layer interface to estimate the prevailing channel state. In RCECLD the receiver decides the transmission data rate by calculating the SNR value of received RTS (Readyto-Send), which is in turn an estimate of the prevailing channel state, and piggybacking it through CTS (Clear-to-Send) to the transmitter. Accordingly, transmitter transmits the data frame with adopted data rate. The capacity of the Ad-hoc network is enhanced with RCECLD. It is investigated through an extensive set of single hop and multi-hop simulations. The results indicate that the enhancement is very close to analytical values for smaller network size and it is about 2. 5 times more than Auto-Rate Fallback (ARF) [2], inspite of fading and mobility effects in case of single hop, whereas in case of multi-hop with a chain of nodes it is almost doubled...|$|R
40|$|The {{carbon cycle}} {{is a major}} forcing {{component}} in the global climate system. Modelling studies aiming to explain recent and past climatic changes and to project future ones thus increasingly include {{the interaction between the}} physical and biogeochemical systems. Their ocean components are generally z-coordinate models that are conceptually easy to use but that employ a vertical coordinate that is alien to the real ocean structure. Here we present first results from a newly developed isopycnic carbon cycle model and demonstrate the viability of using an isopycnic physical component for this purpose. As expected, the model represents interior ocean transport of biogeochemical tracers well and produces realistic tracer distributions. Difficulties in employing a purely isopycnic coordinate lie mainly in the treatment of the surface boundary layer which is often represented by a bulk mixed layer. The most significant adjustments of the biogeochemical code for use with an isopycnic coordinate are in the representation of upper ocean biological production. We present a series of sensitivity studies exploring the effect of changes in biogeochemical and <b>physical</b> processes on <b>export</b> production and nutrient distribution. Apart from giving us pointers for further model development, they highlight the importance of preformed nutrient distributions in the Southern Ocean for global nutrient distributions. Use of a prognostic slab atmosphere allows us to assess the effect of the changes in export production on global ocean carbon uptake and atmospheric CO 2 levels. Sensitivity studies show that iron limitation for biological particle production, the treatment of light penetration for biological production, and the role of diapycnal mixing result in significant changes of modelled air-sea fluxes and nutrient distributions...|$|R
