The Society this year celebrates its 50 th anniversary. Due to public health importance {{at the time of}} foundation, medical parasitology was the main stream for next 3 decades. Domestic problems of niche parasitic diseases, unlisted in 6 tropical diseases of major importance, had been studied by own efforts. To cope with the demand of parasite control, evaluation system for control activity was built up. Control activity against soil-transmitted nematodes, conducted for almost 3 decades, was evaluated as a success. Evaluation of praziquantel efficacy for clonorchiasis, paragonimiasis, and neurocysticercosis, population dynamics of Ascaris lumbricoides infection in a situation of continuous reinfections, diagnostic modalities of antibody tests combined with brain imaging developed for helminthiasis of the central nervous system and researches on intestinal trematodes were achievements in the first 30 years. During the recent 2 decades, science researches, such as cell and molecular biology of <b>parasites</b> and <b>immunology</b> of parasitic infections have been studied especially on parasitic allergens and proteolytic and anti-oxidant enzymes.

40|$|Malaria {{remains one}} of the world’s worst health problems, which causes 216 million new cases and {{approximately}} 655, 000 deaths every year WHO World Malaria Report, 2011. Malaria transmission to the mammalian host is initiated through a mosquito bite that delivers sporozoites into the vertebrate host. The injected sporozoites are selectively targeted to liver which is the first obligatory step in infection thus making this stage an attractive target for both drug and vaccine development. Research using rodent models of malaria has greatly facilitated the understanding of several aspects of pre-erythrocytic <b>parasite</b> biology and <b>immunology.</b> However, translation of this knowledge to combat Plasmodium falciparum infections still offers several challenges. We highlight in this review some of the recent advances in the field of Plasmodium sporozoite and liver stage biology and in the generation of whole organism attenuated vaccines.

40|$|In wild populations, {{individuals}} are regularly {{exposed to a}} wide range of pathogens. In this context, organisms must elicit and regulate effective immune responses to protect their health while avoiding immunopathology. However, most of our knowledge about the function and dynamics of immune responses comes from laboratory studies performed on inbred mice in highly controlled environments with limited exposure to infection. Natural populations, on the other hand, exhibit wide genetic and environmental diversity. We argue that now is the time for immunology to be taken into the wild. The goal of ‘wild immunology’ is to link immune phenotype with host fitness in natural environments. To achieve this requires relevant measures of immune responsiveness that are both applicable to the host–parasite interaction under study and robustly associated with measures of host and <b>parasite</b> fitness. Bringing <b>immunology</b> to nonmodel organisms and linking that knowledge host fitness, and ultimately population dynamics, will face difficult challenges, both technical (lack of reagents and annotated genomes) and statistical (variation among individuals and populations). However, the affordability of new genomic technologies will help immunologists, ecologists and evolutionary biologists work together to translate and test our current knowledge of immune mechanisms in natural systems. From this approach, ecologists will gain new insight into mechanisms relevant to host health and fitness, while immunologists will be given a measure of the real-world health impacts of the immune factors they study. Thus, wild immunology can be the missing link between laboratory-based immunology and human, wildlife and domesticated animal health...|$|R

40|$|Organisms face a {{constant}} risk of attack from <b>parasites.</b> While classic <b>immunology</b> has revealed numerous physiological and molecular mechanisms that underpin host immunity, the recently developed field of ecological immunology {{has attempted to}} understand the ecological and evolutionary causes that explain the diversity of such immune mechanisms. However, progress in the field has been hampered by the complex relationship between immunity and fitness {{as well as the}} methodological limitations of our experiments. There is an urgent need for eco-immunological studies that combine life history theory with experimentally tractable but ecologically realistic host and pathogen models. In this thesis, I tackle three novel aspects of host defence against parasites in an established model for insect immunity, the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, with the entomopathogenic fungus Metarhizium robertsii, {{one of the most successful}} natural insect pathogens. In particular, I show in Chapter 2 that an immune and stress response gene, Turandot M, provides specific immunity against sexually transmitted fungal infections; but, this protective effect comes at a cost to life history in the absence of infection. In Chapter 3, I show that when exposed to the fungal pathogen, the fruit fly alters its temperature preference by seeking out cooler temperatures, which results in a dramatic shift in its life history strategy while simultaneously enhancing antifungal resistance, though not tolerance. Finally, I demonstrate in Chapter 4 that exposure to fungal parasites induces fitness-associated maternal effects on offspring meiotic recombination and life history, both of which have the potential to accelerate adaptive evolution. Taken together, these results demonstrate the benefits of integrating life history theory in eco-immunological research. They show that life history responses are an integral component of host defence against parasites, and that Drosophila-Metarhizium is a promising model system for ecological immunolog...|$|R

Combined with high-throughput applications of established Sanger capillary electrophoresis, Next Generation Sequencing (NGS) is revolutionizing how parasite genomes are decoded and interrogated due to extraordinary increases in speed and decreased cost. The concurrent development and application of tools to characterise the function of these parasite genomes complements the generation of sequence data. Indeed, such tools are collectively responsible for many of today?s novel parasite biological discoveries. Thus, it is the intention of this special edition of <b>Parasite</b> <b>Immunology</b> to highlight recent advances in the fields of parasite genomics and post-genomic activities as they apply to both protozoan (within the Apicomplexa, the Amoebozoa and the Euglenozoa) and metazoan (within the Nematoda and Platyhelminthes) pathogens. As guest editors, we have solicited eleven contributions from experts within the Parasitology community and have specifically asked the authors to provide reviews, updates or perspectives that illustrate how next generation genomics is rapidly shaping inter-disciplinary science. We believe that these contributions provide a robust resource for the parasite immunologist interested in discovering how parasite genome information and post-genomic activities can help shape immunological-driven investigations of host/parasite interrelationships. We contend that integration of disciplines in this manner will play a major role in the future control of these biomedically relevant parasites. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|The rodent {{intestinal}} nematode H. p. bakeri {{has played}} an important role in the exploration of the host–parasite relationship of chronic nematode infections for over six decades, since the parasite was first isolated in the 1950 s by Ehrenford. It soon became a popular laboratory model providing a tractable experimental system that is easy to maintain in the laboratory and far more cost-effective than other laboratory nematode–rodent model systems. Immunity to this parasite is complex, dependent on antibodies, but confounded by the parasite's potent immunosuppressive secretions that facilitate chronic survival in murine hosts. In this review, we remind readers of the state of knowledge in the 1970 s, when the first volume of <b>Parasite</b> <b>Immunology</b> was published, focusing on the role of antibodies in protective immunity. We show how our understanding of the host–parasite relationship then developed over the following 35 years to date, we propose testable hypotheses for future researchers to tackle, and we speculate on how the new technologies will be applied to enable an increasingly refined understanding of the role of antibodies in host-protective immunity, and its evasion, to be achieved in the longer term...|$|E

Unlike the well characterized schistosomes, only the adult and juvenile stages of F. hepatica are implicated in disease, whereas the freely voided egg is not thought to contribute to host-parasite interactions. We investigated specific immune responses to soluble F. hepatica egg proteins (SFHEP), during a 14 -week experimental infection, demonstrating significant increases in anti-SFHEP IgG 1 (P = 0 center dot 001), transforming growth factor beta- 1 (P = 0. 008) and IL- 10 (P < 0. 001) titres {{at the onset of}} egg production. Western blot analysis of soluble SFHEP demonstrates that protein bands migrating at 61. 6, 54. 8 and 44 kDa become sero-reactive before the appearance of eggs within host faeces. Therefore, expression of some egg-associated proteins indicates progression to chronic disease. Antigenic bands were investigated through mass spectrometry, identifying a protein disulphide isomerase (PDI) (61. 6 kDa), an enolase and ferritin-related proteins (54. 8 kDa), and a cocktail of dehydrogenases (44 kDa). Biochemical analysis of egg secretions reveals proteolytic activity, which increases over time, indicating that proteases may be continually secreted during the course of egg maturation.

Among the series 5 a– 5 u, the compounds 5 u and 5 s exhibited potent anti-inflammatory activity of 80. 63 % and 78. 09 % and inhibition of 80. 87 % and 76. 56 % compared with the standard drug ibuprofen, which showed 81. 32 % and 79. 23 % inhibition after 3 and 4 hours, respectively. On the basis of in vivo studies, 12 compounds were selected for assessment of their in vitro inhibitory action against COX 1 / 2 and TNFα. The compounds 5 u and 5 s showed high COX 2 -inhibitory activity, with half-maximal inhibitory concentrations of 1. 79 and 2. 51 µM and selectivity index values of 72. 73 and 65. 75, respectively, comparable to celecoxib (selectivity index = 78. 06). These selected compounds were also tested for TNFα, cytotoxicity, and ulcerogenicity. Docking studies were also carried out to determine possible interactions of the potent compounds (5 u and 5 s), which also showed high docking scores of - 12. 907 and - 12. 24 compared to celecoxib, with a - 9. 924 docking score. These selective COX 2 inhibitors were docked into the active site of COX 2, and showed the same orientation and binding mode to that of celecoxib (selective COX 2 inhibitor).

The objective of this research was to investigate neosporosis in New Zealand cattle using experimental and molecular tools. The research also aimed to isolate and characterise an indigenous New Zealand isolate of Neospora caninum. A series of discrete projects were conducted to achieve the set objectives. A pilot study was first conducted and a wild-type strain of non-cytopathic bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) type 1 virus was isolated in vitro from a persistently infected heifer. The isolate was used to challenge heifers and the effect of experimental BVDV infection on heifers naturally infected with N. caninum was investigated. Results showed that heifers that were both BVDV and N. caninum seropositive produced 44. 4 % (8 / 18) damcalf pairs that were both BVDV and N caninum seropositive. Serologically, 66. 7 % (12 / 18) dam-calf pairs were seropositive to N. caninum antibodies, while 80 % (8 / 10) dam-calf pairs were BVDV seropositive. A Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) study was also conducted and N. caninum DNA was detected {{in the blood of}} naturally infected aborting and pregnant heifers. Real-time quantification of N. caninum DNA in the blood of infected heifers showed a decrease of N. caninum DNA after abortion in the aborting group and an increase through gestation in the pregnant group. A study of antigenicity recognised 7 immunodominant (~ 18, ~ 25, ~ 33, ~ 35 ~ 36, ~ 45 ~ 46, ~ 47 and 60 - 62 kDa) and 5 minor antigens of N. caninum by cow sera. Three isolates of N. caninum (NcNZ 1,NcNZ 2 and NcNZ 3) were isolated from the brains of an infected cow, her calf and a stillborn calf.

40|$|Gastro{{intestinal}} helminths infect over 1 {{billion people}} worldwide. While rarely causing death, intestinal helminths cause high morbidity, especially {{in children and}} result in huge economic losses each year. While antihelminthics have proven effective, in endemic areas reinfection is common {{and the emergence of}} antihelminthic resistance is a major concern. The murine intestinal nematode, Trichuris muris has been utilised as a good model for the human parasite, T. trichiura for the past 45 years and has yielded much evidence of the immune response to this caecal-dwelling nematode. Studies of the immune response to T. muris have mainly been conducted using the E isolate. Host resistance to T. muris relies upon the development of a Th 2 response while susceptibility correlates with a Th 1 response. In the present work, studies were conducted using the J and S isolates and the conventionally-studied E isolate. Firstly, the phylogenetic relationship between the E, J and S isolates was explored by comparing internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 2 sequences between the isolates and to other ITS 2 sequences from other Trichuris species. These analyses revealed the isolates to be extremely similar at this level. Following this, the immune response elicited by the E, J and S isolates of T. muris in male AKR, C 57 BL/ 6 and BALB/c mice was characterised. In BALB/c mice, all isolates were expelled and was, with all three isolates, associated with an elevated Th 2 response. In contrast, all three isolates persisted to chronicity in AKR mice but the E and S isolate elicited significantly higher IL- 12 while levels in J-infected mice were equivalent to naïve. Serum MMCP- 1 was significantly higher in J and E-infected mice compared with S-infected mice. Interestingly, differential worm expulsion kinetics occurred in the C 57 BL/ 6 mouse strain, with the E and J isolate expelled by d 35 p. i. but the S isolate was retained to chronicity. Furthermore, levels of Th 2 cytokines were markedly lower in S-infected mice while type 1 cytokines IL- 12 and IFN-γ were raised in all infected groups. The lower Th 2 response in S-infected mice was reflected in a lower goblet cell hyperplasia and a lower mastocytosis and eosinophilia. IgG 1 was equally raised while IgG 2 a was lowest in J-infected mice. In contrast, female C 57 BL/ 6 mice were able to mount a Th 2 response against the S isolate and expel most worms by d 35 p. i. Furthermore, survival of the S isolate is dependent upon MyD 88 thus MyD 88 KO mice expelled the S isolate in a Th 2 -dependent manner. To begin to address the mechanism underlying S persistence, the effects of isolate-specific E/S on DC were examined. Interestingly, CD 1 lc+ DC from C 57 BL/ 6 mice upregulated MHC II expression when stimulated with E and J E/S but did not with S E/S. Western blots showed parasite-specific E/S to be differentially recognised by mouse strain-specific antibody, with strong recognition of low molecular weight antigens being associated with susceptibility. Furthermore, E/S zymography revealed protease activity at approximately 20 kDa which was greatest in S isolate E/S. Inhibition studies showed differential protease activity between isolate specific E/S but all exhibited serine protease activity. Overall, these studies enhanced previous understanding of the immune response to T. muris as a whole thus highlighting the relevance parasite isolates have in <b>parasite</b> <b>immunology.</b> EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E

In vitro proliferation, IFN-gamma and IL- 4 induction were measured against two recombinant proteins of MSP 2, FC 27 and 3 D 7 as well as against a form of the 3 D 7 MSP 2 lacking the central repetitive sequences (d 3 D 7). The prevalence of proliferative response was generally low, 6 % for FC 27, 9 % for 3 D 7 and 11 % for d 3 D 7. A higher prevalence of IL- 4 response was obtained being 27 % for FC 27, 34 % for 3 D 7 and 30 % for d 3 D 7 while the prevalence of IFN-gamma response was 13 %, 15 % and 18 %, respectively. There was no correlation between age and proliferative responses; in contrast cytokine production increased with age for all three antigens. When proliferation or stimulation of either cytokine was used to assess T-cell activation the frequency of responders increased to 39 %, 47 % and 46 % for FC 27, 3 D 7 and d 3 D 7 respectively. Analysis of the relation of T cell responses to concurrent infection and morbidity showed that lymphoproliferative response only to d 3 D 7 was significantly associated with parasitaemia; while lymphoproliferative responses to all 3 MSP 2 antigens were highest in the group of clinical malaria cases. There was no significant correlation between proliferation or cytokine production to MSP 2 and concurrent or subsequent malaria morbidity...|$|E
