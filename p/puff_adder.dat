5|$|Sophie {{was seen}} {{much more in}} The Next Generation. She was the prime {{babysitter}} and target for roving males, particularly Wilson from the Commandos. In an early episode, Sophie climbed a tree in search of caterpillars, but slipped and fell, injuring one of her front paws. The Whiskers moved on, potentially abandoning Sophie, but the injured female managed to limp after them and quickly recovered. Shortly afterwards, Sophie was evicted, for mating with Wilson, by Rocket Dog, who was also pregnant by Wilson. Rocket Dog gave birth to two pups and allowed Sophie to rejoin the group once she aborted her litter. Sophie babysat the two pups, Nugget and Beaker, along with Simon. The babysitters {{decided to take the}} pups foraging, but they ran into the Aztecs and headed for bolt hole. Inside, Simon found a <b>puff</b> <b>adder,</b> but the Whiskers' babysitters couldn't escape due to the Aztecs, they were viciously blocking the entrance. Eventually, the rain forced the Aztecs to retreat, but with it being so late, the babysitters couldn't return to the main burrow. The next day, Sophie reunited the pups with the Whiskers, but Simon had died from a snake bite. Later on in the series, Sophie was evicted by pregnant subordinate female, Wiley Kat. But before long, Wiley Kat was also kicked out by Rocket Dog. In spite of what Wiley Kat had done to her, Sophie stayed with her, and the pair were quickly joined by Wilson and Philippe. During their time together the small family encountered a Genet and Sophie mated with Wilson. But the rovers eventually left. After that, Wiley Kat and her unborn litter simply disappeared, but pregnant Sophie managed to rejoin the Whiskers. She gave birth to three pups named Flashman, Pickle and Chips, and spent her time babysitting Juno. When Rocket Dog was bitten by a Cape cobra, Sophie led the Whiskers to a new burrow, where Rocket Dog eventually met up with them and slowly recovered from her bite. In this season, Sophie was played by Flower's daughter Ella because her other counterparts, Tina Sparkle and Finn were evicted. After Rocket Dog's Death, she became the dominant female of the Whiskers and still retains that position today.|$|E
50|$|<b>Puff</b> <b>adders</b> {{are found}} in Africa and the {{southern}} Arabian Peninsula.|$|R
50|$|Members of {{the genus}} are {{commonly}} known as African adders, African vipers, or <b>puff</b> <b>adders.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{rhinoceros}} viper {{is one of}} three species of <b>puff</b> <b>adders.</b> Some reasons these venomous snakes are called <b>puff</b> <b>adders</b> are that, when excited, they have the ability to enlarge their size considerably by inflating their bodies. This creates the [...] "puffed" [...] look that is approximately twice the normal size of the snake's body. These adders also make a sort of hissing noise through their nose as part of their respiratory function.|$|R
25|$|Most snakebites {{are caused}} by non-venomous snakes. Of the roughly 3,000 known species of snake found worldwide, only 15% are {{considered}} dangerous to humans. The <b>puff</b> <b>adder</b> {{is responsible for the}} most fatalities overall, although saw-scaled vipers inflict more bites in North African countries, where the <b>puff</b> <b>adder</b> is typically not found. The black mamba, although responsible for far fewer snakebite incidents, is the species which has the highest mortality rate in Africa and in the world.|$|E
25|$|The sheath {{may carry}} an {{embossment}} (abosodee) that comprises Ashanti symbols meant to evoke certain expressive messages. The mpomponsuo (responsibility) sword of the Asantehene, for example, has an embossment of a coiled snake with {{a bird in}} its mouth. This conveys the Ashanti message: nanka bobonya mede asase anya onwam – the <b>puff</b> <b>adder</b> that cannot fly has caught the hornbill that flies. This is used to symbolize patience, prudence, and circumspection.|$|E
25|$|It is {{estimated}} that there are around 100 African bush elephant left in Eritrea, the most northerly of East Africa's elephants. The endangered African wild dog (Lycaon pictus) was previously found in Eritrea, but is now deemed extirpated from the entire country. In Gash-Barka, deadly snakes like saw-scaled viper are common. <b>Puff</b> <b>adder</b> and red spitting cobra are widespread {{and can be found}} even in the highlands. In the coastal areas marine species that are common include dolphin, dugong, whale shark, turtles, marlin, swordfish, and manta ray.|$|E
5000|$|Pian Upe {{is home to}} {{enormous}} rock pythons {{and smaller}} but venomous <b>puff</b> <b>adders.</b> Harmless water snakes are also found there.|$|R
50|$|Martial eagles, tawny eagles and jackals are {{the main}} predators of meerkats. Meerkats {{sometimes}} die of snakebite in confrontations with snakes (<b>puff</b> <b>adders</b> and Cape cobras).|$|R
5000|$|The cowl of <b>Puff</b> <b>Adder's</b> costume {{contains}} a pressurized container of noxious gas {{which can be}} released from his mouth area. It is activated by a specific motion made with his jaw muscles.|$|R
25|$|Snakebite as a surreptitious form {{of murder}} has been {{featured}} in stories such as Sir Arthur Conan Doyle's The Adventure of the Speckled Band, but actual occurrences are virtually unheard of, {{with only a few}} documented cases. It has been suggested that Boris III of Bulgaria, who was allied to Nazi Germany during World War II, may have been killed with snake venom, although there is no definitive evidence. At least one attempted suicide by snakebite has been documented in medical literature involving a <b>puff</b> <b>adder</b> bite to the hand.|$|E
25|$|From 1905 Marais studied {{nature in}} the Waterberg ('Water mountain'), a {{wilderness}} area north of Pretoria, and wrote in his native Afrikaans about the animals he observed. His studies of termites led him {{to conclude that the}} colony ought to be considered as a single organism, a prescient insight that predated the elaboration of the idea by Richard Dawkins. In the Waterberg, Marais also studied the black mamba, spitting cobra and <b>puff</b> <b>adder.</b> Moreover, he observed a specific troop of baboons at length, and from these studies there sprang numerous magazine articles and the books My Friends the Baboons and The Soul of the Ape. He is acknowledged as the father of the scientific study of the behaviour of animals, known as Ethology.|$|E
25|$|Mambas, cobras, {{and some}} larger <b>puff</b> <b>adder</b> species may claim territories {{of up to}} , which are used by the snakes for hunting and reproduction. These snakes are large enough to defend their {{territory}} from intruders, including humans. The black mamba, in particular, {{is among the most}} venomous snakes in the world {{and one of the most}} aggressive. It is the longest snake on the continent and is able to move at , making it unusually dangerous. Although black mambas cause only 0.5-1% of snakebites in South Africa, they produce the highest mortality rate and the species is responsible for many snake bite fatalities. The black mamba is the species with the highest mortality rate in every single nation in which it occurs, despite not being responsible for the most numerous number of snakebites. It is also the species which has the highest mortality rate worldwide.|$|E
50|$|The Omo-Bottego River {{formed the}} eastern {{boundaries}} {{for the former}} kingdoms of Janjero, and Garo. The Omo also flows past the Mago and Omo National Parks, which {{are known for their}} wildlife. Many animals live near and on the river, including hippopotamuses, crocodiles and <b>puff</b> <b>adders.</b>|$|R
50|$|There are 40 snake species, nine {{of which}} are venomous, such as cobras, <b>puff</b> <b>adders</b> and mambas, genus Dendroaspis; the first two are common. The non-venomous {{reptiles}} are pythons, bush snakes, lizards agamas and skinks (with brown and orange flanks); Bose’s monitor, Nile monitors (Varanus niloticus), which are voracious predators; tree geckos; and chameleon.|$|R
50|$|Some Dinka people respect African <b>puff</b> <b>adders.</b> The most {{commonly}} respected snakes are Atemyath, Biar keroor, and Maluang. These snakes are given local made molten cheese to appease them, {{after which they}} are released into the forest. Killing these snakes {{is believed to be}} a bad omen for the community or the individual, with the assumption that spirits may strike the killer.|$|R
500|$|Shakespeare, {{named after}} the famous playwright, was one of Flower's sons. [...] Billed as [...] "courageous" [...] in the opening {{sequence}} of series one, he was bitten in the lower jaw and in the thigh by a <b>puff</b> <b>adder</b> in the first episode. [...] He recovered, however, and {{continued to be a}} strong contributor to the Whiskers group. Near the end of series one, he was the lone babysitter protecting Flower's most recent pups when the Lazuli group found the burrow, and [...] Shakespeare put himself between the pups and Big Si, the Lazuli's dominant male at the time. [...] When the Whiskers returned and dispatched the Lazuli, the pups were alive but Shakespeare could not be found.|$|E
500|$|Lola, the {{dominant}} female of the Zappa {{at the beginning}} of the third series, regularly commandeered food from her subordinates. Lola disappeared from the group for two days after being bitten by a <b>puff</b> <b>adder.</b> [...] After she struggled to make her way home, her younger sister Punk took advantage of her weakened state and took over as dominant female. [...] Though Lola recovered from the snake bite, she continued to accept Punk as the new leader. When the Zappa later ran from a confrontation with the Whiskers, Lola left behind a pup she was carrying, Axel, who was adopted by the Whiskers. Zaphod once visited the Zappa burrow and almost mated with Lola, but was chased off by Houdini. Lola was instrumental in defending Punk's newborn pups during an attack by the newly formed Aztec group.|$|E
500|$|Two {{forms of}} puffadder shyshark were once recognized: [...] "Cape" [...] and [...] "Natal", which {{differed}} in appearance and habitat preferences. In 2006, the [...] "Natal" [...] form {{was described as}} a new species, the Natal shyshark. A 2006 phylogenetic analysis, based on three mitochondrial DNA genes, found that the puffadder shyshark is the most basal member of its family, with a sister relationship to the clade containing the dark shyshark (H. pictus) and the brown shyshark (H. fuscus). The Natal shyshark {{was not included in the}} study, though it is very close morphologically to this species. The common name [...] "puffadder shyshark" [...] refers to the <b>puff</b> <b>adder</b> (Bitis arietans), a widely distributed African viper with similar coloration. [...] "Happy Eddie" [...] (from the scientific name Haploblepharus edwardsii) is used by academics for this shark, and was recently introduced to the public as an easily remembered alternative to the ambiguous vernaculars [...] "shyshark" [...] and [...] "doughnut", which can apply to several different species and have confounded research efforts.|$|E
50|$|Heterodon is a genus of {{harmless}} {{colubrid snakes}} endemic to North America. They are stout with upturned snouts and are {{perhaps best known}} for their characteristic threat displays. Three species are currently recognized. Members of the genus are commonly known as hog-nosed snakes, North American hog-nosed snakes, and sometimes <b>puff</b> <b>adders</b> (though they {{should not be confused with}} the venomous African vipers of the genus Bitis).|$|R
50|$|In Africa, hyraxes are preyed on by leopards, Egyptian cobras, <b>puff</b> <b>adders,</b> rock pythons, caracals, wild dogs, hawks, and owls. Verreaux's eagle in {{particular}} is a specialist hunter of hyrax. In Israel, the rock hyrax is reportedly rarely preyed upon by terrestrial predators, as their system of sentries and their reliable refuges provide considerable protection. Hyrax remains are almost absent from the droppings of wolves in the Judean Desert.|$|R
50|$|Flowers are pollinated by solitary bees, honey bees, {{carpenter}} bees, {{and many}} beetle species. Leaves are eaten by tortoises. Flowers are eaten by antelopes and baboons. Fruits are eaten by baboons, rodents, porcupines, antelopes, who also disperse the seeds. The clumps provide shelter for snails, lizards, and skinks. <b>Puff</b> <b>adders</b> and other snakes, {{such as the}} Cape cobra, are often found in Carpobrotus clumps, where they ambush the small rodents attracted by the fruits.|$|R
500|$|A {{daughter}} of Flower, Mozart was originally {{a member of}} the Whiskers group. [...] Referred to as [...] "the caring" [...] one in the first series credits, Mozart was always ready to lend a helping hand for the family. [...] When her littermate Shakespeare was bitten by a <b>puff</b> <b>adder</b> in the first episode, she stayed at his side and kept him company until he recovered. [...] Mozart was temporarily exiled from the Whiskers group several times for having pups. [...] Her first eviction came part way through the first series and lasted only one episode. [...] Her second eviction in the next series was ended by her miscarrying. Near {{the end of the second}} series, Mozart again became pregnant, and then made the unusual move of evicting her sister Daisy from the Whiskers. Flower led the Whiskers to a new home and left Mozart alone at the burrows with her newborn pups, effectively evicting her. [...] The Commandoes killed Mozart's pups in the next episode while Mozart was on the search for food.|$|E
500|$|Rocket Dog {{is one of}} Flower's many {{daughters and}} would later become the {{dominant}} female of the Whiskers group. [...] When the Whiskers group temporarily split into two groups during a drought and food shortage in the third series, Rocket Dog assumed {{the leadership of the}} splinter group. She mated with a roving Zappa male {{in the middle of the}} third series, but her pups died in a premature birth caused by the strain of her new-found leadership. When the splinter group was reunited with the Whiskers, Rocket Dog returned to being a subordinate female under her mother without any fuss. After Flower's death near the end of the series, Rocket Dog permanently assumed leadership of the entire Whiskers group, and moved the group to a new burrow. Wilson, a roving male from the Commandoes, attempted to mate with Rocket Dog, but was chased off by Zaphod, Flower's former partner and still dominant male. [...] In the last episode of the third series, Maybelline rebelled against her sister's rule, but Rocket Dog was able to maintain leadership, causing Maybelline to leave the Whiskers and start her own group. In the finale of Season 4, Rocket Dog is bitten by a <b>puff</b> <b>adder.</b> Rocket Dog survives the deadly bite. After filming of the fourth series concluded, and before it aired, several newspapers reported that Rocket Dog was killed while crossing a road on 28 April 2008 and that Animal Planet planned to include a tribute to her at the end of the series. A note was also posted to the Friends of the Kalahari Meerkat website; it was subsequently removed along with all other post season updates, at the request of Animal Planet, but was restored after the fourth series finished airing.|$|E
2500|$|Causus venom is {{weaker than}} that of <b>puff</b> <b>adder.</b> Envenomation {{normally}} causes only local pain and swelling. Antivenin treatment should not be necessary. Nevertheless, South African polyvalent serum {{is known to be}} effective against the venom of at least two species. [...] However, envenomation can be very serious and in at least one case a bitten child had to have a fasciotomy. [...] A number of small dogs have had limbs amputated or died due to bites from this snake. The danger from this snake should not be underestimated as a bite from a large individual on a small child could potentially be fatal.|$|E
50|$|Striped ground {{squirrels}} are diurnal herbivores, {{and spend}} almost {{their entire lives}} on the ground, although are capable of climbing into bushes to reach food. They eat a range of seeds, nuts, and roots, and can be an agricultural pest, eating crops such as cassava, yams, cotton bolls, peanuts, and sweet potatoes. They may occasionally supplement their diet with eggs, insects, and other small animals. Their predators include servals, jackals, birds of prey, and common <b>puff</b> <b>adders.</b>|$|R
50|$|Kisumu Museum, {{established}} in 1980, has {{a series of}} outdoor pavilions {{laid out in a}} formation similar to that of a Luo homestead. Some of the pavilions contain live animals. For example, one pavilion contains numerous aquaria {{with a wide variety of}} fish from Lake Victoria, along with explanatory posters. Another pavilion contains terrarium containing mambas, spitting cobras, <b>puff</b> <b>adders</b> and other venomous Kenyan snakes. Additionally, out of doors, the museum has a few additional exhibits, including a snake pit and a crocodile container.|$|R
50|$|Rock monitor lizard, {{water monitor}} lizard, giant plated lizard, rainbow skink, ground agama and {{speckled}} thick toed gecko {{have all been}} seen in Mapungubwe National Park.There {{are estimated to be}} at least thirty-two species of snake in the park, although only fifteen have thus far been confirmed. Some of these species include the southern African python, snouted cobra, black mamba, both horned and <b>puff</b> <b>adders,</b> and at least three species of whip or sand snakes. Nile crocodile occur in and along the Limpopo River.|$|R
60|$|A {{few seconds}} later we {{discovered}} the reason. The horse had shied at a sleeping <b>puff</b> <b>adder</b> which was curled up in the sand of that little frequented road, and on this <b>puff</b> <b>adder</b> Savage had descended with so much force, for he weighed thirteen stone, that the creature was squashed quite flat and never stirred again. This, however, he did not notice in his agitation, being convinced indeed that it was hanging to him behind like a bulldog.|$|E
60|$|Tabitha looked round for her goat, and perceiving it at {{a little}} distance, ran to fetch it, since the creature, being engaged in eating {{something}} to its taste, would not come at her call. She seized it by the neck to drag it away, {{with the result that}} its fore-feet, obstinately set upon the wall, overturned a large stone, revealing a great <b>puff</b> <b>adder</b> that was sleeping there.|$|E
60|$|There are, of course, {{exceptions}} to all such widely founded laws; there are poisonous berries of scarlet, and pestilent skies that are fair. But, if we once honestly compare a venomous wood-fungus, rotting into black dissolution of dripped slime at its edges, with a spring gentian; or a <b>puff</b> <b>adder</b> with a salmon trout, or a fog in Bermondsey {{with a clear}} sky at Berne, we shall get hold of the entire question on its right side; and be able afterwards to study at our leisure, or accept without doubt or trouble, facts of apparently contrary meaning. And the practical lesson which I wish to leave with the reader is, that lovely flowers, and green trees growing in the open air, are the proper guides of men to the places which their Maker intended them to inhabit; while the flowerless and treeless deserts--of reed, or sand, or rock,--are meant to be either heroically invaded and redeemed, or surrendered to the wild creatures which are appointed for them; happy and wonderful in their wild abodes.|$|E
