40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the automated characterization {{of real estate}} (real property) for Internet mapping. It proposes a processing framework to achieve this task from <b>vertical</b> <b>aerial</b> photography and associated property information. A demonstration of the feasibility of an automated solution builds on test data from the Austrian City of Graz. Information is extracted from <b>vertical</b> <b>aerial</b> photography and various data products derived from that photography {{in the form of}} a true orthophoto, a dense digital surface model and digital terrain model, and a classification of land cover. Maps of cadastral property boundaries aid in defining real properties. Our goal is to develop a table for each property with descriptive numbers about the buildings, their dimensions, number of floors, number of windows, roof shapes, impervious surfaces, garages, sheds, vegetation, presence of a basement floor, and other descriptors of interest for each and every property of a city. From aerial sources, at a pixel size of 10 cm, we show that we have obtained positional accuracies in the range of a single pixel, an accuracy of areas in the 10 % range, floor counts at an accuracy of 93 % and window counts at 86 % accuracy.

40|$|The University of Surrey is {{situated}} on the northern slopes of Stag Hill, below Guildford Cathedral, which occupies the summit. During the investigation {{for the design of}} the University, it became apparent that the site was underlain by a large landslip, 500 m wide from east to west and extending 160 m from rear scarp to toe. Considerable effort was made to establish its geometry and extent (Skempton & Petley (1967), and Morgenstern & Tchalenko (1967)). In recent years it was realised that because the construction of the Cathedral extended {{over a long period of}} time, the likelihood of Stag Hill being covered by oblique aerial photography would be high. Some forty oblique aerial photographs, spanning the period 1949 to 1982, were collected and analysed together with <b>vertical</b> <b>aerial</b> photographs and topographic maps. Although the landslip is visible on <b>vertical</b> <b>aerial</b> photographs, individual elements are not easily identified. Using oblique photography, in particular that in which recognition of subdued topography has been enhanced by low sun angles, up to six phases of landslipping were identified. This paper uses this example to demonstrate the usefulness of aerial photography in site investigation and in particular the value of oblique photography, a topic which receives little attention in BS 5930 : 1981 considering how cost effective this tool can be...|$|R
40|$|The Waitakaruru Arboretum and Sculpture Park {{is located}} on the Waikato-side of a border that {{separates}} the Waikato and Matamata-Piako district council areas. The arboretum {{can be found at the}} southern end of the Waikato/Matamata-Piako border. MÄ?ori first settled in the area in the early 1300 's, although little is known today of the area's pre-colonial history. European missionaries arrived in the 1830 's to establish the first missions. Traders then arrived in growing numbers during the 1850 's, and the first permanent PÄ?kehÄ? settlements were established from 1865 following the MÄ?ori land wars and subsequent land confiscations, which resulted in large tracts of swamp being cleared by PÄ?kehÄ? for agricultural farming. The original boundary line that separates the Waikato and Matamata/Piako Districts was first drawn in 1864 following the land wars, and was later used to determine the then new council boundaries in 1876 when the District Councils were first established. The boundary includes one particularly long perfectly straight line at about 10 degrees counter-clockwise from true north on the compass. This boundary line stretches for over 43 kms from the Orakei Stream in the north to Pukemoremore Hill just south of the Waitakaruru Arboretum. The boundary line encompasses mainly farmland plus 3 roads along its path: Manuel Road, Valentine Road and Pukemoremore Road. Although not easily visible from the ground, the scale of this 43 km long perfectly straight divide can be clearly seen from the air. absolute divide reflects the artificial border or aukati that separates the Waikato and Matamata-Piako districts. Using locally produced timber for fencing, plus sheets of marine plywood for the image substrate, a series of 180 <b>vertical</b> <b>aerial</b> photographs have been digitally stitched together to make one long single image that has been printed directly onto plywood using the latest eco-printing technology.

40|$|This study identified, {{quantified}} {{and analyzed}} changes in {{land use and}} cover {{on the campus of}} Federal University of Lavras campus, located in Lavras city (Minas Gerais State). The 2009 QuickBird satellite imagery and 1985, 1979, 1971, 1964 <b>vertical</b> <b>aerial</b> photographs were used to produce a set of land use and land cover maps. The work started with the orthorectification of the QuickBird satellite imagery and <b>vertical</b> <b>aerial</b> photographs. The identification and definition of land cover and land use classes were obtained from field surveys in 2009. First, the land cover and land use maps were made from that information. Finally, the quantification and analysis of changes were performed at the imagery time range. The results showed that in 2009 the "urbanized area class" of the campus reached 65. 79 ha and that the most significant increase of this class occurred between the years 1964 (6. 24 ha) and 1971 (24. 4 ha). The smallest area of "forest land class" found on the campus was 38. 38 ha in 1971, and from 1979 on this situation has been improved reaching 113. 18 ha of "forest land class" in 2009. For the "water class" there was not any dam constructed yet in the campus before 1971. Most of the campus area, previously used for "agricultural land class" had a significant reduction within this category, from 384. 19 ha in 1964 to 271. 16 ha in 2009...|$|R

40|$|Os mapas foram tidos, outrora, como linguagem essencial da ciência geográfica. No período atual, juntam-se a eles as fotografias aéreas verticais e as imagens orbitais. As primeiras foram utilizadas sobremaneira nas investigações geográficas em contexto acadêmico-científico, complementadas atualmente pelas imagens orbitais. Essas duas linguagens estão circulando um jeito novo de olhar e conceber o espaço, seja ele próximo (percorrido diariamente por nosso corpo) ou distante (experimentado via imagens orbitais, entre outros tipos de imagens). Os diferentes tipos de imagens orbitais e fotografias aéreas verticais estão produzindo em nós uma dada memória visual acerca do que venha a ser a realidade do espaço geográfico em suas diversas manifestações cotidianas. Assim, pergunto: em que contexto tais imagens assumem o status de serem reais ou tão semelhantes à realidade, de modo a parecer que são, de fato, verdadeiras ou a própria realidade geográfica? O que supostamente nos leva a acreditar nas imagens como uma (re) apresentação da realidade?

Ao final, destacarei os exemplos do status de realidade nas fotografias aéreas verticais. Maps {{used to be}} {{considered}} an essential language of the geographical science.
