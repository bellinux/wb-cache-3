40|$|Although the {{paperless}} office (PLO) management {{system has been}} established {{with the goal of}} paper usage reduction, demand for paper has still showed an uptrend over the years. Given the substantial pressure on forest ecosystems due to a continued increase of paper consumption, understanding the behavioral aspects of paper consumption is, therefore, required. This present paper aims at exploring the factors underlying paper consumption behavior. Empirical data was acquired through a survey of 266 Indonesian students, involving both undergraduate and postgraduate students. A theoretical model, based on the Comprehensive Action Determination Model (CADM), was tested against the empirical data. It was found that the model received reasonable support from the data. Results indicate that reducing paper consumption behavior is strongly influenced by habit and, marginally significant, by intention. Furthermore, habit formation is influenced by both normative processes and situational influences. The results, to some extent, explain the PLO paradox {{in a way that the}} PLO program should have focused on breaking the habit of paper usage instead of promoting the benefits of PLO. Introducing a <b>paper</b> <b>quota</b> and rationing (fee) to new students, as the main target, is a potential policy intervention implied from the results...|$|E
40|$|Thesis {{submitted}} in partial fulfilment of {{the requirements}} for the Degree of Master of Technology (Business Administration) Cape Peninsula University of Technology, 2013 New Black business entrants into the South African fishing industry are confronted {{with a range of}} challenges on the road to full sustainability. In addition to the need to compete with established white commercial companies with vast resources, most of the successful applicants who won rights ended up with nothing but a <b>paper</b> <b>quota</b> because most do not have their own boats to either catch their allotted quota, or they lack the facilities to process their catch. In this thesis an organisational needs analysis of a select number of emerging fishing enterprises was undertaken with a view to determine their specific needs for support services in order to make recommendations with regard to a customised support programme to assist them in their quest for business sustainability. The research indicates {{that the majority of the}} emerging enterprises are first-generation novice businesses with a need for a comprehensive range of support services. They not only lack a full understanding of the inherent risks of their industry, but most have failed to do any sort of risk planning. This lack of understanding not only constrains their engagement with fishing policy processes but also contributes to a situation of dependence on external consultants for the preparation and submission of their rights allocation applications. Furthermore, most of the current crop of business leaders have a low level of formal education and did not receive any business training prior to venturing into the industry. This vicious cycle of general ignorance of the risky nature of their sector, lack of understanding of industry process, and low education levels, has resulted in limited understanding and knowledge of the various forms of financial and other assistance available to emerging businesses. The researcher recommends intervention in all of the areas mentioned above as critical if the stated objective of the South African government, namely the promotion of black economic empowerment, is to be achieved...|$|E

Weidenfeld was keen to expand into book publishing and Contact, which appeared with a hard cover, offered a means of circumventing post-war <b>paper</b> <b>quotas.</b> Among those Clarissa persuaded {{to contribute to the}} magazine was the cookery writer Elizabeth David, whose recipes were to become very influential in the 1950s.

50|$|During World War II, from 1942 to 1944, Duras {{worked for}} the Vichy {{government}} in an office that allocated <b>paper</b> <b>quotas</b> to publishers (in the process operating a de facto book censorship system), {{but she was also}} a member of the French Resistance as a part of a small group that also included François Mitterrand, who later became President of France and remained a life-long friend of Duras. During the war, Antelme was deported to Buchenwald in 1944 for his involvement in the Resistance, and barely survived the experience (weighing on his release, according to Duras, just 38 kg). She nursed him back to health, but they divorced once he recovered his health.|$|R
25|$|Although the Jewish {{settlement}} in Palestine was {{dismayed by the}} publication of the 1939 White Paper restricting Jewish immigration, David Ben-Gurion remained undeterred, believing that the policy would not be implemented, and in fact Neville Chamberlain had told him that the policy would last at the very most only {{for the duration of the}} war. In the event the White <b>Paper</b> <b>quotas</b> were exhausted only in December 1944, over five and a half years later, and in the same period the United Kingdom absorbed 50,000 Jewish refugees and the British Commonwealth (Australia, Canada and South Africa) took many thousands more. During the War over 30,000 Jews joined the British forces and even the Irgun ceased operations against the British until 1944.|$|R
500|$|Despite its {{relatively}} high price, the comic {{was an immediate}} success; released on 14April 1950, and despite government <b>paper</b> <b>quotas,</b> the first issue sold about 900,000 copies. [...] Eight of its twenty pages were presented in four-colour rotogravure. [...] Eagle was designed to entertain and educate its readers; although a typical issue might contain such characters as Cavendish Brown, Harris Tweed, Jack O'Lantern, Storm Nelson and Luck of the Legion, it also included a special news section, a sports page, and school stories. [...] Each issue also featured a centre-spread full-colour cutaway illustration {{of a piece of}} machinery—the first detailed {{the inner workings of the}} British Rail 18000 locomotive. [...] Such high quality strips as Riders of the Range and P.C.49 helped ensure a weekly circulation of almost a million copies, but it was the adventures of Dan Dare, Pilot of the Future, which most captivated readers. [...] Created by Hampson—now a full-time staff artist with his own team—Dan Dare was the UK's first science-fiction comic strip of any significance. [...] Readers were thrilled by the square-jawed British spaceman's weekly exploits, and his struggles with The Mekon.|$|R

40|$|When {{firms can}} supply several {{separate}} markets, collusion can take two forms. Either firms establish production quotas {{on all the}} markets, or they share markets. This <b>paper</b> compares production <b>quotas</b> and market sharing agreements in a Cournot duopoly where firms incur a fixed cost for serving each market. We show that there exists a threshold value of the fixed cost such that collusion is easier to sustain with production quotas below the threshold and with market sharing agreements above the threshold. These results are obtained both under Nash reversion strategies and the globally optimal punishment strategies introduced by Abreu (1986) ...|$|R
40|$|Conventional {{knowledge}} {{on the effectiveness}} of gender quotas for enhancing women’s political participation has, to date, been unanimous on the superiority of quotas in proportional representation (PR) systems. Yet this view overlooks the many possible alternatives to implementing gender quotas in single-member district (SMD) systems. This <b>paper</b> studies gender <b>quotas</b> (or temporary special measures, TSMs) in SMD electoral systems. Drawing on case examples from Uganda, France, India and elsewhere, we refute the myth of the incompatibility of quotas in SMDs. Our research investigates and presents multiple ways in which quotas can be successfully implemented in SMDs...|$|R

This <b>paper</b> investigates the <b>quota</b> version of the Prize Collecting Steiner Tree Problem (PCSTP) on a graph as a generalization of the well-known Steiner tree problem. For this challenging network design problem that arises in telecommunication settings, we present three MIP formulations: (a) the first one is a compact Miller-Tucker-Zemlin (MTZ-) based formulation, (b) the second one is derived through lifting the MTZ constraints, and (c) the third one is based on the RLT technique. We report the results of extensive computational experiments on large PCSTP instances, having up to 2500 nodes using a general-purpose MIP solver...|$|R

40|$|This <b>paper</b> investigates sales <b>quota</b> {{dynamics}} at a Fortune 500 firm. We offer theoretical {{justifications for}} observed quota updating processes and test three particular hypotheses {{related to the}} issue. First, current year quotas are computed as a weighted average of last year’s sales and last year’s quota (Bayesian Updating). Second, this year’s sales quota increases more when last year’s sales exceed last year’s quota than this year’s quota falls when last year’s sales do not exceed last year’s quota (Asymmetric ratcheting). And third, the quota setting process is influenced by market and salesperson heterogeneity. Our empirical results support the hypotheses of dynamic quota updating, asymmetric ratcheting, and of heterogeneity in the quota setting proces...|$|R
40|$|Research PaperIndividual {{fishing quota}} {{programs}} {{are increasingly being}} used to establish property rights in commercial fisheries in the U. S. These programs are intended to promote resource conservation while improving economic efficiency. However, these rationalization programs are often criticized for their distributional consequences. In the Gulf of Alaska halibut fishery, there is concern that fishing quota are leaving small, remote Alaska fishing communities (SRFCs). In this <b>paper,</b> we analyze <b>quota</b> share transactional data from 1994 to 1999 and find support for the hypothesis that halibut fishing quota holdings are migrating away from SRFCs. Using the same data, we analyze the differences between buyers and sellers of quota to assess which factors contribute most to an individual's decision {{to buy or sell}} quota shares. The results support the hypothesis that characteristics of an individual's community influence the decision to buy or sell, and that these community-based factors may collectively be more important than individual characteristics such as one's age...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In April 1989, the Norwegian {{fisheries}} authorities {{declared a}} moratorium on fishing by the Norwegian fleet for Barents Sea Cod (Gadus morhua). It subse-quently introduced a multi-level boat quota system within the coastal cod fishery north of the sixty-second latitude in 1990. This <b>paper</b> treats the <b>quota</b> regime as a national manifestation of neo-liberal globalising processes. It provides a macro-level, gendered analysis of trends in fishing registrants since the regime was in-troduced. At the micro-level it explores examples of gendered responses to the regime including the ways some women and men re-arranged their lives. The micro-level discussion draws on findings from gender-informed ethnographic research in Northern Norway’s fishery communities carried out since the begin-ning of the 1970 s including, in particular, fieldwork undertaken in 2003 and 2004 in Skarsvåg, a fishing village in the municipality of Nordkapp in the county of Finnmark. Following Ramamurthy, it focuses {{on some of the}} gendered perplexi-ties, or joys and aches of globalised life that followed the introduction of the quota regime. The analysis shows that, for fisheries, as in other industrial sectors, the notion of perplexity can help us understand the uneven and conflicting conse-quences of globalisation for women and men...|$|R
40|$|Email spam {{has reached}} {{alarming}} proportions because it costs virtually nothing to send email; {{even a small}} number of people responding to a spam message is adequate incentive for a spammer to send as many messages as possible. Since spammers need to send messages at high rates to as many recipients as they can, quotas on email senders could throttle spam. We argue for separating the allocation of quotas, a relatively rare activity, from the enforcement of quotas, a frequent activity that must scale to the billions of messages sent daily. This <b>paper</b> tackles the <b>quota</b> enforcement problem, where the goal is to ensure that no sender can grossly violate its quota. The challenge is to design an enforcement scheme that is scalable, is robust against malicious attackers or participants, and preserves the privacy of communication, in a large, distributed, and untrusted environment. We discuss the design of such a system, Spam-Iam, based on a managed distributed hash table (DHT) interface, showing that it can be used in conjunction with electronic stamps (for quota allocation) to ensure that any non-negligible reuse of stamps will be detected. 1...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to provide {{information}} on the current standing of the Czech Republic in the International Monetary Fund (IMF) with respect to its role as one of the main institutions that tries to solve contemporary problems of world economy on the one hand, and the problems of the IMF itself on the other hand. The paper focuses on individual phases of the country’s membership since 1990, when the Czech Republic joined the IMF. It provides information on both reasons for and forms of financial and technical help that the Czech Republic has utilised until now, and the help that the Czech Republic has provided to weaker members of the International Monetary Fund. Also, the <b>paper</b> analyses the <b>quota</b> reform and the IMF governance and their impact on the Czech Republic’s standing within the institution. It draws attention to a rising foreign exchange exposure of the Czech Republic to the IMF that originates from both an increase in membership quotas and extending of loans to other members.

40|$|This paper {{develops}} and analyzes {{a welfare}} maximizing model of infant industry protection. The domestic infant industry is competitive and experiences dynamic learning effects that are external to Þrms. The competitive foreign industry is mature and produces a good {{that is an}} imperfect substitute for the domestic good. A government planner can protect the infant industry using domestic production subsidies, tariffs, or quotas {{in order to maximize}} domestic welfare over time. As protection is not always optimal (even though the domestic industry experiences a learning externality), the paper shows how the decision to protect the industry should depend on the industry’s learning potential, the shape of the learning curve, and the degree of substitutability between domestic and foreign goods. Assuming some reasonable restrictions on the ßexibility over time of the policy instruments, the paper subsequently compares the effectiveness of the different instruments. Given such restrictions, the <b>paper</b> shows that <b>quotas</b> induce higher welfare levels than tariffs. In some cases, the dominance of the quota is so pronounced that it compensates for any amount of government revenue loss related to the administration of the quota (inclusing the case of a voluntary export restraint, where no revenue is collected). In similar cases, the quota may even be preferred to a domestic production subsidy...|$|R
