40|$|Fruit remains such as cherries, <b>plums,</b> <b>sloes</b> <b>and</b> peaches are {{frequently}} recovered from archaeological waterlogged contexts. During an archaeological excavation {{in the city}} centre of Sassari (Italy), in 2007, a medieval well, dated at 1330 - 1360 AD, was discovered. The sediment appeared very rich in waterlogged plant remains and a consistent presence of Prunus endocarps, attributed to different species, was recorded. Thanks to the exceptional state of preservation of the remains, the morphological and morphometric analysis was performed. The discrimination among Prunus species is routinely based on visual evaluations of some traditional morphological characters of the endocarps. Currently, computer vision and image analysis techniques represent a more accurate, reliable and repeatable method to distinguish wild species from cultivated ones. Digital images, acquired with a flatbed scanner, were processed and analysed using the image analysis software KS- 400 (Carl Zeiss Vision, Germany). A macro, specifically developed to measure endocarps of the Prunus L. genus, allowed measuring 33 morpho-colorimetric features and 80 elliptic Fourier descriptors (EFDs). In this work, the results obtained from the comparison between archaeological endocarps and the modern samples of Prunus collected in Sardinia, are presented. A clear statistical discrimination among 17 P. domestica, 111 P. domestica subsp. insistitia and 130 P. spinosa archaeological endocarps, was achieved. Moreover, from the comparison with the modern endocarps samples, the medieval ones were correctly identified with an overall percentage of 98. 4...|$|R

40|$|The tremorogenic fungal metabolite, paxilline, {{is widely}} used as a potent and {{relatively}} specific blocker of Ca 2 +- <b>and</b> voltage-activated <b>Slo</b> 1 (or BK) K+ channels. The pH-regulated Slo 3 K+ channel, a Slo 1 homologue, is resistant to blockade by paxilline. Taking advantage of the marked differences in paxilline sensitivity and the homology between subunits, we have examined the paxilline sensitivity {{of a set of}} chimeric Slo 1 /Slo 3 subunits. Paxilline sensitivity is associated with elements of the S 5 –P loop–S 6 module of the Slo 1 channel. Replacement of the Slo 1 S 5 segment or {{the second half of the}} P loop results in modest changes in paxilline sensitivity. Replacing the Slo 1 S 6 segment with the Slo 3 sequence abolishes paxilline sensitivity. An increase in paxilline affinity and changes in block kinetics also result from replacing the first part of the Slo 1 P loop, the so-called turret, with Slo 3 sequence. The <b>Slo</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Slo</b> 3 S 6 segments differ at 10 residues. Slo 1 -G 311 S was found to markedly reduce paxilline block. In constructs with a Slo 3 S 6 segment, S 300 G restored paxilline block, but most effectively when paired with a Slo 1 P loop. Other S 6 residues differing between <b>Slo</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Slo</b> 3 had little influence on paxilline block. The involvement of Slo 1 G 311 in paxilline sensitivity suggests that paxilline may occupy a position within the central cavity or access its blocking position through the central cavity. To explain the differences in paxilline sensitivity between <b>Slo</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Slo</b> 3, we propose that the G 311 /S 300 position in <b>Slo</b> 1 <b>and</b> <b>Slo</b> 3 underlies a structural difference between subunits in the bend of S 6, which influences the occupancy by paxilline...|$|R

40|$|Background: The pH <b>and</b> voltage-regulated <b>Slo</b> 3 K+ channel, a {{homologue}} of the Ca 2 +- <b>and</b> voltage-regulated <b>Slo</b> 1 K+ channel, {{is thought}} to be primarily expressed in sperm, but the properties of Slo 3 studied in heterologous systems differ somewhat from the native sperm KSper pH-regulated current. There is the possibility that critical partners that regulate Slo 3 function remain unidentified. The extensive amino acid identity between <b>Slo</b> 3 <b>and</b> <b>Slo</b> 1 suggests that auxiliary b subunits regulating Slo 1 channels might coassemble with <b>and</b> modulate <b>Slo</b> 3 channels. Four distinct b subunits composing the KCNMB family are known to regulate the function <b>and</b> expression of <b>Slo</b> 1 Channels. Methodology/Principal Findings: To examine the ability of the KCNMB family of auxiliary b subunits to regulate Slo 3 function, we co-expressed <b>Slo</b> 3 <b>and</b> each b subunit in heterologous expression systems and investigated the functional consequences by electrophysiological and biochemical analyses. The b 4 subunit produced an 8 – 10 fold enhancement of Slo 3 current expression in Xenopus oocytes and a similar enhancement of Slo 3 surface expression as monitored by YFP-tagged Slo 3 or biotin labeled Slo 3. Neither b 1, b 2, nor b 3 mimicked the ability of b 4 to increase surface expression, although biochemical tests suggested that all four b subunits are competent to coassemble with Slo 3. Fluorescence microscopy from b 4 KO mice, in which an eGFP tag replaced the deleted exon, revealed that b 4 gene promoter is active in spermatocytes. Furthermore, quantitative RT-PCR demonstrated that b 4 <b>and</b> <b>Slo</b> 3 exhibit comparable mRNA abundance in both testes an...|$|R
