Previous research has focused on barriers to the uptake of care plans. This study examined the effect of multidisciplinary care plans on provision and outcome of care for patients with type 2 diabetes. METHODS: A retrospective before/after medical record audit design was chosen. Subjects of the study were general practitioners practising in Southwest Sydney (New South Wales) and their diabetic patients who had written care plans. Outcome measures were frequency and results of glycosylated haemoglobin, blood <b>pressure,</b> <b>foot,</b> serum lipids, weight, and microalbumin checks. RESULTS: The medical records of 230 patients were audited. Following the care plan, adherence to diabetes guidelines increased. Metabolic control and cardiovascular risk factors improved for patients who had multidisciplinary care implemented.

40|$|Diabetes {{mellitus}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} common diseases around the world, and mainly affects the foot among the human body parts. The main causes of the diabetic foot are neuropathy, peripheral arterial disease and foot deformities; it leads to foot ulceration. Generally, sensory loss, high plantar <b>pressure,</b> <b>foot</b> deformities, inappropriate footwear, blindness, and age are the causing risk factors for developing foot ulceration in diabetic patients. Foot ulceration will result in prolonged hospitalization, high medical expenses, and serious complications with lower extremity amputation. For a long time, appropriate footwear has been recommended by physicians for reducing plantar pressure to prevent foot ulceration, the risk of amputation, and re-ulceration. A review is provided in this article towards the existing literature on the causes and prevalence of the diabetic foot, foot ulceration, off-loading pressure, footwear modification for different types of diabetic foot deformities, and types of footwear and textile materials used in footwear insoles for healing purposes.

Behavioral measures included neck vending angle (horizontal and vertical), back <b>pressure,</b> <b>foot</b> pressure, COP (Center of Pressure) movement on sitting surface, and tracking error in driving simulator task. Drowsy states were predicted by means of the multinomial logistic regression model where physiological and behavioral measures and subjective evaluation of drowsiness corresponded to independent variables and a dependent variable, respectively. First, we compared the effectiveness of two methods (correlation coefficient-based method and odds ratio-based method) for determining the order of entering behavioral measures into the prediction model. It was found that the prediction accuracy did not differ between both methods. Second, the prediction accuracy was compared among the numbers of behavioral measures. The prediction accuracy did not differ among four, five, and six behavioral measures, and it was concluded that entering at least four behavioral measures into the prediction model is enough to achieve higher prediction accuracy. Third, the prediction accuracy was compared between the strongly drowsy and the weakly drowsy group. The prediction accuracy differed between the two groups, and the proposed method was effective (the prediction accuracy was significantly higher) especially under the condition where drowsiness was induced to a larger extent...|$|E

40|$|The human foot is {{a complex}} {{mechanical}} structure consisting of bones, ligaments and joints. They act together to provide a robust system capable of absorbing and dissipating the intermitted pressure that is subjected to its plantar surface during walking to prevent soft tissue breakdown.

40|$|During {{walking on}} a {{treadmill}} 10 human subjects (mean age 20 years) were perturbed by 100 ms pushes or pulls {{to the left or}} the right, of various magnitudes and in various phases of the gait cycle. Balance was maintained by (1) a stepping strategy (synergy), in which the foot at the next step is positioned a fixed distance outward of the 'extrapolated centre of mass', and (2) a lateral ankle strategy, which comprises a medial or lateral movement of the centre of pressure under the foot sole. The extrapolated centre of mass is defined as the centre of mass position plus the centre of mass velocity multiplied by a parameter related to the subject's leg length. The ankle strategy is the fastest, with a mechanical delay of about 200 ms (20 % of a stride), but it can displace the centre of pressure no more than 2 cm. The stepping strategy needs at least 300 ms (30 % of a stride) before foot placement, but has a range of 20 cm. When reaction time is sufficient, the magnitude of the total response is in good agreement with our hypothesis: mean centre of <b>pressure</b> (<b>foot)</b> position is a constant distance outward of the extrapolated centre of mass.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to develop a computational framework for investigating the dynamic behavior and the internal loading conditions of the human foot complex during locomotion. A subject-specific dynamic finite element model in the sagittal plane was constructed based on anatomical structures segmented from medical CT scan images. Three-dimensional gait measurements were conducted to support and validate the model. Ankle joint forces and moment derived from gait measurements were used to drive the model. Explicit finite element simulations were conducted, covering the entire stance phase from heel-strike impact to toe-off. The predicted ground reaction forces, center of <b>pressure,</b> <b>foot</b> bone motions and plantar surface pressure showed reasonably good agreement with the gait measurement data over most of the stance phase. The prediction discrepancies can be explained by the assumptions and limitations of the model. Our analysis showed that a dynamic FE simulation can improve the prediction accuracy in the peak plantar pressures at some parts of the foot complex by 10 %– 33 % compared to a quasi-static FE simulation. However, to simplify the costly explicit FE simulation, the proposed model is confined only to the sagittal plane and has a simplified representation of foot structure.

This thesis considers a number of dynamic visual tracking and control problems, {{as well as the}} integration of these techniques with contact force control. Different topics ranging from basic theory to system implementation and applications are treated. A new interface developed for external sensor control is presented, designed by making non-intrusive extensions to a standard industrial robot control system. The structure of these extensions are presented, the system properties are modeled and experimentally verified, and results from force-controlled stub grinding and deburring experiments are presented. A novel system for force-controlled drilling using a standard industrial robot is also demonstrated. The solution is based on the use of force feedback to control the contact forces and the sliding motions of the <b>pressure</b> <b>foot,</b> which would otherwise occur during the drilling phase. Basic methods for feature-based tracking and servoing are presented, together with an extension for constrained motion estimation based on a dual quaternion pose parametrization. A method for multi-camera real-time rigid body tracking with time constraints is also presented, based on an optimal selection of the measured features. The developed tracking methods are used as the basis for two different approaches to vision/force control, which are illustrated in experiments. Intensity-based techniques for tracking and vision-based control are also developed. A dynamic visual tracking technique based directly on the image intensity measurements is presented, together with new stability-based methods suitable for dynamic tracking and feedback problems.

Design: Three-way double-blind, Latin-square crossover studies in two groups of 12 patients with essential hypertension. The three treatment periods were amlodipine, doxazosin (study A) or enalapril (study B), and the combination of amlodipine with the second drug. Methods: Each treatment was taken for 1 month, preceded by a 2 -week single-blind run-in period, in which the patients received a low dose of doxazosin (study A) or enalapril (study B) to enable recruitment of patients with moderate or severe hypertension. Blood <b>pressure,</b> <b>foot</b> volume and plasma noradrenaline concentration were measured {{at the end of each}} run-in and treatment period. Results: The combination of [alpha]-blockade and calcium antagonism caused a fall in supine and erect blood pressures. These falls were significantly greater than on either drug alone, and greater than the sum of the falls when taking the individual drugs. The combination of amlodipine and the ACE inhibitor was also additive. Both combinations with amlodipine were tolerated well by all patients. Conclusions: The combination of [alpha]-blockade and calcium antagonism has not previously been studied and should be useful for resistant hypertensives who have not tolerated P-blockade or ACE inhibitors. The combination of ACE inhibition and calcium antagonism has previously been shown to be additive; its use as a positive control in the present studies suggests that the use of an active drug for a run-in period may be a useful design for permitting the study of patients from whom all treatment cannot safely be withdrawn...|$|E

Method: A system was developed that integrated a laser Doppler fluxmeter with a pressure probe, allowing plantar <b>foot</b> <b>pressure</b> and skin blood flow to be recorded simultaneously. The system was tested using four volunteers (28 ± 8. 6 years). Results: A significant difference existed between baseline laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) in the supine and semi-weight bearing positions (P= 0. 023).

Thus, the application of <b>foot</b> <b>pressure</b> measurements in individuals with diabetes includes monitoring patients for risk of ulceration, determining pressure off-loading capacities, and investigating the mechanical factors responsible for foot ulceration and ulcer healing...|$|R
40|$|The foot arch serves {{important}} {{functions in}} regard to shock absorption and the action of walking. Simple and quantitative classification of foot arch types such as flat foot and high arch would be helpful in health support for the elderly. The present authors have developed a classifi-cation system for foot arch type showing high reliability using <b>foot</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution data [1, 2]. However, effect of foot load changes on foot arch evaluation remains unclear. The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the effect of foot load changes on foot arch evaluation using <b>foot</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution data. Method We conducted a field test involving elderly individuals. <b>Foot</b> <b>pressure</b> distribution data were obtained by the field test with elderly subjects standing on 1 leg and 2 legs...|$|R
