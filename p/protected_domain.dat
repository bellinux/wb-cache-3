We introduce an approach for protecting machines and the resources they hold from mobile code, and describe a system based on our approach for protecting host machines from Java 1. 1 applets. In our approach, each Java applet downloaded to the <b>protected</b> <b>domain</b> is rerouted to a dedicated machine (or set of machines), the playground, at which it is executed. Prior to execution the applet is transformed to use the downloading user's web browser as a graphics terminal for its input and output, and so the user has the illusion that the applet is running on her own machine. In reality, however, mobile code runs only in the sanitized environment of the playground, where user files cannot be mounted and from which only limited network connections are accepted by machines in the <b>protected</b> <b>domain.</b> Our playground thus provides a second level of defense against mobile code that circumvents language-based defenses.

In vitro footprinting studies using a bovine mitochondrial extract and a series of deleted mtDNA templates identified a approximately 48 -kDa protein which binds specifically to a single TAS element also protected within the mitochondrion. Because other TAS-like elements located in close proximity to the protected region did not footprint, protein binding appears to be highly sequence specific.

CTCF comprises 727 amino acids and contains 11 zinc finger motifs arranged in tandem that are flanked by 267 amino acids on the N-terminal side and 150 amino acids on the C-terminal side. Deletion of either the N- or the C-terminal regions outside of the zinc finger domain had no detrimental effect on the binding of CTCF to APBβ.

UDDI is an online registry standard to facilitate the discovery of business partners and services. However, most medical imaging applications exist within their own <b>protected</b> <b>domain</b> and were never designed to participate and operate with other applications across the web. However, private UDDI registries in federated organizations {{should be able to}} share the service descriptions as well as to access them if they are authorized. The new initiatives on Federated Web Services Identity Management can resolve a range of both technical and political barriers to enable wide-scale participation and interoperation of separate domains into a singular, robust user experience. However, there is no widely acceptable standard for federated web services and most of the available venders frameworks concentrate only on the security issue of the federation leaving the issue of searching and discovering web services largely primitive. Federated web services security and web services searching are uniquely intertwined, mutually reliant on each other and are poised to finally solve a long-running problem in both IT and systems security. Traditional keyword search is insufficient for web services search as the very small text fragments in web services are unsuitable for keyword search and the underlying structure and semantics of the web service are not exploited. Engineering solutions that address the security and accessibility concerns of web services, however, is a challenging task. This article introduces an extension to the traditional UDDI that enables sophisticated types of searching based on a lightweight web services federated security infrastructure...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{consider}} {{a problem of}} eliminating the unwanted time-harmonic noise on a predetermined region of interest. The desired objective is achieved by active means, i. e., by introducing additional sources of sound called control sources, which generate the appropriate annihilating acoustic signal (antisound). A general solution for the control sources has been obtained previously in both continuous and discrete formulation of the problem. In the current paper, we focus on optimizing the overall absolute acoustic source strength of the control sources. Mathematically, this amounts to the minimization of multivariable complex-valued functions {{in the sense of}} L 1 with conical constraints, which are only “marginally ” convex. The corresponding numerical optimization problem appears very challenging even for the most sophisticated state-of-the-art methodologies, and even when the dimension of the grid is small and the waves are long. Our central result is that the global L 1 -optimal solution can, in fact, be obtained without solving the numerical optimization problem. This solution is given by a special layer of monopole sources on the perimeter of the protected region. We provide a rigorous proof of global L 1 minimality for both continuous and discrete optimization problems in the one-dimensional case. We also provide numerical evidence that corroborates our result in the two-dimensional case, when the <b>protected</b> <b>domain</b> is a cylinder. Even though we cannot fully justify it, we believe that the same result holds in the general case, i. e., for multidimensional settings and domains of arbitrary shape.

40|$|The {{design of}} this library {{is based upon}} two {{architectural}} concepts: the concept of defensive architecture, which is the architectural response to perceived threat, {{and the concept of}} the building as metaphysical model of the universe, having domains of sacred and profane space. I have long been intrigued by defensive architecture, by the forms it generates in response to perceived threat. The towers, mask-like facades, and labyrinthine passageways remain intriguing long after the war is over. Castles and fortifications are the architectural manifestation of an abrupt discontinuity in the organization of space. A stark polarity is created, a partition between inside and out, ours and theirs, us and them. The stark form of a defensive structure derives enormous formal power from this conflict of opposites. Tamer, gentler forms of this concept may be found in the form of monasteries, and madrasas. These share the qualities of retreat and seclusion, but for a different purpose - to be able to concentrate better on learning, and/or prayer. Their seclusion from the outside world is not a hostile act but rather a desire to intensify their inner world of prayer and study. These building types share qualities of having walls which segregate opposing conditions, as in defensive architecture, but differ in that the thing being excluded from the <b>protected</b> <b>domain</b> are of a spiritual nature, rather than physical threats.

40|$|International audienceWe {{propose a}} method to {{evaluate}} the detection abilities of networks used for protection purposes. Such networks are designed {{for the detection of}} nuclear, biological or gaseous emissions, without constraint on the source location. Their assigned goal is to have the best chance to detect a threatening emission located anywhere in the vicinity of a domain to protect. Two sensors siting applications are addressed: sensors placed in the surroundings of a facility to protect, or sensors carried by people scattered within a small area. A network protection ability is related both to its detection scope, and to its response time. To assess the performance of such networks, two statistical indicators are therefore designed: the detection probability, computed on a large number of possible source locations, and the saturation time, which is the time when the maximum detection probability has been reached. Simulations are then carried out with the Polyphemus air quality modeling system for many emission scenarios, including 961 possible source locations, various emitted species, and a few representative meteorological situations. This allows to assess the performance of single sensors as well as full networks, and their sensitivity to parameters like meteorological conditions and source characteristics. The emitted quantity and meteorological dispersion are found to be important parameters, whereas the species type does not significantly influence the results. Two network design methods are considered: (1) networks composed of a given number of the “best” sensors according to an indicator, and (2) sensors placed in circles around the <b>protected</b> <b>domain.</b> The networks built with respect to the detection probability show good results with a limited number of sensors, while the saturation time is not reliable enough to build networks.

40|$|Abstract. We {{present a}} {{thorough}} analysis of soliton {{solutions to the}} quasi-one-dimensional zigzag and armchair nonlinear Dirac equation (NLDE) for a Bose-Einstein condensate in a honeycomb lattice. The two types of NLDEs correspond to quasi-one-dimensional reductions in two independent directions, in direct analogy to the narrowest of graphene nanoribbons. Analytical as well as numerical soliton Dirac spinor solutions are obtained. We analyze the solution space of the quasi-one-dimensional NLDE by finding fixed points, delineating the various regions in solution space, and through an invariance relation which we obtain as a first integral of the NLDE. For both the zigzag and armchair geometries we obtain spatially oscillating multi-soliton as well as asymptotically flat single soliton solutions using five different methods: by direct integration; an invariance relation; parametric transformation; a series expansion; and by numerical shooting. By tuning {{the ratio of the}} chemical potential to the nonlinearity for a fixed value of the Dirac spinor kinetic energy, we can obtain both bright and dark solitons over a nonzero background. The density contrast between the dark (bright) soliton notch (peak) and the background is about 2 / 3 (3 / 1). For both soliton types, we compute the discrete spectra for several spatially quantized states in a harmonic potential. We interpret our solitons as topologically <b>protected</b> <b>domain</b> walls in a quasi-one-dimensional system which separate distinct regions of pseudospin- 1 / 2 with Sz = ± 1 / 2. By solving the relativistic linear stability equations we obtain the low-energy spectrum for excitations in the bulk region far from the soliton core and for bound states in the core and find that excitations occur as spin waves and as a Nambu-Goldstone mode. For a Bose-Einstein condensate of 87 Rb atoms, we find that our soliton solutions are stable on time scales relevant to experiments. a...|$|E
