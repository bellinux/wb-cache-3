Other firms began selling acetaminophen drugs, most significantly, McNeil Laboratories with liquid Tylenol in 1955, and Tylenol pills in 1958. By 1967, Tylenol was available without a prescription. Because {{it did not}} cause gastric irritation, acetaminophen rapidly displaced much of aspirin's sales. Another analgesic, anti-inflammatory drug was introduced in 1962: ibuprofen (sold as Brufen in the U.K. and Motrin in the U.S.). By the 1970s, aspirin had a relatively {{small portion of the}} <b>pain</b> <b>reliever</b> market, and in the 1980s sales decreased even more when ibuprofen became available without prescription.|$|E

25|$|Because of valerian's {{historical}} {{use as a}} sedative, antiseptic, anticonvulsant, migraine treatment, and <b>pain</b> <b>reliever,</b> {{most basic}} science research has been directed at the interaction of valerian constituents with the GABA receptor. Many studies remain inconclusive and all require clinical validation. The mechanism of action of valerian in general, and as a mild sedative in particular, has not been fully elucidated. However, some of the GABA-analogs, particularly valerenic acids as components of the essential oil along with other semivolatile sesquiterpenoids, generally {{are believed to have}} some affinity for the GABAA receptor, a class of receptors on which benzodiazepines are known to act. Valeric acid, which is responsible for the typical odor of mostly older valerian roots, does not have any sedative properties. Valeric acid is related to valproic acid, a widely prescribed anticonvulsant; valproic acid is a derivative of valeric acid.|$|E

National data from the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration (SAMHSA) indicate that prescrip-tion drugs (opioid <b>pain</b> <b>relievers,</b> stimulants, and sedatives) are the second most-abused category of drugs after marijuana. 1 In a nation-al study of high-school seniors, nearly one in four reported having abused prescription drugs 2 and the number of babies born addicted to opioid painkillers has tripled in the past decade. 3 Increases in the abuse of prescription drug—opioid <b>pain</b> <b>relievers</b> in particular — have led to substantial increases in morbidity and mortality. For example, from 1997 to 2007, opioid painkiller-related overdose deaths in the United States rose from 2, 901 to 11, 499 (nearly a 300 % increase) and accounted for more deaths than heroin and cocaine com-bined. 4 This report focuses on the most widely abused class of prescription drugs, opioid <b>pain</b> <b>relievers...</b>|$|R
