5|$|By mid-1841, {{the federal}} {{government}} faced a projected budget deficit of $11 million. Tyler recognized the need for higher tariffs, but wished {{to stay within the}} 20 <b>percent</b> <b>rate</b> created by the 1833 Compromise Tariff. He also supported a plan to distribute to the states any revenue from the sales of public land, as an emergency measure to manage the states' growing debt, even though this would cut federal revenue. The Whigs supported high protectionist tariffs and national funding of state infrastructure, and so there was enough overlap to forge a compromise. The Distribution Act of 1841 created a distribution program, with a ceiling on tariffs at 20 percent; a second bill increased tariffs to that figure on previously low-tax goods. Despite these measures, by March 1842 it had become clear that {{the federal government}} was still in dire fiscal straits.|$|E
5|$|Herd numbers {{grew from}} 28 to over 165 between 1968 and 1997 and {{overgrazing}} negatively impacted their living environment. To manage population numbers, long-term, non-hormonal contraceptives have been employed, proving 95 percent effective over a seven-year field trial. The contraceptive, which {{began to be}} used at a management level in 1995 although it was used in smaller amounts as early as 1989, has also proven effective at improving the health and increasing the life expectancy of older mares through the removal of pregnancy and lactation-related stress. Since 1990, general herd health has improved, early mortality has decreased and older ponies are now found, with many {{over the age of}} 20 and some even over 25. No horse has ever been injured during the dart-administered treatments, although there is a 0.2 <b>percent</b> <b>rate</b> of abscess at the injection site, which normally heals within two weeks. Each mare between two and four years old is given contraceptives, and treatment is then withdrawn until she produces a foal. Once she has produced enough foals to be well represented genetically within the herd, she is placed on a yearly treatment plan until her death. After the introduction of the contraceptive, herd numbers continued to rise to a high of 175 in 2001 to 2005, but then dropped significantly to around 130 in 2009. In 2009, a study determined that mitochondrial DNA diversity in the herd was quite low, most likely due to their isolation, but that their nuclear genetic diversity remained at a level similar to that of breeds from the mainland.|$|E

25|$|In April 1984 {{both the}} House of Representatives and the Senate passed {{legislation}} {{calling for a}} continuation of the current excise tax on telephone service at a 3 <b>percent</b> <b>rate</b> for an additional two years.

25|$|By 1966, {{however, the}} federal government’s revenue {{requirements}} had increased due to {{escalation of the}} Vietnam War.

Accordingly, Congress enacted the Tax Adjustment Act of 1966. That Act authorized the restoration of the former 10 <b>percent</b> <b>rate</b> on these services beginning on April 1, 1966, for a two-year period (until April 1, 1968), at which time it was to be reduced to 1 percent, before repeal on January 1, 1969.|$|E

25|$|Again in 1967, President Johnson urged {{postponement}} of scheduled {{reductions in}} telephone excise taxes {{as part of}} his tax program designed to meet the rising cost of the war and increasing domestic needs. A joint Congressional resolution was approved which temporarily extended the 10 <b>percent</b> <b>rate</b> from March 31, 1968 until April 30, 1968. This temporary extension provided Congress time to complete action on the Revenue and Expenditure Control Act of 1968.

25|$|Water {{privatisation}} in Jakarta {{began when}} the British water company Thames Water entered into {{an agreement with the}} son of then-President Suharto in 1993 to obtain a water concession. Under the influence of the French water company Suez, however, the government decided to split the city's service area between the two companies. The government awarded Thames Water and Suez each a concession for one half of the city without competitive bidding. The contracts foresaw water charge increases that would allow the companies to earn a comfortable 22 <b>percent</b> <b>rate</b> of return. However, only two months after the contracts were signed, the Indonesian rupiah massively lost in value due to the East Asian financial crisis, and President Suharto was toppled. The concessions survived, but the government imposed a tariff freeze and the contracts had to be renegotiated to reduce their targets. In 2006 Suez sold half and Thames Water all its shares to Indonesian investors.|$|E

The five law students (George Biondi, John Larouche, Neil Thomas Proto, Kenneth Perlman, and Peter Resselar) who formed Students Challenging Regulatory Agency Procedures (SCRAP) began their journey in December 1971 with the filing of a petition in the ICC that sought a one billion dollar refund for the failure of the Commission to comply with NEPA in approving a 20 <b>percent</b> <b>rate</b> increase (after NEPA's effective date) that SCRAP (and others) claimed discriminated against the movement of recyclable materials by favoring the movement of raw materials. In April and May 1972, SCRAP sued the United States and the ICC in the United States District Court for the District of Columbia for violating NEPA in approving the 20% increase (already being collected) and a new 2.5% rate increase on all freight transported by all of the nation's railroads. SCRAP then sought a preliminary injunction and a temporary injunction prior to the effective date of the 2.5% rate increase.|$|E
25|$|MSU {{received}} a $3.4 million grant in September 2012 {{to improve the}} hiring, promotion, tenure, and leadership advancement of female professors. The university lost a 1974 gender discrimination lawsuit brought by female faculty members. When Cruzado began her tenure at MSU, the problems women faculty faced were still significant. Women faculty at MSU earned an average of $10,574 less (15 percent) than men, while nationally, the gap was between 7 and 12 percent. Male faculty outnumber female faculty by 2-to-1, MSU was {{below the national average}} of having women constitute 39 percent of faculty, and only 21 women were full professors (141 men held that rank). Women faculty also left the university at a rate of 14 percent per year, compared to a 6 <b>percent</b> <b>rate</b> for men. The new grant, which the university applied for at Cruzado's explicit instruction, was provided by the National Institutes of Health to assist MSU in boosting the low rate at which it hires women professors. In some MSU departments, women constituted less than 20 percent of all faculty, few women were associate or full professors, and almost none held leadership roles.|$|E
