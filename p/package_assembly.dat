40|$|Abstract. Thermo-mechanical {{stresses}} {{have been}} {{considered one of the}} major concerns in electronic <b>Packaging</b> <b>assembly</b> structural failure. The interfacial stresses are often caused by the thermal mismatch stresses induced by the coefficient of thermal expansion (CTE) difference between materials, typically during the high temperature change in the bonding process. This research work examined the effect of bond layer on thermal mismatch interfacial stresses in a bi-layered assembly. The paper verified the existing thermal mismatch solder bonded bi-layered analytical model using finite element method (FEM) simulation. The parametric studies were carried out on the effect of change of bond layer properties in order to provide useful references for interfacial stress evaluation and the electronic <b>packaging</b> <b>assembly</b> design. These parameters included CTE, temperature, thickness, and stiffness (compliant and stiff bond) of the bond layer. The recent development on lead free bonding material was being reviewed and found to have enormous potential and key role to address the future electronic <b>packaging</b> <b>assembly</b> reliability...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a thermal analysis and experimental validation of natural convective heat transfer of a high-brightness light-emitting diode (LED) <b>package</b> <b>assembly.</b> The substrate {{materials used in}} the LED <b>package</b> <b>assembly</b> were filled and doped using boron nitride (BN) filler. The thermal conductivity of the BN-filled substrate was measured. The temperature distribution and heat flow of the LED package were assessed by thermal profile measurement using an infrared (IR) camera and thermocouples. In addition, the heat transfer process of the LED <b>package</b> <b>assembly</b> in natural convection was also simulated using the computational fluid dynamics method. The optical performance of the LED package was monitored and investigated with various filler contents. The heat conduction mechanismin the substrate was analyzed. IR thermogram showed that the BN-doped substrate could effectively lower the surface temperature of the LED package by 21. 5 °C compared with the traditional FR 4 substrate. According to the IESNA LM 80 lifetime testing method, reduction in LED temperature can prolong the LED's lifetime by 19, 000 h.

40|$|An {{experimental}} apparatus using moiré interferometry {{is developed}} {{to characterize the}} thermo-mechanical behavior of solder joints. A compact moiré interferometer is combined with an environmental chamber to allow real-time observation of non-linear and time-dependent solder and solder assemblies. The first apparatus is based on convection heating and cooling to simulate an accelerated thermal cycling (ATC) condition. Vibrations caused by an environmental chamber are circumvented by unique rigid links that connect the specimen to the moiré interferometer. Displacement fields are documented while the chamber is being operated. The system is utilized to analyze thermo-mechanical behavior of a ceramic ball grid array <b>package</b> <b>assembly</b> and a plastic ball grid array <b>package</b> <b>assembly.</b> The effect of thermal cycling on the accumulated permanent deformation is documented, which reveals the temperature-dependent non-linearity of solder joints. The second apparatus is based on conduction heating and cooling to achieve a high ramp rate. A special chamber is designed and fabricated using a high power thermoelectric cooler to achieve the desired ramp rate. The system is utilized to investigate the time-dependent behavior of solder joints. A new solder joint configuration is designed and fabricated to be tested with the conduction based apparatus. The specimen {{is an extension of}} the conventional bi-material joint configuration but the unique design offers two important features; it negates the inherent shortcoming from cross sectioning required in moiré interferometry and produces a virtually uniform shear strain field at the solder joint. The deformation of solder joint is documented at a controlled ramp rate over several thermal cycles. The experimental results are analyzed and compared with those of Finite Element analysis to investigate the validity of solder constitutive models available in the literatures...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. A unique {{interferometric}} system utilizing thermal-conduction loading is developed and implemented {{to investigate the}} effect of ramp rates of accelerated test profiles on the thermal deformation of flex package assemblies. The system provides extreme ramp rates to simulate the thermal shock condition with a temperature control much finer than the conventional convection based system can provide. The in-plane and out-of-plane displacements of the flex package are documented through moiré interferometry and Twyman/Green interferometry, respectively. Deformation measured under a thermal shock condition is compared with that under the conventional thermal cycling condition to assess the effect of ramp rates on package deformation. The comparison reveals that a low ramp rate of typical accelerated thermal cycling (ATC) tests causes significant reduction in the maximum level of elastic energy in the <b>package</b> <b>assembly...</b>|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} forces and motions generated during interaction of pulsed laser energy with materials. The effects of this interaction on the subsequent dynamics of the material receiving this energy have important implications {{in the manufacture of}} laser diode packages. Small motions which occur during laser welding of the <b>package</b> <b>assembly</b> can cause serious losses in the amount of coupled power, thus degrading the performance of the package. This work is aimed at understanding how these movements occur. Various quantities such as force, acceleration and coupled power variations were measured during a laser welding operation. These measurements establish that significant thermal stress waves are generated during the welding process. However, the final relative motion between cylindrical specimens which are butt-welded by a laser beam occurs due to rapid cooling and shrinkage of the weld pool at the interface of the two specimens. Pulsed laser welding has proven to be an effective material joining technique for precision applications which deman...|$|E
