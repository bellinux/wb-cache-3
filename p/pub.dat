5|$|Britain's Deviants, in {{the late}} 1960s, played {{in a range of}} {{psychedelic}} styles with a satiric, anarchic edge and a penchant for situationist-style spectacle presaging the Sex Pistols by almost a decade. In 1970, the act evolved into the Pink Fairies, which carried on in a similar vein. With his Ziggy Stardust persona, David Bowie made artifice and exaggeration central—elements, again, that were picked up by the Sex Pistols and certain other punk acts. The Doctors of Madness built on Bowie's presentation concepts, while moving musically in the direction that would become identified with punk. Bands in London's <b>pub</b> rock scene stripped the music back to its basics, playing hard, R rock 'n' roll. By 1974, the scene's top act, Dr. Feelgood, was paving the way for others such as the Stranglers and Cock Sparrer that would {{play a role in the}} punk explosion. The <b>pub</b> rock scene created small venues where non-mainstream bands could play and they released low-cost recordings on independent record labels. Among the <b>pub</b> rock bands that formed that year was the 101ers, whose lead singer would soon adopt the name Joe Strummer, a performer who has been called the link between <b>pub</b> rock and punk rock. Despite the presence of some shared approaches and values between the two genres, they had an important difference; while <b>pub</b> rock aimed to continue the tradition of earlier rock'n'roll bands, punk rock aimed to break with tradition.|$|E

5|$|British R {{continued}} to be played in the Northern Soul club scene, where early soul records, particularly those of Motown, were highly prized.

They topped the British charts with live album Stupidity (1976), but failed to make a significant impact in the US.
