5|$|Overall, the Myst {{series has}} been commercially and {{critically}} successful. Rand and Robyn Miller were expecting Myst to <b>perform</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as previous Cyan titles, making {{enough money to}} fund the next project. Instead, Myst sold more than six million units, becoming the top-selling PC game of all time until The Sims surpassed its sales in 2002. The first three games in the series have sold more than twelve million copies.|$|E
5|$|Despite the lukewarm {{reception}} {{from music}} critics, {{it was a}} commercial success. Released as the album's lead single in October 1997, it topped the UK Singles Chart on 19 October 1997 for one week, becoming the group's fifth consecutive chart-topper. This made the Spice Girls the first act to have its first five singles reach {{number one in the}} United Kingdom. It performed almost as well internationally, peaking inside the top five on the majority of the charts that it entered. In the United States, the song did not <b>perform</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as their previous releases, peaking at number eighteen on the Billboard Hot 100.|$|E

5|$|The Liverpool {{team were}} welcomed {{back to the}} city by {{approximately}} half a million people, as the open-top bus drove through the city to the town hall. Three days after the final, Liverpool faced Italian team Internazionale in the first leg of the semi-finals of the 1964–65 European Cup. Before the match kicked off, Bryne and Gordon Milne paraded the FA Cup around the stadium. Liverpool won the match 3–1, but they did not <b>perform</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> in the second leg at the San Siro, as they lost 3–0 to exit the competition 4–3 on aggregate.|$|E
5|$|The third {{series was}} seen {{by an average of}} 5.77million viewers, a decline in ratings from the second series with viewership {{dropping}} below five million at one point. However the BBC had renewed Spooks for a fourth series before the third had begun broadcasting. Critical reaction was generally positive, though reviewers believed it did not <b>perform</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as its preceding seasons. It was nominated for seven British Academy Television Awards (BAFTA), winning one. The third series was released on DVD on 23 May 2005 in Region 4, 5 September 2005 in Region 2, and 31 January 2006 in Region 1.|$|E

Disney announced {{the closing of the}} Florida studio on January 12, 2004, with the then in-progress feature My Peoples left unfinished when the studio closed two months later. Upon the unsuccessful April 2004 release of Home on the Range, Disney, led by executive Bob Lambert, officially announced its conversion of Walt Disney Feature Animation into a fully CGI studio– a process begun two years prior– now with a staff of 600 people and began selling off all of its traditional animation equipment.|$|E
5|$|The CAB Rating for {{the show}} was 22.1% and placed 12th among the highest rated evening {{programs}} of the 1932–33 season. The CAB Rating was not disappointing – popular established shows such as The Shadow and The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes did not <b>perform</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> – but {{it was less than}} half of Texaco's Fire Chief, which got a 44.8% CAB Rating and was the third highest-rated program of the season. One reason for the lower ratings may be because of the time slot the show aired. In September 1932, only 40% of radio owners were listening to the radio at 7:00p.m., whereas 60% listened at 9:00p.m. The 1932–1933 season's top-rated shows, The Chase and Sanborn Hour, Jack Pearl's Baron Münchhausen, and Fire Chief all aired after 9:00p.m. Standard Oil decided it could not compete with Texaco in the ratings and Five-Star Theater was not renewed for a second season.|$|E
5|$|The mounted {{police were}} {{established}} to be an armed force, primarily due to the perceived threat from the First Nations on the prairies. The police were initially equipped with the Snider-Enfield Carbine Mark III and the Snider-Enfield Short Rifle, but these were single-shot breechloaders, and inferior to the repeating weapons already being used by Indian groups in the United States. These were replaced with the Winchester Model 1876 repeating rifle from 1878 onwards, but the new guns proved quite delicate and did not perform effectively during the 1885 rebellion. In 1895, the force began to replace the ageing Winchesters with the Lee-Metford Magazine Carbine, but these weapons did not <b>perform</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as hoped. The program was halted and instead the Lee-Enfield Magazine Rifle Mark I was introduced in 1902 as the standard police small arm. The very limited supplies of ammunition held by the force meant {{that the police had}} few opportunities to practice with their weapons, and as a result their marksmanship was typically quite poor.|$|E

5|$|Folie à Deux {{has sold}} 449,000 copies in the US to date February 2013, {{but did not}} <b>perform</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> commercially as its predecessor, Infinity on High. It debuted at number eight on the US Billboard 200 chart with first week sales of 149,000 copies during a highly {{competitive}} week with other big debuts, becoming Fall Out Boy's third consecutive top ten album. This {{is in contrast to}} the band's more successful previous effort which shifted 260,000 copies in its opening week to debut at number one the chart. Folie spent two weeks within the top 20 out of its 22 chart weeks. It also entered Billboard's Rock Albums and Alternative Albums charts at number three. With 39,000 digital downloads as part of its sales totals in its debut week, the record opened at number one on Billboard Digital Albums chart, the band's second number one album on that chart. Fall Out Boy was bested in the group's chart debut by R singers Keyshia Cole—whose A Different Me landed at number two on sales of more than 321,000—and Jamie Foxx, whose Intuition logged 265,000 for a number three debut. Taylor Swift's Fearless reigned at number one during that week. Within two months of its release, Folie à Deux was certified Gold in the United States by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA), denoting shipments of 500,000 copies.|$|E
5|$|Led Zeppelin's {{untitled}} fourth album, {{often called}} Led Zeppelin IV and released on 8 November 1971, is their most commercially successful album. It received a 23 times multi-platinum certification from RIAA, the third-highest of all albums. The band's fifth album, Houses of the Holy, {{was released in}} 1973. Again a transatlantic chart-topper, it has received an 11 times multi-platinum certification from RIAA. In 1974, the band {{set up their own}} vanity label, Swan Song Records, which would release the rest of Led Zeppelin's studio albums. The first was the 1975 double album Physical Graffiti, which has received a 16 times platinum certification from RIAA. However, Zeppelin's seventh album, Presence (1976), did not <b>perform</b> <b>as</b> <b>well</b> as their previous releases, receiving a triple Platinum certification from RIAA. On 20 October 1976 Led Zeppelin released their first concert film The Song Remains the Same. The recording of the film took place during three nights of concerts at Madison Square Garden in New York City, during the band's 1973 concert tour of the United States. The band's eighth album, In Through the Out Door, received a sextuple platinum certification. This was the last album released by the band before Bonham died of alcohol intoxication in 1980; Led Zeppelin disbanded immediately afterwards.|$|E
