Ospreay managed to recover and eventually eliminated Marty Scurll last to win Thunderbastard. The following show saw Ospreay team up with FSU and Noam Dar in an eight-man tag team match with FSU and Havoc's respective titles, Ospreay's title contendership and everyone else's <b>Progress</b> <b>contracts</b> at stake, depending which individual lost. During the match, Ospreay moonsaulted from the Electric Ballroom's balcony onto his opponents, on the floor and later had Havoc in position to be pinned but as he jumped from the top rope, Robinson dragged Havoc outside, leading Ospreay to pin Davis and end the London Riots' <b>contract</b> with <b>Progress.</b>|$|R

He lost the {{championship}} on 24 January 2016 to Marty Scurll when the referee stopped the match as Ospreay had passed out while being handcuffed in Scurll's chickenwing submission. Ospreay lost a rematch with Scurll at WrestleCon Supershow in Texas, USA in April and also lost a contendership match against Haskins on 31 July. He {{spent the rest of}} the year in showcase matches against non-regular Progress wrestlers, losing to Zack Sabre Jr, Shane Strickland, Matt Riddle and Adam Cole. Finally on 30 December, at a card composed exclusively of unannounced matches, Ospreay lost to a now babyface Havoc. After the match Havoc invited Ospreay to join him in his fight against British Strong Style who held the World and Tag Team Championship. Ospreay instead attacked Havoc and then realigned with Swords of Essex partner Paul Robinson. Ospreay attacked Havoc again, during the latter's Progress World Championship match leading to a Fans Bring The Weapons match in March.

40|$|Like {{constructing}} a building, performance on many contracts occurs in phases. As time passes, the promisor sinks more costs into performance and less expenditure remains. For phased performance, {{we show that}} optimal liability for the breaching party decreases as the remaining costs of completing performance decrease. In brief, efficiency requires a decreasing liability contract. To implement such a contract, we recommend deducting past expenditure on incomplete performance from liability. We show that <b>progress</b> payment <b>contracts,</b> which are commonplace in some industries, are materially equivalent to decreasing liability contracts. Our analysis should prove useful for elucidating progress payment conracts and for drafting and litigating phased contracts...|$|R

Accumulating data obtained from vascular homeostasis in late stage DN demonstrated (1) a defective angiogenesis and impaired NO production which explains the therapeutic resistance to vasodilators and the inability to correct chronic renal ischemia and (2) an abnormally elevated antiangiogenesis and a progressive vascular disease which correlates with the altered renal hemodynamics characterized by a progressive reduction in renal perfusion as the disease severity <b>progressed.</b> In <b>contract,</b> the vascular homeostasis is adequately functional in early stage DN.
