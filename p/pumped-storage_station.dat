In 1964, ESB engineers visited several {{locations in the}} Wicklow Mountains, digging trial pits and boreholes, looking for suitable sites for a <b>pumped-storage</b> <b>station.</b> A shortlist of three proposals was drawn up by O'Riordan: an artificial upper reservoir at the summit of Tonduff mountain with an artificial lower reservoir in the Glencree valley; an upper reservoir using Lough Ouler, a natural corrie lake near the summit of Tonelagee mountain, with an artificial lower reservoir in the Glenmacnass valley; and an artificial upper reservoir at Turlough Hill with Lough Nahanagan as lower reservoir.|$|E

50|$|In the Malta group, {{water from}} the Rottau {{reservoir}} down in the Möll River Valley is pumped via the Main stage (Rottau) to the Galgenbichl reservoir below the Kölnbrein. Along the tunneled route, the Gösskar reservoir, and various tributaries provide additional water via pipeline as well. Water storage in the Galgenbichl reservoir is eventually pumped via the Upper storage <b>pumped-storage</b> <b>station</b> into the Kölnbrein reservoir. When generating electricity, {{water from the}} upper Kölnbrein reservoir is released about 200 m {{back down to the}} Upper stage power plant. The upper stage consists of two reversible Francis turbine generators with a total installed capacity of 120 MW. Water can then be released back through 20.4 km of pipeline south towards the Möll River Valley. Ultimately, it will drop from 1704 m above sea level to 598 m through two 1.9 km penstocks where the Main stage (Rottau) power plant is located.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pumped-storage</b> <b>station</b> has an {{unconventional}} configuration, with three reservoirs at different heights. The lower reservoir {{is created by}} Yahagi Dam on the Yahagi river. The upper reservoir is the Kuroda Dam lake, an artificial lake created by the Kuroda Dam. A third reservoir, in between the two at an intermediate elevation is formed by the Tominaga Dam. The two Okuyahagi power stations work in tandem between the three reservoirs. This configuration was necessary because of the geological conditions in the area, with a fault that prevented the safe construction of a single connection between upper and lower reservoirs.Okuyahagi 1 is the upper power plant, operating between the upper and the intermediate reservoir using 3 units with a combined capacity of 323 MW. The first unit started operation in September 1980, while {{the second and third}} units became operational in February 1981.The Okuyahagi 2 is the lower power plant operating between the intermediate reservoir and the lower reservoir employing 3 units with a combined capacity of 780 MW. Okuyahagi 2 became operatinal together with the first plant, with the first unit online in September 1980 and the other 2 in February 1981. The two plants operate as a single power station.
