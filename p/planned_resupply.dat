25|$|In summer 1942, {{supplies}} on the British occupied Mediterranean {{island of}} Malta were running desperately low.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe Defense Fuel Supply Center (DFSC) has, in recent past, {{been unable to}} adequately forecast for short-term petroleum requirements. This has resulted in inaccurate replenishment quantities and required short notice corrections which interrupted <b>planned</b> <b>resupply</b> methods. The relationship between the annual CINCLANTFLT DFM budget and sales from the the Norfolk Defense Fuel Support Point (DFSP) is developed and the past sales data from the Norfolk DFSP is used to construct seasonality indices. Finally, the budget/sales relationship is combined with the seasonality indices to provide a new forecasting model. This model is then compared with the current one for FY- 88 monthly forecasts. The comparison suggests that the new model can provide accurate, timely requirements data and improve resupply of the Norfolk Defense Fuel Support Point. [URL] Commander, United States Nav...|$|E

Bannon and Konrad separately sneak below decks to search the hold. When they meet, Konrad has a pistol, but he gives it to Bannon to prove where his loyalties lie. They accidentally discover a second, hidden hold containing rack upon rack of torpedoes — the ship is a tender, covertly resupplying the U-boat [...] "wolfpacks". They watch undetected as Holger enters the hold and uses a radio to signal the Germans.

25|$|The Confederates marched west, {{heading toward}} Danville, Virginia or Lynchburg, Virginia as an alternative. Lee <b>planned</b> to <b>resupply</b> his army {{at one of}} those cities and march {{southwest}} into North Carolina where he could unite his army with the Confederate army commanded by General Joseph E. Johnston. Grant's Union Army pursued Lee's fleeing Confederates relentlessly. During the next week, the Union troops fought a series of battles with Confederate units, cut off or destroyed Confederate supplies and blocked their paths to the south and ultimately to the west. On April 6, 1865, the Confederate Army suffered a significant defeat at the Battle of Sailor's Creek, Virginia, where they lost about 7,700 men killed and captured and an unknown number wounded. Nonetheless, Lee continued to move the remainder of his battered army to the west. Soon cornered, short of food and supplies and outnumbered, Lee surrendered the Army of Northern Virginia to Grant on April 9, 1865 at Appomattox Court House, Virginia.|$|R
5|$|The English {{campaign}} against Scotland was planned {{on a massive}} scale, with a force of around 23,350 men. Edward advanced through Lothian towards Edinburgh, but Robert the Bruce declined to meet him in battle, drawing Edward further into Scotland. <b>Plans</b> to <b>resupply</b> the campaign by sea failed, and the large army rapidly ran out of food. Edward was forced to retreat south of the border, pursued by Scottish raiding parties. Edward's illegitimate son, Adam, died during the campaign, and the raiding parties almost captured Isabella, who was staying at Tynemouth {{and was forced to}} flee by sea. The King planned a fresh campaign, backed by a round of further taxes, but confidence in Edward's Scottish policy was diminishing. Andrew Harclay, instrumental in securing Edward's victories the previous year and recently made the Earl of Carlisle, independently negotiated a peace treaty with Robert the Bruce, proposing that Edward would recognise Robert as the King of Scotland and that, in return, Robert would cease to interfere in England. Edward was furious and immediately executed Harclay, but agreed to a thirteen-year truce with Robert.|$|R
40|$|Four Antarctic explorers {{were invited}} to a {{workshop}} at Johnson Space Center (JSC) to provide expert assessments of NASA's current understanding of future human exploration missions beyond low Earth orbit.

5|$|Willaumez had <b>planned</b> to <b>resupply</b> his {{squadron}} at the Cape itself before {{searching for}} the China Fleet, but the crew of a merchant ship captured in the South Atlantic informed him that the Dutch governors had surrendered on 10 January 1806 to an expeditionary force under General Sir David Baird and Commodore Popham after five days of fighting. Turning away from the Cape, Willaumez decided to continue operations in the South Atlantic until April, when he put into Salvador in Brazil for supplies. Willaumez was fortunate to have collected this information before attempting to anchor in Table Bay: Popham had ordered all ships and shore facilities to continue to fly the Dutch flag {{in the hope that}} enemy ships would be lured within range of the port's gun batteries. On 4 March this ruse worked successfully when the frigate Volontaire, detached from Willaumez's squadron in December, anchored in the midst of Popham's squadron without realising their identity.

With much of the colony's stores waiting on the ships, Luna sent several exploring parties inland to scout the area; they returned after three weeks having found only one Indian town. Before they could unload the vessels, on the night of September 19, 1559, a hurricane (with storm surge) swept through and destroyed most of the ships and cargo: five ships, a galleon and a bark, pushing one caravel and its cargo into a grove inland. With the colony in serious danger, most of the men traveled inland to the Alabama River to the village of Nanipacana (also rendered as Nanipacna, Ypacana, and Nypacana), which they had found abandoned; they named the town Santa Cruz de Nanipacana and settled in until the rest of the colony arrived.

The major reason for the reduction in American <b>plans</b> was that <b>resupply</b> of the station was difficult and expensive. Permanent polar ice prevents supply by sea, and attempts to move heavy supplies by trans-icecap convoys from Camp TUTO were problematic. In practice, everything had to be flown in from Thule.

500|$|As {{a result}} of blunders in French decision-making, the French began an {{operation}} to insert, then support, the soldiers at Điện Biên Phủ, deep {{in the hills of}} northwestern Vietnam.

The <b>plan</b> was to <b>resupply</b> the French position by air, and was {{based on the belief that}} the Viet Minh had no anti-aircraft capability. [...] The Viet Minh, however, under General Võ Nguyên Giáp, surrounded and besieged the French. The Viet Minh brought in vast amounts of heavy artillery (including antiaircraft guns). They moved these weapons through difficult terrain up the rear slopes of the mountains surrounding the French positions, dug tunnels through the mountain, and placed the artillery pieces overlooking the French encampment. This positioning of the artillery made it nearly impervious to French counter-battery fire.|$|R
40|$|Appropriate {{inventory}} management {{is important for}} many businesses throughout the world. For the vaccines industry, appropriate inventory policies impact both the business' profitability and people's lives. An optimal policy must consider challenges such as product expiration, country specific SKUs, and a challenging regulatory environment. This thesis discusses an inventory forecasting tool developed for Novartis Vaccines {{that can be used}} to determine appropriate inventory policies and forecast resupply needs. Novartis Vaccines factories ship vaccines to Novartis operated warehouses throughout the world. The inventory at these warehouses is used to meet customer demand. Each country's warehouse is responsible for managing its local inventory and forecasting orders to the manufacturing team. Changes to the forecast can lead to costly manufacturing rework and local stock-outs. Inappropriate inventory policies can lead to high inventory holding costs and product expiration leading to scrap. The results of this project show that the best inventory and <b>resupply</b> <b>planning</b> methods differ for different types of vaccines in different markets. The tool developed looks at differences such as sales volume and seasonality, distribution methods and costs, product shelf life, and the transfer price to provide an optimal inventory and resupply forecast. The tool was tested in four countries with several SKUs in each country and identified approximately 50, 000 Euros in savings per country. If the tool was applied to all 25 countries and similar savings were seen in each country, the organization will save 1. 25 Million Euros. by Julia Stark. Thesis (M. B. A.)

5000|$|In late May 1940, Raeder {{ordered the}} [...] and [...] into action off Norway's North Cape. Weinberg {{wrote about the}} North Cape raid: [...] "There were, furthermore, {{increased}} by the extraordinary reaction of the German naval command to the signs of victory in the West {{as well as in}} Norway. The evidence suggests that Raeder completely lost his head over what he, like so many Germans, saw as the prospect of imminent victory in the whole war. Forgetting his and the navy's own prior emphasis on the French ports as the best base for Atlantic operations, and fearful that the war might end before he could demonstrate to Hitler's satisfaction the great value of a battleship navy, he ordered the two available battleships into operations off the Norwegian coasts in late May and June 1940. Both the Scharnhorst (only recently repaired from earlier damage in the Norwegian operation) and Gneisenau were torpedoed by British submarines in these prestige manoeuvres; they would not be ready for operations in the Atlantic again until the end of December. And in the process another German admiral was canned by Raeder, while his successor was covered with reproaches". [...] An even harsher assessment of Raeder's decision to send the Scharnhorst and Gneisenau off the North Cape came from Murray and Millet, who wrote: [...] "The Seekriegsleitung... had lost none of its ability to confuse strategy with bureaucratic interest. In late May, worried that German successes in France and Norway might bring the war to an end before his battle cruisers saw action, Raeder committed the battle cruisers Scharnhorst and Gneisenau to a raid off Norway's North Cape. The naval staff hoped to gain a success to influence postwar budget debates ... Since Raeder had already discussed with Hitler on 20 May the possibility of invading Britain, such a waste of German naval strength off the North Cape counts {{as one of the most}} egregious naval misjudgements of the war." [...] Before sending Admiral Wilhelm Marschall out in Operation Juno, Raeder told him: [...] "We must engage the enemy in battle, even if this should cost us one of the battleships. If they are not deployed, we will receive no more in the future". Marschall was enraged that Raeder sent him out on the North Cape raid without air cover or a screening force of U-boats, without informing him of what were the orders given to U-boats operating in the area, and with no <b>plans</b> for <b>resupply.</b> The period from April to June 1940 was one of the most stressful periods of the war for Raeder with operations involving the entire fleet in Norway, the French campaign and Raeder's obsessive fear that the Army and Air Force might win the war without the Navy, and which led to act in an manner that has been described as [...] "irrational". Admiral Conrad Patzig commented about Raeder in early 1940: [...] "Raeder is strongly influenced by his surroundings and exceptional circumstances and under stress is impulsive and unpredictable if his pride and vanity are involved". Raeder's great fear was that after France was defeated, then Britain might sue for peace, in which case the Army and the Luffwaffe would have won the war without the Navy. During the North Cape raid, the Scharnhorst and the Gneisenau sank the British carrier [...] and two destroyers, but the damage that put those ships out of action for six months when they were needed for a possible invasion of Britain easily outweighed the loss of the Glorious. After the North Cape raid, Raeder blamed Marschall for the damage that Scharnorst and Gneisenau had endured, claimed that Marschall had failed to understand his orders for Operation Juno properly, and sacked him. That Juno ended Marschall's career as Flottenchef suggests that Juno was seen as a failure in private, despite claims in public that it was victory.|$|R
