25|$|The game {{is divided}} {{into a series of}} hands (deals); at the {{conclusion}} of each hand, the <b>pot</b> <b>is</b> typically awarded to one player (an exception in which the <b>pot</b> <b>is</b> divided between two or more is discussed below). A hand may end at the showdown, in which case the remaining players compare their hands and the highest hand is awarded the pot; that highest hand is usually held by only one player, but can be held by more {{in the case of a}} tie. The other possibility for the conclusion of a hand occurs when all but one player have folded and have thereby abandoned any claim to the pot, in which case the <b>pot</b> <b>is</b> awarded to the player who has not folded.|$|E
25|$|This {{mixture is}} then added to an {{earthenware}} pot and layered with thin sheets of gold fold. The <b>pot</b> <b>is</b> then sealed and heated in a furnace.|$|E
25|$|The Manx £5 note is {{the only}} known {{banknote}} to picture a pub on it. In the bottom left-hand corner of the reverse, the Castle Arms (known as the Glue <b>Pot)</b> <b>is</b> shown opposite Castle Rushen, Castletown.|$|E
25|$|Guilty Gear Xrd -REVELATOR-'s bonus <b>pot</b> <b>was</b> $10,000 USD {{coming from}} North American {{publisher}} Aksys Games. The total <b>pot</b> <b>was</b> around $19,000 USD.|$|R
50|$|The Kyaukmyaung <b>pots</b> <b>are</b> {{sold for}} $18-$20 {{directly}} from the factory. The majority of the <b>pots</b> <b>are</b> floated downstream on giant boats. The <b>pots</b> in Yangon <b>are</b> often sold for anywhere between $40 and $50 US. The <b>pots</b> <b>are</b> sold to different retailers in Yangon and along the Irrawaddy river. They are very popular in Myanmar as they have many uses.|$|R
30|$|<b>Pots</b> <b>were</b> {{regularly}} watered every day, {{one at a}} time, {{with the}} same amount of liquid. Observations were made, and watering was stopped when decomposable <b>pots</b> <b>were</b> broken beyond repair.|$|R
25|$|To {{preserve}} the pretannin tea without requiring {{it all to}} be poured into cups, a second teapot may be used. The steeping <b>pot</b> <b>is</b> best unglazed earthenware; Yixing pots are {{the best known of}} these, famed for the high-quality clay from which they are made. The serving <b>pot</b> <b>is</b> generally porcelain, which retains the heat better. Larger teapots are a post-19th century invention, as tea before this time was very rare and very expensive. Experienced tea-drinkers often insist the tea should not be stirred around while it is steeping (sometimes called winding or mashing in the UK). This, they say, will do little to strengthen the tea, but is likely to bring the tannins out {{in the same way that}} brewing too long will do. For the same reason, one should not squeeze the last drops out of a teabag; if stronger tea is desired, more tea leaves should be used.|$|E
25|$|A Wonder <b>Pot</b> <b>is</b> an Israeli {{invention}} {{that acts}} as a Dutch oven but is made of aluminium. It consists of three parts: an aluminium pot shaped like a Bundt pan, a hooded cover perforated with venting holes, and a thick, round, metal disc with a centre hole that is placed between the Wonder Pot and the flame to disperse heat.|$|E
25|$|In {{keeping with}} the programme's {{friendly}} nature, contestants on each episode compete not for money but for a teapot that is styled to resemble the 30-second time clock used in each round. Introduced in December 1998, the <b>pot</b> <b>is</b> custom-made and can only be obtained by winning a game on the programme. Defeated contestants receive an assortment of Countdown-themed merchandise as a parting gift.|$|E
50|$|In the Skinner Asian Arts Auction, an 18th-century 6 in bamboo Chinese brush <b>pot</b> <b>was</b> {{sold for}} $539,500. The <b>pot</b> <b>was</b> inscribed with {{detailed}} figures of immortals and animals set in mountainous landscapes.|$|R
50|$|Upon {{examination}} of the sherds, the archaeologists concluded that the <b>pots</b> <b>were</b> not anthropomorphic <b>pots</b> or used for burial. They suggested that the Linao Cave was somehow a ritual site, and that the <b>pots</b> <b>were</b> probably used for rituals.|$|R
50|$|The {{alternative}} {{entrance of}} Small Mammal <b>Pot</b> <b>was</b> opened {{up from below}} by Mike Wooding and John Gardner in 2005. The alternative entrance of Stile <b>Pot</b> <b>was</b> opened up by John Gardner, John Sellers, Dave Checkley and Phil Johnstone in 2008.|$|R
25|$|Rivers {{passing through}} Boho include the Sillees River which runs from Lough Navar Forest Park to Lower Lough Erne and its tributaries, the Screenagh and Boho Rivers. There are also five major streams which drain into the Reyfad/Carrickbeg {{catchment}} area and {{are linked to}} the Carrickbeg resurgence. One of these streams, entering Polltullybrack (second entrance to Reyfad <b>Pot),</b> <b>is</b> known as the Reyfad stream.|$|E
25|$|The lobster-pot traps of Genlisea are {{difficult}} to interpret. They may have developed from bifurcated pitchers that later specialized on ground-dwelling prey; or, perhaps, the prey-guiding protrusions of bladder traps became more substantial than the net-like funnel found in most aquatic bladderworts. Whatever their origin, the helical shape of the lobster <b>pot</b> <b>is</b> an adaptation that displays as much trapping surface as possible in all directions when buried in moss.|$|E
25|$|The {{porous pot}} {{version of the}} Daniell cell was invented by John Dancer, a Liverpool {{instrument}} maker, in 1838. It consists of a central zinc anode dipped into a porous earthenware pot containing a zinc sulfate solution. The porous <b>pot</b> <b>is,</b> in turn, immersed in a solution of copper sulfate contained in a copper can, which acts as the cell's cathode. The use of a porous barrier allows ions to pass through but keeps the solutions from mixing.|$|E
5000|$|Carbon Deposition - This test, as said by Skibo, can {{determine}} the type of food cooked, how it was cooked and how the <b>pot</b> <b>was</b> placed on the flame. From this, another distinction between rice and vegetable/meat <b>pots</b> <b>was</b> established.|$|R
50|$|Smudge <b>pots</b> <b>were</b> {{used by the}} Germans during World War II and by the North Vietnamese {{in their}} invasions of Laos during the Vietnam War to protect {{valuable}} targets. The oily black clouds of smoke produced from these smudge <b>pots</b> <b>was</b> intended to limit the ability to locate a target. In Vietnam, smoke from smudge <b>pots</b> <b>was</b> used as a defense against laser-guided bombs. Smoke would diffuse the laser beam and break the laser's connection with its intended target.|$|R
5000|$|Prices {{can vary}} from a couple dozen to {{thousands}} of yuan. A <b>pot</b> <b>was</b> auctioned in 2010 for 12.32 million yuan. [...] Some Chinese National treasures have even been deemed priceless. Generally, the price of Yixing teapots are dependent on such factors such as age, clay, artist, style and production methods. The more expensive <b>pots</b> <b>are</b> shaped by hand using wooden and bamboo tools to manipulate the clay into form, while cheaper Yixing <b>pots</b> <b>are</b> produced by slipcasting.|$|R
25|$|Prior to contact, pottery {{was usually}} open-air fired or pit fired; precontact Indigenous peoples of Mexico used kilns extensively. Today many Native American ceramic artists use kilns. In pit-firing, the <b>pot</b> <b>is</b> {{placed in a}} shallow pit dug into the earth along with other unfired pottery, covered with wood and brush, or dung, then set on fire whereupon it can harden at {{temperatures}} of 1400 degrees or more. Finally, the ceramics surface is often polished with smooth stones.|$|E
25|$|Compared with {{a single}} paraboloid, using two partial troughs has {{important}} advantages. Each trough is a , which can be made simply by bending a flat sheet of metal. Also, the light that reaches the targeted cooking <b>pot</b> <b>is</b> directed approximately downward, which reduces the danger of damage to the eyes of anyone nearby. On the other hand, there are disadvantages. More mirror material is needed, increasing the cost, and the light is reflected by two surfaces instead of one, which inevitably increases the amount that is lost.|$|E
25|$|The gimbal {{was first}} {{described}} by the Greek inventor Philo of Byzantium (280–220 BCE). Philo described an eight-sided ink pot with an opening on each side, which can be turned so that while any face is on top, a pen can be dipped and inked — yet the ink never runs out through the holes of the other sides. This {{was done by the}} suspension of the inkwell at the center, which was mounted on a series of concentric metal rings so that it remained stationary no matter which way the <b>pot</b> <b>is</b> turned.|$|E
40|$|Photograph of {{a view of}} a {{stack of}} Pima Indian pottery, ca. 1884. Around twenty <b>pots</b> <b>are</b> stacked in a {{pyramidal}} formation at center. Four of the <b>pots</b> <b>are</b> shaped like people with smaller pots on their heads. All of the <b>pots</b> <b>are</b> dark in color, and have small flared openings on top. They are resting on a low platform covered with a patterned rug. The wall behind them is decorated {{with the image of}} a palm tree at left...|$|R
30|$|After seed emergence, {{only five}} plants per <b>pot</b> <b>were</b> left to grow (274 plants m− 2). The <b>pots</b> <b>were</b> {{transferred}} in an unheated plastic greenhouse {{and received the}} same volume of water that varied daily according to environmental conditions and plant needs until harvesting.|$|R
50|$|The <b>pot</b> <b>was</b> {{too big for}} Anansi to hold {{while he}} climbed the tree, so he tied {{it in front of}} him. Like this the <b>pot</b> <b>was</b> in the way and Anansi kept {{slipping}} down, getting more and more frustrated and angry with each attempt.|$|R
25|$|If {{the best}} hand {{is shared by}} more than one player, then the <b>pot</b> <b>is</b> split equally among them, with any extra chips going to the first players after the button in {{clockwise}} order. It is common for players to have closely valued, but not identically ranked hands. Nevertheless, one must be careful in determining the best hand; if the hand involves fewer than five cards, (such as two pair or three of a kind), then kickers are used to settle ties (see the second example below). The card's numerical rank is of sole importance; suit values are irrelevant in hold 'em.|$|E
25|$|In Boccaccio's Decameron a memorably morbid tale (novella V) {{tells of}} Lisabetta, whose {{brothers}} slay her lover. He appears {{to her in}} a dream and shows her where he is buried. She secretly disinters the head, and sets it in a pot of basil, which she waters with her daily tears. Shortly after the <b>pot</b> <b>is</b> taken from her by her brothers, she dies of grief. Boccaccio's tale is the source of John Keats' poem Isabella or The Pot of Basil – which in turn inspired the paintings Isabella (Millais painting) and Isabella and the Pot of Basil. A similar story is told of the Longobard queen, Rosalind.|$|E
25|$|Because of its bitter taste, lingzhi is {{traditionally}} prepared as a hot water extract product. Thinly sliced or pulverized lingzhi (either fresh or dried) {{is added to}} a pot of boiling water, the water is then reduced to a simmer, and the <b>pot</b> <b>is</b> covered; the lingzhi is then simmered for two hours. The resulting liquid is fairly bitter in taste and dark, with the more active red lingzhi more bitter than the black. The process is sometimes repeated for additional concentration. Alternatively, {{it can be used}} as an ingredient in a formula decoction or used to make an extract (in liquid, capsule, or powder form). The more active red forms of lingzhi are far too bitter to be consumed in a soup.|$|E
30|$|The <b>pots</b> <b>were</b> cut and {{the sides}} of the <b>pot</b> <b>were</b> removed. Each of the rice {{seedlings}} was lifted onto a clean piece of saran wrap and shaken to remove soil loosely adhering to the roots. This soil was stored as the loosely attached soil sample. The roots were then transferred to a sterile sampling bag and squeezed with a soft-headed hammer in order to release root-associated/endophytic bacterial cells. The rice roots were then removed leaving a mixture of adhered rhizosphere soil, rhizoplane material and endophytic material. This sample was taken as rhizosphere. Unplanted pots containing soil treated {{in the same manner as}} the planted <b>pots</b> <b>were</b> cut and {{the sides of}} the pot removed. Soil from these <b>pots</b> <b>was</b> stored as the bulk soil samples.|$|R

25|$|The <b>pot</b> <b>is</b> {{then brought}} {{on board the}} boat and the crew sorts the king crab. Any crab not meeting the {{regulation}} requirements are thrown back. The crabs are stored live in a holding tank until the boat reaches shore, where they are sold. If the weather becomes too cold the live crabs may freeze and burst. If they are left in the tank for too long they will harm and possibly kill {{each other as they}} can be cannibalistic. Even the rocking of the boat can cause damage to the crab, so boards are inserted in the holds to prevent excessive side-to-side movement. If a crab dies in the hold for any reason it releases toxins which can kill other crabs. If the crew fails to remove the dead crabs, they can poison the entire tank and ruin the catch.|$|E
25|$|The purna kumbha or full pot {{of water}} {{is the second most}} {{discernible}} element of the Ganga iconography. Appearing first also in the relief in Udayagiri Caves (5th century), it gradually appeared more frequently as the theme of the goddess matured. By the seventh century it had become an established feature, as seen, for example, the Dashavatara temple, Deogarh, Uttar Pradesh (seventh century), the Trimurti temple, Badoli, Chittorgarh, Rajasthan, and at the Lakshmaneshwar temple, Kharod, Bilaspur, Chhattisgarh, (ninth or tenth century), and seen very clearly in frame 3 above and less clearly in the remaining frames. Worshipped even today, the full <b>pot</b> <b>is</b> emblematic of the formless Brahman, as well as of woman, of the womb, and of birth. Furthermore, The river goddesses Ganga and Saraswati were both born from Brahma's pot, containing the celestial waters.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to braise meats and vegetables in a pot {{on top of a}} grill. A gas or electric charbroil grill are the best choices for barbecue-braising, combining dry heat charbroil-grilling directly on a ribbed surface and braising in a broth-filled pot for moist heat. The <b>pot</b> <b>is</b> placed on top of the grill, covered, and allowed to simmer for a few hours. There are two advantages to barbecue-braising; it allows browning of the meat directly on the grill before the braising. It also allows for glazing of meat with sauce and finishing it directly over the fire after the braising. This effectively cooks the meat three times, which results in a soft, textured product that falls off the bone. The time needed for braising varies depending on whether a slow cooker or pressure cooker is used; it is generally slower than regular grilling or baking, but quicker than pit-smoking.|$|E

5|$|The Iazyges used hanging {{barrel-shaped}} <b>pots</b> that <b>were</b> asymmetrical, and had uneven weight distribution. The rope to {{hang the}} <b>pot</b> <b>was</b> {{wrapped around the}} edges of the side collar, it is believed that the rope was tied tightly to the pot, allowing the pot to spin in circles, due to the spinning motion, several theories have been made of the use of the <b>pots.</b> It <b>is</b> believed that the smaller hanging <b>pots</b> <b>were</b> used to ferment alcohol, by use of the seeds of touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger hanging <b>pots</b> <b>were</b> used to churn butter and make cheese. They were cattle breeders, and as such required salt in order to preserve their meat, however, the Iazyges had no salt mines within their land. According to Dio, the Iazyges received grain from the Romans.|$|R
30|$|Twelve flower <b>pots</b> <b>were</b> {{randomly}} set in {{the circle}} of radius 2.5  m with centering a water sprinkler without the margins of the sprinkled area for the purpose of sprinkling the water equally. The sprinkler watered at a flow rate of 924 L h− 1, at the maximum volume, at 10 AM for 1  h every day for 12  weeks. The flower <b>pot</b> <b>was</b> checked after 7 -day (a week) sprinkling of water whether or not a serious crack occurred on the outside wall or the bottom surface of flower <b>pot.</b> If there <b>was</b> a 1.5  cm long crack on it, the flower <b>pot</b> <b>was</b> judged to be degraded.|$|R
