The CO 2 sorption/desorption rate into the APCN structure in ambient temperature was assessed. Findings show that effective parameters on foam density reduction are <b>foaming</b> temperature, saturation <b>pressure,</b> nanoclay percentage, and foaming time, respectively. According to obtained results, the nanoclay particles increase cell density. Effective parameters on cell density increase are saturation <b>pressure,</b> nanoclay percentage, <b>foaming</b> time, and foaming temperature, respectively.

Regarding the foam properties, in this study, nanocomposite foam structural properties including foam density, cell density, and cell size were characterized. As it is mentioned in the manuscript, results show that foaming temperature has the most effect on foam density, especially in temperatures lower than and around polymer transition temperature. Also, it is concluded that saturation pressure has the most effect on cell density. After saturation pressure, added nanoclay as a nucleation agent is the most significant parameter on cell density.

40|$|The {{production}} of large plastic parts, in small series and at low cost, requires {{the development of}} alternative tools and materials. Structural foams (SF) are a good solution, when the {{production of}} thicker parts with good properties is the specification.

40|$|The {{amount of}} {{greenhouse}} gases in the atmosphere has increased significantly the last 250 years, causing a global temperature rise. CO 2 emissions from fossil fuel combustion is {{a major contributor to}} greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon capture and sequestration (CCS) has been suggested and to some extent implemented as a mitigation method. This experimental work presents a study of the use of foam in a CO 2 storage context. The investigation is part of an on-going project with field pilots in Texas, where the objective is to implement mobility control with CO 2 foam for storage and enhanced oil recovery on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (NCS). Foam experiments were conducted in 100 % brine saturated sandstone core samples and fractured marble core samples, through co-injection of gas and surfactant solution at low <b>pressure.</b> <b>Foam</b> was pre-generated in a foam generator upon entering the core samples. Quantitative analyses of endpoint water saturations and pressure gradients were conducted, to evaluate the foam flow behavior and displacement improvement compared to pure gas injections. Generated fractures in impermeable marble cores provided a permeability ranging from 1. 47 D to 8. 03 D. The fractured core samples appeared to be of such a small scale that there was little or no improvement in water production during foam injections compared to pure gas injections. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was conducted for qualitative studies of water saturations, and indicated good sweep efficiency during co-injection of gas and surfactant solution in a marble core with a multi-fracture system. Calculated mobility reduction factors for foam experiments in unfractured Bentheimer sandstone cores indicated an average gas mobility reduction of 3. 94, compared to pure gas injections. Resistivity measurements conducted during pure CO 2 injections and co-injections of CO 2 gas and surfactant solution in sandstone cores were used to calculate water saturations using Archie’s law. Archie’s law is developed for use in an oil-water system, and does not consider the conductivity of the liquid phase in foam displacements. A modification is therefore needed for Archie’s law to be applicable in foam-water systems...|$|E

The rheological properties of foams are strongly influenced by parameters like temperature, absolute <b>pressure,</b> <b>foam</b> quality, texture, foam-channel wall effects, liquid phase properties, and type and concentration of surfactant. The high solids carrying capacity, the minimum amount of fluid placed in the formation, and the excellent fluid recovery after treatment are some of the advantages that foam fluids present when used during fracturing operations. This thesis is a study of foam flow in pipes, the pressure calculations, the study of rheological properties and their evaluation. The objectives of this research are to: 1. Compare various rheological models representing foams. 2. Develop an algorithm that finds the rheological parameters for the different models at different pressures in the pipe. 3. Provide an engineer with a method that predicts pressure at one end, if pressure at the other end is known, given the rheological parameters of the fluid, the diameter of the pipe and the inlet stream properties. 4. Provide a spreadsheet program for different fluid models that calculates pressures in an inclined, vertical or horizontal pipe. 5. Validate the programs. General curve fitting techniques are used to fit different models: namely, power law, Bingham plastic and Herschel Bulkley models to shear stress vs. shear rate data. The trend of the power law and Bingham plastic rheological parameters with respect to quality is observed. A method to estimate the rheological parameters at different pressures along the pipe using regression methods is developed. Spreadsheet programs for power law Bingham plastic and volume equalized power law model have been developed, which calculate pressures in inclined, horizontal and vertical pipes. The methods for the power law and Bingham plastic fluids are iterative methods. The volume equalized power law program adopts the volume equalized principle, which uses mechanical energy balance with frictional losses calculated from a rheological model. The mechanical energy balance is integrated to obtain a non-linear equation containing the unknown pressure...|$|E

40|$|Gas {{injection}} projects often {{suffer from}} poor volumetric sweep because under reservoir conditions the density and viscosity {{differences between the}} gas and the in-situ oil leads to override and bypassing {{of much of the}} oil in place. Foam has been suggested as a potential solution to this shortcoming and has shown success in some of the field applications. In the field scale foam can reduce the gas mobility, fight against gravity by inducing excess viscous forces and reduce the gas-oil ratio in the producer. Nevertheless, foam propagation in the reservoir, with low fluid velocities, and survival of foam in the path from injector to producer are among major uncertainties in foam projects. This necessitates the design of surveillance plans to monitor foam rheology and its propagation in porous media. Usually foam generation inside a porous medium is indirectly inferred from the <b>pressure</b> response; once <b>foam</b> is generated in the reservoir the <b>pressure</b> increases. <b>Foam</b> frequently exhibits non-Newtonian (shearthinning) behaviour, as it is propagated through the porous medium, which can influence the pressure transient test behaviour. This paper studies different well testing interpretation and <b>pressure</b> behaviour of <b>foam</b> flow in a homogenous reservoir. Local-equilibrium or implicit-texture foam model (that of STARS) are used to model the foam behaviour in porous media. Pressure fall-off test behaviour presented in this paper is new for foam injection. The flow regimes including inclined radial flow, radial flow, transient section, and reservoir boundary are discussed. A method which uses a pressure and a pressure derivative plot is developed for foam injection so that the mobility changes, flow behaviour index, location of foam front, reservoir parameters and reservoir boundary can be estimated.
