40|$|The {{majority}} of agricultural markets in African countries are inefficient and poorly integrated. This study therefore assessed {{the level of}} market integration and the trend analysis of selected vegetable crops in Oyo State. It also identified the leading market between rural and urban markets in Oyo state. Secondary data on the prices of fresh tomato, onion, <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper,</b> sweet pepper, and fresh pepper (2003 - 2011) were obtained from Oyo State Agricultural Development Programme and were analysed using trend analyses, Augmented Dickey-Fuller (ADF) test, Granger causality test and index of market concentration. Results showed that the prices of onion, <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> and fresh pepper were non-stationary in their various level forms but stationary at first difference; while prices of fresh tomato and sweet pepper in urban markets were stationary at their level form at probability of 5 % respectively. The indices of market concentration for onion, sweet <b>pepper,</b> fresh <b>pepper,</b> <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> were less than one suggesting high short-run market integration, whereas fresh tomato achieved low short-run market integration. Further, urban markets were the leading markets for onion, <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> and sweet pepper, while rural markets were the leading markets for fresh tomato and fresh pepper...|$|R

Field observation showed wide variation of symptom development starting from mild mottle to severe mottle and vein banding. A research was conducted to study the difference of isolates of ChiVMV collected from West Java (Cikabayan), Central Java (Karadenan), South Kalimantan (Nusa Indah), and West Sumatera (Tanah Datar) based on their response on 10 genotypes of <b>chilli</b> <b>peppers</b> i. e.

40|$|Ventricina is a {{traditional}} sausage made from pork meat produced in the Abruzzi and Molise regions. The {{aim of this study}} was to detect the content of nitrates and nitrites in local cultivars of <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper,</b> and their concentration in ventricina samples spiced with the same <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper.</b> Furthermore, it was examined whether, in the samples of ventricina with nitrate addition, the spicing with <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> could exceed the maximum added dose. The concentration of nitrates and nitrites in the organic <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> was 531. 0 ± 94. 6 mg/kg and less than 5. 0 mg, respectively, in the traditional <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> it was 394. 0 ± 39. 6 and less than 5. 0 mg, while in the commercial it was 325. 0 ± 115. 0 and less than 5. 0 mg. The determination of nitrites and nitrates was carried out by high performance ion chromatography. In ventricina samples produced without added sodium nitrate, nitrates and nitrites were below 5. 0 mg/kg at the case-filling time (t 0) and after 50 days of aging (t 50). In the samples of ventricina with added sodium nitrate, nitrate concentration values were 134. 0 ± 20. 9 mg/kg at t 0 and 129. 0 ± 15. 4 mg/kg at t 50, while the nitrites were below 5. 0 mg/kg at t 0 and 28. 8 ± 15. 8 mg/kg at t 50. Although in ventricina the amount of <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> is quite relevant, it did not lead to a detectable concentration of nitrates. The maximum allowed amount was never exceeded...|$|R

40|$|In {{elephant}} range states human-elephant conflict (HEC) {{is considered}} a serious handicap {{to the possibility of}} peaceful coexistence between free ranging elephants and their neighbouring human communities. Among measures promoted to mitigate HEC, the use of <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> as an olfactory repellent has been popularized as a passive form of deterrent. To extend its use, a gas dispenser was developed that employed ping-pong balls filled with chilli oil extract as projectiles. Following an initial test in Hwange National Park, Zimbabwe, in 2007, a further series of field tests was conducted in Mozambique, Zambia and Zimbabwe over the 2009 – 2013 period to improve the dispenser and to separate off the specific effects of <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper.</b> From > 300 attempts to deter problem elephants, it was possible to conclude that of the combination of noise, the impact of the projectile on the elephant and the release of a cloud of <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper,</b> only the exposure to <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> functioned as an efficient deterrent. The paper discusses the problem of sourcing <b>chilli</b> <b>pepper</b> in sufficient quantities, and describes an advanced prototype of the dispenser using an industrial moulding process. Successful integration of this new device with other more traditional mitigation approaches may increase human tolerance of elephants by teaching the latter to respect established boundaries and stay clear of farmed crops.
