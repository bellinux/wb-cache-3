40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about inter-facility <b>patient</b> <b>transfers</b> in populations. In 2003, {{detailed}} information about inter-facility <b>patient</b> <b>transfers</b> began to be systemati-cally collected in Ontario. Methodology: The authors undertook a descriptive examination of inter-facility <b>patient</b> <b>transfers</b> using a newly created population-based information system. Results: Approximately 1, 000 inter-facility <b>patient</b> <b>transfers</b> occur in Ontario each day, and every day and a half, the total distance travelled for these transfers equals the distance around the earth’s circumference. The annual cost for <b>patient</b> <b>transfers</b> is approximately $ 283 million. Most common were routine and non-urgent inter-facility <b>patient</b> <b>transfers.</b> Eighty-five thousand <b>patients</b> (24. 3 % of <b>transferred</b> <b>patients)</b> were transported between healthcare facilities for dialysis appointments, appointments with physicians and return trips home. Patients with circulatory conditions were the most commonly transferred diagnostic group. Although 70 % of all transfers were within 25 kilometres, some were for longer distances: for example, those involving pregnan...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: This {{intervention}} study, {{directed towards}} patients' family members, examined {{the efficacy of}} a structured individualised method of <b>patient</b> <b>transfer</b> {{from the perspective of}} Intensive Care Unit (ICU) nurses. A specifically designed brochure provided topics for the nurses to discuss in regards to <b>patient</b> <b>transfer</b> and was used by ICU nurses to guide their communication with family members and give information about impending transfer. Families retained the brochure which contained specific information hand written by the nurse. Method: An evaluation study using a nine-item questionnaire was used to appraise ICU nurses' perception of the usefulness of the structured transfer brochure to improve <b>patient</b> <b>transfer</b> from ICU to a general ward. Results: Of the original sample of 120 ICU nurses, 40 used the intervention and 33 completed the questionnaire. Respondents considered that the transfer process constituted a significant event for families who they considered fundamental to patient recovery. Communication about <b>patient</b> <b>transfer</b> was acknowledged as a sometimes overlooked aspect of ICU nurses' role. The nurses considered that the structured intervention assisted them by supporting and directing their discussion about <b>patient</b> <b>transfer</b> with family members. Around 95 % of respondents indicated it provided a useful framework for them to use and recommended its introduction for all <b>patient</b> <b>transfers</b> from ICU. Conclusions: These positive results suggest that the ICU nurses felt supported by the brochure in their role of <b>transferring</b> <b>patients.</b> The topics covered promoted discussion and improved communication with family members. Further research with a larger sample size and multi-site design is recommended to further examine the efficacy of this intervention to the broader community of ICUs.

30|$|Our {{study found}} that <b>patients</b> who were <b>transferred</b> from other {{hospitals}} to our center had less hospital and ICU mortality compared with those with direct admission from hospital wards but similar to those with direct admission from ED. <b>Patients</b> <b>transferred</b> from other hospitals had lower severity of illness compared with patients with direct admission from hospital wards but similar to those with direct admission from ED. However, <b>transferred</b> <b>patients</b> did not have higher risk-adjusted mortality compared with nontransferred patients.

40|$|Abstract. The current verbal <b>patient</b> <b>transfer</b> between {{nurses and}} paramedics lacks communication, {{which leads to}} loss of information. During this operation, {{handwritten}} protocols are used to document the patient’s personal data and the treatment given at several intervals. In order to encourage teamwork {{between the two parties}} (i. e. nurses and paramedics), the challenge is to present the patient information in a more accessible and feasible way. In this paper, we present the design and evaluation of an interactive and tangible presentation medium that aims to improve the verbal <b>patient</b> <b>transfer</b> by mediated communication. Our result shows that the concept would improve the current verbal <b>patient</b> <b>transfer</b> as evaluated by paramedics and nurses. ...|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: Nursing {{personnel}} {{have a high}} {{prevalence of}} occupational back injuries compared to other occupational groups. AIM: The {{aim of this study}} was to investigate the preventive effects of training and use of transfer devices for reported over-exertion back injuries among nursing personnel involved in <b>patient</b> <b>transfer.</b> RESULTS: Nurses who <b>transferred</b> <b>patients</b> once or more per shift had an increased relative risk (RR= 3. 3, 95 %CI= 2. 2 - 5. 1). Nurses who had got training in how to use the transfer devices on their own ward showed a lower relative risk for <b>patient</b> <b>transfer</b> (RR= 1. 6, CI=O. 9 - 2. 8) compared to nurses without training (RR= 6. 0, CI= 3. 0 - 12. 0). Also the use of transfer devices in ~ 1 / 4 of all <b>patient</b> <b>transfers,</b> reduced the relative risk (RR=l. S, CI=O. 6 - 3. 4) compared to nurses who seldom used devices (RR= 3. 9, CI= 2. 3 - 6. 6) DISCUSSION: The results show the importance of training the nurses in how to use the transfer devices on their wards and to encourage the nurses to use the transfer devices frequently during <b>patient</b> <b>transfer.</b> This presupposes tha...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The Provincial Transfer Authorization Centre (PTAC) was {{established}} {{as a part of}} the emergency response in Ontario, Canada to the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak in 2003. Prior to 2003, data relating to inter-facility <b>patient</b> <b>transfers</b> were not collected in a systematic manner. Then, in an emergency setting, a comprehensive database with a complex data collection process {{was established}}. For the first time in Ontario, population-based data for patient movement between healthcare facilities for a population of twelve million are available. The PTAC database stores all <b>patient</b> <b>transfer</b> data in a large database. There are few population-based <b>patient</b> <b>transfer</b> databases and the PTAC database is believed to be the largest example to house this novel dataset. A <b>patient</b> <b>transfer</b> database has also never been validated. This paper presents the validation of the PTAC database. Methods A random sample of 100 <b>patient</b> inter-facility <b>transfer</b> records was compared to the corresponding institutional patient records from the sending healthcare facilities. Measures of agreement, including sensitivity, were calculated for the 12 common data variables. Results Of the 100 randomly selected <b>patient</b> <b>transfer</b> records, 95 (95 %) of the corresponding institutional patient records were located. Data variables in the categories patient demographics, facility identification and timing of transfer and reason and urgency of transfer had strong agreement levels. The 10 most commonly used data variables had accuracy rates that ranged from 85. 3 % to 100 % and error rates ranging from 0 to 12. 6 %. These same variables had sensitivity values ranging from 0. 87 to 1. 0. Conclusion The very high level of agreement between institutional patient records and the PTAC data for fields compared in this study supports the validity of the PTAC database. For the first time, a population-based <b>patient</b> <b>transfer</b> database has been established. Although it was created during an emergency situation and data collection is dependent on front-line medical workers, the PTAC data has achieved a high level of validity, perhaps even higher than many purpose built databases created during non-emergency settings. </p...|$|R

40|$|Aims and objectives: To {{determine}} {{the rate of}} patient moves and the impact on nurses’ time. Background: Bed shortages and strategies designed to increase patient flow {{have led to a}} global increase in <b>patient</b> <b>transfers</b> between wards. The impact of <b>transferring</b> <b>patients</b> between wards and between beds within a ward on nurses’ workload has not previously been measured. Design: A two-stage sequential study. Retrospective analysis of hospital data and a prospective observational-timing study. Methods: Secondary analysis of an administrative data set to inform the rate of ward and bed transfers (n = 34, 715) was undertaken followed by an observational-timing study of nurses’ activities associated with <b>patient</b> <b>transfers</b> (n = 75). Results: Over 10, 000 patients were moved 34, 715 times in 1 year which equates to an average of 2. 4 <b>transfers</b> per <b>patient.</b> On average, <b>patient</b> <b>transfers</b> took 42 min and bed transfers took 11 min of nurses’ time. Based on the frequency of patient moves, 11. 3 full-time equivalent nurses are needed to move patients within the site hospital each month.
