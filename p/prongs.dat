5|$|In most bouts, the retiarius {{probably}} had {{to resort to}} fighting with just his trident and dagger, placing him at a disadvantage. The trident was his primary weapon in such situations, and its length allowed the retiarius to keep his opponent at bay. He held the weapon two-handed, left nearer the <b>prongs,</b> so that he could parry his enemy's strikes with its shaft and strike with both ends. Wielded two-handed, the weapon could land powerful blows. Images show retiarii stabbing downward at the secutors unshielded legs or stabbing down at the helmet in an attempt to poke through an eyehole. The trident itself was too weak to pierce the metal, although a skull found at Ephesus, Turkey, dating to CE200 to 300 shows that a trident strike to the head could be fatal on a bareheaded opponent. The secutors helmet was rounded and free of protrusions to avoid snaring the net or being caught in the trident's <b>prongs,</b> but attacks on it forced the secutor to duck or hide behind his shield. This reduced his field of vision and gave the retiarius an advantage with his speed. Should the secutor strike with his sword, the retiarius parried with the trident <b>prongs</b> and attempted to disarm him. Likewise, the more heavily armoured gladiator tried to block the trident with his shield and force the net-man to lose it. Another type of gladiator, scissor could also be pitted against a retiarius. Images from the Eastern Roman Empire show scissores wearing a tubular arm-guard in lieu of a shield. The guard fits over the left hand and ends in a hooked, knife-like blade that was probably intended to parry the net and trident or to snag and pull away the net. Scissores who succeeded in this probably dropped the hook weapon and fought with just a sword.|$|E
5|$|New {{material}} from the Kaiparowits Formation of Utah, in Grand Staircase-Escalante National Monument, includes a skull and partial skeleton that represent the species G. monumentensis. Its skull was more robust {{than that of the}} other species, and its predentary had enlarged <b>prongs</b> along its upper margin, where the lower jaw's beak was based. This new species greatly expands the geographic range of this genus, and there may be a second, more lightly built species present as well. Multiple gryposaur species are known from the Kaiparowits Formation, represented by cranial and postcranial remains, and were larger than their northern counterparts.|$|E
5000|$|Following the playoffs, <b>Pronger</b> {{underwent}} arthroscopic knee surgery. <b>Pronger</b> {{missed the}} first two games of the [...] season. Various other injuries would limit <b>Pronger</b> to just 50 games, marking the first time that <b>Pronger</b> missed significant time since the [...] season, where <b>Pronger</b> missed 77 games. On September 16, 2011, <b>Pronger</b> was named the 18th captain in Philadelphia Flyers history, replacing Mike Richards, traded to the Los Angeles Kings just before the 2011 draft. However, multiple hits resulting in post-concussion syndrome (the last being a collision with Martin Hanzal, who, like <b>Pronger,</b> is 6'6") limited <b>Pronger</b> to 13 games before <b>Pronger</b> was shut down for the season in mid-December, with the post-concussion syndrome placing Pronger's career in jeopardy. <b>Pronger</b> also had problems in his right eye after being struck by the stick of Mikhail Grabovski in October 2011.|$|R

50|$|The upper tributaries of the Little Red River are ephemeral streams {{known as}} the North <b>Prong</b> and South <b>Prong</b> Red River. Both streams {{originate}} along the eastern Caprock Escarpment of the Llano Estacado in Briscoe County, Texas, and flow through Caprock Canyons State Park. The North <b>Prong</b> flows {{to the north and}} the South <b>Prong</b> passes to the south of Haynes Ridge, a landmark feature of Caprock Canyons. The North <b>Prong</b> and South <b>Prong</b> merge at a point about 6 mi north of Quitaque, Texas, to form the Little Red River proper.|$|R
5|$|Thelephora palmata (commonly {{known as}} the stinking earthfan or the fetid false coral) is a species of clavarioid fungus in the family Thelephoraceae. The fruit bodies are {{leathery}} and coral-like, with branches that are narrow at the base before widening out like a fan and splitting into numerous flattened <b>prongs.</b> The wedge-like tips are whitish when young, but darken as the fungus matures. The common names of the fungus refers to its pungent odor, likened to fetid garlic. A widely distributed but uncommon species, it is found in Asia, Australia, Europe, North America, and South America, where it fruits {{on the ground in}} both coniferous and mixed forest.|$|E
5|$|The {{skeletal}} reconstruction {{accompanying the}} 1908 description restored the missing parts {{in a fashion}} similar to Stegosaurus, and Brown likened the result to the extinct armored mammal Glyptodon. Contrary to modern depictions, Brown's stegosaur-like reconstruction showed robust forelimbs, a strongly arched back, a pelvis with <b>prongs</b> projecting forwards from the ilium and pubis, {{as well as a}} short, drooping tail without a tail club, which was unknown at the time. Brown also reconstructed the armor plates in parallel rows running down the back; this arrangement was purely hypothetical. Brown's reconstruction became highly influential, and restorations of the animal based on his diagram were published as late as the 1980s. In a 1908 review of Brown's Ankylosaurus description, American paleontologist Samuel Wendell Williston criticised the skeletal reconstruction as being based on too scanty remains, and claimed that Ankylosaurus was merely a synonym of the genus Stegopelta, which Williston had named in 1905. Williston also stated that a skeletal reconstruction of the related Polacanthus by Hungarian paleontologist Franz Nopcsa was a better example of how ankylosaurs would have appeared in life. The claim of synonymy was not accepted by other researchers, and the two genera are now considered distinct.|$|E

50|$|In {{the early}} years of his St. Louis career, <b>Pronger</b> played under coach and general manager Mike Keenan who insisted on <b>Pronger</b> {{improving}} his conditioning and reducing his mistakes.

50|$|The {{separation}} {{tool assembly}} is run on an appropriate running tool {{complete with a}} running <b>prong.</b> The running <b>prong</b> {{is connected to the}} top of the internal seal <b>prong</b> with a shear pin, and the running tool is attached to the lock in the normal manner. After locating the sliding sleeve, the operator jars downward to set the lock, then pulls upward to close the isolation plug in the separation tool. As this happens, a garter spring in the isolation plug moves a steel shear pin into a groove on the sealing <b>prong,</b> and an O-ring on the internal <b>prong</b> seals to isolate the tubing below the sliding sleeve. The running <b>prong</b> that is pinned {{to the top of the}} internal <b>prong</b> is then sheared, and the slickline toolstring may be withdrawn from the well.|$|R
