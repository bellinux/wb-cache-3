The main medical facility was on Bougainville, and built by the 36th Naval Construction Battalion. It consisted of 70 Quonset hut and a [...] mess hall, with accommodation for 500 patients. The inland road network was the responsibility of the US Army engineers, particularly the 117th Combat Engineer Battalion.

A three-span bridge was built over the Koromokina River. Base development work was completed by July 1944, and the last naval construction battalion, the 36th, departed in August.

2500|$|By {{the late}} 18th century, {{most of the}} {{southern}} region of India had been conquered by the British and Madras was established as {{the capital of the}} Madras Presidency.

A port at Madras was first suggested by Warren Hastings in 1770 when he was posted here, who later became the first Governor General of India. However, {{it was not until the}} 1850s that work began on a pier to berth vessels following suggestions from the Madras Chamber of Commerce and Industry. Till 1815, it was an open roadstead and exposed sandy coast, swept by occasional storms and monsoons. At the time, the natural harbour was so shallow that ships had to anchor over [...] offshore, and cargo was delivered to and from the shore in masula boats and catamarans. Cargo losses were high, close to 90 percent, in addition to pilfering with several goods from the ships often taken to the nearby evening bazaar. A [...] iron-screw <b>pile</b> <b>pier</b> capable of berthing larger vessels was built perpendicular to the shore in 1861. However, the storms of 1868 and 1872 made the initial piers inoperative. In 1875, Edward VII laid the foundation stone for a new port, and the masonry work for L-shaped breakwaters was started in 1876. The northern and southern groynes of the harbour were constructed, to create a still water enclosure that would be unaffected by storm and surf water. However, the groynes collapsed in 1877. The same year, construction of the south pier was commenced with concrete blocks weighing 33 tonnes each brought from Pallavaram, and the port started handling ships inside the harbour from 1881. However, again the storm of 12 November 1881 completely washed the almost-completed harbour, breaching over half a mile of breakwater. An artificial harbour was then built and the operations were started in 1881, and the pier was rebuilt in 1885, although there was a demand for relocating the entrance. Work on the harbour was completed in 1911. The Chennai Port Trust has taken the year 1881, the year of rebuilding, as the starting year. The cargo operations were carried out on the northern pier, located on the northeastern side of Fort St. George in Chennai. In the first couple of years the port registered traffic of 300,000 tonnes of cargo handling 600 ships. The first railway line in South India was laid between Madras and Arcot which started operating in 1856. By the late 19th century, the port was well connected to the other two important cities in the British colony, viz. Bombay (Mumbai) and Calcutta (Kolkata). In 1904, a new northeastern entrance was added to control siltation in the basin, after closing the original eastern entrance. The port's quays (berths) were constructed at different periods—the South Quay I in 1913, the five west quay berths between 1916 and 1920, the north quay in 1931 and the South Quay II in 1936, in the Inner Harbour, later christened Dr. Ambedkar Dock. Chennai was the only Indian city to be attacked by the Central Powers during World War I when a German cruiser, , shelled the oil depot within the port belonging to the Burmah Oil Company and raided vessels in 1914 disrupting trade, resulting in the death of at least 5 sailors. Other than Calcutta, which was practically taken over by the American army , Chennai port was the only other operational one in eastern waters during the Second World War. In 1911, the Royal Madras Yacht Club (RMYC), which is based within the Chennai Port premises, was founded by Sir Francis Joseph Edward Spring, the first chairman on the Madras Port Trust who was responsible for Chennai becoming a trading hub, especially during World War II.

[...] Over {{the course of the}} next four decades further {{extensions}} were made as far as Orawia. The line became known as the Tuatapere Branch. [...] The original railway (that eventually reached Tuatapere in 1909) crossed the estuary at Riverton using the bridge opened in 1875, the towns inhabitants sharing a road-rail bridge for twenty-six years. With the construction (1902-1905) of a combination of two Howe truss bridges and a causeway the Tuatapere Branch railway had a crossing of its own over the Jacobs River Estuary. The main bridge on the south end consisted of seventeen built beams of 9.2 metres and two Howe trusses of 18.3 metres span, giving a hybrid form of design. The supporting piers were of braced timber piles. This bridge provided a good illustration of the timber technology of the period, with its three elements of truss, built beam and <b>piled</b> <b>piers.</b> On 30 July 1976, it was truncated from Tuatapere back to Riverton and became known as the Riverton Branch.

40|$|A Thesis {{submitted}} to the Dept. of Civil Engineering for the Degree of Master of EngineeringThe two basic types of pile foundations are skin friction piles and end- bearing piles. Friction piles resist the applied vertical load by utilising the shear stresses developed along the pile-soil interface, with the end-bearing {{at the tip of}} pile contributing a small proportion of the total pile resistance. End-bearing piles resist the applied vertical loads mainly by end bearing generated at the tip of pile. There are many instances where end-bearing <b>piles</b> <b>piers</b> are constructed with their tip located inside a cavity made in rock strata: such piles are referred to as rock-socketed piles. The resistance developed by rock-socketed <b>piles</b> and <b>piers</b> is partially due to the shearing stresses generated at the pile rock interface {{on the wall of the}} rock cavity and partially due to the end bearing at the tip of the pile. The load that can be carried by the rock socket is usually underestimated in the design practice due the lack of guidance in relevant codes. This thesis presents the findings of the research focused on computational modeling of rock socketed piles conducted to investigate the behavior of such piles. Ax symmetric finite element analyses were conducted to determine the percentages of load resisted by interface shear along the socket wall and end-bearing at pile tip, for various socket length/pile diameter ratios. Different interface conditions were modelled by varying cohesion and friction parameters input to the interface element, as well as by assuming perfect connection between pile and rock material The finite element results obtained are compared with some available field test data to verify the models. Finally a field test procedure is suggested for deriving load carrying capacity of the socket. Findings and further expansion of this research program would be of immense benefit to state and private organizations involved in deep foundation design and construction. It will highlight whether the use of rock-socketed piles can be economically advantageous over the simple end bearing piles with no sockets, and indicate optimum geometries of rock sockets...|$|R
