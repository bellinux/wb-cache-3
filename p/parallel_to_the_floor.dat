40|$|<b>The</b> first demonstration, <b>to</b> our knowledge, of an {{evolutionary}} shift in communication mode in animals is presented. Some species of Ovalipes display spectacular iridescence resulting from multilayer reflectors in the cuticle. This reflector {{is unique in}} animals because each layer is corrugated and slightly out of phase with adjacent layers. Solid layers are separated from fluid layers in the reflector by side branches acting as support struts. An effect of this reflector is that blue light is reflected over a 'broad' angle around a plane <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea <b>floor</b> when <b>the</b> host crab is resting. Species of Ovalipes all possess stridulatory structures. The shallow-water species with the best developed stridulatory structures are non-iridescent and use sound as a signal. Deep-water species possess poorly developed stridulatory structures and display iridescence from most regions of the body. In deep water, where incident light is blue, light display is highly directional in contrast to sound produced via stridulation. Sound and light display probably perform the same function of sexual signalling in Ovalipes, although the directional signal {{is less likely to}} attract predators. Deep-water species of Ovalipes appear to have evolved towards using light in conspecific signalling. This change from using sound to using light reflects the change in habitat light properties, perhaps the hunting mechanisms of cohabitees, and its progression is an indicator of phylogeny. The changes in sexual signalling mechanisms, following spatial–geographical isolation, may have promoted speciation in Ovalipes...|$|R

40|$|Data {{from two}} {{shipboard}} experiments in 1994, designed <b>to</b> observe <b>the</b> semidiurnal internal tide in Monterey Canyon, reveal semidiurnal currents of about 20 cm s 21, {{which is an}} order of magnitude larger than the estimated barotropic tidal currents. The kinetic and potential energy (evidenced by isopycnal displacements of about 50 m) was greatest along paths following the characteristics calculated from linear theory. These energy ray paths are oriented nearly <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canyon <b>floor</b> and may originate from large bathymetric features beyond the mouth of Monterey Bay. Energy propagated shoreward during the April experiment (ITEX 1), whereas a standing wave, that is, an internal seiche, was observed in October (ITEX 2). The difference is attributed to changes in stratification between the two experiments. Higher energy levels were present during ITEX 1, which took place near the spring phase of the fortnightly (14. 8 days) cycle in sea level, while ITEX 2 occurred close <b>to</b> <b>the</b> neap phase. Further evidence of phase-locking between the surface and internal tides comes from monthlong current and temperature records obtained near the canyon head in 1991. The measured ratio of kinetic to potential energy during both ITEX 1 and ITEX 2 was only half that predicted by linear theory for freely propagating internal waves, probably a result of the constraining effects of topography. Internal tidal energy dissipation rate estimates for ITEX 1 range from 1. 3 3 1024 to 2. 3 3 1023 W m 23, depending on assumptions made about the effect of canyon shape on dissipation. Cross-canyon measurements made during ITEX 2 reveal vertical transport of denser water from within the canyon up onto the adjacent continental shelf. 1...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT. Particulate matter (PM) {{emission}} {{rates from}} two high‐rise layer barns (barns 1 and 2) were measured from 1 August 2004 to 31 January 2005. A commercial particulate impaction curtain (PIC) was installed <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> first <b>floor</b> sidewalls and upstream of the exhaust fans of barn 2 for PM reduction by impaction. Tapered element oscillating microbalance (TEOM) monitors {{were used to}} measure PM 10 (PM < 10 m) concentrations of barn 1 exhaust air and {{before and after the}} PIC in barn 2. Concentrations of total suspended particulate (TSP) were monitored at each location two to three times per week with a gravimetric sampler. Prior <b>to</b> <b>the</b> six‐month full‐scale test, a preliminary test of the PIC was conducted at a single continuous sidewall fan of barn 2 for 10 d. Results of the preliminary test indicated that the PIC reduced PM 10 emission by 33 % to 49 % and TSP emission by 62 % to 72 %. In the full‐scale test, average untreated daily mean PM 10 emissions were 30 ± 13 and 35 ± 33 mg d- 1 hen- 1 (mean ±standard deviation) from barns 1 and 2, respectively. The mean treated PM 10 emission rate was 22 ± 23 mg d- 1 hen- 1 and was decreased by 41 % based on measurements before and after the PIC. However, some dilution occurred due to backflow through non‐operating fans. The TSP emission rate of barn 2 was 27 ± 23 g d- 1 AU- 1, 39 % lower than barn 1, which was 44 ± 29 g d- 1 AU- 1. However, some important practical issues currently hinder the use of PIC in high‐rise layer barns...|$|R
40|$|Text {{presented}} in modern lecture halls often simultaneously appears on multiple visual media (e. g., blackboard, projection screens, TV) that have different locations, geometries, orientations, and lighting conditions. An ideal viewing area inside which all text is legible <b>to</b> <b>the</b> entire audience {{could be calculated}} using equations that predict the spatial legibility of text viewed from any directions across the lecture hall. However, among the 95 legibility equations ever published in the literature, none can serve this purpose. After using ten assumptions <b>to</b> narrow down <b>the</b> research scope, this study applies a constant-solid-angle hypothesis <b>to</b> develop <b>the</b> demanded equation from the existing Howett’s equation (1983). This derived equation examines seven critical factors but the surrounding luminance of the ambient environment, which may reduce its accuracy. The hypothesis is first verified consistent with how retinal images of text activate cones in the centre fovea of an observer’s eyes, then tested in the lighting laboratory at the University of Michigan Transportation Research Institute using legibility data collected from 3 subjects in a pilot experiment and 20 subjects in a follow-up main experiment. Both experimental setups abide by the typical viewing conditions surveyed in 38 lecture halls at the University of Michigan. The outcomes show that the hypothesis holds when incident angle is 0 - 65. 7 degree, {{but it does not}} hold when 65. 7 - 82. 8 degree (the largest angle examined). The derived equation is thus accordingly improved. Moreover, this study uses 20 human subjects with a modified setup at four different ambient light levels in <b>the</b> same laboratory <b>to</b> verify <b>the</b> negligible effect of ambient light on legibility. The validated equation is then improved and used as the underlying algorithm for developing a computation-program-aided design method in MatLab.

It was found that the developed thermal LB model gives excellent results by comparison with former experimental and numerical findings. Starting from the values 105 of the Rayleigh number Ra and Ha= 0, the flow is unsteady multicellular for low Prandtl number typical of liquid metal. Increasing gradually Pr, the flow undergoes transition <b>to</b> steady bicellular, <b>the</b> transition occurs at a threshold value between Pr= 0. 01 and 0. 1.

40|$|Variations in shape, metal content, {{alteration}} mineralogy, and volcanic host {{rocks of}} the ore deposits {{in the two}} major volcanic-hosted massive sulfide (VHMS) districts of eastern Australia, the Cambrian Mount Read Volcanics and the Cambro-Ordovician Mount Windsor subprovince, strongly reflect their volcanic environment, conditions of ore formation, and hydrothermal alteration processes. Lens and sheet-style polymetallic zinc-rich deposits such as Rosebery, Hellyer, Que River, and Thalanga are considered to have formed in moderate to relatively deep water environments (500 - 1, 000 +m). These deposits probably formed either on <b>the</b> sea <b>floor</b> (e. g., Hellyer, Que River) or by replacement of porous volcaniclastic units directly below <b>the</b> sea <b>floor</b> (e. g., Rosebery). The footwall alteration associated with these polymetallic VHMS deposits was controlled by host-rock permeability and porosity, which are in turn related to volcanic facies type, degree of fracturing, and synvolcanic structural architecture. Focusing of hydrothermal fluids along synvolcanic structures has resulted in well-zoned chlorite-sericite footwall alteration pipes within footwall lavas at Hellyer. On the other hand, diffuse fluid flow through very thick pumice breccia at Rosebery and Hercules has resulted in strata-bound, sericite-dominated footwall alteration zones <b>parallel</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> paleosea <b>floor</b> and <b>the</b> ore lenses. Massive and disseminated, pyritic Cu-Au deposits, {{such as those in}} the Mount Lyell field and at Highway-Reward, formed by subsea-floor replacement and are associated with only minor zinc-lead massive sulfide ore. These deposits formed from higher temperature fluids (> 300 degrees C), in which copper transport is enhanced, and are commonly located in felsic volcanic centers dominated by shallow porphyritic intrusions (e. g., Highway-Reward). The Cu-Au ore lenses may be strata-bound (e. g., Mount Lyell) or crosscutting pipes (e. g., Highway-Reward) depending on the structure and permeability characteristics of the felsic volcanic host rocks. The presence of high-sulfidation alteration minerals (e. g., pyrophyllite, zunyite) in some of the Cu-Au deposits (e. g., Mount Lyell field) indicates that fluids were relatively acidic and suggests the possibility of magmatic fluid input into the hydrothermal system. Alteration zonation associated with the Cu-Au VHMS deposits is more symmetrical than that of the Zn-rich deposits, with sericite-rich alteration extending into the hanging wall, in keeping with the subsurface replacement origin of these deposits. Synvolcanic gold-rich deposits, with high gold/base metal ratios are less common than the Cu-Au and Zn-rich VHMS ore types. The gold-rich ores (e. g., Henty, South Hercules) are strata bound in nature, have low sulfide contents, and are associated with central zones of intense silicification, surrounded by envelopes of sericite-pyrite and carbonate alteration. Volcanological and geochemical studies at Henty indicate the gold-rich ore formed by the replacement of particular volcanic units deposited in a relatively shallow water environment dominated by volcaniclastic facies, lavas, and limestones. This spectrum of Cu-Au, Zn-rich, and Au-only deposits in the Mount Read Volcanics and the Mount Windsor subprovince is interpreted to represent a continuum from classic sea-floor VHMS ores toward those with features more akin to porphyry Cu-Au and epithermal Au-Ag deposits. This spectrum relates <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interplay between factors in the submarine volcanic environment and the character of the hydrothermal fluid as follows: (1) proportions of volcaniclastic, lava, and subvolcanic intrusive facies; (2) depth of seawater; (3) permeability and porosity of volcanic host rocks; (4) balance between magmatic components and seawater components in the ore fluid; and (5) temperature and acidity of the ore fluid. Mineralogical, lithogeochemical, and isotopic studies have revealed a range of alteration vectors useful in exploration for both the Zn-rich and Cu-Au VHMS deposits. Carbonate and white mica compositional variations are highlighted as important mineralogical vectors; thallium and antimony halos may be useful trace element vectors; and oxygen and sulfur provide important isotope vectors {{toward the center of the}} hydrothermal system...|$|R
