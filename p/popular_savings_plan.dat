More general tax relief of saving and redeployment of grant money would be simpler and could better improve access to postsecondary education for lower-income families. EDUCATION PAPER The Study in Brief Since 1998, the government of Canada has substantially expanded its support for registered education <b>savings</b> <b>plans</b> (RESPs) {{as a means of}} subsidizing savings for young people’s education. This Commentary examines RESPs both analytically and statistically to gauge their effectiveness; it finds several flaws in the program. The primary economic effect of RESPs is to add needless complexity to Canada’s tax system. Through registered retirement <b>savings</b> <b>plans</b> (RRSPs) and other forms of tax-advantaged savings, Canadians already have access to tax-exempt accrual of income. The addition of extra contribution room through the RESPs may attract savings that were destined for another tax-advantaged form, but is unlikely t...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{uses the}} data from INSEE’s  2004  household assets survey (Enquête Patrimoine) to {{highlight}} the determinants of holding a contractual financial <b>saving</b> <b>plan</b> to provide supplementary income, distinguishing between working and retired households. Our {{results suggest that the}} profiles of individuals holding certain types of contractual <b>saving</b> <b>plans</b> (retirement <b>saving</b> and life insurance) are determined by factors common to workers and retirees, and tend to confirm behaviour of saving for retirement. Factoring in occupational status reveals specific profiles that suggest that private-sector workers are disadvantaged, particularly with regard to retirement saving. The discrepancy between the public and the private sector in terms of the supplementary retirement <b>saving</b> <b>plans</b> available is a potential source of inequality in terms of household participation in these schemes. The overlap between holding retirement savings and holding alternative savings (life insurance, employee <b>saving</b> <b>plans)</b> in preparation for old age indicates that altruism and a wish to make inter-generational transfers are among the motivations of holders of annuity products, since a significant proportion hold supplementary death insurance. The need to save for retirement via a non-occupational plan is lessened by the availability of a company retirement <b>saving</b> <b>plan,</b> which households with high incomes and financial assets are the most likely to hold. Employee <b>saving</b> <b>plans,</b> which are the only type of <b>saving</b> <b>plan</b> open to younger cohorts of households, are complementary to company retirement <b>saving</b> <b>plans...</b>|$|R

The share of employed tax filers participating in either type of plan declined from 54 % in 1997 to 50 % in 2008 and this is mainly driven by a decreasing share of employed tax filers contributing to a RRSP.
