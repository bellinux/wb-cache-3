Shortly thereafter, an Interim Critical Design Review would follow in Mid-FY 2013. After a nearly two-year manufacturing period the first prototypes would be manufactured Mid-FY 2015 after which a Critical Design Review and a Production Readiness Review would occur in FY 2015 and FY 2016 respectively.|$|E

500|$|Five {{companies}} responded and in 1972, the Air Staff selected General Dynamics' Model 401 and Northrop's P-600 for the follow-on <b>prototype</b> <b>development</b> {{and testing}} phase. GD and Northrop were awarded contracts worth $37.9million and $39.8million {{to produce the}} YF-16 and YF-17, respectively, with first flights of both prototypes planned for early 1974. To overcome resistance in the Air Force hierarchy, the Fighter Mafia and other LWF proponents successfully advocated the idea of complementary fighters in a high-cost/low-cost force mix. The [...] "high/low mix" [...] would allow the USAF {{to be able to}} afford sufficient fighters for its overall fighter force structure requirements. The mix gained broad acceptance by the time of the prototypes' flyoff, defining the relationship of the LWF and the F-15.|$|E
500|$|The first <b>prototype</b> <b>development</b> {{began in}} 1925. [...] Produced in the Trubia Artillery Factory (Fábrica de Artillería Trubia), in Asturias, the tank was {{powered by a}} four-cylinder Hispano-Suiza 40/50 engine, the same engine the Spanish Army's {{military}} trucks had been equipped with since 1915. Given the Spanish Army's opinion that the FT was limited in firepower, the Trubia tank featured a special turret. The turret was designed in two articulated halves, which could traverse independently, each armed with a machine gun. Theoretically, {{if one of the}} machine guns jammed, the tank would still have another one to defend itself with. Furthermore, the vehicle's hull was provided with firing ports, to allow the crew to fire from within the tank. [...] This prototype was put through a series of tests, and its success brought about the decision to continue development on a Spanish tank, leading to an improved Trubia tank design, known as the Modelo Trubia 75HP, tipo rápido, serie A (Model Trubia 75hp, fast tank, series A).|$|E

2500|$|The Premier {{inspired}} {{many of the}} LH platform’s design features. François Castaing, formerly AMC's Vice President {{of product}} engineering and development, became Chrysler's Vice President of vehicle engineering in 1988, and as a result, the Premier was {{the starting point for}} Chrysler's new LH sedans. Although the cab forward styling was quite different, the engines in the LH cars were mounted longitudinally, like the Premier. This was [...] "a hallmark of Renault's front-wheel-drive designs" [...] and unlike any other car built by Chrysler to that time. The LH platform's dedicated transmission, the A606, was also quite similar in design to the electronically controlled automatic featured in four-cylinder Premiers. The Premier's body shell was used for LH <b>prototype</b> <b>development</b> mules, under which the LH drivetrain was tested.|$|E
2500|$|Author A.R. Weyl (Fokker: the {{creative}} years, Putnam 1965) says that, while Fokker was a talented and bold pilot, his business character was more flawed. He failed to reinvest war profits {{back into his}} factory which consequentially struggled to fulfill war contracts as the factory floor was often muddled with <b>prototype</b> <b>development</b> and production taking {{place at the same}} time. Fokker distrusted qualified engineers (which he was not) and resented frequent German insistence on carrying out stringent structural tests to ensure prototype aircraft were fit for combat. He could be bad tempered and insensitive as when he verbally abused his dying designer Martin Kreuzer on the evening of 27 June 1916, after Kreuzer had crashed the prototype Fokker D.I. The rudder jammed but Kreuzer was able to give a verbal report on the accident before he died. [...] "Fokker hurried to the scene and shouted reproaches at the mortally injured man". Weyl says this incident was witnessed by Reinhold Platz, who succeeded Kreuzer.|$|E
