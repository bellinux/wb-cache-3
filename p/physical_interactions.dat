5|$|In 1916, Einstein {{predicted}} gravitational waves, ripples in {{the curvature}} of spacetime which propagate as waves, traveling {{outward from the}} source, transporting energy as gravitational radiation. The existence of gravitational waves is possible under general relativity due to its Lorentz invariance which brings {{the concept of a}} finite speed of propagation of the <b>physical</b> <b>interactions</b> of gravity with it. By contrast, gravitational waves cannot exist in the Newtonian theory of gravitation, which postulates that the <b>physical</b> <b>interactions</b> of gravity propagate at infinite speed.|$|E
5|$|Lie {{groups are}} of {{fundamental}} importance in modern physics: Noether's theorem links continuous symmetries to conserved quantities. Rotation, {{as well as}} translations {{in space and time}} are basic symmetries of the laws of mechanics. They can, for instance, be used to construct simple models—imposing, say, axial symmetry on a situation will typically lead to significant simplification in the equations one needs to solve to provide a physical description. Another example are the Lorentz transformations, which relate measurements of time and velocity of two observers in motion relative to each other. They can be deduced in a purely group-theoretical way, by expressing the transformations as a rotational symmetry of Minkowski space. The latter serves—in the absence of significant gravitation—as a model of space time in special relativity. The full symmetry group of Minkowski space, i.e., including translations, is known as the Poincaré group. By the above, it plays a pivotal role in special relativity and, by implication, for quantum field theories. Symmetries that vary with location are central to the modern description of <b>physical</b> <b>interactions</b> with the help of gauge theory.|$|E

The velocity of each component depends on its chemical nature, {{on the nature of}} the stationary phase (column) and on the composition of the mobile phase.

The retention time measured under particular conditions is an identifying characteristic of a given analyte.|$|E

Specifically, this study focused on ascertaining the developmental features of 3 - and 4 -year-olds. This study found that: 1) <b>Physical</b> <b>interaction</b> that starts with being imitated is present even {{at the age of}} 4 but is less evident than it is at the age of 3. 2) A child 2 ̆ 7 s awareness that he or she was being imitated, i. e. modeled, differed in 3 -year-olds and 4 -year-olds. Three-year-olds tended to enjoy repeatedly acting in concert or in sync with others. In contrast, 4 -year-olds were consciously aware that others were imitating them. Their strategy was to provide a model that others would imitate, which led to <b>physical</b> <b>interaction.</b> 3) Three-year-old acted upon desires at either extreme, i. e. wanting to do something and not wanting to do something, and these actions affected the increase in <b>physical</b> <b>interaction.</b> In contrast, 4 -year-olds were somewhat aware of their own desire to do something.

25|$|Various {{theories}} {{have been put}} forward to explain the occurrence of hallucinations. When psychodynamic (Freudian) theories were popular in psychology, hallucinations were seen as a projection of unconscious wishes, thoughts, and wants. As biological {{theories have}} become orthodox, hallucinations are more often thought of (by psychologists at least) as being caused by functional deficits in the brain. With reference to mental illness, the function (or dysfunction) of the neurotransmitters glutamate and dopamine {{are thought to be}} particularly important. The Freudian interpretation may have an aspect of truth, as the biological hypothesis explains the <b>physical</b> <b>interactions</b> in the brain, while the Freudian interpretation addresses the psychological complexes related to the content of the hallucination, such as hallucinating persecutory voices due to guilt. Psychological research has argued that hallucinations may result from biases in what are known as metacognitive abilities.|$|E

500|$|Since protein {{structure}} was so poorly {{understood in the}} 1930s, the <b>physical</b> <b>interactions</b> responsible for stabilizing that structure were likewise unknown. [...] Astbury hypothesized that the structure of fibrous proteins was stabilized by hydrogen bonds in β-sheets. [...] The idea that globular proteins are also stabilized by hydrogen bonds was proposed by Dorothy Jordan Lloyd in 1932, and championed later by Alfred Mirsky and Linus Pauling. [...] At a 1933 lecture by Astbury to the Oxford Junior Scientific Society, physicist Frederick Frank suggested that the fibrous protein α-keratin might be stabilized by an alternative mechanism, namely, covalent crosslinking of the peptide bonds by the cyclol reaction above. [...] The cyclol crosslink draws the two peptide groups close together; the N and C atoms are separated by ~1.5Å, whereas they are separated by ~3Å in a typical hydrogen bond.

[...] Rosetta, the program on which Rosetta@home is based, has been used since CASP5 in 2002. [...] In the 2004 CASP6 experiment, Rosetta made history by being the first to produce a close to atomic-level resolution, ab initio protein structure prediction in its submitted model for CASP target T0281. [...] Ab initio modeling is considered an especially difficult category of protein structure prediction, as it does not use information from structural homology and must rely on information from sequence homology and modeling <b>physical</b> <b>interactions</b> within the protein. Rosetta@home has been used in CASP since 2006, where it was among the top predictors in every category of structure prediction in CASP7. These high quality predictions were enabled by the computing power made available by Rosetta@home volunteers. Increasing computing power allows Rosetta@home to sample more regions of conformation space (the possible shapes a protein can assume), which, according to Levinthal's paradox, is predicted to increase exponentially with protein length.|$|E
