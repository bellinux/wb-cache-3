Geo-location databases protect TV band incumbents by keeping track of TV transmitters and their <b>protected</b> <b>service</b> areas based on their location, transmission parameters and sophisticated propagation models. In this article, we argue that keeping track of both TV transmitters and TV receivers (i. e. TV sets) can achieve significant improvement in the availability of white spaces. We first identify wasted spectrum opportunities, both temporal and spatial, due to the current approach of white spaces detection. We then propose DynaWhite, a cloud-based architecture that orchestrates the detection and dissemination of highly-dynamic, real-time, and fine-grained TV white space information. DynaWhite introduces {{the next generation of}} geo-location databases by combining traditional sensing techniques with a novel unconventional sensing approach based on the detection of the passive TV receivers using standard cell phones. We present a quantitative evaluation of the potential gains in white space availability for large scale deployments of DynaWhite.

40|$|Protection against Denial of Service (DoS) attacks is a {{challenging}} and ongoing problem. Current overlay-based solutions can transparently filter unauthorized traffic based on user authentication. Such solutions require either pre-established trust or explicit user interaction to operate, {{which can be}} circumvented by determined attackers and is not always feasible (e. g., when user interaction is impossible or undesirable). We propose a Multi-layer Overlay Network (MON) architecture that {{does not depend on}} user authentication, but instead utilizes two mechanisms to provide DoS resistant to any IP-based service, and operates on top of the existing network infrastructure. First, MON implements a threshold-based intrusion detection mechanism in a distributed fashion to mitigate DoS close to the attack source. Second, it randomly distributes user packets amongst different paths to probabilistically increase service availability during an attack. We evaluate MON using the Apache web server as a <b>protected</b> <b>service.</b> Results demonstrate MON nodes introduce very small overhead, while users' service access time increases by a factor of 1. 1 to 1. 7, depending on the configuration.

40|$|Abstract- The {{problem of}} {{automatic}} provisioning of surviv-able service paths in a transport {{network in the}} face of ran-dom arrivals and departures, and fundamental traffic uncer-tainty, is a challenging and interesting problem for research. Essentially to date, only one basic approach is considered, that of provisioning a working path and then explicitly arranging a shared disjoint backup path for protection. This is done on every new connection arrival and is heavily dependent on syn-chronized network state databases and state dissemination to keep such databases current. We describe an alternate ap-proach to simplify the process of automatic survivable service provisioning scheme from the end users point of view. Under an Adaptive Protected Working Capacity Envelope (AP-WCE), statistically stationary but random demand patterns require little or no state dissemination and <b>protected</b> <b>service</b> routing is no different than shortest path working routing. But under non-stationary evolution of the traffic load both spa-tially and temporally, a slow-acting background process of APWCE reoptimization occurs which keeps the logical con-figuration of both working envelope and protection overlay always as well matched to the actual traffic load pattern as possible within the finite amount of total as-built transmission capacity. The scheme is attractive as it is easlly implemented by existing network control systems and Is Inherently more scalable to large networks and fast random demands than the current shared-backup scheme because no signalling or state update relating to protection is required on the timescale of individual connection requests. Any such signalling arises only on the timescale of the non-stationary evolution of the traffic load pattern itself.

40|$|The {{most recent}} {{studies by the}} Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and the {{aviation}} industry have indicated {{that it has become}} increasingly difficult to make new VHF frequency or channel assignments to meet the aviation needs for air-ground communications. FAA has planned for several aggressive improvement measures to the existing systems, but these measures would not meet the projected voice communications needs beyond 2009. FAA found that since 1974 there has been, on the average, a 4 percent annual {{increase in the number of}} channel assignments needed to satisfy the air-ground communication traffic (approximately 300 new channel assignments per year). With the planned improvement measures, the channel assignments are expected to reach a maximum number of 16615 channels by about 2010. Hence, the FAA proposed the use of VDL Mode 3 as a new integrated digital voice and data communications systems to meet the future air traffic demand. This paper presents analytical results of frequency reuse; cell separation and capacity estimation of VDL Mode 3 TDMA systems that FAA has planned to implement the future VHF air-ground communications system by the year 2010. For TDMA, it is well understood that the frequency reuse factor is a crucial parameter for capacity estimation. Formulation of this frequency reuse factor is shown, taking into account the limitation imposed by the requirement to have a sufficient Signal to Co-Channel Interference Ratio. Several different values for the Signal to Co-Channel Interference Ratio were utilized corresponding to the current analog VHF DSB-AM systems, and the future digital VDL Mode 3. The required separation of Co-Channel cells is computed for most of the Frequency <b>Protected</b> <b>Service</b> Volumes (FPSV's) currently in use by the FAA. Additionally, the ideal cell capacity for each FPSV is presented. Also, using actual traffic for the Detroit air space, a FPSV traffic distribution model is used to generate a typical cell for channel capacity prediction. Such prediction is useful for evaluating the improvement of future VDL Mode 3 deployment and capacity planning...|$|E
