50|$|In 1870 at a by-election, Munster {{was elected}} as Liberal Member of Parliament for Mallow but {{shortly after he}} was {{unseated}} on petition, on account of bribery by his agent. Munster lived at Abbey View, Cashel, Tipperary. In 1884 Munster was involved in an unusual case concerning <b>privilege</b> <b>against</b> <b>disclosure</b> after he was libelled in The Brightonian. The publisher had sought information from his solicitor on how {{to commit a crime}} to avoid payment, and the solicitor was called in as a prosecution witness when the scam was discovered. Munster died at Plumpton, East Sussex at the age of 70.|$|E
50|$|The {{question}} presented {{was whether}} a university enjoys a special privilege, grounded {{either in the}} common law or the First Amendment, against disclosure of peer review materials {{that are relevant to}} charge or racial or sexual discrimination in tenure decisions. The University argued for recognition of a common law <b>privilege</b> <b>against</b> <b>disclosure</b> of confidential peer review materials, and for a First Amendment right of academic freedom against disclosure of the documents. In either case, the University sought a requirement of judicial finding of particularized necessity of access, beyond showing of mere relevance, before peer review materials could be disclosed to the EEOC.|$|E

The privilege applies only in proceedings in which the one asserting the privilege is not a party.

5000|$|By contrast, an [...] "employed" [...] {{barrister}} is a barrister {{who works}} as an employee within a larger organisation, either in the public or private sector. For example, employed barristers work within government departments or agencies (such as the Crown Prosecution Service), the legal departments of companies, {{and in some cases}} for firms of solicitors. Employed barristers will typically be paid a salary, and in most circumstances may do work only on behalf of their employer, rather than accepting instructions on behalf of third parties (such as their employers' customers). They remain subject to the Bar Council's Code of Professional Conduct, and their advice is entitled to professional <b>privilege</b> <b>against</b> <b>disclosure.</b>|$|E
50|$|The Presidential and Federal Records Act Amendments of 2014 would, {{in section}} 2, amend the Presidential Records Act {{to require the}} Archivist of the United States, upon {{determining}} to make publicly available any presidential record not previously made available, to: (1) promptly provide written notice of such determination to the former President during whose term of office the record was created, to the incumbent President, and to the public; and (2) make such record {{available to the public}} within 60 days, except any record with respect to which the Archivist receives notification from a former or incumbent President of a claim of constitutionally-based <b>privilege</b> <b>against</b> <b>disclosure.</b> Prohibits the Archivist from making a record that is subject to such a claim publicly available unless: (1) the incumbent President withdraws a decision upholding the claim, or (2) the Archivist is otherwise directed to do so by a final court order that is not subject to appeal.|$|E
50|$|In {{regard to}} the contention, that Article 74(2) bars the inquiry into advice was {{tendered}} by Council of Ministers to the President, the Supreme Court at length considered the scope and effect of Article 74(2). Here {{it would be appropriate}} to mention that article 74(2) of the constitution provides that the court cannot inquire as to any, and if so what, advice was tendered by Council of Ministers to the President. In this regard Supreme Court held that although Article 74(2) bars judicial review so far as the advice given by the Ministers is concerned, it does not bar scrutiny of the material on the basis of which the advice is given. The material on the basis of which advice was tendered does not become part of the advice. The Courts are justified in probing as to whether there was any material on the basis of which the advice was given, and whether it was relevant for such advice and the President could have acted on it. Hence when the Courts undertake an inquiry into the existence of such material, the prohibition contained in Article 74(2) does not negate their right to know about the factual existence of any such material. This {{is not to say that}} the Union Government cannot raise the plea of privilege under Section 123 of the Evidence Act. As and when such <b>privilege</b> <b>against</b> <b>disclosure</b> is claimed, the Courts will examine such claim within the parameters of the said section on its merits. But Article 74(2) as such is no bar to the power of judicial review regarding the material on the basis of which the proclamation is issued.|$|E

40|$|Pursuant to {{the finding}} of the {{constitutional}} court in Shabalala v Attorney-General of Transvaal (1995 2 SACR 761 (CC)) that the blanket docket privilege in criminal cases as enunciated in R v Steyn (1954 1 SA 324 (A)) was inconsistent {{with the right to}} a fair trial as guaranteed by the 1993 constitution (interim constitution), courts have been called upon to adjudicate on a number of questions that arose in relation to the prosecution’s duty to disclose. This was to be expected, as the constitutional court emphasized that, should the state object to disclosure, each individual case had to be decided on its own merits with reference to the guidelines provided in this regard by the constitutional court (par 55). In this contribution the initial objections raised in the Shabalala case in support of the <b>privilege</b> <b>against</b> <b>disclosure</b> are again briefly considered and evaluated, where possible with the knowledge of hindsight, to establish whether or not the notions that informed the objections indeed manifested themselves {{to the detriment of the}} criminal justice system. Consideration is given to the state’s approach to disclosure, the duty to disclose as interpreted by the courts in two recent decisions and the question is posed to what extent, if at all, the prosecution’s duty to disclose is utilized for purposes other than to ensure a fair trial. The extent to which the Criminal Procedure Act 51 of 1977 (the act) and the Promotion of Access to Information Act 2 of 2000 (PAIA) contain provisions, in addition to the state’s duty to disclose, to assist an accused person to obtain sufficient information in order to advance his case is also considered...|$|E
40|$|This article first {{will explain}} the reasons behind and goals of state {{recoupment}} actions against the major cigarette manufacturers, their lobbying arm and trade association, and their public relations firms (collectively {{referred to as the}} "tobacco industry") for the recovery of Medicaid and other indigent care expenditures on smoking-related illnesses. These are, primarily, to relieve the heavy financial burden on state treasuries and to stop the tobacco industry from targeting children in advertising and promotions. To put this new legal approach in perspective, the article presents a brief historical background to the tobacco industry's litigation strategy: to wear down opponents through delay and intimidation, to cast doubt on science, and to wrongfully invoke the attorney-client <b>privilege</b> <b>against</b> <b>disclosure</b> of incriminating evidence. Next authors discuss the states' strategy: each filing one suit seeking equitable remedies under theories of restitution/unjust enrichment, indemnity, public nuisance, and injunctive relief to protect the interests of minors, instead of maintaining thousands of product liability claims on behalf of individual smokers. This will be followed by a critique of the industry's response to state actions: political attacks against attorneys general and trial lawyers and charges that the lawsuits would hurt business as well as a variety of legal challenges, including an imaginative but risky defense that if smoking indeed causes disease and attendant health care expenditures, then the tobacco industry ought to be given a credit against those expenditures for the taxes generated by its business and the "savings" which inure to the states from the premature deaths of smokers (the cost of geriatric care, for example). The article will wrap up by impressing on health officials and other readers what is at stake in these actions and what their success or failure will mean for the Medicaid program...|$|E

40|$|The {{research}} {{topic of}} {{this doctoral dissertation}} is the <b>privilege</b> <b>against</b> self-incrimination of corporations. The issue is highly relevant {{in view of the}} importance of corporations in society and the increasing use of corporate criminal liability. The research and theory on the substantive criteria of the criminal responsibility of corporations is not paralleled by corresponding research into the fair trial rights of corporations as criminal defendants. Therefore this doctoral dissertation aims at providing a thorough analysis of the <b>privilege</b> <b>against</b> self-incrimination of corporations. The research is conducted along two lines: on the one hand, the dissertation analyses the origin, ratio and scope of the <b>privilege</b> <b>against</b> self-incrimination from a European perspective {{as well as from the}} perspective of three selected national systems (Belgium, England and Wales and the United States of America). On the other hand, it encompasses both theoretical and practical considerations. The central research question that is addressed throughout the research is: Does the <b>privilege</b> <b>against</b> self-incrimination apply to corporations, should it apply to corporations, and if so, to what extent? The research provides a tentative framework for the <b>privilege</b> <b>against</b> self-incrimination of corporations, and indicates whether and how it should apply to corporations. In doing so, the dissertation wants to make a meaningful contribution to the more general debate on the entitlement of corporations to fair trial rights. nrpages: 363 status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|While {{recognized}} {{in a large}} number of jurisdictions, the <b>privilege</b> <b>against</b> self-incrimination proves hard to justify. This article attempts to develop a rationale for the privilege which avoids the usual pitfalls. It argues that the most compelling rationale for the privilege is that it serves as a distancing mechanism, allowing defendants to disassociate themselves from prosecutions. The resulting account has implications for the scope of the privilege. First, it suggests that no distinction should be drawn between requirements to speak and requirements to provide the authorities with documents, blood samples and the like. Second, it is argued that recognition of a <b>privilege</b> <b>against</b> self-incrimination implies that we should recognize a <b>privilege</b> <b>against</b> other incrimination which has similar force. Attention is also paid to exceptions to the privilege...|$|R

40|$|This Article {{examines}} {{the application of}} the Fifth Amendment <b>privilege</b> <b>against</b> self-incrimination to compelled disclosure of unencrypted data. Such disclosure can include provision of passwords to access encrypted data as well as, increasingly, providing unencrypted data after compelled decryption. The pervasiveness and persistence of electronic data drastically increases the availability of information with potential evidentiary value that has not previously existed with physical evidence. The courts have struggled with finding the appropriate balance in determining the scope and applicability of the <b>privilege</b> <b>against</b> self-incrimination to electronic evidence. The lack of precise physical world analogues to encryption has led to particular difficulties in this regard. I argue that encrypted data deserves broader consideration under the Fifth Amendment than heretofore established by relevant precedent.
