5|$|After killing Yeates, Tabak {{attempted}} to cast suspicion {{for the murder}} onto Jefferies after watching a news broadcast about the case while spending the New Year with relatives in the Netherlands. He contacted Avon and Somerset Police {{to tell them that}} Jefferies had been using his car on the night of 17 December, and a CID officer, DC Karen Thomas, was sent to Amsterdam to talk to him. They met at Amsterdam Schiphol Airport on 31 December, where Tabak elaborated on his story, but Thomas grew suspicious of his interest in the forensic work being carried out by the police and because what he said did not concur with a <b>previous</b> <b>statement.</b>|$|E

Its headquarters were searched by the French tax police on April 5, 2016 as the bank was linked {{with the creation of}} 979 offshore companies. In 2012, CEO Frédéric Oudéa said that Société Générale withdrew from all countries belonging to the grey list of tax havens compiled by the OECD, including Panama. Despite this <b>previous</b> <b>statement,</b> Mr Oudéa defended that those offshore companies were not meant to be used as tax evasion vehicles.|$|E

The announcement followed a <b>previous</b> <b>statement</b> from the player declaring his intention to retire from international duty. Larsson had also stated his desire to move into coaching and expressed his intent to study for coaching badges in Scotland under the Scottish Football Association system. The announcement quickly sparked rumours of a return to Celtic as manager, even going so far as to suggest a link-up with former Celtic teammate Ľubomír Moravčík as his assistant. Larsson also discussed the possibility of taking up floorball on a full-time basis.|$|E

25|$|The {{movement}} of blood through {{the human body}} {{was thought to be}} known due to the work of the Greek physicians. However, there was the question of how the blood flowed from the right ventricle of the heart to the left ventricle, before the blood is pumped {{to the rest of the}} body. According to Galen in the 2nd century, blood reached the left ventricle through invisible passages in the septum. By some means, Ibn al-Nafis, a 13th-century Syrian physician, found the <b>previous</b> <b>statement</b> on blood flow from the right ventricle to the left to be false. Ibn al-Nafis discovered that the ventricular septum was impenetrable, lacking any type of invisible passages, showing Galen's assumptions to be false. Ibn al-Nafis discovered that the blood in the right ventricle of the heart is instead carried to the left by way of the lungs. This discovery was one of the first descriptions of the pulmonary circulation, although his writings on the subject were only rediscovered in the 20th century, and it was William Harvey's later independent discovery which brought it to general attention.|$|E

500|$|Alberti opines that, {{rather than}} denying All in the Familys {{influence}} on The Simpsons, the series writers [...] "mockingly embrace it" [...] by having Homer visually likened to Bunker {{as he sits}} on his chair.

[...] In an {{interview}} later that year, with Soap Opera Weekly, he grimaced when reminded of what he had said, and commented, [...] "What a totally self-involved, pretentious thing to say." [...] He clarified his <b>previous</b> <b>statement,</b> saying that although he seemed to be consistently cast as a [...] "bad guy" [...] and as a [...] "Greek frat brother-type", both his upbringing and experiences in college were different than those of Todd and his other roles. [...] For example, Howarth was not in a fraternity in college, and, unlike Todd and his previous soap opera roles, Kent in Loving and Jory on Guiding Light, status was unimportant to him.|$|E

You can't. I wouldn't wish that experience on anyone else, but it was very, very, very educational for me and has informed my proclivities and politics ever since."

Tisdale titled the album Headstrong, because she calls herself a [...] "headstrong" [...] type of person, commenting that she was the term in the sense of knowing how she wants to look, sing, and come across.

500|$|On {{the last}} day of April, Rockefeller {{announced}} that he would campaign for the presidency, despite his <b>previous</b> <b>statement</b> to the contrary. Immediately following his entrance, he defeated Nixon in the Massachusetts primary 30% to 26%. New Harris polls found that Rockefeller fared better against Democratic candidates than Nixon, but the outlook started to appear better for Nixon after he won the Indiana primary over Rockefeller. Off the victory, Nixon campaigned in Nebraska where he criticized the three leading Democratic candidates as [...] "three peas in a pod, prisoners of the policies of the past." [...] He then proposed a plan to tackle crime that included wiretapping, legislation to reverse previous Supreme Court decisions, and the formation of a congressional committee targeting crime and reforms to the criminal justice system. He did not connect crime to racial rioting, drawing praise from Civil Rights leaders. Nixon won the primary in Nebraska, defeating the undeclared Reagan 71% to 22%. At the following primary in Oregon, Reagan seemed more willing to compete with Nixon, and Rockefeller sat out. But Nixon won with 72%, fifty points ahead of Reagan.|$|E

500|$|The {{announcement}} dominated {{television and}} newspapers; Ferraro was besieged by {{questions regarding the}} finances as well as criticism for ethnic stereotyping. As she later wrote, [...] "I had created a monster." [...] Republicans saw her finances as a [...] "genderless" [...] issue that they could attack Ferraro with without creating a backlash, and some Mondale staffers thought Ferraro might {{have to leave the}} ticket. The Philadelphia Inquirer went even further in its investigations, seeking to link Zaccaro to organized crime figures, but most publishers avoided this topic and law enforcement officials did not treat the allegations with much seriousness. A week after her <b>previous</b> <b>statement,</b> Ferraro said Zaccaro had changed his mind and would indeed release his tax records, which was done on [...] The full statements included notice of payment of some $53,000 in back federal taxes that she owed due to what was described as an accountant's error. Ferraro said the statements proved overall that she had nothing to hide and that there had been no financial wrongdoing. The disclosures indicated that Ferraro and her husband were worth nearly $4million, had a full-time maid, and owned a boat and the two vacation homes. Much of their wealth was tied up in real estate rather than being disposable income, but the disclosures hurt Ferraro's image as a rags-to-riches story.|$|E
500|$|The {{morning after}} the broadcast, several tabloid {{newspapers}} attacked the documentary, accusing it of sensationalism and [...] "trial by television". In the following days, they mounted a campaign against Carmen Proetta, one of the documentary's main witnesses, accusing her of being a former prostitute and of being anti-British; Proetta later successfully sued several newspapers for libel. Other newspapers accused [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] of misrepresenting the eyewitnesses' statements and criticised the IBA for allowing the documentary to be broadcast. The eyewitnesses interviewed for [...] "Death on the Rock" [...] gave evidence at the inquest into the shootings; most repeated the statements they had given the programme, but one witness—who had told the programme {{he had seen a}} soldier stand over one of the IRA members and fire at the man while he was on the ground—retracted his <b>previous</b> <b>statement.</b> As a result of the retraction, Thames commissioned an independent inquiry into the making of [...] "Death on the Rock"—the first time an inquiry had been commissioned into the making of an individual documentary. The Windlesham–Rampton report found that the programme's tendency was to present evidence that the IRA members had been unlawfully killed, but that it sought to raise questions rather than to reach a conclusion. The authors made several criticisms of the documentary, but overall found it a [...] "trenchant" [...] work of journalism, made in [...] "good faith and without ulterior motives". Thames lost its franchise and the IBA was abolished {{as a result of the}} Broadcasting Act 1990—decisions which several involved parties believed were influenced by the government's anger at [...] "Death on the Rock".|$|E
500|$|The reveal of Tracer being canonically lesbian was {{generally}} well-received by media outlets and players alike. USgamer called it [...] "an impressive move for Blizzard, given that Tracer is their flagship character". Polygons Allegra Frank described the reveal as one [...] "that fans have waited a long, long time for". Peter Amato of Paste commented, [...] "While a vocal minority has made their disapproval of said announcement clear, the larger fan base's reaction has ranged from indifferent to cheering." [...] Kotaku had {{several of its}} writers react to the reveal, with the consensus being a positive reception. The publication's Cecilia D'Anastasio pointed to a <b>previous</b> <b>statement</b> from Blizzard, where the developers clarified their intention to have an LGBT character reveal play out organically, [...] commenting: [...] "I feel that the comic did that. Tracer buys her partner a scarf. Her partner likes it. They kiss. The comic moves on. I think it was handled quite well, {{although the idea of}} Blizzard announcing a queer character feels sort of.... gimmicky." [...] Gita Jackson concurred with D'Anastasio stating she [...] "was definitely concerned that revealing a queer character would come off as a gimmick, and [...] very pleased at how they pulled this off. This doesn't feel tokenized." [...] Fellow Kotaku writer Heather Alexandra commented, [...] "I think having something explicit was necessary [...] Having something definite gives queer players a proper point of contact." [...] Andy Chalk of PC Gamer noted that: ...the comic itself is a fairly straightforward heartwarming tale of what really matters during the most hectic season of all. But the reaction to Tracer's identity has been anything but. Messages decrying Blizzard's [...] "mistake" [...] have cropped up all over the Overwatch forums and other social media, countered by others praising the studio for explicitly stating—in a low-key fashion—that the face of one of the biggest games of the year is gay.|$|E
