In this paper, the kinetics and capacity of hydrogen desorption from Mg-based alloys have markedly been enhanced by tuning the surface composition of alloy particles. Mg 2 Ni-Ct,x composites (where t refers to the <b>pregrinding</b> time and x to the Brunauer-Emmet-Teller specific surface area) were prepared by ball-milling the alloy {{in the presence of}} preground graphite, and Pd-coated Mg 2 Ni alloy powders were obtained by controlled chemical deposition of Pd on the alloy surface. We have found that the optimization of the <b>pregrinding</b> step of carbon is a determinant factor in enhancing the hydrogen desorption capacity of the Mg 2 Ni- 10 wt. % C 10, 320 composites to 2. 6 wt. % at 150 Â°C, the maximum performance so far reported on desorption for Mg-based alloys. Such value can even be raised to 2. 8 wt. % by applying Pd deposition on the composite...|$|E

The porous {{texture of the}} prepared carbon materials was studied by means of N 2 and CO 2 adsorption isotherms measured at 196 C and 0 C, respectively. Comparison with nanoporous carbons obtained without <b>pregrinding</b> the sucrose-derived char [12] shows that the ball milling procedure favours the formation of highly microporous carbon materials even at low KOH loadings, having a beneficial effect {{of the interaction between}} the char particles and the activating agent. Hydrogen adsorption isotherms at 196 C were measured in the 0. 0 e 1. 1 MPa pressure range, and amaximumhydrogen adsorption capacity of 3. 4 wt. %was obtained for theamorphous carbon prepared by activation at 900 C with a KOH/char weight ratio of 2. Finally, a linear dependence was found between the maximumhydrogen uptake at 1. 1 MPa and the samples microporous volume, confirming previous results obtained at 196 C and sub-atmospheric pressure [12...|$|E
