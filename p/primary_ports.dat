25|$|Originating {{primarily}} {{from what was}} known as the Bight of Biafra on the West African coast, Igbo people were taken in relatively high numbers to Jamaica {{as a result of the}} Transatlantic Slave Trade, beginning around 1750. The <b>primary</b> <b>ports</b> from which the majority of these enslaved people were taken from were Bonny and Calabar, two port towns that are now in south-eastern Nigeria. The slave ships arriving from Bristol and Liverpool delivered the slaves to British colonies including Jamaica. The bulk of enslaved Igbo people arrived relatively late, between 1790 and 1807. Jamaica, after Virginia, was the second most common disembarkation point for slave ships arriving from the Bight of Biafra.|$|E
25|$|Edgartown is {{well known}} as having {{been one of the}} <b>primary</b> <b>ports</b> for the whaling {{industry}} during the 1800s. Ships {{from all over the world}} would dock in its sheltered bay and captains would build grand mansions for their families with ornate top floor rooms called widow's walks, which overlooked the harbor. A myth developed that wives would watch for months from these tiny rooms, hoping to see the sails of ships that would bring their husbands home from the sea. There is little or no evidence that widow's walks were intended or regularly used for this purpose. They were frequently built around the chimney of the residence, thus creating an easy access route to the structure, allowing the residents of the home to pour sand down burning chimneys in the event of a chimney fire in the hopes of preventing the house from burning down.|$|E

2500|$|Carburetion {{had five}} {{separate}} circuits. Suzuki used peripheral ports for the RE5, as they give better high-speed running but {{are known to}} have low-speed issues. This is dealt with by using a two-stage Mikuni carburetor. An 18mm throat splits into two small peripheral induction tracts. The primary butterfly is directly controlled by one of the five throttle cables, providing smooth low-speed running. A diaphragm controls the secondary carburetor port, and this is activated when a set vacuum is reached in the carburetor circuit. This much larger 32mm port enters the rotor chamber between and slightly below the two small <b>primary</b> <b>ports.</b> Indirectly involved with carburetion is the unique [...] "port valve". This small butterfly valve pivots in the rotor housing inside the secondary port and is directly controlled by another of the throttle cables. Without the port valve, the long induction tract of the secondary port would fill with traces of exhaust gasses whenever the secondary valve was closed. This occurs as the tip of the rotor passes the induction port {{at the end of the}} exhaust cycle before beginning the induction cycle. If this was allowed to happen, when the secondary throat finally opened the engine would first swallow an induction charge contaminated with exhaust gasses causing a momentary misfire and felt as a dead spot or hesitation in acceleration. The port valve is therefore effectively timed to remain closed whenever the secondary carburetor throat is closed, isolating the induction tract from exhaust gasses. Carburetor tuning involves adjusting cables controlling the primary butterfly and the port valve, among other things, illustrated by Suzuki Service Bulletin Nine. The carburetor also incorporated a fuel pump which was mechanically actuated at 35 degrees of primary butterfly movemement (later changed to 28 degrees) to enrich the fuel mixture during acceleration.|$|E

50|$|A {{dual port}} {{wastegate}} adds a second port {{on the opposite}} side of the actuator. Air pressure allowed to enter this second port aids the spring to push harder in the direction of closing the wastegate. This is exactly the opposite of the first port. The ability to help the wastegate remain closed as boost pressure builds can be increased. This also adds further complexity to boost control, requiring more control ports on the solenoid or possibly a complete second boost control system with its own separate solenoid. Use of the second port is not necessary. Secondary ports, unlike <b>primary</b> <b>ports,</b> cannot be simply attached to a boost control line and require electronic or manual control to be useful. CO2 can also be used to apply pressure to the second port, to control boost on a much finer level.|$|E

50|$|During the Norman Conquest the De Brus family gained over-lordship of {{the land}} {{surrounding}} Hartlepool. William the Conqueror subsequently ordered the construction of Durham Castle, and the villages under their rule were mentioned in records in 1153 when Robert de Brus, 1st Lord of Annandale became Lord of Hartness. The town's first charter was received before 1185, for which it gained its first mayor, an annual two-week fair and a weekly market.By the Middle Ages Hartlepool was growing into an important (though still small) market town, {{one of the reasons}} for its escalating wealth being that its harbour was serving now as the official port of the County Palatine of Durham.
