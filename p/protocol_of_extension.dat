The approach we propose {{does not affect the}} syntax of the formal description technique and does not depend on the FDT used, but we illustrate our ideas using SDL and derive performance measures from a simulation or execution of the specification. In many cases we could equally well use Markov or queueing theory or other proposals in the literature. The problem of determining the values of the appropriate parameters in those cases remain however.

Our analysis suggests that rather than facilitating the Court’s adjudicatory function, extended advisory jurisdiction has the potential to impact on the Court’s constitutionalist function in a manner which can be better achieved through the Court’s contentious cases. The burden this procedure will place on the Court’s already overstretched resources would risk delays to contentious cases and potentially undermine judicial comity should requests for advisory opinions be declined. Furthermore, evidence of ‘constructive’ dialogue between highest national courts and the ECtHR is emerging in contentious cases without the need for an extended advisory opinions mechanism.
