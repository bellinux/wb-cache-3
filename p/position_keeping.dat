25|$|Custer {{began his}} flank attack when the 15th New York Cavalry began their {{attack on the}} front and swung his mounted brigades around the Confederate flank. Before Custer could seize a {{position}} behind Corse, Rooney Lee led the 2nd North Carolina Cavalry (19th State Troops) and 3rd North Carolina Cavalry (41st State Troops) in a counterattack. Lee's troopers held their <b>position,</b> <b>keeping</b> Custer from joining the Union forces moving west along the Confederate line. Covered by Rooney Lee's troopers from Barringer's brigade, McGregor's battery, many infantry, wagons and ambulances and Beale's cavalry brigade withdrew north of Hatcher's Run.|$|E
500|$|Narayan {{practices}} and teaches using {{a limited number}} of paltas, exercises in a small scale range that are used to prepare playing different numbers of notes per bow. Derived from paltas are lengthy note patterns called tans, which contain characteristic [...] "melodic shapes" [...] and are used by Narayan for fast playing. He uses his left (fingering) hand for runs and to play an extended melodic range, and his right (bowing) hand for rhythmic accentuations. Narayan's fingering technique, his low right hand <b>position,</b> <b>keeping</b> the bow in a close to right angle to the string, and his use of the full bow length are unusual among sarangi players.|$|E
25|$|In September of that year, Chun {{was elected}} {{president}} by indirect election and inaugurated in March of the following year, officially starting the 5th Republic. A new Constitution was established with notable changes; maintaining the presidential system but limiting it to a single 7-year term, strengthening {{the authority of the}} National Assembly, and conferring the responsibilities of appointing judiciary to the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. However, the system of indirect election of the president stayed and many military persons were appointed to highly ranked government <b>positions,</b> <b>keeping</b> the remnants of the Yushin era.|$|R
50|$|A reed {{is part of}} a loom, and {{resembles a}} comb. It is used to push the weft yarn {{securely}} into place as it is woven, it also separates the warp threads and holds them in their <b>positions,</b> <b>keeping</b> them untangled, and guides the shuttle as it moves across the loom. It consists of a frame with lots of vertical slits. The reed is securely held by the beater. Floor looms and mechanized looms both use a beater with a reed, whereas Inkle weaving and tablet weaving do not use reeds.|$|R

The adaptive nature of the method is governed by a dynamic split level that can adjust the algorithm to new camera <b>positions</b> <b>keeping</b> a well-balanced workload amongst the processors. Also this paper introduces the concept of n-dimensional resource space as a discrete Euclidean space. This work {{presents a}} simple and effective thread management system called MinTMS. 1...|$|R
2500|$|The {{other major}} {{difference}} with {{this system is}} that when contacted, the hose does not “retract” into an HDU. [...] Instead, the hose bends depending on how far it is pushed toward the boom. [...] If it is pushed too far, it can loop around the probe or nose of the aircraft, damage the windscreen, or cause contact with the rigid boom. [...] If not pushed far enough, the probe will disengage, halting fueling. [...] Because of a much smaller <b>position</b> <b>keeping</b> tolerance, staying properly connected to a KC-135 adapter unit is considerably more difficult than staying in a traditional hose/drogue configuration. [...] When fueling is complete, the receiver carefully backs off until the probe refueling valve disconnects from the valve in the basket. [...] Off center disengagements, like engagements, can cause the drogue to “prang” the probe and/or strike the aircraft’s fuselage.|$|E
2500|$|Butterfly save: On low shots, modern goaltenders usually {{work in the}} [...] "butterfly" [...] <b>position,</b> <b>keeping</b> {{their knees}} {{together}} and their stick covering their five-hole, or knee gap. A fairly new, more effective way of stopping low shots is to redirect the puck with the stick. The goalie does this by rotating their hips, their glove and stick square with the puck as they direct it to the corner {{to the left or}} right of them, depending on which side the puck is shot to, rather than kicking the puck way out of reach. The glove is kept up and out, ready for a possible deflection, and the goaltender is focused on the incoming shot. Goaltenders should keep both arms out in front of them at all times, covering the gaps between the goaltender's arms and body (sometimes called the 7 and 11 holes), and making it easier to direct rebounds with the stick and blocker.|$|E

5000|$|In April 2002 the CIA had {{captured}} its first important prisoner, Abu Zabaydah, who {{was transferred to}} a CIA black site and {{at the suggestion of}} psychologist James Mitchell the CIA embarked on interrogation methods which included sleep deprivation using bright lights and loud music—still prior to any legal authorization from the US Justice Department. [...] Later that April Dr. Mitchell proposed a list of additional tactics, including locking people in cramped boxes, shackling them in painful <b>positions,</b> <b>keeping</b> them awake for a week at a time, covering them with insects, and waterboarding, a practice which the United States had previously characterized in war crimes prosecutions as torture.|$|R

60|$|Having {{placed his}} army within {{striking}} distance of the various passages across the Tugela, Sir Redvers Buller's next object was to cross and debouch. To this end his plan appears to have been--for information is scarcely yet properly codified--something as follows: Lyttelton's Brigade, the corps troops forming Coke's Brigade, the ten naval guns, the battery of howitzers, one field battery, and Bethune's Mounted Infantry to demonstrate in front of the Potgieter <b>position,</b> <b>keeping</b> the Boers holding the horseshoe in expectation of a frontal attack, and masking their main position; Sir Charles Warren to march by night from Springfield with the brigades of Hart, Woodgate, and Hildyard, the Royal Dragoons, six batteries of artillery, and the pontoon train to a point about five miles west of Spearman's Hill, and opposite Trichardt's Drift on the Tugela. Here he was to meet the mounted forces from Spearman's Hill, and with these troops he was next day, the 17th, to throw bridges, force the passage of the river, and operate at leisure and discretion against the right flank of the enemy's horseshoe before Potgieter's, resting on Spion Kop, a commanding mountain, ultimately joining hands with the frontal force from Spearman's Hill at a point on the Acton Homes-Ladysmith road. To sum up briefly, seven battalions, twenty-two guns, and three hundred horse under Lyttelton to mask the Potgieter position; twelve battalions, thirty-six guns, and sixteen hundred horse to cross five miles to the westward, and make a turning movement against the enemy's right. The Boer covering army was to be swept back on Ladysmith by a powerful left arm, the pivoting shoulder of which was at Potgieter's, the elbow at Trichardt's Drift, and the enveloping hand--the cavalry under Lord Dundonald--stretching out towards Acton Homes.|$|E
