5|$|Enron's {{aggressive}} accounting <b>practices</b> <b>were</b> not {{hidden from}} the board of directors, as later learned by a Senate subcommittee. The board was informed of the rationale for using the Whitewing, LJM, and Raptor transactions, and after approving them, received status updates on the entities' operations. Although not all of Enron's widespread improper accounting <b>practices</b> <b>were</b> revealed to the board, the <b>practices</b> <b>were</b> dependent on board decisions. Even though Enron extensively relied on derivatives for its business, the company's Finance Committee and board {{did not have enough}} experience with derivatives to understand what they were being told. The Senate subcommittee argued that had there been a detailed understanding of how the derivatives were organized, the board would have prevented their use.|$|E

5|$|Evidence from {{excavated}} Liao burial sites {{indicates that}} animistic or shamanistic <b>practices</b> <b>were</b> fused with Buddhism and other practices in marriage and burial ceremonies. Both animal and human sacrifices {{have been found}} in Liao tombs, alongside indications of Buddhist practice. Indications of Daoist, zodiac, and Zoroastrian influences have also been found in Liao burial sites.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study <b>was</b> to examine <b>practice</b> {{scheduling}} and composition in judo based upon motor learning theory. Practice scheduling and composition of Jiyu-renshu, Kakari-renshu, and Yakusokurenshu were analyzed from the case of the practice of A University judo team. A University judo team has a competitive level of participating in the national collegiate judo tournament. The viewpoints of analysis by motor learning theory were massed and distributed practice, random and blocked practice, whole and part practice, and variable and constant practice. Results demonstrated as follows. Massed and distributed practice, and Random and blocked <b>practice</b> <b>were</b> scheduled in Jiyu-renshu, Kakari-renshu, and Yakusoku-renshu. Whole <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu and Yakusoku-renshu by fractionation, while part <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu, Kakari-renshu, and Yakusoku-renshu. Whole <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu by simplification, while part <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu, Kakarirenshu, and Yakusoku-renshu. Whole <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu and Yakusoku-renshu by segmentation, while part <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Kakari-renshu, and Yakusoku-renshu. Variable and constant <b>practice</b> <b>was</b> composed in Jiyu-renshu, Kakari-renshu, and Yakusoku-renshu. Specific training methods were proposed for each practice...|$|R

5|$|According to Procopius, the Slavs {{believed}} in one god, {{the creator of}} lightning and master of the entire universe, to whom all sacrificial animals (and sometimes people) were offered. The highest god was called Svarog throughout the Slavic area, but other gods were also worshiped in different regions at different times, often with local names. Natural objects such as rivers, groves or mountains were also celebrated, as well as nymphs, demons, ancestral and other spirits, who were all venerated and bought off with offering rituals, which also involved augury. Such beliefs and <b>practices</b> <b>were</b> later developed and individualized by the many Slavic tribes.|$|E

5|$|Following birth it was common, {{particularly}} among richer families, {{to employ a}} wet-nurse {{to care for the}} child, sometimes living in with the family. Few sources give an insight into the experiences of young children in this period. Some parents played with their children and parents demonstrated grief at their loss. The primary responsibility for bringing up young children fell on the mother. For older children, the major duty of parents was, according to the Kirk, to ensure the spiritual development of the child, with fathers leading daily family prayers, {{but it is not clear}} how widely these <b>practices</b> <b>were</b> adopted.|$|E
5|$|Friendly {{generally}} {{approved of}} the first version but {{believed that it was}} necessary to include information on same-sex sexual practices. When those <b>practices</b> <b>were</b> explained to him, however, he changed his mind. While the documentary was still in production, Friendly was promoted to the presidency of CBS News but left soon after over a disagreement over the network's coverage of the Vietnam War. He was replaced by Richard S. Salant, who was known for his cost-consciousness, which put the future of the documentary and the CBS Reports series in question.|$|E

5|$|If {{traditional}} <b>practices</b> <b>were</b> adhered to, feasting {{would have}} continued for two days, while guests {{would have given}} gifts, mainly of money, to the newlyweds. The wedding ceremony would have culminated with the guests entering the bridal chamber, where they would have made various sexual references and innuendos, led by a figure with his face painted black. In Chinese rural tradition, the bride was expected to show the bloodstains on the bed sheets from her wedding night to prove that her hymen had been broken during sexual intercourse, {{and that she had}} therefore been a virgin.|$|E
5|$|In 1969, when a {{large chunk}} of stone fell from a statue near the main door, it became {{apparent}} that there was an urgent need for restoration of the west front. Detailed studies of the stonework and of conservation <b>practices</b> <b>were</b> undertaken under the cathedral architect, Alban D. R. Caroe and a restoration committee formed. The methods that were selected for conservation were those devised by Eve and Robert Baker. W. A. (Bert) Wheeler, clerk of works to the cathedral 1935–1978, had previously experimented with washing and surface-treatment of architectural carvings on the building and his techniques were among those tried on the statues.|$|E
5|$|Parseghian {{quickly turned}} things around in 1964, re-establishing {{a sense of}} {{confidence}} and team spirit that had been lost under Kuharich and Devore. <b>Practices</b> <b>were</b> carefully planned and organized {{with the help of}} a coaching staff that consisted of three assistants from Northwestern and four former Notre Dame players. Parseghian listened to players' concerns about the program and addressed them. He updated the team's offense by favoring passing and bringing in smaller and quicker players. A rule change allowing unlimited substitutions starting in 1964 helped make this strategy successful; fast-running receivers could now be taken out of the game and rested as others replaced them.|$|E

5|$|Rigveda, however, {{does not}} {{describe}} yoga {{and there is}} little evidence as to what the <b>practices</b> <b>were.</b> Early references to practices that later became part of yoga, are made in Brihadaranyaka Upanishad, the earliest Hindu Upanishad. For example, the practice of pranayama (consciously regulating breath) is mentioned in hymn 1.5.23 of Brihadaranyaka Upanishad (c. 900 BCE), and the practice of pratyahara (concentrating all of one's senses on self) is mentioned in hymn 8.15 of Chandogya Upanishad (c. 800–700 BCE).|$|E
5|$|The Spanish left a deep mark on Texas. Their European {{livestock}} caused mesquite {{to spread}} inland while farmers tilled and irrigated the land, changing the landscape forever. The Spanish language provided the names {{for many of}} the rivers, towns, and counties that currently exist, and Spanish architectural concepts still flourish. Although Texas eventually adopted much of the Anglo-American legal system, many Spanish legal <b>practices</b> <b>were</b> retained, including the concept of a homestead exemption and community property.|$|E
5|$|The {{trend towards}} more {{intensive}} farming {{began to be}} partially reversed {{by the end of}} the century as more environmentally friendly <b>practices</b> <b>were</b> encouraged by government and European Union grants. For example, Richard Zawadzki, owner of Balfour Mains (the largest farm on the island), ceased to breed livestock (instead keeping animals bred elsewhere) and grew less grain (some barley is still grown on the farm). Instead, some of the land is now managed under a Habitat Creation Scheme, which aims to encourage natural vegetation, wild flowers and nesting birds by limiting grazing and reducing the use of chemical fertilisers.|$|E

5|$|Although Texas {{eventually}} adopted {{much of the}} Anglo-American legal system, many Spanish legal <b>practices</b> <b>were</b> retained. Among {{these was}} the Spanish model of keeping certain personal property safe from creditors. Texas implemented the first homestead exemption in the United States in 1839, and its property exemption laws are now the most liberal state in the United States. Furthermore, Spanish law maintained that both husband and wife should share equally in the profits of marriage, and, like many other former Spanish provinces, Texas retained the idea of community property rather than use the Anglo laws in which all property belonged to the husband. Furthermore, Spanish law allowed an independent executor to be named in probate cases who {{is not required to}} gain court permission for each act not explicitly listed in the testament. Texas retained this idea, and it has eventually spread to other states, included Arizona, Washington, and Idaho. In other legal matters, Texas kept the Spanish principle of adoption, becoming the first U.S. state to allow adoption.|$|E
5|$|Birth control <b>practices</b> <b>were</b> {{generally}} adopted {{earlier in}} Europe {{than in the}} United States. Knowlton's book was reprinted in 1877 in England by Charles Bradlaugh and Annie Besant, {{with the goal of}} challenging Britain's obscenity laws. They were arrested (and later acquitted) but the publicity of their trial contributed to the formation, in 1877, of the Malthusian League– the world's first birth control advocacy group– which sought to limit population growth to avoid Thomas Malthus's dire predictions of exponential population growth leading to worldwide poverty and famine. By 1930, similar societies had been established in nearly all European countries, and birth control began to find acceptance in most Western European countries, except Catholic Ireland, Spain, and France. As the birth control societies spread across Europe, so did birth control clinics. The first birth control clinic in the world was established in the Netherlands in 1882, run by the Netherlands' first female physician, Aletta Jacobs. The first birth control clinic in England was established in 1921 by Marie Stopes, in London.|$|E

Tri-State Homes began managing housing. In 1946, tenants were permitted to paint their houses in different colors from the wartime olive drab. Comprehensive medical insurance, originally instituted for security reasons, was replaced with policies from the Provident Life and Accident Insurance Company. Health care had been provided by the Army. As Army doctors were separated from the service they were replaced with civilian doctors employed by Roane-Anderson.
