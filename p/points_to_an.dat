5|$|An allocator, A, for {{objects of}} type T {{must have a}} member {{function}} with the signature A::pointer A::allocate(size_type n, A::const_pointer hint = 0). This function returns a pointer to the first element of a newly allocated array large enough to contain n objects of type T; only the memory is allocated, and the objects are not constructed. Moreover, an optional pointer argument (that <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> object already allocated by A) {{can be used as}} a hint to the implementation about where the new memory should be allocated in order to improve locality. However, the implementation is free to ignore the argument.|$|E

30|$|From Fig.  4 a, it {{is found}} that the maximum {{eigenvector}} of the gravity gradient tensor <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> high-density causative body if the body is embedded in the low-density medium. In this case, the minimum eigenvector of the tensor <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the low-density medium around the high-density body. On the other hand, the minimum eigenvector of the gravity gradient tensor <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> low-density causative body if the body is embedded in the high-density medium. In this case, the maximum eigenvector of the tensor <b>points</b> <b>to</b> the high-density medium around the low-density body. From these results, in the two-dimensional analyses, it was shown that the maximum eigenvector <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> high-density causative body and the minimum eigenvectors <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> low-density causative body.|$|R
5|$|Joint {{attention}} or shared attention is the shared focus of two individuals on an object. It is achieved when one individual alerts another to an object {{by means of}} eye-gazing, pointing or other verbal or non-verbal indications. An individual gazes at another individual, <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> object and then returns their gaze to the individual. Scaife and Bruner were the first researchers to present a cross-sectional description of children's ability to follow eye gaze in 1975. They found that most eight- to ten-month-old children followed a line of regard, and that all 11- to 14-month-old children did so. This early research showed {{it was possible for}} an adult to bring certain objects in the environment to an infant's attention using eye gaze.|$|E
5|$|Many modern {{scholars}} {{question the}} idea that Jesus was born in Bethlehem, seeing the biblical stories not as historical accounts but as symbolic narratives invented to present the birth as fulfillment of prophecy and imply {{a connection to the}} lineage of King David. The Gospel of Mark and the Gospel of John do not include a nativity narrative, but refer to him only as being from Nazareth. In a 2005 article in Archaeology magazine, archaeologist Aviram Oshri <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> absence of evidence for the settlement of Bethlehem near Jerusalem at the time when Jesus was born, and postulates that Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Galilee. In a 2011 article in Biblical Archaeology Review magazine, Jerome Murphy-O'Connor argues for the traditional position that Jesus was born in Bethlehem near Jerusalem.|$|E
5|$|Taiwanese aborigines are Austronesian peoples, with {{linguistic}} and genetic ties to other Austronesian ethnic groups, such as {{peoples of the}} Philippines, Malaysia, Madagascar and Oceania. Chipped-pebble tools dating from perhaps as early as 15,000 years ago suggest that the initial human inhabitants of Taiwan were Paleolithic cultures of the Pleistocene era. These people survived by eating marine life. Archaeological evidence <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> abrupt change to the Neolithic era around 6,000years ago, {{with the advent of}} agriculture, domestic animals, polished stone adzes and pottery. The stone adzes were mass-produced on Penghu and nearby islands, from the volcanic rock found there. This suggests heavy sea traffic took place between these islands and Taiwan at this time.|$|E

If a party goes for baunie but loses a later trick, then {{it is only a}} single win of 2 points.|$|R

25|$|Shape {{analysis}} of linked list data structures {{is a technique}} for verifying the correctness of an algorithm using those structures. If a node in the list incorrectly <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> earlier node in the same list, the structure will form a cycle that can be detected by these algorithms. In Common Lisp, the S-expression printer, under control of the *print-circle* variable, detects circular list structure and prints it compactly.|$|E
25|$|The {{specific}} {{immune response}} is active later in infection and involves both B cells and T cells. Severe sporotrichosis is rare in endemic areas where humans are in near constant contact with S. schenckii spores. This fact, combined with the increased severity of disease in immunocompromised patients <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> important role for specific immunity in S. schenckii infection. Patients with sporotrichosis {{have been shown to}} produce antibodies specific to S. schenckii and these antibodies may actually be protective against the disease.|$|E

25|$|Many linguists, however, tend {{to favor}} the theory that {{speakers}} of Dravidian languages spread southwards and eastwards through the Indian subcontinent, {{based on the fact}} that the southern Dravidian languages show some signs of contact with linguistic groups which the northern Dravidian languages do not. Proto-Dravidian is thought to have differentiated into Proto-North Dravidian, Proto-Central Dravidian and Proto-South Dravidian around 1500 BCE, although some linguists have argued that the degree of differentiation between the sub-families <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> earlier split.|$|E
25|$|Ankylosaurids {{were likely}} very slow-moving animals. In all Ankylosauria, the fibula is more slender than the tibia, {{suggesting}} that the tibia carried most {{of the weight of}} the animal, while the fibula served as an area of muscular attachment. Hindlimb muscles of Euoplocephalus have been restored and the placement of several muscles inserting on the femur have very short moment arms. Muscles inserting on the tibia and fibula have longer moment arms. This pattern of retractor muscles <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> elephantine locomotion, consistent with columnar posture.|$|E
25|$|Note that on 1 May 1896 Nasser-al-Din Shah {{was indeed}} assassinated and some did blame a Babí but most {{information}} <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> anarchist {{who had been}} given privileged access to {{the person of the}} Shah because of the Shah’s sympathies for his suffering. Most Baha’is have some information of an acknowledged assassination plot by some Babis in 1852 for which Bahá’u’lláh was encarcerated in the Siyah-Chal and eventually found innocent albeit much property had been confiscated or lost to mobs as a result of simply being accused. This is a different incident.|$|E

50|$|A memory pointer (or just pointer) is a primitive, {{the value}} of which is {{intended}} {{to be used as a}} memory address; it is said that <b>a</b> pointer <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> memory address.

25|$|Close {{proximity}} {{to a large}} commercial centre (Olisipo) founded by Turduli tribes {{in the first half}} of the first millennium A.D., meant that the region of Sintra was influenced by human settlement throughout various epochs, cultures that have left remains in the area to this day. The toponym Sintra derives from the medieval Suntria, and <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> association with radical Indo-European cultures; the word translates into bright star or sun, commonly significant in those cultures. Marcus Terentius Varro and Cadizian Lucius Junius Moderatus Columella designated the place the sacred mountain and Ptolemy referred to it as the mountains of the moon.|$|E
25|$|In quantum mechanics, when a Hamiltonian has a {{symmetry}}, that symmetry {{manifests itself}} through {{a set of}} states that have the same energy; that is, the states are degenerate. In particle physics, the near mass-degeneracy of the neutron and proton <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> approximate symmetry of the Hamiltonian describing the strong interactions. The neutron does have a slightly higher mass due to isospin breaking; {{this is due to the}} difference in the masses of the up and down quarks and the effects of the electromagnetic interaction. However, the appearance of an approximate symmetry is still useful, since the small breakings can be described by a perturbation theory, which gives rise to slight differences between the near-degenerate states.|$|E
25|$|Like most of {{architecture}} {{from the early}} days of Raj, the college {{does not seem to have}} a definite architectural style. Subtle Victorian influenced arched windows and tiled canopies are seen in the older parts of the college but the main tower of the administrative building however <b>points</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> indigenous inspiration. Gargoyles can be seen adorning the sharp edges of the building. Post independence, rapid additions and alterations to the college were done. The central library, auditorium, and other departments such as Electronics, Instrumentation have a very contemporary design reminiscent of the construction in most Indian metros in the late '60s and 70s. A new wing which has been constructed has the most modern design out of all. In all, the college is generally a potpourri of architectural styles.|$|E
