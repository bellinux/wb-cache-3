This 1 – 13 [*]GHz ultra-wideband (UWB) channel characterization is formulated with rain intensity {{as the most}} important variable, from 20 [*]mm/h to 200 [*]mm/h. Tropical rain will cause pulse broadening and distorts the transmitted symbols, so the probability of symbol errors will increase. In this research, the bit error rate (BER) performance evaluation is done using both matched filtering or correlator-based receivers. At no rain conditions, BER 10 − 6 will be attained at signal to noise ratio (SNR) 5 [*]dB, but at rainfall intensity 200 [*]mm/h, the BER will fall to 10 − 2 for matched filter and 5 × 10 - 2 for correlator-based receivers.

The analysis and synthesis filters of the PQMF bank are composed of two-dimensional (2 -D) recursive digital all-pass filters (DAFs) with nonsymmetric half-plane (NSHP) support region. The design problem can be facilitated by using the 2 -D doubly complementary half-band (DC-HB) property possessed by the analysis and synthesis filters. For finding the coefficients of the 2 -D recursive NSHP DAFs, we appropriately formulate the design problem to result in an optimization problem that can be solved by using a weighted least-squares (WLS) algorithm in the minimax (L∞) optimal sense.

The analysis filter-bank consists of allpass polyphase filters to achieve a high frequency selectivity with a low algorith-mic complexity and low signal delay.

This problem is solved by stable allpass polyphase synthesis filters which are designed by analytical closed-form expressions. The first design can achieve arbitrarily small aliasing, amplitude and phase distortions in dependence of the tolerable signal delay and algorithmic complexity.

40|$|Abstract — Optical fiber {{is capable}} of {{providing}} {{the solution to the}} need of high bandwidth communication. The main degradation to the optical signal integrity in single mode fibers (SMFs) is chromatic dispersion (CD). The effect of CD is pulse spreading which in turn leads to inter-symbol interference (ISI), thus increasing the bit error rate (BER) of the system. This paper presents a CD compensation technique that utilizes a parallel optical all pass filter (p-OAPF), where the design is based on the inverse phase response of the SMF. The p-OAPF is based on a class of all-pass filter. Simulation results of the proposed technique show an increase in the repeater-less length of a point-to-point optical communication system by 3 times with Gaussian pulses at 10 Gb/s and BER of 10 - 9.

30|$|Channel {{equalization}} in {{filter bank}} based multicarrier (FBMC) modulation is addressed. We utilize an efficient oversampled filter bank concept with 2 x-oversampled subcarrier signals {{that can be}} equalized independently of each other. Due to Nyquist pulse shaping, consecutive symbol waveforms overlap in time, which calls for special means for equalization. Two alternative linear low-complexity subcarrier equalizer structures are developed together with straightforward channel estimation-based methods to calculate the equalizer coefficients using pointwise equalization within each subband (in a frequency-sampled manner). A novel structure, consisting of a linear-phase FIR amplitude equalizer and an allpass filter as <b>phase</b> <b>equalizer,</b> is found to provide enhanced robustness to timing estimation errors. This allows the receiver to be operated without time synchronization before the filter bank. The coded error-rate performance of FBMC with the studied equalization scheme is compared to a cyclic prefix OFDM reference in wireless mobile channel conditions, taking into account issues like spectral regrowth with practical nonlinear transmitters and sensitivity to frequency offsets. It is further emphasized that FBMC provides flexible means for high-quality frequency selective filtering in the receiver to suppress strong interfering spectral components within or close to the used frequency band.|$|E

Those systems are; space time block coding (STBC), {{code division multiple access}} (CDMA), and orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM). The proposed STBC OFDM-CDMA system has been simulated in the presence of frequency selective fast multipath fading channel which is considered the worst form of channel fading. Therefore, system performance depends mainly on channel equalization technique applied at the receiver. In this paper, a comparison among three channel equalization schemes was introduced, those schemes are; <b>phase</b> <b>equalizer</b> (PE), maximal ratio (MR), and minimum mean square error equalizer (MMSE). Those equalization schemes have been compared under various system conditions and using different modulation techniques.

40|$|Digital IIR filters find wide {{applications}} in {{fields such as}} speech processing, image processing and noise/echo cancellation. In recent years, the design of linear phase IIR filter becomes a very hot issue of research interest. As we know, FIR filters designed to approximate a magnitude response that has a narrow transition band between the passband and the stopband usually require {{a large number of}} multipliers and they have a large delay also. Hence we prefer to IIR digital filters that have less number of multipliers than their corresponding FIR counterparts but one of disadvantages is that an IIR filter cannot reach an exactly linear phase. The importance of the phase response linearity of a digital filter was recognized in early years 2 ̆ 7 research and Finite Impulse Response (FIR) filters provided a perfect solution to this requirement. However, due to fundamental incompetence of FIR filters stated before, approximately linear phase IIR filters became the focus of research as a compromise between the implementation cost and the linearity of the phase response. About twenty years ago, most of researches on digital filters and signal processing, when and if they discussed the design of digital filter, they treated mainly the approximation of the magnitude response, or else, dealt with magnitude and phase responses separately. For example, as we know, the one of the most well known methods for solving the problem of IIR filter phase linearity was based on the application of cascading the prototype IIR filter with an allpass <b>phase</b> <b>equalizer.</b> In recent years, new methods have been proposed for the simultaneous approximation of both the magnitude and group delay of IIR digital filter.

40|$|Filter-banks are an {{essential}} component of many algorithms for digital signal processing, which are nowadays employed in a variety of ubiquitous devices. Filter-banks enable signal processing in the frequency-domain and their design has often a significant influence on the performance of a system with regard to its computational complexity, signal quality and delay. In this thesis, novel design approaches for different types of allpass-based analysis-synthesis filter-banks are devised. A substantial benefit of these recursive filter-banks is that they can achieve a high frequency selectivity and/or a non-uniform time-frequency resolution with a low signal delay. One focus of this work is the design of allpass-based quadrature-mirror filter-banks (QMF-Banks) with near-perfect reconstruction. New synthesis filter-banks are presented which consist of allpass polyphase filters. They are designed by simple analytical expressions such that the trade-off between reconstruction error and signal delay of the filter-bank can be controlled in a simple manner. The devised QMF-bank has been employed in a candidate proposal for a new ITU-T speech and audio codec and has helped to achieve a high speech and audio quality with a low signal delay. A key issue in the design of allpass-based filter-banks is to compensate non-linear phase distortions caused by the recursive analysis filter-bank. Therefore, known as well as novel <b>phase</b> <b>equalizer</b> designs for this purpose are presented and analyzed. Another focus of this work is the design of allpass transformed analysis-synthesis filter-banks. They can achieve a non-uniform time-frequency resolution {{similar to that of the}} human auditory system, which is beneficial for speech and audio processing systems. Novel closed-form and numerical designs for the synthesis filter-bank are introduced, which aim for different design objectives. A benefit of the closed-form designs is their simplicity, while the numerical designs allow the explicit control of specific properties of the filter-bank such as signal delay, reconstruction error, bandpass characteristic of the synthesis filters etc. The new numerical designs are all stated as a convex optimization problem which can be solved rather easily. Finally, an efficient implementation for the special case of an allpass transformed filter-bank without subsampling is derived. This system, termed as filter-bank equalizer, allows to perform adaptive subband filtering with a low signal delay. It is shown how this filter-bank can be used for noise reduction, speech dereverberation, or speech intelligibility improvement in noisy environments. These low delay speech enhancement systems are of particular interest for applications within cell phones, hands-free devices, or digital hearing aids...|$|E
