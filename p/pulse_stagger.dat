40|$|<b>Pulse</b> to <b>pulse</b> <b>staggering</b> in the <b>pulse</b> {{reference}} interval (PRI), usually used {{to increase}} the radar unambiguous range and MTI blind speeds, complicates notably the synchronization of the pulsed waveform. A free running open loop technique {{may be used for}} this purpose, adjusting a stable clock at the same frequency as the transmitted pulses, which is synchronized by the received sequence during direct illumination. When the received signal can be contaminated by interferences, noise, or multipath effects, a more robust closed loop approach is desirable. This paper presents a closed loop solution to the synchronism process, based on a delay-lock loop configuration, using the special properties of the <b>pulse</b> to <b>pulse</b> <b>staggered</b> signal, that can be considered as a digital pseudorandom code modulation with a period equal to the PRIPeer ReviewedPostprint (published version...|$|R

The radar generates very low sidelobes and incorporates sophisticated frequency agility in pulse-topulse, burst-to-burst and scanto- scan regimes. It also switches and <b>staggers</b> <b>pulse</b> repetition frequency and transmits random jitter to further confuse countermeasures. It automatically selects the least jammed frequencies and can transmit intermittently or randomly. The radar offers a passive detection and tracking capability against jammers.|$|R
40|$|In {{the context}} of {{state-of-the-art}} and next-generation spaceborne Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging systems, such as the German Tandem-L mission proposal, a short revisit time coupled with high resolution presents itself as a requirement for the observation of numerous Earth dynamic processes in various scientific and environmental applications. This poses contradicting and demanding requirements on system design for whose realization digital beamforming techniques play a crucial role, in order to enable next-generation systems to significantly outperform current state-of-the-art systems and fulfil the increasingly stringent needs of applications. Multichannel SAR systems with digital beamforming in azimuth have been proposed as an option for coping with these challenging requirements {{in order to achieve}} high-resolution wide-swath (HRWS) imaging capabilities. These systems tend however to require a very long antenna to image wide swaths. As an alternative, the use of digital beamforming in elevation, in conjunction with a varying pulse repetition interval (PRI) for the SAR system radar <b>pulses</b> (<b>Staggered</b> SAR), has been proposed. The best azimuth resolution in this case is nevertheless limited by the antenna dimensions. The thesis focuses on the development of new SAR techniques and corresponding processing methodologies which allow the combination of the advantages of the multichannel system architectures in azimuth with those of staggered SAR. This introduces new and potentially highly flexible modes of operation, enabling HRWS imaging with a compact antenna and contributing to the new developments in the field of digital beamforming techniques. The thesis includes the proposal of novel algorithms for the resampling of multichannel staggered SAR data and examples of high-performance HRWS systems designed {{to make use of the}} technique. In addition, a proof-of-concept with experimental data from a ground-based radar system and a discussion of the possible effects of errors for the implementation of this new class of spaceborne imaging systems are presented...|$|R

As a standard for this comparison, the specifications of the forthcoming next generation weather radar (NEXRAD) are used. A statistical analysis of the spectral momentestimates for the staggered scheme is developed, and a theoretical expression for the signal-to-noise ratio due to recohering-filteringrecohering for the random phase radar is obtained. Algorithms for assignment of correct ranges to pertinent spectral moments for both techniques are presented. ...|$|R

The United We have developed new design algorithms for finite impulse response (FIR) filters that compensate for arbitrary input spacing and that allow for arbitrary group delay specification. The potential of these new designs to work with the ASR- 9 <b>staggered</b> <b>pulse</b> spacing is examined {{in the context of the}} ASR- 9 wind-shear processor (WSP). Benefits derived from the new designs include an improved (optimal) stopband design, an increased yield in pulse samples for moments estimation, and the retention of pulse-stagger phase information, which can be used for velocity dealiasing. These improvements are demonstrated using simulated and test-bed data, the latter acquired during 1991 / 1992 Orlando operations. Filter utilization, in the context of a pre-existing adaptive selection scheme (1] and the Orlando (FL) clutter environment, is examined using the new filters, and areas for improvement are identified...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the implementation of}} the <b>staggered</b> <b>pulse</b> repetition time (PRT) technique on NOAA’s research and development WSR- 88 D in Norman, Oklahoma. The prototype algorithm incorporates a novel rule for the correct assignment of Doppler mean velocity that is needed to accommodate arbitrary stagger ratios. Description of the rule, consideration of errors, and choice of appropriate stagger ratios are presented. The staggered PRT algorithm is integrated with the standard processing on the WSR- 88 D, some details of which are included in the paper. A simple ground clutter canceller removes the pure complex time series mean (DC) component from autocovariance estimates; censoring of overlaid echoes and thresholding are equivalent to those used on the WSR- 88 D. Further, a cursory verification of statistical errors indicates good agreement with theoretical expectations. Although the staggered PRT algorithm operates in real time, it was advantageous to collect several events of staggered PRT time series data for further scrutiny. Results presented from one of the events demonstrate the potency of the staggered PRT to mitigate range and velocity ambiguities. 1...|$|R
40|$|During {{training}} and rehabilitation with haptic devices, {{it is often}} necessary to simultaneously present force cues arising from dif-ferent haptic models (such as guidance cues and environmental forces). Multiple force cues are typically summed to produce a sin-gle output force, which conveys only relative information about the original force cues {{and may not be}} useful to trainees. Two force co-presentation paradigms are proposed as potential solutions to this problem: temporal separation of force cues, where one type of force is overlaid with the other in <b>staggered</b> <b>pulses,</b> and spatial separation, where the forces are presented via multiple haptic devices. A gen-eralized model for separating task and guidance forces in a virtual environment is also proposed. In a pilot study where sixteen par-ticipants were trained in a dynamic target-hitting task using these co-presentation paradigms, simple summation was in fact most ef-fective at eliciting skill transfer in most respects. Spatial separation imposed the lowest overall workload on participants, however, and might thus be more appropriate than summation in tasks with other significant physical or mental demands. Temporal separation was relatively inferior at eliciting skill transfer, but it is hypothesized that this paradigm would have performed considerably better in a non-rhythmic task, and the need for further research is indicated...|$|R
40|$|In the <b>staggered</b> <b>pulse</b> {{repetition}} time (PRT) radar, {{the phase}} {{difference between the}} autocorrelations at lag T 1 and T 2 is used for velocity estimation. This paper investigates velocity estimates from the autocorrelation at shorter lag, while the longer lag is used to resolve the ambiguity. This velocity estimate is shown to have lower error than the one using the phase difference. This method is preferred {{in the absence of}} ground clutter. In a recent paper on the spectral processing of the staggered PRT sequences, a new algorithm was presented that enables the recovery of spectral moments in presence of ground clutter. Although this algorithm recovers velocity over the extended unambiguous interval corresponding to the difference PRT, there is a small bias error in the velocity and spectrum width estimates due to the loss of some of the signal components in the process of filtering the clutter. An enhancement in the algorithm is suggested that enables removal of this bias by reconstructing the lost spectral components before the spectral moments are estimated. The proposed algorithm completely removes the bias error in the velocity and spectral width most of the time thereby significantly improving these estimates. The window function and the number of samples used for processing significantly influence the performance of the clutter filter. The window function effect is explored via simulation, and these results are presented. 1...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} is to investigate the application of Doppler radar systems for global wind measurement. A model of the satellite-based radar wind sounder (RAWS) is discussed, and many critical problems in the designing process, such as the antenna scan pattern, tracking the Doppler shift caused by satellite motion, and backscattering of radar signals from different types of clouds, are discussed along with their computer simulations. In addition, algorithms for measuring mean frequency of radar echoes, such as the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) estimator, the covariance estimator, and the estimators based on autoregressive models, are discussed. Monte Carlo computer simulations were {{used to compare the}} performance of these algorithms. Anti-alias methods are discussed for the FFT and the autoregressive methods. Several algorithms for reducing radar ambiguity were studied, such as random phase coding methods and <b>staggered</b> <b>pulse</b> repitition frequncy (PRF) methods. Computer simulations showed that these methods are not applicable to the RAWS because of the broad spectral widths of the radar echoes from clouds. A waveform modulation method using the concept of spread spectrum and correlation detection was developed to solve the radar ambiguity. Radar ambiguity functions were used to analyze the effective signal-to-noise ratios for the waveform modulation method. The results showed that, with suitable bandwidth product and modulation of the waveform, this method can achieve the desired maximum range and maximum frequency of the radar system...|$|R

Five ruminally cannulated steers were fitted with abomasal infusion lines that were inserted through their ruminal cannulas. There were 5 treatments, a control (CON) of only water, a single pulse dose of 1 g/kg of oligofructose (OL 1) or starch (ST 1) or 4 staggered doses of 0. 25 g/kg of oligofructose (OL 4) or starch (ST 4) administered every 6 h. Fecal samples were collected to measure fecal score, pH, dry matter (DM), VFA, endotoxin and apparent total tract nutrient digestibility. The results showed that a decrease in fecal pH from 7 to 6 occurred {{as a result of}} the OL 1 and ST 1 treatments and a decrease from 7 to 6. 5 in the staggered doses. Fecal score also decreased from OL 1 most severely but OL 4 also caused a decline. An increase in total VFA and endotoxin concentrations in feces was seen across all treatments compared to CON. Both the <b>pulse</b> dose and <b>staggered</b> dose of oligofructose induced conditions similar to those seen in post-ruminal acidosis.

40|$|Reducing the delay-Doppler {{ambiguity}} and redistribution of ambiguity volume through waveform design {{has long been}} a goal of radar signal design. Motivated by the neural processing of echolocation waveforms by certain species of bats, we study an approach to the processing of radar signals. We propose a transmission strategy and a family of processing algorithms and evaluate the resulting delay-Doppler resolution characteristics. We study both the delay-Doppler ambiguity reduction and the generation of artifacts in the delay-Doppler maps generated by this approach. Because the resulting schemes are not optimal from detection point of view, we investigate the degradation in detection performance when compared to the matched filter. The contribution of the proposed strategies is a significant improvement in delay-Doppler resolution without a significant increase in system or computational complexity or a significant degradation in detection performance. We also consider the ambiguity volume manipulation in the delay-Doppler plane using <b>staggered</b> <b>pulse</b> trains and propose an efficient DFT based pulse Doppler processing receiver. ^ Finally, in the emerging phased-MIMO radar context, we analyze the impact of transmit array partitioning into a set of subarrays on the overall transmit-receive beampattern. Our results indicate that for conventional beamforming, the overall transmit-receive beampattern is only a function of element overlapping across the subarrays, and not a function of the number of subarrays. We also investigate an element overlapping strategy that promises improved beampattern as compared to the traditional phased arrays. ...|$|R
