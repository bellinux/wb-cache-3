5|$|Following the September 11 {{terrorist}} attacks, Clinton {{sought to}} obtain {{funding for the}} recovery efforts in New York City and security improvements in her state. Working with New York's senior senator, Charles Schumer, she was instrumental in securing $21billion in funding for the World Trade Center site's redevelopment. She subsequently took {{a leading role in}} investigating the health issues faced by 9/11 first responders. Clinton voted for the USA <b>Patriot</b> <b>Act</b> in October 2001. In 2005, when the act was up for renewal, she expressed concerns with the USA <b>Patriot</b> <b>Act</b> Reauthorization Conference Report regarding civil liberties, before voting in favor of the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act of 2005 in March 2006 that gained large majority support.|$|E
5000|$|InD'tale Magazine said, [...] "Mr. Eade takes a truly {{realistic}} {{look into}} the atrocities that occurred at Guantanamo Bay {{in the act of}} patriotism and protecting the freedom of Americans. The reality is not pretty. The story being told is a powerful {{look into the}} inner workings of a twisted government machine. Brent Marks and Rick Penn are exceptional characters, supported by a cast of government officials that will make you smile or cringe. A <b>Patriot's</b> <b>Act</b> is an edge-of-your-seat thriller that could easily be transformed into a dramatic film. Simply riveting, start to finish!" [...] InD'tale Magazine also nominated A <b>Patriot's</b> <b>Act</b> for its 2015 RONE Award in the Suspense category.|$|R

5000|$|A <b>Patriot's</b> <b>Act</b> is a 2014 legal {{suspense}} thriller by Kenneth G. Eade.

The novel is critically acclaimed.|$|R
5|$|In the United States, the Department of Homeland Security {{was created}} by the Homeland Security Act to {{coordinate}} domestic anti-terrorism efforts. The USA <b>Patriot</b> <b>Act</b> gave the federal government greater powers, including the authority to detain foreign terror suspects for a week without charge, to monitor telephone communications, e-mail, and Internet use by terror suspects, and to prosecute suspected terrorists without time restrictions. The FAA ordered that airplane cockpits be reinforced to prevent terrorists gaining control of planes, and assigned sky marshals to flights. Further, the Aviation and Transportation Security Act made the federal government, rather than airports, responsible for airport security. The law created the Transportation Security Administration to inspect passengers and luggage, causing long delays and concern over passenger privacy. After suspected abuses of the USA <b>Patriot</b> <b>Act</b> were brought to light in June 2013 with articles about collection of American call records by the NSA and the PRISM program (see 2013 mass surveillance disclosures), Representative Jim Sensenbrenner, Republican of Wisconsin, who introduced the <b>Patriot</b> <b>Act</b> in 2001, said that the National Security Agency overstepped its bounds.|$|E
5|$|As Speaker, Hastert shepherded the USA <b>Patriot</b> <b>Act</b> in October 2001 to {{passage in}} the House on a 357-66 vote. In a 2011 interview, Hastert claimed credit for its passage over the misgivings of many members. Fourteen years later, federal {{prosecutors}} used the Patriot Act's expansion of currency transaction reporting requirements to indict Hastert on federal charges.|$|E
5|$|In 2004, the ACLU {{sued the}} federal {{government}} in American Civil Liberties Union v. Ashcroft on behalf of Nicholas Merrill, owner of an Internet service provider. Under the provisions of the <b>Patriot</b> <b>Act,</b> the government had issued national security letters to Merrill to compel him to provide private Internet access information from some of his customers. In addition, the government placed a gag order on Merrill, forbidding him from discussing the matter with anyone.|$|E
40|$|September 11, 2001 {{forced the}} United States to reevaluate its {{national}} security measures. President George W. Bush first relied on Attorney General Ashcroft {{to make recommendations}} regarding how to better protect the United States. Ashcroft and others found them wanting. To ensure {{the protection of the}} U. S., Ashcroft proposed legislation known as the <b>Patriot</b> <b>Acts</b> which would: allow people to be detained without strong suspicion for much longer than previously allowed, eliminate attorney client privilege, and allow wiretaps to be obtained without reasonable suspicion and last longer than before. The claim was that all of these measures would protect us from terrorism. However, at what cost? I seek to research whether or not the <b>Patriot</b> <b>Acts</b> will truly protect us, or if they will merely harm us by eroding our Constitutional Rights...|$|R
50|$|In Holder v. Humanitarian Law Project the Washington Legal Foundation filed a brief that {{argued that}} certain {{provisions}} of the <b>PATRIOT</b> <b>Act's</b> do not violate the First Amendment.

5000|$|The final plank in Rosenzweig's {{counter-argument}} is {{that even}} under the scrutiny of the courts, Congress and the Department of Justice no abuses have been detected under section 206, and that [...] "even <b>Patriot</b> <b>Act's</b> most ardent critics must admit that they are basing their legislative proposals on the fear of potential abuse rather than reality of actual abuse." ...|$|R

In contrast, a majority of both CPC members and of Democratic members of Congress voted for the amendment, while Kennedy stood out as a supporter of the party leadership. His vote has been criticized as a sign for a lack of commitment to civil liberties.|$|E
5|$|The American Library Association honored her for {{her years}} of support to America's {{libraries}} and librarians in April 2005. The Progressive Librarians Guild opposed her being honored, because of her support of the USA <b>PATRIOT</b> <b>Act,</b> her cancellation of a poetry forum due to concern {{that some of the}} poets would express opposition to the war in Iraq, and the Guild's opposition to policies and spending priorities of her husband's administration.|$|E
5|$|On March 9, 2006, a {{revision}} of the USA <b>PATRIOT</b> <b>Act</b> was signed into law. It amended the process for interim appointments of U.S. Attorneys, a clause Specter wrote during his chairmanship of the Senate Judiciary Committee. The change allowed the Bush Administration to appoint interim U.S. attorneys without term limits, and without confirmation by the Senate. The Bush administration used the law to place at least eight interim attorneys into office in 2006. Specter claimed that the changes were added by staff member Brett Tolman. For more information, see dismissal of U.S. Attorneys controversy.|$|E

5|$|She {{coordinated the}} effort against the Communications Decency Act of 1996, {{which was the}} first attempt by the United States Congress to {{introduce}} a form of censorship of speech on the Internet. Krug strongly opposed the notion that libraries should censor the material that they provide to patrons. She supported laws and policies protecting the confidentiality of library use records. When the United States Department of Justice used the authority of the USA <b>PATRIOT</b> <b>Act</b> of 2001 to conduct searches of what once were confidential library databases, Krug raised a public outcry against this activity by the government.|$|E
5|$|The ACLU {{has been}} criticized by liberals, such as when it {{excluded}} Communists from its leadership ranks, when it defended Neo-Nazis, when it declined to defend Paul Robeson, or when it opposed {{the passage of the}} National Labor Relations Act.

When the United States Department of Justice used {{the authority of the}} USA <b>PATRIOT</b> <b>Act</b> of 2001 to conduct searches of once-confidential library databases, Krug raised a public outcry against this government action. When shortly after the September 11 attacks a Florida librarian told police that one of the attackers had been using the Delray Beach public libraryalthough Florida law guarantees confidentiality to library patronsKrug criticized the action. She stated she wished the librarian had adhered to Florida law, but empathized with the situation and said that most individuals would likely have done the same thing.|$|E

5|$|In these {{conflict}} of laws cases, Apple met with conflicting international judicial opinions: an Australian court decision conflicted with a Canadian court decision on the copyrightability of object code. In IBM v. Computer Imports, the High Court of New Zealand then considered these prior decisions and sided with the Canadian decision in ruling that, although object code is not an original literary work in its own right, it is a reproduction of source code in material form and therefore an infringement of copyright takes place if it is copied without the authorization of the copyright owner. Such legal conflicts affected not only Apple, but all other software companies as well, and the conflicts remained unresolved until {{the creation of an}} international legal regime embodied in further changes to national copyright laws, which ultimately made object code subject to copyright law. These revisions of law in favor of making object code subject to copyright law are still controversial. The revisions also form the technical underpinnings (via the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) and the Electronic Communications Privacy Act) for the legal notions of electronic privacy violation and computer trespass, as well as the further development of anti-hacking law-making such as the <b>Patriot</b> <b>Act</b> and the Convention on Cybercrime.|$|E
