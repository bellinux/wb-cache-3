Ray and Sons was {{primarily}} {{set up as}} an initiative to remedy the lack of good quality <b>printing</b> <b>of</b> <b>illustrations</b> in Calcutta {{in spite of the}} existence of advanced printing presses in the early 1890s. Upendrakishore, a versatile genius, excelling in the fields of children’s literature, music, painting and printing technology could not therefore have first grade illustrations published for his Children’s Ramayan. A lack of skill in graphic arts and photo-processes resulted in ruined print illustrations. ‘At that time, only a few local firms like Thacker and Spincks (of Thacker's Indian Directory) took commercial orders for halftone blocks but they were very costly. Being of an inventive and mechanical turn of mind, Upendrakishore ordered the necessary equipment from A.W. Penrose & Co., of 109 Farringdon Street, London, and began to study the technical nature of the subject. These studies led him to investigate the theoretical basis of the process camera and arrive at conclusions which standardises the hitherto empirical practices at process work.’ [...] ‘A camera and various pieces of half-tone equipment arrived from Britain … bybullock cart; soon after that, they moved out of 13 Cornwallis Street to a house not far away which Upendrakisore had made into a studio. The money for this came from selling most of his share in the zamindari at his ancestral home in Mymensingh to his foster brother Narendrakisore, {{who was in charge of}} it following his father Harikisore’s death,’ records Andrew Robinson ...|$|E

30|$|In 1959, Chengru Feng’s book Biological Illustration {{was finally}} published, though {{he began to}} {{summarize}} his knowledge about biological illustration as early as when he trained his family members to draw in 1929. When teaching in the specialized class, he edited this book systematically for his students, but never published it. It was comprehensively improved {{during the spring of}} 1955, when he was invited to give lectures by Nanjing Agricultural College (Feng 1959). This handbook provided a comprehensive introduction to biological <b>illustration,</b> including: requirements <b>of</b> biological illustration; tools, materials, instruments needed and their operation; basic skills and different ways of drawing; how to draw animals (insect and fish) and plants (flowering plants and algae); technology <b>of</b> <b>printing,</b> and so on. Chengru Feng especially emphasized that a biological illustration needed to be scientifically correct. No matter the shape, ratio, color or other details <b>of</b> an <b>illustration</b> should be completely correct and accurate (Feng 1959). He was very conscious of differences and connections between biological illustration and painting. Since most illustrations were drawn for printing, rather than appreciation as paintings, he also improved the <b>printing</b> techniques <b>of</b> <b>illustrations.</b> As the first handbook <b>of</b> biological <b>illustration,</b> Biological Illustration revealed the efforts and contributions Chengru Feng had made for this field. It also served as the benchmark text book for later illustrators.|$|R

50|$|In {{addition}} to the method similar to the Bessemer process mentioned above, there were other notable advancements in Chinese metallurgy during the Middle Ages.

To remedy the problem of deforestation, the Song Chinese discovered how to produce coke from bituminous coal as a substitute for charcoal.
