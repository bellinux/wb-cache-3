50|$|<b>Parallax</b> <b>error</b> can be {{seen when}} taking photos with many types of cameras, such as twin-lens reflex cameras and those {{including}} viewfinders (such as rangefinder cameras). In such cameras, the eye sees the subject through different optics (the viewfinder, or a second lens) than the one through which the photo is taken. As the viewfinder is often found above {{the lens of the}} camera, photos with <b>parallax</b> <b>error</b> are often slightly lower than intended, the classic example being the image of person with his or her head cropped off. This problem is addressed in single-lens reflex cameras, in which the viewfinder sees through the same lens through which the photo is taken (with the aid of a movable mirror), thus avoiding <b>parallax</b> <b>error.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Because {{the pointer}} of the meter {{is usually a}} small {{distance}} above {{the scale of the}} meter, <b>parallax</b> <b>error</b> can occur when the operator attempts to read the scale line that [...] "lines up" [...] with the pointer. To counter this, some meters include a mirror along the markings of the principal scale. The accuracy of the reading from a mirrored scale is improved by positioning one's head while reading the scale so that the pointer and the reflection of the pointer are aligned; at this point, the operator's eye must be directly above the pointer and any <b>parallax</b> <b>error</b> has been minimized.|$|E

40|$|We {{show that}} the errors in the Hipparcos parallaxes towards the Pleiades and the Hyades open {{clusters}} are spatially correlated over angular scales of 2 to 3 deg, with an amplitude of up to 2 mas. We suggest that this correlation on small angular scales is a generic feature of the Hipparcos parallaxes all over the sky. We predict the parallaxes of individual cluster members, pi_pm, from their Hipparcos proper motions, assuming that all cluster members have the same space velocity. We compare pi_pm with their Hipparcos parallaxes, pi_Hip, and find that there are significant spatial correlations in pi_Hip. We derive a distance modulus to the Pleiades of 5. 58 +- 0. 18 mag using the radial-velocity gradient method. This value agrees very well with the distance modulus of 5. 60 +- 0. 04 mag using the main-sequence fitting technique, {{but it is in}} conflict with the value of 5. 33 +- 0. 06 mag inferred from the mean Hipparcos parallaxes of the Pleiades members. The Hipparcos parallaxes of all the Pleiades members that are within a 3 deg x 3 deg region of the cluster center are all systematically larger than pi_pm, thereby leading to a shorter mean distance to the Pleiades. Although the Hipparcos <b>parallax</b> <b>errors</b> towards the Hyades are also spatially correlated, the center of the Hyades is on a node of this spatial structure. Therefore, the <b>parallax</b> <b>errors</b> cancel out in an average distance estimate, leading to a mean Hyades distance that agrees with the pre-Hipparcos value. We speculate that the spatial correlations are also responsible for the discrepant distances that are inferred using the mean Hipparcos parallaxes to other open clusters, although an agreement with the pre-Hipparcos distances does not necessarily preclude spatially correlated Hipparcos <b>parallax</b> <b>errors...</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{viewfinder}} of any {{camera that}} does not allow viewing through the taking lens, including rangefinder cameras, is necessarily offset from the taking lens, so that the image shown is not exactly what will be recorded on the film; this <b>parallax</b> <b>error</b> is negligible at large subject distances, but increases as the distance decreases.

Since the two components are associated, {{it is reasonable to assume}} they lie at the same distance, so the different parallaxes are a result of experimental error (indeed, when the associated <b>parallax</b> <b>errors</b> are taken into account, the ranges of the parallaxes overlap).

5000|$|In contrast, the {{viewfinder}} pathway of an SLR transmits an image directly [...] "through the lens". This eliminates <b>parallax</b> <b>errors</b> at any subject distance, thus allowing for macro photography. It also removes {{the need to}} have separate viewfinders for different lens focal lengths. In particular, this allows for extreme telephoto lenses which would otherwise be very hard to focus and compose with a rangefinder. Furthermore, the through-the-lens view allows {{the viewfinder}} to directly display the depth of field for a given aperture, which is not possible with a rangefinder design. To compensate for this, rangefinder users often use zone focusing, which is especially applicable to the rapid-fire approach to street photography.|$|R
40|$|Summary Matt {{artificial}} sky domes {{are prone}} to <b>parallax</b> <b>errors</b> because the luminance of each element of the sky is independent of the viewing direction. Since the luminance of a real sky varies with the viewing direction, the luminance distribution of a non-uniform matt sky cannot be correct {{for more than one}} viewpoint. Unfortunately, a model building has to comprise a variety of viewpoints. <b>Parallax</b> <b>errors</b> can be eliminated if the luminance of each element of the sky dome is permitted to vary appropriately with viewing direction. Implementation, advantages and limitations of this arrangement are discussed. 1 Artificial sky domes The origin of the ~ial sky dome may {{be traced back to the}} Treasury of Atreus (ca. 2400 BCE), a royal tomb whose vault was said to represent the heavenly firmament sparkling with stars(1). The first attempted use of an artificial sky for daylight studies, about 90 years ago, has been attributed to P. J. Waldram(2). During the inter-war years, ~ c~al skies having a near-uniform distribution of luminance were used for daylight prediction. The uniform luminance distribution was rela-tively easy to achieve, and had the great advantage that the illuminance at a given point inside a model was independent of the position of the model in the sky, provided that surrounding buildings or other obstacles prevented a direct view of the horizon. Since the early skies were typically used to study the performance of light wells (the 1920 s equivalent of present-day atria), this proviso was not burdensome...|$|R
