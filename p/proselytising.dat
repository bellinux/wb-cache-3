5|$|Tablighi Jamaat {{has claimed}} to avoid {{electronic}} media and {{in favor of}} personal communication for <b>proselytising,</b> although prominent Tablighi personalities such as Tariq Jameel are featured on an extensive range of Internet videos and often appear on TV.|$|E
5|$|Tablighi Jamaat {{encourages}} {{everyone to}} fulfill the Islamic requirement of dawah even if the person falls short of strong religious intellect. This {{was different from the}} other Islamic movements which were mainly ulama-led and extended their leadership roles to the religious scholars. Tablighi Jamaat also disagree with the prevailing idea that the highest standards of Islamic scholarship and ethical standards were prerequisites for <b>proselytising,</b> and promote dawah as a mechanism of self-reform.|$|E
5|$|The Portuguese {{encouraged}} intermarriage {{with the}} local population, and strongly supported the Roman Catholic Church. In 1560, they started <b>proselytising</b> the local Koli, Kunbi, Kumbhar population in Mahim, Worli, and Bassein. These Christians were referred to by the British as Portuguese Christians, though they were Nestorian Christians who had only recently established ties with the Roman Catholic Church. During this time, Bombay's main trade was coconuts and coir. After Antonio Pessoa's death in 1571, a patent was issued which granted Mazagaon in perpetuity to the Sousa e Lima family. The St. Andrew Church at Bandra was built in 1575.|$|E

5|$|Religious {{beliefs in}} the Eastern Empire and Iran were in flux during the late sixth and early seventh centuries. Judaism was an active <b>proselytising</b> faith, {{and at least one}} Arab {{political}} leader converted to it. Christianity had active missions competing with the Persians' Zoroastrianism in seeking converts, especially among residents of the Arabian Peninsula. All these strands came together with the emergence of Islam in Arabia during the lifetime of Muhammad (d. 632). After his death, Islamic forces conquered much of the Eastern Empire and Persia, starting with Syria in 634–635 and reaching Egypt in 640–641, Persia between 637 and 642, North Africa in the later seventh century, and the Iberian Peninsula in 711. By 714, Islamic forces controlled much of the peninsula in a region they called Al-Andalus.|$|E
5|$|The early Bhagavata {{writings}} in Sanskrit by well-known acharyas (gurus) were solely {{meant to}} have a <b>proselytising</b> effect on the masses, encouraging them to a theistic {{way of life and}} belief in the god Krishna. Chatu Vitthalanatha, who flourished as a court poet of King Krishnadeva Raya and his successor King Achyuta Raya, was the first to translate the Bhagavata into Kannada in a voluminous writing comprising 12,247 stanzas divided into 280 sections. The work covered the entire original version in shatpadi metre. Two other names appear in the colophons, Sadananda Yati and Nityatma Sukayogi, prompting some scholars to attribute the work to the group while others consider them alternate names of the same writer. The work covers all ten avatars of the god Vishnu, though it is essentially centred on the depiction of Krishna as the supreme Lord. The purana covers stories of Vishnu's famous devotees such as Prahlad and Dhruva in detail, as well as stories of demons Vritasura, Hiranyakashipu and others who sought to attain salvation by dying at the hands of Vishnu. Most noteworthy is the epic's influence on the compositions of the Haridasas. Though the writing is not considered as important as the other two epics of the period, its significance to religiously minded people is well accepted. Chatu Vitthalanatha wrote a fuller version of portions of the epic Mahabharata as well. Other notable writers of the 16th century were Tirumala Bhatta (Siva Gite) and Ramendra (Saundarya Katharatna, using tripadi metre).|$|E

50|$|During {{the same}} period also many Japanese new religions, or {{independent}} Shinto sects, <b>proselytised</b> in Manchuria establishing hundreds of congregations. Most of the missions belonged to the Omoto teaching, the Tenri teaching and the Konko teaching of Shinto.|$|R
25|$|The Mongols {{had been}} <b>proselytised</b> since about the seventh century. Many Mongol tribes, {{such as the}} Keraites, the Naimans, the Merkit, the Ongud, and {{to a large extent}} the Qara Khitai (who practiced it {{side-by-side}} with Buddhism), were Nestorian Christian.|$|R
50|$|Many Muslim missionaries {{propagated}} Islam {{during this}} period in Ladakh and <b>proselytised</b> many Ladakhi people. Many Balti Muslims settled in Leh after the marriage of Jamyang to Gyal. Muslims were also invited to the region for trading and other purposes.|$|R
25|$|<b>Proselytising</b> {{has been}} illegal in China since 1949. But , many Christian missionaries were {{reported}} to be active in Tibet with the tacit approval of Chinese authorities, who view the missionaries as a counterforce to Tibetan Buddhism or as a boon to the local economy.|$|E

25|$|The impulse of the Moravian Church {{after its}} renewal at Herrnhut was to evangelise. This did not entail <b>proselytising</b> from other churches. It {{involved}} creating societies which would quicken spiritual life within existing Protestant denominations or {{among people who}} were unattached to any church; and taking the Gospel to those, especially in the Danish, Dutch and British colonies, who had never heard it before.|$|E

50|$|After an Anglican {{chaplain}} accused Access Ministries of bias, the Anglican Archbishop of Melbourne, Philip Freier, came {{to their}} defence, stating he believes that {{in the vast majority}} of cases Christian religious education teachers give their time to teach, not to <b>proselytise.</b>|$|R
25|$|St. Thomas, one of {{the disciples}} of Jesus, is {{believed}} to have visited India while <b>proselytising.</b> It is possible that many of the Jews who became Christians at that time were absorbed by what became the Nasrani or Saint Thomas Christians.

25|$|The last Maharaja of the Sikh Empire Duleep Singh {{converted}} to Christianity in 1853, a controversial but influential event in Sikh history. Along with his conversion, and after Sikh Empire had been dissolved {{and the region}} made {{a part of the}} colonial British Empire, <b>proselytising</b> activities of Christians, Brahmo Samajis, Arya Samaj, Muslim Anjuman-i-Islamia and Ahmadiyah sought to convert the Sikhs in northwestern Indian subcontinent into their respective faiths. These developments launched the Singh Sabha Movement.|$|E
25|$|Though Christian {{influence}} in China existed {{as early as}} the 7th century, Christianity did not begin to gain a significant foothold in China until the establishment of contact with Europeans during the Ming and Qing dynasties. Chinese practices at odds with Christian beliefs resulted in the Chinese Rites controversy, and a subsequent reduction in Christian influence. Christianity grew considerably following the First Opium War, after which foreign missionaries in China enjoyed the protection of the Western powers and engaged in widespread <b>proselytising.</b>|$|E
50|$|Protestantism was {{introduced}} in the 19th century. Ignoring the Qing dynasty policy that prevented them from entering Inner Mongolia and Manchuria, Christian missionaries, along with an ever-increasing number of Han Chinese settlers, entered the region and <b>proselytised</b> there since the last decades of the century.|$|R

25|$|Initially {{known as}} The Sisterhood, the band {{were forced to}} change their name after Andrew Eldritch claimed it. After some deliberation, The Mission was chosen, {{referring}} to the <b>proselytising</b> mission {{that was part of}} Hussey's Mormon upbringing. Mick Brown has a different account, saying the name came from his favourite brand of speakers, Mission. When the band planned to tour the USA in 1987, it was found that a Philadelphia R band had already claimed it and thus the band were known in the United States as The Mission UK thereafter.|$|E
25|$|The Filipinos to {{an extent}} {{resisted}} Christianisation because they felt an agricultural obligation and connection with their rice fields, as large villages took away their resources and they feared the compact environment. This also took away from the encomienda system that depended on land, therefore, the encomenderos lost tributes. However, the missionaries continued their <b>proselytising</b> efforts, one strategy being targeting noble children. These scions of now-tributary monarchs and rulers were subjected to intense education in religious doctrine and the Spanish language, with the theory that they in turn could convert their elders, and eventually, the nobleman's subjects.|$|E
25|$|One of Achill's {{most famous}} {{historical}} sites {{is that of}} the Achill Mission or 'the Colony' at Dugort. In 1831 the Church of Ireland Reverend Edward Nangle founded a <b>proselytising</b> mission at Dugort. The Mission included schools, cottages, an orphanage, an infirmary and a guesthouse. The Colony was very successful for a time and regularly produced a newspaper called the Achill Herald and Western Witness. Nangle expanded his mission into Mweelin, where a school was built. The Achill Mission began to decline slowly after Nangle was moved from Achill and was finally closed in the 1880s. Nangle died in 1883.|$|E
5000|$|In 1873, {{following}} the Meiji Restoration, the ban was rescinded, {{freedom of religion}} was promulgated, and Protestant missionaries (プロテスタント Purotesutanto or 新教 Shinkyō, [...] "renewed teaching") began to <b>proselytise</b> in Japan, intensifying their activities after World War II, yet they were never as successful as in Korea.|$|R

25|$|Before the 1930s, the Senussi Movement was {{the primary}} Islamic {{movement}} in Libya. This was a religious revival adapted to desert life. Its zawaaya (lodges) were found in Tripolitania and Fezzan, but Senussi influence was strongest in Cyrenaica. Rescuing the region from unrest and anarchy, the Senussi movement gave the Cyrenaican tribal people a religious attachment and feelings of unity and purpose. This Islamic movement, which was eventually destroyed by both Italian invasion and later the Gaddafi government, was very conservative and somewhat different from the Islam that exists in Libya today. Gaddafi asserted {{that he was a}} devout Muslim, and his government was taking a role in supporting Islamic institutions and in worldwide <b>proselytising</b> on behalf of Islam.|$|E
25|$|The English {{had little}} success in {{converting}} either the native elite or the Irish {{people to the}} Protestant religion. It is an enduring question, why the Protestant reformation failed to take hold amongst the Irish (amongst many) {{lies in the fact}} that brutal methods were used by crown authority to pacify the country and exploit its resources, which heightened resentment of English rule. An additional reason was a determined <b>proselytising</b> campaign carried out in Ireland by counter-reformation Catholic clergy, many of whom had been educated in seminaries on the continent. Irish Colleges had been established in many countries in Catholic Europe for the training of Irish Catholic priests and the education of the Irish Catholic gentry. Finally, the printing press, which had played a major role in disseminating Protestant ideas in Europe, came to Ireland very late.|$|E
25|$|Christianity came to Tuvalu in 1861 when Elekana, a deacon of a Congregational {{church in}} Manihiki, Cook Islands became {{caught in a}} storm and drifted for 8 weeks before landing at Nukulaelae on 10 May 1861. Elekana began <b>proselytising</b> Christianity. He was trained at Malua Theological College, a London Missionary Society (LMS) school in Samoa, before {{beginning}} his work in establishing the Church of Tuvalu. In 1865 the Rev. A. W. Murray of the LMS – a Protestant congregationalist missionary society – arrived as the first European missionary where he too proselytised among the inhabitants of Tuvalu. By 1878 Protestantism was well established with preachers on each island. In the later 19th and early 20th centuries the ministers of what became the Church of Tuvalu (Te Ekalesia Kelisiano Tuvalu) were predominantly Samoans, who influenced {{the development of the}} Tuvaluan language and the music of Tuvalu.|$|E
