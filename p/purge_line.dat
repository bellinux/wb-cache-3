40|$|The breeder thermal {{performances}} under a <b>purge</b> <b>line</b> break {{have been}} analyzed for two blanket design options: a blanket design using a packed breeder {{bed and a}} blanket design using a sintered breeder product. Under a <b>purge</b> <b>line</b> break open to a vacuum environment, the packed bed breeder temperature exceeds its operating temperature limit {{at a faster rate}} than that of the sintered breeder blanket design for the same breeder temperature gradient. Depending on the breeder material and nominal operating conditions, the breeder eaches its maximum operating temperature in time ranging from 32 seconds to 125 seconds for a break area of 10 cm 2 in packed bed designs. However for the sintered product design, the consequence of this transient might not result in the breeder exceeding its maximum operating temperature if a reasonable contact pressure could be established at the interface. To reduce the safety hazards, the tritium concentration build up in the vacuum vessel in conjunction with the purge gas pressure inside the blanket module should he used as a measure for initiating the reactor shutdown for this type of accident.

40|$|The Simplified Boiling Water Reactor (SBWR) {{proposed}} by General Electric (GE) is an advanced light water reactor (ALWR) design that utilizes passive safety systems. The PCCS {{is a series}} of heat exchangers submerged in water and open to the containment. Since the containment is inerted with nitrogen during normal operation, the PCCS must condense the steam in the presence of noncondensable gases during an accident. To model the transient behavior of the SBWR with a system code, the code should properly simulate the expected phenomena. To validate the applicability of RELAP 5 MOD 3. 1. 1, the data from three Phase 1, Step 2 nitrogen venting tests at Toshiba`s Gravity-Driven Integral Full-Height Test for Passive Heat Removal facility and RELAP 5 calculations of these tests were compared. The comparison of the GIRAFFE data against the results from the RELAP 5 calculations showed that it can predict condensation and gas purging phenomena occurring in the long-term decay heat rejection phase. In this phase of the transient, condensation in the PCCS is the only means to reject heat from the SBWR containment. In the two tests where the nitrogen purge vent line was at its deepest submergence in the Suppression Pool (SIP), the RELAP 5 results mirrored the behavior of the containment pressures and of the water levels in the Horizontal Vent (HV) and the nitrogen <b>purge</b> <b>line</b> tube of the GIRAFFE data. However, in the test with the shallowest <b>purge</b> <b>line</b> submergence, there was appreciable direct contact condensation on the pool surface of the HV despite modeling efforts to deter these phenomena.

The system proposed here {{is based on the}} synergy of four sub-systems: a seed press for oil production, a downdraft gasifier, a biodiesel conversion plant and a Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC). Two possible culture rotations, suggested by literature review, were analyzed here from economical and energy balance points of view. Both the rotations were composed of oleaginous crops only, therefore the seeds collected from the different cultures were pressed, then the protein cake produced in the process was gasified in the downdraft reactor. The gasification process was modeled here, and its output suggested that, for a precise number of hectares, the syngas obtained through the cake gasification was enough for producing methanol required for oil-biodiesel conversion and feeding a 10 -kW SOFC.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundWe {{evaluated}} patient {{outcomes and}} complications {{associated with the}} microaxial Impella Recover left ventricular assist device (Impella Cardiosystems AG, Aachen, Germany) for postcardiotomy low-output syndrome. This low-cost device is inserted across the aortic valve through a 10 -mm vascular graft sewn to the ascending aorta. MethodsImpella patients were compared with 198 patients treated with an intraoperative intra-aortic balloon pump between January 2000 and December 2002. Three risk scores were used: the Hausmann score, the Texas Heart Institute score, and the Cleveland intensive care unit score. Between September 2001 and March 2003, 24 patients were treated with the Impella Recover for low-output syndrome. Before device insertion, 21 could {{not be separated from}} cardiopulmonary bypass, and 3 had postoperative hemodynamic instability despite high-dose catecholamines. Sixteen were treated with the Impella and intra-aortic balloon pump and 8 with the Impella alone (no intra-aortic balloon pump because of peripheral vascular disease or because deemed unnecessary). ResultsNo technical problems with device insertion occurred. Pump flow was 3. 3 ± 0. 7 L/min at 28, 000 ± 4500 RPM. Support time was 61 ± 56 hours (range, 7 - 228 hours). Four devices required repositioning. One device failed (leaking <b>purge</b> <b>line)</b> and was removed. Hemolysis was minimal (lactate dehydrogenase levels of 540 ± 260 U/dL for Impella survivors). Mortality for Impella patients was 54 % (13 / 24), similar to that for high-risk intra-aortic balloon pump patients (Hausmann score ≥ 2 [57 %], intensive care unit score ≥ 2 [51 %], Texas Heart Institute score ≥ 0. 75 [55 %], and cardiac index ≤ 2. 3 [45 %]). Cardiac output data were available in 19 Impella patients. Impella patients able to increase their cardiac output to 1 L/min or more above the pump flow of the Impella Recover had a 10 % (1 / 10) mortality, versus 88 % (8 / 9) in patients with a residual cardiac function of 1 L/min or less (P =. 001). Comparison of high-risk intra-aortic balloon pump patients with Impella patients with residual cardiac function of 1 L/min or more showed a significant reduction in mortality, regardless of the high-risk definition used. Residual cardiac function was the strongest predictor of survival in Impella patients. ConclusionsThe Impella Recover device provides 3 to 4 L/min flow. It improves survival in patients with low-output syndrome if the heart is able to pump 1 L/min or more above device flow...|$|E

Here, we report on the genetic structure, using micro-satellites, of the invading population from samples collected in the years 1998 – 2000, a few years after the first sighting of the species in its new area. The data show that the Tasmanian population has a very low genetic diversity, with {{less than half of the}} allelic richness (Richness= 2. 89 alleles; Hexp= 0. 591) and lower levels of heterozygosity as compared to populations in New Zealand (4. 24 alleles; Hexp= 0. 729) and Europe (5. 08 alleles; Hexp= 0. 826). In addition, the genetic data suggest that the invasion must have happened once, probably around late 1991, and was the result of very few, perhaps only two, individuals arriving in Tasmania. Furthermore, these founders came from the New Zealand population. Today, the population in the south of Tasmania seems to act as a source population from which individuals migrate into other parts of the state. A similar source–sink structure seems also the case for New Zealand. The data show that B. terrestris is a highly invasive species capable of establishing itself even after a dramatic genetic bottleneck.

5000|$|As {{an example}} of genetic purging, {{consider}} a large population where there are recessive lethal alleles segregating at very low frequency in many loci, so that each individual carries on the average one of these alleles. Although about 63% of the individuals carry {{at least one of}} these lethal alleles, almost none carry two copies of the same lethal. Therefore, since lethals are considered completely recessive (i.e., they are harmless in heterozygosis), they cause almost no deaths. Now assume that population size reduces to a small value (say N=10), and remains that small for many generations. As inbreeding increases, the probability of being homozygous for one (or more) of these lethal alleles also increases, causing fitness to decline. However, as those lethals begin to occur in homozygosis, natural selection begins purging them. The figure to the right gives the expected decline of fitness against the number of generations, taking into account just the increase in inbreeding [...] (red line), or both inbreeding and <b>purging</b> (blue <b>line,</b> computed using the purged inbreeding coefficient [...] ). This example shows that purging can be very efficient preventing inbreeding depression. However, for non-lethal deleterious alleles, the efficiency of purging would be smaller, and it can require larger populations to overcome genetic drift.|$|R

Prior to this project, the CO at Tronox KZN Sands in South Africa was burnt {{to get rid of}} it, producing carbon dioxide (CO 2).

The price of methane gas has increased significantly; and so this research considers the possibility of recycling CO gas and using it as an energy source to reduce methane gas demand.

40|$|The {{nematode}} Steinernema carpocapsae infects {{and kills}} many pest insects in agro-ecosystems and {{is commonly used}} in biocontrol of these pests. Growth of the nematodes prior to distribution for biocontrol commonly results in deterioration of traits that are essential for nematode persistence in field applications. To better understand the mechanisms underlying trait deterioration of the efficacy of natural parasitism in entomopathogenic nematodes, we explored the maintenance of fitness related traits including reproductive capacity, heat tolerance, virulence to insects and ‘tail standing’ (formerly called nictation) among laboratory-cultured lines derived from natural, randomly mating populations of S. carpocapsae. Laboratory cultured nematode lines with fitness-related trait values below wild-type levels regained wild-type levels of reproductive and heat tolerance traits when outcrossed with a non-deteriorated line, while virulence and ‘tail standing’ did not deteriorate in our experiments. Crossbreeding two trait-deteriorated lines with each other also resulted in restoration of trait means to wild-type levels in most crossbred lines.

40|$|By {{studying}} the Orbital Express mission, modeling the spacecraft and scenarios, and testing the system, a technique {{has been developed}} that uses recursive decomposition to represent procedural actions declaratively, schema-level uncertainty reasoning to make uncertainty reasoning tractable, and lightweight, natural language processing to automatically parse procedures to produce declarative models. Schema-level uncertainty reasoning has, at its core, the basic assumption that certain variables are uncertain, but not independent. Once any are known, then the others become known. This is important where a variable is uncertain for an action and many actions of the same type exist in the plan. For example, {{if the number of}} retries to <b>purge</b> pump <b>lines</b> was unknown (but bounded), and each attempt required a sub-plan, then, once the correct number of attempts required for a purge was known, it would likely be the same for all subsequent purges. This greatly reduces the space of plans that needs to be searched to ensure that all executions are feasible. To accommodate changing scenario procedures, each is ingested into a tabular format in temporal order, and a simple natural-language parser is used to read each step and to derive the impact of that step on memory, power, and communications. Then an ASPEN (Activity Scheduling and Planning Environment) model is produced based on this analysis. The model is tested and further changed by hand, if necessary, to reflect the actual procedure. This results in a great savings of time used for modeling procedures. Many processes that need to be modeled in ASPEN (a declarative system) are, in fact, procedural. ASPEN includes the ability to model activities in a hierarchical fashion, but this representation breaks down if there is a practically unbounded number of sub-activities and decomposition topologies. However, if recursive decomposition is allowed, HTN-like encodings are enabled to represent most procedural phenomena. For example, if a switch requires a variable (but known {{at the time of the}} attempt) number of attempts to switch on, one can recurse on the number of remaining switch attempts and decompose into either the same switching activity with one less required attempt, or not decompose at all (or decompose into a dummy task), resulting in the end of the decomposition. In fact, any bounded procedural behavior can be modeled using recursive decompositions assuming that the variables impinging the disjunctive decomposition decision are computable at the time that the decision is made. This enables one to represent tasks that are controlled outside of the scheduler, but that the scheduler must accommodate, without requiring one to give a declarative model of the procedural behavior...|$|R

When a single analyser is used to monitor multiple sampling points, the deployment of buffer volumes (BV) along sampling lines can reduce the uncertainty due to the discrete temporal sampling of the signal. In order to optimize the use of buffer volumes we explored various setups by simulating their effect on time series of high-frequency CO 2 concentration collected at three Fluxnet sites. Besides, we proposed a novel scheme to calculate half hourly weighted averages from discrete point samples, 15 accounting for the probabilistic fraction of the signal generated in the averaging period. Results show {{that the use of}} BV with the new averaging scheme reduces the mean absolute errors (MAE) up to 80 % compared to set-up without BV and up to 60 % compared to the case with BV and a standard, non-weighted averaging scheme. The MAE of CO 2 concentration measurements was observed to depend on the variability of the concentration field and on the size of BV, which therefore have to be carefully dimensioned. The optimal volume size depends on two main features of the instrumental setup: the 20 number of measurement points and the time needed to sample at one point (i. e. <b>line</b> <b>purging</b> plus sampling time). A linear and consistent relationship was observed at all sites between the sampling frequency, which summarizes the two features mentioned above, and the renewal frequency associated to the volume.

Occasionally, {{it may be necessary to}} pressurize the intravenous (IV) fluid or blood product bag in order to increase flow to the patient. Several fluid warming systems use a pneumatic external compressor that auto-matically squeezes the IV fluid or blood bag. 1, 2 While these systems have been used for many years to provide faster and easier fluid delivery, problems do arise such as accidental IV delivery of air to the patient, 3 – 6 and extravasation of fluid, causing a compart-ment syndrome. 7, 8 The FMS 2000 fluid warming system (Belmont Instrument Corp., Billerica, MA) is a new IV fluid and blood warmer that uses an integrated peristaltic pump to eliminate the requirement for compression and pressurization of the fluid bag (Fig. 1). The system automatically heats fluid to normother-mia at all flows> 10 ml/min. For flow ≥ 60 ml/min, the fluid is heated to 37. 5 oC. For flows between 10 and 50 ml/min, fluid is heated to 39 oC.

40|$|The ODH {{problem in}} this case {{involves}} the instrument air line to the clean room. which is isolated by a check valve from the gaseous nitrogen trailer backup source (valve CV 787 I, see DRG. NO. 3740. 510 -MA- 273995, attached (the 'to <b>purging</b> enclosure' <b>line</b> nms to the clean room)). Normally, the check valve prevents backflow through the instrument air line. But as we all know, valves can fail. The estimated mean failure rate for a check valve to allow reverse flow is 3 {center_dot} 10 {sup - 7 }. Failure of the instrument air and the check valve would allow the seepage ofgaseous nitrogen into the clean room. The failure of the instrument air is necessary to cause an ODH problem, {{due to the fact}} that the air pressure would keep the lower pressured gaseous nitrogen from flowing through the check valve. The compressor for the instrument air is fairly reliable, but to show the true nature of how safe this situation is, both cases that follow will assume that the compressor, and therefore the instrument air, has already failed. Table A shows the standard ODH situation. Assuming everything is working correctly (all the gasses are flowing, the ventilation is active, etc.), the only consideration is the failure of the check valve concurrent with the instrument air failure. The table clearly shows an ODH classification of 0, which would hold even for an extreme leakage, and which does not even consider the likelihood of the instrument air failure. which would lower the fatality rate even more. Note that the leak rate given in the tables following (50 scfm) is an overly generous amount considering the restricting nature of the small pipes and valve orifices. and that it is half of the compressor capacity. Table B is the same situation in the event of a power failure, estimated for eight times a year (1 {center_dot} 10 {sup - 3 } fails/hour), which would deactivate any electrically powered building devices, such as fans and air compressors. This scenario assumes that the instrument air fails, the ventilation exhaust shuts down, and the check valve fails at the same time. The probability for this occurrence coinciding with the power failure is a multiple of the two failure rates. i. e. 3 {center_dot} 10 {sup - 7 } x 1 {center_dot} 10 {sup - 3 } = 3 {center_dot} 10 {sup - 10 }. Note that the ventilation failure would require that the minimum exhaust from the clean room to be identical to the leak resulting from the check valve failure, as an approximation of the leakage 'forcing' an exhaust rate. Again, the table shows that the ODH classification is well within the 0 range. None of these analyses suggest that this check valve poses a safety hazard in any manner, so no ODH equipment need be implemented...|$|R
