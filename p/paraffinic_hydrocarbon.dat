The purpose of this work is to clarify the φ - T dependence of soot formation for various kinds of fuels, including <b>paraffinic</b> <b>hydrocarbon,</b> aromatic hydrocarbon and oxygenated hydrocarbon, and to discuss a possibility for smokeless diesel combustion. The sooting φ - T map, showing the tendency to generate soot particles as a function of φ and T, was made using a detailed soot kinetic model. The computational results show that oxygenated fuel reactions lead to a lower soot yield, and narrower sooting φ - T region than those of aliphatic and aromatic fuels, due to the notable reduction in production both acetylene and polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). Furthermore, this lower sooting tendency is emphasized as the fuel oxygen content increase. It was also found that the leaner mixture side of the soot formation peninsula on theφ - T map, rather than the lower temperature side, should be utilized to suppress the formation of PAHs and ultra-fine particles together with a large reduction in particulate mass...|$|E

30|$|The {{focus of}} this work was to {{synthesize}} petroleum mesophase pitches from paraffinic clarified oil by transition metal catalysts (i.e., Cr and Cu) as precursor material for advanced carbon products and also study {{the effect of these}} catalysts on physico-chemical properties. Generally, <b>paraffinic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> are undesirable for making mesophase pitches but their attachments on aromatic molecules are necessary because they generate free radicals for polymerization reaction. Optical microscopic results show that Cu and Cr enhance the growth of mesophase spheres and also increase the mesophase contents. Therefore, Cu and Cr promote the parallely stacked aromatic mesophase formation in pitches through a series of reactions such as cracking, polymerization, condensation, etc. The higher value of crystallite thickness of CLO-Cu- 3 and CLO-Cr- 3 as compared to CLO- 0 - 0 also indicates that there is a high degree of polymerization. NMR, FT-IR and CHNS analyses also support the higher degree of polymerization for CLO-Cu- 3 and CLO-Cr- 3 mesophase pitches. In addition, SEM images clearly indicated that catalysts increase the size of pitch flakes but they are not attached on the surface of pitch molecules. Therefore, the present study shows that Cu and Cr catalysts have higher catalytic activity for mesophase formation growth.

Although most {{renewable}} fuels meet the conventional fuel requirements for internal combustion engine applications, differences in fuel properties between renewable fuels and petroleum-based fuels still exist. The effect of renewable fuels on conventional diesel engines has been investigated by many researchers. However, {{few studies have been}} conducted on the effect of renewable fuels on combustion and emission performance of homogeneous charge compression ignition(HCCI) engines. In this paper, the combustion and emission characteristics of an HCCI engine are experimentally investigated when four neat renewable fuel components and their blends with a petroleum-based diesel were used. The ratios of renewable fuel components in the blends were changed from zero to 100 %. The experiments were conducted over a wide range of operational conditions. Energy efficiency and regulated emissions data were collected and analyzed. The results suggest that compared to the petroleum-based diesel fuel, all four investigated renewable fuel components increase the fraction of heat release during low temperature stage and reduce the ignition temperature when applied to an HCCI engine. As a result, the investigated renewable fuel components advance combustion phasing of an HCCI engine. While three of the four investigated renewable fuel components improve the energy efficiency when blended with the petroleum-based diesel, one renewable fuel component deteriorates energy efficiency.

30|$|Due to the {{expected}} depletion of fossil fuel {{sources in the}} near future, increasing {{attention is paid to}} the development of alternative sources of energy. Bioethanol and biodiesel (fatty acid alkyl ester, FAAE) are among others the most interesting organic compounds, currently comprising about 90 % of the biofuel market (Antoni et al. 2007;Uthoff et al. 2009). Today the industrial production of biodiesel is restricted to the transesterification of fatty acids derived from oleaginous plants like rapeseed, oil palm and soya or from animal fats (Luque et al. 2008). Because of the low price for methanol, fatty acid methyl esters are mostly produced (Al-Zuhair 2007), but other short-chain length alcohols can be used as well for the production of biodiesel with altered properties (Röttig et al. 2010). The transesterification can be done either by chemical or enzymatic catalysis or in vivo, by the use of microbial cells (Adamczak et al. 2009). Alternatively, oils or fats can be hydrotreated (hydrogen de-oxygenation) to produce renewable diesel or jet fuel. Renewable diesel is higher quality fuel component compared to biodiesel. Renewable diesel consists of <b>paraffinic</b> <b>hydrocarbons</b> alike fossil diesel and is thus fully compatible with existing fuel distribution systems and engines. Despite their application for biodiesel production on industrial scale, the use of plant derived fatty acids cannot satisfy the future energy demand because the agricultural area needed for sufficient production of triacylglycerols (TAGs) for biodiesel would have to be much larger than the currently cultivated area (Rude and Schirmer 2009). Furthermore, the use of these agricultural areas for biodiesel production competes with their use for food production (McDonald et al. 2009).|$|R
