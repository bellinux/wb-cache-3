40|$|The non-existence of {{relevant}} data {{capable of a}} global appreciation of sprayers in Portugal {{is one of the}} key issues for the preparation of this study and to improve the good agricultural practices at the plant protection. Nowadays the <b>pesticides</b> <b>application</b> in agriculture is one of the most used agricultural practices by farmers to optimize plant health, which are still the major cause of disruptions in agroecosystems sustainability and biodiversity. The effectiveness of <b>pesticides</b> <b>application</b> depends on several factors among which the farmer can control, the <b>application</b> <b>equipment,</b> his know-how, the biological target, the choice of the pesticide and the choice of the best moment to perform the <b>pesticide</b> <b>application.</b> Thus the best maintenance <b>application</b> <b>equipment</b> and calibration for one specific purpose will maximize the effectiveness of <b>pesticides</b> <b>application.</b> This study is based on statistical analysis of periodic evaluations carried out by sprayer inspections in Portugal in the past four years, using nozzles pressure tests, flow rate tests and visual evaluation of the sprayer. The correct approach to the <b>application</b> <b>equipment</b> for <b>pesticides</b> is getting more attention internationally and in Portugal too. This growing concern became visible when the sprayer inspections started to be available to all Portuguese farmers.

The characteristics of the cultivation environments allow to get quality products. This is {{made possible by the}} constant technical updating operated by technical support of Consulting & Services Centre – CTT. This is one of reasons why IPM has come in the practice since the early 90 ’s and on this view the inspection of sprayers is mandatory and regularly made with five years interval. Many housing districts are scattered among orchards and population of rural surroundings has become more and more sensitive to issues about environmental sustainability and spray drift. Therefore vertical bench tests started to follow the standard procedures of inspection and calibration to carry the operators to a more efficient way of application reducing drift losses. Moreover in the last years has become needful to start a series of test in order to find technical solutions for drift mitigation. In our view the next step to allow an adequate and efficient use of drift reducing devices, and bring them in the practice, is to link inspection and calibration with drift reduction experiences. Informations, suggestions and adjustments are achievable by the technical staff of the inspection facilities (e. g. choice of a proper filter mesh size according with the nozzle type, etc.) during inspection activity. On this view training during inspection has a key role to make the operator conscious of the most appropriate technical choices for efficient use of <b>pesticide</b> <b>application</b> <b>equipments...</b>|$|R

50|$|Traditional {{agricultural}} crop pesticides {{can either be}} applied pre-emergent or post-emergent, a term referring to the germination status of the plant. Pre-emergent <b>pesticide</b> <b>application,</b> in conventional agriculture, attempts to reduce competitive pressure on newly germinated plants by removing undesirable organisms and maximizing the amount of water, soil nutrients, and sunlight available for the crop. An example of pre-emergent <b>pesticide</b> <b>application</b> is atrazine application for corn. Similarly, glyphosate mixtures are often applied pre-emergent on agricultural fields to remove early-germinating weeds and prepare for subsequent crops. Pre-emergent <b>application</b> <b>equipment</b> often has large, wide tires designed to float on soft soil, minimizing both soil compaction and damage to planted (but not yet emerged) crops. A three-wheel application machine, {{such as the one}} pictured on the right, is designed so that tires do not follow the same path, minimizing the creation of ruts in the field and limiting sub-soil damage.|$|R
40|$|The Objective of {{this study}} was to {{identify}} the needs for and solutions to pesticide risk reduction for farmers in Vietnam, using a comprehensive needs assessment model applied for evaluating community needs and policy development. Four kinds of needs were evaluated using qualitative research methods. A comparative analysis of pesticide regulations was used to identify comparative needs. In-depth interviews with authorities and experts were conducted to identify normative needs. Observations on farmer's practice were used to identify expressed needs, and focus group discussions among farmers were implemented to identify felt needs. The needs for pesticide regulations obtained from comparative analysis and experts include enhancement of pesticide legislation; multisectoral involvement in pesticide regulations; improvement of capacity for sectors involving in pesticide regulations; risk-benefit guidance for pesticide registration; reforms of pesticide regulations relating to the restriction, cancellation, suspension, transport, storage, and disposal of pesticides; and the development of occupational hygiene and safety policy and programs for agricultural activities. The expressed needs based on field observations comprise improvement in knowledge and behavior of farmers about pesticide safety with specific areas, and supports in safety facilities and personal protective equipment. The key request from farmers include needs about technical training for occupational safety and hygiene of <b>pesticide</b> <b>application,</b> and support for safety facilities for <b>pesticide</b> <b>application</b> and protective <b>equipment.</b> The results of comprehensive needs assessment were useful in the development of a range of strategies in legislative improvement, workplace and personal hygiene, information and training, and medical surveillance and pesticide poisoning first aids for pesticide risk reduction for Vietnamese farmers.

40|$|According to the UN Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), the {{technology}} used to spray pesticides in most developing countries reflects technical standards of 40 years ago, resulting in pesticide waste and environmental damage. FAO {{called for the}} adoption of minimum standards for the safe and efficient application of agrochemicals through good quality equipment and better training of farmers. According to FAO, farmers and equipment operators have insufficient knowledge about pesticides and correct methods of application. Extension services rarely have technicians with any specialized knowledge of application technology. In many countries the only specialist offering advice to farmers on application technology, handling and calibration of their equipment are the representatives of pesticides companies. Many farmers mistakenly believe that high volumes, high pressure and high doses, are the most appropriate way to apply pesticides. In addition, in many countries, much of the spraying equipment is in extremely poor condition with worn-out sprayer nozzles not being replaced, or worse, enlarged deliberately to achieve higher flow rates. FAO has developed Guidelines for the basic requirements for <b>pesticide</b> <b>application</b> <b>equipment</b> and Standards for <b>pesticide</b> <b>application</b> <b>equipment</b> which includes test procedures. They suggest that incentives for improved equipment quality should be created.

It is also necessary to inform about the benefits of keeping machinery in good condition and about <b>pesticide</b> <b>application</b> <b>equipment</b> in professional use that is subject to compulsory inspections (Directive 2009 / 128 /CE). Spanish Royal Decree 60 / 2011, which transposes to Spanish legislation the Directive 2008 / 105 /CE, lays down environmental quality standards (i. e. maximum allowable concentrations) for priority substances and certain other pollutants in surface water. Some of these substances can be found in plant protection products (PPP). In this context, and in the framework of the activities of the Syngenta-UPC Chair, a training project for the improvement of agricultural practices has arisen. The assumption is that the improvement of these practices means a significant and perceivable reduction of PPP pollution in waters, especially in areas where high levels of these substances have been detected. The aim of this project was to demonstrate this hypothesis with a pilot test in the Ebro basin, specifically in the area of the rivers Flumen and Alcanadre. This is an agricultural area where some water pollution problems caused by PPP have been detected in recent years. The project started in 2013 with the cooperation of the Government of Aragon. The active substance concentrations detected in the Ebro Hydrographic Confederation station in Sariñena exceeded the Royal Decree 60 / 2011 limits. It should be pointed out that on many occasions when PPPs have been applied to summer crops, high PPP concentrations were detected. For this reason, it makes sense to relate pollution to agricultural practices. This situation is worsened by the environmental conditions in the area and especially by the strong northerly wind popularly known as the cierzo that can cause important PPP damage to surface waters.

40|$|To {{investigate}} {{factors associated}} with pesticide-related visits to health care providers (i. e., doctor or hospital visits), responses to self-administered questionnaires received from 35, 879 licensed restricted-use pesticide applicators participating in the Agricultural Health Study were analyzed. (In Iowa, applicators are actually certified, whereas in North Carolina they are licensed; for ease of reference, the term license {{will be used for}} both states in this paper.) The cohort reported a total of more than 10. 9 million pesticide-application days. These applications were associated with one or more pesticide-related health care visits by 2, 214 applicators (7. 0 % of the applicator cohort for whom health care visit data were available). The odds of a pesticide-related health care visit were increased for commercial applicators compared to private applicators [odds ratio (0 R = 1. 77; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 52 - 2. 06) and for applicators who used insecticides 70 times or more in their lifetime compared to those who used insecticides less frequently (OR = 1. 43; CI, 1. 26 - 1. 63). After adjusting for the number of applications in a logistic regression model, significantly higher odds of health care visits were observed among North Carolina applicators compared to Iowa applicators (OR= 1. 35; CI, 1. 17 - 1. 52), among applicators who mixed their own pesticides (OR = 1. 65; CI, 1. 22 - 2. 23), and among applicators who personally repaired their <b>pesticide</b> <b>application</b> <b>equipment</b> at least once per year (OR= 1. 12; Cl, 1. 06 - 1. 25). Significantly lower odds were found among female versus male applicators (OR = 0. 68; Cl, 0. 46 - 0. 99) and among applicators who graduated from high school versus those who did not (OR= 0. 82; CI, 0. 71 - 0. 94 for high school graduates and OR = 0. 79; CI, 0. 68 - 0. 91 for those with at least some college). Several methods of pesticide application to crops, seed, or stored grain were also associated with significantly elevated odds ratios of health care visits. These observations suggest that several steps can be taken {{to reduce the number of}} health care visits resulting from occupational exposure to pesticides. The implications of this pattern of pesticide-related health care visits may have etiologic implications for cancer and other chronic diseases...|$|E
50|$|Post-emergent <b>pesticide</b> <b>application</b> {{requires}} {{the use of}} specific chemicals chosen minimize harm to the desirable target organism. An example is 2,4-Dichlorophenoxyacetic acid, which will injure broadleaf weeds (dicots) but leave behind grasses (monocots). Such a chemical has been used extensively on wheat crops, for example. A number of companies have also created genetically modified organisms that are resistant to various pesticides. Examples include glyphosate-resistant soybeans and Bt maize, which change the types of formulations involved in addressing post-emergent pesticide pressure. It is important to also note that even given appropriate chemical choices, high ambient temperatures or other environmental influences, can allow the non-targeted desirable organism to be damaged during application. As plants have already germinated, post-emergent <b>pesticide</b> <b>application</b> necessitates limited field contact in order to minimize losses due to crop and soil damage. Typical industrial <b>application</b> <b>equipment</b> will utilize very tall and narrow tires and combine this with a sprayer body which can be raised and lowered depending on crop height. These sprayers usually carry the label ‘high-clearance’ as they can rise over growing crops, although usually not much more than 1 or 2 meters high. In addition, these sprayers often have very wide booms in order to minimize the number of passes required over a field, again designed to limit crop damage and maximize efficiency. In industrial agriculture, spray booms 120 feet (40 meters) wide are not uncommon, especially in prairie agriculture with large, flat fields. Related to this, aerial <b>pesticide</b> <b>application</b> is a method of top dressing a pesticide to an emerged crop which eliminates physical contact with soil and crops.|$|R
