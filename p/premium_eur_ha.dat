40|$|Generalized {{vitiligo}} (GV) {{is characterized}} by autoimmune destruction of melanocytes by skin-homing cytotoxic T-cells (CTLs) that target melanocyte autoantigens. Two recent genomewide association studies (GWAS) of GV in European-derived whites (<b>EUR)</b> <b>have</b> demonstrated genetic association with GZMB, encoding granzyme B, a marker of activated CTLs that mediates target-cell apoptosis, as well as autoantigen activation and consequent initiation and propagation of autoimmunity. Here, we describe detailed genetic analyses of the GZMB region of chromosome 14 q 12 to identify genetic variation potentially causal for GV, implicating two non-synonymous SNPs in strong linkage disequilibrium that comprise part of a common multi-variant high-risk haplotype, rs 8192917 -C — rs 11539752 -C (55 R- 94 A). To identify possible uncommon deleterious variants that might “hitchhike ” on the high-risk haplotype, we then carried out “next-generation” DNA re-sequencing of GZMB in 114 EUR GV patients. Overall, our findings support a direct causal role for the GZMB rs 8192917 -C—rs 11539752 -C haplotype (55 R- 94 A) in the pathogenesis of GV...|$|R

EUR’s current environmental sustainability policy needs more impetus. The university wants to incorporate sustainability into its new strategy (2013 - 2018) to become more competitive. But with reduced government funding, <b>EUR</b> <b>has</b> fewer resources to promote sustainability. The crux of EUR’s dilemma is how more than 20, 000 EUR students and 2, 500 employees can be sensitised to, and induced to act upon, sustainability - even though it is not necessarily a priority for them. EUR is a university with a strong business, economics, law and medicine focus – therefore, the students’ primary goal is traditionally a good career first. The crucial question is thus how to win a place in the students’ and employees’ hearts and minds for sustainability in the broader sense...|$|R

40|$|In {{this paper}} an {{application}} of Newman-Janis algorithm in spherical symmetric metrics with the functions M(u,r) and <b>e(u,r)</b> <b>has</b> been discussed. After {{the transformation of the}} metric via this algorithm, these two functions M(u,r) and e(u,r) will be of the three variables u,r,θ. With these functions of three variables, all the Newman-Penrose (NP) spin coefficients, the Ricci as well as the Weyl scalars have been calculated from the Cartan’s structure equations. From these NP quantities, a class of rotating solutions of Einstein’s field equations can be obtained. These solutions include (a) Kerr-Newman, (b) rotating Vaidya solution, (c) rotating Vaidya-Bonnor solution, (d) rotating Husain’s solution, (e) rotating Wang-Wu solutions. It is found that the technique developed by Wang and Wu can be used to generate new embedded solutions, that the Kerr-Newman solution can be combined smoothly with the rotating Vaidya solution to generate Kerr-Newman-Vaidya solution, and similarly, Kerr-Newman-Vaidya-Bonnor solution of the field equations. It has also shown that the embedded universes like Kerr-Newman de Sitter, rotating Vaidya-Bonnorde Sitter, Kerr-Newman-Vaidya-de Sitter can be derived from the general solutions with Wang-Wu function. All rotating embedded solutions derived here can be written in Kerr-Schild forms, showing the extension of Xanthopoulos’s theorem. It is also found that all the rotating solutions admit non-perfect fluids. PACS number: 0420, 0420 J, 0430, 0440 N 1...|$|R
