40|$|During {{manufacturing}} and in use fiber composites emit voltatile organic compounds (VOC). Many factors {{can affect the}} emission such as the raw materials used (fibers, polymer, additives), the pulping process applied for pulp production and aging conditions. The work presented deals with emission of VOC from wood fibers as well as medium density fiberboards (MDF) <b>made</b> <b>therefrom.</b> Moreover, the emission from hemp fibers and composites <b>made</b> <b>therefrom</b> was also assessed. The results reveal that the chemical composition of VOC and their amounts depend highly on the raw material (pine wood and hemp straw) used {{as well as on}} the pulping process (thermo-mechanical process (TMP) and chemo-thermo-mechanical process (CTMP)) and pulping conditions applied. The objective of further work was to reduce the amount of VOC through adding highly reactive polyphenolic polymers such as condensed tannins during wood and hemp straw pulping. The results indicate that addition of tannins in the CTMP process improves the mechanical properties of the medium density fiberboards and lower theit emission.

40|$|Dry {{oxidizing}} {{methods have}} been widely used to modify surface properties of polymer and ceramic substrates. Compared to other dry oxidizing methods, ultraviolet light/ozone (UV/O- 3) treatment has hitherto attracted less attention, mainly due to relatively weak oxidizing power. With optimized processing conditions, however, UV/O- 3 treatment can be better capable of offering desired effects associated with appropriate surface modifications. Incorporation of nanoscale reinforcements, e. g., carbon nanotubes (CNTs) and graphite, into a polymer matrix creates a new class of composites that possess unique mechanical and functional capabilities. A proper surface treatment is critical to dispersing the reinforcements in the matrix, hence to provide adequate adhesion between the reinforcements and the matrix. In this article, a review is provided on the underlying mechanisms of and the advantages arising from UV/O- 3 treatment of polymer substrates and nanoscale carbon materials. Special focus is placed on the relationship between the changes in chemical composition, morphology, functional groups of the treated surface and the corresponding improvements in adhesion and wettability of the substrate, dispersion of nano-reinforcements, as well as the properties of the nanocomposites <b>made</b> <b>therefrom...</b>|$|R
40|$|Fibreboards {{were made}} from Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris [L. ]) using the thermo-mechanical (TMP) and chemo-thermomechanical pulping (CTMP).

40|$|Understanding the {{formation}} of SEI films on Li 4 Ti 5 O 12 (LTO) anodes offers a major benefit to large-scale applications of lithium ion batteries <b>made</b> <b>therefrom.</b> This paper reveals that an SEI film is formed above 1 V due to the interfacial reaction between the electrode and electrolyte: LTO anodes are previously considered free from SEI films when cycled between 1 and 3 V. The reactivity and {{the formation}} of SEI films are much affected by the morphology and surface area of the electrode. To study the above, LTO powders with different morphologies are synthesized using lithium acetate (LA) and lithium hydroxide (LH) as the lithium sources. LTO-LH consisting of agglomerates of primary small particles with a large surface area has higher reactivity than LTO-LA with a cubic structure and small surface area. As a result, the LTO-LH anode with a smooth SEI film offers better cyclic performance than the LTO-LA anode with a porous SEI film. The addition of vinylene carbonate to the electrolyte facilitates rapid formation of a protective SEI film on LTO LA, greatly improving the rate and cyclic performance: stable specific capacity of 155. 6 mAh g(- 1) and remarkable 135. 2 mAh g(- 1) after 500 cycles at 10 C are recorded.
