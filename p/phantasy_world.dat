It examines the kinds of ideas which underpin teaching {{and the ways in which}} these ideas are woven into a narrative in pedagogical practice. We treat ideas as pedagogical knowledge objects which create the ground for a meaningful relationship between teacher and student. We argue that business education relies on a system of closed pedagogical objects which create and sustain a <b>phantasy</b> <b>world</b> in whose mirror managers see themselves as privileged experts able to understand and cope with the complexity of work organisations and to assume the role of leading social ordering processes. This position reflects business education’s own cultural history and preferences; it is held together by a world-historical narrative which reproduces the neo-liberal agenda of the latter part of the twentieth century. But reliance on ‘closed’ pedagogical objects (or phantasies of mastery) also means that business education has been and is gradually losing the ability to provide an intellectually credible account of social practices in work organisations. Is it possible to think of an alternative? In the final part of the paper, we briefly discuss an alternative perspective: an approach which uses ‘open’ pedagogical objects to design and deliver academic courses in management and organisation studies...|$|E
40|$|It is with {{pleasure}} to announce this special volume of European Polymer Journal including 17 selected papers based on contributions, which were {{given at the}} 3 rd International Conference on Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM) of Polymers at Rolduc Abbey in Kerkrade, in The Netherlands. At this symposium we as organizers strove to support a dialog among polymer scientists with diverse backgrounds, however with one “thing” in common, i. e. the use of various scanning probe techniques in their research aiming at studies of macromolecular systems on the nanoscale. A session was also devoted to single molecule optics related to polymers. The assumption was that SPM-related techniques still provide enough coherence for a meeting {{despite the fact that}} SPM has reached a certain level of maturity. Science and technology in nanometer dimensions are at the frontiers of progress in the 21 st century. Nanotechnology is emerging as the next wave following the era of semiconductors and biotechnology, and is usually considered as the ultimate production technology of the future. Nanotechnology has brought about emotions, as well: skeptics sometimes classify it as a trendy “buzzword”. In addition, it has also been “plagued” by the negative effects of science fiction like arguments mixing it up with the <b>phantasy</b> <b>world</b> of self-replicating machines, evil nanorobots and other nonsense. On the more serious note, some people question whether nanotechnology would be able to eventually fulfill the high hopes and promises. Progress and achievements in science and technology of the nanoworld has, however, been impressive refuting skeptics by strong arguments and facts. This young interdisciplinary field has gained widespread, solid, serious recognition...|$|E

40|$|Attempts {{to present}} a {{rational}} explanation of Emily Brontë's Wuthering Heights have been a growing concern since its publication in 1847. The abundant, yet incoherent, interpretations of Wuthering Heights, make the need for this research timely. This article focuses on ways to achieve a truer and more rational interpretation of the novel. The study indicates {{that in order to}} solve the enigma of the novel, the conscious and unconscious thoughts of the author, performing within the text, have to be discovered. The research approach adopted in this study is what is referred to as psychobiography or the Freudian psychoanalytic criticism. The findings of this research underline that Emily Brontë grew up in an oppressive milieu, and she compulsively created <b>phantasy</b> <b>worlds</b> within which she continuously repeated certain patterns. The main conclusion to be drawn from this article is that Emily Brontë was a neurotic person whose unconscious obsessions are projected in Wuthering Heights...|$|R

Kotoko began her singing {{career as a}} member of I've Sound in 2000, and was later signed to Rondorobe under Geneon from 2004 to 2010. Kotoko left Geneon in 2010, left I've Sound and signed to Warner Home Video in 2011. She composes and writes lyrics (for herself as well as other singers in I've Sound) for numerous other song collections. She has contributed songs to numerous anime and video games including Please Teacher!, Maria-sama ga Miteru, Hourglass of Summer, Hayate the Combat Butler, Kannazuki no Miko, Shakugan no Shana, , To Love-Ru, Accel <b>World,</b> <b>Phantasy</b> Star Online and Argevollen, among others.|$|R

Besides being a place of information, the Internet can also be a means of entertainment. One of them is online games. Not all online games can be enjoyed freely by every players in the <b>world.</b> <b>Phantasy</b> Star Online 2 server Japan (PSO 2 JP) is one example. The problem is that this game has a region lock. One commonly method is to bypass the region lock by using a proxy. By installing a proxy on the server, player can pass the blocking. Utilization of proxifier makes connection activity {{in and out of the}} proxy can be seen through by the log of proxifier. Proxy uses tunneling process whose task is to handle and provides a connection point-to-point from the source to its destination. Tunneling is encapsulation or wrapping a packet protocol in the protocol, so the request is made may pass through the region hitch lock and arrived at the destination...|$|R
