5|$|The {{postage stamps}} of Ireland are {{issued by the}} <b>postal</b> <b>operator</b> of the {{independent}} Irish state. Ireland {{was part of the}} United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland when the world's first postage stamps were issued in 1840. These stamps, and all subsequent British issues, were used in Ireland until the new Irish Government assumed power in 1922. Beginning on 17 February 1922, existing British stamps were overprinted with Irish text to provide some definitives until separate Irish issues became available. Following the overprints, a regular series of definitive stamps was produced by the new Department of Posts and Telegraphs, using domestic designs. These definitives were issued on 6 December 1922; the first was a 2d stamp, depicting a map of Ireland (including Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom). Since then new images, and additional values as needed, have produced of nine definitive series of different designs.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{analyzed}} the strategic competition between incumbent <b>postal</b> <b>operators</b> and market entrants in liberalized letter markets {{based on the}} “defender consumer model” pioneered by Hauser and Shugan (1983) and derived qualitative normative implications on how an established firm should defend its profits when facing an attack by a new competitive product. Our results extend the literature on competition in liberalized mail markets by combining pricing and positioning strategies from a marketing perspective. Our analysis highlights that incumbent <b>postal</b> <b>operators</b> can defend their market shares by differentiating their services along one or more quality dimensions. Postal services are not necessarily homogenous. If <b>postal</b> <b>operators</b> focus solely on pricing strategies they will run into the more serious problems than if they compete on quality too.

This study evaluates this hypothesis for European <b>postal</b> <b>operators.</b> In particular, it takes advantage of the coexistence of various degrees of competition in national postal markets and the differences in regulations established among countries. For this purpose, a stochastic production frontier model is estimated, using a database of 17 European national <b>postal</b> <b>operators.</b> The results show that the degree of competition in domestic markets and the independence of national regulatory authorities are the main factors to explain the increase in efficiency in the postal sector. This reinforces the need for transposing the European regulatory framework into all national postal markets and opening them up to competition with no further delay. ...|$|R
