5|$|Liver {{disease may}} present itself as tiredness, {{increased}} bleeding tendency or confusion (due to hepatic encephalopathy) and <b>portal</b> <b>hypertension.</b> The latter, {{a condition in}} which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased, leads to esophageal varices, blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion, as well as enlargement of the spleen (splenomegaly) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity (ascites). On examination, signs of chronic liver disease such as spider angiomata (small distended blood vessels, usually on the chest) may be observed. Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms. While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma (liver cancer), this risk is relatively very low in Wilson's disease.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} {{produced by}} AVMs {{in the liver}} depend {{on the type of}} abnormal connection that they form between blood vessels. If the connection is between arteries and veins, a large amount of blood bypasses the body's organs, for which the heart compensates by increasing the cardiac output. Eventually congestive cardiac failure develops ("high-output cardiac failure"), with breathlessness and leg swelling among other problems. If the AVM creates a connection between the portal vein and the blood vessels of the liver, the result may be <b>portal</b> <b>hypertension</b> (increased portal vein pressure), in which collateral blood vessels form in the esophagus (esophageal varices), which may bleed violently; furthermore, the increased pressure may give rise to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity (ascites). If the flow in the AVM is in the other direction, portal venous blood flows directly into the veins rather than running through the liver; this may lead to hepatic encephalopathy (confusion due to portal waste products irritating the brain). Rarely, the bile ducts are deprived of blood, leading to severe cholangitis (inflammation of the bile ducts). Liver AVMs are detectable in over 70% of people with HHT, but only 10% experience problems as a result.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. <b>Portal</b> vein <b>hypertension</b> {{generally}} {{occurs in}} liver diseases like hepatic cirrhosis. It causes hemodynamic {{changes that are}} closely related to liver disease. At advanced stages of hepatic cirrhosis, <b>portal</b> vein <b>hypertension</b> leads to the atrophy of the right lobe of the liver and the hypertrophy of the left lobe through a process that has not yet been fully explained. Based on the hemodynamic changes that are known to occur, we hypothesize that liver volume is related to the distribution of blood flowing from the splenic vein (SV) that carries hepatotrophic factors from the spleen and pancreas. We studied blood flow in the portal vein system to validate this hypothesis through in vitro experimentation and a computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis involving both simplified and patient-specific models based on four healthy subjects and two patients with liver cirrhosis. The results confirmed the hypothesis that right-lobe atrophy is significantly influenced by the distribution of blood from the SV. Moreover, the patients with liver cirrhosis had a significantly larger mass fraction of spleen-derived blood in the left portal vein branch (LPV) than healthy subjects, a result consistent with right-lobe atrophy and left-lobe hypertrophy...|$|R
