40|$|What are {{the effects}} of no-take marine {{reserves}} on trophic relationships of coral reef fish? Previous studies often have lacked detailed dietary information on major predators, and have often been confounded by differences in habitat complexity between reserve and fished sites. This study investigates {{the effects of}} marine reserve protection on predator-prey interactions of coral reef fish on the inshore islands of the Great Barrier Reef (GBR). The abundance of species of prey fish of Plectropomus leopardus (Serranidae), a piscivore and the major target of the hook and line fisheries on the GBR, were estimated in <b>protected</b> and <b>fished</b> <b>zones.</b> These prey species were identified from previous detailed studies of the diet of P. leopardus. Fish populations and habitat characteristics were surveyed by underwater visual census. Previous studies had determined that the biomass of P. leopardus was 3 – 4 times higher in <b>protected</b> than <b>fished</b> <b>zones</b> in the Whitsunday and Palm Islands, central GBR, after 14 years of protection. Eight of the nine prey species had a higher density within <b>fished</b> <b>zones</b> than <b>protected</b> zones, six significantly so. The density of all prey fish was twice that in the <b>fished</b> than the <b>protected</b> <b>zone</b> (p < 0. 001). There {{were no significant differences}} in availability of different sized refuge holes, structural complexity or live coral cover between zones. Thus, important attributes of habitat complexity did not confound the comparisons between reserve and <b>fished</b> <b>zones.</b> Finally, a significant negative correlation (r = 0. 46) between coral trout biomass and summed prey fish biomass suggested that predation may be an important structuring process in this system. The results have implications for the conservation of fishery targets and their prey. The study highlights the potential ecosystem implications of the use of no-take marine reserves as conservation and fisheries management tools...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe bioeconomic {{effects of}} {{establishing}} a three-zone Marine Protected Area (MPA) are investigated. The division of the area into zones, fully protected, partially <b>protected,</b> and a <b>fishing</b> <b>zone,</b> permits a combination of extractive (fishing) and touristic activities. The consequences for species conservation, commercial fishing, and touristic activities are analysed {{for a set of}} different area-size distributions and fishing-effort levels. The model parameters are based on Medes Islands MPA in the northwestern Mediterranean. For the case study, the economic analysis includes revenues from scuba diving, glass-bottom boat trips, and commercial fisheries. Our results help to illustrate the benefits of the coexistence of extractive and non-extractive activities in a realistic, three-level MPA...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{deals with}} a dynamic {{reaction}} model of a fishery. The dynamics of a fishery resource system in an aquatic environment consists of two zones: a free <b>fishing</b> <b>zone</b> and a reserve <b>zone.</b> To <b>protect</b> <b>fish</b> population from over exploitation, a control instrument tax is imposed. The existence of its steady states and their stability are studied. The optimal harvest policy is discussed next {{with the help of}} Pontryagin's maximum principle.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of marine protected areas (MPAs) can {{often lead to}} environmental differences between MPAs and <b>fishing</b> <b>zones.</b> To determine the effects on marine dispersal of environmental dissimilarity between an MPA and <b>fishing</b> <b>zone,</b> we examined the abundance and recruitment patterns of two anemonefishes (Amphiprion frenatus and A. perideraion) that inhabit sea anemones in different management zones (i. e., an MPA and two <b>fishing</b> <b>zones)</b> by performing a field survey and a genetic parentage analysis. We found lower levels of abundance per anemone in the MPA compared to the <b>fishing</b> <b>zones</b> for both species (n= 1, 525 anemones, p=. 032). The parentage analysis also showed that lower numbers of fishes were recruited from the <b>fishing</b> <b>zones</b> {{and outside of the}} study area into each anemone in the MPA than into each anemone in the <b>fishing</b> <b>zones</b> (n= 1, 525 anemones, p<. 017). However, the number of self-recruit production per female did not differ between the MPA and <b>fishing</b> <b>zones</b> (n= 384 females, p=. 516). Because the ocean currents around the study site were unlikely to cause a lower settlement intensity of larvae in the MPA, the ocean circulation was not considered crucial to the observed abundance and recruitment patterns. Instead, stronger top-down control and/or a lower density of host anemones in the MPA were potential factors for such patterns. Our results highlight the importance of dissimilarity in a marine environment as a factor that affects connectivity...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{the north}} coast of Java island there are many small groups of coastal fishermen, who don't have a luxury to have {{information}} such as Sea Surface Temperature (SST) and potential <b>fishing</b> <b>zone.</b> Their operational cost inreased because have to look around and spent some extra fuel {{to search for the}} presence of fish. SST as a parameter for potential <b>fishing</b> <b>zone</b> can be obtained from the calculation of the thermal band LANDSAT 8. SST was then used as the primary input in thermal front detection using Single Image Edge Detection (SIED) method (1992, Cayula and Cornillon). SIED method has been implemented using low-resolution satellite imagery for Indonesian waters including Suomi National Polar-orbiting Partnership (NPP) with sensor Visible/Infrared Imager and Radiometer Suite (VIIRS). The {{purpose of this study is}} to know the movement of thermal fronts in coastal areas. So that the coastal fishermen who gone fishing for only one day can get the potential <b>fishing</b> <b>zone</b> information periodically and reduce their operational cost for daily fishing efficiently. Besides that for increasing the spatial resolution from Potential <b>Fishing</b> <b>Zone</b> (PFZ) information becomes more detailed and specific for particular region which having coastal fishermen...|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} stock-effort {{dynamical}} {{model of a}} fishery subdivided into <b>fishing</b> <b>zones.</b> The stock corresponds to a fish population moving between these zones, on which they are harvested by fishing fleets. We consider a linear chain of identical <b>fishing</b> <b>zones.</b> <b>Fish</b> movements between the zones, as well as vessels displacements, are assumed to take place at a faster time scale than the variation of the stock and the change of the fleet size. The vessels movements between the fishing areas {{are assumed to be}} stock dependent, i. e. the larger the stock density is in a zone the more vessels tends to remain in it. We take advantage of these two time scales to derive a reduced model governing the dynamics of the total harvested stock and the total fishing effort. Under some assumption, we obtain either a stable equilibrium or a stable limit cycle which involves large cyclic variations of the total fish stock and fishing effort. We show that there exists an optimal number of <b>fishing</b> <b>zones</b> that maximizes the total catch at equilibrium. We discuss the results in relation to fish aggregating devices (FADs) fisheries...|$|R
