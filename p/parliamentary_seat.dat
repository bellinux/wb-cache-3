5|$|Although {{political}} parties fund their campaigns using donations {{or their own}} assets, the government reimburses them for each <b>parliamentary</b> <b>seat</b> won. For instance, each seat won in the 2011 parliamentary election brought a party 180,000kuna (euros).

5|$|The throne {{remained}} vacant and {{the legislative}} elections of 1920 {{turned into an}} open conflict between the Venizelists, who favored republicanism, and the supporters of the ex-King Constantine.

5|$|Four {{years later}} public attitudes had changed little. When Ian Harvey, a junior Foreign Office {{minister}} in Harold Macmillan's government, {{was found guilty}} of indecent behaviour with a Coldstream Guardsman in November 1958, he lost both his ministerial job and his <b>parliamentary</b> <b>seat</b> at Harrow East. He was ostracised by the Conservative Party and by most of his former friends, and never again held a position in public life. Thus, anyone entering politics at that time knew that revelations of homosexual activity would likely bring such a career to a swift end.|$|E
5|$|However, Thio Li-ann {{believes}} that it is undesirable that {{the law does not}} impose a timeframe for the calling of by-elections. If a by-election is not called promptly upon a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>seat</b> falling vacant, the electors in the GRC in question will be represented to a lesser extent. This is particularly pertinent where more than one MP vacates his or her seat or when the seat vacated is that of a minority candidate. Should the latter situation arise, the rationale behind the GRC scheme – to guarantee minority representation in Parliament – would be defeated.|$|E
5|$|The DLM won {{its first}} <b>parliamentary</b> <b>seat</b> in Lebanon's 2005 {{elections}} representing the Tripoli district. On 2 June 2005, amid election rounds, Samir Kassir, {{a founder of}} the movement, was assassinated in a car bombing. Less than one month later, George Hawi, a former secretary general of the Lebanese Communist Party and an ally of the DLM, was killed in a similar car bombing in Beirut.

5|$|Weber also ran, unsuccessfully, for a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>seat,</b> as {{a member}} of the liberal German Democratic Party, which he had co-founded. He opposed both the leftist German Revolution of 1918–1919 and the {{ratification}} of the Treaty of Versailles, principled positions that defied the political alignments in Germany at that time, and which may have prevented Friedrich Ebert, the new social-democratic President of Germany, from appointing Weber as minister or ambassador. Weber commanded widespread respect but relatively little influence. Weber's role in German politics remains controversial to this day.|$|E
5|$|At the July 1945 general {{election}} Dunglass lost his <b>Parliamentary</b> <b>seat</b> in the landslide Labour victory. It was widely assumed that as his father, the 13th earl, {{was in his}} seventies, Dunglass's political career was behind him, as he would soon inherit the earldom. There being at that time no provision for peers to disclaim their peerages, this would bring with it an obligatory seat in the House of Lords, with no option of remaining in the Commons, where most political power resided. Dunglass was appointed {{a director of the}} Bank of Scotland in 1946, and although he never considered banking as a long-term occupation he gained valuable first-hand experience in commerce and finance. He remained with the bank until 1951.|$|E

In 2006, Chakrapong was expelled from Funcinpec and joined the Norodom Ranariddh Party. When the Cambodian government pursued legal investigations on the debts Chakrapong accumulated from his airlines, Chakrapong quit politics in 2007. Chakrapong, who was already a privy councillor to the Supreme Privy Council, then dedicated himself to humanitarian work and supporting royal activities. In 2013, Chakrapong was appointed member of the Constitutional Council of Cambodia by the King.|$|E
