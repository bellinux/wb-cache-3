40|$|Colony-forming human {{epidermal}} {{cells are}} heterogeneous in their capacity for sustained growth. Once a clone has been {{derived from a}} single cell, its growth potential can be estimated from the colony types resulting from a single plating, and the clone can be {{assigned to one of}} three classes. The holoclone has the greatest reproductive capacity: under standard conditions, fewer than 5 % of the colonies formed by the cells of a holoclone abort and terminally differentiate. The <b>paraclone</b> contains exclusively cells with a short replicative lifespan (not more than 15 cell generations), after which they uniformly abort and terminally differentiate. The third type of clone, the meroclone, contains a mixture of cells of different growth potential and is a transitional stage between the holoclone and the <b>paraclone.</b> The incidence of the different clonal types is affected by aging, since cells originating from the epidermis of older donors give rise to a lower proportion of holoclones and a higher proportion of paraclones...|$|E

40|$|Aldehyde {{dehydrogenase}} 1 (ALDH) {{activity is}} considered to be a marker of cancer stem cells (CSCs) in many tumour models, since these cells are more proliferative and tumourigenic than ALDH(Lo) cells in experimental models. However it is unclear whether all CSC-like cells are within the ALDH(Hi) population, or whether all ALDH(Hi) cells are highly proliferative and tumourigenic. The ability to establish a stem cell hierarchy in vitro, whereby sub-populations of cells have differing proliferative and differentiation capacities, is an alternate indication of the presence of stem cell-like populations within cell lines. In this study, we have examined the interaction between ALDH status and the ability to establish a stem cell hierarchy in PC 3 prostate cancer cells. We demonstrate that PC 3 cells contain a stem cell hierarchy, and isolation of ALDH(Hi) cells enriches for the most primitive holoclone population, however holoclone formation is not restricted to ALDH(Hi) cells. In addition, we show that ALDH activity undergoes phenotypic plasticity, since the ALDH(Lo) population can develop ALDH(Hi) populations comparable to parental cells within 2 weeks in culture. Furthermore, we show that the majority of ALDH(Hi) cells are found within the least primitive <b>paraclone</b> population, which is circumvented by culturing PC 3 cells as spheroids in defined medium favouring stem cell characteristics. Although ALDH(Hi) status enriches for holoclone formation, this activity may be mediated by a minority of ALDH(Hi) cells...|$|E
40|$|Cultured human {{epidermal}} keratinocyte {{stem cells}} (holoclones) are crucial for regenerative medicine for burns and genetic disorders. In serial culture, holoclones progressively lose their proliferative capacity to become transient amplifying cells with limited growth (<b>paraclones),</b> a phenomenon termed clonal conversion. Although it negatively impacts the culture lifespan {{and the success}} of cell transplantation, little is known on the molecular mechanism underlying clonal conversion. Here, we show that holoclones and <b>paraclones</b> differ in their actin filament organization, with actin bundles distributed radially in holoclones and circumferentially in <b>paraclones.</b> Moreover, actin organization sets the stage for a differing response to epidermal growth factor (EGF), since EGF signalling induces a rapid expansion of colony size in holoclones and a significant reduction in <b>paraclones.</b> Furthermore, inhibition of PI 3 K or Rac 1 in holoclones results in the reorganization of actin filaments in a pattern that {{is similar to that of}} <b>paraclones.</b> Importantly, continuous Rac 1 inhibition in holoclones results in clonal conversion and reduction of growth potential.

40|$|Primary keratinocytes exhibit three typical clonal morpholo-gies {{represented}} by holoclones, meroclones, and <b>paraclones,</b> with holoclones containing self-renewing stem cells, and meroclones and <b>paraclones</b> containing more mature and differentiated cells. Interestingly, long-term–cultured human epithelial cancer cells in clonal cultures also form holoclones, meroclones, and <b>paraclones,</b> and tumor cell holoclones have been hypothesized to harbor stem-like cells or cancer stem cells. However, {{the key question}} of whether tumor cell holo-clones genuinely contain tumor-initiating cells has not been directly addressed. Here, using PC 3 human prostate carcino-ma cells as a model, we provide direct experimental evidence that tumor cell holoclones contain stem-like cells that can initiate serially transplantable tumors. Importantly, holo-clones derived from either cultured PC 3 cells or holoclone-initiated tumors can be serially passaged and regenerate all three types of clones. In contrast, meroclones and <b>paraclones</b> cannot be continuously propagated and fail to initiate tumor development. Phenotypic characterizations reveal high levels of CD 44, A 2 B 1 integrin, and B-catenin expression in holo-clones, whereas meroclones and <b>paraclones</b> show markedly reduced expression of these stem cell markers.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent studies {{indicate}} {{the presence of a}} small, stem-like cell population in several human cancers that is crucial for the tumour (re) population. OBJECTIVE: Six established prostate cancer (PCa) cell lines-DU 145, DuCaP, LAPC- 4, 22 Rv 1, LNCaP, and PC- 3 -were examined for their stem cell properties in vitro. DESIGN, SETTINGS, AND PARTICIPANTS: The colony-forming efficiency and self-renewal ability of morphologically distinguishable holoclones and <b>paraclones</b> were tested with low-density plating and serial passaging. Expression of the putative stem cell marker CD 133 and breast cancer resistance protein (BCRP) was examined with flow cytometry, and immunohistochemical stainings were made for CD 133, alpha 2 -integrin, nestin, BCRP, cytokeratin 5 (CK 5), and cytokeratin 18 (CK 18). RESULTS AND LIMITATIONS: Five out of six cell lines formed clear holo-, mero-, and <b>paraclones.</b> Unlike <b>paraclones,</b> we can maintain DU 145 holoclones in culture for several passages, which is indicative of self-renewal ability. Using fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis only in DU 145 cells, a small fraction (0. 01 %) of CD 133 (+) cells was detected. CD 133 (+) cells; however, like DU 145 BCRP(+) (0. 15 %) cells, they were not more clonogenic, and they did not show more holoclone formation than the marker-negative cells or unselected cells. Immunohistochemistry revealed alpha 2 -integrin and BCRP as potential stem cell markers and CK 5 with the combination of CK 18 to distinguish transient amplifying cells. CONCLUSIONS: These results indicate the possible presence of stem-like cells in several established PCa cell lines. CD 133 selection does not enrich for stem-like cells in PCa cell lines...|$|R

40|$|The proliferative {{compartment}} of stratified squamous epithelia {{consists of}} stem and transient amplifying (TA) keratinocytes. Some polypeptides are more abundant in putative epidermal stem cells than in TA cells, but no polypeptide {{confined to the}} stem cells has yet been identified. Here we show that the p 63 transcription factor, a p 53 homologue essential for regenerative proliferation in epithelial development, distinguishes human keratinocyte stem cells from their TA progeny. Within the cornea, nuclear p 63 is expressed by the basal cells of the limbal epithelium, but not by TA cells covering the corneal surface. Human keratinocyte stem and TA cells when isolated in culture give rise to holoclones and <b>paraclones,</b> respectively. We show by clonal analysis that p 63 is abundantly expressed by epidermal and limbal holoclones, but is undetectable in <b>paraclones.</b> TA keratinocytes, immediately after their withdrawal from the stem cell compartment (meroclones), have greatly reduced p 63, even though they possess very appreciable proliferative capacity. Clonal evolution (i. e., generation of TA cells from precursor stem cells) is promoted by the sigma isoform of the 14 - 3 - 3 family of proteins. Keratinocytes whose 14 - 3 - 3 final sigma has been down-regulated remain in the stem cell compartment and maintain p 63 during serial cultivation.

This study demonstrates that the major difference between holoclones and meroclones derived from a cancer cell line is the proportion of stem cells within each colony, not the presence or absence of stem cells.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the growth capacity of keratinocytes isolated from human scalp hair follicles. Like the keratinocytes of glabrous epidermis, most of the colony-forming cells are classified as holoclones or meroclones when analyzed in a clonal assay. Some of them have extensive growth potential, as {{they are able to}} undergo at least 130 doublings. Therefore, the hair follicle, like the epidermis, contains keratinocytes with the expected property of stem cells: an extensive proliferative capacity permitting the generation of a large amount of epithelium. We have also examined the distribution of clonogenic keratinocytes within the hair follicle. Several hundred colony-forming cells are concentrated at a region below the midpoint of the follicle and outside the hair bulb. This region lies deeper than the site of insertion of the arrector pili muscle, which corresponds with the position of the bulge when the latter can be identified. In contrast, few colony-forming cells are present in the hair bulb, where most of the mitotic activity is observed during the active growth phase of the follicle. <b>Paraclones,</b> which are present both in the midregion and in the bulb of hair follicles, are unlikely to be the transient amplifying cells expected from kinetic studies...|$|R

40|$|PhDOral {{squamous}} cell carcinomas (OSCC) appear {{to contain a}} sub-population of cells endowed with indefinite self-renewal capacity, usually referred to as cancer stem cells (CSCs). These cells are clonogenic and are responsible, in all probability, for tumour initiation and propagation. Cancer cell lines consistently show morphological patterns similar to normal keratinocytes (holoclones, meroclones and <b>paraclones)</b> reflecting a hierarchical organization associated with stem, amplifying and differentiated cells. In-vitro studies of OSCC cell lines have revealed further phenotypic differences in colony formation between the stem and non-stem fractions and have identified cell surface proteins such as CD 44, E-Cadherin, Ã 9 ̆f-catenin and Vimentin which are differentially expressed in association with stemness. Recent studies suggest tumour progression {{to be associated with}} Epithelial Mesenchymal Transition (EMT), a process occurring in SCCs which confers invasiveness and motility to CSCs and also suggests a strong involvement of external factors such as those present within the tumour-host microenvironment. Analysis of these properties may provide insight into mechanisms of stem cell fate determination and provide mechanisms for therapeutic targeting of CSCs. Methods and Materials: Immunocytochemistry was used to analyze differential expression of cell surface and internal markers for their role in stemness and EMT, FACS was used to isolate and analyze sub-fractions of cells for clonal studies. Real time videos of cell lines were used to examine cell movement in colonies and cell acquisition of a fibroblastic phenotype. As a test of whether this process is actually EMT, cells were exposed to TGF-Ã 9 ̆f, a known inducer of EMT, to determine whether this enhanced the formation of the mesenchymal-looking cells at colony margins. Results and Conclusions: Video images showed cells at the margins of holoclones acquiring a motile phenotype. Immunohistochemical analysis revealed that certain stem-cell-related cell surface molecules were expressed at higher levels in holoclones than <b>paraclones</b> and at different levels within holoclones. Expression of CD 44 was stronger in the center than at the edge of holoclones suggesting that this molecule plays a role in maintaining a stem-like state. Some images indicated nuclear translocation of CD 44 and Ã 9 ̆f-catenin at colony margins. TGF-Ã 9 ̆f increased the incidence of mesenchymal-like cells at the edges of colonies and seemed to scatter and mobilize these cells with loss of the normal colony architecture.

40|$|Cancer {{stem cell}} theory gains {{increasingly}} greater {{significance in the}} world of medicine. Numerous findings of scientific research in vivo and in vitro indicate that it is the population of undifferentiated, self-renewing cells which is responsible for recurrence of cancer and metastasis. Similarly to normal stem cells, cancer stem cells (CSC) function in the environment of the other cells of the organism, called the niche, where they receive signals for differentiation and proliferation processes. Disorders in the signaling pathways between CSC and the niche that result from e. g. acquired oncogenic mutations may lead to uncontrolled proliferation of stem cells, gaining independence from the primary niche or settling a new microenvironment. CSC are identified on the basis of specific markers – membrane proteins or cell enzymes. Methods based on the measurement of dye fluorescence (obtaining side population, SP) or fluorescence of the fluorophore conjugated with a monoclonal antibody directed against the specific CSC marker are used for isolation. A different method obtains morphologically miscellaneous clones by single cell cloning: holo-, mero- and <b>paraclones.</b> Tumor forming assay in NOD/SCID mice is a standard in vivo test that confirms the stem character of isolated cells.

Cells treated with either proton beam or X-rays were analyzed for their survival using clonogenic assay and MTT test. Long-term migratory properties were assessed with time-lapse monitoring of individual cell movements, wound test and transpore migration, while {{the expression of the}} related proteins was measured with western blot. Exposure to proton beam and X-rays led to similar survival but the quality of the cell colonies was markedly different.

We conclude that proton beam irradiation induced long-term inhibition of cellular motility, as well as changes in the level of beta- 1 integrin and vimentin.

OS aetiology is poorly understood, however, recent studies suggest OS cancers contain a small population of cancer stem cells (CSC) which initiate tumour growth.

It has been proposed that CSC are at the base of this hierarchy and are responsible for the initiation, growth and spread of the tumour and pose a therapeutic challenge due to enhanced chemotherapy resistance. This project had three aims: identifying whether OS cell lines contain subpopulations of putative CSC, identifying if CSC contribute to chemotherapeutic resistance and to elucidate paracrine cell signals controlling OS tumour growth. Eight OS cell lines (143 B, Cal 72, G 292, HOS, MG 63, MNNG-HOS, U 2 OS and SaOS- 2) along with the breast cancer cell line MCF 7 have been analysed for the presence of sub-population of cells expressing putative CSC markers (aldehyde dehydrogenase and CD 117).

40|$|Abstract Background Cancer stem-like {{cells are}} {{proposed}} to sustain solid tumors {{by virtue of}} their capacity for self-renewal and differentiation to cells that comprise the bulk of the tumor, and have been identified for a variety of cancers based on characteristic clonal morphologies and patterns of marker gene expression. Methods Single cell cloning and spheroid culture studies were used to identify a population of cancer stem-like cells in the androgen-independent human prostate cancer cell line PC 3. Results We demonstrate that, under standard culture conditions, ~ 10 % of PC 3 cells form holoclones with cancer stem cell characteristics. These holoclones display high self-renewal capability in spheroid formation assays under low attachment and serum-free culture conditions, retain their holoclone morphology when passaged at high cell density, exhibit moderate drug resistance, and show high tumorigenicity in scid immunodeficient mice. PC 3 holoclones readily form spheres, and PC 3 -derived spheres yield a high percentage of holoclones, further supporting their cancer stem cell-like nature. We identified one gene, FAM 65 B, whose expression is consistently up regulated in PC 3 holoclones compared to <b>paraclones,</b> the major cell morphology in the parental PC 3 cell population, and two genes, MFI 2 and LEF 1, that are consistently down regulated. This molecular profile, FAM 65 B high /MFI 2 low /LEF 1 low, also characterizes spheres generated from parental PC 3 cells. The PC 3 holoclones did not show significant enriched expression of the putative prostate cancer stem cell markers CD 44 and integrin α 2 β 1. PC 3 tumors seeded with holoclones showed dramatic down regulation of FAM 65 B and dramatic up regulation of MFI 2 and LEF 1, and unexpectedly, a marked increase in tumor vascularity compared to parental PC 3 tumors, suggesting a role of cancer stem cells in tumor angiogenesis. Conclusions These findings support the proposal that PC 3 tumors are sustained by a small number of tumor-initiating cells with stem-like characteristics, including strong self-renewal and pro-angiogenic capability and marked by the expression pattern FAM 65 B high /MFI 2 low /LEF 1 low. These markers may serve as targets for therapies designed to eliminate cancer stem cell populations associated with aggressive, androgen-independent prostate tumors such as PC 3. </p...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Cell {{therapy is}} an {{emerging}} therapeutic strategy aimed at replacing or repairing severely damaged tissues with cultured cells. Epidermal regeneration obtained with autologous cultured keratinocytes (cultured autografts) can be life-saving for patients suffering from massive full-thickness burns. However, {{the widespread use}} of cultured autografts has been hampered by poor clinical results that have been consistently reported by different burn units, even when cells were applied on properly prepared wound beds. This might arise from the depletion of epidermal stem cells (holoclones) in culture. Depletion of holoclones can occur because of (i) incorrect culture conditions, (ii) environmental damage of the exposed basal layer of cultured grafts, or (iii) use of new substrates or culture technologies not pretested for holoclone preservation. The aim {{of this study was to}} show that, if new keratinocyte culture technologies and/or "delivery systems" are proposed, a careful evaluation of epidermal stem cell preservation is essential for the clinical performance of this life-saving technology. METHODS: Fibrin was chosen as a potential substrate for keratinocyte cultivation. Stem cells were monitored by clonal analysis using the culture system originally described by Rheinwald and Green as a reference. Massive full-thickness burns were treated with the composite allodermis/cultured autograft technique. RESULTS: We show that: (i) the relative percentage of holoclones, meroclones, and <b>paraclones</b> is maintained when keratinocytes are cultivated on fibrin, proving that fibrin does not induce clonal conversion and consequent loss of epidermal stem cells; (ii) the clonogenic ability, growth rate, and long-term proliferative potential are not affected by the new culture system; (iii) when fibrin-cultured autografts bearing stem cells are applied on massive full-thickness burns, the "take" of keratinocytes is high, reproducible, and permanent; and (iv) fibrin allows a significant reduction of the cost of cultured autografts and eliminates problems related to their handling and transportation. CONCLUSION: Our data demonstrate that: (i) cultured autografts bearing stem cells can indeed rapidly and permanently cover a large body surface; and (ii) fibrin is a suitable substrate for keratinocyte cultivation and transplantation. These data lend strength to the concept that the success of cell therapy at a clinical level requires cultivation and transplantation of stem cells. We therefore suggest that the proposal of a culture system aimed at the replacement of any severely damaged self-renewing tissue should be preceded by a careful evaluation of its stem cell population...|$|R

However, their successful application is hampered {{by a lack of}} selective markers to positively identify the expanded multipotent cells. This study aimed to characterise STRO- 1 antigen as a potential biomarker of multipotency on cultured bone marrow derived hMSCs. In an attempt to identify the nature of this antigen, two techniques were implemented: peptide phage display technology and a microarray based approach. Changes in the expression of STRO- 1 were investigated during culture expansion of hMSCs. STRO- 1 expression positively correlated with cellular morphology and multilineage potential, whereby senescent cells down-regulated STRO- 1 antigen and exhibited decreased adipogenic and osteogenic potential. Furthermore, STRO- 1 was found to be heterogeneously expressed on hMSC populations and enrichment followed by lineage specific induction of the STRO- 1 BRIGHT fraction resulted in enhanced adipogenic and osteogenic differentiation potential. The expression of STRO- 1 antigen was further characterised as a marker of differentiation, whereby differentiating cells were found to down-regulate STRO- 1. A cellular hierarchy in hMSC population was therefore proposed based on STRO- 1 status, with the highest STRO- 1 expressive cells representing the multipotent subset. In an attempt to identify the epitope that STRO- 1 IgM antibody recognised, peptide phage display technology was used as solid and liquid phase panning systems but the approach yielded no promising peptide candidate. Subsequently, comparative gene expression microarray analysis of osteosarcoma cell lines (143 B, CAL 72, G- 292, HOS, MG- 63, Saos- 2 and U- 2 -OS) was implemented and a list of eight potential candidate genes encoding STRO- 1 antigen was selected. This work ultimately led to the identification of putative cancer stem cells (CSCs) in seven osteosarcoma cell lines initially based on STRO- 1 expression. With MG- 63 strongly expressing STRO- 1, the maintenance of MSC-like properties by STRO- 1 expressing cell lines was investigated. A heterogeneous pattern of osteogenic differentiation was observed between and within the cell lines. Closer inspection revealed a cellular hierarchy comprising of holoclones and <b>paraclones,</b> with the holoclones representing the putative CSCs in osteosarcoma. Overall, this thesis addressed the fields of regenerative medicine as well as oncology by proposing STRO- 1 antigen as a marker of multipotency on hMSCs and osteosarcoma holoclonal cells as the putative cancer stem cell targets for anti-cancer drug development.

40|$|Epidermal {{wound healing}} {{requires}} the coordinated involvement of complex cellular and biochemical processes. In {{the case of}} epidermal wounds associated with burns, the healing process may be less than optimal and may take {{a significant amount of}} time, possibly resulting in infection and scarring. An innovative method to assist in the repair of the epidermis (the outer layer of skin) is to use an aerosolised apparatus. This method involves taking skin cells from an area of the patient's undamaged skin, culturing the cells in a laboratory, encouraging them to rapidly proliferate, then harvesting and separating the cells from each other. The cells are then sprayed onto the wound surface. We investigate this novel treatment strategy for the healing of epidermal wounds, such as burns. In particular, we model the application of viable cell colonies to the exposed surface of the wound with the intent of identifying key factors that govern the healing process. Details of the evolution of the colony structure are explored in this two-dimensional model of the wound site, including the effect of varying the initial population cluster size and the initial distribution of cell types with different proliferative capacities. During injury, holoclones (which are thought to be stem cells) have a large proliferative capacity while <b>paraclones</b> (which are thought to be transient amplifying cells) have a more limited proliferative capacity. The model predicts the coverage over time for cells that are initially sprayed onto a wound. A detailed analysis of the underlying mathematical models yields novel mathematical results as well as insight into phenomena of healing processes under investigation. Two one-dimensional systems that are simplifications of the full model are investigated. These models are significant extensions of Fisher's equation and incorporate the mixed clonal population of quiescent and active cells. In the first model, an active cell type migrates and proliferates into the wound and undergoes a transition to a quiescent cell type that neither migrates nor proliferates. The analysis yields the identification of the key parameter constraints on the speed of the healing front of the cells on this model and hence the rate of healing of epidermal wounds. Approximations for the maximum cell densities are also obtained, including conditions for a less than optimal final state. The second model involves two active cell types with different proliferative capacity and a quiescent cell type. This model exhibits two distinct behaviours: either both cell types coexist or one of them dies out as the wound healing progresses leaving the other cell type to fill the wound space. Conditions for coexistence are explored...|$|R
40|$|Prostate {{cancer is}} one of the most common cancers {{affecting}} one of every six men in United States. It is increasingly appreciated that tumor or cancer stem cells are the cells responsible for initiating tumor formation and therefore should be targeted for eradication in cancer treatment. But the mechanism involved in the acquisition of unlimited self-renewal and tumor initiation by cancer stem cells is unknown. Nanog, along with Oct 3 / 4 and Sox- 2, constitute the core transcriptional circuitry for the maintenance of stemness in embryonic stem cells. Herein we report that Nanog expression was detected at mRNA and protein levels in prostate cancer cells. The Nanog-expressing LNCaP-T and DU 145 cells were enriched by infection with lentiviruses expressing GFP under the control of Nanog promoter. The Nanog-enriched prostate cancer cells had stronger expressions of stem and progenitor cell surface markers, including CD 44 and CD 133, when compared with those in the control group. Colony formation assay found that the Nanog-enriched LNCaP-T and DU 145 cells formed more holoclones and prosta-spheres, which contained more self-renewing cells, than the control cells did. On the other hand, knockdown of Nanog in DU 145 or LNCaP-T cells, via shRNAs, reduced their ability to form holoclones. Instead, most clones derived were meroclone and <b>paraclones</b> as result of increased differentiation and senescence due to knockdown of Nanog. When injected into mice, Nanog-enriched DU 145 cells were found to possess increased tumorigenic potentials when compared to the vector controls. On the other hand, LNCaP-T cells with Nanog knocked down did not form tumors, while the vector controls readily formed tumors. Taken together, our data suggest an essential role for Nanog in the self-renewal and tumor initiation of prostate cancer cells. Chemotherapy is the major salvage therapeutic modality available for the patients with advanced cancers. However, drug resistance by some prostate cancer cells is a major barrier to efficacious chemotherapy. It has been increasingly appreciated that cancer stem cells are responsible for resistance to chemo- or radio-therapy, in addition to tumor initiation. However, the mechanisms involved remain unknown. In this study, we examined whether Nanog plays an essential role of Nanog in resistance to chemotherapy. In the surviving fractions of prostate cancer cells, we found increased levels of Nanog protein when compared to the cells treated with solvent control. To determine the role of Nanog in resistance of prostate cancer cells, we marked and enriched Nanog-expressing prostate cancer DU 145 and LNCaP-T cells using a reporter gene under control of 2. 5 kb hNanog 1 promoter. When compared to the control, the prospectively enriched Nanog-expressing cells presented increased resistance to Taxol, vinblastine, and doxorubicin. Profiling of genes in drug resistance and metabolism revealed a marked increase in the mRNA level of ATP-binding cassette (ABC) efflux transporters B 1 and G 2 in tumor cells enriched with endogenous Nanog expression. The increased expression of ABCB 1 and ABCG 2 at protein levels in Nanog expressing cells was confirmed by Western blot and immunocytochemistry. Inhibition of ABCB 1 activities sensitized Nanog expressing cells toward Taxol and vinblastine, and to less extent, doxorubicin. Blocking of ABCG 2 activity sensitized Nanog expressing cells toward doxorubicin, but not Taxol and vinblastine. In addition, the tumor cells enriched with Nanog expression showed reduced apoptosis in response to Taxol treatment. Interestingly, Nanog-enriched prostate carcinoma cells displayed aberrantly activated â-catenin signaling, which is potentially associated with their increased chemo-resistant ability as well as the increased acquisition of epithelial to mesenchymal transition. In summary, Nanog is expressed in prostate cancer cells, especially in those positive for stem/progenitor markers. Enrichment of Nanog expressing cells led to enrichment of tumor cells with increased tumor initiating ability and increased resistance toward chemotherapy. Knockdown of Nanog reduces tumor initiating ability of prostate cancer cells and further sensitizes them toward chemotherapy. The gain-of-function and loss-of-function studies suggest an essential role of Nanog for prostate cancer cells to initiate tumor formation and resist chemotherapy...|$|R
