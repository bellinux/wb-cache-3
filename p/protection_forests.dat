50|$|<b>Protection</b> <b>forests</b> are {{forests that}} {{mitigate}} or prevent {{the impact of}} a natural hazard, including a rockfall, avalanche, erosion, landslide, debris flow or flooding on people and their assets in mountainous areas. A protection forest generally covers the sloping area between a hazard potential (e.g. an unstable rock cliff or an avalanche release zone) and the endangered or exposed assets. In the Alps, <b>protection</b> <b>forests</b> are increasingly considered equal to engineered mitigation measures against natural hazards. In French, German, Italian and Slovenian <b>protection</b> <b>forests</b> are called respectively, Forêt de protection, Schutzwald, foreste di protezione, varovalni gozdovi, and even their maintain function is to protect soil and to prevent it from eroding or blowing away.|$|E

40|$|<b>Protection</b> <b>forests</b> are {{forests that}} have {{as their primary}} {{function}} the protection of people or assets against the impacts of natural hazards. The main 'product ' of these forests are standing trees which act as obstacles to downslope mass movements such as rockfalls, snow avalanches, erosion, landslides, debris flows, and floods. The protective effect of these forests is ensured only if the silvicultural system used and any natural disturbances that occur leave a sufficient amount of forest cover. Management has therefore {{to take a very}} long-term perspective. This paper presents an overview of the occurrence and delimitation, ecology, stand structures and dynamics, and resistance and resilience of <b>protection</b> <b>forests</b> in the European Alps, and of suitable silvicultural systems. Guidelines for managing <b>protection</b> <b>forests,</b> which were developed collaboratively by Swiss forest managers and scientists, are described as an example of standardized decision-making in <b>protection</b> <b>forests.</b> Future research on <b>protection</b> <b>forests</b> should be directed towards synthesising existing knowledge in the natural sciences, engineering, and economics...|$|E

The social and natural environment had changed drastically {{in the past few}} decades, however, the maps and cadastral records of these forests were not updated accordingly. In this study, digital surveying techniques were used to survey the boundaries, sample plots, and land use of the <b>protection</b> <b>forests.</b> Combining with the field survey data, a comprehensive spatial database consisting of topographic maps, digital orthoimage, digital elevation model, cadastre, and other related data was built for the <b>protection</b> <b>forests.</b> Moreover, in order to efficiently provide accurate and timely information for {{protection forest}} management and inventory, a geographic information system was developed using Microsoft Visual Basic, ArcView, and ArcIMS. The system has graphical user interface, and provides easy access for data inquiry, maintenance, updating, printing, and overlaying analysis, which can provide useful spatial information to facilitate decision making for protection forest management. The results indicate that the total area of <b>protection</b> <b>forests</b> is increased from 2, 349 hectares to 2, 539 hectares as compared to the original records.

40|$|The {{establishment}} of riparian <b>protection</b> <b>forests</b> in the Three Gorges Reservoir (TGR) {{is an ideal}} measure {{to cope with the}} eco-environmental problems of the water-level fluctuation zone (WLFZ). Thus, the information for screening winter-flood-tolerant woody plant species is useful for the recovery and re-{{establishment of}} the riparian <b>protection</b> <b>forests</b> in the TGR WLFZ. Therefore, we discussed the possibilities of constructing and popularizing riparian <b>protection</b> <b>forests</b> in the TGR WLFZ from several aspects, including the woody plant species distribution in the WLFZ, the survival rate analyses of suitable candidate woody species under controlled flooding conditions, the survival rate investigation of some woody plant species planted in the TGR WLFZ, and the physiological responses of some woody plant species during the recovery stage after winter floods. The results of woody species investigation showed that most woody plant species that existed as annual seedlings in the TGR WLFZ are not suitable candidates for the riparian <b>protection</b> <b>forests.</b> However, arbor species (e. g., Salix matsudana, Populus 6 canadensis, Morus alba, Pterocarya stenoptera, Taxodium ascendens, and Metasequoia glyptostroboides) and shrub species (e. g., Salix variegata, Distylium chinensis, Lycium chinense, Myricaria laxiflora, and Rosa multiflora) might be considered suitable candidates for the riparian <b>protection</b> <b>forests</b> in the TGR WLFZ by survival rate analyses under controlled winter flooding conditions, and survival rate investigations of woody plant species planted in the TGR WLFZ, respectively.

40|$|Increasingly, {{forests are}} being valued for goods and {{services}} beyond wood fibre; one of these is <b>protection</b> <b>forests.</b> Functions provided by natural and managed forests have been associated with reduced hazards from floods, debris floods, debris flows, snow avalanches and rockfalls. Maintaining a high level of protection may require active management, as forests are dynamic and the protection capabilities are strongly determined by forest condition. The nature of protection provided varies depending upon the hazard processes and pathways, and the relative spatial orientation of the hazard, the forest, and the features being protected. Hazard processes and pathways need to be understood for protection forest management so that the expected protective functions can be well predicted. Protective functions of forests include: 1) retaining material in upslope positions; and 2) containing, confining and resisting material during transport and deposition. These effects are primarily realized through: 1) soil conditioning and macropore creation; 2) root reinforcement and 3) presence of above ground structural elements. Recognition of these functions of <b>protection</b> <b>forests</b> and their relations with hydrogeomorphic hazards will contribute to the best management of <b>protection</b> <b>forests...</b>|$|E

40|$|Research on <b>protection</b> <b>forests</b> {{designed}} to alleviate rockfall hazard has increased enormously {{over the last}} decade. Data are available concerning the most suitable stem spacing and density regimes in stands. The species used in <b>protection</b> <b>forests</b> can also influence enormously the effec-tiveness of the forest in conferring a protective role. Little information exists, however, about either the mechanical resistance of different species to rock impacts or the recovery processes after sustaining a wound. This paper provides a short review of the work carried out on the mechanisms by which different subalpine forest species sustain rockfall impacts, and considers the management of <b>protection</b> <b>forests</b> in relation to species and time. Broadleaved species are generally more mechanically resistant than conifers and heal more quickly after wounding. When felled, trees {{can be used as}} barriers to obstruct or change the trajectory of falling rocks. If used as such, the decay rates of logs from coniferous species tend to be lower than those for typical sub-alpine broadleaved species. By accumulating and integrating existing knowledge, a forester must determine the exact nature of the hazard on a given site, {{and the role of the}} protection forest. Typical subalpine broadleaved species are more efficient in protecting human life and property against rockfall activity, but are less effective than conifers in preventing winter snow movement...|$|E
