500|$|The Herald Tribune began {{a decline}} shortly after World War II that had several causes. [...] The Reid family was long {{accustomed}} to resolve shortfalls {{at the newspaper}} with subsidies from their fortune, rather than improved business practices, seeing the paper [...] "as a hereditary possession to be sustained as a public duty rather than developed as a profit-making opportunity". [...] With its generally marginal profitability, the Herald Tribune had few opportunities to reinvest in its operations as the Times did, and the Reids' mortgage on the newspaper {{made it difficult to}} raise outside cash for needed capital improvements. After another profitable year in 1946, Bill Robinson, the Herald Tribunes business manager, decided to reinvest the profits to make needed upgrades to the newspaper's <b>pressroom.</b> [...] The investment squeezed the paper's resources, and Robinson decided {{to make up the difference}} at the end of the year by raising the Tribunes price from three cents to a nickel, expecting the Times, which also needed to upgrade its facilities, to do the same. [...] However, the Times, concerned by the Tribunes performance during the war, refused to go along. [...] "We didn't want to give them any quarter," [...] Times circulation manager Nathan Goldstein said. [...] "Our numbers were on the rise, and we didn't want to do anything to jeopardize them. 'No free rides for the competition' was the way we looked at it." [...] The move proved disastrous: In 1947, the Tribunes daily circulation fell nine percent, from 348,626 to 319,867. [...] Its Sunday circulation fell four percent, from 708,754 to 680,691. [...] Although the overall percentage of advertising for the paper was higher than it was in 1947, the Times was still higher: 58 percent of the average space in the New York Times in 1947 was devoted to advertising, versus a little over 50 percent of the Tribune. [...] The Times would not raise its price until 1950.|$|E

40|$|Background and Significance New {{technologies}} {{within the}} printing industry open new challenges, enable innovative ways of reaching prospective clients and bring ever more stringent demands to both graphic designers and printers. Printers must implement the emerging technologies that best suit their customers and the evolving {{needs of the}} marketplace; designers must acquaint themselves with new technologies and learn to design {{with respect to the}} output device to make best use of the equipment. A short step beyond desktop technology are digital printing systems, 2 ̆ 2 the culmination of many technologies that have been in various stages of development for over 20 years and have finally caught up with each other. 2 ̆ 21 Digital printers are capable of printing 2 ̆ 2 directly from digital information residing in an electronic file on a computer, 2 ̆ 22 2 ̆ 2 bypassing the multiple and time-consuming steps of film output, proofing, imposition and plate-making required by traditional methods. 2 ̆ 23 As of today, digital printing is targeted to the short-run and on-demand segments of the industry. 2 ̆ 2 Eventually, digital approaches will apply to just every facet of graphic communication, whether it has to a run of 1, 000, 000 or just one. 2 ̆ 24 Statement of The Problem The all-time myth roaming in <b>pressrooms</b> that designers know nothing about printing is not entirely untrue. Often, a design is finished and approved in a studio without the minimal consideration for printing and finishing. The consolidation of a digital workflow today in the printing industry increases the need for designers to acknowledge printing in their brainstorming sessions to create designs that can be produced through emerging technologies. By doing so, they can reduce problems associated with file transfer and output such as missing images and typefaces. The ease of operation of digital presses that can receive a file and print much as a desktop printer does makes them highly attractive to designers and entrepreneurs, providing these a means for printing without all the makeready procedures associated with traditional printing processes. Statement of The Project Goals The purpose of this thesis project is to evaluate the color reproduction of digital printing systems most common in industry through the creation of a universal test instrument with respect to which all the systems will be compared. The results of the test will be used to assess the capabilities of the equipment and determine their ideal applications within the graphic communications industry. A file preparation and specification guide for each of the devices tested will be compiled. The audience at which this study is targeted is graphic designers, who could benefit by learning about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} the various systems and learning to design with these in mind. As a result, particular attention will be paid to the impact these emerging technologies have in designers 2 ̆ 7 approach to producing their work. This thesis project does not suggest the equipment to be tested is the best in the market place. Its results, however, may be used in determining which system is most suitable for implementation. Methodology This thesis project will provide a color reproduction evaluation and comprehensive guides for designers to prepare and expedite files to the following digital presses: Xeikon DCP- 32 D Indigo E-Print 1000 Xerox DocuColor 40 Heidelberg Quickmaster-DI The criterium defining the color reproduction evaluation and the elements used in the test instrument is the following: Graphic designers, the audience at which this thesis project is targeted, think in terms of memory colors; red, green, and blue. As a result, the elements comprising the test instrument will be those which designers deal with: text and images. The printed samples will be measured with a X-Rite 938 spectrodensitometer, and the results will be complemented with a visual evaluation done under standard lighting conditions. Test Instrument The test instrument will be comprised of the following: CMYK patches and bars 4 -color black patches Images of different sources and resolutions Line art Type Overprinting circles Color bars RIT Neutral Balance Target for SWOP RIT 4 -Color Spokes Target Evaluation Tone reproduction Solid ink density Total ink density Gray balance Dot gain Resolution Ghosting The second part to this thesis project will involve the compilation of guides to expedite files to each output device. In addition, specifications will be collected to determine the requirements for preparing variable data printing documents...|$|R
60|$|While {{he spoke}} the Major {{led the way}} across the room to the {{stereotyping}} plant, which brought his party to a position near the press. Smith glanced at them and went on with his work. It was not unusual to have the <b>pressroom</b> thus invaded.|$|E
60|$|Patsy {{straightened}} {{up with a}} sigh of relief, then gave a low cry as the screens of the two windows of the <b>pressroom</b> were smashed in and through the openings men began to tumble into the room. At once Hetty confronted them with leveled revolver and the sight caused them to hesitate.|$|E
6000|$|Then he went in, {{and they}} took the hint and entered the <b>pressroom</b> in a {{fluttering}} group. Fogerty stood {{with his hands in}} his pockets intently watching the Dwyer girls set type, while at his elbow Mr. Merrick was explaining in a casual voice how many [...] "m's" [...] were required to make a newspaper column. In another part of the long room Arthur Weldon was leaning over a table containing the half-empty forms, as if critically examining them. Smith, arrayed in overalls and jumper, was cleaning and oiling the big press.|$|E
6000|$|That was a {{good deal}} of {{conversation}} for these two to indulge in. Hetty was talkative enough, at times, and so was Thursday Smith, when the humor seized him; but when they were together they said very little. The artist would stroll into the <b>pressroom</b> after the compositors had finished their tasks and watch the man make up the forms, lock them, place them on the press and run off the edition. Then he would glance over the paper while Thursday washed up and put on his coat, after which he accompanied her to the door of her hotel and with a simple [...] "good night" [...] proceeded up the street to his own lodging.|$|E
60|$|The {{girl was}} just {{opposite}} the printing office when her attention was attracted by a queer grating noise, {{as if one}} of the windows was being pried up. She stopped short, a moment, and then crept closer to the building. Two men were at a side window of the <b>pressroom,</b> which they had just succeeded in opening. As Hetty gained her point of observation one of the men slipped inside, but a moment later hastily reappeared and joined his fellow. At once both turned and stole {{along the side of the}} shed directly toward the place where the girl stood. Her first impulse was to run, but recollecting that she wore a dark gown and stood in deep shadow she merely flattened herself against the building and remained motionless. The men were chuckling as they passed her, and she recognized them as mill hands from Royal.|$|E
60|$|Often {{at midnight}} Hetty would wander into the <b>pressroom</b> and watch Thursday Smith {{run off the}} edition on the {{wonderful}} press, which seemed to possess an intelligence of its own, so perfectly did it perform its functions. At such times she sat listlessly by and said little, for Thursday was no voluble talker, especially when busied over his press. But a certain spirit of comradeship grew up between these two, {{and it was not}} unusual for the pressmen, after his work was finished and the papers were neatly piled for distribution to the carriers at daybreak, to walk with Hetty to the hotel before proceeding to his own lodgings in the little wing of Nick Thorne's house, which stood quite {{at the end of the}} street. To be sure, the hotel adjoined the printing office, with only a vacant lot between, but Hetty seemed to appreciate this courtesy and would exchange a brief good night with Smith before going to her own room. Afterward she not infrequently stole out again, because sleep would not come to her, and then the moon watched her wanderings until it dipped behind the hills.|$|E
6000|$|There are no {{such things}} as facts. Narrow-minded folk--surveyors, auctioneers, and such like--would have insisted that the garden between the old Georgian house and Nevill's Court was a strip of land one hundred and {{eighteen}} feet by ninety-two, containing a laburnum tree, six laurel bushes, and a dwarf deodora. To Nathaniel George and Janet Helvetia it was the land of Thule, [...] "the furthest boundaries of which no man has reached." [...] On rainy Sunday afternoons they played in the great, gloomy <b>pressroom,</b> where silent ogres, standing motionless, stretched out iron arms to seize them as they ran. Then just when Nathaniel George was eight, and Janet Helvetia four and a half, Hezekiah launched the celebrated [...] "Grindley's Sauce." [...] It added a relish to chops and steaks, transformed cold mutton into a luxury, and swelled the head of Hezekiah Grindley--which was big enough in all conscience as it was--and shrivelled up his little hard heart. The Grindleys and the Appleyards visited no more. As a sensible fellow ought to have seen for himself, so thought Hezekiah, the Sauce had altered all things. The possibility of a marriage between their children, things having remained equal, {{might have been a}} pretty fancy; but the son of the great Grindley, whose name in three-foot letters faced the world from every hoarding, would have to look higher than a printer's daughter. Solomon, a sudden and vehement convert to the principles of mediaeval feudalism, would rather see his only child, granddaughter of the author of The History of Kettlewell and other works, dead and buried than married to a grocer's son, even though he might inherit a fortune made out of poisoning the public with a mixture of mustard and sour beer. It was many years before Nathaniel George and Janet Helvetia met one another again, and when they did they had forgotten one another.|$|E
50|$|Secret {{work of the}} <b>pressroom</b> gave top results. It was {{organized}} so {{that the people who}} worked in the <b>pressroom</b> and those who took over the material did not know each other. Also, the people who expedited the material did not know where the <b>pressroom</b> was located. Because of that the <b>pressroom</b> stayed undetected and survived two large police interventions into Partisans' organization.|$|E
50|$|After Vukmanović left, {{the care}} of illegal <b>pressroom</b> {{was taken over by}} Ivan Milutinović, member of the CCCPY. This <b>pressroom</b> was a secret not only for a police and Germans, but also for most members of the Party. The people that knew for the <b>pressroom</b> were Vukmanović, Milutinović, Đorđe Andrejević Kun, workers in the <b>pressroom,</b> owners of the house Branko and Dana Maksimović, as well as Josip Broz Tito and members of the Politburo of CCCPY. After Milutinović left the <b>pressroom</b> and went to the liberated {{territory}} in the middle of September 1941, Blagoje Nesković took over managing of the pressroom; he was a secretary of the Provincial Committee of CPY for Serbia. By the end of July 1941 the <b>pressroom</b> was moved in the house in Banjički venac. Andrejević Kun then made a special closet {{with the help of his}} father-in-law Mihajlo Ratković, that closet was hiding a secret entrance to the <b>pressroom.</b> After that, they isolated the <b>pressroom</b> with the boards, so that the noise from the machines could not be heard. Before they moved in, they solved another problem — electricity. The machine needed a three phase current, which they installed under the illusion that the doctor's office needed it. Since the machines used a large amount of electricity they had to remodel electric meter. Special room in which the <b>pressroom</b> was placed was equipped, besides the two printing machines, with two beds, maps of the current events on the front, radio, three guns and several bombs. The <b>pressroom</b> started to work August 1, 1941 by printing the first issue of the Bulletin of the HighCommand of NLA Detachments of Yugoslavia, which was brought in the <b>pressroom</b> by Milutinović.|$|E
50|$|Work of {{the secret}} <b>pressroom</b> was {{described}} in many books which deal with World War II in Belgrade, and especially good description was given by Dragan Marković in his book Otpisani (The Written Off). During the filming of the TV series Otpisani in 1974, screenwriters Dragan Marković and Siniša Pavić dedicated an episode under the name <b>Pressroom.</b> In the series, the things have been changed a little so that {{the events in the}} <b>pressroom</b> happen faster than they did in reality.|$|E

50|$|Work of the <b>pressroom</b> {{continued}} until August 31, 1943 when the Germans ordered that all tenants must {{leave the house}} in three days, so that their officers could move in. They also ordered that all the furniture must stay in the house. Since the deadline for the moving of the <b>pressroom</b> was so short, and party organization in Belgrade in that time was in troubles, Branko Đonović and Jović had to organize moving of the <b>pressroom</b> themselves. By the instructions of the Provincial Committee, they moved smaller printing machine to the secret shelter in the apartment of Milutin Blagojević in Krajinska street number 24. Because of the fear that the Germans might find the secret printroom, the Provincial Committee advised Maksimovićs to go illegal, and soon in October they crossed to liberated territory in Srem.|$|E
50|$|In fall 1941 {{and spring}} 1942, {{because all of}} the police activities, the work in the <b>pressroom</b> was in stagnation, but it {{remained}} undetected. Police put in a lot of effort to discover it. They checked all the technique in all public pressrooms in the city, and since they could not find anything, they figured out that the <b>pressroom</b> was somewhere in the heartland. One event that showed the police that the <b>pressroom</b> was, in fact, in Belgrade was on 7 November 1942. In the streets of Belgrade, flyers were distributed with a report on the speech which Sergei Molotov delivered in Moscow on 6 November. This speech was broadcast through Radio Moscow around 7 pm. The flyers were all over Belgrade by 9 pm. By August 1943, the <b>pressroom</b> printed five issues of the Bulletin of the High Command, seven issues of Glas, Proleter for 1942, declarations of the Provincial Committee of CPY of 1 July 1942, 7 September 1942, March 1943 and 1 May 1943, four Circular issues of the Provincial Committee, declaration of the CK SKOJ of 7 November 1942, different books, flyers, radio news and other materials.|$|E
50|$|In {{the house}} on Banjički venac there were special rules for living and working. Gate and the front door were always locked. Secret {{entrance}} to the <b>pressroom</b> was always open. During the work hours everybody was in the <b>pressroom</b> except one tenant who was on duty upstairs. Branko Đonović and Jović slept in the room which led directly to the <b>pressroom.</b> In the case of emergency they had to climb down the ladder in the secret room. They had no visitors except Branko and Dana Maksimović, whom lived nearby, {{in the house of}} Branko's father.For delivering printing materials, Jovanović was in charge. She met every day in the agreed time and place with Milorad Rajter and exchanges the material. During this job Jovanović used a different ID so that the police, in the case of her arrest could not find the <b>pressroom.</b> Later, Ljubica Đonović joined Jovanović in this job but they worked separately. In time, as the repression grew, the action of exchanging materials took more and more people involved. First, Branko Maksimović joined them, and then Branko Đonović and Jović, armed with fake IDs, followed.|$|E

He made fake documents on the name Vinko Tomasević for Bosković, who went to Zagreb at the beginning of July 1942. There, he connected with Ivanka Mucević Nikolas with whom he was supposed to cross to the liberated territory and go to Tito's Supreme headquarters. Since they lost their connection, Nikolas and Bosković were spotted by the police in one of their walks in occupied Zagreb. One policeman recognized Nikolas and arrested her along with Bosković.
