40|$|This {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the mapping of conic projections and their appliance in producing maps of our state cartography. So far they were often applied, and will be used precisely coned, polyconed and modified polyconed projections for the official mapping (1 : 500 000, 1 : 750 000, 1 : 1000 000 and 1 : 1500 000). In particular, they cartographic conical projection at a scale of 1 : 1000 000 were taken into consideration. Those are the Lambert conformal conical projection with two standard parallels and the Modified <b>polyconic</b> <b>projections.</b> In addition to these cartographic conical projections, is described Boneo`s pseudoconic equivalent projections. This is one of the cartographic conical map projection that is commonly used in the preparation of thematic maps as well as for atlas editions of geographic maps both in Serbia and abroad...|$|R
40|$|Some map {{projections}} {{are defined}} by table values rather than mathematical equations. The most popular and famous one in this category is the Robinson Projection. The Ginzburg projections, which were developed and applied in the former Soviet Union, are among the other table-based world projections. A computational method is {{required in order to}} efficiently use this kind of projections in Geographic Information Systems (GIS) and similar environments. Function matching for these projections can be carried out for a numerical forward and inverse transformation. Matched functions also allow the determination of the projection distortions easily. In this study, polynomials are applied to derive an analytical expression from an array of tabular coordinates. The tests are carried out for four table-based <b>polyconic</b> <b>projections,</b> The Ginzburg IV, V, VI, and 1966. The distortion characteristics are searched with the partial derivatives obtained by numerical approximation...|$|R
40|$|This site offers {{descriptions}} {{for each of}} the major map projections now in use. The author treats each type of projection in detail and each explanation has a scientific illustration depicting a visual conception of the projection. Cylindrical projections discussed include cylindrical equal area (Behrmann, Gall's stereographic, and Peters), Mercator, Miller cylindrical, and oblique and transverse Mercator. Pseudocylindrical projections include Mollweide, Eckert, Robinson, and sinusoidal projection. The Conic projections discussed are Albers equal area, equidistant, Lambert conformal, and <b>Polyconic,</b> while azimuthal <b>projections</b> include azimuthal equidistant, Lambert azimuthal equal area, orthographic, stereographic. Some other miscellaneous projections are also discussed. This site includes links to related sites. Educational levels: High school, Intermediate elementary, Middle school...|$|R
50|$|The latitudinally equal-differential <b>polyconic</b> <b>{{projection}}</b> (等差分纬线多圆锥投影) is a polyconic {{map projection}} in use since 1963 in mainland China. Maps on this projection {{are produced by}} China's State Bureau of Surveying and Mapping and other publishers. Its original method of construction has not been preserved, but a mathematical approximation has been published.|$|E
50|$|As a <b>polyconic</b> <b>projection</b> projection, the {{parallels}} are arcs of circles {{that are not}} concentric. The points of no distortion are on the central meridian at 44°N/S latitude. Meridians are convex away from the straight central meridian, and parallels are gently concave away from the equator. The projection is neither equal-area nor conformal; rather, it is a compromise projection.|$|E

The first map with the British modified grid, for artillery purposes, was Albury '1 mile' although {{it was on the}} <b>polyconic</b> <b>projection.</b> This grid system was used for Australian topographic mapping until 1966.|$|E
5000|$|As a {{specific}} projection, the American <b>polyconic</b> <b>projection</b> is conceptualized as [...] "rolling" [...] a cone tangent to the Earth at all parallels of latitude, {{instead of a}} single cone as in a normal conic projection. Each parallel is a circular arc of true scale. The scale is also true on the central meridian of the projection. The projection was in common use by many map-making agencies of the United States {{from the time of}} its proposal by Ferdinand Rudolph Hassler in 1825 until the middle of the 20th century.|$|E
5000|$|... 1910-1915: {{established}} {{the standard for}} the Australian Military Map Series, based on United Kingdom Ordnance Survey maps; mainly '1 inch to 1 mile' maps (known as the '1 mile' map) produced from field survey sheets '2 inches to 1 mile' using plane-tabling and parish plans for position, scale and orientation, final map compilation by ink fair drawing at '2 inches to 1 mile' using a <b>polyconic</b> <b>projection</b> and lithographic draughting for colour separation (seven colours) and photographic reduction to '1 inch to 1 mile' for printing by the Victorian Government Printer. The Military Survey sheet numbering system {{was that of the}} International Map Congress of 1912. Standard map sheet extent was 30 min longitude x 15 min latitude. Standard height contour interval was 50 feet.|$|E
