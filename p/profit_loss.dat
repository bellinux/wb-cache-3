25|$|In 1982, Berdella began renting his own {{booth at}} the Westport Flea Market. This store was named Bob's Bizarre Bazaar, and {{primarily}} sold and traded primitive art, jewelry, and antiques. Although occasionally making a generous monthly profit, the income he typically generated via this business was often not sufficient to maintain his daily expenses and to make ends meet. Resultingly, Berdella would occasionally have to either sell goods to fellow merchants at a <b>profit</b> <b>loss,</b> or steal or scavenge for items to sell at his booth. Additionally, he would often take lodgers at his home {{as a means of}} gaining additional income.|$|E
25|$|Early {{forms of}} proto-capitalism and free markets {{were present in}} the Caliphate. An early market economy and early form of {{merchant}} capitalism developed between the 8th and 12th centuries. A vigorous monetary economy developed based on the wide circulation of a common currency (the dinar) and the integration of previously independent monetary areas. Business techniques and forms of business organization employed during this time included early contracts, bills of exchange, long-distance international trade, early forms of partnership (mufawada) such as limited partnerships (mudaraba), and early forms of credit, debt, <b>profit,</b> <b>loss,</b> capital (al-mal), capital accumulation (nama al-mal), circulating capital, capital expenditure, revenue, cheques, promissory notes, trusts (waqf), savings accounts, transactional accounts, pawning, loaning, exchange rates, bankers, money changers, ledgers, deposits, assignments, the double-entry bookkeeping system, and lawsuits. Organizational enterprises similar to corporations independent from the state also existed in the medieval Islamic world. Many of these concepts were adopted and further advanced in medieval Europe from the 13th century onwards.|$|E

The chain had reached 3,000 outlets in 48 different countries by 1970, but expansion was often chaotic and poorly executed.

A member of KFC senior management described the international strategy as [...] "throwing some mud against the map on the wall, and hoping some of it would stick." [...] The first outlet in Japan was opened after just two weeks preparation, and it proved to be a costly failure, losing $400,000 during its opening month and wasting more chicken than it sold.
