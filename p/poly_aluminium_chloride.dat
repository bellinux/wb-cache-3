40|$|Abstract—The {{pulp and}} paper mill {{effluent}} {{is one of the}} high polluting effluent amongst the effluents obtained from polluting industries. All the available methods for treatment of {{pulp and paper}} mill effluent have certain drawbacks. The coagulation is one of the cheapest process for treatment of various organic effluents. Thus, the removal of chemical oxygen demand (COD) and colour of paper mill effluent is studied using coagulation process. The batch coagulation process was performed using various coagulants like: aluminium chloride, <b>poly</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>chloride</b> and copper sulphate. The initial pH of the effluent (Coagulation pH) has tremendous effect on COD and colour removal. <b>Poly</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>chloride</b> (PAC) as coagulant reduced COD to 84 % and 92 % of colour was removed at an optimum pH 5 and coagulant dose of 8 ml l- 1. With aluminium chloride at an optimum pH = 4 and coagulant dose of 5 g l- 1, 74 % COD and 86 % colour removal were observed. The results using copper sulphate as coagulant (a less commercial coagulant) were encouraging. At an optimum pH 6 and mass loading of 5 g l- 1, 76 % COD reduction and 78 % colour reduction were obtained. It was also observed that after addition of coagulant, the pH of the effluent decreases. The decrease in pH was highest for AlCl 3, which was followed by PAC and CuSO 4. Significant amount of COD reductions was obtained by coagulation process. Since the coagulation process is the first stage for treatment of effluent and some of the coagulant cations usually remain in the treated effluents. Thus, cation like copper {{may be one of the}} good catalyst for second stage of treatment process like wet oxidation. The copper has been found to be good oxidation catalyst then iron and aluminum.

Production of clear drinking water from most raw water sources involves use of coagulant to remove turbidity. There are a number of substances that are available for treating turbidity, while some effective natural flocculating agent, providing a low-cost household solution to the critical need for potable water in rural riparian communities. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the optimum conditions of efficient turbidity removal of three conventional coagulants, Ferric chloride (FeCl 3), <b>Poly</b> <b>Aluminium</b> <b>chloride</b> (PACL) and Aluminiumsulphate (ALUM, Al 2 (SO 4) 3. xH 2 O) and three natural vegetable coagulants, Moringa (M. oleifera) seeds, Nirmali (S. potatorum) seeds and Cow Peas; and also to compare the cost effectiveness and treatment efficiency of natural coagulants. The influence of pH and coagulant dosages on the coagulation process was studied where the conditions were optimized corresponding to the best removal of turbidity. To obtain the optimum dose of the coagulant, jar tests were conducted over the various coagulant sample ranges. To investigate the optimum pH for coagulation process, the above procedure was repeated over the range 5 to 7 pH values of the raw water. The optimum pH for PACL, Alum, FeCl 3, Moringa, Nirmali and Cowpea were 6. 0, 6. 5, 6. 5, 5. 5, 5. 5 and 6. 5 respectively and the optimum coagulant dosages of PACL, Alum, FeCl 3, Moringa, Nirmali and Cowpea were 20 ml (0. 2 g), 40 ml (0. 8 g), 40 ml (0. 4 g), 80 ml (1. 6 g), 80 ml (0. 8 g) and 40 g respectively for 500 ml raw water.

In this study, the water samples were extracted from the ex-mining lakes in Bestari Jaya, Selangor. The samples were collected from three (3) different sampling points of the lakes. The lake water samples that came from the mining lakes were analyzed for three different categories of parameters; 1) physical parameter, 2) chemical parameter, 3) microbiological parameter, and tested before and after being treated by two different types of coagulants; Alum and <b>Poly</b> <b>Aluminium</b> <b>Chloride.</b> The physical parameters include the temperature, pH, and turbidity.

The results showed that water from ex-mining lakes has high COD values. The concentration of Pb and Cd in the three stations exceeded the limits prescribed by the Ministry of Health (MOH), but can be eliminated using coagulation treatment using Alum and Poly-Aluminium Chloride.

40|$|A proved {{technique}} to upgrade (wastewater treatment plant) wwtp effluent to improved water quality is dead-end ultrafiltration (UF). Although {{the use of}} UF for upgrading wwtp effluent results in an excellent basic water quality, this technique faces problems due to membrane fouling. Especially particles in the size range between 0. 1 and 0. 45 @m (5 to 20 {{times larger than the}} membrane pores) are mainly responsible for membrane fouling. By the implementation of a pretreatment step for the dead-end UF installation, the particles in the critical fraction between 0. 1 @m and 0. 45 @m might be removed. Previous pretreatment methods did not give satisfying results. Apparently pretreatment with multimedia filtration, microfiltration and in-line coagulation with <b>poly</b> <b>aluminium</b> <b>chloride</b> (PACl), sometimes in combination with continuous sand filtration, did not remove the (effect of) these particles. Filterability did improve though, but only with a small percentage. In this research six pretreatment methods for dead-end UF are investigated. The objective of this research is to determine if the implementation of those pretreatment methods have any influence on the filterability of wwtp effluent. When an increase in filterability takes place, after a certain pretreatment step, the fraction in which the main filterability increase takes place, has to be determined. The six pretreatment steps were investigated on three different wwtp’s in the Netherlands. From February until May water was taken from wwtp Maasbommel. At this plant three pretreatment steps were involved; the dosage of NALMET (a polymeric substance, mainly for removal of heavy metals, the dosage of powdered activated carbon (PAC) and treatment with granular activated carbon (GAC). At wwtp Veendam experiments were carried out with a Fuzzy Filter in April. From July until September investigations started at wwtp Horstermeer with two different techniques; a multimedia filter and treatment of wwtp effluent with water fleas (Daphnia). The collected samples were fractionated which divides a sample in four fractions; the raw fraction, 0. 45 ?m. Pretreatment with NALMET and GAC is not able to effectively remove the (effect of) the most important membrane fouling fraction of 0. 1 - 0. 2 ?m. Treatment with PAC and GAC did remove proteins, colour and humic substances. Polysaccharides accumulated in front of the membrane, resulting in high concentrations. No change was determined after treatment with GAC. After dosage of NALMET concentrations of TOC, DOC, proteins and humic substances increased. Concentrations of polysaccharides and colour stayed more or less constant. Treatment with a Fuzzy Filter did not have any effect on all the measured foulants in this research. Varying results were obtained after both multimedia filtration and Daphnia. No foulant did increase or decrease structurally after both pretreatment methods. High SUR values go hand in hand with high concentrations of proteins, colour and humic substances. This is not the case for TOC and polysaccharides. Foulants could not be related to filterability per fraction. The total SUR is mainly caused by particles in the fraction between 0. 1 and 0. 45 ?m, while most of the foulants are present in the fraction < 0. 1 ?m. For removing the most important membrane fraction, other options should be investigated. Other methods which might remove the critical fraction are a precoat layer, ozonation and slow sand filtration. Optimizing the configurations of the used pretreatment methods might give other results than illustrated here. Repetition of the experiments carried out for this research could confirm the outcomes of this thesis. Sanitary EngineeringWatermanagementCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E
