40|$|Scaling up {{evidence-based}} {{programs is}} not easy, {{and it is}} something that <b>program</b> <b>developers</b> and distributors approach in many different ways. This brief reviews the best practices for scale up of effective programs from across the literature and describes the experiences of several effective programs that are at varying levels of scale across the country and internationally. KEY FINDINGS • Effective replication and scale-up of an evidence-based program is a process that requires time, planning, and the mobilization of effort and resources from communities, <b>program</b> <b>developers,</b> and implementing organizations. • <b>Program</b> <b>developers</b> and implementing organizations take many approaches to scale-up, with some providing the infrastructure to support high-quality implementation through a central organization (e. g., a program purveyor) and others making program materials and training available for purchase for any interested implementer. • To ensure that scale-up efforts result in high-quality implementation, <b>program</b> <b>developers,</b> implementing organizations, and funders should consider a number of factors, including identification of core components, selection of the appropriate program for the local context, organizational capacity for scale up, staff and leadership buy-in, monitoring of fidelity and outcomes, provision of ongoing training and technical assistance, and identification of sustainable funding. BACKGROUND In recent years, the number of intervention approaches with rigorous evidence of effectiveness has grown rapidly.

40|$|Gender is a {{socially}} determined construct describing the characteristics, behaviors, and roles deemed appropriate and expected {{of men and}} women (and boys and girls) by a given society. These characteristics, behaviors, and roles are learned and reinforced through a socialization process beginning early in life that continues throughout the life cycle (Rolleri, 2013 a). Individual attitudes and social norms about gender are important determinants of adolescent sexual risk taking behaviors (Rolleri, 2013 b). <b>Program</b> <b>developers</b> and practitioners are in a strong position to address unhealthy and inequitable gender norms, transforming them into healthy and equitable ones. This article will explore ways that adolescent reproductive and sexual health <b>program</b> <b>developers</b> and practitioners can incorporate a gender transformative approach in developing or adapting curriculum-based interventions designed to prevent adolescent pregnancy and sexually transmitted infections (STI). Applying a Gender Transformative Approach In 2000, Geeta Rao Gupta, then the President of the International Center of Research on Women (ICRW), presented a continuum of gender programing designed to help <b>program</b> <b>developers</b> and <b>program</b> practitioners better incorporate a gender perspective to achieve greater program impact (Caro, 2009).

40|$|This article {{integrates}} {{previous research}} on program implementation and extends it to form a participatory approach to evaluating program implementation. A central focus of this method is the continuous, active involvement of <b>program</b> <b>developers,</b> managers, and staff in the evaluation process. The methodology accomplishes this goal while maintaining {{a high degree of}} methodological rigor. Initially, program documents are reviewed and several meetings are arranged to discuss the program’s activities with <b>program</b> <b>developers,</b> management, and staff. From these documents and meetings, a series of items describing each program activity and three possible levels of implementation are created and formulated into an implementation inventory. Multiple methods for measuring implementation level are then developed in consul-tation with <b>program</b> <b>developers,</b> management, and staff. Following the collection of data, levels of implementation are determined, and this information is fed back to all concerned parties. Advantages of the participatory approach include increased cooperation of program manage-ment and staff; the setting of quantitatively based, realistic levels of implementation; and the combined usage of quantitative and qualitative information. Throughout the article, the basic procedures are illustrated through the application of the method to an actual program...|$|R
