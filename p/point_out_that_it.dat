5|$|Stirrup: There are {{authors who}} <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> {{is unclear whether}} the stirrup was invented by {{northern}} nomads or the sedentary Chinese. Liu Han (1961) credited {{the invention of the}} stirrup to nomadic invaders of northern China. Archaeologial evidence shows that horse riders in India had a small loop for a single toe to be inserted by roughly the 1st century AD. However, the first true depiction of the stirrup is featured on a Jin Dynasty (265–420) Chinese tomb figurine dated 302 AD, yet this was a single stirrup and was perhaps used only for initially mounting the horse. The first validated depiction of a rider with a pair of saddle stirrups for both feet comes from a Jin Chinese tomb figurine dated 322. The first actual specimens of stirrups comes from a Chinese tomb in southern Manchuria that is dated 415. The stirrup was not widely used by Chinese cavalry until the 5th century. By the 6th century, the use of the stirrup had spread as far west as the Byzantine Empire, where both the stirrup and Celtic horseshoe were adopted.|$|E

25|$|Specialists in Europe's Early Modern {{witchcraft}} beliefs {{view the}} pagan witch-cult theory as pseudohistorical; {{there is an}} academic consensus among experts that those accused and executed as witches during the period were not members of any witch religion, whether pre-Christian or Satanic in nature. Critics highlight that the theory rested on a highly selective use of the evidence from the trials, thereby heavily misrepresenting the events and the actions of both the accused and their accusers. Further, they <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> relied on the erroneous assumption that the claims made by accused witches were truthful and not distorted by coercion and torture. They also note that despite claims that the witch-cult was a pre-Christian survival, {{there is no evidence}} of such a pagan witch-cult throughout the intervening Middle Ages.|$|E

25|$|Emmett J. Roe, {{owner of}} Imperial Foods Products Inc.; his son Brad, who was {{operations}} {{manager for the}} company; and plant manager James N. Hair surrendered on March 13, 1992, and were charged with non-negligent manslaughter. There was no trial. On September 15, 1992, owner Emmett Roe pleaded guilty to 25 counts of involuntary manslaughter. No one else was found guilty. Emmett Roe had personally ordered the doors to be locked from the outside. He received a prison sentence of 19 years and 11 months. The sentence was unpopular among many of the workers and their families who <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> amounts to {{less than a year}} for each dead person. Roe became eligible for parole in March 1994, and was released just under four years into his sentence.|$|E
25|$|Today, {{this theory}} {{is no longer}} accepted. In 1989, Egyptologist Nabil Swelim {{examined}} the pyramid more precisely {{and found that it}} was made of small mud bricks, with a quarter of its inner core hewn out of a natural bedrock. The rock core itself contained several rock-cut tombs dating back to the 5th and 6th dynasty. Swelim and others Egyptologists, such as Toby Wilkinson, <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> would be surprising for a royal pyramid to have been completely destroyed less than 300 years after its construction, only to be re-used for simple rock-cut tombs. Additionally, he points to the unusual geographic position of the pyramid: Old Kingdom pyramids were commonly built on high grounds, while the pyramid Lepsius I lies on a flat plain. Thus, the datation of this monument to the late 3rd dynasty no longer seems tenable.|$|E
25|$|Critics of Ordinatio Sacerdotalis <b>point</b> <b>out,</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was not promulgated {{under the}} {{extraordinary}} papal magisterium as an ex cathedra statement, and therefore {{is not considered}} infallible in itself. Its contents are, however, considered infallible under the ordinary magisterium. Dulles, in a lecture to U.S. bishops, stated that Ordinatio Sacerdotalis is infallible, {{not because of the}} apostolic letter or the clarification by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger alone but because it is based {{on a wide range of}} sources, scriptures, the constant tradition of the Church, and the ordinary and universal magisterium of the Church: Pope John Paul II identified a truth infallibly taught over two thousand years by the Church. Many Catholics believe that it meets all the criteria of an infallible ex cathedra pronouncement, even aside from its repetition of universal magisterial teaching. Other Catholics believe the opposite.|$|E

25|$|Literary critic Hugh M. Richmond {{notes that}} Richard's {{beliefs about the}} Divine Right of Kings tend to fall {{more in line with}} the medieval view of the throne. Bolingbroke on the other hand {{represents}} a more modern view of the throne, arguing that not only bloodline but also intellect and political savvy contribute to the makings of a good king. Richard believes that as king he is chosen and guided by God, that he is not subject to human frailty, and that the English people are his to do with as he pleases. Elliott argues that this mistaken notion of his role as king ultimately leads to Richard's failure. Elliott goes on further to <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is Bolingbroke's ability to relate and speak with those of the middle and lower classes that allows him to take the throne.|$|E
25|$|A third {{argument}} against the theory that Snefru completed Huni's project is newer evaluations of Snefru's time on the throne. According to the Turin Canon, Snefru ruled for 24 years. However, during the Old Kingdom the years of rule were counted biennially, when cattle counts and tax collections were performed, which would mean that Snefru may have ruled for 48 years. The compiler of the Turin Canon {{may not have been}} aware of this long-gone circumstance when redacting his document and would consequently have attributed 24 years to Snefru. Today it is estimated that 48 years of rule would have allowed Snefru to build three pyramids during his lifetime. Additionally, egyptologists such as Rainer Stadelmann <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> was uncommon for rulers during the Old Kingdom to usurp or finish the tomb of a predecessor; all that a succeeding king did was to bury and seal the tomb of his predecessor.|$|E
25|$|Besides {{dealing with}} unexploded {{ordnance}} {{dropped from the}} air, since the Second World War 5131 have been deployed {{to most of the}} major theatres that the UK armed forces have been involved in (Falkland Islands, Kosovo, Iraq and Afghanistan). During the beach landings on the 27 May 1982 at San Carlos in the Falklands Conflict, one of the officers of 5131 (BD) Squadron, needed to assess some unexploded ordnance that was lodged in the walls of the field hospital, but had to wait until daylight to do so. To alleviate the worry for the patients who could not be moved to safer medical care, he opted to sleep that night alongside the unexploded ordnance. In the Afghanistan conflict, members of 5131 (BD) Squadron were part of the Joint Force Counter-IED Task Force alongside the British Army bomb disposal experts although 5131 themselves are keen to <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is not their primary task. Counter IED operations remain the mainstay of the Royal Logistic Corps bomb disposal technicians.|$|E

25|$|In the book, Menzies {{concludes that}} only China had the time, money, {{manpower}} and leadership to send such expeditions and then {{sets out to}} prove that the Chinese visited lands unknown in either China or Europe. He claims that from 1421 to 1423, during the Ming dynasty of China under the Yongle Emperor, the fleets of Admiral Zheng He, commanded by the captains Zhou Wen, Zhou Man, Yang Qing, and Hong Bao, discovered Australia, New Zealand, the Americas, Antarctica, and the Northeast Passage; circumnavigated Greenland, tried to reach the North and South Poles, and circumnavigated the world before Ferdinand Magellan. The book has been published in many languages and countries around the world and was listed as a New York Times best seller for several weeks in 2003. Although the book contains numerous footnotes, references and acknowledgments, critics <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> lacks supporting references for Chinese voyages beyond East Africa, the location acknowledged by professional historians as the limit of the fleet's travels. Menzies bases his main theory on original interpretations and extrapolations of academic studies of minority population DNA, archaeological finds and ancient maps.|$|E

[...] In response to these comments, Sega executive Richard Brudvik-Lindner pointed out that the 32X would play Genesis titles, and had the same system architecture as the Saturn.|$|E
500|$|Kierkegaard later {{referred}} to his concept of choosing yourself as the single individual in The Concept of Anxiety, June 17, 1844, and then in his , August 31, 1844, and once again in Upbuilding Discourses in Various Spirits, 1847. William James echoed Kierkegaard in his lecture on The Sick Soul where he wrote, [...] "the man must die to an unreal life before he can be born into the real life." [...] You are outside yourself and therefore cannot do without the other as opposition; you believe that only a restless spirit is alive, and all who are experienced believe that only a quiet spirit is truly alive. For you a turbulent sea {{is a symbol of}} life; for me it is the quiet, deep water. Either/Or Part II p. 144, HongAnxiety is a qualification of dreaming spirit, and as such it has its place in psychology. Awake, the difference between myself and my other is posited; sleeping, it is suspended; dreaming, it is an intimated nothing. The actuality of the spirit constantly shows itself as a form that tempts its possibility but disappears as soon as it seeks to grasp for it, and it is a nothing that can only bring anxiety. More it cannot do as long as it merely shows itself. The concept of anxiety is almost never treated in psychology. Therefore, I must <b>point</b> <b>out</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> is altogether different from fear and similar concepts that refer to something definite, whereas anxiety is freedom’s actuality as the possibility of possibility. For this reason, anxiety is not found in the beast, precisely because by nature the beast is not qualified as spirit. The Concept of Anxiety, Nichol p. 42 ...|$|E
