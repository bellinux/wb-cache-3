40|$|Peace {{is one of}} {{the most}} desired and basic {{elements}} for humanity on the face of earth. Without this neither evolution nor the social life can function properly. Islam conveys the message of love, peace and harmony and at the same time admonishes pandemonium, restlessness and chaos in society. Humanity on the globe generally and Muslims specifically are passing through very difficult times. Humanity, now a days is passing through various tensions and threats where bedlam {{is one of the}}m either on individual or collective level or on national and international level. In this difficult time, it necessitates to return and revise the teachings of Holy <b>Prophet</b> (<b>S.</b> A. W) as his (S. A. W) teachings are a blessing, sanctified element and gift from Allah which should be studied, understood and practiced so that we may contribute as an effective part of society. Literal meanings of Islam, Muslim and Momin indicate towards the message of love, peace and harmony. Allah has many names and one among them is “Salam” “Peace”. Being Muslims it is our duty to present the peaceful face of Islam as our <b>prophet</b> (<b>S.</b> A. W) fought for the establishment of peace and discouragement of violence in society. According to various books on the life of the Holy <b>Prophet</b> (<b>S.</b> A. W) such as Rahmat Aalam, Nabi Rehmat, Hadi Azam, Muhammad-e-Arbi one of the major achievements of Holy <b>Prophet</b> (<b>S.</b> A. W) is to establish a pious and complete society based on oneness of Allah and divine laws. The divine law which was given by Allah and implemented by Holy <b>Prophet</b> (<b>S.</b> A. W) was based on love, peace and harmony. Rest of the <b>Prophets</b> (A. <b>S)</b> was sent for the accomplishment of the same mission. They all instituted the serenity in societies of their time and ceased off devastations and pandemonium in humanity. It is observed that world is in search of lost peace which has become a dream of present day’s societies, families, and countries. Even peace has vanished from streets and towns at international and national politics, economy, religiosity, individual and collective levels. All this mess is directing towards restlessness, lack of patience, lack of justice and revenge. Humanity and world can come out of this chaotic situation only by acting upon God Almighty’s divine teachings and practices of Holy <b>Prophet</b> (<b>S.</b> A. W). The present research paper is a drop of the rain that overviews and understands prophetic teachings for chaos and establishment of peace...|$|R

It is thus with these that scholars are able to determine the condition of the reports attributed to the <b>Prophet</b> (<b>s.</b> a. w). In this work, we propose to model the transmission of ÍadÊth in the context of binary channels and use the Bayes theorem from basic Probability Theory to discuss authenticity of a narration in a quantitative language.

It is about the good, virtues and perfection and leaders of the past have always been easy on the chain of the transmitters of such hadiths."Some of the sayings in this collection have been attributed to Imam Ali (a) and in some cases, they are similar in meaning and wording. About such ambiguity of reference, the author says, “there are many cases, when similar sayings and reports related to Imam Ali (a) have been reported from the <b>Prophet</b> (<b>s)</b> which some think it is due to transmitters' mistakes.

40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to analyze the {{different}} components of the political ideology of the <b>Prophet</b> <b>s</b> Ummah. By analyzing the various texts the group has published online, the videos they have posted, and various other books, research papers and so on, I have explained exactly what the ideological beliefs of the <b>Prophet</b> <b>s</b> Ummah, {{and see how they}} fit in with the historical roots of Islamism, as well as other contemporary groups. The first part of the analysis is of the general theoretical beliefs. The groups of ideas are defined as descriptive of the world, normative as to how the world should be, and method for achieving this. The second part is to uncover which concrete recommendations the group has for the state and society based on the ideas. My main findings are that the <b>Prophet</b> <b>s</b> Ummah is almost a perfect fit {{when it comes to the}} theoretical basis of Islamism. They show almost every indicator when compared to the historical consensus of what Islamism is, and are sufficiently related to the other contemporary groups. The main descriptive beliefs are that they believe that Islam is struck in some form of civilizational struggle with the rest of the world, particularly the West, that this war is both of a physical and ideological nature, and that the influence from outside-sources has weakened and infected the perfect system given to mankind by Allah; Islam. The normative is that all people should follow a specific type of sharia, which is a divine set of rules meant guide both social and political life. Their recommendation is an Islamic State, or a Caliphate, based on these rules. This must be achieved by any means necessary. As such, they defend the use of violence, and adhere to an offensive understanding of jihad. The concrete solutions and recommendations however, are few. My main conclusion is that the <b>Prophet</b> <b>s</b> Ummah is clear on what they perceive to be the problem, but not on how to solve it. The analysis uncovers that apart from the general belief in an Islamic State, there are few coherent proposals on what it would look like, and how it would run...|$|R

40|$|This article {{addresses}} the ordinance of midnight prayer (ṣalāt al-layl) upon the Holy <b>Prophet</b> (<b>S.</b> A. W.). Given the verses of the Qur’an and the traditions related from the Shī‘as and the Sunnīs {{as well as}} the sayings of the Shī‘a and Sunnī interpreters and jurists about the Apostle of Allah (S. A. W.) ’s midnight prayer, the following three hypotheses can be proposed: First hypothesis: Midnight prayer has, from the beginning, been preferable to the <b>Prophet</b> (<b>S.</b> A. W.), for which four reasons are given, which are weak. Second hypothesis: Midnight prayer has, in the beginning, been obligatory to the <b>Prophet</b> (<b>S.</b> A. W.) and his companions, but later its obligation has been abrogated and remained as preferable. Four reasons have also been presented for this hypothesis, which are not strong enough. Third hypothesis: Since the beginning it had been obligatory upon His Holiness and remained obligatory to the end; the details of the reasons for this view are dealt with in this article. Keywords: nocturnal prayer (tahajjud), obligation, preference, supererogatory, abrogation. این مقاله به حکم نماز شب بر پیامبر اکرم (صلّی الله علیه وآله) می پردازد. با توجه به آیات قرآن و روایات وارده از طریق شیعه و اهل سنت و نیز گفتار مفسران و فقهای شیعه و اهل سنت دربارة نماز شب رسول خدا(صلّی الله علیه وآله) سه فرض را به این شرح می توان بیان کرد: فرض اول: نماز شب از ابتدا بر پیامبر (صلّی الله علیه وآله) مستحب بوده و برای آن چهار دلیل ذکر شده که ضعیف است. فرض دوم: نماز شب در آغاز بر پیامبر (صلّی الله علیه وآله) و یارانش واجب بوده است و بعد وجوب آن نسخ گردیده و به حالت استحباب باقی مانده است. برای این فرض نیز چهار دلیل بیان شده است که از قوت کافی برخوردار نیست. فرض سوم: از ابتدا بر آن حضرت واجب شده است و تا آخر وجوب آن باقی مانده است که مشروح دلایل این نظر را باید در متن مقاله جستجو کرد. کلید واژه ها : تهجد، وجوب، استحباب، نافله، نسخ...|$|R

His face was almost black; and his eyes were open, and staring horribly up at the sky, as though he saw there some dreadful vision. He had evidently been strangled; for on looking, I found on his throat the red marks where fingers had pressed. There seemed so many of these marks that I counted them.
