5|$|Unlike {{atmospheric}} convection—the ordinary {{process of}} lower, warm air rising—inversions leave cooler air suspended below warm air, preventing the lower air from rising and trapping airborne <b>pollutants</b> that would ordinarily disperse in the atmosphere. Such weather events are common, {{but they are}} usually followed by a strong cold front that brings an influx of clean air and disperses <b>pollutants</b> before they {{have enough time to}} become highly concentrated; in this case, a cold front approaching west through southern Canada was delayed. When explained in less formal terms, the process of an inversion causing a smog event has been compared to a lid that holds in <b>pollutants</b> or a balloon that fills with <b>pollutants.</b> In general, smog events occur not because of a sudden increase in a region's output of pollution, but rather because weather conditions like stagnant air prevent the dispersal of <b>pollutants</b> that were already present.|$|E

Annual <b>pollutant</b> load estimates exhibited various behaviors by sampling frequency and also by the regression model used. Several distinct sampling frequency features were observed in the study.

40|$|The {{ventilation}} and <b>pollutant</b> transport in {{a two-dimensional}} (2 D) street canyon of building-height-to-street-width (aspect) ratio h/b =  1 under different unstable stratifications were examined. To characterize the combined wind-buoyancy-driven flow and <b>pollutant</b> transport at different Richardson number Ri, a {{computational fluid dynamics}} (CFD) model based on the Reynolds-averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equations with the Renormalization Group (RNG) k - ε{lunate} turbulence model was adopted. Unlike the isothermal condition, a secondary recirculation is initiated at the ground-level windward corner of the street canyon once the unstable stratification is switched on (Ri <  0). It traps the ground-level <b>pollutant</b> leading to elevated <b>pollutant</b> concentration there. As Ri further decreases, the enlarging secondary recirculation enables direct <b>pollutant</b> removal from its core to the shear layer that offsets the ground-level <b>pollutant</b> accumulation. The ventilation and <b>pollutant</b> removal performance under different unstable stratifications are compared by the air (ACH) and <b>pollutant</b> (PCH) exchange rates, and <b>pollutant</b> retention time (τ). Both the mean and turbulent components of ACH are found to increase with decreasing Ri, suggesting that unstable stratification promotes ventilation in street canyons. Moreover, the CFD results agree well with our theoretical model that ACH 2 varies linearly with Ri. Turbulent transport originally dominates the <b>pollutant</b> removal under isothermal condition. However, progressive domination of <b>pollutant</b> removal by mean wind can be observed with decreasing stability (decreasing Ri from 0 to - 10. 6). The critical value {{is estimated to be}} Ri = - 8, below which mean wind is the major <b>pollutant</b> removal carrier. Reduction in τ is also observed with decreasing Ri. Hence, in unstable stratification, <b>pollutant</b> resides shorter time in the street canyon compared with its isothermal counterpart, and the ventilation and <b>pollutant</b> removal are more favorable. © 2009 Elsevier Ltd.

5|$|There are {{limitations}} {{to the use}} of bivalves as bioindicators. The level of <b>pollutants</b> found in the tissues varies with species, age, size, time of year and other factors. The quantities of <b>pollutants</b> in the water may vary and the molluscs may reflect past rather than present values. In a study of several bivalve species present in lagoons in Ghana {{it was found that the}} findings could be anomalous. Levels of zinc and iron tended to rise in the wet season due to run-off from the galvanized roofing sheets used in many of the houses. Cadmium levels were lower in young animals than in older ones because they were growing so fast that, despite the fact that their bodies were accumulating the metal, the concentration in their tissues reduced. In a study near Vladivostok it was found that the level of <b>pollutants</b> in the bivalve tissues did not always reflect the high levels in the surrounding sediment in such places as harbours. The reason for this was thought to be that the bivalves in these locations did not need to filter so much water as elsewhere because of the water's high nutritional content.|$|E

Finally the impacts of sediment dredging on internal <b>pollutant</b> loading were quantificationally evaluated. It was found that:(1) the deposition thickness, <b>pollutant</b> contents and release intensity of sediments in Neijiang were all distibuted asymmetrically; (2) sediment dredging significantly decreased the basal elevation of Neijiang and cut down the internal <b>pollutant</b> sources by removing the surface contaminated sediments; (3) After dredging the internal <b>pollutant</b> loading under different hydrological conditions in Neijiang was evidently reduced...|$|R

Water pollution incident happened at Fujiang, China, in 2011 belongs to this situation (Wang et al. 2012). On the other hand, the <b>pollutant</b> amount can be figure out easily or the incident perpetrator know the amount of <b>pollutant,</b> but we cannot obtain relate information about pollution source position, so the position is the optimization variable. To forecast the pollution information and carry out rescue measures, using the established identification model of pollution source to identify the <b>pollutant</b> amount into river or <b>pollutant</b> source position is of great importance.|$|R
5|$|When {{they live}} in {{polluted}} waters, bivalve molluscs {{have a tendency to}} accumulate substances such as heavy metals and persistent organic <b>pollutants</b> in their tissues.

This may be a health hazard for the molluscs themselves, and is one for humans who eat them. It also has certain advantages in that bivalves can be used in monitoring the presence and quantity of <b>pollutants</b> in their environment.|$|E

5|$|All {{organisms are}} {{constantly}} exposed to compounds that they cannot use as foods {{and would be}} harmful if they accumulated in cells, as they have no metabolic function. These potentially damaging compounds are called xenobiotics. Xenobiotics such as synthetic drugs, natural poisons and antibiotics are detoxified {{by a set of}} xenobiotic-metabolizing enzymes. In humans, these include cytochrome P450 oxidases, UDP-glucuronosyltransferases, and glutathione S-transferases. This system of enzymes acts in three stages to firstly oxidize the xenobiotic (phase I) and then conjugate water-soluble groups onto the molecule (phase II). The modified water-soluble xenobiotic can then be pumped out of cells and in multicellular organisms may be further metabolized before being excreted (phase III). In ecology, these reactions are particularly important in microbial biodegradation of <b>pollutants</b> and the bioremediation of contaminated land and oil spills. Many of these microbial reactions are shared with multicellular organisms, but due to the incredible diversity of types of microbes these organisms are able to deal with a far wider range of xenobiotics than multicellular organisms, and can degrade even persistent organic <b>pollutants</b> such as organochloride compounds.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: A {{series of}} {{two-dimensional}} (2 D) street canyon models {{with a wide}} range of building-height-to-street-width (aspect) ratios are employed in this study to elucidate the <b>pollutant</b> transport over idealized urban areas. The large-eddy simulation (LES) is used to resolve the turbulent flows and <b>pollutant</b> transport in the urban boundary layer (UBL) over the street canyons. An area source of uniform <b>pollutant</b> concentration is applied on the ground of the first street canyon to examine the <b>pollutant</b> plume dispersion behaviors over the downstream building roughness elements. The LES results show that, for the street canyon with the <b>pollutant</b> source, the <b>pollutant</b> removal is governed by atmospheric turbulence in both skimming flow and wake-interference regimes. Statistical analysis reveals that the turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) is peaked near the top of the building roughness elements that contributes most to turbulent <b>pollutant</b> removal. The roof-level TKE distribution also demonstrates that the turbulence production is not governed by local wind shear. Instead, the descending TKE from the UBL plays a more important role. In the UBL, the vertical <b>pollutant</b> profiles illustrate self-similarity behaviours in the downstream region. The <b>pollutant</b> disperses rapidly over the buildings, exhibiting a Gaussian-plume shape. Maximum vertical <b>pollutant</b> dispersion coefficient is observed at aspect ratio equal to 1 / 10.

The {{results show that the}} <b>pollutant</b> removal is mainly governed by atmospheric turbulence when <b>pollutant</b> sources exist in the street canyons. Numerous decelerating, uprising air masses are located at the roof level, implying that the <b>pollutant</b> is removed from the street canyons to the urban boundary layer (UBL) by ejections. For the street canyons without <b>pollutant</b> source, the removal by ejections is limited leading to insignificant turbulent <b>pollutant</b> removal. The roof-level turbulent kinetic energy (TKE) distribution demonstrates that its production is not governed by local wind shear but the descending TKE from the UBL.
