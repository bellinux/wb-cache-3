40|$|The vital {{activity}} {{processes of}} the living organism tissues in the standard conditions and at certain external actions are investigated. The original schemes of functioning the living organism tissues in the standard conditions and at presence of the damaging factors have been specified. The mathematical models of the processes passing in the tissues have been constructed; these models perpesent the systems of differential equations with parameters. The conditions of existing integral of the tissues integrity and system equilibrium position at different structure of the parameters have been obtained at analysis of the models. The evaluations of the system restoration time and <b>permissible</b> <b>damage</b> level have been shown, the mechanisms of the external action on the system have been studied, the problem on {{the identification of the}} system parameters has been formulatedAvailable from VNTIC / VNTIC - Scientific & Technical Information Centre of RussiaSIGLERURussian Federatio...|$|E
40|$|All {{interventions}} {{pertaining to}} remediation, strengthening and reconstruction of building structures (BS) in seismic areas, to which belong the immovable cultural property (ICP) buildings which are ranked as building structures (ICPBS), are constructed {{according to the}} (Code no. 52 / 85), [10]. This code permits structural damage of buildings without collapse {{in the event of}} the strongest earthquakes. However, this condition is unacceptable for ICPBS which have a status of high and outstandingly high importance according to the Law on Cultural property (LCP no. 71 / 94) [13]. Because of their special value and importance for cultural heritage ICPBS should not only survive the most intensive earthquakes, but their damage should be considerably reduced in comparison with ordinary BS. Therefore the paper proposes to divide ICPBS into three categories: ICPBS outstandingly high importance listed by UNESCO 2) ICPBS of outstanding cultural importance and 3) ICPBS of high cultural importance. For all categories, the factors for determination of ICPBS value are introduced, and therefore is determined the level of <b>permissible</b> <b>damage</b> they can be exposed to and potential risk of the loss of life in ICPBS which can be a basis for a new 'Code for strengthening and remediation of ICPBS in seismic areas', or can be appended to the existing Code no 52 / 85, [10]...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 2004 Performance-based {{design has}} gained {{interest}} {{in recent years}} among structural designers and researchers. Performance-based design includes selection of appropriate building sites, structural systems and configurations, as well as analytical procedures used in the design process, {{to confirm that the}} structure has adequate strength, stiffness and energy dissipation capacity to respond to the design loads without exceeding <b>permissible</b> <b>damage</b> states. Although performance-based seismic design has advanced for some materials and structural types, such as steel and reinforced concrete buildings and bridges, its application to light-frame structures remains largely unexplored. The objective of this research was to explore the potential for the application of performance-based engineering concepts to the design and assessment of woodframe structures subject to earthquakes. Nonlinear dynamic time-history analysis was used to predict the performance of shearwalls considering a suite of scaled characteristic ordinary ground motions to represent the seismic hazard. Sensitivity studies were performed to investigate the relative effects of damping, sheathing properties, fastener type and spacing, panel layout, and other properties on the performance of wood shearwalls. In addition, the effects of uncertainty in ground motions and variability in sheathing-to-framing connection hysteretic parameters were investigated. Issues such as the contribution of nonstructural finish materials, different seismic hazard regions, and construction quality also were investigated and modification factors to adjust peak displacement distributions were developed. The peak displacement distributions were then used to construct performance curves and design charts as a function of seismic weights for two baseline walls. Finally, fragility curves were developed for the baseline walls considering different nailing schedules, corresponding allowable seismic weights, and various overstrength (R) factors...|$|E
40|$|Profit on {{proprietary}} research tools {{is determined}} partly by the remedies for infringement, such as damages and injunctions. We investigate how damages under a liability rule {{and the opportunity}} for injunctions under a property rule can affect the incentives to develop research tools. We show that the prevailing legal doctrine of damages under liability rule, called lost profit or reasonable royalty, suffers from a logical circularity which leads to an indeterminacy in <b>permissible</b> <b>damages.</b> This can create insufficient incentives to develop research tools. Incentives can be improved either by a property rule with injunctions or by a liability rule under the doctrine of unjust enrichment. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{conditions}} {{leading to}} transfer of aircraft engines to "technical-condition" operation have been formulated; {{the structure of}} the plan controlling the service life has been developed; methods of substantiating the service life of the main parts of the engines by the criteria of safe durability and <b>permissible</b> <b>damages</b> have been devised {{on the basis of the}} use of high-level design models and statistical data on the structural strength of materials. Methods of designing, estimating the strength reliability and service life of the parts made of heat-proof non-metal materials have been devised. The equipment has been created, and methods of studying carbon-carbon and ceramic materials at a temperature of up to 2200 degrees C have been developed. Mechanisms of erosion failure and wear of various structural materials have been investigated; the requirements for erosion-resistant coatings have been drawn up; ion-plasma and multi-component diffusion coatings have been optimized to increase the reliability and service life of the engines. The results obtained are the new ones, they have been applied when drawing up standard-technical documents relating to the provision of safety and control of the service life during the engine operation, development, certification and controlling the engine service life, achieving advanced design-technological solutions.

40|$|Nowadays, technologists {{in charge}} of repair, restoration, modernization, and {{utilization}} of engineering and other tangible objects widely use the concepts "renovation" and "renovation technologies" pioneered at BMSTU. In forming a new field of science these concepts, in the proper sense of the word, are of composite, generalized character. They concern all the activities and technologies aimed at increasing an object resource or its lifecycle extension, including object material recycling. In the cutting-edge renovation technologies an object (part, assembly, machine, etc.) damaged in the operating process {{is considered to be}} an initial billet. In renovation, one of the most widespread kinds of initial billets is a damaged part. Such a part can be used again, if, for example, it has saved its material properties in full measure while only contact surfaces or parts of these surfaces have become damaged, and at a point of renovation they can be restored for recycling. If a part has lost its initial properties in full bulk of material, it may be reusable in the assemblies and machines with less rigid requirements for material properties. Or in case of properties loss below the <b>permissible</b> level a <b>damaged</b> part-billet is utilized. Thus, the part-billet state at the point of renovation defines the kind of renovation technology and the main (basic) technological method to effect on the damaged part, as well as a set and a sequence of technological methods in general manufacturing process of renovation. However renovation technologies are used not only at the repair and restoration stages after operation-service. So, at the manufacturing stage of a new product to provide the quality to raise a resource are applied the same technological methods as renovation technologies for the objects damaged at the stage of operation. Besides, it is known that at the manufacturing stage a part quality depends not only on the last operation, but also on the features of power effects of all previous operations beginning with the material for initial billet of new product. As expertise based on different kinds of manufacturing shows in producing the traditional billets (castings, forged pieces, welded assemblies), the inherent renovation technologies are widely used to eliminate the faulty parts. Consequently, blank products damaged at the stage of their manufacturing can be considered to be another most widespread kind of initial billets in renovation technologies. A renovated object material itself with its properties to be mandatory changed, in renovation may be considered as a further specific kind of initial billet. Earlier it was not stated. It {{should be noted that the}} term" renovation technologies" refers to all kinds of technologies which enable "extending the product lifecycle" i. e. tangible object â€“ product of manufacturing processes. It is the same classification notion as, for example, a concept "methods of primary forming" when it comes to the methods, which simultaneously in full blast of material form a structure and a product shape (castings, shaping, welding, powder metallurgy, etc.). Thus, renovation technologies also include an entire group of processing methods to increase or extend an object resource at all stages of its lifecycle. These may be, for example, methods such as thermal treatment, strengthening technology, coating processes, etc. And all the objects subjected to the power deposition of abovementioned methods may be, respectively, considered to be the initial billets for renovation A special kind of initial billets in renovation also include, for example, manufacturing processes in case of their restructuring or improvement, reconstructed industries, shops, and factories. Besides, these are engineering drawings paperwork, guidance documentation, and reference literature, when making their amendments, complements or improvement. Thus, a view of initial billet is in compliance with the tasks to be solved in renovation and with the manufacturing processes, which provide the best quality, performance report, and guarantee of durability for the objects, materials, manufacturing processes, which are damaged, morally and physically outdated, new, but do not meet the specified requirements. </p...|$|R
