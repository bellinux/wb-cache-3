40|$|Asset {{management}} is a systematic process of maintaining, upgrading and operating assets. Several agencies are applying asset management principles {{as a business}} tool and model to help them define goals and prioritize agency resources in decision making. Road asset {{management is}} focused on bridges, traffic signs, pavement markings, culverts. This project focuses {{on the development of}} traffic sign asset management system. For this we have to conduct a visual night time inspection method to find the Retro-reflectivity of a sign. This survey will be conducted at regular night time intervals. This survey will be conducted at minimum vehicle distances with vehicle high beam lights. And some of traffic signs should be failed the test they should not visible to the driver. And some signs need for maintenance. The study findings indicate that making a business case for formal asset management programs. In the management study, we have to take manufacture cost of each sign and maintenance cost of the signs. For this we need to replace the some signs and maintenance should be required for some signs. And should note the latitude and longitude of the sign and create a file in the arc GIS and should <b>plot</b> <b>a</b> <b>position</b> of the each sign...|$|E

50|$|In hydrology, therefore, the Gumbel {{distribution}} {{is used to}} analyze such variables as monthly and annual maximum values of daily rainfall and river discharge volumes, and also to describe droughts. Gumbel has also shown that the estimator r/(n+1) for the probability of an event - where r is the rank number of the observed value in the data series and n is {{the total number of}} observations - is an unbiased estimator of the cumulative probability around the mode of the distribution. Therefore, this estimator is often used as <b>a</b> <b>plotting</b> <b>position.</b>|$|R
30|$|Grid {{sampling}} {{was used}} to locate 493 field plots throughout the study forest. Plots were located at the intersections of a grid that had a randomised start point and orientation. The sampling unit was a 0.06 -ha bounded, circular field <b>plot.</b> <b>A</b> survey-grade global <b>positioning</b> system (GPS) {{was used to}} fix the centre of each plot. This fix was differentially corrected using local base stations following acquisition. Diameter at breast height (dbh) was measured for all trees within each field plot. Tree height was measured for <b>a</b> subset of <b>plot</b> trees that were free from excessive lean or malformation and were selected from across the dbh range. The silvicultural history and stand age for each plot was extracted from the stand records maintained by the forest manager.|$|R
5000|$|Ground-based radars {{like the}} SCR-584 {{automated}} this process {{early in their}} evolution. In search mode the SCR-584 rotated its antenna through 360 degrees and any returns were <b>plotted</b> on <b>a</b> plan <b>position</b> indicator (PPI). This gave the operators an indication of any targets within its ~25 mile detection range and their direction relative to the radar van. When one of the returns was considered interesting, the radar was flipped to tracking mode and [...] "locked-on". From then on it would automatically keep its antenna pointed at the target, feeding out accurate direction, altitude and range information on a B-Scope display. Operator workload was greatly reduced.|$|R
50|$|The Morrow <b>Plots</b> occupy <b>a</b> central <b>position</b> on {{the campus}} of the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign (UIUC), between the Main Quad and the South Quad. They are bounded on the south by West Gregory Drive, the north by the Observatory, the east by the Woese Institute for Genomic Biology, and the west by the Undergraduate Library. The plots {{currently}} consist of six small fields, each one-tenth of an acre in size. The two northernmost plots have been continuously planted in maize (corn) since 1876. The middle plots were originally planted in a rotation of corn and oats, with the oats replaced by soybeans in 1968. The southern plots were originally planted in a rotation of three years corn followed by three years meadow; this was replaced in 1901 by a rotation of corn, oats, and clover, and in 1953 by corn, oats, and alfalfa.|$|R
5000|$|The United States Naval Academy {{announced}} that it was discontinuing its course on celestial navigation, considered to be one of its most demanding non-engineering courses, from the formal curriculum in the spring of 1998. It stated that a sextant is accurate to a three-mile (5 km) radius, while a satellite-linked computer can pinpoint a ship within 60 ft as long as the satellites are functioning correctly. Midshipmen continued to learn to use the sextant, but instead of performing a tedious 22-step mathematical calculation to <b>plot</b> <b>a</b> ship's <b>position,</b> midshipmen feed the raw data into a computer. The US Naval Academy continued to practice celestial navigation for members of the USNA Varsity Offshore Sailing Team (VOST) and competes in the celestial spinnaker division in the bi-annual Marion-Bermuda Race racing aboard the venerable Navy 44 sail training craft. The Naval Academy Sailing Squadron (NASS) that consists of both the Offshore Sail Training Squadron (OSTS) and VOST crews use both long forms with paper plotting sheets and electronic celestial applications. Celestial navigation certification is required to achieve the highest [...] "E" [...] qualification at NASS. In October 2015, citing concerns about the reliability of GPS systems in the face of potential hostile hacking, the USNA reinstated instruction in celestial navigation in the 2015-2016 academic year. At another federal service academy, the US Merchant Marine Academy, there was no break in instruction in celestial navigation as it is required to pass the US Coast Guard License Exam. It is also taught at Harvard, most recently as Astronomy 2.|$|R

40|$|Abstract The {{experiment}} {{was conducted at}} University of Uyo Teaching and Research Farm to evaluate slash and burn method of land clearing which {{is an integral part}} of the traditional farming system and is widely used as a mean of land clearing to pave way to minimum or zero tillage. <b>A</b> <b>plot</b> of land measuring 720 m 2 on a slope of 7 % was used, divided into six plots, each measuring 40 x 3 m 2 in the burnt and unburnt <b>plots,</b> with <b>a</b> landscape <b>position</b> described as the upper slope, middle slope and valley bottom. Progressively, fire was set into three out of the six plots. And soil samples collected in the respective burnt and un-burnt plots at two depths of 0. 15 m and 0. 30 m for soil physical properties analysis in the upper slope, middle slope and valley bottom. Descriptive statistics within the plots showed that variability was high in the three landscape positions in the burnt plot, while in the unburnt plots variability was moderate. In paired samples correlation analysis, the relationship between the baseline and weight of soil parameters after burning were not statistically significant, except silt contents (r = 0. 999) (p< 0. 05) with almost a perfect correlation, unlike the other measured or determined parameters where changes were not consistent...|$|R
40|$|The {{analyses}} of rainfall characteristics form {{the core of}} the hydrological design of rainwater catchment system. Of importance are such aspects as rainfall amount, rainfall distribution, length of wet and dry spells, drought severity among others. The coefficient of variation, unlike the standard deviation, does not depend on the annual totals but only on the degree of variation between the monthly totals for each year. Rainfall amount and rainfall distribution are analysed by calculating the probability of exceedence for each value according to <b>a</b> <b>plotting</b> <b>position</b> formula devised by Weibull. The results indicate that in the hydrological design of rainwater catchment system, two aspects of rainfall are of paramount importance. These are rainfall amount and rainfall distribution. The hydrological design leads to the determination of the major parameters of catchment area and tank size. This study therefore serves to demonstrate adequately that rainfall amount influence catchment size while rainfall distribution influences the storage capacity.

50|$|The {{measured}} angle {{between the}} celestial {{body and the}} visible horizon {{is directly related to}} the distance between the celestial body's GP and the observer's position. After some computations, referred to as sight reduction, this measurement is used to <b>plot</b> <b>a</b> line of <b>position</b> (LOP) on <b>a</b> navigational chart or plotting work sheet, the observer's position being somewhere on that line. (The LOP is actually a short segment of a very large circle on the earth which surrounds the GP of the observed celestial body. An observer located anywhere on the circumference of this circle on the earth, measuring the angle of the same celestial body above the horizon at that instant of time, would observe that body to be at the same angle above the horizon.) Sights on two celestial bodies give two such lines on the chart, intersecting at the observer's position (actually, the two circles would result in two points of intersection arising from sights on two stars described above, but one can be discarded since it will be far from the estimated position—see the figure at example below). Most navigators will use sights of three to five stars, if they're available, since that will result in only one common intersection and minimize the chance for error. That premise is the basis for the most commonly used method of celestial navigation, and is referred to as the 'altitude-intercept method'.|$|R

50|$|An {{analemma}} can {{be traced}} by plotting {{the position of the}} Sun as viewed from <b>a</b> fixed <b>position</b> on Earth at the same clock time every day for an entire year, or by <b>plotting</b> <b>a</b> graph of the Sun's declination against the equation of time. The resulting curve resembles a long, slender figure-eight with one lobe much larger than the other. This curve is commonly printed on terrestrial globes, usually in the eastern Pacific Ocean, the only large tropical region with very little land. It is possible, though challenging, to photograph the analemma, by leaving the camera in <b>a</b> fixed <b>position</b> for <b>an</b> entire year and snapping images on 24-hour intervals (or some multiple thereof); see section below.|$|R
