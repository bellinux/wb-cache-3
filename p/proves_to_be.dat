40|$|Abstract. A {{constructive}} {{proof of}} the Gödel-Rosser incompleteness theorem [9] has been completed using the Coq proof assistant. Some theory of classical first-order logic over an arbitrary language is formalized. A development of primitive recursive functions is given, and all primitive recursive functions <b>are</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> representable in a weak axiom system. Formulas and proofs are encoded as natural numbers, and functions operating on these codes <b>are</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> primitive recursive. The weak axiom system <b>is</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> essentially incomplete. In particular, Peano arithmetic <b>is</b> <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> consistent in Coq’s type theory and therefore is incomplete. ...|$|R

5|$|Children with high-functioning autism {{suffer from}} more intense and {{frequent}} loneliness compared to non-autistic peers, despite the common belief {{that children with}} autism prefer to be alone. Making and maintaining friendships often <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> difficult for those with autism. For them, the quality of friendships, not the number of friends, predicts how lonely they feel. Functional friendships, such as those resulting in invitations to parties, may {{affect the quality of}} life more deeply.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} stories Laureline {{generally}} {{sits in the}} background while Valérian saves the day in whatever situation the pair have found themselves, but her position changes as the series develops. World Without Stars, {{in which the two}} characters are separated for most of the adventure, allows Laureline to step out from under Valérian's shadow for the first time, and she <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> more than an equal to Valérian in ensuring that their mission succeeds.|$|E

5|$|Junior doctors {{usually have}} these {{acquired}} memories erased {{as soon as}} possible. However, as a doctor rises up through the hospital hierarchy, and if its mind <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> sufficiently stable, it may find itself the permanent recipient {{of one or more}} tapes. Diagnosticians, the medical elite of Sector General, can have as many as ten different tapes active at one time, as they may have to supervise treatment of many species at the same time.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, Homer {{suffers a}} back injury from the rodeo and sees a chiropractor, but does not follow his instructions. Later, Homer falls {{backwards}} onto a round garbage can at home and discovers that it solved his back problems. He makes a business out of his discovery, which <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a successful method of solving problems with pain, causing the chiropractic business decline until the chiropractors in town denounce the method and destroy the garbage can at the Simpsons' home.|$|E
5|$|The {{notion of}} {{evolution}} equations is intimately tied in with {{another aspect of}} general relativistic physics. In Einstein's theory, {{it turns out to}} be impossible to find a general definition for a seemingly simple property such as a system's total mass (or energy). The main reason is that the gravitational field—like any physical field—must be ascribed a certain energy, but that it <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> fundamentally impossible to localize that energy.|$|E
30|$|Data {{collected}} for annual valuations {{of the estate}} provided much of the data. Previous estimates <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> too low, and higher values have been substituted here.

5000|$|These monkey gladiators <b>proved</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a {{formidable}} opponent for the canine warrior; owners and handlers of fighting dogs frequently underestimated the monkey's abilities.

5|$|The right whales' two known predators are {{humans and}} orcas. When danger lurks, {{a group of}} right whales may cluster into a circle, and thrash their outwards-pointing tails. They may also head for shallow water, which {{sometimes}} <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an ineffective defense. Aside from the strongly-build tails and massive heads equipping with callosities, {{the sheer size of}} this animal is its best defense, although young calves are the most vulnerable to orca and shark attacks.|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later Luis is elected Chair of the ship's ruling council, and helps bring about a {{settlement}} wherein the people on board can choose {{whether or not to}} stay on the ship, and also choose whether the ship stays in orbit around Hsin Ti Chiu. Hsing has a child by Hiroshi, but Hiroshi dies soon afterward, of heart failure. The ship's educational curriculum is revised, and all schools are required to allow teachers who are not angels to teach material relevant to living on the new planet. The new planet <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> habitable by humans, and around a quarter of the ship's population moves to it, settling down despite the difficulty of learning to live on a planet again. The ship leaves, not intending to return.|$|E

Though he tries to make amends the next day, Smithers again bungles his duties and {{attempts}} to drown himself in the water cooler out of guilt, so Burns suggests he take a vacation. Seeking a replacement who will not outshine him, Smithers purposely selects Homer for the job. Burns soon <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> ridiculously demanding {{for someone who has}} not devoted his life to him like Smithers. After putting up with Mr. Burns' constant abuse for several days, Homer finally snaps and punches Burns. Fearing he has killed the old man, Homer runs away in panic, and hides at home.|$|E

When Linguini spills a pot of soup and attempts to recreate it, Remy recognizes that he is ruining it instead, and repairs Linguini's mistakes. Linguini catches Remy but hides him when he is then confronted by Skinner for tampering with the soup. As the two argue, the soup is accidentally served and <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> a success. The Chefs convince Skinner to retain Linguini, who is assumed to be the soup's creator. When Skinner catches Remy trying to escape, he orders Linguini to kill the rat, but Linguini discovers Remy's intelligence and decides to keep him instead.|$|E
5|$|Less than a {{year after}} the events of Guilty Gear, reports of a newly {{discovered}} commander Gear surfaced. Amid concern about a second war, another Holy Knights Tournament begins; whoever captures and kills Dizzy will receive 500,000 World Dollars.

Shortly after, she is found by Ky Kiske, the police chief of the United Nations and ex-chief of the Sacred Order of Holy Knights. He entrusts her care to Johnny and May, members of the Jellyfish Air Pirates, who welcome her as one of their own. Jam Kuradoberi, a bounty hunter and struggling chef, claims the credit for Dizzy's disappearance so she can collect the reward and finance her restaurant.|$|E

50|$|Specialized plasma heat torches {{can be used}} in {{construction}} to heat up soil, a technique that has <b>proven</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> useful for providing more solid footing for buildings and structures.

5|$|Meanwhile, Quagmire accidentally knocks over {{a carton}} of Kool-Aid mix {{on the kitchen floor}} of the Griffin's house and leaves Peter to take the blame. Frustrated with having to clean Peter's messes, Lois hires a Hispanic maid named Consuela to clean their house. But Consuela quickly <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> very stubborn, refusing to leave after her work hours and {{sleeping}} at the Griffins' house overnight, much to Peter and Lois' annoyance. They try to fire her and even bribe her to leave, but she still refuses (though she takes the money they offer her anyway). In a last-ditch attempt, Peter finally gets rid of her by tricking her into inhaling chloroform on a handkerchief, and leaves her in a basket on Joe's front porch.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, {{the others}} {{arrive at the}} cabin for the hunting trip. Leslie (Amy Poehler) <b>proves</b> <b>to</b> <b>be</b> an {{excellent}} hunter and bags the first quail.

Ann, a nurse, takes Ron back to the cabin, where he is absolutely furious even though the injury is not serious. Ron asks whether Leslie shot him, but she insists she did not. Ron takes several pain pills and washes it down with scotch, which forces Ann and Leslie to hold his mouth open and induce vomiting, despite fierce opposition from Ron himself.|$|E

Micaëla is discovered; at first, José will not leave with her despite Carmen's mockery, but he agrees to go when told that his mother is dying. As he departs, vowing he will return, Escamillo is heard in the distance, singing the toreador's song.|$|E
