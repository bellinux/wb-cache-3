Parrington represented the <b>Progressive</b> <b>School</b> of historians which stressed the duality of good versus evil in the American past. Yet, in his final volume of Main Currents he concluded that the Jeffersonian farmer, the Progressives' traditional democratic hero, had joined forces with the greedy business community to produce a destructive form of capitalism which culminated in the 1920s.|$|E

Rushdoony was frequently called as an expert witness by the Home School Legal Defense Association (HSLDA) in court cases. He frequently advocated the use of private schools.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} years of the Second City and Game Theater, several parents and Lincoln Park {{community}} members—including Carol and Paul Sills and Mona and Dennis Cunningham—started a <b>progressive</b> <b>school</b> for their children, based on Viola Spolin's Theater Games techniques and philosophy with her son Paul Sills' refinements. Theater Games were gaining recognition and are now incorporated in drama therapy, play therapy, and are used as an educational tool. Early Second City and Game Theater members, as well as some Old Town and Lincoln Park community members, were closely involved, including the Sillses and Cunninghams, Viola Spolin, Joyce and Byrne Piven, John Schultz, Mel Spiegel, and Beverly Gold. The highly progressive curriculum included daily theater games, and some students went on to careers in entertainment. Briefly at the original Old Town theater site at the intersection of Clark, Wells, and Lincoln Avenue, the school moved to several locations in Lincoln Park before it closed in the mid-1970s.|$|E

500|$|Summerhill is A. S. Neill's [...] "aphoristic and anecdotal" [...] {{account of}} his [...] "famous" [...] "early <b>progressive</b> <b>school</b> {{experiment}} in England" [...] founded in the 1920s, Summerhill School. The book's intent is to demonstrate the origins and effects of unhappiness, and then show how to raise children to avoid this unhappiness. It is an [...] "affirmation {{of the goodness of}} the child". Summerhill is the story of Summerhill School's origins, its programs and pupils, how they live and are affected by the program, and Neill's own educational philosophy. It is split into seven chapters that introduce the school and discuss parenting, sex, morality and religion, [...] "children's problems", [...] "parents' problems", and [...] "questions and answers".|$|E

[...] The writer Sigurd Hoel asked: [...] "When did it become a reason for deportation that one looked in a microscope when one was not a trained biologist?" [...] Reich received support from overseas, first from the anthropologist Bronisław Malinowski, who in March wrote to the press in Norway that Reich's sociological works were [...] "a distinct and valuable contribution toward science," [...] and from A.S.

500|$|John Vaizey (The Spectator) spotlighted the book's {{emphasis}} on [...] "the innate goodness of children" [...] {{and how the}} <b>progressive</b> <b>school</b> movement's {{emphasis on}} freedom had spread into the public schools. Vaizey put Neill's Summerhill in a disappearing lineage of post-World War I experimental schools that focused on freedom from directed games, classics curriculum, and prudery. He wrote in 1962 that [...] "Summerhill is clearly one of England's greatest schools" [...] and that the decline of this experimental school tradition was a tragedy. Still, Deutsch (Journal of Individual Psychology) wrote that Summerhill had not been [...] "duplicated" [...] in the four decades since its creation. The Booklist noted Neill's [...] "scant credit" [...] awarded to prior progressive and experimental schools, and added that {{the addition of a}} British inspection report added objective credibility to the book. Hartup (Contemporary Psychology) described Neill's style as [...] "bewitchingly direct, even epigrammatic" [...] though also [...] "patchy", leaving many discussions incomplete.|$|E

500|$|Fifty Years of Freedom: A Study of the Development of the Ideas of A.S. Neill is a 1972 {{intellectual}} {{biography of}} the British pedagogue A.S. Neill by Ray Hemmings. It traces how Homer Lane, Wilhelm Reich, Sigmund Freud and others influenced Neill as he developed the [...] "Summerhill idea", the philosophy of child autonomy behind his Summerhill School. The book follows Neill's early life and career in rural, Calvinist Scotland and continues through the influence of his mentors, Lane and Reich, and the origins of Summerhill after World War I. Written fifty years from Summerhill's founding, Fifty Years is a sociological and historical analysis of Neill's ideas {{in the context of}} intellectual and educational trends both during Neill's life and at the time of publication. Hemmings also surveyed <b>progressive</b> <b>school</b> leaders about Neill's impact on the field, and reported their perception of influence on teacher–pupil relations. Fifty Years was first published in England in 1972 by George Allen and Unwin, and was later renamed Children's Freedom: A. S. Neill and the Evolution of the Summerhill Idea for its 1973 American publication by Schocken Books.|$|E
500|$|In 1938, Imogen {{had visited}} Dartington Hall, a <b>progressive</b> <b>school</b> and crafts {{community}} near Totnes in Devon, {{which had been}} founded in 1925 by Leonard and Dorothy Elmhirst. [...] In 1941–42, while travelling for CEMA in Devon and Cornwall, she was invited by the Elmhirsts to make her base at Dartington. In the summer of 1942, while recuperating there, she was persuaded by Christopher Martin, the centre's administrator, to resign her CEMA role and work at Dartington. He had in mind a music course, [...] "the {{sort of thing that}} your father did in the old days at Morley College". Beginning in 1943, Imogen established [...] a one-year [...] course, initially designed to train young women to organise amateur orchestras and musical events in rural communities. Gradually it developed into a more general musical education for a broader student intake. Under Imogen's leadership the course quickly became the hub of a range of musical activities, including the foundation of an amateur orchestra: [...] "Hardly any of us could play... However bad we were, we went on". Imogen's teaching methods, heavily based on [...] "learning by doing" [...] and without formal examinations, at first disconcerted her students and puzzled the school inspectors, but eventually gained acceptance and respect. Rosamond Strode, a pupil at Dartington who later worked with Imogen at Aldeburgh, said of her approach: [...] "She knew exactly how, and when, to push her victims in at the deep end, and she knew, also, that although they would flounder and splash about at first, it wouldn't be long before... they would be swimming easily while she beamed approval from the bank".|$|E

On the surface a discourse on crystallography, it represents a metaphorical exploration of social and political ideals. In the 1880s, Ruskin became involved with another educational institution, Whitelands College, a training college for teachers, where he instituted a May Queen festival that endures today.

In 1934, Tobey and Leach traveled together through France and Italy, then sailed from Naples to Hong Kong and Shanghai, where they parted company. Leach went on to Japan, while Tobey remained in Shanghai visiting his old friend, Teng Kuei, before departing for Japan. Japanese authorities confiscated and destroyed an edition of 31 drawings on wet paper that Tobey had brought with him from England to be published in Japan. No explanation for their destruction has been noted; possibly they considered his sketches of nude men pornographic. In early summer, he studied Hai-Ku poetry and calligraphy at a Zen monastery outside Kyoto before returning to Seattle in autumn.|$|E
