It is essential to make performance measurements of photovoltaics modules in order to quantify the power they will produce under operational conditions. Performance measurements are fundamental throughout the photovoltaic industry, from product development to quality control in manufacturing and installation in the field. Rapid and economic evaluation of photovoltaic performance requires measurements using pulsed illumination solar simulators.

ObjectivesThis study aims to quantify in vitro, hemodynamic and valvular regurgitation of ED SA in circular and elliptic deployment conditions. MethodA <b>pulsed</b> <b>simulator</b> reproducing the human circulation was used. ED SA 23 and 26 were implanted in circular annulus with increasing diameter (18, 20, 22 mm for the size 23 and 21, 23, 25 mm for 26) and in 4 elliptic annulus for each size prosthesis (3 annulus with increasing Eccentricity Index (EI) at 0. 17, 0. 26, 0. 33 starting to a small fixed diameter and 1 with the smallest and biggest diameters of circular annulus). The Effective Orifice Area (EOA) was calculated by the continuity equation and mean transvalvular gradient (TVG) were obtained by Doppler. The performance index (PI= 100 x(EOA/annulus area) was calculated. The ultrasound allowed the research of regurgitation, quantified by flow measurement. ResultsThe highest TVG were observed for circular annulus 18 and 20 mm, respectively 17. 7 and 12. 2 mmHg, which was correlated with the lowest EOA (1. 27 and 1. 44 cm 2). We observed a mismatch leaflets-stent for annulus 18 with plicature of leaflets. Hemodynamic parameters and mean PI (48. 5 vs 43. 2) were better with elliptic geometry than circular. No significant intraprosthetic regurgitation was observed. Just 1 paraprosthetic regurgitation occured for the ED SA 26 in the elliptic annulus with largest EI.

40|$|CIS PV {{technology}} has demonstrated relatively high module efficiencies and is becoming {{established in the}} market for standard applications. The method for energy yield prediction based on performance surfaces under development at the ESTI laboratory uses the module temperature and incident irradiance as independent variables and has proved successful in prediction of real energy production for crystalline Si modules. However, the determination of an energy rating of CIS modules is more complex and it was found to be difficult to accurately predict the module performance based on simulator measurements. The Energy Rating procedure is based on determining the maximum power point Pmax {{as a function of the}} irradiance and the ambient temperature using <b>pulsed</b> <b>simulator</b> measurements. Short and long term outdoor measurements have been performed in order to test the method's accuracy. It has been observed that the power measured on the simulator is in general lower than that measured outdoors and this is a significant cause of the difficulties in making accurate energy predictions. The short circuit current has not been found to be different, however, rather the difference is due to lower open circuit voltage and fill factor. It is known that light soaking can increase these parameters, and a study has been made of the short term effect of light soaking on the module. It has been found that the light soaking does increase the power measured on the simulator, but the light soaking loses its effect very quickly, and it is therefore important to measure the module very quickly following the light soaking. The effect of the measurement speed has also been studied by varying the time taken to perform the IV scan, since this is also a key difference between the indoor and outdoor measurements. JRC.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a {{calibration}} procedure and {{good laboratory practice}} {{on the use of}} a commercial fast spectroradiometer for the measurements of the emission spectrum of a pulsed solar simulator is presented. Quantitative assessment of spectroradiometer calibration and spectra measurement uncertainties, together with their influence on the calculation of photovoltaic (PV) modules performance are also presented. A commercial fast spectroradiometer was used for solar simulator spectra measurements. The first part of the experimental work consisted in the instrument calibration by means of a FEL type standard lamp. The spectroradiometer was then used for emission spectrum measurements of a class A simulator (according to IEC 60904 - 9, Ed 2. 0 (2007) standard) by Spectrolab, with 1. 5 ms flash duration. A sensitivity analysis was performed, varying spectroradiometer delay time (since flash start), integration time and angular tilt. The behaviour of fast spectroradiometer was also investigated, in particular focusing at NIR wavelength region (800 1100 nm). Finally, the measured spectral irradiance distribution of the flasher was used for spectral mismatch correction factor calculations, according to IEC 60904 - 7, Ed 3. 0 (2008). The I-V curves used for these calculations were derived from indoor measurements on polycrystalline silicon and thin film CIGS photovoltaic modules at STC conditions (1000 W/m 2, AM 1. 5 and 25 °C). Calibration tests showed how much spectroradiometers can be influenced by a non optimal orientation toward the lamp source: a dedicated mechanical set-up for the device is therefore needed, for a reproducible angular tilt. Spectra measurements on the pulsed solar simulator show a good reproducibility. Furthermore, data analysis on polycrystalline silicon module IV curves at STC suggests that emission spectrum of <b>pulsed</b> <b>simulator</b> can significantly influence the calculation of module electrical parameters.

Bubble {{formation in}} the vicinity of MHVs has been described previously; the present in-vitro study was undertaken to quantitate bubbles leaving the heart and entering the systemic circulation, and to gain a closer perspective of this phenomenon and its potential clinical implications. Methods: Experiments were performed in a left heart <b>pulsed</b> flow <b>simulator</b> with 29 mm mitral and 23 mm aortic St. Jude Medical MHVs; mitral and aortic bioprosthetic valves were used as controls. De-aerated water was pumped through the left heart <b>pulsed</b> flow <b>simulator</b> at a fixed rate of 70 beats/min and at different cardiac outputs. Bubble numbers and sizes were monitored photographically at the simulator exit. Results: Numbers of bubbles per frame generated in MHVs in the mitral position ranged from 8 to 14 at cardiac outputs of 3 to 6. 5 l/min; this corresponded to gas volumetric flow rates of 330 to 830 mm^ 3 /min. The number of bubbles per frame for the aortic MHV was 3 to 7, reflecting the less severe flow conditions and milder valve closure impact. The diameter of bubbles generated by the mitral valve was almost uniform (0. 45 mm), while bubble diameters in the aortic valve ranged from 0. 36 to 0. 69 mm.

A correct calibration of these devices is in some cases very difficult, because indoor and outdoor performance measurements often lead to different results. In this paper we compare the indoor and outdoor performance measurements of a set of recent commercially available PV modules, (conventional and high-efficiency c-Si, single, double and triple junction thin film technologies) and we observe that the maximum power Pmax of some devices measured indoors using our large area <b>pulsed</b> solar <b>simulator</b> is usually lower than the power measured outdoors under natural sunlight.

Luminescent emission from the device was investigated under a range of voltage biases and was clearly observed at the maximum power point voltage of the sample under test indicating its presence during typical operating conditions of the solar cells. Investigation of the emission was also performed at relatively high temperatures (up to 60 C) in order to mimic the outdoor operating conditions of a solar cell device. Luminescence was detected at high temperatures indicating that significant radiative recombination is present at even higher temperatures. Outdoor measurements under actual solar spectrum demonstrated the presence of luminescent emission in agreement with indoor testing.
