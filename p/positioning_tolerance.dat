40|$|An {{apparatus}} {{which allows}} one to maintain precision placement of a manipulator which undergoes repeated controlled motions or trajectories is provided. The structure of the apparatus is compliant such that the manipulator may be displaced by forces applied to the mechanical structure. This compliance {{is due to a}} lack of precision in the fabrication of the component parts of the machine, and to a lack of rigidity due to a lightweight design. This displacement is of a greater magnitude than the precision <b>positioning</b> <b>tolerance</b> of the apparatus. Consequently, the manipulator may then be displaced outside of the <b>positioning</b> <b>tolerance</b> due to applied forces. However, it is a characteristic of the present invention, that despite the compliance of the mechanical structure of the apparatus, the <b>positioning</b> <b>tolerance</b> will be maintained. The controlled motion is accomplished by the generation of control signals by computer software running on a computer control system. The control software enables the system to run at much greater speeds while not exciting unwanted movement or vibration in the compliant mechanical structure. Georgia Tech Research Corporatio...|$|E

40|$|Appropriate {{and cost}} {{effective}} assignment {{and interpretation of}} dimensional and geometrical tolerances, in conjunction with tolerancing principles such as the maximum material condition (MMC), constitute a major area of concern for manufacturing SMEs. This is particularly true for the process planning stage, where production operations and parameter values establish the final product quality and cost. A frequently used geometrical <b>tolerance</b> is the <b>position</b> <b>tolerance.</b> It allows at least 57 % more space for feature allocation without affecting product quality and is very useful for accurate specification of multiple-hole assemblies. Feature allocation becomes further relaxed in case a <b>position</b> <b>tolerance</b> is assigned to the MMC. This assignment is mainly exploited during inspection, because it permits fewer rejections. In terms of cost, it is advantageous to systematically integrate the MMC tolerance bonus into the <b>position</b> <b>tolerance</b> at the process planning stage. A methodology that allows a new MMC-adapted <b>position</b> <b>tolerance</b> to be calculated is presented in this paper.

30|$|The <b>positioning</b> <b>tolerance</b> of the {{micromanipulation}} {{varies with}} the size of the objects under manipulation and the type of manipulation. For example, stable caging requires the microrobots to be placed at a distance smaller than the payload size from each other [41, 42]. The caging of the 300 -μm-diameter star-shaped micro-object using 130 -μm-diameter microrobots required the microrobots to be placed less than 300  μm from each other for stable trapping and at least 130  µm (one body length) apart to avoid merging of the bubble microrobots. Thus, the calculated microrobot separation of 280  μm with ±  10  μm position tolerance satisfies these conditions. The hybrid closed-loop control system was able to reduce the average position error from 21.9 to 11  μm, satisfying the position tolerance for this micromanipulation task.|$|E

40|$|A {{frequently}} used geometrical <b>tolerance</b> is the <b>position</b> <b>tolerance.</b> When it is assigned at the maximum material condition (MMC), {{an increase in}} the <b>position</b> <b>tolerance</b> is allowed, equal to the departure of the particular feature from the maximum material condition size. Neither concept - <b>position</b> <b>tolerance</b> and maximum material condition - analytically related with the exact coordinate dimensions that locate the feature. A feature position is usually allocated {{on the basis of its}} theoretically exact co-ordinate dimensions, whereas positional accuracy is pursued through an appropriate planning of the machining process in conjunction with appropriate machine tool(s) and/or jig(s). Exploitation of the MMC tolerance bonus is taken into account mainly during part inspection in order to reduce rejects. Such an approach is not systematic, considering that the MMC benefits are not taken directly into account in the process planning stage in order to control the overall process cost. In this paper, the permitted manufacturing errors of a feature size and position are considered and studied simultaneously in an analytical way. It is shown that a lower process capability (PC) requirement can then be established that leads to a significant process cost reduction.

40|$|A gated {{spectrometer}} {{has been}} designed for real-time, pulsed infrared (IR) studies at the National Synchrotron Light ource at the Brookhaven National Laboratory. A pair of 90 -degree, off-axis parabolic mirrors are used to relay the light from an entrance slit to an output IR recording camera. With an initial wavelength range of 1500 – 4500 nm required, gratings {{could not be used}} in the spectrometer because grating orders would overlap. A magnesium oxide prism, placed between these parabolic mirrors, serves as the dispersion element. The spectrometer is doubly telecentric. With proper choice of the air spacing between the prism and the second parabolic mirror, any spectral region of interest within the InSb camera array’s sensitivity region can be recorded. The wavelengths leaving the second parabolic mirror are collimated, thereby relaxing the camera <b>positioning</b> <b>tolerance.</b> To set up the instrument, two different wavelength (visible) lasers are introduced at the entrance slit and made collinear with the optical axis via flip mirrors. After dispersion by the prism, these two laser beams are directed to tick marks located on the outside housing of the gated IR camera. This provides first-order wavelength calibration for the instrument. Light that is reflected off the front prism face is coupled into a high-speed detector to verify steady radiance during the gated spectral imaging. Alignment features include tick marks on the prism and parabolic mirrors.

Current thesis {{is an attempt to}} provide a FE model which can be utilized for the analysis of the pedestrian kinematics. The author has focused on the bonnet modeling in LS-DYNA; furthermore, the modeling task was developed to provide the model of other influencing components in vehicle’s front end namely: fenders, engine cover, battery cover and frame. Through the use of GeoMagic studio, CATIA, HyperMesh, LS-Prepost and LS-DYNA, the FE models of all previously cited parts are prepared respectively. To investigate the response of the model to head and torso impacts, Euro-NCAP Head-form impacts tests were simulated and the responses evaluated. Also a FE model of a rigid torso impactor is modeled in LS-DYNA based on a mechanical torso impactor designed at Autoliv and the simulation results were compared and evaluated with the impact tests performed at Autoliv. A first investigation deals with the response of the bonnet when exposed to different loads at different positions on the bonnet. It was found that the kinematics was influenced mainly by the stiffness of the collision point and particularly if the rigid parts were engaged in the impact {{and the size of the}} gap between the hood and the rigid components.

This injector has a capability of injecting hydrogen beam with power of 0. 5 MW at 30 keV. For upgrade of SST- 1, power of 1. 7 MW at 55 KeV is required. Further, beam power is {{to be provided for}} a pulse length of 1000 S. We have designed a neutral beam injector [3 - 5] satisfying requirements for both SST- 1 and its upgrade. Since intense power is to be transported to SST- 1 situated at a distance of several meters from the ion source, optical quality of the beam becomes a primary concern. This in turn, is determined by the uniformity of the ion source plasma and the extractor geometry. To obtain the desired optical quality of the beam, stringent tolerances are to be met during fabrication of ion extractor system. SST- 1 neutral beam injector is based on positive ion source. The extraction system consists of 3 grids, each having extraction area of (width) 230 mm × (height) 480 mm and 774 shaped apertures of 8 mm diameter. To obtain horizontal focal length of 5. 4 m and vertical of 7 m, each grid consists of two halves with 387 apertures. Two halves are inclined at an angle of 1. 07 o ± 0. 01 o.

Although concerns over inadequate vendor specifications were voiced as early as 2003, no national or international standards have yet been published that address this issue. To facilitate this investigation, a comprehensive design was undertaken of a three axis nanopositoning instrument. A state-of-the-art design was realised, based on an extensive review of the literature, while also incorporating particular novel features and procedures. Mechanically, the instrument designed in this work consists of a support frame that is kinematically mounted onto a base plate. A piezo driven monolithic flexure stage/force-frame and a metrology frame are both mounted isostatically onto this support frame. The movements of the stage are measured by a parallel metrology arrangement of three capacitance sensors that are calibrated in place by three Michelson interferometers. Use of commercially-available adjustable optical mounts provides adequate flexibility for set-up and experimentation. Specified set-up procedures, in combination with a specifically designed orientation jig ensure that all capacitance sensors and interferometers are properly aligned and that the measurement and movement axes coincide in accordance with the Abbe principle. A set of LabView programs, are used to control and monitor the stage position to calculate the coordinates of locations, to allow scanning over curved surfaces and tracking along curved paths, to calibrate the capacitance sensors, to compensate for positioning bias, arising from measured environmental disturbances and to correct for measurement non-linearity through fourth order error mapping. An iterative design process was employed, using an effective approach of parallel prototyping, calculation, Finite Element Analysis (FEA) and MathLab modelling. Propagation mechanisms of uncertainties associated with all identified error sources were studied, leading to the establishment of an uncertainty budget and an estimate of instrument <b>positioning</b> <b>tolerance.</b> An efficient and effective experimental regime was proposed, reflecting the numerous known factors and unknown interactions between factors that may be significant. This provided a means to validate the design, theory, and analysis and also to gain insight into the necessary experimental rigor.

Consequently, it was possible to suggest appropriate standardising guidelines for the specification of precision positioning instruments...|$|E

The effects of complex shape and <b>position</b> <b>tolerances</b> in interaction with lightweight sheet parts are very extensive and difficult in their interpretation.

40|$|Most {{neuroscience}} techniques target rodents as {{the primary}} animal model to study neural circuits. By contrast, primates are seemingly exclusively used to study higher-order perception and, in particular, vision. Recent studies demonstrated commonalities between the visual systems of rats and primates. Here we further test these commonalities and, specifically, examine how neural adaptation and <b>position</b> <b>tolerance</b> change along a putative ventral visual pathways in rats (Vermaercke et al., 2014). Based on the literature in primates, an increase for both was expected. To test this, we recorded multi-unit extracellular spiking activity in primary visual cortex (V 1) and a downstream area LI of head-restrained Long Evans rats. During recordings for each examined multi-unit site we identified two non-overlapping positions within its receptive field and then probed the activity of that site with 3 different stimuli evoking a strong, an intermediate and little response, respectively. We tested 15 stimulus conditions that were presentations of a single stimulus at either position (N = 6) and presentations of either two identical (N = 3) or two different (N = 6) stimuli in all combinations at the two identified positions. Stimulus conditions were delivered to the animals in sequences (N = 10), with each sequence including all possible pairwise transitions between the tested conditions (N = 226 presentations). Each stimulus condition was presented for 300 ms and separated from each other by a 300 ms long blank inter-stimulus interval. We collected 58 (N = 4 rats) and 52 (N = 3) multi-unit sites in the areas V 1 and LI, respectively. We analyzed the data separately for the early (25 - 175 ms relative to stimulus onset) and late (175 - 325 ms) phases of the neural response. Neural adaptation was present {{in each of the}} 2 areas. We observed no difference in the degree of adaptation across the 15 conditions in either brain area and response phase. Yet, the area LI showed a significantly (p < 0. 05) higher degree of adaptation than V 1 (67 % vs. 33 %) for both response phases. The latter held true irrespective of the response strength to the adapter stimulus (p < 0. 05). We found significant <b>position</b> <b>tolerance</b> (preservation of stimulus selectivity across the two positions, p < 0. 05) only for the early phase of the neural response in the area LI but not for either response phase in V 1. Importantly, we failed to reveal <b>position</b> <b>tolerance</b> in V 1 despite increasing the sensitivity of our tests. To conclude, our results (increase in neural adaptation and <b>position</b> <b>tolerance)</b> parallel those of primates.

However, for even the apparently simplest IT tolerance (“invariance”), <b>tolerance</b> to object <b>position</b> on the retina, {{little is known about}} how this feat is achieved. One possibility is that IT <b>position</b> <b>tolerance</b> is innate in that discriminatory power for newly learned objects automatically generalizes across position.

After training, we recorded the spiking activity of an unbiased population of IT neurons and found that it contained significantly greater selectivity among the newly learned objects at the experienced position compared with a carefully matched, non-experienced position. Interleaved testing with other objects shows that this difference cannot be attributed to a bias in spatial attention or neuronal sampling.
