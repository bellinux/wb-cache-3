5|$|A further type of {{committee}} is normally {{set up to}} scrutinise <b>private</b> <b>bills</b> submitted to the Scottish Parliament by an outside party or promoter {{who is not a}} member of the Scottish Parliament or Scottish Government. <b>Private</b> <b>bills</b> normally relate to large-scale development projects such as infrastructure projects that require the use of land or property. Private Bill Committees have been set up to consider legislation on issues such as the development of the Edinburgh Tram Network, the Glasgow Airport Rail Link, the Airdrie-Bathgate Rail Link and extensions to the National Gallery of Scotland.|$|E
5|$|Unsuccessful <b>private</b> <b>bills</b> were {{presented}} to Parliament in 1884, 1888, 1890 and 1891 seeking permission to construct a new railway between the London and South Western Railway's (L's) line through Wimbledon station {{to the north and}} the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway's (LB's) Sutton station in the south.|$|E
5|$|Not {{a regular}} speaker in the House, Watts Morgan busied himself with work on various committees, dealing mainly with gas, electricity, river pollution, the Home Office and the Police Council. Despite {{his work on}} <b>private</b> <b>bills</b> and his {{friendly}} relationship with Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald he was never considered for office. In the 1922 election, Watts Morgan was forced to contest his seat {{for the first time}} when he was challenged by Frederick William Heale. Watts Morgan {{made it clear that he}} would defend the interests of ex-servicemen and those injured in industry; he opposed the temperance demand for the local veto. It was a close result for a Rhondda election; Heale lost by just over 3,000votes. The 1923 election was a different affair, with Watts Morgan defeating Conservative candidate Alfred John Orchard by nearly 13,000votes.|$|E

5|$|Dosanjh ran as the British Columbia New Democratic Party {{candidate}} in the Vancouver South riding in the 1979 and 1983 provincial elections. He lost both times to the BC Social Credit Party candidates. He ran in the 1991 provincial election in the Vancouver-Kensington riding where he won as his party came to power. He would be re-elected in that same riding in the 1996 provincial election. He spent his first few years as a Member of the Legislative Assembly as a backbencher. In 1993, he chaired the Select Standing Committee on Parliamentary Reform, Ethical Conduct, Standing Orders and <b>Private</b> <b>Bills.</b> He served two years as caucus chair for his party until April 10, 1995, when Premier Mike Harcourt dismissed Robin Blencoe from his cabinet and replaced him with Dosanjh as Minister of Government Services and Minister Responsible for Sports. A month later, in a small cabinet shuffle upon the resignation of Moe Sihota, Harcourt added Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism and Human Rights to Dosanjh's portfolio. In another cabinet shuffle, as Sihota was re-instated into the cabinet in August, Dosanjh's portfolio was changed to Minister Responsible for Multiculturalism, Human Rights and Immigration and he was appointed Attorney General.|$|E
5|$|Once {{the draft}} order had been issued, {{the locus of}} the process moved from the Potteries to London with the Local Government Provisional Order (No. 3) Bill {{introduced}} in the House of Commons in July 1908 by the Select Committee on <b>Private</b> <b>bills</b> chaired by Sir George White. The bill received its third reading on 31 July 1908 but had undergone significant amendment during its passage through the House of Commons, most notably in {{the introduction of a}} complex, differential rating system for a period of 10 years. Few of the interested parties were pleased with the proposal and, although the differential system was welcomed, a period of 20 years was preferred with the complicated valuation required of all public assets proving unpopular. As a result, Tunstall withdrew its support for the order leaving only Hanley and Longton to promote the bill in the House of Lords. Neither council was particularly in favour of the financial settlement but felt honour bound to promote the bill, having been the initial instigators of the scheme. Petitions objecting to the bill were submitted to the House of Lords by Staffordshire County Council, Burslem, Fenton, Stoke, and Tunstall councils, the Longton Justices, the North Staffordshire Railway Company, and individual Tunstall ratepayers.|$|E
25|$|The Act {{abolished}} {{any power}} of the House of Lords to veto any public Bill introduced in the House of Commons other than a Bill containing any provision to extend the maximum duration of Parliament beyond five years or a Bill for confirming a Provisional Order.

The bill was promoted by London Underground and British Rail, {{and supported by the}} government; it was rejected by the <b>Private</b> <b>Bill</b> Committee in 1994 on the grounds that a case had not been made, though the government issued [...] "Safeguarding Directions", protecting the route from any development that would jeopardise future schemes.|$|R

Motions (excepting those which pass bills) have no effect in law. A complete list of bills of the 39th Parliament is on the Parliament's website, divided into bills from the [...] and [...] sessions. On the site, the bills are divided into government bills, private member's bills, and <b>private</b> <b>bills</b> for both the House and the Senate.|$|E
500|$|The Clerk of the Parliaments, an {{official}} of the House of Lords, traditionally states a formula in Anglo-Norman Law French, indicating the sovereign's decision. The granting of royal assent to a supply bill is indicated with the words [...] "La Reyne remercie ses bons sujets, accepte leur benevolence, et ainsi le veult", translated as [...] "The Queen thanks her good subjects, accepts their bounty, and wills it so." [...] For other public or <b>private</b> <b>bills,</b> the formula is simply [...] "La Reyne le veult" [...] ("the Queen wills it"). For personal bills, the phrase is [...] "Soit fait comme il est désiré" [...] ("let it be as it is desired"). The appropriate formula for withholding assent is the euphemistic [...] "La Reyne s'avisera" [...] ("the Queen will consider it"). When the sovereign is male, Le Roy is substituted for La Reyne.|$|E
500|$|In 1845 the Great North of Scotland Railway {{was formed}} to build a railway from Aberdeen to Inverness. The {{proposed}} [...] route, which needed few major engineering works, followed the River Don to Inverurie, via Huntly and Keith to a crossing of the River Spey, and then to Elgin and along the coast via Nairn to Inverness. Branch lines to Banff, Portsoy, Garmouth and Burghead would total [...] At {{the same time the}} Perth & Inverness Railway proposed a direct route over the Grampian Mountains to Perth, and the Aberdeen, Banff & Elgin Railway suggested a route that followed the coast to better serve the Banffshire and Morayshire fishing ports. Three <b>private</b> <b>bills</b> were presented to Parliament seeking permission to build a railway, but the Aberdeen, Banff & Elgin failed to raise funds, and the Perth & Inverness Railway was rejected because the railway would be at altitudes that approached [...] and needed steep gradients. The Great North of Scotland Railway Act received Royal Assent on 26 June 1846.|$|E

5000|$|A <b>private</b> <b>bill</b> is a {{proposal}} for a law that would apply to a particular individual or group of individuals, or corporate entity. This is unlike public bills which apply to everyone within their jurisdiction. Private law can afford relief from another law, grant a unique benefit or powers not available under the general law, or relieve someone from legal responsibility for some allegedly wrongful act. There are many examples of such private law in democratic countries, although its use has changed over time. A <b>private</b> <b>bill</b> is {{not to be confused with}} a <b>private</b> member's <b>bill,</b> which is a bill introduced by a [...] "private member" [...] of the legislature rather than by the ministry.|$|R
2500|$|Paper {{receipts}} {{of deposit}} {{first appeared in}} the 10th century, but the first officially sponsored bills were introduced in Sichuan Province, where the currency was metallic and extremely heavy. Although businesses began to issue <b>private</b> <b>bills</b> of exchange, by the mid-11th century the central government introduced its paper money, produced using woodblock printing and backed by bronze coins. The Song government had also been amassing large amounts of paper tribute. Each year before 1101, the prefecture of Xinan (modern Xi-xian, Anhui) alone sent 1,500,000 sheets of paper in seven different varieties to the capital at Kaifeng. In the Southern Song, standard currency bearing a marked face value, was used. However, a lack of standards caused [...] face values to wildly fluctuate. A nationwide standard paper currency was not produced until 1274, two years before the Southern Song's fall.|$|E
2500|$|Second, Democrats {{have always}} {{elevated}} their minority floor leader to the speakership upon reclaiming majority status. Republicans {{have not always}} followed this leadership succession pattern. In 1919, for instance, Republicans bypassed James R. Mann, R-IL, who had been minority leader for eight years, and elected Frederick Gillett, R-MA, to be Speaker. Mann [...] "had angered many Republicans by objecting to their <b>private</b> <b>bills</b> on the floor;" [...] also he was a protégé of autocratic Speaker Joseph Cannon, R-IL (1903–1911), and many Members [...] "suspected that {{he would try to}} re-centralize power in his hands if elected Speaker." [...] More recently, although Robert H. Michel was the Minority Leader in 1994 when the Republicans regained control of the House in the 1994 midterm elections, he had already announced his retirement and had little or no involvement in the campaign, including the Contract with America which was unveiled six weeks before voting day.|$|E
6000|$|In our own English compositions, (at {{least for}} the last three years of our school education,) he showed no mercy to phrase, metaphor, or image, {{unsupported}} by a sound sense, or where the same sense might have been conveyed with equal force and dignity in plainer words [3]. Lute, harp, and lyre, Muse, Muses, and inspirations, Pegasus, Parnassus, and Hippocrene were all an abomination to him. In fancy I can almost hear him now, exclaiming [...] "Harp? Harp? Lyre? Pen and ink, boy, you mean! Muse, boy, Muse? Your nurse's daughter, you mean! Pierian spring? Oh aye! the cloister-pump, I suppose!" [...] Nay certain introductions, similes, and examples, were placed by name on a list of interdiction. Among the similes, there was, I remember, that of the manchineel fruit, as suiting equally well with too many subjects; in which however it yielded the palm at once to the example of Alexander and Clytus, which was equally good and apt, whatever might be the theme. Was it ambition? Alexander and Clytus!-Flattery? Alexander and Clytus!--anger--drunkenness--pride--friendship--ingratitude--late repentance? Still, still Alexander and Clytus! At length, the praises of agriculture having been exemplified in the sagacious observation that, had Alexander been holding the plough, he would not have run his friend Clytus through with a spear, this tried, and serviceable old friend was banished by public edict in saecula saeculorum. I have sometimes ventured to think, that a list of this kind, or an index expurgatorius of certain well-known and ever-returning phrases, both introductory, and transitional, including a large assortment of modest egoisms, and flattering illeisms, and the like, might be hung up in our Law-courts, and both Houses of Parliament, with great advantage to the public, as an important saving of national time, an incalculable relief to his Majesty's ministers, but above all, as insuring the thanks of country attornies, and their clients, who have <b>private</b> <b>bills</b> to carry through the House.|$|E
