5000|$|The {{most common}} staples are used with paper. They are almost {{exclusively}} applied with a mechanical stapler which clinches the legs after {{they pass through}} the paper. Staples of this type are used with a desktop <b>stapling</b> <b>machine.</b>|$|R
50|$|The home <b>stapling</b> <b>machine</b> was {{developed}} by Henry Heyl in 1877 and registered under US Patent No. 195,603. Heyl's companies, American Paper-Box Machine Company, Novelty Paper Box Company, and Standard Box Company, all of Philadelphia, manufactured machinery using staples in paper packaging and for saddle stitching.|$|R

40|$|Categorical random {{variables}} {{are a common}} <b>staple</b> in <b>machine</b> learning methods and other applications across disciplines. Many times, correlation within categorical predictors exists, and has been noted {{to have an effect}} on various algorithm effectiveness, such as feature ranking and random forests. We present a mathematical construction of a sequence of identically distributed but dependent categorical {{random variables}}, and give a generalized multinomial distribution to model the probability of counts of such variables...|$|R
2500|$|The TR-808 and TR-909 drum {{machines}} {{have since}} achieved legendary status, {{a fact that}} is now reflected in the prices sought for used devices. During the 1980s, the 808 became the <b>staple</b> beat <b>machine</b> in Hip hop production while the 909 found its home in House music and techno. It was [...] "the pioneers of Detroit techno [...] were making the 909 the rhythmic basis of their sound, and {{setting the stage for}} the rise of Roland's vintage Rhythm Composer." [...] In November 1995 the UK music technology magazine Sound on Sound noted: ...|$|R
50|$|A lack of raw {{material}} forced the rayon industry to take new steps. Staple fiber as replacement for cotton {{was the new}} product, waste threads of man-made continuously spinnable filaments cut to staple length. In 1916, the first <b>staple</b> filament spinning <b>machine</b> was put into operation. It was developed by Emil Bronnert, a chemist and Eduard Boos, an engineer.|$|R
40|$|Over the years, {{ensemble}} {{methods have}} become a <b>staple</b> of <b>machine</b> learning. Similarly, generalized linear models (GLMs) have become very popular {{for a wide variety}} of statistical inference tasks. The former have been shown to enhance out- of-sample predictive power and the latter possess easy interpretability. Recently, ensembles of GLMs have been proposed as a possibility. On the downside, this approach loses the interpretability that GLMs possess. We show that minimum description length (MDL) -motivated compression of the inferred ensembles can be used to recover interpretability without much, if any, downside to performance and illustrate on a number of standard classification data sets.

2500|$|Cotton {{is grown}} {{anywhere}} with long, hot dry summers {{with plenty of}} sunshine and low humidity. Indian cotton, gossypium arboreum, is finer but the staple is only suitable for hand processing. American cotton, gossypium hirsutum, produces the longer <b>staple</b> needed for <b>machine</b> production. Planting is from September to mid November and the crop is harvested between March and June. The cotton bolls are harvested by stripper harvesters and spindle pickers, that remove the entire boll from the plant. The cotton boll is the seed pod of the cotton plant, attached {{to each of the}} thousands of seeds are fibres about 2.5cm long.|$|R
5000|$|Norton was an {{employee}} of Brown & Sharpe who quit the company {{with the desire to}} further pursue his belief that the cylindrical grinder is not merely a finishing tool but could be a <b>staple</b> of the <b>machine</b> shop. He founded the Norton Grinding Company, where he continued improving the cylindrical grinder to use faster rpm values and more precise grinding tolerances. He was acknowledged for his work on April 18, 1925 when he won The John Scott Medal and Premium for his invention of [...] "accurate grinding devices of high power". These standards developed by Norton were the status quo until about the middle of the 20th century.|$|R
40|$|Abstract—We propose an {{approach}} to analyzing functional neu-roimages in which 1) regions of neuronal activation are described by a superposition of spatial kernel functions, the parameters of which are estimated from the data and 2) the presence of acti-vation is detected {{by means of a}} generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT). Kernel methods have become a <b>staple</b> of modern <b>machine</b> learning. Herein, we show that these techniques show promise for neuroimage analysis. In an on-off design, we model the spatial ac-tivation pattern as a sum of an unknown number of kernel func-tions of unknown location, amplitude, and/or size. We employ two Bayesian methods of estimating the kernel functions. The first is a maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimation method based on a Re-versible-Jump Markov-chain Monte-Carlo (RJMCMC) algorithm that searches for both the appropriate model complexity and pa-rameter values. The second is a relevance vector machine (RVM) ...|$|R
