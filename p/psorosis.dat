50|$|The Citrus <b>psorosis</b> virus Egyptian strain (CPsV-EG) was {{isolated}} from naturally infected citrus grapefruit (Citrus paradisi Macf.) at ARC. The grapefruit used for CPsV-EG isolatation {{was found to}} be free from CTV, CEVd and Spiroplasma citri by testing with DTBIA, tissue print hybridization and Dienes stain respectively (Ghazal et al., 2008).|$|E
50|$|Three Egyptian {{isolates}} of Citrus <b>psorosis</b> virus (CPsV-EG)—ARC, TB and TN—were {{obtained from}} three citrus cultivars—Grapefruit, Balady and Navel—respectively. These isolates were differed {{in some of}} their external symptoms. The CPsV-EG isolates were detected by biological indexing, giving rise to Oak Leaf Pattern (OLP) on Dweet tangor. The three isolates were differentiated using Double Antibody Sandwich-Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (DAS-ELISA), woody indicator plants, differential hosts, peroxidase isozymes and activity, total RNA content and Reserves Transcription-Polymerase Chain Reaction (RT-PCR). The severe isolate (ARC) gave the highest OD value (2.204) in ELISA, followed by the mild isolate (TB) (1.958) and the last latent isolate (TN) (1.669). These isolates differed also in incubation period, intensity of symptoms and response to sensitivity of woody indicator plants and differential hosts. The CPsV-EG isolates showed differences in isozymes fractions, RF value and intensity as compared with healthy plant. Results were confirmed by peroxidase activity where the level of peroxidase activity was considerably higher in ARC leaves than TB and the last TN. The total RNA content in infected leaves gave the highest content in ARC followed by TB isolate while the lowest was recorded in TN isolate. Finally, RT-PCR showed differences between CPsV-EG isolates of PCR products using specific primer (Ps66 and Ps65) where base number of coat protein gene ARC isolate 571 bp; TB isolate 529 bp and TN isolate 546 bp (El-Dougdoug et al., 2009).|$|E
40|$|Abstract First {{reported}} in 1896, <b>psorosis</b> {{was the first}} citrus disease proven to be graft transmissible and also the first for which eradication and budwood certification programs were launched to prevent its economic damage. For many years <b>psorosis</b> etiology remained elusive and only in 1986 it {{was associated with the}} presence of virus-like particles in infected plants. However, {{in the last two decades}} a virus with unusual morphology (Citrus <b>psorosis</b> virus, CPsV) was characterized and closely associated with <b>psorosis</b> disease as previously defined by field symptoms and by biological indexing in sensitive indicator plants. With a tripartite, negative-sense, RNA genome and a ~ 48 kDa coat protein, CPsV, the presumed causal agent of <b>psorosis,</b> is the type member of the genus Ophiovirus, within the new family Ophioviridae. Availability of the complete genomic sequence of two CPsV isolates and partial sequences of many others has enabled i) setting up rapid and sensitive RNA-based detection methods, ii) testing different citrus and relatives for resistance to CPsV, iii) identification of the two components (<b>psorosis</b> A and <b>psorosis</b> B) traditionally associated with non-scaled and scaled bark inoculum, respectively, from psorosis-infected plants and study their interactions, iv) analysis of genetic variation and evolutionary forces shaping the CPsV populations, v) preliminary studies on the interactions between virus and host factors and vi) development of transgenic citrus plants expressing variable degrees of resistance to CPsV. In summary, 120 years after the first report on <b>psorosis</b> we start seeing a pale light at the end of the tunnel...|$|E
40|$|<b>Psorosis</b> is a citrus {{disease of}} undemonstrated {{etiology}} {{that can be}} diagnosed by biological indexing on sweet orange seedlings followed by a cross protection test. Its presumed causal agent is Citrus <b>psorosis</b> virus (CPsV), type species of the genus Ophiovirus. We compared detection of CPsV by ELISA, RT-PCR, molecular hybridization and immunosorbent electron microscopy, and examined its association with <b>psorosis</b> disease in 11 biologically characterized isolates and in 47 uncharacterized field sources by observation of field symptoms and by biological indexing including the cross protection test. Detection of CPsV {{by any of the}} four procedures always coincided with diagnosis of <b>psorosis</b> by cross protection, but it did not always correlate with observation of symptoms thought to be specific, in field trees or in graft-inoculated indicator plants. Trials to detect CPsV by ELISA, molecular hybridization and RT-PCR in citrus sources from different geographical origins, presumed to be psorosis-infected on the basis of field symptoms or reaction of indicator plants, were sometimes unsuccessful, indicating that <b>psorosis</b> symptoms may be induced by causes other than CPsV...|$|E
40|$|This {{study was}} carried out during 2005 – 2006 in citrus {{orchards}} in Edremit Gulf Region (Edremit, Havran and Burhaniye subprovince) to determine prevalence of virus and viroid diseases including Exocortis, Citrus tristeza virus, Satsuma dwarf and <b>Psorosis</b> on Satsuma Owari mandarins. During 2005 - 2006 in citrus production areas in Edremit Gulf region were surveyed and samples were collected from symptomatic trees. Samples were tested by biological indexing for Exocortis and Satsuma dwarf, DAS-ELISA for <b>Psorosis</b> and DAS-ELISA and biological indexing for Citrus tristeza virus. DAS-ELISA test reveal that while 38 of 156 samples were infected with Citrus tristeza virus, none of the 10 samples tested was positive for <b>Psorosis.</b> Biological indexing showed that 1 of 20 samples tested was infected with Exocortis viroid, however no symptoms were observed from the Satsuma dwarf samples. On the other hand, indexed Citrus tristeza virus isolates induced vein clearing and stem pitting symptoms on Mexican lime plants...|$|E

40|$|Citrus <b>psorosis</b> virus (CPsV) is the {{putative}} agent of <b>psorosis,</b> a widespread and economically important dis-ease of citrus. This virus is erratically transmitted to herbaceous hosts {{in which it}} multiplies to low titer. It can be purified only with difficulty, which makes the production of antisera laborious. To overcome this im-pairment, the coat protein gene of an Italian virus iso-late was cloned and sequenced. This sequence, which showed 97 % identity at the amino acid level with a Florida isolate of CPsV, was expressed in Escherichia coli BL 21 as a fusion protein with maltose binding pro-tein. This recombinant protein {{was used as an}} antigen for immunization. The resulting antiserum successfully and specifically recognized CPsV in Western blots, im-munoelectron microscopy and different ELISA proto-cols, using diverse tissues from citrus accessions from different geographical areas...|$|E
40|$|Citrus <b>psorosis</b> (CPsV) and Mirafiori lettuce big-vein virus (MiLBVV) {{belong to}} the family Ophioviridae, plant viruses with {{filamentous}} nucleocapsids and segmented genomes of negative polarity, causing the worldwide distributed citrus <b>psorosis</b> and lettuce big-vein diseases, respectively. To gain insight into the replication cycle of these viruses, the subcellular localization of the viral coat proteins (CP) was studied. Immunoblot analysis of fractionated extracts derived from natural and experimental infected hosts indicated that the CP of CPsV occurs in the soluble cytoplasmic fraction. The cytoplasmic localization of this protein was confirmed by confocal microscopy of fluorescent protein (FP) -tagged CP following its expression in either CPsV-infected and healthy Citrus sinensis plants or in Nicotiana benthamiana plants. The same localization was observed for FP-tagged CP of MiLBVV. The CPs of CPsV and MiLBBV can undergo homologous and heterologous interactions as revealed by fluorescent lifetime imaging microscopy and co-immunoprecipitation analysis. A putative leucine zipper motif that is conserved among ophiovirus CP sequences may account for these interactions...|$|E

Although the results are from a low number of samples, they give a significant insight into the sanitary conditions of the Greek citrus industry, disclosing the presence of CTV mild strains in the North-western area. Key words: citrus, virus diseases, CTV, molecular hybridisation, sequencing. Citrus is an ancient crop in Greece, where it is grown in 29 of the 54 prefectures of the country. Sweet orange is the dominant species, followed by lemon, mandarin and grapefruit, all grafted primarily onto sour orange (Kyriakopoulou, 2002). With about 3. 5 millions trees, the Arta valley is the main citrus-growing area of Epirus. Most of the virus and virus-like diseases of citrus occur in Greece, e. g. <b>psorosis</b> A and B, concave gum, impietratura, cristacortis, crinkly leaf, ringspot, exocortis, cachexia, gummy bark and sour orange woody gall (Kyriakopoulou, 2002). Surveys for Citrus tristeza virus (CTV) were started in Greece in 1995 and large-scale testing was carried out by DAS-ELISA and direct tissue blot immunoassay (DTBIA). In June 2000, CTV was detected {{for the first time in}} Argolis (North East Peloponnese) and in Chania (Crete), due to the accidental introduction of CTV-infected budwood from Spain (Dimou et al., 2002). We now report the results of a survey for virus and virus-like diseases affecting citrus in some areas of Epirus...|$|E
40|$|Citrus <b>psorosis</b> virus (CPV) is a {{multicomponent}} ssRNA virus with a {{coat protein}} of approximately 48 kDa.

40|$|Citrus ringspot is a graft-transmissible disease, and {{at least}} two taxonomically {{distinct}} viral species are associated with this syndrome: Citrus <b>psorosis</b> virus (CPsV) and Indian citrus ringspot virus (ICRSV). Neither of these two viruses was detected, however, by serological or molecular assays in symptomatic tissues from citrus trees in southern Iran, where the ringspot syndrome is widespread. By contrast, electron microscopy and molecular assays revealed the presence of a rhabdovirus-like virus, which was graft transmitted to several citrus species and mechanically to herbaceous hosts. Virus particles were bacilliform and resembled rhabdovirus nucleocapsids deprived of the lipoprotein envelope. Partial sequences of the viral nucleoprotein and RNA polymerase genes showed a distant genetic relatedness with cytorhabdoviruses. This virus appears to be a novel species, for which the name Iranian citrus ringspot-associated virus (IrCRSaV) is suggested...|$|E

Êsse levantamento foi baseado em uma amostra correspondente a 10 % do total de 14 milhões de plantos citricas nas quatro principais regiões citrícolas do Estado. Em cada região um certo número de pomares foi escolhido de acôrdo com as variedades enxérto e porto-enxêrto e idade. Em cada pomar foram feitos observações quanto aos sintomas visíveis de sorose, exocorte e xiloporose em 100 plantas tomadas ao acaso. Com a porcentagem de plantas doentes de cada variedade de cada pomar, for calculada a porcentagem média ponderada para o total do número de plantas das amostras regionais, considerados para cada doença. Foram observadas porcentagens variáveis de plantas de laranja Pera com sintomas de exocorte e de sorose, indicando a existência de vários clones desta variedade. As plantas das variedades Baianinha e Hamlin, originárias cada uma delas de um único clone, foram encontradas pràticamente 100 % infectadas com exocorte. A doença sorose não foi encontrada em plantas de laranja Hamlin, mas praticamente em quase tôdas as da variedade Baianinha. Sintomas de xiloporose foram observados sòmente na variedade Barão. Foram {{realizadas}} observações sôbre a ocorrência de estirpes mais ou menos severas do vírus da tristeza, e sintomas dessa doença foram encontrados em plantas de laranja Pera, pomelo e limão Galego. A {{survey of}} the virus disease conditions of the citrus orchards, giving special attention to bud-transmitted virus diseases {{was carried out in}} the State of Soo Paulo, Brazil, in order to lay a basis for a Budwood Certification Program. The field survey was based on a sample corresponding to 10 % of the total population of 14 million citrus trees in the four main citrus areos of the State. In each area a certain number of orchards were selected according to scion and stock varieties and oge. tn each orchard counts were made for visible symptoms of <b>psorosis.,</b> exocortis and xyloporosis on 100 trees taken at random. From the percentage of disease affected trees of each variety, found in the orchards, the weighted mean percentage was calculated for the total number of trees of the local samples considered for each disease, in each citrus area. Whereas a variable percentage of trees of the Pera variety with both exocortis and <b>psorosis</b> was recorded pointing to different sources of budwood, the trees of Baianinha and Hamlin varieties were practically 100 per cent infected with exocortis, which is to be expected since they all have originated from the same budwood sources. <b>Psorosis</b> was not found on Hamlin trees, but proctically in all trees of the Baianinha variety. Symptoms of xyloporosis were observed on the Barão variety only. Observations on the occurrence of more or less severe strains of the tristeza virus were made, and symptoms of the disease were found on Pera orange, grape-fruit and West Indian lime...|$|E
40|$|Ophioviridae is {{a family}} of segmented, negative-sense, {{single-stranded}} RNA plant viruses. We showed that their cell-to-cell movement protein (MP) is an isolated member of the 30 K MP superfamily with a unique structural organization. All 30 K MPs share a core domain that contains a nearly-invariant signature aspartate. We examined {{its role in the}} MP of Citrus <b>psorosis</b> virus (CPsV) and Mirafiori lettuce big-vein virus (MiLBVV). Alanine substitution of this aspartate prevented plasmodesmata accumulation of MPMiLBVV, while MPCPsV was not affected. The capacity of ophiovirus MPs to increase the plasmodesmata size exclusion limit and non-cell autonomous protein feature was abolished in both mutants. To investigate the role of the signature aspartate in cell-to-cell movement, we constructed a new movement-deficient Tobacco mosaic virus vector used for trans-complementation assays. We showed that both ophiovirus MP mutants lack the cell-to-cell movement capacity, confirming that this signature aspartate is essential for viral cell-to-cell movement...|$|E
40|$|Citrus <b>psorosis</b> virus (CPsV), {{the type}} species of genus Ophiovirus, has a segmented, negative-stranded RNA genome. We {{examined}} the population structure and genetic variation of CPsV in three coding regions located in RNAs 1, 2 and 3, analysing 22 isolates from Argentina, California, Florida, Italy and Spain. Most isolates contained a predominant sequence and some minor variants. Estimations {{of the genetic}} diversity and phylogenetic clustering of isolates disclosed two populations, one comprising isolates from Spain, Italy, Florida and California and the other including the Argentinean isolates. Isolate CPV- 4 (from Texas) included for comparison was distant from both groups, suggesting that it belongs to a third group. The low ratio between non-synonymous and synonymous nucleotide substitutions indicated strong selection for amino acid sequence conservation, particularly in the coat protein gene. Incongruent phylogenetic relationships in different genomic regions suggested that exchange of genomic segments {{may have contributed to}} CPsV evolution...|$|E
40|$|Citrus <b>psorosis</b> virus (CPsV) and Mirafiori lettuce big-vein virus (MiLBVV), {{members of}} the Ophioviridae family, have {{segmented}} negative-sense single-stranded RNA genomes. To date no reports have described how ophioviruses spread within host plants and/or the proteins involved in this process. Here we show that the 54 K protein of CPsV is encoded by RNA 2 and describe its subcellular distribution. Upon transient expression in Nicotiana benthamiana epidermal cells the 54 K protein, and also its 54 K counterpart protein of MiLBVV, localize to plasmodesmata and enhance GFP cell-to-cell diffusion between cells. Both proteins, but not the coat proteins (CP) of the respective viruses, functionally trans-complement cell-to-cell movement-defective Potato virus X (PVX) and Tobacco mosaic virus (TMV) mutants. The 54 K and 54 K proteins interact with the virus-specific CP in the cytoplasm, suggesting a potential role of CP in ophiovirus movement.

40|$|Citrus <b>psorosis</b> {{virus and}} Mirafiori lettuce big-vein virus are {{two members of}} the genus Ophiovirus, family Ophioviridae. So far, how these viruses can {{interfere}} in the antiviral RNA silencing pathway is not known. In this study, using a local GFP silencing assay on Nicotiana benthamiana, the 24 K– 25 K and the movement protein (MP) of both viruses were identified as RNA silencing suppressor proteins. Upon their co-expression with GFP in N. benthamiana 16 c plants, the proteins also showed to suppress systemic RNA (GFP) silencing. The MP CPsV and 24 K CPsV proteins bind long (114 nucleotides) but not short-interfering (21 nt) dsRNA, and upon transgenic expression, plants showed developmental abnormalities that coincided with an altered miRNA accumulation pattern. Furthermore, both proteins were able to suppress miRNA-induced silencing of a GFP-sensor construct and the co-expression of MP CPsV and 24 K CPsV exhibited a stronger effect, suggesting they act at different stages of the RNAi pathway. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{complete}} {{nucleotide sequence}} of an ophiovirus associated with lettuce big-vein disease has been elucidated. The genome consisted of four RNA molecules of approximately 7 – 8, 1 – 7, 1 – 5 and 1 – 4 kb. Virus particles {{were shown to}} contain nearly equimolar amounts of RNA molecules of both polarities. The 5 «- and 3 «-terminal ends of the RNA molecules are largely, but not perfectly, complementary to each other. The virus genome contains seven open reading frames. Database searches with the putative viral products revealed homologies with the RNA-dependent RNA polymerases of rhabdoviruses and Ranunculus white mottle virus, and the capsid protein of Citrus <b>psorosis</b> virus. The gene encoding the viral polymerase appears to be located on the RNA seg-ment 1, while the nucleocapsid protein is encoded by the RNA 3. No significant sequence similarities were observed with other viral proteins.

Para viróides, empregou-se também RT-PCR. Todos os testes biológicos foram positivos para tristeza e negativos para xiloporose. Para exocorte, 82, 5 % dos testes foram positivos. No caso da sorose, 11, 2 % dos testes foram positivos apesar das plantas de campo não apresentarem sintomas. Quanto à tristeza, a reação em ‘Galego’ foi fraca (58, 8 %), média (40 %) e forte (1, 2 %), sem caneluras nos ramos das plantas no campo. Os viróides Hop stunt viroid (HSVd), Citrus dwarfing viroid (CVd-III) e o Citrus exocortis viroid (CEVd) foram encontrados em 31, 3 %, 82, 5 % e 100, 0 % das plantas, respectivamente. Todas as plantas estudadas estavam infectadas com o CTV e com o CEVd, que foi encontrado isoladamente ou em combinação com outros viróides. Diferenças observadas na expressão dos sintomas de exocorte e tristeza na copa e no porta-enxerto podem ser atribuídas a interferências entre os viróides e a seleção pela multiplicação de gemas de árvores contaminadas por variantes pouco virulentas. O estado nutricional, o desenvolvimento, a produção e a qualidade dos frutos não apresentaram associação com o tipo de contaminação por viróides, o que também ocorreu com as plantas selecionadas como candidatas a matrizes em função da produção e qualidade física dos frutos.

All of the plants in study were infected with the CTV and the CEVd, that was found isolately or in combinations with other viroids. Differences observed in the expression of the exocortis symptoms and tristeza disease in the cup and in the rootstock can be attributed to interferences between the viroids and the selection by the multiplication through cuttings of infected trees by strains few virulent.
