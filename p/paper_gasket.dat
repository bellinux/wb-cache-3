50|$|In {{order to}} {{evaluate}} the product thoroughly, {{it is necessary to}} deploy the folded product. Besides, it takes time to expand the A 4 format formed product. In addition, there is a psychological fear among customers to release the product as an indication of breaking the order, especially if there is a <b>paper</b> <b>gasket</b> in the folded product.|$|E
50|$|When {{installed}} in the BMW E30, a two-piece oil pan with a removable front sump was fitted to the M42. In this two-piece arrangement, the upper oil pan casting incorporates the oil pump's supply passage, and is sealed to the crankcase oil filter housing with a <b>paper</b> <b>gasket.</b> This can cause problems, because thermal cycles and engine vibration tend to loosen the six 10mm upper pan mounting bolts inside the motor.|$|E
50|$|An unusual {{feature of}} this boiler is that the field tubes are not rigidly {{attached}} to the boiler shell, but merely gasketed into place. The thickened ends of the tubes are formed to a taper and the tubeplate holes are reamed to match. A <b>paper</b> <b>gasket</b> is sufficient to seal the joint. Inspection or removal for replacement is thus simplified. As the boiler is always under greater pressure than the atmosphere, the tubes self-tighten under pressure and avoid leaking. Obviously the boiler must never be placed under vacuum, so a vacuum valve {{may need to be}} provided.|$|E
5000|$|An example {{would be}} a die that {{performs}} blanking of [...]030 in round <b>paper</b> <b>gaskets</b> without holes. This type of die would be created in one simple pass from a wire EDM after heat treating. The workpiece would then produce the punch and the die after the cut is complete. Additional work would then include adding a stripper plate to the punch plate after the punch has been mounted (on punch plate). At this point the pancake die is ready for production.|$|R
50|$|The 2005 {{gained a}} front axle {{enlarged}} to 26 mm and hubs increased in diameter from 36 to 52 mm front and from 48 to 64 mm rear. The seat height was 925 mm and the handlebars were supplied by Renthal. The hydraulic clutch was {{fitted with a}} flexible steel hose. A Trip Master digital speedometer was added. The transmission was given a new, wider, more load-resistant 2nd gear and smoother shifting overall. The motor was given a new crank shaft, reconfigured transfer ports and the <b>paper</b> head <b>gasket</b> was replaced with silicone.|$|R
50|$|The engine(s) get {{required}} cooling from liquid-to-liquid {{heat exchangers}} connected to fresh seawater or divertible to recirculate through tanks of seawater {{in the engine}} room. Both supplies draw heat from the engines via the coolant and oil lines. Heat exchangers are plumbed in so that oil is represented by a yellow mark on the flange of the pipes, and relies on <b>paper</b> type <b>gaskets</b> to seal the mating faces of the pipes. Sea water, or brine, is represented by a green mark on the flanges and internal coolant is represented by blue marks on the flanges.|$|R
50|$|This {{transmission}} has {{a separate}} oil for the differential in the transmission, {{so there are}} two fluid levels to check. The differential fluid is checked by unscrewing the speed sensor gear assembly {{and use it as}} a dipstick. The speed sensor gear assembly is located on top of the transmission just above the right inner CV joint. Differential is emptied by removing the final drive cover on the rear of the transmission or by vacuum extraction through the speed sensor hole. Vacuum extraction is the more attractive option since a <b>paper</b> <b>gasket</b> seals the steel cover and access is very difficult. Filling is through the speed sensor hole. Differential oil capacity is about 1 liter. An acceptable differential oil is Redline synthetic MT-90 75W90 gear oil or any synthetic 75W90 GL4 gear oil. Be very careful not to introduce sand or dust into the differential, as the differential has no way to filter its oil.|$|E
5000|$|The 11.5 AAM rear {{differential}} {{replaced the}} [...] "14 bolt" [...] {{in many of}} the General Motors [...] "heavy duty" [...] light trucks in 2001 models, however the [...] "14 bolt" [...] is still in production. Besides trucks, it is used in commercial van applications. AAM continues to manufacture this axle for GM, as well as Dodge Ram trucks. Dodge discontinued running Dana Holding Corporation axles after model year 2002 trucks. This is the main axle used in 3rd Generation Dodge Ram 2500 and 3500 trucks. The GM version uses a <b>paper</b> <b>gasket</b> and the Ram version uses a re-usable rubber gasket. This attribute also makes the Dodge and GM axles appear very different, because of the different cover used. The GM AAM axle tubes are a smaller diameter then the AAM dodge's. GM also opted to have a vibration dampener installed on the yoke, while dodge opted to place the dampener on the drive shaft. This became the standard axle on all 2500 and 3500 RAM trucks for model year 2014.|$|E
30|$|The factory “moulding” {{produces}} plastic lids and capping for packaging in {{the food}} and tobacco industry. Due to health and safety restrictions set by the purchaser, the polymers do not include any additives. The core process is injection moulding. Forty injection moulding machines are situated in the manufacturing area. They have different size and construction types (hydraulic and hybrid engines as well as single- and two-shot-moulding techniques). In contrast to the extrusion moulding, injection moulding is a discontinuous process with defined cycle times. The additional post-treatment includes the insertion of <b>paper</b> or aluminium <b>gaskets</b> and packaging. Some of the robots for the customisation treatments are permanently installed. Others are portable ensuring high flexibility for production [14].|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} <b>paper,</b> the <b>gasket</b> stress distributions, hub stress and a {{variation}} in axial bolt force in bolted gasketed pipe flange connections under internal pressure are analyzed using elasto-plastic FEM {{taking into account}} the nonlinearity of gasket behavior. Non-asbestos spiral wound gaskets were employed. The effect of nominal flange diameter is examined on the gasket contact stress distributions, the hub stress and the variation in axial bolt force (the load factor) is examined. Using the obtained gasket contact stress distribution and the fundamental data of the relationship between gasket compressive stress and gasket leak rate according to JIS B 2490, a method for predicting the leak rate is demonstrated. Experiments to measure the amount of leakage, the hub stress and the variation in axial bolt force when the joint is under internal pressure were carried out. The numerical results of the leak rate, hub stress and the load factor are in a fairly good agreement with the measured results. Then, a method is demonstrated for determining the bolt preload under given conditions, that is, taking into account assembly efficiency, leak rate and internal pressure In addition, bolt preload is determined using the actual gasket contact stress which can be estimated using the value of the load factor. As a design example, the procedure for determining the bolt preload in 3 ” and 20 “ nominal diameter pipe flange connections is shown for the allowable leak rate of 1. 0 - 3 Pa ･m 3 /s. The results are validated by the experiments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Microreactor {{design for}} ammonia {{synthesis}} with electromagnetic (EM) induction is reported. The Y-shape reactor with dimension of 50 mm by 120 mm has 5 mixing channels. This microreactor was designed using 2 D AUTOCAD software. It was fabricated using MAZAK milling machine that operates using a numerical control functionality computer which was interfaced with MASTERCAM software. Aluminum metal plate with 2 mm thickness {{was used as}} the microreactor. It was milled for 30 minutes with 0. 5 mm width of the channel. After the milling process was done two inlets and one outlet with pipe connectors were assembled. To reduce the leakage, a <b>gasket</b> <b>paper</b> was placed between the two plates. Hydrogen and nitrogen gas were mixed and flowed (1. 2 bar) into the inlet with 0. 05 g manganese based ferrite used as the nano-catalyst. The reaction was done in ambient condition. The microreactor was placed in a Helmholtz Coils to induced strong EM field. We used Kejldahl method to calculate the 24. 9 % ammonia yield...|$|R
50|$|A Flit gun {{consists}} of a pneumatic pump cylinder with a hand-operated piston to force air through an air nozzle in the front. Below {{the front of the}} pneumatic tube hangs a cylindrical container designed to act as a reservoir for liquid insecticide, this reservoir being set at 90 degrees to the pneumatic tube. In early versions, the reservoir is permanently secured to the pump and equipped with a removable, gasketed screw cap for filling. In later, improved versions, the insecticide reservoir is secured to the pump with a coarse screw fitting and a seal of cork composite or <b>gasket</b> <b>paper,</b> so that it can readily be unscrewed for filling. A siphon tube extends from the pump cylinder downward into the reservoir and {{the upper end of the}} siphon is positioned in front of a nozzle on the air pump. When a jet of high-velocity air exits the pump and streams across end of the siphon tube, it lowers the pressure in the siphon, drawing insecticide upward from the reservoir, which then atomizes the liquid as it is entrained in the air jet. With each vigorous forward stroke of the pump handle a burst of spray is produced, similar to that of a modern aerosol spray can.|$|R
