25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s it was {{discovered}} that illuminated organic dyes can generate electricity at oxide electrodes in electrochemical cells. In an effort to understand and simulate the primary processes in photosynthesis the phenomenon was studied at the University of California at Berkeley with chlorophyll extracted from spinach (bio-mimetic or bionic approach). On the basis of such experiments electric power generation via the dye sensitization solar cell (DSSC) principle was demonstrated and discussed in 1972. The instability of the dye solar cell was identified as a main challenge. Its efficiency could, during the following two decades, be improved by optimizing the porosity of the electrode prepared from fine oxide powder, but the instability remained a problem. A modern DSSC is composed of a <b>porous</b> <b>layer</b> of titanium dioxide nanoparticles, covered with a molecular dye that absorbs sunlight, like the chlorophyll in green leaves. The titanium dioxide is immersed under an electrolyte solution, above which is a platinum-based catalyst. As in a conventional alkaline battery, an anode (the titanium dioxide) and a cathode (the platinum) are placed on either side of a liquid conductor (the electrolyte).|$|E
25|$|The GDL {{electrically}} {{connects the}} catalyst and current collector. It must be porous, electrically conductive, and thin. The reactants {{must be able}} to reach the catalyst, but conductivity and porosity can act as opposing forces. Optimally, the GDL should be composed of about one third Nafion or 15% PTFE. The carbon particles used in the GDL can be larger than those employed in the catalyst because surface area is not the most important variable in this layer. GDL should be around 15-35µm thick to balance needed porosity with mechanical strength. Often, an intermediate <b>porous</b> <b>layer</b> is added between the GDL and catalyst layer to ease the transitions between the large pores in the GDL and small porosity in the catalyst layer. Since a primary function of the GDL is to help remove water, a product, flooding can occur when water effectively blocks the GDL. This limits the reactants ability to access the catalyst and significantly decreases performance. Teflon can be coated onto the GDL to limit the possibility of flooding. Several microscopic variables are analyzed in the GDLS such as: porosity, tortuosity and permeability. These variables have incidence over the behavior of the fuel cells. Two major GDL substrates, carbon cloth and paper, were compared, indicative of different cell performances.|$|E
40|$|In {{this work}} we {{consider}} the use of Brinkman’s equation in describing viscous fluid flow through porous media, and its applicability in describing flow through <b>layered</b> <b>porous</b> media when permeability is low. While available formulations of viscous fluid flow over <b>porous</b> <b>layers</b> impose conditions of velocity and shear stress continuity at the interface between layers, the case of flow through layered media with low permeability requires a formulation that captures the low shear stress across layers. To this end, we consider a formulation of Brinkman’s equation based on Williams’ constitutive equations {{in order to take}} into account Brinkman’s effective viscosity and how it influences the flow characteristics across the <b>porous</b> <b>layers,</b> and we derive theoretical relationships for fluid and flow quantities in composite <b>porous</b> <b>layers...</b>|$|R

It was further concluded that there was little promise of success in forming an effective energy absorbing layer on the surface of already densified silicon carbide ceramic that would have the mechanical strength of the untreated or unsurfaced material.

We are analyzing the case when permeability of <b>porous</b> <b>layers</b> on the border of section of a two-layer insert accepts one value. The lubricant moves in a circumferential direction through a bore in a bearing body and the subsequent filtration occurs through insert pores. Permeability anisotropy of <b>porous</b> <b>layers</b> is taken into consideration in radial and circumferential directions. As a result of the given task, we have obtained the field of speeds and pressure in <b>porous</b> <b>layers</b> and in the lubricant layer. Analytical dependences for components of a vector of supporting force and the friction moment have been found, and we have also defined the loading factor and friction factor. Moreover, in our calculations we have revealed and used the parameter characterizing specificity of lubrication feeding in a circumferential direction. It is proved that the rational mode of operation is reached by a design of a two-layer porous insert given when the resistance factor increases more intensively and from the parameter ψ, and from a relative eccentricity ɛ in comparison with the bearing having a single-layer insert. Hence, anisotropy of permeability of <b>porous</b> <b>layers</b> in a circumferential and radial direction has a defined possibility of practical application of this new model...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{possibility}} to prepare ZnSe <b>porous</b> <b>layers</b> with different degrees of po-rosity by means of electrochemical methods. The prepared porous structures were characte-rized using scanning electron microscopy (SEM), photoluminescence (PL) and cathodoluminescence (CL) techniques.

The analysis of the de-pendence of these bands upon the excitation power density and temperature suggests that free-to-bound and respectively donor-acceptor electron transitions are responsible for the emission bands involved. The comparison of SEM and CL images taken from the same po-rous regions demonstrated that cathodoluminescence intensity from layers with small charac-teristic sizes of the porous entities (around 50 nm) is weaker than that inherent in bulk material, while <b>porous</b> <b>layers</b> with the pore diameter of around 500 nm exhibit much stronger luminescence...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to explore the effect of date palm fibre as backing on sound {{absorption}} using three types of perforation plates and <b>porous</b> <b>layers.</b> The predicted results were verified by measurements conducted in an impedance tube on normal incidence sound absorption of 30 and 50 mm-thick date palm fibre and backing that may have positive effect are elaborated in this study. It describes how the porous materials of date palm fibre absorber panel can change the absorption behavior. The results obtained show that perforation plate, <b>porous</b> <b>layers</b> have a significant effect on absorption, whereas thickness panel have considerable effect too. This further indicate that three types have been used and also supported can be powerfully exploited to improve the absorption of date palm fibre and at the same time a reasonable thickness chosen, would be very efficient for absorption sound. An example is presented to show the approaches of enhancing the absorption, by utilizing the advantage of modification in the absorption sound.

Three types of perforation plate, <b>porous</b> <b>layers</b> were used to improve acoustic properties of date palm fibre.

40|$|A pore-scale {{numerical}} model for reactive transport processes {{based on the}} Lattice Boltzmann method is used to study the dissolution-induced changes in hydrologic properties of a fractured medium and a porous medium. The solid phase of both media consists of two minerals, and a structure reconstruction method called quartet structure generation set is employed to generate the distributions of both minerals. Emphasis is put {{on the effects of}} undissolved minerals on the changes of permeability and porosity under different Peclet and Damkohler numbers. The simulation results show <b>porous</b> <b>layers</b> formed by the undissolved mineral remain behind the dissolution reaction front. Due to the large flow resistance in these <b>porous</b> <b>layers,</b> the permeability increases very slowly or even remains at a small value although the porosity increases by a large amount. Besides, due to the heterogeneous characteristic of the dissolution, the chemical, mechanical and hydraulic apertures are very different from each other.

40|$|In this work, {{we propose}} a new {{approach}} to modeling multiphase flow and solute transport through a stack of thin <b>porous</b> <b>layers.</b> Currently, numerical simulation of thin layers involves discretization across the layer thickness. In our new approach, thin <b>porous</b> <b>layers</b> are treated as a bunch of two-dimensional (2 D) interacting continua. Macroscale balance laws are formulated in terms of thickness-averaged material properties. A number of exchange terms are employed to account for exchanges of mass, momentum, energy, and entropy between two neighboring layers. The entropy inequality is then exploited for obtaining constitutive equations to close the problem under study. As an example, simplified governing equations are derived for a system of air–water flow and heat transfer through two thin <b>porous</b> <b>layers.</b> In comparison to previous macroscale models, our model possesses the following distinctive advantages: (1) it is rigorous thermodynamics-based model; (2) it is formulated in terms of layer-thickness-averaged material properties which are usually easily measurable; and (3) it reduces 3 D modeling to 2 D leading to a very significant reduction of computational efforts...|$|R
