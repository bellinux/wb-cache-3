5|$|The Octopus card {{has also}} grown {{to be used}} for payment in many retail shops in Hong Kong, from {{convenience}} stores, supermarkets, fast-food restaurants, on-street <b>parking</b> <b>meters,</b> car parks, to other point-of-sale applications such as service stations and vending machines.|$|E
5|$|Notable {{businesses}} that started accepting Octopus cards {{at a very}} early stage include PARKnSHOP, Wellcome, Watsons, 7-Eleven, Starbucks, McDonald's, and Circle K. As of 21 November 2004, all <b>parking</b> <b>meters</b> in Hong Kong were converted. They no longer accept coins and Octopus became the only form of payment accepted.|$|E
5|$|Off-grid system {{users can}} either adapt to {{intermittent}} power or use batteries, photovoltaic or diesel systems {{to supplement the}} wind turbine. Equipment such as <b>parking</b> <b>meters,</b> traffic warning signs, street lighting, or wireless Internet gateways may be powered by a small wind turbine, possibly combined with a photovoltaic system, that charges a small battery replacing {{the need for a}} connection to the power grid.|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1920s, Babson filed several patents for a <b>parking</b> <b>meter.</b> The meters were {{suggested}} {{to operate on}} power from the battery of the parking vehicle and required a connection from the vehicle to the meter. In 1932, Carl Magee began {{to work on the}} <b>parking</b> <b>meter</b> and since his <b>parking</b> <b>meter</b> was the first to be installed for actual use on July 1935 in Oklahoma city, Magee is known as the inventor of the <b>parking</b> <b>meter.</b>|$|R

50|$|Holger George Thuesen and Gerald A. Hale {{designed}} the first working <b>parking</b> <b>meter,</b> the Black Maria, in 1935. The History Channel's... History's Lost and Found documents {{their success in}} developing the first working <b>parking</b> <b>meter.</b> Thuesen and Hale were engineering professors at Oklahoma State University and began working on the <b>parking</b> <b>meter</b> in 1933 {{at the request of}} Oklahoma City, Oklahoma lawyer and newspaper publisher Carl C. Magee. The world's first installed <b>parking</b> <b>meter</b> was in Oklahoma City on July 16, 1935. Magee received a patent for the apparatus on 24 May 1938.|$|R
5|$|The game's city {{environment}} is modeled after Chicago, including {{many of its}} landmarks, such as the 'L', the Willis Tower (then known as the Sears Tower), Wrigley Field, and Soldier Field. The streets feature a number of objects into which the player can crash, including trash bins, <b>parking</b> <b>meters,</b> mailboxes, and traffic lights. In Checkpoint, other vehicles move in accordance with traffic lights, but the player is {{under no obligation to}} obey them.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, the Hong Kong Monetary Authority {{granted a}} deposit-taking company license to the operator, {{removing}} previous restrictions that prohibited Octopus from generating more than 15 {{percent of its}} turnover from non-transit-related functions. This allowed the Octopus card to be widely adopted for non-transit-related sales transactions. On 29 June 2003, the Octopus card found another application when the Hong Kong Government started to replace all its 18,000 <b>parking</b> <b>meters</b> with a new Octopus card-operated system. The replacement was completed on 21 November 2004.|$|E
5|$|The city of Minneapolis had {{connected}} 30 {{security cameras}} and 35 electronic street signs {{to the network}} {{by the end of}} 2010, with the intention to connect 50 network-enabled <b>parking</b> <b>meters</b> and 10 garbage trucks to the system in the near future. Fire and police conversion to the citywide network was also underway, though the city was taking necessary precautions to ensure that the two services, who will ultimately have their own dedicated frequency, continue to offer uninterrupted public safety service.|$|E
5000|$|An {{in-vehicle}} <b>parking</b> <b>meter</b> (IVPM) (also {{known as}} in-vehicle personal <b>meter,</b> in-car <b>parking</b> <b>meter,</b> or personal <b>parking</b> <b>meter)</b> is a handheld electronic device, {{roughly the size}} of a pocket calculator, that drivers display in their car windows either as a parking permit or as proof of parking payment. [...] IVPM was first implemented in the late 1980s in Arlington, VA, and is spreading to campuses and municipalities worldwide as a centralized method of parking management, revenue collection, and compliance enforcement.|$|R

5|$|A former film studio {{located on}} Eastern Avenue was {{designated}} as a temporary detention centre for individuals arrested during the summit. Toronto Police Service announced that Trinity Bellwoods Park would be the designated protest area, but following opposition from local residents, police relocated the designated protest zone to {{the northern part of}} Queen's Park. Canada Post declared that it would remove post boxes in the security zone. Toronto Parking Authority removed some <b>parking</b> <b>meters</b> as well. Small trees along sidewalks around the convention centre were removed to prevent them from being used as weapons by protesters. Other removed municipal properties include 745 newspaper boxes, 200 public trash cans, 70 mailboxes, 29 bus shelters, and 5 public information boards.|$|E
5|$|In 1946 Alcoa {{decided to}} build a new rolling mill east of Davenport in Riverdale, Iowa. With the construction, {{concerns}} about postwar unemployment ended. Retailing in Davenport was changed by the inclusion of the automobile into mainstream America. In the late 1940s, <b>parking</b> <b>meters</b> were installed in downtown to encourage rotation of space between different users. Soon there were more cars then the street parking spaces could handle. In 1953, the first multi-story ramp was completed in the state, on the corner of Fifth Street and Brady Street. The large variety of shops kept downtown a retail leader even after the opening of the Village Shopping Center in 1956. Another first for Iowa.|$|E
5|$|Unlike its predecessor, Panic on Funkotron is a side-scrolling {{platform}} game {{in which}} up to two players play as ToeJam and Earl as they travel across Funkotron to capture antagonistic Earthlings that had stowed away. Players accomplish this by using a radar to locate an Earthling's proximity (some Earthlings may be hidden in the environment) and attack them with jars in order to trap and collect them. Once all Earthlings have been found, the player can {{move on to the}} next level. Players can collect presents containing various bonuses, such as super jars, radar scans, and teleporting moves. Coins can be used with <b>parking</b> <b>meters</b> to trigger events in the environment or participate in minigames such as Jam Outs and Fungus Olympics. Players can also enter gateways leading to the Hyper Funk Zone, where the player must avoid obstacles in order to earn more presents. Hidden throughout the game are ten objects belonging to Lamont the Funkapotamus; collecting all of which will earn the player the best ending upon completion.|$|E

25|$|The {{change to}} smaller coins is also {{advantageous}} to Australia, as the outgoing 5, 10, and 20c coins {{were of the}} same size and weight as Australian coins of these denominations, and were easily confused by shopkeepers and retailers, as well as being usable in Australian vending machines and <b>parking</b> <b>meters.</b>|$|E
25|$|Until 2007, {{the city}} of San Jose, California issued a free parking tag for hybrid {{electric}} cars purchased at San Jose dealerships, after which the tag began being issued for a fee annually.

25|$|Similarly, {{in times}} of high inflation, tokens have {{sometimes}} taken on a currency role. An {{example of this is}} Italian or Israeli telephone tokens, which were always good for the same service (i.e., one phone call) even as prices increased. New York City Subway tokens were also accepted sometimes in trade, or even in <b>parking</b> <b>meters,</b> since they had a set value.|$|E
25|$|Free Parking {{card game}} (1988) A more complex card game {{released}} by Parker Brothers, with several similarities to the card game Mille Bornes. Uses cards to either add time to <b>parking</b> <b>meters,</b> or {{spend the time}} doing activities to earn points. Includes a deck of Second Chance cards that further alter game-play. Two editions were made; minor differences in card art and Second Chance cards in each edition.|$|E
25|$|Geelong {{continued}} to expand with Corio, Highton, and Belmont growing {{at such a}} rate that in February 1967, Geelong accounted for 21% of private home development in Greater Melbourne. Private vehicles became the city's major mode of transport. The first <b>parking</b> <b>meters</b> in the city were introduced in 1961, new petrol stations were constructed and the city's first supermarket, operated by Coles, opened in 1965. Later, support came for Cycling in Geelong with Australia's first bike plan in 1977.|$|E

There are several smaller paid parking lots and on-street parking enforced by <b>parking</b> <b>meters</b> in the downtown area along with a few paid parking lots {{in the northern part of}} Ocean City.|$|E
25|$|Until {{a decade}} or so ago, PV was used {{frequently}} to power calculators and novelty devices. Improvements in integrated circuits and low power liquid crystal displays make it possible to power such devices for several years between battery changes, making PV use less common. In contrast, solar powered remote fixed devices have seen increasing use recently in locations where significant connection cost makes grid power prohibitively expensive. Such applications include solar lamps, water pumps, <b>parking</b> <b>meters,</b> emergency telephones, trash compactors, temporary traffic signs, charging stations, and remote guard posts and signals.|$|E
25|$|In Wilmington, {{streets are}} {{laid out in a}} grid, with north-south streets named and east-west streets north of Lancaster Avenue/Front Street {{numbered}} from 2nd Street and increasing to the north, while east-west streets south of Lancaster Avenue/Front Street are named. Lancaster Avenue/Front Street serves as the divider between north and south while Market Street serves as the divider between east and west. There are 34 red light cameras in the city of Wilmington situated at 31 intersections. Parking in downtown Wilmington is regulated by on-street <b>parking</b> <b>meters</b> along with commercial parking lots and parking garages operated by the Wilmington Parking Authority, Colonial Parking, and SP Plus Corporation.|$|E
2500|$|A <b>parking</b> <b>meter</b> is {{a device}} {{used to collect}} money in {{exchange}} for the right to park a vehicle in a particular place for a limited amount of time.
