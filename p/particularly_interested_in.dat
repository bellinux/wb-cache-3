5|$|The band {{were well}} known for their strong stage act, and had privately {{recorded}} several shows, or broadcast them on radio, but were unenthusiastic about recording a live album until their Japanese record company {{decided it would be}} good for publicity. They insisted on supervising the live production, including using Martin Birch, who had previously collaborated with the band, as engineer, and were not <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the album's release, even after recording. The tour was successful, with strong media interest and a positive response from fans.|$|E
5|$|The {{larger the}} {{population}} {{size of the}} G. cruciata, the more flowers and seeds the plant produces; however, {{there is also a}} positive link between the population size of the G. cruciata and the frequency of P. rebeli parasitizing the plant. Researchers are <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the G. cruciata plant because both the P. rebeli and G. cruciata are endangered. As a result, lepidopterists believe that conserving the P. rebeli requires focusing conservation efforts on preserving G. cruciata as well.|$|E
5000|$|His {{skill as}} an artist was {{appreciated}} by the Qianlong Emperor, and Castiglione served the Emperor for three decades and was granted increasingly higher ofﬁcial rank within the Qing court. He spent {{many years in the}} court painting various subjects, including the portraits of the emperor and empress. Qianlong showed <b>particularly</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> paintings of tribute horses presented to Emperor on which Castiglione painted a series.|$|R

5|$|Although the Coris were {{discouraged}} from working together at Roswell, {{they continued to}} do so, specializing in investigating carbohydrate metabolism. They were <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> how glucose is metabolized {{in the human body}} and the hormones that regulate this process. They published fifty papers while at Roswell, with first author status going to the one who had done most of the research for a given paper. Gerty Cori published eleven articles as the sole author. In 1929, they proposed the theoretical cycle that later won them the Nobel Prize, the Cori cycle.|$|E
5|$|Formal {{schooling}} did {{not start}} in Hungary {{until the age of}} ten. Instead, governesses taught von Neumann, his brothers and his cousins. Max believed that knowledge of languages other than Hungarian was essential, so the children were tutored in English, French, German and Italian. By the age of 8, von Neumann was familiar with differential and integral calculus, but he was <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> history, reading his way through Wilhelm Oncken's 46-volume Allgemeine Geschichte in Einzeldarstellungen. A copy was contained in a private library Max purchased. One of the rooms in the apartment was converted into a library and reading room, with bookshelves from ceiling to floor.|$|E
5|$|He was <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> {{dementia}} praecox (which {{he favored}} renaming schizophrenia), and found diffuse anatomic {{differences in the}} brains of schizophrenic patients. These changes were ignored or dismissed as artifactual by other investigators for several decades. Serious attention to Southard's findings did not reemerge in the medical literature until the 1990s, but changes in diagnostic criteria complicate the application of Southard's findings to modern schizophrenic patients. Shortly before his death Southard wrote and presented Non-dementia non-praecox: note on the advantages to mental hygiene of extirpating a term, but did not live to see it published.|$|E

5|$|Internationally, Burnet was a {{chairman}} of the Papua New Guinea Medical Research Advisory Committee between 1962 and 1969. At the time, Papua New Guinea was an Australian territory, and Burnet had first travelled there as his son was posted there. His role on the committee allowed him to explore his interest in human biology. He was <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> kuru (laughing sickness), and lobbied the Australian government to establish the Papua New Guinea Institute of Human Biology. Burnet later helped oversee the institute's contribution to the Anglo-Australian participation in the International Biological Programme in the Field of Human Adaptability.|$|E
5|$|Linnaeus {{began his}} {{expedition}} from Uppsala on May 12, 1732, {{just before he}} turned 25. He travelled on foot and horse, bringing with him his journal, botanical and ornithological manuscripts and sheets of paper for pressing plants. Near Gävle he found great quantities of Campanula serpyllifolia, later known as Linnaea borealis, the twinflower that would become his favourite. He sometimes dismounted {{on the way to}} examine a flower or rock and was <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> mosses and lichens, the latter a main part of the diet of the reindeer, a common and economically important animal in Lapland.|$|E
5|$|The British government's {{principal}} {{interest in}} Japan was to renew pre-war trade concessions, and to secure new ones; it was <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> {{the port city}} of Kobe. The Americans blocked these attempts. Robertson clashed repeatedly with Lieutenant General Sir Charles Gairdner, the official representative of the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom. Gairdner was nominally senior in rank to Robertson until March 1947, when Robertson was promoted to the substantive rank of lieutenant general, backdated to January 1944. Robertson resisted Gairdner's requests for BCOF aircraft for personal purposes.|$|E

5|$|The {{defining}} {{mission of}} the Marine Corps has been to perform an amphibious landing, and they were <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the JVX program. They realized that a concentrated strike force was vulnerable to a single nuclear weapon, airborne solutions with good speed and range allowed for significant dispersal; and their CH-46s were wearing out; without replacement, {{the threat of a}} merger between the Marine Corps and the Army lingered, similar to President Truman's proposal following World War II. The OSD and Navy administration were against the tiltrotor project, but congressional pressure eventually proved persuasive.|$|E
5|$|Żółkiewski {{attended}} a cathedral school in Lwów (now L'viv, Ukraine). Unlike {{many of his}} peers he had no higher education and did not travel abroad. However, he pursued studies {{on his own and}} was <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> history and historical literature. In 1566 he joined the court of King Sigismund II Augustus, as an aid to the king's secretary Jan Zamoyski. There he became familiar with the executionist movement, which advocated numerous reforms including military ones. In 1573 he took part in the diplomatic mission to France, sent to meet a newly elected king Henry III of France, and on his way back he was sent to Vienna to appease the Habsburgs.|$|E
5|$|After passing his exam, Woodruff {{entered his}} {{position}} at Sheffield, where he trained in emergency and elective surgery. Originally, {{he had planned}} to do surgical research, but Sheffield had no space for him in its surgical lab. Instead, Woodruff was given a place in the pathology laboratory where he studied transplant rejection, a process in which the immune system of a transplant recipient attacks the transplanted tissue. Woodruff was <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> thyroid allografts to the anterior chamber of the eye because they did not appear to meet with rejection. Woodruff's work with the allografts gave him a solid basis to work in the developing field of transplantion and rejection. To further himself in these areas, Woodruff arranged to meet Peter Medawar, an eminent zoologist and important pioneer in the study of rejection. The two men discussed transplantation and rejection, beginning a lasting professional relationship. Despite his achievements at Sheffield, Woodruff was rejected upon applying for a post at the Royal Melbourne Hospital.|$|E

5|$|At Auschwitz, {{the actual}} {{delivery}} of gas {{to the victims}} was always handled by the SS, {{on the order of}} the supervising SS doctor. Many of the SS doctors also conducted inhumane medical experiments on camp prisoners. The most infamous SS doctor, Josef Mengele, served as a medical officer at Auschwitz under the command of Eduard Wirths of the camp's medical corps. Mengele undertook selections even when he was not assigned {{to do so in the}} hope of finding subjects for his experiments. He was <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> locating sets of twins. In contrast to most of the doctors, who viewed undertaking selections as one of their most stressful and horrible duties, Mengele undertook the task with a flamboyant air, often smiling or whistling a tune. After the war, many SS doctors were charged with war crimes for their inhumane medical experiments and for their role in gas chamber selections.|$|E
5|$|Australia was <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> {{developing}} {{atomic energy}} {{as the country}} was then thought to have no oil and only limited supplies of coal. Plans for atomic power were considered along with hydroelectricity {{as part of the}} post-war Snowy Mountains Scheme. There was also interest in the production of uranium-235 and plutonium for nuclear weapons. The Australian government had hopes of collaboration with Britain on nuclear energy and nuclear weapons. Unlike Canada, Australia was not a party to the Quebec Agreement or its successor, the 1948 Modus Vivendi, and Britain would not share technical information with Australia for fear that it might jeopardise its far more important relationship with the United States. The Americans were reluctant to share secret information with Australia after the Venona project revealed the extent of Soviet espionage activities in Australia.|$|E
5|$|Edward had {{a normal}} {{upbringing}} for {{a member of}} a royal family. The prince was interested in horses and horsebreeding, and became a good rider; he also liked dogs, in particular greyhounds. In his letters, he shows a quirky sense of humour, joking about sending unsatisfactory animals to his friends, such as horses who disliked carrying their riders, or lazy hunting dogs too slow to catch rabbits. He was not <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> hunting or falconry, both popular activities in the 14th century. He enjoyed music, including Welsh music and the newly invented crwth instrument, as well as musical organs. He did not take part in jousting, either because he lacked the aptitude or because he had been banned from participating for his personal safety, but he was certainly supportive of the sport.|$|E
5000|$|Neumman {{was also}} a {{prolific}} art collector. He had <b>particularly</b> keen <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> Taino and Antillean pottery in Puerto Rico. Part of his [...] "Bird-Effigy" [...] bowl collection was acquired by Jesse Walter Fewkes in 1919.|$|R

50|$|Amédée William Merlaud-Ponty was a French colonial {{administrator}} (b. 4 February 1866 in Rochefort, Charente-Maritime; d. 13 June 1915 in Dakar, Senegal). He was a Governor General of French West Africa (1908 - 1915) who <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> himself <b>in</b> {{the economic}} development and education of Africa.|$|R
5|$|Hergé {{was also}} {{influenced}} by {{a special edition of}} radical anticonformist magazine Le Crapouillot (The Mortar Shell) that was published in October 1930. Devoted to the United States, it contained a variety of photographs that influenced his depiction of the country. Hergé used its images of skyscrapers as a basis for his depiction of Chicago and adopted its account of Native Americans being evicted from their land when oil was discovered there. He was <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the articles in the magazine written by reporter Claude Blanchard, who had recently travelled the U.S. He reported on the situation in Chicago and New York City and met with Native Americans in New Mexico. Blanchard's article discussed the gangster George Moran, whom literary critic Jean-Marie Apostolidès believed provided the basis for the character Bobby Smiles.|$|E
5|$|In 1926, Kenney {{became a}} student at the Air Corps Tactical School, at Langley Field, Virginia, the Air Corps' {{advanced}} training school. He then attended the Command and General Staff School at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas, the Army's advanced school where officers were taught how to handle large formations as commanders or staff officers. Most Air Corps officers, including Kenney, considered the course largely irrelevant to them, and therefore a waste of time, but nonetheless a prerequisite for promotion in a ground-oriented Army. Afterwards, he returned to the Air Corps Tactical School as an instructor. He taught classes of attack aviation. He was <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> low-level attacks, as a means of improving accuracy. There were tactical problems with this, as low-flying aircraft were vulnerable to ground fire. There were also technical problems to be solved, as an aircraft could be struck by its own bomb fragments. His interest in attack aviation would ultimately set him apart in an Air Corps where strategic bombardment came to dominate thinking.|$|E
5|$|In 1937, Wordie {{organised}} {{an expedition}} to North West Greenland to investigate cosmic radiation at high latitudes and great altitudes. He assembled a team of ten men, nine of whom were from Cambridge University, among them Lethbridge and two other archaeologists. Setting sail in June 1937, Lethbridge undertook excavations of Eskimo sites at Rhyder Island, Cary Island, North West Island, and Isbjörn Island. On returning home in October 1937, {{it was decided that}} various geographical features encountered would be named after team members, and thus two lakes on Baffin Island were named the Lethbridge Lakes. During the trip, Lethbridge became <b>particularly</b> <b>interested</b> <b>in</b> the design of Eskimo boats, resulting in the self-publication of his 11-page booklet, Umiak – the European Ancestry of the 'Women's Boat, in 1937. He followed this with a second book, The Fishermen of Durness (1938), in which he argued that a study of contemporary traditional fishing communities could inform archaeologists more about ancient boat-making and fishing.|$|E

40|$|This article explores {{connections}} between the decline of prophecy {{and the evolution of}} a monarchic mono-episcopate ecclesiological structure in the early Catholic Church. Of <b>particularly</b> <b>interest</b> <b>in</b> this evolution is the attempt to institutionalize the Holy Spirit within the post-apostolic ecclesial structure. This article argues that the Spirit of God is not governed by institutional necessity. Indeed, the freedom and resulting dynamism of the Spirit seems to require a light institutional structure and a radical power inverted vision of church such as seen in the Pauline churches. Hence this article argues that something like a Pauline ecclesiology is needed if the church is to practice an apostolic pneumatology...|$|R
