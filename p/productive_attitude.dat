Corner argues that it is an approach that focuses on process rather than a style and that it marks a <b>productive</b> <b>attitude</b> toward indeterminacy, open-endedness, inter-mixing, and cross-disciplinarity.|$|E

This is a <b>productive</b> <b>attitude,</b> because it always generates incentives for continued effort and progress. An alternative attitude adopted by some of our professional colleagues is agnostic: we do not know the underlying structure of commodity markets and perhaps cannot know it so we might as well give up and fit a reduced-form or a time series model. ...|$|E
40|$|This book {{chapter is}} closed access until March 2018. Entrepreneurs’ human capital is {{important}} in the entrepreneur-venture capitalist (E-VC) relationship where conflict between the two parties is almost inevitable. However, how human capital affects entrepreneurs’ responses to conflict is under explored. Adopting a qualitative analysis, this study integrates the human capital and conflict management literature to examine the factors that cause conflict in the E-VC relationship in China and to investigate how entrepreneurs with different degrees of human capital respond to conflict. Our findings show communication barriers, and different goals and value systems are the main sources of conflict between Chinese entrepreneurs and foreign VCs. Entrepreneurs with start-up experience are more likely to adopt collaborative and competing strategies and hence have a more positive and <b>productive</b> <b>attitude</b> towards conflict with VCs, whereas inexperienced entrepreneurs tend to use passive accommodating and avoiding approaches that create problems in the E-VC relationship...|$|E

These predictions are incomplete, though, due to limitations of the standardized tests themselves.

While one had high normalized gains, the other did not, due to "false favorable" responses on the MPEX.

This is a quantitative research using Structual Equation Modelling. The respondents are 115 poor housewives in Parung, Bogor, West Java; Cipinang, East Jakarta; Tanjung Pasir, Tangerang, Banten; and Bantar Gebang, Bekasi, West Java. The variables that used on this research are the mentoring of zakah <b>productive,</b> saving <b>attitude,</b> saving behavior, and prosperity. The result showed that the mentoring of productive zakah program has significant influence for the saving attitude and saving behavior.

40|$|This {{paper is}} part of the Focused Collection on Gender in Physics. ] There is growing {{evidence}} of persistent gender achievement gaps in university physics instruction, not only for learning physics content, but also for developing <b>productive</b> <b>attitudes</b> and beliefs about learning physics. These gaps occur in both traditional and interactive-engagement (IE) styles of physics instruction. We investigated one gender gap in the area of attitudes and beliefs. This was men’s and women’s physics self-efficacy, which comprises students’ thoughts and feelings about their capabilities to succeed as learners in physics. According to extant research using pre- and post-course surveys, the self-efficacy of both men and women tends to be reduced after taking traditional and IE physics courses. Moreover, self-efficacy is reduced further for women than for men. However, it remains unclear from these studies whether this gender difference is caused by physics instruction. It may be, for instance, that the greater reduction of women’s self-efficacy in physics merely reflects a broader trend in university education that {{has little to do with}} physics per se. We investigated this and other alternative causes, using an in-the-moment measurement technique called the Experience Sampling Method (ESM). We used ESM to collect multiple samples of university students’ feelings of self-efficacy during four types of activity for two one-week periods: (i)  an introductory IE physics course, (ii)  students’ other introductory STEM courses, (iii)  their non-STEM courses, and (iv)  their activities outside of school. We found that women experienced the IE physics course with lower self-efficacy than men, but for the other three activity types, women’s self-efficacy was not reliably different from men’s. We therefore concluded that the experience of physics instruction in the IE physics course depressed women’s self-efficacy. Using complementary measures showing the IE physics course to be similar to others in which gendered self-efficacy effects have been consistently observed, we further concluded that IE physics instruction in general is likely to be detrimental to women’s self-efficacy. Consequently, there is a clear need to redress this inequity in IE physics, and probably also in traditional instruction...|$|R
30|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the {{perceived}} desirability of entrepreneurship among a fairly diverse group of business students in Chennai, South India. We examine the relative importance of two principal sets of factors, i.e., stocks of youth human/social capital and personality traits that could serve as predictors of the ‘entrepreneurial attitude’ or the propensity to venture into business startup, self-employment and private sector risk taking behavior. A majority of the studies that have addressed the subject of career choice have focused on one set of these variables, often to the neglect of the other (Hofstede, 1998; Schwartz, 2003). We view the creation of this attitude in much the same way as economists view the production of any <b>productive</b> behavior or <b>attitude,</b> i.e., as a function of work ethic (labor) and resources (capital). The implications of a significant relationship between personality traits and entrepreneurial attitude vis a vis a strong connection between human/social capital and entrepreneurial propensity would seem to have important implications for the manner in which entrepreneurial attitudes are fostered and nurtured.|$|R
