5|$|In April 2016, {{after missing}} the initial October 2015 deadline, Caltrain {{requested}} {{a third party}} review of the CBOSS project from the American Public Transportation Association (APTA). APTA noted that Caltrain was not effectively managing the <b>project</b> <b>schedule</b> and cost because of generally poor communication between Caltrain's project management and Parsons, and Caltrain's project manager {{did not have the}} technical experience or authority to resolve technical and contractual issues with Parsons. In February 2017, Caltrain terminated its contract with Parsons for failure to perform on time and budget and announced potential litigation. Parsons filed suit on February 22, saying delays were due to changing client requirements and circumstances beyond their control. Caltrain filed suit a week later, seeking $98million in damages; although the system has been mostly installed, testing is still incomplete.|$|E

The stochastic resource-constrained <b>project</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem (SRCPSP), the main context of stochastic <b>project</b> <b>scheduling,</b> {{is characterized by}} random activity durations and scheduling policy. Activity durations {{are assumed to be}} random variables, and a scheduling policy is used to decide which activities to be started at decision points (the starting time of the project and the finishing times of activities) [5]. Generally, the SRCPSP aims at minimizing the expected makespan by making a limited set of decisions during project execution [6]. For more details about SRCPSP, readers may refer to [7 – 13].|$|R

25|$|Once {{events and}} event chains are defined, {{quantitative}} analysis using Monte Carlo simulation {{can be performed}} to quantify {{the cumulative effect of}} the events. Probabilities and effects of risks are used as input data for Monte Carlo simulation of the <b>project</b> <b>schedule.</b> In most real life projects, it is necessary to supplement the information regarding the uncertainties expressed as an event, with distributions related to duration, start time, cost, and other parameters.|$|E
25|$|If {{event or}} event chain occurs {{during the course}} of a project, it may require some {{mitigation}} effort. In some cases, mitigation plans can be generated. Mitigation plans are an activity or group of activities (small schedule) that augment the <b>project</b> <b>schedule</b> if a certain event occurs. The solution is to assign the mitigation plan to an event or event chain. These small schedules will be triggered when an event chain occurs. The same mitigation plan can be used for different events.|$|E

25|$|To {{design the}} {{memorial}} on the slightly restricted site, the memorial foundation held a design competition. On November 11, 2002, the DVLMF invited about 20 architects and landscape architects to submit design proposals for the memorial. Six firms {{responded with a}} proposal. The DVLMF established a nine-member design committee consisting {{of members of the}} foundation's Board of Directors as well as noted architects, artists, and landscape architects. In February 2003, the six proposals were presented anonymously to the design committee. Two firms, Michael Vergason Landscape Architects and Nelson Byrd Woltz Landscape Architects, were asked to submit a refined proposal. This second proposal included, among other things, cost estimates, a <b>project</b> <b>schedule,</b> and a scale model. The design committee submitted a list of questions to each firm, and asked them to address the questions in their second submission. Each firm was also asked to discuss possible design alternatives. In July 2003, the design committee selected Michael Vergason Landscape Architects as the memorial designer. The DVLMF Board of Directors affirmed the choice.|$|E

Multimode Resource Constrained <b>Project</b> <b>scheduling</b> problem (MRCPSP) is NP-hard problem {{in which each}} activity has several non-preemptive execution modes. Each execution mode of an activity has a different resource requirement (renewable and non-renewable resource) and a related duration. On <b>project</b> <b>scheduling</b> problems with multiple execution modes, the genetic algorithm performed better than deterministic, bounded enumerative search methods.
