40|$|An {{experimental}} apparatus {{was developed}} for the absorption of carbon dioxide into a falling layer of pure water. The liquid height of transfer unit, HtL, for the experimental apparatus in theory closely approximates the HtL for a packed absorption tower which was derived by Davidson(9) by considering a random angle, fixed length statistical model for the random packing in the tower. Data was obtained with the experimental apparatus {{for the purpose of}} testing the assumptions used by Davidson(9) in formulating his equation for HtL, for a <b>packed</b> <b>tower.</b> The results suggest that the assumption of perfect mixing between the liquid surface and the liquid bulk when the liquid flows from one piece of packing to another in a column may not be justified. Rippling on the liquid surface, which was neglected in the mathematical model for a <b>packed</b> <b>tower,</b> may serve to counter balance the effect of incomplete mixing between the elements. Since rippling probably occurs over the majority of packing at moderate flow rates in a packed column, Davidson's(9) statistical model equation can be expected to be a reasonable mathematical representation for absorption in a <b>packed</b> <b>tower.</b> Davidson's(9) other proposed statistical models for packed towers similarly should hold fairly well. The best choice between his random angle-fixed length, and his random anglerandom length, or his vertical surfaces models is made difficult by the effect of rippling which is known only in a qualitative way...|$|E
