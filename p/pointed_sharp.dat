5000|$|Belonging to {{the same}} class of {{weaponry}} as the tewhatewha and taiaha, pouwhenua are usually made of wood and have a large, broad blade known as rau {{at one end and}} a <b>pointed,</b> <b>sharp</b> tip at the other end. Usually a human head motif was carved on the shaft to form a boundary between the shaft and the long spear point. [...] Pouwhenua were used for attacking an opponent with short sharp strikes or stabbing thrusts with quick footwork {{on the part of the}} wielder. A single blow with the broad blade could easily result in death.|$|E
5000|$|In earlier {{versions}} of Dungeons & Dragons, 3.5 and previous, Tieflings have any {{of a number of}} features that reference (directly or indirectly) their fiendish lineage.

They exude a feeling of [...] "evil" [...] even though their race has become civil and no longer lusts for power. Many races distrust or outright hate Tieflings seeing them as devil worshippers. Tiefling villains often live up to this reputation, whereas player characters have the choice to abandon this stereotype.|$|E

50|$|Enamel <b>points</b> are <b>sharp</b> <b>points</b> {{that develop}} {{on the inside}} of the lower molars and outside of the upper molars. They occur over time as the horse stops chewing as far sideways. This makes the unopposed edge tooth get longer.

One of the main aims of the paper is to study the Coxeter transformation ΦC:Z►IC→Z◂IC and its dual ΦC−:Z◂IC→Z►IC of a <b>pointed</b> <b>sharp</b> Euler coalgebra C, and to relate the action of ΦC and ΦC− on a class of indecomposable finitely cogenerated C-comodules N with the ends of almost split sequences starting with N or ending at N. By applying Chin, Kleiner, and Quinn (2002) [5], we also show that if C is a pointed K-coalgebra such that the every vertex of the left Gabriel quiver QC of C has only finitely many neighbours then for any indecomposable non-projective left C-comodule N of finite K-dimension, there exists a unique almost split sequence 0 →τCN→N′→N→ 0 in the category C-Comodfc of finitely cogenerated left C-comodules, with an indecomposable comodule τCN.

Other than these <b>points,</b> <b>Sharp</b> judges the film typical of director Imaoka's work, which {{is known for its}} understatement in portraying relationships among characters on the outskirts of society.
