5|$|A high {{percentage}} of ADF personnel are drawn from the Anglo-Celtic portion of Australia's population. In 2011 the proportion of ADF personnel born in Australia and the other predominately Anglo-Celtic countries was higher than this population group's share of both the Australian workforce and overall <b>population.</b> <b>As</b> a result, analyst Mark Thomson {{has argued that the}} ADF is unrepresentative of Australia's society in this regard and that recruiting more personnel from other ethnic backgrounds would improve the ADF's language skills and cultural empathy.|$|E

5|$|During the Middle Ages, the {{geography}} dictated a dispersed economy and <b>population.</b> <b>As</b> a result, the traditional Norwegian farm culture remained strong, and Norway differed from most European countries in never adopting feudalism.

5|$|For comparison, its {{population}} was only 20,000 in 1969 and 150,000 in 1980.
