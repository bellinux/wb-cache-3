5|$|Bush won the Iowa caucuses, and {{although}} he was heavily favored to win the New Hampshire primary, he trailed McCain by 19percent and lost that primary. Despite this, Bush regained momentum, and according to <b>political</b> <b>observers,</b> he effectively became the front runner after the South Carolina primary—which according to The Boston Globe—made history for his campaign's negativity. The New York Times {{described it as a}} smear campaign.|$|E

5|$|On March 27, 1979, Brown {{interrupted}} his honeymoon with Phyllis George {{to announce}} his candidacy for governor of Kentucky. The announcement surprised most <b>political</b> <b>observers</b> because of his prior political apathy and because Brown had spent considerable time {{out of the state}} with his business ventures and lavish lifestyle. Funding his campaign with his own personal fortune, Brown launched a massive media campaign promoting his candidacy to help him overcome his late start in the race. He promised to run the state government like a business and to be a salesman for the state as governor.|$|E
5|$|The Democratic primary for the 2010 United States Senate {{election}} in Pennsylvania {{took place on}} May 18, 2010, when Congressman Joe Sestak defeated incumbent Arlen Specter, {{which led to the}} end of Specter's five-term Senatorial career. Just {{prior to the start of}} the primary campaign, after serving in the Senate as a Republican for 29 years, Specter had switched to the Democratic Party in anticipation of a difficult primary challenge by Pat Toomey; Sestak was ultimately defeated by Toomey in the general election. <b>Political</b> <b>observers</b> and journalists described the race between Specter and Sestak as one of the bitterest and most watched of all the 2010 primary elections.|$|E
5|$|Wallace Glenn Wilkinson (December 12, 1941 – July 5, 2002) was an American {{businessman}} and politician from the Commonwealth of Kentucky. From 1987 to 1991, {{he served as}} the state's 57th governor. Wilkinson {{dropped out of college}} at the University of Kentucky in 1962 to attend to a book retail business he started. The business rapidly became a national success, and Wilkinson re-invested his profits in real estate, farming, transportation, banking, coal, and construction ventures, becoming extremely wealthy. In 1987, he joined a crowded field in the Democratic gubernatorial primary. After running behind two former governors and the sitting lieutenant governor for most of the race, Wilkinson began to climb in the polls after hiring then-unknown campaign consultant James Carville. Wilkinson campaigned on a promise of no new taxes and advocated a state lottery as an alternative means of raising money for the state. Wilkinson surprised most <b>political</b> <b>observers</b> by winning the primary and going on to defeat his Republican challenger in the general election.|$|E

5|$|Despite having {{previously}} {{shown little}} inclination toward politics, Brown surprised <b>political</b> <b>observers</b> by declaring his candidacy {{for governor in}} 1979. With the state and nation facing difficult economic times, Brown promised to run the state government like a business. A strong media campaign funded by his personal fortune allowed him to win the Democratic primary {{and go on to}} defeat former Republican governor Louie B. Nunn in the general election. Because he owed few favors to established political leaders, he appointed many successful businesspeople to state posts instead of making political appointments. Following through on his campaign promise to make more diverse appointments, he named a woman and an African-American to his cabinet. During his tenure, Brown exerted less influence over the legislature than previous governors and was frequently absent from the state, leaving lieutenant governor Martha Layne Collins as acting governor for more than one quarter of his term. He briefly considered a run for the U.S. Senate after his gubernatorial term, but withdrew from the race after only three weeks, citing health issues. He has continued to invest in business ventures, the most high profile of which was Kenny Rogers Roasters, a wood-roasted chicken restaurant he founded with country music star Kenny Rogers.|$|E

25|$|After winning West Virginia, the Clinton {{campaign}} {{claimed a}} {{lead in the}} popular vote. However, the math behind this claim relied upon a number of points that were disputed by neutral <b>political</b> <b>observers</b> and by the Obama campaign.

25|$|The {{first round}} of the {{election}} saw the lowest turnout of any presidential election in Croatia's history with only 43.96% of all the citizens eligible to vote participating in the election compared to 50.57% five years ago and 62.98% ten years ago. Most <b>political</b> <b>observers</b> noted the public's increasing distrust in politicians and the political system as the main reason for the low turnout.|$|E
25|$|The first {{vote of the}} 2008 {{election}} season {{took place in the}} Iowa caucuses on January 3, 2008. McCain came in fourth place, with 13.1% of the vote. Mike Huckabee was the winner with 34%. Because McCain, unlike Romney and Huckabee, had not focused on Iowa early, his campaign officials said they were satisfied with his placement. Many <b>political</b> <b>observers</b> considered Huckabee's easy win a blow to Romney, McCain's main rival in New Hampshire. Romney spent about five times as much as Huckabee on advertising in Iowa.|$|E
5000|$|According to Saeed Laylaz, {{economic}} and <b>political</b> <b>observer</b> in Tehran, [...] "One reason for Ahmadinejad's antagonism to Parsian Bank {{was that he}} thought the bank was owned by the family of Ayatollah Hashemi Rafsanjani, his main rival in the presidential elections. After Ahmadinejad took office, Abdollah Talebi CEO, an outspoken reformist, sent {{a list of the}} shareholders to the President to prove that was untrue.

2500|$|<b>Political</b> <b>observer</b> Michael Chugani {{said there}} was no [...] "single {{credible}} reason why these novice politicians are being paid more than heads of state of some countries." [...] Lau Ngai-keung was sceptical that political appointments would help to foster local political talent, noting that such appointees may earn up to six times more than Legislative Councillors.

In 1952, O'Donnell and Robert Kennedy campaigned together to get John elected to the U.S. Senate. O'Donnell then went on to serve as John Kennedy's unpaid <b>political</b> <b>observer</b> in Massachusetts, until 1957, when he became assistant counsel to Senate Labor Rackets Committee, where he worked for Robert Kennedy, who had been appointed chief counsel of the Committee.|$|R
25|$|Delhi Elections: The Delhi Legislative Assembly {{election}} saw {{the surprise}} reversal of political fortunes for the BJP. Key to the electoral rout were {{the rejection of}} non-consensual reorganization of state-level political hierarchy and of Kiran Bedi by the local cadres who either abstained or transferred their votes to AAP. The election has been viewed by <b>political</b> <b>observers</b> as proof of rising expectations at the grass-root level of India's urban electorate which in turn lays {{the foundation for a}} win at the electoral ballot box. Indian National Congress failed to win a single seat.|$|E
25|$|After the 2004 Presidential Election, the Republicans {{gained control}} of the House {{for the first time}} since 1921.

In 2006, Republican Speaker pro Tempore Susan Winchester was seen by many <b>political</b> <b>observers</b> as in line to become the first female speaker, but lost out to Representative Lance Cargill, a former Majority leader.|$|E
25|$|Waggonner {{said that}} he would remain neutral, but shortly before the primary he criticized Roemer's {{suggestion}} that the Red River navigation program might have to be scaled down or delayed as a means to fight excessive government spending and inflation. <b>Political</b> <b>observers</b> regarded Waggonner's criticism of Roemer as a factor in Roemer's failure to obtain a general election berth. For years, the Louisiana delegation, particularly Waggonner and Democratic U.S. Senators J. Bennett Johnston, Jr., and Russell B. Long, had worked to make the river navigable from Shreveport through Alexandria and south to Simmesport, on the Avoyelles and Pointe Coupee parish border.|$|E
5000|$|In 1975, Friedman ran {{for mayor}} of Austin along with a slate of liberal candidates, {{capturing}} majority control of the city government, with the 30-year-old becoming the youngest mayor in the city's history.
