50|$|The {{blue light}} (hexaminolevulinate fluorescence) {{cystoscopy}} involves instilling a <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agent,</b> such as Cysview, into the bladder. The blue light cystoscopy contains a light source and light is transmitted through a fluid light cable connected to an endoscope {{to light up}} the area to be observed. The <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agent</b> preferentially accumulates porphyrins in malignant cells as opposed to nonmalignant cells of urothelial origin. Under subsequent blue light illumination, neoplastic lesions fluoresce red, enabling visualization of tumors. The blue light cystoscopy is used to detect non-muscle invasive papillary cancer of the bladder.|$|E

40|$|Cancer {{cells can}} {{be killed by}} <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> that induce toxic effects when exposed to {{nonhazardous}} light, but this also causes significant damage to surrounding healthy cells. The specificity of photodynamic therapy can be increased by conjugating <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> to antibodies and antibody fragments that bind specifically to tumor cell antigens. However, standard conjugation reactions produce heterogeneous products whose targeting specificity and spectroscopic properties can be compromised. In this study, we used an antibody fragment (scFv- 425) that binds to the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) as a model to investigate the use of SNAP-tag fusions as an improved conjugation strategy. The scFv- 42 S-SNAP-tag fusion protein allowed the specific conjugation of a chlorin e 6 photosensitizer modified with O(6) -benzylguanine, generating a homogeneous product that was delivered specifically to EGFR(+) cancer cells and resulted in significant, tumor cell-specific cytotoxicity.

5000|$|In medicine, photopheresis (aka extracorporeal photopheresis or ECP) {{is a form}} of apheresis and {{photodynamic}} therapy in which blood is treated with a <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agent</b> and subsequently irradiated with specified wavelengths of light to achieve an effect. Specifically, buffy coat (WBC + platelets) is separated from whole blood, chemically treated with 8-methoxypsoralen (instilled into collection bag or given per os in advance), exposed to ultraviolet light (UVA), and returned to the patient. [...] Activated 8-methoxypsoralen crosslinks DNA in exposed cells, ultimately resulting apoptosis of nucleated cells. The photochemically damaged T-cells returned to the patient appear to induce cytotoxic effects on T-cell formation. The mechanism of such “antitumor” action has not been elucidated.|$|E
40|$|International audiencePhotodynamic therapy (PDT) is an {{alternative}} treatment for cancer that involves the administration of a <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agent,</b> which is activated by light at a specific wavelength. This illumination causes after a sequence of photoreactions, the production of reactive oxygen species {{responsible for the death}} of the tumor cells but also the degradation of the <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agent,</b> which then loose the fluorescence properties. The phenomenon is commonly known as photobleaching process and can be considered as a therapy efficiency indicator. Methods: This paper presents the design and validation of a real time controller able to track a preset photobleaching trajectory by modulating the light impulses width during the treatment sessions. Results:This innovative solution was validated by in vivo experiments that have shown a significantly improvement of reproducibility of the inter-individual photobleaching kinetic. Conclusion: We believe that this approach could lead to personalized photodynamic therapy modalities.

40|$|In {{photodynamic}} therapy (PDT), a tumor-selective photosensitizer is administered and then activated {{by exposure to}} a light source of applicable wavelength. Multidrug resistance (MDR) is largely caused by the efflux of therapeutics from the tumor cell by means of P-glycoprotein (P-gp), resulting in reduced efficacy of the anticancer therapy. This study deals with {{photodynamic therapy}} with Photofrin II (Ph II) and hypericin (Hyp) on sensitive and doxorubicin-resistant colon cancer cell lines. Changes in cytosolic superoxide dismutase (SOD 1) activity after PDT and the intracellular accumulation of photosensitizers in sensitive and resistant colon cancer cell lines were examined. The photosensitizers' distributions indicate that Ph II could be a potential substrate for P-gp, in contrast to Hyp. We observed an increase in SOD 1 activity after PDT for both <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agents.</b> The changes in SOD 1 activity show that photodynamic action generates oxidative stress in the treated cells. P-gp appears {{to play a role}} in the intracellular accumulation of Ph II. Therefore the efficacy of PDT on multidrug-resistant cells depends on the affinity of P-gp to the photosensitizer used. The weaker accumulation of <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> enhances the antioxidant response, and this could influence the efficacy of PDT...|$|R
40|$|Background. One of {{the most}} {{important}} problems in head and neck oncology is early diagnosis of laryngeal cancer. Despite the introduction of new therapeutic methods and improvement of surgical techniques, patients’ 5 -year survival rate still depends primarily on the stage of the disease at the moment of introduction of appropriate treatment. Objectives. The goal {{of this study was to}} assess the efficacy of autofluorescence endoscopy (AFE) in diagnosis of laryngeal lesions. AFE examinations were carried out on out-patient basis, without general anesthesia and without using any <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> (topical or systemic). Sensitivity and specificity of AFE alone, as well as AFE combined with classic white-light endoscopy, were calculated. Material and Methods. 129 patients (30 women and 99 men) at the age between 22 – 89 with various laryngeal pathologies entered the study. Patients did not receive any <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agents.</b> No tissue staining was used. Occasionally, the patients received local 10 % Xylocaine anesthesia before the examination. All examinations were performed using modified laryngeal endoscopic setup. All patients underwent classical white-light endoscopy fol-lowed by AFE examination. Sites of possible pathologies were noted for further biopsy. The results obtained during white-light endoscopy and AFE were then compared to histopathological findings.

40|$|Most {{applications}} of photodynamic therapy (PDT) in gastroenterology {{to date have}} used porfimer sodium as the <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agent.</b> For destroying small lesions in {{the wall of the}} gastrointestinal tract in inoperable patients, it has proved to be most effective, but attempts to achieve circumferential mucosal ablation, as in the treatment of Barrett’s esophagus, have led to a high incidence of strictures, and all patients have cutaneous photosensitivity, which can last up to three months. Two new photosensitizers are of particular interest to gastroenterologists. PDT with metatetrahydroxyphenyl chlorin produces a similar biological effect as PDT with porfimer sodium, but the light doses required are much smaller, and cutaneous photosensitivity lasts only two to three weeks. Further, it can be used with percutaneous light delivery to destroy localized pancreatic cancers. The <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agent</b> 5 -amino levulinic acid, converted in vivo into the photoactive derivative protoporphyrin IX, sensitizes the mucosa much more than the underlying layers. This makes it feasible to destroy areas of abnormal mucosa without damaging the underlying muscle and is, therefore, better for treating Barrett’s esophagus. Detailed clinical studies are required to establish the real role of PDT with the use of these and other new photosensitizers...|$|E

40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) {{is based}} on the use of a <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agent</b> such as porphyrins, {{although}} the earliest descriptions of PDT involved the use of eosin. Many of the molecular details of PDT are unclear, while the basic premise of PDT is simple. A <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agent,</b> either endogenous or exogenous, is exposed to an activating light source and in the presence of oxygen produces activated intermediates, primarily singlet oxygen. Singlet oxygen is a highly reactive molecule that oxidises carbon-carbon bonds and can damage various components of the target cell (e. g., lipids, nucleic acids, etc.) directly leading to cell death. Porphyrins preferentially bind to a receptor located on the outer mitochondrial membrane called the peripheral benzodiazepine receptor. Photoactivation leads to release of mitochondrial cytochrome c and increases levels of caspases 3 and 9. Caspase 3 {{plays a major role in}} apoptosis via protein cleavage. Currently, much research is underway to help identify adjuvant treatments to potentiate the photodynamic response. Active areas of investigation include the use of agents to facilitate cutaneous penetration of photosensitizing agents, amplify the response of macrophages and other inflammatory cells, decrease angiogenesis, inhibit matrix metalloproteinase and cycloxygenase II, and activate the complement cascade. The experimental evidence is that porphyrins accumulate in the tumour tissue. Our results indicate that phenylalanine and tyrosine are the amino acids that have the most affinity in binding HpD. Recently, our investigations in vitro have sought to reduce the side effects of PDT and cytostatic therapy by using reduced amounts of compounds with a high rate of toxicity in anti-cancer protocols...|$|E
40|$|Chlorpromazine {{inhibits}} {{by about}} 60 % the lipid peroxidation stimulated by Fe 2 +/ascorbate in liposomes and the lipid peroxidation stimulated by cumene hydroperoxide in microsomes. Under the same conditions, two new synthetic derivatives of chlorpromazine, i. e., a N-benzoyloxymethylchlorpromazine and a N-pivaloyloxymethylchlorpromazine, induce {{no more than}} a 20 % inhibition. On the other hand, when the different chlorpromazines are entrapped in liposomes and subsequently irradiated with near-UV light, they act as <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> giving rise to lipid peroxidation. The latter is quite extensive in the presence of chlorpromazine or N-pivaloyloxymethylchlorpromazine, whereas it is drastically lower in the presence of N-benzoyloxymethylchlopromazine.

30|$|PDT {{has emerged}} as an {{alternative}} and promising noninvasive treatment for cancer [17]. PDT utilizes the fact that certain compounds coined as photosensitizers, when exposed to light of a specific wavelength, are capable of generating cytotoxic ROS such as hydroxyl radical, hydrogen peroxide, and superoxide to kill cancer cells [18, 19]. TiO 2, ZnO, and other semiconductor nanomaterials are regarded as the potential <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> among the photosensitizers for PDT, due to their unique phototoxic effect upon the irradiation. They {{have been used in}} the treatment of cutaneous squamous cell and basal cell carcinomas as well as cancers of the head, neck, lung, esophagus, and bladder [20]. Compared to other photosensitizers, TiO 2 Ws which we prepared are bio-safe and non-cytotoxic, leading to priority application in clinical chemotherapy.

50|$|Psoralens are {{materials}} {{that make the}} skin more sensitive to UV light. They are <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> and are found in plants naturally and also manufactured synthetically. Psoralens are taken as pills (systemically) or can be applied directly to the skin, by soaking the skin in a solution that contains the psoralens. They allow UVA energy to be effective at lower doses. When combined with exposure to the UVA in PUVA, psoralens are highly effective at clearing psoriasis and vitiligo. In the case of vitiligo, they work by increasing the sensitivity of melanocytes, the cells that manufacture skin color, to UV light. Melanocytes have sensors that detect UV light and trigger the manufacture of brown skin color. This color protects the body from {{the harmful effects of}} UV light.

40|$|Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is an {{evolving}} modality {{for the treatment}} of superficial tumors. The technique utilizes <b>photosensitizing</b> <b>agents</b> that are able to photochemically eradicate malignant cells. With the aim of improving the tumoritropic behaviour of photosensitizers, liposomes are presently being used as carrier and delivery systems for PDT. This review covers the different liposomal strategies that are available to target photosensitizers to tumor tissue. In general, conventional liposomes carrying photosensitizers are not able to establish elevated tumor-to-normal tissue ratios, hampering their generalised use as tumoritropic carriers of photosensitizers. Conversely, liposomes with a specifically modified design, i. e. long-circulating and especially actively targeting liposomes, stand a better chance in becoming truly tumoritropic carriers of photosensitizers. Strategies that can be employed to trigger the release of photosensitizer molecules from the liposomes are also discussed.
