3000|$|In their {{analysis}} of 11, 649 defaulted loans to retail customers and SMEs in Italy, Grippa et al. (2005) demonstrate that an amicable agreement between the bank and the borrower was achieved in 41  % of the cases. However, there is a specific characteristic of their study: the authors did not derive the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemptions</b> from the individual debtors’ data; the percentage was identified by the participating banks in a survey. To perform a multivariate analysis, the authors combined bank-specific data (here, the estimated fraction <b>of</b> <b>redemptions)</b> with other surveyed quantitative data (individual information regarding the individual loans, collateral, etc.). Thereby, {{they were able to}} demonstrate a significant, positive influence of the workout type, redemption, on the recovery rate. We again form the null to be rejected: [...]...|$|R
40|$|Abstract In {{the search}} for {{policies}} to reduce the effects of limited food access, little consideration {{has been given to}} how economic incentives could be used {{to make it easier for}} low-income families to access existing healthy food retailers. Using county-level, administrative data on <b>redemption</b> <b>of</b> Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program (SNAP) benefits by store type from May 2007 to May 2010, this paper investigates aggregate responses of SNAP participants to economic and policy changes. Results show that SNAP benefit increases, in general, are associ-ated with a greater <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>redemptions</b> at superstores. However, other cir-cumstances associated with the large increase in benefits enacted in April 2009 as a part of the stimulus bill reverse the positive effect. Estimates are stable across a number of specifications that also control for gas prices, store-type density, local unemployment and state policies. Results suggest that economic incentives deserve further consideration as an alternative to store development in food desert communities...|$|R
30|$|First we {{compared}} the Incongruent Negative and Congruent Negative groups for differences in words used in their reflections. The Incongruent Negative group used a greater <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> words indicating <b>redemption</b> such as acceptance words, t(49) =  2.03, p = . 048, d = . 50, using Levene’s correction for heterogeneity of variance (Incongruent Negative: M = . 19, SD = . 30, Congruent Negative: M = . 07, SD = . 15). (Note that we used Levene’s correction for all subsequent t-tests with unequal variances). The Incongruent Negative group also used a greater <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> words indicating distancing such as third-person plural pronouns, t(52.24) =  3.01, p = . 004, d = . 74 (Incongruent Negative: M = . 73, SD = . 71, Congruent Negative: M = . 30, SD = . 39). In contrast, the Congruent Negative group used a greater <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> words demonstrating an inability to distance such as first-person plural pronouns, t(43.05) = − 2.07, p = . 04, d = . 53 (Incongruent Negative: M = . 43, SD = . 56, Congruent Negative: M = . 88, SD =  1.05). We also computed the change scores in the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> words used between the initial memory and its reflection. An independent t test of change scores again revealed greater percentage increases in acceptance words for the Incongruent Negative group, t(62) =  2.08, p = . 04, d = . 53 (Incongruent Negative: MΔ = . 12, SD = . 27, Congruent Negative: MΔ = −. 01, SD = . 22).|$|R

40|$|The {{prohibition}} against 2 ̆ 2 clogging the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> 2 ̆ 2 has been {{enforced by the}} courts for centuries, yet the traditional justifications (invoking fairness or unfair bargaining power) offered for this central premise of mortgage law are rather unconvincing, particularly in the commercial context. After describing and critiquing the traditional view, this article lays out an alternative justification for the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption,</b> stressing {{the role of the}} law in fostering efficient renegotiation upon default. This view explains why the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> cannot be waived in the initial loan documents, and why it can be waived in subsequent workouts only if the court is convinced of the fairness of the waiver. Moreover, this article demonstrates that, even if the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> is an efficient term in most mortgages, an adverse selection dynamic may prevent parties from including it in their contracts, thus justifying the judicial insistence that the equity <b>of</b> <b>redemption</b> be a mandatory, rather than default, term...|$|R
