40|$|To monitor health {{information}} using wireless sensors on {{body is a}} promising new application. Human body acts as a transmission channel in wearable wireless devices, so electromagnetic propagation modeling is well thought-out for transmission channel in Wireless Body Area Sensor Network (WBASN). In this paper we have presented the wave propagation in WBASN which is modeled as <b>point</b> <b>source</b> (<b>Antenna),</b> close to {{the arm of the}} human body. Four possible cases are presented, where transmitter and receiver are inside or outside of the body. Dyadic Green's function is specifically used to propose a channel model for arm motion of human body model. This function is expanded in terms of vector wave function and scattering superposition principle. This paper describes the analytical derivation of the spherical electric field distribution model and the simulation of those derivations.

The wavelength is a few centimeters and the houses a few metres across, so there are three disparate length scales in the problem.

40|$|An {{effective}} synthesis {{procedure for}} planar antennas realized with nonuniform metasurfaces (MTSs) excited by a <b>point</b> <b>source</b> is presented. This synthesis potentiates previous formulations by introducing a {{control of the}} amplitude of the aperture field while improving the polarization and phase performances. The class of MTS antennas {{we are dealing with}} is realized by using subwavelength patches of different dimensions printed on a grounded slab, illuminated by a transverse magnetic <b>point</b> <b>source.</b> These <b>antennas</b> are based on the interaction between a cylindrical surface-wave and the periodic modulation of the MTS, which leads to radiation through a leaky-wave (LW) effect. This new design method permits a systematic and simple synthesis of amplitude, phase, and polarization of the aperture field by designing the boundary conditions imposed by the MTS. The polarization control is based on the local value of the MTS anisotropy, the phase is controlled by the shape and periodicity of the modulation, and the amplitude is controlled by the local leakage attenuation parameter of the LW. The synthesis is based on analytical formulas derived by an adiabatic Floquet-wave expansion of currents and fields over the surface, which are simultaneously published in this journal issue. The effectiveness of the procedure is tested through several numerical examples involving realistic structures...|$|R
40|$|A novel beam {{expansion}} method is {{proposed for the}} fast and accurate prediction of antenna radiation patterns. Only a few physics-based entiredomain vector basis functions called Characteristic Basis Function Patterns (CBFPs) are employed for modeling each far-field beam. To determine the beam expansion coefficients, it suffices to measure the unknown beam for a few angular directions only, after which the beam shape is modeled over a large angular region through the interpolatory CBFPs. In practical systems where multiple embedded element- or array-beams are correlated to form a covariace matrix, it even suffices to perform a single measurement on multiple independent reference <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> in the <b>antenna's</b> field of view. This {{is an important step}} forward for the fast and accurate calibration of antenna beams, in particular for imaging array systems.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} {{the designs of}} a frequency-reconfigurable, polarization reconfigurable and pattern reconfigurable antennas using metasurfaces (MS). The frequency-reconfigurable and polarization reconfigurable antennas are composed of a simple circular patch antenna or slot <b>antenna</b> as the <b>source</b> <b>antenna</b> and a circular MS with the same diameter, with both <b>source</b> <b>antenna</b> and MS implemented using planar technology. The pattern reconfigurable antenna is composed of a circular patch <b>antenna</b> as the <b>source</b> <b>antenna</b> and a semicircular MS with the same diameter. In all these reconfigurable antennas, the MS is placed directly atop of the <b>source</b> <b>antenna,</b> making the antenna very compact and low profile with a thickness of only 0. 05 λ 0.

It {{is based on the}} assumption that the seismic wave-field generated by a realistic source will match up with that generated by the corresponding centroid <b>point</b> <b>source,</b> as long as the waves investigated have sufficiently long wavelengths and periods. It is important to know whether this approximation is valid, otherwise unknown errors can be introduced into results based using the this approximation. In order to get an idea of the validity of the <b>point</b> <b>source</b> approximation, we compare the wave-field generated by various distributions of <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> to that generated by the corresponding centroid <b>point</b> <b>source.</b> While the <b>point</b> <b>source</b> distributions used do not represent the full complexity of seismic sources, these tests are still useful to explore some of the effects of combining multiple <b>point</b> <b>sources</b> into a single centroid <b>point</b> <b>source,</b> which is what the <b>point</b> <b>source</b> approximation is based on.

For the spatial dimensions, the misfit may become significant for an offset close to 40 kilometres, while at 50 kilometres, around one third of the shortest wavelength, the misfit is already very large. Realistic rupture times indicate that for sources with spatial offset closer to 20 kilometres, the misfit should be very small.
