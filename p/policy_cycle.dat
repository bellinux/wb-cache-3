5000|$|The {{policy process}} {{approach}} puts its focal point onto political processes and involved stakeholders; its scope is the broader meso-scale and it interprets problems using a political lens (i.e., {{the interests and}} goals of elected officials).

As well, it tries to explain the role and influence of stakeholders within the policy process. In the 2010s, [...] "stakeholders" [...] is defined broadly to include citizens, community groups, non-governmental organizations, businesses and even opposing political parties.

A number of different lenses can be used during evaluation, including looking at a policy's effectiveness, cost-effectiveness, value for money, outcomes or outputs.|$|E

50|$|Gender {{mainstreaming}} {{in teacher}} education policy refers to efforts to examine and change processes of policy formulation and implementation across all areas and at all levels from a gender perspective so as to address and correct existing and emerging disparities between men and women. It is a strategy to change the process of policy design, implementation and evaluation by taking into consideration the gender specific and often diverse needs, priorities, interests and values of differently positioned men and women. In this context, gender mainstreaming is about awareness {{of the existence of}} gender disparities and their causes and implications, and ensures that they are addressed at each phase of the <b>policy</b> <b>cycle</b> or policy analyses and revision.|$|E
50|$|Evaluation is {{monitoring}} and assessing {{the process and}} impact of policy implementation. Policy research and analysis are used as strategies to evaluate whether the policy goals were reached, {{and if there were}} any unanticipated positive or negative outcomes. The evaluation process also attempts to see the various types of impacts: direct versus indirect, and short term versus long term. The information gathered from the evaluation will be used as inputs in the next <b>policy</b> <b>cycle</b> or process. Policy {{monitoring and}} evaluation is usually a challenging step as it requires consistent follow up, information collection, and efforts to compare policy goals with the outcome of activities carried out to implement the policy. The policy goals serve as a framework for any instrument that is designed to collect and compile information for the evaluation. The instruments that are designed should ensure that gender is included as a category of analysis and that issues concerning both men and women are included in the questions. Specific women’s issues, as identified in the policy problem, should be covered, and during the data collection process both men and women should be included as sources of data. In the context of TEIs the data to be gathered on enrolment, performance and achievement, in-service training, promotion, leadership and administration are to be disaggregated by sex.|$|E
50|$|Monitoring policy {{development}} and implementation is an integral component of the <b>policy</b> <b>cycle</b> and can be applied in sectors including agriculture, health, education, and finance. Policy monitoring can improve policy information, collaboration among stakeholders, {{and the use of}} evaluation techniques to provide feedback to reframe and revise policies.Waterman and Wood derived policy monitoring from agency theory, describing a process where policymakers monitor the actions of their bureaucratic agents who implement and enforce policies. This monitoring allows policymakers to compensate for their agents’ greater knowledge of the policy process, and enables them to be well-informed decision makers. Thus policy monitoring allows policymakers and interested actors to systematically examine the process of creating a policy, implementing it, and evaluating its effects.Policy monitoring activities can be used to collect and analyze data related to the {{development and implementation}} of specific policies. It can also help link policies to specific outcomes and help identify and evaluate policy impacts. Policy impacts can include specific changes in behavior (e.g., increased number of people wearing seatbelts), finances (e.g., increased tax revenue), health status or epidemiology (e.g., reduced number of new HIV infections) or other social indicators (e.g., reduced crime rates, reduced levels of pollution). Data from policy monitoring can be used to support advocacy efforts and guide the development of new, timely, and relevant policies. Policy monitoring should also include the identification of operational policy barriers that can be addressed through policy and program reform, and findings can support improved implementation of existing policies.|$|E

CEPOL brings together a network of training institutes for law enforcement officials in EU Member States and supports them in providing frontline training on security priorities, law enforcement cooperation and information exchange. CEPOL also works with EU bodies, international organisations, and third countries to ensure that the most serious security threats are tackled with a collective response.CEPOL is headed by an Executive Director, who is accountable to a Management Board. The Management Board is made up of representatives from EU Member States and the EU Commission. The chair of the Management Board is a representative of one of the three Member States that have jointly prepared the Council of the European Union’s 18-month programme. The Management Board meets at least two times per year. In addition, CEPOL has dedicated National Units (CNUs) in every Member State to provide information and assistance to law enforcement officials who wish to participate in CEPOL’s activities. CNUs also support CEPOL’s operations. The agency’s annual work programme is built with input from this network and other stakeholders, resulting in topical and focused activities designed {{to meet the needs of}} Member States in the priority areas of the EU internal security strategy. Moreover, CEPOL assesses training needs to address EU security priorities.CEPOL’s current portfolio encompasses residential activities, online learning (i.e. webinars, online modules, online courses, etc.), exchange programmes, common curricula, research and science.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{understand}} the why some Social Movement Organizations (SMOs) gain greater influence over {{certain parts of the}} public <b>policy</b> <b>cycle</b> than other organizations. It asks the following question: Does a more contentious organization have more influence over specific parts of the policy process than more cooperative organizations?

The various stages of the <b>policy</b> <b>cycle</b> are taken into account when analyzing the policy influence of each SMO.
