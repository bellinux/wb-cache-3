5000|$|In the TN-C system, {{a common}} {{conductor}} provides both the neutral and <b>protective</b> <b>grounding.</b> The neutral conductor {{is connected to}} earth ground {{at the point of}} supply, and equipment cases are connected to the neutral. The danger exists that a broken neutral connection will allow all the equipment cases to rise to a dangerous voltage if any leakage or insulation fault exists in any equipment. This can be mitigated with special cables but the cost is then higher.|$|R
50|$|Single phase sockets are {{classified}} as two pole (2P) and provide a single line contact and a neutral contact. In addition, a <b>protective</b> earth (<b>Ground</b> in American terminology) contact is usually, but not always, present, {{in which case the}} socket is classified as two pole and earth(2P+E).|$|R
50|$|It {{has been}} alleged that a {{significant}} cause of current in the ground loop is voltage drop along the equipment <b>protective</b> <b>ground</b> conductors. This is rarely significant, because safety regulations place strict limits on ground leakage current, and ground conductor impedance. For modest sized pieces of equipment such as most audio equipment the ground leakage will be typically less than 2 mA, and the <b>protective</b> <b>ground</b> impedance less than 1 ohm, so this effect will only cause a few milliamps of current to flow in the loop. The current arising due to magnetic induction is liable {{to be at least}} one or two orders of magnitude greater.|$|E
5000|$|In the TN-C-S system, {{each piece}} of {{electrical}} equipment has both a <b>protective</b> <b>ground</b> connection to its case, and a neutral connection. These are all brought back to some common point in the building system, and a common connection is then made from that point back {{to the source of}} supply and to the earth.|$|E
50|$|In {{practice}} this case usually {{does not happen}} because the pickup cartridge, an inductive voltage source, need have no connection to the turntable metalwork, and so the signal ground is isolated from the chassis or <b>protective</b> <b>ground</b> at that end of the link. Therefore there is no current loop, and no hum problem due directly to the grounding arrangements.|$|E
50|$|This {{practice}} {{arose from}} the three-wire system used to supply both 120 volt and 240 volt loads. Because these listed appliances often have components that use either 120, or both 120 and 240 volts, there is often some current on the neutral wire. This differs from the <b>protective</b> <b>grounding</b> wire, which only carries current under fault conditions. Using the neutral conductor for grounding the equipment enclosure was considered safe since the devices were permanently wired to the supply and so the neutral was unlikely to be broken without also breaking both supply conductors. Also, the unbalanced current due to lamps and small motors in the appliances was small compared to the rating of the conductors and therefore unlikely to cause a large voltage drop in the neutral conductor.|$|R

50|$|In digital systems, which {{commonly}} transmit data serially (RS232, RS485, USB, Firewire, DVI, HDMI etc) {{the signal}} voltage is often {{much larger than}} induced power frequency AC on the connecting cable screens, but different problems arise. Of those protocols listed, only RS232 is single-ended with ground return, {{but it is a}} large signal, typically + and - 12V, all the others being differential. Simplistically, the big problem with the differential protocols is that with slightly mismatched capacitance from the hot and cold wires to ground, or slightly mismatched hot and cold voltage swings or edge timing, the currents in the hot and cold wires will be unequal, and also a voltage will be coupled onto the signal screen, which will cause a circulating current at signal frequency and its harmonics, extending up to possibly many GHz. The difference in signal current magnitudes between the hot and cold conductors will try to flow from, for example, item A's <b>protective</b> <b>ground</b> conductor back to a common ground in the building, and back along item B's <b>protective</b> <b>ground</b> conductor. This may involve a large loop area and cause significant radiation, violating EMC regulations and causing interference to other equipment.|$|E
50|$|In {{contrast}} to a SELV circuit, a PELV circuit can have a <b>protective</b> earth (<b>ground)</b> connection. A PELV circuit, just as with SELV, requires a design that guarantees a low risk of accidental contact with a higher voltage.

30|$|Although it can {{be easily}} agreed upon that {{registers}} provide high-quality data for integration research, an improvement therefore over other sources, some qualifications are needed. Firstly, the personal identity number in the Danish and Swedish statistical system is vital {{for the production of}} linked data; however, the central importance of this number is also a weakness of the system. If a person has not received a personal identity number, she or he will not be included in any of the regular statistical databases and an individual can only get a personal identification number if (s)he intends to stay for longer than one year (in Sweden) or three to six months (in Denmark) and has the legal right to do so. As a consequence, reliable data on short-term immigrants are missing. This also means that groups of immigrants, such as refugees or immigrants who have received a permit on other <b>protective</b> <b>grounds,</b> will be included in the population register and regular statistics only a couple of years after they have arrived in Sweden or Denmark. Secondly, since the registers include only the legally resident population, illegal immigrants, the undocumented or immigrants whose legal status has not been clarified are likely to be absent from this source. If a researcher is interested in capturing these categories, other identification methods need to be used.|$|R
50|$|If A and B {{are simple}} {{electrical}} apparatus, the signals between them being {{of a simple}} nature, such as 24V DC to control relays, this ground loop is harmless and merely reinforces the grounding system, such that, if for example, B develops a fault causing its metalwork to become live, {{in addition to its}} own <b>protective</b> <b>ground</b> conductor there is an additional path to ground via A, so the momentary rise in potential before the fuse or circuit breaker operates to remove power will be reduced somewhat, improving safety.|$|E

50|$|A {{ground loop}} {{is the result}} of {{careless}} or inappropriate design or interconnection of electrical equipment that results in there being multiple paths to ground where this is not required, so a complete loop is formed. In the simplest case, two items of equipment, A and B, both intended to be grounded for safety reasons, are each connected to a power source (wall socket etc) by a 3 conductor cable and plug, containing a <b>protective</b> <b>ground</b> conductor, usually green/yellow, in accordance with normal safety regulations and practice. This only becomes a problem when one or more signal cables are then connected between A and B, to pass data or audio signals from one to the other.

If necessary, as part of ongoing monitoring, recommendations will be given on the design and location of electromagnetic screens, reducing the levels of electromagnetic interference as well as on location of lightning rods, reducing probability lightning attachment to the objects.
