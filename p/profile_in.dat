5|$|After Ford {{left the}} White House in January 1977, the former President privately {{justified}} his pardon of Nixon by carrying {{in his wallet}} {{a portion of the}} text of Burdick v. United States, a 1915 U.S. Supreme Court decision which stated that a pardon indicated a presumption of guilt, and that acceptance of a pardon was tantamount to a confession of that guilt. In 2001, the John F. Kennedy Library Foundation awarded the John F. Kennedy <b>Profile</b> <b>in</b> Courage Award to Ford for his pardon of Nixon. In presenting the award to Ford, Senator Edward Kennedy said that he had initially been opposed to the pardon, but later decided that history had proved Ford to have made the correct decision.|$|E

5|$|Although by tradition, Hastert was {{the leader}} of the House Republicans, he adopted a much lower <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> the media than {{conventional}} wisdom would suggest for a Speaker.

The designs featured the Spanish Crown and Ferdinand VII's <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> the two varieties and were numbered manually.

5|$|The {{river otter}} is {{physically}} well-equipped for aquatic life. The ears are short, the neck {{is the same}} diameter as the head, the legs are short and powerful, the toes are fully webbed, and the tail (one-third of body length) is tapered. These qualities give the river otter a streamlined <b>profile</b> <b>in</b> water, but reduce agility on land. The smell and hearing abilities of the river otter are acute. The otter has a delicate sense of touch in the paws in addition to great dexterity. River otters characteristically approach within {{a few feet of}} a boat or a person on shore because they're near-sighted, a consequence of vision adapted for underwater sight. River otters have transparent nictitating membranes to protect their eyes while swimming.|$|E
5|$|Thomas Dudley {{was elected}} {{governor}} in 1645, with Winthrop as his deputy. Endecott, as a consolation, was given {{command of the}} colonial militia, reporting to the governor. He was also once again made a governor's assistant, and was chosen to represent the colony to the confederation in 1646. The threat of Indian conflicts in neighbouring colonies prompted the colony to raise its defensive <b>profile,</b> <b>in</b> which Endecott played a leading role. Winthrop was reelected governor in 1646; {{after his death in}} 1649, Endecott succeeded him as governor. By annual re-elections Endecott served nearly continuously until his death in 1664/5; for two periods (1650–1651 and 1654–1655) he was deputy governor.|$|E
