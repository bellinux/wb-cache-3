25|$|Trace fossils <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> {{indirect}} evidence {{of life in}} the past, such as the footprints, tracks, burrows, borings, and feces left behind by animals, rather than the preserved remains of the body of the actual animal itself.

25|$|The idea of {{evolutionary}} suicide, where adaptation {{at the level}} of the individual causes the whole species or population to be driven extinct, can be seen as an extreme form of an evolutionary tragedy of the commons. From an evolutionary point of view, the creation of the tragedy of the commons in pathogenic microbes may <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> advanced therapeutic methods.|$|E
25|$|For example, when we combine both concepts, we can intuit {{that the}} number three is prime {{and that it is}} greater than two. We then deduce from this {{knowledge}} that there is a prime number greater than two. Thus, {{it can be said that}} intuition and deduction combined to <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> a priori knowledge – we gained this knowledge independently of sense experience.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{representations of}} culture in Anatolia were Stone Age artifacts. The remnants of Bronze Age civilizations such as the Hattian, Akkadian, Assyrian, and Hittite peoples <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> many examples of {{the daily lives of}} its citizens and their trade. After the fall of the Hittites, the new states of Phrygia and Lydia stood strong on the western coast as Greek civilization began to flourish. They, {{and all the rest of}} Anatolia were relatively soon after incorporated into the Achaemenid Persian Empire.|$|E

25|$|Wittgenstein {{rejects the}} idea that ostensive {{definitions}} can <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> {{the meaning of a}} word. For Wittgenstein, the thing that the word stands for does not give the meaning of the word. Wittgenstein argues for this making a series of moves to show that to understand an ostensive definition presupposes an understanding of the way the word being defined is used. So, for instance, there is no difference between pointing to a piece of paper, to its colour, or to its shape; but understanding the difference is crucial to using the paper in an ostensive definition of a shape or of a colour.|$|E
25|$|The {{classification}} {{of the many}} types of different igneous rocks can <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> important information about {{the conditions under which}} they formed. Two important variables used for the {{classification of}} igneous rocks are particle size, which largely depends on the cooling history, and the mineral composition of the rock. Feldspars, quartz or feldspathoids, olivines, pyroxenes, amphiboles, and micas are all important minerals in the formation of almost all igneous rocks, and they are basic to the classification of these rocks. All other minerals present are regarded as nonessential in almost all igneous rocks and are called accessory minerals. Types of igneous rocks with other essential minerals are very rare, and these rare rocks include those with essential carbonates.|$|E
25|$|The {{earliest}} {{representations of}} culture in Anatolia {{can be found in}} several archaeological sites located in the central and eastern part of the region. Stone Age artifacts such as animal bones and food fossils were found at Burdur (north of Antalya). Although the origins of some of the earliest peoples are shrouded in mystery, the remnants of Bronze Age civilizations such as the Hattian, Akkadian, Assyrian, and Hittite peoples <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> many examples of the daily lives of its citizens and their trade. After the fall of the Hittites, the new states of Phrygia and Lydia stood strong on the western coast as Greek civilization began to flourish. Only the threat from a distant Persian kingdom prevented them from advancing past their peak of success.|$|E

25|$|The Innate Knowledge {{thesis is}} similar to the Intuition/Deduction thesis in the regard that both theses claim {{knowledge}} is gained a priori. The two theses go their separate ways when describing how that knowledge is gained. As the name, and the rationale, suggests, the Innate Knowledge thesis claims knowledge is simply part of our rational nature. Experiences can trigger a process that allows this knowledge to come into our consciousness, but the experiences don't <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> the knowledge itself. The knowledge has been with us since the beginning and the experience simply brought into focus, in the same way a photographer can bring the background of a picture into focus by changing the aperture of the lens. The background was always there, just not in focus.|$|E
25|$|The {{subject-matter}} of Cham inscriptions {{is mostly}} political and religious. They are written {{from the perspective}} of kings or very high potentates seeking to affirm their legitimacy and their relationship to the divine. Many of the inscriptions document a gift to a god, such as a gift of land, of people, or of treasure, or a foundation dedicated to a god, such as the foundation of a temple, an altar, or a pedestal. The inscriptions also <b>provide</b> <b>us</b> <b>with</b> important information such as the name of the country (typically Campadesa in the Sanskrit inscriptions, nagara Campa in the Cham inscriptions), and the names of some of its most important cities: Simhapura ("Lion City"), Virapura ("Knight City"), Rajapura ("King City"), Vijaya ("District"). Finally, a number of the inscriptions allude to or describe interesting historical events, such as the ongoing wars between Champa and Cambodia in the 12th century.|$|E
