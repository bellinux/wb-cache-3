5|$|Structure 4 is the North Structure. It {{dates to}} the Late Classic but overlies {{construction}} dating to the Middle Preclassic. A stairway ascended {{the front of the}} building, under which were found the remains of Late Classic polychrome ceramics, perhaps belonging to a <b>pre-construction</b> ritual offering. The stucco floors on top of the mound supported asymmetric walls that perhaps date to the Postclassic Period, being associated with a mix of Late Classic and Postclassic pottery.|$|E
5|$|The MBTA begin soliciting {{bids for}} <b>pre-construction</b> site {{preparation}} for the station and the associated layover yard in June 2012. A $3.75 million contract was awarded and notice to proceed given on November 26, 2012. Site preparation work began in early December. Bidding on a nominally-$27.592 million contract for the primary station and layover yard construction opened in February 2013. Bids came in lower than expected; a $22.9 million contract was awarded on May 22, 2013, for construction {{to be completed by}} the end of 2014. Track and signal work and bridge repairs were placed in separate contracts.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of December 1998, a newspaper reported that the Federal Ministry of Transport had issued an order to stop work on {{the southern part of}} the new line so that the work program could be examined. The northern section that was being built along with the A71 was not affected. After the Federal Ministry of Transport initially stopped <b>pre-construction</b> activities in July 1999 as a result of tight budgets, some work, mainly consisting of <b>pre-construction</b> work, was carried out in 2003 and 2004.|$|E

25|$|Phase {{two will}} be rolled out between 2018–2027, and it {{includes}} {{the construction of the}} Broadway SkyTrain extension, the construction of the Surrey–Newton–Guilford LRT, the launch of two more B-Lines, the replacement of the Pattullo Bridge, <b>pre-construction</b> of the Surrey–Langley LRT, and more rail and station upgrades on the existing SkyTrain network. It also includes continued service improvements on buses and HandyDART, and continued funding for improved roads, cycling paths, and sidewalks.|$|E
25|$|In either {{direction}} the driving {{experience has been}} greatly improved. In addition to the wider lanes of traffic in each direction, {{there is now a}} continuous lane for emergency or disabled vehicles {{on each side of the}} five traffic lanes. The bridge night lighting is now glare free and new white LED lighting has been installed in the lower, eastbound tunnel section. The removal of sharp curves east of the tunnel has encouraged a smoother eastbound traffic flow west of, and through the tunnel, even when compared to the <b>pre-construction</b> configuration.|$|E
25|$|In mid-2013, the MBTA {{awarded a}} {{construction}} manager-general contractor contract to White Skanska Kiewit (WSK), {{a joint venture}} of J. F. White Contracting Co., Skanska USA Civil Northeast and Kiewit Infrastructure. WSK {{is responsible for the}} primary construction work for Phases 2/2A, 3, and 4. Notice to proceed for Phase 2 <b>pre-construction</b> was given on July 19, 2013. On September 25, 2013, the MassDOT board approved a $393M, three-year contract with WSK for Phase 2 construction, with funds from the transportation bill passed earlier that year. The state intends to seek $557M in federal New Starts money for Phases 3 and 4.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pre-construction</b> {{work began}} {{in the spring and}} summer of 2006 with the {{demolition}} of old buildings and the removal of vegetation. The symbolic ground-breaking ceremony was scheduled for 16 January 2007 but it had to be postponed. Construction started with the building of a bridge for Kynaststraße, running to the east of the station over the railway tracks. In February 2008, a temporary pedestrian bridge was installed connecting the entrances of the station with platforms D and E. It replaced the old heritage-listed bridge, which had to be demolished for the construction, but will be faithfully recreated after the completion of the railway station.|$|E
25|$|The {{hydropower}} {{sector is}} one of the main pillars of bilateral co-operation, exemplifying mutually beneficial synergy by providing clean energy to India and exports revenue to Bhutan (power contributes 14% to the Bhutanese GDP, comprising about 35% of Bhutan's total exports). Three hydroelectric projects (HEPs) totalling 1416 MW, (336 MW Chukha HEP, the 60 MW Kurichu HEP, and the 1020 MW Tala HEP), are already exporting electricity to India. In 2008 the two governments identified ten more projects for development with a total generation capacity of 10,000 MW. Of these, three projects totalling 2940 MW (1200 MW Punatsangchu-I, 1020 MW Punatsangchu-II and 720 MW Mangdechu HEPs) are under construction and are scheduled to be commissioned in the last quarter of 2017–2018. Out of the remaining 7 HEPs, 4 projects totalling 2120 MW (600 MW Kholongchhu, 180 MW Bunakha, 570 MW Wangchu and 770 MW Chamkarchu) will be constructed under Joint Venture model, for which a Framework Inter-Governmental Agreement was signed between both governments in 2014. Of these 4 JV-model projects, <b>pre-construction</b> activities for Kholongchhu HEP have commenced. /mea.gov.in/Portal/ForeignRelation/Bilateral_Briefs_of_Bhutan.pdf> Tata Power is also building a hydro-electric dam in Bhutan.|$|E
25|$|The Draft Environmental Impact Study (DEIS) for {{the project}} was issued in June 2017. Four {{alternatives}} for alignments under the Hudson River and the Palisades. Option 1 would have the new tunnels run close to the existing tunnels with a ventilation site near the Lincoln Tunnel Helix. This option would have required a construction staging site within the Lincoln Tunnel Helix, thus displacing New Jersey Transit's Weehawken bus storage site, which would {{have a negative impact}} on the operation of buses to the Port Authority Bus Terminal. Option 2 would have the new tunnels run further south than the first option, with a shaft site north of 19th Street near JFK Boulevard East. This option would require the acquisition and demolition of an existing multi-story office building to build the shaft site. The third option would be further south with a shaft site south of 19th Street. This option would preclude the development of a portion of a planned residential development under construction at 800 Harbor Boulevard. The fourth option would be further south with a shaft site south of 18th Street–following the same horizontal alignment identified in the ARC FEIS. Alignment Option 4 was chosen for the build alternative even though it would have a slightly longer tunnel than in the other alternatives. Because of the additional length, there would be additional tunneling costs for this option. However, the first three options have greater <b>pre-construction</b> risks, meaning that if construction was delayed the cost difference would be minimized. In addition, Option 4 does not have the issues that the first three options have.|$|E

500|$|As the Auburn Dam {{proposal}} evolved, {{the project}} {{transformed from a}} primary flood-control structure to a multipurpose high dam that would serve various other purposes including long-term water storage, hydroelectricity generation, and recreation. One of the first ideas, publicized in the late 1950s, called for a [...] embankment dam impounding [...] of water. In 1963, a [...] earthfill dam holding back [...] of water was proposed. The <b>pre-construction</b> design was finalized in 1967, for a concrete thin-arch gravity structure over [...] high. This dam would be [...] long, [...] thick at the base, and equipped with five 150 megawatt generators at its base for a total generating capacity of 700 megawatts. Two concrete-lined flip bucket spillways would abut {{both sides of the}} dam. With the initial plans set and the project authorized, construction work for the dam started in late 1968.|$|E
