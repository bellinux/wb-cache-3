50|$|Butterly House is a six roomed Victorian Georgian styled dwelling. It has a U-shaped hipped roof, {{originally}} shingled and now corrugated iron, with symmetrically <b>placed</b> <b>brick</b> chimneys, and is {{encircled by}} a hipped bullnosed iron verandah with simple timber columns. Brickwork is in Flemish bond, the earliest surviving {{example of this}} type in Toodyay. It has a symmetrical facade with centrally placed panelled door and French windows opening onto the verandah.|$|R
50|$|The building’s {{exterior}} and interior walls are entirely made of brick, including the columns. With {{the exception of the}} brick along the portico, which is covered with stucco, the rest of the exterior brick is exposed.

The house is topped by a low-pitched hip roof with architectural slate shingles and four symmetrically <b>placed</b> <b>brick</b> chimneys.|$|R
50|$|Ward Family House is a {{historic}} home located near Sugar Grove, Watauga County, North Carolina. It was built about 1897, and is a two-story, Queen Anne style frame dwelling.

5|$|The Wallace Floyd Design Group was {{responsible}} for the station's architecture. Groundbreaking was held in August 2002; completion was originally scheduled within a year but delayed due to an unusually cold winter and the primary steel supplier going bankrupt. The station officially opened on November 22, 2004. Olver and Senator Edward Kennedy <b>placed</b> <b>bricks</b> from the 1914 Union Station into the columns of the new station. The building was named after Joseph Scelsi for his activism regarding Union Station.|$|R
50|$|During the Harvard trials, {{groups of}} termite-inspired robots {{constructed}} structures by stigmergy. That is, instead of directly communicating with each other, the robots detected features {{of their environment}} and followed simple rules for moving and <b>placing</b> <b>bricks</b> {{in response to the}} configuration of bricks that existed at a given time. The rules for constructing a given structure were designed to guarantee that different structures emerged depending on the number of robots involved and on the initial placement of bricks.|$|R

5|$|As far {{as can be}} determined, between arches 2 to 21, {{the outer}} facing of the {{superstructure}} consists of four layers of brick, followed by layers of rough stonemasonry bound with mortar. In contrast, between arches 22 and 26, {{as well as in}} both ramps on either end, the facing consists of ashlar blocks. The two repaired arches 27a and 27b are differentiated from the earlier work through the use of smaller unworked stones and the incorporation of irregularly <b>placed</b> <b>brick</b> tiles. In arch 26, the lower side of the arch still features a projecting bearing used for the placement of the falsework.|$|R

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{familiar}} brand names {{in the world of}} toys is Lego TM; the name immediately brings interlocking building blocks to mind. Interlocking blocks fit together in restricted ways. Typically, a block of order q (length q + 1) has q + 1 protrusions on its top and q + 1 indentations on its bottom, so that the indentations on the bottom of one block can lock on to the protrusions on the top of another. Here q is a positive integer, and the width and height of a block are unimportant. For q = 1 and q = 2, Figure 1 shows the q ways in which one block can sit on top of two others. Figure 1. Bricks of length q + 1, for q = 1 and q = 2. In this paper, we solve a counting problem about building stacks of such blocks, which we call bricks. We have a linear base of length m on which we can <b>place</b> <b>bricks.</b> The bricks sitting directly on the base can start at any integer position, as long as they fit on the base and don’t overlap. When two bricks are contiguous, sharing a common end, we can <b>place</b> another <b>brick</b> on top of them. Since we want the blocks to interlock, it must cover part of each brick below it. The protrusions and indentations then restrict it to q possible positions, covering a positive integer amount of each brick it rests on. Again bricks cannot overlap. We call a configuration built by these rules a q-stack...|$|R

His proud father, Lord Canterville (Reginald Owen), refuses to acknowledge that his son has disgraced the family name, even when shown in front of witnesses where Simon is cowering.

50|$|Construction work on {{it began}} in 1951, with {{completion}} and formal opening on 4 October 1957. It was of 240 MW generating capacity, comprising four 60 MW British Thomson-Houston turbo alternators. These were initially rated at 65 MW, but later at 60 MW. Steam was provided by four Babcock & Wilcox boilers. These fed steam at 515,000 lbs per hour, with a steam temperature of 1,065 °F (566 °C) and 1,500 psi operating pressure. The station {{was built on the}} 'unit' or 'set' principle where one boiler fed one turbo alternator. It had one centrally <b>placed,</b> <b>brick</b> built chimney, which stood at 408 ft tall. System water was cooled by three 250 ft tall cooling towers. The station was of brick cladding construction over a steel frame, which supported the four boilers from the roof. Its design efficiency was 31.41%.|$|R

25|$|Thirteen steel columns, {{arranged}} in a circle {{in the center of}} the building, support the dome overhead. The columns are irregularly spaced to accommodate building's site and avoid blocking entrances. Horizontal steel beams run outward from these columns to the outer walls, supporting the upper floors. Each of the columns was coated in a thick layer of plaster, with vertical conduits and air ducts embedded and hidden in the plaster. On the first floor, the plaster-coasted columns were clad in marble, but merely painted on the second and third floors. Each of the upper floors was constructed with a concrete base, on top of which were <b>placed</b> <b>brick</b> and red tile arched supports. A wood floor was constructed atop the arched supports, and in parts of the second floor marble tile was laid atop the wood flooring. Intricate embossed bronze brackets supported the second-floor balcony. The first floor ceiling, formed by the second floor balcony, was decorated with highly detailed bronze coffers.|$|R

Police responded with tear gas and non-lethal weapons. In the evening fires were started and looting began. [...] Both the MPRP headquarters and the Central Cultural Palace Building (which houses the National Art Gallery of Mongolia) were set fire by the crowd, estimated to be in the thousands. Art from the gallery (more than 1,000 pieces) were either [...] "destroyed, damaged or looted". [...] In search for weapons a police station was attacked.

5000|$|Throughout the game, {{the player}} can unlock various brick sets and {{character}} pieces by completing certain tasks, such as coming {{first in a}} Circuit Race. The game's [...] "Build Menu" [...] allows the player to build custom cars, minifigures and driving licenses of their own design using unlocked bricks and character parts. Minifigures can be customized with different hat, hair, head, body and leg parts, and given a name entered by the player on the minifigure's driving license. A picture of the player's minifigure is also placed on their driving license, and their facial expression can be changed by the player. The player can create a custom car {{using a combination of}} different chassis and car sets. The player can rotate, move and <b>place</b> <b>bricks</b> from these sets directly on to the chassis. Placement of the bricks changes the car's balance and weight, which affects its overall performance. The [...] "Mix" [...] and [...] "Quick Build" [...] option creates minifigures and cars from randomly selected parts, respectively.|$|R
