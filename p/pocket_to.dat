5|$|Then {{suddenly}} he faltered—and the disturbing truth became obvious. He wasn't reading his address at all. He had learned it by heart. To refresh his memory {{he brought the}} paper {{closer and closer to}} his eyes. When it was only an inch or so away he still couldn't read it, and had to fish for a magnifying glass in his <b>pocket</b> <b>to</b> make the typing visible to him. It was an agonizing moment.|$|E
5|$|The corps {{was moved}} to the northeastern sector of the <b>pocket</b> <b>to</b> attack towards Dukhovshchina with orders to keep the Solovevo {{corridor}} open. On 26 July it was reported to have 58 tanks left. The 1st Motor Rifle Division was attached to the corps in the Smolensk Pocket by 1 August. On the night of 31 July to 1 August, the corps escaped the Smolensk Pocket through a gap in the German encirclement. Corps deputy commander Major General Yevgeny Zhuravlev took command after Alekseyenko died of wounds on 2 August.|$|E

5|$|Regardless of {{the limited}} scope of Operation Summer '95, the Split Agreement became a {{fundamental}} instrument to change the overall strategic situation in Bosnia and Herzegovina where Bosnian Serbs had had the upper hand {{since the beginning of}} the Bosnian war, as well as in Croatia, where the front lines had been largely static since the 1992 Sarajevo armistice. As Operation Summer '95 concluded, the RSK and Republika Srpska changed their priority from smashing the Bihać <b>pocket</b> <b>to</b> fending off a possible Croatian offensive to capture Knin (advancing from the recently gained territory in Bosnia and Herzegovina). RSK leaders Milan Martić and Mile Mrkšić agreed with UN Special Representative Yasushi Akashi to withdraw from the Bihać area on 30 July, hoping the move would contribute to averting the Croatian attack. Albeit, the attack materialized days later as Operation Storm, a decisive victory to the HV in the Croatian War of Independence.|$|E
5|$|Suzy Turquoise Blue {{arrives and}} takes the <b>pocket</b> <b>to</b> the House. There, she finds Arthur and Fred, and joins them in a raid led by Sir Thursday to find and destroy the New Nithlings' weapon, which is {{preventing}} the mechanical floor of the Great Maze from shifting. Arthur destroys the weapon by throwing the pocket into it, simultaneously destroying the Skinless Boy. As Arthur escapes from the Piper with Sir Thursday, he distracts Thursday enough for the fourth part of the Will, a snake embodying the virtue of justice, to break free, whereupon it makes Arthur the Bearer of the Fourth Key – a sword or baton depending {{on whether or not}} the wielder is in combat – and Commander of the Glorious Army of the Architect. With help from Dame Primus and others from the lower demesnes, Arthur defeats the New Nithling army.|$|E
5|$|The HV Zagreb Corps, {{assigned}} the Storm-1 plan, initially commanded by Major General Ivan Basarac, {{on the left}} flank of the Karlovac Corps, was deployed on three main axes of attacktowards Glina, Petrinja and Hrvatska Kostajnica. It was opposed by the ARSK 39th Banija Corps, headquartered in Glina and commanded by Major General Slobodan Tarbuk. The Zagreb Corps was tasked with bypassing Petrinja to neutralize ARSK artillery and missiles potentially targeting Croatian cities, making a secondary thrust from Sunja towards Hrvatska Kostajnica. Their secondary mission was compromised when a battalion of the special police and the 81st Guards Battalion planned to spearhead the advance were deployed elsewhere forcing modifications to the plan. The Zagreb Corps was composed of 30,000 troops, while the ARSK had 9,000 facing them and about 1,000 ARBiH troops in the Bihać <b>pocket</b> <b>to</b> their rear. At the start of Operation Storm, about 3,500 ARSK troops were {{in contact with the}} ARBiH. HV Bjelovar Corps, on the left flank of the Zagreb Corps, covering the area along the Una River, had a forward command post in Novska. The corps was commanded by Major General Luka Džanko. Opposite the Bjelovar Corps {{was a part of the}} ARSK Banija Corps. The Bjelovar Corps was included in the attack on 2 August and were therefore not issued a separate operations plan.|$|E

Tanio missed on a bank shot but the ball sank on an unintended <b>pocket</b> <b>to</b> reach the hill first; Akakariyama broke and ran out to tie the match for the last time. Tanio {{was on his way}} on a break and run out when he had faced a difficult shot on the 8-ball. He sank the 8-ball but then faced on another difficult shot on the 9-ball. Tanio missed and Akakariyama faced on a table's length shot on the 9-ball. Akakariyama took over ten minutes to study the shot before shooting it on a rail to the <b>pocket</b> <b>to</b> clinch a semifinals berth.|$|E

New management came in at the studio which was unenthusiastic about the picture but because Boone had a pay or play deal, they decided to make it anyway, only with a much shorter budget. Boone even paid some money out of his own <b>pocket</b> <b>to</b> help complete it.|$|E

Despite the fierceness of the fighting around Maubeuge, casualties on both sides were light. The delay allowed {{a significant portion of}} the 84th RIF to escape to the Dunkirk <b>pocket</b> <b>to</b> be evacuated to England, while the 87th RIF escaped to Normandy to be captured weeks later.|$|E

25|$|The {{earthquake}} of 1908, {{which killed}} 60,000 people in Messina, later affected {{the club in}} a large manner; deaths included Charles Bousfield Huleatt, players Frank John Carter, Walter Oates and financial backer George H.

Football resumed in Messina during the following year, thanks largely to Arthur Barret Lascelles who used money from his own <b>pocket</b> <b>to</b> ensure football activity in the city would continue. By 1910 the funds of Barret had dried up and the club was folded, Società Ginnastica Garibaldi Messina (Gymnastic Society Garibaldi Messina) briefly took its place until it too was dissolved due to the First World War.|$|E
25|$|A jockstrap (also {{known as}} a jock, jock strap, strap, supporter, or {{athletic}} supporter) is an undergarment for supporting the male genitalia during cycling, contact sports or other vigorous physical activity. A jockstrap consists of a waistband (usually elastic) with a support pouch for the genitalia and two elastic straps affixed {{to the base of}} the pouch and to the left and right sides of the waistband at the hip. The pouch, in some varieties, may be fitted with a <b>pocket</b> <b>to</b> hold an abdominal guard (impact resistant cup, box) to protect the testicles and the penis from injury.|$|E
25|$|Another {{characteristic}} of frock coats was {{their lack of}} any outer pockets. Only late in the Victorian and Edwardian era were they ever made with a chest <b>pocket</b> <b>to</b> sport a pocket square, a feature more typical of the modern lounge suit. Oscar Wilde, a famous dandy of his time, was often seen in portraits wearing just such a model, but this was rather rare on frock coats; while {{in keeping with the}} flamboyant nature of Wilde's dress, it was frowned upon by traditionalists. Side pockets were always absent from frock coats, but pockets were provided {{on the inside of the}} chest.|$|E
