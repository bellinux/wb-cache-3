5000|$|Longer spokes and {{decreased}} angle between <b>hub</b> <b>flange</b> and rim {{result in a}} more laterally flexible wheel (ceteris paribus).|$|R
5000|$|The <b>hub</b> <b>flanges</b> {{of modern}} tension-spoked bicycle wheels are always spaced wider than where the spokes {{attach to the}} rim. When viewed in cross section, the spokes and hub form a triangle, a {{structure}} that is stiff both vertically and laterally. In three dimensions, if the spokes were covered, they would form two cones or [...] "dishes". The greater the separation between the <b>hub</b> <b>flanges,</b> the deeper the dishes, and the stiffer and stronger the wheel can be laterally. The more vertical the spokes, the shallower the dish, and the less stiff the wheel will be laterally.|$|R
5000|$|The {{most common}} spoking pattern is [...] "three-cross" [...] where each spoke crosses three {{others on the}} same <b>flange</b> of the <b>hub</b> before meeting the rim. The last cross is {{normally}} [...] "interlaced" [...] by wrapping the spoke around the {{one from the other}} side of the flange. Radial-spoked wheels, where the spokes do not cross each other, saves roughly the weight of two spokes (because the spokes are shorter) compared to a three-cross wheel but run an increased risk of cracking at the <b>hub</b> <b>flange,</b> unless the <b>hub</b> is specifically designed for this pattern. Two-cross is sometimes used for <b>hubs</b> with large-diameter <b>flanges</b> (such as generator/dynamo <b>hubs</b> or large <b>flange</b> <b>hubs),</b> as it gives a more perpendicular spoke/rim angle, and four-cross is standard for spoke counts of 40 and above.|$|R
5000|$|Disc brakes {{require a}} hub built {{to accept the}} disc, and a fork (for front brakes) or frame (for rear brakes) built to accept the caliper. Front hubs {{designed}} for discs often move the left <b>hub's</b> <b>flange</b> inward {{to make room for}} the disc, which causes the wheel to be dished. A dished wheel is laterally weaker when forced to the non-disc side. Other <b>hubs</b> use conventional <b>flange</b> spacing and provide a wheel without dish, but require a less common wide-spaced fork.|$|R
5000|$|The {{dishes on}} each side of a wheel are not always equal. The cogset (freewheel or cassette) of a rear wheel and disc brake rotors, if installed, takes up width on the hub, and so the flanges may not be located symmetrically about the center plane of the hub or the bike. Since the rim must be centered, but the <b>hub</b> <b>flanges</b> are not, there is a {{difference}} in dish between the two sides. Such an asymmetrical wheel is called a [...] "dished" [...] wheel. The side of the wheel with less dish has slightly shorter but significantly higher-tensioned spokes than the side with more dish. Several different techniques have been tried to minimize this spoke asymmetry. In addition to modified hub geometry, some rims have off-center spoke holes, and the mounting of common J-bend spokes at the <b>hub</b> <b>flange</b> can be altered [...] "inboard" [...] or [...] "outboard".|$|R
5000|$|Several factors affect these {{stiffnesses}} {{to varying}} degrees. These include wheel radius, rim bending and torsional stiffness, number of spokes, spoke gauge, lacing pattern, <b>hub</b> stiffness, <b>hub</b> <b>flange</b> spacing, <b>hub</b> radius. In general lateral and radial stiffness decreases {{with the number}} of spoke crossings and torsional stiffness increases {{with the number of}} spoke crossings. One factor that has little influence on these stiffnesses is spoke tension.|$|R
5000|$|The dish of a wheel {{measures}} {{the amount of}} asymmetry between the rim and the <b>hub</b> <b>flanges.</b> To accommodate a large cassette, more space is needed on the drive side of the axle; this increases the complexity of manufacturing and truing the wheel. Tandem rear wheels tend to run a wider hub/axle to allow the right-side <b>hub</b> <b>flange</b> to be further right of wheel center and thus reduce the total dish of the wheel. Some modern tandems use a 160mm wide axle which allows a wheel that is completely [...] "dishless" [...] (i.e. symmetric). The disadvantage is this may increase the Q-factor of the stoker's cranks and may also cause [...] "heel-strike" [...] of the stoker's shoes on the chain stays. Others use shorter axles (often 145mm wide) thereby trading a little decrease in {{the strength of the}} wheel for the advantage of a similar decrease in the bending moment of the axle spindle. Rear hubs may also be threaded on the left side to allow the use of a drum brake.|$|R
50|$|Over time, {{the number}} of {{sprockets}} in a cogset has increased, from three or four before World War II, to five used from the 1950s to the 1970s, up to the eight, nine, ten, eleven, or twelve now found on modern bikes. As more rear sprockets were added, the combination became wider, and the sprocket spacing narrower. One {{of the ways to}} make space for this was the axle length (measured as the Over Locknut Distance â€” O.L.D.) was increased, necessitating more dish on the rear wheel drive side with a threaded hub to centre the wheel in the frame. The <b>hub</b> <b>flanges</b> spacing was not shortened on threaded hubs, rather the axle length increased from 120 mm O.L.D. (five-speed/compact six) to 126 mm O.L.D. (six-speed/compact seven) through to 130 mm O.L.D. (threaded seven-speed) for a road bike. MTB rear spacing is normally 135 mm O.L.D. Another advantage of the Shimano cassette hubs introduced from 1978 was that the rear <b>hub</b> <b>flanges</b> were wider apart than those of a threaded hub, so built a stronger wheel with less dish and without the problem of increased bearing stress or axle failure.|$|R

Using wording from the National Highway Traffic and Safety Administration, Tesla told customers that without this adjustment, the driver could lose control of the car.

50|$|A {{weld neck}} flange (also known as a high-hub <b>flange</b> and tapered <b>hub</b> <b>flange)</b> {{is a type of}} flange. There are two designs. The regular type is used with pipes. The long type is {{unsuitable}} for pipes and is used in process plant. A {{weld neck flange}} consists of a circular fitting with a protruding rim around the circumference. Generally machined from a forging, these flanges are typically butt welded to a pipe. The rim has a series of drilled holes that permit the flange to be affixed to another flange with bolts.|$|R
50|$|The {{correct length}} of spokes {{required}} {{can be calculated}} using rim diameter, <b>hub</b> <b>flange</b> diameter, <b>hub</b> width, lacing pattern, and number of spokes. See and. These calculations can be done either by hand (the old-fashioned way - with a pen, paper and calculator) or by using a computer. There are many programs available and they range in complexity from simple Excel spreadsheets to stand alone desktop applications and web based calculators. An alternative method is {{to refer to a}} table which has the spoke lengths for a number of common hub and rim combinations.|$|R
5000|$|The wheelwright {{must ensure}} that the wheel is true in two ways: lateral (sideways wobble) and radial (roundness/hop). The wheel {{also needs to be}} {{properly}} dished if applicable (the left and right sides of the rear wheel differ, the drive-side spokes requiring higher tension). Spokes should have no residual twist (windup) from tightening the nipples. The spokes may be [...] "stress relieved", i.e. subjected to a greater tension during building than they are ever likely to encounter in use - usually by squeezing pairs of spokes together very hard. This 'yields' the spokes (and/or the hub) into a permanent shape where they bend around the <b>hub</b> <b>flanges</b> and each other.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{introduction}} of indexed shifting, {{the width of a}} five-speed or compact six freewheel was approximately 32 mm; {{the introduction}} of indexed shifting supposedly made standardized sprocket spacing necessary. Shimano and Campagnolo both came up with independent standards, and SRAM later followed Shimano's lead in respect to sprocket spacing and cassette width. The width of early Shimano six- and seven-speed cassettes was 36 mm, and early eight-speed 40 mm wide. Shimano then changed again and standardised eight-eleven speed cassettes on 41.5 mm and second generation seven-speed to 38 mm. The widening of the sprocket carrier on the cassette hubs to 41.5 mm resulted in a decrease in the distance between the <b>hub</b> <b>flanges.</b>|$|R
50|$|Subsea {{trees are}} {{available}} in either vertical or horizontal configurations with further speciality available such as dual bore, monobore, concentric, drill-through, mudline, guidlineless or guideline. Subsea trees may range in size and weight from a few tons to approximately 70 tons for high pressure, deepwater (>3000 feet) guidelineless applications. Subsea trees contain many additional valves and accessories compared to Surface trees. Typically a subsea tree would have a choke (permits control of flow), a flowline connection interface (<b>hub,</b> <b>flange</b> or other connection), subsea control interface (direct hydraulic, electro hydraulic, or electric) and sensors for gathering data such as pressure, temperature, sand flow, erosion, multiPhase flow, single phase flow such as water or gas.|$|R
5000|$|This {{progression}} {{has provided}} more fine adjustment of gear ratio, however {{the use of}} thinner metal parts has {{had the effect of}} shortening the life-span of the chain and sprockets due to so called [...] "stretching" [...] of the chain. This is caused by frictional abrasion of the load-bearing surfaces of the chain causing elongation. As such, the chain and sprockets of a nine-speed system require more frequent replacement than an eight. The narrowing of the <b>hub</b> <b>flanges</b> has created more dish in the wheel, which weakens the wheel if all other factors are the same, but improvements in the strength and reliability of spokes and rims has more than balanced this out, and wheel strength is generally higher despite the increased dish.|$|R
5000|$|Motorcycle [...] wire wheels {{typically}} use 36 or 40 spokes, of much heavier gauge {{than those}} on a bicycle. They are never [...] "interlaced" [...] in the manner described above, nor are [...] "radial" [...] builds recommended (only wheels without brakes). Motorcycle rims are dimpled toward the hub at each spoke location, and the holes for the spokes are drilled into the dimples at an angle. This angle {{is a function of}} the cross-pattern used to lace the wheel, the diameter of the <b>hub</b> <b>flanges,</b> and the width of the <b>hub</b> at the <b>flanges.</b> Conical-hub wheels have a different angle drilled into one side of the rim when compared with the other side. Adequate spoke tension is very important with motorcycle wheels, because of the greater torque applied to the wheel by an engine or disc brake. Loose spokes on a wheel fatigue rapidly and break, usually at the bend where they attach to the hub. When this happens, the wheel must be rebuilt using all new spokes, because even unbroken spokes in such a wheel are fatigued, and will usually break when tightened during the truing operation.|$|R
5000|$|Wheels {{that are}} not {{required}} to transfer any significant amount of torque from the hub to the rim are often laced radially. Here, the spokes leave the hub at perpendicular to the axle and go straight to the rim, without crossing any other spokes - e.g., [...] "cross-0". This lacing pattern can not transfer torque as efficiently as tangential lacing. Thus it is generally preferred to build a crossed-spoke wheel where braking and drive forces are present. Hubs that have previously been laced in any other pattern should not be used for radial lacing, as the pits and dents created by the spokes can be the weak points along which the <b>hub</b> <b>flange</b> may break. This is not always the case: for example if the hub used has harder, steel flanges like those on a vintage bicycle.|$|R
40|$|A failed Johnson {{screen was}} sent to the {{laboratory}} for analysis. The screen was found to have failed at the <b>flange</b> <b>hub</b> â€“ screen joint. Analysis showed that the failure was due to inadequate welding of the <b>flange</b> <b>hub</b> with the ribs/stiffeners of the screen. The failure was by sudden overload. There were no indications of delayed failure like fatigue or stress corrosion cracking. Semi-quantitative analysis by EDX showed that the helical coil of the screen was made of SS 304 steel while the ribs/stiffener were made of SS 316 steel...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{the long}} history of bicycle wheels, there has been very few design changes because the current design is known to work. This study aimed to develop a method to provide {{optimised}} spoking geometries for rear bicycle wheels. MATLABÂ® was used to optimise the spoke geometries based on the best combination of torsional and lateral stiffness. The developed script can be easily adapted to calculate the optimised geometry for any wheel with tensioned spokes. The load responses of the optimised wheels were then compared with conventional 2 X and 3 X spoke patterns and three commercially available wheels using ANSYSÂ® FEA software. When the optimised geometries were simulated in ANSYSÂ® under torsional, radial and lateral loads, their performance was better than the conventionally spoked and commercial wheels that had similar specifications. These results confirmed that wheel design can be improved. The recommended guidelines produced in this study only apply to the wheel geometries contain herein, as certain limits were imposed on the <b>hub</b> <b>flange</b> radius and the spoke diameters. Limitations on the use of existing theoretical models have also been identified. ...|$|R

The major components developed were rotor blades, teetered hub, rotor shaft, platform and yaw system whereas gear box and alternator were procured. Several configurations were initially explored for each subsystem and finally the suitable one for a prototype was fabricated. The wind turbine developed composed of minimum elementary systems required for prototype testing. The design has been rationalized/ simplified for single set/piece fabrication. The aerodynamic design of the blade {{was carried out in}} a separate exercise and the aerodynamic loads obtained were used for this structural analysis. Further, a special purpose code, â€œBLADEDâ€™ was used to generate aerodynamic loads for some cases. The critical loads in all phases of wind turbine existence were identified and used in the design. The blade apart from generating power is the source from where all the dynamic loads originates. The blade shell was made out of glass-epoxy laminates. The load carrying spar integrated with the shell of the blade composed of more UD layers. Foam sandwich construction was employed in non-critical area. The blade was attached to the <b>hub</b> <b>flange</b> with use of T-Bolts embedded into the root. Preload was introduced into the T-Bolt to improve itâ€™s the fatigue life.

50|$|The spool is {{the storage}} {{area for the}} line. It has a <b>hub</b> and two <b>flanges,</b> which prevent the line from falling off {{the sides of the}} hub. The size of the spool and the {{thickness}} of the line together determine the length of line the reel can hold, though this is also affected by how neatly the line is wound onto the spool.|$|R
5000|$|Lacing is {{the process}} of {{threading}} spokes through holes in the hub and rim so that they form a spoke pattern. While most manufacturers use the same lacing pattern on both left and right sides of a wheel, it is becoming increasingly common to find specialty wheels with different lacing patterns on each side. A spoke can connect the hub to the rim in a radial fashion, which creates the lightest and most aerodynamic wheel. However, to efficiently transfer torque from the hub to the rim, as with driven wheels or wheels with drum or disc brakes, durability dictates that spokes be mounted at an angle to the <b>hub</b> <b>flange</b> up to a [...] "tangential lacing pattern" [...] to achieve maximum torque capability (but minimum vertical wheel stiffness). Names for various lacing patterns are commonly referenced to the number of spokes that any one spoke crosses. Conventionally laced 36- or 32-spoke wheels are most commonly built as a cross-3 or a cross-2, however other cross-numbers are also possible. The angle at which the spoke interfaces the hub is not solely determined by the cross-number; as spoke count and hub diameter will lead to significantly different spoke angles. For all common tension-spoke wheels with crossed spokes, a torque applied to the hub will result in one half of the spokes - called [...] "leading spokes" [...] tensioned to drive the rim, while other half - [...] "trailing spokes" [...] are tensioned only to counteract the leading spokes. When forward torque is applied (i.e., during acceleration [...] ), the trailing spokes experience a higher tension, while leading spokes are relieved, thus forcing the rim to rotate. While braking, leading spokes tighten and trailing spokes are relieved. The wheel can thus transfer the hub torque in either direction with the least amount of change in spoke tension, allowing the wheel to stay true while torque is applied.|$|R

50|$|Two {{bearings}} {{are used}} per wheel. The bearings slip into openings molded into {{each side of}} the wheel <b>hub,</b> and a <b>flange</b> molded into the wheel hub holds the bearings the correct distance apart. Additionally there is an axle spacer either machined into the axle or that slides over the axle (depending on the axle system used). Since the outer race of the bearing contacts the wheel spacer and the inner race of the bearing contacts the axle spacer, it is critical that the relationship between these two spacers is correct. If the wheel spacer is wider than the axle spacer the bearings will bind when the axle bolt (or bolts) are tightened.|$|R
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Communications and Agricultural EducationLauri M. BakerThe {{purpose of}} this study was to explore the frames and messages, issue salience, and {{communication}} preferences agricultural producers in Kansas, Oklahoma, and Texas use and accept related to climate change and the impacts of a changing climate. It was of additional interest to explore the climate-change beliefs and preferred agricultural media sources for climate and climate change information. Specific research objectives to guide the study were RO 1 : describe the level of issue salience agricultural producers have related to climate change; RO 2 : investigate frames and messages agricultural producers prefer in reference to the scientifically designated phenomena of climate change and impacts; and RO 3 : identify the agricultural media and information channels agricultural producers use for climate change. Based on findings in previous research, one hypothesis was developed: H 1 : agricultural producers in the Southern <b>Plains</b> Regional Climate <b>Hub</b> area will be located within the audience segment groups of the concerned and the cautious as identified in the Six Americaâ€™s (2012) study. An Internet survey was distributed to producers in Kansas, which was open from March 3 to March 14, 2016, with 158 responses to the survey. Agenda-Setting Theory served as the basis for the study including the tenants of issue salience and framing in relation to climate change. The study found that the majority (n = 158, 64. 92 %) of producers believed that climate change was occurring, however, the causes were still contested. The study identified that higher levels of risk perception and education level were linked to belief in anthropogenic climate change (ACC). Primarily, the study found that loss framing was most effective in communicating the impacts of climate change. Terminology and distance framing were less important in message framing. Regional and university publications were cited most frequently by producers as sources of climate and climate-change information and overall use of agricultural media publications was linked to higher levels of belief in ACC. Users of business reports and TV had the highest mean climate-change belief; non-users had the lowest. Audience segments aligned with cautious and concerned Six Americaâ€™s (2013) audience segment group, which indicated a shift towards accepting climate change among agricultural producers...|$|R
