40|$|Introduction and objective: Scorpion sting (SS) is {{a source}} of {{considerable}} morbidity and mortality in many parts of Iran such as Khuzestan a province south west, Iran. Inappropriate use of antibiotics results in microbial resistance as well as economic impact on health sector. The aim of present study was to identify the possible rate of secondary bacterial infection (SBI) among the patients with SS. Materials and methods: This was a retrospective study in which patient files with the diagnosis of SS were reviewed. The study was undertaken in Razi Hospital, Ahvaz. The hospital files of all patients managed for SS from 2003 to 2008 were reviewed. Diagnostic criteria for SBI were reasonable incubation period, clinical findings (e. g. cellulitis, abscess, and wound discharge) and laboratory clues (e. g. microbiological evidence, leukocytosis more than 10000 and <b>polynucleosis</b> more than 80 %). The cases with positive culture results were considering as suspected SBI. Both SBI and suspected SBI considered being candidate for antibiotic therapy. Results: In the present study, 1381 patients were treated for SS. Out of total 1381 SS cases, 730 (52. 8 %) were treated by antibiotic, whereas only 39 patients (2. 8 %) were suspected to be SBI. None of these SBI cases confirmed by bacterial culture. Conclusion: Secondary bacterial infection is a rare complication of SS. This study showed the unnecessary use of antibiotic drugs in the management of SS as a routine approach...|$|E
