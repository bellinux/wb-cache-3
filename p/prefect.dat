5|$|Auxiliary regiments {{were now}} {{led by a}} praefectus (<b>prefect),</b> who could be either a native nobleman, who would {{probably}} be granted Roman citizenship for the purpose (e.g. the famous German war leader Arminius gained Roman citizenship probably by serving as an auxiliary <b>prefect</b> before turning against Rome); or a Roman, either of knightly rank, or a senior centurion.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{replaced}} the <b>prefect</b> of Rome with his consular colleague Bassus. Most officials {{who had served}} under Carinus, however, retained their offices under Diocletian. In an act of clementia denoted by the epitomator Aurelius Victor as unusual, Diocletian did not kill or depose Carinus' traitorous praetorian <b>prefect</b> and consul Ti. Claudius Aurelius Aristobulus, but confirmed him in both roles. He later gave him the proconsulate of Africa and the post of urban <b>prefect</b> for 295. The other figures who retained their offices might have also betrayed Carinus.|$|E

50|$|<b>Prefects</b> are {{selected}} in May {{for the following}} school year.There are two head <b>prefects,</b> (seniors) and two foot <b>prefects</b> (Juniors). These head and foot <b>prefects</b> are elected by the other prefects.Prefects applying must be in grade 9 or 10, must submit an application {{in the form of}} an essay, and agree to an interview with the head and foot <b>prefects,</b> along with the involved staff. At this interview, candidates are tested to ensure that they are compliant to the form of leadership practiced by the head <b>prefects.</b> There are approximately 30 <b>prefects</b> each year.|$|R
5|$|Equestrians {{by birth}} would {{normally}} begin their military careers at c. 30 years of age. An axillary {{had to do}} 25 years of service before joining the army. Commands were held in a set sequence, each held for 3–4 years: <b>prefect</b> of an auxiliary cohors, tribunus militum in a legion and finally <b>prefect</b> of an auxiliary ala. In Hadrian's time, a fourth command was added, for exceptionally able officers, of <b>prefect</b> of an ala milliaria. Like officers senatorial rank, hereditary equestrians held civilian posts before and after their decade of military service, whereas non-hereditary officers tended {{to remain in the}} army, commanding various units in various provinces. By the 3rd century, most auxiliary prefects had exclusively military careers.|$|E
5|$|In AD 6, Judea, Idumea, and Samaria were {{transformed}} from a client kingdom of the Roman Empire into an imperial province, also called Judea. A Roman <b>prefect,</b> rather than a client king, ruled the land. The <b>prefect</b> ruled from Caesarea Maritima, leaving Jerusalem to be run by the High Priest of Israel. As an exception, the <b>prefect</b> came to Jerusalem during religious festivals, when religious and patriotic enthusiasm sometimes inspired unrest or uprisings. Gentile lands surrounded the Jewish territories of Judea and Galilee, but Roman law and practice allowed Jews to remain separate legally and culturally. Galilee was evidently prosperous, and poverty was limited enough {{that it did not}} threaten the social order.|$|E
5|$|In {{keeping with}} his move from an {{ideology}} of republicanism {{to one of}} autocracy, Diocletian's council of advisers, his consilium, differed from those of earlier emperors. He destroyed the Augustan illusion of imperial government as a cooperative affair between emperor, army, and senate. In its place he established an effectively autocratic structure, a shift later epitomized in the institution's name: it would be called a consistorium (""), not a council. Diocletian regulated his court by distinguishing separate departments (scrina) for different tasks. From this structure came the offices of different magistri, like the Magister officiorum ("Master of offices"), and associated secretariats. These were men suited to dealing with petitions, requests, correspondence, legal affairs, and foreign embassies. Within his court Diocletian maintained a permanent body of legal advisers, men with significant influence on his re-ordering of juridical affairs. There were also two finance ministers, dealing with the separate bodies of the public treasury and the private domains of the emperor, and the praetorian <b>prefect,</b> the most significant person of the whole. Diocletian's reduction of the Praetorian Guards {{to the level of}} a simple city garrison for Rome lessened the military powers of the <b>prefect</b> – although a <b>prefect</b> like Asclepiodotus was still a trained general – but the office retained much civil authority. The <b>prefect</b> kept a staff of hundreds and managed affairs in all segments of government: in taxation, administration, jurisprudence, and minor military commands, the praetorian <b>prefect</b> was often second only to the emperor himself.|$|E
50|$|Apart {{from the}} {{teachers}} {{the rules and}} regulations of the school where dispensed by school <b>prefects.</b> There are two categories of <b>prefects,</b> School <b>prefects</b> and House <b>prefects.</b> The school <b>prefects</b> jurisdiction was the whole school. There were 10 school <b>prefects</b> who were made up of the Head of the 10 houses. From these 10 <b>prefects</b> a Head of School and his deputy were chosen. To distinguish themselves the silver bands {{near the edge of the}} arm sleeve of their school blazer was a double band (a normal student had a single band) when the bands reached the outside of the arm sleeve they crossed paths before maintaining the parallel path wrong the sleeve. The head of school had two short vertical strips located just above the crossed band paths and his deputy had one. The other group of <b>prefects</b> was the House <b>prefects.</b> Their jurisdiction was their respective houses and sometimes the block they belonged to. House <b>prefects</b> wore two parallel silver bands that went all around the edge of the arm sleeve.|$|R
50|$|The <b>prefects</b> for {{the next}} school year are chosen when the {{students}} are in the 3rd term in SS2, after successfully completing their sea school program. The main <b>prefects</b> are the head girl and the head boy. There are also other post such as the dining hall <b>prefects</b> and sports <b>prefects.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{metropolitan}} areas of both Western Han Chang'an and Eastern Han Luoyang were governed and secured by several officials and officers. The county and municipal {{divisions of the}} capital cities were governed by a <b>Prefect</b> (Ling 令). The <b>Prefect</b> was also responsible for a prison and could arrest officials of high rank. The Colonel of the City Gates (Chengmen xiaowei 城門校衛) commanded the garrisons at the twelve city gates, each guarded by a captain, in both Western Han Chang'an and Eastern Han Luoyang.|$|E
5|$|Additionally, as Cluj-Napoca is {{the capital}} of Cluj County, the city hosts the palace of the prefecture, the {{headquarters}} of the county council (consiliu județean) and the <b>prefect,</b> who is appointed by Romania's central government. The <b>prefect</b> is not allowed {{to be a member of}} a political party, and his role is to represent the national government at the local level, acting as a liaison and facilitating the implementation of National Development Plans and governing programmes at the local level. Like all other local councils in Romania, the Cluj-Napoca local council, the county council and the city's mayor are elected every four years by the population.|$|E
5|$|After this, Cutzinas {{remained}} as a vassal chieftain, receiving regular pay from the Byzantine authorities. In January 563, however, the new <b>prefect</b> of Africa, John Rogathinus, refused {{to hand over}} the money and had Cutzinas murdered, prompting an uprising from the latter's children.|$|E
50|$|<b>Prefects</b> are {{appointed}} by the principal after consultation with the House Masters. <b>Prefects</b> are given authority and privileges. The <b>Prefects</b> are led by the Captain of School, the four House Captains and the four House vice captains.

The House Captains each have the colour of their house on the edges of their gowns. The Sports <b>Prefect's</b> gown bears the traditional sports colours of the college, brown and yellow. The remaining <b>Prefects</b> wear plain black robes.|$|R
5|$|Debates and {{negotiations}} on the limits and objectives of the future national park intensified.

The communes responded positively to the project, adding some recommendations.|$|E
5|$|Domitian quickly {{launched}} a counteroffensive, personally travelling {{to the region}} accompanied by a large force commanded by his praetorian <b>prefect</b> Cornelius Fuscus.

5|$|In the Life of Tacitus, {{the emperor}} is {{acclaimed}} by the Senate, {{meeting in the}} Curia Pompiliana, which never existed. The History then lists a number of individuals, {{all of whom are}} invented by the author: the consul 'Velius Cornificius Gordianus', 'Maecius Faltonius Nicomachus', the <b>Prefect</b> of the City 'Aelius Cesettianus', and the Praetorian <b>Prefect</b> 'Moesius Gallicanus'. Private letters commending Tacitus are quoted from the senators 'Autronius Tiberianus' and 'Claudius Sapilianus', both of whom are assumed to be fictitious. Most of the 'Maecii' and 'Gallicani' in the History are believed to be inventions of the author.|$|E
5|$|It {{is likely}} that Sejanus' father Strabo came to the {{attention}} of Augustus through his father's connection with Maecenas. Sometime after 2 BC, Strabo was appointed <b>prefect</b> of the Praetorian Guard, one of the two most powerful positions a Roman knight could attain in the Empire. This office he carried on dutifully and without incident until the death of Augustus in AD 14. Little is known about the life Sejanus led prior to this date, but according to Tacitus, he accompanied Gaius Caesar, adopted grandson of Augustus, during his campaigns in Armenia in 1 BC. Upon the accession of Tiberius in AD 14, Sejanus was appointed <b>prefect</b> of the Praetorian Guard as the colleague of his father Strabo, and began his rise to prominence.|$|E
5|$|Judea {{was added}} to the {{province}} of Syria when Augustus deposed Herod Archelaus, successor to client king Herod the Great (73–4BC). Syria (like Egypt after Antony) was governed by a high <b>prefect</b> of the equestrian class rather than by a proconsul or legate of Augustus.|$|E
5000|$|Choosing <b>prefects</b> {{is done by}} {{nomination}} for prefecture by teachers and senior students, training, elimination processes, and a several month stint as a 'Temporary Prefect'.

5000|$|Apart {{from the}} staff members, the <b>prefects</b> guild and class {{monitors}} {{contribute to the}} administration procedure.

50|$|There was a {{complete}} structure of <b>Prefects,</b> at the summit two head boys and two head girls, then headmasters/senior <b>prefects,</b> <b>prefects,</b> sub-prefects, and TSPs Sub <b>Prefects.</b> This separate organisation was particularly called upon when teaching staff took the decision to stop monitoring the substantial play-grounds, in the sometimes turbulent mix of social classes, religious and ethnic origins, and the heady mix of boy and girl in the 1960s. Mr Williams, in the mid-1960s, one of two deputy heads, was required to dispense summary justice on boys presented by <b>Prefects.</b>|$|R
5|$|Once {{back in the}} city, {{however, the}} Patriarch and Apokaukos seized power. Kantakouzenos's family and friends were imprisoned (Kantakouzenos's mother Theodora would {{eventually}} die in prison) and the Patriarch was declared regent, while Anna named Apokaukos as urban <b>prefect</b> (eparchos) of Constantinople.|$|E
5|$|Some {{time after}} his return, and before 293, Diocletian {{transferred}} {{command of the}} war against Carausius from Maximian to Flavius Constantius, a former Governor of Dalmatia and a man of military experience stretching back to Aurelian's campaigns against Zenobia (272–73). He was Maximian's praetorian <b>prefect</b> in Gaul, and the husband to Maximian's daughter, Theodora. On 1 March 293 at Milan, Maximian gave Constantius the office of caesar. In the spring of 293, in either Philippopolis (Plovdiv, Bulgaria) or Sirmium, Diocletian {{would do the same}} for Galerius, husband to Diocletian's daughter Valeria, and perhaps Diocletian's Praetorian <b>Prefect.</b> Constantius was assigned Gaul and Britain. Galerius was initially assigned Syria, Palestine, Egypt, and responsibility for the eastern borderlands.|$|E
5|$|The {{nomenclature}} of {{the great}} majority of regiments followed a standard configuration: unit type, followed by serial number, followed by name of the peregrini tribe (or nation) from whom the regiment was originally raised, in the genitive plural case e.g. cohors III Batavorum ("3rd Cohort of Batavi"); cohors I Brittonum ("1st Cohort of Britons"). Some regiments combine the names of two peregrini tribes, most likely after the merger of two previously separate regiments e.g. ala I Pannoniorum et Gallorum ("1st Wing of Pannonii and Gauls"). A minority of regiments are named after an individual, mostly after the first <b>prefect</b> of the regiment e.g. ala Sulpicia (presumably named after a <b>prefect</b> whose middle (gens) name was Sulpicius). The latter is also an example of regiments that did not have a serial number.|$|E
