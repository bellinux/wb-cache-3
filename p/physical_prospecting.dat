On the background of MC 6 mined-out regions under Yangquan-Yuxian highway, the three-dimension geometry model and mesh are built firstly, through the strong pre-processing capacity of MIDAS/GTS, according to the engineering geological survey data (topog-raphic contour, geologic section, prospect drilling and <b>physical</b> <b>prospecting,</b> and so on); secondly, by the in-terface program of MIDAS/GTS-FLAC 3 D complied with MATLAB language, the mesh model built in MIDAS/GTS is imported into FLAC 3 D, thus the correct 3 D visual model of complex mined-out regions is fast built in FLAC 3 D with high efficiency. The engineering example verifies the feasibility and effectiveness of the coupling method which can provide new thoughts for building three-dimension numerical model for complex engineering...|$|E

Because women’s property rights are often assumed through {{the security of}} the oftentimes, male, household head, some inheritance laws allocate less property to female heirs than male heirs. Ongoing adherence to male-dominated traditions of property ownership has generally meant that women cannot take advantage of the wide range of benefits associated with ownership and control of property.

40|$|We {{investigate}} refined algebraic quantisation {{within a}} family of classically equivalent constrained Hamiltonian systems {{that are related to}} each other by rescaling a momentum-type constraint. The quantum constraint is implemented by a rigging map that is motivated by group averaging but has a resolution finer than what can be peeled off from the formally divergent contributions to the averaging integral. Three cases emerge, depending on the asymptotics of the rescaling function: (i) quantisation is equivalent to that with identity scaling; (ii) quantisation fails, owing to nonexistence of self-adjoint extensions of the constraint operator; (iii) a quantisation ambiguity arises from the self-adjoint extension of the constraint operator, and the resolution of this purely quantum mechanical ambiguity determines the superselection structure of the <b>physical</b> Hilbert space. <b>Prospects</b> of generalising the analysis to systems with several constraints are discussed.

40|$|This {{white paper}} justifies and {{outlines}} {{a new international}} joint Argo-Oxygen program in order to determine, on a global-scale, seasonal to decadal time-scale variations in sub-surface dissolved oxygen concentrations. We propose {{to achieve this goal}} by adding dissolved oxygen sensors to the floats of the successful Argo array, thus extending its measurement capabilities. This Argo-Oxygen program is motivated by the fact that oceanic dissolved oxygen concentration is a key quantity for ocean ecology and biogeochemistry. It permits study and quantification of a diverse and crucial set of processes. These processes include the detection of the oceanic impact of global warming on ocean biogeochemistry and circulation, the addition of unprecedented constraints on the export of biologically formed organic matter, and improved estimates of the oceanic uptake of anthropogenic CO 2. The addition of oxygen to the currently measured suite of temperature and salinity on Argo will represent a revolutionary step in our ability to observe the ocean’s evolution over time, integrating biogeochemical and <b>physical</b> observations.

40|$|Nanometer-sized grain {{structures}} that exhibit {{a large number}} of grain boundaries on the surface of a bulk material demonstrate excellent properties relative to their coarse-grained (CG) equivalents. Surface modification using surface mechanical attrition treatment (SMAT) is an option that cab be used to tailor the corrosion, tribological, mechanical, and chemical reaction properties of a surface. SMAT is an effective route to create the nanostructured surface layer. The SMAT process has unique advantages compared with the other coating and deposition techniques for surface nanocrystallization. For example, SMAT does not alter the chemical composition of the nanocrystalline surface layer in the matrix. In addition, SMAT has been demonstrated to activate the material surface layer by surface modification and enhance the atomic diffusivity. This article presents a review of the advantages offered by the SMAT technique for the creation of high performance surface layers. The influence of the created nanocrystalline layer on mechanical, physical, and chemical properties is assessed. Developments and the current status of the surface nanolayer that are formed are evaluated from a <b>physical</b> approach. Finally, <b>prospects</b> for the future development of grain refinement on the surface of a material matrix and potential applications are presented...|$|R
40|$|Following a brief {{discussion}} {{on the importance of}} understanding complex systems and the effectiveness of multi-scale method in analysing complex systems in chemical engineering, this presentation characterizes the hierarchical structures in complex systems by clarifying the difference between levels and scales. That is, &# 39;level&# 39; is defined as a domain higher than &# 39;scale&# 39;, which can be described more or less by an explicit model when studied from its upper level; while &# 39;scale&# 39; is used to describe the structural organization within a level. Using these terms, three different kinds of multi-scale methods are discussed. The descriptive method lays a basis for the other two methods, but no correlation between the scales are considered. The correlative method can describe the correlation between neighbouring scales or levels, but has faced with closure problems within a level, which can be solved by incorporating the variational method that correlates different scales through stability conditions. The variational method is more relevant to complexity science and is discussed in more detail including its <b>physical</b> principle and <b>prospects</b> in solving engineering problems in industries. Stability is critical to the variational method, which is recognized to be subject to compromise between dominant mechanisms and relationship between different scales of phenomena in systems. This strategy, mechanism compromise and scale resolution, is elucidated by studying two-phase structure in gas-solid systems. Then, its extension to different kinds of complex systems is presented. Verification of the strategy is carried out by computer-aided experiments, and its application to industries is demonstrated by three industrial cases where the method was applied. It is indicated that the local compromise between different dominant mechanisms with respect to both time and space leads to the formation of meso-scale structure which conformed to a variational criterion defined by a minimum lumped parameter. The presentation will be concluded by discussions on the possibility of generalizing the variational multi-scale method and some prospects of the method. Following a {{brief discussion}} on the importance of understanding complex systems and the effectiveness of multi-scale method in analysing complex systems in chemical engineering, this presentation characterizes the hierarchical structures in complex systems by clarifying the difference between levels and scales.

Employing a Kantian vocabulary, Habermas says {{that this is a}} kind of intervention which should only be exercised over things, never over persons. In The Future of Human Nature, Habermas develops a version of a common objection to genetic engineering – that it would involve treating humans as means rather than as ends. His formulation of this argument is important because he makes the novel claim that there is a somatic basis to our ethical freedom. We are embodied individuals and in order to regard ourselves as free and equal members of a community of similarly embodied individuals, we need to stand in a certain relationship to our own unchosen <b>physical</b> characteristics.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Young {{adults are}} often faced with {{challenges}} related to relationships, employment, housing, and emotional development. Experiencing cancer {{during this time}} complicates the developmental processes and creates a need for communicating concerns and discussing issues. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this study}} was to explore the experiences and gain a better understanding of young adults affected by cancer (YAACs) by examining their online narratives (also known as Web logs or blogs). INTERVENTIONS/METHODS: Inclusion and exclusion criteria were used to identify eligible Web sites. The Web site that most corresponded to the selection criteria was chosen for analysis (Planet Cancer, [URL] The blog content generated in July 2011 was collected. The blogs were written by a total of 34 female and 12 male writers and included 136 (by female) and 28 (by male) blog entries.

40|$|Both the Scottish Government and Glasgow City Council {{expressed}} an {{intention to use}} the 2014 Commonwealth Games to inspire more citizens to become physically active. This report looks {{at the prospect of}} this being achieved in the East End of Glasgow, which served as the 'host' community for the Games, and was an area particularly identified as potentially benefitting from legacy. In order to conduct the evaluation of <b>physical</b> activity legacy <b>prospects</b> in Glasgow's East End, we reviewed the major legacy programmes from the CWG in order to identify initiatives which are intended by their sponsors to support increased levels of physical activity. Following this, we used policy documents and stakeholder interviews to understand the mechanisms through which the programmes were intended to work. As a result, we identified 39 legacy programmes relevant to a sports and physical activity legacy, which we have divided into four legacy pathways: sports facilities; social infrastructure; schools; and environment. Pathway One - Sports Facilities: This pathway includes programmes relating to investment in new and improved sports and leisure facilities, so that people have the opportunity to take more exercise. Pathway Two - Social Infrastructure: This pathway relates to the development of social infrastructure through sports clubs, events, coaching and volunteers in order to stimulate grassroots participation. Pathway Three - Schools: This pathway includes programmes which involve schools in order to promote greater levels of physical activity for children. Pathway Four - Environment: This pathway covers programmes which aim to supporting physical activity and active travel through better-designed local environments.

40|$|The present {{review paper}} {{reports on the}} <b>physical</b> properties, status, <b>prospects</b> for further {{development}} and applications of polycrystalline (or amorphous), transparent and conducting oxides (TCO) semiconductors. The coexistence of elec trical conductivity and optical transparency in these materials depends on the nature, number and atomic arrangements of metal cations in crystalline or amorphous oxide structures, on the resident morphology and {{on the presence of}} intrinsic or intentionally introduced defects. The main important TCO semiconductors are impurity-doped ZnO, In 2 O 3 , SnO 2 and CdO, the ternary compounds Zn 2 SnO 4 , ZnSnO 3 , Zn 2 In 2 O 5 , Zn 3 In 2 O 6 , In 2 SnO 4 , CdSnO 3 , and multi-component oxides consisting of combinations of ZnO, In 2 O 3 and SnO 2 . Sn doped In 2 O 3 (ITO) and F doped SnO 2 TCO thin solid films are the most preferable materials for most present applications. The expanding use of TCO materials, especially for the production of transparent electrodes for optoelectronic device applications, is endangered by the scarcity and high price of In. This situation drives for the search alternative TCO materials to replace ITO. The electrical resistivity of the novel TCO materials should be ~ 1. 0 × 10 - 5 Ωcm, typical absorption coefficient smaller than 10. 0 4 cm- 1 in the near UV and visible range, with optical band gap ~ 3. 0 eV. At present, ZnO:Al and ZnO:Ga (AZO and GZO) semiconductors are becoming good alternatives to ITO for thin solid films transparent electrode applications. The best candidates are AZO thin films, which are of low resistivity in the order of 1. 0 × 10 - 4 Ωcm, have inexpensive source materials and are non-toxic. However, development of large area deposition techniques are still needed to enable the production of AZO and GZO films on large area substrates with a high deposition rate. In addition, applied TCO materials should be stable in hostile environment containing acidic and alkali solutions, oxidizing and reducing atmospheres, at high temperature. Most of the TCO materials are “n-type” semiconductors, but “p-type” TCO materials are also explored. Such TCO include: ZnO:Mg, ZnO:N, IZO, NiO, NiO:Li, CuAlO 2 , Cu 2 SrO 2 , and CuGaO 2 thin films. These materials have not yet found place in actual applications...|$|R
