40|$|In Europe, {{the highly}} {{developed}} livestock industry places a high burden on resource use and environmental quality. This paper examines pig meat production in North-West Europe {{as a base}} case and runs different scenarios to investigate how improvements in terms of energy and greenhouse gas (GHG) savings can be feasibly achieved. As shown in {{the results of the}} analysis, pig farming in the EU has a high potential to reduce fossil energy use and GHG emissions by taking improvement measures in three aspects: (i) feed use; (ii) manure management; and (iii) manure utilization. In particular, a combination of improvements in all mentioned aspects offers the highest savings potential of up to 61 % fossil energy and 49 % GHG emissions. In weighing these three aspects, manure utilization for energy production is found {{to be the most important}} factor in reducing fossil energy use and GHG emissions.

40|$|Purpose: The {{purpose of}} this paper is to analyze price {{transmission}} in the Chinese pork market between 1994 and 2016 and examine any incidence and causes of asymmetric price transmission. Design/methodology/approach: The approach uses threshold autoregressive models, asymmetric error correction models and autoregressive moving average models to examine the price transmission using monthly <b>pig</b> and <b>pork</b> prices from 1994 to 2016. Findings: While a symmetric price transmission between <b>pork</b> and <b>pig</b> prices was identified for the period between June 1994 and June 2007, an asymmetric price transmission response between <b>pork</b> and <b>pig</b> prices was found for the period July 2007 to June 2016. Key factors behind the asymmetric price transmission include the chicken price and China’s provisional purchasing and stockpiling policy which is having a counter-productive impact on prices. Originality/value: The paper contributes to the literature by examining price transmission in two different periods: 1994 to 2007 where prices are lower and more stable; and 2007 to 2016 where prices are higher and volatile. The paper examines the impact of production and market policies on price transmission in the Chinese <b>pork</b> and <b>pig</b> market, with several policy implications...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. We {{identified}} 114 {{patients with}} neurocysticercosis admitted to Ben Taub General Hospital in Houston, Texas between January 1994 and June 1997. Most {{of these patients}} were born in Mexico (78 %) or Central America (16 %), but 6 % {{were born in the}} United States. Review of neurology clinic records identified 54 patients diagnosed with neurocysticercosis, representing 2 % of all neurology clinic patients and 16 % of all Hispanics diagnosed with seizures. Forty-one patients were interviewed and all reported significant risk factors for infection, including ingestion of under-cooked <b>pork,</b> <b>pig</b> husbandry, immigration from and frequent travel to villages in disease-endemic areas, or personal/ family history of taeniasis. Among Mexican immigrants, most were born in rural areas in Central (31 %) or north central Mexico (38 %). Significantly fewer of the patients were from the border states (15 %). The median period from immi-gration to diagnosis was 58 months, but it was 28 months for the 13 patients who had not left the United States after immigration. Although neurocysticercosis is being diagnosed with increasing frequency in the United States, acquisition of infection is still strongly associated with pig husbandry in rural Latin America, with little evidence of local transmis-sion. Even among urban immigrants to the United States and United States–born cases, there is close ongoing contact with disease-endemic villages...|$|E
40|$|Pork {{products}} are a substantial source of human yersiniosis, a foodborne disease caused by Yersinia enterocolitica. Thus, {{the ability to}} eliminate this agent from pig herds would be {{an important step in}} producing human pathogen– free <b>pork.</b> <b>Pig</b> herds free from Y. enterocolitica O: 3 /biovar 4 have been established and maintained. According to serologic and cultural testing results, 15 of 16 specifi c pathogen–free herds were free from Y. enterocolitica O: 3 /biovar 4; this closed breeding pyramid has remained free from this organism since 1996. Pig herds free from human pathogenic Y. enterocolitica suggest that human pathogen–free herds could be attained to provide pork free from zoonotic agents. Yersinia enterocolitica is a major cause of foodborne disease in the industrialized world (1, 2). The emergence of Y. enterocolitica O: 3 and O: 9 in Europe and Japan in the 1970 s and in North America {{by the end of the}} 1980 s has been characterized as an example of a global pandemic (3). Outbreaks of Y. enterocolitica O: 3 have occurred among black US infants due to cross-contamination during household preparation of raw pork intestines (chitterlings) (4, 5), and the main reservoir for Y. enterocolitica O: 3 in Europe is the domestic pig population (6). A case–control study conducted by the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) and the Norwegian Institute of Public Health (NIPH) indicated pork products as a major source of yersiniosis in humans in Norway (7). As a result of this and other epidemiologic studies (6, 8 – 10), improved slaughtering and dressing procedures of pigs (11, 12) were implemented in Norwegian abattoirs in 1994. The decline in the incidence of human yersiniosis (13), which started in 1995, is most likely the result of these preventive measures...|$|E
40|$|Animal {{production}} {{is an integral}} part of Ghana’s agricultural economy and a major source of livelihood for many rural households in the Northern, Upper East and Upper West Regions of Ghana. In Ghana, animals are raised under the extensive, semi-intensive and/or intensive system. However, the extensive system is the commonest method and it is practiced most especially in rural communities. Animal production holdings are commercially, family or individually owned. Commercial farmers normally keep poultry, and mostly under the intensive system. Different animal species are reared in Ghana purposely for local consumption. This paper provides an analysis of animal and meat production in Ghana within a 10 year period. Between 2001 and 2010 the average of live animal production was 3, 958, 560 for goats, 3, 269, 460 for sheep, 1, 373, 700 for cattle, 404, 600 for pigs, and 33, 252 for chickens. In general, the increase in goat and sheep production was higher than the increase in cattle, pigs and chicken production within this period. Averages of meat production in Tonnes were 34, 427, 24, 491, 13, 535, 12, 336 and 12, 056, for chicken (chicken meat), beef (cattle meat), <b>pork</b> (<b>pig</b> meat), chevon (goat meat) and mutton (sheep meat), respectively. The increase in chicken meat was the highest within this period. Total meat production in Tonnes was 177, 723 in 2001, 176, 086 in 2002, 181, 686 in 2003, 186, 470 in 2004, 188, 537 in 2005, 191, 021 in 2006, 198, 093 in 2007, 220, 243 in 2008, 232, 516 in 2009 and 244, 742 in 2010. Opportunities for increased animal and meat production in Ghana still exist since the country imports animal and meat from abroad. This overview provides reference data of animal and meat production in Ghana. It is expected that the Government and other stakeholders will use this data in planning and making of policies, and to monitor changes that may occur overtime...|$|E

40|$|Salmonellosis {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} bacterial zoonotic diseases in humans. In Belgium, Salmonella enterica subspecies enterica serovar Typhimurium (Salmonella Typhimurium) was most frequently associated with human salmonellosis in 2006 due to the consumption of contaminated <b>pork.</b> <b>Pig</b> carcass contamination with Salmonella Typhimurium can largely be attributed to persistently infected pigs. Tonsils are a predilection site for Salmonella persistence in pigs 1. The mechanism used by Salmonella Typhimurium to persist in the tonsil is not yet understood but apparently differs from that used for intestinal colonization 2. Virulence mechanisms, necessary for cell invasion and intracellular survival, do not contribute to tonsil colonization, suggesting that Salmonella Typhimurium resides extracellularly in porcine tonsils. It was the aim of the present study to determine whether or not Salmonella Typhimurium persists intracellularly in porcine tonsils. Four-week-old piglets were inoculated 7 days after arrival with a nalidixic acid resistant Salmonella Typhimurium strain 112910 a, phage type 120 /ad. On days 5 and 28 post inoculation (pi), 9 and 4 piglets respectively were euthanized. Samples of tonsils and mesenteric and ileocaecal lymph nodes were collected to prepare single cell suspensions and cryosections. Single cell suspensions were obtained by treating tissue samples with collagenase. One ml of this suspension was plated on brilliant green agar containing nalidixic acid (BGANAL) to assess the total number of intra- and extracellular salmonellae. The remaining suspension was treated with gentamicin, killing all extracellular salmonellae. The tissue cells were then lysed and again 1 ml of the suspension was plated on BGANAL to determine the number of intracellular salmonellae. The cryosections were treated with a primary antibody mixture containing rabbit antibody to the Salmonella O 4 antigen and mouse antibody to tissue cell receptor CD 172 α. Sections were then incubated with a secondary antibody mixture containing goat anti-rabbit Alexa Fluor 488 and goat anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 568. Sections were evaluated using a Leica DMRB fluorescence microscope. 	Five as well as 28 days pi, only a minority of the Salmonella bacteria (respectively 90 %) and 28 days (> 85 %) pi. 	The results obtained by single cell suspensions and fluorescence microscopy show that Salmonella Typhimurium resides largely extracellularly in porcine tonsils and gut-associated lymph nodes in the early and late phase of infection. These results suggest that control measures interfering with the persistence of Salmonella Typhimurium in pigs should focus primarily on the extracellular bacteria...|$|E
