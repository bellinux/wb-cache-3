500|$|The natural {{distribution}} of plants {{across the world}} has determined when and where cultigens have been produced. The botanical and horticultural collection of economically important plants, including [...] ornamentals, was based in Europe. Although economic herbs and spices {{had a long history}} in trade, and there are good records of cultivar distribution by the Romans, European botanical and horticultural exploration rapidly increased in the 19th century with the colonial expansion taking place at the time. New plants were brought back to Europe while, at the same time, valuable economic plants, including those from the tropics, were distributed among the colonies. This <b>plant</b> <b>trade</b> has provided the common global heritage of economic and ornamental cultigens that we use today and which formed the stock for modern plant selection, breeding, and genetic engineering.|$|E

Estimates indicated that 97.5% of Sarracenia habitat has already been destroyed in the southeastern U.S., the home of all but one subspecies of Sarracenia. Currently the biggest threats to surviving populations are urban development, drainage of habitat for forestry, runoff of herbicides from agriculture, fire suppression, cut pitcher trade for floristry, and <b>plant</b> <b>trade.</b> The latter two threaten survival of Sarracenia not only through depletion of healthy population, {{but also because of}} the damaging effects (soil compaction and altered moisture levels) of repeated foot and vehicular traffic that comes with harvesting.

40|$|Question: What {{are the key}} {{physiological}} and life-history trade-offs responsible {{for the evolution of}} different suites of plant traits (strategies) in different environments? Experimental methods: Common-garden experiments were performed on physiologically realistic model plants, evolved in contrasting environments, in computer simulations. This allowed the identification of the trade-offs that resulted in different suites of traits (strategies). The environments considered were: resource rich, low disturbance (competitive); resource poor, low disturbance (stressed); resource rich, high disturbance (disturbed); and stressed environments containing herbivores (grazed). Results: In disturbed environments, plants increased reproduction at the expense of ability to compete for light and nitrogen. In competitive environments, <b>plants</b> <b>traded</b> off reproductive output and leaf production for vertical growth. In stressed environments, <b>plants</b> <b>traded</b> off vertical growth and reproductive output for nitrogen acquisition, contradicting Grime's (2001) theory that slow-growing, competitively inferior strategies are selected in stressed environments. The contradiction is partly resolved by incorporating herbivores into the stressed environment, which selects for increased investment in defence, at the expense of competitive ability and reproduction. Conclusion: Our explicit modelling of trade-offs produces rigorous testable explanations of observed associations between suites of traits and environments...|$|R

50|$|Due to the {{popularity}} of this species, {{as well as many}} of the other Lithops in the succulent <b>plant</b> <b>trade,</b> it can be found in markets across the world. L. francisci was once sold and harvested to the point of threatening the endemic population. Over the past 100 years, thousands of these plants have been dug up and exported from their native habitat. This practice has significantly decreased the effective population size within the small (< 625 km2) range of natural occurrence. However, the IUCN reports a decrease in this activity over the last 15 years and though population size and range is still decreasing, the pace has begun to slow.|$|E
50|$|Mammillarias have {{extremely}} variable spination from {{species to}} species, and attractive flowers, making them attractive for cactus hobbyists. Most mammillarias are considered easy to cultivate, though some species {{are among the}} hardest cacti to grow.

Under the federal P. ramorum quarantine program implemented by USDA APHIS, nurseries in California, Oregon, and Washington are regulated and must participate in an annual inspection regimen; nurseries in the 14 infested counties in coastal California, plus the limited infested area in Curry County, Oregon, must participate in a more stringent inspection schedule when shipping out of this area.|$|E

50|$|There are {{a number}} of alpine plants that are used economically. In the Himalayas, {{hundreds}} of species are traded for medicinal and aromatic uses. It is estimated that the annual trade of these plants amounts to millions of US dollars. Many households in rural Nepal and India rely on medicinal alpine <b>plant</b> <b>trade</b> as a source of income.
