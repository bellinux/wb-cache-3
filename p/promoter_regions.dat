25|$|A {{distinctive}} {{feature of the}} gene is that it begins with two <b>promoter</b> <b>regions.</b> The first exon from the 5' end contains two tissue-specific <b>promoter</b> <b>regions.</b> Transcription can begin at either promoter (depending on the tissue) so that the same gene can produce a slightly different molecule in liver and in other tissues. The two isoforms of glucokinase differ only by 13–15 amino acids at the N-terminal end of the molecule, which produces only a minimal difference in structure. The two isoforms have the same kinetic and functional characteristics.|$|E
25|$|Nondeletion forms: These defects, in general, {{involve a}} single base {{substitution}} or small insertions near or upstream of the β globin gene.

25|$|During the {{transcription}} cycle, the CTD {{of the large}} subunit of RNAP II is reversibly phosphorylated. RNAP II containing unphosphorylated CTD is recruited to the promoter, whereas the hyperphosphorylated CTD form is involved in active transcription. Phosphorylation occurs at two sites within the heptapeptide repeat, at Serine 5 and Serine 2. Serine 5 phosphorylation is confined to <b>promoter</b> <b>regions</b> and {{is necessary for the}} initiation of transcription, whereas Serine 2 phosphorylation is important for mRNA elongation and 3'-end processing.|$|E
50|$|This is {{associated}} {{with an increase in}} acetylation of H3K9 in the GR <b>promoter</b> <b>region.</b> Methylation of CpG islands in the <b>promoter</b> <b>region</b> of GR leads to a decrease in the ability of NGFI-A to bind to the GR <b>promoter</b> <b>region.</b> It has also been experimentally shown that methylation of CpG sites in the enhancer region bound by NGFI-A is detrimental to the ability of NGFI-A to bind to the <b>promoter</b> <b>region.</b> Furthermore, the methylation of the <b>promoter</b> <b>region</b> results in a decrease in recruitment of the CREB-Binding Protein (CBP), which has histone acetyltransferase ability. This results in less acetylation of the histones, which {{has been shown to be}} a modification that takes place within individuals less susceptible to depression.|$|R

25|$|With a {{high rate}} of Ras {{mutation}} in CMML, deregulation of this signalling pathway has been linked to the pathogenesis of the disease. Tumour necrosis factor, GM-CSF, interleukin-3, interleukin-4, interleukin-6, and interleukin-10 may have a role in hyperproliferative CMML cells. These cytokines can stimulate the growth of CMML in vitro. Hypermethylation of cytosine residues (usually in the <b>promoter</b> <b>regions</b> of genes) occurs in many malignancies to regulate gene expression. One commonly hypermethylated gene in CMML is p15INK4b, a gene involved in cell cycle regulation.|$|E
25|$|The Aux/IAA repressors {{provide an}} example of one of the {{pathways}} leading to auxin induced changes of gene expression. This pathway involves the protein families TIR1 (transport inhibitor response1), ARF (auxin response factor), Aux/IAA transcriptional repressors, and the ubiquitin ligase complex that {{is a part of the}} ubiquitin-proteasome protein degradation pathway. ARF proteins have DNA binding domains and can bind <b>promoter</b> <b>regions</b> of genes and activate or repress gene expression. Aux/IAA proteins can bind ARF proteins sitting on gene promoters and prevent them from doing their job.|$|E
25|$|DNA {{methylation}} {{was probably}} present at some extent in very early eukaryote ancestors. In virtually every organism analyzed, methylation in <b>promoter</b> <b>regions</b> correlates negatively with gene expression. CpG-dense promoters of actively transcribed genes are never methylated, but reciprocally transcriptionally silent genes {{do not necessarily}} carry a methylated promoter. In mouse and human, around 60–70% of genes have a CpG island in their promoter region {{and most of these}} CpG islands remain unmethylated independently of the transcriptional activity of the gene, in both differentiated and undifferentiated cell types. Of note, whereas DNA methylation of CpG islands is unambiguously linked with transcriptional repression, the function of DNA methylation in CG-poor promoters remains unclear; albeit {{there is little evidence that}} it could be functionally relevant.|$|E
30|$|In {{order to}} {{understand}} the regulatory system governing PHA production in detail, we investigated the binding behaviors of PhaR to the target DNA (containing the <b>promoter</b> <b>region</b> of phaP) and to P(3 HB), using QCM measurements. Regarding PhaR-DNA binding, Figure 2 A shows that PhaR mainly bound to the DNA containing the phaP <b>promoter</b> <b>region</b> (curve a), and barely bound to the DNA containing the phaR <b>promoter</b> <b>region</b> (curve b) or to the control DNA (curve c). The binding curve of PhaR to the phaP <b>promoter</b> <b>region</b> showed sigmoid curve, implying that PhaR binds to target DNA in a cooperative reaction. The SPR analysis of PhaR-DNA binding in previous studies was not capable of monitoring the initial binding of PhaR, because the concentration of PhaR (10 μM) was higher than in the present experimental conditions (2.5 to 10 nM) (Kojima et al. 2006; Maehara et al. 2002). The higher binding affinity of PhaR to the phaP <b>promoter</b> <b>region</b> accorded with the results of gel-mobility-shift assays (Maehara et al. 2002).

25|$|In mammals, {{the only}} {{exception}} for this global CpG depletion resides in a specific category of GC- and CpG-rich sequences termed CpG islands that are generally unmethylated and therefore retained the expected CpG content. CpG islands are usually defined as regions with 1) a length greater than 200bp, 2) a G+C content greater than 50%, 3) a ratio of observed to expected CpG greater than 0.6, although other definitions are sometimes used. Excluding repeated sequences, there are around 25,000 CpG islands in the human genome, 75% of which being less than 850bp long. They are major regulatory units and around 50% of CpG islands are located in gene <b>promoter</b> <b>regions,</b> while another 25% lie in gene bodies, often serving as alternative promoters. Reciprocally, around 60-70% of human genes have a CpG island in their promoter region. The majority of CpG islands are constitutively unmethylated and enriched for permissive chromatin modification such as H3K4 methylation. In somatic tissues, only 10% of CpG islands are methylated, {{the majority of them}} being located in intergenic and intragenic regions.|$|E
500|$|Flanking {{the open}} reading frame, genes contain a {{regulatory}} sequence {{that is required}} for their expression. First, genes require a promoter sequence. The promoter is recognized and bound by transcription factors and RNA polymerase to initiate transcription. The recognition typically occurs as a consensus sequence like the TATA box. [...] A gene can {{have more than one}} promoter, resulting in messenger RNAs (mRNA) that differ in how far they extend in the 5'end. Highly transcribed genes have [...] "strong" [...] promoter sequences that form strong associations with transcription factors, thereby initiating transcription at a high rate. Others genes have [...] "weak" [...] promoters that form weak associations with transcription factors and initiate transcription less frequently. Eukaryotic <b>promoter</b> <b>regions</b> are much more complex and difficult to identify than prokaryotic promoters.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to repairing DNA, homologous recombination also helps produce genetic diversity when cells divide in meiosis to become specialized gamete cells—sperm or egg cells in animals, pollen or ovules in plants, and spores in fungi. [...] It does so by facilitating chromosomal crossover, in which regions of similar but not identical DNA are exchanged between homologous chromosomes. [...] This creates new, possibly beneficial combinations of genes, which can give offspring an evolutionary advantage. Chromosomal crossover often begins when a protein called Spo11 makes a targeted double-strand break in DNA. These sites are non-randomly {{located on the}} chromosomes; usually in intergenic <b>promoter</b> <b>regions</b> and preferentially in GC-rich domains [...] These double-strand break sites often occur at recombination hotspots, regions in chromosomes that are about 1,000–2,000 base pairs in length and have high rates of recombination. [...] The absence of a recombination hotspot between two genes on the same chromosome often means that those genes will be inherited by future generations in equal proportion. [...] This represents linkage between the two genes greater than would be expected from genes that independently assort during meiosis.|$|E

2500|$|Epimutations include methylations or demethylations of the CpG {{islands of}} the <b>promoter</b> <b>regions</b> of genes, which result in {{repression}} or de-repression, respectively of gene expression. Epimutations can also occur by acetylation, methylation, phosphorylation or other alterations to histones, creating a histone code that represses or activates gene expression, and such histone epimutations can be important epigenetic factors in cancer. In addition, carcinogenic epimutation can occur through alterations of chromosome architecture caused by proteins such as HMGA2. A further source of epimutation is due to increased or decreased expression of microRNAs (miRNAs). For example, extra expression of miR-137 can cause downregulation of expression of 491 genes, and miR-137 is epigenetically silenced in 32% of colorectal cancers> ...|$|E

40|$|Angiogenesis is induced in {{response}} to ischemia. Thrombospondin- 1 (TSP- 1) is a potent angiostatic factor. Silencing of TSP- 1 expression {{may contribute to the}} postischemic angiogenesis. Upregulation of TSP- 1, in contrast, may terminate the postischemic angiogenesis. A possible mechanism that silences TSP- 1 expression is the DNA methylation of its <b>promoter</b> <b>region.</b> DNA methylation has been reported following cerebral ischemia. The present study aimed to explore whether methylation of the <b>promoter</b> <b>region</b> of TSP- 1 regulates its expression after oxygen-glucose deprivation (OGD) in murine cerebral endothelial cells (CECs) in vitro. Sublethal OGD increased the extent of methylation of the <b>promoter</b> <b>region</b> of TSP- 1 with a concurrent decrease in TSP- 1 mRNA and protein expression in CECs.

2500|$|As {{pointed out}} by Gao et al., the {{stability}} and integrity {{of the human genome}} are maintained by the DNA damage repair (DDR) system. [...] Un-repaired DNA damage is a major cause of mutations that drive carcinogenesis. [...] If DNA repair is deficient, DNA damage tends to accumulate. [...] Such excess DNA damage can increase mutational errors during DNA replication due to error-prone translesion synthesis. Excess DNA damage can also increase epigenetic alterations due to errors during DNA repair. Such mutations and epigenetic alterations can give rise to cancer. DDR genes are often repressed in human cancer by epigenetic mechanisms. [...] Such repression may involve DNA methylation of <b>promoter</b> <b>regions</b> or repression of DDR genes by a microRNA. [...] Epigenetic repression of DDR genes occurs more frequently than gene mutation in many types of cancer (see Cancer epigenetics). [...] Thus, epigenetic repression often plays a more important role than mutation in reducing expression of DDR genes. [...] This reduced expression of DDR genes is likely an important driver of carcinogenesis.|$|E
2500|$|Metaphase: The {{metaphase}} {{structure of}} chromatin differs vastly {{to that of}} interphase. It is optimised for physical strength and manageability, forming the classic chromosome structure seen in karyotypes. The structure of the condensed chromatin {{is thought to be}} loops of 30nm fibre to a central scaffold of proteins. It is, however, not well-characterised.The physical strength of chromatin is vital for this stage of division to prevent shear damage to the DNA as the daughter chromosomes are separated. To maximise strength the composition of the chromatin changes as it approaches the centromere, primarily through alternative histone H1 analogues.It should also be noted that, during mitosis, while most of the chromatin is tightly compacted, there are small regions that are not as tightly compacted. These regions often correspond to <b>promoter</b> <b>regions</b> of genes that were active in that cell type prior to entry into chromatosis. The lack of compaction of these regions is called bookmarking, which is an epigenetic mechanism believed to be important for transmitting to daughter cells the [...] "memory" [...] of which genes were active prior to entry into mitosis. This bookmarking mechanism is needed to help transmit this memory because transcription ceases during mitosis.|$|E
2500|$|Hedgehog {{signaling}} in {{the intestinal}} epithelium represses the canonical Wnt signaling to restrict expression of Wnt target genes to stem or progenitor cells. [...] It {{was thought that}} the Hedghog signaling pathway does this via the induction of the secreted-type Wnt inhibitor. [...] Katoh et al. searched for the GLI-binding site within the promoter region of Wnt inhibitor genes. [...] GLI are transcription factors that activate the transcription of Hedgehog target genes. [...] The GLI-binding site was identified within the 5’-flanking promoter region of the human SFRP1 gene. [...] The GLI-binding site was conserved among <b>promoter</b> <b>regions</b> of mammalian SFRP1 orthologs. [...] These facts indicate that the SFRP1 gene was identified as the evolutionarily conserved target of the Hedgehog-GLI signaling pathway. [...] SFRP1 {{was found to be}} expressed in mesenchymal cells. [...] Hedgehog is secreted from differentiated epithelial cells to induce SFRP1 expression in mesenchymal cells, which keeps differentiated epithelial cells away from the effect of canonical Wnt signaling. [...] Thus, SFRP1 is most likely the Hedgehog target to confine canonical Wnt signaling within stem or progenitor cells. [...] Epigenetic CpG hypermethylation of the SFRP1 promoter during chronic persistent inflammation and aging leads to the occurrence of gastrointestinal cancers, such as colorectal cancer and gastric cancer, through the breakdown of Hedgehog-dependent Wnt signal inhibition.|$|E
