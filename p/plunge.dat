5|$|Gannets, boobies, tropicbirds, some terns {{and brown}} {{pelicans}} all engage in <b>plunge</b> diving, taking fast moving prey by diving {{into the water}} from flight. <b>Plunge</b> diving allows birds to use the energy from {{the momentum of the}} dive to combat natural buoyancy (caused by air trapped in plumage), and thus uses less energy than the dedicated pursuit divers, allowing them to utilise more widely distributed food resources, for example, in impoverished tropical seas. In general, this is the most specialised method of hunting employed by seabirds; other non-specialists (such as gulls and skuas) may employ it but do so with less skill and from lower heights. In brown pelicans the skills of <b>plunge</b> diving take several years to fully develop—once mature, they can dive from 20m (70ft) above the water's surface, shifting the body before impact to avoid injury. It has been suggested that <b>plunge</b> divers are restricted in their hunting grounds to clear waters that afford a view of their prey from the air, and while they are the dominant guild in the tropics, the link between <b>plunge</b> diving and water clarity is inconclusive. Some <b>plunge</b> divers (as well as some surface feeders) are dependent on dolphins and tuna to push shoaling fish up towards the surface.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Oxygenation by a <b>plunging</b> {{water jet}} {{is a more}} {{attractive}} way to effect oxygen-transfer than conventional oxygenation systems. A lot of work has been reported on the oxygen-transfer by <b>plunging</b> water jets. However, {{few studies have been}} carried out on hollow <b>plunging</b> jet. In this paper, volumetric oxygen-transfer coefficient and oxygen-transfer efficiency has been studied experimentally for hollow <b>plunging</b> jet in a pool of water for different thicknesses of jets. This research suggests that the volumetric oxygen-transfer coefficient and oxygen-transfer efficiency of the hollow <b>plunging</b> jet for air-water system are competitive with other types of aeration systems. Further, relationships of volumetric oxygen-transfer coefficient with jet power per unit volume and jet parameters are also proposed. The suggested relationships predict the volumetric oxygen-transfer coefficient for hollow <b>plunging</b> water jet within a scatter of ± 15 % Key words: hollow <b>plunging</b> jet, oxygenation, volumetric oxygen-transfer coefficient, oxygentransfe...|$|R

40|$|Despite {{numerous}} works {{reporting the}} oxygen transfer by circular <b>plunging</b> jets, {{few studies have}} been carried out on <b>plunging</b> jets of different geometries, namely circular, square, rectangular and rectangular with rounded edge. The experimental study on these four geometries has revealed that jet geometry/shape has significant effect on the penetration depth and overall volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient of <b>plunging</b> jets. It has been observed that conventional circular <b>plunging</b> jets have highest penetration depth, but the overall volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient of rectangular with rounded edge <b>plunging</b> jets has been significantly higher (1. 45 times) than circular <b>plunging</b> jet for same flow area and other similar conditions. This is due to the optimal and balanced utilization of incipient kinetic jet power by rectangular with rounded edge geometry, and hence suggests their distinct advantage over other geometries. Empirical relationships have also been proposed to estimate the penetration depth and overall volumetric oxygen transfer coefficient from kinetic jet power for different geometries of <b>plunging</b> jets. The suggested empirical relationships can be useful in deciding the depth of aeration tank, determining the optimum geometry/configuration and comparing the performance or oxygen mass transfer rates of different geometries and configurations of <b>plunging</b> jets under similar flow conditions...|$|R
