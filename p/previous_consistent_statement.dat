40|$|This article {{looks at}} {{the issue of the}} first report, which {{exceptionally}} permits a complainant in a sexual offence case to offer a previously consistent statement into evidence. In the law of evidence a <b>previous</b> <b>consistent</b> <b>statement</b> is a written or oral statement, made by a witness on some prior occasion to testifying, which is substantially similar to her testimony in court. Normally, previous consistent statements are deemed to be inadmissible at trial because such testimony is considered to be self-serving and lacking in probative value. However, throughout jurisdictions following the Anglo-American tradition previous consistent statements in sexual offences are allowed as an exception to the general rule. This article reviews the history of the first report rule, including critical feminist legal critique of the rule's origins. The paper proceeds with a comparative look at divergent approaches to reform that have emerged with the rule in foreign jurisdictions. This analysis includes a review of reform proposals from the South African Law Commission (now the South African Law Reform Commission) before looking at a recent controversial case in the Supreme Court of Appeal that dealt with the first report, namely the case of S v Hammond...|$|E

50|$|Justice Kennedy, {{joined by}} Justices Stevens, Scalia, Souter, and Ginsburg, {{delivered}} the opinion {{for a majority}} of the court except for Part II-B, a plurality where Justice Kennedy was joined by Justices Stevens, Souter, and Ginsburg. The Court noted that not all prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statements</b> by a witness were excluded from the bar against hearsay evidence. The text of FRE 801(d)(1)(B) accorded not hearsay status only prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statements</b> by a testifying witness used to rebut a charge of recent fabrication. The Court reasoned that to properly rebut a charge of fabrication, a prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statement</b> would need to have predated the motive to fabricate. Otherwise prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statements</b> would be admissible to rebut other forms of impeachment, and this would ignore the common law temporal requirement that the Advisory Committee Note said was adopted by the rule.|$|R
40|$|A recent {{amendment}} to Federal Rule of Evidence 801 (d) (1) (B) expands the {{situations in which}} prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statements</b> by testifying witnesses {{can be used as}} substantive evidence, and not merely as rehabilitating evidence. In this piece, the Authors argue that the revised rule may mislead judges and lawyers to conclude that prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statements</b> are always usable as substantive evidence when offered to rehabilitate a witness. Nothing {{could be further from the}} truth. The intent, although hard to discern on the face of the revised rule, is only to allow substantive use of <b>consistent</b> <b>statements</b> that are otherwise admissible to rehabilitate the testimony of a witness whose credibility has been attacked in a way that can be properly answered by proving prior consistencies. Thus the rule allows substantive use of <b>consistent</b> <b>statements</b> when they are relevant to repair attacks charging the witness with having forgotten what actually happened or charging the witness with making prior inconsistent statements in those limited cases in which proving <b>consistent</b> <b>statements</b> could refute such an attack. Perhaps most importantly, the revised rule does not do away with the premotive requirement adopted by the Supreme Court in the Tome case more than twenty years ago...|$|R

50|$|Prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statements</b> {{and prior}} {{inconsistent}} statements, {{in the law}} of evidence, occur where a witness, testifying at trial, makes a statement that is either consistent or inconsistent, respectively, with a previous statement given at an earlier time such as during a discovery, interview, or interrogation.

50|$|Tome v.

50|$|In a dissent {{joined by}} Chief Justice Rehnquist, Justice O'Connor, and Justice Thomas, Justice Breyer {{characterized}} {{the case as}} one about relevance and not hearsay. Breyer argued that {{the timing of the}} alleged motive to fabricate should go to the probative force of the testimony, not its reliability. Breyer thought that a post-motive <b>consistent</b> <b>statement</b> could be admitted to rebut a charge of fabrication, but that the probative force of the statement would simply be diminished. Breyer argued that FRE 801(d)(1)(B) could simply be a recognition that juries can have difficulty in separating the impeaching and substantive uses of hearsay statements, and so the rule declared as not hearsay prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statements</b> used to rebut charges of fabrication. In that sense, the usefulness of the Rule did not rest on the majority's timing requirement.|$|R

5000|$|If the {{opponent}} {{shows that the}} witness made a prior inconsistent statement and implies that after that statement and prior to trial the witness was [...] "gotten to" [...] or otherwise developed a motive to lie in court, rehabilitation can be attempted by showing that the witness made a prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statement</b> (<b>consistent</b> with the testimony) before the alleged events {{that gave rise to}} the alleged motive to lie. The jury is left with two pretrial statements that are inconsistent with each other, but only one is inconsistent with the testimony, and both were made before the witness was allegedly gotten to. Thus, there might be softening of the accusation that the testimony flows from such as a bribe. Also, there is always a case for allowing a prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statement</b> made at any time before trial to help explain away what is arguably only a seemingly inconsistent statement that is subject to interpretation, such as if it was lifted out of the context that would explain the statement.|$|R

40|$|The United States Supreme Court 2 ̆ 7 s 1995 {{decision}} in Tome v. United States has read Federal Rule of Evidence 801 (d) (1) (B) {{to prevent the}} prosecution 2 ̆ 7 s offering a child abuse victim 2 ̆ 7 s prior <b>consistent</b> <b>statements</b> as substantive evidence. As {{a result of that}} decision, the statements will also be inadmissible even for the limited purpose of helping to evaluate the credibility of a child, if there is a serious risk that the out-of-court statements would be used on the issue of guilt or innocence. Moreover, after the Court 2 ̆ 7 s March 2004 {{decision in}} Crawford v. Washington, which redesigned the landscape of Confrontation Clause analysis, other avenues of substantive admissibility for the child 2 ̆ 7 s prior statements - the excited utterance hearsay exception, the residual 2 ̆ 2 catch-all 2 ̆ 2 hearsay exception, or the states 2 ̆ 7 2 ̆ 2 tender years 2 ̆ 2 hearsay exception - are all in jeopardy unless the child testifies at trial and is subject to cross-examination concerning the statement. The combination of Tome and Crawford has been a 2 ̆ 2 one-two punch 2 ̆ 2 for child abuse prosecutions. Post-Crawford is the ideal time to revive and refine Judge Bullock 2 ̆ 7 s proposal that Rule 801 (d) (1) (B) should be amended.

40|$|Agnostic {{fault-tolerant}} systems cannot {{recover to}} a consistent state if a failure/crash occurs during a transaction. By their nature, inconsistent states {{are very difficult}} to be treated and recovered into the <b>previous</b> <b>consistent</b> state. One of the most common fault tolerance mechanisms consists in logging the system state whenever a modification takes place, and recovering the system to the system <b>previous</b> <b>consistent</b> state {{in the event of a}} failure. This principle was used to design a general recovering log-based model capable of providing data consistency on agnostic fault-tolerant systems. Our proposal describes how a logging mechanism can recover a system to a consistent state, even if a set of actions of a transaction were interrupted mid-way, due to a server crash. Two approaches of implementing the logging system are presented: on local files and on memory in a remote fault-tolerant cluster. The implementation of a proof of concept resorted to a previous proposed framework, which provides common relational features to NoSQL database management systems. Among the missing features, the previous proposed framework used in the proof of concept, was not fault-tolerant...|$|R
