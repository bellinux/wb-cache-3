30|$|Twenty-nine percent (42 / 144) of {{the athletes}} were using OC from 33 [*]±[*] 32.6  months (3 – 140  months range). OCs were all {{monophasic}} combined pills but had different formulations, with ethinyl-estrogenic component ranging from 15 to 35  μg and variable progestin components: approximately half <b>preparations</b> <b>contained</b> gestodene (45.2  %, 19 / 42), followed by drospirenone (21.4  %, 9 / 42), desogestrel (14.3  %, 6 / 42), cyproterone (9.5  %, 4 / 42), levonorgestrel (7.1  %, 3 / 42), and clormadinone (2.4  %, 1 / 42). Overall, third generation pill <b>preparations</b> <b>containing</b> either gestodene or desogestrel were used by 59.5  % (25 / 42) of OC users. <b>Preparations</b> <b>containing</b> progestins with the highest risk of venous thromboembolism according to recent evidence [33] including desogestrel, cyproterone, and drospirenone were used by 45.2  % (19 / 42) of OC users.|$|R
40|$|Bowel <b>preparations</b> <b>containing</b> Sodium {{phosphate}} – a {{risk for}} renal damage? - There are several well-documented cases of acute irreversible renal failure involving renal calcium phosphate deposits after {{the use of}} bowel <b>preparations</b> <b>containing</b> sodium phosphate (e. g., Colophos®). - Neither randomised clinical nor epidemiological studies have established an association between sodium phosphate use and renal damage in patients without preexisting renal dysfunction. - However, {{it is likely that}} patients with preexisting renal dysfunction and other risk factors were not sufficiently represented and analysed in these studies, and may be at increased risk of (further) renal damage through sodium phosphate. - Recommendations for clinical practice: 1. Routine determination of renal function through GFR estimation before prescription of bowel cleansing <b>preparations</b> <b>containing</b> sodium phosphate. 2. If sodium phosphate is administered, sufficient hydration is crucial: 2 L of fluids should be consumed with each 90 ml bottle of Colophos®. 3. Sodium phosphate should not be used in patients with preexisting renal dysfunction (GFR < 60 ml/min), and in those with other risk factors (heart failure, concomitant use of ACE inhibitors, angiotensin receptor blockers and diuretics, preexisting dehydration and electrolyte disorders, old age). Bowel <b>preparations</b> <b>containing</b> polyethylene glycol (e. g., Cololyt®) should be given to these patients...|$|R
40|$|A {{clinical}} investigation with a pediculicide <b>preparation</b> <b>containing</b> tetralin + copper oleate as active ingredients was conducted and its therapeutic effect was {{compared with a}} <b>preparation</b> <b>containing</b> benzyl benzoate + DDT The study was conducted on 50 patients with pediculosis capitis/corporis/pubis; in a skin out patient department of public hospital in Bombay. They were grouped into two groups of 25 patients each. In each group, 21 hadpediculosisca pitis, 3 had pediculosis corporis and one had pediculosis publs. <b>Preparation</b> <b>containing</b> tetralin + copper oleate was effective in all the patients and one application was enough in majority of patients to kill both lice and nits. However 4 patients (i. e. 16 %) showed recurrence within 7 days of stopping treatment, which was probably due to reinfection as they {{were found to be}} cured on 7 th day′s examination. Medication containing benzyl benzoate + DDT was also effective in all cases but more than one application was necessary in majority of patients. Hence the duration of therapy was prolonged. Recurrence was noted in 8 patients within a week (i. e. 32 %) after stopping treatment. The chief advantage of <b>preparation</b> <b>containing</b> tetralin + copper oleate lies in its comparative effectiveness from a treatment of only 15 minutes duration. It was interesting enough to find this preparation effective in pediculosis with mild secondary infection without the use of antibiotics or chemodierapeutic agent like sulphonamides, in contrast to <b>preparation</b> <b>containing</b> benzyl benzoate + DDT which by itself had no beneficial effect in presence of secondary infection. However, a clinical trial on larger number of cases is necessary for confirmation...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} {{was performed on}} male Wistar rats based on assumptions that new microelement <b>preparations</b> <b>containing</b> metal nanoparticles and their agglomerates had potential. Morphological and functional changes in tissues in the injection site and dynamics of chemical element metabolism (25 indicators) in body were assessed after repeated intramuscular injections (total, 7) with <b>preparation</b> <b>containing</b> agglomerate of iron nanoparticles. As a result, iron depot was formed in myosymplasts of injection sites. The quantity of muscle fibers having positive Perls’ stain increased with increasing number of injections. However, the concentration of the most chemical elements and iron significantly decreased in the whole skeletal muscle system (injection sites are not included). Consequently, it increased up to the control level after the sixth and the seventh injections. Among the studied organs (liver, kidneys, and spleen), Caspase- 3 expression was revealed only in spleen. The expression had a direct dependence {{on the number of}} injections. Processes of iron elimination from <b>preparation</b> <b>containing</b> nanoparticles and their agglomerates had different intensity...|$|R

5000|$|Homeopathy is a {{controversial}} topic in complementary medicine research.
