Previous research in this aspect has concentrated on the tradeoffs {{that can be made}} among different revocation options. No rigorous efforts have been made to understand the probability distribution of certificate revocation requests based on real empirical data. In this study, we first collect real empirical data from VeriSign and derive the probability function for certificate revocation requests.

Based on these, we show that different certificate authorities should take different strategies for releasing certificate revocation lists for different types of certificate services. We also provide the exact steps by which certificate authorities can derive optimal releasing strategies. ...|$|E

25|$|The United States also lacks {{an agency}} {{in charge of}} diamond import confirmations, which allows traders to bypass the {{requirement}} of reporting the receipt of the diamond shipment within 15 days of the arrival. The U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) is the agency in charge of overseeing incoming diamond shipments and conducting examinations of shipments. There is also little oversight of the U.S. Kimberley Process Authority (USKPA), {{who are responsible for}} issuing Kimberley <b>Process</b> <b>certificates,</b> so no one supervises the company making sure that USKPA adheres to KPCS standards. The closest oversight comes from the Department of State, who “convene periodic teleconferences with the USKPA”. The CDTA also does not directly deal with the retail diamond sector, as the Act only applies to rough diamonds as opposed to cut and polished diamonds. While some retailers take strong initiatives to avoid conflict diamonds, many do not, so the effectiveness of the Act to completely eliminate the trade of conflict diamonds is often questioned. It has also been suggested that other countries have similarly struggled with the implementation of the KPCS.|$|R
