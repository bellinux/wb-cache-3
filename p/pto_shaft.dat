50|$|Filling a silo {{requires}} parking two tractors {{very close}} to each other, both running at full power and with live <b>PTO</b> <b>shafts,</b> one powering the silo blower and the other powering a forage wagon unloading fresh-cut forage into the blower. The farmer must continually move around in this highly hazardous environment of spinning shafts and high-speed conveyors to check material flows and adjust speeds, and to start and stop all the equipment between loads.|$|R
50|$|The T-40 had a {{completely}} reversible manual transmission, allowing {{the use of}} the full range of speeds both forward and backward. A bevel gear was placed immediately after the clutch and a mechanical or hydrostatic reduction gear, which enabled it to operate at low (less than 2 km / h) speeds. It had two <b>PTO</b> <b>shafts</b> - rear and side. These features, as well as its good performance, led to the tractor being widely adopted throughout the USSR.|$|R
5000|$|UAZ-469B - a [...] "civilian" [...] {{version of}} the UAZ-469. In this version, the ground {{clearance}} is 220mm and the drive axles use a single-stage main gear without the final drive. The 469B was available with a contact or contactless (on later models) electronic ignition system. Its <b>PTO</b> <b>shafts</b> are slightly longer than the shafts of the UAZ-469. The cabin is open and came with a detachable canvas roof; a hard-top roof made of metal or fiberglass could be purchased as an accessory. The 2.4-litre engine is paired with a four-speed transmission.|$|R

50|$|Modern {{tractors}} use a {{power take-off}} (<b>PTO)</b> <b>shaft</b> to provide rotary power to machinery {{that may be}} stationary or pulled. The <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> generally is {{at the rear of}} the tractor, and can be connected to an implement that is either towed by a drawbar or a three-point hitch. This eliminates the need for a separate, implement-mounted power source, which is almost never seen in modern farm equipment.|$|E
50|$|The {{engine power}} is {{transferred}} via dry two-plate clutch to Fuller gearbox, which was available with 13 forward and two revers gears, or 14 forward and 3 reverse gears. The gearbox features a <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> located underneath.|$|E
50|$|All ZT 300 {{tractors}} have {{a manual}} three-speed semi powerspeed transmission with three groups and two extra reverse groups, {{this results in}} a total of nine forward and six reverse gears. It allows speeds between 3,1 and ca. 30 km/h. A pneumatic two stage clutch of the type DK 80 is used to transmit the torque to the gearbox. The first clutch stage connects the gearbox, the second stage connects the <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft(s),</b> hydraulic system and the load stage of the gearbox. The load stage increases the torque transmitted to the wheels. It can be switched without having to stop the tractor by moving the load stage lever and pressing the clutch pedal. The rear axle also has a differential lock.|$|R
50|$|The unit {{itself is}} {{designed}} to independently divert the engine's power to either the axle-facing shaft or the additional <b>PTO</b> output <b>shaft.</b> This is done by two independent clutches like tooth or dog clutches which can be operated at total driveline standstill, only. Since the main gearbox changes the rotation speed by selection of a gear the PTO cannot be operated during driving. The vehicle needs to be stationary for operation therefore.On 4x4 vehicles only the rear drive shaft {{is used by the}} split <b>shaft</b> <b>PTO</b> gearbox requiring the vehicles 4x4 drive scheme to be of the selectable 4WD type to keep the front axle drive shaft completely decoupled during PTO operation.It is also possible to connect something other than a hydraulic pump directly to the PTO for example, fire truck pumps.|$|R

50|$|In farm equipment, a {{spinning}} output shaft {{on the rear}} of the vehicle is commonly referred to as the Power Take-Off or PTO, and the power-transfer shaft that is connected to it is commonly called a <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft,</b> but is also a jackshaft.|$|E
50|$|Most commonly, it is {{a system}} {{comprising}} a splined output shaft on a tractor or truck, designed so that a <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft,</b> a kind of drive shaft, can be easily connected and disconnected, and a corresponding input shaft on the application end. The power take-off allows implements to draw energy from the engine.|$|E

All the 4 components were found to have surface defects in the plain diameter region. These defects were found to be pitting and surface oxidation. The extent of corrosion was found varying in different shafts. Observations also suggest that there was relative movement between the shaft and the gear. This has resulted in loss of material at the region of contact by abrasive wear after corrosion has set in...|$|R
50|$|Jet fuel {{starters}} use a {{free power}} turbine section, but {{the method of}} connecting it to the engine depends on the aircraft design. In single-engine aircraft such as the A-7 Corsair II and F-16 Fighting Falcon, the JFS power section is always connected to the main engine through the engine's accessory gearbox. In contrast, the twin-engine F-15 Eagle features a single JFS, and the JFS power section is connected through a central gearbox which can be engaged to one engine at a time. On the F-15, the jet fuel starter (JFS) is mated with a central gearbox (CGB). The CGB has extendable pawl shafts that extend out to reach the aircraft mounted accessory drive (AMAD) mounted {{in front of each}} engine. The AMAD is connected to the jet engine by the power takeoff (<b>PTO)</b> <b>shaft.</b> As the engine accelerates to starting speed, the <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> becomes the method to drive the AMAD during flight. Once the aircraft engine has started and begins driving the AMAD, the pawl shaft on the CGB returns to its retracted position and the JFS is shut down.|$|E
5000|$|The {{basic concept}} of a tractor PTO auger is to harness the tractor's {{available}} energy by attaching a <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> to a tractor's PTO drive in order to drill a hole of predetermined size (size of the auger shaft and diameter) and depth into the ground. This in turn will provide power to the Tractor PTO Auger's gearbox. Most modern [...] Tractor PTO Auger gearboxes come standard with a shear bolt to protect the gear drive if the auger encounters an obstruction such as rock during drilling a hole.|$|E
5000|$|The Mitsubishi R2000 farm tractor is a {{rice field}} tractor {{that was in}} limited {{production}} {{in the early to}} mid 1970s. The power rating for Japanese tractors is taken from the <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> output, and the R2000 is rated at 20 hp. The engine flywheel rating is 23 hp. These tractors are overbuilt for the originally intended purpose and many are still running today on small farms. The [...] "R" [...] series included 3 models: R1500, R2000, R2500. Red and silver is the original color of all three models with some being shipped the U.S. in the late 1970s painted blue and white.|$|E
50|$|In 1938 Ferguson made a {{handshake}} agreement with Henry Ford to produce Ferguson System Ford-Ferguson tractors using Ferguson's own self-regulating three-point hitch system, {{beginning with the}} Ford-Ferguson 9N tractor. This tractor is recognizable by the blue Ford emblem {{on the front of}} the hood and the Ferguson System emblem on the grill. The three-point hitch soon became the favourite hitch attachment system among farmers in North America and around the world. This tractor model also included a rear Power Take Off (<b>PTO)</b> <b>shaft</b> that could be used to power three-point hitch mounted implements such as sickle-bar mowers. This PTO location set the standard for future tractor developments.|$|E
50|$|Harry Ferguson {{applied for}} a British patent for his three-point hitch in 1926, a three-point {{attachment}} of the implement to the tractor and the simplest and the only statically determinate way of joining two bodies in engineering. The Ferguson-Brown Company produced the Model A Ferguson-Brown tractor with a Ferguson-designed hydraulic hitch. In 1938 Ferguson entered into a collaboration with Henry Ford to produce the Ford-Ferguson 9N tractor. The three-point hitch soon became the favorite hitch attachment system among farmers around the world. This tractor model also included a rear Power Take Off (<b>PTO)</b> <b>shaft</b> {{that could be used}} to power three point hitch mounted implements such as sickle-bar mowers. This PTO location set the standard for future tractor developments.|$|E
50|$|Some {{implements}} do use plastic {{guards to}} try to keep a person from becoming entangled in a <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft,</b> but even with guards people need to exercise caution around PTO shafts when they are plugged into a tractor or truck. In some countries it is illegal to operate a PTO without the shaft guard correctly fastened. In the UK, Health and Safety Executive guidance is contained in a leaflet. The principle of how the guards work is that they are light and free-spinning over top of the shaft, so if a non-spinning object (such as a person's clothes or hair) comes into contact with them, they quickly stop spinning although the shaft keeps spinning underneath them.|$|E
50|$|Some seeders/spreaders have {{directional}} fins {{to control}} {{the direction of the}} material that is thrown from the spreader. All broadcast spreaders require some form of power to spin the disk. On hand carried units, a hand crank spins gears to turn the disk. On tow behind units, the wheels spin a shaft that turns gears which, in turn, spin the disk. As is partially visible in one of the photos, with tractor mounted units, a mechanical <b>P.T.O.</b> <b>shaft</b> connected to the tractor and controlled by the tractor operator, spins the disk. There are some seeder/spreaders made for garden size tractors that use a 12 volt motor to spin the dispersing disk and yaw.|$|E
50|$|Horse engines {{were used}} to power farm {{implements}} and industrial processes. Examples of machines that were powered with a horse engine include the threshing machine, the corn sheller, pumps and machines for sawing wood. Horse engines were modular in {{that they could be}} attached to whichever implement they were needed for at the time, preventing these machines from needing to incorporate power sources into their design. They could also be used interchangeably with other forms of power, such as a hand crank, line shaft, stationary engine, or the <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> or flat belt pulley from a tractor, which eventually replaced them. Today there are modern versions of these being built that have been used with great success to do household chores as well as power a complete Amish-run machine shop in Kentucky.|$|E
50|$|A compact utility tractor (CUT) is {{a smaller}} {{version of an}} {{agricultural}} tractor, but designed primarily for landscaping and estate management tasks rather than for planting and harvesting on a commercial scale. Typical CUTs range from 20 to 50 horsepower (15-37 kW) with available power take-off (PTO) horsepower ranging from 15 to 45 hp (11-34 kW). CUTs are often equipped with both a mid-mounted and a standard rear PTO, especially those below 40 horsepower (30 kW). The mid-mount <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> typically rotates at/near 2000 rpm and is typically used to power mid-mount finish mowers, front-mounted snow blowers or front-mounted rotary brooms. The rear PTO is standardized at 540 rpms for the North American markets, but {{in some parts of}} the world, a dual 540/1000 rpm PTO is standard, and implements are available for either standard in those markets.|$|E
50|$|The {{smallest}} are handheld with {{a hopper}} of several liters and which operate via hand cranking. A bit larger are push units with the spinning disk powered by gearing to the wheels. The next size up {{is designed to}} be towed behind a garden tractor or ATV. Very similar in size to the tow behind units are broadcast seeders that mount to the three-point hitch of a compact utility tractor, these are ideal for landscape and small property maintenance. Still larger are commercial broadcast seeders/spreaders designed and sized appropriately for agricultural tractors and mount to the tractor's three point hitch. The broadcast seeders that are mounted to a three-point hitch are powered by a power take-off (<b>P.T.O.)</b> <b>shaft</b> from the tractor. At the largest size are pull behind or chassis mounted units for agricultural use that can spread widths of up to 90 feet.|$|E

[...] PTOs remained regular options on Series I, II and III Land Rovers up {{to the demise of}} the Series Land Rover in 1985. An agricultural PTO on a Defender is possible as a special order.|$|E
5000|$|Inside the transmission, {{the exact}} point along the gear train where {{the power is}} taken off determines whether the PTO can be run {{independently}} of vehicle travel (ground speed). Early PTOs were often taken off the main output shaft, meaning that the vehicle had to be [...] "in gear" [...] in order to run the PTO. Later this was improved by so-called live PTO (LPTO) designs, which allow control of the PTO rotation independently of the tractor motion. This is an advantage when the load driven by the PTO requires the tractor motion to slow or stop running to allow the PTO driven equipment to catch up. It also allows operations where the tractor remains parked, such as silo-filling or unloading a manure spreader to a pile or lagoon rather than across a field. In 1945, Cockshutt Farm Equipment Ltd of Brantford, Ontario, Canada, introduced the Cockshutt Model 30 tractor with LPTO. Most PTOs built today are live. In modern tractors, LPTO is often controlled by push-button or selector switch. This increases safety of operators who need {{to get close to}} the <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Many {{variations}} and submodels {{were available}} on the basic series mentioned above. Some variations include- gear reducers (gears bolted {{to the back of}} the engine to slow the speed of the <b>pto</b> <b>shaft)</b> first offered in 1934, on the models A B K and Z later on I U N and WI. Designated by an [...] "R" [...] after the basic model, then a 2, 4, or 6 to designate the reduction ratio.- high speed models (higher intake capacity to run higher rpm) {{available on the}} A B K M R and Z series. designated with an [...] "H" [...] after the basic model.- light weight models (some aluminum parts to save weight) available on the A B I K R and Z series. Designated with an [...] "L" [...] after the basic model-inboard marine engines (special base, no governor, thrust bearing on pto side) available on models A B H I K N and Z. Designated with an [...] "M" [...] after the basic model. Some models also had forward neutral and reverse transmissions. These engines have an [...] "T" [...] or [...] "G" [...] after the [...] "M" ...|$|E
50|$|The {{simplest}} transmissions, {{often called}} gearboxes to reflect their simplicity (although complex systems are also called gearboxes in the vernacular), provide gear reduction (or, more rarely, {{an increase in}} speed), sometimes {{in conjunction with a}} right-angle change in direction of the shaft (typically in helicopters, see picture). These are often used on PTO-powered agricultural equipment, since the axial <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> is at odds with the usual need for the driven shaft, which is either vertical (as with rotary mowers), or horizontally extending {{from one side of the}} implement to another (as with manure spreaders, flail mowers, and forage wagons). More complex equipment, such as silage choppers and snowblowers, have drives with outputs in more than one direction.The gearbox in a wind turbine converts the slow, high-torque rotation of the turbine into much faster rotation of the electrical generator. These are much larger and more complicated than the PTO gearboxes in farm equipment. They weigh several tons and typically contain three stages to achieve an overall gear ratio from 40:1 to over 100:1, depending on the size of the turbine. (For aerodynamic and structural reasons, larger turbines have to turn more slowly, but the generators all have to rotate at similar speeds of several thousand rpm.) The first stage of the gearbox is usually a planetary gear, for compactness, and to distribute the enormous torque of the turbine over more teeth of the low-speed shaft. Durability of these gearboxes has been a serious problem for a long time.|$|E

40|$|Background: Analysis of {{load on the}} {{transplanter}} <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> {{is critical}} for optimum design of a transplanter. The {{purpose of this study}} was to analyze the load severeness of the transplanter <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> during field operation by planting condition. Methods: In order to measure the loads acting on the <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> of transplanter, a load measurement system was installed on the transplanter. A load measurement system was constructed with torque sensors to measure the torque of a <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft,</b> a measurement device to acquire sensor signals, and embedded system to calculate the load severeness. Field operation was conducted at four planting distances (26, 35, 43, and 80 cm) and three planting depths (level 1, 5 and 10) on a field with similar soil conditions. The load data was converted to a load spectrum using the rain-flow counting method and SWT (Smith Watson Topper) equations. Sum of damage due to the load was calculated using the Modified Miner’s rule for each planting conditions, and then the load severeness was calculated as the relative magnitude of the damage sum. Results: The average torque on the <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> increased significantly as the planting distance decreased from 80 cm to 26 cm. Also, the average torque on the <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> increased as the planting depth increased from level planting depth level 1 to 10. The severeness of the load on the <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> increased as planting distance decreased and planting depth increased. Discussion: Farmers should determine the planting conditions of the transplanter by considering load and durability of machine. Conclusion: The results of this study provide useful information for the optimum design of a transplanter PTO considering field load. In addition, future studies need to provide basic data for the design of the transplanter by considering the working speed and various work conditions...|$|E
40|$|With the {{mechanization}} {{of agricultural}} operations, agricultural machinery management {{has become an}} extensive research field. Sizing tractors and implements to provide the most efficient power transfer has become an ongoing process with advances in technology. Utilization of the rotational power transferred through gear trains from the tractor engine to the power take-off (<b>PTO)</b> <b>shaft</b> {{is one of the}} most efficient methods of power transfer to an implement. This research used commercially available torque sensors that were installed on a tractor <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> for measuring the torque delivered to an implement. The torque sensor was calibrated using the Nebraska Tractor Test Lab’s (NTTL) dynamometer by following the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Code 2 test procedure for varying PTO loads. The calibration of the sensor was verified using the full load at varying speeds test as described in the OECD Code 2. Tractor <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> torque values measured by the torque sensor were compared to the NTTL’s dynamometer torque measurement. Differences in torque values measured between the sensor and the dynamometer ranged from 3 to 23 N·m. Student’s t-test showed no significant difference between the measurements during the full load varying speed tests which demonstrated that the sensor can be mounted on the tractor’s <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> for torque data collection in field operations...|$|E

40|$|The PTO {{driveline}} is {{the most}} common means of transferring power from a tractor to towed machinery and stationary equipment. While equipment manufacturers install shielding to protect operators and bystanders from coming in contact with operating PTO components (particularly around the knuckle), entanglement is still a cause {{of some of the most}} catastrophic agricultural work-related injuries. This study investigated the influence of material type, material length, and angle of material introduction on entanglements with a spinning <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> knuckle. These variables were tested using a laboratory PTO apparatus where 165 entanglements were recorded during the 720 trials conducted. The results indicate that lighter materials, such as cotton thread, have a significantly higher probability of becoming entangled than heavier materials, such as leather bootlaces. Materials that were longer (i. e., extend further below the midline of the PTO knuckle) have higher probabilities of becoming entangled than do shorter materials. The horizontal path that the material traveled across the centerline of the <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> impacted the probability of entanglement. When the angle of intersection of the horizontal path of travel relative to the centerline of the <b>PTO</b> <b>shaft</b> is 90 °, or close to 90 °, a higher probability of entanglement occurs. All 165 entanglements occurred on the downward rotational side of the PTO knuckle regardless of which side the horizontal path of travel started from. The results of this study provide the first look at understanding the physical phenomena associated with the initial stages of PTO entanglements and set the stage for future research...|$|E
40|$|Polymer {{composites}} {{are today}} widely used for aerospace components {{in view of}} their outstanding specific stiffness and strength to weight ratio.
