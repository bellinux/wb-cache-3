5|$|Before it {{was founded}} in 1810 by Lewis Tregonwell, the area was a deserted {{heathland}} occasionally visited by fishermen and smugglers. Initially marketed as a health resort, the town received a boost when it appeared in Augustus Granville's 1841 book, The Spas of England. Bournemouth's growth truly accelerated {{with the arrival of the}} railway and it became a recognised town in 1870. Historically part of Hampshire, it joined Dorset with the reorganisation of local government in 1974. Since 1997, the town has been administered by a unitary authority, meaning it is independent of Dorset County Council, although it remains <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> ceremonial county. The local council is Bournemouth Borough Council.|$|E

5|$|Dalton {{applied the}} logic of abolitionism {{to the cause of}} women's freedom. She said that just as no one should be made a slave because of their race, women should not have to be subservient because of their gender. She saw the Victorian ideals for women in {{marriage}} as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> slavish subservience. She argued that since a woman loses all her property when she marries, that it would be more advantageous for her to not officially marry so she could still buy and sell land and have legal claim over her own children and her own body. Dalton also argued that new brides should be allowed to decide when they have their first child. Some of her ideas were surprisingly radical for a Mormon woman at the time, and she and Elizabeth Cady Stanton agreed that women needed to protect themselves from unjust laws.|$|E
5|$|Due to {{the length}} of time it took to build her, Wisconsin missed much of the initial thrust into Japanese-held territory, having arrived {{at a time when the}} reconquest of the Philippines was well underway. As a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> movement, the {{planners}} had envisioned landings on the southwest coast of Mindoro, south of Luzon. From that point, American forces could threaten Japanese shipping lanes through the South China Sea. In preparation for the coming invasion of Mindoro, Wisconsin was assigned to protect the 3rd Fleet's Fast Carrier Task Force (TF 38), as they conducted air raids at Manila to soften up Japanese positions.|$|E
5|$|Hill {{joined the}} Rock the Bells hip-hop festival {{series in the}} U.S. during August 2010, and as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> year's theme of {{rendering}} classic albums, she performed The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill in its entirety for the first time. She increased the tempo and urgency from the original recording, but at times had difficulty in communicating with her band. Hill continued touring, including a set at the 6th Annual Jazz in the Gardens, in Miami Gardens, Florida in December. In Spring 2011, Hill performed at the Coachella Valley Music Festival, New Orleans Jazz Fest, and at The Cosmopolitan of Las Vegas.

5|$|In 1873, Gladstone {{brought forward}} {{legislation}} {{to establish a}} Catholic university in Dublin. This divided the Liberals, and on 12 March an alliance of Conservatives and Irish Catholics defeated the government by three votes. Gladstone resigned, and the Queen sent for Disraeli, who refused to take office. Without a general election, a Conservative government would be another minority, dependent for survival on the division of its opponents. Disraeli wanted the power a majority would bring, and felt he could gain it later by leaving the Liberals in office now. Gladstone's government struggled on, beset by scandal and unimproved by a reshuffle. As <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> change, Gladstone took on the office of Chancellor, leading to questions {{as to whether he}} had to stand for re-election on taking on a second ministry—until the 1920s, MPs becoming ministers, thus taking an office of profit under the Crown, had to seek re-election.|$|E
5|$|In 1951, she ran {{again for}} city council, and was successful. The {{election}} {{was the first}} held under the city's new charter, which had {{been approved by the}} voters that April, designed to shift power away from city council to a strong mayor, something reformers believed would produce a system that would be more efficient and less susceptible to corruption. It also included provisions for civil service reform, requiring that city jobs be filled by merit selection rather than patronage. In the November elections, Democrats won control of city government from Republicans {{for the first time in}} 67 years. After narrowly winning a primary race against labor lawyer Harry Galfand, Dallas was elected as a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> wave, winning 54% of the vote in the new 8th district (covering Chestnut Hill, Germantown, and Roxborough) over incumbent Republican councilman Robert S. Hamilton (the new charter did away with multi-member council districts).|$|E
5|$|In 2005 the Defense Department {{announced}} that it would be shifting 18,000 jobs to Fort Belvoir in Virginia and at least 5,000 jobs to Fort Meade in Maryland by 2012, as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> year's Base Realignment and Closure plan. In anticipation of such a move, local officials and the military proposed extending the Blue and Green Lines to service each base. The proposed extension of the Green Line could cost $100 million per mile ($60 million per kilometer), and a light rail extension to Fort Belvoir was estimated to cost up to $800 million. Neither proposal has established timelines for planning or construction.|$|E

5|$|Of the {{military}} texts written before {{the unification of}} China and Shi Huangdi's subsequent book burning {{in the second century}} BC, six major works have survived. During the much later Song dynasty, these six works were combined with a Tang text into a collection called the Seven Military Classics. As a central <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> compilation, The Art of War formed the foundations of orthodox military theory in early modern China. Illustrating this point, the book was required reading to pass the tests for imperial appointment to military positions.|$|E
5|$|Once {{it enters}} the flat Sacramento Valley, SR 20 takes a {{generally}} straight path, crossing I-5 in Williams, overlapping SR 45 near {{the west bank of}} the Sacramento River southeast from Colusa, and then turning back east to cross the Sacramento River and Sutter Bypass on its way to Yuba City.

Within the central <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> city, SR 20 makes several turns, first turning south from 10th Street onto E Street, then east on 9th Street (overlapping SR 70), north on B Street, and east on 12th Street (splitting from SR 70).

The sport originated in Southern California, USA, in the early 1980s but is now practiced in many places with several sanctioning organizations including the Single Action Shooting Society (SASS), Western Action Shootists Association (WASA), and National Congress of Old West Shooters (NCOWS), as well as others in the USA and in other countries.

5|$|Peterborough City Council is {{the local}} {{authority}} for Peterborough in the East of England. It is a unitary authority, having the powers of a non-metropolitan county and district council combined. The City was incorporated as a municipal borough in 1874; from 1888, it fell within {{the jurisdiction of the}} Soke of Peterborough county council and from 1965, Huntingdon and Peterborough county council. In 1974, it was replaced by a wholly new non-metropolitan district, broadly corresponding to the Soke, in the new enlarged Cambridgeshire. In 1998, Peterborough became independent of Cambridgeshire as a unitary authority, but the city continues to form <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> county for ceremonial purposes as defined by the Lieutenancies Act 1997.|$|E

5|$|Several {{features}} of the tooth are only known {{from members of the}} family Dromaeosauridae of theropod dinosaurs.

Despite the resemblance, Dromaeosauroides is not considered <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>that</b> genus.
