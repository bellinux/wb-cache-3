50|$|The burden in a CT {{metering}} circuit is the largely resistive impedance presented to its secondary winding. Typical burden ratings for IEC CTs are 1.5 VA, 3 VA, 5 VA, 10 VA, 15 VA, 20 VA, 30 VA, 45 VA and 60 VA. ANSI/IEEE burden ratings are B-0.1, B-0.2, B-0.5, B-1.0, B-2.0 and B-4.0. This means a CT with a burden rating of B-0.2 can tolerate an impedance {{of up to}} 0.2 Ω on the secondary circuit before its accuracy falls outside of its specification. These specification diagrams show accuracy parallelograms on a grid incorporating magnitude and <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> <b>error</b> scales at the CT's rated burden. Items {{that contribute to the}} burden of a current measurement circuit are switch-blocks, meters and intermediate conductors. The most common cause of excess burden impedance is the conductor between the meter and the CT. When substation meters are located far from the meter cabinets, the excessive length of cable creates a large resistance. This problem can be reduced by using thicker cables and CTs with lower secondary currents (1A), both of which will produce less voltage drop between the CT and its metering devices.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: An {{important}} {{technique for}} traceable measurement of electrical current utilizes magnetic zero-flux current transformers. The technique is well established, but {{much remains to}} be understood regarding its practical upper frequency limit. Typically, zero-flux systems consist of a measuring head mounted around the primary current carrier and an electronic unit creating a balancing current in the compensation winding. In this paper the phenomena responsible for the frequency dependency of the <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> <b>error</b> in zero-flux systems in the span 5 Hz – 10 kHz are described using two-channel power measuring systems as reference systems. The aim was to find out which part of the zero-flux systems that contributes most to the <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> <b>error.</b> It was found that the error increases linearly with frequency between 22 Hz and 2500 Hz. At higher frequencies, the error passes a maximum in transition between the normal operation and the work regime as an ordinary transformer. It is shown that the electronic unit introduces the most significant contribution. A comparison is made between two reference systems using one zero-flux system as a transfer standard. The coincidence between the two reference systems is good...|$|E

The highest uncertainties, when measuring harmonic active power, are introduced by the current and voltage transducers. This paper presents experimental results which show the impact of current transformers (CTs) on the accuracy of the harmonic power measurements. An expression for the evaluation of the power error in distorted conditions was developed which can be easily utilized in the case of linear current transducers. It is shown how CTs cannot be considered linear transducers and how the higher the absolute value of the CT <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> <b>error</b> is, the higher becomes the harmonic power error. The harmonic power error reaches maximum value when the phase shift between the voltage and current harmonic nears +- 90 °.

40|$|Recently, {{the blade}} fatigue testing {{capabilities}} at NREL were upgraded from single-axis to two-axis loading. To implement this, several practical challenges were addressed, as hardware complexity increased dramatically with two actuators applying the loads {{at right angles}} to each other. A custom bellcrank was designed and implemented to minimize the load <b>angle</b> <b>errors</b> and to prevent actuator side loading. The control system was upgraded to accept load and displacement feedback from two actuators. The inherent long strokes uniquely associated with wind turbine blade-tests required substantial real-time corrections for both the control and data systems. A custom data acquisition and control system was developed using a National Instruments LabVIEW platform that interfaces with proprietary servo-hydraulic software developed by MTS Corporation.

40|$|The {{standard}} method of magnetic core loss measurement was implemented {{on a high}} frequency digitizing oscilloscope in order to explore the limits to accuracy when characterizing high Q cores at frequencies up to 1 MHz. This method computes core loss from the cycle mean of {{the product of the}} exciting current in a primary winding and induced voltage in a separate flux sensing winding. It is pointed out that just 20 percent accuracy for a Q of 100 core material requires a <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> accuracy of 0. 1 between the voltage and current measurements. Experiment shows that at 1 MHz, even high quality, high frequency current sensing transformers can introduce phase errors of a degree or more.

40|$|Solid {{state control}} of ac power using {{thyristors}} and {{other semiconductor devices}} are used extensively in number of applications such as adjustable speed drives (ASD’s), furnaces, computers power supplies and asynchronous ac– dc–ac links. These power converters behave as nonlinear loads to ac supply system and cause harmonic injection, lower power-factor, poor voltage regulation, and utilization of ac network. There is a great need to mitigate these harmonic and reactive current components. Active Power Filters are a viable solution to these problems. In this project work a three-phase shunt active filter is used to eliminate supply current harmonics, correct supply power-factor, and balance the nonlinear/linear loads. A three-phase {{insulated gate bipolar transistor}} based current controlled voltage source inverter with a dc bus capacitor is used as an active filter. The firing pulses to the shunt active filter will be generated by using Indirect current control technique. In the indirect control algorithm of the Active filter, the three-phase reference supply currents are obtained using a closed loop PI controller. A Hysterisis PWM current controller is employed over the reference and sensed supply currents to generate gating pulses of IGBT's of the Active filter. But Hysterisis current control having disadvantage like the switching frequency varied during fundamental period, this may be results in increased switching losses and <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> <b>errors.</b> To overcome problems in the Hysterisis current control, a Ramp-comparator current controller is used.

Participants were 40 licensed drivers with seasonal allergic rhinitis who were 25 to 44 years of age.

The objective {{of this study was}} to investigate the association between BIA derived <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> and SGA in advanced colorectal cancer. Methods We evaluated a case series of 73 stages III and IV colorectal cancer patients. Patients were classified as either well-nourished or malnourished using the SGA. BIA was conducted on all patients and <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> was calculated. The correlation between <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> and SGA was studied using Spearman correlation coefficient. Receiver Operating Characteristic curves were estimated using the non-parametric method to determine the optimal cut-off levels of <b>phase</b> <b>angle.</b> Results Well-nourished patients had a statistically significantly higher (p = 0. 005) median <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> score (6. 12) as compared to those who were malnourished (5. 18). The Spearman rank correlation coefficient between <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> and SGA was found to be 0. 33 (p = 0. 004), suggesting better nutritional status with higher <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> scores. A <b>phase</b> <b>angle</b> cut-off of 5. 2 was 51. 7 % sensitive and 79. 5 % specific whereas a cut-off of 6. 0 was 82. 8 % sensitive and 54. 5 % specific in detecting malnutrition.
