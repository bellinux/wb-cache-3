50|$|Phoniatrics or <b>phoniatry</b> is {{the study}} and {{treatment}} of organs involved in speech production, mainly the mouth, throat (larynx), vocal cords, and lungs. Problems treated in phoniatrics include dysfunction of the vocal cords, cancer of the vocal cords or larynx, inability to control the speech organs properly (speech disorders), and vocal loading problems.|$|E

The aim was to demonstrate the effect of changes in posture and breathing training with incentive spirometers for various voice parameters. A study was conducted which was attended by total of 13 probands from the conservatory students. The probands were divided into two groups. All underwent examination phoniatrist a physiotherapy student and subsequently got a plan to target group assignments lasting six weeks.

40|$|Introduction Subjective voice {{analysis}} {{represents a}} diagnostic tool in <b>phoniatry</b> {{and is a}} part of everyday practice if a phoniatrist has a 'trained ear'. Material and methods This clinical prospective study included a sample of 20 male patients with malignant tumors involving one vocal cord - right or left. All patients underwent otorhinolaryngological and phoniatric examinations. Subjective acoustic analysis was done when patients pronounced numbers from 1 to 10. Afterwards, voice quality was evaluated separately by two professionals using a 4 -levels scale: RBH scale (roughness-breathiness-hoarseness) and GIRBAS scale (grade-instability-roughness-breathiness-asthenia-strain). Results 60 % of patients presented with vocal cord immobility. Subjective acoustic analysis revealed hoarseness in 100 % of patients (the most frequent value was Mod= 3 intense hoarseness in 45 % patients). Instability existed in 100 % of patient (40 % moderate, 40 % intense). Strained voice existed in 100 %, most frequently intense (45 %). Conclusions All patients with glottic carcinoma presented with hoarseness, strain and instability of phonation. Non vibration of vocal cord significantly affects the degree of dysphonia, roughness, strain and instability. Aerodynamic changes affect voice hoarseness. RBH scale is simple, but GIRBAS scale described more psyhoacoustic phenomena most important in patients with glottic carcinoma...|$|E
40|$|Pigs are {{models in}} human <b>phoniatry.</b> However, {{features}} of maturation and ageing {{have not been}} considered {{with regard to the}} so-called body-cover model in this species. Therefore, the glottis of "young" (2 - 3 months; n = 6) and "old" (4 - 7 years; n = 6) minipigs was investigated. Their cranial (CraF) and caudal (CauF) vocal folds were histomorphometrically and stratigraphically analysed with emphasis on their amounts of collagen structures and elastic fibres. A dense subepithelial layer (SEL) was a distinct feature of CraF and CauF of both age groups; it was spread upon the underlying loose, flexible "cover" like a fibro-elastic membrane. The "cover" was characterised by the so-called superficial layer (SL), which was distinctly loose in the "young" minipigs, but had a much denser texture in the "old" minipigs. Here, the SL was dominated by elastic fibres in the CraF, but was of mixed qualities (collagenous and elastic) in the CauF. The structural requirements for the SL's function as a loose "cover" were thus met only in the "young" animals. A clearly demarcated intermediate layer (IL) [...] characterised by high amounts of elastic fibres (as in humans) [...] was only found in the CraF of the "young" animals. In the "old" animals, it had lost its demarcation. In the depth of the CraF of the "old" animals, many thick collagen fibre bundles were detected in a location equivalent to that of the vocal muscle in the CauF. The development of their large diameters was interpreted as part of the maturation process, thereby supporting the hypothesis of their functional importance as a component of the "body. " In the CauF, the amounts of collagen structures increased throughout the entire lamina propria, resulting in a loss of demarcated stratigraphical subdivisions in the "old" minipigs. This situation resembled that described in the vocal fold of geriatric humans...|$|E
40|$|Children with {{language}} or learning impairment and normal hearing need phoniatric assessment to analyse various communication and development aspects targeting {{the differential diagnosis}} and therapeutic indications. Objective: Characterize clinical and epidemiological features of a pediatric population treated in a phoniatric outpatient clinic. Method: A cross-sectional historical cohort study (retrospective study) was performed involving 68 patients undergoing phoniatric consultation. Outcome measures were age, gender, source of referral for phoniatric consultation, phoniatric diagnosis, mean age at diagnosis, neonatal risks, family history of communication disorders and referrals. Results: 70. 58 % were male and 29. 42 % female, mean age 6. 85 +/- 2. 49 years. 63. 23 % from external services and 45. 59 % had no hearing diagnosis. 14 different diagnoses were performed: 50 % had Cerebral Palsy, Specific Language Impairment and Pervasive Developmental Disorder. {{the difference between the}} average ages was statistically significant (F = 4. 369 p = 0. 00). 50 % had a family history of communication disorders and 51. 47 % history of neonatal risk. 51. 47 % were referred for neurological consultation and 79. 41 % for therapies. Conclusion: the population seen was predominantly male, with more complex language development deviations probably due to multiple etiologies. Many of them had no hearing diagnosis.
