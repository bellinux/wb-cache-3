She ended the song by lying face down while <b>pounding</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> stage with her fists. She closed the set with [...] "Get Up". No musicians appeared on stage throughout the show and Ciara wore a headset microphone to fully focus on her dance moves. The show lasted 45 minutes.|$|E

500|$|The weak/strong grapple {{system from}} the past games was removed from WWE '12 onwards. Characters now perform {{different}} moves based on their opponent's current physical state. Players now have {{a window of opportunity}} to attack while still in a downed state and can also interrupt moves and Royal Rumble eliminations with attacks. Similarly, the pinning meter from the past games has been reworked to {{make it more difficult to}} kick out as a wrestler takes more damage. The game's artificial intelligence has also been adjusted to prevent players from overusing the same move. In addition, the ability to store finishing moves has returned. [...] "Dynamic Comebacks" [...] gives players on the verge of losing the opportunity to successfully hit a combination of moves to gain two finishing moves. New [...] "wake up taunts" [...] bring a downed opponent to their feet for a finishing move (such as <b>pounding</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> ground before RKO finishing maneuver). Players also have the ability to target specific limbs during matches and perform submissions through a [...] "Breaking Point" [...] submission minigame. OMG! moments were introduced to WWE '13. These are moves than can be performed in certain situations with certain superstars when a finisher is obtained. An example of this is Mark Henry superplexing the Big Show, making the ring break and the match stop. Better weight detection was implemented to WWE '13, so the smaller Rey Mysterio can't body slam the 500 pound Big Show. In fact, super heavyweights like [...] now have different frames to better capture their enormous size. Pinning is now not only influenced by damage, but the power of the move that was previously executed. In WWE '13 alongside selecting arenas, characters and the number of finishing moves available at the start of a match (a new option, which can range from 0 to Infinite), players will be able to adjust a setting called 'Match Experience'. Three settings – [...] "Quick", [...] "Normal" [...] and [...] "Epic" [...] – will affect the overall pacing of a fight, independent of AI difficulty. Factors such as momentum, damage, enemy aggressiveness and even kick out and reversal rates will be affected.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Brewer, an Oak Beach resident, {{was one of}} {{the last}} people to see Shannan Gilbert alive. She was hired by Brewer as an escort on the night of her {{disappearance}} after posting an ad on Craigslist. Brewer alleged that shortly after Gilbert arrived at his residence, she began acting erratically before fleeing from his home off into the night. Gilbert was later seen running through Oak Beach, <b>pounding</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> doors of homes in Brewer's neighborhood. It was around this time that Gilbert made the phone call to 911 claiming that [...] "they were trying to kill her". However, police did not find Brewer guilty of any wrongdoing, and he was quickly cleared as a suspect.|$|E

His next victim was 19-year-old Linda Grover from Florida State University, whom he abducted from the Governor's Square Mall in Tallahassee, Florida, and transported to Bainbridge, Georgia, on March 20. She had declined his offer to photograph her for a modeling agency, after which he assaulted her in the mall parking lot, bound her hands, wrapped her in a blanket, {{and put her in}} the trunk of his car. That night, in room 30 of the Glen Oaks Motel, he raped her, and then used a blow dryer and super glue to blind her. He [...] tortured her further by applying copper wires to her feet and passing an electric current through them.

Wilder fled in his car, taking all of her belongings with him.|$|E

2500|$|In April 2014, Corbyn {{wrote an}} article for the Morning Star {{attributing}} the crisis in Ukraine to {{the actions of the}} North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO). He said the [...] "root of the crisis" [...] lay in [...] "the US drive to expand eastwards" [...] and described Russia's actions as [...] "not unprovoked". He has said it [...] "probably was" [...] a mistake to allow former Warsaw Pact countries to join NATO: [...] "NATO expansion and Russian expansion– one leads to the other, and one reflects the other". Corbyn's views on Ukraine, Russia, and NATO were criticised by a number of writers, including Halya Coynash of the Kharkiv Human Rights Protection Group, Anne Applebaum in The Sunday Times, Ben Judah in The Independent, and Roger Boyes in The Times. Writing for The Daily Telegraph, Edward Lucas [...] saw Corbyn as having a [...] "desire to appease Russia by sacrificing Ukraine" [...] and [...] said that Corbyn's [...] "anti-imperialist sentiments did not stretch to understanding countries such as Ukraine". Lithuanian ambassador Asta Skaisgirytė disagreed with Corbyn's portrayal of NATO, saying her country was not [...] "forced or lured into NATO as part of an American global power grab. We were <b>pounding</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> door of the alliance, demanding to be let in".|$|E
