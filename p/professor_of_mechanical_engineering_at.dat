2500|$|Jacot was {{at least}} partly right {{concerning}} vortices. George Vatistas, [...] a researcher and <b>professor</b> <b>of</b> <b>mechanical</b> <b>engineering</b> <b>at</b> Concordia in Montreal, {{was the first to}} discover geometrical shapes in the centers of vortices in the lab, and some galaxies have similar central shapes, squares or triangles. Spiral galaxies are, in fact, vortices. Other geometrical shapes have been found in vortices in nature: a hexagon at the South Pole of Saturn's atmosphere observed by Cassini and a pentagon in Hurricane Isabel seen in 2003.|$|E
