40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{share repurchase}} programs, which {{are subject to}} specific legal restrictions in Taiwan, {{to determine whether the}} unique item repurchase <b>price</b> <b>range</b> conveys information regarding the degree of undervaluation and future prospects of a firm. We find that the <b>price</b> <b>range</b> conveys such information, not only about the past, but also the future. Companies with a higher upper bound of the repurchase <b>price</b> <b>range</b> experience better abnormal returns than do companies that do not. The lower bound of the <b>price</b> <b>range</b> does not efficiently convey the undervaluation effect, owing to the exemption clause in the announcement. Finally, the announced <b>price</b> <b>range,</b> in turn, conveys favorable information about the repurchasing firm and is a more powerful signal of future prospects than is the legal <b>price</b> <b>range.</b> <b>price</b> <b>range,</b> repurchases, signaling, undervaluation,...|$|R

A full-grown cock and two hens, the stock with which most small {{settlers}} begin ostrich-farming, are worth from 200 pounds to pounds.

The young birds increase in value at the rate of about 3 pounds per month. The feathers are generally sold by weight; fine plumes go from seventy to ninety to the pound, and fetch from 40 to 50 pounds. The feathers of the wild birds are worth a third more than those of the tame ones, as they are stronger. The quantity of feathers sold is astonishing. One firm in Port Elizabeth often buys 10,000 pounds' weight of ostrich feathers per week.

50|$|When Airbnb {{customers}} {{search for}} accommodation, Airbnb displays per-night prices that exclude its own per-night service charges, {{and the total}} price is not revealed until the customer selects an individual property. Furthermore, if the customer searches for properties within a <b>price</b> <b>range,</b> the search returns properties where {{only part of the}} price falls within the desired <b>price</b> <b>range</b> rather than where the total price falls within the <b>price</b> <b>range.</b> In late 2015, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission took action against Airbnb for this form of drip pricing. Consequently users of Airbnb's Australian web site now see the total price of a stay including all unavoidable charges at every stage of the booking process. Airbnb continues to use drip pricing in other markets, whereby it does not allow the consumer to see the total price when displaying multiple accommodation prices simultaneously and continues to display misleading results in <b>price</b> <b>range</b> searches.|$|R
