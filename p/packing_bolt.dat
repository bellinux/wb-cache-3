60|$|One {{of these}} men was accused of murdering a woman {{in one of the}} villages on the way. His comrades brought in husbands, wives, and {{children}} indiscriminately, not sparing even the chiefs. Bimfú, of Insimankáo, was among the number; next morning, however, he threw his <b>pack,</b> <b>bolted</b> to the bush, and eventually reported his grievances to Axim. The second headman of Tumento, when pressed, managed to secure a very small load. But as payment is by weight, 6d. per 10 lbs. from the river to Effuenta, and no subsistence is allowed, his gains were small in proportion; he received for three days only 9d., the ordinary value of porter's rations.|$|R
5000|$|The SOHC 16-valve G13BB (introduced in March 1995) has {{electronic}} MPFI Multi-point fuel injection, generating [...] and 104 - 115 N·m (77 - 85 lb·ft). Later G13BBs {{have two}} coil <b>packs</b> <b>bolted</b> {{directly to the}} valve cover, although early models still had the coil packs mounted {{to the left side}} of the head - where the distributor was traditionally located. This engine uses a MAP sensor to monitor manifold pressure, unlike the G16 series. This engine has a non-interference valvetrain design. It uses the same G series block found in many other Suzuki models and so it is a popular conversion into the Suzuki Sierra/Samurai/Jimny 4WD, which uses either a G13A (85-88) or G13BA(88.5-98). This allows the engine to fit into the engine bay simply as engine and gearbox mounts are identical and both engines are mounted North-South.|$|R
60|$|It {{happened}} {{that when we}} headed into the hollow {{it was at a}} point just above where the deer carcass hung in the scrub oak. Don in spite of Jones' stern yells, let out his eager hunting yelp and darted down the slope. The <b>pack</b> <b>bolted</b> after him and in less than ten seconds were racing up the hollow, their thrilling, blending bays a welcome spur to action. Though I spoke not a word to my mustang nor had time to raise the bridle, he wheeled to one side and began to run. The other horses also kept to the ridge, as I could tell by the pounding of hoofs on the soft turf. The hounds in full cry right under us urged our good steeds to a terrific pace. It was well that the ridge afforded clear going.|$|R
60|$|The {{next day}} {{as we were}} going down a steep slope, one of the <b>pack</b> horses <b>bolted</b> and ran round Ladrone {{entangling}} me in the lead rope. When I came to myself I was under my horse, saddle and all, and Ladrone was looking down at me in wonder. The tremendous strain on the rope had pulled me saddle and all under his belly, and had he been the ordinary cayuse he would have kicked me to shreds. To my astonishment and deep gratitude he remained perfectly quiet while I scrambled {{out from under his}} feet and put the saddle in place.|$|R
60|$|The tub {{came down}} by and by, in fact, two of them, {{and those who}} had no shovels bailed up the slimy kernels with their hats and hands; but each time the chain swung through the hatch the tub below was full. It was two o'clock when they desisted, and some of them were waist deep in water then, while soon after they came up the big hose splashed in again. There were steampipe collars to unbolt and <b>pack,</b> and <b>bolt</b> again, before that was done; while when Austin came upon Jefferson, he held up one hand from which the scalded skin was peeling.|$|R
50|$|The 40TES and 41TES are {{upgraded}} replacement {{versions of}} the 41TE, which were first introduced with the 2007 Chrysler Sebring. The 40TES is used with the 2.4 L GEMA I4 engine while the 41TES is used with the 2.7 L EER V6. The difference between the TES and TE is the TES has a shallower bell housing, and the torque converter is more compact. This was done for the revised packaging of the 2007 Sebring's engine compartment. The 40TES and 41TES are also known As VLP, (Variable Line Pressure) Transmissions. A pressure sensor and line pressure solenoid {{was added to the}} valve body in addition to the solenoid <b>pack</b> that <b>bolts</b> to the outside of the case. this resulted in an additional harness connector coming thru the case near the manual linkage.|$|R
50|$|According to a {{statement}} by CIA director George Tenet in 2000, Hamas has pursued a capability to conduct attacks with toxic chemicals. There have been reports of Hamas operatives planning and preparing attacks incorporating chemicals. In one case, nails and <b>bolts</b> <b>packed</b> into explosives detonated by a Hamas suicide bomber in a December 2001 attack in the Ben-Yehuda street in Jerusalem were soaked in rat poison.In 2014 they launched the first Palestinian reconnaissance (UAV) aircraft called Ababeel1.|$|R

5000|$|Cast-on lugs {{tended to}} make unsound {{castings}} (Cochrane {{said he had}} seen examples in the bridge ruins) and had prevented facing of the outer side of flanges. Cochrane added that their use meant that columns had had to be cast horizontally rather than vertically, thus giving less satisfactory castings; and unless lugs were carefully <b>packed</b> during <b>bolting</b> up they could be damaged or strained. For so tall a pier Gilkes would have preferred some other means of attaching the ties to the columns [...] "knowing how treacherous a thing cast iron is, but if an engineer gave me such a thing to make I should make it without question, believing that he had apportioned the strength properly". A letter Bouch-Gilkes 22 January 1875 had noted that Gilkes was [...] "inclined to prefer making the joints of the metal columns the same as on the Beelah and Deepdale". Asked by Rothery why he had departed from the bracing arrangements on the Belah Viaduct, Bouch had referred to changed views on {{the force of the}} wind; pressed for other reasons he said Belah-style ties [...] "were so much more expensive; this was a saving of money".|$|R
5000|$|... 1913: [...] "Leslie and Claude Couper {{were coming}} in to take over this bush farm on Oio Road No. 2 http://goo.gl/maps/48rOh in 1913. The road only came over the hill, Kaitieke side, for about a mile and from there on {{it was just a}} track. They were coming down the hill through the bush, winding in and out through the bush with their pack horses (jogging quietly) along when they heard an engine {{overhead}} just like a motor bike coming but it was an aeroplane, the first (the very first) to fly from the North down to Marton. The pack horses stampeded and bolted - they hadn't heard the like before and of course a <b>bolting</b> <b>pack</b> horse soon loses its pack. That was strewn every-where. A crow bar here, something else there and a stream of ammunition all down the track. But most important of all - the plane arrived at its destination." ...|$|R
30|$|To {{study the}} effect of channel of size (50  ×  40) with varying {{thickness}} of packing plate were selected. The cold form sections are having thin sections and fails at the bolted connection due to bearing and rupture along with buckling. The introduction of <b>packing</b> plate at <b>bolted</b> connections distributes load over wide area of cold form channel webs and also avoids buckling of web element and hence increases the load carrying capacity of the joint. It is observed that as the packing plate thickness increases, the bending of channel at unconnected leg decreases. With {{the increase in the}} thickness of packing plate, a total of 5.8  % average increase in the strength of the each specimen is observed in 1.2  mm specimen sample. And 5.5  % of average increase in the strength of the each specimen is observed in 1.5  mm thick specimen. The above results are for the joints of three bolted connections. For single bolt connection, the percentage of increase in the joint is more due to length of outstanding.|$|R
