40|$|Scientist-philosopher Michael Polanyi has {{observed}} that tacit knowledge [...] knowledge {{that we know}} but cannot tell [...] {{is an essential part}} of scientific genius and the ability to innovate. He also observes that physical embodiments, particularly in combination with other means of communicating, provide one important means for transmitting tacit knowledge about an invention. Early in the history of the US Patent Office, a patent application to that Office reflected the need to capture unarticulated aspects of an invention: the application included models as well as text and diagrams. Used in disputes about the content and nature of an invention, models were a vital means for communicating about inventions to the public. This article considers the historical relationship among the various types of "texts" [...] drawings, texts, and models [...] that were once required for patent applications. It describes Patent Office arguments for and against eliminating models as evidence of invention, and concludes by raising questions about the potential value of computer models to contemporary patent activity.

5000|$|English monarchs granted <b>printing</b> <b>patents</b> {{based on}} the Royal Prerogative, with patents falling into one of two categories: {{particular}} patents gave an exclusive right to print a single work [...] - [...] often popular, classic works written centuries earlier [...] - [...] for a limited time, usually seven or ten years. General patents were usually granted for life and covered a class of works, such as law books or almanacs. <b>Printing</b> <b>patents</b> were independent of the private copyright system established by the Stationers' Company, even though most <b>printing</b> <b>patents</b> were granted {{to members of the}} Company. The importance of printing privileges decreased over time, but they still existed after the Statute of Anne was enacted.

40|$|Patent {{documentation}} historically {{belongs to}} the core of a library collection in the Slovak Centre of Scientific and Technical Information. It started to be built in the 1950 th and has never been stopped. Till 1993 there were collections of Czechoslovak, German, American, Polish, Austrian, Swedish and USSR patents and a large stock of secondary patent literature. In 1993 most of collections was moved to the newly established Slovak Patent Office but we continued in building and preservation of national patent documents obtained from the Office. At present, in our institution there are except of printed national patents also CDs/DVDs with fulltexts of European patents (EPO), American patent documents (USPTO) and annotations of Japanese patent applications (JPO). Other patent documentation is accessible through online patent databases. The abbreviation of PATLIB stands for „Patent Library“ and was used by the European Patent Organisation when it established a network of centres enabling an access to <b>printed</b> <b>patent</b> literature in its member states. The rapidly changing information technology and the availability of patent information via the Internet has changed the original role of PATLIB centres from providing copy and document delivery services to more sophisticated ones. By means of qualified search experts a vast number of information stored in patent literature is making available to professional and general public. In October 2010 the PATLIB Centre of the SCSTI was involved in a co-operation program adopted by the European Patent Organisation. It was aimed at reorientating patent information centres to more professional ones. The program is implemented as a pilot project in seventeen centres from eleven participating member states. One of objectives of the project was to introduce intellectual property, embed its understanding and use in various business processes, research and commercialisation of inventions and in this way foster the meaningful use of the patent system. By means of making the information on intellectual property rights more available, scientists and other professional public are learnt about the possibilities how to protect their research results. This is a prerequisite for more extensive application of IP rights which might lead to a higher number of granted patents and wider scope of this kind of grey literature. Patent documentation as a kind of grey literature has enormous importance for scientists before starting their research to find out what in a relevant area was invented or protected. The presentation contains a summary and evaluation of achieved project results during three years of its implementation.

50|$|The <b>printing</b> <b>patent</b> or <b>printing</b> {{privilege}} was {{a precursor}} of modern copyright. It was an exclusive right to print a work or {{a class of}} works.|$|R
5000|$|The {{concept of}} [...] "right of the author", which differs from Anglo-American copyright, finds {{its roots in}} the {{practice}} of <b>printing</b> <b>patents</b> and royal privileges, which first appeared in the 16th century and became common in the 17th century. The privilege concerned the publication rights to authors' works, rather than authors' rights per se. The first privilege granted in France was given by Henri II in 1551 to Guillaume Morlay, his lute player. Through this system of royal privileges, the King granted monopolies to specific editors, and implemented a system of censorship. Privileges were then very short (3 to 10 years), after which the work entered the public domain. The Moulins ordinance of 1566, the first piece of legislation to impose to librarians and editors the request of a <b>printing</b> <b>patent,</b> did not make any mention of authors.|$|R

5000|$|The word patent {{originates}} {{from the}} Latin patere, which means [...] "to lay open" [...] (i.e., {{to make available}} for public inspection). More directly, it is a shortened version of the term letters patent, which was a royal decree granting exclusive rights to a person, predating the modern patent system. Similar grants included land patents, which were land grants by early state governments in the USA, and <b>printing</b> <b>patents,</b> a precursor of modern copyright.|$|R

50|$|Starting with William Caxton's {{introduction}} of the printing press to England, Patterson documents the regulation of publishing in England and the United States. He identifies censorship as a driving force in early regulation and provides {{a detailed account of}} its impact on private copyright of the publisher's guild, the Stationers' Company. He describes the system of <b>printing</b> <b>patents</b> - letters patent based on the Royal Prerogative that co-existed with the Stationer's copyright and remained unaffected by the Statute of Anne.|$|R
50|$|John Wolfe (1548? - 1601) was an English {{bookseller}} and printer. His considerable ambition (he allegedly compared {{his attempts}} to reform the English printing trade to Martin Luther's efforts at reforming Christianity) and his disdain for the <b>printing</b> <b>patent</b> system of Elizabethan England drew the ire of his competitors and authorities in his early career. After being jailed twice and having his printing materials seized, Wolfe transformed himself into an ardent defender of printing privileges. By 1593, he was appointed Printer to the City of London.|$|R
500|$|Barley {{became the}} {{assignee}} of Thomas Morley, who {{as well as}} being a composer held a <b>printing</b> <b>patent</b> (a monopoly of music publishing). He published Anthony Holborne's Pavans, Galliards, Almains (1599), the first work of music for instruments rather than voices to be printed in England. His partnership with Morley enabled him to claim rights to music books, but was short-lived. [...] Morley gave work to the printer Thomas East, and died in 1602. Some publishers ignored Barley's claims, and many music books printed during his later life gave him no recognition.|$|R
5000|$|The {{company was}} founded in 1883 in Chicago as a lumber company by Albert Blake Dick (1856 - 1934). It soon {{expanded}} into office supplies and, after licensing key autographic <b>printing</b> <b>patents</b> from Thomas Edison, became the world's largest manufacturer of mimeograph equipment (Albert Dick coined the word [...] "mimeograph"). The company introduced the Model 0 Flatbed Duplicator in 1887. Later on, the flatbed duplicators were replaced by devices using a rotating cylinder with automatic ink feed. Basic models were hand-cranked while more elaborate machines used an electric motor.|$|R
50|$|An {{entrepreneur}} who first mass-produced steel engravings in Britain {{for the purpose}} of illustration, he was a driving force behind, and contributor to, the new genre of the literary annual. His business ventures were the first English publications (and currency, stamps, etc.) to use the new method of steel etching <b>printing</b> <b>patented</b> by Jacob Perkins. Charles Heath established his own literary annual, The Keepsake, in 1827, and tried to persuade Sir Walter Scott to become its editor. His productions were very successful, but he often had difficulty managing his finances, and in the 1840s he had to sell much of his stock to stay afloat.|$|R
50|$|Thomas Morley (1557 or 1558 - early October 1602) was an English composer, theorist, {{singer and}} organist of the Renaissance. He {{was one of}} the {{foremost}} members of the English Madrigal School. He was also involved in music publishing, and from 1598 up to his death he held a <b>printing</b> <b>patent</b> (a type of monopoly). He used the monopoly in partnership with professional music printers such as Thomas East. According to Philip Brett and Tessa Murray, Morley was 'chiefly responsible for grafting the Italian shoot on to the native stock and initiating the curiously brief but brilliant flowering of the madrigal that constitutes one of the most colourful episodes in the history of English music'.|$|R

50|$|Like many {{practical}} inventions, the Woodburytype {{process was}} built on, or had features in common with, other inventions and discoveries. It utilized the photosensitivity of dichromated gelatin, discovered in 1852 by Henry Fox Talbot, who was thereby building on Mungo Ponton's 1839 contribution of potassium dichromate {{to the list}} of known sensitizing agents for making photographs on paper. The photochemical formation of the gelatin relief dates back to the first carbon <b>printing</b> <b>patent</b> of Alphonse Poitevin (1855). The idea of washing unhardened gelatin from the lower part of an exposed gelatin layer {{can be found in the}} early experiments of Adolphe Fargier (1861) and in the development of Joseph Swan’s fully practical carbon-transfer process (1864). Alois Auer, in his 1853 book on nature printing, describes making printing plates by forcibly impressing soft low-relief objects, such as leaves, into sheets of lead. The ancient Egyptians made molds and used them to mass-produce small ceramic goods.|$|R
