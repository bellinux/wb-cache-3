40|$|Pile set-up and pile {{relaxation}} {{refer to}} the time dependent increase and decrease in the load carrying capacity of <b>driven</b> <b>piles</b> respectively. These two phenomena are governed mainly by the dissipation of excess pore pressure. In the case of pile set-up, the initially induced positive pore pressure within the soil mass becomes almost zero after some time, resulting {{in an increase in}} effective stress, whereas in the case of pile relaxation, the reduction of initially induced negative pore pressure causes a decrease in effective stress with time. For the safe and economical design of <b>driven</b> <b>piles,</b> a reliable prediction of the variation in pile capacity is essential. The researchers have tried to understand set-up and relaxation in the past, and attempted to predict the variation in pile capacity. This paper presents an insight into the pile set-up and the time dependent increase in load carrying capacity of <b>driven</b> <b>piles</b> along with some details of pile relaxation through a critical review of experimental and mathematical studies reported until recently. The review shows that the most studies are related to the set-up of <b>driven</b> <b>piles</b> because the <b>driven</b> <b>piles</b> are generally used in loose sandy and soft clayey grounds where set-up phenomenon is often observed. Some empirical relationships have been reported to predict set-up, and demonstrated reasonable success in a number of studies. A number of exploration phase field tests offering potential value in predicting setup have been identified. A possibility of estimating pile set-up during design stage with the help of relevant subsurface exploration program is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|As an {{alternative}} to conventional dynamic pile installation methods, pile jacking is an environmentally friendly technique that could become more widely accepted. Great concern has arisen over the performance of jacked piles as {{compared with that of}} <b>driven</b> <b>piles.</b> This paper describes a comprehensive field study that was aimed at investigating the differences and similarities between the behaviour of jacked H-piles and that of driven H-piles. The instrumented piles, varying in length from 32 to 55 m and having a design capacity of up to 3540 kN, were installed in residual soils whose properties are close to silty sands. The load test results indicate that the shaft resistance of jacked piles is generally suffer and stronger than that of <b>driven</b> <b>piles,</b> but the base resistance of jacked piles is weaker than that of <b>driven</b> <b>piles.</b> At a load level of twice the design capacity, the percentage of pile head load carried by base varies from 2 % to 10 % for jacked piles, with a mean value of 6 %; for <b>driven</b> <b>piles</b> the percentage varies from 6 % to 61 % with a mean value of 38 %. The back-calculated values of the shaft friction coefficient, β, were found to be in a range of 0. 25 - 0. 6 for both jacked and <b>driven</b> <b>piles.</b> A correlation was also observed between the ultimate shaft friction and the mean standard penetration test N value (N̄), which suggests that the shaft friction can be taken as 1. 5 N̄ to 2 N̄ (kPa) for both jacked and driven H-piles. published_or_final_versio...|$|R

2500|$|Prefabricated <b>piles</b> are <b>driven</b> {{into the}} ground using a <b>pile</b> driver. <b>Driven</b> <b>piles</b> are either wood, {{reinforced}} concrete, or steel. Wooden piles are made from the trunks of tall trees. Concrete piles are available in square, octagonal, and round cross-sections (like Franki piles). They are reinforced with rebar and are often prestressed. Steel piles are either pipe piles {{or some sort of}} beam section (like an H-pile). Historically, wood piles used splices to join multiple segments end-to-end when the driven depth required was too long for a single pile; today, splicing is common with steel piles, though concrete piles can be spliced with mechanical and other means. <b>Driving</b> <b>piles,</b> as opposed to drilling shafts, is advantageous because the soil displaced by driving the piles compresses the surrounding soil, causing greater friction against the sides of the piles, thus increasing their load-bearing capacity. <b>Driven</b> <b>piles</b> are also considered to be [...] "tested" [...] for weight-bearing ability because of their method of installation; thus the motto of the <b>Pile</b> <b>Driving</b> Contractors' Association is [...] "A Driven Pile...Is a Tested Pile!".|$|R
40|$|Ground {{vibrations}} {{associated with}} pile construction {{have long been}} regarded as a significant drawback of <b>driven</b> <b>piles.</b> This paper presents measured ground vibrations associated {{with the construction of}} enlarged-base <b>driven</b> cast-in-situ <b>piles.</b> Data were obtained using servo accelerometers measuring acceleration in three orthogonal directions, and at varying lateral distances from the <b>driven</b> <b>pile.</b> The accelerations are converted to peak particle velocities; the widely accepted measure of ground-vibration damage. The peak particle velocities are compared to recommended maximum values, data presented by others, as well as human perception of ground vibration. The maximum measured peak particle velocity of 8. 8 mm/s was associated with the development of the enlarged base, at a lateral distance of 3. 5 m from the pile. The data suggest that enlarged-base <b>driven</b> cast-in-situ <b>piles</b> can be used successfully in the urban environment. The measurements are, however, site-specific and should be used with caution in different soil profiles. Mark B. Jaksa, Michael C. Griffith, Roger W. Ground...|$|R
40|$|The {{design of}} <b>driven</b> <b>pile</b> {{foundations}} involves an iterative process requiring an initial {{estimate of the}} refusal level to determine the depth of boreholes for subsequent analyses.

A number of significant correlations were obtained between SPT information and pile penetration records demonstrating the potential application of the SPT.

40|$|The current {{use of the}} Arkansas Standard Specifications for Highway Construction Manuals (2003, 2014) for <b>driven</b> <b>pile</b> {{foundations}} faces various limitations which {{result in}} designs of questionable reliability. These specifications {{are based on the}} Allowable Stress Design method (ASD), cover a wide range of uncertainties, do not take into account pile and soil types, and were developed for general use. To overcome these challenges it is deemed necessary to develop a new design and acceptance protocol for <b>driven</b> <b>piles.</b> This new protocol incorporates locally calibrated RLFD resistance factors for accounting for local design and construction experiences and practices, as well as specific soil conditions and pile types. In that perspective, this dissertation focuses on the design and acceptance of <b>driven</b> <b>pile</b> foundations (predominately for bridge projects) using an LRFD protocol. A great deal of insight is gained into the factors that contribute to the performance of deep foundations by conducting an extensive literature review. The research assembled a relatively large database of pile load tests where both static and dynamic load testing was performed and sufficient soils information existed to perform static design calculations. A MATLAB® based program was developed to use the information contained in the database to compute resistance factors for <b>driven</b> <b>piles</b> using the First Order Second Moment Method (FOSM), Improved FOSM, the First Order Reliability Method (FORM), and Monte Carlo Simulations (MCS). The research also addressed a technique to update resistance factors using Bayesian techniques when new load tests are added to the database. More importantly the dissertation formulated a design and acceptance protocol that seeks to unify the level of reliability for deep foundations through both the design and construction phases. As a verification mechanism to the developed design and acceptance protocol, a full-scale pile load testing program was recommended. The testing program would be composed of ten <b>driven</b> <b>piles</b> that had been dynamically and statically load tested. It was found that, for the same required reliability level, acceptance criteria could be lowered if more piles are tested on a jobsite. Subsequently, a non-contact instrument¬-such as <b>Pile</b> <b>Driving</b> Monitoring device-is recommended to verify in situ pile capacity of each and every pile on construction site. The results from in situ pile capacity verification could be employed to update the calibrated resistance factors and to refine future designs...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{carrying capacity}} of a reinforced concrete <b>driven</b> <b>pile</b> is mainly obtained by calculating the product of its surface area multiplied by the adhesion stress between its shaft and the surrounding soil. For {{a certain type of}} soil its average frictional stress with concrete surfaces is taken equal to its value at mid depth of the pile. The surface area of a pile is the product of its cross sectional circumference multiplied by its length. Through this study it was shown that the circumference of a circular cross section is less by 13 % compared to the circumference of an equivalent area square section. A suggested star cross section has been investigated; it was shown that it has an increase of 25 % in its circumference compared to a square cross section having a similar area. By adapting the suggested star shape cross section <b>driven</b> <b>pile,</b> it is believed that its carrying capacity will be more than that of a square cross section pile by 25 %.

40|$|Through {{the past}} years {{unexpectedly}} large settlements {{of the existing}} structures have been registered {{as a result of}} geotechnical site works, and especially, due to the boring and installation of steel core piles. One of the recognized effects related to the bored piles which may lead to the settlements, is remoulding and reconsolidation of soft clay in a limited zone around the pile shaft during installation phase. The radial extent of the remoulded clay around the bored shaft remains unknown, but the pore pressure measurements from recent projects indicate that installation of bored shafts may have larger impact on the surrounding soft soil than what is known for the <b>driven</b> <b>piles.</b> During the past decades, large amount of research has been done on the effects of pile driving and axial capacity of <b>driven</b> <b>piles.</b> The research has resulted in several analytical and numerical methods for prediction of strains, stress changes and consolidation times due to the installation of <b>driven</b> <b>piles.</b> Contrary to the <b>driven</b> <b>piles,</b> there is fairly limited amount of research dealing with the effects of bored shaft installation. Through an extensive laboratory test programme, the thesis investigates how installation of bored shafts may affect strength and compressibility properties of the surrounding soft soils. The simulation of pile installation effects is achieved by subjecting different clay types to different levels of pre-straining through extrusion. The strength and compressibility properties of pre-strained samples are respectively evaluated by falling cone and oedometer testing. The same tests are also carried out on manually remoulded material. Furthermore, an attempt is made to identify the correlation between different levels of reconsolidation stresses and increase in shear strength of pre-strained reconsolidated samples, as well as volume changes due to the reconsolidation. The laboratory test programme also includes index and oedometer tests on undisturbed samples of the same clay types...|$|R
