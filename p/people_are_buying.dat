2500|$|First, in any {{significant}} economic slump, all economic indicators of output production, market sales, investment and employment are down, not just average profitability. If (for example) sales are down, it is logical that profit income will be down as well, {{but this does}} not mean automatically that lower profitability causes the downturn in sales. It all depends on how exactly [...] "macro" [...] and [...] "micro" [...] trends are related. Post-Keynesian economists are apt to point out that, whether <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>buying</b> or not, matters a great deal to the overall functioning of the economy, and matters a great deal to overall profitability. The most common fault in economic analysis is that short-term trends are confused with long-term trends, and this is often what the controversy between Marxists and Keynesians is about.|$|E

5000|$|In Australia, {{the song}} was {{released}} without {{the promotion of the}} new band member Natalie Bassingthwaighte because the band wanted to release it knowing that <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>buying</b> it because they liked the song, instead of buying it for [...] "celebrity value" [...] (Bassingthwaighte was starring in Neighbours {{at the time of the}} single's release).|$|R

5000|$|Spalding wasn't {{the only}} new {{competition}} faced by Overman. In 1896, there was simultaneously a bicycle craze and an economic slump, such that hundreds of manufacturers got into the bicycle business. <b>People</b> <b>were</b> <b>buying</b> bicycles, [...] "whether they could afford them or not". This created a massive over-production, followed by a crash in bicycle prices. Despite this competition, Overman held firm to its $100 bicycle prices, which hurt sales.|$|R
5000|$|In a 2016 Vice op-ed, Tara Joshi {{acknowledged}} that [...] "as the Spice Girls’ reign went on, {{they seemed to}} become less of a musical entity {{and more and more}} of an overt marketing tool, with Pepsi, Walkers, Polaroid, Barbie and more scoring very lucrative deals with them". However, she went on to argue that it is this merchandising success that [...] "reinforces the pop cultural phenomenon they had bestowed upon the British music industry and the world." [...] Joshi concludes that a [...] "pop act having this much sway in the products <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>buying</b> <b>was</b> unprecedented - on that scale, it seems unlikely to ever be repeated".|$|R

Its capital, Kandahar, has a public bus service that take commuters on daily routes to different destinations throughout the city.

Other traditional methods of ground transportation are also used.

To some degree it felt like we'd just been doing kind of the same thing we did last time. You just don't really want to repeat yourself in that way." [...] He also stated that touring doesn't help album sales and concluded, [...] "It seems like less and less <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>buying</b> albums, so do what you want." ...|$|E
5000|$|Social proof - To receive {{positive}} feedback, {{a company}} {{needs to be}} willing to accept social feedback and to show proof that other <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>buying,</b> and like, the same things that I like. This can be seen in a lot of online companies such as eBay and Amazon, that allow public feedback of products and when a purchase is made, they immediately generate a list showing purchases that other people have made in relation to my recent purchase. It is beneficial to encourage open recommendation and feedback. This creates trust for you as a seller. 55% of buyers turn to social media when they're looking for information.|$|E

50|$|The Kabinenroller was {{designed}} and developed by Fritz Fend for Messerschmitt AG. Fend had earlier designed and built a series of unpowered and powered invalid carriages, leading up to his Fend Flitzer. Fend noticed that able-bodied <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>buying</b> Flitzers for use as personal transport. This led him {{to believe that a}} mass-produced two-seat version of the Flitzer would have a ready market. A search for a manufacturer interested in the project led him to Messerschmitt, who had him develop the project for production in their Regensburg factory.|$|R
5000|$|Then {{we started}} seeing [...] "smurfing." [...] Remember how the smurfs were little gatherers? We started getting calls from {{different}} retail stores that <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>buying</b> {{two or three}} packs — that's the most you can buy — {{and they went to}} one store, they bought three, they went to another store, bought three. We're seeing blister packs everywhere because they're sitting in the car, they're punching the pills out of the blister packs, they're putting them in the freezer bags and they're turning them over to chemical brokers.|$|R
5000|$|Environmental {{politics}} and related concerns regarding carbon emissions have heightened sensitivity to gas mileage standards {{and environmental protection}} worldwide. In a 2007 edition of his book An Inconvenient Truth, Al Gore criticized the Big Three. [...] "They keep trying to sell large, inefficient gas-guzzlers even though fewer and fewer <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>buying</b> them." [...] For example, Japan requires autos to achieve 45 mpg of gasoline and China requires 35 mpg. The European Union requires 47 mpg by 2012. By comparison, U.S. autos are required to achieve only 25 mpg presently. Other nations have adopted standards that are increasing mpg requirements in the future. When California raised its own standards, the auto companies sued.|$|E
50|$|If {{consumers}} {{only take}} into account their own private benefits from getting vaccinations, the market will end up at price Pp and quantity Qp as before, instead of the more efficient price Ps and quantity Qs. These latter again reflect {{the idea that the}} marginal social benefit should equal the marginal social cost, i.e., that production should be increased as long as the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. The result in an unfettered market is inefficient since at the quantity Qp, the social benefit is greater than the societal cost, so society as a whole {{would be better off if}} more goods had been produced. The problem is that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>buying</b> too few vaccinations.|$|E
5000|$|Additional upward biases {{were said}} to come from several other sources. Fixed weights do not {{accommodate}} consumer substitutions among commodities, such as buying more chicken {{when the price of}} beef increases. [...] Because the CPI assumes that people continue to buy beef, it would increase even if <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>buying</b> chicken instead. However, this is by design: the CPI measures the change in expenses required for people to maintain the same standard of living. The Commission also found that 99% of all data were collected during the week, although an increasing amount of purchases happen during the weekend. Additional bias was said to stem from changes in retailing that were unaccounted for in the CPI.|$|E

The record was a hit, but Carrott always claimed <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>buying</b> it for the B-side {{and not for the}} song.

50|$|There is {{not enough}} information, nor will there ever be enough, to tell us whether <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>buying</b> cars because they are European, because they are a BMW or because they are high performance. This is a {{fundamental}} reason why RP data are often unsuitable and why SP data are required. In RP data these three attributes always co-occur {{and in this case}} are perfectly correlated. That is: all BMWs are made in Germany and are of high performance. These three attributes: origin, marque and performance are said to be collinear or non-orthogonal. Only in experimental conditions, via SP data, can performance and price be varied independently - have their effects decomposed.|$|E
50|$|If the {{consumers}} only {{take into account}} their own private cost, they will end up at price Pp and quantity Qp, instead of the more efficient price Ps and quantity Qs. These latter reflect {{the idea that the}} marginal social benefit should equal the marginal social cost, that is that production should be increased only as long as the marginal social benefit exceeds the marginal social cost. The result is that a free market is inefficient since at the quantity Qp, the social benefit is less than the social cost, so society as a whole {{would be better off if}} the goods between Qp and Qs had not been produced. The problem is that <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>buying</b> and consuming too much steel.|$|E
