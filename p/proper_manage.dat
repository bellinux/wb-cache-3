40|$|Objectives: The need to monitor, track, {{evaluate}} and <b>proper</b> <b>manage</b> adverse drug reactions (ADRs) {{in the hospital}} setting has become a fundamental component of the routine clinical practice and of the healthcare system. Computerized systems are used for such data entry, storage and further analysis with the final goal of avoiding ADRs. This paper describes a database designed for this purpose {{as part of a}} pharmacovigilance program in Romania. Methods and Setting: Stimulated spontaneous reporting is the method used for the detection of ADRs in two internal medicine departments. The ADRs collection is paper based. The information is further evaluated for various parameters and then the data is entered into the database. In the design of the database we took into consideration some basic requirements for such a database: comfortable user interface with easy access and handling, high level of security, data protection and desired statistics. Results: The database was designed in order to include a complete description of ADRs (e. g. causality, preventability, severity, outcome, type of ADR, risk factors, drug interactions). Auxiliary databases such as ICD- 10, ATC codes and the MedDRA terminology are being used. The database has been in operation for a year, during which approximately 250 ADR case reports have been evaluated and entered. Conclusions: To improve and strengthen the ADRs reporting at a hospital level we developed and populated a computer-based system for standardized collection, evaluation and storage of ADRs that could be further adopted by other academic hospitals that want to keep track of preventable ADRs...|$|E

40|$|This {{research}} investigates a metallurgy manufacturer whose {{products are}} assembled on fixed position assembly islands. The products of collaborating company {{are characterized by}} large-scale with high complexity and mass customization. With such configuration, a product is always set on one location throughout its whole assembly cycle. Assembly materials, machines and operators can be continuity sent to one location to reduce damage or movement cost. To understand the production challenges of a real-life enterprise, this research investigates production procedures of the collaborating enterprise on planning, scheduling, logistics and assembly. The management challenges of assembly method with fixed-position layout are summarized as: (1) High dynamic of material, tools and operator movement. (2) The movement of operators, assembly machines maybe expensive. (3) The requirements of assembly operators are too high to find suitable operators with low cost. The cause of current production problems of the collaborating enterprise are summarized as: (1) lack of appropriate real-time operation data capturing and collection methods (2) current visibility and traceability functions at shop floor is wasteful, time consuming and inaccuracy (3) production data can hardly be synchronized between different production unites, e. g. assembly island buffers and stock areas. Hence RFID technology is applied to solve the problems. The creation of RFID-enable assembly environment is following the AUTOM RFID implementation solutions. The methodology of deployment RFID hardware facilities and the functions of choosing production object to tag RFID tags, finding value-adding points to deploy RFID readers and building networks to integrate the RFID hardware facilities are introduced. Decision support system is developed to connect and transfer information between shop-floor execution and decision. This system guides executions and collects real-time information involved in execution procedures and converts the information as reference for decision makers. This system can also release shop-floor decisions instantly to operators. Four core components including Explorers, Modules, Services and Data repository compose the framework. These four components interrelates to each other to guarantee the smooth shop-floor information transformation. Finally, a case study demonstrates the RFID solution has been successfully deployed in proof-of-concept shop floor of the collaborating enterprise. The decision support system can <b>proper</b> <b>manage</b> the captured real-time information and convert the information into useful reference data for decision makers. As the operation processes of this case is designed strictly following the real-life operation processes, therefore this RFID solution is capable to be applied in real-life shop floor to assist the enterprise operation and management. published_or_final_versionIndustrial and Manufacturing Systems EngineeringMasterMaster of Philosoph...|$|E

The topic of my internship report is- “The Inventory Management System and financial performance evaluation of Shabab Fabrics Limited. ” Shabab Fabrics {{is one of the}} well known towel manufacturing company in Bangladesh. It is producing the quality towel products and distributed all over our country. Shabab Fabrics is renown in international market to export terry towel products. Like other manufacturing companies SFL also collect raw materials from own premise and abroad. Therefore, inventory purchase and management system is one of the significant issues for SFL. To produce their products they need more than 100 direct and indirect materials. To purchase their inventory they do some of the tasks in orderly like prepare budget, prepare purchase order then negotiated with supplier and finally purchase Raw materials. Then to <b>proper</b> <b>manage</b> of this inventory they also need to do some tasks like received raw materials, issue raw materials, finished goods received, finished goods disburse, reconciliation of raw materials and then if any sales return have. By monitoring this system, they can get proper value of inventory, though some other issues may need to consider. SFL and its group company FMYDL and their sister concern CREA use common warehouse for storage their inventory. Therefore, SFL cannot differentiate their warehouse cost; carrying costs, which mislead SFL cost of goods sold and gross profit value. They have more than 100 categories of raw materials and for every single category, they need to calculate lead-time individually and maintain safety stock, which also create obstacle for proper inventory management. Moreover, lack of proper planning and coordination and Troyee software limitation they are not able to get the accurate value of inventory and cost of goods sold. Therefore, it will be more beneficiaries for SFL if they can identify their warehouse cost separately and allocate them properly. Another most important issue for SFL is performance analysis of in every year and takes decision for improvement. To do so ratio calculation and analysis {{is one of the key}} mechanisms. To clear about SFL financial position calculated current ratio, Net working capital, Return on Assets, Return on Equity, Profit Margin, Gross profit Margin, Assets Turnover Ratio, Account Receivable Turnover Ratio, Inventory Turnover, and Debt to Equity, Debt Ratio and Fixed Assets Turnover Ratio.

40|$|AbstractThe onshore {{tank farm}} {{operations}} {{has become more}} useful and handy, {{as a result of}} increased international sea-borne trade, particularly, the unprecedented higher volume of petroleum products and hazardous chemicals traffic globally. The onshore tank farm is a facility used for safe discharge, loading and storage of petroleum products and other hazardous chemicals at the ports. It has become an important element in the supply chain system because of the increased universal energy demand and the fact that large number of modern tanker vessel is busy and efficiently moving cargo to different destinations around the world. The tank farm serves as a back-up facility to the ports. However, it has high degree of system-wide challenges of potential major incidents/accidents, as evidenced in various tank farm recorded accidents, which occurred at different times with estimated losses valued in millions of US dollars. The accidents could be catastrophic, leading to deaths, extensive damages and adverse impact on environment. To eliminate or minimize the risk of major incident/accidents, as well as minimize the magnitude and severity, it is acutely urgent to uncover and assess all potential hazards, with a view to adopt the best preventive/mitigative policy direction in the management of this strategic facility. This thesis presents multiple safety/risk assessment approaches, uncertainties treatments and decision making techniques that are capable of finding optimal solutions that will ensure safety of tank farm operations. The standard tools of analysis employed in this tank farm operational risk assessment are Failure Mode Effect Analysis (FMEA), Faulty Tree Analysis (FTA), fuzzy logic, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) and Technique for Order Preference by Similarity to the Ideal Solution (TOPSIS). Firstly, the FMEA-Fuzzy Rule Based (FRB) is applied in Hazard Identification (HAZID) and risk evaluation of tank farm operations. The methodology is utilized to discover five possible causes of catastrophic accidents in tank farm operations. The causes/hazards are described as the automatic shut-down oil safety valve failure, pipe corrosion protection system failure, automatic tank gauge system failure, leak detection device system failure, and secondary containment monitoring system failure. In the risk assessment conducted, the leak detection system failure was identified as the riskiest hazard using the Expected Utility Theory. Consequent upon the need for further investigation, another technique, Fuzzy Fault Tree (FFT), as novel model is used successfully to investigate and understand the causes of the leak detection system failure. The main aim of these two exercises is to assess risks and facilitate <b>proper</b> <b>manage</b> of these risks in tank farm operations, in order to forestall accidents that could cause damage to the facility, workers and the port environment. Nevertheless, the tank farm operations need to be optimized by ensuring the efficiency and safety of all systems and sub-systems through the adoption of best safety management decisions, which is achieved by employing AHP-TOPSIS model. This method is used to solve a complex multi-criteria decision-making problem such as selection of best Safety Control Design (SCD) among various SCDs identified. Finally, the results produced from the developed models and frameworks are summarized and other areas where they can effectively make impacts in HAZID, risk assessment and safety improvement are defined...|$|E

The antibacterial results of Nepeta laevigata showed that the n-butanol fraction exhibited potential activity (85 % inhibition) against Escherichia coli and Proteus morganii (83 % inhibition), while in Nepeta kurramensis chloroform fraction exhibited promising activity (89 % inhibition) against Streptococcus cricetus, and Micrococcus flavas (84 % inhibition). In Rhynchosia reniformis, only crude extract exhibited 100 % inhibition against Streptococcus cricitus while ethyl acetate fraction showed (99 % inhibition) against Micrococcus flavas, Streptococcus cricitus (95 % inhibition), and Proteus morganii (90 % inhibition). In antifungal activities; chloroform and ethyl acetate fractions of Nepeta laevigata as well as chloroform fraction of Nepeta kurramensis were promising; while in Rhynchosia reniformis chloroform, n-hexane and methanolic extracts were significant inhibitors as compared to rest of fractions. The fractions n-hexane and ethyl acetate of Nepeta laevigata demonstrated significant antiglycation activity with 71. 26 % and 74. 02 % inhibition and for Nepeta kurramensis 67. 24 % inhibition was shown only by the n-hexane fraction. Among Rhynchosia reniformis fractions, ethyl acetate and chloroform displayed a significant antiglycation profile with 70. 27 % and 76. 02 % inhibition against protein glycation, respectively, while n-hexane fraction illustrated a moderate 64. 06 % inhibition. In antiplatelet actions of Rhynchosia reniformis the water fraction was only dynamic against platelet activating factor (PAF) stimulate human platelet aggregation. Methanolic and n-butanol fractions exhibited potential activities against arachidonic acid (AA) and PAF while other fractions were insignificant and in platelet aggregation activity of Nepeta plants crude extract, chloroform and n-hexane fractions showed significant activity. The antioxidant potential of the crude extract and various fractions of Rhynchosia was assessed by using free radicals such as hydroxyl (â€¢OH) radical, total reactive oxygen species (ROS) and to scavenge authentic nitric oxides (ONOO-). The Chloroform-soluble fraction was noted to contain a maximum amount of poly phenolic compounds acting as antioxidants (with IC 50 values of 30. 24 Â± 0. 07, 93. 89 Â± 0. 09 and 23. 50 Â± 0. 02, for scavenge authentic ONOO-, total ROS and to â€¢OH radical, respectively) and established to be more efficient than crude extract and the other successive fractions. The ethyl acetate fraction of Nepeta laevigata exhibited stronger antioxidative profile with IC 50 values of 88. 37 Â± 0. 05 and 30. 42 Â± 0. 04, 55. 97 Â± 0. 09 for total ROS, â€¢OH radical and to scavenge authentic ONOO-, respectively. Similar antioxidant profile was observed in Nepeta kurramensis. The fraction n-butanol of Rhynchosia reniformis showed potential cytotoxic activities while rests of the fractions {{were found to be}} inactive. No lethal activities were exhibited by Nepeta plants fractions. Surprisingly none of the fraction of all three plants under investigation exhibited phytotoxic activities. The proximate composition of the selected medicinal plants was assessed and analyzed according to AOAC methods. All the selected species were found to be a good source of ash, proteins and fats which can contribute greatly towards nutritional requirements and adequate protection against microorganism and other diseases. As a result of phytochemical investigation of Nepeta kurramensis seven pure compounds (1 - 7) were isolated out of which compound (1) is a new isolate and is named as Kurramenate after the plant species name. Two known flavonoids (8 and 9) have been provided by Rhynchosia reniformis.

Risk factors for poor visual outcomes were analyzed. Of the 105 eligible patients (181 eyes), 76 had bilateral cataract, and 29 unilateral. With a mean follow up of 46. 77 mo (range 24. 0 ~ 96. 0 mo), the final best corrected visual acuity (BCVA) of 158 eyes were recorded, and 4. 43 % (7 / 158) achieved 0. 1 logarithm of the minimum angle of resolution (logMAR) or better; 15. 19 % (24 / 158) obtained a BCVA between 0. 1 logMAR and 0. 3 logMAR; 18. 99 %, (30 / 158) between 0. 3 logMAR and 0. 5 logMAR; 46. 84 % (74 / 158), between 0. 5 logMAR and 1 logMAR; 14. 55 %, worse than 1 logMAR. The mean BCVA of the patients who underwent lensectomy before 3 months of age was significantly better than that of patients who underwent lensectomy between 3 and 12 months (p = 0. 001). In the same lensectomy age groups, the final BCVA {{of the children in}} the bilateral and unilateral groups did not differ significantly (P> 0. 05). Lensectomy after 3 months of age, postoperative complications, strabismus and nystagmus were shown to be risk factors for poor visual outcomes. Lensectomy before 3 months of age, IOL implantation, <b>proper</b> <b>managing</b> of postoperative complications, early optical correction and aggressive postoperative patching of the sound eye would increase the final BCVA for patients with dense pediatric cataract...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Recent works {{proposed}} {{the adoption of}} a natureinspired approach of chemistry for implementing service architectures suitable for pervasive applications [34]. In particular, [31] proposes a chemical-semantic tuple-space model where coordination of data, devices and software agents – representing the services of the pervasive computing application – are reified into <b>proper</b> tuples <b>managed</b> by the coordination infrastructure. Service coordination is enacted by chemical-like reactions that semantically match those tuples accordingly enacting the desired interaction patterns (composition, aggregation, competition, contextualisation, diffusion and decay). After showing and motivating the proposed coordination approach for situated, adaptive, and diversity-accomodating pervasive computing systems, in this paper we outline how it is possible to concretise the approach on the TuCSoN coordination infrastructure, which can been suitably enhanced with modules supporting fuzzy semantic-coordination and execution engine for chemical-inspired coordination laws.

40|$|Raising a home flock for {{the primary}} purpose of {{producing}} fresh eggs can be a rewarding and challenging venture. The main goal for egg producers is to ensure that their hens continue to produce eggs year-round. To accomplish this goal, {{one of the most important}} factors to consider, next to the overall health and nutrition of the flock, is lighting. This NebGuide discusses what a producer must do to <b>manage</b> <b>proper</b> lighting for the home laying flock...|$|R

Some Phomopsis resistance hybrids are available in Europe where the disease is particularly severe. There are no commercial hybrids available in US which are resistant. There are several methods that can be employed to control this disease, some of which are discussed below: ...|$|R
