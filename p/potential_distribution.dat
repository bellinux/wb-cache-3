He hired Tommy Moore and Casey Donovan for the third segment, Inside. When Fisk's scene partner from Bayside heard about the <b>potential</b> <b>distribution</b> deal, he refused to sign release forms until he was guaranteed 20% of the profits. Instead, Poole decided to scrap the segment and re-shoot with Fisk and Donovan. The resulting footage was so good that Poole decided to use Donovan for the second segment as well, entitled Poolside, and construct the loose storyline around him. The three segments were filmed on a budget of $8,000 over three successive weekends in August 1971 in the gay resort area of Cherry Grove, New York, on Fire Island.|$|E

The magnitude of the noise was 20, 40 and 80 % that of the analytic <b>potential</b> <b>distributions.</b> Performance of the regularization techniques was evaluated by computing the root mean square error (RMSE) between regularized RL estimates and analytic surface Laplacian solutions. The actual EEG data were human movement-related and short-latency somatosensory-evoked potentials. The RL of these potentials was estimated over a realistically-shaped, magnetic resonance-constructed model of the subject's scalp surface. The RL estimate of the simulated <b>potential</b> <b>distributions</b> was improved with all the regularization techniques. However, the λ correction and Tikhonov regularization techniques provided more precise Laplacian solutions than the GCV computation (P < 0. 05); they also improved better than the GCV computation the spatial detail of the movement- related and short-latency somatosensory-evoked <b>potential</b> <b>distributions.</b> For both simulated and actual EEG <b>potential</b> <b>distributions</b> the Tikhonov and λ correction techniques provided nearly equal Laplacian solutions, but the former offered the advantage that no preliminary simulation was required to regularize the RL estimate of the actual EEG data...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the effect of different conductivity values on epicardial surface <b>potential</b> <b>distributions</b> on a slab of cardiac tissue. The study was motivated by the large variation in published bidomain conductivity parameters available in the literature. Simulations presented are based on a previously published bidomain model and solution technique which includes fiber rotation. Three sets of conductivity parameters are considered and an alternative set of nondimensional parameters relating the tissue conductivities to blood conductivity is introduced. These nondimensional parameters are then used to study the relative effect of blood conductivity on the epicardial <b>potential</b> <b>distributions.</b> Each set of conductivity parameters gives rise to a distinct set of epicardial <b>potential</b> <b>distributions,</b> both in terms of morphology and magnitude.

40|$|In {{this study}} various {{electrical}} conductivity approximations used in bidomain models of cardiac tissue are considered. Comparisons {{are based on}} epicardial surface <b>potential</b> <b>distributions</b> arising from regions of subendocardial ischaemia situated within the cardiac tissue. Approximations studied are a single conductivity bidomain model, an isotropic bidomain model and equal and reciprocal anisotropy ratios both with and without fibre rotation. It is demonstrated both analytically and numerically that the approximations involving a single conductivity bidomain, an isotropic bidomain or equal anisotropy ratios (ignoring fibre rotation) results in identical epicardial <b>potential</b> <b>distributions</b> for all degrees of subendocardial ischaemia. This result is contrary to experimental observations. It is further shown that by assuming reciprocal anisotropy ratios, epicardial <b>potential</b> <b>distributions</b> vary with the degree of subendocardial ischaemia.

The potentials in the walls of both ventricles were more positive in the outer layers and more negative in the inner layers, a gradient similar to normal. A maximum initially was at the ectopic site with a magnitude greater than that of the minimum, but the maximum subsequently decreased in magnitude and shifted toward the minimum while the minimum increased in magnitude.

ABSTRACT We have developed computer algorithms that enable epicardial <b>potential</b> <b>distributions</b> to be calculated from electrocardiographic body surface data. To validate this inverse transformation we obtained body surface maps during the ST segment in 55 patients with acute infarction who subsequently underwent coronary arteriography and we constructed epicardial ST segment <b>potential</b> <b>distributions</b> for each patient. From the unlabeled epicardial maps one of us predicted the coronary artery that would be found {{to be involved in}} the infarction. These predictions were compared with the results of coronary arteriography and this showed that the analysis of the epicardial map correctly predicted the coronary artery involved in 40 of 55 patients (72. 7 %). In another eight patients the anatomy was partially predicted. In the 15 patients in whom the prediction was incorrect or partially correct (27. 3 %), 11 had critical disease or occlusions of the predicted coronary artery but the infarct-related artery was incorrectly identified.

40|$|Previous {{work has}} shown that {{variations}} in cardiac conductivity values have significant effects on the resulting epicardial <b>potential</b> <b>distributions</b> arising from subendocardial ischaemia. This work carries on from a previous study in this area by allowing for variation in (the more physiologically realistic) six, rather than four, conductivity values. This is achieved by relaxing the usual assumption that the cardiac conductivity values in both normal directions, one normal to the fibres within the sheet and the other normal to the sheet, are equal. An extended non-dimensional formulation is derived for the passive bidomain equation, leading to a normal direction dimensionless conductivity ratio, {{in addition to the}} previously found ratios in the transverse and longitudinal directions. Two six-conductivity datasets are used to set up a parameter space for the above ratios, from which epicardial <b>potential</b> <b>distributions</b> are derived and compared. Results from this study appear to support the conclusions of the previous four-conductivity study; that is, differences in epicardial <b>potential</b> <b>distributions</b> are best explained by variations in the ratio of the intracellular longitudinal conductivity to the intracellular transverse conductivity.

40|$|SUMMARY Total {{body surface}} <b>potential</b> <b>distributions</b> were {{recorded}} from 20 normal young adults, 20 - 35 years old, during multistage maximal exercise testing {{on a bicycle}} ergometer. Using a system for measuring total body surface <b>potential</b> <b>distributions</b> from measurements at 24 locations, high-quality potential maps were obtained during exercise without requiring wave form averaging or special modes of exercise. Serial maps recorded at 1 -msec intervals throughout QRS-T during exercise and during recovery from exercise were com-pared with corresponding maps recorded with the subjects at rest. During and after exercse, consistent changes appeared in the map patterns during early QRS and the ST segment and in {{the magnitude of the}} T-wave poten-tials. Increases in QRS duration (0 - 10 msec) also appeared during exercise. The changes in map patterns dur-ing early QRS in exercise strongly suggested changes in the initial sequence of activation in the ventrides.
