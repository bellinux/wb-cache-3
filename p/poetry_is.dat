5|$|Bleecker's {{pastoral}} <b>poetry</b> <b>is</b> {{studied by}} historians to gain perspective {{of life on}} the front lines of the revolution, and her novel Maria Kittle, the first known Captivity novel, set the form for subsequent Indian Capture novels which saw great popularity after her death.|$|E
5|$|Eliot's <b>poetry</b> <b>is</b> {{filled with}} {{religious}} images beyond those common to Christianity: the Four Quartets brings in Hindu stories {{with a particular}} emphasis on the Bhagavad-Gita of the Mahabharata. Eliot {{went so far as}} to mark where he alludes to Hindu stories in his editions of the Mahabharata by including a page added which compared battle scenes with The Dry Salvages.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Poetry</b> <b>was</b> {{used for}} all purposes. A great deal of 17th- and 18th-century <b>poetry</b> <b>was</b> [...] "occasional", written to {{celebrate}} a particular event (a marriage, birth, military victory) or to solemnize a tragic occurrence (a death, military defeat), {{and this kind of}} <b>poetry</b> <b>was</b> frequent with gentlemen in the service of a noble or the king. <b>Poetry</b> <b>was</b> the chief form of 17th century theater: the vast majority of scripted plays were written in verse (see [...] "Theater" [...] below). <b>Poetry</b> <b>was</b> used in satires (Nicolas Boileau-Despréaux is famous for his [...] "Satires" [...] (1666)) and in epics (inspired by the Renaissance epic tradition and by Tasso) like Jean Chapelain's La Pucelle.|$|R
25|$|In {{this time}} the {{imperial}} court patronized the poets, {{most of whom were}} courtiers or ladies-in-waiting. Editing anthologies of <b>poetry</b> <b>was</b> a national pastime. Reflecting the aristocratic atmosphere, the <b>poetry</b> <b>was</b> elegant and sophisticated and expressed emotions in a rhetorical style.|$|R
5|$|In {{addition}} to specific forms of poems, <b>poetry</b> <b>is</b> {{often thought of}} in terms of different genres and subgenres. A poetic genre is generally a tradition or classification of poetry based on the subject matter, style, or other broader literary characteristics. Some commentators view genres as natural forms of literature. Others view the study of genres as the study of how different works relate and refer to other works.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} famous poet in this type of <b>poetry</b> <b>is</b> Hafez. Themes of his Ghazal is exposing hypocrisy. His life and poems {{have been the subject of}} much analysis, {{commentary}} and interpretation, influencing post-fourteenth century Persian writing more than any other author. West-östlicher Diwan of Johann Wolfgang von Goethe that is a collection of lyrical poems, has been inspired by the Persian poet Hafez.|$|E
5|$|Ahmad Karimi-Hakkak of the University of Maryland {{discusses}} how {{one aspect}} of Kiarostami's cinematic style {{is that he is}} able to capture essences of Persian poetry and create poetic imagery within the landscape of his films. In Where Is the Friend's Home? and The Wind Will Carry Us, classical Persian <b>poetry</b> <b>is</b> directly quoted in the film, highlighting the artistic link and intimate connection between them. This in turn reflects on the connection between the past and present, between continuity and change.|$|E

In 1974, his <b>poetry</b> <b>was</b> published as Cape Drives, a collection of original prose. Hope's first novel, A Separate Development, was published in 1981. The novel was banned in South Africa for its overt criticisms of the Apartheid government.|$|R
2500|$|Because {{of the new}} {{conception}} of l'honnête homme (the honest or upright man), poetry {{became one of the}} principal genres of literary production of noble gentlemen and the non-noble professional writers in their patronage during the 17th century. <b>Poetry</b> <b>was</b> used for all purposes. [...] A great deal of 17th- and 18th-century <b>poetry</b> <b>was</b> [...] "occasional", meaning that it was written to celebrate a particular event (a marriage, birth or a military victory) or to solemnize a tragic occurrence (a death or a military defeat); this type of <b>poetry</b> <b>was</b> favored by gentlemen in the service of a noble or the king.

50|$|Oral <b>poetry</b> <b>was</b> {{the most}} popular art form among Bedouins. Having a poet in one's tribe was highly {{regarded}} in society. In addition to serving {{as a form of}} art, <b>poetry</b> <b>was</b> used as a means of conveying information and social control.|$|R
5|$|At {{one point}} in the poem, Eliot used terza rima rhyme {{in a manner similar to}} Dante. In a 1950 lecture, he {{discussed}} how he imitated Dante within Little Gidding and the challenges that this presented. The lecture also dwelt on keeping to a set form and how Dante's <b>poetry</b> <b>is</b> the model for religious poetry and poetry in general. Besides Dante, many of the images used in Little Gidding were allusions to Eliot's earlier poems, especially the other poems of the Four Quartets.|$|E
5|$|Critics who {{admire his}} middle work might {{characterize}} it as supple and muscular in its rhythms and sometimes harshly modernist, while others find these poems barren and weak in imaginative power. Yeats's later work found new imaginative inspiration in the mystical system {{he began to}} work out for himself {{under the influence of}} spiritualism. In many ways, this <b>poetry</b> <b>is</b> a return to the vision of his earlier work. The opposition between the worldly minded man of the sword and the spiritually minded man of God, the theme of The Wanderings of Oisin, is reproduced in A Dialogue Between Self and Soul.|$|E
5|$|Dramatic <b>poetry</b> <b>is</b> drama {{written in}} verse to be spoken or sung, and appears in varying, {{sometimes}} related forms in many cultures. Greek tragedy in verse {{dates to the}} 6th century B.C., {{and may have been}} an influence on the development of Sanskrit drama, just as Indian drama in turn appears to have influenced the development of the bianwen verse dramas in China, forerunners of Chinese Opera. East Asian verse dramas also include Japanese Noh. Examples of dramatic poetry in Persian literature include Nizami's two famous dramatic works, Layla and Majnun and Khosrow and Shirin, Ferdowsi's tragedies such as Rostam and Sohrab, Rumi's Masnavi, Gorgani's tragedy of Vis and Ramin, and Vahshi's tragedy of Farhad.|$|E

50|$|Giorno {{believed}} that, at this level, <b>poetry</b> <b>was</b> running behind.

5|$|In his Poetics, Aristotle {{points to}} the ″voice of the shuttle″ in Sophocles′ tragedy Tereus {{as an example of}} a poetic device that aids in the ″recognition″—the change from ignorance to knowledge—of what has {{happened}} earlier in the plot. Such a device, according to Aristotle, is ″contrived″ by the poet, and thus is ″inartistic.″. The connection between the nightingale's song and <b>poetry</b> <b>is</b> evoked by Aristophanes in his comedy The Birds and in the poetry of Callimachus. Roman poet Virgil compares the mourning of Orpheus for Eurydice to the “lament of the nightingale”.|$|E
5|$|<b>Poetry</b> <b>is</b> often {{separated}} into lines on a page. These lines may {{be based on}} the number of metrical feet, or may emphasize a rhyming pattern at the ends of lines. Lines may serve other functions, particularly where the poem is not written in a formal metrical pattern. Lines can separate, compare or contrast thoughts expressed in different units, or can highlight a change in tone. See the article on line breaks for information about the division between lines.|$|E
5|$|Sappho was a {{prolific}} poet, probably composing around 10,000 lines. Her poetry was well-known and greatly admired {{through much of}} antiquity, and she was among the canon of nine lyric poets most highly esteemed by scholars of Hellenistic Alexandria. Today, most of Sappho's <b>poetry</b> <b>is</b> lost, {{but it is still}} considered extraordinary, and her works have continued to influence other writers up until the modern day. Beyond her poetry, she is well known as a symbol of love and desire between women.|$|E

5|$|The form of {{this ancient}} Greek <b>poetry</b> <b>is</b> an elegiac couplet, {{commonly}} used for epitaphs. Some English renderings are given in the table below. It is also an example of Laconian brevity, a spartan style of verse that allows for varying interpretations {{of the meaning of}} the poem. Ioannis Ziogas points out that the usual English translations are far from the only interpretation possible, and indicate much about the romantic tendencies of the translators.|$|E
5|$|Ebner has {{additionally}} written narrative fiction (novels, short stories, short prose), {{essays and}} poems. His <b>poetry</b> <b>is</b> written in German and Catalan. Supported by a subsidy for literature from the Austrian government, {{he went to}} Andorra in 2007 to write an essay about {{the country in the}} Pyrenees. He also translated the novel L'Absent written by the Catalan author Josep Navarro Santaeulàlia, into German. Ebner's cultural essays about Catalan culture, such as that of Barcelona and Andorra, have been published by the magazines Literatur und Kritik and Zitig. His first collection of short stories, Lose (Destinies), was published in 2007. Of its 45 stories, twenty-two had already been printed in newspapers, literary magazines or anthologies. In 2008, Ebner published two other books of narrative fiction, among them the short novel Hominide.|$|E
5|$|Epic <b>poetry</b> <b>is</b> a {{genre of}} poetry, {{and a major}} form of {{narrative}} literature. This genre is often defined as lengthy poems concerning events of a heroic or important nature {{to the culture of}} the time. It recounts, in a continuous narrative, the life and works of a heroic or mythological person or group of persons. Examples of epic poems are Homer's Iliad and Odyssey, Virgil's Aeneid, the Nibelungenlied, Luís de Camões' Os Lusíadas, the Cantar de Mio Cid, the Epic of Gilgamesh, the Mahabharata, Valmiki's Ramayana, Ferdowsi's Shahnama, Nizami (or Nezami)'s Khamse (Five Books), and the Epic of King Gesar. While the composition of epic poetry, and of long poems generally, became less common in the west after the early 20th century, some notable epics have continued to be written. Derek Walcott won a Nobel prize to a great extent {{on the basis of his}} epic, Omeros.|$|E

5|$|In Bulgarian and South Slavic {{folklore}} in general, Momchil is glorified {{in numerous}} songs and epic tales as a brigand, {{defender of the}} people and a prominent fighter against the Turks. Indeed, some of the earliest heroic songs in Bulgarian folklore tradition deal with Momchil's exploits. In some folklore material, Momchil, referred to as a duke, acts as the uncle of Prince Marko, another legendary figure who in epic <b>poetry</b> <b>is</b> a fighter against the Turks. In the folklore version of Momchil's last battle, his wife, and not the citizens of Peritheorion, betrays him and is to blame for his death. On the other hand, Momchil's legendary sister Yevrosima is described as the mother of Prince Marko as well as a major influence on him.|$|E
5|$|In his youth, Stojanović wrote poems, {{only one}} of which is published—in a 1918 issue of the {{literary}} magazine Književni jug, whose editor was future Nobel Prize winner Ivo Andrić. For this poem, Stojanović was inspired by the Serbian epic hero Ailing Dojčin. A number of Stojanović's poems are preserved in a notebook that belonged to his closest school friend Todor Ilić. According to the poet Dragan Kolundžija, Stojanović's poems are lyrical miniatures composed in free verse, focused on man and nature, and filled with melancholy. Kolundžija finds that what inspired Stojanović to write <b>poetry</b> <b>is</b> reflected in his verse Krvav je bol (Pain is bloody). According to poet Miroslav Feldman, who first met Stojanović in 1919 in Zagreb, his poems were sad and permeated with a yearning for a brighter, more joyous life.|$|E
5|$|In {{one of the}} interludes of The Loves of the Plants, {{the voice}} of the Poet, which would seem to be Darwin's voice as well, argues that <b>poetry</b> <b>is</b> meant to appeal to the senses, {{particularly}} vision. Darwin's primary tool for accomplishing this was personification. Darwin's personifications were often based on the classical allusions embedded with Linnaeus's own naming system. However, they were not meant to conjure up images of gods or heroes; rather, the anthropomorphized images of the plants depict more ordinary images. They also stimulate the readers' imaginations to assist them in learning the material and allow Darwin to argue that the plants he is discussing are animate, living things—just like humans. Darwin's use of personification suggests that plants are more akin to humans than the reader might at first assume; his emphasis on the continuities between mankind and plantkind contributes to the evolutionary theme that runs throughout the poem.|$|E
