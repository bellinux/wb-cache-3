50|$|Calcium nitrate {{is used in}} {{waste water}} <b>pre-conditioning</b> for odour {{emission}} prevention. The waste water <b>pre-conditioning</b> is based on establishing an anoxic biology in the waste water system. In the presence of nitrate, the metabolism for sulfates stops, thus preventing formation of hydrogen sulphide. Additionally easy degradable organic matter is consumed, which otherwise can cause anaerobic conditions downstream as well as odour emissions itself. The concept is also applicable for surplus sludge treatment.|$|E

This study was performed on 30 male wistar rats. Ischemic <b>pre-conditioning</b> of liver was performed by first clamping of the hepatic pedicle for 10 minutes. Following this, ischemia-reperfusion of the pancreas was performed by first clam-ping the inferior splenic artery for 30 minutes, followed by reperfusion for one hour. The rats were divided into three groups (10 rats in each group). Group-One was the sham operated group, without clamping of any artery. Group-two developed ischemia-reperfusion-induced pancreatitis, without ischemic <b>pre-conditioning</b> of the liver, while Group-three underwent ischemic <b>pre-conditioning</b> of the liver followed by ischemia-reperfusion of the pancreas. Ischemic <b>pre-conditioning,</b> applied prior to induction of pancreatitis, caused a reduction in plasma lipase, plasma interleukin- 1 &# 946; and histological signs of pancreatic damage, but plasma interleukin- 10 levels were not significantly different between the three groups. Ischemic <b>pre-conditioning</b> of the liver did not cause any alteration of the liver enzymes.

40|$|In this project, the {{prolonged}} neuroprotective effect of volatile anaesthetics {{was investigated in}} male Wistar-rats. The animals were pretreated with halothane or isoflurane in normal air (1, 2 % and 1, 4 %, respectively). Because {{of changes in the}} blood-gases in the halothane group, a third group was treated with halothane in addition with 10 % oxygen. 24 hours after the <b>pre-conditioning</b> phase, an occlusion of the arteria media was performed. Four days later, the volume of the infarction was evaluated. Preconditioning with isoflurane and with the mixture of halothane and oxygen significantly reduced the infarct volumes compared with the control group. Treatment with halothane was not associated with a significant reduction of infarction. The neuroprotective effect of isoflurane was detectable directly after the <b>pre-conditioning</b> and was significant until 24 hours after <b>pre-conditioning.</b> Homogenated neocortical areas of rats were investigated for the expression of inducible NO synthetase (iNOS) by western-blot analysis.

40|$|SummaryRemote ischemic <b>pre-conditioning</b> (rIPC) {{has emerged}} as a {{potential}} mechanism to reduce ischemia-reperfusion injury. Clinical data, however, have been mixed, and its physiological basis remains unclear, although it appears to involve release of circulating factor(s) and/or neural pathways. Here, the authors demonstrate that adenosine receptor activation is an important step in initiating human pre-conditioning; that <b>pre-conditioning</b> liberates circulating cardioprotective factor(s); and that exogenous adenosine infusion is able to recapitulate release of this factor. However, blockade of adenosine receptors in ischemic tissue does not block the protection afforded by <b>pre-conditioning.</b> These data have important implications for defining the physiology of human <b>pre-conditioning</b> and its translation to future clinical trials...|$|E

40|$|Background: Polymerization of resin-modified glass-ionomers (RMGIs) is {{mediated}} through two competing mechanisms: An acid-base reaction and a light-dependent resin polymerization. Furthermore, <b>pre-conditioning</b> with acid {{has resulted in}} an increase in enamel bond strength of some RMGIs. This in vitro study evaluated the effect of <b>pre-conditioning</b> and/or delayed irradiation on bond strength of three RMGIs to enamel. Materials and Methods: In this in vitro study, 144 flat enamel surfaces of human molars were ground using consecutively finer abrasives up to 600 -grit silicon carbide paper. Each surface was rinsed and gently air-dried (n = 12). The RMGIs (Fuji II LC Improved; Ionolux and Vitremer) were bonded to enamel surfaces using the following protocols: Groups 1 : Based on manufacturers′ instructions; Groups 2 : <b>Pre-conditioning</b> with phosphoric acid for 30 s; groups 3 : A 2 -min delay in irradiation; groups 4 : <b>Pre-conditioning</b> with acid for 30 s plus a 2 -min delay in light activation. After 24 -h storage at 37 °C and 500 rounds of thermocycling, the samples underwent shear bond strength (SBS) test. Data was analyzed with 3 -way ANOVA and Tukey HSD test (α = 0. 05). Results: There were significant differences between the study groups (P < 0. 001). Acid-pre-conditioning increased Fuji II LC SBS values; it significantly decreased SBS values of Vitremer but had no effect on SBS values of Ionolux. Ionolux and Vitremer exhibited decreased enamel bond strength after a delay in light activation (P < 0. 05). A 2 -min delay in light activation combined with acid <b>pre-conditioning</b> increased RMGI SBS values only for Fuji II LC. Conclusion: Within the limitations of the present study, the effect of acid <b>pre-conditioning,</b> delaying irradiation and both on enamel bond strength of RMGIs was material-dependent.

Therefore,the main {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate the effect of exercise <b>pre-conditioning</b> on apoptosis-related proteins expression in hippocampal CA 1 neurons after induction of ischemia. Methods: 21 Male rats weighing 260 - 300 g were randomly allocated into three groups. Sham operated group, ischemia group and exercise+ischemia group. Ischemia was induced by the occlusion of both common carotid arteries (CCA) for 20 min, The rats in exercise group were trained to run on a treadmill for 4 weeks befor induction of ischemia and in sham operated group common carotid arteries do not occluded. The expression of caspase- 3, Bax and Bcl- 2 proteins levels were determined by immunohistochemical staining. Results: The number of caspase- 3 -positive neurons in the CA 1 area were significantly increased in the ischemia group, compared with the sham-operated group. Exercise <b>pre-conditioning</b> significantly reduced the ischemia/reperfusion-induced caspase- 3 activation, compared to the ischemia group. Moreover Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio in ischemia group, significantly increased in comparision with sham-operated group. However, exercise <b>pre-conditioning</b> significantly attenuated the ischemia/reperfusion-induced increase in Bax/Bcl- 2 ratio, as compared with the ischemia group. Conclusion: The results indicated that exercise <b>pre-conditioning</b> has a neuroprotective effects on the brain ischemia.

Streptozotocin-induced diabetic rats were randomized to four groups: Sham group, the I/R group, the MIP group and the NLIP group. Compared with the I/R group, both the NLIP and MIP groups showed an amelioration of ventricular arrhythmia, reduced myocardial infarct size, increased activities of total superoxide dismutase (SOD), manganese-SOD and glutathione peroxidase, increased expression of manganese-SOD mRNA and decreased xanthine oxidase activity and malondialdehyde concentration (All p < 0. 05 vs I/R group).

Combination of cognitive with neurophysiological stimulations has been successfully employed to modulate responses of specific brain regions. The present research combined a neurophysiological <b>pre-conditioning</b> with a cognitive conditioning stimulation to modulate behavior. We applied this new state-dependency approach to investigate the cerebellar role in musical and spatial information processing, given that a link between musical perception and visuo-spatial abilities and a clear cerebellar involvement in music perception and visuo-spatial tasks have been reported. Cathodal, anodal or sham transcranial cerebellar Direct Current Stimulation (tcDCS) <b>pre-conditioning</b> was applied on the left cerebellar hemisphere followed by conditioning stimulation through music or white noise listening in a sample of healthy subjects performing a Line Bisection Task (LBT). The combination of the cathodal stimulation with music listening resulted in a marked attentional shift toward the right hemispace, compensating thus the natural leftward bias of the baseline condition (pseudoneglect). Conversely, the anodal or sham <b>pre-conditioning</b> stimulations combined with either music and white noise conditioning listening did not modulate spatial attention. The efficacy of the combined stimulation (cathodal <b>pre-conditioning</b> and music conditioning) and the absence of any effect of the single stimulations provide a strong support to the state-dependency theory.
