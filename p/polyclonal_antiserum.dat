5000|$|Members of the CRMP {{family were}} {{discovered}} independently in different species by several groups working in parallel. [...] Among the {{five members of}} the family, CRMP-2 was first identified in 1995. Group of researchers led by Goshima found out that CRMP-2 {{played a role in the}} transduction of the extracellular Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A), an inhibitory protein for axonal guidance in chick dorsal root ganglion (DRG). The protein was first named as CRMP-62 having a relative molecular mass of 62 kDa and later referred as CRMP-2. Concurrently, a 64 kDa protein named as TOAD-64 for Turned On After Division, was shown to increase significantly during the development of the cortex of the brain. The cDNA sequence of TOAD-64 corresponded to that of rat CRMP-2. In 1996, mouse CRMP-4, often referred to as Ulip for Unc-33 like phosphoprotein, was discovered by Byk and colleagues, using a rabbit <b>polyclonal</b> <b>antiserum</b> which recognized a 64 kDa mouse brain specific phosphoprotein. In the same year, several other studies cloned CRMPs-1-4 in rat and dihydropyrimidinase (DHPase) homologous sequence of CRMPs-1, -2, and -4 in human fetal brain. Finally, in 2000, CRMP-5 was discovered using two-hybrid screenings of brain libraries or purification from a proteic complex. In following researches, CRMPs were studied as target antigens for autoantibodies in various autoimmune neurodegenerative disorders.|$|E

40|$|Infection {{of three}} calves {{with a highly}} plaque-purified strain of {{bluetongue}} virus (BTV) resulted in prolonged infections, during which virus and neutralizing antibodies co-circulated in peripheral blood. Oligonucleotide fingerprint analyses of the original challenge virus and of the final virus isolate obtained from each calf demonstrated the BTV genome to remain stable throughout prolonged infection as no differences in fingerprint patterns were detected. Six neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (MAbs), and a <b>polyclonal</b> rabbit <b>antiserum,</b> were produced against he challenge virus. This panel of MAbs recognized at least two distinct neutralizing epitopes as demonstrated by immune precipitation. Neutralizing epitopes remained stable through the prolonged infections, as all MAbs and the <b>polyclonal</b> rabbit <b>antiserum</b> neutralized the challenge virus and the final calf isolates to equivalent titres. These results uggest that antigenic drift is not the mechanism by which BTV is able to persist in cattle {{in spite of a}} strong humoral immune response.

40|$|Antibodies against idiotypic {{determinants}} {{carried by}} a monoclonal polyspecific natural autoantibody {{were raised in}} rabbits and in syngeneic BALB/c mice. These anti-idiotypic antibodies were administered to newborn and to pregnant BALB/c mice and to MRL-lpr/lpr mice. Serial measurements of the idiotypes, naturally occurring autoantibodies, and antibodies obtained after antigenic stimulation were performed in the sera of the injected mice and in the offspring of pregnant mice. No idiotypic suppression was noted in newborn injected mice. Transient suppression of idiotypes recognized by the syngeneic anti-idiotypic antibody was noted in the offspring of pregnant mice injected with the rabbit <b>polyclonal</b> anti-idiotypic <b>antiserum.</b> No changes in naturally occurring autoantibodies or in antibodies appearing after antigenic stimulation were noted in BALB/c mice. In contrast, a significant decrease of spontaneously occurring anti-DNA antibodies was found in MRL-lpr/lpr mice treated with rabbit <b>polyclonal</b> anti-idiotypic <b>antiserum.</b> Furthermore in these mice a slight decrease of anti-TNP antibodies was also observed. These results suggest that anti-idiotypic antibodies directed against natural autoantibodies may play a regulatory role in the immune system; this role is more easily appreciated in mice suffering from immune dysregulation...|$|R

40|$|The nonsteroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drug zomepirac (ZP) is metabolised to a chemically reactive acyl glucuronide conjugate (ZAG) {{which can}} form covalent adducts with proteins. In vivo, such adducts could initiate immune or toxic responses. In rats given ZP, the major band detected in liver homogenates by immunoblotting with a <b>polyclonal</b> ZP <b>antiserum</b> was at 110 kDa. This adduct {{was identified as}} ZP-modified dipeptidyl peptidase IV (DPP IV) by immunoblotting using the <b>polyclonal</b> ZP <b>antiserum</b> and monoclonal DPP IV antibodies OX- 61 and 236. 3. In vitro, ZAG, but not ZP itself, covalently modified recombinant human and rat DPP IV. Both monoclonal antibodies recognized DPP IV in livers from ZP- and vehicle-dosed rats. Confirmation that the 110 kDa bands which were immunoreactive with the ZP and DPP IV antibodies represented the same molecule was obtained from a rat liver extract reciprocally immunodepleted of antigens reactive with these two antibodies. Furthermore, immunoprecipitations with OX- 61 antibody followed by immunolotting with ZP antiserum, and the reciprocal experiment, showed that both these antibodies recognised the same 110 kDa molecule in extracts of ZP-dosed rat liver.

This was demonstrated by inhibition studies with purified Lol p I, II, and III and synthetic peptides of their C-termini. It was ruled out that the observed cross-reactivity was caused by cross-contamination of the purified allergens. Both human IgE and IgG bound to the C-terminus of Lol p I. These antibodies were cross-reactive with Lol p II and, more specifically, with its C-terminus. Within a small panel of allergic patients, no cross-reactivity with Lol p III was found. A hyperimmune <b>polyclonal</b> rabbit <b>antiserum</b> against Lol p I also recognized the Lol p I C-terminus.

40|$|In vitro {{studies have}} shown that enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) strains are capable of invading cultured {{epithelial}} cells derived from the human ileum and colon. Two separate invasion loci (tia and tib) have previously been isolated from the classical ETEC strain H 10407. The tia locus has been shown to direct the synthesis of Tia, a 25 -kDa outer membrane protein. Tia is sufficient to confer the adherence and invasion phenotypes on laboratory stains of E. coli, suggesting that this protein is an adhesin and invasin. Here we report the purification of Tia and characterize its biological activity. Tia was purified by electroelution of outer membrane proteins that had been separated by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis. Purified Tia was labeled with biotin and then shown to bind to HCT 8 human ileocecal epithelial cells in a specific and saturable manner. <b>Polyclonal</b> anti-Tia <b>antiserum</b> blocked this binding. These results show that Tia acts as an adhesin. <b>Polyclonal</b> anti-Tia <b>antiserum</b> also inhibited invasion of recombinant E. coli bearing tia clones, indirectly suggesting that Tia may also act as an invasin. We predict Tia to contain eight transmembrane amphipathic Î²-sheets with four loops that are exposed {{on the surface of the}} bacterial cell. A peptide corresponding to 19 residues in one of the four predicted surface-exposed loops inhibits Tia-mediated epithelial cell invasion.

40|$|A low {{abundance}} beta-glucan elicitor-binding protein from soybean {{was isolated}} by a rapid, simple and one-step purification method yielding about 9000 -fold enrichment, The affinity-based purification technique was {{more efficient than}} a procedure that uses conventional methods and preserved the binding activity to a much larger extent, The final preparation consisted of one major protein with an apparent molecular mass of about 75 kDa, Electrophoretic analyses of the purified and photoaffinity-labeled binding protein showed that the native protein was an oligomer with apparent molecular mass of about 240 kDa, A <b>polyclonal</b> anti-peptide <b>antiserum</b> was raised against a synthetic 15 -mer internal oligopeptide sequence derived from the 75 -kDa protein, The antiserum recognized the purified binding protein in immunoblotting experiments and precipitated the affinity-labeled protein from a crude extract of the membrane fraction...|$|R
