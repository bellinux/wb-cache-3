40|$|In {{this study}} we present an {{analytical}} approach for integration of order <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> sortation operations which are the most important, labour intensive and costly activity for warehouses. Main aim is to investigate order <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> sorting efficiencies under different design issues {{as a function of}} order wave size. Integrated analytical model is proposed to estimate the optimum order <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> order sortation efficiency. The model, which has been tested by simulations with different illustrative examples, calculates the optimum wave size that solves the trade-off between <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> sorting operations and makes the order <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> sortations efficiency maximum. Our model also allow system designer to predict the order <b>picking</b> <b>and</b> sorting capacity for different system configurations. This study presents an innovative approach for integrated warehouse operations. ...|$|R

5|$|Several {{changes to}} the roster were made before the 2007–08 {{campaign}} as Toronto sought to reproduce the same form as the previous campaign.

On the other hand, veteran swingman Morris Peterson joined the New Orleans Hornets. Despite being defending division champions, the Raptors were widely tipped as outside contenders for the division and conference titles.

Notably, in 1968, one of Tarkenton's favorite targets, wide receiver Homer Jones made the Pro Bowl; it wasn't until 2010 that another Giants receiver, (Steve Smith), would make the Pro Bowl. Since Smith, Victor Cruz (2012) and Odell Beckham Jr. (2014–16) have made it to the Pro Bowl. Jones' average of 22.3 yards per reception for his career is still an NFL record.|$|E
5|$|The {{expansion}} {{draft was}} largely {{made up of}} aging veterans, giving the Buccaneers little basis for success. The lack of medical information provided on players in the expansion draft contributed heavily to the team’s problems, as they finished the season with 17 players on injured reserve. They were last {{in the league in}} points scored, touchdowns, and rushing touchdowns. After a 19-point 4th-quarter performance brought them within striking distance of a victory in week 8 against the Kansas City Chiefs, they were blown out of every game the rest of the season. Subsequent expansion teams were given a more generous allotment of draft <b>picks</b> <b>and</b> expansion draft opportunities, in part to avoid a repeat of the Buccaneers’ difficulties.|$|E
