5|$|The hilltops {{are covered}} in {{heathland}} of gorse, heather, bracken and thorn with plantations of conifer. The {{western side of the}} Quantocks are steep scarp slopes of pasture, woods and parkland. Deep stream-cut combes to the north-east contain extensive oak-woods with small flower-rich bogs above them. The areas where there is limited drainage are dominated by heather (Calluna vulgaris), with significant populations of cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix), <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> (Molinia caerulea), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). Drier areas are covered with bell heather (Erica cinerea), western gorse (Ulex gallii) and bristle bent (Agrostis curtisii), while bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) is common on well-drained deeper soils. The springs and streams provide a specialist environment that supports bog pimpernel (Anagallis tenella). The woodland is generally birch/sessile oak woodland, valley alder woodland and ash/wych elm woodland, which support a rich lichen flora. Alfoxton Wood is one of only three British locations where the lichen Tomasellia lectea is present.|$|E
25|$|The Cors Caron {{sequence}} of peat domes (also known as Tregaron Bog) developed on the floodplain of the Afon (River) Teifi in mid-Wales now represents the most intact surviving {{example in the}} UK of a raised bog landscape (macrotope). The three main extant domes are hydrologically isolated by the River Teifi and associated surface drainage features, and all three have suffered extensive damage as a con{{sequence of}} past drainage and peat-cutting. The river terraces associated with the component bog mesotopes are regularly flooded and support vegetation that includes reed canary-grass Phalaris arundinacea, soft rush Juncus effusus, <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> Molinia caerulea and, more rarely, water sedge Carex aquatilis. Substantial areas of the surface of each of the three component bogs still retain good quality active raised bog vegetation mainly referable to NVC type M18 Sphagnum papillosum – Erica tetralix community, with frequent bog-rosemary Andromeda polifolia and white beak-sedge Rhynchospora alba and, more locally, the bog-mosses Sphagnum magellanicum and S. pulchrum. Extensive areas with a high cover of heather Calluna vulgaris and deergrass Trichophorum cespitosum are also present, while <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> M. caerulea is particularly prominent on the more modified bog margins. Although present as an important peat-former until as recently as the 18th century, Sphagnum imbricatum is absent from the contemporary bog flora.|$|E
50|$|Key for {{the smaller}} pond is {{ensuring}} good drainage and controlling the <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> tussocks.|$|E
50|$|It {{is found}} growing in wet areas, such as wetlands, {{riparian}} areas, and marshes. In the United Kingdom {{it is found}} in <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> and rush pastures and fen-meadow plant associations.|$|E
50|$|The open short {{grassland}} sward is maintain by periodic sheep grazing {{and scrub}} removal. Invasive plants {{are removed from}} the wetland. These are, in particular, monkey-flower, <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> and blunt-flowered rush.|$|E
50|$|A short {{distance}} to the south, the smaller parcel supports a base and nutrient-rich soligenous fen-type vegetation in which the dominant species varies between <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> Molinia caerulea, and meadowsweet, Filipendula ulmaria.|$|E
50|$|This species overwinter as an adult. In spring these bugs {{mate and}} larvae {{can be found}} from May toJuly. The new {{generation}} of adults appears from July onwards. Adults feed on <b>Purple</b> <b>Moor-grass</b> (Molinia caerulea).|$|E
50|$|The soligenous mire is characterised by sharp-flowered rush, Juncus acutiflorus, and <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> Molinia caerulea. Several local {{species are}} also present, {{including}} narrow-leaved buckler-fern, Dryopteris carthusiana, lesser skullcap, Scutellaria minor, and grass of Parnassus, Parnassia palustris.|$|E
50|$|The {{dominant}} flora of {{the site}} is characterised as a wet heath composed of heather (Calluna vulgaris), <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> (Molinia caerulea), cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix), deergrass (Trichophorum cespitosum), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and tormentil (Potentilla erecta), and occasional bog-moss (Sphagnum capillifolium).|$|E
50|$|In the {{community}} {{in the western part}} of the mire, Blunt-flowered Rush, <b>Purple</b> <b>Moor-grass</b> (Molinia caerulea) and Carnation Sedge (Carex panicea) are abundant species, and this part of the mire is characterised by the presence of a number of species which favour base-rich conditions. Black Bog-rush is locally abundant along a wet drainage ditch in this western part of the site. In the eastern part of the mire <b>Purple</b> <b>Moor-grass</b> and Blunt-flowered Rush are again abundant, but the abundant sedge species here are Lesser Pond-sedge (Carex acutiformis) and Greater Pond-sedge (Carex riparia). Common Reed (Phragmites australis) and Marsh Horsetail (Equisetum palustre) are also frequent. This part of the site supports plant species associated with more neutral conditions.|$|E
50|$|Freshwater marsh/fen vegetation, {{with such}} species as <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> (Molinia caerulea), bottle sedge (Carex rostrata), black bog-rush (Schoenus nigricans), and marsh {{cinquefoil}} (Potentilla palustris), occurs {{in certain areas}} near the lake; one such area supports a population of rare round-leaved wintergreen (Pyrola rotundifolia subsp. rotundifolia).|$|E
50|$|The kettle hole {{has deep}} {{waterlogged}} peat soils supporting a carr woodland of birch (Betula sp.) with Scot’s pine (Pinus sylvestris). The woodland floor has bog-mosses (Sphagnum spp.), and hare’s-tail cotton grass (Eriophorum vaginatum) with <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> (Molinia caerulea) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa).|$|E
50|$|In the {{southern}} part of the site soil drainage is impeded which has caused a significant area of mixed humid heath and acidic grassland to thrive. The main flora present in this part of the site are <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> cross-leaved heath, degenerate heather, heath rush, compact rush, green-ribbed sedge and crowberry.|$|E
50|$|Marsh {{varieties}} of plants include marsh pennywort, lesser spearwort, marsh speedwell, common marsh-bedstraw, floating sweet-grass and {{various types of}} sedge. Where there are drier areas {{at the edge of}} the water, <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> common bent, tufted hair-grass and various rushes flourish. Uncommon bog asphodel is present and is recorded as an increasing population.|$|E
50|$|There is a drier area of {{heathland}} {{around the}} marsh which supports creeping willow, sneezewort, common fleabane, devil's-bit scabious, <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> heather, cross-leaved heath heather and bell heather. The {{boundaries of the}} reserve are edged with bramble, gorse, silver birch and willow. rosebay willowherb flourishes in one corner and its spread is controlled.|$|E
50|$|The area to {{the north}} of the central {{embankment}} is heathland which supports <b>Purple</b> <b>Moor-grass</b> and Mat-grass. Petty Whin grows in abundance on this site and is the only recorded occurrence in the county. Heather and European Gorse are also present. A range of typical heathland flowers flourish, including Heath Bedstraw, Lousewort, Tormentil and Sneezewort.|$|E
50|$|This site is {{an example}} of {{unimproved}} mire of a type which is restricted to south-west England and Wales and which has been significantly reduced in extent in the recent past. <b>Purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> (Molinia caerulea) and meadow thistle (Cirsium dissectum) are abundant. There is a large colony of the marsh fritillary butterfly (Eurodryas aurinia).|$|E
50|$|The bog, {{which has}} been used for centuries, no longer {{exhibits}} the typical character of a living raised bog over much of its area. Only in some areas are there the remnants of peat moss, cottongrass and cross-leaved heathland and bog-rosemary. Secondary vegetation of ling (Calluna vulgaris), crowberry (Empetrum nigrum) und <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> (Molinia caerulea) are widespread.|$|E
50|$|This site is {{designated}} {{due to its}} biological qualities. SSSIs in Wales {{have been}} notified {{for a total of}} 142 different animal species and 191 different plant species. <b>Purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> (Molinia caerulea mire) is the principal vegetation type and a number of uncommon plants grow in Cors Bodwrog including Greater spearwort (Ranunculus lingua) and Lesser bulrush (Typha angustifolia).|$|E
50|$|This {{species is}} univoltine. Adults fly from June to August. The eggs are laid singly on {{the leaves of}} grass. The larvae hatch after two weeks. The hibernating larva is {{reported}} to feed on Agrostis, Dactylis, Poa annua, Bromus erectus and other grasses. In Scotland the main host plants are <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> (Molinia caerulea) and blue moor-grass (Sesleria caerulea).|$|E
50|$|The wet heath areas {{also contain}} <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> along with bog myrtle (Myrica gale) and cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix) {{as the three}} most {{prolific}} species. Black bogrush (Schoenus nigricans) are prominent in the wetter, more base-rich parts, whereas bog mosses (Sphagnum spp.) and the insectivorous round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia) {{can be found in}} the wet hollows.|$|E
50|$|The {{heathland}} {{areas are}} dominated by heather and gorse, with some bilberry and goldenrod. Drier spots are indicated by the occurrence of bell heather. Fine-leaved fescues, wavy hair-grass and <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> dominate the acid grassland areas {{with a mix of}} wood sage, heath bedstraw and other typical species. Marsh violet and hard fern (both London rarities) occur in the damper areas.|$|E
50|$|In the UK and Canada {{this species}} uses {{several species of}} violet as its food plant. In drier areas, dog violets are used whilst in wetter areas the food plant is bog violet (Viola palustris) or marsh violet growing amongst <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> or tufted hair-grass. They prefer the damper areas more often. They also occur amongst bracken, where this is shading the {{appropriate}} violet species.|$|E
50|$|The {{wet surface}} of bog {{supports}} growth of bog mosses (Sphagnum spp.). Rare plants include the bog rosemary (Andromeda polifolia), royal fern (Osmunda regalis), and cranberry (Vaccinium oxycoccus). The petty whin (Genista anglica) grows on the drier western margin and <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> (Molinia caerulea) dominates the drier {{edges of the}} site. The rare weevil (Bagous frit) has been recorded at the site in the past.|$|E
50|$|South of {{the town}} is Briggins Moor a {{biological}} Site of Special Scientific Interestwhich {{provides an example of}} unimproved mire of a type which is restricted to south-west England and Wales and which has been significantly reduced in extent in the recent past. <b>Purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> (Molinia caerulea) and meadow thistle (Cirsium dissectum) are abundant. There is a large colony of the marsh fritillary butterfly (Eurodryas aurinia).|$|E
5000|$|The {{habitats}} {{present at}} Redgrave and Lopham {{are characteristic of}} areas of valley mire. This ecosystem creates a zonation of vegetation types, producing a diverse range of habitat. Dry marginal woodland becomes fen grassland, dominated by <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> which grades into mixed fenland of reed and sedge beds. This grassland is particularly notable at Redgrave and Lopham for its areas of saw sedge Cladium mariscus.|$|E
50|$|A zone of acidic bog {{vegetation}} consisting of: <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> (Molinia caerulea), common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), sedges (Carex spp.) including star sedge (Carex echinata), green-ribbed sedge (Carex binervis) and flea sedge (Carex pulicaris); bog moss (Sphagnum spp.), heath spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata), devils-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), marsh violet (Viola palustris), meadow thistle (Cirsium dissectum), {{wood horsetail}} (Equisetum sylvaticum), lesser butterfly-orchid (Platanthera bifolia) and pale butterwort (Pinguicula lusitanica).|$|E
50|$|On {{unit of the}} site, a {{dip slope}} east of Allolee has poor drainage, which {{supports}} a 'most unusual' species-rich grassland dominated by <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> (Molinia caerulea) and having quaking grass, meadow oat-grass, spring sedge (Carex caryophyllea), glaucous sedge (C. flacca), tawny sedge (C. hostiana), flea sedge (C. pulicaris), lady’s mantle (Alchemilla filicaulis), lady’s bedstraw (Galium verum), fairy flax (Linum catharticum), cowslip (Primula veris), devil’s-bit scabious (Succisa pratensis), greater burnet and wild thyme.|$|E
50|$|The {{dry heath}} {{comprises}} five main species of plant, {{of which the}} common heather (Calluna vulgaris) is the most prolific with bell heather (Erica cinerea) and western gorse (Ulex gallii) also dominant; bristle bent (Agrostis curtisii) and <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> (Molinia caerulea) to a lesser extent. Other species found in this habitat are heath milkwort (Polygala serpyllifolia), lousewort (Pedicularis sylvatica), saw-wort (Serratula tinctoria), deer grass (Trichophorum cespitosum) and the heath spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza maculata).|$|E
50|$|Species {{common on}} the neutral grasslands include common bent (Agrostis capillaris), sweet vernal-grass (Anthoxanthum odoratum), clovers (Trifolium), common {{knapweed}} (Centaurea nigra) and bird's-foot-trefoil (Lotus corniculatus). There are smaller communities of tormentil (Potentilla erecta), meadow vetchling (Lathyrus pratensis), yarrow (Achillea millefolium), self-heal (Prunella vulgaris), {{as well as}} common spotted-orchid (Dactylorhiza fuchsii) and the adder's-tongue fern (Ophioglossum vulgatum). A distinct part of the site is a fen-meadow hosting <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> (Molinia caerulea) and meadow thistle (Cirsium dissectum).|$|E
50|$|Eggs {{are laid}} singly on the {{underside}} of foodplant leaves and hatch after about two weeks. They are normally laid on cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata) but they will occasionally use <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> (Molinia caerulea), false brome (Brachypodium sylvaticum), tor-grass (B. pinnatum) and wood small-reed (Calamagrostis epigejos). Larvae also feed on various Poaceae, Phalaris arundinacea, Alopecurus pratensis, Calamagrostis purpurea, Deschampsia flexuosa, Phragmites communis and Roegneria canina., but also on Festuca, Triticum, Dactylis glomerata, Molinia, Holcus lanatus, Luzula, etc.|$|E
50|$|Along with {{cross-leaved heath}} and <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> the valley bog habitat {{supports}} bog asphodel (Narthecium ossifragum), bog pimpernel (Anagallis tenella), common cottongrass (Eriophorum angustifolium), lesser skullcap (Scutellaria minor), pale butterwort (Pinguicula lusitanica) and white beak-sedge (Rhynchospora alba). Royal fern (Osmunda regalis) and wavy St. John's-wort (Hypericum undulatum), species {{which are not}} common within Britain, {{can also be found}} in the bogland. A broad-leaved woodland surrounds the valley bog which mainly contains sessile oak (Quercus petraea), and willows (Salix spp.).|$|E
50|$|The {{common is}} {{a remnant of}} a lowland heath, with much it on the heavy soils of boulder clay with poor {{drainage}} and wet habitats. There are also areas of ancient woodland and dry heath. The woodland canopy is mainly oak and silver birch with a shrub layer of hornbeam and hazel. Lowland heath flora include sphagnum in the wetter areas {{and there are several}} small ponds. In drier heath areas there are heather, <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> and heath milkwort.|$|E
50|$|The {{headwaters}} of the River Marlais (a tributary of the Cothi) run through the valley. The valley bottom has a series of mires merging into areas of wet heathy pasture dominated by <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass</b> (Molinia caerulea) and rich in sedges. In the very wet, flushed mire areas there is an abundance of bog-mosses (Sphagnum spp.) with other localized plants such as marsh St John’s-wort (Hypericum elodes), round-leaved sundew (Drosera rotundifolia), common butterwort (Pinguicula vulgaris), and bog pondweed (Potamogeton polygonifolius).|$|E
50|$|The site mainly {{consists}} of mire vegetation, of two distinct varieties, one characterised by {{an abundance of}} bog mosses, Sphagnum spp, the other dominated by soft rush, Juncus effusus, and hare's-tail cottongrass, Eriophorum vaginatum. There are also areas of grassland and a secondary woodland of downy birch, Betula pubescens, with a groundcover of rush, bog mosses and <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> Molinia caerulea. The importance of the site is the mire vegetation, which, of this type, is scarce in County Durham.|$|E
50|$|Transitional bogs {{sites of}} the sort found on the moors, within heathland, are {{uncommon}} and give rise to noteworthy flora. At a bog site west of Cateran Hill there is a transition into a fen supporting bottle-sedge (Carex rostrata), marsh cinquefoil (Potentilla palustris), and the bog-moss (Sphagnum fallax). A Quarryhouse Moor example shows a transition from bog to an area of <b>purple</b> <b>moor-grass,</b> bottle sedge, star and carnation sedges (Carex echinata andC. panicea), bog-moss (Sphagnum palustre), and related species.|$|E
