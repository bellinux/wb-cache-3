Smoking, diet, genetic susceptibility and immunosuppression (due to HIV infection or drug use) are risk factors for acquisition of both HPV infection and the progression to cancer. Testing for HPV DNA can now be performed on specimens collected by cervicovaginal lavage or in the newer liquid-based Pap tests. HPV testing is now advised for women with mildly abnormal or atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance (ASCUS) Pap test results and of low-risk post-menopausal women with low grade squamous intraepithelial lesion (LSIL) results. As of this printing, however, the FDA has not approved HPV testing as a routine screening tool. Vaccines are under development that would protect from infection by the oncogenic strains of HPV, especially type 16, which accounts for about one half of cervical cancer cases in the U. S, and to boost the immune systems of those already infected. None of these vaccines is yet licensed...|$|R

40|$|What is a Résumé? A résumé is a {{marketing}} tool, a personal advertisement, {{used to help}} you get an interview. It is a one-page (sometimes two-page) document that briefly highlights your educational background, experience, and skills. It is not an autobiography. The most effective résumé must be well written, concise, organized and clearly focused on a specific job title and address the employer’s stated requirements for the position. The more you know about the duties and skills required for the job – and organize your résumé round these points – the more effective your résumé will be. Keep in mind there is no one correct way to write a résumé. It depends on your unique education, experiences, and skills. General Guidelines Your résumé has 20 - 30 seconds to catch an employer’s eye and get an interview. Make it count! Paper When printing your résumé for submission by mail or in person, use high-quality paper in conservative colors (white, ivory, or very pale gray). Do not use paper with visible flecks in it. Use a laser printer to print your document. Header Utilize the same header on all documents (résumé and list of references). <b>Include</b> <b>your</b> <b>name</b> and <b>your</b> complete contact information. Be certain your email address sounds professional (e. g., not “prettypinkprincess@whatever. com”) and make sure your voicemail message is professional. Do not use your work email address.
