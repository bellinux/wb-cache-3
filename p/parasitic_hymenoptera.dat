40|$|The {{functional}} {{response of}} Theocolax elegans (Westwood) parasitizing the lesser grain borer, Rhyzopertha dominica (F.) was examined over {{a range of}} temperatures. A type II functional response equation was fitted to each temperature regime. The parasitization rate was highest at 301 C (20 hosts per day) and was lowest at 201 C (2 hosts per day). Handling time was inversely proportional to temperature, and ranged from 1. 6 days at 201 C to 0. 05 days at 301 C. Instantaneous search rate also changed with temperature. It was lowest at 201 C and highest at 301 C. A temperature-mediated functional response equation was fitted to the data, in which handling time was a quadratic function of temperature. The equation explained 74 % {{of the variance in}} parasitization rate. Theocolax elegans has a narrower optimal temperature range than other <b>parasitic</b> stored-product <b>Hymenoptera.</b> Temperatures greater than 32. 51 C caused high parasitoid mortality.

40|$|In morphology, coloration, and size, Pseudabispa wasps (Hymenoptera: Vespidae: Eumeninae) closely {{resemble}} mason wasps in the genus Abispa, and their distributions overlap. Although these two genera {{are among the}} largest solitary wasps in Australia, the biology of Pseudabispa was not previously known. Field observations from near Katherine, Northern Territory, strongly suggest that P. paragioides (Meade-Waldo) females attack and kill female A. ephippium (Fabricius) and usurp their nests, then appropriate cells, mass provision them with caterpillars acquired by theft from still other nests, and close them with mud taken from the host nest. Despite an abundance of potentially available cells in nests of three other large solitary wasps common at the same site, P. paragioides was found associated only with nests of A. ephippium. This unusual report of apparently forcible and lethal interspecific nest takeover for a non-social wasp parallels behaviors previously known only from socially <b>parasitic</b> eusocial <b>Hymenoptera.</b> Exploitation by P. paragioides {{may help explain why}} its host displays some of the most highly developed parental care known in any solitary eumenid, and why its nests are spaced widely from one another...|$|R

40|$|Parasitic wasps are {{possibly}} one of {{the most}} diverse groups of insects, constituting a largely unstudied number of extant species in tropical, subtropical and temperate climates (Quicke, 1997). This high degree of speciation and global presence in a variety of habitats indicates that parasitic wasps occupy many ecological niches. <b>Parasitic</b> wasps (<b>Hymenoptera)</b> are obligate parasitoids and kill their host as they complete their development. Their pre-imaginal stages are found on or within the host. Upon completion of their development, free-living adults disperse to mate and seek new hosts (Godfray, 1994). Approximately 50 drosophilid parasitoids were reported in the 1970 s and 1980 s (Basden, 1972; Carton et al., 1986). Some parasitic wasps of Drosophila spp. belong to the superfamily Cynipoidea and family Eucoilidae. Eucoilidae is a monophyletic group and, within Cynipoidea, it has the largest number of parasitic species, mostly found in the tropics (Nordlander, 1980, 1982). More than 20 eucoilid genera have been identified (Nordlander, 1980, 1982; Carton et al., 1986). Of these, Leptopilina is the most thoroughly studied genus. Leptopilina heterotoma and L. boulardi are eucoiliform endoparasitoids of Drosophila spp. Many aspects of the biology of Leptopilina and Leptopilinaâ€“Drosophila system, including morphological and molecular phylogenetics, host detection behavior, superparasitism and interaction with the host immune response, have been documented (Nordlander...|$|R

50|$|Polyembryony is a {{widespread}} form of asexual reproduction in animals, whereby the fertilized egg or a later stage of embryonic development splits to form genetically identical clones.

50|$|Brachymeria is a genus of {{parasitic}} wasps in {{the family}} Chalcididae. Over 300 species are known worldwide, all of them parasites of insect larvae. Most species are black with limited yellow markings, and like most chalcidid wasps, they have enlarged hind femora. The female typically lays eggs inside the larva of a lepidopteran using its ovipositor. Although mostly parasitic on Lepidoptera, a few are hyperparasites (parasites of <b>parasitic</b> <b>Hymenoptera</b> and Diptera), or attack other types of insect larvae (such as Polistes erythrocephalus). The adult parasites emerge typically from the host pupa. Some species {{have been used in}} biological control.|$|E

50|$|During {{the latter}} part of his career Van der Vecht had an {{important}} role in the study of Hymenoptera and as a teacher of taxonomy. Together with Charles Ferriere he revived the pre-war Hymenopterorum Catalogus, a work which is still in progress. He was an early advocate of the importance of phylogenetics for taxonomy. He was president of the Netherlands Entomological Society between 1961-1968. He travelled on collecting trips, often with his wife, to destinations such as Surinam, Papua New Guinea and Argentina where he collected Hymenoptera specimens as well as meeting friends and colleagues in the field of Aculeate Hymenoptera. During his life he was an enthusiastic collector of Hymenoptera and during his retirement he continued, especially collecting specimens of <b>parasitic</b> <b>Hymenoptera</b> around the village of Putten, where he and Bep had made their home in a bungalow named Andrena after the bees which he started to study at the beginning of his career, and its surroundings. He was energetic in helping to improve the collection of Hymenoptera in the Rijksmuseum van Natuurlijke Historie at Leiden as well as continuing to publish papers into his eighties. In retirement Van der Vecht and his wife struggled with bouts of mental illness. His wife died in 1986 and their only child had died as an infant before the war; the couple were unable to have any more children after their experiences in the Japanese prison camps during the war.|$|E
