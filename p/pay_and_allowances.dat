She was sentenced on August 21 to 35 years in prison, reduction in rank to private (private E-1 or PVT), forfeiture of all <b>pay</b> <b>and</b> <b>allowances,</b> and a dishonorable discharge. She was given credit for 1,293 days of pretrial confinement, including 112 days for her treatment at Quantico, and would have been eligible for parole after serving one-third of the sentence. She was confined at the United States Disciplinary Barracks (USDB) at Fort Leavenworth, Kansas.|$|E
5|$|Douglas and Jean MacArthur {{spent their}} last years {{together}} in the penthouse of the Waldorf Towers, {{a part of the}} Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. He was elected {{chairman of the board of}} Remington Rand. In that year, he earned a salary of $68,000 (equivalent to $612,000 in 2016), in addition to $20,000 <b>pay</b> <b>and</b> <b>allowances</b> as a General of the Army. The Waldorf became the setting for an annual birthday party on 26 January thrown by the general's former deputy chief engineer, Major General Leif J. Sverdrup. At the 1960 celebration for MacArthur's 80th birthday, many of his friends were startled by the general's obviously deteriorating health. The next day, he collapsed and was rushed into surgery at St. Luke's Hospital to control a severely swollen prostate.|$|E
5|$|Omaha {{arrived at}} Port of Spain, on 17 November 1941, with Odenwald flying the German flag on the mast with the US flag flying over it. It {{was not until}} 30 April 1947, that a case was brought by Odenwalds owners in the District Court for Puerto Rico, against the US. Their claim stated that because {{a state of war}} between the United States and Germany did not exist at the time of capture the vessel could not be taken as a prize or bounty. The court however, given the fact that Odenwald was rescued from sinking by the US crew, {{declared}} that the seizing of the ship was defined as a legal salvage operation. The US was awarded the profits that were made from Odenwald and her cargo. All the men of the original boarding party received $3,000 each, {{while the rest of the}} crewmen in Omaha and Somers, at the time, were entitled to two months' <b>pay</b> <b>and</b> <b>allowances.</b> The laws have since been revised, making this the last time that US Navy members received such an award.|$|E

25|$|Young came to {{love the}} City of London. He relished command of a force small enough to know every constable well. He enjoyed the City's rich social life too, and he much valued the {{invitation}} to join the Goldsmiths Company. The police needed to recruit and with considerable success he set about making service more attractive. <b>Pay</b> <b>and</b> <b>allowances</b> were increased, housing modernised, and catering improved. Uniforms were made more comfortable and practical. At another level, he pushed through changes in career structures. He engineered a national recruitment revolution in the British police, running command courses and seeing through a fast-track entry scheme to attract graduates - and for many years he was director of extended interviews for the Senior Command Course that he had founded.|$|E

25|$|Before World War I, Canadian Nursing Sisters {{participated in}} the South African War, Boer War, and the War of 1812. Following the {{creation}} of the Canadian Army Medical Department in June 1899, the Canadian Army Nursing Service was created and four Canadian nurses were dispatched South Africa. They were granted the relative rank, <b>pay</b> <b>and</b> <b>allowances</b> of an army lieutenant. Before the war was over on May 31, 1902, eight Canadian Nursing Sisters and more than 7,000 Canadian soldiers had volunteered for service in South Africa. However, World War I allowed women to emerge into the public sphere in an international conflict like never before. When Britain declared war on the German Empire, Canada was automatically compelled to fight alongside Britain. At {{the beginning of the war}} there were five Permanent Force nurses and 57 listed in reserve. Nursing was viewed as a respectable occupation for women because it embodied feminine characteristics such as nurturing, healing, and selflessness. During wartime, nursing became womenâs primary way of contributing to the war effort and came to represent a distinct form of nationalism on behalf of the Canadian Nursing Sisters.|$|E

Dalton, who was deployed in the Middle East at the time the charges were brought, had an Article 32 hearing and was Court-martialed on 23 April 2007 at Langley Air Force Base. As part of a plea bargain deal, Dalton pleaded guilty to involuntary manslaughter and violating a lawful general regulation by drawing or aiming a firearm when deadly force was unnecessary. Dalton was sentenced to 10 years in prison, given a dishonorable discharge, reduced in rank from Senior Airman to Airman Basic and ordered to forfeit all <b>pay</b> <b>and</b> <b>allowances.</b> Dalton admitted to the court that he tracked Ware with his pistol in the barracks and pulled the trigger thinking the weapon was unloaded.

500|$|The revolts in the Philippines {{had been}} suppressed, the islands were {{peaceful}} now, {{and in the}} wake of the Washington Naval Treaty, the garrison was being reduced. MacArthur's friendships with Filipinos like Manuel Quezon offended some people. [...] "The old idea of colonial exploitation", he later conceded, [...] "still had its vigorous supporters." [...] In February and March 1923 MacArthur returned to Washington to see his mother, who was ill from a heart ailment. She recovered, but it was the last time he saw his brother Arthur, who died suddenly from appendicitis in December 1923. In June 1923, MacArthur assumed command of the 23rd Infantry Brigade of the Philippine Division. On 7 July 1924, he was informed that a mutiny had broken out amongst the Philippine Scouts over grievances concerning <b>pay</b> <b>and</b> <b>allowances.</b> Over 200 were arrested and there were fears of an insurrection. MacArthur was able to calm the situation, but his subsequent efforts to improve the salaries of Filipino troops were frustrated by financial stringency and racial prejudice. On 17 January 1925, at the age of 44, he was promoted, becoming the Army's youngest major general.|$|E

[...] Yet Eichelberger's Eighth Army killed another 27,000 Japanese on Leyte before the campaign ended in May 1945. On 18 December 1944, MacArthur was promoted to the new five-star rank of General of the Army, placing him {{in the company of}} Marshall, Eisenhower, Henry [...] "Hap" [...] Arnold, the only four men to achieve the rank in World War II.

MacArthur was senior to all but Marshall. The rank was created by an Act of Congress when Public Law [...] was passed on 14 December 1944, as a temporary rank, subject to reversion to permanent rank six months after the end of the war.
