40|$|This thesis {{describes}} the parliamentary scrutiny {{system of the}} Dutch Government in the European decision-making process. More specifically, this study concerns the instruments of the British <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> <b>reserve</b> and the Danish and Austrian mandating systems, and the added value that such instruments might have for the Netherlands. The main {{lesson to be learned}} from the British scrutiny reserve is that both the Government and Parliament are encouraged to become actively involved at an early stage of the European decision-making process. The system also ensures structural provision of information throughout the European decision-making process. In the Netherlands such structural information agreements between Parliament and the Government do not exist. The introduction of a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> <b>reserve</b> would solve this problem. The instrument of the parliamentary reserve that was introduced in the Netherlands when the Lisbon Treaty entered into force is much more limited than the British scrutiny reserve. The Dutch parliamentary reserve lacks the most essential aspect that makes the scrutiny reserve a valuable instrument. It is not linked to Government information and therefore does not stimulate as much dialogue between the Government and Parliament from the earliest stages of the European decision-making process as the British scrutiny reserve does. The Danish mandating system adds little to the Dutch Parliament’s existing instruments to scrutinize the Government in the EU decision-making process. It may be doubted whether a mandating system would be suitable in a bicameral system such as the Dutch one. The Tweede Kamer (the Dutch House of Representatives) and the Eerste Kamer (the Dutch Senate) may occasionally give contradictory instructions. Furthermore, the fact that the presentation of the mandates often takes place at a later stage of the European decision-making process {{can be seen as a}} major drawback of the Danish mandating system. Despite the fact that the system ensures that Parliament is involved in important European decisions, at such a late stage it is difficult for Parliament to have actual influence. The Dutch Tweede Kamer has similar problems, as the deliberation on the annotated agendas of the Council meeting also takes place only shortly before the Council meeting in Brussels. The Austrian system with respect to the Stellungnahmen would be no addition to the existing instruments that the Dutch Parliament has to scrutinize the Government in the EU decision-making process either. The major problem with the Austrian system is that the provision of information by the Government is limited to forwarding European documents without any additional information, such as the negotiation position. As the Austrian Government provides so little information, Parliament is not stimulated enough to become actively involved in the European decision-making process. Most of the European proposals are discussed only just before the Council meeting in which the final decisions on the proposals have to be made. Based on these conclusions the thesis outlines various alternatives that could solve the problems of the Dutch system. The introduction of a <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> <b>reserve</b> is considered to be the most optimal solution for these problems...|$|E
40|$|The essay {{provides}} a first {{assessment of the}} draft reform of the Italian Chamber of Deputies’ Rules of procedure {{from the point of}} view of the Chamber’s relationship with the European Union. The article argues that such reform has been very needed since the entry into force of the Treaty of Lisbon and even more after the enactment of Law no. 234 / 2012. However, so far the new prerogatives acquired by the Chamber of Deputies in the EU affairs have not led to the update of written rules of procedures, whereas the Committee on the Rules of procedure has stretched the interpretation of the existing rules as to provide experimental and provisional procedures in compliance with the new European and national legal framework; a practice that is criticized by the authors. After the two introductory sections, the article proceeds as follows: first, it analyses how the draft reform aims to regulate the implementation of the new information duties upon the executive, the scrutiny over the planning documents of the EU institutions, the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> <b>reserve,</b> and the consultation of the regional legislative assemblies, the latter option being only limitedly exploited by the reform. Secondly, the articles focuses on the design of the subsidiarity scrutiny in the Chamber and on committee hearings and highlights as questionable the choice to concentrate such a scrutiny only upon the Committee on EU Policies or on the Floor of the Chamber, upon request. In addition, objections are raised about the choice to disregard other crucial procedures in the draft reform, such as those on the revision of the EU Treaties and on the so-called ‘emergency brake’. Finally, the implementation of the new rules about the European legislative act of delegation (‘legge di delegazione europea’) and the European legislative act (‘legge europea’) is examined and compared to the practice of this first year of enforcement of Law no. 234 / 2012...|$|E
40|$|<b>Parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> <b>reserves</b> {{have become}} a popular {{parliamentary}} instrument for the scrutiny of EU documents {{over the last two}} decades. While the exact provisions for them vary between the member states and according to their parliaments’ overall <b>scrutiny</b> system, <b>parliamentary</b> <b>reserves</b> generally mean that government representatives do not, or cannot, officially agree to a proposal in the Council (or COREPER or the working groups) while the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> process is ongoing. Yet despite the proliferation of reserve provisions, we actually know very little about them. The paper will therefore provide an overview over the specific features of <b>scrutiny</b> <b>reserves</b> in different member states.

40|$|For the Justice and Home Affairs (JHA) Council {{the year}} 2007 brought a record: the 164 texts adopted {{were not only}} an {{increase}} of nearly 40 per cent compared to 2006, but also {{the highest number of}} texts ever adopted during a single year. 1 This increase was due mainly to the accelerated implementation of parts of the Hague Programme (which had been subject to serious delays the year before); the extension of external relations activity in the JHA domain (mainly in the form of readmission and visa agreements); and the putting into place of the new 200713 financial framework and of the Schengen Information System (SIS) II. The Commission also injected new impetus in the migration policy developments. The well-managed German Presidency secured agreement on the incorporation into the EU of most of the police co-operation and data-exchange provisions of the Prm Convention, which had still divided Member States the year before, and the Portuguese Presidency contributed much to the extension of the Schengen border control zone to the new Member States in December. At the end of the year, however, the impressive numerical increase in output could not hide the fact that substantive progress was overall more modest. The adoption of the `Rome I Regulation on non-contractual obligations, for instance, contrasted with the Member States' failure to agree on the long overdue Framework Decision on procedural rights in criminal proceedings. Several important legislative acts also continued to be delayed because of the unanimity requirement and national <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> <b>reserves.</b> Against this background, the quite extensive reforms in the Treaty of Lisbon for the `area of freedom, security and justice (AFSJ) appeared all the more important, although the new perspectives thus opened came with an enhanced potential for further differentiation in the JHA domain...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the topic of {{individual}} <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of European affairs in Slovakia. The aim of this thesis is to determine which factors influenced the formally strong system of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> in the Slovak National Assembly. 6 factors will be analyzed - Late accession to the EU, parliamentary strength, bargaining strength in the Council of EU, public euroscepticism, euroscepticism of political parties {{and the frequency of}} coalition and minority governments. The strength of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> can also be influenced by informal aspects. The informal aspects in this thesis will be mainly concerned with the efforts {{of the members of the}} European Affairs Committee to acquire additional information about legislative proposals of the EU in an informal way and also their efforts for a better cooperation in <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> among various political parties. The empirical analysis found, that the factor of late accession to the EU and euroscepticism of political parties had the biggest effect on the formally strong system of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> in Slovakia.

With this decision, the idea of a body to ensure <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of the European Police Office (Europol) finally manifests itself in the JPSG. In the emerging Security Union that the EU seeks to create, also in reaction to recent terror attacks, the responsible actors at the EU level must be subject to <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny.</b> According to Article 51 of the new Europol Regulation No. 2016 / 794, the JPSG will play an essential role to “politically monitor Europol’s activities in fulfilling its mission, including as regards the impact of those activities on the fundamental rights and freedoms of natural persons. ” In its first part, the Policy Paper examines the political difficulties to move forward with respect to intentions and provisions for enhancing the <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> over Europol. The in-depth analysis of the positions of national parliaments and EU institutions is based on reports, resolutions, publicly available minutes and amendments to draft conclusions as well as other texts. This paper evaluates the agreement on the JPSG for Europol as promising. The second part of the Policy Paper presents concrete proposals in order to make the JPSG work efficiently: The JPSG should complement the existing scrutiny of Europol by the Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs in the European Parliament and it should adopt ambitious Rules of Procedure at its first meeting in order to clarify and fix its internal functioning. The new body could subsequently become a blueprint for interparliamentary scrutiny in the EU...|$|R

Journal of Contemporary European Research, 7 (4), 500 - 519. Since {{the terrorist attacks}} in New York and Washington, DC (2001), Madrid (2004) and London (2005), the European Union (EU) has stepped up its efforts to develop new instruments and reinforce existing ones to fight terrorism jointly. One of the key aspects of the EU-wide fight against terrorism and serious crime is the facilitation and enforcement of information and intelligence exchange among law enforcement authorities and, to a limited extent, security and intelligence services. This article examines how far the EU?s commitment to democracy, accountability and transparency is actually fulfilled with respect to its efforts at fighting terrorism by drawing on {{the example of the}} activities of the European Police Office (Europol). Taking the European Parliament (EP) and National Parliaments (NPs), but also inter-parliamentary forums, into account, the article analyses how, and to what extent, mechanisms of democratic accountability and, in particular, <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> are in place to hold EU-wide counter-terrorism actors, such as Europol, to account. This is a particularly timely question given that Europol?s <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> procedures are currently subject to considerable changes due to the change in its legal mandate as of 1 January 2010 and the entry into force of the Lisbon Treaty. preprintPeer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|The Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP) of the European Union (EU) is {{considered}} to be an intergovernmental policy at the European level and a domain of the executive at the national level. Yet, despite the prerogative of the executive, there is still <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of CFSP, but it has received little academic attention, although there is a growing debate about the democratic deficit of the policy that the Lisbon Treaty attempted to alleviate. This research offers insight into how national parliaments scrutinise CFSP by comparing the Foreign Affairs Committees of the Estonian Riigikogu and Finnish Eduskunta. Usually both are considered by the scholarly literature strong scrutinisers and both have similar formal powers and mandating-systems of CFSP scrutiny. Yet, similarities in the formal setup notwithstanding, there still seems to be a difference in how the two parliaments engage in CFSP scrutiny with Riigikogu described as a rubber stamp and Eduskunta an active policy shaper. This discrepancy {{can be explained by the}} fact that the literature on <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> of EU affairs has focused mostly on the formal powers that the parliaments have. In contrast this study concentrates not only on the legal rights and capabilities, but emphasises the role of the informal factors that affect the level of scrutiny of CFSP. It argues that as CFSP is a EU policy with less automatic <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny</b> than other policy fields, informal factors such as attitude and willingness of the parliamentarians to engage in CFSP scrutiny and motivational factors play a more important role. Through expert interviews and the analytical framework developed by Born and Hänggi that takes into account authority, ability and attitude, this research concludes that attitude and the willingness of parliamentarians to engage in CFSP scrutiny explains the difference of the levels of scrutiny of CFSP of Riigikogu and Eduskunta. These findings support the new institutionalist theory of sociological institutionalism that emphasises the role of culture, role perception and institutional identity as determining the level of <b>parliamentary</b> <b>scrutiny...</b>|$|R

While acknowledging that legal powers and institutional structures are important when evaluating parliamentary-government relations, the examination focuses on the goals and methods of party groups when overseeing government. In Germany, the goal of the governing coalition parties is to protect the government, whereas in the Netherlands they scrutinize the government's position in order to be sure the compromise in the cabinet sufficiently protects the party's interests. Although the Dutch governing parties normally support the government, a `floating coalition' occasionally emerges with ruling parties working with parts of the opposition to amend a proposal toward their own preferences.
