40|$|In late 2002, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System {{published}} a revision to its index of industrial {{production and the}} related measures of capacity utilization. The primary feature of the revision was the reclassification back to 1972 of <b>production</b> and <b>capacity</b> <b>indexes</b> for individual industries from the Standard Industrial Classification System to the North American Industry Classification System. The revision also reflects the incorporation of newly available, more comprehensive source data, and it introduced improved methods for measuring the annual real output of communications equipment manufacturing.; Along with the updating and the restatement of the data using the North American Industry Classification System, all <b>production</b> and <b>capacity</b> <b>indexes</b> are now expressed as percentages of output in 1997. The new information resulted in an upward revision to {{the rate of increase}} in industrial <b>production</b> and <b>capacity</b> from 1997 to 2000. For that period, the average rate of industrial capacity utilization is 0. 7 percentage point higher than previously reported. The most recent business-cycle peak is still June 2000, at 116. 2 percent of 1997, with the low being the fourth quarter of 2001. The rate of industrial capacity {{in the third quarter of}} 2002, at 76. 2 percent, is essentially unchanged from previously reported data. The rate is more than 5 percentage points below its 1972 - 2001 average and about 3 percentage points below the trough in the 1990 - 91 recession but 5 percentage points above the trough in the 1982 recession.

For this period, both the levels and the rates of change were revised. For years before 1972, the levels, but not the rates of change, were also revised. Overall, the changes to total industrial production were small.; Besides the {{revisions to}} the monthly data for IP and capacity utilization starting in 1972, the comparison base year for all <b>production</b> and <b>capacity</b> <b>indexes</b> was changed: The indexes are now expressed as percentages of output in 2002 instead of 1997.

The updated measures reflect both the incorporation of newly available, more comprehensive source data typical of annual revisions {{and the introduction of}} improved methods for compiling a few series, including computer and office equipment and motor vehicles. The new source data are for recent years, primarily from 1997 on, and the modified methods affect data beginning in 1992.; The production index for the third quarter of 1999 is at 137. 7 percent of output in 1992, compared with 135. 2 percent reported before the annual revision, and the <b>capacity</b> <b>index</b> is 170. 7 percent of output in 1992, compared with 167. 9 percent reported previously.

To-day, the {{conventional}} technologies of coal mining are distinguished several shortages as negative {{influence on the}} environment and lower efficiency of coal potential energy use and higher labor capacity of underground works. In accordance with these shortages the natural gas became a play key role in many countries for power generation. During last twelve years the technologies of coal gasification for power generation are developing in the coal areas of the USA and other countries. The novel concept of the local coal and gas and electrical complex (enterprise) had proposed in "Mineral", Ltd and Moscow State Mining Institute. The technology was named through abbreviation as LCGEC. The concept is based on transformation of hard raw coal in a gas fuel through gasification procedure and recovery of coalbed methane and mix of these two gas streams for use the ones into a combine cycle unit for power generation. One from very important problems of LUGEC exploitation is high coalbed methane productivity through extracted wells. The problem is discussing in the report. Implementation of the concept requires an attraction of large investments. For realization of the concept it is need to develop the concept - project of the complex.
