The production of biodiesel in bench scale is compared to the <b>pilot</b> plant <b>scale</b> production. There are two processes involved in this work i. e. esterification process and transesterification process. The esterification process used H 2 SO 4 as a catalyst while in transesterification process used NaOH as a catalyst. The ratio between Jatropha oil to methanol, the time reaction, and the temperature are similar in both scales. From the result, it was found that for bench <b>scale</b> and <b>pilot</b> plant <b>scale,</b> there are some differences {{in the value of the}} final yield.

The result was that, although the shrinkage was only a function of moisture content, the moisture diffusivity was dependent upon both temperature and moisture content. The effective diffusion coefficients were estimated at a temperature range of 35 - 70 C ° and a moisture content range of 0. 25 - 3. 8 kg moisture/kg dry solids. Some correlations were proposed for these properties...|$|R
