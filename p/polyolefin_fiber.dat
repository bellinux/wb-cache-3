40|$|Electrospinning, {{in which}} a droplet of polymer liquid is {{elongated}} {{by the action of}} a strong electrical field, is an effective method to produce submicron scale fibers. The resulting nanofibers are collected as non-woven mats with large surface area to volume ratios which can be used in filtration, catalysis, tissue engineering and reinforced composites. Studies on electrospinning, however, have been limited to relatively simple polymeric systems and researchers have just begun to scratch at the surface of the structure and morphology of various sub-micron scale fibers. To achieve a fundamental understanding of material-processing-structure relation during nanofiber formation, the following three systems have been investigated experimentally. First, the formation of nanofibers from polylactic acid (PLA) and its nanocomposite solutions has been studied to investigate the effects of inclusion of silica nanoclays. It is observed that the inclusion of nanoclays gives rise to strong cold crystallization, formation of beta crystals and structural orientation in PLA fibers. Electrospun PLA nanocomposite fibers also exhibit improved mechanical properties due to the preservation of intercalated structures and further alignment of nanoclays throughout the entire fiber. We further studied the effect of inclusion of polyethylene oxide (PEO) on PLA fibers. The mechanical properties of PLA are greatly affected by the addition of PEO. Electrospun PLA/PEO blend fibers with less than 10 wt% of PEO exhibit increased elongational modulus, yield strength and breaking strain. Secondly, we have created a unique route to nanofibers directly from the melt which eliminates the organic solvents present in solution electrospinning. This new solvent-free approach not only allows us to investigate a rich array of experimental studies to develop novel nanofibers directly from polymer melts and composites but also opens the door to theoretical routes to model nanofiber formation without the complications associated with solvent evaporation. Sub-micron PLA fibers have successfully been electrospun from its melt by investigating the effects of a series of processing parameters on fiber diameter. The degradation during melt electrospinning has also been studied. The third system is an extension from melt electrospinning, which is heated solution electrospinning of polyolefin. We explored the possibilities of electrospinning sub-micron <b>polyolefin</b> <b>fibers</b> directly from their solutions and investigated the effects of processing parameters on fiber morphologies and properties.

40|$|Radical {{generators}} as synergists in {{flame retarded}} polymers {{have been used}} in combination with brominated flame retardants for decades. However, due to the low thermal stability of radical generators under the usual polymer processing conditions the use was limited to selected applications e. g. in polystyrene foams. The need to find efficient halogen free flame retardants resulted inter alia in the discovery and commercialization of hindered amine light stabilizers based on alkoxyamines (NOR-HALS). NOR-HALS provide flame retardancy of polypropylene and <b>polyolefin</b> <b>fibers,</b> non-wovens and films. The performance of the NOR molecules depends on their structure i. e. the capability to degrade into nitroxyl plus alkyl or aminyl plus alkoxy radicals. Through formation of radicals a fast degradation of the polymer chain is induced and flame retardancy is achieved by removing the substrate from the flame. On the other hand, the formed radicals are involved in the free radical chemical reactions during the combustion process. Furthermore, alkoxy amines can interact with brominated flame retardants and facilitate the release of bromine, consequently increasing the overall FR performance. Therefore, it is possible with NORs to design flame retardant polyolefin molding compositions with lower levels of halogenated flame retardants and, in addition, to eliminate antimony trioxide. Moreover the hindered amine (HALS) structure provides light and long-term thermal stability of flame retarded formulations. Following the success of NOR based flame retardants a number of alternative radical generator molecules have been identified namely azo compounds, triazenes, hydrazones and azines. Especially combinations of Azo and NOR structures in one molecule show increased performance at loadings as low as 0. 5 % in polypropylene films, including light and long-term thermal stability, and act synergistically with halogen, phosphorus and inorganic flame retardants. Although the performance of alkoxyamines in thin sections such as films is well documented and the UL 94 V- 2 classification is often obtained in moldings, formulations usually fail in achieving the UL 94 V- 0 classification as burning drips cannot be avoided despite short burning times. For the first time a new class of nitrogen based radical generators can be presented whereas in combination with selected phosphorus derivatives flame retarded polypropylene with UL 94 V- 0 classification is accessible. Thermal stability and degradation of the new class into radicals is correlated to the molecular structure and can be adjusted in line with the degradation of the polymer and the synergist. Moreover the necessary loadings to achieve UL 94 V- 0 are below 10 %...|$|R

[...] İstanbul Technical University, Institute of Science and Technology, 2014 Gevrek bir yapı malzemesi olan betona lif ilave edilmesiyle daha sünek bir yapı oluşturularak betonun bazı mekanik özelliklerinde iyileşme beklenir. Lifler; tipi, boyutu, geometrisi, miktarı, çekme dayanımı ve yüzey özellikleri gibi birçok parametreye bağlı olarak betonda dayanımı, çatlak kontrolünü, şekil değiştirme kapasitesini, enerji yutma kapasitesini ve durabiliteyi arttırır. Betonda kullanılan lifler kullanım amacına göre birçok farklı çeşit lif türü bulunmaktadır. Beton gevrek yapısı nedeniyle ilk çatlakla beraber kırılma mekanizmasını tamamlar. Betona lif eklenmesi durumunda kırılma mekanizması ilk çatlak ile başlar. Çatlağın betonda ilerlemesini sağlayan gerilme enerjisi, çatlak life ulaştığında lif üzerine aktarılır. Lif bu enerjiyi sıyrılana kadar ya da kopana kadar taşır sonrasında tekrar betona aktarır. Betonun çatlamaya devam etmesiyle bu mekanizma nihai çatlak oluşuncaya kadar devam eder. Kırılma mekanizması tamamlandığında betonda {{parallel}} çatlaklar oluşur. Böylelikle, lifin betona eklenmesi gervek bir malzeme olan betona sünek özellik kazandıracaktır. Bu çalışmada kısa ve uzun geometrilerdeki poliolefin liflerin farklı oranlarda kullanılmasının betonun mekanik özelliklerine etkisi incelenmiştir. Çalışma kapsamında kompozit malzemenin mekanik özelliklerini irdeleyen basınç ve eğilme deneyleri yapılmıştır. Ayrıca elektron mikroskobu ile mikro yapı incelemesi gerçekleştirilmiştir. Mikro yapı incelemesinde üç noktalı eğilme deneyi uygulanmış numune üzerindeki kırılma yüzeyinden elde edilen numuneler üzerinde gerçekleştirilmiştir. Görüntülemede lif yüzeyleri, lif uç bölgeleri ve lif matris birleşimi incelenmiştir. Bu çalışmayla lifin yük etkisi altındaki davranışı ve matris ile lif arasındaki aderans incelenmiştir. Deneysel çalışmalar neticesinde kullanılan kısa liflerin, matrisin basınç dayanımını artırdığı sonucuna ulaşılmıştır. Ancak matrise uzun lif eklenmesinin, matriste basınç dayanımını düşürdüğü belirlenmiştir. Basınç dayanımınındaki bu azalamanın uzun liflerin beton içerisinde boşluk gibi davranmasından kaynaklandığı düşünülmektedir. Karışımlara uygulanan üç noktalı eğilme deneyi sonuçlarına göre liflerin matrisin enerji yutma kapasitesinde artışa neden olduğu belirlenmiştir. Bu artışta uzun liflerin, kısa liflere nazaran daha etkili olduğu görülmüştür. Liflerin hacime % 1 oranında kullanılmasının matrisin eğilme dayanımını düşürdüğü belirlenmiştir. Bunun sebebinin, betonda çatlağın ilerlemesine neden olan gerilme enerjisinin aktarılması için yeterli miktarda lifin matris içerisinde bulunmaması olduğu düşünülmektedir. Uzun ve kısa liflerin mikro yapıları incelendiğinde, uzun liflerin yüzey pürüzlülüğünün kısa liflere göre fazladır. Ayrıca uzun liflerin uç kısımlarının düzenli fibrile yapıda olması matrise tutunmayı artırmıştır. Bu durum uzun liflerin mekanik özelliklerinin kısa liflere göre daha yüksek olmasını açıklamaktadır. In recent years, {{there is}} an increasing interest of using cement based composites with synthetic fiber additives due to its superior properties compared to conventional concrete. Fiber additives {{make it possible to}} produce high durability cement based composites and thin wall cement based materials which can not be produced with conventional steel reinforcement concrete. due to its superior properties Fiber reinforcement concretes has a wide using area such like road concretes, industrial flooring, hydro buildings, tunnels, bridges, blast proof military buildings, runways of airports, concrete pipes and pre-cast concrete materials. The mechanical properties of concrete is expected to convert from a ductile structural material to much more ductile structural material while adding the fiber to the concrete. The parameters as strength, cracking control, the capacity of deformation, energy holding capacity, and durability are all increased due to the type, dimension, geometry, quantity, tensile strength, and surface characteristics of the concrete. There are different fiber types depending on their various intended use on the concrete. The breakage mechanism is completed while the first crack is occurred because of the ductile structure of concrete. In the case of adding the fiber into the concrete material, the first crack is initiated the breakage mechanism. The strain energy that makes the crack possible to move on the concrete material is directed onto fiber while the crack is reached to the fiber. The fiber bears the strain energy as much as it can endure and the energy is transferred back to the concrete. This process is repeated during the load increases with existing many parallel cracks on the element. The attached fiber makes the concrete much more ductile compared to the original ductile nature of the concrete material. Thinner, lighter and cost saving materials can be produced with higher durability. Fiber additives increase the tensile strength which results into less shrinkage cracks during hardening and hydration and an increasing in fatigue performance, strength and durability. There are various types of fibers used as an additive in cement based materials. High strength fibers like Glass, carbon, aramid and high density polyetilene increase the composites strength and toughness and stiffness when added. Low modulus fiber additives like polypropylene and polyethylene increases the ductility. However this kind of fibers have a limited effect on increasing strength of concrete In this study, short <b>polyolefin</b> <b>fibers</b> with different geometric features were used to observe the effect of mechanical properties of the concrete depending on different ratio of <b>polyolefin</b> <b>fibers.</b> In the scope of this study, compressive and bending test are conducted to obtain the mechanical properties of composite material. Microstructure investigation of Failure surfaces of Three point bending test applied samples is performed with scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Fiber surfaces, fiber tail ends and fiber-matrix conjunctions are inspected in detail by SEM. Fibers behaviors were investigated under load and adherence between fiber and matrix are observed. On the basis of experimental results, it is observed that short <b>polyolefin</b> <b>fibers</b> increase the pressure strength of the matrix. However, the pressure strength of the matrix decreases due to the addition of long fibers. The reason behind the decrement of pressure strength is the cavitation tendency of long fibers in the concrete. Three point bending test applied to the samples shows that the fibers increase the energy absorbance of matrix. POU fibers are found to be more effective to increase the energy absorbance then POK fibers. The bending strength of matrix decreases depending on the fiber volume of % 1. Hence, the quantity of fiber in the matrix is not well enough to direct the strain energy that let the crack to move on the concrete material. The studies showed that using of fibers within the concrete increases the plastic deformation performance. Crack mouths opening displacement is 2 mm in control sample, whereas the fiber mixtures is above 3, 5 mm. Difference between these values clearly shows the effect of fibers on composite which resulted in increase of ductility. Hence the increase in energy absorbance of the composite due to fiber addition is explained. Long fiber additives have more increasing effect on energy absorbance than short fibers. Beside fiber type energy absorbance is also affected by the amount of additive, more fiber addition results in more increase in energy absorbance indeed. The effect of fiber amount is more remarkable by long fibers. According to Stress-Strain graphs, fiber addition has no significant effect on bending strength. It is an expected result when low elasticity modulus polymere fibers are considered. However, when the added fiber amount is 1 %, bending strentgh is decreased. The reason of the decrease is thought to be that fibers do not take enough place within the matrix to affect composites mechanical properties The electron microscopy images show that long fibers physical properties are more effective on increasing the adherence between fiber and matrix. Discrete structure of short fibers contributes to the interphase with matrix. Detachments are seen at the tail ends and surfaces of short fibers. the detachments may be caused of the friction of the aggreagtes during production or tensile forces on fibers during the bending test. Short fibers have less surface roughness and at surface there are less cement paste which affects the adherence. This explains why the short polyolephine fiber concretes have inferior mechanical properties. Fibrilation at the tail ends of long fibers and the surface roughness of the fiber body takes attention. Through this roughness, adhesion between matrix and fiber is increased. In microstructure images it can be clearly seen that there are cement paste remains on fiber surface. It is thought that long fibers have high mechanical properties due to that physical features. Hence {{it can be said that}} this physical properties have also an important effect on long fibers high fracture energy. Yüksek LisansM. Sc...|$|R
