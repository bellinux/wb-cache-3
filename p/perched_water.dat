Hydrogen sulfide gas is present deep in the earth at Mud Volcano. As this gas combines with water and the sulfur is metabolized by cyanobacteria, a solution of sulfuric acid is formed that dissolves the surface soils to create pools and cones of clay and mud. Along with hydrogen sulfide, steam, carbon dioxide, and other gases explode through the layers of mud.|$|E

40|$|A {{computer}} model for welfare assessment in laying hens was constructed. This model, named FOWEL (fowl welfare), uses {{a description of}} the production system as input and produces a welfare score as output. To assess the welfare status a formalized procedure based on scientific knowledge is applied. In FOWEL the production system is described using 25 attributes (space per hen, beak trimming, free range, etc.), each with two or more levels, together defining the characteristics of a production system. A weighting factor is used for each attribute, based on the available scientific knowledge {{of the effects of the}} attribute levels on the welfare aspects. The welfare score of a production system results from the attribute levels combined with the weighting factors. The results show that feeding level, space per hen, <b>perches,</b> <b>water</b> availability and nests were the most important attributes. The attribute free range was of minor importance. FOWEL includes a description of 22 production systems. The welfare score of cage systems was low, of barn and aviary systems medium, and of organic systems high.

50|$|Aeration on a sand-based {{system is}} used more {{to control the}} {{thickness}} of the thatch layer than to relieve compaction. Thatch layers are the accumulation of decomposed vegetative parts of grass plants like stolons and rhizomes at the surface level. A thick thatch layer on a sand-based athletic field may prevent nutrients and water from reaching the soil. Further, fertilizers, fungicides, and insecticides can not penetrate the surface and reach the soil. This can obviously be devastating if a field is consumed by a soil borne disease or insect. Water penetration can also be deterred by a thick thatch layer. When there is a thick mat of organic matter near the surface of a field a second <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> table will form. This will cause roots to stay in the top couple of inches of soil because they do not need to search for water at greater depths. Without a deep root system, a field can become unsafe due to footing issues.|$|E
5000|$|Fertilizer {{trees are}} used in {{agroforestry}} to improve the condition of soils used for farming. They capture nitrogen from the air {{and put it in}} the soil through their roots and falling leaves. [...] They can also bring nutrients from deep in the soil up to the surface for crops with roots that cannot reach that depth. [...] Fertilizer trees are further useful for preventing fertilizer erosion, soil degradation and related desertification, and improving water usage for crops. Sesbania, Gliricidia, Tephrosia, and Faidherbia albida are known as fertilizer trees. Tree Lucerne or Tagasaste (Cytisus proliferus) is a well known fertilizer tree, able to fix more than 587 kg of nitrogen per hectare per year. It can increase maize yields from 1 ton per hectare per year to more than 10 tons ha/year in areas with more than 850mm of rain per year or a <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> table. Tree Lucerne is also used to create and maintain terra preta.|$|E
50|$|Shallow {{landslides}} {{can often}} happen {{in areas that}} have slopes with high permeable soils on top of low permeable bottom soils. The low permeable, bottom soils trap {{the water in the}} shallower, high permeable soils creating high water pressure in the top soils. As the top soils are filled with water and become heavy, slopes can become very unstable and slide over the low permeable bottom soils. Say there is a slope with silt and sand as its top soil and bedrock as its bottom soil. During an intense rainstorm, the bedrock will keep the rain trapped in the top soils of silt and sand. As the topsoil becomes saturated and heavy, it can start to slide over the bedrock and become a shallow landslide.R. H. Campbell did a study on shallow landslides on Santa Cruz Island, California.

The more generic term, potentiometric contours, is used herein rather than ``water-table contours`` because the hydrologic units contributing water to wells and test holes may not accurately represent the water table.

50|$|Within California, vernal pools {{are quite}} {{commonly}} associated with Mima Mounds. These Mima Mounds are typically located on stable landforms that are greater than 100,000 years old. These landforms are characterized by strongly developed soils that usually have a relatively impermeable layer (claypan or silcrete duripan) in the subsoil. This impermeable layer locally impedes drainage and creates <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> levels and causes the formation of vernal pools within the intermound depressions {{that are associated with}} Mima Mounds. Vernal pools are typically small, shallow, and complex ephemeral wetlands that only have internal drainage because they are hydrologically isolated from perennial inflow by a ring of Mima Mounds. Although the ponded water that fills vernal pools comes and goes throughout the year, it is present at least for a short time in most years. However, within California, the mound-depression microrelief associated with Mima Mounds is just one of a variety of geographic settings within which vernal pools occur. For example, in the Modoc Plateau region of California, numerous vernal pools are found on the surface of volcanic mudflows and basalt lava flows where Mima Mounds are completely absent.|$|E
5000|$|In the United States, common {{specifications}} for constructing a sand-based system {{are laid out}} by the United States Golf Association (USGA) and by ASTM International (American Society of Testing and Materials, ASTM F2396 Standard Guide for Construction of High Performance Sand-Based Rootzones for Athletic Fields). The USGA specifications used for a sand-based athletic field {{are the same as}} what is typically used for USGA golf greens. These specifications consist of a 12 to 16 inch sand root zone. The choice of sand type and the addition of an amendment depend on the designer. When an amendment is used, it must be thoroughly incorporated with the sand. The sand overlays a 4-inch gravel layer. [...] This creates a <b>perched</b> <b>water</b> table above the gravel that helps keep the root zone moist during dry conditions. A drainage system is installed below the gravel to carry excess water away from the field. ASTM F2396 methods are more flexible in design and instead of a set specification gives guidance on selecting sand for a more varied range in construction methods. For example, with or without a gravel drainage layer, with or without peat and/or soil amendment, and profile depth variance from 8 to 16+ inches.|$|E

40|$|Seasonally dry {{evergreen}} {{forests in}} southeast Pará, Brazil are transitional between taller closed {{forests of the}} interior Amazon Basin and woodland savannas (cerrados) of Brazil's south-central plains. We describe abiotic and biotic gradients in this region near the frontier town of Redenção where forest structure and composition grade subtly across barely undulating topography. Annual precipitation averaged 1859 mm between 1995 - 2001, with nearly zero rainfall {{during the dry season}} months of June August. Annual vertical migrations of deep-soil water caused by seasonal rainfall underlie edaphic and floristic differences between high- and low-ground terrain. Low-ground soils are hydromorphic, shaped by <b>perching</b> <b>water</b> tables during the wet season, pale gray, brown, or white in color, with coarse texture, low moisture retention during the dry season, and relatively high macro-nutrient status in the surface horizons. Forest canopies on low ground are highly irregular, especially along seasonal streams, while overstory community composition differs demonstrably from that on high ground. High-ground soils are dystrophic, well-drained through the wet season, brown or red-yellow in color, with finer texture, higher moisture retention, and low macro-nutrient status in the surface horizons compared to low-ground soils. Forest canopies are, on average, taller, more regular, and more closed on high ground. Low-ground areas can be envisioned as energy and nutrient sinks, where, because of hydrologic cycles, canopy disturbance likely occurs more frequently than at high-ground positions if not necessarily at larger scales...|$|R
