40|$|A re-evaluation of the taxonomic {{position}} of five strains, one assigned to Cronobacter sakazakii (strain 1330 T), two previously assigned to Cronobacter genomospecies 1 (strains NCTC 9529 T and 731) and two as Cronobacter turicensis (strains 96 and 1435) was carried out. The analysis included a phenotypic characterization, sequencing of the 16 S rRNA gene and multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of seven housekeeping genes (atpD, fusA, glnS, gltB, gyrB, infB, ppsA; 3036 bp). The 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis and MLSA showed strain 1330 T, isolated from spiced meat purchased in Slovakia, {{to form an}} independent <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>line.</b> Cronobacter dublinensis was the closest neighbour species {{on the basis of}} the MLSA. DNA–DNA reassociation and phenotypic analysis revealed that strain 1330 T represented a novel species, for which the name Cronobacter condimenti sp. nov. is proposed, type strain 1330 T = CECT 7863 T, = LMG 26250 T). The four bacterial strains NCTC 9529 T, 731, 96 and 1435, isolated from water, a leg infectionand two food ingredients; onion powder and rye flour, repectively, showed on the phylogenetic tree to cluster together within an independent <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>line,</b> with Cronobacter turicensis as the closest species. The DNA–DNA hybridization data and the phenotypic characterization confirmed that these strains represented a novel species, for which the name Cronobacter universalis sp. nov. is proposed with type strain NCTC 9529 T = CECT 7864 T, = LMG 26249 T...|$|E

40|$|Up to {{few years}} ago, the phylogenies of tardigrade taxa have been {{investigated}} using morphological data, but relationships within and between many taxa are still unresolved. Our aim has been to verify those relationships adding molecular analysis to morphological analysis, using nearly complete 18 S ribosomal DNA gene sequences (five new) of 19 species, as well as cytochrome oxidase subunit 1 (COI) mitochondrial DNA gene sequences (15 new) from 20 species, from a total of seven families. The 18 S rDNA tree was calculated by minimum evolution, maximum parsimony (MP) and maximum likelihood (ML) analyses. DNA sequences coding for COI were translated to amino acid sequences and a tree was also calculated by neighbour-joining, MP and ML analyses. For both trees (18 S rDNA and COI) posterior probabilities were calculated by MrBayes. Prominent findings are as follows: the molecular data on Echiniscidae (Heterotardigrada) {{are in line with}} the phylogenetic relationships identifiable by morphological analysis. Among Eutardigrada, orders Apochela and Parachela are confirmed as sister groups. Ramazzottius (Hypsibiidae) results more related to Macrobiotidae than to the genera here considered of Hypsibiidae. Macrobiotidae and Macrobiotus result not monophyletic and confirm morphological data on the presence of at least two large groups within Macrobiotus. Using 18 S rDNA and COI mtDNA genes, a new <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>line</b> has been identified within Macrobiotus, corresponding to the richtersi-areolatus group. Moreover, cryptic species have been identified within the Macrobiotus richtersi group and within Richtersius. Some evolutionary lines of tardigrades are confirmed, but others suggest taxonomic revision.

40|$|Anoxygenic phototrophic {{bacteria}} are widely distributed in marine sediments and shallow {{waters of the}} coastal zone, where they often form intensely colored mass developments. The phototrophic bacteria have adapted to the whole spectrum of salt concentrations, from freshwater to saturated brines, and {{it is apparent that}} individual species have adapted well to particular habitats and mineral salts compositions, both qualitatively and quantitatively. This adaptation is reflected not only in the demand for defined ranges of salt concentrations, but also in the phylogenetic relationships of these bacteria, as established by 16 S rDNA sequences. Major phylogenetic branches of purple sulfur {{bacteria are}} represented by: (1) marine and extremely halophilic Ectothiorhodospiraceae, (2) truly marine and halophilic Chromatiaceae and (3) freshwater Chromatiaceae, some of which are tolerant to low salt concentrations and are successful competitors in brackish and marine habitats. Quite similarly, salt-dependent green sulfur bacteria form distinct <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>lines.</b> In addition, also among the phototrophic α-Proteobacteria (purple nonsulfur bacteria), distinct <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>lines</b> of salt-dependent species are recognized.

A few generic names have been introduced, but mainly in checklists without any real indication of what these names stand for. After a detailed investigation of characters in the apothecia, conidiomata, anatomical structures, as well as morphology and secondary chemistry, it is clear that several, more or less distinctive, <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>lines</b> exist among taxa which earlier were accommodated inCetraria.

40|$|Circadian {{organization}} {{means the}} way in which the entire circadian system above the cellular level is put together physically and the principles and rules that determine the interactions among its component parts which produce overt rhythms of physiology and behavior. Understanding this organization and its evolution is of practical importance as well as of basic interest. The first major problem that we face is the difficulty of making sense of the apparently great diversity that we observe in circadian organization of diverse vertebrates. Some of this diversity falls neatly into place along <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>lines</b> leading to firm generalizations: i) in all vertebrates there is a "circadian axis" consisting of the retinas, the pineal gland and the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN), ii) in many non-mammalian vertebrates of all classes (but not in any mammals) the pineal gland is both a photoreceptor and a circadian oscillator, and iii) in all non-mammalian vertebrates (but not in any mammals) there are extraretinal (and extrapineal) circadian photoreceptors. An interesting explanation of some of these facts, especially the differences between mammals and other vertebrates, can be constructed on the assumption that early in their evolution mammals passed through a "nocturnal bottleneck". On the other hand, a good deal of the diversity among the circadian systems of vertebrates does not fall neatly into place along <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>lines.</b> In the present review we will consider how we might better understand such "phylogenetically incoherent" diversity and what sorts of new information may help to further our understanding of the evolution of circadian organization in vertebrate...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background E. sakazakii is {{considered}} to be an opportunistic pathogen, implicated in food borne diseases causing meningitis or enteritis especially in neonates and infants. Cultural standard identification procedures for E. sakazakii include the observation of yellow pigmentation of colonies and a positive glucosidase activity. Up to now, only one PCR system based on a single available 16 S rRNA gene sequence has been published for E. sakazakii identification. However, in our hands a preliminary evaluation of this system to a number of target and non-target strains showed significant specificity problems of this system. In this study full-length 16 S rRNA genes of thirteen E. sakazakii strains from food, environment and human origin as well as the type strain ATCC 51329 were sequenced. Based on this sequence data a new specific PCR system for E. sakazakii was developed and evaluated. Results By phylogenetic analysis of the new full-length 16 S rRNA gene sequence data obtained we could show the presence of a second phylogenetic distinct lineage within the E. sakazakii species. The newly developed 16 S rRNA gene targeting PCR system allows identification of E. sakazakii strains from both lineages. The assay's ability to correctly identify different E. sakazakii isolates as well as to differentiate E. sakazakii from other closely related Enterobacteriaceae species and other microorganisms was shown on 75 target and non-target strains. Conclusion By this study we are presenting a specific and reliable PCR identification system, which is able to correctly identify E. sakazakii isolates from both phylogenetic distinct lines within the E. sakazakii species. The impact of this second newly described <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>line</b> within the E. sakazakii species in view of clinical and food safety aspects need further investigation. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{cytochrome}} b/c 1 {{complex is}} an ubiquitous energy transducing enzyme, {{part of the}} electron transport chain of prokaryotes, mitochondria, and chloroplasts (b 6 /f). In the ancient purple photosynthetic bacteria, the b/c 1 complex occupies a central metabolic role, being part of their photosynthetic and respiratory electron transport chain. In Rhodobacter the three subunits of the b/c 1 complex are FeS protein, cytochrome b, and cytochrome c 1, and they are encoded by a constitutively expressed operon named fbc. The organization of the genes for the cytochrome b/c 1 complex, the modality of transcription, and the biogenesis of the encoded polypeptides will be described. The Rhodobacter species used to isolate the fbc genes, previously reported as R. sphaeroides was identified as R. capsulatus. Further biochemical characterization of the prokaryotic b/c 1 complex indicated that the three polypeptides encoded by the fbc operon comprise the entire catalytic structure: ubiquinol-cytochrome-c reductase. The amino acid sequences of the three b/c 1 subunits from the photosynthetic bacterium Rhodobacter capsulatus were compared with the corresponding sequences from yeast mitochondria and spinach chloroplasts. The high homology found between the sequences of all three redox polypeptides from R. capsulatus and yeast mitochondria (cytochrome b 41 %, FeS protein 46 %, cytochrome c 1 31 %) provided further evidence that mitochondria arose from the <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>line</b> of purple bacteria. The structure of cytochrome b also exhibited considerable homology to chloroplast cytochrome b 6 plus subunit IV (26 %). The amino acid sequence of the Rieske FeS protein from R. capsulatus and chloroplasts {{were found to be}} conserved only in the C-terminal part (14 % total identity), whereas the homology between cytochrome c 1 and cytochrome f is very weak (12 %), despite similar topology of the two polypeptides. Analysis of the homology suggested that the catalytic sites quinol oxidase (Q 0) and quinone reductase (Qi) arose monophonetically, whereas cytochrome c and plastocyanin reductase sites are not homologous and could derive from diverse ancestral genes by convergent evolution...|$|E
40|$|Chromosomal genotypes of 2, 209 {{isolates}} {{of the six}} {{polysaccharide capsule}} types of Haemophilus influenzae recovered from human hosts worldwide were characterized by an analysis of electrophoretically demonstrable allelic profiles at 17 metabolic enzyme loci. For 222 representative isolates, {{restriction fragment length polymorphism}} patterns produced by digestion of cap region DNA were also determined. With few exceptions, isolates belonging to individual <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>lines</b> or groups of allied lineages identified by multilocus enzyme electrophoresis had characteristic cap region restriction fragment length polymorphism patterns and characteristic combinations of cap region patterns and outer membrane protein types. The occurrence of strong associations of characters and the recovery of isolates with identical genetic properties in widely separated geographic regions and over a 40 -year period indicated that the population structure of encapsulated H. influenzae is clonal. Recombination of chromosomal genes, including those mediating capsule synthesis, apparently is not {{a major factor in the}} short-term evolution of these pathogenic organisms and, therefore, may be of minor clinical significance...|$|R
40|$|Fluorescencein situ {{hybridization}} (FISH) of microlibraries established from distinct chromosome subregions {{can test}} the evolutionary conservation of chromosome bands {{as well as}} chromosomal rearrangements that occurred during primate evolution and will help to clarify phylogenetic relationships. We used a DNA library established by microdissection and microcloning from the entire long arm of human chromosome 2 for fluorescencein situ hybridization and comparative mapping of the chromosomes of human, great apes (Pan troglodytes, Pan paniscus, Gorilla gorilla, Pongo pygmaeus) and Old World monkeys (Macaca fuscata andCercopithecus aethiops). Inversions {{were found in the}} pericentric region of the primate chromosome 2 p homologs in great apes, and the hybridization pattern demonstrates the known phylogenetically derived telomere fusion in the line that leads to human chromosome 2. The hybridization of the 2 q microlibrary to chromosomes of Old World monkeys gave a different pattern from that in the gorilla and the orang-utan, but a pattern similar to that of chimpanzees. This suggests convergence of chromosomal rearrangements in different <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>lines.</b> ...|$|R
40|$|The {{widespread}} {{occurrence of}} linear mitochondrial genomes evokes intriguing questions concerningthe evolutionary origin and mechanisms {{leading to the}} emergence and stabilization of linear DNAgenophores. The study of their replication strategies opens a unique possibility of discoveringalternative solutions to the end-replication problem and of elucidating how these mechanisms haveappeared in evolution. The analysis of linear mitochondrial genomes in organisms belonging todifferent <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>lines</b> indicates that their evolutionary emergence was accompanied by thegeneration of various types of terminal structures, the adaptation of existing replication machineryand by the application of different strategies of the telomere replication. This scenario is illustratedby the molecular anatomy and replication of the linear mitochondrial genome in the opportunistyeast pathogen Candida parapsilosis. Recent studies have revealed the existence of extragenomicminicircular molecules derived from the telomere repeats that seem {{to participate in the}} novelpathway of telomere maintenance. Importantly, several lines of evidence indicate that a similarmechanism may also be involved in the alternative, telomerase-independent, maintenance of nucleartelomeres in higher eukaryotes, including human telomerase-negative tumor cells...|$|R
40|$|Today, {{angiosperms}} {{are fundamental}} {{players in the}} diversity and biogeochemical functioning of the planet. Yet despite the omnipresence of angiosperms in today's ecosystems, the basic evolutionary {{understanding of how the}} earliest angiosperms functioned remains unknown. Here we synthesize ecophysiological, paleobotanical, paleoecological, and <b>phylogenetic</b> <b>lines</b> of evidence about early angiosperms and their environments. In doing so, we arrive at a hypothesis that early angiosperms evolved in evermoist tropical terrestrial habitats, where three of their emblematic innovations – including net-veined leaves, xylem vessels, and flowers – found ecophysiological advantages. However, the adaptation of early angiosperm ecophysiology to wet habitats did not initially promote massive diversification and ecological dominance. Instead, wet habitats were permissive for the ecological roothold of the clade, a critical phase of early diversification that entailed experimentation with a range of functional innovations in the leaves, wood, and flowers. Later, our results suggest that some of these innovations were co-opted gradually for new roles in the evolution of greater productivity and drought tolerance, which are characteristics seen across the vast majority of derived and ecologically dominant angiosperms today...|$|R
