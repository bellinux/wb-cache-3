50|$|Since the {{equivalence}} {{ratio of the}} <b>premixed</b> <b>gases</b> may be controlled, premixed combustion offers a means to attain low temperatures and, thereby, reduce NOx emissions. Due to improved mixing in comparison with diffusion flames, soot formation is mitigated as well. Premixed combustion has therefore gained significance in recent times.

5000|$|A {{turbulent}} premixed flame can {{be assumed}} to propagate as a surface composed of an ensemble of laminar flames {{so long as the}} processes that determine the inner structure of the flame are not affected. Under such conditions, the flame surface is wrinkled by virtue of turbulent motion in the <b>premixed</b> <b>gases</b> increasing the surface area of the flame. The wrinkling process increases the burning velocity of the turbulent premixed flame in comparison to its laminar counterpart.|$|E

For 100 % CO 2, 100 % N 2 O and 10 % N 2 O +  90 % of CO 2, a Thermoflator was used with CO 2, N 2 O or a <b>premixed</b> <b>gas</b> (10 % N 2 O +  90 % CO 2), respectively.

40|$|Numerical {{simulation}} of laminar flames in <b>premixed</b> <b>gases</b> is addressed. Various efforts {{to solve the}} laminar flame problem are briefly described, and basic equations to be modeled in a comprehensive description of laminar flames are discussed along with the physical and chemical processes represented by these equations and the numerical requirements to model them. Two flame methods are discussed in some detail: a numerical model for studying transient phenomena and its 2 D counterpart method. The various input parameters needed for the models are addressed, {{and the use of}} the models is illustrated in several studies of laminar flames in <b>premixed</b> <b>gases.</b> Flammability limits and multidimensional flame propagation are also examined...|$|E
40|$|AbstractA {{random choice}} method is {{introduced}} for the one-dimensional reaction-diffusion model of laminar flame propagation in <b>premixed</b> <b>gases.</b> The method uses piecewise steady flames {{to calculate the}} general unsteady flowfields.

The validity of the method is established and applications to time-dependent flame propagation are carried out...|$|E
40|$|Flow fields {{involving}} turbulent flames in <b>premixed</b> <b>gases</b> under {{a variety}} of conditions are modeled by the use of a numerical technique based on the random vortex method to solve the Navier-Stokes equations and a flame propagation algorithm to trace the motion of the front and implement the Huygens principle, both due to Chorin. A successive over-relaxation hybrid method is applied to solve the Euler equation for flows in an arbitrarily shaped domain. The method of images, conformal transformation, and the integral-equation technique are also used to treat flows in special cases, according to their particular requirements. Salient features of turbulent flame propagation in <b>premixed</b> <b>gases</b> are interpreted by relating them to the aerodynamic properties of the flow field. Included among them is the well-known cellular structure of flames stabilized by bluff bodies, as well as the formation of the characteristic tulip shape of flames propagating in ducts. In its rudimentary form, the mechanism of propagation of a turbulent flame is shown to consist of: (1) rotary motion of eddies at the flame front, (2) self-advancement of the front at an appropriate normal burning speed, and (3) dynamic effects of expansion due to exothermicity of the combustion reaction. An idealized model is used to illustrate these fundamental mechanisms and to investigate basic aerodynamic features of flames in <b>premixed</b> <b>gases.</b> The case of a confined flame stabilized behind a rearward-facing step is given particular care and attention. Solutions are shown to be in satisfactory agreement with experimental results, especially with respect to global properties such as the average velocity profiles and reattachment length...|$|E
40|$|Premixed-gas flames {{subject to}} steady spatially-varying {{straining}} flows were studied to examine {{one aspect of}} premixed flames in strongly turbulent flows where strain rate gradients are present and local strain rates may be high enough to cause local flame-front extinguishment. The spatially-varying straining flows were created using a counterflow slot-jet burner with slightly non-parallel jet exits. When the flow configuration was <b>premixed</b> combustible <b>gas</b> vs. cold inert gas, so that only a single flame was produced, steady flame “edges ” could be created where the flame would exist in the low-strain region but would be extinguished in the high-strain region. When the flow configuration was <b>premixed</b> <b>gas</b> vs. <b>premixed</b> <b>gas,</b> twin flames would exist in the low-strain region that converged to a corner-like tip in the high-strain region. For both configurations the local strain {{at the location of}} the stationary flame edge was somewhat lower than the strain required to extinguish flames in the same mixture subject to a spatially uniform strain. The difference was greater for the twin-flame configuration, particularly at high Lewis number (Le). Due to diffusive-thermal instabilities, cellular flames were observed at low Le and travelling-wave patterns were observed at high Le. Le effects also led to the formation o...|$|R

That this close connection between combustion science and chemistry continues is well illustrated by the work of C. N. Hinshelwood and N. N. Semenov in elucidating chain reaction mechanisms, for which they shared the 1956 Nobel Prize.

40|$|Detonation has {{received}} attention of late {{because of its}} role as the primary combustion mechanism in rocket and airbreathing Pulse Detonation Engines (PDEs). However, there are many unresolved {{issues related to the}} proper utilization of detonation combustion in these applications. The detonation process has been studied predominantly under the assumption of <b>premixed</b> <b>gases.</b> However, the unsteady nature of PDEs requires relatively small tunes to inject and mix the propellants prior to each cyclic detonation; and this condition is difficult to achieve experimentally.

40|$|In lean {{premixed}} combustion systems, inadequate {{mixing of}} the fuel and air, prior to combustion can cause unnecessarily large pollutant emissions. Measuring the extent of mixing of fuel into air is often difficult, since combustion in lean <b>premixed</b> <b>gas</b> turbines takes place at high pressures, often making optical access to the combustion area limited. In addition, the pressure broadening of the molecular absorption lines renders the spectrally narrow line associated with a laser light source less useful. This paper studies {{some of the problems}} in determining the extent of mixing {{of the fuel}} into air in these lean premixed combustion systems. The focus of this paper is the use of an infrared light emitting diode (IR-LED) to quantitatively measure fuel concentration in a lean <b>premixed</b> <b>gas</b> turbine. The IR-LED emits radiation over a wide wavelength range compared to a laser, meaning that the development of an absorption coefficient to relate the fuel concentration to the absorption of the IR-LED radiation is not as direct as developing the absorption coefficient for the absorption of laser light. Controlled experiments were performed where the pressure, path length and fuel concentration were varied and the effects of these three parameters on the absorption of radiation from the IR-LED were studied. A broad band absorption coefficient was developed relating the absorption of light from the IR-LED to the fuel concentration. This broad band absorption coefficient was found to be in good agreement with calculated coefficient values. Experiments were performed on a lean <b>premixed</b> <b>gas</b> turbine combustor modified for line-of-sight optical access. The concentration profile of this high pressure combustor was found by tomographic reconstruction from line-of-sight absorption measurements using the IR-LED. We demonstrated that the IR-LED can be used for quantitative measurements of the fuel concentration for high pressure systems...|$|R

The validity of the {{algorithm is}} demonstrated by application to flame propagation problems for which exact solutions exist. The flame speed evaluated by its use oscillates around the exact value at a relatively small amplitude, while the temperature and species concentration profiles are self-correcting in their convergence to the exact solution.
