The important design parameters of the <b>Pilger</b> <b>mill</b> machine are feed rate and profile of the grooved die. Optimum design procedure was conducted in order to investigate effects on forming load and the deformed shape of a material depending on the die surface profiles. Profiles of the die surface for the optimum design were testified with linear, cosine and quadratic curves considering physical forming process. The results of the analyses provided that {{the model of the}} quadratic profile gave the lowest forming load and the proper deformed shape...|$|E
40|$|Quality heating of {{the steel}} charge to be rolled into {{seamless}} tubes in the rotating-hearth furnace requires continuous operation of the <b>pilger</b> <b>mill.</b> Interruption of the charging schedule leads to impaired charge heating process. Prolonged heating time causes {{a rise in the}} charge temperature above the limit values, and that in turn brings to a larger quantity of scale formed on the charge surface. Final result is loss of metal and overheating of the charge accompanied by increased fuel consumption and lower furnace productivity...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT. The subject {{project is}} also an attempt to use modern day {{analysis}} software to optimize mechanical designs. Particularly the software {{has been instrumental in}} ideating modifications to address repeated failures encountered in a shaft analyzing and optimizing design. The genesis of the project lies in repeated failures encountered in eccentric shaft of Main Drive Gear Box (MDGB) of a <b>pilger</b> <b>mill.</b> The failure mode and root cause had been identified by NFC. The project has analyzed deeply the existing conditions, simulated and validated results for existing shaft to get optimum solution. The progressive deterioration of the strength of a material or structural component during service such that failure can occur at much lower stress levels than the ultimate stress of the material. Fatigue is a dynamic phenomenon that initiates small (micro) cracks in the material or component and causes them to grow into large (macro) cracks. These crack if not detected can lead to catastrophic failure...|$|E

40|$|International audienceFor new fast-neutron {{sodium-cooled}} Generation IV nuclear reactors, {{the candidate}} cladding {{materials for the}} very strong burn-up are ferritic and martensitic oxide dispersion strengthened grades. Classically, the cladding tube is cold formed by a sequence of cold <b>pilger</b> <b>milling</b> passes with intermediate heat treatments. This process acts upon the geometry and the microstructure of the tubes. Consequently, crystallographic texture, grain sizes and morphologies, and tube integrity are highly dependent on the pilgering parameters. In order to optimize the resulting mechanical properties of cold-rolled cladding tubes, {{it is essential to}} have a thorough understanding of the pilgering process. Finite Element Method (FEM) models are used for the numerical predictions of this task; however, the accuracy of the numerical predictions depends not only on the type of constitutive laws but also {{on the quality of the}} material parameters identification. Therefore, a Chaboche-type law which parameters have been identified on experimental observation of the mechanical behavior of the material is used here. As a complete three-dimensional FEM mechanical analysis of the high-precision tube rolling (HPTR) cold pilgering of tubes could be very expensive, only the evolution of geometry and deformation is addressed in this work. The computed geometry is compared to the experimental one. It is shown that the evolution of the geometry and deformation is not homogeneous over the circumference. Moreover, it is exposed that the strain is nonhomogeneous in the radial, tangential, and axial directions. Finally, it is seen that the dominant deformation mode of a material point evolves during HPTR cold pilgering forming...|$|R
40|$|Cold rolling {{processes}} implemented on {{the periodic}} pilger mills with roller-type stands {{are widely used}} in pipes manufacturing. The theoretical basics of cold rolling process are developed fully enough, thus allowing us to assess technological parameters of this process. However, to meet high requirements for the surface quality, accuracy, and mechanical properties of the pipe material {{it is necessary to}} create new and improve available rolling techniques, optimize process parameters, select new technological lubricants, develop new materials for the rolls and mandrel. Using the numerical analysis methods, e. g. a finite element method (FEM) can solve these problems. In this regard, the paper presents the FEM simulation results of the cold rolling pipe process on <b>pilger</b> <b>mill</b> using the ANSYS / LS-DYNA 10. 0 software. The paper considers a coupled task of cold rolling. When solving it, along with mechanical task the transient heat transfer was solved, because heat release in the work-piece due to its plastic deformation was taken into account. The finite element modeling results allowed us to obtain the work-piece temperature and stress-strain state data during rolling, as well as the rolling energy and power parameters. The paper shows that despite the significant degree of metal deformation during cold rolling, there is a principle possibility to apply Lagrangian finite element meshes for modeling the similar processes provided that special finite elements and settings to exclude arising parasitic energy and large distortions of elements when solving are used. Because the maximum temperature in the work-piece during rolling does not exceed the recrystallization temperature of steel, there is no need in using the viscoplastic materials. The obtained results on changing the rolling force components can be advantageously used to design the working tool and change the kinematics of the rolling process in order to optimize the energy and power parameters of rolling. </p...|$|E
40|$|The {{lubricants}} {{that are}} used today by Sandvik Materials Technology AB in the cold pilger process contain chlorinated paraffins. Due to environmental, economic and health reasons, these lubricants have to be replaced. The method for trying out new pilger lubricants today is full scale trials in cold <b>pilger</b> <b>mills.</b> The main aim of this thesis has been to investigate whether {{it is possible to}} evaluate pilger lubricants by using some standard laboratory tribological test methods. In addition to this, a review of published literature and a description of the cold pilger process in tribological terms have also been conducted. The literature review included the published work pertaining to cold pilgering in tribology related scientific journals and books. This review indicated that only very limited information is available in open literature and the survey was therefore broadened to include other similar metal working processes. The test methods that have been used are the sliding four ball test machine and the SRV (Schwingung Reibung Verschlei√ü) reciprocating friction and wear tester. The test specimens for the four ball machine were standard bearing steel balls. In the SRV tests, cylinder on disc and a ball on disc test specimen configurations were used. The cylinder specimens were manufactured from the tube material and the disc specimens were made of mandrel material. The balls for the SRV were made of standard stainless steel. In the four ball machine, both the wear preventive characteristics and extreme pressure properties have been evaluated. In the SRV Optimol machine, seizure and wear tests have been performed. To analyse the surfaces, Wyko 1100 NT optical surface profiler has been used. A more thorough analysis of test specimen surfaces was also carried out by using SEM/EDS at SMT. The results show that the SRV cylinder on disc and ball on disc seizure tests are very representative of the cold pilger process. The ranking of various lubricant formulations from these tests correlate very well to the ranking from the full scale cold pilger trials. The surface damage modes and material transfer in the tests correspond well with those observed in the actual process. The SRV wear test corresponds only to a limited extent and {{the reason for this is}} that the ranking of cold pilger lubricants is not based on wear. The four ball EP tests do not correlate that well with the real ranking. This is attributed to the use of different test specimen material in four ball tests as compared to that actual tube/mandrel materials and the test method may not reproduce the conditions prevalent in the cold pilger process. The four ball wear tests do not correlate at all to the actual ranking of lubricant formulations owing to the same reasons and also in view of the fact that the ranking is not based on wear.
