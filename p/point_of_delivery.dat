5|$|England captain Norman Yardley won the toss {{and elected}} to bat despite the dull light; Trent Bridge had {{reputation}} for being favourable to batsmen, and in the previous Test between Australia and England at the ground in 1938, four Englishmen scored centuries as the hosts made 658, before Stan McCabe of Australia made 232 runs himself. The first innings set {{the pattern of the}} series as the English top order struggled against Australia's pace attack. Only twenty minutes of play was possible before lunch on the first day due to inclement weather, and the opening pair of Washbrook and Hutton {{had to deal with the}} contrasting bowling actions of Lindwall—with a low, somewhat round-arm action—and Miller, who extracted more bounce from a higher arm at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery.</b> In the first two overs, the Australian pairing extracted little bounce and it seemed as though the hosts would be in a strong position to make a large score on a placid track if they made a solid start. Lindwall bowled the first ball of the match at a moderate pace, and Hutton pushed it square of the wicket on the off side for a single to start proceedings. Gradually, the Australian bowlers got into their rhythm and began to raise their pace. Miller induced an edge from Washbrook in his first over, but it bounced before reaching a fielder. In his second over, Miller bowled Hutton for three with a faster ball that skidded off the pitch to leave England at 9/1. The ball went between bat and pads as Hutton moved forward onto his front foot. The journalist and former Australian Test leg spinner Bill O'Reilly criticised Hutton for not moving his leg across to the pitch of the ball, thereby leaving a gap between bat and pad.|$|E
25|$|Cricket balls can be bowled {{at close}} to 160km/h (100mph) by pace bowlers and made to deviate from a {{straight}} course, both in the air (known as 'swinging') and off the ground (known as 'seaming'). A spin bowler imparts lateral revolutions on the ball at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery,</b> so that when it bounces it deviates from a straight course. As cricket bats have become thicker, the ball can now be hit well over 100 metres before touching the ground.|$|E
25|$|High full pitched balls {{that pass}} or would have {{passed on the}} full above waist height of the striker are deemed dangerously unfair, except for slow deliveries, where the rule is above {{shoulder}} height. The same sanctions apply to high full pitched balls as apply to fast short pitched balls. Such deliveries, which are called beamers, can be incredibly dangerous. Usually they only occur by mistake, when a ball slips in the bowler's hand at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> and bowlers usually immediately apologise to the batsman for their mistake. If they are bowled deliberately, no ball is immediately called, the bowler is removed and is reported to the authority to which {{he is responsible for}} further disciplinary action.|$|E

500|$|After {{the lines}} cross the Quebec-Labrador border, {{also known as}} the Hydro-Québec <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery,</b> the {{direction}} of the lines becomes due south, and they head to the Montagnais Substation, a substation accessible only by an airport adjacent to it. A lone 735kV line stems off from the substation, heading to an open pit mine [...] the northwest. The terrain crossed by the power lines becomes hilly and mountainous south of the border. The lines reach over [...] in elevation before descending. The three lines continue heading south until they reach a substation on the North Shore of the Gulf of Saint Lawrence. From there on, the three lines parallel the North Shore as the Gulf narrows to the southwest toward the Saint Lawrence River discharge mouth. The northernmost power line then diverges from the other two to connect with Manic-Outardes power stations located on and around the Rivière aux Outardes and the Manicouagan River.|$|E
500|$|O'Reilly {{was one of}} {{the best}} spin bowlers ever to play cricket. He {{delivered}} the ball from a two-fingered grip at close to medium pace with great accuracy, and could produce leg breaks, googlies, and top spinners, with no discernible change in his action. A tall man for a spinner (around 188cm, 6ft 2in), he whirled his arms to an unusual extent and had a low <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> that meant it was very difficult for the batsman to read the flight of the ball out of his hand. When O'Reilly died, Sir Donald Bradman said that he was the greatest bowler he had ever faced or watched. In 1935, Wisden wrote of him: [...] "O'Reilly {{was one of the}} best examples in modern cricket of what could be described as a 'hostile' bowler." [...] In 1939, Wisden reflected on Bill O'Reilly's successful 1938 Ashes tour of England: [...] "He is emphatically one of the greatest bowlers of all time." ...|$|E

Whilst reducing bureaucracy in the NHS, the party would also aim to invest a further £5 billion to train 40,000 more nurses in addition to 10,000 extra doctors. Free dental and eye treatment would be restored and foreign visitors {{would be required to}} possess private medical insurance during their time in the UK. It would seek to return more community services, like the NHS, into public ownership where they have been privatised entirely or in-part, including prisons and the Post Office. It would reserve the UK's wider welfare system to cater exclusively for British citizens; they would also limit the amount of tax credits a childless, able-bodied citizen could receive to 80% of the weekly national minimum wage as well as restrict child benefit payments for households with more than two juveniles and/or a combined annual income of over £50,000.

2500|$|Leg spin {{is a type}} of spin bowling in {{the sport}} of cricket. A leg spinner bowls right-arm with a wrist spin action, causing the ball to spin from right to left in the cricket pitch, at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery.</b> When the ball bounces, the spin causes the ball to deviate sharply from right to left, that is, away from the leg side of a {{right-handed}} batsman. The same kind of trajectory, which spins from right to left on pitching, when performed by a left-arm bowler is known as left-arm orthodox spin bowling.|$|E

40|$|The paper {{examines}} some of {{the main}} political economy dynamics of the policy initiatives on rural development that have been taken since 2003, and provides an overview of the main issues that they are addressing. The paper first outlines the major agrarian problems that have emerged over the recent decade and more, indicating their main political-economy causations, and then systematically analyses the prospects of the new policy initiatives to deal with them. Among the new policies the initiatives to reorganise the finance system through a reform of the roles of the county and a development of town and township governments to become <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> <b>of</b> public goods and social services are highlighted as particularly potent. Further importance is associated with reforms that strengthen the role of rural residents as citizens.

2500|$|In 1728, the Schermerhorn Family {{established}} {{trade with}} the city of Charleston, South Carolina. Subsequently, rice and [...] indigo came from Charleston. At the time, the port was also the focal <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> of goods from England. In 1776, during the American Revolutionary War, the British occupied the port, adversely affecting port trade for eight years. In 1783, many traders returned to England, and most port enterprises collapsed. The port quickly recovered from the post-war crisis. From 1797 until the middle of 19th century, New York had the country's largest system of maritime trade. From 1815 to 1860 the port was called the Port of New York.|$|E
2500|$|Off the field, Blythe {{played the}} violin and Harry Altham, writing in Barclay's World of Cricket, {{said that his}} slow left arm action [...] "reflected the {{sensitive}} touch {{and the sense of}} rhythm of a musician", the left arm emerging from behind his back [...] "in a long and graceful arc". Blythe is generally considered {{to be one of the}} best left-arm spin bowlers of all time., who had complete mastery of flight and spin, bowled consistently to a full length and made effective use of his fingers at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> to determine if the ball would be an orthodox break or a late inswinger, either of which was a difficult ball to face on a pitch that helped the bowler.|$|E
2500|$|Denmark has a {{universal}} health care system, characterised by being publicly financed through taxes and, {{for most of the}} services, run directly by the regional authorities. One of the sources of income is a national health care contribution (...) (2007–11:8%; '12:7%; '13:6%; '14:5%; '15:4%; '16:3%; '17:2%; '18:1%; '19:0%) but it is being phased out and will be gone from January 2019, with the income taxes in the lower brackets being raised gradually each year instead. Another source comes from the municipalities that had their income taxes raised by 3 percentage points from 1 January 2007, a contribution confiscated from the former county tax to be used from 1 January 2007 for health purposes by the municipalities instead. This means that most health care provision is free at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> for all residents. Additionally, roughly two in five have complementary private insurance to cover services not fully covered by the state, such as physiotherapy. , Denmark spends 11.2% of its GDP on health care; this is up from 9.8% in 2007 (US$3,512 per capita). This places Denmark above the OECD average and above the other Nordic countries.|$|E

40|$|This {{work is a}} {{compilation}} of four manuscripts, three of which are published and one is {{in the second round}} of review, all in refereed journals. All four manuscripts focus on analysis of stochastic disruptions to support design of capacitated engineered networks. The work is motivated by limited ability to mitigate elevated risk exposure of large-scale capacitated enterprise networks functioning in lean environments. Such inability to sustain enterprise capacity in the face of disruptions of various origins has been causing multi-billion enterprise forfeitures and hefty insurance premiums. At the same time, decision support methodologies for reliable design of dynamic capacitated networks have been largely unavailable. This work is organized as follows. Paper 1 presents a methodology to analyze ca- pacitated healthcare supply chains using a framework of forward ow-matching networks with multiple <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery.</b> Special emphasis is given to developing stochastic models for capturing capacity trajectories at the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery.</b> Paper 2 focuses on assuring capacity availability for a critical vertex exposed to random stepwise capacity disruptions with exponentially distributed interarrival times and uniformly distributed magnitudes. We explore two countermeasure policies for a risk-neutral decision maker who seeks to maxi- mize the long-run average reward. We present an extensive numerical analysis as well as a sensitivity study on the uctuations of some system parameter values. Paper 3 extends the capacity assurance analysis for critical vertices by considering stepwise partial system capacity loss accumulating over time. We examine implementation of a countermeasure policy, aimed at reducing the disruption rate, for a risk-neutral decision maker who seeks to maximize long-run average return. We explore how the policy of maintaining the optimal disruption rate is aected by a number of system parameters. Finally, Paper 4 presents a dynamic predictive methodology for mitigation of cross-regional pandemic outbreaks which can be used to estimate workforce capacity loss for critical vertices due to such societal disasters...|$|R

2500|$|Shane Warne {{also thought}} very highly of Hooper's {{footwork}} and, in 2008, named him {{among the top}} 100 cricketers of his time, citing in particular his ability to disguise his dances down the track. [...] Warne felt that determining when a batsman {{was going to give}} the charge {{was one of the most}} important things for a spinner, and that Hooper was the best at making it indeterminable. [...] "During the 1995 series," [...] he wrote, [...] "this really nagged away at me, because I couldn't spot any of the usual clues even though I knew there had to be a sign that would give him away. [...] On a number of occasions, I stopped at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery</b> to see if he was giving anything away with his footwork. [...] Most batsmen would be looking to get out of their ground at that point, whereas Hooper just stayed set. [...] In the end, after watching him closely time after time, I managed to crack it. [...] When he wanted to hit over the top, he just looked at me instead of tapping his crease as usual and looking down. Of course, my knowing what he was going to do did not always stop him from doing it." ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{estimation}} of historians, and later politicians of the major parties, the most successful and permanent program {{was the creation of}} a National Health Servicem which started operations in 1947. It entitled all citizens to healthcare, which, funded by taxation, was free at the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>delivery.</b> The opposition from physicians was bought off by allowing them to keep lucrative private practices on the side. [...] All hospitals were nationalized and brought into the system. [...] John Carrier and Ian Kendall find that the mission for Minister of Health Aneurin Bevan was resolving [...] "The potential conflict between the aim of providing a universalist, comprehensive health service of a good standard and that of containing health costs to a reasonable level, and how to finance the system {{in such a way that}} certainty and sufficiency of funds could be guaranteed." [...] Michael Foot adds that Bevan had to persuade [...] "the most conservative and respected profession in the country to accept and operate the Labour government's most intrinsically socialist proposition. [...] In the end historians give Bevan the major credit for the success. Bevan left the Health ministry in 1951 and could never regain his level of success. For all his wit and brilliance, Bevan proved a difficult colleague and feuded with fellow Labour leaders using his strong political base as a weapon. [...] Conservative politicians hated him and he called them [...] "vermin." [...] Kenneth O. Morgan says, [...] "Bevan alone kept the flag of left-wing socialism aloft throughout — which gave him a matchless authority amongst the constituency parties and in party conference." ...|$|E
