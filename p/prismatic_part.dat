40|$|AbstractHigh {{demand of}} wide use of {{three-dimensional}} operation models in process planning {{has resulted in}} an urgent exploration of new approaches to 3 D manufacturing process design. In this paper, 3 D process dimension and manufacturing tolerance design issue is studied. A 3 D tolerance zone calculation method is developed. The method consists of two procedures including 3 D tolerance zone modeling and its calculation. Small displacement torsors (SDT), {{in conjunction with the}} robotics kinematics, are utilized to establish the algebra model of the 3 D tolerance zone and the tolerance propagation model. Convex sets theory is applied in the calculation and optimization {{of the size of the}} zone. The proposed method facilitates the design of the tolerance of the zone by using the variation ranges of uncertain parameters instead of the tolerance distribution. An example of 3 D manufacturing tolerance design for a <b>prismatic</b> <b>part</b> is provided with Monte Carlo simulation results to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach...|$|E
40|$|Tolerance {{measure is}} an {{important}} part of engineering, however, to date the system of applying this important technology has been left to the assessment of the engineer using appropriate guidelines. This work offers a major departure from the trial and error or random number generation techniques that have been used previously by using a knowledge-based system to ensure the intelligent optimisation within the manufacturing system. A system to optimise manufacturing tolerance allocation to a part known as Knowledge-based Automatic Tolerance Analysis (KATA) has been developed. KATA is a knowledge-based system shell built within AutoCAD. It has the ability for geometry creation in CAD and the capability to optimise the tolerance heuristically as an expert system. Besides the worst-case tolerancing equation to optimise the tolerance allocation, KATA's algorithm is supported by actual production information such as machine capability, types of cutting tools, materials, process capabilities etc. KATA's prototype is currently able to analyse a cylindrical shape workpiece and a simple <b>prismatic</b> <b>part.</b> Analyses of tolerance include dimensional tolerance and geometrical tolerance. KATA is also able to do angular cuts such as tapers and chamfers. The investigation has also led to the significant development of the single tolerance reference technique. This method departs from the common practice of multiple tolerance referencing technique to optimise tolerance allocation. Utilisation of this new technique has eradicated the error of tolerance stackup. The retests have been undertaken, two of which are cylindrical parts meant to test dimensional tolerance and an angular cut. The third is a simple <b>prismatic</b> <b>part</b> to experiment with the geometrical tolerance analysis. The ability to optimise tolerance allocation is based on real production data and not imaginary or random number generation and has improved the accuracy of the expected result after manufacturing. Any failure caused by machining parameters is cautioned at an early stage before an actual production run has commenced. Thus, the manufacturer is assured that the product manufactured will be within the required tolerance limits. Being the central database for all production capability information enables KATA to opt for several approaches and techniques of processing. Hence, giving the user flexibility of selecting the process plan best suited for any required situation...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: CAD/CAM {{systems and}} CNC {{machines}} are now commonly utilized {{in the manufacturing}} industry. The integration level between these two technologies is one key element which directly impacts the productivity of NC programming and that of machining operations. With advanced integration between these technologies, significant benefits can be expected for the relevant industries. This paper proposes an approach for integrating advanced machine-tool canned cycles into CAD/CAM software. The integration associates the machining features of a CAD model with the corresponding cycles of machine-tools for which tool paths are directly processed into their respective controllers. An application prototype has been developed using PRO/Engineer which proposes an upgraded interface with new machining strategies based on available cycles related to specific machines. The machining parameters and the feature itself only need to be identified to generate the appropriate G-code through an adapted post-processor. The machining of <b>prismatic</b> <b>parts</b> is performed in order to validate the approach and to perform {{an evaluation of the}} integrated approach in comparison with a traditional NC programming approach using a CAD/CAM software application. The tests performed are based on circular pocket roughing and finishing, profiling of islands and surfacing.
