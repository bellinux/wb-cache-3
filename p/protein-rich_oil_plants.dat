50|$|The Gulf of Georgia Cannery {{remained}} quiet {{during the}} 1930s, {{but with the}} outbreak of the Second World War in Europe, the Cannery was revitalized by an onslaught of new capital and expansion in anticipation of a new enterprise, namely herring. New machinery and an army of workers produced case after case of canned herring in tomato sauce, the major source of protein for Allied soldiers and civilians struggling overseas during the war. Herring canning became an industry-wide endeavour and alongside it grew the business of herring reduction, that is, the transformation of herring into <b>protein-rich</b> <b>oil</b> and meal for animal feeding purposes.|$|R

However, the full medicinal potential of many seed <b>oil</b> <b>plants</b> {{is yet to be}} properly reviewed, particularly for their antimicrobial and antioxidant properties. North-East India has rich resources of seed <b>oil</b> <b>plants.</b> The availability of detailed information on these plants is quite limited. This review aims to explore and evaluate these seed <b>oil</b> <b>plants</b> of the North-East India with particular emphasis on their antimicrobial and antioxidant activities as well as chemical compositions. A comprehensive literature search on seed <b>oil</b> <b>plants</b> of this region has been performed. Seed <b>oil</b> yielding <b>plants</b> of this region can be categorized into two categories: plants that are used traditionally as sources of edible or medicinal <b>oils</b> and <b>plants</b> that are used for purposes other than as sources of oils. Many seed <b>oil</b> <b>plants</b> of this region have been reported to possess antimicrobial and antioxidant properties, and to produce various types of compounds. This review also highlights the importance of these plants in contributing to the local as well as the national economy of India...|$|R
