25|$|An {{example of}} {{negative}} capability {{can be seen}} at work in industrial innovation. In order to create an innovator's advantage and develop new forms of economic enterprise, the modern industrialist could not just become more efficient with surplus extraction based on pre-existing work roles, but rather needed to invent new styles of flexible labor, expertise, and capital management. The industrialist needed to bring people together in new and innovative ways and redefine work roles and workplace organization. The modern factory had to at once stabilize its <b>productive</b> <b>environment</b> by inventing new restraints upon labor, such as length of the work day and division of tasks, {{but at the same time}} could not be too severe or risk being at a disadvantage to competitors, e.g. not being able to shift production tasks or capacity. Those industrialists and managers who were able to break old forms of organizational arrangements exercised negative capability.|$|E
25|$|In the Late Pleistocene, Beringia was {{a mosaic}} of {{biological}} communities. Commencing from BP (MIS 3), steppe–tundra vegetation dominated large parts of Beringia with a rich diversity of grasses and herbs. There were patches of shrub tundra with isolated refugia of larch (Larix) and spruce (Picea) forests with birch (Betula) and alder (Alnus) trees. It has been proposed that {{the largest and most}} diverse megafaunal community residing in Beringia at this time could only have been sustained in a highly diverse and <b>productive</b> <b>environment.</b> Analysis at Chukotka on the Siberian edge of the land bridge indicated that from BP (MIS 3 to MIS 2) the environment was wetter and colder than the steppe–tundra to the east and west, with warming in parts of Beringia from BP. These changes provided the most likely explanation for mammal migrations after BP, as the warming provided increased forage for browsers and mixed feeders. Beringia did not block the movement of most dry steppe-adapted large species such as saiga antelope, woolly mammoth, and caballid horses. However, from the west the woolly rhino went no further east than the Anadyr River, and from the east North American camels, the American kiang-like equids, the short-faced bear, bonnet-horned muskoxen, and badger did not travel west. At the beginning of the Holocene, some mesic habitat-adapted species left the refugium and spread westward into what had become tundra-vegetated northern Asia and eastward into northern North America.|$|E

Such fields were used widely in regional agriculture, together with irrigated fields, pasture, terraced fields and artificial ponds. Water from Katari and Tiwanku rivers was used to water raised fields, that covered up to 130 square km.|$|E

2500|$|What {{is today}} called Olmec first {{appeared}} fully {{within the city}} of San Lorenzo Tenochtitlán, where distinctive Olmec features occurred around 1400BCE. The rise of civilization was assisted by the local ecology of well-watered alluvial soil, {{as well as by}} the transportation network provided by the Coatzacoalcos River basin. This environment may be compared to that of other ancient centers of civilization: the Nile, Indus, and Yellow River valleys, and Mesopotamia. This highly <b>productive</b> <b>environment</b> encouraged a densely concentrated population, which in turn triggered the rise of an elite class. [...] The elite class created the demand for the production of the symbolic and sophisticated luxury artifacts that define Olmec culture. Many of these luxury artifacts were made from materials such as jade, obsidian, and magnetite, which came from distant locations and suggest that early Olmec elites had access to an extensive trading network in Mesoamerica. The source of the most valued jade Motagua River valley in eastern Guatemala, and Olmec obsidian has been traced to sources in the Guatemala highlands, such as El Chayal and San Martín Jilotepeque, or in Puebla, distances ranging from 200 to 400km (120–250 miles) away, respectively.|$|E

40|$|Cooperative breeding, {{in which}} more than a pair of conspecifics {{cooperate}} to raise young at a single nest or brood, is widespread among vertebrates but highly variable in its geographic distribution. Particularly vexing has been identifying the ecological correlates of this phenomenon, which has been suggested to be favored in populations inhabiting both relatively stable, <b>productive</b> <b>environments</b> and in populations living under highly variable and unpredictable conditions. Griesser et al. provide a novel approach to this problem, performing a phylogenetic analysis indicating that family living is an intermediate step between nonsocial and cooperative breeding birds. They then examine the ecological and climatic conditions associated with these different social systems, concluding that cooperative breeding emerges when family living is favored in highly <b>productive</b> <b>environments,</b> followed secondarily by selection for cooperative breeding when environmental conditions deteriorate and within-year variability increases. Combined with recent work addressing the fitness consequences of cooperative breeding, Griesser et al. 's contribution stands to move the field forward by demonstrating that the evolution of complex adaptations such as cooperative breeding may only be understood when each of the steps leading to it are identified and carefully integrated...|$|R

Predicting the {{economic}} value of ontologies {{is important for}} their use in <b>productive</b> <b>environments.</b> The measurement of {{the economic}} value of information systems usually consists of an assessment of its costs and benefits. While methods for cost estimation for ontology engineering have already been proposed, no method to quantify {{the benefits of the}} use of ontologies exists. We thus propose a method for benefit estimation that can be applied to ontologies based on a multiple gap model for user information satisfaction analysis. Together with cost estimation methods this model can be used to predict the economic value of ontologies. ...|$|R

40|$|Intraguild predators both feed on {{and compete}} with their intraguild prey. In theory, intraguild predators can {{therefore}} be very effective as biological control agents of intraguild prey species, especially in <b>productive</b> <b>environments.</b> We investigated this hypothesis using the mixotrophic chrysophyte Ochromonas as intraguild predator and the harmful cyanobacterium Microcystis aeruginosa as its prey. Ochromonas can grow photoautotrophically, but can also graze efficiently on Microcystis. Hence, it competes with its prey for inorganic resources. We developed a mathematical model and parameterized it for our experimental food web. The model predicts dominance of Microcystis at low nutrient loads, coexistence of both species at intermediate nutrient loads, and dominance of Ochromonas but a strong decrease of Microcystis at high nutrient loads. We tested these theoretical predictions in chemostat experiments supplied with three different nitrogen concentrations. Ochromonas initially suppressed the Microcystis abundance by > 97 % compared to the Microcystis monocultures. Thereafter, however, Microcystis gradually recovered to ∼ 20 % of its monoculture abundance at low nitrogen loads, but to 50 – 60 % at high nitrogen loads. Hence, Ochromonas largely lost control over the Microcystis population at high nitrogen loads. We explored several mechanisms that might explain this deviation from theoretical predictions, and found that intraspecific interference at high Ochromonas densities reduced their grazing rates on Microcystis. These results illustrate the potential of intraguild predation to control pest species, but also show that {{the effectiveness of their}} biological control can be reduced in <b>productive</b> <b>environments.</b> Read More: [URL]...|$|R
