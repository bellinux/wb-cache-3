Nonylphenol {{is not a}} single chemical compound; instead, the term refers to compounds of those that have a central aromatic (or benzene) ring and a nine carbon side chain. The most commonly occurring compound of nonylphenol is 4 -nonylphenol, in which the side chains are attached directly to the carbon opposite of the hydroxyl group (OH; oxygen and a hydrogen atom) and this compound makes up over 90 % of commercial nonylphenol. NPs are widely used as detergents, emulsifiers, and surfactants (wetting agents) in household and industrial products such as paints, <b>plastics,</b> cosmetics, <b>lubricant</b> oils, construction materials, vulcanized rubber, and paper. They are also used in the processing of fuels, metals, petroleum, textiles, agricultural chemicals, and leather.

40|$|The {{molecular}} adsorber coating is a {{new technology}} that was developed to mitigate the risk of on-orbit molecular contamination on spaceflight missions. The application of this coating would be ideal near highly sensitive, interior surfaces and instruments that are negatively impacted by outgassed molecules from materials, such as <b>plastics,</b> adhesives, <b>lubricants,</b> epoxies, and other similar compounds. This current, sprayable paint technology is comprised of inorganic white materials made from highly porous zeolite. In addition to good adhesion performance, thermal stability, and adsorptive capability, the molecular adsorber coating offers favorable thermal control characteristics. However, low reflectivity properties, which are typically offered by black thermal control coatings, are desired for some spaceflight applications. For example, black coatings are used on interior surfaces, in particular, on instrument baffles for optical stray light control. Similarly, they are also used within light paths between optical systems, such as telescopes, to absorb light. Recent efforts {{have been made to}} transform the white molecular adsorber coating into a black coating with similar adsorptive properties. This result is achieved by optimizing the current formulation with black pigments, while still maintaining its adsorption capability for outgassing control. Different binder to pigment ratios, coating thicknesses, and spray application techniques were explored to develop a black version of the molecular adsorber coating. During the development process, coating performance and adsorption characteristics were studied. The preliminary work performed on black molecular adsorber coatings thus far is very promising.

30|$|Friction between metal {{tools and}} wood under high {{pressure}} (≥ 1  MPa) necessarily arises during wood deformation processes {{and is thus}} an important factor {{to be taken into}} account when wood is processed. We focus on the friction characteristics between a metal tool and wood impregnated with phenol formaldehyde (PF) resin, which is widely used to improve the dimensional stability of wood products. To clarify the effects of the metal tool surface temperature, the PF resin concentration of impregnated solution and the lubricants under exposure to high pressure on the friction characteristics, the friction coefficient (μ) was measured while the wood was compressed in the tangential direction at high pressure (6.7  MPa). The results of µ for higher PF resin concentration differed significantly with the temperature of the metal tool surface. When the impregnated specimens slide under softening temperature (≤ 140  °C), the PF resin squeezing out from the specimen contributed to a decrease of μ because it acts as a lubricant. However, when the impregnated specimens were cured (160  °C), μ increased due to an increase of the sliding resistance on the contact surface. μ was decreased to 0.02 when using a release agent for commodity <b>plastics</b> as a <b>lubricant.</b>|$|R

40|$|With a {{focus on}} issues and {{opportunities}} for the forest industry and {{in the context of}} policy development, this study aims to examine the future of bioenergy in Australia US policy and developments are also considered given current alignment with US policy (eg Kyoto). Bioenergy is energy derived from non-fossil organic matter and includes a diverse range of processes and products. This thesis begins with a strategic look at world trends, fossil fuel supplies, the electricity industry and competition from other renewable energy sources, and moves to a detailed look at biomass feedstocks and bioenergy technologies. It concludes with energy policy developments both in Australia and the US, along with environmental, community support and green power marketing issues relevant to the development of bioenergy in Australia. Concerns over greenhouse gases and sustainable development are driving a world-wide trend towards renewables, with concerns over air pollution and energy security also playing a role. Energy use contributes to 80 % of total green house gas emissions in Australia A commitment to the Kyoto Protocol by the Australian government would assist policy development in support of renewable energies. Bioenergy offers a greenhouse friendly alternative, with some of the practical advantages of fossil fuels. Use of renewable sources of energy in Australia presently represents 6 % of total energy consumption, of which bioenergy makes up over 75 % (though in renewable electricity generation, hydro-electricity is by far the dominant source). The price of fossil fuels affects the competitiveness of bioenergy, making the future supply of crude oil relevant. Like most countries Australia is a net importer of crude, with imports to double by 2015. Biofuels (particularly ethanol) and biochemicals are being strongly promoted in the US and interest is growing in Australia. Biomass derived chemicals could substitute for crude oil in the manufacture of <b>plastics,</b> <b>lubricants,</b> composites and paints. Bioenergy must compete with a range of renewable technologies in addition to fossil fuels. Bioenergy compares well against other renewables though it has the disadvantage that it is neither well recognised or understood, and the community is not convinced that bioenergy is renewable. However bioenergy has the following advantages: it is the only alternative for production of liquid fuels, it is suitable for base load electricity; and it is the most flexible renewable energy source {{with a wide range of}} energy products. Feedstock cost is the main factor affecting the economic viability of bioenergy applications, often more important than differences in technology/application Waste biomass provides the cheapest source. Bioenergy plantations are struggling to compete with other sources on cost. The most common operational problem for bioenergy plants is the handling and transportation of feedstock within the mill (conveyor systems). Flexibility is an important design criterion for these systems, which must be robust and well designed. Policies such as PURPA and production tax credits have made significant contributions to expansion of renewables in the US Of developments in policy in Australia, the most important is the Renewable Energy (Electricity) Act 2000 The Australian federal government has also introduced a Biofuels initiative -however details of implementation await completion of a Biofuels Feasibility Study State governments across Australia have a diverse range of initiatives and funding programs as well. Prime environmental issues with bioenergy relate to resource use and air pollution. Resource use concerns relate primarily to intensification of forest harvesting. NSW is in the process of banning the use of any timber from native forests for biomass generation (except sawmill wastes). 'Green power' schemes reflect the pulse of community attitudes to renewable energy options. To succeed bloenergy must be more than greenhouse friendly, it must be demonstrably renewable with a net environmental benefit. Bioenergy can meet these needs, but community support is critical. In developing bioenergy proposals: Make sure proposals are well thought out and sensitively sited Consult communities early in development, with openess and honesty and a strong ongoing commitment to follow it through. Credibility and trust are crucial. Market the benefits of bioenergy accurately and thoughtfully and try to add broader environmental appeal - to improve prospects for success and to add marketable appeal for electricity retailers or Greenpower eligibility. Bioenergy is most viable when certain conditions are met These are: a) Access to 'cheap' feedstocks. b) Ready access to the market for the energy product(s) free of major costs/obstacles. c) Unsubsidised fossil fuel or electricity prices. d) Access to Renewable Energy Premiums. e) Community Support. Not all of these conditions must be met for bioenergy to be viable, but at least items b, e and either a, c or d are typically required. These conditions exist in Australia. The prime bioenergy options for the forest industry include: Co-firing - blending of wood wastes and chips in coal fired power stations; Utilisation of off-season generating capacity in sugar refineries using forest residues. Co-generation in wood processing facilities for power and process heat. Production of pellet fuels from mill wastes for direct combustion in homes for heat Production of ethanol using both forest and agricultural residues in an enzymatic hydrolysis process when commercially viable (earliest 2004 - 2007).

50|$|At {{the onset}} of World War II in 1939, the bureau was {{proposed}} to be abolished. Arguably, Arcot Ramaswamy Mudaliar became the most instrumental {{in the creation of}} CSIR in India. As a member of Viceroy’s executive council, and also of Commerce, he recommended that the Bureau should be terminated, not as a measure of economy, but to make room for a Board of Scientific and Industrial Research, which should be endowed with greater resources and wider objectives. It was by this persistence that the Board of Scientific and Industrial Research (BSIR) was created on 1 April 1940 for a period of two years. Mudaliar became the chair of the board. It was at this point that Bhatnagar was appointed to pilot the board, as the Director. The BSIR was allocated an annual budget of INR 500,000 under the Department of Commerce. By the end of 1940, about 80 researchers were engaged, of whom one-quarter was directly employed. Major achievements of BSIR included development of the techniques for the purification of Baluchistan sulphur anti-gas cloth manufacture, vegetable oil blends as fuel and <b>lubricants,</b> <b>plastic</b> packing cases for army boots and ammunition, dyes for uniforms and the preparation of vitamins, and the invention of a pyrethrum emulsifier and cream. In early 1941 Bhatnagar persuaded the government to set up an Industrial Research Utilisation Committee (IRUC) for translating results into application. The government then agreed to make a separate fund out of the royalties received from industry for further investment into industrial research. Mudaliar recommended that an Industrial Research Fund should be constituted, which would have an annual grant of INR 1,000,000 (one million) for a period of five years. This was accepted by the Central Assembly in Delhi at its session on 14 November 1941.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} and development program was designed to improve nondestructive evaluation of large mechanical objects by providing both fast and thermal neutron sources for radiography. Neutron radiography permits inspection inside objects that x-rays cannot penetrate and permits imaging of corrosion and cracks in low-density materials. Discovering of fatigue cracks and corrosion in piping without the necessity of insulation removal is possible. Neutron radiography sources can provide for the nondestructive testing interests of commercial and military aircraft, public utilities and petrochemical organizations. Three neutron prototype neutron generators were designed and fabricated based on original research done at the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (LBNL). The {{research and}} development of these generators was successfully continued by LBNL and Adelphi Technology Inc. under this STTR. The original design goals of high neutron yield and generator robustness have been achieved, using new technology developed under this grant. In one prototype generator, the fast neutron yield and brightness was roughly 10 times larger than previously marketed neutron generators using the same deuterium-deuterium reaction. In another generator, we integrate a moderator with a fast neutron source, resulting in a high brightness thermal neutron generator. The moderator acts as both conventional moderator and mechanical and electrical support structure for the generator and effectively mimics a nuclear reactor. In addition to the new prototype generators, an entirely new plasma ion source for neutron production was developed. First developed by LBNL, this source uses a spiral antenna to more efficiently couple the RF radiation into the plasma, reducing the required gas pressure so that the generator head can be completely sealed, permitting the possible use of tritium gas. This also permits the generator to use the deuterium-tritium reaction to produce 14 -MeV neutrons with increases of yield of two orders of magnitude. The first fast neutron radiographic images were obtained using neutron cameras and a new fast neutron generator. These early images demonstrated the feasibility of using fast neutrons for imaging and penetrating thick objects of high density and imaging. Fast neutrons can be used to image low atomic number materials (e. g. <b>plastics,</b> explosives, <b>lubricants</b> and ceramics) that are shielded by high density materials (e. g. lead, tungsten and uranium). Fast neutron radiography {{could be used as a}} means to screen weapons for flaws and chemical stability. X-ray radiography can not easily do this. Fast neutron imaging is technically difficult and, consequently, a completely undeveloped market. Two of the generators were designed to have small source size and high brightness, ideal for fast-neutron imaging. With these generators we successfully used two fast neutron cameras: one developed by us, and another developed by a collaborator, Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organization, CSIRO. We have successfully used these cameras to obtain low resolution images of various objects such as pipe fittings filled with water and other mechanical objects. Higher resolution and contrast images are expected by decreasing the source size and increasing generator yield...|$|R
40|$|Lower olefins (ethylene, {{propylene}} and butylenes) {{are important}} commodity chemicals {{used for the}} manufacture of, amongst others, <b>plastics,</b> solvents and <b>lubricants</b> to cosmetics and drugs. C 2 to C 4 olefins are conventionally produced by steam cracking of naphtha. In view of economic, strategic, and environmental reasons {{there is a growing}} necessity to produce these key chemical building blocks from non-oil derived sources. Many processes have been devised to obtain lower olefins from synthesis gas, a mixture of CO and H 2 that can be obtained from different carbon-containing feedstocks. Methanol-to-olefins (MTO) and Dimethyl ether-to-olefins (DMTO) are syngas-based processes that involve the synthesis of an intermediate. A direct route for the conversion of syngas into lower olefins is the so-called Fischer-Tropsch-to olefins (FTO) process. Promoted iron catalysts are the choice for FTO as they show low methane selectivity at the high reaction temperatures necessary to drive product distribution to shorter hydrocarbon chains and exhibit high olefin selectivity. The use of iron-based catalysts is advantageous for the conversion of CO-rich syngas such as the gas obtained from gasification of coal or biomass. The use of Fe-based catalysts eliminates the need of an upstream water gas shift process to adjust the H 2 /CO ratio. Iron is more resistant to poisoning by contaminants present in coal or biomass-based syngas in comparison to catalysts used for the conversion of syngas into methanol or DME. To achieve active and selective catalysts for the FTO reaction it is necessary to add small amounts of other elements to modify the properties of iron (carbide). In general, promoters are added to reduce methane selectivity and to increase the selectivity towards C 2 -C 4 olefins. The complexity of promoted bulk iron catalysts is not only related to the different iron phases present in the working catalysts but also to the presence of modifying elements and their intricate interactions with the active phase. Iron catalysts experience physical changes during reaction. Large iron oxide crystals transform into iron carbide when they are put in contact with syngas. Internal forces originated by density differences of the iron phases and by nucleation of carbon filaments result in fragmentation of iron-containing particles. This might lead to problems during operation such as fouling of separation equipment or plugging of the catalyst bed. The stability of iron-based catalysts can be improved by dispersing iron nanoparticles on a support or carrier material. The complexity of iron catalysts increases further when introducing a support material {{as a result of the}} interactions between the active phase and the carrier. Additionally, structure sensitivity starts to play a role when iron (carbide) particle size is decreased from micrometers to the nanometer range and the spatial distribution of the particles on the support might influence catalytic properties. Other factors that determine the performance of FTO catalysts are reaction conditions and pretreatment processes. The present work is mainly focused on the study of the properties of iron-based catalysts that have an influence on activity, selectivity and stability during the conversion of synthesis gas into lower olefins...|$|R
