For methane we find residual contamination of the purified gas at concentrations varying over three orders of magnitude, depending on the purifier temperature and the gas flow rate. A slight reduction in the purifier's methane efficiency is observed after 13 mg of this impurity has been absorbed, which we attribute to partial exhaustion of the purifier's capacity for this species. We also find that the purifier's ability to absorb N 2 and methane can be extinguished long before any decrease in O 2 performance is observed, and slower flow rates should be employed for xenon purification due to the cooling effect that the heavy gas has on the getter.

40|$|Finding a {{suitable}} DNA purification system {{is vital for}} the success of many PCR based diagnostic tests. This report demonstrates the value of magnetic beads in combination with real-time PCR for the sequence-specific isolation and detection of episomal HPV 16 DNA. In order to maximize the isolation, two purification procedures were evaluated. Compared to the indirect method, in which the target was magnetically labeled after being hybridized to the capture probes, much higher efficiencies were obtained by directly capturing the target using DNA functionalized beads. These higher efficiencies were obtained by carefully tuning the capture probe density on the beads. When modifying the beads with dual-biotinylated capture probes or introducing beads modified with different capture probes, the amount of HPV 16 isolated from spiked clinical swab samples even increased further. This not only resulted in the use of dual-biotinylated capture probes in higher <b>purification</b> <b>efficiencies,</b> but also the thermostability of the DNA-bead linkage was found to improve.

The <b>purification</b> <b>efficiencies</b> of VP 3 protein (TVP 3 and Delta TVP 3) using Ni 2 +-NTA commercial agarose gels and Ni 2 +-IDA regenerated cellulose-based membranes at 4 degrees C were compared. A good washing condition for removing most impurity proteins was found as 20 mM NaH 2 PO 4, 500 mM NaCl, 40 mM imidazole, pH 7. 8, whereas an efficient elution condition was 20 mM NaH 2 PO 4, 500 mM NaCl, 500 or 750 mM[imidazole, pH 7. 8. By applying these conditions to the flow experiments, similar recovery (86 - 88 %) and purity (98 - 99 %) for VP 3 were obtained in both gel column (1 ml gel) and membrane cartridge (four membrane disks) under the flow rate of 1. 7 ml/min for protein loading and 2. 7 ml/min for protein elution.

50|$|Sublimation is a {{technique}} used by chemists to purify compounds. A solid is typically placed in a sublimation apparatus and heated under vacuum. Under this reduced pressure, the solid volatilizes and condenses as a purified compound on a cooled surface (cold finger), leaving a non-volatile residue of impurities behind. Once heating ceases and the vacuum is removed, the purified compound may be collected from the cooling surface.For even higher <b>purification</b> <b>efficiencies</b> a temperature gradient is applied, which also allows for the separation of different fractions. Typical setups use an evacuated glass tube that is gradually heated in a controlled manner. The material flow is from the hot end, where the initial material is placed, to the cold end that is connected to a pump stand. By controlling temperatures {{along the length of}} the tube the operator can control the zones of recondensation, with very volatile compounds being pumped out of the system completely (or caught by a separate cold trap), moderately volatile compounds recondensating along the tube according to their different volatilities, and non-volatile compounds remaining in the hot end.Vacuum sublimation of this type is also the method of choice for purification of organic compounds for the use in the organic electronics industry, where very high purities (often > 99.99%) are needed to satisfy the standards for consumer electronics and other applications.|$|R

The considered wastewaters were produced from textile industries, dairy farming, landfill leachate, and composting. Aerobic biodegradation was studied by respirometric tests, being the respirometry a widely used technique for the characterisation of wastewater and activated sludge [1]. Respirometry is the measurement and interpretation of the biological oxygen consumption rate under well-defined experimental conditions. Because respiration rate is directly linked to substrate removal and biomass growth, respirometry is an effective tool in the control of the activated sludge process [2]. Respirometric test were carried out continuously measuring the dissolved oxygen concentration and pH and ORP values inside the reactor. Measured data were recorded by a data acquisition unit. A mathematical model based on the Activated Sludge Model No. 1 [3] was developed and calibrated using the experimental results from the lab-scale plant. Non linear differential equations of the model were implemented in a self-made software in order to obtain the biomass kinetic parameters and the COD fractionation in classes of biodegradability. The respirometric technique applied was helpful for the description of the microbial activity of the considered (heterogeneous complex) wastewaters/WWTP activated sludge systems.

The process is unique in its mixed sludge bed approach allowing for tolerance of swings in Ph (6 - 8) at relatively low temperatures (32 C - 38 C) which can be readily achieved from most wastewater streams with little expenditure of additional energy. Sludge production is remarkably low, only about 5 % of the COD loading, greatly alleviating disposal problems.

Interpretation of this complex data to gather useful information requires sophisticated data processing techniques.

The trade-off between accuracy and precision of different estimation methods is discussed to guide {{the selection of the}} developed estimation methods. Secondly, a newly developed single particle tracking package allows users to automatically process large amounts of raw single particle data to produce single-molecule tracking results.

40|$|Abstract—Carbon {{nanotubes}} (CNTs) possess unique structural, mechanical, thermal {{and electronic}} properties, {{and have been}} proposed {{to be used for}} applications in many fields. However, to reach the full potential of the CNTs, many problems still need to be solved, including the development of an easy and effective purification procedure, since synthesized CNTs contain impurities, such as amorphous carbon, carbon nanoparticles and metal particles. Different purification methods yield different CNT characteristics and may be suitable for the production of different types of CNTs. In this study, the effect of different purification chemicals on carbon nanotube quality was investigated. CNTs were firstly synthesized by chemical vapor deposition (CVD) of acetylene (C 2 H 2) on a magnesium oxide (MgO) powder impregnated with an iron nitrate (Fe(NO 3) 3 · 9 H 2 O) solution. The synthesis parameters were selected as: the synthesis temperature of 800 °C, the iron content in the precursor of 5 % and the synthesis time of 30 min. The liquid phase oxidation method was applied for the purification of the synthesized CNT materials. Three different acid chemicals (HNO 3, H 2 SO 4, and HCl) were used in the removal of the metal catalysts from the synthesized CNT material to investigate the possible effects of each acid solution to the purification step. Purification experiments were carried out at two different temperatures (75 and 120 °C), two different acid concentrations (3 and 6 M) and for three different time intervals (6, 8 and 15 h). A 30 % H 2 O 2 : 3 M HCl (1 : 1 v%) solution was also used in the purification step to remove both the metal catalysts and the amorphous carbon.

40|$|Abstract. The <b>purification</b> <b>efficiency</b> of {{biological}} removal {{of iron and}} manganese was probed by pilot tests. In this experiment, the raw water were iron concentration of 0. 96 ~ 5. 56 mg/L, manganese concentration of 0. 87 ~ 2. 38 mg/L, dissolved oxygen of 2 ~ 4 mg/L, pH value neutral. In the condition of filter speed of 6 m/h, the average removal rate of iron and manganese reached 97. 6 % and 90. 9 % respectively, the effluent concentration of F...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} {{indicated that}} treatment with pulsed corona discharges {{in the presence}} of bubbles can be a useful technique for removal of hazardous organic substances in water by advanced oxidation. Nearly 15 % higher reduction in contaminant concentration was obtained with all the three contaminants tested, trichloroethylene, benzene and toluene, using pulsed corona discharge for the same duration of treatment compared to air stripping alone. The field intensity and the residence time of the bubble near the active test electrode were the most effective parameters in effective <b>purification.</b> The removal <b>efficiency</b> was independent of the pulse frequency.

40|$|Graphite {{modified}} with {{gallic acid}} to form 'gallic acid-carbon' is demonstrated to be efficient {{for the removal}} of bismuth(III) ions from aqueous solutions. The uptake is demonstrated to be rapid but not to follow standard adsorption isotherm models. Instead, the uptake was found to be further promoted by the presence of the adsorbed metal. Additionally, the bismuth uptake showed linear dependence on the square of its concentration suggesting the possible formation of polymeric bismuth species. The gallic acid-carbon shows great promise as a relatively inexpensive material for solid-phase extraction and water <b>purification</b> with extraction <b>efficiency</b> close to 98 %...|$|R
30|$|The hydrolytic {{performance}} of a novel Clostridium thermocellum cellulolytic recombinant cellulase expressed in Escherichia coli cells was compared with the naturally isolated cellulases in different modes of fermentation trials using steam explosion pretreated thatch grass and Zymomonas mobilis. Fourier transform infrared (FT-IR) spectroscopic analysis confirmed the efficiency of steam explosion pretreatment in significant release of free glucose moiety from complex lignocellulosic thatch grass. The recombinant GH 5 cellulase with 1 % (w v- 1) substrate and Z. mobilis in shake flask separate hydrolysis and fermentation (SHF) and simultaneous saccharification and fermentation (SSF) trials demonstrated highest ethanol titre (0.99 g L- 1, 1.2 g L- 1) as compared to Bacillus subtilis (0.51 g L- 1, 0.72 g L- 1) and Trichoderma reesei (0.67 g L- 1, 0.94 g L- 1). A 5 % (w v- 1) substrate with recombinant enzyme in shake flask SSF resulted in a 7 fold increment of ethanol titre (8.8 g L- 1). The subsequent scale up in a 2 L bioreactor with 1 L working volume yielded 16.13 g L- 1 ethanol titre implying a 2 fold upturn. The rotary evaporator based product recovery from bioreactor contributed 94.4 (%, v v- 1) pure ethanol with <b>purification</b> process <b>efficiency</b> of 22.2 %.|$|R
