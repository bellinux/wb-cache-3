5|$|Interactionist dualism, {{or simply}} interactionism, is the {{particular}} form of dualism first espoused by Descartes in the Meditations. In the 20th century, its major defenders have been Karl <b>Popper</b> and John Carew Eccles. It is the view that mental states, such as beliefs and desires, causally interact with physical states.|$|E

In a series of papers in the 1970s, Miller and others uncovered defects in <b>Popper's</b> formal definition of verisimilitude, previously a mostly ignored aspect of <b>Popper's</b> theory.

5|$|Being a scientist, {{above all}} else, Huxley {{presented}} agnosticism {{as a form}} of demarcation. A hypothesis with no supporting objective, testable evidence is not an objective, scientific claim. As such, there would be no way to test said hypotheses, leaving the results inconclusive. His agnosticism was not compatible with forming a belief as to the truth, or falsehood, of the claim at hand. Karl <b>Popper</b> would also describe himself as an agnostic. According to philosopher William L. Rowe, in this strict sense, agnosticism is the view that human reason is incapable of providing sufficient rational grounds to justify either the belief that God exists or the belief that God does not exist.|$|E
5|$|Compton {{was one of}} {{a handful}} of {{scientists}} and philosophers to propose a two-stage model of free will. Others include William James, Henri Poincaré, Karl <b>Popper,</b> Henry Margenau, and Daniel Dennett. In 1931, Compton championed the idea of human freedom based on quantum indeterminacy, and invented the notion of amplification of microscopic quantum events to bring chance into the macroscopic world. In his somewhat bizarre mechanism, he imagined sticks of dynamite attached to his amplifier, anticipating the Schrödinger's cat paradox, which was published in 1935.|$|E
5|$|<b>Popper</b> {{eventually}} relented, after {{admitting that}} the larger dreadnought type design would also warrant {{the construction of a}} new floating dry dock, which would significantly increase the cost of the project. The design board selected the fifth design, though during refinement of the design, the secondary guns were increased in caliber from 19cm to 24cm. The 30.5cm gun was chosen because the breech of the new 28cm was unreliable. The resulting design was the last pre-dreadnought type of battleship built by the Austro-Hungarian navy.|$|E

5|$|Thomas Henry Huxley defends in {{an essay}} titled On the Hypothesis that Animals are Automata, and its History an epiphenomenalist theory of {{consciousness}} according to which consciousness is a causally inert effect of neural activity — “as the steam-whistle which accompanies {{the work of a}} locomotive engine is without influence upon its machinery”. To this William James objects in his essay Are We Automata? by stating an evolutionary argument for mind-brain interaction implying that if the preservation and development of consciousness in the biological evolution is a result of natural selection, it is plausible that consciousness has not only been influenced by neural processes, but has had a survival value itself; and it could only have had this if it had been efficacious. Karl <b>Popper</b> develops in the book The Self and Its Brain a similar evolutionary argument.|$|E
5|$|Werner Erhard: The Transformation of a Man, The Founding of est is a {{biography}} of Werner Erhard by philosophy professor William Warren Bartley, III. The book was published in 1978 by Clarkson Potter. Bartley was professor of philosophy at California State University and had studied with philosopher Karl <b>Popper.</b> He {{was the author of}} several books on philosophy, including {{a biography}} about Ludwig Wittgenstein. Prior to writing the book, Bartley was a friend of Erhard's and was involved in his company Erhard Seminars Training (est). While writing the book, Bartley was paid US$30,000 in the role of philosophical consultant for est. Erhard wrote a foreword to the book. The book's structure describes Erhard's education, transformation, reconnection with his family, and the theories of the est training.|$|E
40|$|The {{main goal}} of this thesis is to answer {{following}} question: Does <b>Popper's</b> critique of Plato stand up against other interpretations? This question is answered by author that he clarifies <b>Popper's</b> assumptions, and then he compares it with Plato's primary texts {{as well as with}} secondary sources of other interpreters (Gadamer, Reale, Graeser, Patočka, and Strauss). To answer the main question the author proceeds with this method: In the first chapter he focuses on the context of <b>Popper's</b> evaluation of Plato and clarifies the difference between terms of the open and closed society. He uses moments of <b>Popper's</b> life too. In the second chapter author clarifies Plato's political philosophy on the basis of analysis Leges a Respublica, which are texts that formulates the main ideas of Plato's philosophy and are the main source of <b>Popper's</b> criticism. In the third chapter author presents an explanation of <b>Popper's</b> criticism from the first volume of Open society and its enemies, while he mostly focuses on <b>Popper's</b> formulation of "law of revolution", which is based on assumption of validity of historicism in Plato's explanation of society development and an accusation of Plato's racism.

40|$|References to <b>Popper’s</b> {{concept of}} three worlds occupy a central {{position}} in ontological and human ecological {{questions in the}} recent literature on theoretical geography. This article demonstrates that <b>Popper’s</b> ideas and concepts have not been fully understood, causing problems for integrative research. Firstly, we critically review the discussion of <b>Popper’s</b> concept of three worlds in geography. We criticize its popular ontological interpretation, and furthermore we point out that <b>Popper’s</b> evolutionary basis has been consistently neglected. Subsequently we present an interpretation of <b>Popper’s</b> concept of three worlds which seems most plausible. We thereby identify his intentions and emphasize the evolutionary foundation of our interpretation of his theory. Finally, perspectives for human ecological research in geography {{on the basis of}} theories of evolution and emergence will be outlined...|$|R
