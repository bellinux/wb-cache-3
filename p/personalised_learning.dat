2500|$|The {{gradual release}} of {{responsibility}} model or GRR {{model is a}} particular style of teaching which is a structured method of pedagogy framed around a process devolving responsibility within the learning process from the teacher to the eventual independence of the learner. This instructional model requires that the teacher, by design, transitions from assuming [...] "all the responsibility for performing a task...to {{a situation in which}} the students assume all of the responsibility". The ideal result is a confident learner who accepts responsibility for their own learning and directs this learning through the cognitive processes involved, moving through the academic spectrum, to independent choice (<b>personalised</b> <b>learning).</b> As Buehl (2005) stated, the GRR model [...] "emphasizes instruction that mentors students into becoming capable thinkers and learners when handling the tasks with which they have not yet developed expertise".|$|E

40|$|The {{meaningful}} {{integration of}} technology {{in teaching and learning}} is consistently called for in all sectors of education. Recently it has appeared as a key tenet for achieving what has been termed as <b>personalising</b> <b>learning.</b> <b>Personalising</b> <b>learning,</b> a concept that addresses a range of current best-practice approaches with an added emphasis on ICT and the voice of individual learners, is becoming more prevalent in both general discussion, and in some countries, in policy regarding education. If its prevalence continues to grow, teacher educators need to consider how they too can incorporate <b>personalising</b> <b>learning</b> approaches in their courses to ensure graduate teachers are equipped with the necessary skills and knowledge to implement <b>personalising</b> <b>learning</b> approaches in their own classrooms. This paper considers the components of <b>personalising</b> <b>learning</b> and describes one approach to creating a technology-infused learning environment that has been trialled in the tertiary sector. The key focus of this trial was the effective integration of technology as an enabler of <b>personalising</b> <b>learning.</b> Findings indicate that meaningful student learning experiences can be achieved through a personalised approach which also supports the emerging tenets of effective, pedagogical use of ICT for learning. These findings led to a model of Technology for <b>Personalising</b> <b>Learning</b> (TPL) which is presented as a planning framework through which <b>personalising</b> <b>learning</b> with technology can be achieved in higher education...|$|R
40|$|<b>Personalising</b> <b>learning,</b> digital {{technologies}} and Learning Management Systems are ‘hot topics’ in education in 2013. Learning Management Systems, hereafter {{referred to as}} an LMS, can <b>personalise</b> <b>learning</b> by encouraging teaching approaches that hold the student at {{the centre of the}} learning process (Seiler, as cited in Interface Magazine, 2009). However, there is little accessible research about how the LMS has been utilised in schools (Watson & Watson, 2007), especially primary schools, with some educators questioning the role that the LMS has to play in today’s schools (Downes, 2005; McLoughlin & Lee, 2008). This descriptive multiple-case study set out to explore the role of an LMS in <b>personalising</b> <b>learning</b> for students from the perspective of three primary school teachers. The intention was to provide insight into the role an LMS could play in classrooms when <b>personalising</b> <b>learning.</b> However, it became more about exploring the components of <b>personalising</b> <b>learning</b> and how this transferred into the LMS. The research project involved gathering multiple sources of data from interviews, observations and documentary information from the LMS. The findings from this research suggest that an LMS {{has the potential to be}} a key part of a primary classroom environment which is built on the components of <b>personalising</b> <b>learning.</b> The degree to which <b>personalising</b> <b>learning</b> occurs is dependent on the teacher’s overriding pedagogy, knowledge and understanding of <b>personalising</b> <b>learning,</b> school constraints and the perceived capacity of students to be independent learners. For the teachers in this project, <b>personalising</b> <b>learning</b> involved: (a) learning built around assessment for learning pedagogy, (b) a highly-structured approach to learning and teaching that places the needs and interests of students at the centre of learning, (c) learners informed and empowered through student choice and student voice, (d) a core curriculum of literacy and maths and (e) KnowledgeNET (the LMS at the centre of this study) as a tool to support learning. The findings highlight the interconnected nature of <b>personalising</b> <b>learning</b> pedagogy, an LMS and classroom practice...|$|R

50|$|Following a {{challenge}} from the then Schools Minister David Miliband, the Trust {{began working with}} headteachers to define <b>personalising</b> <b>learning.</b> Professor David Hargreaves {{held a series of}} workshops with 200 headteachers and identified the nine gateways to <b>personalising</b> <b>learning.</b> A series of five conferences with ASCL (then SHA) followed to examine the gateways. After each conference, David Hargreaves produced a pamphlet with case studies from schools. By the time of the last conference in January 2006, the nine gateways had been clustered into four groups: deep learning, deep experience, deep support and deep leadership. The National Conference in 2006 focused on these four deeps and consequently a number of schools restructured their leadership teams on this basis.|$|R

Section 2 of this report outlines the background and aims of this research project. Section 3 traces the development of the model and the accompanying learning equation. The key concept encapsulated in this model is that of overlapping action spaces, school, teaching, personal and living spaces, in which learning occurs. These spaces are populated by the key educational stakeholders: learners, their teachers, their family and peers. In each of these spaces a range of digital technologies is available to support the learner. Section 4 is a validation of the model using evidence from field research...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{question}} of what might be a model of effective leadership for pedagogical change in early childhood education in Aotearoa/New Zealand. Drawing on a framework of gateways for <b>personalising</b> <b>learning</b> constructed by Hargreaves (2004 a) and Engestrom's (1999) Activity theory, a case study of a professional development programme is analysed. Entrypoints or gateways for teachers in three early childhood centres to the professional development programme are identified, as are gateways for sustained involvement and continued learning opportunities. The study uses unstructured interviews with a narrative inquiry approach to hear the teachers' stories and the findings of the study are presented in a narrative style in order to capture these voices. The major findings from the study indicate that professional development is a complex interweaving of voices and intentions. There are three key elements of the ongoing <b>personalising</b> <b>learning</b> as a result of involvement in the professional development programme: distributed leadership, teacher voice, and community. The context of early childhood provided unique definitions of the gateways and common elements were found in identifying the entrypoints and features of sustained involvement. The study implies that effective leadership is distributed across the community and the sustaining features of the professional development programme need to be elements of any provision of professional development intent on <b>personalising</b> <b>learning</b> for pedagogical change...|$|R
