Ethylene oligomerisation reactions were performed at 373 K and 1 bar, inside a quartz reactor of a specially designed operando experimental setup, which allowed examination of the catalysts by UV-vis-NIR diffuse reflectance spectroscopy, while the gas phase was continuously monitored by on-line mass spectroscopy and subsequently analysed by gas chromatography. With this combination of techniques, it was possible to acquire detailed insight into the different distributions of produced oligomers, which were highly dependent on the catalyst structure. The addition of small amounts of Ti significantly changes the electronic environment of Cr oligomerisation sites by the formation of Cr–O–Ti–O–Si linkages, favouring β-H transfer and increasing the selectivity towards butene at the expense of 1 -hexene.

(-) -Sparteine in conjunction with a co-catalyst is capable of synthesising isotactic PLA with very few stereoerrors, but its sudden commercial unavailability has led to a need for a replacement.

Post-polymerisation provides access to functionalities not compatible with ROP, and allowing careful tailoring of polymer properties.

The stereochemical arrangement about the central cobalt atom is approximately octahedral with cyanide groups above and below the macrocycle. The structures of the two isomers, β and α, selected from the three isomers isolated for the [Co(ethylenediamine) (dipropylenetriamine) X]²⁺ system, have been determined. These were found to possess the same topological arrangement of the ligands about the central cobalt atom, but with different conformations of the tridentate polyamine.

40|$|Supported olefin {{polymerisation}} catalysts {{are used}} to produce more than 20 million tonnes of polyethylene a year. In this thesis, the application of non- equilibrium plasmas to Phillips, Ziegler-Natta, and metallocene catalysts is described. A Cr(acetate) /silica Phillips catalyst precursor was activated using either thermal, plasma, or combined activations. Oxygen plasma activation was found to completely oxidise the acetate ligands, but left a low chromium dispersion and high hydroxyl population on the support. This large hydroxyl population caused the resulting catalyst to display a low activity. Plasma dehydroxylation of the silica support was then studied {{with the aim of}} increasing the activity of the plasma activated catalyst. Non-isothermal CF 4 plasma treatment of mesoporous silica decreased the total hydroxyl population to a level comparable to a 773 K thermal treatment. These optimum conditions were then applied to the catalyst precursor, which in combination with oxygen plasma activation, produced an active <b>polymerisation</b> <b>catalyst.</b> Also, it has been found that combined thermal and plasma activations produce catalysts of lower activity than when solely calcined, but the resulting polymers have a narrower molecular weight distribution. Next, it was shown that Zeigler-Natta catalyst supports can be prepared by ccl(_ 4) plasma chlorination of a dibutylmagnesium/silica precursor. This approach offers the benefits of fast reaction times and less chemical waste compared to conventional solution phase chlorination. Finally, the replacement of conventional inorganic supports by polymer analogues has been investigated.

40|$|M. Sc. An annual {{production}} of approximately 46 {{million metric tons}} of polyolefins worldwide, emphasizes the industrial importance of this product and the polymerisation process. Olefins are the basic building block of the petrochemical industry and are therefore readily available and cheap. Reactivity of olefins decreases from ethylene to propylene to 1 -octene and makes the study of <b>polymerisation</b> <b>catalysts</b> more complex, seeing that the activity of a catalyst differs from monomer to monomer. In this study zirconocene complexes with bridged cyclopentadienyl ligands have been prepared and investigated as, possible <b>catalysts</b> for the <b>polymerisation</b> of higher aolefins.

40|$|Combinatorial {{approaches}} in which libraries of different materials {{can be derived}} from one single reactive polymer precursor have emerged as very powerful tools to facilitate the materials discovery process. 1 The main advantages in using this strategy are twofold. Firstly, as libraries of different materials can be generate from one single polymeric precursor, the resulting functional polymers will feature identical macromolecular characteristics, including degree of polymerisation, polydispersity index and macromolecular architecture. This will facilitate the study of structure-property relationships that correlate a polymeric structural feature to biological response. Secondly, molecules containing functional groups that are incompatible with the polymerisation conditions employed or which can interfere with other reaction elements – i. e. poisoning the <b>polymerisation</b> <b>catalyst</b> - can be easily introduced onto the polymer backbone. The use of “clickable”polymers 2 in combinatorial polymer post-functionalisation is very promising, especially since a recent report by Munro and co-workers showed that some Nhydroxysuccinimide ester polymers, arguably the most popular amongst the scaffolds employed in this field, can undergo important side-reactions during the final conjugation step that could potentially limit their applicability for the synthesis of multivalent therapeutics. 3 The driving force behind the enormous yet still increasing popularity of click chemistry in polymer science is the need for simple and effective synthetic tools to mimic nature’s guiding principles to develop orthogonal chemistry in vitro. 4 In addition, it is now becoming more and more evident that commercially exploitable products must be produced following robust and cost-effective synthetic strategies. It is now clear that the idea of extreme efficiency intrinsic in the concept of click chemistry ultimately must be transferred to processes as a whole rather than remaining confined to individual reaction steps. In the present work we investigated the possibility of developing one-pot multistep strategies for the synthesis of well defined clickable (meth) acrylic scaffolds presenting multiple copies of alkyne clickable units, prepared by controlled radical polymerisation (ATRP and RAFT) (Scheme 2), opening the way for the take the novel functional materials towards practical use in a plethora of different applications.

40|$|One of {{the most}} illustrative {{examples}} of heterogeneous catalyst complexity is the Phillips-type Cr/SiO 2 catalyst, which is industrially used {{for the production of}} more than 40 % of all polyethylene worldwide. It is considered that (i) the amount of active Cr sites is less than 10 % of the total amount of surface Cr sites; (ii) almost every oxidation state between 2 and 6 has been proposed to be active in the polymerisation of ethylene and (iii) families of Cr sites are present, showing different polymerisation characteristics. A potential approach to tackle the associated problems when characterising the Phillips catalyst could be: (i) {{to find a way to}} order the surface of the catalyst material, if possible by creating a well-defined single-site system on which structural and mechanistic investigations can be undertaken and (ii) to develop more powerful analytical methodologies either by combining several complementary techniques or by refining the analytical methods in order to remove potential interfering effects. Both routes have been explored in this PhD thesis. A heterogeneous Cr-based <b>polymerisation</b> <b>catalyst</b> was converted into a highly active and selective ethylene trimerisation catalyst by using a special assembling approach. It was determined that the TAC ligand is coordinated to a surface CrIII site and that two chloride ligands are also present in the coordination sphere of Cr. At low ethylene pressure, this catalyst can produce highly branched oligomers where 1 -hexene is partially incorporated. At higher pressures, crystalline polymers enriched with a monoclinic phase are obtained. Moreover, it was discovered that, during the controlled assembly of the ethylene trimerisation site, the dispersive nature of the heterogeneous system is gradually removed. The following process is envisaged to take place: (i) Anchoring CrII species onto a silica surface leads to the formation of a catalytic system characterised by a broad dispersity in active ethylene polymerisation sites. (ii) CH 2 Cl 2 determines the internal oxidation of some CrII species to more uniform CrIII species, thus, leading to a partial reduction of the system dispersity. However, other possible surface Cr species (CrIIC-type, CrIII, CrIV, CrV present in the system) are insignificantly affected by the presence of CH 2 Cl 2. Polymerisation tests on the CH 2 Cl 2 -modified Cr/SiO 2 system have proved that this catalyst presents now a medium active site dispersity. Moreover, it has been shown that a lower number of more defined active sites is responsible for the increased polymerisation activity. (iii) The additional presence of the TAC ligand determines the almost complete conversion of surface Cr species into CrIII sites; i. e., a surface TAC-CrCl 2 /SiO 2 complex. The TAC ligand forces all surface chromium sites to adopt a unique conformation due to its rigid configuration induced by its cyclic structure. In this way, the poly-dispersity of the system is almost completely removed and the assembled system becomes mono-disperse. This unique surface trimerisation site is responsible for the PI value of 1. 87...|$|E
40|$|Over {{recent years}} {{significant}} {{progress has been}} made in the design and development of late transition metal cationic catalysts for olefin polymerisation. Never-the-less, the activation of catalyst precursors and generation of active species still remains a challenge. In this respect, zwitterionic catalysts could offer a range of advantages over the traditional two component catalytic systems. For example, stable zwitterions are well-defined, single component catalysts which do not require Lewis acid co-catalysts for activation. Therefore, this eliminates the possibility of anions coordinating to the active site and could provide highly active catalysts. Moreover, this could reduce the production costs. In this thesis the 6 -aminofulvene- 2 -aldiminate (AFA) ligand system has been employed to develop zwitterionic, charge-neutral complexes, analogues of Brookhart-type cationic alkene <b>polymerisation</b> <b>catalyst</b> containing 1, 2 -diimine ligand. Chapter 1 of the thesis provides a comprehensive literature review of the late transition metal (Group 10) α-diimine catalytic systems and the zwitterionic early and late transition metal alkene polymerisation catalysts. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis and characterisation of some novel zwitterionic complexes [(Ph 2 AFA) Pd(Me) (DMAP) ], [(Ph 2 AFA) (N,N-dimethylbenzylamine- 2 -C,N) - Pd(II) ] and [(Ph 2 AFA) Ni(η 3 -C 3 H 5) ] and their possible application as catalyst precursors in alkene polymerisation. In principle, upon activation these complexes should exhibit higher catalytic activity. The ideal catalyst precursor for a highly active palladium based system would be a halide-bridged dimer of the form [(Ph 2 AFA) Pd(μ-X) ] 2. Chapter 2 describes several efforts towards the synthesis of such complexes using a range of R 2 AFA ligands. Even with the introduction of bulky N-substituents such as cyclohexyl or tert-butyl, the halidebridged dimers could not be synthesised. Instead, the reaction between the deprotonated ligand and [PdCl 2 (NCPh) 2] provides bis-chelated complexes [(R 2 AFA) 2 Pd]. In order to introduce more steric bulk into the AFAH ligand which might lead to a halide-bridged dimer, two more ligands N,N’-bis(2, 6 -diisopropyl) phenyl- 6 -aminofulvene- 2 -aldimine and N,N’-di-(2, 4, 6 -trimethyl) phenyl- 6 -aminofulvene- 2 -aldimine have been synthesised and characterised. It has been found that the presence of the 2, 6 -diisopropylphenyl substituents in N,N'-bis(2, 6 -diisopropyl) phenyl- 6 -aminofulvene- 2 -aldimine not only prevents the coordination of two ligands to the same metal, but precludes complexation all together. Chapter 2 also describes several efforts to develop a hemi-labile complex for alkene polymerisation. Chapter 3 describes the synthesis of metalloligands of aminofulvene-aldimine (AFA) and corresponding bimetallic complexes. The AFA ligand affords transition metal complexes via both η 5 - as well as κ 2 -coordination modes. A new synthetic methodology has been developed to synthesise metalloligands [Cp*RuII(Ph 2 AFA) H][BF 4], [Cp*RhIII(Cy 2 AFA) H][BF 4] 2 and [Cp*RhIII(Cy 2 AFA) ]- [BF 4]. The basicity of the monocationic Rh metalloligand is found to be significantly lower than that of its Ru analogues. This is significant as it opens a potentially easy synthetic route to bimetallic complexes. The bimetallic complex [Cp*RhIII(Cy 2 AFAPdCl 2) ][BF 4] has been developed for alkene polymerisation in an attempt to investigate the charge effect in alkene polymerisation catalysis. Upon activation this monocationic Rh/Pd bimetallic complex would provide a dicationic active species which would in principle be a more highly active catalyst than the Brookhart mono cationic diimine catalysts. Chapter 4 describes all the experimental procedure and polymerisation tests in this thesis. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|E
50|$|Anions that {{interact}} weakly with cations are termed non-coordinating anions, {{although a}} more accurate term is weakly coordinating anion. Non-coordinating anions are useful in studying the reactivity of electrophilic cations. They are commonly found as counterions for cationic metal complexes with an unsaturated coordination sphere. These special anions are essential components of homogeneous olefin <b>polymerisation</b> <b>catalysts,</b> where the active catalyst is a coordinatively unsaturated, cationic transition metal complex. For example, they are employed as counterions for the 14 valence electron cations (C5H5)2ZrR+ (R = methyl or a growing polyethylene chain). Complexes derived from noncoordinating anions {{have been used to}} catalyze hydrogenation, hydrosilylation, oligomerization, and the living polymerization of olefins. The popularization of non-coordinating anions has contributed to increased understanding of agostic complexes wherein hydrocarbons and hydrogen serve as ligands. Noncoordinating anions are important components of many superacids, which result from the combination of Bronsted acids and Lewis acids.|$|R

Several N-alkyl-(2 -pyridyl) methanimines (alkyl = n-butyl, isobutyl, sec-butyl, n-propyl) and N-(n-propyl) - 1 -(2 -pyridyl) ethanimine as ligands have been fully characterised. Three bis[N-alkyl-(2 -pyridyl) methanimine]copper(I) complexes, [Cu{(C 5 H 4 N) CH=N(iBu) }(2) ][BF 4], [Cu{(C 5 H 4 N) C(CH 3) =N-(nPr) }(2) ][PF 6], and [Cu{(C 5 H 4 N) CH=N(sBu) }(2) ][BF 4] have been structurally characterised; all having a distorted tetrahedral arrangement of co-ordinating nitrogen atoms surrounding the metal centre. All of the catalysts were found to be effective atom-transfer <b>polymerisation</b> <b>catalysts</b> for the <b>polymerisation</b> of MMPI in hydrocarbon solution. However, it was discovered that the performance of the catalysts containing n-alkyl substituents was superior to those containing branched alkyl substituents.

40|$|The {{activity}} {{and stability of}} homogeneous olefin <b>polymerisation</b> <b>catalysts,</b> when immobilised on a support, are dependent on both chemical and physical effects. Chemical factors affecting catalyst activity include the ease of formation of the active species, which {{is strongly dependent on}} the transition metal. Catalyst productivity is dependent on the balance between {{activity and}} stability. Immobilisation can lead to a lower proportion of active species and therefore lower initial polymerisation activity, but nevertheless give higher polymer yields in cases where increased catalyst stability is obtained. Important physical factors are support porosity and the ability of a support to undergo progressive fragmentation during polymerisation, facilitating monomer diffusion through the growing catalyst/polymer particle. This article illustrates the importance of these factors in olefin polymerisation with both early- and late-transition metal catalysts, with particular reference to the use of silica and magnesium chloride supports as well as to effects of immobilisation on polymer structure and properties...|$|R
40|$|The first {{objectives}} {{of this work}} were to obtain a enantiomerically pure [Ti{OSSO}X 2] <b>polymerisation</b> <b>catalyst</b> and {{to use it to}} determine at what degree of polymerisation a polystyrene chain becomes cryptochiral. The resolution of the Delta and Lambda enantiomers of a [Ti{ 2, 2 ’-(OC 6 H 2 - 6 -tBu- 4 -Me) 2 SC 2 H 4 S}X 2] was attempted via chiral template synthesis. Complexation of the achiral bis(phenol) to a (R) - 1, 1 ’-bi- 2 -naphthoxy titanium species was not diastereoselective and reaction with 3, 3 ’-substituted templates did not proceed at all. Surprisingly, the partial hydrolysis of [Ti{(R) -C 20 H 12 O 2 }{ 2, 2 ’-(OC 6 H 2 - 6 -tBu- 4 -Me) 2 SC 2 H 4 S}] in acetone solution did proceed diastereoselectively to give a homochiral dinuclear species, bridged by a binaphtoxy moiety and by an oxygen atom. A chiral template can be abandoned if an [OSSO]-type ligand is developed with a chiral source that predetermines the configuration with which the ligand coordinated to the metal centre. Therefore, trans- 1, 2 -dithiacyclohexanediyl-bridged bis(phenols) were synthesised in three steps. Nucleophilic attack of an hydroxyarenethiolate on cyclohexene oxide, followed by chlorination, and substitution by a second equivalent of the thiolate gave exclusively 1, 2 -trans bis(phenols) via anchimeric assistance. The chiral bis(phenols) could be resolved either by classical resolution with (1 S) -camphorsulfonyl chloride or by preparative (chiral) HPLC of the diastereomers and enantiomers respectively. Reaction of trans- 1, 2 -dithiacyclohexanediyl-bridged [OSSO]-type ligands with TiX 4 proceeds diastereoselectively, thus giving access to enantiomerically pure precatalysts. In contrast to 1, 4 -dithiabutanediyl-bridged [OSSO] ligands, [2, 2 ’-(HOC 6 H 2 - 6 -R 1 - 4 -R 2) 2 SC 6 H 10 S] are so efficient in directing and maintaining the configuration of their respective titanium complexes that large ortho-substituents are not required. To investigate cryptochiality, low molecular weight oligostyrenes were produced by optically active titanium catalysts. The molecular weight during polymerisation could be controlled by addition of 1 -hexene as a chain-transfer agent. Depending on the substitution of the ligand, 1 -hexene-terminated oligostyrenes with a minimum molecular weight of 800 - 1300 g mol- 1 could be obtained. Oligomers with a polymerisation degree of up to ca. 45 show optical activity. Reaction of racemic [2, 2 ’-(HOC 6 H 2 - 6 -tBu- 4 -Me) 2 SC 6 H 10 S] with VOCl 3 afforded a C 1 -symmetrical bis(phenolato) vanadium(V) complex, which spontaneously resolves upon crystallisation. iastereoselectivity is the same as for titanium complexes. When activated with MAO, [V{ 2, 2 ’-(OC 6 H 2 - 6 -tBu- 4 -Me) 2 SC 6 H 10 S}OCl] did not polymerise propene or styrene, but was highly active for the polymerisation of ethene. Using similar nucleophilic ring-opening methodology as for the cyclohexanediyl-bridged [OSSO]-type ligands, a family of trans- 1, 2 -azathiacyclohexanediyl-bridged [OSNO]-type bis(phenols) was synthesised. In this fashion [2, 2 ’-(HOC 6 H 2 - 6 -tBu- 4 -R 1) 2 SC 6 H 10 NR 2] (R 1 = tBu, Me; R 2 = H, Me), [2, 2 ’-(HOC 6 H 2 - 4, 6 -tBu 2) 2 SC 6 H 10 N=CH] and [2, 2 ’-(HOC 6 H 2 - 4, 6 -tBu 2) 2 SC 6 H 10 NHCH 2] were obtained. Although for such asymmetrical ligands many isomers are possible, formation of titanium complexes of the first ligands proceeded with perfect diastereoselectively; the half-salen and half-salan hybrids gave a mixture of two isomers (Scheme S. 4). All titanium complexes were configurationally stable in solution up to 100 °C. For [Ti{ 2, 2 ’-(HOC 6 H 2 - 6 -tBu- 4 -R 1) 2 SC 6 H 10 NR 2 }X 2] (X = Cl, OiPr), cis-alpha and cis-beta 2 coordination modes of the ligand were observed, depending on the nitrogen substituent and on the auxiliary ligand. In [Ti{ 2, 2 ’-(HOC 6 H 2 - 4, 6 -tBu 2) 2 SC 6 H 10 N=CH}Cl 2] and [Ti{ 2, 2 ’-(HOC 6 H 2 - 4, 6 -tBu 2) 2 SC 6 H 10 NHCH 2 }Cl 2] both configurations coexist and did not interconvert at elevated temperatures, but HCl catalysed the isomerization from cis-alpha to cis-beta 2. Upon activation with methylaluminoxane, [Ti{OSNO}X 2] complexes were moderately active in the polymerization of styrene and gave trace activity in the polymerization of 1 -hexene, thus combining the worst polymerisation properties of their parent ligands, rather than the best. A different way to influence polymerisation properties is to investigate the effect of the linkage between the arene groups. For group 4 [ONNO]-type catalysts, only salen- and salan-type complexes are known; 1, 4 -diazabutanediyl-bridged bis(phenolato) species were not examined. These ligands were synthesised by reaction of the 3, 5 -tBu 2 -catechol with ethylene diamine and optional methylation of the nitrogen atoms. With the appropriate metal precursors MX 4 (M = Ti, Zr, Hf) a series of group 4 metal dichloro and di(isopropoxy) complexes [M{ 2, 2 ’-(OC 6 H 2 - 4, 6 -tBu 2) 2 NRC 2 H 4 NR}X 2] (Ti: R = H, Me; X = Cl, OiPr; Zr, Hf: X = Cl; R = Me) was obtained. Whilst [ONNO] zirconium and hafnium dichlorides gave configurationally stable cis-alpha species up to 100 °C, titanium [ONNO] complexes gave both cis-alpha and cis-beta isomers (Scheme S. 5). The configuration of [Ti{ 2, 2 ’-(OC 6 H 2 - 4, 6 -tBu 2) 2 MeNC 2 H 4 NMe}Cl 2] and [Ti{ 2, 2 ’-(OC 6 H 2 - 4, 6 -tBu 2) 2 HNC 2 H 4 NH}Cl 2] changed from cis-beta to cis-alpha at elevated temperatures. Upon activation with methylaluminoxane, all precatalysts polymerised styrene with modest activity. Good (M = Ti) to excellent (M = Zr, Hf) activity in the atactic polymerization of 1 -hexene was observed...|$|E
