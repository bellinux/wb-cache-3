2500|$|Early LCC systems used mercury-arc valves, with {{designs that}} had evolved from those used on high power {{industrial}} rectifiers. [...] A number of adaptations {{were needed to}} make such valves suitable for HVDC, in particular the use of anode voltage grading electrodes to minimise the risk of arc-back at the very high reverse voltages experienced in HVDC. Much of the pioneering {{work in this area}} was performed in Sweden by Dr Uno Lamm, widely considered the “Father of HVDC” and in whose name the IEEE introduced the “Uno Lamm Award” for outstanding contributions in the field of HVDC. The very long anode columns needed for high voltage applications limited the current which could safely be carried by each anode, so most mercury-arc valves for HVDC used several (most often, four) anode columns in parallel <b>per</b> <b>valve.</b>|$|E

50|$|The 12 {{thyristor}} valves at {{each side}} {{are arranged in}} a conventional twelve-pulse bridge. The valves are cooled by a mixture of de-ionised water and ethylene glycol, which does not freeze at a temperature of -50°C. These were the first thyristor valves ever to use water/glycol mixtures directly inside the valve, with no separate secondary cooling circuit. The valves use 100mm, 5.2 kV electrically triggered thyristors with 11 in series <b>per</b> <b>valve</b> on the Alberta side and 12 in series <b>per</b> <b>valve</b> on the Saskatchewan side.|$|E
5000|$|Chinese {{freshwater}} mussels were once grafted up to 50 times per shell, or 25 times <b>per</b> <b>valve.</b> This practice was common when the industry mussel was primarily the cockscomb pearl mussel (Cristaria plicata). This mussel produced a high volume of low-quality pearls {{that came to}} be known as [...] "Rice Krispie pearls" [...] in the 1970s and 1980s. More than a decade ago the freshwater pearl industry of China shifted production from the cockscomb pearl mussel to the triangle shell mussel (Hyriopsis cumingii). The triangle shell produced fewer pearls, accepting only 12-16 grafts <b>per</b> <b>valve</b> for a total production of 24 to 32 pearls, but produced pearls of better quality.|$|E
50|$|Phases 2 and 3 used {{improved}} thyristors with {{a rating}} of 2.4 kV each and only required 192 in series <b>per</b> <b>valve</b> - still a large number by modern standards - with two in parallel. As a result, each converter station contained a total of 22,656 thyristors.|$|E

5000|$|Honda's {{advanced}} VTEC technology departs {{greatly from}} its previous incarnations by no longer relying on switching between {{two sets of}} lobes on a given camshaft. It instead uses a single cam lobe <b>per</b> <b>valve,</b> and two rocker arms <b>per</b> <b>valve</b> whereby the second rocker arm has a movable pivot point, there by provide the varying cam lift. Advanced VTEC motors still use the now standard oil pressure controlled variable cam gear angle mechanism. With these two technologies combined Honda has developed an infinitely variable valve timing and lift system ("VVTL"). Previous versions of VTEC included only staged VVTL i.e. High-Low. With the introduction of i-VTEC the systems gained infinitely variable valve timing but still only staged lift i.e. High-Low. The [...] "infinitely variable" [...] portion of the A-VTEC {{is what makes it}} stand out as a serious evolutionary step in the world of VTEC.|$|E
50|$|One unique {{feature of}} the design was that the {{camshaft}} only had six lobes. One lobe operated both the intake and exhaust valve for each cylinder. This made engineering cam profiles a bit more difficult than conventional two lobe per cylinder (one <b>per</b> <b>valve)</b> designs, but allowed the valves to be better arranged for the cross-flow head. Valves were directly opposite their respective ports, and ports were short with wide radius turns.|$|E
50|$|The Mazda FE-DOHC uses a wide-angle, DOHC, {{belt-driven}} valvetrain configuration with flat-tappet 33 mm HLA bucket lifters. It is a interference design. There are two {{valve springs}} <b>per</b> <b>valve</b> and four valves per cylinder. While a dual valve spring configuration is used, the stock springs are fairly low-sprung. Low spring rates {{were chosen for}} increased valvetrain longevity and low friction with the dual valve springs for the reduction of harmonics and increased valve stability.|$|E

50|$|In contrast, {{desmodromic}} drive uses two cams <b>per</b> <b>valve,</b> {{each with}} separate rocker arm (lever tappets). Maximum valve acceleration being limited by cam-to-tappet galling stress, {{is governed by}} moving mass and cam contact area. Rigidity and contact stress are best achieved with conventional flat tappets and springs whose lift and closure stress is unaffected by spring force, both occurring at the base circlewhere spring load is minimum and contact radius is largest.Curved (lever) tappetsof desmodromic cams cause higher contact stress than flat tappets for the same lift profile, thereby limiting rate of lift and closure.|$|E

50|$|Similar to Fordilla, {{species of}} Pojetaia are small, with valves {{to less than}} 2 mm in length. Pojetaia species have an overall shape which is suboval, with the subequal valves {{slightly}} elongated. The ligament is straight with an umbo which is central to subcentral. In contrast to Fordilla the rear adductor muscle was larger and more developed then the front adductor, with pallial muscles arranged along the valve margins. Also in contrast to Fordilla, valves of Pojetaia possess between one and three teeth, with up to two teeth <b>per</b> <b>valve.</b> The exteriors of the shells show faint ribbing and ﬁne comarginal growth lines.|$|E
50|$|As a {{camshaft}} normally {{has only}} one lobe <b>per</b> <b>valve,</b> the valve duration and lift is fixed. The camshaft rotates at half {{the rate of the}} crankshaft. Although many modern engines use camshaft phasing, adjusting the lift and valve duration in a working engine is more difficult. Some manufacturers use systems with more than one cam lobe, but this is still a compromise as only a few profiles can be in operation at once. This is not the case with the camless engine, where lift and valve timing can be adjusted freely from valve to valve and from cycle to cycle. It also allows multiple lift events per cycle and, indeed, no events per cycle—switching off the cylinder entirely.|$|E
50|$|What was {{the goal}} {{to develop a}} {{reliable}} self-oscillating mixer? The reasons were to differ from the UK to America. The UK radio manufacturers had to pay a royalty of £1 <b>per</b> <b>valve</b> holder to the British Valve Association to cover use of their members' patent rights. Further, they dictated that not more than one electrode structure could be contained in a single envelope (which would have evaded the royalty - at least in part). The Americans appeared {{to be driven by}} the desire to produce a low-cost 'every expense spared' design which was to lead to the All American Five. By making the mixer self-oscillate, the necessity of providing a separate oscillator valve is avoided. The All American Five was to use a pentagrid converter from when it first appeared in 1934, right up until valves became obsolete when transistors took over.|$|E

50|$|The {{nomenclature}} {{does not}} follow the formula from the previous decades, i.e., engine capacity (in liters) followed by number of cylinders (e.g. 246 = 2.4 liters, 6 cylinders, 308 = 3.0 liters, 8 cylinders, etc.). For the F355, Ferrari used engine capacity followed {{by the number of}} <b>valves</b> <b>per</b> cylinder (355 = 3.5 litres engine capacity and 5 <b>valves</b> <b>per</b> cylinder) to bring the performance advances introduced by a 5 <b>valve</b> <b>per</b> cylinder configuration into the forefront.|$|R

5000|$|The '91 GSX-R750M gained 15 kg {{over the}} {{previous}} model. The most notable feature of the [...] "M" [...] are the faired in headlamps and a slanted nose, {{both of which were}} designed to reduce drag. Also fitted was a new larger seat and new rear body work that featured twin tail lamps. This was the last GSX-R to use the oil-cooled SACS engine (except for US). Internal engine changes included a new valvetrain that used one dedicated cam lobe and rocker arm (finger follower) <b>per</b> <b>valve</b> (previous models used one lobe and one forked rocker per two valves). Valve clearance (lash) was now adjusted with shims (previous models used a screw and nut). The cam duration and indexing changed slightly as well as the porting according to a magazine article. The rear tyre width was increased to a 170 mm section width. The gauges also changed to white coloured needles (previously amber coloured).|$|E
5000|$|The {{desmodromic}} system avoids this problem, {{because it}} does not have to overcome the static energy of the spring. It must work against the momentum of the valve opening and closing, and that force still depends on the effective mass of the moving parts. The effective mass of a traditional valve with spring includes one-half of the valve spring mass and all of the valve spring retainer mass. However, a desmodromic system must deal with the inertia of the two rocker arms <b>per</b> <b>valve,</b> so this advantage depends greatly on the skill of the designer. Another disadvantage is the contact point between the cams and rocker arms. It is relatively easy to use roller tappets in conventional valvetrains, although it does add considerable moving mass. In a desmodromic system the roller would be needed {{at one end of the}} rocker arm, which would greatly increase its moment-of-inertia and negate its [...] "effective mass" [...] advantage. Thus, desmo systems have generally needed to deal with sliding friction between the cam and rocker arm and therefore may have greater wear. The contact points on most Ducati rocker arms are hard-chromed to reduce this wear. Another possible disadvantage is that it would be very difficult to incorporate hydraulic valve lash adjusters in a desmodromic system, so the valves must be periodically adjusted, but this is true of typical performance oriented motorcycles as valve lash is typically set using a shim under a cam follower.|$|E
50|$|This term is {{used for}} engines which have two intake and two exhaust <b>valves</b> <b>per</b> {{cylinder}}; four (or five) <b>valves</b> <b>per</b> cylinder result in engines having superior high RPM performance sourced from total port circumference, rather than the relative location of the ports.|$|R
