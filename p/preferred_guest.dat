Recently, many promoters have taken advantage of online technology such as online social networks and event listing sites to handle publicity, invitations, mailing lists, and so on.

The availability of standard optically pure guest materials is not required, nor is the isolation of the guest species from the host crystal, resulting in an attractive, inexpensive, rapid and simple procedure for this purpose...|$|E
40|$|Peat bogs of the Šumava National Park {{are very}} {{valuable}} biotopes with an {{occurrence of the}} specific flora and fauna, including glacial relicts. But these localities are also very attractive for tourists, so {{it is important to}} find the reasonable compromise between an attendance and a nature protection. The study is dealing with the touristic attendance of two peat bogs ? Chalupská and Jezerní slať. The work is divided into two parts. The first, theoretical part, include a literary review about the character, history and use of these peat bogs. A practical part monitors the attendance of the peat bogs and analyses the research via questionnaire, focused on the comparison of Chalupská and Jezerní slať popularity among tourists. During five days of the research, it was found that Chalupská slať is not more popular than Jezerní. Mostly Czech tourists visited both peat bogs, they consider information boards as contributing, though most of them do not read all the information. Most of the visitors came by bicycle, stayed for a longer vacation (more than 7 days) and <b>preferred</b> <b>guest</b> houses accommodation to camping sites. The problem of a sustainability of these localities attendance is also outlined...|$|E
40|$|This bachelors thesis {{deals with}} loyalty program of {{accommodation}} facilities. The thesis characterize {{principles of the}} program and describes its functioning. The loyalty program is used by many firms, therefore the aim of this work is to assess its effectiveness through the evaluations of the particular loyalty program, Starwood <b>Preferred</b> <b>Guest,</b> which is founded by hotels chain called Starwood Hotels and Resorts, Inc. The evaluation is done from two different points of view. From the members point of view it focuses on its benefits and satisfactions., whereas the companys point of view the prior focus is on its profitability. The study is based on real impacts of the loyalty program on selected accommodation. The impacts are pictured in the statistics form, which are provided from internal sources of the chosen hotel. The figures are used for calculation of the profitability, which includes computation of how much the income from a member differs from a regular guest. To evaluate the advantageous of the program for a customer the information gained from the characteristic of the program has been used. To determine members satisfaction, the analysis of the guests review has been used. This thesis contributes to increase an awareness of the importance of loyalty programs, particularly of accommodation loyalty programs...|$|E

40|$|Large {{amounts of}} CH 4 {{are trapped in}} {{naturally}} occurring gas hydrate deposits. Extensive research on these species has generated a considerable interest in developing technologically and economically viable recovery methods for this potentially enormous energy source. Extraction of CH 4 from the hydrate phase by replacing it with CO 2 is the most recently proposed approach. As this simultaneously offers geological sequestration of CO 2 it {{is regarded as a}} very promising option. Extensive knowledge and experimental data on the CO 2 -CH 4 hydrate phase equilibrium is a requirement for further development of this approach. This thesis features phase equilibria studies on simple CO 2, simple CH 4 and mixed CO 2 -CH 4 gas hydrates. In addition to this the CO 2 -CH 4 exchange reaction has been investigated by injecting CO 2 into a system containing stable CH 4 hydrates in the presence of available water and CH 4. The experiments were performed in a high pressure cell fitted with a state of the art data acquisition system. CO 2 injection led to additional mixed hydrates due to available CH 4 and water, which suggest that CO 2 injection into a reservoir rock containing excess water may lead to a decrease in permeability. Over a series of six CO 2 -CH 4 hydrate experiments it was found that gradually changing the gas composition from CO 2 dominant to CH 4 dominant, gradually shifts the L_w-V-H phase equilibrium line towards higher requirements for thermodynamic driving forces. CO 2 was found to be the <b>preferred</b> <b>guest</b> molecule. The simple hydrate experiments showed that quantitative changes in a simple hydrate system does not affect the L_w-V-H phase equilibrium line. Predicted equilibrium curves calculated in PVT have been compared to experimental PT curves during dissociation of the hydrate phase. Phase equilibrium calculations show good agreement with experimental data. However, some deviations are seen for the mixed CO 2 -CH 4 hydrate systems...|$|E

50|$|The {{premise of}} the game is to {{complete}} a series of preset scenarios by successfully building and maintaining amusement parks through business ownership as a theme park entrepreneur. The key to any park is building a large amount and diverse range of rides for the visitors. Players can choose from dozens of roller coaster types and can also build log flumes, carousels, bumper cars, haunted houses, go karts, ferris wheels, and swinging ships, among other rides. The intensity and type of rides must be balanced, as visitors' preferences vary significantly from person to person.
