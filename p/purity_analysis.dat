40|$|Abstract—Purity Analysis is {{the problem}} of {{determining}} whether or not a method may have side-effects. This has many applications, including automatic parallelisation, extended static checking, and more. We present a novel algorithm for inferring the purity of methods in Java. Our algorithm exploits two properties, called freshness and locality, which, when combined together, enable more precise <b>purity</b> <b>analysis.</b> Our algorithm also differs from the majority of previous attempts at <b>purity</b> <b>analysis,</b> in that it is modularly checkable. That is, the algorithm produces annotations which can be checked without the need for an expensive and costly interprocedural analysis.
