40|$|Abstract This essay {{presents}} and discusses {{the state of}} the art in studies of desert ant (Cataglyphis) navigation. In dealing with behavioural performances, neural mechanisms, and ecological functions these studies ultimately aim at an evolutionary understanding of the insect’s navigational toolkit: its skylight (polarization) compass, its path integrator, its view-dependent ways of recognizing <b>places</b> <b>and</b> following landmark <b>routes,</b> <b>and</b> its strategies of flexibly interlinking these modes of navigation to generate amazingly rich behavioural out-puts. The general message is thatCataglyphis uses path integration as an egocentric guideline to acquire con-tinually updated spatial information about <b>places</b> <b>and</b> <b>routes.</b> Hence, it relies on procedural knowledge, and largely context-dependent retrieval of such knowledge, rather than on all-embracing geocentred representations of space...|$|R

40|$|A {{numerical}} simulation method which can establish a designed debris flow hydrograph and hazards due to flooding of it under arbitrary basin and rainfall conditions are given. This method is consisted {{of one and}} two dimensional analysis. One dimensional analysis can evaluate a debris flow developing process by erosion and deposition of gully bed by surface water runoff or supply of debris and water as a consequent of landslide. Whether landslides will occur or not is one of very important factors to generate a large-scale debris flow. The effects of the landslide location {{and the number of}} landslide to the generated debris flow hydrograph are investigated. Two dimensional analysis can evaluate the process of flooding and deposition of a debris flow. This method can identify hazardous zones, examine the safety of the refuge <b>places</b> <b>and</b> <b>routes,</b> <b>and</b> give useful information about mechanism of occurrence of the debris flow hazard to the residents.

40|$|Abstract—This paper {{presents}} {{a novel approach}} to reduce dynamic power in field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) by reducing glitches during routing. It finds alternative routes for early-arriving signals so that signal arrival times at look-up tables are aligned. We developed an efficient algorithm to find routes with target delays and then built a glitch-aware router aiming at reducing dynamic power. To {{the best of our}} knowledge, this is the first glitch-aware routing algorithm for FPGAs. Experiments show that an average of 27 % reduction in glitch power is achieved, which translates into an 11 % reduction in dynamic power, compared to the glitch-unaware versatile <b>place</b> <b>and</b> <b>route’s</b> router.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{presents}} an exploration {{environment for the}} design of 2 D island-style coarse grained FPGA architectures. An architecture description file defines various architectural parameters including the definition of new coarse grained blocks, the positioning of blocks in the architecture and the selection of routing network. Once the initial architecture is defined, a software flow <b>places</b> <b>and</b> <b>routes</b> a target netlist on the generated architecture. The placement cost of a netlist is optimized either by changing the position of netlist instances on its respective blocks or by changing the position of blocks on the architecture. A single FPGA architecture can also be obtained for mapping a set of netlists at mutually exclusive times. It has been found that the sum of the placement costs of all the netlists is found to be minimum if all the netlists are used to get a single architecture.

40|$|Abstract. To support natural {{interactive}} way-finding tasks, computational formalisms {{of places}} are needed. In this extended abstract we present {{the idea of}} conceptual route graphs, which represent places using decision points, local <b>route</b> graphs <b>and</b> directional relations for modelling places in different way-finding situations. The application of formal spatial representations allows formal spatial reasoning about places, in particular deductions with qualitative calculi. 1 Small Places as Decision Points in Route Graphs A framework for Conceptual Route Graphs has previously been presented, based on <b>Route</b> Graphs <b>and</b> the Double Cross Calculus [4]. In this approach, <b>places</b> <b>and</b> <b>route</b> segments are represented as nodes and directed edges of a route graph; routes are composed of consecutive route segments. Places act as decision points for {{the choice of a}} route segment, emanating from this place, to follow next in a route.

40|$|Symbolic path {{planning}} in autonomous robotic agents is the search, {{on a network}} of <b>places</b> <b>and</b> <b>routes</b> modeling the environment, for a sequence of routes which enables an agent to execute a set of inter-related tasks. When several agents {{are present in the}} environment, each having been assigned a set of tasks, the adoption of coordination mechanisms allows the task-execution costs to be decreased. The formulation of tasks includes resources, resource types, temporal and precedence constraints, production and use of objects. In this paper we propose a market-like negotiation protocol which extends the well-known Contract Net Protocol to domains where task swap is the only possible type of contract. After planning an initial path to execute its tasks, each agent uses this protocol to progressively decrease the path cost by swapping tasks with other agents. The agents we consider are heterogeneous and self-interested, and communicate with each other by broadcasting messages with a limited radius...|$|R

MUGGES provides an infrastructure to create, publish, provide and consume mobile micro-services directly from mobile devices. As part of the project four application prototypes have been developed, which allow for the description <b>and</b> sharing of <b>places</b> <b>and</b> <b>routes</b> between users. This paper reports about a user trial conducted in real environments with early adopters. The goal has been to identify benefits and best practices for the type of applications envisioned in the MUGGES project. The obtained results indicate that users like to share information about preferred <b>places</b> or <b>routes,</b> <b>and</b> see it as a complementary application to already existing applications such as Facebook or Twitter. These types of applications are often used in time-killing situations, e. g. at the bus stop.

People feel that the application is less intrusive, since no information such as the whereabouts of persons are shared anyhow.

40|$|Navigation {{has always}} been an {{interdisciplinary}} topic of research, because mobile agents of different types are inevitably faced with similar navigational problems. Therefore, human navigation can readily be compared to navigation in other biological organisms or in artificial mobile agents like autonomous robots. One such navigational strategy, route-based navigation, in which an agent moves from one location to another by following a particular route, is the focus of this paper. Drawing on the research from cognitive psychology and linguistics, biology, and robotics, we present a simple, abstract formalism to express the key concepts of route-based navigation in a common scientific language. Starting with the distinction of <b>places</b> <b>and</b> <b>route</b> segments, we develop the notion of a route graph, which can {{serve as the basis for}} complex navigational knowledge. Implications and constraints of the model are discussed along the way, together with examples of different instantiations of parts of the model in different mobile agents.
