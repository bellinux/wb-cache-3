5|$|The UMWA used {{civil disobedience}} to attract {{attention}} {{to the needs of}} the miners. The union stressed that all actions of the strike must remain peaceful. However, many miners still used violent methods during the strike. The strike gained the media's attention.

In many cases, <b>people</b> <b>went</b> into cities outside the traditional area of their ethnic group. There are now important Ovimbundu communities in Luanda, Malanje, and Lubango. There has been a degree of return, but at a slow pace, while many younger people are reluctant to go to a rural life that they never knew.|$|E
5|$|After {{getting off}} the bed, the Hero is then given a task to get a crown in {{preparation}} for the annual Mountain Spirit festival from the elder which takes him to Haggleton. However he finds out the man that is supposed to make the crown has gone out somewhere to the northwest of town and never came back. The hero then heads in that direction and finds a large hole with the crown maker just barely hanging on. The hero attempts to rescue him and succeeds but in the process, slips and falls to the world below. In this mysterious world, the hero finds a nearby town in which the townspeople cannot see him. The hero grabs a tip from one of the townspeople that there's a special well to the north which <b>people</b> <b>went</b> in never came back; thus the hero heads in that direction and returns to his world.|$|E

5|$|An {{estimated}} 13 million <b>people</b> <b>went</b> {{whale watching}} globally in 2008, in all oceans except the Arctic. Rules and {{codes of conduct}} have been created to minimize harassment of the whales. Iceland, Japan and Norway have both whaling and whale watching industries. Whale watching lobbyists {{are concerned that the}} most inquisitive whales, which approach boats closely and provide much of the entertainment on whale-watching trips, {{will be the first to}} be taken if whaling is resumed in the same areas. Whale watching generated US$2.1 billion (UK£1.4 billion) per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers. In contrast, the whaling industry, with the moratorium in place, generates US$31 million (UK£20 million) per year. The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the whaling industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource.|$|E
5|$|Arafat was {{pronounced}} dead at 03:30UTC on 11 November 2004 {{at the age of}} 75 of what French doctors called a massive hemorrhagic cerebrovascular accident (hemorrhagic stroke). Initially, Arafat's medical records were withheld by senior Palestinian officials, and Arafat's wife refused an autopsy. French doctors also said that Arafat suffered from a blood condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation, although it is inconclusive what brought about the condition. When Arafat's death was announced, the Palestinian <b>people</b> <b>went</b> into a state of mourning, with Qur'anic mourning prayers emitted from mosque loudspeakers throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, and tires burned in the streets. The Palestinian Authority and refugee camps in Lebanon declared 40 days of mourning.|$|E
5|$|Despite its poor organization, Maria brought heavy {{rainfall}} to {{portions of the}} east Caribbean, notably Puerto Rico. Numerous roadways and homes were flooded, and as the storm passed through the extreme northeastern Caribbean, over 15,000 <b>people</b> <b>went</b> without power. In addition, tropical storm-force winds were observed {{on many of the}} U.S. Virgin Islands. As the system passed west of Bermuda, brief tropical storm-force sustained winds were recorded, along with higher gusts; rainfall on the island, however, was minimal. In Newfoundland, strong winds were recorded, but rainfall totals were relatively minimal. There were no deaths reported in association with Maria, although the storm caused $1.3 million (2011 USD) in damage.|$|E

5|$|Emigration to {{the west}} {{decreased}} over the following years, but {{it is likely that}} the drop in numbers was caused more by fears over the outcome of the ongoing Mexican-American War than by the cautionary tale of the Donner Party. In 1846, an estimated 1,500 people migrated to California. In 1847, the number dropped to 450 and to 400 in 1848. The California Gold Rush spurred a sharp increase, however, and 25,000 <b>people</b> <b>went</b> west in 1849. Most of the overland migration followed the Carson River, but a few forty-niners used the same route as the Donner Party and recorded descriptions about the site.|$|E
5|$|Since 1725, the iodine-rich seawaters of Póvoa, {{due to the}} {{peculiar}} high quantities of seaweed that ends up in Póvoa beaches from the sheltered bay to Cape Santo André, brought by ocean currents, lead that Benedictine monks choose to take sea-baths in there, searching cures for skin and bone problems. Still in the 18th century, other <b>people</b> <b>went</b> to Póvoa with the same concerns. In the 19th century, the town became popular as a summer destination for the wealthy of Entre-Douro-e-Minho province and Portuguese Brazilians, due to its large sandy beaches {{and the development of}} theaters, hotels and casinos. It then became renowned for its refined literary culture, artistic patronage in music and theater, and intellectual tertulia.|$|E
5|$|Cyclone Rewa {{affected}} Papua New Guinea on {{two separate}} occasions {{while it was}} active, with the cyclone first affecting the archipelago between 28December and 1January, before grazing the archipelago between 12-14January. Before Rewa affected the country, cyclone alerts and warnings were issued for Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands, while authorities urged people {{not to go to}} beaches. As it affected the archipelago, Rewa brought heavy rainfall, high seas, and wind gusts of up to 100km/h (60mph) to parts of the archipelago including Sudest, Rossel and Samarai islands. The hardest hit areas were communities near major river systems, with the cyclone blocking roads, destroying a church, bridges, homes and gardens with vital crops such as coffee and copra destroyed. In total, Cyclone Rewa left around 3500people homeless and caused 17deaths, 8 of which were due to flooding. Nine other <b>people</b> <b>went</b> missing while travelling to Rossel Island after their boat was caught up in high seas associated with Rewa. They were later presumed dead by the National Disaster and Emergency Service, after a local search and rescue mission found wreckage of the boat. At 00:00UTC on 30December, the automatic weather station at Jingo on Rossel island recorded a maximum sustained wind of 55km/h (35mph).|$|E

5|$|Irataba {{lived through}} a tumultuous period of Mohave history where the <b>people</b> <b>went</b> {{from being a}} {{politically}} independent nation to coming under the political control of the United States, and the events surrounding his role in these encounters are well documented. Most historical sources {{for the life of}} Irataba come from descriptions by white explorers or government agents with whom he interacted, or from contemporary newspapers that reported on his visits to the East Coast and California, and on the conflicts in Arizona territory. Some Mohave versions of the events also exist: in the early 20th century anthropologist A. L. Kroeber interviewed Jo Nelson (Mohave: Chooksa homar), a Mohave man who participated in many of the events and knew Irataba personally; another version was told to ethnographer George Devereux by Irataba's granddaughter Tcatc, and versions recounted by members of the Fort Mohave band of Mohave, the descendants of Homoseh quahote, were recorded by ethnographer Lorraine Sherer during the 1950s and 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Throughout the Saipan, 50 power lines, 20 transformers, and 6 {{power poles}} were damaged or destroyed, leaving 25{{percent of the}} islands' {{residents}} without power and $300,000 in damages. An estimated 90 percent of the banana trees were knocked down, contributing to the $518,000 in crop losses. Property losses on the two islands was estimated at $1.6million. On the islands of Alamagan, Pagan, and Agrihan all private homes, a total of six, were destroyed, the food stores and crops were lost, and the water supply was contaminated. The main public facility, which {{was used as a}} storm shelter on Alamagan, sustained heavy damage. Damages from the three islands amounted to $500,000. The following day, five <b>people</b> <b>went</b> out kayaking however, the rough seas overturned the kayaks and all five drowned. Numerous water rescues on jet skis had to be made as residents became stranded in their cars after driving into flooded roads. Damages throughout the islands amounted to $11.2million.|$|E
