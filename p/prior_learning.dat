40|$|International audienceFunctional brain imaging {{provides}} {{key information}} to characterize neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer's disease (AD). Specifically, the metabolic activity measured through fluorodeoxyglu-cose {{positron emission tomography}} (FDG-PET) and the connectivity extracted from resting-state {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI), are promising biomarkers {{that can be used for}} early assessment and prognosis of the disease and to understand its mechanisms. FDG-PET is the best suited functional marker so far, as it gives a reliable quantitative measure, but is invasive. On the other hand, non-invasive fMRI acquisitions do not provide a straightforward quantification of brain functional activity. To analyze populations solely based on resting-state fMRI, we propose an approach that leverages a metabolic <b>prior</b> <b>learned</b> from FDG-PET. More formally, our classification framework embeds population <b>priors</b> <b>learned</b> from another modality at the voxel-level, which can be seen as a regularization term in the analysis.

2500|$|In March 2006, the Slovianski {{project was}} started {{by a group of}} people from {{different}} countries, who felt the need for a simple and neutral Slavic language that the Slavs could understand without <b>prior</b> <b>learning.</b> The language they envisioned should be naturalistic and only consist of material existing in all or most Slavic languages, without any artificial additions. Initially, Slovianski was being developed in two different variants: a naturalistic version known as Slovianski-N (initiated by Jan van Steenbergen and further developed by Igor Polyakov), and a more simplified version known as Slovianski-P (initiated by Ondrej Rečnik and further developed by Gabriel Svoboda). The difference was that Slovianski-N had six grammatical cases, while Slovianski-P—like English, Bulgarian and Macedonian—used prepositions instead. Apart from these two variants (N stands for naturalism, P for pidgin or prosti [...] "simple"), a schematic version, Slovianski-S, has been experimented with as well, but was abandoned in an early stage of the project. In 2009 it was decided that only the naturalistic version would be continued under the name Slovianski. Although Slovianski had three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), six cases and full conjugation of verbs—features usually avoided in international auxiliary languages—a high level of simplification was achieved by means of simple, unambiguous endings and irregularity being kept to a minimum.|$|E
2500|$|The {{quality of}} {{information}} that is recalled can vary greatly depending on the information being remembered. It {{is important to understand}} the differences between remembering something and knowing something. If information about the learning context accompanies a memory (i.e. the setting), it is called a [...] "remember" [...] experience. However, if a person does not consciously remember the context in which he or she learned a particular piece of information and only has the feeling of familiarity towards it, it is called a [...] "know" [...] experience. It is widely believed that recognition has two underlying processes: recollection and familiarity. The recollection process retrieves memories from one's past and can elicit any number of associations of the prior experience ("remember"). In contrast, the familiarity process does not elicit associations with the memory and there are no contextual details of the <b>prior</b> <b>learning</b> occurrence ("know"). Since these two processes are dissociable, they can be affected by different variables (i.e. when remember is affected know is not and vice versa). For example, [...] "remember" [...] is affected by variables such as depth of processing, generation effects, the frequency of occurrence, divided attention at learning, and reading silently vs. aloud. In contrast, [...] "know" [...] is affected by repetition priming, stimulus modality, amount of maintenance rehearsal, and suppression of focal attention. There are cases however, where [...] "remember" [...] and [...] "know" [...] are both affected, but in opposite ways. An example of this would be if [...] "remember" [...] responses are more common than [...] "know" [...] responses. This can occur due to word versus nonword memory, massed versus distributed practice, gradual versus abrupt presentations, and learning in a way that emphasizes similarities vs. differences.|$|E

This is a descriptive study that used sequential mixed method design (QUAN emphasized). The {{purpose of the study}} was to identify factors affecting the implementation of a system for assessing RPEL in Nepal. A pragmatic paradigm guided the collection and analysis of data (survey and interview). A researcher-developed survey (. 719, Chronbach alpha index) containing 20 statements facilitated data collection for the quantitative phase of the study followed by interviews of individuals for the qualitative phase. The population of the study was comprised of the stakeholders of the education sector in Nepal covering various strata that includes university teachers, Ministry of Education personnel, workers who have a skills certificate and want to move on to higher education, and personnel of international development agencies working on human resource development in Nepal. A total of 80 individuals responded to the survey questionnaire and six individuals were interviewed. Quantitatively, the survey results of the stakeholders of the education system in Nepal showed some factors were influential on implementing Recognition of <b>Prior</b> Experiential <b>Learning</b> (RPEL) in Nepal. There were no consensuses among the groups regarding the identified factors on degree of influence on recognition of <b>prior</b> experiential <b>learning</b> with the factors that emerged from the survey, thus indicating that there is a mixed attitude towards RPEL.

In contrast, when we work with small image patches, it is possible to <b>learn</b> <b>priors</b> and perform patch restoration very efficiently. This raises three questions- do priors that give high likelihood to the data also lead to good performance in restoration? Can we use such patch based priors to restore a full image? Can we <b>learn</b> better patch <b>priors?</b> In this work we answer these questions. We compare the likelihood of several patch models and show that priors that give high likelihood to data perform better in patch restoration. Motivated by this result, we propose a generic framework which allows for whole image restoration using any patch based prior for which a MAP (or approximate MAP) estimate can be calculated. We show how to derive an appropriate cost function, how to optimize it and how to use it to restore whole images.
