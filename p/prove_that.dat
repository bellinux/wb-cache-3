30|$|Developing {{the notion}} of K-homotopy in the {{category}} of Khalimsky topological spaces, we have developed the notions of contractibility and local contractibility induced by the K-homotopy. Besides, <b>proving</b> <b>that</b> digital contractibilities imply local contractibilities for a K-contractible space X, we wondered if the space X has the FPP. In this paper, we <b>proved</b> <b>that</b> not every K-topological space with K-contractibility has the FPP. More precisely, for SC_K^n,l, we <b>proved</b> <b>that</b> SC_K^n,l does not have the FPP. For instance, we <b>proved</b> <b>that</b> whereas SC_K^n, 4 is K-contractible, it cannot have the FPP. However, we <b>proved</b> <b>that</b> a simple K-path has the FPP. In addition, we <b>proved</b> <b>that</b> in KTC the FPP is a K-topological invariant.|$|R
