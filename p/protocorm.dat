50|$|Like {{most other}} species of orchids, autumn lady's tresses needs a root fungus (or mycorrhiza) for its seed to {{germinate}} under field conditions. The seeds contain no endosperm or other food reserves. After germination, {{the lower part of}} the seedling (or <b>protocorm)</b> is colonized by mycorrhiza. The seedlings parasitize actually on the mycorrhiza, which provides both water, minerals and organic compounds. Since it takes about eight years before the plant produces green parts, this part of the lifecycle of this orchid is very long. Mature plants also contain mycorrhiza most of the year, but the amount of hyphae fluctuates with a maximum during the fall and winter. Most deeply infiltrated hyphae are digested at the beginning of flowering time, though the outer cell layer of the tuber may still contain living hyphae. New tubers are colonized when they have reached their maximum size. Infiltrated cells contain coils of hyphae of Rhizoctonia-type. Autumn lady's tresses can accommodate at least types of fungus in its roots. Some of these mycorrhizal fungi are from genera that also occur in other orchids, such as Ceratobasidium and Rhizoctonia. But there are also fungi present in the tubers that were not known to enter into an endophytic relationship, such as the ascomycete genera Davidiella, Leptosphaeria and Alternaria and the basidiomycete Malassezia. Even fungi that are known to be pathogenic in other plants, such as Fusarium oxysporum and Bionectria ochroleuca can be found in healthy specimens of this orchid, suggesting that it is able to keep such fungi in check.|$|E

In this interest, as supernatant we used bidistilled water, either on sucrose, glucose or fructose solutions, in different concentrations, which were applied over the inoculated <b>protocorms</b> on agarized medium cultures. The basic medium culture used by us in these experiments was Murashige – Skoog (1962) [13]. To this, we added different growth regulators, like: 2, 4 -D (2 mg/l), or mixtures of BA (2 mg/l) with NAA (1 mg/l), or only BA (2 mg/l), or only NAA (1 mg/l). The witness lot consisted of vitrocultivated <b>protocorms</b> on agarized medium culture, without growth regulators, cultivated in monolayer. After 90 days from the initiation of the double-layered medium cultures, we ascertained that, the application of the second layer (the liquid one) over the agarized medium cultures strongly stimulated the multiplication of Cymbidium <b>protocorms,</b> and mostly if the second layer was bidistilled water; the usage of a 5 % glucose solution as supernatant, was the most inefficient procedure, matter the micropropagation of Cymbidium <b>protocorms,</b> regardless the content of growth regulators existing in agarized layer of medium cultures...|$|R

30|$|From a {{developmental}} and functional point of view, orchid <b>protocorm</b> {{is a unique}} structure designed to establish symbiotic association with a compatible fungus, and with the primary goal to form a shoot apical meristem (SAM) for plantlet growth. The body plan of a <b>protocorm</b> is established during embryogeny, with cells having distinct cell fates. Hence the <b>protocorm</b> stage {{should not be considered}} as an extension of embryonic development. A recent molecular biology study also indicates that protocorms are molecularly distinct from zygotic embryonic tissues in Phaleaenopsis aphrodite (Fang et al. 2016). In order to avoid confusion in description, one should reframe from using the term ‘embryo’ when referring to a <b>protocorm.</b>|$|E
30|$|This {{perspective}} {{draws attention}} to the functional organization of orchid seed and <b>protocorm</b> during the course of development. The orchid embryos have a well-organized developmental plan generating a blue-print of a <b>protocorm</b> as they mature. The different phases of embryo development in orchids, i.e. histodifferentiation, storage product synthesis and accumulation, and maturation are essentially similar to other flowering plants. The <b>protocorm</b> is considered as a unique structure designed to establish symbiotic association with mycorrhizal fungi and with the primary goal to form a shoot apical meristem. This perspective brings forth arguments that the processes of embryo and <b>protocorm</b> development are highly programmed events, enhancing survival of orchid seeds and plantlets in their natural habitats. Furthermore, the ability of <b>protocorm</b> cells to divide, makes them ideal explants for micropropagation and transformation studies. Through seed germination and micropropagation using protocorms as explants, orchid conservation efforts are greatly enhanced.|$|E
30|$|For {{the ease}} of {{description}} and comparative evaluations from different published results, morphological stages of a <b>protocorm</b> or a plantlet in one’s study should be clearly defined. The proposed stages of germination and <b>protocorm</b> development by Zettler and Hofer (1998) are useful schemes detailing changes in seeds {{during the course of}} germination and <b>protocorm</b> formation. Vinogradova and Andronova (2002) also recognized five shoot types to describe the complexity of shoots formed by the apical buds of protocorms.|$|E
40|$|Abscisic acid (ABA) and sucrose {{are known}} to induce {{dehydration}} tolerance of in vitro plant cells and tissues. The present study reports the presence of different mechanisms by which sucrose and ABA improve dehydration tolerance of Spathoglottis plicata (orchid) <b>protocorms.</b> Orchid <b>protocorms</b> were generated aseptically from seeds on Murashig and Skoog medium, and then treated for 7 d in medium containing 10 mg L− 1 ABA and/or 10 % (w/v) sucrose. Dehydration tolerance of <b>protocorms</b> was determined at ∼ 25 °C under various drying conditions at relative humidity from 7 to 93 %. The actual rate of water loss (i. e. drying rate) was determined using the rate constant of tissue water loss during drying according to the first-order kinetics. Drying rate affected dehydration tolerance. ABA treatment reduced drying rate and increased dehydration tolerance of <b>protocorms</b> at all relative humidity values tested. However, when compared {{on the basis of}} actual drying rates, {{there was no difference in}} dehydration tolerance between control and ABA-treated <b>protocorms,</b> suggesting that ABA-induced tolerance was correlated with the drying rate reduction. Sucrose treatment was more effective than ABA treatment for the induction of dehydration tolerance. Interestingly, sucrose only slightly affected drying rate. ABA treatment significantly enhanced the synthesis of dehydrin, whereas sucrose treatment primarily resulted in sucrose accumulation. Sucrose treatment also affected protein turnover during drying, causing a significant decrease in protein content in <b>protocorms.</b> Slow drying promoted the degradation of high molecular weight proteins and enhanced the synthesis of low molecular weight dehydrin. The data suggest that different physiological mechanisms are probably involved in the induction of dehydration tolerance by ABA and sucrose treatment...|$|R

30|$|Successful {{polyploid}} induction {{can improve}} plant characteristics. For orchids, polypoid production can improve floral or growth characteristics (Chen et al. 2011; Miguel and Leonhardt 2011).

Since a <b>protocorm</b> is a post-embryonic structure, the initial leaf-like protrusion formed at the <b>protocorm</b> stage cannot be regarded as cotyledons (Batygina and Andronova 2000).

40|$|Epiphytic orchids have {{received}} considerable study, yet {{little has been}} published on their germination requirements in situ involving mycorrhizal fungi. Such research has been hampered by the small, dust-like size of seeds and leafless seedlings (<b>protocorms)</b> which are difficult to pinpoint on natural substrates, especially those on arboreal substrates (tree limbs). We report a novel seed sowing and retrieval method, modified from one applied to terrestrial orchids, used in the acquisition of epiphytic orchid <b>protocorms</b> from the Florida Panther National Wildlife Refuge. Seeds from two epiphytic orchid species (Epidendrum amphistomum A. Richard, E. nocturnum Jacquin) were placed in separate nylon mesh packets secured within 35 mm plastic slide mounts, and affixed to tree bark using gutter mesh and a staple gun. To confirm that the embryos were viable, some seeds were also sown on asymbiotic media in the laboratory which subsequently germinated after 52 days incubation. Of 60 packets distributed among 18 tree limb sites, one packet – harboring seeds of E. amphistomum affixed to pop ash (Fraxinus caroliniana Mill.) on a moss substrate – harbored <b>protocorms</b> after 267 days.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The asymbiotic {{technique}} of orchid seeds germination {{is an important}} method of mass production of seedlings.

30|$|In nature, the {{establishment}} of orchid seedlings requires compatible fungi to colonize the seed, thus providing nutrients {{for the formation of}} a <b>protocorm.</b> The <b>protocorm</b> is a post-embryonic structure from which both shoot and root systems subsequently differentiate.

30|$|Although the {{formation}} of a <b>protocorm</b> leading to plantlet formation is a continuous developmental process, for the ease of description and discussion between studies, {{the author would like to}} suggest that <b>protocorm</b> stage ends once a SAM is clearly established and the plantlet stage begins. After SAM formation, the <b>protocorm</b> can degenerate or enlarge forming a ‘corm-like’ structure, taking on varied forms (Veyret 1974; Batygina et al. 2003). The timing of root emergence also differs widely between species. Furthermore, the entire plantlet can remain subterranean for quite some time or elongate rapidly, emerges from the substratum and turns green (see Veyret 1974; Batygina and Andronova 2000; Batygina et al. 2003; Vinogradova and Andronova 2002).

30|$|In Caladenia tentaculata, the {{compatible}} fungal isolate always infects {{the seed}} through the suspensor, {{resulting in a}} successful mycorrhizal establishment in protocorms (Wright et al. 2005).
