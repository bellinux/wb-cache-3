40|$|A new sorbent, {{maleic acid}} grafted <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> <b>fiber</b> (MA-PTFE), was {{prepared}} and evaluated for on-line solid-phase extraction coupled with {{inductively coupled plasma}} mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) for fast, selective, and sensitive determination of (ultra) trace rare earth elements (REEs) in environmental samples. The REEs in aqueous samples at pH = 3. 0 were selectively extracted onto a microcolumn packed with the MA-PTFE fiber, and the adsorbed REEs were subsequently eluted on-line with 0. 9 mol l− 1 HNO 3 for ICP-MS determination. The new sorbent extraction system allows effective preconcentration and separation of the REEs from the major matrix constituents of alkali and alkali earth elements, particularly their separation from barium that produces considerable isobaric interferences of 134 Ba 16 O 1 H+, 135 Ba 16 O+, 136 Ba 16 O 1 H+, and 137 Ba 16 O+ on 151 Eu+ and 153 Eu+. With {{the use of a}} sample loading flow rate of 7. 4 ml min− 1 for 120 s preconcentration, enhancement factors of 69 – 97 and detection limits (3 s) of 1 – 20 pg l− 1 were achieved at a sample throughput of 22 samples h− 1. The precision (RSD) for 16 replicate determinations of 50 ng l− 1 of REEs was 0. 5 – 1. 1 %. The developed method was successfully applied to the determination of (ultra) trace REEs in sediment, soil, and seawater samples...|$|E

40|$|Expanded <b>poly(tetrafluoroethylene)</b> <b>fibers</b> were surface {{modified}} {{using an}} ultraviolet-activated mercury/ammonia reaction to yield amine-func tional {{groups for the}} coupling of laminin-derived cell adhesive peptides CYIGSR, CDPGYIGSR, CIKV A V, and CQAASIKV A V. a Surface elemental composition, determined by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and radiolabeling data indicated {{that the amount of}} peptide introduced was approxi mately equivalent regardless of peptide type, yet mixed peptide surfaces had- 60 % YIGSR and 40 % IKVA V. The peptide-modified surfaces were com pared in terms of the response of dorsal root gan glia with neurite length and number of cells attached to each fiber measured. All peptide functionalized surfaces had a greater cellular re sponse than the aminated ePTFE and ePTFE con trols. Surfaces modified with extended peptide sequences CDPGYIGSR and CQAASIKV A V dem onstrated a greater cellular response than those modified with the shorter peptide sequences CYIGSR and CIKV A V, respectively, likely because the extended peptides more closely mimic the three-dimensional conformation that the peptides maintain in laminin. Differences in neurite exten sion were evident among the peptide-function alized surfaces, with the longest neurites observe...|$|R
40|$|One of the {{promises}} of modern molecular biology has been the opportunity to use genetically modified human cells in a patient to permanently restore inborn errors of metabolism. Although it has been possible to introduce genes into mammalian cells and to control their expression, it has proven difficult to introduce mammalian cells as carriers of the modified genetic information into hosts. The successful implantation of selective cells cannot be achieved without adequate vascular support, an essential step toward integration and reconstitution of a new biological function. Although a partial {{solution to this problem}} has been found by inducing specific site-directed neovessel formation using heparin-binding growth factor 1 (HBGF- 1) adsorbed to a collagen matrix, these implants function for only a short period (weeks). We now report the formation of organoid neovascular structures using <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> <b>fibers</b> coated with collagen and HBGF- 1 implanted in the peritoneal cavity of the rat. The organoid structures contained readily visible vascular lumina and nonvascular structures that resemble nerve tissue. It was also possible to demonstrate that the vascular system on the implant is continuous with the vascular tree of the host. This feature was used to demonstrate that the organoid structures are capable of sustaining the biological function of implanted normal rat hepatocytes {{over long periods of time}} (months) in the homozygous Gunn rat, thereby facilitating future applications involving the delivery of new genetic information...|$|R

Timely use of EBR therapy may improve cardiovascular performance and prolong the survival time of endotoxemia sepsis in swine [15]. Nevertheless, {{the difficulties in}} large animal experiments keep its elucidation insufficient. Therefore, we established a miniature EBR system for septic rats to study the therapeutic effects and possible mechanisms of this endothelial cell-based therapy.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effect of}} various surface modifications, in {{conjunction}} with the intrinsic surface features of expanded <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (ePTFE) <b>fibers</b> on endothelialization, were investigated. A multi-step surface modification strategy was applied to commercial ePTFE sutures and then the effect of surface topography and surface chemistry involving cell adhesive and cell-resistant molecules was evaluated towards endothelial cell adhesion and its spreading. N-hepthylamine plasma polymer (HApp) was deposited onto the ePTFE fiber surface and then carboxy-methyl-dextran (CMD) was covalently attached. Subsequently, GRGDS and GRGES peptides were covalently grafted onto the CMD graft layer. The micrometric and nanometric features of ePTFE were qualitatively examined by atomic force microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy. Human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs) were used to evaluate the in vitro cell adhesion on nonmodified fibers and the multi-step surface coatings. Cell adhesive molecules (HApp and RGD) enhanced the cell adhesion while cell-resistant molecules (CMD and RGE) and nonmodified fibers resisted cell adhesion. Therefore, only surface features have no effect on the HUVEC adhesion and that the surface chemistry is dominant in modulating HUVEC adhesion on ePTFE fibers...|$|R
40|$|<b>Polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (PTFE) <b>fiber</b> was {{grafted with}} acrylic acid to impart the {{carboxyl}} groups onto the fiber surface, which {{were used to}} coordinate with both transition metal ions Fe(III) and Cu(II) and a rare metal ion Ce(III) to prepare the metal grafted PTFE fiber complexes as the novel heterogeneous Fenton catalysts for the degradation of the azo dye in water under visible irradiation. Some factors affecting the preparation process, such as nature and concentration of metal ions in the coordination solution, grafting degree of PTFE and reaction temperature were optimized {{with respect to the}} content and strength of metal fixation on the fiber and dye degradation efficiency. The results indicated that increasing metal ion concentrations in solution and grafting degree of PTFE fiber as well as higher coordination temperature led to a significant increase in metal content, especially Fe(III) and Cu(II) content of the complexes. Fe(III) ions fixed on the fiber showed the better catalytic performance than Cu(II) and Ce(III) ions fixed when three different complexes with similar metal content being employed, respectively. Moreover, Increasing Fe content or incorporation of Cu(II) ions could significantly improve the catalytic activity of the complexes...|$|R
40|$|Cu-Fe {{bimetallic}} grafted <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (PTFE) <b>fiber</b> complexes {{were prepared}} and optimized as the novel heterogeneous Fenton catalysts for {{the degradation of}} reactive dyes under UV irradiation. Cotton fabrics were dyed with three reactive dyes, namely, Reactive Red 195, Reactive Yellow 145, and Reactive Blue 222, in tap fresh water using exhaustion process. The spent dyeing effluents were then collected and degraded with the optimized Cu-Fe bimetallic grafted PTFE fiber complex/H 2 O 2 system. The treated dyeing effluents were characterized and reused for the dyeing of cotton fabrics through the same process. The effect of reuse process number on quality of the dyed cotton fabrics was examined. The {{results indicated that the}} Cu-Fe bimetallic modified PTFE fiber complex with a Cu/Fe molar ratio of 2. 87 was found to be the most effective fibrous catalyst, which enhanced complete decolorization of the treated dyeing effluents with H 2 O 2 in 4 [*]h. However, the TOC removal for the treated dyeing effluents was below 80 %. The dyeing quality was not affected for three successive cycles. The increase in residual TOC value influences fourth dyeing cycle. Further TOC reduction of the treated effluents is needed for its repeated reuse in more than three dyeing cycles...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{separation}} of acetone–butanol–ethanol mixtures (ABE) from aqueous solutions, which are produced in ABE fermentation processes, {{is carried out}} by sweep gas pervaporation using gelled supported ionic liquid membranes and by membrane evaporation. The membranes were synthesized by the gelation of an ionic liquid ([bmim][PF 6]) into the porosity of <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (PTFE) hollow <b>fibers.</b> The performance of the membranes used in sweep gas pervaporation is compared with the membrane evaporation process using the same hollow fiber support without IL in order to verify the selectivity contributed by the gelled ionic liquid gap formed in the membrane pores. Improved butanol/ethanol selectivity was verified for gelled IL membranes in pervaporation experiments compared to the evaporation process. A resistance-in-series model was developed to simulate the pervaporation process. The model predictions were in good agreement with the experimental results. IL membranes are found to have potential for {{separation of}} butanol from the ABE mixtures by pervaporation...|$|R
40|$|AbstractA {{membrane}} contactor based desorption process {{was developed to}} strip carbon dioxide (CO 2) from loaded monoethalamine (MEA) solution. Nitrogen (N 2) gas {{was used as a}} stripping gas instead of steam in a conventional column. <b>Polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (PTFE) hollow <b>fiber</b> membranes were used to test the desorption performance. The liquid solution was fed in the lumen while the stripping gas was fed through the shell side. The stripping gas, liquid velocities, operating temperature, and MEA concentration were all investigated for their effect on CO 2 desorption flux. It was found that the CO 2 desorption flux was relatively constant with an increase stripping gas velocity while the liquid velocity, operating temperature, and solution concentration could enhance CO 2 desorption flux in the {{membrane contactor}} based desorption process. However, an increase the solution concentration to 5  kmol m 3 resulted in a decrease in the CO 2 desorption flux due to the effect of viscosity...|$|R
40|$|The National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{has led the}} {{development}} of unique flame retardant fibers for the specific requirements of different space programs. Three of these fibers have greatly contributed {{to the safety of}} all the space missions since the Apollo program. Beta alumina-silica microfiber developed for the outer layer of the space suit after the Apollo 1 fire is no longer used and has been replaced by other glass <b>fibers.</b> Expanded <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (e-PTFE) <b>fiber</b> used in the current spacesuit is mostly known today through its trade mark Gore-Tex. Polybenzimidazole (PBI) filament fiber used in many applications from the Apollo to the Space Shuttle program is no longer available. More recently, TOR"TM" copolymer of polyimide fiber developed during the space shuttle program to resist the atomic oxygen present in Low Earth Orbit has been barely used. The high cost and narrow range of aeronautical and aerospace applications have, however, led to a limited production of these fibers. Only fibers that found niche markets survived. Yet, deep space exploration will require more of these inherently flame retardant fibers than what is available today. There is a need for new flame retardant fabrics inside the space vehicles as well as a need for logistics reduction for long term space missions. Materials like modacrylic and polyimide are good candidates for future flame retardant aerospace fabrics. New fabrics must be developed for astronauts' clothing, as well as crew quarters and habitat.

40|$|A facile {{one-step}} {{process was}} developed to generate hydrophilic coating on <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (PTFE) hollow <b>fiber</b> membranes based on co-deposition of polymerized dopamine (PDA) and poly (ethyleneimine) (PEI) from aqueous solutions. For comparison, step-by-step coating of PDA and PEI was also applied to modify PTFE membranes. ATR-FTIR, XPS, SEM, AFM and water contact angle measurements were applied to analyze the surface chemistry and morphology evolution of the modified PTFE membranes at varied grafting yields. PDA and PEI were successfully deposited on PTFE membranes while the hydrophilicity and wettability of the modified membrane were greatly improved. The modified PTFE membranes showed high water permeate fluxes, good longterm stability and durability in strong acidic aqueous solution. Although NEE, hollow fiber membranes samples modified by a step-by-step dip-coating process with PDA and PEI tent to lose their hydrophilicity in strong alkaline solutions, the co-deposited PTFE membranes with PDA and PEI {{were found to have}} good durability in aqueous solution at pH 13. This work provides a one-step method to improve the hydrophilicity and chemical stability of the PTFE hollow fiber membranes for water treatment applications. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Porous {{asymmetric}} {{polyvinylidene fluoride}} (PVDF) and polysulfone (PSF) hollow fiber membranes were structurally developed to improve gas permeability, wetting resistance {{and carbon dioxide}} (CO 2) absorption flux. The membranes were prepared via a wet phase-inversion process and used in gas-liquid membrane contactors for CO 2 absorption. Phase-inversion behavior of the polymer solutions was studied by plotting the ternary phase diagrams of polymer/solventadditive/ water. The effect of different non-solvent additives on the structure and performance of the PVDF and PSF membranes was investigated. The membranes structure was examined in terms of gas permeation, critical water entry pressure (CEPw), collapsing pressure, overall porosity, contact angle, mass transfer resistance and field emission scanning electronic microscopy (FESEM). The CO 2 absorption performance of the membranes was investigated and compared with the commercial polypropylene (PP) and <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (PTFE) hollow <b>fiber</b> membranes. In addition, the effect of different operating conditions on the physical and chemical CO 2 flux of the PVDF membrane was also investigated. The {{results showed that the}} PSF membranes have a thicker skin layer with smaller pore sizes and lower surface porosity compared to the PVDF membranes. The PVDF membranes demonstrated low mass transfer resistance and high wetting resistance. Therefore, the hydrophobic PVDF membranes indicated an improved structure, which considerably increased the CO 2 flux compared to the PSF membranes and symmetric PP and PTFE commercial membranes. A maximum CO 2 flux of 8. 20 × 10 - 4 mol. /m 2. s was achieved at the absorbent flow rate of 310 ml/min, which was approximately 110 % higher than CO 2 flux of the PTFE membrane at the same operating conditions. In case of physical absorption with distilled water, {{a significant increase in the}} CO 2 flux was observed as the pressure increased and the temperature decreased. However, in the case of chemical absorption with 1 M sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution, the CO 2 flux was significantly increased by increasing temperature, where the reaction rate was dominant. Moreover, it was found that the operation remains stable at the same gas and liquid pressure without bubble formation in the liquid phase when the liquid contacts the skin layer of the membrane. Results of the long-term study demonstrated that after a certain initial CO 2 flux reduction the membrane performance maintained constant over 150 h operation. Therefore, it can be concluded that the porous hydrophobic membrane with developed structure can be a promising alternative for CO 2 removal from the gas stream...|$|R
