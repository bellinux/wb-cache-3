40|$|Aims and objectives: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} an educational intervention programme on improving paediatric nurses’ competencies in performing adolescent healthcare practice in central China. Background: The WHO Adolescent Health Framework was integrated into this training programme {{to examine the effects}} of educational interventions on the competencies of <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> in promoting adolescent healthcare. This study is one of the first in central China to evaluate paediatric nurses’ competencies in promoting adolescent health. Design: The study used a mixed-method design with a quasi-experimental approach and focus group interviews. Methods: The study was conducted with 57 <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> from 28 institutes and hospitals in central China in 2010 to {{evaluate the}}ir competencies in adolescent health and development, specifically with regard to conducting needs assessments, planning effective interventions and evaluating outcome measures. The <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> received training and were assessed by individual and group work during the structured three-week programme. Data were collected before and after the training programme as pre- and post-tests. The researchers gathered information about their experiences by conducting focus group interviews. Results: The <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> demonstrated significant improvements in their adolescent healthcare practice after attending the three-week structured training programme. The post-test scores had significant effects on the dimensions of the adolescent healthcare practice competency checklist. The qualitative data also showed positive and encouraging experiences and feedback from the <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> in this study. Conclusion: The findings suggest that an educational intervention can change knowledge, attitudes and practice among <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> in adolescent healthcare. All the <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> in this study demonstrated increased competencies in carrying out adolescent healthcare practice after participating in the three-week intensive intervention programme. Relevance to clinical practice: This study showed that <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> have an important role in promoting and coordinating adolescent healthcare practice in primary healthcare practice.

Methods A cross-sectional approach was used to compare a sample of general and <b>paediatric</b> <b>nursing</b> students enrolled in a university in northeast Italy. We administered a questionnaire that covered socio-demographic characteristics and included an instrument of motivation developed by Zysberg & Berry (2005) to 224 students enrolled in the three-year classes. Results We analysed 215 questionnaires (96 %). <b>Paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> were generally younger, had attended a college preparatory high school and had previously failed another university programme. Many students, in both groups, had a relative who was a nurse, or had cared for a sick friend or family member. Students did not vary significantly in how they evaluated items included in the questionnaire. Conclusion A career in nursing should be advised for students who are motivated to help other people. Pediatric nursing was identified as an acceptable career choice by students of college preparatory high schools or by students who had initially enrolled in a different university programme. General nursing was a satisfactory choice by students with previous work experience...|$|R
40|$|Background Obesity is a {{significant}} public health issue causing many ill-effects. Arguably nurses should be advocates and role models for healthy eating promotion as part of obesity prevention. However, there is limited research available relating specifically to <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> as health promoters, their promotion of healthy eating or their attitudes towards being role models for health behaviours. Objectives To investigate paediatric nurses’ attitudes towards the promotion of healthy eating in children and their families. To investigate whether personal health factors (in this case body weight) of <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> has any influence on their attitudes towards the promotion of healthy eating in children and their families. Method A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted across the paediatric wards and departments at Nottingham University Hospitals NHS Trust. The questionnaire assessed participants’ attitudes towards <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> being role models for health promotion and towards the promotion of healthy eating to children and families, including their self-efficacy as a factor within this. Findings The main {{findings of this study}} were that participants’ attitudes towards healthy eating promotion and <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> as role models were not always consistent with their actions. Self-efficacy and a disagreement regarding whose responsibility health promotion was were further factors affecting participants’ attitudes. Although many participants felt that they could improve their health promotional practices, their knowledge of healthy eating, and their own health behaviours need to be significantly improved first. Conclusions A qualitative study would allow for further exploration of paediatric nurses’ attitudes towards the promotion of healthy eating in children and their families. Furthermore, with more time and resources, a study could be carried out in multiple centres so as to gain a wider understanding of attitudes, as well as producing results that can be better generalised to <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> as a whole population...|$|R

40|$|Background: Family-centred care (FCC) {{is a way}} {{of caring}} for {{children}} and their families within health services which ensures that care is planned around the whole family, not just the individual person, and in which all the family members are recognised as care recipients. In general, FCC emphasises the dynamic relationship between the family, the sick child and the health care providers to maintain the normality of the family’s life and to reduce the emotional stress for the sick child. Aims: studies that have examined nurses’ perceptions and practices of FCC have been mainly conducted in western countries. Little is known about perceptions and practices of FCC of <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> working in non-westernised countries. Thus this study is undertaken to explore FCC in the Saudi context from the perspectives of <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> and families. Design: a mixed methodology was utilised using explanatory sequential design. In the quantitative phase a convenience sample of 234 nurses and 101 family members were recruited and closed-ended questionnaires were administered. Participants were recruited from six hospitals in Jeddah city in Saudi Arabia. The qualitative phase involved 140 hours of non-participant observation for <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> in their practice and 10 face-to-face semi-structured interviews with them in one hospital. Results: the results of the quantitative phase showed that <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> generally believed that the identified elements of FCC are necessary to practise FCC. Nurses believed that they were implementing FCC elements in their current practice; however, there were statistically significant differences between their practices and perceptions of FCC elements. These results contrasted with families’ results that showed families were not satisfied with their current experience of the implementation of FCC. The qualitative results of observation data supported what has been identified in the quantitative phase. It agreed that the practice of FCC by <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> was limited. Indeed, the practice of nurses revealed that several elements of FCC were not consistently implemented. The results of the interviews showed that <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> had limited and superficial understanding of what FCC means as a model of care. This illuminates how their limited understanding of FCC reflected on their practice. However, they were in common agreement on the importance of families during hospitalisation and the significant role they play. Conclusion: <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> based in Saudi generally had a limited knowledge of the theoretical concepts underpinning FCC and they did not consistently implement FCC elements in their everyday practice. Saudi based families’ responses indicated awareness about the importance of FCC; however, they were less than satisfied with FCC provision, and indicated there is considerable scope for improvement. This study was seen as significant in filling the gap in literature by identifying the contemporary status of FCC in Saudi Arabia. Secondly, it provides the necessary insights into how <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurses</b> understand and practise FCC in the Saudi context. Its original contribution is two- fold. This research illuminates the application of FCC in a non-western country, a first at this level of depth; while the particular design application of mixed methods will be of interest to the research community...|$|R

40|$|Current state: Congenital {{cataract}} is an ophthalmic disorder {{where the}} clouding {{of the lens}} causes defect in its transparency and light dispersion. The child experiences a visual impairment that can be examinated depending on the age and mental state of the child. The treatment is removal of the clouded lens, subsequent correction of dioptric defects and subsequent training and monitoring of amblyopia. Purpose: {{of this study was}} to describe the roles of <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurse</b> in nursing care of children with congenital cataract and the specifics in nursing care in this condition, based on reviewed material. The following research problems were explored: What are the roles of <b>paediatric</b> <b>nurse</b> in nursing care of children with congenital cataract? What are the specifics in nursing care of children with congenital cataract? Methods: In order to reach the goal set by this study we used qualitative data and study analysis.
