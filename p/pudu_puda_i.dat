Ten percent of the animals were seropositive {{to one or more}} serovars. Seroprevalence was significantly higher in ungulates (20. 4 %) compared to carnivores (3. 8 %) and primates (3. 4 %). There {{were no significant differences in}} seroprevalence among sex and age ranges. The most frequent serovar detected was Autumnalis, present in 53. 4 % of antibody-positive animals. Most positive animals had titers of <= 1 : 200, except for a maned wolf (Chrysocyon brachyurus) with titers of 1 : 400 against serovar Hardjo. To the authors' knowledge, this is the first report of Leptospira exposure detected in native endangered <b>pudu</b> (<b>Pudu</b> <b>puda)</b> and the first confirmation of exposure to L. interrogans in captive wild mammals in Chile.

40|$|ABSTRACTMycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis (Map) is the {{etiological}} {{agent of}} paratuberculosis. In Chile, information about Map isolation from both domestic ruminant and wildlife species has been accumulating, {{but it has}} to be extended to other species. The present study focuses specifically on one wild grazing species, the <b>pudu</b> (<b>Pudu</b> <b>puda),</b> one of the less known South American deer considered an endangered species that shares pastures with cattle in southern Chile, where the greatest part of the country's dairy cattle population is located. Convenient samples from 3 pudus were collected from one dairy farm where Map infection had previously been confirmed in cattle. All three pudus shed the bacterium in feces and the isolates are the same type of Map as described for cattle. This study represents the first case report of Map isolation in the pudu captured from the wild. It is also the first documented association between a Map-infected dairy herd and free-ranging wildlife species, such as pudu in the Los Ríos region, Chile. Since interspecies transmission of Map and other pathogens from livestock to pudu has already been demonstrated, the results from this study suggest that this free-ranging wildlife specie, inhabiting a dairy district in southern Chile, might represent another case of spillover host...|$|R

40|$|Correspondence between the {{habitat of}} the {{threatened}} pudú (Cervidae) and the national protected‑area system of Chile Melissa Pavez‑Fox 1, 2 * and Sergio A. Estay 1, 3 Background: Currently, many species are facing serious conservation problems due to habitat loss. The {{impact of the}} potential loss of biodiversity associated with habitat loss is difficult to measure. This is particularly the case with inconspicuous species such as the threatened <b>pudú</b> (<b>Pudu</b> <b>puda),</b> an endemic Cervidae of temperate forests of Chile and Argentina. To {{evaluate the effectiveness of}} the Chilean protected‑area system in protecting the habitat of the pudú, we measured the congruence between this specie’s potential distribution and the geographical area occupied by the protected areas in central and southern Chile. The measurements of congruency were made using the Maxent modeling method. Results: The potential habitat of the pudú was found to be poorly represented in the system (3 – 8 %) and even the most suitable areas for the species are not currenly protected. According to these results, the protected area network cannot be considered as a key component of the conservation strategy for this species. Conclusions: The results presented here also serve as a guide for the reevaluation of current pudú conservation strategies, for the design of new field studies to detect the presence of this species in human‑disturbed areas or remaining patches of native forest, and for the implementation of corridors to maximize the success of conservation efforts...|$|R

The {{southern}} <b>Pudu</b> (<b>Pudu</b> <b>puda)</b> is a cervid species {{which has}} been classified as vulnerable by the IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature). In this context, {{it is essential to}} develop semen collection methods and cryopreservation protocols in order to keep sperm samples for conservation purposes. The aim of this work was to study the effect of two sperm collection methods (electroejaculation (EE) vs. rectal massage (RM)) and two glycerol concentrations (3 % vs. 6 %) on sperm quality after cryopreservation procedure. Semen from six adult males was obtained by EE and RM. Then, each sperm sample was split into two aliquots, being one of them diluted with Tris medium+ 3 % of glycerol and the other one with Tris medium+ 6 % of glycerol and subsequently frozen. Sperm motility, viability and acrosomal integrity were assessed after collection, before cryopreservation, at thawing and after 2 h of incubation. A GLMANOVA was carried out and differences were considered significant when p ≤ 0. 05. There were not differences between both sperm collection methods studied. However, when we assessed glycerol concentrations for each collection methods we observed higher significant sperm viability, motility and spermatozoa with intact acrosome (p ≤ 0. 05) for 3 % of glycerol compared to 6 % after 2 h of incubation. In conclusion, sperm samples from Pudu can be successfully collected by EE or RM and cryopreserved with an extender containing 3 % of glycerol. Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|A {{study of}} {{southern}} <b>pudu</b> (<b>Pudu</b> <b>puda)</b> was {{performed at the}} zoo Nordens Ark in Bohuslän, Sweden during twelve days in Mars and April 2014. Observations were performed during twilight. Time budget and enclosure use was examined, when the animals {{had access to the}} whole enclosure of 1000 m 2 or a smaller part of the enclosure of 200 m 2. There was almost no difference in time budget between the two enclosure sizes. At both enclosure sizes the animals spent most of the time at a place that was hidden from outside the enclosure. The hidden place was situated in the house. Also {{the rest of the house}} was a place where the animals spent a lot of time. The big enclosure part, the part of the enclosure that the animals did not have access to in the 200 m 2 enclosure, was more rocky and hilly, which might have been features the animals preferred. Another reason to the preference of the big enclosure part might have been that the animals didn’t have access to that part of the enclosure the whole time and therefor found it more exciting. The three small shelters in the enclosure were seldom used. The shelter that was used the most was located in the part of the enclosure the animals didn’t have access to when they were in the small enclosure. The pudus seemed to be affected by not always having access to the whole enclosure, but additional observations are desired to ensure chance didn’t impact on the results. In the future it would be interesting to do a follow-up to study the animals at different times of the day. It would also be interesting to study enrichments to see if the animals would like to spend more time in other places than the house if the rest of the enclosure was enriched...|$|R

The {{aim of the}} current study was to investigate the morphometric characteristics of Pudú sperm heads as a basis for future studies on the relationship between sperm quality and cryopreservation. Semen from nine adult males obtained by electroejaculation was used. A total of 3152 properly digitized sperm head were analyzed by means of the Sperm-Class Analyzer (SCA©; Microoptic, Barcelona, Spain). Descriptive statistics of the whole sperm population were calculated to characterize Pudú spermatozoa. The mean values +/- SD for the measures of sperm head dimensions were 9. 41 +/- 0. 49 lm for lenght, 37. 45 +/- 3. 55 lm 3 for area, 25. 87 +/- 1. 57 lm for perimeter and 1. 42 +/- 0. 08 for p 2 a. The shape factor p 2 a compares the perimeter of an object to its area and takes a minimum value of 1 for a circle, increasing when the shape differs from it. Area and perimeter showed a large degree of variation between individuals (ranges, 27. 16 – 59. 21 lm 3 and 21. 25 – 34. 05 lm, respectively). However, length and p 2 a were consistently maintained between males (ranges 7. 88 – 11. 73 lm and 1. 22 – 2. 11, respectively). Future studies should be conducted to evaluate the sperm head morphometry after cryopreservation assessing the behavior of the different males to achieve efficient sperm cryopreservation protocols that help to conserve this cervid species.

40|$|Domestic {{dogs are}} the most {{abundant}} carnivores worldwide. Food and other subsidies to dogs do not prevent their predation on wildlife. Dog impacts on wildlife are suspected to be significant, yet the nature of dog-wildlife interactions is not fully understood. In this context I addressed three specific objectives. First, I tested {{the hypothesis that the}} distribution of dogs influences the space use of potential prey. This hypothesis was tested using as target species the southern <b>pudu</b> (<b>Pudu</b> <b>puda),</b> a globally vulnerable deer. Second, I tested the hypothesis that the management of domestic dogs and cats influences their impacts on wild vertebrates. Third, I assessed whether dogs are a global concern for biodiversity conservation by conducting a broad literatura review. The study conducted on pudus in Chile revealed that dogs are frequent and efficient predators of this species. In occupancy models applied to camera-trap data, the variable that best explained the distribution of pudus was the probability of dog presence. The second study, confirmad that domestic dogs preyed on most threatened mammals present in two sites. My results provided support for the hypothesis that the less ca re domestic animals receive from owners the higher the probability those animals will prey on wildlife. Finally, the literature review showed that dogs are considered a threat for 160 mammalian species. These numbers are very similar to those observed for feral cats, one of the most damaging invasive species worldwide. The review al so revealed that the few studies on the spatial consequences of the presence of dogs converge in suggesting that they are a threat for groups such as Carnivores and Artiodactyls. M y findings suggest that dogs are efficient predators for species such as the pudu, and that these predation events may have consequences for the distribution of these species. Considering the potentially large number of species affected by dogs, {{and the fact that the}} impacts of dogs depend especially on human factors, I discuss the role of dog management to reduce their impacts...|$|R
40|$|The {{taxonomy}} of American deer {{has been established}} almost entirely {{on the basis of}} morphological data and without the use of explicit phylogenetic methods; hence, phylogenetic analyses including data for all of the currently recognized species, even if based on a single gene, might improve current understanding of their taxonomy. We tested the monophyly of the morphology-defined genera and species of New World deer (Odocoileini) with phylogenetic analyses of mitochondrial DNA sequences. This is the first such test conducted using extensive geographic and taxonomic sampling. Our results do not support the monophyly of Mazama, Odocoileus, Pudu, M. americana, M. nemorivaga, Od. hemionus, and Od. virginianus. Mazama contains species that belong to other genera. We found a novel sister-taxon relationship between “Mazama” pandora and a clade formed by Od. hemionus columbianus and Od. h. sitkensis, and transfer pandora to Odocoileus. The clade formed by Od. h. columbianus and Od. h. sitkensis may represent a valid species, whereas the remaining subspecies of Od. hemionus appear closer to Od. virginianus. <b>Pudu</b> (<b>Pudu)</b> <b>puda</b> was not found sister to Pudu (Pudella) mephistophiles. If confirmed, this result will prompt the recognition of the monotypic Pudella as a distinct genus. We provide evidence for the existence of an undescribed species now confused with Mazama americana, and identify other instances of cryptic, taxonomically unrecognized species-level diversity among populations here regarded as Mazama temama, “Mazama” nemorivaga, and Hippocamelus antisensis. Noteworthy records that substantially extend the known distributions of M. temama and “M. ” gouazoubira are provided, and we unveil a surprising ambiguity regarding the distribution of “M. ” nemorivaga, as it is described in the literature. The study of deer of the tribe Odocoileini has been hampered by the paucity of information regarding voucher specimens and the provenance of sequences deposited in GenBank. We pinpoint priorities for future systematic research on the tribe Odocoileini. Eliécer E. Gutiérrez, Kristofer M. Helgen, Molly M. McDonough, Franziska Bauer, Melissa T. R. Hawkins, Luis A.

50|$|Molecular dating {{suggests}} that the family Cervidae originated and radiated in central Asia during the Late Miocene, and that the Odocoileini dispersed to North America during the Miocene/Pliocene boundary, and underwent an adaptive radiation in South America after their Pliocene dispersal across the Isthmus of Panama. According to the systematic relationships and evolutionary history of Neotropical deer, at least eight ancestral forms of deer invaded South America during the late Pliocene (2.5-3 Mya), {{and members of the}} red brockets had an independent early explosive diversification soon after their ancestor arrived there, giving rise to a number of morphologically cryptic species. Deer endemic to the New World fall in two biogeographic lineages: the first one groups Odocoileus and Mazama americana is distributed in North, Central, and South America, whereas the second one is composed of South American species only and includes Mazama gouazoubira. This implies that the genus Mazama is not a valid taxon. Genetic analysis revealed high levels of molecular and cytogenetic divergence between groups of morphologically similar species of brockets (Mazama), and suggest a polyphyletic origin. In particular, M. americana showed a striking relationship with several sequences of Odocoileus in contrast to that expected, since this M. americana (now M. temama) haplotype, from a Mexican origin, was not associated with several Bolivian Mazama sequences analyzed. This could put forward that this genera is not monophyletic. However, these Bolivian Mazama species formed a clade with <b>Pudu</b> <b>puda</b> and Ozotoceros bezoarticus. Likely, an Odocoileus virginianus sequence from the central area of Colombia showed a stronger relationship with a North American O. heminonus sequence than with the other O. virginianus sequences of Colombian origin, as well. This could be explained by various hypotheses. The first is the existence of common ancestral haplotypes between both species. Another is the reiterative hybridization among both Odocoileus species before the migration of O. virginianus from North America to South America.|$|R

40|$|Numerous deer {{species have}} been {{introduced}} beyond their native range into ecosystems around the world. Their economic value leads to further accidental and deliberate releases and lack of control is contributing to range expansion in Australia, South America and Europe. Despite localised or regional concern, the scale and generality of detrimental impacts have not been widely recognised. We review the direct and indirect impacts on ecosystems and evidence for interspecific effects on native deer. In New Zealand, where large herbivores were previously absent, severe and novel impacts {{have been found in}} susceptible forests. Even where ecosystems contain native deer, invasion by taxonomically exotic deer species carries the risk of cascade effects on spatial plant dynamics and forest composition. In Patagonia, introduced deer have disrupted forest composition, whereas in Europe, ecosystem impacts of introduced species can differ from those of over-abundant native deer. Introduced Chinese muntjac (Muntiacus reevesi) within a coniferous forestry landscape in eastern England differ from native European roe deer (Capreolus capreolus) in their distribution of herbivory among differing habitats, and provide much lower rates of endozoochorous seed dispersal. Frequent concern is expressed that introduced deer species may have detrimental effects on native deer and other ungulates, although potential epidemiological effects have not been investigated. Apparent competition, with introduced prey resulting in increased predation rates on native deer, may be occurring between South American huemul (Hippocamelus bisulcus) and southern <b>pudu</b> (<b>Pudu</b> <b>puda).</b> Habitat and dietary overlap is often substantial among native and introduced ungulates, including deer, and exploitation competition is likely. Evidence includes spatial responses of native to non-native deer and negatively correlated changes in population abundance, but demographic mechanisms have not been demonstrated previously. In a coniferous forestry landscape in eastern England, substantial habitat and dietary overlap occurs between native roe deer and high-density introduced Chinese muntjac. This roe deer population has shown a reduction in body weight and fertility following establishment and increasing abundance of non-native Chinese muntjac, compatible with interspecific competition. European roe deer also appear susceptible to competition from larger grazing deer, including native red deer (Cervus elaphus) and introduced fallow (Dama dama). The widely introduced fallow deer may be a particularly effective competitor in sympatry with intermediate or concentrate feeders. There is need for further investigation of potential interactions of introduced and native deer species, and a wider recognition of the ecological impacts of introduced deer...|$|R
