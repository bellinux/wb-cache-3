500|$|One {{threshold}} {{question in}} the Fourth Amendment jurisprudence is whether a [...] "search" [...] has occurred. Initial Fourth Amendment case law hinged on [...] a citizen's property rights—that is, when the government physically intrudes on [...] "persons, houses, papers, or effects" [...] {{for the purpose of}} obtaining information, a [...] "search" [...] within the original meaning of the Fourth Amendment has occurred. Early 20th-century Court decisions, such as Olmstead v. United States (1928), held that Fourth Amendment rights applied in cases of <b>physical</b> <b>intrusion,</b> but not to other forms of police surveillance (e.g., wiretaps). In Silverman v.

500|$|Having {{reached the}} {{conclusion}} {{that this was a}} search under the Fourth Amendment, the Court declined to examine whether any exception exists that would render the search [...] "reasonable", because the Government had failed to advance that alternate theory in the lower courts. [...] Also left unanswered was the broader question surrounding the privacy implications of a warrantless use of GPS data absent a <b>physical</b> <b>intrusion</b> – as might occur, for example, with the electronic collection of GPS data from wireless service providers or factory-installed vehicle tracking and navigation services. [...] The Court left this to be decided in some future case, saying, [...] "It may be that achieving the same result through electronic means, without an accompanying trespass, is an unconstitutional invasion of privacy, but the present case does not require us to answer that question." ...|$|E
500|$|Under the Fourth Amendment, {{search and}} seizure (including arrest) should be limited in scope {{according}} to specific information supplied to the issuing court, usually by a law enforcement officer who has sworn by it. Fourth Amendment case law deals with three central questions: what government activities constitute [...] "search" [...] and [...] "seizure"; what constitutes probable cause for these actions; and how violations of Fourth Amendment rights should be addressed. Early court decisions limited the amendment's scope to a law enforcement officer's <b>physical</b> <b>intrusion</b> onto private property, but with Katz v. United States (1967), the Supreme Court held that its protections, such as the warrant requirement, extend to the privacy of individuals {{as well as physical}} locations. Law enforcement officers need a warrant for most {{search and seizure}} activities, but the Court has defined a series of exceptions for consent searches, motor vehicle searches, evidence in plain view, exigent circumstances, border searches, and other situations.|$|E

Both paintings depict English rural scenes, the innocence of which is disturbed by subtle but profoundly threatening violations of natural harmony. In Hunt's painting, the shepherd ignores his flock of sheep, who wander over a ditch into a wheat field. This violation of boundaries is paralleled by the shepherd's <b>physical</b> <b>intrusions</b> into the personal space of the young woman, who responds in an ambiguous way that might be interpreted as complicity or as a knowing scepticism.

40|$|Children have a {{constitutional}} right to bodily integrity. Courts do not hesitate to vindicate that right when children are abused by state actors. Moreover, in at least some cases, a child’s right to bodily integrity applies within the family, giving the child the right to avoid unwanted <b>physical</b> <b>intrusions</b> regardless of the parents’ wishes. Nonetheless, the scope of this right vis-à-vis the parents is unclear; {{the extent to which it}} applies beyond the narrow context of abortion and contraception has been almost entirely unexplored and untheorized. This Article is the first in the legal literature to analyze the constitutional right of minors to bodily integrity within the family by spanning traditionally disparate doctrinal categories such as abortion rights; corporal punishment; medical decisionmaking; and nontherapeutic physical interventions such as tattooing, piercing, and circumcision. However, the constitutional right of minors to bodily integrity raises complex philosophical questions concerning the proper relationship between family and state, as well as difficult doctrinal and theoretical issues concerning the ever-murky idea of state action. This Article canvasses those issues with the ultimate goal of delineating {{a constitutional}} right of bodily security and autonomy for children...|$|R
500|$|Fourth Amendment protections {{expanded}} {{significantly with}} Katz v. United States (1967). In Katz, the Supreme Court expanded that focus to embrace an individual's right to privacy, and {{ruled that a}} search had occurred when the government wiretapped a telephone booth using a microphone attached {{to the outside of}} the glass. While there was no <b>physical</b> <b>intrusion</b> into the booth, the Court reasoned that: 1) Katz, by entering the booth and shutting the door behind him, had exhibited his expectation that [...] "the words he utters into the mouthpiece will not be broadcast to the world"; and 2) society believes that his expectation was reasonable. Justice Potter Stewart wrote in the majority opinion that [...] "the Fourth Amendment protects people, not places". A [...] "search" [...] occurs for purposes of the Fourth Amendment when the government violates a person's [...] "reasonable expectation of privacy." [...] Katz's reasonable expectation of privacy thus provided the basis to rule that the government's intrusion, though electronic rather than physical, was a search covered by the Fourth Amendment, and thus necessitated a warrant. The Court said that it was not recognizing any general right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment, and that this wiretap could have been authorized if proper procedures had been followed.|$|E
500|$|Justice Antonin Scalia {{authored}} {{the majority}} opinion. He cited {{a line of}} cases dating {{back as far as}} 1886 to argue that a <b>physical</b> <b>intrusion,</b> or trespass, into a constitutionally-protected area – in an attempt to find something or to obtain information – was the basis, historically, for determining whether a [...] "search" [...] had occurred under the meaning of the Fourth Amendment. [...] Scalia conceded that in the years following Katz v. United States (1967) – in which electronic eavesdropping on a public telephone booth was held to be a search – the vast majority of search and seizure case law has shifted away from that approach founded on property rights, and towards an approach based on a person's [...] "expectation of privacy". However, he cited a number of post-Katz cases including Alderman v. United States and Soldal v. Cook County to argue that the trespassory approach had not been abandoned by the Court. In response to criticisms within Alito's concurrence, Scalia emphasized that the Fourth Amendment must provide, at a minimum, the level of protection as it did when it was adopted. [...] Furthermore, a trespassory test need not exclude a test of the expectation of privacy, which may be appropriate to consider in situations where there was no governmental trespass.|$|E

40|$|The {{production}} of numerical STM images of large-scale molecular systems is often {{limited to the}} use of low-level theory such as the Tersoff-Hamann (TH) approach [1]. A significant amount of STM features are revealed by such a representation of surface states that are obtained from electronic structure calculations, except that the influence of the tip is totally excluded. Electron scattering approach such as the Laudauer-Buttiker formula (LBF) [2] considers the influence of the tip, but can also considers electron-electron, electron-phonon, and several other inelastic scattering events [3]. Due to all these features, the LBF approach represents one of the most accurate models for generating STM images. Despite the high accuracy of such scattering approach, the associated computational complexity and effort needed to obtain STM images still constitute the major drawbacks of the LBF technique. Nevertheless, our recent development in parallel computing [4] and space discretization [5] in STM simulations open a route toward a next generation of real-time STM imaging. In addition, we are presently developing new software features where chemical and <b>physical</b> <b>intrusions</b> within the model framework can be performed.

40|$|Nonverbal {{behaviors}} of Hispanic {{elementary school students}} and their peers were examined in a small-group cooperative task {{with a total of}} 202 subjects. Thirty-five randomly selected groups were videotaped in ten desegregated schools, each group was gender-homogeneous, with three Hispanic and three Anglo students. Analysis of the videotapes revealed that Hispanic females used less vertical and horizontal space than Anglo females, and were also less likely to verbally interrupt or physically intrude on other group members They had similar rates of handling the group resource cards and were given similar leadership scores by multi-ethnic trained observers. Among males, Hispanics are significantly more likely to use vertical or upward movements and <b>physical</b> <b>intrusions,</b> while Anglos use more verbal interruptions. School and social status factors such as high- and low-equity desegregated school programs, ethnic and gender status, and school status variables of academic grades and English word knowledge had varying effects on teacher and peer ratings of leadership. High-equity schools garnered higher leadership scores for Hispanic females from both peers and teachers when all other nonverbal behaviors were controlled. This positive effect of the school on leadership ratings was evident only for males.

500|$|In the 1950s, the Supreme Court of the United States issued two key rulings {{clarifying}} {{the constitutionality of}} <b>physical</b> <b>intrusions</b> into the human body by police and other government agents. In Rochin v. California, police officers broke into the home of an individual suspected of selling narcotics and observed him place several small objects into his mouth. Officers were unable to force his mouth open, so they transported him to a local hospital where his stomach was pumped against his will. A unanimous Supreme Court held the involuntary stomach pump was an unlawful violation of substantive due process because it [...] "shocked the conscience", and was so [...] "brutal" [...] and [...] "offensive" [...] {{that it did not}} comport with traditional ideas of fair play and decency. In 1957, the Court held in Breithaupt v. Abram that involuntary blood samples [...] "taken by a skilled technician" [...] neither [...] "shocked the conscience" [...] nor violated substantive due process. In Breithaupt, police took a blood sample from a patient suspected of driving {{under the influence of alcohol}} while he lay unconscious in a hospital. The Court held that the blood samples were justified, in part, because [...] "modern community living requires modern scientific methods of crime detection." [...] Additionally, the Court mentioned in dicta that involuntary blood samples may violate the constitution if officers do not provide [...] "every proper medical precaution" [...] to the accused.|$|R

40|$|Invasive mammals include good tree climbers {{that use}} tree {{cavities}} for resting and nesting. Tree cavities are important but limited resources in most forests; thus, some invasive mammals can be serious competitors for native cavity-using species, especially cavity-nesting birds. Despite the potential impact, such inter-class competition {{has rarely been}} considered. We examined the possibility of resource competition for tree cavities between the invasive raccoon Procyon lotor and the native Ural owl Strix uralensis. Both species are nocturnal and use tree cavities during daytime. We assessed an overlap in cavity use for both species {{as an indication of}} potential competition by monitoring 341 cavities during their breeding season in a natural park in Hokkaido, Japan. Of 341 potentially available cavities, raccoons and Ural owls used 37 and 32, respectively. The characteristics of 58 cavities used by raccoons or owls were compared to 49 random cavities to determine if they selected cavities with certain characteristics. As predicted from a large amount of tree cavities and a low raccoon density in this managed forest, we did not find direct evidence of competition, such as <b>physical</b> interaction, <b>intrusion</b> to cavities, or habitat segregation. Cavity types used by both species overlapped considerably in terms of height, entrance size, depth, and other characteristics: their habitats were widely overlapped. Further, in four cavities, one species was replaced by the other. Given the similar habitat requirements, the invasive raccoon could be a potential competitor for Ural owl when raccoon density increases and/or cavity availability decreases, which is the case for many forests in Japan. This study suggests that potential threats of resource competition among not only closely but also distantly related taxa should be taken into consideration when studying the impacts of invasive species...|$|R

In the last decade, wireless local area networks (WLANs) have been widely deployed in indoor environments like offices or campus buildings. The main functionality of these indoor WLANs is to provide network connections to mobile terminals including laptops and handheld devices. However, we realized that when one such indoor environment is empty during evenings, the indoor WLAN in the environment {{can be turned into}} a sensor network for detecting <b>physical</b> intruders. The <b>intrusion</b> detection is based on detecting the transient variations in the wireless channel caused by the movement of the intruders. In Part I of this thesis, the idea of using indoor WLANs for intrusion detection is demonstrated by an implemented multi-node system. Under the constraint of using today’s commercial, off-the-shelf hardware, the signal of interest of this application is the received signal strength index (RSSI) information. We derive maximum likelihood estimators, and we derive change detectors based on the generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) method. The performance of the detectors is analyzed using asymptotic theory in statistics. T...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Embedded devices {{installed}} {{as part of}} the smart grid rollout present a major dilemma for grid defenders, because they are soft targets that could allow an attacker to access critical assets (generators, control centers, etc.) deeper in the utility’s network. While both <b>physical</b> tampering and <b>intrusion</b> protection are large, well-studied fields, state-of-the-art protection schemes suffer from several flaws: They are not powerful enough to respond properly to different tamper events, their severe responses can lead to reduced grid availability, and they often require more setup resources than a utility operator can provide. To protect these networks, we present TEDDI (Tamper Event Detection on Distributed Infrastructure), a distributed, sensor-based tamper protection architecture for embedded devices on utility networks. TEDDI uses data gathered from across the network to make more-informed and more-accurate tamper decisions, and can customize its response based on the event it sees. It can also be configured and installed quickly, without needing a large base of knowledge beforehand. In this paper, we lay out the TEDDI architecture, and discuss how TEDDI solves the grid defender’s dilemma better than current work. 1 INTRODUCTION 1 As part of the push towards a smarter electric grid, utilities have installed a number of edge device...|$|R
40|$|M. A. University of Hawaii at Manoa 2011. Includes bibliographical references. Recent {{research}} suggests that the expressive writing paradigm, which was assumed to be anonymous and intrapersonal, may actually be a communicative and social event. The social integration theory of expressive writing assumes participants increase interactions with their social networks resulting in psychological and physical health improvements. The present study tests the idea that social integration is invoked at the moment the writer perceives the presence of another person (e. g., a reader) in the expressive writing process. Based on the salience of one's social network in instantiating the perception of emotional support, it can be expected that participants who write for a relationally close reader (i. e., close friend or romantic partner) would report stronger and more numerous health outcomes than participants who write for a non-relational reader (e. g., a researcher). Thus, the goal {{of this study was to}} investigate how perceived relational differences between writer and reader may affect expressive writing outcomes. Participants were randomly assigned to one of two experimental conditions designed to induce perceived relational differences with their readers. A third group served as the control. Depression, interpersonal sensitivity, <b>physical</b> health, cognitive <b>intrusions</b> and avoidance were measured. Findings successfully replicated psychological improvements and fell just shy of significance for cognitive benefits. Physical health benefits, however, were not replicated. Additionally, though the findings were not sufficient to reject the null hypotheses, this study poses important theoretical questions regarding the boundaries the social integration theory of expressive writing. Practically, it informs researchers and clinicians of the potential importance of treating expressive writing as a communicative event...|$|R
