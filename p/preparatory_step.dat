Although aware of Berke's conversion to Islam, Hulagu, after conquering Persia, destroyed Baghdad in 1258, added Iraq to the Mongol Empire, advanced towards Syria and Mamluk Sultanate, and began a war of attrition against the Mamluk Sultanate. Berke became enraged with Hulagu's rampage through Muslim lands, and as a <b>preparatory</b> <b>step,</b> directed his nephew Nogai Khan to raid Poland in 1259 in order to collect booty to finance a war. Several Polish cities were plundered, including Kraków and Sandomierz. Berke then struck an alliance with the [...] Mamluk Sultan Qutuz and later Sultan Baibars of Egypt.|$|E
2500|$|MVAH {{health centers}} and spas offer {{a series of}} {{multimodal}} therapies including a purification therapy called panchakarma. Panchakarma means [...] "five actions", and is intended to clear impurities from the body and to balance the doṣas. The first <b>preparatory</b> <b>step</b> is called [...] "snehana", involving the ingestion of prescribed quantities of ghee over several days, followed by a purgative. The actual panchakarma then begins with [...] "abhyanga", a herbalized full-body oil massage and continues {{with one or more}} additional treatments, including [...] "svedana", a herbalized steam bath; [...] "shirodhara", in which warm sesame oil is poured on the forehead; [...] "nasya", an oil massage of head, neck and shoulders combined with steam inhalation and nasal drops; and [...] "basti", a herbal enema. Additional therapies generally undertaken in association with panchakarma are [...] "Maharishi Gandharva Veda" [...] music therapy and aromatherapy. Typical panchakarma treatments take 2 hours per day, over the course of 3 to 14 days, and are recommended several times per year as ideal, usually in conjunction with the change of seasons.|$|E

2500|$|During World War II, Alfred Rosenberg, in his {{capacity}} as the Reich Minister for the Occupied Eastern Territories, issued a series of posters announcing the end of the Soviet collective farms in areas of the USSR under German occupation. [...] He also issued an Agrarian Law in February 1942, annulling all Soviet legislation on farming, restoring family farms for those willing to collaborate with the occupiers. [...] But decollectivization conflicted with the wider demands of wartime food production, and Hermann Göring demanded that the kolkhoz be retained, save for a change of name. [...] Hitler himself denounced the redistribution of land as 'stupid.' In the end, the German occupation authorities retained most of the kolkhozes and simply renamed them [...] "community farms" [...] ( [...] , a throwback to the traditional Russian commune). German propaganda described this as a <b>preparatory</b> <b>step</b> toward ultimate dissolution of the kolkhozes into private farms, which would be granted to peasants who had loyally delivered compulsory quotas of farm produce to the Germans. By 1943, the German occupation authorities had converted 30% of the kolkhozes into German-sponsored [...] "agricultural cooperatives", but as yet had made no conversions to private farms.|$|E
2500|$|The {{gospel of}} John was written to Christians in exile after the {{destruction}} of Jerusalem in AD 70 and the Gentile Johannine community. John does not use the term [...] "repentance" [...] even once in the book, although he {{was familiar with the}} term (see John 20:30-31 and Revelation Chapter 2 and 3). Zane Hodges and Bob Wilkin hold that repentance is defined as turning from one's sins, but repentance is not a requirement for eternal life, only faith in Christ. Hodges takes the position in Absolutely Free! (and in more detail in Harmony With God) that the process of repentance may be a <b>preparatory</b> <b>step</b> in coming to salvation, and should be evident {{in the life of a}} believer, but a lost man can be born again apart from repentance by any definition. Hodges also says that he no longer holds to the change of mind view of repentance. In Harmony with God, Hodges says that there is only one answer to the question “What must I do to be saved?” [...] “Repentance is not part of that answer. It never has been and never will be.” ...|$|E
2500|$|On 28 July at 11:49a.m. Prince Lichnowsky {{sent the}} fourth British offer of mediation, {{this time from}} King George V as well as Grey. Lichnowsky wrote that the King desired that [...] "British-German joint participation, with the {{assistance}} of France and Italy, may be successful in mastering in the interest of peace the present extremely serious situation." [...] At 4:25p.m. on 28 July, Lichnowsky reported to Berlin that [...] "since appearance of Austrian demands nobody here believes in possibility of localizing conflict." [...] The Permanent Secretary of the Foreign Office, Sir Arthur Nicolson, and the Private Secretary to Grey, Sir William Tyrrell, saw Grey's conference offer as [...] "the only possibility of avoiding a general war" [...] and hoped [...] "to get full satisfaction for Austria, as Serbia would be more apt to give in to the pressure of the Powers and to submit to their united will than to the threats of Austria". Tyrrell relayed Grey's view that if Serbia were invaded, [...] "world war would be inevitable". Lichnowsky in his dispatch to Berlin offered [...] "an urgent warning against believing any further in the possibility of localization [...] ". When Sir Edward Goschen, the British Ambassador in Berlin, presented Grey’s conference proposal to Jagow, the Germans totally rejected the offer. In a letter to Grey, Bethmann Hollweg stated that Germany [...] "could not summon Austria before a European court of justice in her case with Serbia". Austrian troops began to concentrate in Bosnia as a <b>preparatory</b> <b>step</b> towards invading Serbia. Falkenhayn told the German government, [...] "It has now been decided to fight the matter through, regardless of the cost," [...] and advised Bethmann Hollweg to order a German attack on Russia and France at once. Moltke supported Falkenhayn by submitting the assessment that 1914 was a [...] "singularly favourable situation" [...] for Germany to go to war as both Russia and France were not prepared whereas Germany was. Once the Russian Great Military Programme would be completed by 1917, Moltke stated that Germany {{would never be able to}} entertain the prospect of a victorious war again and so should destroy both France and Russia while it was still possible. Moltke ended his assessment that [...] "We shall never hit it again so well as we do now." [...] Jagow backed up Moltke by sending a message to Vienna telling the Austrians they must attack Serbia at once because otherwise the British peace plan might be accepted.|$|E

For heaven's sake, what form is Blenkinsopp major in? For heaven's sake, what's his Christian name, and age last birthday, and place in French and mathematics, and general state of health for past quarter? Where's the prompt-book, with house-master's and form-master's report, Maria? Oh, here it is, thank goodness! Let me see; let me see--he's ringing at the door this very instant.

I suppose he's one of those inoffensive, mildly mediocre sort of boys who fail to impress their individuality upon one in any way. My experience is that you can always bear in mind the three cleverest boys at the top of each form, and the three stupidest or most mischievous boys at the bottom; but the nine or a dozen meritorious nobodies {{in the middle of the}} class are all so like one another in every way that you might as well try to discriminate between every individual sheep of a flock in a pasture.
