40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a novel biomimetic cochlea filter which closely resembles the biological cochlea behaviour. The filter is highly feasible for analogue very-large-scale integration (VLSI) circuits, {{which leads to}} a micro-watt-power and millimetre-sized hardware implementation. By virtue of such features, the presented filter contributes to a solid foundation for future biologically-inspired audio signal processors. Unlike existing works, the presented filter is developed by taking direct inspirations from the physiologically measured results of the biological cochlea. Since the biological cochlea has prominently different characteristics of frequency response from low to high frequencies, the biomimetic cochlea filter is built by cascading three sub-filters accordingly: a 2 nd-order bandpass filter for the constant gentle low-frequency response, a 2 nd-order tunable low-pass filter for the variable and selective centre frequency response and a 5 th-order elliptic filter for the ultra-steep roll-off at stop-band. As a proof of concept, a biomimetic cochlea filter bank is built to process audio signals, which demonstrates the highly discriminative spectral decomposition and high-resolution time-frequency analysis capabilities similar to the biological cochlea. The filter has simple representation in the Laplace domain {{which leads to a}} convenient analogue circuit realisation. A floating-active-inductor circuit cell is developed to build the corresponding RLC ladder {{for each of the three}} sub-filters. The circuits are designed based on complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) transistors for VLSI implementation. Non-ideal factors of CMOS transistors including <b>parasitics,</b> <b>noise</b> and mismatches are extensively analysed and consciously considered in the circuit design. An analogue VLSI chip is successfully fabricated using 0. 35 μ m CMOS process. The chip measurements demonstrate that the centre frequency response of the filter has about 20 dB wide gain tuning range and a high quality factor reaching maximally over 19. The filter has a 20 dB/decade constant gentle low-frequency tail and an over 300 dB/decade sharp stop-band roll-off slope. The measured results agree with the filter model expectations and are comparable with the biological cochlea characteristics. Each filter channel consumes as low as 59. 5 90 μ Wpower and occupies only 0. 9 mm 2 area. Besides, the biomimetic cochlea filter chip is characterised from a wide range of angles and the experimental results cover not only the auditory filter specifications but also the integrated circuit design considerations. Furthermore, following the progressive development of the acoustic resonator based on microelectro- mechanical systems (MEMS) technology, a MEMS-CMOS implementation of the proposed filter becomes possible in the future. A key challenge for such implementation is the low sensing capacitance of the MEMS resonator which suffers significantly from sensitivity degradation due to the parasitic capacitance. A novel MEMS capacitive interface circuit chip is additionally developed to solve this issue. As shown in the chip results, the interface circuit is able to cancel the parasitic capacitance and increase the sensitivity of capacitive sensors by 35 dB without consuming any extra power. Besides, the chopper-stabilisation technique is employed which effectively reduces the circuit flicker noise and offsets. Due to these features, the interface circuit chip is capable of converting a 7. 5 fF capacitance change of a 1 -Volt-biased 0. 5 pF capacitive sensor pair into a 0. 745 V signal-conditioned output while consuming only 165. 2 μ W power...|$|R

In this study, we put emphasis on simulation of action potential as a method to help the electrode specification. The amplitude of the expected signal is evaluated in both spatial and frequency domains, with respect to axons variability.

The main task of the attitude actuators, which are mostly wheels, is the generation of useful torques with sufficiently high bandwidth, resolution and accuracy. This is because the bandwidth of the whole attitude control loop and its disturbance rejection capability is dependent upon these factors. These useful torques shall be provided, without - as far as possible - <b>parasitic</b> <b>noise</b> like unbalance forces and torques and harmonics.

These actuators have to cover the dynamic range of these disturbances. Another interesting feature, which is not necessarily related to low noise performance, is a gimballing capability which enables, in a certain angular range, a three axis attitude control with only one wheel.

40|$|The Information Revolution and {{enabling}} era {{of silicon}} ul-tralarge-scale integration (ULSI) have spawned an ever-increasing level of functional integration on-chip, driving {{a need for}} greater circuit density and higher performance. While traditional tran-sistor scaling has thus far met this challenge, interconnect scaling has become the performance-limiting factor for new designs. The increasing influence of interconnect <b>parasitics</b> on crosstalk <b>noise</b> and R(L) C delay as well as electromigration and power dissipa-tion concerns have stimulated the introduction of low-resistivity copper and low-permittivity (k) dielectrics to provide performance and reliability enhancement. Integration of these new materials into integrated circuit fabrication is a formidable task, requiring material, process, design, and packaging innovations. Additionally, entirely new technologies such as RF and optical interconnects {{may be required to}} address future global routing needs and sustain performance improvement.

40|$|Abstract—We {{report in}} this paper the {{procedure}} {{of a system of}} automatic speech recognition based on techniques of the dynamic programming. The technique of temporal retiming is a technique used to synchronize between two forms to compare. We will see how this technique is adapted to the field of the automatic speech recognition. We will expose, in a first place, the theory of the function of retiming which is used to compare and to adjust an unknown form with a whole of forms of reference constituting the vocabulary of the application. Then we will give, in the second place, the various algorithms necessary to their implementation on machine. The algorithms which we will present were tested on part of the corpus of words in Arab language Arabdic- 10 [4] and gave whole satisfaction. These algorithms are effective insofar as we apply them to the small ones or average vocabularies. II. STRUCTURE OF THE STUDIED SYSTEM The systems guided by syntax allow only the recognition of sentences corresponding rigorously to the grammar of the definite language. However, in speech recognition, it is necessary to take account of errors which come primarily from: • addition of <b>parasitic</b> words or <b>noises</b> • errors made by the phonetic decoder • local syntactic alternatives used by the speaker A) Structure Adopted Keywords—Continuous speech recognition, temporal retiming, phonetic decoding, algorithms, vocal signal, dynamic programming.
