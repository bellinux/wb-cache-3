2500|$|Numerical example: Analog FM {{requires}} 0.2MHz <b>per</b> <b>programme.</b> The {{frequency reuse}} factor {{in most countries}} is approximately 15, meaning that {{only one out of}} 15 transmitter sites can use the same channel frequency without problems with co-channel interference, i.e. cross-talk. [...] Assuming a total availability of 102 FM channels at a bandwidth of 0.2MHz over the Band II spectrum of 87.5 to 108.0 MHz, an average of 102/15 = 6.8 radio channels are possible on each transmitter site (plus lower-power local transmitters causing less interference). This results in a system spectral efficiency of 1 / 15 / (0.2 MHz) = 0.30 programmes/transmitter/MHz. DAB with 192 kbit/s codec requires 1.536MHz * 192 kbit/s / 1,136 kbit/s = 0.26MHz per audio programme. The frequency reuse factor for local programmes and multi-frequency broadcasting networks (MFN) is typically 4 or 5, resulting in 1 / 4 / (0.26MHz) = 0.96 programmes/transmitter/MHz. [...] This is 3.2 times as efficient as analog FM for local stations. For single frequency network (SFN) transmission, for example of national programmes, the channel re-use factor is 1, resulting in 1/1/0.25MHz = 3.85 programmes/transmitter/MHz, which is 12.7 times as efficient as FM for national and regional networks.|$|E

5000|$|A {{considerable}} amount of research has concluded that sexually suggestive content is pervasive in the media. The {{most common type of}} sexually suggestive content in adolescent programming {{is in the form of}} a sexual innuendo. Sexual innuendoes give a suggestive alternative meaning to an otherwise neutral phrase. For example, the use of the phrase [...] "bend over backwards" [...] when describing a colleague, in the sitcom How I Met Your Mother, is used by the main character Barney to imply something in both a figurative sense (i.e. that she is willing to work hard) and a suggestive sense (alluding to her flexibility in sexual positions). Content analyses of sexual behavior in the media found that sexual content on television has risen from 45% in 1975 to 81% now. 83% of all programs on television contain sexual content. 80% of programs contain sexually suggestive references, and 49% of shows contain sexual behavior which include flirting. Sexual innuendoes occur as much as twice per program in popular American sitcoms, whilst flirting occurred at least once <b>per</b> <b>programme.</b> The use of sexual innuendoes in the media is also done through newspapers, magazines and music, and accounts for roughly 12% of the entire sexual content shown in the media overall. [...] Analysis of sexually suggestive behavior in sports media showed that there was considerable gender differences in how sports stars are portrayed visually. For example, females are photographed nude more frequently than men, and were photographed in a hetero-sexy manner which was done to attract the male gaze, such as with sports equipment covering their genitalia due to its suggestive nature. Overall, females are portrayed in a manner that alludes to their status as a sex symbol.|$|E
40|$|Terrestrial {{broadcasting}} {{has brought}} entertainment and media information to mass audiences {{around the world}} for nearly a century. In the last two decades, the demand for consumption of multimedia services anywhere anytime has increased greatly. Because the spectrum resource is limited, a new spectrum efficient broadcasting technology is required to meet this demand. Digital broadcast technologies, such as the European Digital Video Broadcast- Terrestrial (DVB-T), moved terrestrial broadcast into the digital age. While analog broadcast can only deliver one programme per channel, digital broadcast namely DVB-T allows multi-programme broadcasting where 2 to 4 standard definition TV (SDTV) programmes can be transmitted with time division multiplexing in a single 8 MHz channel. The bandwidth of DVB-T (from 12 to 24 Mbit/s) can be allocated to offer different TV qualities, such as enhanced definition television (EDTV, re-quiring about 10 to 12 Mbit/s <b>per</b> <b>programme)</b> or high definition TV (HDTV, requiring about 24 Mbit/s <b>per</b> <b>programme)</b> [1].

40|$|Objective: {{to explore}} the {{preferences}} of community-dwelling older persons regarding different programme formats for managing concerns about falls. Subjects and design: cross-sectional study of 5, 755 community-dwelling people aged ≥ 70 years in the Netherlands. Methods: a questionnaire assessed people's willingness to participate <b>per</b> <b>programme</b> format (n =  6), i. e. a programme at home, via telephone, via home visits and telephone consultations, via television or via Internet. Results: of the 2, 498 responders, 62. 7 % indicated no interest {{in any of the}} formats. The willingness to participate <b>per</b> <b>programme</b> format varied between 21. 5 (at home) and 9. 4 % (via Internet). Among people interested in {{at least one of the}} formats (n =  931), higher levels of fall-related concerns were associated with increased preference for a programme with home visits. Poor perceived health and age ≥ 80 years were associated with less preference for a group programme. Higher educated people were more in favour of a programme via Internet compared with their lower educated counterparts. Conclusion: the majority of community-dwelling older people are not likely to participate in any of the six proposed programme formats for managing concerns about falls. However, when diverse formats of effective programmes will be made available, uptake and adherence may be increased since programme preferences are associated to specific population characteristics. status: publishe...|$|E

Consideration of technical specifications and expert opinions indicated that recording five programme items with eight studio and two MEMS microphones could allow determination of the attributes related to the most prominent inter-microphone differences. Pairwise listening comparisons between the resulting 50 recordings, followed by multi-dimensional scaling analysis, revealed up to five salient dimensions <b>per</b> <b>programme</b> item; seventeen corresponding pairs of recordings were selected exemplifying the differences across those dimensions. Direct elicitation and panel discussions on the seventeen pairs identified a hierarchy of 40 perceptual attributes. An attribute contribution experiment on the 31 lowest-level attributes in the hierarchy allowed them to be ordered by degree of contribution and showed brightness, harshness, and clarity to always contribute highly to perceived inter-microphone differences. This work enables the future development of objective models to predict these important attributes...|$|E
