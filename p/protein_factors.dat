25|$|Splicing of mRNA is {{performed}} by an RNA and protein complex {{known as the}} spliceosome, containing snRNPs designated U1, U2, U4, U5, and U6 (U3 {{is not involved in}} mRNA splicing). U1 binds to the 5' GU and U2, {{with the assistance of the}} U2AF <b>protein</b> <b>factors,</b> binds to the branchpoint A within the branch site. The complex at this stage is known as the spliceosome A complex. Formation of the A complex is usually the key step in determining the ends of the intron to be spliced out, and defining the ends of the exon to be retained. (The U nomenclature derives from their high uridine content).|$|E
25|$|Elongating {{polymerase}} {{is associated}} with a set of <b>protein</b> <b>factors</b> required for various types of RNA processing. mRNA is capped as soon as it emerges from the RNA-exit channel of the polymerase. After capping, dephosphorylation of Ser-5 within the CTD repeats may be responsible for dissociation of the capping machinery. Further phosphorylation of Ser-2 causes recruitment of the RNA splicing machinery that catalyzes the removal of non-coding introns to generate mature mRNA. Alternative splicing expands the protein complements in eukaryotes. Just as with 5’-capping and splicing, the CTD tail is involved in recruiting enzymes responsible for 3’-polyadenylation, the final RNA processing event that is coupled with the termination of transcription.|$|E
25|$|In prokaryotes, {{transcription}} {{is carried}} out by a single type of RNA polymerase, which needs a DNA sequence called a Pribnow box {{as well as a}} sigma factor (σ factor) to start transcription. In eukaryotes, transcription is performed by three types of RNA polymerases, each of which needs a special DNA sequence called the promoter and a set of DNA-binding proteins—transcription factors—to initiate the process. RNA polymerase I is responsible for transcription of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) genes. RNA polymerase II (Pol II) transcribes all protein-coding genes but also some non-coding RNAs (e.g., snRNAs, snoRNAs or long non-coding RNAs). Pol II includes a C-terminal domain (CTD) that is rich in serine residues. When these residues are phosphorylated, the CTD binds to various <b>protein</b> <b>factors</b> that promote transcript maturation and modification. RNA polymerase III transcribes 5S rRNA, transfer RNA (tRNA) genes, and some small non-coding RNAs (e.g., 7SK). Transcription ends when the polymerase encounters a sequence called the terminator.|$|E

40|$|The {{hepatitis}} B virus EnhI {{enhancer element}} overlaps the promoter of the X gene. By performing methylation interference experiments, four <b>protein</b> <b>factor</b> binding sites clustered in a 120 -bp region {{were found to}} control the EnhI enhancer and X promoter activities. Deletion mapping experiments indicated that the two upstream <b>protein</b> <b>factor</b> binding sites constituted a basal enhancer module. This module, likely bound by a liver-specific factor and a ubiquitous factor, could activate the herpes simplex virus thymidine kinase gene promoter by 5 - or 10 -fold, depending on the orientation, in Huh 7 cells, a liver-derived cell line, but not in other cell types tested. The two downstream <b>protein</b> <b>factor</b> binding sites interact with the upstream basal enhancer module in an orientation- and distance-dependent manner to increase the enhancer activity by another 10 -fold. In addition, {{at least one of}} the two downstream <b>protein</b> <b>factor</b> binding sites is also essential for the X promoter activity...|$|R

40|$|Catabolite {{repression}} {{is defined}} as the inhibition of enzyme induction by glucose or related substances.

40|$|The {{expression}} of alpha-smooth muscle actin is coordinately regulated by {{positive and negative}} cis- elements in the promoter region. Although cis -elements and trans -acting factors involved in the positive regulation of the alpha-smooth muscle (alpha-SM) actin gene have been well characterized, details of negative regulation remain unclear. In functional analyses using cultured gizzard smooth muscle cells, we identified a sequence ranging from - 238 to - 219 in the promoter region as a novel negative element. Mutation and deletion analyses further revealed that a sequence, TATCTTA (- 228 to - 222), is essential for negative regulation. Gel shift assay and Southwestern blotting indicated that a nuclear <b>protein</b> <b>factor</b> specifically interacts with single- or double-strand DNA including this sequence, and the <b>protein</b> <b>factor</b> displays a highly potent binding to the sense strand DNA. cDNA cloning and gel shift analysis using anti-MSSP- 1 antibodies revealed that this <b>protein</b> <b>factor</b> is a chicken homolog of human MSSP- 1 (c- myc gene single-strand binding protein- 1).
