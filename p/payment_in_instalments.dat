25|$|For each {{property}} in the rating list for their area, the local authority calculates and issues a bill, which it is responsible for collecting, with powers to pursue payment. The rateable value is multiplied by the Uniform Business Rate, referred to in legislation as the non-domestic rating multiplier, to arrive at an annual bill. For example, a rateable value of £10,000 and a multiplier of 40p would produce an annual bill of £4000. The bill usually requires <b>payment</b> <b>in</b> <b>instalments</b> over the financial year.|$|E

40|$|Learning {{for self}} {{development}} {{and professional development}} has almost become a necessity {{in the face of}} rapid technological advancement, knowledge explosion and socio-economic change among others; and for most adults combining work with study may be the only way out for them to further their education. Part-time study is thus becoming trendy worldwide including Ghana. But it also comes with its challenges. This paper sought to find out what these problems are in Ghana. The survey design was used with the questionnaire being the principal instrument and data was analyzed using descriptive statistics. There were 160 students who were sampled from four institutions offering part-time study in Accra. Three of them were offering professional courses with City Campus of University of Ghana offering academic courses. The findings revealed that part-time students have problems relating to family responsibilities, work, institutional commitments and finance among others. The findings indicated that course deliveries at the distance need to be flexible in terms of structure and time. Distance education provision must consider fee <b>payments</b> <b>in</b> <b>instalments</b> <b>in</b> order to retain the students in the learning activities...|$|R
50|$|Between 1831 and 1833 King William IV of Hanover and the United Kingdom decreed several acts {{allowing}} tenant {{farmers to}} become proprietors {{of the land}} they tilled thus effectuating the emancipation of the serfs in the Kingdom of Hanover, of which Bremen-Verden formed part since 1814. However, the laws {{paved the way for}} the emancipation, but specific procedures, in order to find out the actual dues, monetarised or in kind alike, the lands subject to socage, the services to be delivered to the masters, and fixing the payments redeeming these burdens, and finally assigning the lands as property to the former tenants and the former lords, only started on request of the tenants wishing their emancipation. Unlike the earlier emancipation of the serfs in Prussia (1810, with redemption procedures starting in 1811) the Hanoverian laws provided only for <b>payments,</b> <b>in</b> <b>instalments,</b> but not generally for cessions of land the tenants tilled, in order to compensate their former feudal lords.|$|R
50|$|The main {{physical}} obstacle was {{the great}} mass of Plynlimon, separating West Wales from the Severn Valley; {{it was to be}} tunnelled as part of the 50 mile section between Llanidloes and Pencader. The Mid-Wales Railway had been authorised in 1859 to build from Llanidloes to Newbridge-on-Wye, and the Manchester and Milford now realised that the other company's authorised alignment was largely over the same terrain as its own for two miles or so from Llanidloes south to a place called Penpontbren. The M&MR's reaction was to persuade Frederick Beeston to build that section at once, so as to pre-empt the intentions of the Mid-Wales, which had not done much in its first year. Beeston agreed to do this for £30,000 and £10,000 in paid-up shares; this was accepted by the M&MR, but the company did not have that amount of cash available, and persuaded Beeston to take the <b>payment</b> <b>in</b> <b>instalments,</b> and in paid-up shares at a 33% discount. All this was contingent on the M&MR acquiring the land, but the MWR was already negotiating with landowners, and the idea of stealing a march on the MWR was impossible. An uninspiring series of disingenuous proposals followed, eventually leading to legal action. At length the solution was arrived at: the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway had been authorised in 1859 to build east from Llanidloes, and {{was in the process of}} construction; indeed the M&MR always planned to make an end-on junction with it. If the L&NR were to build the two miles of disputed route (as far south as Penpontbren), and make that part of its line available solely to the M&MR and the MWR, then the problem would be solved. A Parliamentary Bill for the Llanidloes and Newtown Railway was prepared for the 1862 session, and it was authorised in that year. The two companies were to pay it 5% per annum on capital, and there was to be a joint station at Llanidloes; the Manchester and Milford was to pay a third of the running costs of the station and interest on its capital cost.|$|E
40|$|Colombo city is the {{business}} capital in Sri Lanka. The growth of businesses in the city is increasing day by day. As {{a result of this}} situation, many urban dwellers those living outside the capital are attracted to the city. The traffic conditions, environmental pollution around Colombo district is getting higher due to these unavoidable movements of vehicles, etc. Solutions for the situation are being implemented as part of the master plan for development of the city. Most of the suburban population who travel to Colombo daily cannot afford to build their own houses within city limits as the cost of land and cost of construction are not within their means. Purchasing an apartment on <b>payment</b> <b>in</b> <b>instalments</b> is an ideal alternative especially to private sector executives who travel to Colombo daily with their whole family as most such children attend prestigious schools in Colombo. The Sky Residencies high-rise building project was planned to cater to this sector of population with availability of state of the art apartments priced reasonably leading to improvement of quality of life. The Sky Residencies will be located in Buthgamuwa road Rajagiriya very close to the city of Colombo. The land area is approximately 180 perches. Sky Residencies is is planned for a height of 165 m and consist of 46 stories including 5 parking floors, 40 apartment floors and a recreational floor. This is designed to facilitate 160 apartments with the choice of 2 bedroom and 3 bedroom apartment. Sky Residencies is designed according to the green concept to achieve sustainable development. It will {{become one of the most}} sustainable buildings in Sri Lanka and will be unique in its architecture and structural features. Facilitation of obtaining a soft loan from a reputed bank to the purchaser is planned to attract buyers. According to the Sri Lanka real estate market brief, KPMG condominium property developments are having average pre construction sale ratio of around 50 % while high more prestige development like empire emperor lumiere and trillium tend to have about 80 % preconstruction sale ratio. Therefore there is a huge condominium market in Colombo. Sky residencies will be at the top of the market when it’s initiated because of its unique features. There are eleven Chapters in this report. This final report is prepared to give the reader a detail and complete intuition to the Project. Project. Vision, mission, objectives and goals of the project were described here. Feasibility study, Competitive advantage of this project and detail design of this project is described in this report. Social, financial and technical feasibility studies were also considered. Since some environmental issues can arise due to this project, it is very important to do an Initial Environment Examination (IEE). On the other hand a Traffic Impact Assessment (TIA) is needed in order to visualize the traffic impact to the surrounding area due to this project. Therefore a detailed IEE and a detailed TIA were included in this report [...] The architectural design was done to accommodate topographical variations. The services arrangement for lift, supply water, waste treatment methods are included in this project. The computer analysis for the building was done by using SAP 2000 software. Different load cases dead, imposed and dynamic loads such as wind were also considered. As stipulate in government requirement for new buildings in Sri Lanka safety against earthquakes is also designed. In addition to that thermal comfort was assessed by using DEROB LTH. Main Items of the BOQ are included together with the Details. At the end of the report further detail & architectural drawings were given in the annex. All the design parts were done in accordance with a code of practice and guidelines. This report will give a detail description about the project objectives, challenges we faced and how we overcome them to the reader...|$|E
