2500|$|One {{criticism}} of some Caslon-style typefaces {{has been a}} concern that the capitals are too thick in design and stand out too much, making for an uneven colour on the <b>page.</b> <b>Printer</b> and typeface designer Frederic Goudy was a critic: [...] "the strong contrast between the over-black stems of the capitals and the light weight stems in the lower-case...makes a 'spotty' page". He cited dissatisfaction with the style as an incentive for becoming more involved in type design around 1911, when he created Kennerley Old Style as an alternative.|$|E

50|$|A <b>page</b> <b>printer</b> is a {{computer}} printer which processes and prints a whole page at a time, as opposed to printers which print one line or character at a time such as line printers and dot-matrix printers. Page printers are often all incorrectly termed “laser printers” - although virtually all laser printers are page printers, other page printing technologies also exist.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. We {{study the}} problem of {{learning}} from positive and unlabeled examples. Although several techniques exist for dealing with this problem, they all assume that positive examples in the positive set P and the positive examples in the unlabeled set U are generated from the same distribution. This assumption may be violated in practice. For example, one wants to collect all <b>printer</b> <b>pages</b> from the Web. One can use the <b>printer</b> <b>pages</b> from one site as the set P of positive pages and use product pages from another site as U. One wants to classify the pages in U into <b>printer</b> <b>pages</b> and non-printer <b>pages.</b> Although <b>printer</b> <b>pages</b> from the two sites have many similarities, {{they can also be}} quite different because different sites often present similar products in different styles and have different focuses. In such cases, existing methods perform poorly. This paper proposes a novel technique A-EM to deal with the problem. Experiment results with product page classification demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed technique. ...|$|R
40|$|As {{we enter}} a new century, {{not just the}} economy alone, but also society at large is {{starting}} to form a foundation for information technology that is centered on the Internet. The quality of information is becoming more varied {{and the amount of}} information is increasing geometrically. Also, it is presumed that all information passed along some kind of network. Consequently, a more advanced human interface is of paramount importance. Printers will further strengthen their role of providing information in the form of documents that are either attractive and easy to read or easy to look at. In preparation for the 21 st century, Oki Data changed its business model from one in which the printer business was a stand-alone business, to one in which it becomes a solution business that also includes system software and applications. Through our vision of “providing printing solutions, ” we will aim to further increase our customer value and our corporate value. Printer Market Environment It was said that the spread of the Internet and e-mail would do away with paper, but the certainty, reliability and convenience of paper as a medium continues to expand the printer market (Figure 1). Furthermore, as cameras, video equipment, copiers, and TVs become digital, printer applications as an image output for such devices are expanding. On the other hand, ink jet printers spurred the color sector of the market, which is also expanding more rapidly than expected. Looking at the printer formats, we see that impact printers have entered a period of decline while ink jet <b>printers</b> and monochrome <b>page</b> <b>printers</b> have entered a period of stability. Color <b>page</b> <b>printers</b> are continuing to grow rapidly {{at an annual rate of}} more than 30 %.

50|$|In 1916, Kleinschmidt filed {{a patent}} {{application}} for a type-bar <b>page</b> <b>printer</b> This printer utilized Baudot code but did not utilize the start-stop synchronization technology that Howard Krum had previously patented. The type-bar printer was intended for use on multiplex circuits, and its printing was controlled from a local segment on a receiving distributor of the sunflower type. In 1919, Kleinschmidt appeared to be concerned chiefly with development of multiplex transmitters for use with this printer.|$|E

50|$|The design {{objective}} for the Model 33 was {{a machine that}} would fit into a small office space, match with other office equipment {{of the time and}} operate up to two hours per day on average. Since this machine was designed for light duty use, adjustments that Teletype made in previous teleprinters by turning screws were made by bending metal bars and levers. Many Model 33 parts were not heat treated and hardened. However, the base was die cast, but self-tapping screws were used, along with parts that snapped together without bolting. In another cost saving measure, the paper tape equipment was dependent on the keyboard and <b>page</b> <b>printer</b> mechanisms. Earlier Teletype machine designs, such as the Model 28 ASR, allowed the user to operate the keyboard to punch tape while transmitting a previously punched tape and to punch a tape while printing something else. Independent use of the paper tape punch and reader is not possible with the Model 33 ASR.|$|E
