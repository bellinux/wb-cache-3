40|$|Abstract: This {{paper offers}} a {{possible}} explanation for the conflicting empirical results in the literature concerning the relation between loan risk and collateral. Specifically, we posit that different economic characteristics or types of collateral pledges may be associated with the empirical dominance of the four different risk-collateral channels implied by economic theory. For our sample, collateral overall is associated with lower loan risk premiums and a higher probability of ex post loan nonperformance (delinquency or default). This finding suggests that the dominant reason collateral is pledged is that banks require collateral from observably riskier borrowers (“lender selection ” effect), while lower risk premiums arise because secured loans carry lower losses given default (“loss mitigation ” effect). We also find that the risk-collateral channels depend on the economic characteristics and types of collateral. The lender selection effect appears to be especially important for outside collateral, the “risk-shifting ” or “loss mitigation ” effects for liquid collateral, and the “borrower selection ” effect for nondivertible collateral. Among collateral types, we find that the lender selection effect is particularly strong for residential real estate collateral and that the risk shifting effect is important for <b>pledged</b> <b>deposits</b> and bank guarantees. Our results suggest that the conflicting results in the extant riskcollateral literature may be because different samples may be dominated by collateralized loans with different economic characteristics or different types of collateral...|$|R

50|$|The {{main point}} of the {{conflict}} around the Odesa Port-Side Plant is as follows:— Prime Minister Tymoshenko is intention was, via privatization of the strategic enterprise OPSP, to substantially inject into the state budget in «the crisis 2009 year». It was, also, the time, when Ukraine was preparing to the presidential election. President Yushchenko fought against Tymoshenko, and he vetoed privatization of the Odesa Port-Side Plant. Due to that, «the most affluent investors» did not {{take part in the}} auction; the claims for participation were presented by just three companies. At the auction, the price, practically, remained at its basic level. The auction was won by the firm «Nortima» (owned by Ihor Kolomoyskyi), but Tymoshenko informed that the plant would not be sold off so as «the participants had agreed about the minimal price». In response, Kolomoyskyi promised to start suing while Tymoshenko stopped discharging <b>pledges</b> <b>deposited</b> by the firms «Nortima» and «Frunze-Flora». But the third member of the auction — the Russian company «Azot-Service» (which represented the interests of Gazprom) immediately received the money that previously made a pledge at the auction. Tymoshenko explained that at the moment the state has no money to spend (the crisis 2009 year), but promised to immediately repay the full amount as soon as the plant will be privatized.|$|R
