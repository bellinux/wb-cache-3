40|$|<b>Physical</b> <b>models,</b> like {{mathematical}} models, {{are useful}} tools in biomechanical research. <b>Physical</b> <b>models</b> enable investigators to explore parameter {{space in a}} way that is not possible using a comparative approach with living organisms: parameters can be varied one at a time to measure the performance consequences of each, while values and combinations not found in nature can be tested. Experiments using <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> in the laboratory or field can circumvent problems posed by uncooperative or endangered organisms. <b>Physical</b> <b>models</b> also permit some aspects of the biomechanical performance of extinct organisms to be measured. Use of properly scaled <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> allows detailed <b>physical</b> measurements to be made for organisms that are too small or fast to be easily studied directly. The process of <b>physical</b> <b>modelling</b> and the advantages and limitations of this approach are illustrated using examples from our research on hydrodynamic forces on sessile organisms, mechanics of hydraulic skeletons, food capture by zooplankton and odour interception by olfactory antennules...|$|R

5|$|In 2011, Kooijman, et al., {{published}} an article in Science showing that neither gyroscopic effects nor so-called caster effects due to trail are necessary for a bike to balance itself.

Then they constructed a <b>physical</b> <b>model</b> to validate that prediction. This may require some of the details provided below about steering geometry or stability to be re-evaluated.

40|$|The {{hydraulic}} {{design of}} coastal structures {{is a complex}} task. <b>Physical</b> <b>models</b> are employed as design tools in almost all major coastal engineering projects. Design <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> have the goal of attempting to predict prototype behaviour by reproducing as good as possible all the features and forces of an actual prototype situation (e. g. breakwater stability, wave penetration in harbours). <b>Physical</b> <b>models</b> {{can also be used}} to study a physical process in detail in order to develop new understanding about the physics (e. g. flow or wave forces on piles). Besides, <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> are applied to verify or extend numerical models. These validation models may not resemble anything in the real world because often they are idealized and simplified to minimize scale effects and to provide a test case that mare closely fits the assumptions of numerical models (e. g. rectangular harbour with perfectly reflecting vertical side walls). In the oral presentation the different goals and types of <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> will be presented. Advantages, disadvantages and complementary design tools (field measurements and numerical models) will be discussed briefly. A number of photos of <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> and videos of model tests will illustrate the possibilities of <b>physical</b> <b>modelling...</b>|$|R
40|$|Designers use various {{representations}} to externalize their ideas, <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> {{being an}} important one. <b>Physical</b> <b>models</b> {{are widely used}} by designers and their use is promoted as an effective design tool by industry and government agencies. However, very {{little is known about}} the cognitive effects of <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> in the design process; the available guidelines are conflicting. Some researchers argue for the frequent implementation of <b>physical</b> <b>models,</b> while others observe that the use of <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> fixates designers. In light of these conflicts, the research discussed in this dissertation focuses on understanding the cognitive effects of <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> and developing guidelines for aiding designers in their implementation. A combination of controlled lab studies and qualitative studies is adopted to achieve said goal. The results from the controlled studies show that <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> supplement designers? erroneous mental models and help them to come up with more ideas satisfying the problem requirements. These studies also demonstrate that design fixation is not inherent in <b>physical</b> <b>modeling,</b> but it is caused by the Sunk Cost Effect. According to Sunk Cost Effect, as designers spend more time building <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> of their initial ideas, they tend to fixate more to the variations of those ideas. A qualitative study on industry-sponsored projects and development cases of award-winning products further supports these results in more realistic situations. Further, the studies reported in this dissertation show that <b>physical</b> <b>models</b> can be effective tools for the mitigation of fixation to undesirable design features in a flawed example; however, these results can also depend upon the experience level of a designer in solving open-ended design problems. With these insights from the series of studies, a set of guidelines and a Model Error Reeducation Method (MERM) are formulated and tested with novice designers. MERM helps designers in identifying critical loads and interface designs they miss in their original designs, before prototyping. The results from the testing of this method show that this method is very useful in avoiding said errors in <b>physical</b> <b>modeling...</b>|$|R

5|$|First Contact was {{the last}} film to feature a <b>physical</b> <b>model</b> of the Enterprise. For the ship's {{dramatic}} introduction, the effects team combined motion control shots of the Enterprise model with a computer-generated background. Sequence supervisor Dennis Turner, who had created Generations energy ribbon and specialized in creating natural phenomena, was charged with creating the star cluster, modeled after the Eagle Nebula. The nebular columns and solid areas were modeled with basic wireframe geometry, with surface shaders applied to make {{the edges of the}} nebula glow. A particle render that ILM had devised for the earlier tornado film Twister was used to create a turbulent look within the nebula. Once the shots of the Enterprise had been captured, Turner inserted the ship into the computer-generated background and altered its position until the images matched up.|$|E
25|$|The {{inside of}} the ribbon was {{conceptualized}} as similar to a dense electrical storm, with tendrils of electricity fogging the screen. Because of the complex interplay of the ribbon elements with the ships that would be trapped within it, ILM decided the refugee ships and Enterprise-B should be CG models. To make the switch between computer-generated and motion-control passes of the <b>physical</b> <b>model</b> appear seamless, ILM created a wireframe of the <b>physical</b> <b>model,</b> with the computer-generated model's textures taken from photos of the <b>physical</b> <b>model,</b> shot in flat light with a long lens.

25|$|A {{character}} {{carried over}} from Versus XIII, Regis underwent a major redesign during development, becoming an older character in appearance. This {{was due to}} Regis's expanding role in Kingsglaive and the new technology available. The development team {{wanted to create a}} more expressive character and aged him to properly convey his stature as a king. Due to this, his in-game incarnation was redesigned to better fit with his portrayal in Kingsglaive. The redesign was also chosen as his original design no longer fit into the reworked story of Final Fantasy XV. As with the rest of Lucis' royalty, he is dressed in black due to its specific significance. Regis' motion capture and <b>physical</b> <b>model</b> were provided by British actor Jon Campling.|$|E

He provided the first solutions for cases where angular momentum conservation needs to be incorporated. His methods are used by experimentalists to fit data and extrapolate to different pressure regimes, supplanting previous tools which were of dubious validity and accuracy. His coworkers and he obtained data on the collisional energy transfer process and used them to prove the conjecture that each collision involves only a small exchange of energy. He then developed the first rigorous means to calculate these quantities from basic theory, and the first <b>physical</b> <b>model</b> for the process. His work is widely used, both for basic understanding of the transition states and by atmospheric and combustion modellers. Predicting climate change and effects on the ozone layer rely critically on this modelling.|$|E
25|$|In industry, thermal {{analyses}} are often {{ignored in the}} design process or performed too latenbsp&—nbsp&when design changes are limited and become too costly. Of the three methods mentioned in this article, theoretical and numerical methods {{can be used to}} determine an estimate of the heat sink or component temperatures of products before a <b>physical</b> <b>model</b> has been made. A theoretical model is normally used as a first order estimate. Online heat sink calculators can provide a reasonable estimate of forced and natural convection heat sink performance based on a combination of theoretical and empirically derived correlations. Numerical methods or computational fluid dynamics (CFD) provide a qualitative (and sometimes even quantitative) prediction of fluid flows. What this means is that it will give a visual or post-processed result of a simulation, like the images in figures 16 and 17, and the CFD animations in figure 18 and 19, but the quantitative or absolute accuracy of the result is sensitive to the inclusion and accuracy of the appropriate parameters.|$|E
