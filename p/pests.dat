5|$|A {{potential}} {{obstacle to}} the adoption of biological pest control measures is growers sticking to the familiar use of pesticides. However, pesticides have a variety of undesired effects, including the development of resistance among <b>pests,</b> and the destruction of natural enemies; these may in turn enable outbreaks of <b>pests</b> of other species than the ones originally targeted, and on crops at a distance from those treated with pesticides. One method of increasing grower adoption of biocontrol methods involves letting them learn by doing, for example showing them simple field experiments, enabling them to observe the live predation of <b>pests,</b> or demonstrations of parasitised <b>pests.</b> In the Philippines, early season sprays against leaf folder caterpillars were common practice, but growers were asked to follow a 'rule of thumb' of not spraying against leaf folders for the first 30 days after transplanting; participation in this resulted in a reduction of insecticide use by 1/3 and a change in grower perception of insecticide use.|$|E
5|$|Among {{the most}} serious disease {{problems}} are fireblight, a bacterial disease; and Gymnosporangium rust, and black spot, two fungal diseases. Codling moths and apple maggots are two other <b>pests</b> which affect apple trees. Young apple trees are also prone to mammal <b>pests</b> like mice and deer, which feed on the soft bark of the trees, especially in winter.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{not being}} an {{agricultural}} weed in itself, it hosts {{a number of}} insects and diseases, including both <b>pests</b> and beneficial insects. It is also a potential reservoir of the cucumber mosaic virus, Erysiphum cichoraceum (the cucurbit powdery mildew) and Texas root rot. A study found V.thapsus hosts insects from 29 different families. Most of the <b>pests</b> found were western flower thrips (Frankliniella occidentalis), Lygus species such as the tarnished plant bug (L. lineolaris), and various spider mites from the family Tetranychidae. These make the plant a potential reservoir for overwintering <b>pests.</b>|$|E

50|$|Assessing the {{likelihood}} of <b>pest</b> entry requires assessment {{of each of the}} pathways with which a <b>pest</b> may be associated, from its origin to its establishment in the <b>pest</b> risk analysis area. In a <b>pest</b> risk analysis initiated by a specific pathway, often an imported commodity or goods associated with an imported commodity, e.g. packing materials, the probability of <b>pest</b> entry is evaluated for that specific pathway. For a <b>pest</b> risk analysis initiated for a specific <b>pest,</b> all probable pathways are evaluated for that individual <b>pest.</b>|$|R

5|$|Forest <b>pests</b> {{present a}} {{significant}} problem {{because it is not}} easy to access the canopy and monitor pest populations. In addition, forestry <b>pests</b> such as bark beetles, kept under control by natural enemies in their native range, may be transported large distances in cut timber to places where they have no natural predators, enabling them to cause extensive economic damage. Pheromone traps have been used to monitor pest populations in the canopy. These release volatile chemicals that attract males. Pheromone traps can detect the arrival of <b>pests</b> or alert foresters to outbreaks. For example, spruce budworm has been monitored using pheromone traps in Canadian forests for several decades.|$|E

50|$|To {{estimate}} {{the likelihood of}} establishment of a <b>pest,</b> biological information about the <b>pest</b> including its life cycle, its hosts or habitat needs, or a diseases epidemiology, together with characteristics of the abiotic environment affecting <b>pest</b> survival such as temperature, precipitation and perhaps soil type affecting its geographic range limit need to be considered. The environmental conditions under which the <b>pest</b> does not survive are also important to understand. Conditions in the <b>pest</b> risk analysis area can then be compared with conditions {{in areas where the}} <b>pest</b> survives, and in areas where the <b>pest</b> is known {{not to be able to}} survive, so as to assess the likelihood that the <b>pest</b> will establish in the <b>pest</b> risk analysis area. Computer simulation models can be used to inform assessments of likelihood of establishment.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{problems}} in addressing <b>pest</b> management is inadequate knowledge about the factors influencing <b>pest</b> population dynamics. To understand <b>pest</b> dynamics, scientists and researchers collect <b>pest</b> surveillance data and related agricultural operations regarding crops, farming practices, weather parameters, etc. These databases contain details of <b>pest</b> incidence, climatic, soil, agricultural practices and serve as repositories of information. Correlations between some of these factors and <b>pest</b> incidence based on statistical models have been developed to some extent. However, a functionally viable model for <b>pest</b> forecast and pesticide use is still needed by farmers for efficient and effective <b>pest</b> management. This paper describes the frame work of the <b>pest</b> management system using data mining techniques; which concentrate on providing, historical data, current and recommended <b>pest</b> and pesticide information and to be simulated <b>pest</b> models up to farm level. In this work, an attempt has been made to show how geospatial data mining integrated with agriculture including <b>pest</b> scouting, pesticide and climatological parameters are useful for optimization of pesticide usage and better management. The outcomes will reveal interesting patterns of farmer practices along with pesticide usage dynamics both in spatial & non spatial way and can help to make out the reasons for <b>pest</b> and pesticide exploitation...|$|R
5|$|In cotton production, the {{replacement}} of broad-spectrum insecticides with selective control measures such as Bt cotton can create a more favorable environment for natural enemies of cotton <b>pests</b> due to reduced insecticide exposure risk. Such predators or parasitoids can control <b>pests</b> not affected by the Bt protein. Reduced prey quality and abundance associated increased control from Bt cotton can also indirectly decrease natural enemy populations in some cases, but the percentage of <b>pests</b> eaten or parasitized in Bt and non-Bt cotton are often similar.|$|E
5|$|In {{homes and}} urban environments, the <b>pests</b> are the rodents, birds, insects and other organisms that share the habitat with humans, and that feed on and spoil possessions. Control of these <b>pests</b> is {{attempted}} through exclusion, repulsion, physical removal or chemical means. Alternatively, various methods of biological control {{can be used}} including sterilisation programmes.|$|E

40|$|Population {{levels of}} two or more <b>pest</b> species are {{frequently}} interdependent and this has consequences for the optimal control of any single one targeted for control. When the controlled <b>pest</b> species is a predator on another <b>pest</b> or is in competitive relationship with it, the optimal (most economic) control of the target species is smaller than {{in the absence of the}} interdependence. On the other hand, if the controlled <b>pest</b> species is the prey of predator that is also a <b>pest,</b> or is in symbiosis with another <b>pest,</b> greater control of the target species is required (from an economic standpoint) than in the absence of this interdependence. Conditions for the most economic control of a targeted <b>pest</b> species are outlined and it is observed that governments sometimes fail to take account of the interdependence of <b>pest</b> populations in their <b>pest</b> control policies...|$|R
50|$|The {{purpose of}} <b>pest</b> {{categorization}} {{is to determine}} whether a <b>pest</b> identified during the initiation stage satisfies the criteria of being a quarantine <b>pest.</b> A quarantine <b>pest</b> is a <b>pest</b> of potential economic importance to the area endangered thereby and not yet present there, or present but not widely distributed and being officially controlled. Pest categorization includes all the main elements considered in Step 2 of a <b>pest</b> risk assessment but the elements are considered in less detail and <b>pest</b> categorization is essentially a quick assessment of whether the analysis should continue. The categorization step provides an opportunity to eliminate a <b>pest</b> from analysis at an early stage in the <b>pest</b> risk analysis process thus avoiding unnecessary in-depth examination. Pest categorization can be done with relatively little information, provided that the information available is sufficient to carry out the categorization.|$|R

5|$|Viruses and <b>pests</b> affect {{yield of}} Bt cotton varieties.

5|$|A {{trap crop}} is {{a crop of}} a plant that attracts <b>pests,</b> {{diverting}} them from nearby crops. <b>Pests</b> aggregated on the trap crop can be more easily controlled using pesticides or other methods. However, trap-cropping, on its own, has often failed to cost effectively reduce pest densities on large commercial scales, {{without the use of}} pesticides, possibly due to the pests' ability to disperse back into the main field.|$|E
50|$|For a {{quarantine}} <b>pest,</b> <b>pest</b> {{risk management}} {{is the process}} of evaluation and selection of options {{to reduce the risk of}} introduction and spread of the <b>pest.</b> Conclusions from the <b>pest</b> risk assessment (Stage 2) are used to support decisions regarding the level of risk presented by the <b>pest.</b> If a <b>pest</b> is judged to present an unacceptable risk then phytosanitary measures should be identified that will reduce the risk to an acceptable level. Phytosanitary measures should accord with IPPC principles of necessity, managed risk, minimal impact, transparency, harmonization, non-discrimination and technical justification.|$|R
40|$|The {{traditional}} approach to <b>pest</b> management {{is to treat}} the crop or commodity in a particular management unit before an economically significant infestation of the <b>pest</b> has developed. Determining {{the need to take}} corrective action is based on the economic threshold concept, which forms the basis of most integrated <b>pest</b> management programmes (Metcalf and Luckman, 1975). Areawide <b>pest</b> management (AWPM) can be contrasted with traditional <b>pest</b> management in that <b>pest</b> management tactics are used over a broad spatial area, often treating the whole area simultaneously to maintain the <b>pest</b> below economic levels or, in some cases, completely eradicate it. A WPM has potential advantages over the {{traditional approach}}. Suppression across a broad area may result in reduced reinfestation by migration from nearby unmanaged areas, and the <b>pest</b> management tactics employed may be more effective, particularly ecologically based tactics, when applied areawide...|$|R
40|$|Apple {{production}} in the Midwest requires very intensive, chemically-based <b>pest</b> management systems {{in order to bring}} quality, fresh market apples to consumers. Current systems of apple <b>pest</b> management have become ineffective and have fallen out of favor with growers, due to a combination of rising costs, <b>pest</b> resistance, and government regulation. New <b>pest</b> control methods must meet several criteria in order to be adopted by growers,such as adequate <b>pest</b> control, applicator safety, minimal environmental impact, and above all, economic viability. In this study, four apple <b>pest</b> management systems were compared for control of codling moth, apple scab, and sooty blotch and flyspeck (SBFS) ...|$|R

5|$|Bacteria {{used for}} {{biological}} control infect insects via their digestive tracts, so they offer only limited options for controlling insects with sucking mouth parts such as aphids and scale insects. Bacillus thuringiensis {{is the most}} widely applied species of bacteria used for biological control, with at least four sub-species used against Lepidopteran (moth, butterfly), Coleopteran (beetle) and Dipteran (true fly) insect <b>pests.</b> The bacterium is available to organic farmers in sachets of dried spores which are mixed with water and sprayed onto vulnerable plants such as brassicas and fruit trees. Genes from B. thuringiensis have also been incorporated into transgenic crops, making the plants express some of the bacterium's toxins, which are proteins. These confer resistance to insect <b>pests</b> and thus reduce the necessity for pesticide use. If <b>pests</b> develop resistance to the toxins in these crops, B. thuringiensis will become useless in organic farming also.|$|E
40|$|Using real options, {{this paper}} formulates an optimal {{stopping}} model for applying <b>pest</b> control measures when {{the density of}} a <b>pest</b> population varies randomly. A delay between successive pesticide applications is introduced to analyze the farmer’s expected marginal cost of reentry. This model {{is applied to the}} control of a foliar <b>pest</b> of apples via a pesticide, and solved numerically. A sensitivity analysis shows that the <b>pest</b> density that should trigger pesticide use can vary significantly with the <b>pest</b> density volatility. Incorporating <b>pest</b> randomness into simple decision rules may thus help better manage the chemicals applied to soils and crop...|$|R
50|$|When {{assessing}} the likelihood {{and magnitude of}} <b>pest</b> spread, the <b>pest’s</b> ability to disperse from a point of introduction to new areas within the <b>pest</b> risk analysis area is assessed. The assessment should consider <b>pest</b> population dynamics and the natural mobility of the <b>pest</b> and take into account potential spread via wind, water, soil, seed and pollen, and insect, fungal or nematode vectors as well as spread via human activities such as movement of host material.|$|R
40|$|We examine {{regulations}} for managing <b>pest</b> resistance to pesticide varieties in a temporally and spatially explicit framework. We compare {{the performance of}} the EPA's mandatory refuges and a tax (or subsidy) on the pesticide variety under several biological assumptions on <b>pest</b> mobility and the heterogeneity of farmers' <b>pest</b> vulnerability. We find that only the tax (or subsidy) restores efficiency if <b>pest</b> mobility is perfect within the area. If <b>pest</b> mobility is imperfect and when farmers face identical <b>pest</b> vulnerability, only the refuge might restore efficiency. With simulations we illustrate that complex outcomes may arise for intermediate levels of <b>pest</b> mobility and farmers' heterogeneity. Our results shed light on the choice of regulatory instruments for common-pool resource regulations where spatial localization matters...|$|R
5|$|Beetles are {{prominent}} in human culture, from the sacred scarabs of ancient Egypt to beetlewing art and use as pets or fighting insects for entertainment and gambling. Many beetle groups are brightly and attractively coloured making them objects of collection and decorative displays. Over 300 species {{are used as}} food, mostly as larvae; species widely consumed include mealworms and rhinoceros beetle larvae. However, the major impact of beetles on human life is as agricultural, forestry, and horticultural <b>pests.</b> Serious <b>pests</b> include the boll weevil of cotton, the Colorado potato beetle, the coconut hispine beetle, and the mountain pine beetle. Most beetles, however, do not cause economic damage and many, such as the lady beetles and dung beetles are beneficial by helping to control insect <b>pests.</b>|$|E
5|$|Beetles can be {{beneficial}} to human economics by controlling the populations of <b>pests.</b> The larvae and adults of some species of lady beetles (Coccinellidae) feed on aphids that are <b>pests.</b> Other lady beetles feed on scale insects, whitefly and mealybugs. If normal food sources are scarce, they may feed on small caterpillars, young plant bugs, or honeydew and nectar. Ground beetles (Carabidae) are common predators of many insect <b>pests,</b> including fly eggs, caterpillars, and wireworms. Ground beetles can help to control weeds by eating their seeds in the soil, reducing the need for herbicides to protect crops. The effectiveness of some species in reducing certain plant populations {{has resulted in the}} deliberate introduction of beetles in order to control weeds. For example, the genus Zygogramma is native to North America but has been used to control Parthenium hysterophorus in India and Ambrosia artemisiifolia in Russia.|$|E
