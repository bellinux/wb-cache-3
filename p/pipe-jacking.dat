40|$|In {{order to}} solve the water sealing problem of soil between pipes of long {{distance}} curved <b>pipe-jacked</b> technology, Freeze-Sealing Pipe Roof (FSPR) as an innovative pre-supporting method in tunnel engineering is being applied to the Gongbei Tunnel in the Hong Kong-Zhuhai-Macau Bridge. The definition of FSPR is that large diameter steel pipes are {{laid out in a}} circle around the cross section of tunnel in advance, then the artificial ground freezing method is adopted to freeze soil between steel pipes to form water-sealing curtain. An effective freeze control system, which contains master freezing tubes, enhancing freezing tubes and limiting freezing tubes, is established for building up the frozen soil curtain, maintaining its stability during excavation and controlling the volume of frozen soil to limit frost heave dynamically. An in-situ test was carried out to explore the optimal freezing scheme and control mode. The results of the test show that the principal freezing scheme of the solid pipe with hollow pipe as a complement is the most optimal scheme in active freezing phase of the real construction. Meanwhile, cold control mode is suggested to control frost heave in maintained freezing phase. The conclusions have important guiding significance for this kind of engineering construction...|$|R
40|$|The {{reported}} work {{constituted the}} third phase of a programme of research into the performance of concrete pipes during installation by the <b>pipe-jacked</b> tunnelling technique. This third stage was {{a continuation of the}} on-site monitoring of full-scale pipe jacks during construction. Four schemes were monitored in different ground conditions: London clay, dense fine sand below the water table, stiff glacial till and soft alluvial clay. Pipe sizes ranged from 1000 mm to 1800 mm internal diameter and excavation methods included hand tools, slurry machines and an open face tunnel boring machine. The main objective was to collect information on jacking loads and stresses at the pipe-soil interface to provide a better basis for future designs. This was achieved by building twelve stress cells -capable of measuring total normal stresses, shear stresses and pore pressures - into the wall of a standard concrete jacking pipe that could be inserted anywhere in the pipe string. Jacking loads and forward movement of the pipe string were simultaneously recorded and the results were correlated against site activities, including lubrication operations, and tunnel alignment surveys. Another objective was to monitor the ground response by measuring displacements around the tunnel and ground pressures above the perpendicular to the intended line. Ground movements were measured using conventional surveying techniques for surface settlements, and inclinometer access tubes for sub-surface deformation. On one scheme, electro-levels were employed in a near-horizontal tube to measure centre line settlement as the tunnel bore advanced. Push-in spade cells and pneumatic piezometers were installed on two schemes to measure the change in horizontal pressures {{with the passage of the}} shield. Because of the myriad data collected, it has only been possible to present a summary of the results obtained. Jacking force records from all the monitored schemes - including the previous fieldwork stage - are presented. The pattern of jacking load build up and the magnitude of frictional resistance can differ significantly according to the type of ground and use of lubricants. Stress measurements at the pipe-soil interface show that the interaction between jacking loads, pipeline misalignment, stoppages, lubrication, excavation technique etc, is highly complex. Ground movement measurements compared to well established empirical predictive methods show that short-term displacements are related to ground losses caused by closure of the overbreak void between shield and pipe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: <b>Pipe-jacking</b> {{method has}} been widely used in {{municipal}} engineering for its relatively simpler equipment and lower environment impacts. Since intact sections were used in traditional pipes, their application is restrained by transportation when the diameter is too large. A split prefabricated <b>pipe-jacking</b> structure design method is proposed in this paper. The traditional intact pipe section is split into several segments for assembling in the construction site, which can solve the transportation and stocking problem.

40|$|Prediction of jacking forces {{has been}} {{well-established}} for <b>pipe-jacking</b> drives traversing soils. However, the accrual of jacking forces for drives negotiating weathered rock formations {{has not been}} well understood. Three <b>pipe-jacking</b> drives in Kuching City, Malaysia spanning weathered lithological units of sandstone, phyllite and shale were studied. In the absence of in-situ pressuremeter testing during the investigation stage, tunneling rock spoils were collected and characterized through direct shear testing. The “generalized tangential” technique {{was applied to the}} nonlinear direct shear test results to obtain linear Mohr–Coulomb parameters, c′p and ϕ′p. This allowed for back-analysis of frictional coefficient, μavg {{through the use of a}} well-established predictive jacking force model. The reliability of using c′p, ϕ′p and μavg was assessed through 3 D finite element modeling of the studied <b>pipe-jacking</b> drives. Based on these parameters, the results obtained from the numerical analyses of the studied <b>pipe-jacking</b> drives show good agreement with the jacking forces measured in-situ. The outcome of this research demonstrates that the derived strength parameters from direct shear testing of tunneling rock spoils has the potential to be used as reliable input parameters in finite element modeling to predict <b>pipe-jacking</b> forces in highly weathered geological formations...|$|E
40|$|The {{installation}} of underground trunk sewer {{lines in the}} Tuang formation of Kuching City, Malaysia, used trenchless technology {{in the form of}} the <b>pipe-jacking</b> method. The evaluation of <b>pipe-jacking</b> forces mainly involves empirical models developed for soils, with rather limited considerations for drives through weathered rock. Therefore, a novel approach is proposed to evaluate strength parameters by reconstituting and subsequently shearing scalped tunneling rock spoils in the direct shear apparatus. The direct shear results are then applied to a well-established <b>pipe-jacking</b> force model, which considers arching theory. The outcomes indicate that the backanalyzed frictional coefficients &# 0956;avg are not only reliable but also related to their surrounding geologies because of soil-structure interaction. This study also highlights the significance of lubrication and effect of rock arching in assessing jacking forces. The successful characterization of reconstituted tunneling rock spoils in this paper has shown potential use in assessing jacking forces during microtunneling works...|$|E
40|$|Construction {{simulation}} {{and traffic}} simulation are complementary to successful planning of microtunneling and <b>pipe-jacking</b> operations in urban areas. With increasing concerns on sustainable development, {{it is imperative}} to integrate construction engineering and traffic engineering in simulation modeling in order to plan for efficient site operations while reducing the impact of construction upon traffic. In this research, we demonstrate a “larger system simulation ” approach to effectively plan <b>pipe-jacking</b> operations in urban areas in considerations of (1) truck delivery routes and timing; (2) sizing and location of temporary laydown area on site; (3) traffic lane closure distance; and (4) working hours scheduling, aimed at minimizing the negative impact of construction on traffic. Our research goal is to deliver a temporary traffic arrangement plan along with an efficient site operations plan, thus keeping a balance between construction productivity and traffic mobility.

40|$|Lubricants are {{frequently}} applied in <b>pipe-jacking,</b> especially under difficult geological conditions or {{in cases of}} a longer alignment. The main purpose of lubricant application {{is to reduce the}} friction between pipe and soil. However, {{it is very difficult to}} quantitatively determine the real contact conditions between the two. New technology for soil-pipe interaction measurement is still scarce and requires further development. Only indirect methods are available for practical measurement of soil-pipe interaction, and engineering judgment is required for the application of those measurements. In this study, a simple test method was applied to obtain the frictional properties of the most popular lubricants in the Taiwan area. Those frictional properties were used for jacking force estimation and numerical analysis of soil-pipe interaction for linear and curved <b>pipe-jacking.</b> The analyses of jacking force show that reduction in jacking force is closely related to reduction in friction coefficients, and the effect of lubrication is slightly more significant in the case of curved alignment than the case of linear alignment. In addition, a study of a 400 -m linear <b>pipe-jacking</b> case in the Taichung Science Park shows overestimation of the jacking force by an empirical formula. It reveals the reduction in pipe-soil contact area induced by over-cutting is significant for <b>pipe-jacking</b> in gravel formations. (C) 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E

40|$|The {{continued}} growth of urban environments {{has brought about}} the advent of trenchless technology as the ideal installation method for buried infrastructure in densely populated urban areas, such as the city of Kuching. Kuching is the state capital of Sarawak, located on the Malaysian island of Borneo. For the construction of concrete sewer lines in the central business district of Kuching, Malaysia micro-tunneling by <b>pipe-jacking</b> was the utilized delivery method. Jacking forces are {{a critical component of}} planning for <b>pipe-jacking</b> works as jacking forces govern the drive span. Excessive jacking forces could also result in damaged jacked pipes. Thus, further understanding of pipe-soil jacking forces is necessary, and needs to be defined within the specific geology of Kuching. The low RQD values produced during rock core extraction created challenges in obtaining intact cores for rock strength testing.

40|$|With {{the urban}} rapid development, it is {{necessary}} to build a variety of public facilities including underground lifelines. However, due to the existing heavy traffic, it is difficult to obtain additional space for open-cut installation of pipelines. Therefore, the No-Dig method was developed and applied. No-Dig method often encounters difficult geological problems, which makes the excavation in difficulty and thus affecting the construction schedule. Taichung area is majorly covered by gravel alluvium, in which the strata contains large gravels. Those large size gravels often result in excessive wear and increase in construction cost. In this paper, we took samples from the launch shaft of <b>pipe-jacking</b> projects in Taichung and carried out sieve analyses. Then we transformed the size distribution into borehole data by the newly derived formula. The obtained borehole data was applied to the T-PROGS geostatistic analysis. The purpose of the geostatistic analysis is to building a 3 D geological model by the data from <b>pipe-jacking</b> shaft, then we can obtain the geological and size distribution parameters along the <b>pipe-jacking</b> alignment. In this study, the analysis was performed for different scenerios and the impact of material changes on the pipe jacking rate. The results show that the change of gravel particles larger than 20 cm is highly correlated with pipe jacking rate. In addition, we also tried to use the image analysis to replace the large scale sieving test. Through the image software ”Image J”, we carried out the image sieve analysis, and compared with the size distribution from the original sieving test. And the results suggest that it is feasible to apply the image sieve analysis to replace the in situ sieve analysis. 隨著都市與工業快速發展，需興建各種地下化維生管線之公共設施，但基於現有都市交通壅擠、地下維生管線日益複雜，增設管線空間取得不易，因此免開挖工法便因應而生。免開挖工法經常遭遇到困難地質問題，使得開挖不易進而影響施工進度。台中地質屬於卵礫石沖積層，地層中含許多大型卵礫石，常造成推進過程機頭過度磨耗，造成施工本增加，本研究針對台中之推進工程之地質問題進行研究。 本研究利用現地工程案例推進坑進行地質材料取樣並進行篩分析，再透過自行推導之公式修正轉換為鑽孔柱狀圖數據後，輸入GMS之子程式T-PROGS進行分析。分析之目的在於以工作井之數據來建立三維地質模型，進而求取推進過程中可能遭遇之地質及粒徑條件，分析各種建模狀況，並透過與實際工程案例比較，探討其內部材料分佈對推進速率之影響，結果顯示，粒徑大於 20 公分之材料其變化趨勢與推進速率有高度相關性。 此外，本研究簡單的測試利用於推進坑取得之開挖璧影像，透過影像軟體ImageJ擷取顆粒後進行影像篩分析，觀察比較其結果與真實現地篩分析之差別，討論差異所在，並探討以影像篩分析取代大型篩分析之可行性，結果顯示以面積單位做完篩分析之過篩單位較符合真實現地篩分析粒徑分布。誌謝	I 摘要	II ABSTRACT	III 目錄	IV 表目錄	VII 圖目錄	VIII 第一章 緒論	 1 1. 1 前言	 1 1. 2 研究動機與目的	 3 1. 3 研究方法	 4 1. 4 論文架構	 5 第二章 文獻回顧	 6 2. 1 地質統計學簡介	 6 2. 1. 1 地質統計學之相關文獻	 6 2. 2 轉移機率(Transition Probability) 理論簡介	 7 2. 2. 1 轉移機率(Transition Probability) 理論相關文獻	 8 2. 3 GMS與T-PROGS數值分析軟體之簡介	 10 2. 3. 1 GMS與T-PROGS數值分析軟體之相關文獻	 10 第三章 研究方法	 13 3. 1 現地取樣及篩分析試驗	 13 3. 1. 1 大型篩分析試驗	 13 3. 1. 2 試驗流程	 14 3. 2 粒徑分佈轉換有效鑽孔數據值	 15 3. 2. 1 一維有效粒徑	 15 3. 2. 2 二維及三維有效粒徑推導	 15 3. 2. 3 粒徑分佈轉換有效鑽孔數據	 18 3. 3 T-PROGS分析	 21 3. 3. 1 T-PROGS分析理論	 21 3. 3. 2 T-PROGS 分析流程	 27 3. 4 影像篩分析	 29 第四章 篩分析分析結果	 30 4. 1 大型篩分析試驗結果	 30 4. 2 粒徑分佈轉換鑽孔數據與修正粒徑分佈結果	 30 第五章 T-PROGS分析結果與討論	 32 5. 1 自行建模敏感性模擬	 32 5. 1. 1 考慮空間觀點之比較結果	 32 5. 1. 2 考慮推進機具管徑之比較結果	 34 5. 1. 3 考慮整體觀點之比較結果	 35 5. 1. 4 結果討論	 36 5. 2 實際案例之分析探討	 38 5. 2. 1 實際案例分析結果	 39 5. 2. 2 實際案例應用與推進率關係之比較	 39 5. 2. 3 結果討論	 40 5. 3 利用影像軟體進行篩分析	 41 5. 3. 1 分析簡介	 41 5. 3. 2 影像篩分析結果	 43 5. 3. 3 結果討論	 43 第六章 結果討論	 45 6. 1 結論	 45 6. 2 建議	 47 參考文獻	 4...|$|E
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to develop}} an alternative solution to computing the three-axis orientations of a tunnel-boring machine (TBM) during microtunneling and <b>pipe-jacking</b> operations. Comprehensive geometric foundations are given {{to shed light on}} the computing mechanism for deriving the TBM's three rotation angles of yaw, pitch, and roll through surveying a limited quantity of observation points on the TBM. Two well-established computing algorithms in space science are elaborated, including the deterministic triaxis attitude determination (TRIAD) algorithm and the optimal quaternion method. MonteCarlo simulations are conducted to assess the accuracies on the orientations determined by the two algorithms, given (1) different levels of point surveying errors and (2) varying distances between observation points. In relation to microtunneling applications, four layout options for fixing the observation points on the TBM are designed and evaluated.

40|$|A {{series of}} tests has been {{undertaken}} {{on a variety of}} different soils to understand how soil cuttings disaggregate when pumped from the tunnel face to the separation plant during slurry tunnelling for pipe jacked tunnels.

In <b>pipe-jacking</b> operations this liquid is normally water, which is recirculated after the soil has been re-moved to minimise and if possible eliminate the production of liquid waste. The paper will present results from a series of “mixing tests”, devised by the authors to investigate disaggregation, and also from standard laboratory tests undertaken to establish basic soil properties such as soil strength.

40|$|<b>Pipe-jacking</b> {{operations}} at Silvertondale uncovered human {{remains at the}} end of a tunnel 38. 8 m long and approximately 2. 42 m below the surface. These were most probably in a grave that was covered by material during the construction of the modern rail bridge over the Moreletta spruit. The construction of the embankment at the eastern side of the newer bridge most probably covered the grave which was just to the south of the 1886 NAZM railway on the eastern bank of the spruit. The remains were fragmentary and poorly preserved and thus difficult to recover. The individual was buried in a coffin, in an extended supine position on its back. The position of the limbs could not be securely determined. Sex determination was carried out in situ. The remains were that of a female, as determined from the wide sciatic notch, presence of a pre-auricular sulcus and gracile facial features. The medial epiphysis of the right clavicle was fused and thus she was most likely older than 30 years. Some cranial suture closure was evident. The shape of the mandibular ramus and nose indicates Caucasoid descent, although other features such as the presence of a low and long skull are more consistent with that of Negroid affinity. Further analysis is needed in this regard. The individual was approximately 168. 1 cm tall. No signs of trauma or chronic disease were noted, but pelvic scarring suggests that she gave birth to at least one child. Several beads and pieces of a safety pin were found with the remains. These were submitted for expert analyses which may help in dating the remains. It is suggested that the individual might be related to the early pioneer families of Pretoria. Further investigation in this regard still needs to take place. Poster presented at the University of Pretoria Health Sciences Faculty Day, August 2008, Pretoria, South Africa...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{develops}} analytical {{solutions for}} estimating the bending moments and axial loads in a buried pipeline due to ground movements caused by tunnel construction in soft ground. The solutions combine closed-form, analytical solutions for tunnel-induced, free-field ground deformations {{in a plane}} orthogonal to the heading (Pinto and Whittle; 2001) with Winkler models for pipe-soil interactions. The free-field ground deformations are {{described in terms of}} two parameters describing the modes of cavity deformation and the elastic Poisson's ratio of the ground. The solutions have been evaluated by others through comparisons with well-instrumented case studies for a variety of different tunneling construction methods and ground conditions. Analytical approximations for the vertical and horizontal spring stiffness coefficients in the Winkler models are interpreted from numerical finite element analyses. The proposed analyses are compared with prior solutions proposed by Vorster (2005) and Klar et al. (2005) that rely on empirical procedures to estimate the ground deformations and focus only on bending response of the pipeline. The current research provides independent validation of the vertical spring coefficient proposed by Klar et al., and derives a novel interpretation of the horizontal spring coefficient. Results of the proposed analyses are presented graphically in design charts that show the deformations of the pipeline as functions of the pipe and tunnel geometry, tunnel cavity parameters, elastic properties of the ground and relative pipe-soil rigidity parameters. The solutions are used to re-analyze the deformations of a water main associated with a <b>pipe-jacking</b> procedure at an instrumented site in Chingford, London reported by Vorster (2005). The thesis also presents a hypothetical example that considers the impacts of the construction of a largediameter sewer tunnel in soft clay using EPB construction methods (using free-field performance data from the N- 2 project in San Francisco) on existing utilities. In this case, potential damage to cast-iron water pipes is clearly linked to the pipe section properties and the EPB tunnel face pressure. Data from well-documented case studies must now be obtained to validate the proposed analyses. by Evangelia S. leronymaki. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|The {{frictional}} {{behavior of}} soil-construction material interfaces is of significant importance in geotechnical engineering {{applications such as}} retaining structures, pile foundations, geosynthetic liners, and trenchless technologies. Since most failures initiate and develop on the interfaces, special attention is required to predict the capacity of these weak planes in the particular application. <b>Pipe-jacking</b> and microtunneling technologies are being more widely used {{over the past decade}} and there is significant interest to predict the jacking forces and jacking distances achievable in order to achieve more efficient design and construction. This study focuses on the evaluation of the frictional characteristics and factors affecting the shear strength of pipe-soil interfaces. Eight different pipes made from fiber reinforced polymer (FRP), polycrete, steel, concrete, and vitrified clay were tested in the experimental program. For this purpose, a new apparatus was designed to conduct conventional interface direct shear testing on pipes of different curvature. This device allows coupons cut from actual conduits and pipes to be tested in the laboratory under controlled conditions. The apparatus includes a double-wall shear box, the inner wall of which is interchangeable to allow for testing against surfaces of different curvatures. By considering a narrow width section, the circular interface of pipes was approximated with a surface along the axial direction and the boundary is defined by the inner box. Roughness tests were performed using a stylus profilometer to quantify the surface characteristics of the individual pipes and relate these to the interface shear behavior. The surface topography showed different degrees of variability for the different pipes. To extend the range of roughness values tested and force the failure to occur in the particulate media adjacent to the interface, two artificial pipe surfaces were created using rough sandpapers. Interface shear tests were performed using the new apparatus with air-pluviated dense specimens of Ottawa 20 / 30 sand. Additional tests were performed using Atlanta blasting sand to evaluate the effect of particle angularity. The effect of normal stress and relative density were also examined. The interface strength was shown to increase with surface roughness and finally reach a constant value above a certain critical roughness value, which corresponded to the internal strength of the soil itself. This represented the failure location moving from the interface into the soil adjacent to the interface. Both the strength and the shearing mechanism were thus affected by the surface topography. It was also shown that the interface shear strength was affected by particle angularity, relative density and normal stress. M. S.
