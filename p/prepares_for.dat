40|$|Background: Postgraduate medical {{education}} training programs strive to prepare their trainees optimally for independent practice. Several studies have shown, however, that new consultants feel inadequately <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> practice, {{and that this}} {{increases the risk of}} stress and burnout. Aim: To analyze across specialties for which tasks and themes new consultants feel inadequately prepared. And, to identify themes that need improved attention in postgraduate {{medical education}} programs or after registration. Methods: 330 New consultants from all hospital specialities with accredited training programs who completed their training in the north-eastern educational region of The Netherlands between 2004 and 2010 received a questionnaire which was based on a previously validated generic task inventory. Results: 143 respondents (43 %) returned the questionnaire. They felt excellently <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> 40 tasks, well <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> 25 tasks, marginally sufficiently <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> 18 tasks and insufficiently <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> 8 tasks. Preparedness scores were lowest for tasks concerning management administration and leadership, research, end-of-life care, and patient safety-related communication. Surgical specialists felt better <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> practice than medical specialists, which could not be explained by differences in general self-efficacy. Conclusion: Although new consultants felt well <b>prepared</b> <b>for</b> medical tasks, the scores of more generic tasks indicate that the alignment between the different phases of the medical education continuum and independent practice needs improvement...|$|R
