5|$|Art has {{sometimes}} stimulated {{the development of}} mathematics, as when Brunelleschi's theory of perspective in architecture and painting started a cycle of research {{that led to the}} work of Brook Taylor and Johann Heinrich Lambert on the mathematical foundations of perspective drawing, and ultimately to the mathematics of <b>projective</b> <b>geometry</b> of Girard Desargues and Jean-Victor Poncelet.|$|E
5|$|Geometry was {{a second}} field in which groups were used systematically, {{especially}} symmetry groups as part of Felix Klein's 1872 Erlangen program. After novel geometries such as hyperbolic and <b>projective</b> <b>geometry</b> had emerged, Klein used group theory to organize them in a more coherent way. Further advancing these ideas, Sophus Lie founded the study of Lie groups in 1884.|$|E
5|$|Von Neumann {{founded the}} field of {{continuous}} geometry based on lattice theoretic principles. Earlier, Menger and Birkhoff had axiomatized complex <b>projective</b> <b>geometry</b> {{in terms of the}} properties of its lattice of linear subspaces. Von Neumann, following his work on rings of operators, weakened those axioms to describe a broader class of lattices, the continuous geometries.|$|E
40|$|Fuzzy {{geometry}} is {{an outgrowth}} of crisp geometry, which in crisp geometry elements are exist and not exist, but also while on fuzzy geometry elements are developed by thickness {{which is owned by}} each of these elements. Crisp <b>projective</b> <b>geometries</b> is the formation of a shadow of geometries element projected on the projectors element, with perpendicular properties which are represented by their respective elemental, the discussion focused on the results of the projection coordinates. While the fuzzy <b>projective</b> <b>geometries</b> have richer discussion, which includes about coordinates of projection results, the mutual relation of each element and the thickness of each element. This research was conducted to describe and analyzing procedure fuzzy <b>projective</b> <b>geometries</b> on the plane and explain the differences between crisp <b>projective</b> <b>geometries</b> and fuzzy <b>projective</b> <b>geometries</b> on plane...|$|R
40|$|AbstractGiven a finite-dimensional vector spaceV, we {{construct}} {{a family of}} <b>projective</b> <b>geometries</b> whose flats are certain subspaces ofV, and {{show that there is}} a one-to-one correspondence between this family of <b>projective</b> <b>geometries</b> and the set of equivalence classes of tensor decompositions ofV. This provides a practical method for finding a tensor decomposition of a finite-dimensionalKG-module or proving that no nontrivial tensor decomposition exists...|$|R

5|$|Other {{relationships}} {{include the}} algorithmic analysis of artworks by X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy, {{the finding that}} traditional batiks from different regions of Java have distinct fractal dimensions, and stimuli to mathematics research, especially Filippo Brunelleschi's theory of perspective, which eventually led to Girard Desargues's <b>projective</b> <b>geometry.</b> A persistent view, based ultimately on the Pythagorean notion of harmony in music, holds that everything was arranged by Number, that God is the geometer of the world, and that therefore the world's geometry is sacred, as seen in artworks such as William Blake's The Ancient of Days.|$|E
25|$|<b>Projective</b> <b>geometry</b> was {{emphasized}} as {{the unifying}} frame {{for all other}} geometries considered by him. In particular, Euclidean geometry was more restrictive than affine geometry, {{which in turn is}} more restrictive than <b>projective</b> <b>geometry.</b>|$|E
25|$|While {{the ideas}} were {{available}} earlier, <b>projective</b> <b>geometry</b> was mainly a {{development of the}} 19th century. This included the theory of complex projective space, the coordinates used (homogeneous coordinates) being complex numbers. Several major types of more abstract mathematics (including invariant theory, the Italian school of algebraic geometry, and Felix Klein's Erlangen programme resulting {{in the study of}} the classical groups) were based on <b>projective</b> <b>geometry.</b> It was also a subject with a large number of practitioners for its own sake, as synthetic geometry. Another topic that developed from axiomatic studies of <b>projective</b> <b>geometry</b> is finite geometry.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{we study}} the {{connections}} between linear codes and <b>projective</b> <b>geometries</b> over finite fields. Often good codes come from interesting structures in <b>projective</b> <b>geometries.</b> For example, MDS codes come from arcs (i. e. sets of points which are extremal {{in the sense that}} they admit no other than the obvious dependencies). In addition, we take a closer look at ovals and hyperovals in projective planes and ovoids in projective 3 -spaces. In particular, we examine Glynn’s condition for the existence of hyperovals...|$|R
25|$|The only <b>projective</b> <b>geometry</b> of {{dimension}} 0 is {{a single}} point. A <b>projective</b> <b>geometry</b> of dimension 1 consists of a single line containing at least 3 points. The geometric construction of arithmetic operations cannot be performed in either of these cases. For dimension 2, there is a rich structure in virtue {{of the absence of}} Desargues' Theorem.|$|E
25|$|Properties {{meaningful}} for <b>projective</b> <b>geometry</b> {{are respected}} by this new idea of transformation, {{which is more}} radical in its effects than can be expressed by a transformation matrix and translations (the affine transformations). The first issue for geometers {{is what kind of}} geometry is adequate for a novel situation. It is not possible to refer to angles in <b>projective</b> <b>geometry</b> as it is in Euclidean geometry, because angle {{is an example of a}} concept not invariant with respect to projective transformations, as is seen in perspective drawing. One source for <b>projective</b> <b>geometry</b> was indeed the theory of perspective. Another difference from elementary geometry is the way in which parallel lines can be said to meet in a point at infinity, once the concept is translated into projective geometry's terms. Again this notion has an intuitive basis, such as railway tracks meeting at the horizon in a perspective drawing. See projective plane for the basics of <b>projective</b> <b>geometry</b> in two dimensions.|$|E

40|$|In the {{presented}} work {{we define}} {{a class of}} error-correcting codes based on incidence vectors of <b>projective</b> <b>geometries,</b> including the necessary basis of coding theory and <b>projective</b> <b>geometries.</b> A detailed calculation is performed to show the dimension of these codes. In conclusion we concern ourselves with majority decoding. This work is {{a summary of the}} results of some known authors engaged in this field. We continue on some of these results and we present evidence of some of the statements, which have been proven differently by other authors...|$|R

25|$|The {{parallel}} {{property of}} elliptic geometry {{is the key}} idea {{that leads to the}} principle of projective duality, possibly the most important property that all <b>projective</b> <b>geometries</b> have in common.|$|R
25|$|With every geometry, Felix Klein {{associated}} {{an underlying}} group of symmetries. The hierarchy of geometries is thus mathematically {{represented as a}} hierarchy of these groups, and hierarchy of their invariants. For example, lengths, angles and areas are preserved {{with respect to the}} Euclidean group of symmetries, while only the incidence structure and the cross-ratio are preserved under the most general projective transformations. A concept of parallelism, which is preserved in affine geometry, is not meaningful in <b>projective</b> <b>geometry.</b> Then, by abstracting the underlying groups of symmetries from the geometries, the relationships between them can be re-established at the group level. Since the group of affine geometry is a subgroup of the group of <b>projective</b> <b>geometry,</b> any notion invariant in <b>projective</b> <b>geometry</b> is a priori meaningful in affine geometry; but not the other way round. If you add required symmetries, you have a more powerful theory but fewer concepts and theorems (which will be deeper and more general).|$|E
25|$|In 1957, Jacques Tits {{introduced}} {{the theory of}} buildings, which relate algebraic groups to abstract simplicial complexes. One of the assumptions is a non-triviality condition: If the building is an n-dimensional abstract simplicial complex, and if , then every k-simplex of the building must be contained {{in at least three}} n-simplices. This is analogous to the condition in classical <b>projective</b> <b>geometry</b> that a line must contain at least three points. However, there are degenerate geometries which satisfy all the conditions to be a <b>projective</b> <b>geometry</b> except that the lines admit only two points. The analogous objects in the theory of buildings are called apartments. Apartments play such a constituent role in the theory of buildings that Tits conjectured the existence of a theory of <b>projective</b> <b>geometry</b> in which the degenerate geometries would have equal standing with the classical ones. This geometry would take place, he said, over a field of characteristic one. Using this analogy it was possible to describe some of the elementary properties of F1, but {{it was not possible to}} construct it.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 17th century, {{there were two}} {{important}} developments in geometry. The {{first and most important}} was the creation of analytic geometry, or geometry with coordinates and equations, by René Descartes (1596–1650) and Pierre de Fermat (1601–1665). This was a necessary precursor to the development of calculus and a precise quantitative science of physics. The second geometric development of this period was the systematic study of <b>projective</b> <b>geometry</b> by Girard Desargues (1591–1661). <b>Projective</b> <b>geometry</b> is the study of geometry without measurement, just the study of how points align with each other. There had been some early work in this area by Hellenistic geometers, notably Pappus (c. 340). The greatest flowering of the field occurred with Jean-Victor Poncelet (1788–1867).|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} hypergroups which arise from association schemes in a canonical way; {{this class of}} hypergroups is called realizable. We first study basic algebraic properties of realizable hypergroups. Then we prove that two interesting classes of hypergroups (partition hypergroups and linearly ordered hypergroups) are realizable. Along the way, we prove that a certain class of <b>projective</b> <b>geometries</b> {{is equipped with a}} canonical association scheme structure which allows us to link three objects; association schemes, hypergroups, and <b>projective</b> <b>geometries.</b> Comment: Section 6 is removed and the preprint is reduced to its essentials.

40|$|We {{investigate}} how <b>projective</b> plane <b>geometry</b> can be formalized in a proof assistant such as Coq. Such a formalization increases {{the reliability of}} textbook proofs whose details and particular cases are often overlooked and left to the reader as exercises. <b>Projective</b> plane <b>geometry</b> is described through two different axiom systems which are formally proved equivalent. Usual properties such as decidability of equality of points (and lines) are then proved in a constructive way. The duality principle as well as formal models of <b>projective</b> plane <b>geometry</b> are then studied and implemented in Coq. Finally, we formally prove in Coq that Desargues’ property is independent of the axioms of <b>projective</b> plane <b>geometry...</b>|$|R
50|$|The {{earliest}} {{application of}} the concept of near-field was in the study of <b>geometries,</b> such as <b>projective</b> <b>geometries.</b> Many <b>projective</b> <b>geometries</b> can be defined in terms of a coordinate system over a division ring, but others can't. It was found that by allowing coordinates from any near-ring the range of geometries which could be coordinatized was extended. For example, Marshall Hall used the near-field of order 9 given above to produce a Hall plane, the first of a sequence of such planes based on Dickson near-fields of order the square of a prime. In 1971 T. G. Room and P.B. Kirkpatrick provided an alternative development.|$|R
25|$|The {{topic of}} <b>projective</b> <b>geometry</b> is itself now divided into many {{research}} subtopics, {{two examples of}} which are projective algebraic geometry (the study of projective varieties) and projective differential geometry (the study of differential invariants of the projective transformations).|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} <b>projective</b> <b>geometries,</b> {{which may be}} divided into {{discrete}} and continuous: a discrete geometry comprises a set of points, {{which may or may}} not be finite in number, while a continuous geometry has infinitely many points with no gaps in between.|$|R
25|$|This {{treatment}} of the Riemann sphere connects most readily to <b>projective</b> <b>geometry.</b> For example, any line (or smooth conic) in the complex projective plane is biholomorphic to the complex projective line.

25|$|In 1815, {{the year}} after his release, Poncelet was {{employed}} a military engineer at his hometown of Metz. In 1822, while at this position, he published Traité des propriétés projectives des figures.

It is considered the founding work of modern <b>projective</b> <b>geometry.</b> Joseph Diaz Gergonne also wrote about this branch of geometry at approximately the same time, beginning in 1810. Poncelet published several papers about the subject in Annales de Gergonne (officially known as Annales de mathématiques pures et appliquées).

In the finite-dimensional case over K R, all classical and many exceptional symmetric spaces are obtained in this way. We prove that generalized <b>projective</b> and polar <b>geometries</b> are essentially equivalent to Jordan algebraic structures, namely to Jordan pairs, respectively to Jordan triple systems over K which are obtained as a linearized tangent version of the geometries {{in a similar way}} as a Lie group is linearized by its Lie algebra.
