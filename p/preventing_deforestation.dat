40|$|Whether people {{fight over}} {{valuable}} resources or engage in cooperation and trade {{depends on how}} well property rights are defined and enforced. We aim to describe the development of institutions in the Brazilian Amazon forest. The question that drives our study is why the local institutions have not been efficient in <b>preventing</b> <b>deforestation</b> and illegal logging. This exploratory research uses secondary and primary data. We argue that individuals and groups in the Amazon region could not successfully make rules for establishing rights and resolve disputes due to the weak definition and enforcement of property rights and monitoring. Regarding definition of rights, the highly politicized process of land allocation, top-down policies, {{and the presence of}} squatters increase the uncertainty of land titles. Cooperation and enforcement is difficult due to cultural differences influencing individuals ‟ and groups ‟ preferences. The physical characteristics of the forest obstruct monitoring and the climate conditions frequently blocks the view of sophisticated monitoring technology. This also impedes communication among communities and traffic in the region. Contrary to the American West, the Amazon forest has been with law and under-developed informal institutions that are not efficient in <b>preventing</b> <b>deforestation,</b> prevailing lawless...|$|E

This dissertation evaluates PES policy outcomes from a quantitative analysis within the specific case study of Ecuador's Socio Bosque Program (Span. : Programa Socio Bosque-PSB). The PSB is a national forest PES program instituted in 2008.

It approaches this aim by presenting methods which integrate and analyze data in a way which progresses the science of conservation policy evaluation. Ultimately, the insights provided advance the science of conservation policy thereby preventing the needless degradation and loss of forest ecosystems. The specific objectives of the overall dissertation are to: (1) better understand the relationship between variations in the structure PES contracts and forest owner enrollment, and (2) go beyond measuring the effect of conservation payments in <b>preventing</b> <b>deforestation</b> to estimate their effect in preventing forest degradation...|$|E

40|$|Discussions on how {{to reduce}} carbon {{emissions}} from deforestation and degradation have prompted scrutiny of methods for measuring rates of forest loss, as well as discussion {{of the role of}} protected area (PA) status in reducing tropical deforestation. This study employs a range of techniques including GIS analyses and local stakeholder interviews to examine the effectiveness of three comparable PAs in Sulawesi, Indonesia in <b>preventing</b> <b>deforestation</b> over a 16 -year period. Our analyses demonstrate that all three of the protected areas have proved effective at conferring forest protection to some extent, after controlling for other factors that influence deforestation rates. However Nantu Nature Reserve, the only recipient of broad-based conservation investment, proved to be substantially more effective than the PAs without international investment. In contrast with the recent hopes for integrating conservation with development, interviews with local stakeholders revealed that despite community development projects, the primary contributor to conservation had been the presence of a team of armed park guards. Despite the potentially divisive nature of this situation the villagers recognised the benefits of the forest and looked forward to a time when protectionism might be less necessary and instead villagers would be motivated primarily by the benefits rather than the costs of conservation. The use of remotely sensed data to evaluate conservation effectiveness in this data-poor region has challenges, but we demonstrate that, with the addition of contextualising data from locally based social surveys, it is possible both to quantify the additionality of individual PAs in <b>preventing</b> <b>deforestation,</b> after controlling for other factors, and to understand the reasons behind this success.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} {{is to create an}} {{understanding}} of the incentives for forest companies to invest in reducing carbon dioxide emissions from deforestation and forest degradation, which is termed REDD. The Brazilian Amazonas was chosen as the base for the investment case. Brazil has the largest area of rainforest in the world, and also the biggest problem with deforestation. The Amazon region of Brazil comprises rainforest which is largely intact and unexploited. Accordingly, there is significant potential scope for prospective investments in a REDD-project, and so have a noteworthy impact in <b>preventing</b> <b>deforestation.</b> The research approach used the United Nation’s Clean Development Mechanism concept was used as a framework for ascertaining the investment costs in potential REDD-projects. Multiple methods were used to collect data. In particular, information about the transaction costs involved with Clean Development Mechanism-projects was used as input to an investment decision model that estimated net present value outcomes. Other bases for the investment decision model were the results from a political, economical, social and technological (PEST) analysis of Brazilian Amazonas; and, interviews with experts from five of the world’s largest international forest companies about their assessment of the risks and benefits as well as perceptions of the corporate social responsibility aspects of REDD-projects. The PEST analysis showed that Brazilian Amazonas is a suitable investment case and could be a good place for this type of investments in the future - provided regulations were significantly simplified. The outcome on the investment model clearly showed that a company investing in a REDD-project with main purpose of <b>preventing</b> <b>deforestation</b> can expect a positive net present value. However, risks are high due to uncertainties about the value of carbon credits and uncertainties about the continued existence of carbon market...|$|E
40|$|Background: CO 2 {{emissions}} from cleared mangrove areas may be substantial, increasing {{the costs of}} continued losses of these ecosystems, particularly in mangroves that have highly organic soils. Methodology/Principal Findings: We measured CO 2 efflux from mangrove soils that had been cleared for up to 20 years on the islands of Twin Cays, Belize. We also disturbed these cleared peat soils to assess what disturbance of soils after clearing may have on CO 2 efflux. CO 2 efflux from soils declines from time of clearing from, 10 600 tonnes km 22 year 21 {{in the first year}} to 3000 tonnes km 2 year 21 after 20 years since clearing. Disturbing peat leads to short term increases in CO 2 efflux (27 umol m 22 s 21), but this had returned to baseline levels within 2 days. Conclusions/Significance: Deforesting mangroves that grow on peat soils results in CO 2 emissions that are comparable to rates estimated for peat collapse in other tropical ecosystems. <b>Preventing</b> <b>deforestation</b> presents an opportunity for countries to benefit from carbon payments for preservation of threatened carbon stocks...|$|E
