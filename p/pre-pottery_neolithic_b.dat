These eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> <b>B</b> (PPNB) sites in the Levant, although wheat {{was the first to}} be grown and harvested on a significant scale. At around the same time (9400 BC), parthenocarpic fig trees were domesticated.|$|E

40|$|Ayanlar Höyük (Gre Hut), located 30 km west of Şanlıurfa, was {{discovered}} during surface surveys conducted in 2013. Ayanlar Höyük dated to the <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> Period, is a large- scale mound like Göbekli Tepe and Karahan Tepe, covering an overall {{surface area of}} 14 hectares. It was learned recently that three artefacts dated to the <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> period which are held by Şanlıurfa Museum were brought from Ayanlar Höyük. The artefacts in Şanlıurfa Museum and the finds recovered from Ayanlar Höyük during a surface survey {{have been identified as}} having characteristics similar to those from Körtik Tepe, Göbekli Tepe, Nevali Çori and Karahan Tepe.

In our paper we present a typological scheme classification of animal hard tissues artefacts and production techniques of the specimens recovered in Tell Abu Suwwan. Microscopic analyses of hard tissues artefacts were carried out in order to recognize the manufacturing techniques. Several typologies of hard tissues artefacts, such as pointed instruments, spatulas and symbolic tools, were recognized. Archaeozoological analysis was supported by scientific experimental work done by a joint team of researchers from the University of Ferrara and the University of Jordan in 2010, {{in order to understand}} cultural behavior and exploitation of animal carcasses at the site...|$|R
25|$|Haplogroup T {{is found}} among the later Middle <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> <b>B</b> (MPPNB) {{inhabitants}} from the 'Ain Ghazal archaeological site (in modern Jordan). It was not {{found among the}} early and middle MPPNB populations. It is thought that the <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> <b>B</b> population is mostly composed of two different populations: members of early Natufian civilisation and a population resulting from immigration from the north, i.e. north-eastern Anatolia. However, Natufians {{have been found to}} belong mostly to the E1b1b1b2 lineage – which is found among 60% of the whole PPNB population and 75% of the 'Ain Ghazal population, being present in all three MPPNB stages. Given the complete absence of T-PF7466 among Natufians and earlier MPPNB stages could mean that haplogroup T arrived later with the northerly influx.|$|E

40|$|This paper aims {{to present}} the {{preliminary}} results of the archaeozoological analysis carried out on the faunal assemblages of Tell Abu Suwwan - Jordan. Tell Abu Suwwan is one of Pre Pottery Neolithic mega villages which located in Northern Jordan. The site was excavated by the University of Jordan 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 field excavations, directed by prof. Maysoon Al Nahar, suggest that the site was occupied continually from the Middle <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> phase <b>B</b> (MPPNB) to the Yarmoukian (Pottery Neolithic) period.

Both Areas A and B include many lithics, faunal remains and some small finds. The faunal assemblages of Tell Abu Suwwan are mainly composed by domestic taxa like goat and sheep, and wild species as gazelle, wild boar and other ungulates.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we would like}} to present the {{experimental}} study carried out in order to reproduce the bone artifacts coming from the Neolithic site Tell Abu Suwwan-Jordan. This experimental project aims to complete the archaeozoological analysis of the bone artifacts in order to contribute to understand the cultural perspective during the occupation of Tell Abu Suwwan. Tell Abu Suwwan is one of Pre Pottery Neolithic mega villages which is located in Northern Jordan. The site was excavated by the University of Jordan 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008 field excavations, directed by prof.

During the excavation of Tell Abu Suwwan 46 bone artifacts has been recovered: some are bone tools like points and awls and others present engraving on the surface: as parallel cut marks. The preferred raw material is bone of medium size animals like gazelle and goat, which ribs and tibia and radius were modified to obtain those artifacts. In cooperation with Prof. M Al Nahar, who studies the lithic industry of Tell Abu Suwwan, the researchers of the University of Ferrara reproduced experimentally the bone objects by using the the lithic tools similar to the original ones. SEM analysis were carried out both on the bone objects and the lithic instruments to document the marks related to the manufacturing and utilization of the bones artefacts and the flint use wear...|$|R
40|$|The archaeological assemblages of the Levantine Neolithic changed {{dramatically}} from the <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> to the Pottery <b>Neolithic.</b> The <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> inhabitants produced well-planned, well-built, well-maintained architecture {{on a consistent}} basis, both within sites and across the region. In contrast, the architecture at Pottery Neolithic settlements exhibited {{a variety of forms}} ranging from pit dwellings, to round, rectangular, and apsidal buildings, to courtyard buildings, to no architecture at all. The end of the <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> coincided with a global climatic event, the 8. 2 ka cold event, a 300 - 400 year dip in global temperatures, accompanied by increased aridity. The drop in temperature likely changed the environmental conditions in the Levant, affecting the economic systems of the inhabitants. Late <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> inhabitants no longer relied on hunting for their primary meat source, as domesticated goat quickly became the dominant faunal assemblage at late <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> sites. This thesis argues that the lack of cohesion observed in the Pottery Neolithic archaeological assemblages {{is a reflection of the}} different responses and adaptive strategies used by different settlements to cope with the change in environmental conditions...|$|R
25|$|By 8500–7500 BC, the Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) culture {{developed}} out of {{the earlier}} local tradition of Natufian in Southern Palestine, dwelling in round houses, and building the first defensive site at Jericho (guarding a valuable fresh water spring).

25|$|The Harifians {{are viewed}} as {{migrating}} out of the Fayyum and the Eastern Deserts of Egypt during the late Mesolithic to merge with the <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> <b>B</b> (PPNB) culture, whose tool assemblage resembles that of the Harifian. This assimilation led to the Circum-Arabian Nomadic Pastoral Complex, a group of cultures that invented nomadic pastoralism, {{and may have been}} the original culture which spread Proto-Semitic languages throughout Mesopotamia.|$|E

Phase IA (10,200–9,700 BC) represents the Natufian occupation of Mureybet. It is characterized by hearths and cooking pits, but no dwelling structures have been identified. Among the crops that were harvested, and possibly even locally cultivated, were barley and rye. Very few sickle blades and querns were found. The inhabitants of Mureybet hunted gazelle and equids and fishing was also important. They had dogs, evidence for which is indirect at Mureybet but bones {{of which have been}} identified at nearby and contemporary Tell Abu Hureyra.|$|E

25|$|The early Neolithic human {{occupation}} of Mesopotamia is, like the previous Epipaleolithic period, {{confined to the}} foothill zones of the Taurus and Zagros Mountains and {{the upper reaches of}} the Tigris and Euphrates valleys. The Pre-Pottery Neolithic A (PPNA) period (10,000–8700 BC) saw the introduction of agriculture, while the oldest evidence for animal domestication dates to the transition from the PPNA to the <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> <b>B</b> (PPNB, 8700–6800 BC) at the end of the 9th millennium BC. This transition has been documented at sites like Abu Hureyra and Mureybet, which continued to be occupied from the Natufian well into the PPNB. The so-far earliest monumental sculptures and circular stone buildings from Göbekli Tepe in southeastern Turkey date to the PPNA/Early PPNB and represent, according to the excavator, the communal efforts of a large community of hunter-gatherers.|$|E
25|$|The {{inundation}} {{of large}} parts of the Euphrates valley, especially in Turkey and Syria, has led to the flooding of many archaeological sites and other places of cultural significance. Although concerted efforts have been made to record or save as much of the endangered cultural heritage as possible, many sites are probably lost forever. The combined GAP projects on the Turkish Euphrates have led to major international efforts to document the archaeological and cultural heritage of the endangered parts of the valley. Especially the flooding of Zeugma with its unique Roman mosaics by the reservoir of the Birecik Dam has generated much controversy in both the Turkish and international press. The construction of the Tabqa Dam in Syria led to a large international campaign coordinated by UNESCO to document the heritage that would disappear under the waters of Lake Assad. Archaeologists from numerous countries excavated sites ranging in date from the Natufian to the Abbasid period, and two minarets were dismantled and rebuilt outside the flood zone. Important sites that have been flooded or affected by the rising waters of Lake Assad include Mureybet, Emar and Abu Hureyra. A similar international effort was made when the Tishrin Dam was constructed, which led, among others, to the flooding of the important <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> <b>B</b> site of Jerf el-Ahmar. An archaeological survey and rescue excavations were also carried out in the area flooded by Lake Qadisiya in Iraq. Parts of the flooded area have recently become accessible again due to the drying up of the lake, resulting not only in new possibilities for archaeologists to do more research, but also providing opportunities for looting, which has been rampant elsewhere in Iraq {{in the wake of the}} 2003 invasion.|$|E
500|$|In {{the seventh}} stratum, {{which is the}} deepest, an {{extensive}} portion of a plaster floor, composed of burnt limestone, was exposed. The flint tools from this stratum included arrowheads and sickle blades, characteristic of the <b>Pre-Pottery</b> <b>Neolithic</b> <b>B</b> period. In the sixth stratum two walls that formed {{the corner of a}} large building were exposed. The pottery was found in clusters, resting on the walls. It included vessel types characteristic of the Yarmukian and Jericho IX (Lodian) cultures, dating to the Pottery Neolithic. In a limited region south of the excavation area three rows of stones that formed a rectangular space built upon a floor were exposed in the fifth stratum. It is unclear if these were the remains of thin walls or of an installation.
