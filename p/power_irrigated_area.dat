40|$|To improve {{adaptive}} capacity and further strengthen {{the role of}} irrigation in mitigating climate change impacts, the Chinese government has planned to expand <b>irrigated</b> <b>areas</b> by 4. 4 % by the 2030 s. Examining the adaptive potential of <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> expansion under climate change is therefore critical. Here, we assess the effects of <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> expansion on crop yields based on county-level data during 1980 – 2011 in northern China and estimate climate impacts under <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> scenarios in the 2030 s. Based on regression analysis, there is a statistically significant effect of <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> expansion on reducing negative climate impacts. More <b>irrigated</b> <b>areas</b> indicate less heat and drought impacts. <b>Irrigated</b> <b>area</b> expansion will alleviate yield reduction by 0. 7 – 0. 8 % in the future but associated yield benefits will still not compensate for greater adverse climate impacts. Yields are estimated to decrease by 4. 0 – 6. 5 % under future climate conditions when an additional 4. 4 % of <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> is established, and no fundamental yield increase with an even further 10 % or 15 % expansion of <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> is predicted.

These areas were compared with the Indian National Statistical Data on <b>irrigated</b> <b>areas</b> reported by the: (a) Directorate of Economics and Statistics (DES) of the Ministry of Agriculture (MOA), and (b) Ministry of Water Resources (MoWR). A state-by-state comparison of remote sensing derived <b>irrigated</b> <b>areas</b> when compared with MoWR derived irrigation potential utilized (IPU), an equivalent of AIA, provided a high degree of correlation with R 2 values of: (a) 0. 79 with 10 -km, and (b) 0. 85 with MODIS 500 -m. However, the remote sensing derived <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> estimates for India were consistently higher than the <b>irrigated</b> <b>areas</b> reported by the national statistics. The remote sensing derived total area available for irrigation (TAAI), which does not consider intensity of irrigation, was 101 million hectares (Mha) using 10 -km and 113 Mha using 500 -m. The AIAs, which considers intensity of irrigation, was 132 Mha using 10 -km and 146 Mha using 500 -m. In contrast the IPU, an equivalent of AIAs, as reported by MoWR was 83 Mha. There are “large variations” in <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> statistics reported, even between two ministries (e. g., Directorate of Statistics of Ministry of Agriculture and Ministry of Water Resources) of the same national system. The causes include: (a) reluctance on part of the states to furnish <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> data in view of their vested interests in sharing of water, and (b) reporting of large volumes of data with inadequate statistical analysis.

Landsat Enhanced Thematic Mapper (ETM+) data and time-series Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) data were used to map <b>irrigated</b> agricultural <b>areas</b> as well as other land use/land cover (LULC) classes, for Ghana. Temporal variations in the normalized difference vegetation index (NDVI) pattern obtained in the LULC class were used to identify <b>irrigated</b> and non-irrigated <b>areas.</b> First, the temporal variations in NDVI pattern were found to be more consistent in long-duration irrigated crops than with short-duration rainfed crops due to more assured water supply for <b>irrigated</b> <b>areas.</b> Second, surface water availability for <b>irrigated</b> <b>areas</b> is dependent on shallow dug-wells (on river banks) and dug-outs (in river bottoms) that affect the timing of crop sowing and growth stages, which was in turn reflected in the seasonal NDVI pattern. A decision tree approach using Landsat 30 m one time data fusion with MODIS 250 m time-series data was adopted to classify, group, and label classes. Finally, classes were tested and verified using ground truth data and national statistics. Fuzzy classification accuracy assessment for the irrigated classes varied between 67 and 93 %. An <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> derived from remote sensing (32, 421 ha) was 20 – 57 % higher than <b>irrigated</b> <b>areas</b> reported by Ghana’s Irrigation Development Authority (GIDA).

The sub-pixel <b>irrigated</b> <b>areas</b> (SPIAs) from coarseresolution satellite sensor data were estimated by multiplying the full pixel <b>irrigated</b> <b>areas</b> (FPIAs) with <b>irrigated</b> <b>area</b> fractions (IAFs). Three methods were presented for IAF computation: (a) Google Earth Estimate (IAF-GEE); (b) High resolution imagery (IAF-HRI); and (c) Sub-pixel de-composition technique (IAF-SPDT).
