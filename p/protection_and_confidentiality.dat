Electronic prescriptions were introduced in Estonia in January 2010 and by mid-2013, 95% of all prescriptions in the country were being issued electronically. Other countries which use the prescription process routinely are Norway, Denmark, Finland, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Italy, Iceland, Greece, England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland.The European Union is pushing for more cross border health data exchange. Despite favourable attitudes towards cross border e-Prescriptions, multiple perceived barriers impede its incorporation in clinical practice. There are varying interpretations and implementations of data <b>protection</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> laws in the 27 member states. Infrastructures are not in place to support the system and stakeholders in some jurisdictions are reluctant to embrace e-health due to the high cost and the lack of security of the systems. Member states have varying degrees of health care policy, privacy enforcement and laws concerning data protection, telecommunication services and digital signature with regards to e-Prescription. Interoperability of different systems is only a partial solution. Security and enforcement of privacy must also be equally enforced.|$|E

These new online services are becoming increasingly complex, offering diverse functionality and managing high volumes of personal and confidential data. The <b>protection</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> of such data is imperative but the security mechanisms and the policies governing its security are rarely sufficient. Nonetheless electronic commerce service providers market their services as being “secure” and by doing so they are developing {{a false sense of}} security within computer users. Average computer users are aware of security threats like hackers, viruses, Trojans and spyware, but their limited computer knowledge doesn’t allow them to understand, identify or respond to such security threats. A lack of computer knowledge, little experience and gullibility render the average computer user incapable of managing computer security. This is even more true when the average computer user is put up against the wit and cunning of a hacker. Electronic commerce has changed, the threats have changed, the users have changed and electronic commerce security solutions remain the same. Hackers are no longer hobbyists: they hack for financial gain and not fame, they work together and they exploit any security weakness to get what they want. More and more often the average computer user falls victim to hacker attacks, not only because of the above mentioned human factors but also because of weak security mechanisms that govern users’ access to critical online services...|$|E

To {{investigate}} {{the role of}} physician and patient characteristics in determining risk perceptions and decision making in a hypothetical case where confidentiality {{may need to be}} broken to protect the partner of a patient who is infected with HIV. To identify if risk perceptions mediate the relation between physician and patient characteristics and confidentiality decisions. Design. Analysis of a sample of 207 Irish general practitioners (GPs) {{randomly assigned to one of}} four experimental vignette conditions. Methods. A single vignette scenario was presented to each GP within which a hypothetical male HIV patient was depicted as unwilling to disclose his HIV status to his partner. The hypothetical patient's use of protection (used, not used) and sexual orientation (heterosexual, homosexual) were varied systematically. GPs then estimated the risk the patient posed to the partner and the likelihood that they would break confidentiality to inform the partner of the patient's HIV status. Results. Less experienced GPs and those who had broken confidentiality in the past were likely to indicate they would break confidentiality in response to the presented scenario. GPs were more likely to inform the partner when protection was not used during intercourse and when the relationship was heterosexual rather than homosexual. Risk perceptions partially mediated the relationship between the patient's use of <b>protection</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> decision ratings but did not explain the association between GP characteristics or patient sexuality and decision making.

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{determine}} how closely {{institutional review board}} (IRB) discussions reflect the ethical criteria specified in the Common Rule federal regulations. METHOD: Between November 2006 and July 2009, the authors observed, audio-recorded, transcribed, and coded protocol reviews from 20 IRB meetings at 10 leading academic medical centers. They also reviewed each of the applications discussed to identify the Common Rule criteria-(1) risk minimization, (2) risk/benefit comparison, (3) equitable subject selection, (4) informed consent, (5) data monitoring to ensure safety, (6) privacy <b>protection</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality,</b> and (7) protection of vulnerable subjects-that were both relevant to the study and not adequately addressed in the application. They then determined if the IRB addressed each of the relevant and not-discussed Common Rule criteria in their discussions. RESULTS: IRBs {{made no mention of}} many of the Common Rule criteria that required their discussion-In 17 / 82 (21 %) reviews, they failed to address risk minimization; in 52 / 91 (57 %), risk/benefit comparison; in 31 / 52 (60 %), equitable subject selection; in 32 / 59 (54 %), data monitoring; in 13 / 52 (25 %), privacy and confidentiality; and in 7 / 55 (13 %), protection of vulnerable populations. However, they discussed informed consent in 102 / 104 (98 %) reviews and raised questions about, or requested changes about, informed consent for 92 / 104 (88 %) protocols. CONCLUSIONS: These findings suggest that essential elements of human subjects protection are not implemented uniformly across IRBs.

40|$|The {{creation}} of open archives i. e. archives where access is regulated by open licensing models (content, source, data), {{should be seen}} {{as part of a broader}} socio-economic phenomenon that finds legal expression in specific organizational and technical formats. This paper examines the origins and main characteristics of the open archives phenomenon. We investigate the extent to which different models of production of economic or social value can be expressed in different forms of licensing in the context of open archives. Through this process, we assess the extent to which the digital archive is moving towards providing access that is deeper (meaning, that offers more access rights) and wider (in the sense that most of the information given is in open content licensing) or face a gradual stratification and polarization of the content. Such stratification entails the emergence of two types of content: content to which access is extremely limited and content to which access remains completely open. This differentiation between classes of content is the result of multiple factors: from purely legislative, administrative and contractual restrictions (e. g. data <b>protection</b> <b>and</b> <b>confidentiality</b> restrictions) to information economics (e. g. peer production) or social (minimum universal access). We claim that with respect to the access management model, most of the current archiving processes include elements of openness. Usually, this is the result of economic necessity expressed in licensing instruments or organisational arrangements. The viability and the socio-economic importance of the digital archives also contributes to the use of open archiving practices. In such a context, although pure forms of open digital archives may remain an ideal, the reality of hybrid open digital archives is a necessity...|$|E
