40|$|The fatigue {{behaviour}} of {{welded joints}} depends primarely on {{the interaction between}} notch geometry, residual stress and type of loading, i. e. constant and variable amplitude loading. Longitudinal stiffeners respond to a thermal stress relieving with an increase of endurance limit of about 50 %; but in the finite fatigue life region due to <b>plastifications</b> in the sharp weld notch root {{there is no difference}} between the as/welded state and the stress relieved state. The <b>plastifications</b> are the reason that also under variable amplitude loading only in the region of high cycles a slight improvement of about 15 % due to the thermal treatment was observed. However, in the case of V-shaped specimens with smooth weld radii a stress relieve results for the whole S-N-curve in an increase of about 56 % and under variable amplitude loading for the whole fatigue life curve in an improvement of 33 %. A TIG-dresesing improves the fatigue strength under variable amplitude loading by a further 53 %. Con cerning multiaxial fatigue, when principal stress directions are constant the von Mises hypothesis can be applied satisfactorily. However, for changing stress directions all conventional hypotheses (von Mises, Tresca, principal stress) severely overestimate the fatigue life. Therefore, a development of strength hypotheses is necessary...|$|R

The autofrettage process helps to increase the f atigue durability and a simple, but efﬁcient design method for this proces s is deployed. Based o n non-linear material’s behaviour, ﬁn ite eleme nt simulations of t he crack-free geometry help to determine the minimum and maximum autofrettage pressure to be used, without iterative crack simulations, which would require higher computational effort.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{turbine housing}} of a {{turbocharger}} {{is exposed to}} extensive cyclic thermo-mechanical loading. This leads to multi-axial stress states with local <b>plastifications,</b> so that {{the design of the}} turbine housing becomes a major challenge in ensuring the guaranteed lifetime in relation to the high-temperature behavior of the materials. The first step was to develop and validate a phenomenological lifetime estimation approach, in conjunction with a constitutive material model applied in a preceding Finite-Element analysis, for application on the casting materials Ni-resist D 5 S and GJV. A satisfactory estimation of the number of cycles until crack initiation, by considering creep fatigue interaction, was demonstrated on specimens subject to characteristic load conditions derived by a critical plane approach. In the second step, the adaption for turbine housing design is investigated...|$|R
40|$|Steel {{beams and}} beam-columns are {{generally}} subjected to six different internal forces and moments if warping of the cross-section is neglected. Three of them, normal forces and bending moments on the strong and weak axes result in direct stresses, the other three, shear {{forces on the}} weak and strong axes and Saint Venant torsion result in shear stresses on the cross-section. Based on the well-known interaction formula for the rectangular cross-section, interaction formulae for all six internal forces and moments on box-cross sections are given. The formulae are derived for both partial and complete <b>plastification</b> of the cross-section. It is shown that the complete <b>plastification</b> of the cross-section is associated to torsion. The comparison of the results with the corresponding provisions of Eurocode 3 and the publication that is referred to in DIN 18800, part 1 shows that in both cases complete <b>plastification</b> is considered.

40|$|The use {{of steel}} bracing {{systems for the}} {{strengthening}} of existing reinforced concrete (RC) frames may lead to increase of both strength and stiffness. However, {{in most of the}} cases the main target is the increase of the energy dissipation capacity. This paper studies, both experimentally and numerically, the efficiency of a specific strengthening type which utilizes a small steel link element having an I-shaped cross-section connected to the RC frame through bracing elements. The energy is dissipated through the <b>plastification</b> of the steel link element. The case studied in this paper is a typical one bay, single storey RC frame constructed according to older code provisions, which is strengthened through two different types of steel link elements. The behaviour of the strengthened frames is studied with respect to the one of the original bare frame. The experimental study is supported by complete numerical simulations of the performed tests. To this end, detailed numerical models are formulated, which are able to follow the highly non-linear nature of the problem, involving the <b>plastification</b> of the steel rebars, the cracking and <b>plastification</b> of concrete and the plastic deformation and hysteretic response of the dissipative link elements...|$|E

By using the material combination glass/polypropylene, the influence of the process parameters on the properties of the long-fibre reinforced press masses is characterised. In order to guarantee a fibre-friendly processing during <b>plastification</b> and to achieve a complete fibre debundling and a good fibre filament distribution, special attention must be paid to the right starting material and to the right machinery. Requirements are discussed. The influence of the resulting structure of reinforcement (fibre content, resulting fibre length and fibre length distribution, fibre debundling and filament distribution, fibre orientation) on the achievable mechanical properties are estimated by using simple equations. Trials are carried out to characterise the influence of the process parameters of the <b>plastification</b> unit on the reinforcement structure. Methods are developed to enable a precise measurement of every form of reinforcement. Mechanical properties that are determined in short-tensile and penetration testing are showing a dependency on the properties of the resulting structure of reinforcement.

40|$|Visualization of fourth-order tensors from solid {{mechanics}} {{has not been}} explored in depth previously. Challenges include {{the large number of}} components (3 x 3 x 3 x 3 for 3 D), loss of major symmetry and loss of positive definiteness (with possibly zero or negative eigenvalues). This paper presents a decomposition of fourth-order tensors that facilitates their visualization and understanding. Fourth-order tensors are used to represent a solid’s stiffness. The stiffness tensor represents the relationship between increments of stress and increments of strain. Visualizing stiffness is important to understand the changing state of solids during <b>plastification</b> and failure. In this work, we present a method {{to reduce the number of}} stiffness components to second-order 3 x 3 tensors for visualization. The reduction is based on polar decomposition, followed by eigen-decomposition on the polar "stretch". If any resulting eigenvalue is significantly lower than the others, the material has softened in that eigen-direction. The associated second-order eigentensor represents the mode of stress (such as compression, tension, shear, or some combination of these) to which the material becomes vulnerable. Thus we can visualize the physical meaning of <b>plastification</b> with techniques for visualizing second-order symmetric tensors...|$|E

When the load combination reaches the ultimate strength surface, the column is considered as failed. This method takes into account the effect of member instability and <b>plastification</b> on structural stability. ^ The load-deflection response predicted by the proposed methods is almost identical to that by the plastic zone method.

40|$|In {{this paper}} a design method for the tension side of statically loaded, bolted beam-to-column {{connections}} is developed {{based on the}} plastic behaviour of the flanges and the bolts {{under the assumption that}} the <b>plastification</b> is large enough to allow the adoption of the most favourable static equilibrium. Until now bolted beam-to-column connections without stiffening plates welded between the column flanges have been generally avoided. The {{reason for this is that}} the deformations of the connection are considerable and, until now, a formula which allows the determination of the stiffness and strength of a column flange has been lacking. This paper presents the derivation of an "effective" length formula for a column flange in tension without stiffening plates between the flanges. The derivation is based on the analysis of two different collapse mechanisms. One mechanism occurs if bolt failure governs collapse. The other mechanism corresponds to collapse resulting from the full <b>plastification</b> of the column flanges. Tests are discussed that were performed to insure that the developed design rules would lead to connections that would satisfy the limit state of deformations as given in the Dutch regulations for constructional steel work (for both) serviceability and ultimate limit states.

Rigidity of the six-bar girder is selected by the draw of the profile bars among the assumed collection of the steel hot-rolled tubes. Two stadiums of exertion of the girder-elastic and non-elastic ones are considered. Each of these stadiums ends by <b>plastification</b> of the one of the tensile bars or buckling of the one of the bars in compression. Assuming some approximate assumptions, the possibilities are indicated for creating the statically determined three-bar structure and a passive part of the girder in the non-elastic stadium.

Each form of the structures has its own path of exertion to achieve the state of limit capacity. It depends which the active bar of the structure experiences <b>plastification</b> in stretching or buckling in compression.
