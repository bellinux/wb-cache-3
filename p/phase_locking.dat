25|$|In a federated {{database}} {{system or}} any other more loosely defined multidatabase system, which are typically distributed in a communication network, transactions span multiple (and possibly distributed) databases. Enforcing global serializability in such system, where different databases may use different types of concurrency control, is problematic. Even if every local schedule of a single database is serializable, the global schedule of a whole system is not necessarily serializable. The massive communication exchanges of conflict information needed between databases to reach conflict serializability globally would lead to unacceptable performance, primarily due to computer and communication latency. Achieving global serializability effectively over different types of concurrency control has been open for several years. Commitment ordering (or Commit ordering; CO), a serializability technique publicly introduced in 1991 by Yoav Raz from Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC), provides an effective general solution for global (conflict) serializability across any collection of database systems and other transactional objects, with possibly different concurrency control mechanisms. CO does not need the distribution of conflict information, but rather utilizes the already needed (unmodified) atomic commitment protocol messages without any further communication between databases. It also allows optimistic (non-blocking) implementations. CO generalizes Strong strict two <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> (SS2PL), which {{in conjunction with the}} Two-phase commit (2PC) protocol is the de facto standard for achieving global serializability across (SS2PL based) database systems. As a result, CO compliant database systems (with any, different concurrency control types) can transparently join existing SS2PL based solutions for global serializability. The same applies also to all other multiple (transactional) object systems that use atomic transactions and need global serializability for correctness (see examples above; nowadays such need is not smaller than with database systems, the origin of atomic transactions).|$|E

2500|$|Most {{existing}} database systems, {{including all}} major commercial database systems, are strong strict two <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> (SS2PL) based and already CO compliant. Thus they {{can participate in}} a CO based solution for global serializability in multidatabase environments without any modification (except for the popular multiversioning, where additional CO aspects should be considered). Achieving global serializability across SS2PL based databases using atomic commitment (primarily using two phase commit, 2PC) has been employed for many years (i.e., using the same CO solution for a specific special case; however, no reference is known prior to CO, that notices this special case's automatic global deadlock resolution by the atomic commitment protocol's augmented-conflict-graph global cycle elimination process). Virtually all existing distributed transaction processing environments and supporting products rely on SS2PL and provide 2PC. As {{a matter of fact}} SS2PL together with 2PC have become a de facto standard. This solution is a homogeneous concurrency control one, suboptimal (when both Serializability and Strictness are needed; see Strict commitment ordering; SCO) but still quite effective in most cases, sometimes at the cost of increased computing power needed relatively to the optimum. (However, for better performance relaxed serializability is used whenever applications allow). It allows inter-operation among SS2PL-compliant different database system types, i.e., allows heterogeneity in aspects other than concurrency control. SS2PL is a very constraining schedule property, and [...] "takes over" [...] when combined with any other property. For example, when combined with any optimistic property, the result is not optimistic anymore, but rather characteristically SS2PL. On the other hand, CO does not change data-access scheduling patterns at all, and any combined property's characteristics remain unchanged. Since also CO uses atomic commitment (e.g., 2PC) for achieving global serializability, as SS2PL does, any CO compliant database system or transactional object can transparently join existing SS2PL based environments, use 2PC, and maintain global serializability without any environment change. This makes CO a straightforward, natural generalization of SS2PL for any conflict serializability based database system, for all practical purposes.|$|E
2500|$|The {{problem of}} global {{serializability}} {{has been a}} quite intensively researched subject in the late 1980s and early 1990s. Commitment ordering (CO) has provided an effective general solution to the problem, insight into it, and understanding about possible generalizations of strong strict two <b>phase</b> <b>locking</b> (SS2PL), which practically and almost exclusively has been utilized (in conjunction with the Two-phase commit protocol (2PC) [...] ) since the 1980s to achieve global serializability across databases. An important side-benefit of CO is the automatic global deadlock resolution that it provides (this is applicable also to distributed SS2PL; though global deadlocks have been an important research subject for SS2PL, automatic resolution has been overlooked, except in the CO articles, until today (2009)). At that time quite many commercial database system types existed, many non-relational, and databases were relatively very small. Multi database systems were considered a key for database scalability by database systems interoperability, and global serializability was urgently needed. Since then the tremendous progress in computing power, storage, and communication networks, resulted in orders of magnitude increases in both centralized databases' sizes, transaction rates, and remote access to database capabilities, as well as blurring the boundaries between centralized computing and distributed one over fast, low-latency local networks (e.g., Infiniband). These, together with progress in database vendors' distributed solutions (primarily the popular SS2PL with 2PC based, a de facto standard that allows interoperability among different vendors' (SS2PL-based) databases; both SS2PL and 2PC technologies have gained substantial expertise and efficiency), workflow management systems, and database replication technology, in most cases have provided satisfactory and sometimes better information technology solutions without multi database atomic distributed transactions over databases with different concurrency control (bypassing the problem above). As a result, {{the sense of urgency}} that existed with the problem at that period, and in general with high-performance distributed atomic transactions over databases with different concurrency control [...] types, has reduced. However, the need in concurrent distributed atomic transactions as a fundamental element of reliability exists in distributed systems also beyond database systems, and so the need in global serializability as a fundamental correctness criterion for such transactional systems (see also Distributed serializability in Serializability). With the proliferation of the Internet, Cloud computing, Grid computing, small, portable, powerful computing devices (e.g., smartphones), and sophisticated systems management the need for effective global serializability techniques to ensure correctness in and among distributed transactional applications seems to increase, and thus also the need in Commitment ordering (including the popular for databases special case SS2PL; SS2PL, though, does not meet the requirements of many other transactional objects).|$|E

40|$|This Master Thesis {{concerns}} {{theoretical and}} numerical investigations of optical clock recovery based on <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> loops at a bit rate of 160 Gb/s. A detailed mathematical {{model of a}} balanced optoelectronic <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> loop is described and a general time domain non-linear differential equation is derived. Based on the non-linear differential equation, numerical simulations are used to investigate {{the performance of a}} clock recovery circuit. Three loop filter types are considered: a proportional integrator, a low pass filter and an active lag filter. Furthermore, by performing a small signal analysis, simple expressions governing the stability properties and synchronization time constants are derived. In particular, these expressions point out the important effect of a time delay in the loop on the dynamic behavior. Long time delays degrade the performance of the loop and it is analyzed how the limitations due to the time delay can be minimized. Some of the conclusions of the investigations presented here are not anticipated by the classic theory of <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> loops and allow therefore {{a better understanding of the}} detailed characteristics of optoelectronic <b>phase</b> <b>locked</b> loops.
