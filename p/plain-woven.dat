40|$|Abstract. In {{the present}} study, {{a method for}} {{reducing}} the domain of analysis is developed for the homogenization analysis of <b>plain-woven</b> laminates. Moreover, the method {{is applied to the}} quantitative prediction of elastic-viscoplastic deformation of <b>plain-woven</b> GFRP laminates. It is first shown that the internal structures of <b>plain-woven</b> laminates satisfy point-symmetry {{on the assumption that the}} laminates have the in-phase or out-of-phase laminate configuration of plain fabrics. The point-symmetry is then utilized for the boundary condition of unit cell problems, reducing the domain of analysis to 1 / 4 and 1 / 8 for the in-phase and out-of-phase laminate configurations, respectively. Using the present method combined with the nonlinear time-dependent homogenization theory, the elastic-viscoplastic behavior of <b>plain-woven</b> GFRP laminates under in-plane on- and off-axis loading is analyzed. In addition, the tensile tests of a <b>plain-woven</b> GFRP laminate at a constant strain rate are performed at a room temperature. Comparing the results of the present analysis with the experimental ones, it is shown that the analysis successfully predicts the in-plane elastic-viscoplastic behavior of the <b>plain-woven</b> GFRP laminate...|$|E

40|$|It has {{recently}} been shown that if we twist an arbitrary subset of edges of a mesh on an orientable surface, the resulting extended graph rotation system (EGRS) {{can be used to}} induce a cyclic weaving on the surface. In extended graph rotation systems, an edge is viewed as a paper strip that can be twisted. The sides of the paper strips provide “two strands ” to construct weaving structures. Either these strands are “parallel ” to the mesh edge for an “untwisted edge”, or they both cross over the edge and over each other for a “twisted edge”. If an arbitrary subset of edges of a mesh on an orientable surface is twisted in the same helical sense, then the EGRS induces a cyclic plain-weaving on the surface, which consists of cycles that cross other cycles (or themselves) by alternatingly going over and under. In this paper, we show that it is always possible to create a single-cycle plain-weaving starting from a mesh on an arbitrary surface, by selecting an appropriate subset of edges to be twisted. We also demonstrate how, starting from a mesh, to construct a large number of single-cycle <b>plain-woven</b> objects. Interestingly, the single-cycle solutions with a minimal number of edge twists correspond to <b>plain-woven</b> objects that are visually similar to Celtic knots. For converting plain-weaving cycles to 3 D thread structures, we extend the original projection method, which previously worked only when all mesh edges are twisted. With the extension described here, our projection method {{can also be used to}} handle untwisted edges. We have developed a system that converts any manifold mesh into single-cycle <b>plain-woven</b> objects, by interactively controlling the proportion of edges that are twisted. The system also allows us to change the shapes of the threads with a set of parameters, interactively in real-time. We demonstrate here that by using this system, we can create a wide variety of single-cycle <b>plain-woven</b> objects...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTraditional fiber {{reinforced}} polymer (FRP) composite that {{is often}} fabricated from single type of reinforcement has shown its ability to replace the conventional metallic material counterparts. However, due to several stringent requirements on ductility, this has affected the performance of FRP composites for the structural applications. Therefore, hybrid composites, which combine two or more fiber reinforcements, have been introduced in order to overcome the short of traditional FRP composites. This paper investigates the mechanical properties of three different arrangements of hybrid composites made from glass fiber (<b>plain-woven</b> and stitched bi-axial ± 45 ˚) and <b>plain-woven</b> carbon fiber. Vacuum assisted resin transfer moulding method was employed to fabricate the hybrid composite panels. Mechanical properties such as tensile strength, flexural strength and volume fraction of the hybrid composites were determined per ASTM standards.

40|$|Interlaminar shear {{strength}} of four different fiber-reinforced ceramic matrix composites was determined with doublenotch shear test specimens {{as a function}} of test rate at elevated temperatures ranging from 1100 to 1316 C in air. Life limiting behavior, represented as interlaminar {{shear strength}} degradation with decreasing test rate, was significant for 2 -D crossplied SiC/MAS- 5 and 2 -D <b>plain-woven</b> C/SiC composites, but insignificant for 2 -D <b>plain-woven</b> SiC/SiC and 2 -D woven Sylramic (Dow Corning, Midland, Michigan) SiC/SiC composites. A phenomenological, power-law delayed failure model was proposed to account for and to quantify the rate dependency of interlaminar shear strength of the composites. Additional stress rupture testing in interlaminar shear was conducted at elevated temperatures to validate the proposed model. The model was in good agreement with SiC/MAS- 5 and C/SiC composites, but in poor to reasonable agreement with Sylramic SiC/SiC. Constant shear stress-rate testing was proposed as a possible means of life prediction testing methodology for ceramic matrix composites subjected to interlaminar shear at elevated temperatures when short lifetimes are expected...|$|E
40|$|International audienceA {{numerical}} model of ballistic {{impact on a}} two-dimensional Kevlar KM 2 ® <b>plain-woven</b> fabric has been validated by experiment. This paper shows {{that it is necessary}} to experimentally measure material constants of yarns for having good input parameters of the model. Effects of yarn Poisson's ratio, transverse and shear modulus on impact behaviors of a simple crimped yarn and a complete fabric have been carried out. The effect of the Poisson's ratio can be negligible in both impact cases: on a single crimped yarn and a complete fabric. The same conclusion has been proven for the effect of the transversal modulus except the cases of its so low values that can cause yarn early damage. The shear modulus of a yarn appears to be an important material parameter that mainly influences the ballistic performance of a two-dimensional <b>plain-woven</b> fabric. When using a very high value of a shear modulus of yarn, a crimped single yarn is broken immediately after contact with projectile in pure shearing mode...|$|E
40|$|The work {{aimed to}} assess the failure {{progress}} in a glass fiber-reinforced polymer laminate with a 3 D-woven and (as a comparison) <b>plain-woven</b> reinforcement, during static bending, using acoustic emission signals. The innovative method {{of the separation of}} the signal coming from the fiber fracture and the one coming from the matrix fracture {{with the use of the}} acoustic event’s energy as a criterion was applied. The failure progress during static bending was alternatively analyzed by evaluation of the vibration signal. It gave a possibility to validate the results of the acoustic emission. Acoustic emission, as well as vibration signal analysis proved to be good and effective tools for the registration of failure effects in composite laminates. Vibration analysis is more complicated methodologically, yet it is more precise. The failure progress of the 3 D laminate is “safer” and more beneficial than that of the <b>plain-woven</b> laminate. It exhibits less rapid load capacity drops and a higher fiber effort contribution at the moment of the main laminate failure...|$|E
40|$|An {{investigation}} on the ballistic impact behaviour of tungsten blunt projectiles on Kevlar® 29 <b>plain-woven</b> fabrics with an epoxy matrix {{has been carried}} out for the purpose of gaining an insight in the phenomena {{at the level of the}} composite components. Numerical models have been developed and have then been compared with experimental results. The numerical models have been developed in LS-DYNA adopting two different approaches: a Macro-homogeneous model, in which each layer is modelled as an orthotropic equivalent, and a Meso-heterogeneous one, based on the definition of all the details of the fabric architecture in the area of impact of the projectile's tip (in this case, yarns and matrix have their own properties). In both models, the projectile is considered a rigid body. An in-depth analysis of the macro parameters, such as the residual velocities, their dependency upon the yaw impact angle and delamination has been performed. Also the stress state inside the layers and the morphological features of the damaged plates has been studied and interesting results regarding the behaviour of different layers of Kevlar® 29 <b>plain-woven</b> fabrics during impact have been obtained. Performances and the pros/cons of the different numerical approaches have also been discussed...|$|E
40|$|The present work {{includes}} a constitutive damage meso-model {{which is based}} on the investigations of mechanical properties under room and high temperature of a <b>plain-woven</b> oxide/oxide Ceramic Matrix Composite (CMC) material. The models developed for unidirectional plies have been adapted to a <b>plain-woven</b> ply. The damage is defined as the degradation of the in-plane elastic properties. The thermodynamic potentials and the corresponding scalar damage variables are integrated into the framework of continuum damage mechanics. The damage surface of the model corresponds to the Tsai-Wu failure criterion in the stress space. The most of the variables used to define the damage initiation and propagation have been derived from simple on- and off-axis tension and shear tests. Nevertheless, curve fitting is required to obtain a certain set of parameters. The Tsai-Wu failure criterion has been implemented in strain and stress space to predict the failure of the laminate.

40|$|During {{the impact}} of thin {{composite}} panels, well-defined flaps can develop on the exit face {{as a consequence of}} through-thickness penetration of the panel. For certain materials (for example, CFRP panels based on plies of <b>plain-woven</b> fabric) the flaps develop as four triangles, with the apex of each triangle at the point of impact. As the impactor is driven through the panel, the flap (i. e. crack) lengths increase, until complete penetration of the panel by the impactor occurs. In the experiments described within this paper, CFRP panels fabricated from epoxy resin reinforced with <b>plain-woven</b> carbon fibre fabrics have been impacted using controlled multiple impact tests. During these tests, the impactor is driven at a controlled velocity to a particular depth of penetration through the composite panel, withdrawn, and then driven further through the panel subsequently. The experimental results show that the dependence of the flap compliance is proportional to the square of the flap length, which is in agreement with theoretical predictions. This compliance/crack-length also enables a toughness value for the composite panel to be derived that is directly relevant to through-thickness impact. The relationship of this toughness value to measurements of the mode I toughness of the composite panel using single edge notch specimens is also discussed...|$|E
40|$|The bending {{performance}} of fabric air beams varies significantly from conventional beams. Both are {{dependent upon the}} constitutive relations of the material, but air beams are further dependent upon the thermodynamics of the internal air. As the governing energy balance demonstrates, air beam bending is dependent upon strain energy and PV-work (air compressibility). The relative importance of these terms will vary with pressure, volume changes and shear deformations. To this point, a swatch of uncoated <b>plain-woven</b> fabric was subjected to mechanical tests and its material properties determined. Attempts at using the stress-strain measurements in air beam models, assumed constructed with the same fabric, were made. The models accounted for fluid-structure interactions between the air and fabric. Homogenization methods were used and were necessary to provide computational efficiencies for the macro-scale air beam model while {{attempts were made to}} incorporate the combined extension and shear behaviors observed during the material tests. Bending behavior was numerically investigated for several constitutive cases. The models were solved with the ABAQUS-Explicit program over a range of pressures. The fabric strain energy and PV-work were tracked and compared. It was concluded that strain energy and PV-work must be considered in deflection analyses of uncoated <b>plain-woven</b> fabric air beams...|$|E
40|$|A meso-scale {{ballistic}} material {{model for}} a prototypical <b>plain-woven</b> single-ply flexible armor is developed and implemented in a material user subroutine for the use in commercial explicit finite element programs. The main intent of the model is to attain computational efficiency when calculating the mechanical response of the multi-ply fabric-based flexible-armor material during its impact with various projectiles without significantly sacrificing the key physical aspects of the fabric microstructure, architecture, and behavior. To validate the new model, a comparative finite element method analysis is carried out in which: (a) the <b>plain-woven</b> single-ply fabric is modeled using conventional shell elements and weaving is done in an explicit manner by snaking the yarns through the fabric and (b) the fabric is treated as a planar continuum surface composed of conventional shell elements to which the new meso-scale unit-cell based material model is assigned. The results obtained show that the material model provides a reasonably good description for the fabric deformation and fracture behavior under different combinations of fixed and free boundary con-ditions. Finally, the model is used in {{an investigation of the}} ability of a multi-ply soft-body armor vest to protect the wearer from impact by a 9 -mm round nose projectile. The effects of inter-ply friction, projectile/ yarn friction, and the far-field boundary conditions are revealed and the results explained using simple wave mechanics principles, high-deformation rate material behavior, and the role of various energy-absorbing mechanisms in the fabric-based armor systems...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{effects of}} {{reinforcement}} geometry, in 2 D and 3 D woven fabric-reinforced composites, on {{the progression of}} damage and perforation failure at quasi-static loading rates (10 – 80 mm/s) are investigated.

The experimental {{results indicate that the}} 3 D laminates consistently had greater damage tolerance than the 2 D laminates and the 3 D monolithic composites. The enhanced damage tolerance of the 3 D systems is due to unique energy absorption mechanisms, which involve the crimped portion of z-tows.

In this work, {{the effect of}} these properties on fabric ballistic performance is parametrically studied. The result shows that the yarn density does not affect significantly the ballistic performance of fabric. The effect of yarn's longitudinal Young's modulus is more complex: a higher value of longitudinal Young's modulus decelerates the projectile at a higher rate, but this deceleration is not significant. In addition, a very high value of longitudinal Young's modulus causes a premature failure in the primary yarns and a perforation of the fabric even with a low impact velocity...|$|E

This paper deals with a process whereby a preheated thermoplastic <b>plain-woven</b> carbon fiber fabric sheet is formed into a circular cup by a mechanical servo-press. The effects of press parameters, specifically the bottom dead center and slide speed in the forming of CFRTP cup, on the press load, pressure, internal temperature, shape accuracy, and internal structure have been investigated. A <b>plain-woven</b> carbon-fiber-reinforced PA 6 thermoplastic sheet was used. The sheet consisted of four layers of woven 3 K carbon and had a thickness of 1 mm. The sheet was heated to 320 °C under a halogen heater so that it would be around the recommended temperature for forming 260 °C after transfer to the mold. The sheet was pressed into a circular cup shape by a cold mold while the periphery was cramped by a heated holder so as not to cool the sheet before it was pulled into the mold cave. Die clearance was designed considering the thickness increase due to the fiber concentration during the forming. By increasing the slide stroke to the bottom dead center, the applied press load was increased and the internal structure was improved, showing no voids. By increasing the slide speed, the final press load was reduced and shape accuracy was improved through a good pressure distribution on the mold. Measurement of the surface temperature of the sheet during the forming revealed that it remained in the melting region of the resin in the case of fast slide speed, but dropped below the melting temperature in the case of low slide speed. This difference apparently led to spring-in or spring-back after the forming. The experimental results indicate that appropriate balance among press speed, bottom dead center, and sheet temperature is important in the high-cycle forming of CFRTP. © 2016, Fuji Technology Press.
