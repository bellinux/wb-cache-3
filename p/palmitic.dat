The free fatty acid content of dried fruit bodies was 4.5%, slightly more than the common button mushroom (Agaricus bisporus), which had 3.5%. The majority of this total was oleic acid (1.95%), followed by linoleic acid (1.68%) and <b>palmitic</b> acid (1.69%).|$|E
5|$|Chemical {{analysis}} shows R.botrytis {{to have a}} food energy value of 154 kilojoules per 100 grams of fresh fruit bodies, which {{is comparable to the}} 120–150 kJ range reported for commercially grown edible mushrooms. As a percentage of dry matter, the fruit bodies contain 39.0% crude protein, 1.4% lipids, 50.8% carbohydrates, and 8.8% ash. The majority of the lipid content comprises oleic (43.9%), linoleic (38.3%), and <b>palmitic</b> (9.9%) fatty acids.|$|E
5|$|The total lipid, or crude fat, content {{makes up}} 2.6% {{of the dry}} matter of the mushroom. The {{proportion}} of fatty acids (expressed as a % of total fatty acids) are: <b>palmitic</b> acid, 9.8%; stearic acid, 2.7%; oleic acid, 36.1%; linoleic acid, 42.2%, and linolenic acid, 0.2%.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{undergo a}} range of posttranslational modifications, when additional chemical groups {{are attached to the}} amino acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic lipoproteins, or hydrophilic glycoproteins. These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid <b>palmitic</b> acid to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes.|$|E
5|$|The {{fatty acid}} {{composition}} of S.brevipes fruit bodies has been analyzed. The cap contained a higher lipid content than the stipe—18.4% {{of the dry}} weight, compared to 12.4%. In the cap, linoleic acid made up 50.7% of the total lipids (65.7% in the stipe), oleic acid was 29.9% (12.4% in the stipe), followed by <b>palmitic</b> acid at 10.5% (12.6% in the stipe). Linoleic acid—a {{member of the group}} of essential fatty acids called omega-6 fatty acids—is an essential dietary requirement for humans.|$|E
5|$|Camel milk is {{a staple}} food of nomadic tribes living in deserts. According to a study, it {{consists}} of 11.7% solids, 3% protein, 3.6% fat, 0.8% ash, 4.4% lactose and 0.13% acidity (pH 6.5). The quantities of sodium, potassium, zinc, iron, copper, manganese, niacin and vitamin C were relatively higher than the amounts in cow milk. However, the levels of thiamin, riboflavin, folacin, vitamin B12, pantothenic acid, vitamin A, lysine, and tryptophan were lower than those in cow milk. The molar percentages of the fatty acids in milk fat were 26.7% for <b>palmitic</b> acid, 25.5% oleic acid, 11.4% myristic acid and 11% palmitoleic acid. Camel milk has higher thermal stability compared with cow milk, {{but it does not}} compare favourably with sheep milk.|$|E
25|$|Other {{predominant}} fats include <b>palmitic</b> {{acid and}} linoleic acid.|$|E
25|$|Typical {{total fat}} {{composition}} is roughly: 1%ω-3, 14%ω-6, 71%ω-9 (65% oleic and 6% palmitoleic), and 14% saturated fat (<b>palmitic</b> acid).|$|E
25|$|Much like beta-oxidation, {{straight-chain}} {{fatty acid}} synthesis occurs via the six recurring reactions shown below, until the 16-carbon <b>palmitic</b> acid is produced.|$|E
25|$|An isotope {{labeling}} {{study in}} humans {{concluded that the}} fraction of dietary stearic acid that oxidatively desaturates to oleic acid is 2.4 {{times higher than the}} fraction of <b>palmitic</b> acid analogously converted to palmitoleic acid.|$|E
25|$|Both crunchy/chunky {{and smooth}} peanut butter are sources of {{saturated}} (primarily <b>palmitic</b> acid, 21% of total fat) and monounsaturated fats, mainly oleic acid as 47% of total fat, and polyunsaturated fat (28% of total fat), primarily as linoleic acid).|$|E

25|$|A 100 gram {{serving of}} milk {{chocolate}} supplies 540 calories. It is 59% carbohydrates (52% as sugar and 3% as dietary fiber), 30% fat and 8% protein (table). Approximately 65% {{of the fat}} in milk chocolate is saturated, composed mainly of <b>palmitic</b> acid and stearic acid, while the predominant unsaturated fat is oleic acid (table, see USDA reference for full report).|$|E
25|$|An {{example of}} a diacyl-glycerol shown on the right. This DAG is 1-palmitoyl-2-oleoyl-glycerol, which {{contains}} side-chains derived from <b>palmitic</b> acid and oleic acid. Diacylglycerols can also have many other combinations of fatty acids attached at either the C-1 and C-2 positions or the C-1 and C-3 positions of the glycerol molecule. 1,2 disubstituted glycerols are always chiral, 1,3 disubstituted glycerols are chiral if the substituents are different from each other.|$|E
25|$|The genus is rich {{in organic}} acids {{including}} formic, butyric, linoleic, linolenic, malic, myristic, oleic and <b>palmitic</b> acids as well as phenolic compounds, and the amino acid α-alanine. Esters like ethyl butyrate, ethyl caproate, n-hexyl butyrate and n-hexyl caproate give the fruits their flavor and appetizing smell. Sugars, contained mainly in the fruit, are most significantly d-fructose, d-glucose and raffinose. Among enzymes, Passiflora {{was found to be}} rich in catalase, pectin methylesterase and phenolase.|$|E
25|$|That {{same study}} {{discussed}} that a diet high in MUFAs {{is not the}} major determinant of erythrocyte membrane MUFAs, where most oleic acid in mammalian tissue {{is derived from the}} saturated stearic acid residue. Where key conversion is controlled by the Delta9-desaturase, which also regulates the transformation of the other common saturated fatty acids (SFAs) (myristic and <b>palmitic).</b> The study discussed that fat content of the diet has an important effect on Delta9-d activity, while high levels of SFAs increase Delta9-d activity by twofold to threefold, whereas polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) decrease.|$|E
25|$|The lipids {{found in}} green coffee include: {{linoleic}} acid, <b>palmitic</b> acid, oleic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, diterpenes, triglycerides, unsaturated long-chain fatty acids, esters, and amides. The total content of lipids in dried green coffee is between 11.7 and 14 g/100 g. Lipids are {{present on the}} surface and in the interior matrix of green coffee beans. On the surface, they include derivatives of carboxylic acid-5-hydroxytryptamides with an amide bond to fatty acids (unsaturated C6 to C24) making up to 3% of total lipid content or 1200 to 1400 microgram/g dried green coffee bean. Such compounds form a wax-like cover {{on the surface of the}} coffee bean (200 to 300mg lipids/100g dried green coffee bean) protecting the interior matrix against oxidation and insects. Further, such molecules have antioxidative activity due to their chemical structure. Lipids of the interior tissue are triglycerides, linoleic acid (46% of total free lipids), <b>palmitic</b> acid (30% to 35% of total free lipids), and esters. Arabica beans have a higher content of lipids (13.5 to 17.4g lipids/100g dried green coffee beans) than robustas (9.8 to 10.7g lipids/100g dried green coffee beans). The content of diterpenes is about 20% of the lipid fraction. The diterpenes found in green coffee include cafestol, kahweol and 16-O-methylcafestol. Some of these diterpenes have been shown in in vitro experiments to protect liver tissue against chemical oxidation. In coffee oil from green coffee beans the diterpenes are esterified with saturated long chain fatty acids.|$|E
25|$|Those {{plastids}} {{that contain}} chlorophyll can carry out photosynthesis. Plastids can also store products like starch and can synthesize fatty acids and terpenes, {{which can be}} used for producing energy and as raw material for the synthesis of other molecules. For example, the components of the plant cuticle and its epicuticular wax are synthesized by the epidermal cells from <b>palmitic</b> acid, which is synthesized in the chloroplasts of the mesophyll tissue. All plastids are derived from proplastids, which are present in the meristematic regions of the plant. Proplastids and young chloroplasts commonly divide by binary fission, but more mature chloroplasts also have this capacity.|$|E
25|$|The {{kernel of}} the egusi-itoo seed is 44% oil, 30% protein, 10% carbohydrate, 4% ash and 3% fiber. The oil of this seed is 64.9% {{linoleic}} acid, 12.4% oleic acid, 11.8% stearic acid and 10.9% <b>palmitic</b> acid. Vitamins Thiamin, Niacin, B1 and B2 are also {{prevalent in the}} seed, {{as well as many}} micronutrients. Notable minerals include phosphorus, as the largest mineral component, with potassium, magnesium, manganese, sulfur, calcium, iron and zinc to follow. The bulk of carbohydrates are starch and soluble sugars. Egusi-itoo is the perfect complement to the largely starch-rich grain diet of Africa, providing a high-protein and high-energy concentrate. The seed contains every important macro and micro-nutrient in quantities ideal for nutrition. The amino acid content of egusi-itoo proteins makes it a sufficient vegetable protein. This composition is ideal for sick and growing bodies, providing essential amino acids and calories. Just 100 g of seed daily provides essential fatty acid, amino acid and Vitamin E requirements. There is potential for these seeds as a critical tool for interventions in diseases such as marasmus and kwashiorkor.|$|E
500|$|Pumpkin seeds contain vitamin E, crude protein, [...] B {{vitamins}} and several dietary minerals (see nutrition table at pepita). Also present in pumpkin seeds are unsaturated and saturated oils, <b>palmitic,</b> oleic and linoleic fatty acids, {{as well as}} carotenoids.|$|E
500|$|The meat of {{a five-year-old}} {{dromedary}} has a typical composition of 76% water, 22% protein, 1% fat, and 1% ash.

A study of the meat of Iranian dromedaries showed its high glycogen content, which makes it taste sweet like horse meat. The carcasses of well-fed camels {{were found to be}} covered with a thin layer of good quality fat. In a study of the fatty acid composition of raw meat taken from the hind legs of seven one-to-three years old males, 51.5% of the fatty acids were saturated, 29.9% mono-unsaturated, and 18.6% polyunsaturated. The major fatty acids in the meat were <b>palmitic</b> acid (26.0%), oleic acid (18.9%) and linoleic acid (12.1%). In the hump, <b>palmitic</b> acid was dominant (34.4%), followed by oleic acid (28.2%), myristic acid (10.3%) and stearic acid (10%).|$|E
500|$|Emu fat is {{rendered}} to produce oil for cosmetics, dietary supplements, and therapeutic products.

It also contains various anti-oxidants, notably carotenoids and flavones.|$|E
500|$|This {{fairly large}} puffball is edible {{only when the}} spore bearing flesh is young, and white. It is said to lack texture, and the taste and odor of the young fruiting bodies are {{described}} as [...] "not distinctive". A 2007 study of the fatty acid composition of various edible Lycoperdaceae species determined the lipid content of H.utriformis to be quite low, approximately 1.8% (wet weight). The fatty acid content was largely linoleic acid (42.4%), oleic acid (23%), <b>palmitic</b> acid (12.2%), and stearic acid (3.6%); 17 other fatty acids of various chain lengths and degrees of unsaturation contributed to the total fatty acid composition.|$|E

500|$|Lycoperdon perlatum is {{considered}} to be a good edible mushroom when young, when the gleba is still homogeneous and white. [...] They have been referred to as [...] "poor man's sweetbread" [...] due to their texture and flavor. The fruit bodies can be eaten after slicing and frying in batter or egg and breadcrumbs, or used in soups as a substitute for dumplings. As early as 1861, Elias Fries recommended them dried and served with salt, pepper, and oil. The puffballs become inedible as they mature: the gleba becomes yellow-tinged then finally develops into a mass of powdery olive-green spores. L.perlatum is one of several edible species sold in markets in the Mexican states of Puebla and Tlaxcala. The fruit bodies are appealing to other animals as well: the northern flying squirrel (Glaucomys sabrinus) includes the puffball in their diet of non-truffle fungi, while the [...] "puffball beetle" [...] Caenocara subglobosum uses the fruit body for shelter and breeding. Nutritional analysis indicates that the puffballs are a good source of protein, carbohydrates, fats, and several micronutrients. The predominant fatty acids in the puffball are linoleic acid (37% of the total fatty acids), oleic acid (24%), <b>palmitic</b> acid (14.5%), and stearic acid (6.4%).|$|E
2500|$|Some {{researchers}} {{have indicated that}} serum myristic acid and <b>palmitic</b> acid [...] and dietary myristic and <b>palmitic</b> saturated fatty acids and serum <b>palmitic</b> combined with alpha-tocopherol supplementation are associated with increased risk of prostate cancer in a dose-dependent manner. These associations may, however, reflect differences in intake or metabolism of these fatty acids between the precancer cases and controls, rather than being an actual cause.|$|E

2500|$|In his 2009 book Cholesterol and The French Paradox, Frank Cooper {{argues that}} the French paradox {{is due to the}} lack of {{hydrogenated}} and trans fats in the French diet. The French diet is based on natural saturated fats such as butter, cheese and cream that the human body finds easy to metabolize, because they are rich in shorter saturated fatty acids ranging from the 4-carbon butyric acid to the 16-carbon <b>palmitic</b> acid. But the American diet includes greater amounts of saturated fats made via hydrogenating vegetable oils which include longer 18- and 20-carbon fatty acids.
