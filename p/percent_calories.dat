40|$|Self-monitoring has {{traditionally}} been done using a paper record, which can be tedious and burdensome. A personal digital assistant (PDA) with dietary software can provide an alternative to a paper record. The study aimed to describe the differences in dietary changes at 6 months between participants randomly assigned to use a paper record or PDA for self-monitoring in a clinical trial of weight-loss treatment. Self-monitoring adherence and changes in weight and diet were assessed between 2006 and 2009. The sample (n= 192) was 84 % female and 78 % white, {{with a mean age}} of 49 years and body mass index (calculated as kg/m 2) of 34. 1. At baseline, the groups did not differ in energy intake, <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> from fat, and number of servings of the examined food groups. At 6 months, both groups had significant reductions in weight, energy intake, and <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> from total fat and saturated fatty acids (P < 0. 001); no between-group differences were found. Compared to the paper record group, the PDA group significantly increased consumption of fruit (P= 0. 02) and vegetables (P= 0. 04) and decreased consumption of refined grains (P= 0. 02). Interactions among self-monitoring and the two groups were found in relation to changes in <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> from total fat (P= 0. 02), monounsaturated fatty acids (P= 0. 002), and trans-fatty acids (P= 0. 04). Frequent self-monitoring was significantly associated with total sugar (P= 0. 02) and added sugar (P= 0. 01) intake in both groups. Our findings suggest that use of a PDA for self-monitoring might improve self-awareness of behavior and dietary changes. © 2011 American Dietetic Association...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} of this investigation is to describe the associations of number of eating episodes and proportion of meals eaten away from home with total serum cholesterol. Data from 499 participants, recruited from a health maintenance organization in central Massachusetts, aged 20 - 70, were used for this analysis. Dietary information and total blood cholesterol were obtained at five sampling points (baseline and four consecutive quarters) during the one-year follow-up. A cross-sectional study was conducted. The results from the study {{do not support the}} hypothesis that the number of eating episodes per day is associated with total blood cholesterol. However, we noted that the mean concentration of total cholesterol decreased with increasing number of eating episodes among women, although the adjusted mean among three categories of number of eating episodes per day was not statistically significant. On the other hand, the results of our study suggest that increased frequency of meals (breakfast, lunch, or dinner) eaten away from home is positively associated with mean total blood cholesterol concentration. Furthermore, meals eaten away from home, especially breakfast and dinner, were significantly higher in total calories, and <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> from total and saturated fat, but lower in <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> from protein and carbohydrate, and grams of fiber, than corresponding meals eaten at home.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Background: A {{full time}} {{child-care}} program {{is expected to}} provide at least one-half to two-thirds of a child's daily nutrient requirements. As such, child-care settings have been acknowledged as an important setting for the assurance of children's nutrition and {{for the prevention of}} childhood obesity. It has been suggested that an increase in the use of in-house food preparation in child-care settings could improve the nutrient profile of menus and decrease food costs. However, a limited number of studies have examined the effect of meal preparation time on nutritional quality and food expenditure in the general population, and no studies have assessed this relationship in child-care settings. Objective: To investigate the association between meal preparation time and food expenditure and nutritional quality of menus in family child-care homes. Methods: Fifty-nine family child-care providers participated in this study. Participants recorded time spent in meal preparation and menus served over a period of five consecutive days of operation, and collected receipts for food items purchased. Multiple linear regression models were used to investigate the associations of breakfast and lunch preparation time with each - food expenditure, and nutritional quality of the menu adjusting for covariates. Nutritional quality of the menu was quantified using mean adequacy ratio (MAR), sodium Dietary Reference Intake (DRI) ratio, <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> from sugar, and <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> from trans fat. Results: There was no observed relationship between breakfast preparation time and food expenditure (p = 0. 499), although there was an inverse trend between lunch preparation time and lunch food expenditure (p = 0. 110). There was no statistically significant relationship between breakfast or lunch preparation time and indicators of nutritional quality of the menus. There was a direct trend between breakfast preparation time and percent of calories from trans fat (p = 0. 073) and a direct trend between lunch preparation time and MAR (p = 0. 073). Conclusion: In this sample, there is insufficient evidence to posit that there is a relationship between time spent in food preparation and food expenditure or measures of the nutritional quality of menus. Future research is needed to understand the role of time spent in food preparation in determining food expenditure and nutritional quality of the menus served at family child-care homes...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{determine}} the effect of high fat diet with different <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> as fat on serum leptin level in rats. Male Wistar rats, 4 weeks old, were assigned to regular chow (12 % calories as fat), a 40 % high fat diet or a 60 % high fat diet group. They ate each diet ad libitum for 5 weeks. Food intake per day was the highest in chow fed group and the lowest in 60 % high fat fed group. Although epididymal fat pad weight, plasma triglycende, free fatty acid and total cholesterol in both high fat diet groups were significantly higher than in the chow fed group, there was no difference in body weight among the three diet groups. Serum leptin in the 40 % fat and the 60 % fat diet were higher than in the chow fed group (～ 136 % and ～ 140 %, respectively). Serum leptin was strongly correlated with epididymal adipose tissue weight (r= 0. 83, P< 0. 001). These results suggest that a high fat diet increases serum leptin level, and that increased leptin level might inhibit food intake and control body weight...|$|E

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODSdIn a cross-sectional, case-control study, we studied cannabis smokers (n = 30; women, 12; men, 18; 27 6 8 years) and control subjects (n = 30) matched for age, sex, ethnicity, and BMI (276 6). Abdominal fat depots and intrahepatic fat content were quantified by magnetic resonance imaging and proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, respectively. Insulin-sensitivity indices and various aspects of b-cell function were derived from oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTT). RESULTSdSelf-reported cannabis use was: 9. 5 (2 – 38) years; joints/day: 6 (3 – 30) [median (range) ].

The aims of this study were to assess the association of antidepressant use with energy intake, macronutrient diet composition, and physical activity. We used data on medication use, energy intake, diet composition, and physical activity for 3073 eligible adults from the 2005 – 2006 National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey (NHANES). Potential confounding variables, including depression symptoms, were included in the models assessing energy intake, physical activity, and sedentary behavior. Antidepressant users reported consuming an additional (mean ± S. E.) 215 ± 73 kcal/day compared to non-users (p = 0. 01). There were no differences in <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> from sugar, fat, or alcohol between the two groups. Antidepressant users had similar frequencies of walking or biking, engaging in muscle-strengthening activities, and engaging in moderate or vigorous physical activity. Antidepressant users were more likely to use a computer for ≥ 2 h/day (OR 1. 77; 95 % CI: 1. 09 – 2. 90), but TV watching was similar between the two groups. These results suggest increased energy intake and sedentary behavior may contribute to weight gain associated with antidepressant use.

40|$|Rates of {{overweight}} and obesity {{continue to rise}} each year with serious associated health risks. This {{study was conducted to}} explore gender differences between behavior change variables for both dietary fat reduction and exercise behaviors in a weight loss population. This research also investigated relationships between these psychosocial behavior change variables. Over 300 overweight and obese men and women enrolled in weight loss programs in the greater Boston area completed self-administered surveys. The behavior change variables surveyed included validated Transtheoretical Model (TTM) measures of stage of change for dietary fat reduction, situational confidence and temptation for dietary fat reduction, as well as the Three Factor Eating Questionnaire restraint scale (TFEQ-R). Exercise variables included stage of change and situational confidence. Although significant gender differences were detected by multivariate analysis of variance (p 3 ̆c. 05), weak effect sizes suggest that gender differences for dietary confidence, temptations, or restraint were not clinically relevant. Gender was not found to {{have a significant effect on}} exercise confidence (p 3 ̆e. 05). Stage of change was found to have a significant and strong effect on each of the dietary and exercise behavioral variables under investigation (p 3 ̆c. 05). Through structural equation modeling methods, dietary restraint was found to mediate the effect between the self-efficacy variables of dietary confidence and temptations and <b>percent</b> <b>calorie</b> from fat intake. Restraint, however, was not found to be a moderator or have an interaction effect with self-efficacy variables affecting <b>percent</b> <b>calorie</b> from fat intake. Dietary restraint was not found to be a moderating or mediating variable for the exercise behavior models under investigation. Dietary restraint has not been previously studied with regard to constructs of the TTM. Stage of change was found to have a strong and significant effect on predicting dietary restraint (p 3 ̆c. 001). Results of this study suggests that while men have higher confidence scores and lower scores for temptations and restraint, weight reduction programs do not need to change intervention techniques based on gender. Results also indicate that weight loss programs would benefit from first targeting self-efficacy behaviors which could thereby influence dietary restraint leading to behavior change such as dietary fat reduction. ...|$|R

40|$|Sugar {{consumption}} in the United States exceeds recommendations from the American Heart Association. Overconsumption of sugar is linked to risk for obesity and metabolic disease. Animal studies suggest that high-sugar diets alter functions in brain regions associated with reward processing, including the dorsal and ventral striatum. Human neuroimaging {{studies have shown that}} these regions are responsive to food cues, and that the gut-derived satiety hormones, glucagon-like peptide- 1 (GLP- 1), and peptide YY (PYY), suppress striatal food-cue responsivity. We aimed to determine the associations between dietary added sugar intake, striatal responsivity to food cues, and postprandial GLP- 1 and PYY levels. Twenty-two lean volunteers underwent a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) scan during which they viewed pictures of food and non-food items after a 12 -h fast. Before scanning, participants consumed a glucose drink. A subset of 19 participants underwent an additional fMRI session in which they consumed water as a control condition. Blood was sampled for GLP- 1, and PYY levels and hunger ratings were assessed before and ~ 75 [*]min after drink consumption. In-person 24 -h dietary recalls were collected from each participant on three to six separate occasions over a 2 -month period. Average <b>percent</b> <b>calories</b> from added sugar were calculated using information from 24 -h dietary recalls. A region-of-interest analysis was performed to compare the blood oxygen level-dependent (BOLD) response to food vs. non-food cues in the bilateral dorsal striatum (caudate/putamen) and ventral striatum (nucleus accumbens). The relationships between added sugar, striatal responses, and hormone changes after drink consumption were assessed using Spearman’s correlations. We observed a positive correlation between added sugar intake and BOLD response to food cues in the dorsal striatum and a similar trend in the nucleus accumbens after glucose, but not water, consumption. Added sugar intake was negatively associated with GLP- 1 response to glucose. Post hoc analysis revealed a negative correlation between GLP- 1 response to glucose and BOLD response to food cues in the dorsal striatum. Our findings suggest that habitual added sugar intake is related to increased striatal response to food cues and decreased GLP- 1 release following glucose intake, which could contribute to susceptibility to overeating...|$|E

Individuals with income mostly made up of Social Security and savings smooth consumption over the pay period, while individuals without savings consume 25 <b>percent</b> fewer <b>calories</b> the week before they receive checks relative to the week afterwards. The findings for individuals without savings, who comprise about a fourth of our sample, are inconsistent with the standard Life Cycle- Permanent Income Hypothesis but are consistent with hyperbolic discounting.

40|$|The {{concept of}} food {{addiction}} (FA) is a potentially important contributing factor {{to the development}} of obesity in the general population; however, {{little is known about the}} hormonal and dietary differences between obesity with and without FA. Therefore, the aim of our study was to explore potential biomarkers, including various hormones and neuropeptides, which regulate appetite and metabolism, and dietary components that could potentially differentiate obesity with and without FA. Of the 737 adults recruited from the general Newfoundland population, 58 food-addicted and non-food-addicted overweight/obese individuals (FAO, NFO) matched for age, sex, BMI and physical activity were selected. A total of 34 neuropeptides, gut hormones, pituitary polypeptide hormones and adipokines were measured in fasting serum. We found that the FAO group had lower levels of TSH, TNF-α and amylin, but higher levels of prolactin, as compared to NFO group. The total calorie intake (per kg body weight), the dietary intake of fat (per g/kg body weight, per BMI and per percentage of trunk fat) and the <b>percent</b> <b>calorie</b> intake from fat and carbohydrates (g/kg) was higher in the FAO group compared to the NFO group. The FAO subjects consumed more sugar, minerals (including sodium, potassium, calcium and selenium), fat and its components (such as saturated, monounsaturated and trans fat), omega 3 and 6, vitamin D and gamma-tocopherol compared to the NFO group. To our knowledge, this is the first study indicating possible differences in hormonal levels and micro-nutrient intakes between obese individuals classified with and without food addiction. The findings provide insights into the mechanisms by which FA could contribute to obesity...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} better {{ascertain}} its possible use as an alternative fuel substrate in total parenteral nutrition, sebacate (Sb) metabolism was studied in seven overnight-fasting healthy male volunteers, who received a constant iv infusion (99 mmoles over 8 hours) of disodium sebacate. Sb oxidation rate was determined using an isotopic sebacate (disodic salt of (1 - 10) 14 C-sebacic acid) infusion (100 mu Ci from the fourth to the eighth hour of the cold sebacate infusion). Blood samples were collected during and after sebacate infusion at intervals of 30 minutes and Sb serum concentrations were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Excreted radioactivity (mu Ci/min) was measured by bubbling the expired air into an apparatus containing 3 mEq hyamine to trap CO 2 from a 20 -L Douglas-bag. CO 2 production and O 2 consumption were measured before and at 4 and 8 hours after starting the infusion. Twenty-four hour nitrogen excretion with urine was obtained. The RQ and the <b>percent</b> of <b>calories</b> derived from lipid oxidation were calculated by indirect calorimetry. The Sb serum level at the plateau phase was (mean +/- SD) 4. 54 +/- 0. 71 mumole/mL, the overall rate of tissue uptake was 180. 89 +/- 4. 50 mumole/min, and the percent oxidation was 6. 14 +/- 0. 44 %. At the end of Sb infusion the RQ dropped to 0. 839 +/- 0. 043, the <b>percent</b> of <b>calories</b> due to sebacate oxidation was 1. 59 +/- 0. 52 %, and the calories derived from lipids increased to 37. 77 +/- 12. 90 %. These data show that a definite amount of the sebacate infused is oxidized in human tissues...|$|R
40|$|The present {{prospective}} study {{was carried out}} to determine dietary fiber and energy intake and nutritional status of children during the treatment of chronic constipation. Twenty-five patients aged 2 to 12 years with chronic constipation were submitted to clinical evaluation, assessment of dietary patterns, and anthropometry before and after 45 and 90 days of treatment. The treatment of chronic constipation included rectal disimpaction, ingestion of mineral oil and diet therapy. The standardized diet prescribed consisted of regular food without a fiber supplement and met the nutrient requirements according to the recommended daily allowance. The fiber content was 9. 0 to 11. 9 g for patients aged less than 6 years and 12. 0 to 18. 0 g for patients older than 6 years. Sixteen patients completed the 90 -day follow-up and all presented clinical improvement. The anthropometric variables did not change, except midarm circumference and triceps skinfold thickness which were significantly increased. Statistically significant increases were also found in <b>percent</b> <b>calorie</b> intake adequacy in terms of recommended daily allowance (55. 5 to 76. 5 % on day 45 and to 68. 5 % on day 90; P = 0. 047). Percent adequacy of minimum recommended daily intake of dietary fiber (age + 5 g) increased during treatment (from 46. 8 to 52. 8 % on day 45 and to 56. 3 % on day 90; P = 0. 009). Food and dietary fiber intake and triceps skinfold thickness increased during follow-up. We conclude that the therapeutic program provided a good clinical outcome.
