The previously observed low shear strength interfacial layers generated in <b>pin-on-disk</b> tracks by Al 2 O 3 ball counter surfaces on CuO-doped 3 Y-TZP, as well as virgin surfaces, were probed quantitatively by AFM with Si 3 N 4 tips as the counter surface.

40|$|Abstract: The {{purpose of}} this work was to {{evaluate}} the mechanical properties and the correlations of mechanical properties of a state-of-the-art nanostructured hardfacing filler metal deposited by SMAW process. The nanostructured hardfacing deposit was characterized as hypereutectic with high abrasion resistance due to the combination of presence of nanocarbides in a nanostructured matrix, high carbide volume fraction and high hardness. FE-SEM and BED were used to obtain the Niobium carbides at nanoscale which were around 91 nm. A carbide volume fraction of 5. 3 % for Niobium carbides at nanoscale was associated to the low mass loss obtained after performing the abrasion tests. Nonetheless, there was not any relationship between percentage of dilution and microstructure, since after evaluating the second layer-application the results {{very similar to those}} found in the single-layer application. The hardness of the deposit was around 1029 HV 2 on single-layer application was related to the presence of carbides. However, it explains the lack of relationship between hardness and welding parameters within the range stablished at the welding procedure specification. SEM images, allowed to characterize the cracks found as hot cracks which clearly stated the harmless impact on these kinds of welding applications. A comparison between the <b>pin-on-disk</b> results and the dry sand/rubber results and the results showed that the variation in mass loss was related to the nature of each abrasive test. Additional experiments were performed to achieve the differences in mass loss between base metal and the nanostructured hardfacing application for the <b>pin-on-disk</b> tests.

40|$|The {{increasing}} {{requirements of}} drilling fluids in long extended reach wells desires for new solutions to solve {{torque and drag}} problems in the wellbore. Nanotechnology is an upcoming technology development, which is already used in other industries to minimize friction coefficients of lubrication fluids in hydraulic hoses. Drilling fluids act also as a lubrication fluid in the wellbore, besides of many other functions it has to fulfill. It {{is well known that}} oil based muds (OBM) are characterized with a better lubrication efficiency than water based muds (WBM). Out of this reason, research interest increases about successfully implementing nanoparticles to drilling fluids, especially to WBM, for reducing the generated mechanical friction between drill string and casing. Within this framework of thesis, tribological and rheological experiments were performed to investigate whether friction reduction can be achieved with alumina, titania or silica nanoparticles. Different particle concentrations in the fluid were tested to see, if lubrication efficiency can be defined to a specific particle concentration. Additionally, the nanoparticle added fluids were tested under different temperature condition to determine the influence on temperature towards nanoparticles. The experimental phase of the thesis was performed with a <b>pin-on-disk</b> apparatus and a modular compact rheometer (MCR), which allowed tribology and viscosity measurements.
