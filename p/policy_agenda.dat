40|$|At the {{beginning}} of each Parliamentary session, almost all European governments give a speech in which they present the government’s policy goals and legislative agenda for the year to come. Despite the enormous body of literature on governments in European parliamentary democracies, systematic work on these executive <b>policy</b> <b>agendas</b> is surprisingly limited. In this paper we compare the evolvement of executive <b>policy</b> <b>agendas</b> - measured through the annual government speeches in four West European countries, UK, Spain, the Netherlands and Denmark over the past 50 years.

The chapter suggests that these encounters are important places to explore the ways in which ‘ordinary’ family practices are troubled by <b>policy</b> <b>agendas</b> which may conflict with women’s embodied experiences, culturally held ideas about feeding babies and contemporary notions about what constitutes a good mother and a healthy baby.

Firstly, what broader <b>policy</b> <b>agendas</b> are impinging on the way business and accounting is being constructed within secondary schools in Scotland? Secondly, how do teachers of business and accounting view the broader social and ethical dimensions of their subject? And thirdly, what {{is the impact of}} both the broader <b>policy</b> <b>agendas</b> and teacher's perspectives on the way accounting and business are constructed and experienced by students from different socio-economic backgrounds?

25|$|Faith Ryan Whittlesey (born 1939) is {{a former}} Pennsylvania Republican {{politician}} and White House Senior Staff member notable for her effort to communicate Reagan's entire <b>policy</b> <b>agenda</b> to U.S. opinion leaders and for bringing {{together for the first}} time in the Reagan White House evangelical, Catholic, and other conservative religious groups who opposed legalized abortion and were concerned about moral and cultural decline and the break-up of the family. These groups became a significant component of the Reagan coalition as they grew more politically self-conscious in the 1980s. Whittlesey also organized the White House Central American Outreach Group at the direction of Chief of Staff James Baker to provide information about Reagan's anti-communist policies in the region and was an active supporter of Reagan's defense buildup and the Strategic Defense Initiative (SDI).

25|$|In November 2003, at the University of Exeter, Kirby {{delivered}} the Hamlyn Lectures {{on the subject}} of judicial activism. Rejecting the doctrine of strict constructionism, Kirby declared that:Clearly it would be wrong for a judge to set out in pursuit of a personal <b>policy</b> <b>agenda</b> and hang the law. Yet it would also be wrong, and futile, for a judge to pretend that the solutions to all of the complex problems of the law today, unresolved by incontestably clear and applicable texts, can be answered by the application of nothing more than purely verbal reasoning and strict logic to words written by judges in earlier times about the problems they then faced... contrary to myth, judges do more than simply apply law. They have a role in making it and always have.These lectures sparked a debate in the Australian media, echoing an ongoing debate in the United States, as to whether judges have the right to interpret the law in the light of its intent and considerations of natural law or whether judges should (or can) simply follow the letter of the law, leaving questions of its intent and underlying principles to elected representatives.|$|E
40|$|The {{literature}} on descriptive and substantive representation focuses on elected representatives, but overlooks {{the gender of}} those who play an integral role in policy process (agenda-setting) and outcomes (implementation) : The elected’s chief of staff, senior policy advisors, and, in council-manager systems, the city manager. This thesis examines the role policy staff and city manager gender plays in substantive representation. After analyzing staff composition and agenda priorities — gleaned from State of the City addresses — for mayors of the 50 most-populous cities in the United States, I found substantial evidence to support my hypotheses that the chief of staff’s gender, not the elected’s gender, will drive the overall gender of staff {{as well as the}} gender characterization of <b>policy</b> <b>agendas.</b> Mayors — regardless of gender — with female chiefs of staff in this dataset have more female staffers and more neutral <b>policy</b> <b>agendas.</b> Mayors — regardless of gender — with male chiefs of staff have more male staffers and mostly masculine policy. In weak mayor systems, city managers’ gender strongly influences mayoral <b>policy</b> <b>agendas,</b> especially in small cities; since most city managers are male, those <b>policy</b> <b>agendas</b> are more masculine, regardless of the mayor’s and chief of staff’s gender. Thus, I find that staff who are involved in the intricacies of policy process and outcome have a stronger influence on policy than the public-facing elected official. These results, supplemented by interviews with mayors and chiefs of staff from across the country, could change the importance scholars place on descriptive representation, and alter scholars’ approach to studying both substantive representation for women and American democracy in general...|$|R

In the first section I explore Lacanian ideas of extimacy, excess and Möbius subjectivity to subvert a simplistic self-other dichotomy and briefly consider some implications of this subversion for neoliberal educational policy. In the second part of the paper, I extend the critique of neoliberal education policy by examining it through the lens of Lacan’s four discourses. This involves viewing neoliberal <b>policy</b> <b>agendas</b> in terms of “discourses of mastery, ” before turning to “discourses of thinking otherwise ” as a way of thinking what “the other side of education ” might look like...|$|R
