50|$|During {{the early}} 19th century, the {{development}} of machine tools such as the screw-cutting lathe, metal <b>planer,</b> <b>and</b> <b>milling</b> <b>machine,</b> <b>and</b> of toolpath control via jigs and fixtures, provided the prerequisites for the modern assembly line by making interchangeable parts a practical reality.|$|R
25|$|The {{development}} of machine tools, {{such as the}} engine lathe, <b>planing,</b> <b>milling</b> <b>and</b> shaping <b>machines</b> powered by these engines, enabled all the metal parts of the engines to be easily and accurately cut and in turn {{made it possible to}} build larger and more powerful engines.|$|R
50|$|In {{the late}} seventeenth century, before the {{development}} of the <b>planer</b> <b>and</b> the <b>milling</b> <b>machine,</b> it was extremely difficult to machine straight, flat surfaces. For this reason, good prismatic pairs without backlash were not easy to make. During that era, much thought was given to the problem of attaining a straight-line motion {{as a part of the}} coupler curve of a linkage having only revolute connection. Probably the best-known result of this search is the straight line mechanism development by Watt for guiding the piston of early steam engines. Although it does not generate an exact straight line, a good approximation is achieved over a considerable distance of travel.|$|R
