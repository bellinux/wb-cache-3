5|$|Elements in {{the same}} <b>period</b> show trends in atomic radius, {{ionization}} energy, electron affinity, and electronegativity. Moving left to right across a <b>period,</b> atomic radius usually decreases. This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and electron, which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus. This decrease in atomic radius also causes the ionization energy to increase when moving {{from left to right}} across a <b>period.</b> The more tightly bound an element is, the more energy is required to remove an electron. Electronegativity increases {{in the same}} manner as ionization energy because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus. Electron affinity also shows a slight trend across a <b>period.</b> Metals (left side of a <b>period)</b> generally have a lower electron affinity than nonmetals (right side of a <b>period),</b> with the exception of the noble gases.|$|E

5|$|Intact and {{relatively}} detailed histories of Greece, such as Herodotus's The Histories, Thucydides's History of the Peloponnesian War, and Xenophon's Hellenica cover the <b>period</b> from roughly 500–362 BC. No extant history specifically covers the relevant <b>period</b> of Greek history (359–336 BC), {{although it is}} included within various universal histories. The main source for the <b>period</b> is Diodorus Siculus's Bibliotheca historica, written in the 1st century BC, which is therefore a secondary source. Diodorus devotes Book XVI to the <b>period</b> of Philip's reign, but the action is much compressed, and due to {{the scope of the}} work, this book also contains details of happenings during the same <b>period</b> elsewhere in the ancient world. Diodorus is often derided by modern historians for his style and inaccuracies, but he preserves many details of the ancient <b>period</b> found nowhere else. Diodorus worked primarily by epitomising the works of other historians, omitting many details where they did not suit his purpose, which was to illustrate moral lessons from history; his account of the <b>period</b> therefore contains many gaps.|$|E

5|$|The Earth {{is passing}} through an ice age {{known as the}} {{quaternary}} glaciation, and is presently in the Holocene interglacial <b>period.</b> This <b>period</b> would normally be expected to end in about 25,000 years. However, the increased rate of carbon dioxide release into the atmosphere by humans may delay {{the onset of the}} next glacial <b>period</b> until at least 50,000–130,000 years from now. On the other hand, a global warming <b>period</b> of finite duration (based on the assumption that fossil fuel use will cease by the year 2200) will probably only impact the glacial <b>period</b> for about 5,000 years. Thus, a brief <b>period</b> of global warming induced through a few centuries worth of greenhouse gas emission would only have a limited impact in the long term.|$|E
5|$|The Japanese Sengoku <b>period</b> {{from the}} mid-15th to early 17th century {{was a time}} of nearly continual {{military}} conflict.
