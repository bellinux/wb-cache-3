The effects of retinal axons on the streptavidin–biotin-CS complex were analyzed immunocytochemically using antibodies against CS and streptavidin, which recognize the carbohydrate and protein portions of the complex, respectively. After the axons were cultured on the substrate, areas that were CS-immunonegative but streptavidin-immunopositive were observed on the surface, corresponding to areas with or without axons, respectively.

40|$|In recent years, {{as human}} {{pluripotent}} stem cells (hPSCs) have been commonly cultured in feeder-free conditions, a number of cell <b>culture</b> <b>substrates</b> have been applied or developed. However, the functional roles of these substrates in maintaining hPSC self-renewal remain unclear. Here in this review, we summarize the types of these substrates and their effect on maintaining hPSC self-renewal. Endogenous extracellular matrix (ECM) protein expression {{has been shown to}} be crucial in maintaining hPSC self-renewal. These ECM molecules interact with integrin cell-surface receptors and transmit their cellular signaling. We discuss the possible effect of integrin-mediated signaling pathways on maintaining hPSC self-renewal. Activation of integrin-linked kinase (ILK), which transmits ECM-integrin signaling to AKT (also known as protein kinase B), {{has been shown to be}} critical in maintaining hPSC self-renewal. Also, since naïve pluripotency has been widely recognized as an alternative pluripotent state of hPSCs, we discuss the possible effects of <b>culture</b> <b>substrates</b> and integrin signaling on naïve hPSCs based on the studies of mouse embryonic stem cells. Understanding the role of <b>culture</b> <b>substrates</b> in hPSC self-renewal and differentiation enables us to control hPSC behavior precisely and to establish scalable or microfabricated culture technologies for regenerative medicine and drug development...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} {{found that}} a neutrophil serine protease, cathepsin G, weakens adherence to <b>culture</b> <b>substrates</b> and induces E-cadherin-dependent aggregation of MCF- 7 human breast cancer cells through its protease activity. In this study, we examined whether aggregation is caused by degradation of adhesion molecules on the <b>culture</b> <b>substrates</b> or through an unidentified mechanism. We compared the effect of treatment with cathepsin G and other proteases, including neutrophil elastase against fibronectin- (FN-) coated substrates. Cathepsin G and elastase potently degraded FN on the substrates and induced aggregation of MCF- 7 cells that had been subsequently seeded onto the substrate. However, substrate-bound cathepsin G and elastase may have caused cell aggregation. After inhibiting the proteases on the <b>culture</b> <b>substrates</b> using the irreversible inhibitor phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (PMSF), we examined whether aggregation of MCF- 7 cells was suppressed. PMSF attenuated cell aggregation on cathepsin G-treated substrates, but the effect was weak in cells pretreated with high concentrations of cathepsin G. In contrast, PMSF did not suppress cell aggregation on elastase-treated FN. Moreover, cathepsin G, but not elastase, induced aggregation on poly-L-lysine substrates which are not decomposed by these enzymes, and the action of cathepsin G was nearly completely attenuated by PMSF. These results suggest that cathepsin G induces MCF- 7 aggregation through a cell-oriented mechanism...|$|R

With the aim to establish elastic <b>culture</b> <b>substrates</b> that reproduce the variable softness of dermis, we determined Young’s elastic modulus E of human dermis at the cell perception level using atomic force microscopy. The E of dermis ranged from 0. 1 to 10 kPa, varied depending on body area and dermal layer, and tended to increase with age in 26 – 55 -year-old donors. The activation state of human dermal fibroblasts cultured on “skin-soft” E (5 kPa) silicone <b>culture</b> <b>substrates</b> was compared with stiff plastic culture (GPa), collagen gel cultures (0. 1 – 9 kPa), and fresh human dermal tissue. Fibroblasts cultured on skin-soft silicones displayed low mRNA levels of fibrosis-associated genes and increased expression of the matrix metalloproteinases (MMPs) MMP- 1 and MMP- 3 as compared with collagen gel and plastic cultures. The activation profile exhibited by fibroblasts on “skin-soft” silicone <b>culture</b> <b>substrates</b> was most comparable with that of human dermis than any other tested culture condition.

In this study we used mouse MSCs that were genetically modified using lentiviral vectors, which encoded brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) or glial cell-derived neurotrophic factor (GDNF), together with green fluorescent protein (GFP). Before proceeding with in vivo transplant studies it was important to characterize the engineered cells to determine whether or not the genetic modification altered aspects of normal cell behavior. Different <b>culture</b> <b>substrates</b> were examined for their ability to support cell adhesion, proliferation, survival, and cell migration of the four subpopulations of engineered MSCs.
