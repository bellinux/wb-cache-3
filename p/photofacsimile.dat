[...] In 1924 he went over the same ground again in a somewhat more popular vein, including a more extensive commentary. [...] Subsequent publications of BM 10474 in hieroglyphic transcription include those of H.O. Lange (1925), J. Ruffle (1964), and V. Laisney (2007). Photographic copies of the papyrus {{are available from the}} British Museum.|$|E

This satellite system appears to haw unintentioiially optimized resolution, tonal contrast, the base/height ratio, and exposure interval compared to these parameters of othcr systems. Theoretically, without cloud motion, cloud heights to an accuracy of about 1 km. {{can be obtained}} from thc photography. This limit is the equivalent of a 17 m. sec. -l cloud speed along the z-axis of the pictures. In practice cloud heights to an accuracy of about 2 km. are reasonable. An illustration shows clouds at seven different relative heights. 1...|$|E
40|$|The Nimbus 4 temperature-humidity {{infrared}} radiometer (THIR) monitors radiation in the 6. 5 to 7. 2 -micron water vapor absorption region with a 23 -km spatial resolution at the subsatellite point. Radiation monitored in this spectral region results primarily from emission in the 250 to 500 -mb {{region of the}} upper troposphere. The THIR 6. 7 -micron observations are readily available in <b>photofacsimile</b> imagery form which shows very distinctive patterns associated with spatial variations in atmospheric water vapor. These radiometric observations have been combined in several instances with moisture values measured in the upper troposphere by the standard radiosonde network. In each instance, {{the result is a}} much more consistent analysis showing increased spatial detail that agrees with the radiometric observations and does not compromise the conventional data. The improved moisture analyses show relatively dry and moist tongues that are very difficult or impossible to infer from the conventional data alone...|$|E
