40|$|The {{sickness}} absence {{records of}} 1, 115 <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> {{in the highlands}} of Scotland during 1958 were examined. Only absences of four days or more were considered. Two hundred and seventy of the workers were established and were therefore entitled to retirement pensions. There was {{a high proportion of}} older men among the established workers; but the sickness record of these men was generally better than that of the unestablished workers except in respect of cardiovascular disease, rheumatism, and arthritis. Among <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> as a whole, accidsnts off duty accounted for more sickness absence than accidents on duty, a reversal of the finding in the male working population at large. The second most important cause of sickness absence was back troubles of all kinds.

40|$|This {{working paper}} sets out the case for a world-pioneering <b>Permanent</b> <b>Forest</b> Bond which {{belongs to the}} wider classes of green and climate-aligned bonds. The {{innovation}} {{is not only to}} fill a funding gap for budget-constrained government entities, it is to shift the environmental spending paradigm so that the New Zealand Government pays for positive environmental results rather than services.   The foundations for the <b>Permanent</b> <b>Forest</b> Bond are based upon the idea of an Environmental Impact Bond, built upon pay-for-performance contracts.  The Environmental Impact Bond is an extension of a Social Impact Bond, of which there are now over 60 issued worldwide. However, the impact bond model is better suited for environmental impacts than social impacts, particularly because measurement is less controversial and better established.   A major advantage of Environmental Impact Bonds over Social Impact Bonds is the preexisting science and economics of monitoring and valuing environmental assets. This working paper concludes that an Environmental Impact Bond model could plausibly be adapted to address the challenge of afforestation in New Zealand. A <b>Permanent</b> <b>Forest</b> Bond is technically feasible, in certain ways more feasible than the Social Impact Bonds that are currently under development in New Zealand. Theses advantages include the pre-existence of established conventions for environmental measurement and monitoring; the creation of “hard assets” that can generate revenue streams that are well-understood; and the potential avoidance of costs to the nation’s long-term prosperity that are large and often quantifiable. There is, however, no guarantee that a <b>Permanent</b> <b>Forest</b> Bond would succeed. The reasons for this need not be because the model itself is essentially flawed, but because successful implementation depend on the contingencies of the actual negotiation process, including the conduct of the parties involved and the strength of their commitment to the shared goal of expanding <b>permanent</b> <b>forest.</b>  ...|$|R

40|$|This study {{deals with}} how workers {{actively}} {{introduced a new}} technique to their own labour process. More specifically, it is concerned with how Swedish <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> during the 1950 s gradually replaced the manual one-man crosscut saw with the motor-driven saw. The workers’ own views and actions are of central importance {{to the analysis of}} this process of technical change. Therefore fifty elderly <b>forest</b> <b>workers,</b> who had worked in forests in the county of Västerbotten in northern Sweden, were inter­viewed. The point of departure of the study {{is the fact that it}} was the <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> themselves who financed and bought the chain saw. The study indicates that there were two main reasons for acquiring a chain saw. The <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> hoped to lessen the physical work load and to improve their wages. The first workers to use the chain saw I called ”the pioneers”. They had made some, but rather little, acquaintance with the chain saw before they started to use it. They were often disappointed with the new tool. In the middle of the 1950 s, the construction of the chain saws was improved and, as a result, the chain saw made its breakthrough in the second half of the 1950 s. Those who bought the chain saw during this period were clearly more pleased with it than the pioneers had been. A few years into the 1960 s, when almost all <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> had bought a chain saw, unemployment slowly started to increase. Simultaneously, the piecework wage system began to change. The chain saws were by this time becoming very efficient, and the benefit could and would not go solely to the <b>forest</b> <b>workers.</b> Employers and <b>forest</b> owners were also to have a share and they manifested this will in the wage negotiations. The <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> responded by increasing their work tempo, to make the salaries remain at a high level, at least for the most efficient workers. For others, the older and those who were less productive, things became harder. The increase in work intensity brought with it an increase in accidents and injuries. The workers’ satisfaction in their job deteriorated. The lesson the <b>forest</b> <b>workers</b> learned, and this guided their actions when new machines were introduced later, was that it was important to act as a collective. Equally important, however, was the insight that good working conditions and a positive wage development do not only depend on technology, but on the social order in which the technology is embedded. digitalisering@um...|$|R

The high prevalence of RP in chain saw operators was attributed to a traumatic vasospastic disease (TVD). The average time of latency was eight years.
