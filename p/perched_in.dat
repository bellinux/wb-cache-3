5|$|The red-capped robin mostly pounces on prey on the ground, {{although}} it can swoop and catch creatures while airborne. Less often, it gleans (takes prey while <b>perched)</b> <b>in</b> low-lying vegetation, almost always less than 3m (10ft) above the ground. The prey is most commonly on the ground when caught, although airborne insects are sometimes taken. A low branch {{may be used as}} a vantage point in hunting.|$|E
5|$|In captive Egyptian fruit bats, 70% of the {{directed}} calls {{could be}} identified as to which bat made it, and 60% could be categorised into four contexts: squabbling over food, jostling over position in their sleeping cluster, protesting over mating attempts and arguing when <b>perched</b> <b>in</b> close proximity to each other. The animals made slightly different sounds when communicating with different individuals, especially one of the opposite sex. Male hammerheaded bats produce deep, resonating, monotonous calls to attract females. Bats in flight make vocal signal for traffic control. Individual greater bulldog bats honk when {{on a collision course}} with each other.|$|E
5|$|On 1November1975, Lockheed and Northrop {{were each}} awarded $1.5-million {{contracts}} {{to proceed with}} Phase 1 of XST. During a four-month period, the two companies were each required to construct full-scale wooden mock-ups, which would then be evaluated at the USAF's Radar Target Scatter (RATSCAT) test facility at White Sands, New Mexico. To test the design's radar returns, Lockheed erected a $187,000 specially built pole upon which the model would be <b>perched.</b> <b>In</b> March1976, a Lockheed model {{was transferred to the}} range before being tested; the following month Lockheed was pronounced the winner because the Northrop XST had a much higher side hemisphere RCS. DARPA, having realized the progress accumulated throughout the study, urged the Northrop team to remain together. The agency would later initiate the Battlefield Surveillance Aircraft-Experimental (BSAX), which evolved into the Tacit Blue and, ultimately, the B-2 bomber.|$|E

5|$|A {{majority}} of starling predators are avian. The typical response of starling groups {{is to take}} flight, with a common sight being undulating flocks of starling flying high in quick and agile patterns. Their abilities in flight are seldom matched by birds of prey. Adult common starlings are hunted by hawks such as the northern goshawk (Accipiter gentilis) and Eurasian sparrowhawk (Accipiter nisus), and falcons including the peregrine falcon (Falco peregrinus), Eurasian hobby (Falco subbuteo) and common kestrel (Falco tinnunculus). Slower raptors like black and red kites (Milvus migrans & milvus), eastern imperial eagle (Aquila heliaca), common buzzard (Buteo buteo) and Australasian harrier (Circus approximans) tend to take the more easily caught fledglings or juveniles. While <b>perched</b> <b>in</b> groups by night, they can be vulnerable to owls, including the little owl (Athene noctua), long-eared owl (Asio otus), short-eared owl (Asio flammeus), barn owl (Tyto alba), tawny owl (Strix aluco) and Eurasian eagle-owl (Bubo bubo).|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its size}} and gaudy coloration, this vulture is quite {{inconspicuous}} when it is <b>perched</b> <b>in</b> trees. While perched, it holds its head lowered and thrust forward. It is non-migratory and, unlike the turkey, lesser yellow-headed and American black vulture, it generally lives alone or in small family groups. Groups of up to 12 birds have been observed bathing and drinking in a pool above a waterfall in Belize. One or two birds generally descend to feed at a carcass, although occasionally up to ten or so may gather if there is significant amount of food. King vultures have lived up to 30 years in captivity, though their lifespan in the wild is unknown. This vulture uses urohidrosis, defecating on its legs, to lower its body temperature. Despite its bill and large size, it is relatively unaggressive at a kill. The king vulture lacks a voice box, although it can make low croaking noises and wheezing sounds in courtship, and bill-snapping noises when threatened. Its only natural predators are snakes, which will prey upon the vulture's eggs and young, and large cats such as jaguars, which may surprise and kill an adult vulture at a carcass.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the threat}} this move was for the new king of the Franks, an {{agreement}} between Pepin and Stephen II settled, {{in exchange for the}} formal royal anointing, the descent of the Franks in Italy. In 754 the Lombard army, deployed in defence of the Locks in Val di Susa, was defeated by the Franks. Aistulf, <b>perched</b> <b>in</b> Pavia, had to accept a treaty that required the delivery of hostages and territorial concessions, but two years later resumed the war against the pope, who in turn called on the Franks.|$|E

25|$|A second, longer eastern ridge {{runs out}} {{to the north of}} Bowscale Fell, forming the {{northern}} wall of Bullfell Beck. This has two subsidiary tops at 2,017ft and 1,981ft and ends steeply at Raven Crag above the Mungrisdale to Heskett Newmarket road. <b>Perched</b> <b>in</b> a bowl scooped out on the northern face of this ridge is Bowscale Tarn. This is a classic corrie tarn, held in by a whalebacked moraine and having a depth of around 60ft. Bowscale Tarn was a popular tourist attraction in Victorian times, visitors being brought by pony to observe its wild and moody setting. Tastes change and the tarn now finds itself on few itineraries for a grand tour of the District. Legend had it that the tarn was home to two immortal fish, one version of the tale also crediting them with the gift of speech. Above the water is Tarn Crag, the steepest face on the fell.|$|E
25|$|Kate {{heard the}} crash, and knew an {{eastbound}} passenger train {{was due in}} Moingona about midnight, stopping shortly before heading east over the Des Moines River and then Honey Creek. She found the surviving crew members and shouted that she would get help, having to cross the Des Moines River bridge along the way. Although she started with a lantern, it went out, and she crawled the span {{on her hands and}} knees with only lightning for illumination. Once across, she had to cover about two miles on ground to the Moingona depot to sound the alarm. She then led a party back to rescue two of the crew members. Edgar Wood, <b>perched</b> <b>in</b> a tree, grasped a rope thrown to him, and came ashore hand-over-hand. Adam Agar couldn't be reached until the floodwaters began to recede. Pat Donahue's corpse was eventually found in a cornfield a quarter mile downstream from the bridge, but A.P. Olmsted was never found. The passenger train was stopped at Scranton, with about 200 aboard.|$|E

40|$|Predation {{is widely}} {{regarded}} as a means to prevent or minimise the establishment of a stunted (high density of slow growing individuals) population. We investigated the effect of predation on two different white perch Morone americana populations (stunted and nonstunted) by examining the stomach contents of piscivorous fishes. White perch and gizzard shad dominated piscivore diets in Branched Oak Lake, whereas white perch dominated piscivore diets in Pawnee Lake. White <b>perch</b> consumed <b>in</b> the stunted population (Branched Oak Lake) were larger and older than white <b>perch</b> consumed <b>in</b> the nonstunted population (Pawnee Lake). Many of the consumed white <b>perch</b> <b>in</b> the stunted population were sexually mature and had the opportunity to spawn at least once. In contrast, all of the consumed white <b>perch</b> <b>in</b> the nonstunted population were sexually immature. Predation may have reinforced the stunting of white <b>perch</b> <b>in</b> Branched Oak Lake through removal of the largest, oldest individuals...|$|R

500|$|Social birds, blue-faced {{honeyeaters}} can be noisy {{when they}} congregate. When feeding in groups, birds seem {{to keep in}} {{contact with each other}} by soft chirping calls. In Mackay, a bird would fly up [...] above the treetops calling excitedly to its flock, who would follow and fly around in what was likened to an aerial corroboree, seemingly at play. A single bird was recorded aping and playing with an immature Australian magpie (Gymnorhina tibicen) in Proserpine, Queensland. The blue-faced honeyeater has been reported to be fond of bathing; a flock of 15–20 birds were observed diving into pools one bird at a time, while others were <b>perched</b> <b>in</b> surrounding treetops preening.|$|E
500|$|Sparrow and {{his crew}} attempt to rob the new bank of St. Martin. The robbery is a success, but all the gold in it had fallen while they were {{dragging}} the locker, and Sparrow's crew abandons him. Despondent, Jack trades his magical compass for a drink. However, this betrayal of the compass releases an old enemy of Sparrow, whom holds a serious grudge against him; the ruthless undead pirate hunter Captain Salazar. Years previously, Jack had defeated Salazar by tricking him into sailing his ship into the Devil's Triangle, where Salazar {{and his crew}} were cursed to live as the undead. Salazar states that Jack <b>perched</b> <b>in</b> the ship's rigging like a [...] "little bird", earning him the name [...] "Jack the Sparrow". It was during this event that Jack received his compass, {{as well as his}} characteristic gear.|$|E
500|$|A {{newsletter}} dated 4 April 1461 {{reported a}} widely circulated figure of 28,000casualties in the battle, which Charles Ross and other historians believe was exaggerated. The number {{was taken from}} the heralds' estimate of the dead and appeared in letters from Edward and the Bishop of Salisbury, Richard Beauchamp. Other contemporary sources gave higher numbers, ranging from 30,000 to 38,000; Hall quoted an exact figure of 36,776. [...] An exception was the Annales rerum anglicarum, which stated the Lancastrians had 9,000casualties—an estimate Ross found to be more believable. [...] The Lancastrian nobility had heavy losses. Trollope and Northumberland fell in battle, and Lord Dacre was said to have been killed by an archer who was <b>perched</b> <b>in</b> a [...] "bur tree" [...] (a local term for an elder). [...] Conversely, the Yorkists lost only one notable member of the gentry—Horne—at Towton.|$|E

500|$|The title track, {{which was}} not {{featured}} on the original LP, was recorded after the album's release {{at the suggestion of}} Peggy Harris, the artist who designed the Winter collage for the inner sleeve of the LP. Initially, Scott-Heron and Jackson meant for Winter in America to lack a title track, which contrasted their previous label's trend of having their work include title tracks. The album title's purpose meant only to describe the general theme of Winter in Americas songs. According to Scott-Heron, a title track [...] "separates {{from the rest of the}} lyrics, better, or worse or different." [...] The studio version of [...] "Winter in America" [...] was released on his following album, The First Minute of a New Day (1975), while a live version, recorded in 1982 at Washington, D.C.'s Black Wax Club, was included on the 1998 CD reissue of Winter in America. The song features Scott-Heron's poetic references and lyrics that portray America in a dystopian state where [...] "democracy is rag-time on the corner", [...] "the forest is buried beneath the highway", [...] "robins are <b>perched</b> <b>in</b> barren treetops", and, in conclusion, [...] "no one is fighting because no one knows what to say." ...|$|E
