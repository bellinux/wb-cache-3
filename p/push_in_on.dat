25|$|By 30 March the 1,800 {{rifles and}} sabres of the 145th Regiment (46th Division) from the Ottoman Seventh Army based at Nablus, which {{had crossed the}} Jordan River at Jisr ed Damieh to attack Kufr Huda the day before, were {{arriving}} near Es Salt and threatening the occupation of the town by Shea's force. During the night of 30/31 March, these Ottoman reinforcements continued to <b>push</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Es Salt.|$|E
50|$|Though {{there is}} a <b>push</b> <b>in</b> India <b>on</b> digital governance, Right to Information has seen a neglect even after 11 years of its enactment.|$|R
2500|$|... hen {{the camera}} {{at the end}} of the film has those {{beautiful}} shots of the young boy, the young Alan, and he's meeting with the professor who's telling him his friend Christopher is dead, and the camera is <b>pushing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> him, I play Christopher's theme that we heard very early <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the film. There's a simple continuity there. It's the accumulation of these moments that I can slowly but surely play that make it even stronger.|$|R
50|$|On many Cadillac {{models of}} the 1950s and '60s, the antenna could be raised and lowered by pulling out or <b>pushing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the radio's volume control knob. The Lincoln Continental of the late 1960s had {{push-button}} controls integrated into the factory radio. But most cars had a separate control that often was not even located near the car radio. And sometimes the control on early models was not even labeled, e.g., the late 1960s, early '70s Ford Thunderbird control was integrated into a courtesy light module on the dash panel.|$|R
50|$|The {{magazine}} {{release is}} located {{on the front of the}} grip making it easy to locate and also makes it ambidextrous as well since it is equally well placed for both right and left handed shooters. This is more of a problem for people with smaller hands where the finger tips may lay on the front of the handle when gripping the gun. Typically ejecting a magazine requires retracting your middle finger and <b>pushing</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the release with the finger tip. The eject button is difficult to depress with the middle part of the finger.|$|R
60|$|Meanwhile Ravonino and {{his party}} <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> hot haste towards their place of refuge in the wild forest.|$|R
6000|$|... "They'd make a bowl-fight or a {{football}} rush look tame," [...] panted Murray. [...] "Hey! Scotty--lock up tight {{down in the}} basement. For Heaven's sake don't let that <b>push</b> get <b>in</b> <b>on</b> us! Lock {{the windows in the}} front." ...|$|R
60|$|Then Dick turned, <b>pushing</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> a northerly {{direction}} {{at right}} angles with the course he had just been pursuing, and halting at five-minute intervals to shout.|$|R
60|$|Poor little face, {{distorted}} {{with terror}} and agony! One of the policemen recognised {{it as the}} child of the public-house in Tibb's Alley. There were moans, but no one dared to uncover the limbs; and the policeman and Mr. Hope proposed carrying it at once to Mr. Bowles, and then home. Mr. Kendal desired {{that it should be}} laid on the seat of the carriage, which he would drive gently to the doctor's. Genevieve got in to watch over the poor little boy, and the others walked on by the side, passed the battle-field, now entirely deserted, too much shocked for aught but conjectures on his injuries, and the cause of the misfortune. Either he must have been <b>pushed</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> the fire by the runaway rabble, or have trod upon some of the scattered combustibles.|$|R
5000|$|Dewey is an {{important}} source for Rand's underlying sentiment <b>in</b> graphic design; <b>on</b> page one of Rand's groundbreaking Thoughts on Design, the author begins drawing lines from Dewey's philosophy {{to the need for}} [...] "functional-aesthetic perfection" [...] in modern art. Among the ideas Rand <b>pushed</b> <b>in</b> Thoughts <b>on</b> Design was the practice of creating graphic works capable of retaining recognizable quality even after being blurred or mutilated, a test Rand routinely performed on his corporate identities.|$|R
50|$|Tornado pushed Devastator {{straight}} into Mr. Psycho in the CPZ, {{and when it}} escaped, chased them {{to the top of}} the arena, and pushed them towards Matilda. Devastator got stuck in another CPZ with both House Robots whilst Tornado went after Saw Point. Ewe 2 hit the Pit Release button, and after a few attempts, <b>pushed</b> Saw Point <b>in.</b> Then Ewe 2 and Tornado teamed up to <b>push</b> Devastator <b>in</b> <b>on</b> top of Saw Point.|$|R
60|$|Antonio put Harold's {{question}} without Disco's comment, and Marizano {{replied that}} his master was an Arab trader, {{and added that}} he would <b>push</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> advance {{of the party and}} inform him of their approach.|$|R
60|$|In {{order that}} the reader may fully {{understand}} the cause of Little Tim's absence, we will take the liberty of <b>pushing</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> advance of the search party, and explain a few matters as we go.|$|R
5000|$|Shakman {{also spoke}} about the {{direction}} for the scene between Samwell Tarly and Gilly at the Citadel, noting that despite {{the importance of the}} information that Gilly was revealing regarding Rhaegar Targaryen, his intent was to focus primarly on John Bradley as Sam, saying [...] "I knew the information was huge, and there's no need to underline it at all. I put all of that information off-camera and <b>pushed</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> John Bradley as he was dealing with the crisis of the moment, which was his frustration with the maesters and ultimately coming to the conclusion that he doesn't {{want to be a part}} of it anymore. The fact that it happens to be dropping a giant piece of information about Jon's lineage and his claim to the throne, I felt it was better to have that happen without any kind of underlining." [...] He also disclosed that the effect of this reveal will be felt in future episodes as Daenerys and Jon's relationship changes.|$|R
5000|$|On 27 January 1976 {{the ship}} went aground in Augusta Bay, Sicily on {{a peak of}} coral which <b>pushed</b> <b>in</b> areas <b>on</b> {{either side of the}} bow, but did not crack or hole the ship. Three days later, with cargo, personnel, {{helicopter}}s, and fuel off-loaded to assist the effort, the ship was refloated. [...] Later that spring, while still in the Mediterranean Sea, a Marine Corps CH-46 Sea Knight helicopter assigned to the embarked squadron (HMM-162) crashed on its flight deck while attempting to return to the ship after lifting off minutes earlier.|$|R
5000|$|Regney was {{inspired}} to write the lyrics [...] "Said the night wind to the little lamb, 'Do you see what I see?'" [...] and [...] "Pray for peace, people everywhere" [...] after watching babies being <b>pushed</b> <b>in</b> strollers <b>on</b> the sidewalks of New York City. Shayne stated in an interview years later that neither could personally perform the entire song {{at the time they}} wrote it because of the emotions surrounding the Cuban Missile Crisis. [...] "Our little song broke us up. You must realize there was a threat of nuclear war at the time." ...|$|R
50|$|After a {{disrupted}} {{first season}} with Birmingham, Ambrose looked to <b>push</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> his second season, however, just two appearances in the first team followed, before being allowed to leave on loan for Greek Superleague club Apollon Smyrni, managed by Lawrie Sanchez.|$|R
50|$|At 8:55 {{into the}} third period Alexei Tereshchenko grabbed a loose puck in the slot, and <b>pushed</b> it <b>in</b> five-hole <b>on</b> Ward. With under 7 minutes left Ilya Kovalchuk took a wrist shot that beat a heavily trafficked Canadian crease {{to tie the game}} 4-4 for Russia.|$|R
6000|$|... "They {{have begun}} to quarrel among themselves, and perhaps our time will come before morning," [...] Isaac whispered to Nathan as they <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> advance, and young Beman {{appeared}} more willing to listen than when the subject was first broached; but yet he made no reply.|$|R
6000|$|... "We're {{not out of}} {{the woods}} yet, Cato," [...] he said dryly; [...] "nor are they. Keep your eyes and ears open, and attend to me. How long can we keep in the cover of these woods, and still <b>push</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the {{direction}} of the quarters?" ...|$|R
60|$|Master Snip growled {{as if to}} {{say that}} he too {{believed}} they had made a mistake <b>in</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>on</b> any farther, and the sun hid his face behind the hills as a warning for young boys and small dogs to get under cover.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well," [...] {{said the}} major, cheerfully but tentatively, {{to his wife}} when they were alone again, [...] "she seems a nice girl, after all; {{and a good deal}} of pluck and character, by Jove! to <b>push</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> that broken buggy rather than linger or come in a farm cart, eh?" ...|$|R
60|$|Balanites was not uncommon, {{forming a}} low thorny bush, with Aegle marmelos and Feronia elephantum. Having rested the tired elephant, we <b>pushed</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the evening {{to the next}} stage, Baghoda, {{arriving}} there at 3 a.m., {{and after a few}} hours' rest, I walked to the bungalow of Lieutenant Beadle, the surveyor of roads, sixteen miles further.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{it should}} be quite plain {{that you will have}} to keep the troopers from him. It is only a {{question}} of a day or two at the longest before they trail him. They may do it to-night. Esmond will very soon find out that he isn't <b>pushing</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> front of him for the settlements." ...|$|R
5000|$|The remodel {{will include}} 14 beds with robotic arms, 6 private units, and will give control over natural and {{artificial}} light while being energy efficient. This project is being realized through the [...] "Achuchón" [...] campaign, {{which began in}} February 2016. In spanish achuchón means both hug and push, and their campaign slogan is to give an [...] "achuchón" [...] for the new ICU at the hospital, meaning to give both a hug but also a <b>push</b> <b>in</b> the direction <b>on</b> the renovation.|$|R
50|$|The Super Pétrel {{is powered}} by a 73.5 kW (98.6 hp) Rotax 912ULS {{flat-four}} engine mounted <b>in</b> <b>pusher</b> configuration <b>on</b> the central pylon just below the upper wing. It drives a three-blade Airplast propeller, either a fixed pitch model 175 or an electrically controlled, variable pitch model PV 50.|$|R
500|$|One shot {{created by}} Shade VFX {{is when the}} {{audience}} sees Matt Murdock's [...] "vision" [...] – {{the way that he}} [...] "sees" [...] using his other heightened senses. On why this was only used once in the season, DeKnight explained that it had in fact been budgeted to appear several more times, with the effect actually completed at least twice more for the season. It was removed for several reasons, including to avoid taking away the specialty of it, and to maintain the crime drama tone of the series. One instance where it would have been used again was in [...] "Stick", where the audience would have seen how Murdock saw Stick as he threw keys at him, and then when he is older and Stick throws fighting sticks at him and his senses are more refined. In that case, the effect was not finished on time. Another instance was in [...] "The Ones We Leave Behind" [...] when Murdock comes across a Chinese worker and realizes that he has been blinded. The final use of the effect {{was going to be in}} [...] "Daredevil" [...] when the camera <b>pushes</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> Page's reaction Murdock telling her that they can work together. Here, the effect was hiding all of the nuances in her expression, so it was decided that it would be better to remove it.|$|R
60|$|In certain animals {{belonging}} to {{every one of}} the chief groups into which the Metazoa are divisible, the cells of the cell-aggregate which results from the process of yelk-division, and which is termed a morula, diverge from one another in such a manner as to give rise to a central space, around which they dispose themselves as a coat or envelope; and thus the morula becomes a vesicle filled with fluid, the planula. The wall of the planula is next <b>pushed</b> <b>in</b> <b>on</b> one side, or invaginated, whereby it is converted into a double-walled sac with an opening, the blastopore, which leads into the cavity lined by the inner wall. This cavity is the primitive alimentary cavity or archenteron; the inner or invaginated layer is the hypoblast; the outer the epiblast; and the embryo, in this stage, is termed a gastrula. In all the higher animals a layer of cells makes its appearance between the hypoblast and the epiblast, and is termed the mesoblast. In the further course of development the epiblast becomes the ectoderm or epidermic layer of the body; the hypoblast becomes the epithelium of the middle portion of the alimentary canal; and the mesoblast gives rise to all the other tissues, except the central nervous system, which originates from an ingrowth of the epiblast.|$|R
50|$|The all {{composite}} aircraft features a distinctive gull-wing design with pods that floats can attach to. A twin engine variant {{is powered by}} two Jabiru 3300 engines. In both {{the case of the}} single and twin engined versions, the engines are mounted <b>in</b> <b>pusher</b> configuration <b>on</b> a composite arch behind the cockpit.|$|R
50|$|On 23 August 2008, Richardson scored against Tottenham Hotspur in the 56th minute, in a 2-1 win at White Hart Lane. Richardson took a free kick {{that hit}} the post three times at Fulham on 18 October, and later had another free kick {{disallowed}} as Pascal Chimbonda was adjudged to be <b>pushing</b> <b>in</b> the wall. <b>On</b> 25 October 2008, Richardson scored the winning goal in the Tyne-Wear derby, with a free kick. Richardson attracted interest from Bolton Wanderers in the 2009 January transfer window, but manager Ricky Sbragia insisted {{that he was not}} for sale.|$|R
5000|$|Many modern {{fire alarm}} pull {{stations}} are single action and only require {{the user to}} pull down the handle to sound the alarm. Other fire alarm pull stations are dual-action, and as such require the user to perform a second task before pulling down, such as lifting up or <b>pushing</b> <b>in</b> a panel <b>on</b> the station or shattering a glass panel with an attached hammer. Perhaps the most recognizable pull station is the T-bar pull, so named because the handle is shaped like the letter [...] "T". This style is manufactured by many companies.|$|R
5000|$|Islington {{features}} throughout Charlie Higson's post-apocalyptic, {{young adult}} horror series, The Enemy, set {{in and around}} London. For example, in The Dead (2010), Islington is the destination of the group traveling on Greg's bus. Greg tells everyone but his son, Liam: [...] "Get some sleep. We'll <b>push</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> the morning. I'll take you all as far as Islington. After that you're on your own." ...|$|R
60|$|These long {{conferences}} were bitter {{trials to}} {{the patience of}} the captain, who had no respect either for the governor or his island, and was anxious to <b>push</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> quest of provisions and water. As {{soon as he could}} get his inquisitive partners once more on board, he weighed anchor, and made sail for the island of Woahoo, the royal residence of Tamaahmaah.|$|R
5000|$|A {{collection}} {{had been}} arranged {{to make a}} presentation to him, but the Duke asked that instead the money be turned {{to the benefit of}} [...] "those poor fellows who have borne the burden and {{the heat of the day}} <b>in</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>on</b> the works as they have done. I refer to the workmen on the line." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "News to be {{paid with}} hose!" [...] (novelle da calze) were the vague answers with which Tito met the importunities of the crowd, until he had succeeded <b>in</b> <b>pushing</b> <b>on</b> his horse to the spot at {{the meeting of the}} ways where the Gonfaloniere and the Priors were {{awaiting}} him. There he paused, and, bowing low, said-- ...|$|R
60|$|The Norfolk Rangers {{had been}} one of the regiments which had {{remained}} <b>in</b> their quarters <b>on</b> Torres Vedras throughout the winter, and great was the joy with which they received orders to strike their tents and <b>push</b> <b>on</b> <b>in</b> pursuit. The retreat of Massena was masterly. Ney's division covered the rear, and several sharp fights took place which are known in history as the combats of Pombal, Redinha, Cazal Nova, Foz d'Aronce, and Sabugal.|$|R
