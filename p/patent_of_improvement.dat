50|$|Consequently, {{other jurisdictions}} {{such as the}} United Kingdom and New Zealand have held that a {{researcher}} may ignore a patent when conducting experiments.

40|$|The major {{problems}} associated with trade secret law in New Zealand are that it is confused in definition and in jurisdiction. This confusion contributes {{to the failure of}} trade secret law in some instances, particularly to protect information created in the emerging biotechnology and computer software industries. This has contributed to alternative forms of protection, notably through copyright for computer programs. From a review of the current law, categories of trade secrets are identified, including sub-patentable and patentable trade secrets. The jurisdictional dispute may be resolved if it is recognised that trade secrets represent a form of property right. To this end, the legal and economic approaches to property rights are synthesised. This synthesis is then extended to create a legal-economic model of the justifications for, and the problems with, the protection of these rights: the intellectual property rights continuum. From this model, it is concluded that some legal protection of trade secrets is justified, provided that equally harmful effects are not created. In particular, sub-patentable trade secrets may warrant greater protection, and patentable trade secrets may be over-protected. One proposal is to punish industrial espionage, although some harmful effects may result. Utility models and laws that protect trade secrets in general are considered and rejected as solutions. Instead, <b>patents</b> <b>of</b> <b>improvement</b> (PI) are proposed which would protect trade secrets that represent an advance on an existing patent. PI would represent a lower standard of inventiveness that is adopted from American biotechnology patent disputes, and so protect sub-patentable trade secrets. The other, higher threshold from the existing English patent law would remain as the patent standard. If a PI were granted to a patent owner, then s/he could practise price discrimination, but if granted to a rival, then competition could result. Either outcome could protect trade secrets, yet mitigate the harmful effects of legal protection. If these proposals were adopted, more information could be produced as well as utilised. Moreover, the growth of the biotechnology and computer software industries in New Zealand could be furthered...|$|R
50|$|Joseph left Philadelphia in 1790 {{and sailed}} to London, {{with the aim}} <b>of</b> <b>patenting</b> an <b>improvement</b> to the mariner's compass, invented by Benjamin, but {{only to find that}} the {{mechanic}} who had made some the parts had fraudulently patented it as his own. Returning to Ballymacash, Squire Johnson appointed him to be the new schoolmaster, where he met William's mother, Catherine Gowdy. Joseph replaced his father-in-law as land steward and Johnson appointed him clerk of the peace. William grew up at Ballymacash and mastered the skills for employment with the Ordnance Survey of Ireland from 1827 to 1829, when his parents took him to Montreal to join his brothers, the eldest of whom had emigrated there in 1819.|$|R

50|$|Soon after, in 1869, he rejoined Barlow {{and they}} began work on designs for the Tower Subway, only the second tunnel to be driven under the river Thames in central London. Barlow was the {{engineer}} for the tunnel and Greathead {{was in charge of}} the actual drive. The tunnelling shield for driving the Tower Subway, while designed by Greathead, was inspired by Barlow's ideas for a circular tunnelling shield which he had patented in 1864 and 1868. The so-called Barlow-Greathead shield consisted of an iron cylinder 7 ft in diameter fitted with screw jacks which enabled it to be jacked forward. In use, the shield was inched forward as the working face was excavated, while behind it a permanent tunnel lining of cast iron segments was fitted into place, itself an important innovation. Greathead <b>patented</b> many <b>of</b> his <b>improvements</b> including the use of compressed air and forward propulsion by hydraulic jacks, both of which are now standard features of tunnel construction.|$|R
50|$|Osborne Reynolds {{was born}} in Belfast and moved with his parents soon {{afterward}} to Dedham, Essex. His father worked as a school headmaster and clergyman, but was also a very able mathematician with {{a keen interest in}} mechanics. The father took out a number <b>of</b> <b>patents</b> for <b>improvements</b> to agricultural equipment, and the son credits him with being his chief teacher as a boy. Reynolds showed an early aptitude and liking for the study of mechanics. In his late teens, for the year before entering university, he went to work as an apprentice at the workshop of Edward Hayes, a well known shipbuilder in Stony Stratford, where he obtained practical experience in the manufacture and fitting out of coastal steamers (and thus gained an early appreciation of the practical value of understanding fluid dynamics).|$|R
5000|$|From around 1803, {{when the}} London {{instrument}} maker William Bainbridge obtained number <b>of</b> <b>patents</b> for <b>improvements</b> to the English flageolet, instruments were often referred as [...] "improved" [...] or [...] "patent" [...] flageolets with little reference {{to how they}} actually differed from their predecessors. In this period, the instrument had six finger holes and single thumb hole, and had {{as many as six}} keys. Tarasov reports that the English flageolets of the late 18th century had six finger holes and no thumb hole, and later regained the thumb hole seventh finger hole (see above, right). The English flageolet never reached the level of popularity that the [...] "French" [...] flageolet enjoyed in the 19th century, possibly because the latter instrument was louder. Both remained popular until the beginning of the 20th century.|$|R
5000|$|He {{made the}} {{acquaintance}} of fellow Nebraskan, Leon Douglass, {{who at the}} time worked for the Nebraska Phonograph Company. Douglass was an inventor and <b>patented</b> a number <b>of</b> <b>improvements</b> to the phonograph and was a pioneer in the development of color technology for film. After moving to Chicago, Babson first worked at the World's Fair for $1 a day, possibly in Douglass' slot phonograph concession (Douglass had invented a coin-slot attachment for the phonograph, creating the immediate predecessor to the jukebox). He then obtained work from Douglass, who by then had become a manager of the Chicago Central Phonograph Company, which was part of the Thomas Edison-affiliated North American Phonograph Company, distributor for the Edison Phonograph. Babson's starting salary was $15 a week and he was a cashier. [...] For a brief time, at Douglass' direction, he also worked in San Francisco, running a slot phonograph concession and a parlor, which he then sold in 1895, at Douglass' direction, to Peter Bacigalupi, a pioneer of early music recordings, and the business became known as [...] "Edison's Kinetoscope, Phonograph and Graphophone Arcade." ...|$|R

Kent obliged by constructing a shell shaped basket on wheels that the children could sit in. This was richly decorated and meant to be pulled by a goat or small pony. Benjamin Potter Crandall sold baby carriages in the US in the 1830s which {{have been described as}} the [...] "first baby carriages manufactured in the US" [...] His son, Jesse Armour Crandall was issued a number <b>of</b> <b>patents</b> for <b>improvements</b> and additions to the standard models.

50|$|Tigerstedt stubbornly {{continued}} {{to grapple with}} the problems of the early vacuum tubes, which were inefficient, expensive and prone to breaking. His German colleagues told him that the vacuum tubes could not be developed further and that there could be no solution to the problem with the weakness of amplification. Tigerstedt, however, {{continued to}} experiment and eventually succeeded in substantially improving on the design of Lee De Forest, achieving much greater amplification than that of the original valves. Tigerstedt also <b>patented</b> his <b>improvement</b> <b>of</b> the triode vacuum valve, which consisted of improving the amplification by rearranging the electrodes cylindrically in the tube, changing the glass mold to prevent vacuum loss and using steel mirrors inside the tubes to prevent electrostatic interference. He had finally solved the most difficult practical problems of talking movies. It is worth noting that his achievement was purely experimental, as there were no prior experiments or mathematical models that he could have followed.|$|R
