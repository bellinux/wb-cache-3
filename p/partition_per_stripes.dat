40|$|Multiple human {{stressors}} including non-native {{species and}} habitat alterations can interact with complex consequences on native species. Human-modified habitats can change non-native predator functional and aggregative responses with additive impacts on native prey species. I assessed how the non-native predator, striped bass (Morone saxatilis), and habitat alterations (small diversion dam and other altered habitats) interact to influence mortality on native juvenile Chinook salmon (Oncorhynchus tshawytscha) migrating to sea {{on the lower}} Mokelumne River, CA (USA). Relative abundance and diet surveys across natural and human-altered habitats assessed functional and aggregative responses of striped bass. Striped bass showed elevated per capita consumption of juvenile salmon and behavioral aggregation (estimated as catch per unit effort - CPUE) at a small diversion dam site (Woodbridge Irrigation District Dam: per capita consumption= 3. 54 juvenile salmon <b>per</b> <b>striped</b> bass and CPUE= 0. 189) over other altered (0 juvenile salmon <b>per</b> <b>striped</b> bass; CPUE= 0. 0024) and natural habitats (N/A; CPUE= 0. 0003) creating a localized area of heightened predation. At this predation hotspot, experimental predator removals, diet energetic analysis, and before-after impact assessment estimated striped bass consumption {{of the population of}} out-migrating juvenile salmon to be between 10 - 29 %. <b>Striped</b> bass <b>per</b> capita consumption rates among the three approaches were 0. 92 %, 1. 01 - 1. 11 %, and 0. 96 - 1. 11 % respectively. This study highlights how interactions between multiple stressors can exacerbate consequences for native species and are important to examine when predicting ecological impacts from stressors and planning local management strategies...|$|R

However, this paper proves that both algorithms explode exponentially {{when the number of}} <b>partitions</b> <b>per</b> day, n, exceeds a typically small number determined by the GARCH parameters. Worse, when explosion happens, the tree cannot grow beyond a certain maturity date and the usual tradeoff between accuracy and efficiency ceases to exist. Hence the algorithms must be limited to using small n’s, which may have accuracy problems. Numerical data confirm the theoretical results. The problem of designing efficient tree-based GARCH option pricing algorithms therefore remains open...|$|R

The algorithms set the partition sizes dynamically to balance work across the devices. Through simulation, we show that our storageaware policies perform similarly to LANDLORD, a costaware algorithm previously shown to perform well in Web caching environments.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} focus-ground does not {{necessarily}} determine the quantificational structure of focus-sensitive operators.

This means that recursive or overlapping focus-ground partitions are not required in sentences {{with more than one}} focus-sensitive operator. The belief that more than one focus-ground <b>partition</b> <b>per</b> sentence may be available appears to rest in part on the assumption that every pitch accent is correlated with a focus in a focus-ground partition. Since sentences may have more than one pitch accent, that means they contain more than one focus. This assumption, however, is unwarranted. Accenting is used as a structural resource in natural language for a number of different reasons. It is shown below that there is no one-to-one correspondence between accent and focus and between accent and an `operator-associated' element...|$|R

40|$|In optical storage, {{data can}} be {{arranged}} on the disc in a meta-spiral consisting {{of a large number}} of bit-rows with a small track-pitch. Successive revolutions of the meta-spiral are separated by a narrow guard band. For high storage densities, such a system results in severe 2 -D inter-symbol interference. In the multi-track Viterbi algorithm (MVA) of Krishnamoorthi and Weeks, the complex problem of 2 -D bit-detection is broken down into a number of smaller bit-detection problems on sets of adjacent bit-rows called stripes. We improve the bit error rate (bER) performance of such a 2 -D bit-detector via a number of measures such as: 1) weighing of the separate contributions to the branch metrics from each bit-row in a stripe and 2) inclusion of an additional contribution to the branch metrics from a bit-row adjacent to a stripe.
