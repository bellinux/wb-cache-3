2500|$|Six {{months after}} his term of office ended, Ong gave an {{interview}} to Asiaweek magazine, during which he reiterated that he had only been given an incomplete list of the Government's immovable assets halfway through his term. In addition, he claimed {{not to have been}} informed about [...] "some ministerial procedures" [...] as he had learned of the sale of the assets of the Post Office Savings Bank, a statutory board the reserves of which he was supposed to protect, to DBS Bank from the newspapers instead of being informed first. He mentioned: [...] " [...] said that my statements, and his rebuttal in parliament, were <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> They showed the transparency of the system.

5000|$|Ryan Budke of AOL TV {{gave the}} episode a {{negative}} review, saying [...] "Ever wondered what Klaus the goldfish {{would look like}} as a black man? Neither did I, but I had never really been posed that question before. I think if someone asked me that I would have wondered... Well, whether you've had those sick thoughts before or not, you got {{the answer to that}} question during last night's episode of American Dad. I have a feeling that American Dad is hitting it's stride, which is <b>probably</b> not <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing.</b> The show is going ok, but it's nothing spectacular, and far, far short of its potential. It's always going to be the second banana to Family Guy. It's not a bad show by any means, but American Dad will never be as good as Family Guy. On with the show!" [...] Daniel Solomon of Cinema Blend gave the episode a mixed review, saying [...] "This is the only time in the series where I was not angered to the point of cutting myself by Roger’s annoying shtick. In this case he is an alien is used in a purely non-Stewie way, as he fails to realize that wolves are dangerous creatures. In addition, the most ingenious line in the entire series is uttered here. Stan, in response to his wife opening her own business, says: “What kind of businesswoman forgets to make dinner for her husband? That’s bad business. And bad womaning.” If you don’t think misogyny is funny at all, this show is not for you. But I’m sure there’s a poetry slam going on somewhere." [...] The episode was watched by a total of 8.23 million people; this made it the third most watched show on Animation Domination that night, beating King of the Hill but losing to The Simpsons and Family Guy, which had 9.08 million.|$|R

Golly, {{it was so}} good to hear from you. I wanted to write 2 ̆ 6 answer it right away but couldn’t manage. What a madhouse I live in. Per usual I’m at work now. It’s always hard to write {{with a bunch of}} girls talking to you. Everyone right now is pretty quiet. Something must have {{happened}} because {{this is the first time}} since I’ve been here that we’ve been quiet—all of us. It’s <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> darn <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> that you didn’t have to take that check on Monday. Oh, did you get lost on that Cross Country thing? How was it? Where abouts in Pennsylvania did you go? (I’m giving you the benefit of the doubt in assuming that you even got to Pennsylvania.) Well, it’s too bad about the tickets for Saturday night but it’s probably just as well. It was a nice idea anyhow. What’s this song, “This Could Happen To Me?” Do you by any chance mean “It Could Happen To You?” As far as I can remember, which isn’t very far, I’ve never heard your version. Well, Judson, if the life I’ve been leading lately keeps up, you’ll have your wish about me being very dull, uninteresting and homely. It’s really sad. My bags are practically suitcases. Sleep is something which I haven’t had any of. Time certainly flies when you come home. The weekend gets shorter 2 ̆ 6 shorter every time. When you do learn to speak in shorthand teach me. That would be wonderful. We should or at least I should, write down all the things I want to say to you 2 ̆ 6 then read them off. That picture you sent me was absolutely darling. It’s so cute! But—I still want those pictures of you in front of the plane or whatever it is. The pictures we took last weekend haven’t come back yet but when they do, if they’re any <b>good</b> I’ll have <b>a</b> set made and send them to you. Well, honey, please write soon. You’ll be home in two more days. It seems as though someone threw an extra two hundred days in this week. Hope you can read this. Be good 2 ̆ 6 take care of yourself. Lots of love,Dottie[Transcription ends...|$|R

5000|$|Marols or Marollien (also {{known as}} Brusselse Sproek, brusseler, brusseleir, brusselair or brusseleer [...] ) was a dialect spoken in Brussels. Essentially it is a Dutch Brabantian dialect {{incorporating}} many words of French origin {{as well as}} a sprinkling of Spanish dating back to the rule of the Low Countries by the Habsburgs (1519-1713). Its name refers to a district of Brussels called Marollen (Marolles), a neighborhood in the central municipality of Brussels, not far from the Palace of Justice. The district takes its name from the former abbey of the nuns Maria Colentes (Marikollen). It was a working-class neighborhood, though now it has become a fashionable part of the city. Marols is described as [...] "totally indecipherable to the foreigner (which covers everyone not born in the Marolles) which is <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> as it is richly abusive." ...|$|E
5000|$|While the {{correlation}} of gender with SDO scores has been empirically measured and confirmed, the impact of temperament and socialization is less clear. Duckitt has suggested a model of attitude development for SDO, suggesting that unaffectionate socialisation in childhood causes a tough-minded attitude. According to Duckitt's model, people high in tough-minded personality are predisposed to view {{the world as a}} competitive place in which resource competition is zero-sum. A desire to compete, which fits with social dominance orientation, influences in-group and outside-group attitudes. People high in SDO also believe that hierarchies are present in all aspects of society {{and are more likely to}} agree with statements such as [...] "It's <b>probably</b> <b>a</b> <b>good</b> <b>thing</b> that certain groups are at the top and other groups are at the bottom". In turn, SDO predicts stereotyping, discrimination and prejudice.|$|E
