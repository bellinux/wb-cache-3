Then he fluttered away on one foot for a short distance and seemed to be pulling tiny roots and fibers of grass, which he worked into the clay that he had already smeared on his leg. Again he took some clay and plastered it over the fibers, putting on more and more till I could plainly see the enlargement, working away with strange, silent intentness for fully fifteen minutes, while I watched and wondered, scarce believing my eyes. Then he stood <b>perfectly</b> <b>still</b> for a full hour under an overhanging sod, where the eye could with difficulty find him, his only motion meanwhile being an occasional rubbing and smoothing of the clay bandage with his bill, until it hardened enough to suit him, whereupon he fluttered away from the brook and disappeared in the thick woods.|$|E
5|$|McCrane had {{to spend}} hours in makeup {{in order to get}} the right effect and his eyes were colored with {{specially}} made contact lenses. Many of the scenes were physically exerting. The autopsy scene involved McCrane positioning himself through a hole in the table and sitting <b>perfectly</b> <b>still,</b> giving the illusion of a disembodied head. The scene in the bathtub required McCrane to spend several minutes motionless underwater. The shot in which a new Betts emerges from the old one's mouth was created by Toby Lindala. Lindala used shots of McCrane intercut with shots of a puppet with full-functioning mouth and eyes. Laverne Basham and Lindala were later both nominated for an Emmy for Outstanding Makeup in a Series. In addition, the machine that created a slice of Betts' head was designed by Ken Hawryliew.|$|E
5|$|Yoshikawa {{develops}} {{misgivings about}} Asami after {{he is unable}} to reach any of the references on her résumé, such as a music producer she claimed to work for, who is missing. However, Aoyama is so enthralled by her that he pursues her anyway. She lives in an empty apartment, containing a sack and a phone. For four days after the audition, she sits <b>perfectly</b> <b>still</b> next to the phone waiting for it to ring. When it finally does, she answers pretending that she never expected Aoyama to call. After several dates, she agrees to accompany him to a seaside hotel, where a smitten Aoyama intends to propose marriage. At the hotel, Asami reveals burn scars on her body. Before making love, Asami demands that Aoyama pledge his love to her and no one else. A deeply moved Aoyama agrees. In the morning, Asami is nowhere to be found.|$|E

Similarly, the katydids, a group of grasshopper-like insects found worldwide, are nocturnal and use their cryptic coloration to remain unnoticed during the day. They remain <b>perfectly</b> <b>still,</b> often in a position that increases {{the effectiveness of their}} camouflage.|$|E

25|$|Pike {{are found}} in {{sluggish}} streams and shallow, weedy places in lakes, {{as well as in}} cold, clear, rocky waters. They are typical ambush predators; they lie in wait for prey, holding <b>perfectly</b> <b>still</b> for long periods, and then exhibit remarkable acceleration as they strike. In short, they inhabit any water body that contains fish, but suitable places for spawning are essential for their numbers. Because of their cannibalistic nature, young pike need places where they can take shelter between plants so they are not eaten. In both cases, rich submerged vegetation is needed. Pike are seldom found in brackish water, except for the Baltic Sea area. They seem to prefer water with less turbidity, but that is probably related to their dependence on the presence of vegetation and not to their being sight hunters.|$|E
25|$|She and her troupe {{departed}} from Le Havre for America on 15 October 1880, arriving in New York on 27 October. On 8 November, she performed Scribe's Adrienne Lecouvreur at Booth's Theater {{before an audience}} which had paid a top price of $40 for a ticket, an enormous sum at the time. Few in the audience understood French, {{but it was not}} necessary; her gestures and voice captivated the audience, and she received a thunderous ovation. She thanked the audience with her distinctive curtain call; she did not bow, but stood <b>perfectly</b> <b>still,</b> with her hands clasped under her chin, or with her palms on her cheeks, and then suddenly stretched them out to the audience. After her first performance in New York, she made 27 curtain calls. Although she was welcomed by theater-goers, she was entirely ignored by New York high society, who considered her personal life scandalous.|$|E
25|$|While {{both were}} good friends, Rabbi Dovber and Rabbi Aharon {{disagreed}} about the emphasis on, and correct method of, emotional expression in Chassidic prayer. According to Rabbi Dovber, the greatest service a Jew can perform in worship is to totally nullify himself before The Creator. Therefore, maintained Rabbi Dovber, a person's meditation can {{appear to be}} cold and emotionless on the exterior, where the prayer causes the person praying to feel oneself one with The Creator. To that end, Rabbi Dovber prayed with great D'veikus (cleaving), rather than with Hispaylus (excitement), where the one praying gets excited over the Creator but remains, in his own feeling and understanding, a separate entity and existence. Rabbi Dovber prayed while <b>perfectly</b> <b>still,</b> hardly moving. His outward countenance remained completely unaffected. It {{is important to note}} this mode of davening was something personal to him, as he was able to conceal his emotions, rather than something he recommended for everyone. When the Rebbe DovBer noticed that his chassidim (followers) thought that they should be devoid of any emotional appearance, he wrote a public letter stating that this is wrong. His disagreement with Rabbi Aharon was rather that he felt that there must be an understanding of Godliness and a cleaving, in other words that one's emotional feeling be a lasting one, not one that would evaporate after a short time.|$|E

500|$|The {{zoologist}} Martin Stevens and colleagues, in 2006, {{write that}} [...] "almost all early discussions of camouflage {{were of the}} background-matching type", citing Wallace, Poulton, and Beddard, [...] "until the pioneering work of Thayer (1909) and Cott (1940)", which added disruptive coloration. Cott however both makes use of Beddard as an authority (for {{the fact that the}} Hudson's Bay Lemming turns white in winter whereas the Scandinavian Lemming does not, and for his experiments on the effectiveness of prey coloration on predators) and is critical of him for the [...] "extreme and illogical" [...] opinion held by Beddard and other authors that keeping <b>perfectly</b> <b>still</b> is vital to camouflage. Cott pointed out on that subject that a cryptic colour scheme makes an animal harder to track and to recognize, even while it is moving.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway {{presents}} matadors as heroic characters {{dancing in}} a bullring. He considered the bullring as war with precise rules, {{in contrast to}} the messiness of the real war that he, and by extension Jake, experienced. Critic Keneth Kinnamon notes that young Romero is the novel's only honorable character. [...] Hemingway named Romero after Pedro Romero, an 18th-century bullfighter who killed thousands of bulls in the most difficult manner: having the bull impale itself on his sword as he stood <b>perfectly</b> <b>still.</b> [...] Reynolds says Romero, who symbolizes the classically pure matador, is the [...] "one idealized figure in the novel." [...] Josephs says that when Hemingway changed Romero's name from Guerrita and imbued him with the characteristics of the historical Romero, he also changed the scene in which Romero kills a bull to one of recibiendo (receiving the bull) in homage to the historical namesake.|$|E

500|$|Bradman's early {{development}} {{was shaped by}} the high bounce of the ball on matting-over-concrete pitches. He favoured [...] "horizontal-bat" [...] shots (such as the hook, pull and cut) {{to deal with the}} bounce and devised a unique grip on the bat handle that would accommodate these strokes without compromising his ability to defend. Employing a side-on stance at the wicket, Bradman kept <b>perfectly</b> <b>still</b> as the bowler ran in. His backswing had a [...] "crooked" [...] look that troubled his early critics, but he resisted entreaties to change. His backswing kept his hands in close to the body, leaving him perfectly balanced and able to change his stroke mid-swing, if need be. Another telling factor was the decisiveness of Bradman's footwork. He [...] "used the crease" [...] by either coming metres down the wicket to drive, or playing so far back that his feet ended up level with the stumps when playing the cut, hook or pull.|$|E
500|$|During {{promotion}} for Carey's self-titled {{debut album}} (1990), she appeared on The Arsenio Hall Show to perform her first single, [...] "Vision of Love". During the very much talked about performance, singer-songwriter Carole King {{had been watching}} Carey perform, taking interest in her and her material. One year later, during the recording sessions for Carey's second studio album, Emotions (1991), King contacted Carey, asking if she {{would be interested in}} covering [...] "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman", a song she had written alongside Gerry Goffin for Aretha Franklin. Carey declined, feeling uneasy about covering a song one of her musical influences executed so <b>perfectly.</b> <b>Still</b> determined to work with Carey, King flew out to New York City for one day, in hopes of writing and composing a ballad of some sort. Throughout the day, the two songwriters exchanged musical ideas and melodies on the piano until [...] "If It's Over" [...] came into conception. In an interview following the collaboration, King said the following regarding Carey: [...] "I love her voice. She's very expressive. She gives a lot of meaning to what she sings." ...|$|E
500|$|The episode {{contains}} {{a number of}} other cultural references. When Peter and Lois enter their motel room and find a hooker on the bed, Peter warns Lois to stay <b>perfectly</b> <b>still,</b> as the prostitute's vision is based on movement. This is a reference to a scene in the movie Jurassic Park (1993) in which Dr. Grant gives this warning in reference to a Tyrannosaurus Rex. Pinocchio appears in a cutaway gag, in which Gepetto bends over and deliberately sets Pinocchio up to tell a lie in an attempt to emulate anal sex. This was based on a joke MacFarlane's mother had told her friends when he was a child. Lois yells out George Clooney's name when she and Peter are having sex. The 1950s sitcom The Honeymooners is also referenced when a fictional episode of the sitcom is shown in which Ralph Kramden, the show's main character, hits his wife, Alice, something he would only threaten to do on the show. Meg watches an episode of the CBS sitcom Two and a Half Men, which shows three men in a living room, one of whom is cut in half at the waist and screaming in agony, the other two standing over him and screaming in horror. Fictional army soldier Flint of [...] appears briefly after Chris is caught drinking vodka, and educates the children on drinking and informs them that [...] "...knowing is half the battle". Flint's voice was provided by Bill Ratner, the actor who had voiced the character in the G.I. Joe television series. According to Seth Green, who voices Chris, the reason the Family Guy cast members did not voice Flint themselves is because if you have the original actor providing the voice [...] "you take it with a little bit more gravitas".|$|E

500|$|... {{is a form}} of jutsu {{introduced}} during Part II of {{the series}} that is taught from summons who have obtained the title of sage, two of which are the Great Toad Sage and the White Snake Sage. A user can master Senjutsu by combining their chakra with [...] "natures energy", a task that can only be completed by ninja with particularly large chakra reserves who learn to harmonize with nature by remaining <b>perfectly</b> <b>still</b> – anyone else who tries is quickly overwhelmed by this natural energy, as seen when Jugo's Clan rendered mentally unstable with fits of rage. For those who learn under the Great Toad Sage, the overdose of natural energy turns them into giant stone toad statues though this effect can be neutralized with the sage's beating stick. If the user is able to use Senjutsu, they only have {{a certain amount of time}} before the natural energies are expended, as the user will need to move around the battlefield and Senjutsu requires to user to remain still. Workarounds for this shortfall include summoning frog assistants or using shadow clones to help gather the energy. Those who master Senjutsu are able to enter a state called [...] where user adopts the physical features of the animal mentor. Because of the difficulty in maintaining the natural energy, only a few people have been able to properly master Senjutsu; Naruto Uzumaki is stated to be the first Senjutsu user under the tutelage of the Great Toad Sage, Gamamaru, who has achieved this feat. Ninja who are able to use Senjutsu include Jiraiya, Minato Namikaze, and Hashirama Senju; Kabuto Yakushi are also able to use Senjutsu, seemingly without the aid of an animal mentor. Because the chakra utilized is from the natural world, Senjutsu is an effective weapon against the Ten-Tails and Yin-Yang Style users.|$|E
500|$|Additionally, {{aside from}} the three men, Carey worked with Carole King, a female singer-songwriter who had been {{predominantly}} popular in the 1970s. However, unlike with C+C Music Factory, King approached Carey, hoping {{to work with her}} after hearing her perform live on The Arsenio Hall Show. During a conversation with Carey, King suggested that she cover [...] "(You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman," [...] a song she had written with Gerry Goffin for Aretha Franklin. After giving it some thought, Carey declined the offer, feeling uncomfortable about recording a song she felt one of her musical influences performed so <b>perfectly.</b> <b>Still</b> determined on working with Carey, King flew to New York for one day, to try to create a ballad of some sort. The two ladies sat together by a piano {{over the course of the}} day, and by nightfall, had written and arranged a song titled [...] "If It's Over." [...] After working with Carey, King said in an interview [...] "I love her voice. She's very expressive. She gives a lot of meaning to what she sings." [...] After recording [...] "If It's Over," [...] Carey expressed the musical connection she shared with Afanasieff, as well as the creative format in which she wrote and produced her music when with him, or working with C+C Music Factory. When working with Afanasieff, the duo would sit by a piano, and lead each other vocally and musically, until they would reach the right note and arrangement. During an interview in 1992, Afanasieff described how Carey would stand next to him, and begin singing different notes and tunes she was thinking of, while he would follow her with the piano. In doing so, he would help lead her to the right note and vice versa. Carey described their working relationship as [...] "very unique," [...] and felt it to be very similar to the form in which she had worked with Margulies. While similar, Carey's creative process with Cole and Clivillés proved different; they would bring her several different tapes and tunes, of which she would choose from. Afterwards, they would work on building the already created melody, and have Carey add and build onto it, as well as writing the lyrics and key.|$|E
