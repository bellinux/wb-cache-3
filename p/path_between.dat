5|$|In graph algorithms, {{the widest}} path {{problem is the}} problem of finding a <b>path</b> <b>between</b> two {{designated}} vertices in a weighted graph, maximizing the weight of the minimum-weight edge in the path. The widest path problem is also known as the bottleneck shortest path problem or the maximum capacity path problem. It is possible to adapt most shortest path algorithms to compute widest paths, by modifying them to use the bottleneck distance instead of path length. However, in many cases even faster algorithms are possible.|$|E

40|$|In this thesis, we {{emphasized}} the need to use multiple node-disjoint <b>paths</b> <b>between</b> a given source and destination. The use of node-disjoint paths not only allows different paths to share the trafﬁc, but also provides fault-tolerance to some extent.

5|$|The oldest graves are to {{the north}} of the church, which is unusual: ordinarily the {{southern}} part of the churchyard would be used first for burials, with the northern part remaining unconsecrated unless and until extra space for graves was required. The <b>path</b> <b>between</b> the road and the church has sunken, which may partly be explained by the medieval custom of burying the dead on top of each other. One author has suggested that the mound alongside the path might indicate that the church is located in the site of a Bronze Age settlement.|$|E

Awarded with the {{adulation}} of the people, he also garners the enmity of politicians in Rome, including Pompey the Great (Kenneth Cranham). In Rome, Pompey must balance honor and politics as he is urged to betray his former friend. Meanwhile, Caesar's niece Atia of the Julii (Polly Walker) tries to steer her family on the dangerous <b>path</b> <b>between</b> the growing divisions of power.

5|$|Having first {{inhabited}} Pennsylvania between 16,000 and 10,000 BCE, nomadic Native Americans {{reached the}} {{area near the}} mouth of Fishing Creek by 8000 BCE. By 3000 to 2000 BCE, some of them were going into the Fishing Creek valley during the winter to hunt deer and bears and returning to the Susquehanna River in the summer, creating trade routes. There was no permanent habitation until 1000 BCE when some Native American villages were built at the mouth of Fishing Creek. The Native Americans who settled in this area included the Shawnee and Susquehannock Indians. A Native American path ran along the creek from Bloomsburg to Orangeville before turning away in the direction of Tunkhannock Creek. Since at least 1769, there has also been a <b>path</b> <b>between</b> the mouths of Huntington and Green Creeks.|$|E
5|$|The path {{originated}} as a {{route for}} the Coastguard to walk from lighthouse to lighthouse patrolling for smugglers. They {{needed to be}} able to look down into every bay and cove: as a result, the path closely hugs the coast providing excellent views but rarely the most direct <b>path</b> <b>between</b> two points. The South West Coast Path is no longer used by the Coastguard but it has been transformed from a practical defence system into a resource for recreational walkers. The path is covered by England's right-of-way laws, as amended by the Countryside and Rights of Way Act 2000, which keep historic footpaths open to the public even when they pass through private property. Sections of the path are maintained by the National Trust, which owns parts of the coast.|$|E

Because Hillier-Brook had announced he would leave Architects on 16 April 2012 after his final performance with the band at Groezrock Festival, Josh Middleton of Sylosis joined the band as touring guitarist. In late April, Architects supported The Devil Wears Prada and Whitechapel on a six-day tour of South America.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} a general form of routing, called limited multi-path routing, on extended generalized fat-trees where {{the number of}} <b>paths</b> <b>between</b> each pair of processing nodes is a parameter. Existing single-path routing and multi-path routing, where all available <b>paths</b> <b>between</b> a pair of processing nodes {{can be used for}} the traffic, are special cases of limited multi-path routing. We propose path calculation heuristics, including shift- 1, disjoint, and random for limited multi-path routing on extended generalized fat-trees. All of these heuristics are based on existing single-path routing schemes, work for limited multi-path routing with any given limit of <b>paths</b> <b>between</b> processing nodes, gracefully increase routing performance as the limit increases, and reach optimal when all <b>paths</b> <b>between</b> processing nodes are allowed. Extensive flow-level and flit-level simulation experiments are carried out to study the performance. The results show that the disjoint heuristic significantly out-performs the other methods. ...|$|R

Hence, we restrict ourselves to a path size of five). Therefore, in Algorithm  1 the evidence must be specialized for each pair of nodes; given a and b, the set A (a,b) must be constructed and the relevant assertions are then collected into E.|$|R
5|$|US Highway 25A (US25A) was an {{alternate}} route near Port Huron {{that provided a}} connection to the Blue Water Bridge to Canada. The highway split from its parent north of Port Huron and followed 24th Avenue south to connect to M-51 (Pine Grove Avenue) while US25 followed Lakeshore Road and Gratiot Avenue into Port Huron. The parent highway crossed under the approaches to the Blue Water Bridge, and the alternate route, along with M-51, provided a signed <b>path</b> <b>between</b> US25 and the bridge.

5|$|By this time, Oka's {{troops had}} moved into {{position}} to completely cut off the Marines on Hill 84 from the coast. Therefore, Monssen—coordinated by Puller—began to blast a <b>path</b> <b>between</b> the ridge and the beach. After about 30 minutes of firing by the destroyer, the way was clear for the Marines to escape to the beach. Despite taking some casualties from their own artillery fire, most of the Marines {{made it to the}} beach near Point Cruz by 16:30. Oka's troops put heavy fire on the Marines at the beach in effort to keep them from successfully evacuating, and the U.S. Coast Guard crews manning the U.S. landing craft responded with their own heavy fire to cover the Marines' withdrawal. Under fire, the Marines boarded the landing craft and successfully returned to the Lunga perimeter, ending the action. U.S. Coast Guard Signalman First Class Douglas Albert Munro—Officer-in-Charge of the group of Higgins boats—was killed while providing covering fire from his landing craft for the Marines as they evacuated the beach and was posthumously awarded the Medal of Honor for the action, to date the only Coast Guardsman to receive the decoration.|$|E

5|$|The path {{continues}} north {{beside the}} Torridge Estuary, in places following {{the route of}} the Bideford, Westward Ho! and Appledore Railway, past Northam to Appledore and around the promontory past the Shell middens and a submerged forest, that dates from the Mesolithic period, off the pebble ridge to Westward Ho! (this is the only placename in the UK which includes an exclamation mark). The path then follows the coast around Clovelly Bay where several small villages including Abbotsham lie inland, because of the cliffs. The path passes the site of the Iron Age Hill fort at Peppercombe Castle and the village of Bucks Mills. Clovelly itself is a historic village with a small natural harbour. The path continues past the site of the Iron Age Hill fort at Windbury Head to Hartland Point and Hartland Quay. Hartland Point features a lighthouse and radar tower, and marks the western limit (on the English side) of the Bristol Channel with the Atlantic Ocean to the west.
