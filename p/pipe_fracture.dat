40|$|Abstract. To {{achieve a}} {{rational}} maintenance program for aged Light Water Reactor components, {{it is important}} to establish and to improve the flaw evaluation criteria. The current flaw evaluation criteria such as ASME Boiler and Pressure Vessel Code Section XI are focused on Class 1 piping which usually shows relatively higher toughness. On the other hand, flaw evaluation criteria suitable for Class 2, 3 piping with moderate-toughness are also required because some Class 2, 3 piping systems are as important to plant safety analysis as Class 1 piping. In this study, both analytical and experimental studies were conducted to provide the evaluation method of fracture loads for acceptance criteria for Class 2, 3 piping. <b>Pipe</b> <b>fracture</b> tests by four-point bending were conducted on circumferentially cracked carbon steel pipes with moderate-toughness. The Net-Section Collapse criterion overpredicted experimental maximum loads for through-wall-cracked pipes, which suggested the necessity of Z-factor. Three-dimensional finite element analysis and simplified analysis based on the reference stress method were conducted to complement the limited <b>pipe</b> <b>fracture</b> tests. It was ascertained that the reference stress method always gave moderately conservative fracture loads compared with the finite element analysis and <b>pipe</b> <b>fracture</b> tests as well. Z-factor for Class 2, 3 piping was then derived and formulated using the reference stress method. Z for Class 2, 3 piping was affected by radius-to-thickness ratio, and was higher than Z for Class 1 piping in the present codes...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the final}} report of the International Piping Integrity Research Group (IPIRG) Program. The IPIRG Program was an {{international}} group program managed by the U. S. Nuclear Regulatory Commission and funded by a consortium of organizations from nine nations: Canada, France, Italy, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland, Taiwan, the United Kingdom, and the United States. The program objective was to develop data needed to verify engineering methods for assessing the integrity of circumferentially-cracked nuclear power plant piping. The primary focus was an experimental task that investigated the behavior of circumferentially flawed piping systems subjected to high-rate loadings typical of seismic events. To accomplish these objectives a pipe system fabricated as an expansion loop with over 30 meters of 16 -inch diameter pipe and five long radius elbows was constructed. Five dynamic, cyclic, flawed piping experiments were conducted using this facility. This report: (1) provides background information on leak-before-break and flaw evaluation procedures for piping, (2) summarizes technical results of the program, (3) gives a relatively detailed assessment of {{the results from the}} <b>pipe</b> <b>fracture</b> experiments and complementary analyses, and (4) summarizes advances in the state-of-the-art of <b>pipe</b> <b>fracture</b> technology resulting from the IPIRG program...|$|E

40|$|AbstractThis paper reports ductile {{fracture}} simulation of full-scale circumferentially cracked pipes using finite element (FE) damage analysis. In the structural integrity, without experimental investigations or with few ones, {{it is not}} an easy task to properly evaluate the crack initiation and crack propagation of large-scale components with a crack-like defect. Unfortunately, from an economic perspective, performing experiments of large-scale components would be consequently unfavorable. For these reasons, {{ductile fracture}} simulation using FE damage analysis to predict crack behavior is one efficient way to replace the test procedures. In order to simulate ductile tearing of large-scale cracked pipes, element-size-dependent critical damage model based on the stress-modified fracture strain model is proposed. To evaluate fracture behavior of full-scale cracked pipes, tensile and C(T) specimens are calibrated by FE analysis technique.

Analytical solutions were developed for cracks with constant-depth, parabolic, and elliptical shapes. For all three crack shapes, separate equations were developed when the entire crack is subjected to tension and when part of the crack is subjected to compression. For part of the crack subjected to compression, the proposed equations can handle both tight (with crack-closure) and blunt (without crack-closure) cracks. Currently, of the three crack shapes examined in this paper, previous analytical solutions exist only for the constant-depth crack. Hence, they should be useful for <b>pipe</b> <b>fracture</b> analysis involving other crack shapes, such as the elliptical and parabolic cracks.

The pressure profile in front of the crack tip, which is the main source of the crack driving source, is computed by using nonlinear wave equation.

The simulation utilizes a high order optimized prefactored compact-finite volume method for space discretization, and low dispersion and dissipation Runge-Kutta for time discretization. As the <b>pipe</b> <b>fractures</b> the rapid depressurization take place inside the pipe and the propagation of the crack induce waves which strongly influence the nature of the outflow dynamics.
