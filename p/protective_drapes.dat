30|$|The {{limitations}} of this survey include the relatively low response rate, with only 946 completed questionnaires (4.3 Â %). This may partly {{reflect the fact that}} not all radiologists performing US examinations (in 2015, just under half of the full ESR Radiologist Members chose US as one of their special interests), or in some departments, only the US lead radiologist may have completed the survey. There was unequal representation among European countries, with a larger number of responses from Italy, the UK, Spain and France. The vast majority of responses came from hospital settings, and a smaller number were received from private centres, which may not fully represent the second group. This survey focussed on infection prevention issues relating to US procedures. To keep the questionnaire as short as possible, the more wide-ranging basic infection prevention and control precautions such as hand washing, the use of gloves and <b>protective</b> <b>drapes,</b> and the cleaning of US machines (apart from transducers) and other surfaces were not explored. No question was included about the use of US gel warmers. Finally, we did not include options to allow for differences in the complexity of interventional procedures.|$|E
5000|$|The man on {{the right}} wears combat {{equipment}} consistent with a U.S. Army Soldier, and specifically, a Type M69 body-armor vest, which was the primary armor vest used mainly by U.S. Army personnel in Vietnam, from about 1967 on. His M69 armor vest is unsecured, and worn fully open at the front, which was a typical fashion of troops in Vietnam, as a measure in which to promote ventilation (in spite of reducing the vest's overall <b>protective</b> levels). <b>Draped</b> around {{the collar of his}} M69 vest and hanging on his chest front, this Soldier carries a GI towel, which served to absorb sweat and cushioned heavy loads, and was a common practice of many Soldiers in Vietnam. In his left hand he carries an M16A1 rifle, the main battle rifle for both Soldiers and Marines from about 1967 on. His uniform consists of the Tropical Combat Uniform (jacket and trousers) and [...] "jungle" [...] boots. As was typically done by U.S. combat personnel fighting in the oppressive tropical environment of Vietnam, the uniform jacket's sleeves are rolled up. In his right hand, this Soldier holds an M1 steel helmet covered with a camouflage cover, that is secured over the helmet with an elastic headband (which itself retains a small bottle of GI insect repellent on the right side). He also wears an M-1956 GI pistol belt over the waist of his uniform jacket, and it retains a GI 1-quart canteen and M-1956 canteen cover, situated at the left rear hip. Lastly, on a GI neck-chain set, he wears a pair of GI Identification Tags (i.e. [...] "dog tags"), which are visible on his bare chest, seen through the open front of his uniform jacket and armor vest.|$|R
