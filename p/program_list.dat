40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a method of}} indexing cases for case-based evaluation assistant systems of novice <b>programs.</b> <b>Program</b> <b>lists</b> in evaluation cases should be represented in intact target programming language, because special forms of <b>program</b> <b>lists</b> put heavy burdens on teachers who are users of the systems. However, intact forms of <b>program</b> <b>lists</b> cannot cover that many variations. Therefore, indexes to cases should be constructed by using information of generalized <b>program</b> <b>lists</b> in order to expand the variations of <b>program</b> <b>lists</b> covered by one case. We propose a three level index of evaluation cases for novice programs written in a simple assembly language.
