5|$|Nuttin {{analyzed}} {{the data to}} see if there was a national-letter effect, but failed to find one. Norwegians did not favor the letter N (for Norge) more than <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> countries did, neither did the Hungarians favor the letter M (for Magyarország). This led Nuttin to conclude that individual ownership has affective consequences that are not observed for collective ownership.|$|E

He had lung cancer and died at his home; a massive candlelight vigil took place in the vicinity of it. Vice president Julio Cobos, the acting president at the time, arranged three days of national mourning and a state funeral at the Palace of the Argentine National Congress. Alfonsín was seen by 40,000 people and the senior politicians of the country; <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> countries also voiced their respect for him.

5|$|Separatist {{movements}} {{also exist}} {{in two other}} former princely states located in Northeast India—Tripura and Manipur. These separatist movements are generally treated by scholars as {{being part of the}} broader problem of insurgencies in North-east India, rather being a result of specific problems in integrating the princely states into India, as the Kashmir problem is and, in particular, to reflect the failure of the Government of India to adequately address the aspirations of tribal groups in the Northeast, or to tackle the tensions arising from the immigration of <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> parts of India to the north-eastern areas.|$|E

Up to 50,000 eastern and central European migrant workers left Ireland in response to the Irish financial crisis.|$|E
5|$|Scarification had {{its origins}} in Nri mythology. Nri, the son of Eri who {{established}} the town of Nri, {{was said to have}} pleaded to Chukwu (the Great God) because of hunger. Chukwu then ordered him to cut off his first son's and daughter's heads and plant them, creating a 'blood bond' between the Igbo and the earth deity, Ana. Before doing so, Nri was ordered to mark ichi onto their two foreheads. Coco yam, a crop managed by females, sprang from his daughter's head, and yam, the Igbo peoples' staple crop, sprung from his son's head; Chukwu had taught Nri plant domestication. From this, the eze Nri's first son and daughter were required to undergo scarification's seven days after birth, with the eze Nri's daughter being the only female to receive ichi. Nri, the son of Eri, also gained knowledge of the yam medicine (ogwu ji). <b>People</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> Igbo communities made pilgrimages to Nri in order to receive this knowledge received in exchange for annual tributes.|$|E
5|$|The {{governor}} of Louisiana, Bernardo de Gálvez, was named Field Marshal of the Spanish colonial army in North America. In 1779, Galvez and his troops, composed of Puerto Ricans and <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> Spanish colonies, distracted the British from the revolution by capturing Pensacola, {{the capital of}} the British colony of West Florida and the cities of Baton Rouge, St. Louis and Mobile. The Puerto Rican troops, under the leadership of Brigadier General Ramón de Castro, helped defeat the British and Indian army of 2,500 soldiers and British warships in Pensacola. Galvez and his multinational army also provided the Continental Army with guns, cloth, gunpowder and medicine shipped from Cuba up the Mississippi River. General Ramón de Castro, who was Galvez's Aide-de-camp in the Mobile and Pensacola campaigns, became the appointed {{governor of}} Puerto Rico in 1795.|$|E

5|$|The koala is {{featured}} in the Dreamtime stories and mythology of indigenous Australians. The Tharawal people believed that the animal helped row the boat that {{brought them to the}} continent. Another myth tells of how a tribe killed a koala and used its long intestines to create a bridge for <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> parts of the world. This narrative highlights the koala's status as a game animal and the length of its intestines. Several stories tell of how the koala lost its tail. In one, a kangaroo cuts it off to punish the koala for being lazy and greedy. Tribes in both Queensland and Victoria regarded the koala as a wise animal and sought its advice. Bidjara-speaking people credited the koala for turning barren lands into lush forests. The animal is also depicted in rock carvings, though not as much as some other species.|$|E
5|$|The {{principal}} motivation {{or driving}} force behind the re-establishment of religious houses in the kingdom of the English, living in strict accordance with the Rule of Saint Benedict, was a desire to restore to their former glory some of the ancient houses known from the pages of Bede's Ecclesiastical History of the English <b>People,</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> literary works, from historical traditions of the later eighth and ninth centuries, or indeed from the physical remains of buildings... Modern historians will recognise how much was owed to the monastic reform movements on the continent, and will find extra dimensions, such as a wish to extend royal influence into areas where a king of the West Saxons might not expect his writ to run, or a more general wish to revive a sense of 'Englishness', through raising awareness of the tradition of the past.|$|E
5|$|In 683, Emperor Gaozong died. He was {{succeeded by}} Emperor Zhongzong, his eldest {{surviving}} son by Wu. Zhongzong tried to appoint his wife's father as chancellor: after only six {{weeks on the}} throne, he was deposed by Empress Wu in favor of his younger brother, 12-year-old Emperor Ruizong. This provoked a group of Tang princes to rebel in 684; Wu's armies suppressed them within two months. She proclaimed the Tianshou era of Wu Zhou on October 16, 690, and three days later demoted Emperor Ruizong to crown prince. He was also forced {{to give up his}} father's surname Li in favor of the empress's Wu. She then ruled as China's only empress. A palace coup on February 20, 705, forced her to yield her position on February 22. The next day, her son Zhongzong was restored to power; the Tang was formally restored on March 3. She died soon after. To legitimize her rule, she circulated a document known as the Great Cloud Sutra, which predicted that a reincarnation of the Maitreya Buddha would be a female monarch who would dispel illness, worry, and disaster from the world. She even introduced numerous revised written characters to the written language, which reverted to the originals after her death. Arguably {{the most important part of}} her legacy was diminishing the power of the northwest aristocracy, allowing <b>people</b> <b>from</b> <b>other</b> clans and regions of China to become more represented in Chinese politics and government.|$|E
