Results indicate baseline swashplateless rotor helicopter bandwidth values are in the range 2. 5 - 5. 0 rad/s, and with phase delay values under 120 milliseconds, the helicopter model displays Level 1 handling qualities for Target Acquisition and Tracking Mission Task Elements as defined by the ADS- 33 aeronautical design standard. In general, longer trailing-edge flaps improve the handling qualities, but flap placement does not have a significant impact. Pitch bandwidth, specifically, is found to increase substantially by increasing the <b>pitch</b> <b>index</b> and reducing torsional stiffness. However, analysis provides evidence of strong blade aeroelastic flap-torsion instabilities occurring {{as a consequence of the}} reduced torsional blade stiffness. In particular, <b>pitch</b> <b>index</b> is found to be a critical parameter which can easily excite severe blade instabilities if torsional stiffness is low enough. Potential adverse effects on the stability should be studied in more detail...|$|E

40|$|A {{comprehensive}} aeroelastic {{analytical model}} of helicopter rotors with trailingedge flaps for primary and vibration controls has been developed. The derivation of system equations {{is based on}} Hamilton principles, and implemented with finite element method in space and time. The blade element consists of fifteen degrees of freedom representing blade flap, lag, torsional, and axial deformations. Three aerodynamic models of flapped airfoils were implemented in the present analysis, the unsteady Hariharan- Leishman model for trailing-edge flaps without aerodynamic balance, a quasi-steady Theodorsen theory for an aerodynamic balanced trailing-edge flap, and table lookup based on wind tunnel test data. The trailing-edge flap deflections may be modeled as a degree of freedom so that the actuator dynamics can be captured properly. The coupled trim procedures for swashplateless rotor are solved in either wind tunnel trim or free flight condition. A multicyclic controller is also implemented to calculate the flap control inputs for minimization of vibratory rotor hub loads. The coupled blade equations of motion are linearized by using small perturbations about a steady trimmed solution. The aeroelastic stability characteristics of trailing-edge flap rotors is then determined from an eigenanalysis of the homogeneous equations using Floquet method. The correlation studies of a typical bearingless rotor and an ultralight teetering rotor are respectively based on wind tunnel test data and simulations of another comprehensive analysis (CAMRAD II). Overall, good correlations are obtained. Parametric study identifies {{that the effect of}} actuator dynamics cannot be neglected, especially for a torsionally soft smart actuator system. Aeroelastic stability characteristics of a trailing-edge flap rotor system are shown to be sensitive to flap aerodynamic and mass balances. Key parameters of trailing-edge flap system for primary rotor control are identified as blade <b>pitch</b> <b>index</b> angle, torsional frequency, flap location, flap length, and overhang length. The swashplateless rotor is shown to achieve better rotor performance and overall more stable than the conventional configuration. Simulations of flaps performing both primary control and active vibration control are carried out, with the conclusion that trailing-edge flaps are capable of trimming the rotor and simultaneously minimizing vibratory rotor hub loads...|$|E
40|$|UV {{moulding}} enables for {{the generation}} of thin polymeric films carrying micro-optic elements on top of arbitrary substrates like glass, Silicon, III/V-semiconductors by a process which is performed in a modified contact mask aligner. The elements are characterized by high precision and stability, temperature stable and precise <b>pitch,</b> <b>index</b> homogeneity, uniformity across the wafer, and they fulfill additional requirements for a practical application (AR-coating, separation in a dicing saw). The basic UV-reaction moulding technology was described already, e. g. in / 1 /. This technology has now been improved and completed. This concerns first of all {{the investigation of the}} influence of the technology on the precision of replicated refractive optical surfaces. The basic technology is a combination of lithography, reflow and UV-moulding. In contrast to variable dose writing/exposure or etching, where the absolute precision depends on some dissolution/ etching rate (and is therefore propo rtional to the total height of the element), the reflow process used here results in a "minimal" surface which is primarily independent of the total sag. Additional factors influencing the accuracy of the structures (e. g. reaching the equilibrium state in the reflow process, control of the shrinkage) have been investigated. In the UV-moulding process, the effective shrinking has been reduced down to 1 to 2 %. UV-moulded lenses, e. g., show a high precision of the optical surface as well as low wavefront aberrations. Best fit differences to an ideal spherical or cylindrical surface are 10 nm rms/ 70 nm p. v. for Ø 200 µm, sag 10 µm, N. A. = 0. 1 and about 50 nm rms/ 300 nm p. v. for Ø 700, sag 75 µm, N. A. = 0. 2. The improved accuracy of the technology allows for a number of new applications, first of all collimation lens arrays for fiber ribbons. They must have sags of 40 to 60 µm and a pitch accuracy of < 0. 5 µm. That was realized by UV-moulding on borofloat glass. Other applications will be de scribed. The combination of UV-Lithography (mask process) with UV-moulding (using a replication tool) can be applied to integrate waveguides with path converting prisms or other micro-optic elements. Additionally, the binary process can be added to improve the characteristics of UV-moulded structures., e. g. one can define areas which are free of polymer (for electrical bonding etc.). The technology was extended to a double-sided replication in order to generate micro-optical systems on a wafer scale. In contrast to mounted wafer stacks, these systems can be easily separated into chips by a dicing saw. Furthermore, the substrate may show some additional functionality, e. g. it could be a cylindrical gradient index lens fabricated by ion exchange in glass, or can carry pinhole structures. One promising field of application of those micro-optical subsystems is laser diode collimation and beam forming...|$|E

At Apple Computer, statistical prosodic modeling exploits the Vic-toria corpus, recently created to broadly support ongoing speech synthesis research and development. This corpus is composed of five constituent parts, each designed to cover a specific aspect of speech synthesis: polyphones, prosodic contexts, reiterant speech, function word sequences, and continuous speech. This paper focuses {{on the use of}} the Victoria corpus in the statistical estima-tion of duration and pitch models for Apple’s next-generation text-to-speech system in Macintosh OS X. Duration modeling relies primarily on the subcorpus of prosodic contexts, which is instrumental to uncover empirical evidence in favor of a piece-wise linear transformation in the well-known sums-of-products approach. Pitch modeling relies primarily on the subcorpus of reiterant speech, which makes possible the optimization of superpositional pitch models with more accurate underlying smooth contours.

This tractor has small dimensions, necessary to operate in that environment, and its central articulation has two rotational degrees-offreedom. The described features are surely strong design points but could be critical for vehicle’s stability, as affecting the supporting base’s dimensions and shape. Therefore, the tractor was equipped with a new automatic safety system: a self-locking articulation activated by contact sensors on the wheels. This device makes the vehicle partially-rigid in case of lateral unbalancing, so that rollover can happen only by overcoming the whole vehicle mass. A mathematical description of vehicle-ground interactions was implemented to deeply inquiry the tractor behaviour in different configurations (straight, angled) at increasing values of ground slope; roll and <b>pitch</b> stability <b>indexes</b> were then computed and used for comparisons with conventional tractors.

Based on this feature, this paper studies the effects of pumping light's incidence angle on emission properties of the dye doped cholesteric liquid crystal tunable laser. First, we investigated the relationship among the concentration of chiral reagent, the incidence angle of the pumping light, and the pitch of liquid-crystal display (LCD); then we made a tunable-wavelength laser and pumped the prepared sample with 532 nm laser outputted from the Nd: YAG multi-frequency pulse laser. As the incident angle of the pumping light shifts between 20 90, the tuning range of the wavelength emitted by the laser reaches 10. 73 nm, ranging between 647. 38 nm and 658. 11 nm...|$|R
40|$|This Letter {{reports on}} an etched fiber Bragg grating (eFBG) sensor coated with reduced {{graphene}} oxide (RGO) having enhanced sensitivity for physical parameters such as strain and temperature. The synergetic {{effect of the}} changes in grating <b>pitch</b> and refractive <b>index</b> of RGO with change in temperature or strain enhances the shift in Bragg wavelength (lambda(B)). The RGO-coated eFBG sensors exhibit a strain sensitivity of 5. 5 pm/mu epsilon (similar to 5 times that of bare fiber Bragg gratings) and temperature sensitivity of 33 pm/degrees C (similar to 3 times that of bare fiber Bragg gratings). The resolutions of similar to 1 mu epsilon and similar to 0. 3 degrees C have been obtained for strain and temperature respectively, using RGO-coated eFBG sensors.
