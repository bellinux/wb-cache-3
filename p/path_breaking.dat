By means of their <b>path</b> <b>breaking</b> field experiment, Marianne Bertrand and Sendhil Mullainathan, showed that applications from job candidates with white-sounding names got 50 percent more callbacks for interviews than those with African-American-sounding names in the United States at the start of this millennium. A 2009 study by Devah Pager, Bruce Western, and Bart Bonikowski found that black applicants to low-wage jobs were half as likely as identically qualified white applicants to receive callbacks or job offers. More recently, Stijn Baert, Bart Cockx, Niels Gheyle and Cora Vandamme replicated and extended their field experiment in Belgium, Europe. They found that racial {{discrimination in}} the labour market is heterogeneous by the labour market tightness in the occupation: compared to natives, candidates with a foreign-sounding name are equally often invited to a job interview in Belgium if they apply for occupations for which vacancies are difficult to fill, but they have to send twice as many applications for occupations for which labor market tightness is low.|$|E

40|$|Mobile ad hoc {{networks}} are prone by nature to <b>path</b> <b>breaks</b> and reconnections. Routing protocols such as OLSR that provide topology information {{with a minimum}} delay to the quick reconfiguration of <b>path</b> <b>breaks</b> are desired. Applications and protocols {{should be able to}} adapt to the dynamics of these networks. However, this is not true for most applications and protocols. For example, a video streaming server does not become aware of the <b>path</b> <b>break</b> because it does not interact with lower layers that inform about this event. As a result, important resources such as battery and bandwidth are not used efficiently, and TCP connection failures happen frequently. In this paper, we present a proxy based solution to detect <b>path</b> <b>breaks</b> and reconnections using the proactive OLSR protocol for ongoing streaming sessions and we do corrective actions at the application layer to lead a more efficient usage of the bandwidth during disconnections...|$|R

2500|$|Fred Hoyle {{authored}} {{the first}} two research papers ever published on the synthesis of the chemical elements heavier than helium by nuclear reactions in stars. The first of these [...] in 1946 showed that the cores of stars will evolve to temperatures of billions of degrees, much hotter than temperatures considered for thermonuclear origin of stellar power in main sequence stars. Hoyle showed that at such high temperatures the element iron can become much more abundant than other heavy elements owing to thermal equilibrium among nuclear particles, explaining the high natural abundance of iron. This idea would later be called the e Process. [...] Hoyle's second foundational nucleosynthesis publication showed that the elements between carbon and iron cannot be synthesized by such equilibrium processes. Hoyle attributed those elements to specific nuclear fusion reactions between abundant constituents in concentric shells of evolved massive, pre-supernova stars. This startlingly modern picture is the accepted paradigm today for the supernova nucleosynthesis of these primary elements. [...] In the mid 1950s, Hoyle became {{the leader of a}} group of very talented experimental and theoretical physicists who met in Cambridge: [...] William Alfred Fowler, Margaret Burbidge, and Geoffrey Burbidge. [...] This group systematized basic ideas of how all the chemical elements in our universe were created, with this now being a field called nucleosynthesis. [...] Famously, in 1957, this group produced the B2FH paper (known for the initials of the four authors) in which the field of nucleosynthesis was organized into complementary nuclear processes. They also added much new material on the synthesis of heavy elements by neutron-capture reactions, the so-called s process and the r process. So influential did the B2FH paper become that {{for the remainder of the}} twentieth century it became the default citation of almost all researchers wishing to cite an accepted origin for nucleosynthesis theory, and as a result the <b>path</b> <b>breaking</b> Hoyle 1954 paper fell into obscurity. Historical research in the 21st century [...] has brought Hoyle's 1954 paper back to scientific prominence. Those historical arguments were first presented to a gathering of nucleosynthesis experts attending a 2007 conference at Caltech organized after the deaths of both Fowler and Hoyle to celebrate the 50th anniversary of the publication of B2FH. Ironically the B2FH paper did not review Hoyle's 1954 supernova-shells attribution of the origin of elements between silicon and iron despite Hoyle's co authorship of B2FH. Based on his many personal discussions with Hoyle [...] Donald D. Clayton has attributed this seemingly inexplicable oversight in B2FH to the lack of proofreading by Hoyle of the draft composed at Caltech in 1956 by G.R. Burbidge and E.M. Burbidge.|$|E

40|$|Mobile Ad-hoc Network (MANET) is a {{group of}} moving nodes which can {{communicate}} with each other without the help of any central stationary node. All the nodes in the MANET act as router for forwarding data packets. The nodes in the network also move randomly and there exists no fixed infrastructure. So, <b>path</b> <b>breaks</b> are the frequent problem in MANET. The routing protocol faces a lot of problem due these <b>path</b> <b>breaks.</b> Therefore, the routing protocol which is multipath in nature is more reliable than a unipath routing protocol. Ant colony optimization is a relatively new technique which is suitable for the optimization problems. AOMDV is a multipath routing protocol. Thus, if there happens to be <b>path</b> <b>break,</b> the packets can start following the new path which has already been selected. In this paper, we are trying to add ant’s agents into AOMDV behavior. In this way, the new protocol will be benefited by the dual properties i. e. of ant’s nature and multipath nature of AOMDV. The modified concept is simulated and the outcomes are compared with AOMDV, AODV and DSR routing protocols for few performance parameters. Results obtained are encouraging; the new algorithm performs better than traditional unipath and multipath routing protocols...|$|R

Data packets waiting for a route should be buffered during route discovery.|$|R

30|$|Routing in ad hoc {{networks}} {{is challenging}} as nodes are mobile and links are continuously created and broken. Current on-demand ad hoc routing algorithms start route discovery after <b>path</b> <b>break,</b> incurring high cost {{to detect the}} disconnection and {{to establish a new}} route. Specifically, when a path is liable to break, the source is warned about the likelihood of disconnection. The source then starts path discovery avoiding disconnection entirely. A path is likely to break when link availability decreases. Since routing is nondeterministic polynomial (NP) hard, this work proposes an improved ad hoc on-demand multipath distance vector (AOMDV) based on link availability, neighboring node’s queuing delay, node mobility, and bit error rate. The optimal path is selected using BAT meta-heuristic optimization. Simulation shows improved performance compared to AOMDV.|$|R
