40|$|Patients with esophageal hiatal hernia {{often have}} {{an array of}} {{distressing}} complaints and physical signs {{that are difficult to}} interpret. Physiologic and anatomic studies of the gastroesophageal area in the region of the esophageal hiatus of the diaphragm indicate the existence of a three-in-line sphincter group, consisting of the inferior esophageal constrictor, diaphragmatic <b>pinchcock</b> and cardioesophageal junction. These mechanisms, acting in unison, prevent regurgitation in normal persons...|$|E
40|$|ArticleThe {{original}} publication {{is available}} at [URL] is shown that the dorsal ganglion arises as a herniation from the dorsal scapholunate ligament. This herniation increases in size (according to La Place's law) owing to the unidirectional <b>pinchcock</b> effect of the mucosal folds of the duct and {{the pressure of the}} overlying extensor retinaculum until the distending pressure inside the ganglion equals the overlying tissue pressure. Wrist gangliography, retrograde wrist arthrography, histology and nuclear magnetic resonance were used to prove this conclusively. Bearing the pathogenesis in mind, the best clinical results were obtained by excision of the ganglion with 0, 5 cm 2 of dorsal scapholunate ligament and closure of the dorsal capsule with a 3 / 0 Vicryl purse-string suture. Non-surgical sclerotherapy led to severe inflammation and sepsis and a recurrence rate of 45 %. Conservative therapy is illogical since the communicating duct remains and synovial fluid from the scapholunate joint will cause a reherniation and recurrence of the ganglion.
