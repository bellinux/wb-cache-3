40|$|The Standing Committee is most {{grateful}} for the opportunity the services of the European Commission provided during the meeting on 8 October 2007 to express our views on the intended proposal to give law enforcement authorities access to Eurodac. We appreciate the openness of the Commission and the insight you gave in the intended legislative measures developed so far. However, we still have serious concerns as to the legality and the usefulness of this possible proposal. There are five core arguments why the intended proposal in our view would be unlawful: firstly, access to Eurodac data for law enforcement authorities would be irreconcilable with the present purpose limitation of the Eurodac regulation, secondly, there is no legal basis in EC law for extending the use of Eurodac with security purposes. Thirdly, such an extension is incompatible with basic principles of European law, international standards, and constitutional law of the Member States, the observance of which the Court of Justice ensures 1. Fourthly, data protection authorities lack sufficient means {{to protect the rights}} of asylum seekers and fifthly, the proposal will affect the integrity of Eurodac. We will explain below, why in our view the intended measures are vulnerable for annulment by the Court of Justice. 1. No legal basis in EC Treaty for extending Eurodac purpose with security goals The present purpose of the Eurodac regulation gives no room for granting access to its data to law enforcement authorities. During the October 8 meeting it was contended that a modification of the <b>purpose</b> <b>of</b> <b>Eurodac</b> would suffice t...|$|E

40|$|This study {{accounts}} {{for the emergence of}} a supranational biometric control regime in Europe. The empirical focus lies on the institutionalization <b>of</b> <b>Eurodac,</b> an automated fingerprint identification system covering asylum seekers and "illegal" immigrants. Who promoted the idea of setting up an automated biometric system in the European Community? Which behavioral logics were underlying the negotiation <b>of</b> the <b>Eurodac</b> Regulations in the Justice and Home Affairs Council? And how did the European Commission get involved in policing the so-called "Area of Freedom, Security and Justice"?

40|$|Please find {{attached}} a note by the Meijers Committee on the amended {{proposal for a}} Regulation on the establishment <b>of</b> <b>Eurodac.</b> The new draft provides for the possibility to request comparison with Eurodac data by Member States law enforcement authorities and Europol. This was also proposed in 2009 but lapsed {{as a consequence of}} the Treaty of Lisbon. The Meijers Committee strongly opposes this access to law enforcement authorities, because it breaches fundamental rights of asylum seekers, including their right to privacy and data protection, the right to asylum and protection against torture and inhuman treatment. Furthermore, the extended use <b>of</b> <b>Eurodac</b> data involves the risk of stigmatisation of a particular group of persons, namely asylum seekers (see section 1 of the accompanying note). For this reason, the Meijers Committee advises the members of the European Parliament to vote against this proposal. If the European Parliament decides to accept access for law enforcement authorities and Europol to Eurodac data, the Meijers Committee urges to take into account the comments in the accompanying note (see section 2). We hope you will find these comments useful. Should any questions arise, the Meijers Committee is prepared to provide you with further information on this subject. Yours sincerely...|$|R

Common policies appeared in the 1990s {{in connection with the}} Schengen Agreement (which suppressed internal borders) so that asylum seekers unsuccessful in one Member State would not reapply in another. The common policy began with the Dublin Convention in 1990. It continued with the implementation <b>of</b> <b>Eurodac</b> and the Dublin Regulation in 2003, and the October 2009 adoption of two proposals by the European Commission.|$|R

40|$|Eurodac The body as {{object of}} {{technologies}} {{of government in}} the European Migration Regime Eurodac is an Automated Fingerprint Identification System for comparing the fingerprints of asylum seekers and irregular immigrants. In this project we examine how the body figure {{as an object of}} government through identification processes in Eurodac. We focus on technologies of fingerprinting and age assessment, their history, use and legitimacy. We also examine how Eurodac works as a technology of government in the EU, through a look at the knowledge production, documentation and evaluation within Eurodac. Lastly the project is concerned with how techniques and rationalities of governmentality render irregular migration visible in the EU. From an interest in the concept of governmentality in the framework of biopolitics as developed by Michel Foucault the project draws on the theories of Giorgio Agamben and his idea of naked life and inclusion through exclusion within the nationstate. Moreover the project is inspired by and draws on Donna Haraway who critiques objectivity and explores power relations within truth claims and science production. Through a critical examination <b>of</b> <b>Eurodac</b> and the techniques and rationalitites of fingerprinting and age assessment the project concludes that identification processes within Eurodac is embedded in discourses of objectivity and truth, criminology, medicine, rationality and necessity. This entails that irregular migration though the identification process, documentation and knowledge production becomes visible as a not-political, bureaucratic issue in the European Migration Regime...|$|R
