In a ballad 'Bye Bye', Carey isn't taking chances, designing the lyrics for mass appeal by dedicating them to anyone who ever lost somebody, be it 'your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady'. But Carey gracefully <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> universality of the lyrics, and the tune will likely be a massive hit.|$|E

Richard Edwards of SFX gave the episode {{five out of}} five stars and wrote [...] "Steven Moffat <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> remarkable feat of making it feel like the logical denouement of last week's outing." [...] While {{he noted that the}} [...] "end of the world" [...] scenario was very common, he said that it had never [...] "been quite so pleasingly complex" [...] and that [...] "even if there are several plot holes, it's difficult to get too worried about them when the story packs such a strong emotional wallop". Den of Geek's Simon Brew also gave the episode a positive review, writing [...] "if you were awaiting a simple, easy-to-explain blockbuster of a Doctor Who series finale, you simply didn't get it here. Instead, if you were looking for something really very ambitious, often quite confusing, yet ultimately far more satisfying, then 'The Big Bang' absolutely hit the mark." ...|$|E
500|$|Rotten Tomatoes {{reported}} that 92% of critics gave the film positive write-ups, {{based on a}} sample of 154, with an average score of 8/10, with del Toro receiving widespread acclaim, and the consensus being [...] "Soderbergh successfully <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> highly ambitious Traffic, a movie with three different stories and a very large cast. The issues of ethics are gray rather than black-and-white, with no clear-cut good guys. Terrific acting all around." [...] At Metacritic the film has received an average score of 86, based on 34 reviews. Film critic Roger Ebert gave the film four out of four stars and wrote, [...] "The movie is powerful precisely because it doesn't preach. It is so restrained that at one momentthe judge's final speechI wanted one more sentence, making a point, but the movie lets us supply that thought for ourselves". Stephen Holden, in his review for The New York Times, wrote, [...] "Traffic is an utterly gripping, edge-of-your-seat thriller. Or rather it is several interwoven thrillers, {{each with its own}} tense rhythm and explosive payoff". In his review for The New York Observer, Andrew Sarris wrote, [...] "Traffic marks [...] definitively as an enormous talent, one who never lets us guess what he's going to do next. The promise of Sex, Lies, and Videotape has been fulfilled".|$|E

[...] Peter Travers, writing for Rolling Stone, called the film [...] "a smart, passionate, steadily engrossing thriller". Janet Maslin of The New York Times praised Pakula's direction, writing, [...] "Pakula has directed an intense, enveloping, gratifyingly thorough screen adaptation of Mr. Turow's story." [...] Film critic Jonathan Rosenbaum wrote that film was [...] "a top-notch courtroom drama that will keep you guessing if you haven't read the book; even if you have, it is still a very well crafted story." [...] Variety magazine praised the performances, writing, [...] "Ford, in a very mature, subtle, lowkey performance, <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> difficult feat of making it impossible to be sure.

2500|$|Furthermore, {{two other}} rule {{changes have been}} implemented. Since 2000, with one lap to go before going back to green, the pace car <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> track in turn one rather than in turn four. The current leader of the race is then {{assigned}} the task of pacing the field back to the green flag. After much consideration, this rule was added to prevent a situation {{much like the one}} that happened in the 1995 Indianapolis 500, when Scott Goodyear passed the pace car going back to green. In 2002, another rule was added. With one lap to go before the green, the pace car waves by all cars (if there are any) between the pace car and the actual leader of the race. This allows for the leader to control the restart without lapped cars being in front of him. It also creates a strategy for cars to gain laps back, loosely resembling the [...] "Lucky dog" [...] rule. However, the cars who get waved around are not allowed to pit until the green flag restarts the race (so they do not get the advantage of getting their lap back AND a free pit stop).|$|E
2500|$|The game {{utilized}} a {{new game}} engine; the Dark Alliance Engine, {{which was built}} specifically for Dark Alliance, and {{would go on to}} become the foundation for other games on the PlayStation 2, such as [...] and The Bard's Tale. Graphically, the Dark Alliance engine is a major improvement over the engine used by the original PC Baldur's Gate games, the Infinity Engine. Infinity was only able to render 2D sprite characters and static environments. The Dark Alliance engine, on the other hand, made use of the PlayStation 2's advanced GPU, allowing for such improvements as dynamic lighting, real-time shadowing and 3D models of characters and environments. IGN wrote of the E3 presentation, [...] "None of the problems that are commonly associated with PlayStation 2 games, such as low-res textures, flickering, or aliasing problems, are to be found here. It's hard to think of a game that <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> much-fabled anti-aliasing as well as this game does. Dark Alliance uses a technique similar to what a large number of Dreamcast games did to pull off their clean look: they simply render the scene at a much higher resolution, anti-alias it, then drop it down to a more acceptable resolution for TVs. The result is a beautifully anti-aliased game." ...|$|E

[...] Jim Farber of the New York Daily News claimed the track [...] "is a breezy, summer song that will get stuck in your head" [...] but lacking [...] "the snap, and the freshness" [...] of [...] "Fancy."

The group composed the grand, fascistic-inspired, ominous Panem national anthem, entitled [...] "Horn of Plenty", an important and signature leitmotif appearing throughout the film. [...] "We were interested in making music that would be more integral in the movie, just as a mental exercise," [...] Butler, who co-wrote the song with Chassagne, explained. [...] "And there's an anthem that runs throughout the books, the national anthem of the fascist Capitol. So as a thought experiment, we tried to write what that might sound like. It's like the Capitol's idea of itself, basically." [...] He further added that [...] "it's not a pop song or anything. More of an anthem that could be playing at a big sporting event like the [...] Games. So we did a structure for that, and then James Newton Howard made a movie-score version of it that happens in several places in the film." [...] Arcade Fire's Panem national anthem has received strong reviews. According to Spin, [...] "'Horn of Plenty' <b>pulls</b> <b>off</b> <b>the</b> neat feat of sounding both exactly like Arcade Fire and exactly like a futuristic anthem. It still has one foot in the band's uncorrupted neighborhoods, but another is up on the podium at the end of Star Wars accepting an Olympic gold medal or something.

H-a-r-t-n was much cast down at the grand affair's [Elibank plot] being retarded. He wrote to Ld. S-t-ln [Strathallan] aquenting him therewith, for Ld. S-t-ln and Young Ga [Glengarry?] had been sent some time before to sound Ld. George Murray, not knowing how he stood affected, as he [Prince Charles] had once greatly disoblidgd him. S. J. H-a-r-t-n aquenting them of the disappointment in England, stopt further proceedings, so they return'd back to Boulogne. Pickle went streight from Boulogne to Paris, where he was very intimate with Ld. Marischal; few days past but Pickle was at his lodgings or M-r-l- at Pickle's. Ld. M-r- l- was first aquented with the intended insurrection in England by Goring who waited of him by his master's [Charles's] particular order, a person of distinction spoke very seriously to M-r-l- upon this head. Pickle {{does not know how}} [who] this was, M-r-l- declining to mention names, yet he estem'd this person as a man of weight, and good judgement, this person was publick at Paris, but waited of M-r-l at night--Carte has been several times over, he is trusted, and it is by his means chiefly, that the P. turn'd off Kelly, as Mr. Carte inform'd the P. that persons of note would enter upon no scheme with him whilst that fellow shar'd his confidence. Sir Jo: A-s-ly [?] was over, and Pickle believes he met the P. at Paris. The pretence of Mr. Swem-rs, Memr. of Pt. traveling abroad with his lady, was to settle the English Scheme. Ld. M-r-l has not seen the P. but twice, before Pickle went over. He never saw him at Berlin, THO' HE BELIEVED THAT HE HAD TAKEN SEVERAL TRIPS TO THAT COURT. He saw Goring twice at Berlin. M-r-l knew nothing of a foreign Invation, and did not believe there could be any in time of peace. Pickle one day asking his opinion of their affairs, he answer'd that he could say nothing upon the head with certainty, he kept his mind to himself, that when they ask'd his Opinion, he told them he COULD NOT JUDGE SO WELL AS THEY, SINCE HE WAS QUITE A STRANGER TO LONDON, AND TO THE DIFFERENT POSTS, AND MANNER OF PLACING THEIR GUARDS, BUT THAT IF THEY EXECUTED ACCORDING TO THEIR PLAN LAID BEFORE HIM, HE DOUBTED NOT BUT THEY MIGHT SUCCEED, but Pickle making some objections as to the veracity of this plan, told him that he could not positively contradick them, and tell the P. that they impost upon him, for, says he, [...] "what Opinion, Mr. Pickle, can I entertain of people that propos'd that I should abandon my Embassy, and embark headlong with them? what can I answer, when they assure me that B-d-rl, S-dh G-me- ele [?] with others of that party have agreed when once matters break out, to declare themselves?
