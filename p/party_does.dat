5|$|A {{leader of}} a party is chosen by the party, {{following}} an internal constitution unique to each party that comprises a framework to elect or appoint a leader. The leader, {{if he or she}} does not already have a seat, must then win a seat in a by-election or general election to sit in the Assembly. If a {{leader of a}} <b>party</b> <b>does</b> not have a seat, he or she must sit in the legislature gallery. While sitting in the gallery a premier cannot exercise any legislative powers.|$|E
5|$|In 1958, {{the leader}} of the North Carolina branch of the CPUSA, Junius Scales, became the final CPUSA member convicted under the Smith Act, and the only one convicted after the Yates decision. Prosecutors pursued Scales' case because he {{specifically}} advocated violent political action and gave demonstrations of martial arts skills. Scales was accused of violating the membership clause of the Smith Act, not the clause prohibiting advocacy of violence against the government. In his appeal to the Supreme Court, Scales contended that the 1950 McCarran Internal Security Act rendered the Smith Act's membership clause ineffective, because the McCarran Act explicitly stated that membership in a communist <b>party</b> <b>does</b> not constitute a per se violation of any criminal statute. In 1961, the Supreme Court, in a 5–4 decision, upheld Scales' conviction, finding that the Smith Act membership clause was not obviated by the McCarran Act, because the Smith Act required prosecutors to prove first, that there was direct advocacy of violence; and second, that the defendant's membership was substantial and active, not merely passive or technical. Two Justices of the Supreme Court who had supported the Yates decision in 1957, Harlan and Frankfurter, voted to uphold Scales' conviction.|$|E
25|$|Unless {{the parties}} have {{otherwise}} provided, {{the death of a}} <b>party</b> <b>does</b> not usually revoke the appointment of any arbitrator appointed by the deceased, and any agreement relating to the appointment is enforceable in the usual way against the personal representatives of the deceased.|$|E

25|$|On 29 June 2017, the Civic Democratic Alliance (ODA) {{announced}} that its candidate will be Vratislav Kulhánek. He needed to collect 50,000 signatures as the <b>party</b> <b>does</b> {{not have any}} MPs or Senators. He eventually managed to secure nomination by 23 MPs.|$|E

25|$|Although the <b>party</b> <b>does</b> {{not have}} an {{official}} stance on the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership, the party's trade spokesperson (Lord Dartmouth) and health spokesperson (Louise Bours) have stated {{that they do not}} wish the National Health Service {{to be included in the}} trade deal, according to the International Business Times.|$|E
25|$|The Australian Democrats {{have said}} they will appeal the AEC decision, which under the {{legislation}} is reviewable. However the <b>party</b> <b>does</b> not appear on the AEC Current Register of Political Parties and could not contest the 2016 Federal Election. Much of their support in the party's birthplace, South Australia, flowed to the Nick Xenophon Team, which has a very similar platform.|$|E
25|$|According to the Radio Dabanga website, the Sudanese Security Service {{monitors}} all Sudanese newspapers daily, demanding editors delete and censor {{news about}} corruption, security, or {{the war crimes}} committed by the government against its own citizens in Darfur, South Kordofan, and along the Blue Nile. Also, several journalists have noted that the ruling National Congress <b>Party</b> <b>does</b> not allow any media to be published not in their interests.|$|E

25|$|The Iowa Democratic <b>Party</b> <b>does</b> {{not release}} vote counts (it {{releases}} only {{the number of}} delegates to the state convention). Since Hillary Rodham Clinton had the highest delegate strength in Iowa's 5th congressional district (a district allocated four national convention delegates) and received {{the same amount of}} national delegates elsewhere, she was projected to receive one more national delegate than Edwards despite receiving fewer projected delegates to the state convention.|$|E
25|$|Some {{cases are}} {{automatically}} appealed (for instance, when a marriage {{is found to}} be null). The appealing <b>party</b> <b>does</b> not need to appeal to the metropolitan; the party can instead appeal to the Holy See, in which case the Roman Rota would hear the case in the second instance. If the case was before the Rota in the first instance, then a different panel of the Rota hears it in the second instance.|$|E
25|$|Unlike the Democratic caucus, the Republican <b>Party</b> <b>does</b> not use voting rounds or have minimum {{requirements}} for {{a percent of}} votes. The Republican version is done with a straw vote of those attending the caucus. This vote is sometimes done by {{a show of hands}} or by dividing themselves into groups according to candidate. However, officially it is done with voters receiving a blank piece of paper with no names on it, and the voter writing a name and placing it in a ballot box.|$|E

25|$|A {{party to}} a {{proceeding}} {{should have the}} right to access documentation which had been produced by the other party to the proceedings. It would be wrong if such documents were not shown to the other party at all. If a party to the proceedings needs time to study or make copies of the documents, he or she should be allowed to do so. However, as the High Court opined in Teng Cheng Sin v. Law Fay Yuen (2003), if a <b>party</b> <b>does</b> not request for copies of documents or for time to study the documents, a complaint of this nature will carry much less weight.|$|E
25|$|The main {{principle}} that guides the party's internal structure, being a Leninist party, is democratic centralism, which implies that all party organs, {{from top to}} bottom, are elected and may be dismissed by those who elected them, if needed; the members who have tasks in any structure of the party are responsible to both lower and upper levels, being obliged to report the activities to both and to give consideration to their opinions and criticisms; lower-level structures must respect {{the decisions of the}} upper structures; every member is free to give his opinion during the discussion, and the structures must take in account the contribution of every member; every member must obey the decisions achieved by consensus or by a majority; every member must work along with his own structure; the <b>party</b> <b>does</b> not recognize the existence of organized factions inside it.|$|E
500|$|The Progress <b>Party</b> <b>does</b> {{not belong}} to any {{international}} political groups, and {{does not have any}} official sister parties. Historically the party has not compared itself to other European parties, and has sought to rather establish its own identity. In 2008 however, the party for the first time set out to build its international reputation by hiring two international secretaries to travel internationally and establishing contact with politicians and parties abroad. This was cited especially to [...] "not risk being declared as extremists by opponents the day we form a government". An international secretary for the party in the same year said that the party had been connected with a [...] "misunderstood right-wing radical label", partly because people with nationalistic and [...] "hopeless attitudes" [...] had previously been involved in the party. Such persons were said no longer to be involved.|$|E

500|$|Ever {{since its}} foundation, other parties have {{consistently}} refused the Progress Party's efforts to join any governing coalition {{at the state}} level. The reasons have mainly included concerns about the party's alleged irresponsibility and its position on immigration issues. Following the increased support and importance of the Progress Party in the 2005 elections, the Conservative Party stated {{they wanted to be}} [...] "a bridge between the Progress Party and the centre." [...] This is because the centrist Liberal Party and Christian Democratic Party reject the possibility of participating in a government coalition together with the Progress Party. In addition, the Progress <b>Party</b> <b>does</b> not want to support a government coalition that it itself is not a part of. In 2010, the Conservative Party went even further when its leader Erna Solberg stated that the Progress Party was now such a big party that it [...] "must" [...] be part of any centre-right governmental negotiations after the 2013 elections. At the municipal level, the Progress Party however cooperates with most parties, including the Labour Party. In 2007 it also attracted some unusual attention when the local Porsgrunn Progress Party was involved in some limited cooperation with the Socialist Left Party and the Red Party.|$|E
500|$|It {{has been}} argued in recent years, mainly by foreign commentators, that the CPC {{does not have an}} ideology, and that the party {{organization}} is pragmatic and interested only in what works. This view is considered wrong by some in many ways, since official statements make it very clear the <b>party</b> <b>does</b> have a coherent worldview. For instance, Hu Jintao stated in 2012 that the Western world is [...] "threatening to divide us" [...] and that [...] "the international culture of the West is strong while we are weak ... Ideological and cultural fields are our main targets". The CPC puts a great deal of effort into the party schools and into crafting its ideological message. Before the [...] "Practice Is the Sole Criterion for the Truth" [...] campaign, the relationship between ideology and decision-making was a deductive one, meaning that policy-making was derived from ideological knowledge. Under Deng this relationship was turned upside down, with decision-making justifying ideology and not the other way around. Lastly, Chinese policy-makers believe {{that one of the reasons}} for the dissolution of the Soviet Union was its stagnant state ideology. They therefore believe that their party ideology must be dynamic to safeguard the party's rule, unlike the Soviet Union's communist party, whose ideology they believe became [...] "rigid, unimaginative, ossified, and disconnected from reality." ...|$|E
