40|$|Abstract. The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to experimentally investigate the mechanisms in machining of aluminum/silicon carbide (SiC) composite with two types of diamond whiskers. These whiskers are prepared from polycrystalline diamond compacts (PDC) and chemical vapor deposition (CVD) diamond plates which are cut into dimensions of 10 × 0. 3 × 0. 6 mm with an Nd:YAG (Neodymium-doped Yttrium Aluminum Garnet) laser. In order to obtain sharp and consistent cutting edges, the diamond whiskers are polished with diamond powders of the average grain sizes of 10 µm, 2. 5 µm and 1 µm, respectively. A <b>precision</b> <b>grinder</b> is used to conduct machining of the aluminum/SiC composite at a depth of cut smaller than that in the conventional milling but larger than the individual grit depth of cut in grinding. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) is utilized for observing the machined workpiece surfaces, the whisker cutting edges, and a surface profilometer for inspecting surface roughness and verifying the actual depth of cut in the machined workpiece. The study discusses the mechanisms of workpiece material removal and diamond whisker wear in machining of the aluminum/SiC composite...|$|E

40|$|H UNT and Hoppert 4 - 8 have {{produced}} two decidedly different strains of rats, {{one of which}} is extremely susceptible to dental caries in lower molar teeth and the other is very resistant. The differentiation of these strains was accom-plished by phenotypic selection, progeny testing, close inbreeding, and the use of a caries-producing diet. Hoppert, Webber, and Canniffl 2 discovered that a diet of coarsely ground hulled rice, whole milk powder, alfalfa leaf meal, and sodium chloride would produce dental caries in the lower molar teeth of rats. This is the ration used in the production of these two strains of rats. The rice was ground in a <b>precision</b> <b>grinder</b> set so that approximately 70 per cent (by weight) would be retained on a 20 mesh screen. Occasional fractures in the rats ' teeth were believed to result from the rather large particles of rice in the feed.

Therefore accidental breakage of upper molar teeth probably interfered with caries development in the opposin...|$|E

The mathematical model of two-phase flow pressure field of grinding zone with nanoparticle jet flow of MQL was established, and the simulation study was conducted. The results show that pressures in the grinding zone increased with the acceleration of grinding wheel, sharply decreased with the increased minimum clearance, and increased with the acceleration of jet flow. At three spraying angles of nozzles, when the nozzle angle was 15 °, the pressure of grinding zone along the speed of grinding wheel was larger than the rest two angles.

This study compared the performances of MQL grinding by using castor oil, soybean oil, rapeseed oil, corn oil, sunflower oil, peanut oil, and palm oil as base oils. A K-P 36 numerical-control <b>precision</b> surface <b>grinder</b> was used to perform plain grinding on a workpiece material with a high-temperature nickel base alloy. A YDM–III 99 three-dimensional dynamometer was used to measure grinding force, and a clip-type thermocouple was used to determine grinding temperature. The grinding force, grinding temperature, and energy ratio coefficient of MQL grinding were compared among the seven vegetable oil types. Results revealed that (1) castor oil-based MQL grinding yields the lowest grinding force but exhibits the highest grinding temperature and energy ratio coefficient; (2) palm oil-based MQL grinding generates the second lowest grinding force but shows the lowest grinding temperature and energy ratio coefficient; (3) MQL grinding based on the five other vegetable oils produces similar grinding forces, grinding temperatures, and energy ratio coefficients, with values ranging between those of castor oil and palm oil; (4) viscosity significantly influences grinding force and grinding temperature to a greater extent than fatty acid varieties and contents in vegetable oils; (5) although more viscous vegetable oil exhibits greater lubrication and significantly lower grinding force than less viscous vegetable oil, high viscosity reduces the heat exchange capability of vegetable oil and thus yields a high grinding temperature; (6) saturated fatty acid is a more efficient lubricant than unsaturated fatty acid; and (7) a short carbon chain transfers heat more effectively than a long carbon chain. Palm oil is the optimum base oil of MQL grinding, and this base oil yields 26. 98 N tangential grinding force, 87. 10 N normal grinding force, 119. 6 °C grinding temperature, and 42. 7 % energy ratio coefficient...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} work was primarily concentrated on precise ductile-mode grinding (milling) of flat surfaces of silicon, mainly Integrated Circuit (IC) silicon chips (dies), which were about 700 Âµm thick {{and the top}} of their surfaces covered with a silicon nitride layer. Substantial amount of partial-ductile streaks on a machined silicon surface shortens polishing time dramatically. This is of vital importance particularly in chip-making and optical industries for failure analysis. Failure analysis is a technique usually practised for locating a fault in a finished IC product. In chip-making industries, the analysis is done on the damage-free mirror-like finished silicon die of the IC. Grinding, lapping and/or polishing operations are required to get such a smooth surface. Precision grinding in a ductile mode therefore remains the critical and most important machining operation as the surface and sub-surface damages will be minimized. This results in good quality surface in terms of surface finish and flatness {{and at the same time}} generating the maximum amount of ductile streaks on the machined surface. Silicon material other than the IC silicon was also tried out for purpose of comparison and because of limited number of IC chips. Silicon like any hard and brittle material is well known for its low machinability unless it is machined under ductile mode condition. Ductile mode machining is a process that makes brittle materials to behave like ductile materials. A low cost machining technique, which facilitates partial-ductile mode grinding of small areas on thin wafer-like silicon, was developed. A specially modified conventional MAHO CNC Vertical Milling Centre that has an air driven low powered high-speed attachment (<b>precision</b> jig <b>grinder)</b> facilitated the diamond grinding. Special fixtures were designed and fabricated that held the workpieces in position and prevented them from damage during machining. Both traditional and statistical techniques for designing of experiments and subsequent analysis of results were employed in this study. A low cutting force dynamometer (Compacdyn) was used to measure cutting forces. Form Talysurf and Surfcom Surface Analysers and Atomic Force Microscope were used to measure surface texture parameters. Optical, Scanning Electron microscopy techniques, together with the Surfcom Surface Analyser and Atomic Force Microscope, were used to examine the surface morphology of the machined silicon surfaces. It was found that the amount of ductile streaks generated on a work-piece surface was not only dependent on feed and depth of cut but also on the grit size of diamond abrasive. The machining technique of grinding yielded ground surfaces with Ra as low as 50 nm, and forces around 0. 8 Newton. Flatness of the machined surfaces is very good. A model of surface roughness (Ra) for precision grinding of thin silicon has been established...|$|R
