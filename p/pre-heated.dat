The {{majority}} of this was spat out of the exhaust ports and smothered the test cell walls, milk being given to staff to minimise the effects of this well-known laxative. Up to 200gal (900L) of the special fuel blend had to be mixed for each test, 80gal (360L) of which were used just to warm the engine to operating temperature. The same coarse-pitch propeller used for flight trials was fitted throughout these tests.|$|E

25|$|The British company Rotron, which specialises in {{unmanned}} aerial vehicle (UAV) {{applications of}} Wankel engines, has designed and built a unit to operate on heavy fuel for NATO purposes. The engines uses spark ignition. The prime innovation is flame propagation, ensuring the flame burns smoothly across the whole combustion chamber. The fuel is <b>pre-heated</b> to 98 degrees Celsius before it is injected into the combustion chamber. Four spark plugs are utilised, aligned in two pairs. Two spark plugs ignite the fuel charge {{at the front of}} the rotor as it moves into the combustion section of the housing. As the rotor moves the fuel charge, the second two fire a fraction of second behind the first pair of plugs, igniting near the rear of the rotor at the back of the fuel charge. The drive shaft is water cooled which also has a cooling effect on the internals of the rotor. Cooling water also flows around the external of the engine through a gap in the housing, thus reducing the heat of the engine from outside and inside eliminating hot spots.|$|E

The aim of wire bonding is to form quality and reliable solid-state bonds to interconnect metals such as gold wires to metalized pads deposited on silicon integrated circuits. Typically, there are 3 main wire bonding techniques applied in the industry; Thermo-compression, Ultrasonic and Thermosonic.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we look at}} the {{principles}} underlying the revamping of <b>pre-heat</b> trains to save energy through increased heat recovery. For brevity, we do not consider throughput changes. Only <b>pre-heat</b> train performance is considered. The interaction between <b>pre-heat</b> train and crude oil distillation column performance is considered elsewhere. The principles underlying the design of new <b>pre-heat</b> trains are also considered elsewhere. That study shows that that <b>pre-heat</b> trains differ from general heat recovery networks in four important respects: (i) The heat demand is dominated by a single 'cold' stream; (ii) Rather than having a distinct 'pinch point', the composite curves are often close over quite a large region; (iii) The heat demand can be broken up into two or three distinct processing regions and the temperatures of these divisions are fixed and more significant than the 'pinch point' itself; (iv) The rate of fouling encountered in <b>pre-heat</b> train exchangers is dependent upon crude oil velocity and exchanger wall temperature. This means that the 'pinch technology principle' of matching the hottest hot stream with the cold stream at its hottest point, first proposed by Ponton & Donaldson, does not necessarily apply with <b>pre-heat</b> trains. When it comes to revamping projects, <b>pre-heat</b> trains differ from general problems in other important aspects. The first is that pressure drop considerations are very important. The pumps used to drive the crude through the train are very expensive. The designer will therefore seek to achieve the targets without pump replacement. Pressure drop is very strongly affected by fouling and allowance will have been made for this in the pump specification. There is, as shown below, a need to consider the hydraulic effects of fouling during retrofit projects. Finally, exchanger technologies which mitigate fouling are becoming established and should be considered during revamp design...|$|R

40|$|The {{optically}} stimulated luminescence (OSL) signal within quartz may {{be enhanced}} by thermal transfer during <b>pre-heating.</b> This may occur via a thermally induced charge transfer from low temperature traps to the OSL traps. Thermal transfer may affect both natural and artificially irradiated samples. The effect, as empirically measured via recuperation tests, is typically observed to be negligible for old samples (< 1 % of natural signal). However, thermal transfer remains a major concern in the dating of young samples as thermal decay and transfers of geologically unstable traps (typically in the TL range 160 – 280 °C) may be incomplete. Upon <b>pre-heating</b> such a sample might undergo thermal transfer to the dating trap and result in a De overestimate. As a result, {{there has been a}} tendency for workers to adopt less rigorous <b>pre-heats</b> for young samples. We have investigated the <b>pre-heat</b> dependence of 23 young quartz samples from various depositional environments using <b>pre-heats</b> between 170 °C and 300 °C, employing the single aliquot regeneration (SAR) protocol.
