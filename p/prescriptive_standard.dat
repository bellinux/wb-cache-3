40|$|Thesis (M. Sc. Eng.) -University of KwaZulu-Natal, Durban, 2009. South African heavy {{vehicles}} are currently designed according to <b>prescriptive</b> <b>standards</b> designed and {{enforced by the}} National Department of Transport (DoT); these standards are regulated in terms of mass, dimensions and vehicle configuration. However, the current <b>prescriptive</b> <b>standards</b> leave little room for innovation in terms of heavy vehicle design. Performance Based Standards, or PBS, is a new Australian based innovative alternative to the current heavy vehicle <b>prescriptive</b> <b>standards,</b> mass, dimensions and vehicle configuration. PBS seeks to align actual vehicle performance efficiencies, productivity and safety objectives as well as road and bridge infrastructure to the current road network. Vehicle performance measures are based on engineering and science, supporting superior safety and known road and bridge wear performance criteria. PBS produces “a result orientated approach” to improved heavy vehicle operations and safety rather than a „one size fits all approach‟ utilised by the current prescriptive legislation. Currently, dynamic vehicle simulations are not carried out on South African manufactured vehicle combinations. Evidence exists that this has, in some cases, resulted in safety compromises. The computer dynamic vehicle simulation technology developed and validated could be employed for the credible assessments of the vehicle design concepts/prototypes for compliance with PBS. This service, which includes vehicle performance simulation and testing, development of high productivity vehicle concepts, assessment and development of risk management strategies, advice on safety and productivity issues, would have a substantial commercialisation potential for the implementation in the larger transport industry in South Africa...|$|R

40|$|Minority {{language}} {{planning and}} efforts to revitalise endangered languages have been criticised for following a model of language planning common to majority languages, i. e. promoting a <b>prescriptive</b> <b>standard</b> which reproduces hierarchies and hegemonies (Schieffelin et al. 1998; Heller 2004) and diminishes linguistic diversity (Sayers, 2009). An alternative {{is the concept of}} ‘polynomic’ languages (Marcellesi 1986), a pluralistic model of language without a single prestige variety or functional distinctions. This model is used in the teaching of Corsican (Jaffe 1999 a; 2005; 2008; Blackwood 2008). Research into the indigenous language variety of Guernsey reveals ‘folk linguistic’ acceptance of a regional variation as a source of richness, which suggests that a polynomic approach might be applicable. At the same time, notions of ‘right’ and ‘wrong’ are ingrained from Western-style education. Linguistic purism is also on the increase in reaction to perceptions of language change. This paper compares language planning in Guernsey and Corsica in the light of these challenges, and discusses whether a polynomic model of language planning is feasible in such a context. ...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Fetal femur volume (FV) is {{a useful}} marker of {{skeletal}} growth. Our objective {{was to create a}} normal FV chart in a cohort of healthy pregnant women and to assess FV repeatability. METHOD: The method used was a prospective, observational study using 3 D ultrasound. Low-risk pregnant women underwent serial scans from 14 to 42 [*]weeks. Strict inclusion and exclusion criteria were used in order to remove pathological conditions. Pregnancies were dated by last menstrual period and confirmed by crown-rump length. FV was measured using three linear measurements and a volume equation. Data were analyzed using multilevel modeling. Repeatability was assessed using within-subject coefficients of variation (CV), intraclass correlation coefficients (ICC), and Bland-Altman plots. RESULTS: A total of 180 women underwent 868 scans, a median of five scans per participant. Median and centile values were presented in the form of curves, regression equations, and table of values per completed week. Intra-observer CV and ICC were 10. 5 % and 0. 977, respectively; interobserver CV and ICC were 16. 8 % and 0. 923.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} of the durability of high-volume fly ash concrete exposed to carbonation (XC class in EN 206 - 1 Standard). The reduction of cement content is assumed to mitigate CO 2 emissions due to the production of Portland cement clinker. The durability of concrete is assessed through a performance-based approach. First, a performance-based method was applied to design a concrete mixture with more than 50 % substitution of cement by fly ash. To cope with the high viscosity of the so-obtained mixture, an air-entraining agent was used. Due to its low cement content, the so-obtained mixture does not comply with the prescriptive requirements of the European standard (EN 206 - 1). Thus, according to the equivalent performance concept, its potential durability has to be proved through comparison with reference mixtures complying with <b>prescriptive</b> <b>standard</b> requirements. The performance-based evaluation of the durability of the designed mixture and reference mixtures (with Portland cement and blended cement) consisted in porosity and accelerated carbonation tests. The influence of curing mode and thermal treatment duration before carbonation test were also investigated. Whatever the curing mode, the designed mixture was found as resistant to accelerated carbonation as the reference mixture containing blended cement...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports a}} {{retrospective}} criterion based audit which reviewed head injury management in two accident and emergency (A&E) departments. Management was compared with regionally agreed criteria for ordering a skull radiograph (SXR) and a computerized tomogram (CT scan) and for admission, {{and the quality}} of medical documentation was assessed. A total of 158 patients were reviewed and 132 patients (84 %) satisfied the three key areas of recommended head injury management. Failures to satisfy recommended guidelines were present in 19 patients (12 %) for SXR, four (2 %) for admission and three (2 %) for CT scanning. Three skull fractures (two in young babies) would have been missed if the criteria had been adhered to strictly. There was one adverse outcome when a patient who should have been admitted returned to A&E 8 days after initial attendance with a subdural haemorrhage and died shortly afterwards. Apart from 'loss of consciousness', the quality both in content and legibility of the medical documentation was poor. The result of 84 % correctly managed patients may be over-optimistic according to the criteria used. Although criteria have a valuable role to play, there are problems with <b>prescriptive</b> <b>standard</b> setting.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} to the 2007 conference of the International Confederation for Pluralism in Economics (ICAPE), June 1 - 3, Salt Lake City, Utah. This paper was authored by myself following consultations, and submitted collectively by the Association for Heterodox Economics, {{as a result of}} a consultation request issued by the QAA (Quality Assurance Authority) for responses to the ‘benchmark’ statement for the subject of economics. The benchmark statement seeks to define what will in future be considered the <b>prescriptive</b> <b>standard</b> for economics undergraduate teaching in the UK and in UK-certified institutions abroad. The QAA is responsible for the maintenance of academic standards in the UK and although a non-governmental body, plays a strong role in transmitting government requirements to the higher education sector. The benchmark thus represents the first attempt in UK history to regulate what is considered ‘good’ teaching in economics. It is a highly neoclassical and orthodox document and, it is argued in the AHE response, entirely lacking in a pluralist perspective. It represents an important landmark in that it sets out the consensus, among orthodox academics, of what the ‘mainstream’ consists of and how it should be taught. The paper presented at this session represents the consensus, highly critical, response of UK heterodox economists and social scientists to the QAA benchmark statement. It also contains a comparison between the economics benchmark and that proposed by other social sciences, which suggests that economics stands in an isolated position in its attempt to define its field of enquiry by means of a strict prescriptive orthodoxy.

The paper {{emphasis is on}} large scale fire tests after 1980, and origins of the standard fire test. This open access version contains grammatical fixes throughout the text as well as table headers. Structural fire testing is experiencing a renaissance. Both the research and regulatory communities are currently confronting the inherent problems associated with using simplified, single element tests on isolated structural members subjected to standard temperature-time curves to demonstrate adequate structural performance of buildings in fires. Indeed, this international symposium on “Fire Testing and Experimental Validation” {{is an indication of}} renewed interest in this area. This involves a shift in testing philosophy from <b>prescriptive</b> <b>standard</b> fire testing to large-scale non-standard fire testing using real fires. This follows more than a century during which the standard fire resistance test has been the predominant means of characterizing the response of structural elements and materials in fires. Large-scale non-standard tests performed around the world during the past three decades have identified numerous shortcomings in our understanding of real building behaviour in real fires; these could not have been observed through standard tests. However, while identifying many of these shortcomings appears as novel insight, many such insights have been well known for decades but have remained largely unaddressed due to the pervasive use of the standard fire test. Only now, with a keen interest in understanding and a willingness to change our testing, design, and regulatory approaches, can these shortcomings be addressed. This paper briefly reviews the available data and knowledge from large scale non-standard fire tests conducted in the past thirty years, and defines current gaps in knowledge and research needs for rational and holistic fire-safe structural design of buildings...|$|E
40|$|Aims to {{meet the}} {{different}} needs of the targeted audience result in the heterogeneity of media – different forms of expression and stylistic features of each media type determine {{the choice of a}} particular language code. Based on the findings of qualitative micro-sociolinguistic research carried out in 2009 - 2010, this paper aims to distinguish several salient differences of language usage in journalistic and entertainment genres of spoken media. The object of study was the elements of standard and ordinary language in spontaneous speech of two popular TV presenters. Particularly the usage of four linguistic variables was analyzed: singular model of address (pragmatic aspect), shortened grammatical forms (morphological aspect), discourse markers (discourse aspect), and colloquial lexis (lexical aspect). The results of the qualitative analysis have confirmed the hypothesis that the television presenter of an entertainment talk show would speak a code closer to ordinary Lithuanian than the presenter of a journalistic programme. However, evidence suggests that differences are more significant in terms of the usage of consciously more easily controllable variables (singular forms of address and colloquial lexis), while in terms of less conscious variables (discourse markers and shortened grammatical forms) the difference is less significant. Despite some reservations, the research has proved that the choice of a particular Lithuanian variety – ordinary or standard – to be spoken in a particular context is a deliberate decision and is highly determined by the addressee (audience of the show and interlocutor of a particular conversation) and communication objectives. Further research in this direction would contribute to debates on language simplification in public usage, especially in media, and would provide a sound basis for discussions about two emerging standards of Lithuanian – official and <b>prescriptive</b> <b>Standard</b> Lithuanian vs Common Lithuanian which is closer to everyday usage...|$|E
40|$|Descriptive {{population-based}} birthweight standards possess low sensitivity {{in detecting}} infants with growth impairment. A prescriptive birthweight standard {{based on a}} 'healthy' subpopulation without risk factors for intrauterine growth restriction might be superior. We created two birthweight standards based on live born, singleton infants with gestational age 24 - 42 weeks and born in The Netherlands between 2000 and 2007. Inclusion criteria for the prescriptive birthweight standard were restricted to infants without congenital malformations, born to healthy mothers after uncomplicated pregnancies. We defined small-for-gestational-age (SGA) as birthweight < 10 th percentile and assessed the ability of both standards to predict adverse neonatal outcomes. The prescriptive birthweight standard identified significantly more infants as SGA, up to 38. 0 % at 29 weeks gestation. SGA infants classified according to both standards {{as well as those}} classified according to the prescriptive birthweight standard only, were at increased risk of both major and minor adverse neonatal outcomes. The prescriptive birthweight standard was both more sensitive and less specific, with a maximum increase in sensitivity predicting bronchopulmonary dysplasia (+ 42. 6 %) and a maximum decrease in specificity predicting intraventricular haemorrhage (- 26. 9 %) in infants aged 28 - 31 weeks. CONCLUSION: Prescriptive birthweight standards could improve identification of infants born SGA and at risk of adverse neonatal outcomes. WHAT IS KNOWN: * Descriptive birthweight standards possess low sensitivity in detecting growth restricted infants at risk of adverse neonatal outcomes. * Prescriptive standards could improve identification of very preterm small-for-gestational-age (SGA) infants at risk of intraventricular haemorrhage.

40|$|Abstract. In {{virtually}} all safety-critical industries the operators of systems have {{to demonstrate a}} systematic and thorough consideration of safety.

In this paper we outline the development of a goal-based top-level argument for demonstrating the safety of a particular class of medical devices (medical beds). We review relevant standards both from healthcare and from other industries, and illustrate how these can inform the development of an appropriate safety argument. Finally, we discuss opportunities and challenges for the development and use of goal-based safety cases in healthcare. ...|$|R
40|$|The article {{evaluates the}} {{provisions}} concerning control of public procurement {{procedures carried out}} by the President of the Public Procurement Office in light of the current concepts of supervision in the theory of administrative law and public business law, and particularly the current regulatory supervision. The underlying reason for formulating the research problem {{was the fact that the}} supervision com petences of the President of the Public Procurement Office are linked to other legal means available to the President and that in the event of a negative outcome of such supervision a direct or indirect inﬂuence may be exerted on the legal situation of the contracting authority. The above link is responsible for subsequent activities of the central government administration authority which cannot be seen solely as an examination of the behaviour of the controlled entity for the purpose of determining compliance or lack of compliance with the <b>prescriptive</b> <b>standard</b> arising from the provisions of the Public Procurement Law. The very option of awarding an administrative monetary penalty to a contracting authority or the exclusive, as a rule, capacity of bringing an action in the common law court for invalidation of a public contract entered into in breach of the provisions of the Law allows to conclude that this sequence of legal actions may be qualiﬁed as supervision in substantive administrative law. A supervisory impact on the contracting authority in the form of legal means mentioned above becomes even more prominent when combined with a supervision performed prior to the conclusion of a public procurement contract when a correction of the result of the procurement procedure is still possible so that it is compliant with the provisions of the public procurement law. 412951225 Studia Prawa Publiczneg...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn the {{research}} project MAGS (Microseismic Activity of Geothermal Systems) a simple model {{was developed to}} determine seismic hazard as the annual frequency of the exceedance of ground motion of a certain size. Such estimates of the annual frequency of exceedance of prescriptive limits {{for the effects of}} vibrations on buildings and people are needed for the planning and licensing, but likewise for the development and operation of deep geothermal systems. For the development of the proposed model well established probabilistic seismic hazard analysis methods for the estimation of the hazard for the case of natural seismicity were adapted to the case of induced seismicity. Important differences between induced and natural seismicity had to be considered. These included significantly smaller magnitudes, depths and source to site distances of the seismic events. Hence, different ground motion prediction equations (GMPE) had to be incorporated to account for the seismic amplitude attenuation with distance, as well as for differences in the stationarity of the underlying tectonic and induced processes. Appropriate GMPEs in terms of peak ground velocity (PGV) were tested and selected from the literature. In the paper we present probabilistic seismic hazard analysis (PSHA) results for ground motion which can be linked to engineering regulations (e. g. German DIN 4150). It is thus possible to specify the probability of exceedance of <b>prescriptive</b> <b>standard</b> values and to decide (e. g. by the regulator responsible for commissioning) whether the annual number of exceedances for a site at a given level is acceptable or not. Additionally, hazard curves for induced and natural seismicity are compared to study the different impact at a site. Preliminary results for the circulation period (operation phase of the plant) at a geothermal site in Bavarian Molasse, Germany - for stiff soil, ignoring site effects - indicate higher frequencies of exceedance for induced seismicity than for natural seismicity only for low PGV values...|$|E
40|$|Background: Rapid {{development}} in neonatal care {{during the past}} years has significantly improved long-term survival of extreme preterm born (EPB) infants creating a population of children with a high frequency of disabilities. Being lighter and shorter, as compared to full-term (FT) born child, predisposes the EPB infants to intensive nutritional interventions aiming for growth-promoting effect. The existing cross-sectional preterm growth charts reflect an intrauterine growth but are used for monitoring of extra uterine growth. Long-term data on postnatal growth are sparse. The aim of this thesis was to describe the growth pattern and morbidity from birth to 10 years in hospital-based cohort of EPB infants born 1990 - 2002 in Sweden and treated at Karolinska University Hospital (KS), Neonatal Intensive Care Unit (NICU) and/or Sahlgrenska hospital (SH). Paper I covers retrospective longitudinal cohort of 162 infants born before 26 + 0 weeks of gestation. We studied body weight (Wt), height (Ht) and head circumference (HC) from birth to FT age and compared it to the new Swedish birth size reference. We showed {{that the majority of}} the infants showed a pronounced postnatal growth restriction (PGR) and at discharge from NICU, 75 % of initially appropriate for gestational age infants were below – 2 SDS for at least one of the body size variables. Paper II is a retrospective review of 114 children born before 25 + 0 weeks of gestation; we studied the frequency of ROP and visual acuity (VA). We found that 75 % of the children developed severe ROP (stage ≥ 3), often in combination with additional functional deficits as a consequence of brain dysfunction. Normal VA (> 0. 8) in at least one eye was found in 50 % of all infants, more common in girls, while visual impairment (VA < 0. 33) was more common in boys. Paper III is a retrospective longitudinal study of 123 children born before 26 + 0 weeks of gestation; morbidity and body Wt, Ht, HC from FT to 10 years were studied comparing with the Swedish growth reference. We showed that a significant catch up (CU) in Ht and Wt occured; by age 10 years the attained mean Ht was in accordance with the genetic potential. Significant cognitive, motor disorder and/ or developmental comorbidity were found in 48 % boys and 34 % girls and severe ROP in 79 % and 66 % respectively. In Paper IV, we studied the magnitude of catch-up (CU) growth 10 years after FT age and its impact for attained Ht and Wt during childhood in the cohort from Paper III. We showed that the most pronounced CU growth in both Wt and Ht occurred during the first year after FT age; followed by a plateau between 1 and 2 years but with more pronounced Wt than Ht development, a trend that continued until 10 years. Children with rapid CU in Wt three months after FT age were significantly heavier and taller at 1 and 2 years but not taller at 10 years compared to children with slower growth tempo. In summary, this thesis demonstrates that EPB infants show a continuous PGR in Wt, Ht and HC as compared to birth size references. Neither the birth-size derived growth curves nor the presented charts are supposed to be used as a single <b>prescriptive</b> <b>standard</b> for extra uterine growth of this population. By 10 years of age the majority of children had reached normal or near-normal Ht close to their genetic potential but Wt development was higher than Ht development, possibly leading to a disadvantageous metabolic situation. EPB infants, especially boys are at high risk for visual impairment and therefore rehabilitation of these children with a combination of disabilities is a challenge. The most challenging period is between birth and FT, which may be a critical window for development of the central nervous system...|$|E

Humans are essential in any large and complex system, but their complexity makes it virtually impossible to fully predict their behaviour and impact on such systems. Safety standards should be an aid to handle such complexity in a safe, efficient and effective manner. Standards adapt several strategies, such as prescriptive or goal-based and process or product focus, to utilize advantages and manage challenges related to humans as parts of safety-critical and safety-related systems. A survey of selected HSE standards used in the Norwegian petroleum industry revealed that the standards differ in how goal-based or prescriptive and how process- or product-oriented they are and recent standards were not more goal-based than older ones. Studies of the application of ISO 11064 revealed that the standard is well appreciated measured by the opinion of its users. However, many users of the standard also {{found it to be}} too comprehensive to be used efficiently and effectively. Also, the application of the standard must be adapted to each project. Studies of the partly prescriptive CRIOP methodology revealed that it is well appreciated measured by the opinion of its users, but CRIOP also requires adaptation in its application to be effective and efficient in use. Even strictly prescriptive standards are adapted in their application to real world problems. An analysis of the application of the <b>prescriptive</b> <b>standard</b> ON-S 1 in Australian rail occurrence reporting revealed that the introduction of this standard significantly increased the number of reported serious injuries. This was due to a mismatch between a prescriptive requirement and the corresponding application. Human operators as users of safety-related and safety-critical systems must make correct decisions and safe actions to avoid accidents. One reason for applying HF safety standards is to help operators achieve that goal. However, according to existing literature, human error is a causal or contributing factor in 60 - 90 percent of accidents and incidents. The validity of these figures will be discussed in the thesis. An adaptation of the Human Factors Assessment and Classification System (HFACS) for use in the Oil & Gas industry revealed that latent failures on the organizational level were the most common error type. The thesis suggests applying a safety case-based approach to model requirements and recommendations in standards {{to bridge the gap between}} goal-based and prescriptive perspectives in standards. There appears to be a gap between requirements and recommendations in standards, the way standards are actually applied and the way compliance to the standards is demonstrated. Since many systems contain legacy systems, reused components or COTS (Commercial off the Shelf), a retrospective safety case can be produced to integrate such system parts in an overall case. Modelling templates or patterns for standards can make standards easier to read, understand and use. Such an approach can also provide means for reuse, by reusing known safety argument structures and combinations of evidence. The thesis focuses primarily on industrial application of standards, but the knowledge provided can be valuable input to the drafting of standards as well. Also, regulators can use such an approach by comparing system safety models to libraries of patterns or models to identify deviations from known solutions that might require further analysis for approval. Efficient and effective comparison of system solutions to best practice patterns or models will however require a more formal notation of the argument structure than what is available today. One solution to this could be to further develop the Goal Structuring Notation (GSN) into a more formal notation, or even integrate GSN with UML. The thesis is a collection of scientific papers and outlines considerations on how Human Factors can be handled from a standardization perspective. The following Research Questions (RQs) were identified: RQ 1 : How are HF standards and methodologies applied in an industrial setting? RQ 2 : How are HF-related occurrences reported and categorized? RQ 3 : Can a safety case-based approach contribute to bridging the gap between goal-based and prescriptive standards? The main contributions (C) presented in the thesis are: C 1 : Identification of development trends for standards and definition of a framework for classifying standards C 2 : Description of the industrial use of a HF standard and a related methodology in the Norwegian O&G industry C 3 : Identification of challenges when standardizing incident reporting C 4 : Experiences with and guidance for retrospective assurance/safety cases and modelling standards The thesis provides insight into the application of selected HF standards in the Norwegian Oil & Gas industry and it provides one suggestion to how models can be used to bridge the gap between goal-based and prescriptive standards. This knowledge might also be used as guidance to the development and application of future safety standards in general and HF safety standards in particular.

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the methods used}} to update the nonresidential fenestration requirements for the 2001 California Energy Efficiency Standards for Nonresidential and High-Rise Residential Buildings (standards). Before the 2001 changes, the standards allowed metal frames with single tinted glass along the coast and double tinted glass inland. With the changes, high performance fenestration is required by the <b>prescriptive</b> <b>standards</b> throughout California 1. The changes were implemented through an emergency rulemaking mandated by Assembly Bill 970 (Statutes of 2000). California law requires that the standards be cost effective when amortized over the building life. A rigorous life-cycle cost procedure considered the cost of modern fenestration technologies, associated energy savings, views, and typical glass area in buildings. The procedure is summarized below: � � Identify the candidate fenestration products {{that may be used}} in vertical and horizontal applications, and collect data on their performance characteristics and cost. � � Develop an energy model that assesses the relative performance of candidat...|$|R

It consists {{of a series of}} indicators designed to support prediction of listener preference of one podcast over another, given that both carry comparable informational content. The indicators are grouped into four categories pertaining to the Podcast Content, the Podcaster, the Podcast Context or the Technical Execution of the podcast. We adopt the term "cred" as a designation encompassing both credibility (comprising trustworthiness and expertise) and qualitative acceptability to listeners. Our podcast analysis {{framework is}} inspired by work on credibility in blogs, another medium dominated by user generated content. The PodCred framework is derived from {{a review of the literature}} on credibility for other media, a survey of <b>prescriptive</b> <b>standards</b> for podcasting, and a detailed data analysis of award winning podcasts. The paper concludes with a discussion of future work in which the framework will be applied...|$|R
5000|$|A {{carbon tax}} {{is a form}} of {{pollution}} tax (although carbon dioxide is naturally occuring). Pollution taxes are often grouped with two other economic policy instruments: tradable pollution permits/credits and subsidies. These three environmental economic policy instruments are built upon a foundation of a command and control regulation. The difference is that classic command-penalty regulations stipulate, through performance or <b>prescriptive</b> <b>standards,</b> what each polluter is required to do to be in compliance with the law. Command and control regulation is not considered an economic instrument as it is typically enforced by narrower means such as stop or control order, though it may include an administrative monetary penalty in site-specific regulations. The instrumental distinction between a tax and a command-and-control regulation is determined by the enacted legislative names, and whether they contain [...] "tax" [...] as a defined term within the Act, for example British Columbia's Carbon Tax Act versus Alberta's Specified Gas Emitters Regulation, Alta Reg 139/2007 ...|$|R
40|$|A {{comprehensive}} set {{of fully}} integrated anthropometric measures {{is needed to}} evaluate human growth from conception to infancy so that consistent judgments can be made about the appropriateness of fetal and infant growth. At present, there are 2 barriers to this strategy. First, descriptive reference charts, which are derived from local, unselected samples with inadequate methods and poor characterization of their putatively healthy populations, commonly are used rather than <b>prescriptive</b> <b>standards.</b> The use of <b>prescriptive</b> <b>standards</b> is justified by the extensive biologic, genetic, and epidemiologic evidence that skeletal growth is similar from conception to childhood across geographic populations, when health, nutrition, environmental, and health care needs are met. Second, clinicians currently screen fetuses, newborn infants, and infants {{at all levels of}} care {{with a wide range of}} charts and cutoff points, often with limited appreciation of the underlying population or quality of the study that generated the charts. Adding to the confusion, infants are evaluated after birth with a single prescriptive tool: the World Health Organization Child Growth Standards, which were derived from healthy, breastfed newborn infants, infants, and young children from populations that have been exposed to few growth-restricting factors. The International Fetal and Newborn Growth Consortium for the 21 st Century Project addressed these issues by providing international standards for gestational age estimation, first-trimester fetal size, fetal growth, newborn size for gestational age, and postnatal growth of preterm infants, all of which complement the World Health Organization Child Growth Standards conceptually, methodologically, and analytically. Hence, growth and development can now, for the first time, be monitored globally across the vital first 1000 days and all the way to 5 years of age. It is clear that an integrative approach to monitoring growth and development from pregnancy to school age is desirable, scientifically supported, and likely to improve care, referral patterns, and reporting systems. Such integration can be achieved only through the use of international growth standards, especially in increasingly diverse, mixed ancestry populations. Resistance to new scientific developments has been hugely problematic in medicine; however, we are confident that the obstetric and neonatal communities will join their pediatric colleagues worldwide in the adoption of this integrative strategy...|$|R
