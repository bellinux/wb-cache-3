40|$|The use {{of genetic}} data to {{reconstruct}} the transmission tree of infectious disease epidemics and outbreaks {{has been the subject}} of an increasing number of studies, but previous approaches have usually either made assumptions that are not fully compatible with phylogenetic inference, or, where they have based inference on a phylogeny, have employed a procedure that requires this tree to be fixed. At the same time, the coalescent-based models of the pathogen population that are employed in the methods usually used for time-resolved phylogeny reconstruction are a considerable simplification of epidemic process, as they assume that pathogen lineages mix freely. Here, we contribute a new method that is simultaneously a phylogeny reconstruction method for isolates taken from an epidemic, and a <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>transmission</b> tree reconstruction. We observe that, if one or more samples is taken from each host in an epidemic or outbreak and these are used to build a phylogeny, a transmission tree is equivalent to a partition of the set of nodes of this phylogeny, such that each partition element is a set of nodes that is connected in the full tree and contains all the tips corresponding to samples taken from one and only one host. We then implement a Monte Carlo Markov Chain (MCMC) procedure for simultaneous sampling from the spaces of both trees, utilising a newly-designed set of phylogenetic tree proposals that also respect node partitions. We calculate the posterior probability of these partitioned trees based on a model that acknowledges the population structure of an epidemic by employing an individual-based disease transmission model and a coalescent process taking place within each host. We demonstrate our method, first using simulated data, and then with sequences taken from the H 7 N 7 avian influenza outbreak that occurred in the Netherlands in 2003. We show that it is superior to established coalescent methods for reconstructing the topology and node heights of the phylogeny and performs well for transmission tree reconstruction when the phylogeny is well-resolved by the genetic data, but caution that this will often not be the case in practice and that existing genetic and epidemiological data should be used to configure such analyses whenever possible. This method is available for use by the research community as part of BEAST, one of the most widely-used packages for reconstruction of dated phylogenies...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Hawaii at Manoa, 1982. Bibliography: leaves 188 - 191. Microfiche. xi, 191 leaves, bound ill. 29 cmAutomatic-repeat-request (ARQ) {{systems have}} been the most popular means for error control in digital {{transmission}} systems. They provide a relatively simple and highly reliable means for eliminating transmission errors. However, the throughput of an ARQ system may deteriorate badly with increasing bit-error rates especially if there are significant transmission delays such as experienced in satellite or long terrestrial circuits. This dissertation first proposes a class of mixed-mode protocols which incorporate a selective-repeat mode of retransmission. This is combined with a secondary mode to prevent receiver buffer overflow. The throughput analysis for these schemes is presented and shows that they can significantly outperform the conventional Go-Back-N <b>procedure</b> <b>for</b> <b>transmission</b> over circuits with delay. The analysis also shows how throughput is related to the size of buffer provided at the receiver. It is also demonstrated that the choice of secondary retransmission mode does not {{have a significant effect on}} the throughput but has a bearing on complexity. Further improvement in performance may be achieved by use of a hybrid ARQ system incorporating forward-error correction as well as retransmission. The dissertation considers some parity-retransmission schemes in which blocks of parity bits are used for retransmissions rather than repetition of the original information block. This enables the system to adaptively incorporate error correction as well as detection when channel bit-error rates increase. An analysis procedure is presented which permits comparison of throughput efficiency for a variety of ARQ retransmission protocols and forward-error correction codes. Particular attention is focused on the use of half-rate convolutional codes for error correction. A trellis algorithm is shown to be useful for computation of the error correction capability of modestly powerful convolutional codes with sliding-block feedback decoding. An alternative approach using combinatorial procedures is also presented. New rate one-half codes are found which are related to optimum orthogonalizable rate one-third codes. These related code pairs can be used in parity-retransmission schemes to provide more powerful error correction when channel bit-error rates deteriorate badly. Finally the throughput and reliability performance of the hybrid schemes is outlined for various combinations of retransmission protocols and error-correction systems. Results are presented for convolutional codes and block codes and indicate the possible tradeoffs between complexity and performance. It is concluded that convolutional codes with relatively simple sliding-block decoding can ensure high throughput is maintained on a hybrid ARQ system despite significant bit-error rates and transmission delays...|$|E

40|$|A {{study of}} the flow of {{information}} about organizational problems was conducted. We found tbat managers often avoided passing problems to formally designated problem solvers and used personal ties to forward information to problem solvers. Tbe strengtb of ties between individu-als bad a weak effect on passing problems across professional bound-aries. Researchers using an information-processing paradigm of organiza-tional design have argued that managers should design structures and pro-cedures to funnel the flow of information about organizational problems to appropriate decision makers (Galbraith, 1977; Nadler & Tushman, 1988). To prevent an organization from being overwhelmed with too much informa-tion, formalized procedures are created to channel information to decision makers, and specialized boundary spanners are appointed to {{play a key role in}} transmitting information across the organization (Aldrich & Herker, 1977). But information processing theorists have seldom considered what happens once the procedures are in place.
