In an area outside the nurse cells, in some cases, the <b>plating</b> <b>efficiency</b> tended to be much higher in combinations with cells from a heterologous source as compared with those from a homologous source. Moreover, {{in the same area}} with some combinations the <b>plating</b> <b>efficiency</b> decreased when cell density was lowered, while with other combinations this phenomenon did not occur. This decrease was independent of the absolute value of <b>plating</b> <b>efficiency.</b> In experiments in which the concentration of conditioning factors was presumably changed, {{no significant difference in the}} <b>plating</b> <b>efficiency</b> was noticed. We therefore suggest that different <b>plating</b> <b>efficiencies</b> observed with heterologous nurse cells were not due to a higher level of conditioning factors, but rather to the production of different types of conditioning factors that are presumably degraded with different efficiency...|$|R
40|$|This lab {{reported}} previously {{that the}} <b>plating</b> <b>efficiency</b> of a {{herpes simplex virus}} type 1 ICP 0 -null mutant was enhanced upon release from an isoleucine block which synchronizes cells to G 1 phase (W. Cai and P. A. Schaffer, J. Virol. 65 : 4078 - 4090, 1991). Peak <b>plating</b> <b>efficiency</b> occurred as cells cycled out of G 1 and into S phase, suggesting that the enhanced <b>plating</b> <b>efficiency</b> was due to cellular activities present in late G 1 /early S phase. We have found, however, that the enhanced <b>plating</b> <b>efficiency</b> did not occur when cells were synchronized by alternative methods. We now report that the <b>plating</b> <b>efficiency</b> of ICP 0 − viruses is not enhanced at a particular stage of the cell cycle but rather is enhanced by specific cellular stresses.

30|$|We have {{evaluated}} {{the performance of}} an HPLC method {{for the analysis of}} antioxidants with enhanced detection via post-column derivatization using CUPRAC employing three columns–two types of support matrices (porous silica and the core shell) and two types of stationary phases with the same support matrix (core shell, C 18, and phenyl-hexyl stationary phases). Broad peaks were observed for all three columns which are a consequence of extra-column volume, but there was significantly less broadening in the core-shell column data. Theoretical considerations support the notion that the core-shell column would perform better than the porous silica column by virtue of the A and B terms in the van Deemter equation while the C term is negligible due to the small molecular sizes of the antioxidants. The C 18 core-shell column exhibited sharper peaks with higher <b>plate</b> <b>efficiency</b> compared to the C 18 porous silica column with shorter retention times. Among the two core-shell columns, the phenyl-hexyl column had better resolving power for the aromatic analytes which is predictable for its phenyl group. The separation and analysis of antioxidants in real samples–as demonstrated here using five brands of tea–can also benefit from the use of core-shell columns as it provides better and quicker separation (i.e., shorter retention times) compared to porous silica. While the linear regression, detection sensitivity, and detection limits are comparable for all three columns in this CUPRAC post-column derivatization approach, the characteristically shorter analyte retention times observed for the core-shell columns could be advantageous in achieving higher analysis throughput without sacrificing analytical sensitivity.|$|E

A transient mathematical model is presented for the pond. The energy-balance equations for {{various parts of}} the pond are solved analytically using the elimination technique. In order to validate the theoretical model, experiments are performed under the batch mode of heat extraction with a black painted baffle plate made of stainless steel, with and without vents in the plate, for different masses of water in the upper and lower layers. It is found that the pond-water temperature decreases with increasing vent area; therefore, the baffle plate should be used without vents with shallow depths of the upper water-layer. Experiments have also been carried out using baffle plates made from Al and mica in order to study the effect of the thermal conductivity of the baffle plate on the pond's performance. The average temperature of the pond water is found to be less dependent on the thermal conductivity of the baffle plate. It is also inferred that the present system could provide 88 L of hot water at a maximum temperature of 71 Â°C at 3 : 00 pm with a daily efficiency of 64. 3 % when the baffle plate is used without vents. The pond can retain hot water until 7 : 00 am of the next day at a temperature of 43 Â°C, which can be used for most domestic applications.

The developed HPTLC-visible method of artemisinin determination will be very useful for pharmaceutical industries, which are involved in monitoring of artemisinin content during different growth stages (in vitro and in vivo) of A. annua for qualitative and quantitative assessment of final produce prior to commercial-scale processing for assessment of cost-benefit ratio...|$|E
40|$|Silver {{nanoparticles}} (AgNPs) {{are useful}} {{to a wide}} range of consumer's and medical products, due to their antimicrobial and anti-inflammatory activities. AgNPs have been used to prevent the microbial colonization, therefore decreasing the risk of infection, on implantable devices, tumor prostheses, bone cement and surgical instruments. However, the putative toxicity of AgNPs to bone cells is still poorly understood. Therefore, this study aimed to contribute to enlighten the role of ionic silver release of small sized NPs on the biological outcomes of bone cells, in particular to what concerns to induction of cytotoxic and genotoxic effects. To achieve that goal osteoblast-like MG- 63 cells were exposed to well characterized PVP coated AgNPs of two different primary sizes (10 nm and 20 nm) and evaluated after 24 and 48 h. Our results showed that, the smaller sized AgNPs (10 nm) are more reactive and prone to form large aggregates, being therefore mandatory to provide a careful characterization of the particles, before the toxicity assessment. We also demonstrate that for short period exposures (up to 48 h) ionic silver (from AgNO 3) is more toxic than the corresponding dose of AgNP. However, when assessing longer term exposures by the clonogenic assay, we demonstrated the inverse effect, the AgNPs turn out being more toxic, completely inhibiting <b>plate</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Therefore, AgNPs toxicity cannot be attributed to the dissociated Ag(+) alone. Also, when comparing size-dependent effects, we demonstrate that AgNP 20 were found to induce a cell cycle arrest at G 0 /G 1 and apoptosis, while AgNP 10 did not induce a cytostatic effect, but rather induced necrosis. Finally, combining the chemical and toxicological profiles of both AgNP sizes, we hypothesize that the size dependent AgNP toxicity may be associated in part with the NPs interference with the cell membranes and consequent uptake/adsorption processes. status: publishe...|$|E

When various numbers of cells were plated in agar at the same concentration under both standard and micromethod conditions, their <b>plating</b> <b>efficiency</b> remained constant. In contrast, the cell dose—response curves obtained in microculture supported previous observations that <b>plating</b> <b>efficiency</b> increases with cell concentration up to an optimum level. The mathematical analysis of these curves provided further indication that T-cell colony formation involved interactions between a colony progenitor cell (TCFC) {{and at least two}} populations of co-operating cells (CC). Pooled cells from primary colonies, which still contained TCFC but were usually depleted of CC, generated secondary colonies when transferred in subculture, provided medium conditioned by CC was added to the cultures. Under these conditions, the <b>plating</b> <b>efficiency</b> remained constant with increasing numbers of cells plated and thus, the number of colonies obtained was found to be strictly proportional to the number of cells plated. In addition, CC persisting occasionally in primary colonies could be detected by (a) their ability to generate secondary colonies in the absence of CC conditioned medium and (b) a modification of the dose—response curves obtained toward increasing <b>plating</b> <b>efficiency</b> with the number of cells seeded.
