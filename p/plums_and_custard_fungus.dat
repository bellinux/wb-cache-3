50|$|The {{woodland}} is a monocultural {{stand of}} mature conifers - especially larch. Although the dense shade and extensive litter layer of needles and branches have completely suppressed the pre-plantation flora, the mature {{stand of trees}} has allowed a significant growth of various species of fungi; in particular the wood provides a habitat for Spotted Toughshank (Rhodocollybia maculata), <b>Plums</b> <b>and</b> <b>Custard</b> (Tricholomopsis rutilans) <b>and</b> Clouded Agaric (Clitocybe nebularis).|$|R

The stipe (stem) is cylindrical {{and up to}} 10 cm (4 in) tall with a red scaly base developing to a yellow colour towards the cap. It has no ring or volva.|$|R
50|$|The {{reservoirs}} {{are surrounded}} by the Wyming Brook Nature Reserve {{which is part of}} the Eastern Peak District Moors Site of Special Scientific Interest. Wildlife in the reserve includes northern spinach and common lutestring moths as well as a host of birds both on and off the water. These include crossbill, white-throated dipper, mallard, coot, moorhen and grey heron; occasional visitors include cormorant, Canada goose and osprey. The flora around the reservoirs consist mostly of deciduous and evergreen woodland; in autumn many species of fungi are on display including Jew‘s ear, <b>plums</b> <b>and</b> <b>custard</b> <b>and</b> amethyst deceiver. In recent years Yorkshire Water have conducted trials on releasing different volumes of water from the Lower reservoir and monitoring the effects on the River Rivelin. This has resulted in being able to create better conditions for brown trout spawning and an increase in the population of bullhead.|$|R

The GI and GL were determined according to the Food and Agriculture Organization protocol. The GL was calculated taking into consideration intake recommendation guidelines; 77. 8 % of the fruits had low GI although significant oscillations were observed in some graphs, which may indicate potential risks of disease. Coconut water <b>and</b> <b>custard</b> apple had a moderate GI, and all fruits had low GL. The fruits evaluated are healthy and can be consumed following the daily recommended amount. However, caution is recommended with fruits causing early glycemic peak and the fruits with moderated GI (coconut water <b>and</b> <b>custard</b> apple) ...|$|R
