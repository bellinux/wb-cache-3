2500|$|Late in 2010, Nina {{revealed}} {{that she was}} recording a studio album set for release in mid-January 2011. It was originally set {{to be the first}} of her two-album recording deal with her new label, Universal Records. After a couple of push-backs, Stay Alive was finally released on November 19, 2011. In choosing such title for the album, she explained, [...] "It's like some <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying</b> <b>that</b> I'm gone [...] So I’m here to say that I’m still here and staying alive." [...] She called the album [...] "special" [...] {{due to the fact that}} she contributed from its musical production to the cover art design." [...] Stay Alive was a universal acclaim, being called [...] "futuristic and edgy" [...] by critics who also predicted that it [...] "may set new trends in Filipino music," [...] tagging Nina as the new [...] "dance diva." [...] Philippine Entertainment Portal praised the album, stating [...] "Stay Alive is a testament to Nina's evolution as an artist and determination to be a better performer." [...] "Dance" [...] was released on October 6, 2011 as the lead single from the album. Nina explained, [...] "The carrier single is a dance song for it to be different from my previous albums." [...] The song is described as [...] "an upbeat track with a catchy melody." [...] Its music video was released on December 9, and features Nina in Gaga-ish costumes while performing a dance routine. Due to lack of promotion, the song failed to achieve commercial success. On January 30, 2012, [...] "However Much Love" [...] was released as a radio-only pre-Valentine single. The song was critically acclaimed, being called a [...] "standout" [...] by Abby Mendoza of Philippine Entertainment Portal. It also performed well commercially, becoming Nina's first chart-topper since 2008. On February 13, she staged a pre-Valentine concert entitled Update Your Status... at the Music Museum, which supported the album. In the same month, she expressed disappointment with the album's lack of promotion, saying [...] " [...] always have a meeting, but no actions are initiated. They give us schedules that are not really followed. When it's already okay, then they cancel it." [...] On April 14, she staged another concert at the Music Museum, entitled Timeless: Tribute to a Diva, which was dedicated to late pop diva Whitney Houston. [...] "Believe in the Dream" [...] was released on April 24, 2012 as the third single from Stay Alive, accompanied by a lyric video.|$|E

Carl was laid up sick and so was Aunt Martha, so they couldn't put us right. We went to Sunday School in all that rain on Saturday and nobody came. And then we thought we'd clean house on Monday and stop old cats from talking about how dirty the manse was"--general sensation all over the church--"and we did. I shook the rugs in the Methodist graveyard because it was such a convenient place and not because I meant to be disrespectful of the dead. It isn't the dead folks who have made the fuss over this--it's the living folks. And it isn't right for any of you to blame my father for this, because he was away and didn't know, and anyhow we thought it was Monday. He's just the best father that ever lived in the world and we love him with all our hearts." ...|$|E

5000|$|One verse was not {{included}} in the first publication: Colum soon realised that he had not put in the poem the fact that the woman had died before the marriage, and so he wrote the verse that begins: [...] "The <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>saying,</b> <b>that</b> no two <b>were</b> e'er wed, but one had a sorrow that never was said ..."
