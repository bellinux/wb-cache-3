40|$|One of {{the most}} complex legal issues arises in the {{international}} maritime carriage of goods. The reason of this {{can be found in the}} variety of relations in the field and in the different nature of the sources of its legal regulation including the rules of the international conventions and domestic law. Furthermore, people have entered into the period of globalization and the gradual integration worldwide. This shows the importance of such kind of process in the international maritime law as unification of the legal regulation of the practice in the field which has more than a hundred year s history. In that sense, among the first ones was traditionally international sphere of merchant shipping and its central legal element such as the contract of international carriage of goods by sea. Its significance is supported by the fact that it is a legal ground for the cooperation of the shipper and the carrier as the parties in the transport of cargo which is the base for the economic use of the oceans and seas as a uniform transport route opened for all states in the world. A special place in the international maritime law belongs to the sea carrier's liability for the goods. It most clearly expresses the essence of the contract of carriage by sea and its importance. Moreover, the value of the carrier's cargo liability is in its major role to ensure accurate and precise fulfillment of mutual obligations of the parties in the transport of goods. The importance of this legal phenomenon is that it is the closest one to the legal practice because in almost any litigation or dispute we are faced with the question of liability. This statement is fully applicable to the practice of merchant shipping. The interaction between international and national legal regulation in the field of cargo liability of the sea carrier in the international maritime law reflects general relations and mutual influence that exists between international and domestic law as separate and at the same time close systems. One of the objectives of the issue of the <b>carrier</b> <b>s</b> cargo <b>liability</b> in the international and domestic maritime law is to bring the provisions of national law of the states to uniformity with the international legal framework. The limitation of the sea <b>carrier</b> <b>s</b> cargo <b>liability</b> is a universal principle that influences all legal elements in the international maritime law. One of the characteristics of the merchant shipping is the concentration of often significant property values on a single hull. Hereby, the limitation of the sea <b>carrier</b> <b>s</b> cargo <b>liability</b> made the insurance of maritime risks possible and its conditions reasonable for the shipowners which led to the development of the shipping business. Maritime transport of goods plays an important role in the world s economy. According to IMO more than 90 % of global turnover is carried by maritime transport. Thus, large volumes of goods transported by sea as well as the risks and dangers at sea cause continuous discussions on the issues of the <b>carrier</b> <b>s</b> <b>liability</b> and its limitation in the international maritime transport of cargo. Safe carriage of goods is the main purpose of the contracts in the field. From the middle of the twentieth century one of the leading role in the unification of the international maritime law and preparation of the International Maritime Conventions belongs to the UN organizations such as the International Maritime Organization (IMO), the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) and the United Nations Commission on International Trade Law (UNCITRAL). Therefore, the analysis of the legal approach in the regulation of the <b>carrier</b> <b>s</b> <b>liability</b> and its limitation under International Maritime Conventions is particularly important. Nowadays there are several international legal regimes of the <b>carrier</b> <b>s</b> <b>liability</b> and its limitation in the international maritime transport of cargo with their own features and characteristics. Thus, the issue is relevant to be studied and analyzed in a complex and comprehensive way. For these purposes some questions in the field are of significant importance such as the nature of contract of the international carriage of goods by sea, the development and current state of the international legislation regulating the issue, main responsibilities of the carrier towards the cargo and the period of <b>carrier</b> <b>s</b> responsibility, the essence of the carrier's liability for the cargo and the development and current state of the legal phenomenon of the limitation of <b>carrier</b> <b>s</b> cargo <b>liability.</b> Hereby, the objective of the thesis is to examine the legal phenomenon of the <b>carrier</b> <b>s</b> <b>liability</b> and its limitation in the international maritime carriage of cargo under International Maritime Conventions. Different sources are used in the thesis including international treaties and national legislation, case law and judgments, books and articles, official publications and Internet resources. The main part of the thesis is structured in four chapters according to the main international maritime legal frameworks regulating the examined issue and including the concept of the limitation of the sea <b>carrier</b> <b>s</b> cargo <b>liability.</b> In the chapters the historical part, the analysis of the sources of law and their legal comparison are given, which are followed by the appropriate conclusions...|$|R
40|$|The {{industry}} of shipping reaches {{far back in}} time but the traditional view with a shipowner offering his services is a mere memory. Developing from one actor offering all services more and more players have taken a role in shipping and the new industry {{that we have seen}} develop over the last 150 years consists of several parties carrying out different functions. Someone does of course own the ship but this is no longer equal to being the party carrying out the transport. More likely, the shipowner is only a name on a paper unaware of the actual shipping involvements on a specific level. Irrespective of which one of these two extremes we are faced with one thing is sure; the functions relevant for shipping today differ from the traditional arrangements. A changing industry requires new tools in order to function efficiently. This concerns everything from communication, financial setups to legal solutions that are in line with the structure we see today. In this thesis the focus is on how the legal solutions can help the market or the industry to work as efficiently as possible and in order to do so {{it is important that the}} content is desirable seen from a practical perspective. Furthermore it is important that the desirable position is unambiguously expressed. This will be the main focus in the following discussion. Concerning trade in bulk, chartering is the reality of today. A carrier enters into a chartering agreement with a charterer. This chartering agreement can be based on transport between destinations, on a specific time or on another basis the parties find appropriate to fulfil their requirements. The point being that there are many different ways to organize your trade today but common to all of them is that they will in almost every case start with a charter party. There are numerous interesting legal issues in regard of charter parties and in this thesis only one of them will be assessed. This is the question of liability. When we have a chain of charter party relationships governed by different terms and transport document between the charterer and a receiver in the end, it follows from the very nature of these contractual relationships that the issue of liability is central and complex. Who are the liable parties in this structure? The starting point for chartering is that this is an area of freedom of contract. The rational for this being that the parties involved are professionals with insight in the industry. With this said the position evaluated in this thesis is the legal position under the maritime code. Apart from the contracts this is the main legal source and it supplements all different contracts when they are silent or unclear. Furthermore it stipulates mandatory rules for some transport. The liability under the maritime code concerning charter parties is regulated in chapter 14. Either the liability derives from the charter party or from a tramp bill of lading. These are the two main documents governing this kind of transport. The carrier can be liable as contractual carrier or as performing carrier depending on whether or not the relationship to the contractual party is directly contractual or based on performance. When the document governing the transport of goods is a charter party the liability of the carrier concerning damaged or delayed goods is regulated in section 347 and section 383. The rules relating to charter parties are materially the same for both time- and voyage chartering in the code. In the first subparagraph the <b>carrier</b> <b>s</b> <b>liability</b> towards the charterer is regulated. The carrier is defined as the person who, through a contract, charters out a ship to another (the charterer). If the performing carrier is someone else than the carrier this party is caught by the reference to section 286 made in section 347 and 383 first subparagraph second sentence. The effect of the first section is in conclusion that the charterer has a claim for damaged or delayed cargo towards the carrier and the performing carrier, if this is not the same party. In the second subparagraph the <b>carrier</b> <b>s</b> and the performing <b>carrier</b> <b>s</b> <b>liability</b> towards a receiver who is not the charterer is regu-lated. When we have a bill of lading issued under a charter party, a tramp bill of lading, and this is endorsed to someone else than the charterer, this party s rights towards the issuer follow from the bill of lading. This is stipulated in section 325 in the maritime code. In order to establish the liability under a tramp bill of lading there are two main questions that has to be answered. First, when the carrier is bound by a tramp bill of lading. In this concern it is the distinction from liner trade that is important as the rules of presumption might result in different parties being bound by the master s signature. The evaluation depends on whether it is liner trade or chartering. Secondly, it is a question about the consequences when the carrier is bound. Or expressed in another way, the substance of the liability. In this thesis these rules will be evaluated from a practical basis according to the commercial patterns in the shipping industry. Who is the carrier under different aspects and more importantly, is the legal position of today also the desirable one seen from a practical perspective? By this I mean that if eth liability following from statute is in line with the structure we see under different charter parties. Is it reasonable that the targeted party under the code is held liable when looking at the contractual or actual functions undertaken...|$|R

Part II describes recent proposals {{to resolve the issue}} of liability limits, including the IATA Intercarrier Agreement, the DOT 2 ̆ 7 s proposed conditions to the IATA Intercarrier Agreement, the EC Proposal on air carrier liability, and the ICAO 2 ̆ 7 s draft of a new international convention.
