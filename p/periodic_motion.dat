The theory of discontinuous dynamical systems is employed to determine the grazing motions in such a system, and the mapping technique is used to develop the mapping structures of <b>periodic</b> <b>motions.</b> The <b>periodic</b> <b>motions</b> and stability are predicted analytically and verified numerically. The stability and bifurcation analyses of such <b>periodic</b> <b>motions</b> are performed, and the parameters for all possible motions are developed. This model is applicable for the semi-active suspension system with the magneto-rheological damper in automobiles. Further investigation of magneto-rheological damping with full nonlinearity should be completed.

40|$|The {{galloping}} vibrations of {{a single}} transmission cable that may vibrate transversely and torsionally has been investigated via a two-degree-of-freedom oscillator. The analytical solutions of <b>periodic</b> <b>motions</b> for this two-degree-of-freedom system are represented by the finite Fourier series. The analytical bifurcation trees of <b>periodic</b> <b>motions</b> to chaos of a transmission line under both steady and unsteady flows are discussed from the generalized harmonic balance method. The analytical solutions for stable and unstable <b>periodic</b> <b>motions</b> in such a two degree-of-freedom system are achieved, and the corresponding stability and bifurcation was discussed. The limit cycle for the linear cable structure are obtained by gradually decreasing the sinusoidal excitation amplitude. In addition, the numerical simulations of stable and unstable <b>periodic</b> <b>motions</b> are illustrated. The rich dynamical behavior in such a nonlinear cable structure are discovered, and this investigation may help one better understand the galloping phenomena for any elastic structures...|$|R
40|$|The {{equations}} of {{the restricted}} three-body problem describe {{the motion of}} a massless particle {{under the influence of}} two primaries of masses 1 − µ and µ, 0 ≤ µ ≤ 1 / 2, that circle each other with period equal to 2 π. When µ = 0, the problem admits orbits for the massless particle that are ellipses of eccentricity e with the primary of mass 1 located at one of the focii. If the period is a rational multiple of 2 π, denoted 2 πp/q, some of these orbits perturb to <b>periodic</b> <b>motions</b> for µ> 0. For typical values of e and p/q, two resonant <b>periodic</b> <b>motions</b> are obtained for µ> 0. We show that the characteristic multipliers of both these motions are given by expressions of the form 1 ± √ C(e, p, q) µ + O(µ) in the limit µ → 0. The coefficient C(e, p, q) is analytic in e at e = 0 and C(e, p, q) = O(e |p−q |). The coefficients in front of e |p−q |, obtained when C(e, p, q) is expanded in powers of e for the two resonant <b>periodic</b> <b>motions,</b> sum to zero. Typically, if one of the two resonant <b>periodic</b> <b>motions</b> is of elliptic type the other is of hyperbolic type.

40|$|This {{book for}} the first time {{examines}} <b>periodic</b> <b>motions</b> to chaos in time-delay systems, which exist extensively in engineering. For a long time, the stability of time-delay systems at equilibrium has been of great interest from the Lyapunov theory-based methods, where one cannot achieve the ideal results. Thus, time-delay discretization in time-delay systems was used for the stability of these systems. In this volume, Dr. Luo presents an accurate method based on the finite Fourier series to determine <b>periodic</b> <b>motions</b> in nonlinear time-delay systems. The stability and bifurcation of <b>periodic</b> <b>motions</b> are determined by the time-delayed system of coefficients in the Fourier series and the method for nonlinear time-delay systems is equivalent to the Laplace transformation method for linear time-delay systems.
