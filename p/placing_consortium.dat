Boxer DTT confirmed this http://www.boxer.se/?page=1365 on their website and wished the BCI well in reaching DTT objectives. Following One Vision's protracted and unsuccessful negotiations following Boxer's widthrawal, the BAI, its successor regulator on 30 April 2010, now intends to establish whether the third <b>placed</b> <b>consortium,</b> Easy TV, is still interested in the DTT multiplex operator's contract.|$|R

5000|$|OneVision {{was unable}} to {{conclude}} negotiations with the BAI due to difficulties with the terms of RTÉ NL apparently regarding multiplexing, marketing for DTT and other issues. The licence offer has now been made to Easy TV (DTT) the third <b>placed</b> <b>consortium</b> that includes RTÉ and Liberty Global, who own the cable operator UPC. In the event that that consortia turn down or do not conclude licence with the BAI, then the licence contract terms {{may have to be}} revised to reflect these developments and the contest process restarted after some time or interventive direction by the Minister of Communications, Energy & Natural Resources on how pay DTT will proceed. If the Easy TV (DTT)consortia accept the BCI licence however, and conclude the contract with them, then the Pay DTT operation following successful contract negotiation with RTÉ NL it may launch by September 2010 or later with 2011 look more likely by the day either with a pay DTT operator or not ...|$|R

Light years ahead of Steinbruck in her devotion to the church, Erna worked long hours {{volunteering}} at a Lutheran settlement house in Northeast Philadelphia, where she assisted young children and helped displaced refugees. [...] Years later, when the Steinbrucks had put into <b>place</b> a <b>consortium</b> of shelters and clinics servicing the homeless in Washington, D.C., it was typically Erna who worked tirelessly behind the scenes preparing the food, fixing the plumbing, keeping out the rats, and making the beds. [...] "John Steinbruck talks it, Erna does it," [...] was a common refrain. John and Erna Steinbruck together had five children, Mark John, John Andrew, Elisabeth Ann, Michael Paul, and Mary Katherine, and have remained married for 58 years. They currently reside in Lewes, Delaware.|$|R

In 2013, the 3Gb-TEST consortium obtained funding from the European Union to prepare {{the health care system}} for these innovations in DNA diagnostics.

At the Consortium meeting in Athens in September 2014, the Consortium coined the word genotranslation for this crucial step. This step leads to a so-called genoreport. Guidelines are needed to determine the required content of these reports.|$|R
40|$|The 1947 {{report by}} Haven Emerson envisioned the {{widespread}} delivery of local {{public health services}} through organizational patterns that substituted multi-county or regional agencies for locally controlled departments. The 1971 study by Vlado Getting supported the Emerson report and suggested alternative methods to provide public health services via multi-county area health service agencies for rural areas of Illinois. The number of local agencies in the State has doubled since the mid- 1960 s, yet a majority of rural counties have maintained a single-county health agency rather than forming multi-county arrangements. In effect, potential economies of scale have been forfeited. In northwest Illinois, however, eight local health departments, covering both rural and urban areas, have formed a multi-county consortium to identify and meet several overlapping program needs. This Region I consortium, with a population base of 590, 000, was created {{as a result of}} the 1981 Omnibus Budget Reduction Act. Through the block grants created by the act, funds became available for preventive health and health promotion activities in fiscal year 1982. Once in <b>place,</b> the <b>consortium</b> provided a cost effective means to manage the Women, Infants, and Children Supplemental Feeding Program (WIC) and some elements of family planning programs in Region I. The consortium approach offers numerous opportunities for future growth and regionalization of services...|$|R

40|$|The {{past three}} three decades have {{witnessed}} the evolution of diverse theories of development, each positing a particular approach which {{would lead to the}} solution of development problems. One such theory is that since developing countries are too poor to generate their own savings, private foreign investment can act as the missing link in the development cycle and thus contribute towards their overall development. This dissertation seeks to test the efficacy or otherwise of this highly controversial theory as a developmental strategy with regard to the VALCO smelter investment and its related Volta River Project in Ghana. The case study approach has been adopted, enabling a detailed empirical study of a specific case to be carried out. Even though the development literature abounds with writings on {{the pros and cons of}} private foreign investment, empirical data on specific cases of private foreign investment are relatively scarce. On the attainment of Ghana's independence President Nkrumah decided to dam the Volta River to generate electricity as a basis for the country's industrial development. In particular, he intended to use the power to develop the country's large bauxite deposits, as the basis for the establishment of an integrated aluminium industry. Faced with the lack of capital and expertise as well as the loss of interest in the project by the British, who were the originators of the idea, Nkrumah had no alternative but to turn to the U. S. for assistance. As a precondition to assisting Ghana, the American Government recommended that for the project to be viable the Ghana Government should build the dam, partly from the latter's own resources and partly with assistance from the U. S. Government and international lending institutions. Private American corporations would invest in the building and management of an aluminium smelter which would consume a substantial proportion of the hydro-power to be generated. The U. S. Government argued that this would enable the host country to get a constant source of scarce foreign exchange to pay off the huge debt to be incurred from the hydro-electric project. The net effect of this development was that the original integrated aluminium industry idea, as envisaged by the British and Nkrumah, was jettisoned. In its <b>place,</b> VALCO, a <b>consortium</b> of two U. S. multinational aluminium companies, built an aluminium smelter which currently consumes about 65 per cent of the power, at one of the lowest rates in the World. VALCO had previously been granted generous concessions, including a 30 -year exemption from the payment of duties and tariffs and a long tax holiday. While Ghana imports all her aluminium requirements to feed her factories, VALCO exports all the 200, 000 tonnes of aluminium ingots produced by the smelter to overseas markets. VALCO also imports alumina from Jamaica and the U. S. to feed its smelter, while Ghana's extensive bauxite deposits remain untouched. Meanwhile, the Volta River has flooded large expanses of previously farmed land, and adversely affected the lives of the majority of the 80, 000 people who originally lived along the river basin. Apart from the loss of livelihood many of these people have become afflicted with water-borne diseases. Ghana's industrial revolution has at best only remained a dream, as there is not much power left to enable other industries to be established. On the whole, the benefits of the VALCO investment to Ghana has been marginal. The main beneficiary has been the American companies. Nationalization and joint ventures are among some of the policy options open to policymakers in the developing world to counteract the negative aspects of private foreign investment...|$|R
