2500|$|The {{designation}} [...] "1-Adam-12" [...] is {{a combination}} of three elements. The first element indicates the unit's LAPD division. The second element indicates the type of unit. The third element identifies the <b>patrol</b> <b>car's</b> number. The one in 1-Adam-12 means the <b>patrol</b> <b>car</b> operates in Division 1 (Central Division). LAPD assigns two-person units the letter [...] "A". [...] In the LAPD phonetic alphabet, the letter [...] "A" [...] is spoken as [...] "Adam". [...] The third element is the last two numbers of the <b>patrol</b> <b>car's</b> full unit number. [...] In the program, 1-Adam-12 typically operated in the Rampart Division, Division 2, not the Central Division, Division 1, meaning the unit's call sign should have technically been 2-Adam-12. There was never an actual <b>patrol</b> <b>car</b> with the call sign of 1-Adam-12.|$|R
