Hinde also met {{prominent}} Shawnee Blue Jacket and reported {{on him for}} the local newspapers.

5|$|Many {{different}} types and sizes of horse {{were used in}} war, depending on the form of warfare. The type used varied with whether the horse was being ridden or driven, and whether they were being used for reconnaissance, cavalry charges, raiding, communication, or supply. Throughout history, mules and donkeys as well as horses <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in providing support to armies in the field.|$|E
5|$|Similar {{photographs}} were taken of Anita Ekberg and Sophia Loren, among others. According to The Guardian, Bardot's photographs in particular turned Saint-Tropez into the beachwear {{capital of the}} world, with Bardot identified as the original Cannes bathing beauty. Bardot's photography helped to enhance the public profile of the festival, and Cannes in turn <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in her career.|$|E

5|$|Asch was {{notable for}} a chance event. The 390th Squadron of the 366th Fighter Group had {{launched}} two fighter sweeps that morning, which <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in the failure of JG 11′s attack. The leader of the 487th squadron, 352nd Fighter Group, John Charles Meyer, anticipated German activity and had a flight of 12 P-51s about to take off on a combat patrol when the attack began. They took off under fire.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{completion}} of the Arlington Line, which was built several miles to the southwest of Fort Jackson, atop the heights of Arlington, the maintenance of Forts Jackson and Runyon was neglected. The two forts had largely been made redundant by the newer, stronger works atop the hills, and it was believed that neither <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> any longer in the defenses of Washington. Fort Jackson was kept in service only as an inspection station for traffic crossing Long Bridge.|$|E
5|$|The {{conquest of}} Asia by Alexander the Great exposed the Greeks to ideas from Syria, Babylon, Persia and central Asia. Around 280 BCE, Berossus, a priest of Bel from Babylon, {{moved to the}} Greek island of Kos, {{teaching}} astrology and Babylonian culture. By the 1st century BCE, there were two varieties of astrology, one using horoscopes to describe the past, present and future; the other, theurgic, emphasising the soul's ascent to the stars. Greek influence <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in the transmission of astrological theory to Rome.|$|E

5|$|As a Senator, Gravel became {{nationally known}} for his {{forceful}} but unsuccessful attempts to end the draft during the War in Vietnam and for putting the Pentagon Papers into the public record in 1971 at some risk to himself. He conducted an unusual campaign for the Democratic nomination in 1972 for Vice President of the United States, and then <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in getting Congressional approval for the Trans-Alaska pipeline in 1973. He was re-elected to the Senate in 1974, but gradually alienated most of his Alaskan constituencies and his bid for a third term was defeated in a primary election in 1980.|$|E
5|$|At the time, several princes {{complained that}} they were being betrayed by Britain, who they {{regarded}} as an ally, and Sir Conrad Corfield resigned his position as head of the Political Department in protest at Mountbatten's policies. Mountbatten's policies were also criticised by the opposition Conservative Party. Winston Churchill compared the language used by the Indian government with that used by Adolf Hitler before the invasion of Austria. Modern historians such as Lumby and Moore, however, take the view that Mountbatten <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in ensuring that the princely states agreed to accede to India.|$|E
5|$|From {{the sixteenth}} century onwards Alfred's {{reputation}} became dominant and Æthelstan largely disappeared from popular consciousness. Sharon Turner's History of the Anglo-Saxons, first published between 1799 and 1805, <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in promoting Anglo-Saxon studies, and he helped to establish Brunanburh as a key battle in English history, but his treatment of Æthelstan was slight in comparison with Alfred. Charles Dickens had only one paragraph on Æthelstan in his Child's History of England, and although Anglo-Saxon history was a popular subject for nineteenth-century artists, and Alfred was frequently depicted in paintings at the Royal Academy between 1769 and 1904, {{there was not one}} picture of Æthelstan.|$|E

5|$|In England, Anne largely {{turned from}} {{political}} {{to social and}} artistic activities. Though she participated fully {{in the life of}} James' court and maintained a court of her own, often attracting those not welcomed by James, she rarely took political sides against her husband. Whatever her private difficulties with James, she proved a diplomatic asset to him in England, conducting herself with discretion and graciousness in public. Anne <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role,</b> for example, in conveying to ambassadors and foreign visitors the prestige of the Stuart dynasty and its Danish connections.|$|E
5|$|In October 1964 Khrushchev was ousted. Suslov <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in the event. Suslov was, {{alongside}} Premier Alexei Kosygin and First Secretary Leonid Brezhnev, one of {{the most}} influential Soviet politicians of the 1960s following the ouster of Khrushchev. Having led the opposition against Khrushchev for years, Suslov had acquired and wielded great power within the Central Committee when Brezhnev rose to power. However, Suslov was never interested in becoming the leader of the Soviet Union, and was content to remain the man behind the scenes. During most of his term, Suslov was one of four people who had both a seat in the Secretariat and the Politburo; the three others were Brezhnev, Andrei Kirilenko and Fyodor Kulakov.|$|E
5|$|Innovation led to {{business}} {{growth in the}} region. In 1884, John Henry Patterson acquired James Ritty's National Manufacturing Company along with his cash register patents and formed the National Cash Register Company (NCR). The company manufactured the first mechanical cash registers and <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in the shaping of Dayton's reputation as an epicenter for manufacturing in the early 1900s. In 1906, Charles F. Kettering, a leading engineer at the company, helped develop the first electric cash register, which propelled NCR into the national spotlight. NCR also helped develop the US Navy Bombe, a code-breaking machine that helped crack the Enigma machine cipher during World War II.|$|E

5|$|Pericles {{was born}} c. 495 BC, in Athens, Greece. He {{was the son}} of the {{politician}} Xanthippus, who, though ostracized in 485–484 BC, returned to Athens to command the Athenian contingent in the Greek victory at Mycale just five years later. Pericles' mother, Agariste, a member of the powerful and controversial noble family of the Alcmaeonidae, and her familial connections <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in helping start Xanthippus' political career. Agariste was the great-granddaughter of the tyrant of Sicyon, Cleisthenes, and the niece of the Athenian reformer Cleisthenes.|$|E
5|$|The Kannada {{language}} {{serves as}} the official language {{of the state of}} Karnataka, as the native language of approximately 65% of its population and as one of the classical languages of India. Kannada <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in the creation of Karnataka: linguistic demographics {{played a major role in}} defining the new state in 1956. Tulu, Konkani and Kodava are other minor native languages that share a long history in the state. Urdu is spoken widely by the Muslim population. Less widely spoken languages include Beary bashe and certain languages such as Sankethi. Some of the regional languages in Karnataka are Tulu, Kodava, Konkani and Beary.|$|E
5|$|All the same, between 1853 and the 1930s, fiscal {{instability}} was a transitory phenomenon. The depressions of 1873–77 and 1890–91 <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> {{in fostering}} {{the rise of}} industry: timidly in the 1870s and more decisively in the 1890s, industry grew with each crisis {{in response to the}} need of a damaged economy to improve its trade balance through import-substitution. By 1914, about 15% the Argentine labour force was involved in manufacturing, compared to 20% involved in commercial activities. In 1913, the country's income per head was on a par with that of France and Germany, and far ahead of Italy's or Spain's. At the end of 1913, Argentina had a gold stock of £59 million, or 3.7% of the world's monetary gold, while representing 1.2% of the world's economic output.|$|E

5|$|During Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, 86 AV-8Bs amassed 3,380 {{flights and}} about 4,100 flight hours, {{with a mission}} {{availability}} rate of over 90 percent. Five AV-8Bs were lost to enemy surface-to-air missiles, and two USMC pilots were killed. The AV-8B had an attrition rate of 1.5 aircraft for every 1,000 sorties flown. U.S. Army General Norman Schwarzkopf later named the AV-8B among the seven weapons—along with the F-117 Nighthawk and AH-64 Apache—that <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in the war. In {{the aftermath of the}} war, from 27 August 1992, until 2003, USMC AV-8Bs and other aircraft patrolled Iraqi skies in support of Operation Southern Watch. The AV-8Bs launched from amphibious assault ships in the Persian Gulf, and from forward operating bases such as Ali Al Salem Air Base, Kuwait.|$|E
5|$|It {{was during}} this period of turmoil, in February 865, that Caliph al-Musta'in (r. 862–866) and two of the senior Turkish officers, Wasif and Bugha the Younger, fled Samarra to Baghdad, where they could count on the support of the Tahirids. The Turkish army in Samarra then {{selected}} al-Musta'in's brother al-Mu'tazz (r. 866–869) as Caliph, and Abu Ahmad was entrusted with the conduct of operations against al-Musta'in and his supporters. The ensuing siege of Baghdad lasted from February to December 865, after which a negotiated settlement was reached. Contrary to the agreed terms, however, al-Musta'in was murdered. It was most likely during this time that Abu Ahmad consolidated his relationship with the Turkish military, especially with Musa ibn Bugha, who <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> during the siege. Abu Ahmad further solidified these ties when he secured a pardon for Bugha the Younger.|$|E
5|$|Mdina was not {{attacked}} directly {{during the}} Great Siege of Malta, but it nonetheless <b>played</b> <b>a</b> <b>crucial</b> <b>role</b> in the siege. Ottoman general Lala Mustafa Pasha {{wanted to take}} over the poorly-defended city first, but was overruled by Piali Pasha who wanted to attack Fort Saint Elmo. The fort was taken over after a month of heavy fighting, but the Ottomans had lost crucial time in doing so. On 7 August 1565, the Order's cavalry in Mdina attacked the unprotected Ottoman field hospital, which led in the invaders abandoning a major assault on the main fortifications in Birgu and Senglea. The Ottomans tried {{to take over the}} city in September so as to winter there, but abandoned their plans when Mdina fired its cannon, leading them to believe that the city had ammunition to spare.|$|E
