However, {{it is known that}} the largest percent of the catches are juvenile tuna between 10 and 35 pounds. These fish are probably somewhere between one and two years of age, well below sexual maturity. [...] Fishermen report that the offshore fishing grounds are productive year-round. However, during summer months, large Yellowfin tuna are more abundant. The weight of the catches are estimated to be about 75% Thunnus obesus (Bigeye tuna), and 25% T. albacares (Yellowfin tuna). According to estimates, about 1 million pounds of Bigeye tuna and 400,000 pounds of Yellowfin were fished from offshore operations from the region in 1995. The amount of tuna is thought to depend on conditions on the seamount, and on the current <b>process</b> <b>range</b> of the tuna schools.|$|E

40|$|Injection forging has {{advantages}} for the nett-forming of flange-typed components. Research, however, has identified that folds occurred on material free-surfaces during the injection upsetting of flanges when the billet-diameter/flange-thickness ratio was beyond 1. 2. These occurred at lower aspect ratios than that defined {{with reference to}} the stability of the billets. FE simulation and experiments were conducted to identify approaches by which the initiation of folds could be prevented and, hence, the <b>process</b> <b>range</b> of injection forging could be improved. It was recognised that, since the folds develop for conditions under which the billets are stable (no buckling or lateral sliding), it is possible to design a forming route of more than one stage to prevent the development of the flaws and, hence, to extend formability. Through the research, a preforming procedure was developed by means of which the <b>process</b> <b>range</b> of injection forging of solid components can be extended to flange-thickness/billet-diameter ratios of 1. 4 – 1. 5 using machined preforms, and to 1. 50 – 1. 64 using preformed billets.
