40|$|Calculation of {{the energy}} {{absorption}} of marine structures at certain impact scenarios by means of finite element analysis is regularly being performed by researchers. Recent studies at TNO, focusing on the vulnerability of a liquefied natural gas tank, showed that in collisions the deformation of the structures is much more complex {{compared to that of}} a simple hull (shell) structure and requires more accurate fracture criteria. In this study, forming limit diagrams (FLD) are used to identify the regions of the impacted structure that are beyond the predefined deformation limit. Via using FLD in crash analysis, compared to conventional methods, more accurate results can be obtained in a shorter postprocessing time. Ls-Dyna results can easily be post processed using LS Prepost and FLD option. This paper explains why use of FLD in marine crash calculations are more accurate, and provides an example case where a gas tank is impacted by a <b>push</b> <b>barge</b> bow and FLD is used to analyze the damage...|$|E
40|$|Logging on islands differs {{considerably}} from logging {{carried out on}} the mainland. The transportation of machines to the islands and between islands calls for special equipment. Furthermore, the long distance transport must be done simultaneously with logging, because the buffer raft between ground forwarding and vessel transport is very small and used also for the transport of logging machines and crews between islands. There are several options to arrange long distance waterway transport by using boats and various kinds of barges. In this study different vessel transport systems carrying wood from islands were studied by using discreteevent simulation. A new <b>push</b> <b>barge</b> system suitable for transport of wood from islands was compared to the current powered barge system. A three barges ’ setting system gave the lowest harvesting costs when the transport distance exceeded 100 km. At shorter transport distances the current system was most competitive. Direct loading of barges by forwarders was cheaper than {{the use of a}} separater loader. Direct loading, however, requires new driving ramps and is not applicable everywhere...|$|E

5000|$|A pusher, pusher craft, pusher boat, pusher tug, or towboat, is a boat {{designed}} for <b>pushing</b> <b>barges</b> or car floats. In the United States, the industries that use these vessels {{refer to them}} as towboats. These vessels are characterized by a square bow, a shallow draft, and typically have knees, which are large plates mounted to the bow for <b>pushing</b> <b>barges</b> of various heights. These boats usually operate on rivers and inland waterways. Multiple barges lashed together, or a boat and any barges lashed to it, are referred to as a [...] "tow" [...] and can have dozens of barges. Many of these vessels, especially the long distances, or long haul boats, include living quarters for the crew.|$|R

50|$|Canadian National Tug no. 5, or CN Tug no. 5, was a tugboat {{owned and}} {{operated}} by the Canadian National Railway (CNR) company on Okanagan Lake in British Columbia, Canada. She was launched on May 8, 1930 and was a steel tug that <b>pushed</b> railway <b>barges</b> to the Okanagan Landing shipyard and railway connection to transport fruit. By the 1950s and 1960s, CNR had three tugs: MV Pentowna, CN Tug no. 6, and CN Tug no. 5. Only one tug operated at a time, though two would be used in busy times, and each tug only <b>pushed</b> one <b>barge.</b> CNRs competitor on the lake, the Canadian Pacific Railway company, ran three tugs at a time, as well as many sternwheelers over the years, and each tug <b>pushed</b> two <b>barges.</b> Although the date of CN Tug no. 5s retirement is unknown, CNR terminated barge service on the lake in 1973, retiring its last ship, CN Tug no. 6, due to the highways and other modes of transportation that had emerged by that time.|$|R

[...] Despite the hurricane force centered on Mississippi, neighboring areas were also affected: when New Orleans began slowly flooding with high east/north winds, a 28-foot (9m) storm surge eastward from Bay St. Louis devastated coastal areas with 30–55foot (17m) sea waves, flooding 12miles (19km) inland. [...] The waves <b>pushed</b> <b>barges,</b> oil rigs, ships, and debris into submerged towns to flatten many coastal buildings across to Pascagoula with 20-foot (6 m) surge, [...] and into Alabama with 15-foot (5m) surge and 24-foot (7m) waves battering beach houses inside Mobile Bay and tilting the battleship [...] [...] (See extensive details below).|$|R
50|$|An opduwer or opdrukker {{is a small}} tug- or towboat {{that was}} used in the Low Countries to <b>push</b> <b>barges</b> on inland waterways. Opduwers were {{predominantly}} in use {{in the first half of}} the twentieth century. During that time the internal combustion engine got adapted for inland shipping. Earlier, barges were propelled either by sail or by towing from shore by horse or manpower. Fitting an engine and propeller to an existing barge was found cumbersome however. It was easier to construct a small tugboat and use this to propel the existing barge.Opduwers were built between about 1910 to 1940. A large number survive as pleasure craft.|$|R
