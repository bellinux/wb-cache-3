Planché was offered, and accepted, the position of Rouge Croix Pursuivant, {{one of the four}} junior-most officers of arms. Some years previously he had indicated his interest in becoming an officer of arms, should a vacancy arise, to the Duke of Norfolk, who as Earl Marshal is responsible for the College of Arms. Planché was also an acquaintance of Charles Young, Garter King of Arms, the <b>principal</b> <b>officer</b> of arms at the College.|$|E

25|$|Following {{the end of}} World War I, {{there were}} limited {{opportunities}} in the peacetime Royal Navy. In 1919, Firebrace applied to the London Fire Brigade originally for the post of chief officer but instead {{was appointed to the}} lower position of <b>principal</b> <b>officer.</b> He was promoted to divisional officer in 1920 and senior divisional officer in 1933. He recruited John Horner in 1933 and set him on the road to fast track promotion. He would go on to become the general secretary of the Fire Brigades Union. He was promoted to deputy chief in 1936, and finally to chief officer in June 1938.|$|E
25|$|He {{continued}} {{to manage the}} rubber plantation but {{after the end of}} the war, commodity prices dropped and by 1921 it was difficult to make a profit. He returned again to Britain, in what later biographer Philip Heselton speculated might have been an unsuccessful attempt to ask his father for money. Returning to Malaya, Gardner found that the Borneo Company had sacked him, and he was forced to find work with the Public Works Department. In September 1923 he successfully applied to the Office of Customs to become a government-inspector of rubber plantations, a job that involved a great amount of travelling around the country, something he enjoyed. After a brief but serious illness, the Johore government reassigned Gardner to an office in the Lands Office while he recovered, eventually being promoted to <b>Principal</b> <b>Officer</b> of Customs. In this capacity, he was made an Inspector of Rubber Shops, overseeing the regulation and sale of rubber in the country. In 1926 he was placed in charge of monitoring shops selling opium, noting regular irregularities and a thriving illegal trade in the controlled substance; believing opium to be essentially harmless, there is evidence indicating that Gardner probably took many bribes in this position, earning himself a small fortune.|$|E

2500|$|Critics of Johnson {{point to}} his {{central role in}} the Discovery Institute's {{carefully}} orchestrated campaign known as the wedge strategy. The wedge strategy, as envisioned by the Discovery Institute, is designed to leave the science establishment looking close-minded in the short term with a long-term goal being a redefinition of science that centers on the removal of methodological naturalism from the philosophy of science and the scientific method, thereby allowing for supernatural explanations to be introduced as science. Critics note that Johnson, as a <b>principal</b> <b>officer</b> of the Discovery Institute, often cites an overall plan to put the United States on a course toward the theocracy envisioned in the wedge strategy, and that the Discovery Institute {{as a matter of policy}} intentionally obfuscates its agenda. According to Johnson, [...] "The movement we now call the wedge made its public debut at a conference of scientists and philosophers held at Southern Methodist University in March 1992." ...|$|E
