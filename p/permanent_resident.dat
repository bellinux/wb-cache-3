She wanted to lead a useful life independent of her parents and considered a career in mycology, but the all-male scientific community regarded her as an amateur and she abandoned fungi.

Three of the people arrested in 1998 were agents for a foreign intelligence agency. One of them had recruited the fourth person to collect intelligence on and to subvert a local community organization. All the detainees were subsequently released.|$|E
50|$|Hong Kong, as {{a special}} {{administrative}} region of China, does not have its own citizenship laws. The right of abode is the status that allows unrestricted right {{to live and work}} in Hong Kong; persons with right of abode in Hong Kong are called <b>permanent</b> <b>residents.</b> Most <b>permanent</b> <b>residents</b> of Chinese descent are Chinese citizens as provided by the Chinese nationality law. Citizens of other countries who have obtained right of abode in Hong Kong remain the citizens of their respective countries, and enjoy all the rights accorded to <b>permanent</b> <b>residents</b> except for those restricted to <b>permanent</b> <b>residents</b> with Chinese citizenship, such as the right to a HKSAR passport and the eligibility to be elected as the Chief Executive.|$|R
50|$|In {{the years}} prior to 2012 there was an {{increase}} in students who were <b>permanent</b> <b>residents</b> of the United States and did not plan to go back to Japan. Instead they attended the schools to maintain their ethnic identity. By that year the majority {{of the students in the}} Japanese weekend schools in the United States were <b>permanent</b> <b>residents</b> of the United States. Kano argued that the MEXT curriculum for many of these <b>permanent</b> <b>residents</b> is unnecessary and out of touch. In the 1990s weekend schools began creating keishogo or heritage education classes for <b>permanent</b> <b>residents</b> of the U.S. The administrators and teachers of each weekend school which offers heritage classes develop their own curriculum.|$|R

5|$|Finally, {{other species}} are {{encountered}} only accidentally, or so rarely in Canadian territory {{that it is}} impossible to tell whether they are <b>permanent</b> <b>resident.</b> Most of these species are cetaceans, some generally poorly known: Risso's dolphin (Grampus griseus), the dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia sima and K. breviceps), Blainville's and True's beaked whale (Mesoplodon densirostris and M. mirus), the false killer whale (Pseudorca crassidens), and the striped dolphin (Stenella coeruleoalba). The big free-tailed and evening bats (respectively Nyctinomops macrotis and Nycticeius humeralis), as well as the New England cottontail (Sylvilagus transitionalis) are found mostly in areas south of the U.S.-Canada frontier, and occasionally in Canada.|$|E
5|$|It {{is usually}} a <b>permanent</b> <b>resident</b> {{throughout}} its range, although birds at the extreme north of its range may migrate short distances, and others across their range may undergo local movements in unfavourable conditions. In South America, its range stretches to central Chile and Argentina. It also is found as a vagrant on the islands of the Caribbean. It prefers open land interspersed with areas of woods or brush. It {{is also found in}} moist lowland forests, shrublands and grasslands, wetlands and swamps, pastures, and heavily degraded former forests. Preferring lowlands, it is rarely seen in mountainous areas. It is usually seen soaring or perched on fence posts or dead trees.|$|E
5|$|After Emil {{was arrested}} in 1933, Kristel fled to Zurich, where she studied {{education}} and psychology at the University of Zurich. She returned to Berlin in 1934, where she too worked at the car rental agency. In 1936, Emil arranged with Quaker friends in the United States for Kristel to attend Swarthmore College there. She visited Fuchs in England en route to America, where she eventually married an American communist, Robert Heineman, and settled in Cambridge, Massachusetts. She became a <b>permanent</b> <b>resident</b> in the United States in May 1938. In 1936, Kittowski and Elisabeth were arrested again, and the rental cars were impounded. Gerhard and Karin fled to Czechoslovakia. Elisabeth was released and {{went to live with}} Emil, while Kittowski, sentenced to six years, later escaped from prison and also made his way to Czechoslovakia. In August 1939, Elisabeth committed suicide by throwing herself from a train, leaving Emil to raise young Klaus.|$|E

5|$|Alex (Erin Yvette), a teenager, is on {{the last}} ferry heading to the fictional Edwards Island for a weekend party. She is {{accompanied}} by Ren (Aaron Kuban), her stoner friend, and Jonas (Gavin Hammon), her new stepbrother. On the island, Alex and company meet Clarissa (Avital Ash), Alex's late brother Michael's ex-girlfriend, and Nona (Brittani Johnson), Clarissa's best friend and Ren's love interest. Ren notes that the island's only <b>permanent</b> <b>resident,</b> Maggie Adler, has recently died. After camping on the beach, Alex, Ren, and Jonas explore the nearby caves, where it is rumored certain radio frequencies cause supernatural events. In a small cavern, Alex tunes her radio and unexpectedly forms a rift. A voice answers and the teens experience visions before passing out. Jonas and Alex awake in front of Harden Tower. Ren calls, having passed out in the woods, while Clarissa calls from the decommissioned military fort on the island.|$|E
5|$|Canadian {{citizenship}} is typically obtained by birth in Canada or by birth or adoption abroad when {{at least one}} biological parent or adoptive parent is a Canadian citizen {{who was born in}} Canada or naturalized in Canada (and did not receive citizenship by being born outside of Canada to a Canadian citizen). It can also be granted to a <b>permanent</b> <b>resident</b> who lives in Canada for three out of four years and meets specific requirements. Canada established its own nationality law in 1946, with the enactment of the Canadian Citizenship Act which took effect on January 1, 1947. The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act was passed by the Parliament of Canada in 2001 as Bill C-11, which replaced the Immigration Act of 1976 as the primary federal legislation regulating immigration. Prior to the conferring of legal status on Canadian citizenship, Canada's naturalization laws consisted of a multitude of Acts beginning with the Immigration Act of 1910.|$|E
5|$|Jean Baptiste Point du Sable (or Point de Sable, Point au Sable, Point Sable, Pointe DuSable) (before 1750 – August 28, 1818) is {{regarded}} as the first <b>permanent</b> <b>resident</b> of what became Chicago, Illinois. Little is known of his life prior to the 1770s. In 1779, he was living on the site of present-day Michigan City, Indiana, when he was arrested by the British military on suspicion of being an American sympathizer in the American Revolutionary War. In the early 1780s he worked for the British lieutenant-governor of Michilimackinac on an estate at what is now the city of St. Clair, Michigan, before moving to settle {{at the mouth of the}} Chicago River. He is first recorded living in Chicago in early 1790, having apparently become established sometime earlier. He sold his property in Chicago in 1800 and moved to St. Charles, Missouri, where he died in 1818.|$|E
