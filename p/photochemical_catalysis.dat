40|$|Water {{oxidation}} in all oxygenic photosynthetic organisms is catalysed by the Mn₄CaO₄ {{cluster of}} Photosystem II.

We report here in situ X-ray absorption spectroscopy and transmission electron microscopy studies that demonstrate that this cluster dissociates into Mn(II) compounds in the Nafion, which are then reoxidized to form dispersed nanoparticles of a disordered Mn(III/IV) -oxide phase. Cycling between the photoreduced product and this mineral-like solid is responsible for the observed <b>photochemical</b> water-oxidation <b>catalysis.</b> The original manganese cluster serves only as a precursor to the catalytically active material.

In particular, extensive research has been focused on magnetic metallic nanoparticles such as nickel (Ni), cobalt, and iron which represent a group of promising nanomaterials to ascertain their usefulness in several areas such as high density magnetic recording media, chemical and <b>photochemical</b> <b>catalysis,</b> ferrofluids, and medical diagnostics because of their special structures and distinctive magnetic and physical properties [7 – 9].|$|E
30|$|The {{development}} of new heterostructures is still a challenging subject, for the critical step of this work remains how to modulate the properties by tailoring the nucleation of one phase {{on the surface of}} the other. Wurtzite CdS, a direct band gap semiconductor with a gap energy of 2.42 eV at 300 K, is one of the first discovered semiconductors which has promising applications in <b>photochemical</b> <b>catalysis,</b> gas sensor, detectors for laser and infrared, solar cell, nonlinear optical materials, various luminescence devices, and optoelectronic devices [26 – 28]. On the account of this, various 1 D CdS nanostructural materials have been generated through various routes [29 – 32]. ZnS has a wider band gap (Eg = 3.7 eV) than CdS. The surface modification of a wide band gap semiconducting shell around a narrow band gap core can alter the charge, functionality, and reactivity of the materials and consequently enhance the functional properties due to localization of the electron-hole pairs [33 – 35]. Up to now, CdS@ZnS core-shell nanostructures with stronger luminescence and electrical properties have been successfully prepared by metal-organic CVD (MOCVD) process or wet–chemical approach [10, 36 – 38].|$|E

Cycloaddition reactions are desirable because they produce no unwanted side reactions or small molecules, allowing {{for the formation of}} high molecular weight species and glassy crosslinked networks. Both the Diels-Alder reaction and the copper-catalyzed azide-alkyne cycloaddition (CuAAC) were studied. Accomplishments include externally triggered healing of a thermoreversible covalent network via self-limited hysteresis heating, the creation of Diels-Alder based photoresists, and the successful <b>photochemical</b> <b>catalysis</b> of CuAAC {{as an alternative to the}} use of ascorbic acid for the generation of Cu(I) in click reactions.

The model allows us to find a new artificial atom X (not presented in the periodic table) that is a new analogue of isolated alkali-metal atoms. In this artificial atom, the valence electron can participate in various physical [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10] and chemical [4, 6] processes in much the same way as the atomic valence electrons can do in various atomic systems (in particular, in isolated alkali-metal atoms [7] [...]). These processes are possible because of new unique properties of such artificial atoms: strong oxidizing ability, potentialities for increasing the rates of <b>photochemical</b> reactions during <b>catalysis</b> and adsorption as well as the ability to form a great number of new compounds with unique characteristics (in particular, quasi-molecules and quasi-crystals [4, 5, 6]).|$|R
40|$|The {{research}} {{described in}} this thesis focuses on the design and synthesis of stable α-diazosulfoxides and investigation of their reactivity {{under a variety of}} conditions (transition-metal <b>catalysis,</b> thermal, <b>photochemical</b> and microwave) with a particular emphasis on the synthesis of novel heterocyclic compounds with potential biological activity. The exclusive reaction pathway for these α-diazosulfoxides was found to be hetero-Wolff rearrangement to give α-oxosulfine intermediates. In the first chapter, a literature review of sulfines is presented, including a discussion of naturally occurring sulfines, and an overview of the synthesis and reactivity of sulfines. The potential of sulfines in organic synthesis and recent developments in particular are highlighted. The second chapter discusses the synthesis and reactivity of α-diazosulfoxides, building on earlier results in this research group. The synthesis of lactone-based α-diazosulfoxides and, for the first time, ketone-based benzofused and monocyclic α-diazosulfoxides is described. The reactivity of these α-diazosulfoxides is then explored under a variety of conditions, such as transition-metal <b>catalysis,</b> <b>photochemical</b> and microwave, generating labile α-oxosulfine intermediates, which are trapped using amines and dienes, in addition to the spontaneous reaction pathways which occur with α-oxosulfines {{in the absence of a}} trap. A new reaction pathway was explored with the lactone based α-oxosulfines, involving reaction with amines to generate novel 3 -aminofuran- 2 (5 H) -ones via carbophilic attack, in very good yields. The reactivity of ketone-based α-diazosulfoxides was explored for the first time, and once again, pseudo-Wolff rearrangement to the α-oxosulfines was the exclusive reaction pathway observed. The intermediacy of the α-oxosulfines was confirmed by trapping as cycloadducts, with the stereochemical features dependant on the reaction conditions. In the absence of a diene trap, a number of reaction fates from the α-oxosulfines were observed, including complete sulfinyl extrusion to give indanones, sulfur extrusion to give indanediones, and, to a lesser extent, dimerisation. The indanediones were characterised by trapping as quinoxalines, to enable full characterisation. One of the overriding outcomes of this thesis was the provision of new insights into the behaviour of α-oxosulfines with different transition metal catalysts, and under thermal, microwave and photolysis conditions. A series of 3 -aminofuran- 2 (5 H) -ones and benzofused dihydro- 2 H-thiopyran S-oxides were submitted for anticancer screening at the U. S. National Cancer Institute. A number of these derivatives were identified as hit compounds, with excellent cell growth inhibition. One 3 -aminofuran- 2 (5 H) -one derivative has been chosen for further screening.

Small {{domains of}} cobalt on silica (CoSBA) were {{prepared}} by the reaction of Co[N(SiMe 3) 2] 2 and SBA- 15, resulting {{in a range of}} surface structures as the cobalt loading varied from 0. 27 to 5. 11 wt%. X-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS) was employed to characterize these surface structures, which range from single-site cobalt atoms to small clusters of Co 3 O 4. The CoSBA materials exhibit <b>photochemical</b> water oxidation <b>catalysis,</b> revealing distinct catalytic activities associated with characteristic types of surface structures that are dominant in particular concentration regimes. The catalytic turnover frequency for water oxidation of an isolated single-site cobalt atom (0. 0143 s - 1) is much greater than that observed for a surface atom of a small cluster Co 3 O 4 on silica (0. 0006 s - 1). The CoSBA catalysts were recyclable for more than seven catalytic cycles (> 200 turnovers) with additional sacrificial oxidant, and no leaching of cobalt was observed. Post-catalytic analysis of CoSBA by XAS revealed that the cobalt atoms were partially oxidized to Co 3 +, without exhibiting significant surface migration and aggregation of cobalt atoms. Chapter 2. Single-site cobalt atoms on various oxide surfaces (TiO 2, MgO, SBA- 15, AlPO, and Y-Zeolite) were prepared and evaluated as water oxidation catalysts. Superior catalytic rates were observed for cobalt sites on basic supporting oxides (TiO 2 and MgO) relative to those on acidic oxides (Y-Zeolite, AlPo, and SiO 2). Per-atom turnover frequencies of ca. 0. 04 s - 1 were achieved, giving initial rates 100 times greater than a surface atom of a Co 3 O 4 nanoparticle. No correlation was observed between catalytic rates and oxygen atom affinities of the supporting oxides. Chapter 3. Cobalt metaphosphate Co(PO 3) 2 nanoparticles are prepared via the thermolytic molecular precursor (TMP) method. A Ni foam electrode decorated with Co(PO 3) 2 nanoparticles is evaluated as an anode for water oxidation electrocatalysis in pH 6. 4 phosphate-buffered water. Catalytic onset occurs at an overpotential of ca. 310 mV, which is 100 mV lower than that observed for Co 3 O 4 nanoparticles, with a comparable surface area under identical conditions. A per-metal turnover frequency (TOF) of 0. 10 - 0. 21 s - 1 is observed at &# 951; = 440 mV, which is comparable to the highest rate reported for a first-row metal heterogeneous catalyst. Post-catalytic characterization of the catalyst resting state by XPS and Raman spectroscopy reveals that surface rearrangement occurs, resulting in an oxide-like surface overlayer. Chapter 4. Linear trimetallic Co III /Co II /Co III cobalt complexes with bridging acyl-alkoxy ligands are electrocatalysts for the reduction of tosic acid in acetonitrile. The -OCMe 2 CH 2 COMe complex appears to operate homogeneously, and at an onset overpotential of only 25 mV. A turnover frequency of ca. 80 s - 1 was observed at an overptotential of 150 mV...|$|R
30|$|At present, {{semiconductor}} nanoparticles are a {{focus of}} wide-ranging studies. It {{has been shown that}} the size of these particles determines their properties [1, 2]. CdS is a II-VI semiconductor with the direct band-gap energy of 2.42  eV [3]. At the nanometer scale, this material is found at an intermediate level between atomic, molecular, and bulk, revealing new physical properties [2]. The macroscopic physical properties of CdS nanoparticles and nanocrystals measuring less than 10  nm conform to quantum mechanics rules. The spatial restriction of a nanoparticle affects the wavelength of electrons, which is reduced compared with the bulk. This effect is referred as the quantum-confinement or quantum-size effect [2]. CdS has a great potential for usage in <b>photochemical</b> <b>catalysis,</b> solar cells, nonlinear optical materials, various luminescent devices, probes for exploring DNA structures, and fluorescent probes for peptide detection [4]. The physico-chemical methods of a synthesis are commonly used to produce cadmium sulfide nanoparticles. For example, CdS nanoparticles can be prepared by the hydrothermal-microemulsion method [5], wet chemical coprecipitation method [6], and ultrasonic irradiation [7]. Such methods require a special laboratory setup and they are time-consuming. Thus, a simple and novel «green» method of semiconductor nanoparticle synthesis is a matter of considerable scientific interest [8] today.|$|E
30|$|Sb 2 S 3 {{has been}} known as the commonest {{antimony}} sulfide, which is a promising semiconductor material for photoelectric semiconductor manufacturing [7, 8]. It has a moderate band gap approximately 1.7 – 1.8  eV in crystalline form (stibnite). Curiously, the band gap is tunable at the range of 1.1 – 1.8  eV when sulfur is partly replaced by selenium [9]. Naturally, Sb 2 S 3 is a multifunction material {{that could be used}} as an absorber or a sensitizer for photovoltaic device, <b>photochemical</b> <b>catalysis,</b> and photodetector. Besides, Sb and S are comparatively abundant, low-cost, and low-toxicity elements, making it potential for large-scale application. Antimony sulfide has a unique processibility. They can be vacuum-evaporated at a low temperature (~[*] 400  °C) or solution-processed using various materials. Sb 2 S 3 was usually applied in sensitized solar cells. Using a thioacetamide-treated Sb 2 S 3 sensitizer deposited by chemical solution deposition (CBD), a sensitized hybrid solar cell with a power conversion efficiency (PCE) of 7.5 % was realized [10]. Recently, solution-processed planar heterojunction solar cells with a simple structure achieved a very satisficing PCE of 4.3 %, in which an Sb 2 S 3 film was prepared by conventional spin-cast technique with a precursor containing Sb 2 O 3, CS 2, and n-butylamine [7]. Nanostructure Sb 2 S 3 synthesized by solution method was wildly applied for high-performance photodetectors [11 – 13]. Sb 2 S 3 NW-based photodetectors exhibited a good photo-response in a wide spectral range from 300 to 800  nm. Especially at 638  nm, they showed optimal values with a high current ON/OFF ratio about 210, a spectral responsivity of 1152  A/W, a detectivity of 2 [*]×[*] 1013  Jones, and the rise and fall times of about 37  ms [11]. Solution-processed Sb 2 S 3 nanorod was usually used as an efficient photocatalyst for dye degradation [14] and high-performance sodium-ion batteries [15]. Unfortunately, there was few reported information about Sb 2 S 3 QDs.|$|E
30|$|Nanotechnology is a new, {{rapidly growing}} field with {{application}} in science {{for the purpose}} of producing new materials at the nanoscale level. The word ‘nano’ represents billions of meters (10 − 9). In recent years nanoparticles are important and have created an impact in the areas of chemical energy, electronic and biological sciences. These particles are synthesized by physical, chemical and biological methods [1]. Many nanoparticles, such as silver [2], gold [3], ZnS [4] and TiO 2 [5], have been synthesized using bacteria. Applications of nanoparticles in the biomedical field has been developing very vigorously nowadays, e.g., antibacterial applications [6, 7]. Antifungal activities of CdS have been reported by various researchers [8]. The microbial synthesis of nanoparticles had been recently recognized as a promising source of nanomaterials [9]. CdS has promising applications in technical fields such as <b>photochemical</b> <b>catalysis,</b> gas sensor, detectors for laser and infrared, solar cells, nonlinear optical materials and various luminescence devices [10, 11, 12, 13]. CdS nanoparticle synthesis has been a modern growing field of research due to its important optical, physical and chemical properties. In recent years, many techniques have been introduced for the synthesis of CdS nanoparticles. CdS it’s a group of chalcogenides and having application in photoconductive glasses for television and Xerox machines [14]. CdS is a II and IV group of semiconductor and the bulk amount of CdS has a hexagonal shape. CdS nanoparticles are important semiconductors with a direct band gap of 2.4  eV at room temperature, and these nanoparticles are attached to the photocatalysis light-emitting diode and solar cells due to their nonlinear properties. The melting point of CdS nanoparticles is 1, 600  °C. CdS has a high amount of visible light-detecting properties among the other semiconductors. Cadmium sulfide is a widely used semiconductor that has many applications such as in optoelectronic and solar cells, photodiodes, light-emitting diodes, nonlinear optics and heterogeneous photocatalysis. In the last few decades, a number of techniques have been reported for the synthesis of CdS nanoparticles [15, 16, 17]. Nowadays, CdS nanoparticles are widely used in photonic applications. Many studies have investigated the synthesis of thermotropic liquid crystal polymer material that is composed of silver nanoparticles and CdSe [18]. In the last few years, researchers have been devoted to the preparation of high-quality CdS nanoparticles and the investigation of their various properties.|$|E
40|$|Cycloadditions are a broad {{class of}} {{reactions}} where unsaturated species combine {{to form a}} cyclic adduct with reduced bond multiplicity. Consequently, unlike condensation reactions, no small molecule species are produced. This permits the formation of high molecular weight species and avoids plasticization. Furthermore, problems plaguing addition polymerization mechanisms such as reactions with water and oxygen are avoided. Despite such inherent advantages and widespread use in small molecule synthesis, cycloadditions have been seldom utilized by the polymer community. The unique reversibility of the Diels-Alder reaction received little mention until 2002, and the Huisgen cycloaddition was not widely utilized until the discovery of its copper catalysis in the same year. This work focuses on the synthesis, mechanisms, and unique attributes of cycloadditions for the fabrication of functional materials. The Diels-Alder reaction was used to synthesize a network polymer with reversible crosslinks. When heated the polymer network depolymerizes and reverts to a liquid. Rheological and spectroscopic measurements demonstrate that the gel point temperature of the material {{is consistent with the}} extent of reaction predicted by the Flory-Stockmayer equation. Furthermore, in the gelled state a relaxation process occurs at the rate of bond cleavage in the material. The addition of magnetically susceptible particles causes the material to heat when placed in an electromagnetic field. The self-limiting nature of this heating process enables the material to achieve its native properties over ten cycles of fracture and repair. The reversible nature of the crosslinks also allows the material to function as a photoresist. The reversibility of the Diels-Alder adducts can be selectively eliminated using masked or focused laser light. Upon depolymerization the unexposed material is removed allowing for the fabrication of arbitrary two and three dimensional objects. The <b>photochemical</b> <b>catalysis</b> of the CuAAC reaction via the radical meditated reduction of Cu(II) was also examined as a method of fabricating cycloaddition polymers. This approach affords comprehensive spatial and temporal control of the CuAAC reaction using standard photolithographic techniques. Advantageously, in this process the CuAAC reaction is the rate determining step, and undesirable side reactions of Cu(I) such as disproportionation, reduction of Cu(I) by radicals, and the reaction of Cu(I) with oxygen are avoided, likely by ligand protection. Such interactions explain the high fidelity of patterning in systems where rapid diffusion of the photogenerated catalyst would otherwise be expected...|$|E
