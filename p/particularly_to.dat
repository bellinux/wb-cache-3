5|$|Five {{of the six}} {{tropical}} cyclones affected land, {{including three}} making landfall with winds of over 74mph (119km/h). The first struck Texas as a hurricane, which caused moderate to heavy damage, <b>particularly</b> <b>to</b> shipping in Matagorda Bay. One death was indirectly related to the hurricane, {{as well as at}} least two injuries.|$|E
5|$|Following Erica's heavy rains, it was {{feared that}} the already {{existing}} dengue fever epidemic would become more widespread. Prior to Erica, there were already 437 cases of dengue fever in 2003 alone. The risk for leptospirosis was also increased by Erica. High winds and strong rains resulted in damages of at least US$15 million, <b>particularly</b> <b>to</b> schools. Two fatalities total were reported {{as a result of}} Erica. The name Erica was retired after the season.|$|E

5|$|Germanicus and Tiberius {{are often}} contrasted by ancient historians, poets who wrote using themes found in drama, with Germanicus playing the tragic hero and Tiberius the tyrant. The {{endurance}} of the Principate is challenged in these narratives, by the emperor's jealous trepidation toward competent commanders such as Germanicus. Attention is paid <b>particularly</b> <b>to</b> their leadership styles, i.e., {{in their relationship}} with the masses. Germanicus is painted as a competent leader able to handle the masses whereas Tiberius is indecisive and envious.|$|E
5|$|In linguistics, R. M. W. Dixon has {{proposed}} a punctuated equilibrium model for language histories, with reference <b>particularly</b> <b>to</b> the prehistory of the indigenous languages of Australia and his objections to the proposed Pamaâ€“Nyungan language family there. Although his model has raised considerable interest, it does not command majority support within linguistics.|$|E
5|$|In northwestern Madagascar, Josie dropped heavy {{rainfall}} and caused widespread flooding. Several towns were isolated, forcing residents to travel by boat. The storm heavily damaged crops in the region, <b>particularly</b> <b>to</b> vanilla. The rains caused rivers to exceed their banks, resulting in flooding up to 3.6m (12ft) deep. Nationwide, at least 36people were killed due to Josie, {{although there were}} initial reports of 500people missing. On Europa Island, Josie produced maximum sustained winds of 130km/h (81mph), with gusts to , before blowing the anemometer away.|$|E

5|$|Inari's kitsune are white, a {{color of}} good omen. They possess {{the power to}} ward off evil, and they {{sometimes}} serve as guardian spirits. In addition to protecting Inari shrines, they are petitioned to intervene {{on behalf of the}} locals and <b>particularly</b> <b>to</b> aid against troublesome nogitsune, those spirit foxes who do not serve Inari. Black foxes and nine-tailed foxes are likewise considered good omens.|$|E
5|$|Lili caused {{extensive}} damage through the Caribbean, <b>particularly</b> <b>to</b> crops and poorly built homes. Mudslides were common {{on the more}} mountainous islands, particularly Haiti and Jamaica. In the United States, the storm cut off the production of oil within the Gulf of Mexico, and caused severe damage in parts of Louisiana. Lili was also responsible for severe damage to the barrier islands and marshes in the southern portion of the state. Total damage amounted to $925million (2002USD), and the storm killed 15people during its existence.|$|E

30|$|The {{results showed}} that {{perspective}} taking was <b>particularly</b> related <b>to</b> accurate recognition of tenderness in music and congruent use of staccato articulation {{for the expression of}} anger through music. Empathic concern was <b>particularly</b> related <b>to</b> congruent use of slow tempo for expressing sadness and loud volume for expressing anger and also correlated with an overall tendency for intensified perception of fear in music. Externalized symptoms were <b>particularly</b> related <b>to</b> incongruent expression of sadness and anger through music: the use of staccato for expressing sadness and dull timbre for expressing anger.|$|R

5|$|Romanticism in Scotland was an artistic, {{literary}} and intellectual movement that developed between {{the late eighteenth}} and the early nineteenth centuries.

Skydivers routinely make adjustments {{to the position of}} their open canopies to compensate for changes in direction while making landings to prevent accidents such as canopy collisions and canopy inversion.|$|E
