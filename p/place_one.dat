5|$|A sequel, , was {{released}} for the Nintendo DS in 2007. It takes <b>place</b> <b>one</b> {{year after the}} events of Final Fantasy XII and follows the adventures of Vaan. The game {{is one of four}} titles in the Ivalice Alliance series, which also includes International Zodiac Job System.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal {{qualified}} automatically {{into the}} Champions League group stage because of England's country coefficient. They were drawn in Group B, along with AIK, Barcelona and Fiorentina. Each club played six matches, with Arsenal registering two victories, two draws and two defeats. This meant they finished in third <b>place,</b> <b>one</b> point behind second place holders Fiorentina, and hence entered {{the third round}} stage of the UEFA Cup.|$|E
5|$|By 1902 {{the guns}} had {{together}} fired 219 rounds, {{though not all}} at full charge with the records showing only 125 effective full charges. The platforms and traverses were scrapped in 1937 but the gun barrels were uneconomic to cut up and were left in <b>place.</b> <b>One</b> gun platform and its equipment was rebuilt in 1997 using money raised by Fort Glanville Historical Association volunteers working at the Australian Grand Prix.|$|E

5|$|Judge Cross {{laid out}} the city's first streets. Cross' home {{was built in the}} late 1840s by Fendal Cason, and Cross {{purchased}} it in 1862. The Cason-Cross House later became Cochran Mortuary. Currently, Mr. Rooter, a plumbing service, occupies the space. There is also a small park named after Cross, located at the same <b>place</b> <b>one</b> of the Indian tribes made its camp.|$|E
5|$|Mega Man 2 takes <b>place</b> <b>one</b> {{year after}} the {{original}} Mega Man. After his initial defeat Dr. Wily, the series' main antagonist, creates his own set of Robot Masters {{in an attempt to}} counter Mega Man: Metal Man, Air Man, Bubble Man, Quick Man, Crash Man, Flash Man, Heat Man, and Wood Man; along with a new fortress and army of robotic henchmen.|$|E
5|$|The 1963 season {{unfolded}} for the Mets {{much like}} the previous year's, though they lost only eight games to begin the season, rather than nine, but they still finished 51–111, in last <b>place.</b> <b>One</b> highlight, though it did not count in the standings, was the Mayor's Trophy Game on June 20 at Yankee Stadium. Stengel played to win; the Yankees under Houk possibly less so, and the Mets beat the Yankees, 6–2.|$|E

5|$|The {{mayor of}} San Francisco is elected every four years; {{elections}} take <b>place</b> <b>one</b> year before United States presidential elections {{on election day}} in November. Candidates must live and be registered to vote in San Francisco {{at the time of}} the election. The mayor is usually sworn in on the January 8 following the election. The next election for the mayor will be in 2019.|$|E
5|$|According to the {{official}} record (read by Thomas Arundel, archbishop of Canterbury, during an assembly of lords and commons at Westminster Hall on Tuesday 30 September), Richard gave up his crown willingly and ratified his deposition citing as a reason his own unworthiness as a monarch. On the other hand, the Traison et Mort Chronicle suggests otherwise. It describes a meeting between Richard and Henry that took <b>place</b> <b>one</b> day before the parliament's session. The king succumbed to blind rage, ordered his release from the Tower, called his cousin a traitor, demanded to see his wife and swore revenge throwing down his bonnet, while the duke refused to do anything without parliamentary approval.|$|E
5|$|Although {{plans for}} further heavy bomber attacks on Tirpitz were {{developed}} throughout 1942, none took <b>place.</b> <b>One</b> {{of the options}} considered was to stage the bombers through a base in the northern Soviet Union, but this was judged impractical as little was known about the suitability of Soviet airfields for heavy bombers at the time. Two squadrons of RAF Coastal Command Handley Page Hampden torpedo bombers operated from Vaenga in northern Russia during mid-September 1942 to counter Tirpitz or any other German warships which attempted to attack Allied convoys, but these aircraft did not {{make contact with the}} enemy.|$|E

5|$|Burial PNT-002 was interred with Burial PNT-003 in {{the third}} stepped {{platform}} of the second version of the Lost World Pyramid (5C-54) prior to the fourth platform being completed. The deceased was an adult male aged between 36 and 55 years old; he was found lying extended on his back with a southeast-northwest orientation. Most of the bones were preserved to a certain degree; although the skull was badly fragmented {{it was evident that}} artificial craneal deformation had taken <b>place.</b> <b>One</b> of the upper canine teeth was fitted with pyrite decoration; the other canine had a crescent-shaped hollow that had once held its decoration. The deceased had several items of shell jewellery.|$|E
5|$|Giovinazzi's {{victories}} {{meant he}} became the first driver since Davide Valsecchi in 2012 to win both races in a GP2 Series race weekend. The race results meant Artem Markelov took over the Drivers' Championship lead with 54 points, while previous leader Norman Nato dropped to second following poor results. Giovinazzi's victory meant he moved to third <b>place,</b> <b>one</b> point ahead of Gasly. Russian Time remained the leaders of the Teams' Championship on 97 points, eight ahead of second-placed Prema Racing. Racing Engineering were in third position on 73 points, with seven rounds left in the season.|$|E
5|$|In a 2007 report, ConnDOT {{outlined}} {{plans to}} turn SLE into a full-service bidirectional regional rail line, with full-day service and all trains extended to New London. This involves incremental improvements, {{similar to those}} that have already been put into <b>place.</b> <b>One</b> of the first priorities is to add a second platform at all stations, which is mandated by the 2003 agreement with Amtrak. New London, Old Saybrook, Guilford, Westbrook, Branford, and stops from New Haven Union Station west all have multiple platforms, while State Street has an island platform serving two tracks with plans for a second platform.|$|E

Against Scully's objections, Hodge and Da Silva try {{to place the}} other worm into Mulder and Hodge realizes that Da Silva is the infected person. He and Mulder restrain the hysterical Da Silva and place the last worm inside her. When they are rescued, Da Silva is quarantined {{and the others are}} released. Although Mulder wants to return to the site, he is told that it has been destroyed by the government.|$|E
5|$|The favoured {{model for}} the enzyme–substrate {{interaction}} is the induced fit model. This model proposes that the initial interaction between enzyme and substrate is relatively weak, but that these weak interactions rapidly induce conformational changes in the enzyme that strengthen binding. These conformational changes also bring catalytic residues in the active site close to the chemical bonds in the substrate that will be altered in the reaction. Conformational changes can be measured using circular dichroism or dual polarisation interferometry. After binding takes <b>place,</b> <b>one</b> or more mechanisms of catalysis lower {{the energy of the}} reaction's transition state by providing an alternative chemical pathway for the reaction. Mechanisms of catalysis include catalysis by bond strain; by proximity and orientation; by active-site proton donors or acceptors; covalent catalysis and quantum tunnelling.|$|E
5|$|A player {{capturing}} a piece immediately passes {{that piece}} to the capturing player's partner. The partner keeps these pieces in reserve and may, instead of playing a regular move, <b>place</b> <b>one</b> of these {{pieces on the}} board (as in shogi and crazyhouse), called dropping the piece. Pieces in reserve or on deck may be dropped on any vacant square, including squares where the piece delivers check or checkmate; however, pawns may not be dropped on the first or last rank. Dropped pawns may promote, but all promoted pawns convert back to pawns when captured. In play over the board, a promoted pawn can be put on its side to indicate promotion. A pawn placed on the second rank may move two squares on its first move. Each player must keep the reserve or stock pieces {{on the table in}} front of the board, always visible to all players of the game.|$|E

5|$|After 1943, {{more of the}} team's {{players were}} drafted into military, and the Yankees ended 1944 in third <b>place,</b> <b>one</b> {{position}} higher than they finished the following season. A group consisting of Larry MacPhail, Dan Topping, and Del Webb bought the Yankees, their stadium, and the franchise's minor league teams for $2,800,000 in 1945. Under the new ownership, Yankee Stadium underwent extensive renovations that included the installation of lights. With the war over {{and the return of}} players from overseas, the Yankees set an MLB single-season home attendance record by attracting 2,265,512 fans in 1946. McCarthy resigned as manager early in the season. The Yankees used two other managers during the year (Bill Dickey and Johnny Neun), and ended 1946 in third place. Catcher Yogi Berra made his Yankees debut that year; in his 18-season career, Berra won the AL MVP Award three times. Bucky Harris was brought in to be the manager, and his 1947 team won the AL pennant and defeated the Dodgers in a seven-game World Series. After the end of the Series, MacPhail sold his share of Yankees ownership to Topping and Webb for $2million.|$|E
5|$|At the 2012 World Championships in Ruhpolding, Neuner won bronze in {{the opening}} mixed relay, {{alongside}} Andrea Henkel, Andreas Birnbacher and Arnd Peiffer. On 3 March 2012, she claimed her 11th world title in the sprint race courtesy of her clean shooting. Neuner dropped to second <b>place</b> <b>one</b> day later in the pursuit, in which Domracheva overtook her at the final shooting bout. During {{the second week of}} the championships, Neuner often struggled with her shooting. She only reached 23rd place in the individual – her worst world championships result ever. With Tina Bachmann, Miriam Gössner and Andrea Henkel she won her second gold medal in Ruhpolding in the women's relay on 10 March 2012, despite incurring a penalty loop. In the concluding mass start, Neuner came in tenth place, with six shooting mistakes in total. Her 12th gold medal made her the second most successful biathlete of all time at world championships, behind male record holder Ole Einar Bjørndalen.|$|E
5|$|By lap 43, Romain Grosjean {{had managed}} to {{overtake}} Verstappen for tenth place. Hamilton started to lose ground on Rosberg, trailing him by 3.4 seconds on lap 44; however, he managed {{to close the gap}} in the succeeding laps. Kimi Räikkönen put in his second stop on lap 47, followed by Vettel's third just one lap later, with Rosberg reacting and changing tyres as well. Hamilton changed tyres on lap 50, and went on to set the fastest lap of the race one lap later. On lap 53, Massa moved ahead of Grosjean into eighth place, but was already reported under investigation for his pre-race tyre temperatures at that point. After serving his penalty, Maldonado managed to overtake Nasr for ninth place on lap 57. Nasr, who was utilizing a two-stop strategy, struggled with his tyres and fell back behind Ricciardo on lap 61. Ricciardo gained another position at Pérez's expense on lap 67, while Verstappen moved into tenth <b>place</b> <b>one</b> lap later, overtaking Maldonado. At the front, Hamilton's tyre started to wear off in the closing stages, enabling Rosberg to take victory 7.7 seconds ahead of his teammate.|$|E
50|$|Protestants {{differ on}} the exact {{relationship}} between faith and knowledge, although all agree that knowledge is normally involved. Roughly, the split is between paedobaptists and baptists, with paedobaptists asserting that faith means <b>placing</b> <b>one's</b> trust in Jesus Christ according to the measure of understanding granted, and baptists asserting faith means <b>placing</b> <b>one's</b> trust in Jesus Christ with a certain minimal core of understanding being necessary.|$|R
