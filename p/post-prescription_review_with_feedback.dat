We estimated {{the impact of a}} standardised review of intravenous antibiotic therapy three days after prescription in two internal medicine wards of a university hospital. In one ward, we assessed the charts of patients under intravenous antibiotic therapy using a standardised review process and provided feedback to the prescriber. There was no intervention in the other ward. After six months we crossed the allocation between the two wards. In all, 204 courses of antibiotic therapy were included in the intervention periods and 226 in the control periods. <b>Post-prescription</b> <b>review</b> led to proposals for modification in 46 % of antibiotic courses. Time to treatment modification was 22 % shorter in the intervention periods compared with the control periods (3. 9 +/- 5. 2 days vs 5. 0 +/- 6. 0 days, P= 0. 007). Patients included in the intervention group had lower antibiotic consumption than patients in the control group, but the intervention had no significant impact on the overall antibiotic consumption of the two wards...|$|R

40|$|This study {{aimed to}} {{determine}} the clinical course of patients {{and the quality of}} antibiotic use using a systematic and unsolicited <b>post-prescription</b> antibiotic <b>review.</b> Seven hundred and fifty-three adult patients receiving antibiotic therapy for 3 - 5 days were randomized to receive either a <b>post-prescription</b> <b>review</b> by the infectious disease physician (IDP), followed by a recommendation to the attending physician to modify the prescription when appropriate, or no systematic review of the prescription. In the intervention group, 63. 3 % of prescriptions prompted IDP recommendations, which were mostly followed by ward physicians (90. 3 %). Early antibiotic modifications were more frequent in the intervention group (57. 1 % vs. 25. 7 %, p < 0. 0001), including stopping therapy, shortening duration and de-escalating broad-spectrum antibiotics. IDP intervention led to a significant reduction of the median [IQR] duration of antibiotic therapy (6 [4 - 9] vs. 7 days [5 - 9], p < 0. 0001). In-hospital mortality, ICU admission and new course of antibiotic therapy rates did not differ between the two groups. Fewer patients in the intervention group were readmitted for relapsing infection (3. 4 % vs. 7. 9 %, p 0. 01). There was a trend for a shorter length of hospital stay in patients suffering from community-acquired infections in the intervention group (5 days [3 - 10] vs. 6 days [3 - 14], p 0. 06).

DESIGN: An exploratory randomised controlled trial. SETTING: Six general practices with prescribing pharmacists in Grampian (3) and East Anglia (3). PARTICIPANTS: Patients on repeat prescribed pain medication (4815) were screened by general practitioners (GPs), and mailed invitations (1397). 196 were randomised and 180 (92 %) completed. Exclusion criteria included: severe mental illness, terminally ill, cancer related pain, history of addiction. RANDOMISATION AND INTERVENTION: Patients were randomised using a remote telephone service to: (1) pharmacist medication <b>review</b> <b>with</b> face-to-face pharmacist prescribing; (2) pharmacist medication <b>review</b> <b>with</b> <b>feedback</b> to GP and no planned patient contact or (3) treatment as usual (TAU). Blinding was not possible. OUTCOME MEASURES: Outcomes were the SF- 12 v 2, the Chronic Pain Grade (CPG), the Health Utilities Index 3 and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Outcomes were collected at 0, 3 and 6 months. RESULTS: In the prescribing arm (n= 70) two patients were excluded/nine withdrew. In the review arm (n= 63) one was excluded/three withdrew. In the TAU arm (n= 63) four withdrew. Compared with baseline, patients had an improved CPG in the prescribing arm, 47. 7 % (21 / 44; p= 0. 003) and in the review arm, 38. 6 % (17 / 44; p= 0. 001), but not the TAU group, 31. 3 % (15 / 48; ns). The SF- 12 Physical Component Score showed no effect in the prescribing or review arms but improvement in TAU (p= 0. 02). The SF- 12 Mental Component Score showed no effect for the prescribing or review arms and deterioration in the TAU arm (p= 0. 002). HADS scores improved within the prescribing arm for depression (p= 0. 022) and anxiety (p= 0. 007), between groups (p= 0. 022 and p= 0. 045, respectively).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To explore {{differences}} in mean costs (from a UK National Health Service perspective) {{and effects of}} pharmacist-led management of chronic pain in primary care evaluated in a pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT), and to estimate optimal sample size for a definitive RCT. DESIGN: Regression analysis of costs and effects, using intention-to-treat and expected value of sample information analysis (EVSI). SETTING: Six general practices: Grampian (3); East Anglia (3). PARTICIPANTS: 125 patients with complete resource use and short form-six-dimension questionnaire (SF- 6 D) data at baseline, 3 months and 6 months. INTERVENTIONS: Patients were randomised to either pharmacist medication <b>review</b> <b>with</b> face-to-face pharmacist prescribing or pharmacist medication <b>review</b> <b>with</b> <b>feedback</b> to general practitioner or treatment as usual (TAU). MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: Differences in mean total costs and effects measured as quality-adjusted life years (QALYs) at 6 months and EVSI for sample size calculation. RESULTS: Unadjusted total mean costs per patient were £ 452 for prescribing (SD: £ 466), £ 570 for review (SD: £ 527) and £ 668 for TAU (SD: £ 1333). After controlling for baseline costs, the adjusted mean cost differences per patient relative to TAU were £ 77 for prescribing (95 % CI - 82 to 237) and £ 54 for review (95 % CI - 103 to 212). Unadjusted mean QALYs were 0. 3213 for prescribing (SD: 0. 0659), 0. 3161 for review (SD: 0. 0684) and 0. 3079 for TAU (SD: 0. 0606). Relative to TAU, the adjusted mean differences were 0. 0069 for prescribing (95 % CI - 0. 0091 to 0. 0229) and 0. 0097 for review (95 % CI - 0. 0054 to 0. 0248). The EVSI suggested the optimal future trial size was between 460 and 690, and between 540 and 780 patients per arm using a threshold of £ 30, 000 and £ 20, 000 per QALY gained, respectively. CONCLUSIONS: Compared with TAU, pharmacist-led interventions for chronic pain appear more costly and provide similar QALYs. However, these estimates are imprecise due to {{the small size of}} the pilot trial. The EVSI indicates that a larger trial is necessary to obtain more precise estimates of differences in mean effects and costs between treatment groups.

40|$|Background Although blended {{learning}} {{has the potential}} to enhance the student experience, both in terms of engagement and flexibility, {{it can be difficult to}} effectively restructure existing courses. To achieve these goals for an introductory Pathology course, offered to more than 250 undergraduate students at UNSW Sydney, we devised a novel approach. Methods For each topic presented over 2 – 3 weeks, a single face-to-face overview lecture was retained. The remaining content that had previously been delivered as conventional lectures was converted into short (12 – 18 min) online modules. These were based on lecture slides with added animations/highlights, plus narration using edited excerpts of previous lecture recordings. The modules also incorporated interactive questions and <b>review</b> quizzes <b>with</b> <b>feedback</b> which used various question types. Modules were developed in PowerPoint and iSpring and uploaded to Moodle as SCORM packages. Each topic concluded with an interactive large-group session focussing on integration of the content, with in-class questions to which students could respond via the Echo 360 Active Learning Platform (ALP). Overall, more than 50 % of face-to-face lecture time was replaced by online modules and interactive large-group sessions. Quantitative evaluation data included usage statistics from 264 students and feedback via online survey responses from 41 students. Qualitative evaluation data consisted of reflective commentaries from 160 student ePortfolios, which were analysed to identify factors affecting learning benefits and user acceptability. Results All of the modules were completed by 74 % of students and on average, 83. 1 % of students eventually passed the optional review quizzes. Notably, 88. 4 % of students responded to in-class questions during the integration and feedback sessions via the ALP. Student reflections emphasised that the modules promoted understanding, which was reinforced through active learning. The modules were described as enjoyable, motivating and were appreciated for their flexibility, which enabled students to work at their own pace.

40|$|Abstract—We {{study the}} cutoff {{rate and the}} average-listsize {{capacity}} of discrete memoryless channels (DMCs) <b>with</b> <b>feedback.</b> We show that feedback can increase the average-listsize capacity but not the cutoff rate. For DMCs with positive zero-error capacity, we show that the average-listsize capacity <b>with</b> <b>feedback</b> {{is equal to the}} cutoff rate. For all other DMCs, we derive a lower bound on the average-listsize capacity <b>with</b> <b>feedback.</b> The bound is asymptotically tight for low-noise channels. We also show that a multi-letter version of Forney’s lower bound on the average-listsize capacity of DMCs without feedback is asymptotically tight. I...|$|R
40|$|In this paper, the {{posterior}} matching scheme proposed by Shayevits and Feder is {{extended to the}} Gaussian broadcast channel <b>with</b> <b>feedback,</b> and the error probabilities and achievable rate region are derived for this coding strategy by using the iterated random function theory. A variant of the Ozarow-Leung code for the general two-user broadcast channel <b>with</b> <b>feedback</b> can be realized as a special case of our coding scheme. Furthermore, for the symmetric Gaussian broadcast channel <b>with</b> <b>feedback,</b> our coding scheme achieves the linear-feedback sum-capacity like the LQG code and outperforms the Kramer code.
