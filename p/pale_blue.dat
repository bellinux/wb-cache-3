5|$|In 2015, NASA {{acknowledged}} the 25th anniversary of <b>Pale</b> <b>Blue</b> Dot.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pale</b> <b>Blue</b> Dot, {{which was}} {{taken with the}} narrow-angle camera, was also {{published}} {{as part of a}} composite picture created from a wide-angle camera photograph showing the Sun and the region of space containing the Earth and Venus. The wide-angle image was inset with two narrow-angle pictures: <b>Pale</b> <b>Blue</b> Dot and a similar photograph of Venus. The wide-angle photograph was taken with the darkest filter (a methane absorption band) and the shortest possible exposure (5 milliseconds), to avoid saturating the camera's vidicon tube with scattered sunlight. Even so, the result was a bright burned-out image with multiple reflections from the optics in the camera and the Sun that appears far larger than the actual dimension of the solar disk. The rays around the Sun are a diffraction pattern of the calibration lamp which is mounted in front of the wide-angle lens.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> {{color of}} the dot {{is the result of}} {{polarization}} and scattering of the light reflected from Earth. The polarization in turn depends on various factors such as cloud cover, exposed areas of oceans, forests, deserts, snow fields etc.|$|E

5|$|The {{street is}} {{referenced}} as a {{property in the}} United Kingdom edition of the board game Monopoly, which features famous London areas on its gameboard, {{it is a part}} of the <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> set, including Pentonville Road and the only space named after a building, The Angel, Islington.|$|E
5|$|After {{taking the}} Family Portrait series of images, which {{included}} <b>Pale</b> <b>Blue</b> Dot, NASA mission managers commanded Voyager 1 to power its cameras down, as the spacecraft {{was not going}} to fly near anything else of significance for the rest of its mission, while other instruments that were still collecting data needed power for the long journey to interstellar space.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of the}} long-toed {{salamander}} is dusky black with a dorsal stripe of tan, yellow, or olive-green. This stripe can also be broken up {{into a series of}} spots. The sides of the body can have fine white or <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> flecks. The belly is dark-brown or sooty in color with white flecks. Root tubercles are present, but they are not quite as developed as other species, such as the tiger salamander.|$|E
25|$|The female {{resembles the}} female {{turquoise}} parrot (N. pulchella) of eastern Australia, {{but can be}} distinguished by the <b>blue</b> lores and <b>paler</b> <b>blue</b> wing patch.|$|R
5000|$|Royal Worcester made figurines, shell vases, wall pockets etc. marking most {{of their}} output with an {{impressed}} crown over rose backstamp, using a distinctive <b>paler</b> <b>blue</b> glaze.|$|R
50|$|Iris 'Sheila Ann Germaney' {{is another}} hybrid between Iris histrioides and Iris winogradowii. It {{is similar to}} 'Katherine Hodgkin', with a <b>paler</b> <b>blue</b> tone and less yellow colouring.|$|R
5|$|Three of {{the frames}} {{received}} showed the Earth as a tiny {{point of light}} in empty space. Each frame had been taken using a different color filter: blue, green and violet, with exposure times of 0.72, 0.48 and 0.72 seconds respectively. The three frames were then recombined to produce the image that became <b>Pale</b> <b>Blue</b> Dot.|$|E
5|$|Voyager 1s Imaging Science Subsystem (ISS), now disabled, {{consisted}} of two cameras: a 200mm focal length, low-resolution wide-angle camera (WA), used for spatially extended imaging, and a 1500mm high-resolution narrow-angle camera (NA) – the one that took <b>Pale</b> <b>Blue</b> Dot – intended for detailed imaging of specific targets. Both cameras were of the slow-scan vidicon tube type and were fitted with eight colored filters, mounted on a filter wheel {{placed in front of}} the tube.|$|E
5|$|Actinium is a soft, silvery-white, radioactive, {{metallic}} element. Its estimated {{shear modulus}} {{is similar to}} that of lead. Owing to its strong radioactivity, actinium glows in the dark with a <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> light, which originates from the surrounding air ionized by the emitted energetic particles. Actinium has similar chemical properties to lanthanum and other lanthanides, and therefore these elements are difficult to separate when extracting from uranium ores. Solvent extraction and ion chromatography are commonly used for the separation.|$|E
5000|$|F. x. flavescens: Central-eastern Peru to E Bolivia. Head and underparts a yellower green than {{nominate}} (though face not as yellow as flavissimus). Rump <b>paler</b> <b>blue,</b> undertail more bluish.|$|R
50|$|The {{orange-bellied parrot}} {{is a small}} parrot around 20 cm long; the adult male has bright green upperparts, and yellow below, a green-blue uppertail with yellow sides, and an orange patch on its belly. It has a prominent, two-toned blue frontal band, with a lighter blue border both {{above and below the}} {{horizontal}} dark blue band. The under wing-coverts and flight feathers are dark <b>blue,</b> with <b>paler</b> <b>blue</b> median wing-coverts. Its iris and beak is dark brown while the feet are a greyish colour. The adult female is a duller green with a <b>paler</b> <b>blue</b> frontal band. The juvenile is a duller green colour.|$|R
60|$|Captain Carlsen {{was a giant}} hulk of a man, with gimlet eyes of <b>palest</b> <b>blue,</b> a slash-scarred {{mouth that}} a blazing red beard could not quite hide, and a grip in his hand that made Frederick squirm.|$|R
5|$|Chemical {{tests are}} {{sometimes}} used to rapidly distinguish between closely related or morphologically similar species of mushrooms, or, in some cases, as characters to group species into subsections of a genus. Pigments {{present in the}} fungal hyphae are dissolved or react differently with various chemicals, and the color reactions {{may be used as}} taxonomic characters. When a drop of 10% aqueous solution of ammonium hydroxide is applied to the cap of B.mirabilis, the tissue turns a fleeting pink color that fades away. If a drop of commercial bleach (calcium hypochlorite) is applied, the tissue loses its color and becomes a <b>pale</b> <b>blue.</b>|$|E
5|$|Cremello or Blue-eyed cream horses have rosy pink skin, <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> {{eyes and}} cream-colored coats, {{indicating}} that pigment cells and pigment {{are present in}} the skin, eyes, and coat, but at lower levels. Dominant white horses do not have pigment cells, and thus no pigment, in the skin or coat. In addition, dominant white horses seldom have blue eyes. Other genetic factors, or combinations of genetic factors, such as the pearl gene or champagne gene, can also produce cremello-like coats. These coat colors may be distinguishable from dominant white by their unusually colored eyes.|$|E
5|$|Iota Trianguli is {{a double}} star whose {{components}} can be separated by medium-sized telescopes into a strong yellow and a contrasting <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> star. Both of these are themselves close binaries. X Trianguli is an eclipsing binary system that ranges between magnitudes 8.5 and 11.2 {{over a period of}} 0.97 days. RW Trianguli is a cataclysmic variable star system composed of a white dwarf primary and an orange main sequence star of spectral type K7 V. The former is drawing off matter from the latter, forming a prominent accretion disc. The system is around 1075 light-years distant.|$|E
60|$|A rangy, gangly, Scandinavian {{youth of}} a sailor, droop-shouldered, six feet six and slender as a lath, with pallid eyes of <b>palest</b> <b>blue</b> and {{skin and hair}} attuned to the same colour scheme, joined Kwaque in his work.|$|R
50|$|Marked sexual {{dimorphism}} {{is observed}} among ronquils. For example, male northern ronquils (Ronquilus jordani) have orange backs with iridescent blue anal fins bordered in black, while the females have olive backs and <b>paler</b> <b>blue</b> anal fins bordered in brown.|$|R
50|$|Woodhouse's scrub jay {{differ in}} plumage (<b>paler</b> <b>blue</b> above, with an indistinct and usually {{incomplete}} breast band) from California scrub jay which are darker blue above with a strongly defined - {{but not necessarily}} complete - blue breast band.|$|R
5|$|Many adult dragonflies have {{brilliant}} iridescent or metallic colours {{produced by}} structural coloration, making them conspicuous in flight. Their overall coloration {{is often a}} combination of yellow, red, brown, and black pigments, with structural colours. Blues are typically created by microstructures in the cuticle that reflect blue light. Greens often combine a structural blue with a yellow pigment. Freshly emerged adults, known as tenerals, are often pale-coloured and obtain their typical colours after a few days, some have their bodies covered with a <b>pale</b> <b>blue,</b> waxy powderiness called pruinosity; it wears off when scraped during mating, leaving darker areas.|$|E
5|$|The {{cephalothorax}} of Z.sexpunctatus is {{bronze to}} black in color. Like all Zygoballus spiders, the cephalothorax is box-like in shape, being widest at the posterior lateral eyes. Numerous white or <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> scales cover the clypeus ("face") and chelicerae. This covering extends around {{the sides of}} the carapace, ending beyond the posterior median eyes. In males, the labium is two-fifths as long as the maxillae, and as wide as it is long. The chelicerae of males are greatly enlarged and obliquely oriented, with each chelicera having a prominent inner tooth and a long, curved fang.|$|E
5|$|By {{the middle}} of the century, the palette had {{expanded}} to include red, black, green, yellow, and gray which signifies different aspects of the earth as defined by different locations of the reservation. Navajo used indigo to obtain shades from <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> to near black and mixed it with indigenous yellow dyes such as the rabbit brush plant to obtain bright green effects. Red was the most difficult dye to obtain locally. Early Navajo textiles use cochineal, an extract from a Mesoamerican beetle, which often made a circuitous trade route through Spain and England {{on its way to the}} Navajo. Reds used in Navajo weaving tended to be raveled from imported textiles. The Navajo obtained black dye through piñon pitch and ashes.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is about 13.5 mm. The ground colour of the forewings is <b>pale</b> lilac <b>blue,</b> with a scattering of white scales in the median area. The hindwings are <b>pale</b> lilac <b>blue,</b> the costa and inner margin dark.|$|R
50|$|A <b>pale</b> grass <b>blue</b> Fairilu.|$|R
50|$|Forpus passerinus viridissimus Found in North Venezuela, Trinidad and Tobago. Also {{known as}} Venezuelan green parrotlet. Like F.p. passerinus, but the male has <b>paler</b> <b>blue</b> markings. The green plumage on {{both males and}} females varies {{significantly}} based on what region they are from.|$|R
5|$|Stream erosion {{has played}} a {{significant}} role in dissecting the mountain range, and many of its peaks are dotted with glaciers. This dissection has resulted in a variety of landforms, such as valleys, crags and domes. Small graveled creeks flow from alpine mountains out onto the regional prairies where there are <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> rock-bottomed lakes, including the so-named Itcha Lake. Three streams drain the Itcha Range, namely Corkscrew Creek, Downton Creek and Shag Creek. Although the Itcha Range has been dissected by stream erosion and subsequently glaciated, its original shape has been largely preserved. Rocks in the Itcha Range are a variety of colours, including red, white and yellow.|$|E
5|$|The common {{starling}} {{has about}} a dozen subspecies breeding in open habitats across its native range in temperate Europe and western Asia, {{and it has been}} introduced to Australia, New Zealand, Canada, United States, Mexico, Peru, Argentina, the Falkland Islands, Brazil, Chile, Uruguay, South Africa and Fiji. This bird is resident in southern and western Europe and southwestern Asia, while northeastern populations migrate south and west in winter within the breeding range and also further south to Iberia and North Africa. The common starling builds an untidy nest in a natural or artificial cavity in which four or five glossy, <b>pale</b> <b>blue</b> eggs are laid. These take two weeks to hatch and the young remain in the nest for another three weeks. There are normally one or two breeding attempts each year. This species is omnivorous, taking a wide range of invertebrates, as well as seeds and fruit. It is hunted by various mammals and birds of prey, and is host to a range of external and internal parasites.|$|E
5|$|The mantle is a vestment or robe worn {{by members}} since the 15th century. Once made of wool, by the 16th century {{it was made}} of velvet. The mantle was {{originally}} purple, but varied during the 17th and 18th centuries between celestial blue, <b>pale</b> <b>blue,</b> royal blue, dark blue, violet, and ultramarine. Mantles are now dark blue and lined with white taffeta. The mantles of the Sovereign, the Prince of Wales, and Royal Knights and Ladies end in trains. The heraldic shield of St. George's Cross encircled by the Garter is sewn onto the left shoulder of the mantle, but the Sovereign's mantle instead has the star of the Order. Attached to the mantle over the right shoulder are a dark red velvet hood and surcoat, which have lost all function over time and appear to the modern observer simply as a splash of colour.|$|E
50|$|David Çiraciyan's {{paintings}} are generally brighter and more colorful than his contemporaries, with a domination of <b>pale</b> <b>blues.</b> It {{has been observed}} Çıraciyan used photographs {{as a basis for}} his settings of his compositions. He also used these photographs directly as a background for his paintings.|$|R
