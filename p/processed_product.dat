Many Americans continued to question whether {{it was safe to}} eat raw tomatoes. However, they were much less hesitant to eat tomatoes as part of a highly <b>processed</b> <b>product</b> that had been cooked and infused with vinegar and spices.|$|E

2500|$|Traditional {{processing}} methods, {{carried out}} by a Jellyfish Master, involve a 20- to 40-day multi-phase procedure in which after removing the gonads and mucous membranes, the umbrella and oral arms are treated {{with a mixture of}} table salt and alum, and compressed. Processing reduces liquefaction, odor, and the growth of spoilage organisms, and makes the jellyfish drier and more acidic, producing a [...] "crunchy and crispy texture." [...] Jellyfish prepared this way retain 7–10% of their original weight, and the <b>processed</b> <b>product</b> contains approximately 94% water and 6% protein. Freshly processed jellyfish has a white, creamy color and turns yellow or brown during prolonged storage.|$|E

40|$|Fresh {{apricot pulp}} and its <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> (bar, chutney, and leather) were {{analyzed}} for physicochemical (moisture content, titrable acidity (TA), ascorbic acid, and percent reducing sugars) and antioxidant properties (2, 2 -diphenyl-l-picrylhydrazyl (DPPH), reducing power, total phenolics, lipid peroxidation, ferric reducing antioxidant potential, and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity). Reducing sugars, TA, and ascorbic acid content {{were found to}} be higher in the <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> than the fresh pulp. A significant difference in the antioxidant properties between the fresh apricot pulp and its <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> was observed. The difference in antioxidant properties between the fresh and the <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> may be attributed to the partial degradation of the bioactive compounds by the action of heat during processing. Among the <b>processed</b> <b>products,</b> apricot bar showed the highest DPPH radical scavenging activity, lipid peroxidation, and hydroxyl radical scavenging activity. Therefore, production of apricot bar could a suitable option for processing of apricots...|$|R

In the UK, The Co-Operative and Marks & Spencer sell only free-range shell eggs and use only free-range eggs in their entire range of baked goods, <b>processed</b> <b>products,</b> and ready-made meals.

40|$|Romania's {{international}} agrifood trade {{increased significantly}} {{during the last}} decade, and mostly after the EU accession. Since 1990, the Romanian agrifood trade balance showed an almost continuous increasing deficit trend until 2008. In four years only, the trend reversed and in 2013, {{for the first time}} in the last two and a half decades, the agrifood trade balance turned positive. The present paper is analyzing the evolution of the trade evolution and its structure, separating the agrifood products in three categories: agricultural commodities, primarily <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> and secondary <b>processed</b> <b>products.</b> A higher ratio of <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> in exports is indicating an increased competitiveness, resulting from higher unit values incorporating more added value, and showing, at the same time, a higher development degree of the country's food industry. The results for total trade show that the <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> represented at most 46 % of the Romanian exports, and at least 63 % of imports, indicating a low-competitive structure of the agrifood trade. The analysis is detailed for intra and extra-EU trade and by main partners and groups of products...|$|R

Observations of each child in an art-room, her/his creative <b>process,</b> <b>product,</b> and the assessment of a 1 / 20 model of the art-room made by each student, were analyzed to form a complete picture of creativity.

50|$|Transcription is when RNA is {{made from}} DNA. During transcription, RNA {{polymerase}} makes {{a copy of a}} gene from the DNA to mRNA as needed.

50|$|One use-category, sour oca, {{contains}} cultivars {{with high}} levels of oxalic acid. Farmers process these tubers to form a usable storage product, called khaya in Quechua.

This process is similar to the preparation of chuñu from bitter potatoes.
