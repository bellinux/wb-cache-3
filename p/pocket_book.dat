5|$|Authentic was <b>pocket</b> <b>book</b> size (7.25 × 4.75inches) {{for most}} of its life, {{changing}} to digest size (7.5 × 5.5inches) for the last eight issues. The issue numbering was consecutive from 1 to 85, with no volume numbers. The first issue had a publication date of 1 January 1951, and the first eight issues had publication dates of the 1st and 15th of each month. From the ninth issue to the end Authentic maintained a completely regular monthly schedule; the publication date was given in the magazine as the 15th of each month from issue 9 through issue 73; thereafter the date was just given as the month and year.|$|E
5|$|The {{major element}} of the reforms was the {{creation}} of an expeditionary force, specifically prepared and trained for intervening in a major war. This had existed before, but it had not been well-prepared for overseas service, and the newly organised force would have a permanent peacetime organisation and a full complement of supporting troops. At the same time, the reserve forces were restructured and expanded to ensure that the overseas forces could be efficiently reinforced and supplied with new recruits. To ensure that home defence would not suffer from sending the regular forces overseas, the Militia formed the Special Reserve and the Volunteer Force and the Yeomanry were reorganised into a new Territorial Force; these latter two reforms were grouped together in the Territorial and Reserve Forces Act 1907. To encourage the development of military skills, an Officer Training Corps was established in public schools and universities. Military strategy was revitalised by a new Imperial General Staff, which would ensure a common doctrine and common strategic aims among the various military forces of the British Empire, including the Dominions as well as British India. Finally, the Regular Army itself would be reformed by {{the development of a new}} operational and training doctrine, laid down in Douglas Haig's new Field Service <b>Pocket</b> <b>Book.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many of the {{paperback}} houses {{that contributed to}} the decline of the genre–Ace, Dell, Avon, among others–were actually started by pulp magazine publishers. They had the presses, the expertise, and the newsstand distribution networks which made the success of the mass-market paperback possible. These pulp-oriented paperback houses mined the old magazines for reprints. This kept pulp literature, if not pulp magazines, alive. The Return of the Continental Op reprints material first published in Black Mask; Five Sinister Characters contains stories first published in Dime Detective; and The <b>Pocket</b> <b>Book</b> of Science Fiction collects material from Thrilling Wonder Stories, Astounding Science Fiction and Amazing Stories. But note that mass market paperbacks are not pulps.|$|E

500|$|British {{official}} historian Brigadier James Edward Edmonds, in 1925, recorded that [...] "The British Army of 1914 was {{the best}} trained, best equipped and best organized British Army ever sent to war". This was {{in part due to}} the Haldane reforms, and the Army itself recognising the need for change and training. Training began with individual training in winter, followed by squadron, company or battery training in spring; regimental, battalion and brigade training in summer; and division or inter-divisional exercises and army manoeuvres in late summer and autumn. The common doctrine of headquarters at all levels was outlined in the Field Service <b>Pocket</b> <b>Book,</b> which Haig had introduced while serving as Director of Staff Studies at the War Office in 1906.|$|E
500|$|With the Essex gang now smashed by the authorities, Turpin turned {{instead to}} the crime he became most noted for— highway robbery. [...] Although {{he may have been}} {{involved}} in earlier highway robberies on 10and12April, he was first identified as a suspect in one event on 10July, as [...] "Turpin the butcher", along with Thomas Rowden, [...] "the pewterer". [...] Several days later the two struck at Epping Forest, depriving a man from Southwark of his belongings. [...] With a further bounty of £100 on their heads they continued their activities through the latter half of 1735. [...] In August they robbed five people accompanying a coach on Barnes Common, and shortly after that they attacked another coach party, between Putney and Kingston Hill. [...] On 20August the pair relieved a Mr Godfrey of six guineas and a <b>pocket</b> <b>book,</b> on Hounslow Heath. [...] Fearing capture, they moved on to Blackheath in Hertfordshire, and then back to London. [...] On 5December the two were seen near Winchester, but in late December, following the capture of John Jones, they separated. [...] Rowden had previously been convicted of counterfeiting, and in July 1736 he was convicted of passing counterfeit coin, under the alias Daniel Crispe. [...] Crispe's true name was eventually discovered and he was transported in June 1738. [...] Jones also suffered transportation, to the Thirteen Colonies.|$|E
