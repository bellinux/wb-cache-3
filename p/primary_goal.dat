5|$|After having {{displaced}} the British as {{the dominant}} outside power following the War of 1812, the United States had {{assumed the role of}} mediator in intertribal disputes. Before the Black Hawk War, U.S. policy discouraged intertribal warfare. This was not strictly for humanitarian reasons: intertribal warfare made it more difficult for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West, a policy known as Indian removal, which had become the <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> by the late 1820s. U.S. efforts at mediation included multi-tribal treaty councils at Prairie du Chien in 1825 and 1830, in which tribal boundaries were drawn. Native Americans sometimes resented American mediation, especially young men, for whom warfare was an important avenue of social advancement.|$|E
5|$|Despite the pursued aim of pan-Germanic unification, the <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> of the German Reich’s {{territorial}} expansionism was {{to acquire}} sufficient Lebensraum (living space) in Eastern Europe for the Germanic übermenschen or superior men. The primary {{objective of this}} aim was to transform Germany into a complete economic autarky, the end-result {{of which would be}} a state of continent-wide German hegemony over Europe. This was to be accomplished through the enlargement of the territorial base of the German state and the expansion of the German population, and the wholesale extermination of the indigenous Slavic inhabitants and the Germanisation of Baltic inhabitants.|$|E

5|$|During the Portuguese Liberal Revolution of 1820, he {{supported}} the constitutionalists, who advocated a national constitution to limit {{the powers of the}} Portuguese monarchy, against the absolutists, who preferred an absolute monarchy. It is unknown whether he actively took part in the uprising, however, and if so, to what degree. Honório Hermeto {{was a member of a}} secret society called A Gruta (The Den), founded by Brazilian students at Coimbra with the <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> of changing Brazil from a monarchy into a republic. His republicanism would fade with time and eventually be replaced by staunch support for monarchism.|$|E
5|$|Following the War of 1812, the United States {{pursued a}} policy of trying to prevent wars among Native Americans in the Upper Mississippi River region. This was not {{strictly}} for humanitarian reasons: intertribal warfare {{made it more difficult}} for the United States to acquire Indian land and move the tribes to the West, a policy known as Indian removal, which had become the <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> by the late 1820s. On August 19, 1825, U.S. officials finalized a multi-tribal treaty at Prairie du Chien, which defined the boundaries of the region's tribes.|$|E
5|$|In 1921, Skagen's Skipper School {{was opened}} to train navigators for both fishing boats and {{merchant}} ships. It {{is now the}} only remaining skipper school in Denmark with some 100 students from the whole of Scandinavia and 15 staff. In 2012, the school moved into new premises close to the Kattegat. In 1955, the folkschool Ankermedets skole was opened on Skagavej, initially with 483 pupils and 16 classes. It has been extended several times over the years, most recently when a new wing was added in 2003. The private school Brovandeskolen, a so-called free school, opened in 1977 for parents wishing to offer their children a new pedagogical approach. A <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> is active cooperation between pupils, teachers and parents.|$|E

5|$|Once {{the flea}} reaches adulthood, its <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> {{is to find}} blood and then to reproduce. Female fleas can lay 5000 or more eggs over their life, {{permitting}} rapid increase in numbers. Generally speaking, an adult flea only lives for 2 or 3 months. Without a host to provide a blood meal, a flea's life can be as short as a few days. Under ideal conditions of temperature, food supply, and humidity, adult fleas can live {{for up to a}} year and a half. Completely developed adult fleas can live for several months without eating, so long as they do not emerge from their puparia. Optimum temperatures for the flea's life cycle are 21°C to 30°C (70°F to 85°F) and optimum humidity is 70%.|$|E
5|$|Players take up {{the roles}} of pilots who fly single-seat spacecraft, trading with merchants on space {{stations}} and planets, and engaging in combat against other vessels. Starting with a small spacecraft in a star system, the player's character explores the region, opening up new systems for further adventures. Each system provides opportunities to increase the pilot's wealth; aside from taking on jobs to ferry goods and hunting for bounties, the player character can engage in trade. The player character's <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> in the game is to accumulate money, so as to buy more advanced weaponry and equipment to upgrade his ship.|$|E
5|$|The FPÖ fared {{much better}} than the BZÖ in polls {{following}} the 2005 split, with the first tests in regional elections in Styria and Burgenland. On 23 April 2005 Heinz-Christian Strache was elected as new chairman of the FPÖ, taking over from interim leader Hilmar Kabas. As most of the party's office-seeking elite had gone over to the BZÖ, the FPÖ was again free from responsibility. Under Strache the party's ideology grew more radical, and it returned to its <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> of vote-maximising. The FPÖ did reasonably well in October's Vienna election, in which Strache was the leading candidate and ran a campaign directed strongly against immigration. It took a 14.9% share, while the BZÖ won just 1.2%.|$|E

It is the largest cultural institution in Slovakia, and manages 16 specialised museums in Bratislava and beyond. The Bratislava City Museum (Múzeum mesta Bratislavy), established in 1868, is the oldest museum in continuous operation in Slovakia. Its <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> is to chronicle Bratislava's history in various forms from the earliest periods using historical and archaeological collections. It offers permanent displays in eight specialised museums.|$|E
5|$|The dam's <b>primary</b> <b>goal,</b> irrigation, was {{postponed}} as the wartime need for electricity increased. The dam's powerhouse began production {{around the time}} World WarII began, and its electricity was vital to the war effort. The dam powered aluminum smelters in Longview and Vancouver, Washington, Boeing factories in Seattle and Vancouver, and Portland's shipyards. In 1943, its electricity was also used for plutonium production in Richland, Washington, at the Hanford Site, {{which was part of}} the top-secret Manhattan Project. The demand for power at that project was so great that in 1943, two generators originally intended for the Shasta Dam were installed at Grand Coulee in an effort to hurry the generator installation schedule.|$|E
5|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> of AMiBA is {{to observe}} both the {{temperature}} and polarization anisotropies in the Cosmic Microwave Background at multipoles between 800 and 8,000 (corresponding to between 2 and 20 arcminutes on the sky), as well as observing the thermal Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect in clusters of galaxies, which has a maximum decrement around 100GHz. In its initial configuration, it measures up to multipoles of 3,000 with a resolution of around 6 arcminutes. The telescope only observes at night during good weather, using planets for calibration.|$|E

5|$|While {{remaining}} upright {{may be the}} <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> {{of beginning}} riders, a bike must lean {{in order to maintain}} balance in a turn: the higher the speed or smaller the turn radius, the more lean is required. This balances the roll torque about the wheel contact patches generated by centrifugal force due to the turn with that of the gravitational force. This lean is usually produced by a momentary steering in the opposite direction, called countersteering. Countersteering skill is usually acquired by motor learning and executed via procedural memory rather than by conscious thought. Unlike other wheeled vehicles, the primary control input on bikes is steering torque, not position.|$|E
5|$|First {{emerging}} in New York City in 2011, the Occupy movement was an international protest movement against {{social and economic}} inequality, its <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> being to make the economic structure and power relations in society more favorable to the underclasses. Different local groups have different foci, but among the prime concerns is the claim that large corporations and the global financial system control {{the world in a}} way that disproportionately benefits a minority, undermines democracy and is unstable. It was widely seen as a reaction to the 2008–2012 global recession, an economic crisis that had led to high unemployment across the western world, and was also inspired by the Arab Spring, in which popular protest movements overthrew the governments of several countries in the Arab world. Chomsky became a supporter for the Occupy movement, joining protesters at some of their camps and advocating their cause in the mainstream press.|$|E
5|$|In Johannesburg in the 1950s, {{crime was}} a day-to-day reality, and Sophiatown was {{the nucleus of}} all reef crimes. Gangsters were city-bred and spoke a mixture of Afrikaans and English, known as tsotsitaal. Some of the more {{well-known}} gangs in Sophiatown were the Russians, the Americans, the Gestapo, the Berliners and the Vultures. The names the Gestapo and the Berliners reflect their admiration for Hitler, whom they saw {{as some kind of}} hero, for taking on the whites of Europe. The best known gang from this period, and also best studied, was the Russians. They were a group of Basotho migrant workers who banded together {{in the absence of any}} effective law enforcement by either mine owners or the state. The <b>primary</b> <b>goal</b> of this gang was to protect members from the tsotsis and from other gangs of migrant workers, and to acquire and defend resources they found desirable - most notably women, jobs and the urban space necessary for the parties and staged fights that formed the bulk of their weekend entertainment.|$|E
