30|$|It is well {{documented}} that older age and low educational attainment (and related factors) generally associate with lower participation in adults job related training (Desjardins et al. 2006; Cedefop 2015 a). However, Table  13 shows that, for upper secondary teachers, a low educational attainment {{plays a significant role}} in this direction only in Italy and Mexico and that an older age is positively associated with non-participation in most but not all countries (Italy, Mexico, Norway and Poland). Similarly, a statistically significant association between higher non participation and a non-stable <b>permanency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> although plausible in a return for investment perspective, was found only in Italy, Denmark and Poland. The “Barriers to professional development” section provides further insights about how a non-stable <b>permanency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> may operate in the Italian context, being associated to higher perception of barriers such as the cost and the lack of pre-requisites. Based on model results for Italy, the characteristics of the context in which teachers work, as measured in TALIS, including the lack of resources for professional development, were not found to have a statistically significant association with (non) participation in teachers professional development. Overall this also held in the other countries: only 2 regression coefficients were found significant out of the 24 which were estimated (for the other 6 countries and the 4 relevant context variables).|$|E
30|$|To qualify key {{descriptive}} {{findings for}} the dimensions under analysis, alongside with the variable indicating the teachers group, {{a number of}} other background variables are also considered. These include: teachers individual characteristics (gender, age, educational attainment, <b>permanency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> intensity of work); characteristics of the context (i.e. the school) in which they work (prevalence of students from disadvantaged homes, prevalence of students with special needs and prevalence of students with a fist language different from that of instruction, with the latter used as a proxy for the minority/migrant background of students). The extent to which the lack of opportunities for teachers’ professional development affects the effectiveness of principals’ work (as declared by the principals) is also considered.|$|E

When controlling for other variables, differences across teachers groups, as captured by the related regression coefficients (Table  20), are no longer statistically significant. Only one factor, having a fixed term contract, was found significantly associated with lower chances to indicate conflict with work schedule as a barrier. This association is plausible: teachers with a fixed term contract tend to suffer the conflict with work-schedule to a lower extent, as they have time for training in between job spells or over the summer, or {{simply because they are}} more likely to indicate other non-time related barriers. This is further discussed below.|$|E

30|$|Logit model {{results for}} the lack of pre-requisites as a binary outcome {{variable}} (Table  18), confirm the existence of those differences across teachers groups. Moreover, based on model results, a set of background characteristics is also found to be significantly associated with the perception of lack of pre-requisites. These include age, gender educational attainment and <b>permanency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>job.</b> In particular, controlling for other factors, teachers with lower educational attainment, those aged 50 + and those having a fixed term contract were found significantly more likely to indicate the lack of pre-requisites as a barrier to professional development. Logit model {{results for the}} barrier of cost (as a binary outcome variable) further confirmed the importance of the permanency of the job: having a fixed term contract is the only factor significantly associated with higher chances to indicate cost as a barrier (Table  19).|$|E
30|$|To better {{investigate}} (non) participation patterns, {{based on}} teachers’ characteristics, further empirical analysis was carried out. Non participation (as a binary outcome variable) was analysed {{by means of}} logistic models, estimated at country level, using the standard set of background variables considered in Table  12 as regressors. Table  13 presents models based results for Italy and other benchmarking countries. Results for Italy confirmed the absence of statistically significant differences in non- participation across the three teachers groups (related regression coefficients were not significant). This also held in most of other countries. 17 In Italy, higher levels of non-participation {{were found to have}} a statistically significant association with a lower educational attainment (ISCED 5 B or below), an age 50 + and a non-stable <b>permanency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> (fixed term contract). These associations were found in other benchmarking countries, but not in all of them and, in any case, not in this combination. In addition, in Italy, these three associations combined with a profile of the teachers population which is characterised, in a cross-country comparison, by relatively high shares of teachers aged 50 +, of teachers with a fixed term contract and of teachers with low educational attainment (Table  15).|$|E
3000|$|Descriptive {{findings}} {{reveal that}} in Italy, teachers of vocational subjects perceived {{the lack of}} employer support {{as an obstacle to}} their professional development significantly more than both groups of teachers of general subjects (i.e. those working in schools with vocational programmes and those working in schools with no vocational programmes). Moderate and statistically significant differences by 10 and 9 % points were respectively found (Tables  10, 11). The lack of employer support (as an outcome binary variable) has been further analysed by means of a logistic regression model, implemented at country level and using the standard set of background variables presented in Table  12 as regressors. Model based results for Italy (Table  17) have not provided further useful insights. They partly confirmed descriptive findings: when controlling for other variables, teachers of vocational subjects tend to suffer the lack of employer support more than teachers of general subjects, but significant differences were found only with respect to teachers of general subjects working in schools with VET programmes. Other factors, including a non-stable <b>permanency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> plausible in a return for investment perspective, do not seem to have a considerable influence on a perceived lack of employer support. 19 [...]...|$|E

30|$|When {{considering}} barriers {{related to}} family responsibilities (as an outcome binary variable), {{results of the}} logistic regression model for Italy confirmed descriptive findings: differences across teachers groups, as captured by the related regression coefficients, remained significant. Moreover, based on model results (Table  21), the perception of barriers related to family responsibility {{was found to have}} a statistically significant association also with gender (higher perception for women), age (lower perception for older teachers), <b>permanency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> (lower perception for teachers with fixed term contract) and intensity of work (higher perception for part-time workers). This is well plausible. For social and demographic reasons, older workers and male workers (particularly in Italy) were expected to have smaller family responsibilities and therefore to indicate them as an obstacle less frequently than their counterparts. 20 Having a fixed term contract has an impact on the perception of non-time related barrier (cost and pre-requisites), reducing the importance of family responsibilities as a possible obstacle. On the contrary, part-time work, is often a consequence of important family responsibilities and this may be the reason why part time workers report family responsibility as an obstacle more than others. These relations combines with a profile of teachers of vocational subjects which in Italy is characterised by relatively higher shares of males and of those with a fixed term contract when compared to teachers of general subjects.|$|E
30|$|In particular, {{findings}} reveal that, {{in absolute}} and cross-country comparative terms, teachers of vocational subjects in Italy felt a particularly strong need {{for professional development}} {{in the domain of}} new technologies in the workplace. However, in almost all domains of competence which were surveyed and analysed, their needs were found considerably high, and significantly higher than in most of other benchmarking countries. These also include the domain of students’ behaviour and classroom management, where, In Italy, the level of their needs for professional development was similar to those of teachers of general subjects working in the same schools, but significantly higher than those estimated for teachers of general subjects working in schools without VET programmes. Teachers of vocational subjects in Italy were found to have by cross country comparisons, not only higher level of needs, but also a lower participation in professional development. Levels of participation were not remarkably different as compared to those of teachers of general subjects in the country. This held in Italy and, overall, in the other benchmarking systems, where participation was however higher for all different groups of teachers. Teachers of vocational subjects in Italy tended to perceive the existence of barriers to their professional development more than in other countries, with the most remarkable access barriers, in absolute and cross-country comparative terms, being related to the absence of incentives and the unavailability of relevant offers. However they also identified other ones, in remarkable proportions, including the lack of employer support, the cost and the absence of pre-requisites, which, in Italy, affected teachers of vocational subjects more than teachers of general subjects (with statistically significant differences). Time related factors (conflict with schedule and family responsibilities) were also considered to be influential, but less than for teachers of general subjects. Descriptive findings should be qualified and interpreted, also considering the different background characteristics of the teachers groups, in Italy and across countries. Particular regard should be given to teachers age, gender, educational attainment, <b>permanency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>job</b> and the characteristics of their students. Indeed, in a comparative perspective, the profile of teachers of vocational subjects in Italy is found to be characterised by relatively high percentages of male and older teachers, as well as of teachers with low educational attainment, working with a fixed term contract and in schools with a considerable prevalence of students with a first language different from that of instruction (used as a proxy for students with minority/migrant background). These characteristics are found to be related to key findings, although in different ways, through statistically significant associations emerging from logit regression models.|$|E
40|$|The {{transition}} {{from school to}} work is a phase of life in which young people are introduced {{to the world of}} labour. This transition process is often far from smooth and it can be characterized as a turbulent and precarious period (OECD 1998; Kerckhoff 2000). First of all, the {{transition from}} school to work refers to a process in which young people face periods of unemployment quite often and end up frequently in jobs that do not match their education very well. Secondly, the transition from school to work can not be considered as a single event from full-time initial education to stable full-time employment (see Scherer 2001). Instead, the labour market entry of young people should be described as a complex and prolonged allocation process, of which it is hard to define at what point it really starts and when it exactly ends (OECD 1996, 2000). Often, there is some kind of gradual labour market entry, where young people combine their studies with work. This is partly the result of pupils participating in apprenticeship programmes, but also because of students having (part-time) jobs. Moreover, the recent attention for lifelong learning as a continuous investment in human capital during the working career has blurred the transition process. In this paper we aim to provide insight in the extent, structure, and recent development of combinations of learning and working among young people within the European Union. Three types of ‘double statuses’ are distinguished: young people who combine learning and working in the dual system, full-time students who have jobs, and employed individuals who invest in training to advance their working career. The analysis of these double status positions offers the opportunity to look in detail at how the pathways from school to work are organized in different institutional contexts of Europe. This should lead {{to a better understanding of}} the trajectories of young people from initial education to a stable position in the labour force. In addition, we look at some labour market outcomes of young people that are in a double status position. The aim is to shed some more light on the issue whether or not a double status position serves as a stepping stone towards stable employment. For that reason, we investigate to what extent double status positions go together with specific job characteristics that differ from the employment situation of those who are regular employed and whether there are institutional differences in this respect. The paper is structured as follows. In the second section we derive some hypotheses on differences in the occurrence of double status positions among young people in the European Union. The third describes the data and variables to be used in measuring double statuses. The fourth presents the occurrence of double status positions among young people in different institutional contexts of Europe. The fifth looks at three characteristics of the jobs held by young people who combine learning and working: the <b>permanency</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>job,</b> the distinction between full-time and part-time work, and the occupational status attained.
