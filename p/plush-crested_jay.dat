50|$|The <b>plush-crested</b> <b>jay</b> (Cyanocorax chrysops) is a jay of {{the family}} Corvidae (which {{includes}} the crows and their many allies). It is found in central-southern South America: in southwestern Brazil, Bolivia, Paraguay, Uruguay, and northeastern Argentina, including southern regions of the Amazon Basin river systems bordering the Pantanal.|$|E
50|$|The {{range of}} the <b>plush-crested</b> <b>jay</b> extends from the Southern Region, Brazil with Uruguay and {{approaches}} the South Atlantic coast, but avoids the coast, approximating a 400 to 150 km coastal strip; the coastal-inland range extends 3500 km from São Paulo south to Rio Grande do Sul bordering Uruguay. The inland range continues in northwestern Uruguay and extends northwest through northern Argentina, Paraguay-Bolivia, and through the Pantanal at the southern Cerrado; the range extends in two arms, to the northwest to northern Bolivia, and northeastwards to headwaters of the Amazon Basin Tapajós River.|$|E
40|$|The {{predation}} on vertebrates by birds, including bats, is {{very common}} in some families (Accipitridae, Falconidae, Tytonidae, Strigidae), constituting their main diet. For other families (except those that feed strictly on fish), it is occasional and sometimes a matter of opportunity. Here we recorded the predation on a bat (Platyrrhinus lineatus) by the neotropical bird <b>plush-crested</b> <b>jay</b> (Cyanocorax chrysops). on July 26, 2009, around 11 : 00 am, we recorded an individual of C. chrysops taking part of a P. lineatus on its beak. This record occurred on Jacarezinho Farm (Valparaiso [long dash] SP). The prey species identification was done by visual observation, considering the bat size and its external morphology, especially {{by the presence of}} the white dorsal bright stripe. Probably, Platyrrhinus lineatus behavior, which involves living together or in couples on tree canopies, made the capture by the <b>plush-crested</b> <b>jay</b> easier. This is a new record for the diet of C. chrysops and highlights the necessity of additional studies related to birds diet in the Neotropics, even the more conspicuous ones...|$|E
