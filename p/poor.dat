5|$|English <b>Poor</b> Law {{legislation}} can {{be traced}} back as far as 1536, when legislation was passed to deal with the impotent <b>poor,</b> although there is much earlier Tudor legislation dealing with the problems caused by vagrants and beggars. The history of the <b>Poor</b> Law in England and Wales is usually divided between two statutes, the Old <b>Poor</b> Law passed during the reign of Elizabeth I and the New <b>Poor</b> Law, passed in 1834, which significantly modified the existing system of <b>poor</b> relief. The later statute altered the <b>Poor</b> Law system from one which was administered haphazardly at a local parish level to a highly centralised system which encouraged the large-scale development of workhouses by <b>Poor</b> Law Unions.|$|E
5|$|For {{persistent}} {{low back}} pain, the short-term outcome is also positive, with {{improvement in the}} first six weeks but very little improvement after that. At one year, those with chronic low back pain usually continue to have moderate pain and disability. People at higher risk of long-term disability include those with <b>poor</b> coping skills or with fear of activity (2.5 {{times more likely to have}} <b>poor</b> outcomes at one year), those with a <b>poor</b> ability to cope with pain, functional impairments, <b>poor</b> general health, or a significant psychiatric or psychological component to the pain (Waddell's signs).|$|E
5|$|In London, {{there was}} a great massing of the <b>poor,</b> and the Reformation {{threatened}} to eliminate some of the infrastructure used to provide for the <b>poor.</b> As a result, King Henry VIII consented to re-endow St. Bartholomew's Hospital in 1544 and St. Thomas’ Hospital in 1552 on the condition that the citizens of London pay for their maintenance. However, the city was unable to raise enough revenue from voluntary contributions, so it instituted the first definite compulsory <b>Poor</b> Rate in 1547 which replaced Sunday collections in Church with a mandatory collection for the <b>poor.</b> In 1555, London became increasingly concerned with the number of <b>poor</b> who could work, but yet could not find work, so it established the first House of Correction (predecessor to the workhouse) in the King’s Palace at Bridewell where <b>poor</b> could receive shelter and work at cap-making, feather-bed making, and wire drawing.|$|E

5|$|Parishes {{arose from}} Church of England divisions, and were {{originally}} purely ecclesiastical divisions. Over time they acquired civil administration powers. The Highways Act 1555 made parishes {{responsible for the}} upkeep of roads. Every adult inhabitant of the parish was obliged to work four days {{a year on the}} roads, providing their own tools, carts and horses; the work was overseen by an unpaid local appointee, the Surveyor of Highways. The <b>poor</b> were looked after by the monasteries, until their dissolution. In 1572, magistrates were given power to 'survey the poor' and impose taxes for their relief. This system was made more formal by the <b>Poor</b> Law Act 1601, which made parishes responsible for administering the <b>Poor</b> Law; overseers were appointed to charge a rate to support the <b>poor</b> of the parish. The 19th century saw an increase in the responsibility of parishes, although the <b>Poor</b> Law powers were transferred to <b>Poor</b> Law Unions. The Public Health Act 1872 grouped parishes into Rural Sanitary Districts, based on the <b>Poor</b> Law Unions; these subsequently formed the basis for Rural Districts. Parishes were run by vestries, meeting annually to appoint officials, and were generally identical to ecclesiastical parishes, although some townships in large parishes administered the <b>Poor</b> Law themselves; under the Parishes Act 1882, all extra-parochial areas and townships that levied a separate rate became independent civil parishes.|$|E
5|$|<b>Poor</b> white {{farmers and}} black slaves ate much more humble fare and were quicker to {{incorporate}} American and African foodstuffs and flavorings. The food of <b>poor</b> {{whites in the}} 17th century was similar to soul food of the 20th century. Overall, both rich and <b>poor</b> southerners ate spicier and more pungent food than elsewhere in the early colonies, and feasting was {{an important part of}} life for all social classes.|$|E
5|$|The Old <b>Poor</b> Law was {{a parish}} based system, there were around 15,000 such parishes {{based upon the}} area around a parish church. The system allowed for despotic {{behavior}} from the Overseers of the <b>Poor</b> but as Overseers of the <b>Poor</b> would know their paupers they were considered able to differentiate between the deserving and undeserving <b>poor</b> making the system both more humane and initially more efficient. The Elizabethan <b>Poor</b> Law operated {{at a time when}} the population was small enough for everyone to know everyone else, therefore people's circumstances would be known and the idle <b>poor</b> would be unable to claim on the parishes' <b>poor</b> rate. The system provided social stability yet by 1750 needed to be adapted to cope with population increases, greater mobility and regional price variations.|$|E

5|$|The {{introduction}} of the New <b>Poor</b> Law also resulted in opposition. Some who gave evidence to the Royal Commission into the Operation of the <b>Poor</b> Laws suggested that the existing system had proved adequate and was more adaptable to local needs. This argument was strongest in the industrial North of England and in the textile industries where outdoor relief was a more effective method of dealing with cyclical unemployment {{as well as being}} a more cost-effective method. <b>Poor</b> Law commissioners faced greatest opposition in Lancashire and the West Riding of Yorkshire where in 1837 there was high unemployment during an economic depression. The New <b>Poor</b> Law was seen as interference from Londoners with little understanding of local affairs. Opposition was unusually strong because committees had already been formed in opposition to the Ten Hours Movement, leaders of the Ten Hours campaign such as Richard Oastler, Joseph Rayner Stephens and John Fielden became the leaders of the Anti-Poor Law campaign. The Book of Murder was published and was aimed at creating opposition to the workhouse system. and pamphlets were published spreading rumour and propaganda about <b>Poor</b> Law Commissioners and alleged infanticide inside of workhouses. Opposition to the <b>Poor</b> Law yielded some successes in delaying the development of workhouses, and one workhouse in Stockport was attacked by a crowd of rioters. As many Boards of Guardians were determined to continue under the old system, the <b>Poor</b> Law Commission granted some boards the right to continue providing relief under the Old <b>Poor</b> Law. However, the movement against the New <b>Poor</b> Law was short-lived, leading many to instead turn towards Chartism.|$|E
5|$|The {{origins of}} the English <b>Poor</b> Law system {{can be traced back}} to late medieval {{statutes}} dealing with beggars and vagrancy but it was only during the Tudor period that the <b>Poor</b> Law system became codified. Monasteries, the primary source of <b>poor</b> relief, were dissolved by the Tudors Reformation causing <b>poor</b> relief to move from a largely voluntary basis to a compulsory tax that was collected at a parish level. Early legislation was concerned with vagrants and making the able-bodied work, especially while labour was in short supply following the Black Death.|$|E

5|$|A workhouse {{was built}} in Lurgan and opened in 1841 under the stipulations of the <b>Poor</b> Law which stated that each <b>Poor</b> Law Union would build a workhouse to give relief to the {{increasing}} numbers of destitute <b>poor.</b> In 1821 the population of Lurgan was 2,715, this increased to 4,677 by 1841. There {{were a couple of}} reasons for this large growth in population. Firstly the opportunities provided by the booming linen industry led many to abandon their meagre living in rural areas and migrate to Lurgan in the hope of gaining employment. Secondly the ever-expanding town gave tradesmen the opportunity to secure work in the construction of new buildings such as Brownlow House.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThis study {{investigated}} age-related differences in electrophysiological signatures of sequential modulations of <b>poorer</b> strategy effects. Sequential modulations of <b>poorer</b> strategy effects refer to decreased <b>poorer</b> strategy effects (i. e., <b>poorer</b> performance when the cued strategy {{is not the}} best) on current problem following <b>poorer</b> strategy problems compared to after better strategy problems. Analyses on electrophysiological (EEG) data revealed important age-related changes in time, frequency, and coherence of brain activities underlying sequential modulations of <b>poorer</b> strategy effects. More specifically, sequential modulations of <b>poorer</b> strategy effects were associated with earlier and later time windows (i. e., between 200 - and 550 ms and between 850 - and 1250 ms). Event-related potentials (ERPs) also revealed an earlier onset in older adults, together with more anterior and less lateralized activations. Furthermore, sequential modulations of <b>poorer</b> strategy effects were associated with theta and alpha frequencies in young adults while these modulations were found in delta frequency and theta inter-hemispheric coherence in older adults, consistent with qualitatively distinct patterns of brain activity. These findings have important implications to further our understanding of age-related differences and similarities in sequential modulations of cognitive control processes during arithmetic strategy execution.
