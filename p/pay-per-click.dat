25|$|Affiliates {{were among}} the {{earliest}} adopters of pay per click advertising when the first <b>pay-per-click</b> search engines emerged during {{the end of the}} 1990s. Later in 2000 Google launched its pay per click service, Google AdWords, which is responsible for the widespread use and acceptance of pay per click as an advertising channel. An increasing number of merchants engaged in pay per click advertising, either directly or via a search marketing agency, and realized that this space was already occupied by their affiliates. Although this situation alone created advertising channel conflicts and debates between advertisers and affiliates, the largest issue concerned affiliates bidding on advertisers names, brands, and trademarks. Several advertisers began to adjust their affiliate program terms to prohibit their affiliates from bidding on those type of keywords. Some advertisers, however, did and still do embrace this behavior, {{going so far as to}} allow, or even encourage, affiliates to bid on any term, including the advertiser's trademarks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pay-per-click,</b> {{along with}} cost per {{impression}} and cost per order, {{are used to}} assess the cost effectiveness and profitability of internet marketing. <b>Pay-per-click</b> has an advantage over cost per impression in that it tells us something about how effective the advertising was. Clicks are a way to measure attention and interest. If the main purpose of an ad is to generate a click, or more specifically drive traffic to a destination, then <b>pay-per-click</b> is the preferred metric. Once a certain number of web impressions are achieved, the quality and placement of the advertisement will affect click through rates and the resulting <b>pay-per-click.</b>|$|E
