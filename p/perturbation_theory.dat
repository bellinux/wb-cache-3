5|$|As {{described}} by quantum chromodynamics, {{the strong interaction between}} quarks is mediated by gluons, massless vector gauge bosons. Each gluon carries one color charge and one anticolor charge. In the standard framework of particle interactions (part {{of a more}} general formulation known as <b>perturbation</b> <b>theory),</b> gluons are constantly exchanged between quarks through a virtual emission and absorption process. When a gluon is transferred between quarks, a color change occurs in both; for example, if a red quark emits a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes green, and if a green quark absorbs a red–antigreen gluon, it becomes red. Therefore, while each quark's color constantly changes, their strong interaction is preserved.|$|E
5|$|In {{quantum field}} theory, one {{typically}} computes the probabilities of various physical events using {{the techniques of}} <b>perturbation</b> <b>theory.</b> Developed by Richard Feynman {{and others in the}} first half of the twentieth century, perturbative quantum field theory uses special diagrams called Feynman diagrams to organize computations. One imagines that these diagrams depict the paths of point-like particles and their interactions. Although this formalism is extremely useful for making predictions, these predictions are only possible when the strength of the interactions, the coupling constant, is small enough to reliably describe the theory as being close to a theory without interactions.|$|E
5|$|Partly {{as a way}} {{to bring}} {{publicity}} to progress in physics, Feynman offered $1,000 prizes for two of his challenges in nanotechnology; one was claimed by William McLellan and the other by Tom Newman. He {{was also one of the}} first scientists to conceive the possibility of quantum computers. In 1984–86, he developed a variational method for the approximate calculation of path integrals, which has led to a powerful method of converting divergent perturbation expansions into convergent strong-coupling expansions (variational <b>perturbation</b> <b>theory)</b> and, as a consequence, to the most accurate determination of critical exponents measured in satellite experiments.|$|E

5|$|The {{starting}} point for string theory {{is the idea that}} the point-like particles of quantum field theory can also be modeled as one-dimensional objects called strings. The interaction of strings is most straightforwardly defined by generalizing the <b>perturbation</b> <b>theory</b> used in ordinary quantum field theory. At the level of Feynman diagrams, this means replacing the one-dimensional diagram representing the path of a point particle by a two-dimensional surface representing the motion of a string. Unlike in quantum field theory, string theory does not yet have a full non-perturbative definition, so many of the theoretical questions that physicists would like to answer remain out of reach.|$|E
25|$|Time-independent <b>perturbation</b> <b>theory</b> {{is one of}} two {{categories}} of <b>perturbation</b> <b>theory,</b> the other being time-dependent perturbation (see next section). In time-independent <b>perturbation</b> <b>theory</b> the perturbation Hamiltonian is static (i.e., possesses no time dependence). Time-independent <b>perturbation</b> <b>theory</b> was presented by Erwin Schrödinger in a 1926 paper, shortly after he produced his theories in wave mechanics. In this paper Schrödinger referred to earlier work of Lord Rayleigh, who investigated harmonic vibrations of a string perturbed by small inhomogeneities.

40|$|QCD-like {{theories}} {{possess a}} positively definite fermion determinant at finite baryon chemical potential $\mu_{\text B}$ and the lattice simulation can be successfully performed. While the chiral <b>perturbation</b> <b>theories</b> are sufficient {{to describe the}} Bose condensate at low density, to describe the crossover from Bose-Einstein condensation (BEC) to BCS superfluidity at moderate density we should use some fermionic effective model of QCD, such as the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model. In this paper, using two-color two-flavor QCD as an example, we examine how the Nambu-Jona-Lasinio model describes the weakly interacting Bose condensate at low density and the BEC-BCS crossover at moderate density. Near the quantum phase transition point $\mu_{\text B}=m_\pi$ ($m_\pi$ is the mass of pion/diquark multiplet), the Ginzburg-Landau free energy at the mean-field level {{can be reduced to}} the Gross-Pitaevskii free energy describing a weakly repulsive Bose condensate with a diquark-diquark scattering length identical to that predicted by the chiral <b>perturbation</b> <b>theories.</b> The Goldstone mode recovers the Bogoliubov excitation in weakly interacting Bose condensates. The results of in-medium chiral and diquark condensates predicted by chiral <b>perturbation</b> <b>theories</b> are analytically recovered. The BEC-BCS crossover and meson Mott transition at moderate baryon chemical potential as well as the beyond-mean-field corrections are studied. Part of our results can also be applied to real QCD at finite baryon or isospin chemical potential. Comment: 29 pages + 9 figures. Published version in PR...|$|R

For arbitrary Ω and Λ, I present accurate fitting formula which are sufficient in practice for the observational cosmology.

Progress of Theoretical Physics (Letters), in pressThe gravitational instability presumably plays {{an essential role in}} the formation of the large-scale structure of the universe. The dynamics of such interesting phenomena involves the nonlinearity which is difficult to deal with. Any exact solution for nonlinear evolution is not known in general situation. We have been mainly resorted to N-body methods for fully nonlinear problems in this field. Although such methods can shed light on strongly nonlinear regime, the resolution is fairly limited and they can barely survey only small fraction of parameter space of possible models.
