They are increased in psoriatic lesions and induce the proliferation of T cells and type 1 helper T cells (Th1). Targeted immunotherapy as well as <b>psoralen</b> and ultraviolet A (PUVA) therapy can {{reduce the number of}} dendritic cells and favors a Th2 cell cytokine secretion pattern over a Th1/Th17 cell cytokine profile. Psoriatic T cells move from the dermis into the epidermis and secrete interferon-γ and interleukin-17. Interleukin-23 is known to induce the production of interleukin-17 and interleukin-22. Interleukin-22 works in combination with interleukin-17 to induce keratinocytes to secrete neutrophil-attracting cytokines.|$|E

50|$|<b>Psoralens</b> are {{materials}} {{that make the}} skin more sensitive to UV light. They are photosensitizing agents and are found in plants naturally and also manufactured synthetically. <b>Psoralens</b> are taken as pills (systemically) or can be applied directly to the skin, by soaking the skin in a solution that contains the <b>psoralens.</b> They allow UVA energy to be effective at lower doses. When combined with exposure to the UVA in PUVA, <b>psoralens</b> are highly effective at clearing psoriasis and vitiligo. In the case of vitiligo, they work by increasing the sensitivity of melanocytes, the cells that manufacture skin color, to UV light. Melanocytes have sensors that detect UV light and trigger the manufacture of brown skin color. This color protects the body from {{the harmful effects of}} UV light. It can also be connected to the skin's immune response.|$|R
25|$|Ultraviolet {{radiation}} is helpful {{in the treatment}} of skin conditions such as psoriasis and vitiligo. Exposure to UVA, while the skin is hyper-photosensitive, by taking <b>psoralens</b> is an effective treatment for psoriasis. Due to the potential of <b>psoralens</b> to cause damage to the liver, PUVA therapy may be used {{only a limited number of}} times over a patient's lifetime.|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT: 403 {{cases of}} {{vitiligo}} were studied with relation to age, sex, social status, geographic area of origin, occupation, educational status, food habits including alcohol intake, duration of vitiligo, {{family history of}} vitiligo, associated dermatological disorders, associated systemic diseases, size, shape, symmetry and distribution pattern of vitiligo lesions. Investigations revealed associated systemic diseases in 94 and dermatological disorders in 34 patients. Patients were treated with different drug regimens which included topical and systemic <b>psoralens,</b> topical and systemic steroids, combination of <b>psoralens</b> and steroids, systemic cyclophosphamide, systemic zinc therapy and placental extract application. Best results were achieved by combination of systemic <b>psoralens,</b> systemic and topical steroids. 332 patients were followed up out of which 217 recovered.

50|$|Since sunburn and suntan are {{induced by}} the same {{mechanism}} (direct DNA damage), these substances increase the likelihood for sunburn as well. The best known tanning activator is <b>psoralen</b> which is an ingredient of bergamot oil. <b>Psoralen</b> has been present in sunscreens {{in order to allow}} suntanning despite the reduced UV-intensity that acts on the deeper layers of the skin. In Switzerland, a ban was imposed on <b>psoralen</b> containing sunscreens in 1987 but it was loosely enforced for several years. In other countries these substances have been present in sunscreens until the first epidemiological results have shown that users have a fourfold risk of developing melanoma. They were finally banned in 1996. This happened more than 15 years after the photocarcinogenic potential of <b>psoralen</b> had been demonstrated.After the evidence for the photocarcinogenic potential of <b>psoralen</b> emerged, sunscreens which combined UVB filters and <b>psoralen</b> were introduced onto the market. These products were accompanied by campaigns to convince the public and the regulatory authorities that these products were safe or even better than usual sunscreens. These sunscreens were especially recommended to poor tanners.Psoralen tanning lotions were available in France, Belgium and Greece.|$|E

5000|$|Without the {{presence}} of these rays, the photosensitiser is not harmful. For this reason, this form of contact dermatitis is usually associated only with areas of skin which are left uncovered by clothing, and it can be soundly defeated by avoiding exposure to sunlight. [...] The mechanism of action varies from toxin to toxin, but is usually due to the production of a photoproduct. Toxins which are associated with PCD include the <b>psoralens.</b> <b>Psoralens</b> are in fact used therapeutically for the treatment of psoriasis, eczema, and vitiligo.|$|R

50|$|At {{the very}} least for vitiligo, {{narrowband}} ultraviolet B (UVB) phototherapy is now used more commonly than PUVA since {{it does not require}} the use of the <b>psoralen.</b> As with PUVA, treatment is carried out twice weekly in a clinic or every day at home, and {{there is no need to}} use <b>psoralen.</b>|$|E
50|$|The biosynthetic route then {{continues}} with the activation of dimethylallyl pyrophosphate (DMAPP), produced via the mevalonate pathway, {{to form a}} carbo-cation via the cleavage of the diphosphates. Once activated, the enzyme umbelliferone 6-prenyltransferase catalyzes a C-alkylation between DMAPP and umbelliferone at the activated position ortho to the phenol, yielding demethylsuberosin. This is then followed by a hydroxylation catalyzed by the enzyme marmesin synthase to yield marmesin. Another hydroxylation is catalyzed by <b>psoralen</b> synthase to yield <b>psoralen.</b> A third hydroxylation by the enzyme <b>psoralen</b> 8-monooxygenase yields xanthotoxol which {{is followed by a}} methylation via the enzyme xanthotoxol O-methyltransferase and S-adenosyl methionine to yield methoxsalen.|$|E
50|$|<b>Psoralen</b> (also called psoralene) is {{the parent}} {{compound}} {{in a family}} of natural products known as furocoumarins. It is structurally related to coumarin by the addition of a fused furan ring, and may be considered as a derivative of umbelliferone. <b>Psoralen</b> occurs naturally in the seeds of Psoralea corylifolia, {{as well as in the}} common fig, celery, parsley, West Indian satinwood and in all citrus fruits. It is widely used in PUVA (<b>psoralen</b> + UVA) treatment for psoriasis, eczema, vitiligo, and cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. Many furocoumarins are extremely toxic to fish, and some are deposited in streams in Indonesia to catch fish.|$|E
5000|$|P. corylifolia {{has been}} implicated {{in at least one}} case of severe {{hepatotoxicity}} in a 64-year-old woman who self-medicated with a variety of Aryuvedic herbs for her vitiligo.

40|$|The {{combination}} of <b>psoralens</b> and ultraviolet light (UVA, 320 - 400 nm), {{also referred to}} as PUVA, is a potent modulator of epidermal cell growth and differentiation. Although it has been postulated that PUVA exerts its actions by binding to DNA, our laboratory has obtained evidence that a specific, saturable, high-affinity receptor site independent of the DNA mediates the biologic actions of these drugs. This receptor is a 22, 000 molecular weight protein present in membrane and cytoplasmic fractions of responsive cell types. Treatment of cells with <b>psoralens</b> followed by UV light causes activation of the receptor. This leads to specific cell surface membrane alterations, in particular, phosphorylation of the receptor for epidermal growth factor (EGF). The EGF receptor is a transmembrane glycoprotein possessing intrinsic tyrosine kinase activity. Modification of the EGF receptor leads to a loss in its ability to bind EGF, as well as an inhibition of its tyrosine kinase activity. These data indicate that the <b>psoralens</b> act {{at the level of the}} cell membrane and that their biologic effects in the skin may be mediated by the ability of these drugs to disrupt normal growth factor functions...|$|R
40|$|A new tetracyclic derivative, difurocoumarin, was {{synthesized}} {{and studied}} {{in order to}} ascertain its possible use as a photochemotherapeutic agent alternative to <b>psoralens.</b> The compound proved able to photobind monofunctionally to DNA on irradiation with UV-A.

50|$|A biosynthetic pathway {{in which}} <b>psoralen</b> is formed {{is shown in}} the figure below.

50|$|A sunburn cell is a {{keratinocyte}} with a pyknotic nucleus and eosinophilic cytoplasm {{that appears}} after exposure to UVC or UVB radiation or UVA {{in the presence}} of <b>psoralens.</b> It shows premature and abnormal keratinization, and has been described as an example of apoptosis.|$|R
50|$|Ficus carica (fig) is {{probably}} the most abundant source of <b>psoralens.</b> They are also found in small quantities in Ammi visnaga (bisnaga), Pastinaca sativa (parsnip), Petroselinum crispum (parsley), Levisticum officinale (lovage), Foeniculum vulgare (fruit, i.e., fennel seeds), Daucus carota (carrot), Psoralea corylifolia (babchi), and Apium graveolens (celery).|$|R
40|$|Furocoumarins {{are well}} known {{photodynamic}} agents able to intercalate into DNA and to further react with the pyrimidine DNA bases under UVA irradiation, thereby blocking DNA processing and functions. Hence, <b>psoralens</b> (linear furocoumarins), such as 8 -methoxypsoralen (8 -MOP) or 5 -methoxypsoralen (5 -MOP), are commonly used in the photochemotherapy of psoriasis and related skin diseases. The ability of <b>psoralens</b> to form diadducts with DNA bases gives rise to crosslinking between DNA chains. For this reason the photochemotherapy with <b>psoralens</b> has some side effects such as skin phototoxicity and risk of skin cancer. In contrast to <b>psoralens,</b> angelicins (linear furocoumarins) generally show lower mutagenic activity. In order to reduce toxic effects of parent compounds, many isomers and/or isosters have been studied, but they all suffer from solubility problems in aqueous media, thus limiting in vitro studies and future therapeutic applications. To investigate if the solubility could be improved without affecting the reactivity of the parent compound toward DNA, new furoquinazoline compounds have been designed. The furoquinazoline nucleus maintains two key features of furocoumarins: a tricyclic planar system, required for DNA intercalation, and a non aromatic double bond, which could undergo photocycloaddition with DNA bases. The title compounds have been synthesized condensing the furan ring on the N-protected aminophenol, then cyclizing the quinazoline moiety with HTMA/K 3 Fe(CN) 6 method. Both angular and linear isomers have been obtained from the same aminobenzofuran intermediate, thus they have been separated by flash-chromatography. To detect the kind of damage induced by these new compounds, linear flow dichroism measurements and DNA-photobinding studies have been performed. Moreover, reactive oxygen species formation and photooxidation of lipids and proteins were studied to determine the mechanism underlying phototoxicity demonstrated in Jurkat and NCTC- 2544 cell lines specially by the linear derivative...|$|R
