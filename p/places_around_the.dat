5|$|There is a Cockney {{derivative}} called Estuary English, {{heavily influenced}} by Cockney and which is named after the Thames Estuary area where the movement of East Londoners to south Essex {{and to a lesser}} extent parts on north Kent led it to be widely spoken in those areas.

5|$|Claude Ewing Rusk, a local settler and mountaineer, was one {{of those}} most {{familiar}} with Adams and he was instrumental in many of the names given to <b>places</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> mountain. In 1890, he, his mother Josie, and his sister Leah completed a circuit of the mountain and explored, to some extent, all ten of its principle glaciers. This was the first recorded circuit of Adams by a woman and likely the first recorded circuit by anyone. While they were on the east side, they named Avalanche Valley. Later, in 1897, after they had completed an ascent of Adams, they went to the Ridge of Wonders and his mother, awestruck by the scene, named it as such.|$|E

5|$|Dolphin drive hunting, {{also called}} dolphin drive fishing, {{is a method}} of hunting {{dolphins}} and occasionally other small cetaceans by driving them together with boats and then usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the open sea or ocean with boats and nets. Dolphins are hunted this way in several <b>places</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, dolphins are mostly hunted for their meat; some end up in dolphinariums.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, {{shortly after}} the move from Burnden Park to the Reebok Stadium, the BWSA {{accepted}} the invitation from the football club to hold its monthly meetings at the new stadium. The Macron Stadium has continued to be their venue ever since. In the year 2000, the Association expanded significantly when its invitation to affiliate was accepted by Bolton Wanderers supporters groups {{in other parts of}} Britain, and also by groups around the world. All of these foreign groups have come on board to become independent, but integral, parts of the official Bolton Wanderers supporters' family. Requests for affiliated status continue to be received regularly from other <b>places</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world where Wanderers fans find themselves gather together.|$|E
5|$|Orci and Kurtzman {{experimented with}} {{numerous}} robots from the franchise, ultimately selecting the characters most popular among the filmmakers {{to form the}} final cast. Bay acknowledged {{that most of the}} Decepticons were selected before their names or roles were developed, as Hasbro had to start designing the toys. Some of their names were changed because Bay was upset that they had been leaked. Optimus, Megatron, Bumblebee and Starscream were the only characters present in each version of the script. Arcee was a female Transformer introduced by Orci and Kurtzman, but she was cut because they found it difficult to explain robotic gender; Bay also disliked her motorcycle form, which he found too small. An early idea to have the Decepticons simultaneously strike multiple <b>places</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world was also dropped.|$|E

5|$|Porpoises {{and other}} smaller cetaceans, mainly dolphins, are hunted in an {{activity}} known as drive hunting. This is accomplished by driving a pod together with boats and usually into a bay or onto a beach. Their escape is prevented by closing off the route to the ocean with other boats or nets. Porpoises are hunted this way in several <b>places</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> world, including the Solomon Islands, the Faroe Islands, Peru, and Japan, the most well-known practitioner of this method. By numbers, porpoises are mostly hunted for their meat, though some end up in dolphinariums. Despite the controversial nature of the hunt resulting in international criticism, and the possible health risk that the high methylmercury levels impose, thousands of porpoises are caught in drive hunts each year.|$|E
5|$|The Charodis, {{the second-largest}} group, were {{converts}} from the Kshatriya (warrior class) and Vaishya (merchant class) castes. They were generally engaged in trade and commercial vocations. The artisan converts formed the third-biggest group and {{were known as}} Sudirs (the Konkani word for Shudras, which were the labour class). They were workers and agricultural labourers engaged in service professions. The converts from the fisher caste residing around Ullal, Kuloor, and other <b>places</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> seacoast were called Gaudis, and formed the fourth group. They cultivated the lands of the Bamonns and the high-caste Hindus. Other minor castes included the Padvals, whom historian Severine Silva assumes to be local Jain converts.|$|E
5|$|In February 1942, {{following}} the squadron's transfer to Columbia Army Air Base in January, Farrow volunteered {{to participate in}} the Doolittle Raid, an attempt to retaliate against the Japanese {{as a result of their}} attack on Pearl Harbor. At the time, however, the mission was secret and its target unknown to the volunteers. On 1 April 1942, after training in various <b>places</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> United States, the crews and their respective aircraft departed from San Francisco aboard the USS Hornet (CV-8). The mission took place on 18 April. The B-25 which Farrow piloted, named Bat out of Hell, was the sixteenth and final aircraft to depart from the Hornet. After the aircraft's targets in Nagoya, which included an oil tank and aircraft factory, had been bombed, Farrow intended to land in Chuchow. However, the Japanese had deactivated the beacon that Farrow was using for direction.|$|E

5|$|The 12"/50 was a Bethlehem development. It {{was most}} likely based on the weapon used in the United States' , the 12"/50 caliber Mark 7 gun. The twelve guns were mounted in six twin turrets. Four turrets were superfiring fore and aft, while {{the other two were}} located en echelon in wing turrets. The latter weapons could, in theory, fire on a ° range on their {{respective}} sides of the hull and ° on the other, but in reality this was not possible, as the blast damage from the weapons would damage the ship. A more reasonable estimate would be ° on their sides. The 6-inch secondary armament was placed in casemates, with six {{on either side of the}} ship. For protection, they were provided with 6inches of armor. The 4-inch weaponry, intended for use against marauding destroyers, was mounted unarmored in various <b>places</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> ship, including the main deck, superstructure, and far up near the bow. As originally built, there were sixteen 4-inch guns, but four of those were replaced with four 3-inch AA guns and four 3-pounders during the 1924-1926 modernization. The torpedo tubes were located underneath the waterline and were loaded in a dedicated compartment.|$|E
5|$|The island's bird life is {{particularly}} rich in waders such as curlew and redshank, found at The Ouse and Veantro Bay, and gull and tern colonies on the rockier shores and cliffs. pintail, shovellers and whooper swans are regular summer visitors, {{and there are}} also breeding populations of shelducks, hen harriers and bonxies. There is an introduced population of red-legged partridges. Otters can be seen at the Ouse, Lairo Water and Vasa Loch, and at various <b>places</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> coast along with common seals and Atlantic grey seals. There are plans to build a hide to allow visitors to observe seals without disturbing them. Shapinsay and Hoy are the only two larger Orkney islands that lack the Orkney vole (Microtus arvalis orcadensis). Wildflowers abound in the summer, and the lichen Melaspilea interjecta, which is endemic to Scotland, is found in only three locations, including Shapinsay. In addition to the RSPB reserve at Mill Dam there is a Scottish Wildlife Trust reserve at East Hill in the southeast.|$|E
5|$|The strict {{definition}} of Heinrich events is the climatic event causing the IRD layer observed in marine sediment cores from the North Atlantic: a massive collapse of northern hemisphere ice shelves {{and the consequent}} release of a prodigious volume of icebergs. By extension, the name Heinrich events can also refer to the associated climatic anomalies registered at other <b>places</b> <b>around</b> <b>the</b> globe, at approximately the same time periods. The events are rapid: they last probably less than a millennium, a duration varying from one event to the next, and their abrupt onset may occur in mere years (Maslin et al. 2001). Heinrich events are clearly observed in many North Atlantic marine sediment cores covering the last glacial period; the lower resolution of the sedimentary record before this point {{makes it more difficult}} to deduce whether they occurred during other glacial periods in the Earth's history. Some (Broecker 1994, Bond & Lotti 1995) identify the Younger Dryas event as a Heinrich event, which would make it event H0 (table, right).|$|E
