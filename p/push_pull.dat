Comparators with an open-drain output stage use an external pull up resistor to a positive supply that defines the logic high level. Open drain comparators {{are more suitable for}} mixed-voltage system design. Since the output is high impedance for logic level high, open drain comparators {{can also be used to}} connect multiple comparators on to a single bus. <b>Push</b> <b>pull</b> output does not need a pull up resistor and can also source current unlike an open drain output.|$|E
25|$|The main {{gameplay}} {{takes place}} in the Nightmare stages. In a nightmarish dreamworld inhabited by other men, who are represented as anthropomorphic sheep, Vincent must climb up giant staircases that are slowly collapsing underneath him and safely reach the top. To accomplish this, Vincent must <b>push,</b> <b>pull</b> and climb blocks as quickly as possible while avoiding various traps such as spikes and ice. Climbing up steps in quick succession increases a score multiplier, {{and at the end of}} the level, players are given an award based on their score. Each stage is split up into numerous areas, culminating in a boss stage in which a nightmarish creature also attempts to kill Vincent. Vincent can move faster depending on how much alcohol he drinks during the day and can earn pillows that allow him to retry levels. There are also several items which can be found or purchased in between stages, such as spare blocks, lightning which removes enemies and energy drinks that allow Vincent to climb more steps at a time. Vincent will die if he falls off the bottom of the level, gets caught by a trap or is killed by a boss, with the game ending if Vincent runs out of retry pillows. In between action stages, Vincent can interact with the other sheep, save his game, learn techniques or spend coins on special items. When playing on easy and normal difficulty, players can push the Select/Back button to correct a single block move.|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper was}} to perform a comprehensive review of psychophysically determined maximum acceptable <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> forces. Factors affecting <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> forces are identified and discussed. Recent studies show a significant decrease (compared to previous studies) in maximum acceptable forces for males but not for females when <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> on a treadmill. A comparison of <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> forces measured using a high inertia cart with those measured on a treadmill shows that the <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> forces using high inertia cart are higher for males but are about the same for females. It is concluded that the recommendations of Snook and Ciriello (1991) for <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> forces are still valid and provide reasonable recommendations for ergonomics practitioners. Regression equations as a function of handle height, frequency of exertion and pushing/pulling distance are provided to estimate maximum initial and sustained forces for <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> acceptable to 75 % male and female workers. At present {{it is not clear whether}} <b>pushing</b> or <b>pulling</b> should be favored. Similarly, it is not clear what handle heights would be optimal for <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling.</b> Epidemiological studies are needed to determine relationships between psychophysically determined maximum acceptable <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> forces and risk of musculoskeletal injuries, in particular to low back and shoulders.

40|$|Although <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> is {{very common}} in {{occupational}} settings, this type of manual materials handling is less well studied than lifting and carrying. Several issues should be considered when obtaining exposure measures in epidemiological field studies on <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling.</b> The {{purpose of this article}} is threefold: (i) to critically evaluate different methods to assess <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> forces, (ii) to describe measures of exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling,</b> and (iii) to consider measurement strategies for assessment of exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling.</b> Firstly, information on the level of exerted forces with the accuracy needed for epidemiology can only be obtained from direct measurement methods. These methods are particularly required when <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> tasks are biomechanically analysed, implying that also force direction and point of application relative to the worker have to be assessed. Secondly, to obtain a limited number of external exposure measures that reflect exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> over time, aggregation of various force measurements is suggested. Internal exposure measures and parameters corresponding to guidelines are also described. Thirdly, for truck drivers and refuse collectors a strategy of approximately five repeated measurements for each representative working situation is advised to obtain a reliable estimate of an individual's exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling.</b> Relevance to industryAn overview is given of methods to assess forces accompanying <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling,</b> which are very common activities in industry. Examples of exposure measures and measurement strategies in studies on adverse health effects of <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> are presented. Such studies should eventually stimulate prevention of work-related musculoskeletal disorders. Copyright (C) 1999 Elsevier Science B. V...|$|R
40|$|Recent years’ {{terrorist}} attacks in Europe and the flow of foreign fighters joining the terrorist organisation Daesh, has made the understanding of radicalisation evermore crucial. This thesis investigates if <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors leading into violent Islamic extremism differentiate between men and women. Furthermore, it assesses how preventive measures from The United Kingdom, Sweden and Denmark targets <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors and if these are sensitive to sex. To fulfil this objective an exploratory thematic {{analysis was used to}} synthesise secondary qualitative research surrounding <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors. The <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factor analysis revealed three trends: there were limited variation in the overall categories describing the <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors present for men and women; what caused <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors to manifest differed according to sex; and, there were differences in how much men and women were affected by these factors. The assessment of prevention measures showed that none of the measures explicitly mentioned <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors, yet they all had the potential of targeting these. Sex was included in some aspects of the measures, but was not a consideration in relation to the targeting of <b>push</b> and <b>pull</b> factors. The thesis ends with a discussion of what implications the found results have for practice and offers suggestions to how prevention measures can be improved...|$|R

40|$|Objectives Low-back and {{shoulder}} complaints {{were examined in}} relation to self-reported and objectively assessed exposure to work-related <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling.</b> Methods Workers from several companies (eg, nursing homes and flower auctions) with <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> tasks and, as reference, workers without physically demanding tasks were invited to participate. Altogether 829 workers initially received a questionnaire, of whom 459 responded both initially and after I year of follow-up. Initially, self-reported exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> was assessed by questionnaire. Furthermore, {{a representative sample of}} 131 workers was observed at work using TRAC (task recording and analysis on computer) to assess exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> objectively. For exposure to <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling,</b> the workers were classified into a reference group and medium and high exposure groups. Initially and in the follow-up, the 12 -month prevalence of low-back {{and shoulder}} complaints was assessed. Complaints reported in the follow-up were separately used as dependent variables to calculate prevalence rate ratios (PR) in a Cox's proportional hazard regression analysis. Results The adjusted PR values were not significant for low-back complaints. For shoulder complaints, both the medium and high exposure groups showed significant adjusted PR values for self-reported exposure and observed duration of <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> when compared with the reference group (PR range 2. 18 - 4. 86). For the observed frequency of <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling,</b> only the medium exposure group showed a significant PR, of 3. 95. Conclusions The findings suggest a rather strong relationship between <b>pushing</b> and <b>pulling</b> and shoulder complaints.
