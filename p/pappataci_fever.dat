5000|$|<b>Pappataci</b> <b>fever</b> (also {{known as}} Phlebotomus fever and, {{somewhat}} confusingly, sandfly fever and three-day fever) is a vector-borne febrile arboviral infection caused by three serotypes of Phlebovirus. It occurs in subtropical {{regions of the}} Eastern Hemisphere. The name, <b>pappataci</b> <b>fever,</b> comes from the Italian word for sandfly, it is the union of the word [...] "pappa" [...] (food) and taci (silent) which distinguishes these insects from blood-feeding mosquitoes, which produce a typical noise while flying.|$|E
40|$|Sandflies of {{the genus}} Phlebotomus are a {{widespread}} and medically-important group of bloodsucking midges. Their distribution covers the tropics of both hemispheres and extends well into both {{the north and south}} temperate regions. Certain species are the vectors of various forms of leishmaniasis, of Oroya fever or verruga peruana and of <b>pappataci</b> or sandfly <b>fever.</b> Leishmaniasis in several forms is widespread in the American tropics, and verruga is known from southern Colombia to southern Peru, but neither infection has been reported from the West Indies. Sandfly fever is known with certainty only from the Old World, though cases clinically indistinguishable have been reported from a number of widely scattered places in the New World. Clinically suspicious cases have occurred in Puerto Rico, though not reported as sandfly fever because of the supposed absence of Phlebotomus in that area. Previous to 193 S, Phlebotomus sandflies were not known to occur in the West Indies outside of Trinidad. In that year Bequaert (1938) reported their occurrence in Martinique in the French West Indies, although the species has not been determined. Floch and Abonnenc (1945) were the first to determine a species from the West Indies, P. atroclavatus from Guadeloupe. In 1947 the junior author took Phlebotomus on Puerto Rico and on Vieques Island. These were described by Fairchild and Hertig (1948). In the following year Trapido again secured material from a number of widely scattered localities in Puerto Rico and from St. Thomas in the Virgin Islands which is reported on more fully below. 'The field work in connection with this investigation was done while the authors were on tour of active duty with the U. S. Army Caribbean. We are exceedingly indebted to Col. Thomas Page, M. D., Surgeon, U. S. Army Caribbean, for his interest and support of this work and for facilitating the arrangements for our trip. We are further greatly indebted to Mr. C. B. Lewis of the Institute of Jamaica for much help and advice while we were in Jamaica; to Col. Carlos Ponce R., of the Cuban Army, for his hospitality and kindness in furnishing quarters and transportation while we were in Camaguey; to Dr. Guillermo Aguay...|$|R
50|$|<b>Pappataci</b> <b>fever</b> {{is seldom}} {{recognised}} in endemic populations {{because it is}} mixed with other febrile illnesses of childhood, {{but it is more}} well-known among immigrants and military personnel from non-endemic regions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pappataci</b> <b>fever</b> is {{prevalent}} in the subtropical zone of the Eastern Hemisphere between 20°N and 45°N, particularly in Southern Europe, North Africa, the Balkans, Eastern Mediterranean, Iraq, Iran, Pakistan, Afghanistan and India.|$|E
50|$|In 1941, Nares {{joined the}} 12th Royal Lancers (The Prince of Wales's Royal Regiment of Lancers) and fought a hard {{war in the}} desert during which he {{contracted}} <b>pappataci</b> <b>fever</b> virus (also known as Phlebotomus fever and sandfly fever). He died in Cairo of a brain tumor, and was buried at the Heliopolis War Cemetery, just outside Cairo.|$|E
50|$|Phlebotomus {{species are}} also vectors for bartonellosis, verruga peruana, and <b>pappataci</b> <b>fever,</b> an arboviral disease caused by sandfly fever viruses {{such as the}} Naples and Sicilian strains of the genus Phlebovirus (family Bunyaviridae), which also {{includes}} the closely related Toscana virus.In Egypt, two species of medical importance are Phlebotomus papatasii and P. langerni. These flies are short-lived. Females are bloodsuckers at night; males feed on plant juices. Adults are poor fliers, they usually hop for short distances.|$|E
50|$|The {{following}} twelve viruses {{have been}} linked to disease in humans: Alenquer virus, Bhanja virus, Candiru virus, Chagres virus, Naples virus, Punta Toro virus, Rift Valley fever, Sicilian virus, Toscana virus, Uukuniemi virus, Heartland virus (the first tick-borne phlebovirus known to cause disease in the Western Hemisphere, discovered in 2009), and the Sandfly Turkey virus (discovered in China in 2011).They cause symptoms ranging from short self-limiting fevers, such as <b>pappataci</b> <b>fever,</b> to encephalitis and fatal haemorrhagic fever.|$|E
50|$|The Phlebotominae are a {{subfamily}} of {{the family}} Psychodidae. In several countries, their common name is sand fly; but that name is also applied to other flies known as sandflies. The Phlebotominae include many genera of blood-feeding (hematophagous) flies, including the primary vectors of leishmaniasis, bartonellosis and <b>pappataci</b> <b>fever.</b> In the New World, leishmaniasis is spread by sand flies in the genus Lutzomyia, which commonly live in caves, where their main hosts are bats. In the Old World, sand flies in the genus Phlebotomus spread leishmaniasis.|$|E
50|$|Transovarial or transovarian {{transmission}} {{occurs in}} certain arthropod vectors as they transmit disease-causing pathogens from parent arthropod to offspring arthropod. For instance, Rickettsia rickettsii, carried within ticks, is passed on from parent to offspring tick by transovarial transmission. In contrast, Rickettsia prowazekii is not passed on by transovarian transmission because it kills the vector that carries it (human louse). This is the {{mechanism by which}} many Rickettsiae are maintained in their arthropod hosts through generations, which occurs also in aedes mosquito vector of the yellow fever virus and in phlebotomine sandflies that transmit <b>pappataci</b> <b>fever.</b>|$|E

5000|$|The viruses of {{vertebrates}} are informally {{distinguished between}} those that primarily cause infections {{of humans and}} those that infect other animals. The two fields of study are called medical (or clinical) virology and veterinary virology respectively. Although not the first viruses to be discovered and characterised, those that cause infections of humans are the most studied. Different viruses can infect all the organs and tissues {{of the body and}} the outcomes range from mild or no symptoms, to life-threatening diseases. Humans cannot be infected by plant or insect viruses, but they are susceptible to infections with viruses from other vertebrates. These are called viral zoonoses or zoonotic infections. [...] Examples include, rabies, yellow fever and <b>pappataci</b> <b>fever.</b>|$|E
50|$|Toscana virus (TOSV) is an {{arbovirus}} (arthropod-borne virus) {{belonging to}} Bunyaviridae, {{a family of}} negative-stranded, enveloped RNA viruses. The virus can be transmitted to humans by the bite of an infected sandfly of the genus Phlebotomus. Toscana is not normally associated with disease, as indicated by high seroprevalance rates (up to 25%) in endemic areas, but in common with other sandfly transmitted viruses such as Naples virus and Sicilian virus, infection may result in <b>Pappataci</b> <b>fever,</b> an illness with mild fever, headache and myalgia. In serious cases that go undiagnosed, acute meningitis, meningoencephalitis and encephalitis may occur. There is no specific treatment for infection, so treatment is supportive, reducing the severity of symptoms until the immune system has cleared the infection.|$|E
50|$|In 1908, Yevgeny Pavlovsky {{graduated}} from the Military Medical Academy in Petersburg (he became a professor at his alma mater in 1921). In 1933-1944, {{he worked at the}} All-union Institute of Experimental Medicine in Leningrad and simultaneously at the Tajik branch of the Soviet Academy of Sciences (1937-1951). Yevgeny Pavlovsky held the post of the director of the Zoology Institute of the Soviet Academy of Sciences in 1942-1962. In 1946, he was appointed head of the Department of Parasitology & Medical Zoology at the Institute of Epidemiology & Microbiology of the Soviet Academy of Medical Sciences. Yevgeny Pavlovsky was the president of the Soviet Geographical Society in 1952-1964. Under Pavlovsky’s direction, they organized numerous complex expeditions to the Central Asia, Transcaucasus, Crimea, Russian Far East and other regions of the Soviet Union to study endemic parasitic and transmissible diseases (tick-borne relapsing fever, tick-borne encephalitis, <b>Pappataci</b> <b>fever,</b> leishmaniasis etc.). Yevgeny Pavlovsky introduced the concept of natural nidality of human diseases, defined by the idea that microscale disease foci are determined by the entire ecosystem. This concept laid the foundation for the elaboration of a number of preventive measures and promoted the development of the environmental trend in parasitology (together with the works of parasitologist Valentin Dogel). Yevgeny Pavlovsky researched host organism as a habitat for parasites (parasitocenosis), numerous matters of regional and landscape parasitology, life cycles of a number of parasites, pathogenesis of helminth infection. Pavlovsky and his fellow scientists researched the fauna of flying blood-sucking insects (gnat) and methods of controlling them and venomous animals and characteristics of their venom.|$|E
40|$|Sandfl y fever viruses (SFV) are endemic in the Mediterranean, Middle East, {{northern}} African {{and western}} Asian countries. Toscana virus (TOSV), serotype of Sandfl y fever Naples virus, is among {{of the three}} most prevalent viruses associated with meningitis during the warm seasons in northern Mediterranean countries. Th e historical data of the sandfl y fever (<b>Pappataci</b> <b>fever)</b> indicates its origin in Bosnia and Herzegovina {{at the end of}} th century. Th ere is {{a long period of time}} for which there are no data on re-search related to the SFV in Bosnia and Herzegovina. Th e purpose of the study was to investigate the presence of sandfl y fever in Bosnia and Herzegovina in recent years. Th e of serum samples were obtained from February until September from a group of patients with febrile illness of unknown etiology. Th e sera were tested on the presence of IgG and IgM antibodies against TOSV by specifi c serology test- recomLine Bunyavirus IgG/IgM immuno-line assay. Th e recent TOSV-infection was confi rmed in the patients in each year during the study:, (/) in;, (/) in and, (/) in. Th e presence of specifi c antibodies to TOSV in the sera of the patients in recent years indicates re-emerging character of the disease in this region. It would be necessary to make biological, epidemiological and clinical research on the TOSV and related phleboviruses to elucidate the problem of SFV in Bosnia and Her-zegovina...|$|E
