5|$|San Diego {{has hosted}} several sports events. Three NFL Super Bowl championships {{have been held}} at Qualcomm Stadium. Two of college football's annual bowl games are also held at Qualcomm Stadium: the Holiday Bowl and the <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl. Parts of the World Baseball Classic were played at Petco Park in 2006 and 2009.|$|E
5|$|With the win the Midshipmen {{improved}} to 6–4, making the team bowl-eligible {{for the fifth}} straight year. After finishing the regular season {{with a record of}} 8–4 they played in the 2007 <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl, losing to the Utah Utes. The loss against Navy gave the Mean Green a 1–8 record, and the team eventually finished with a 2–10 record for the season.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the 2008 season, the WAC had six bowl-eligible teams, five {{of which}} participated in bowl games. The WAC had three conference tie-ins: the New Mexico Bowl in Albuquerque, New Mexico; the Hawaii Bowl in Honolulu, Hawaii; and the Humanitarian Bowl. Additionally, the WAC had {{provisions}} for conditional participation in the <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl in San Diego, California; the Independence Bowl in Shreveport, Louisiana; and the GMAC Bowl in Mobile, Alabama.|$|E
50|$|In {{the early}} 1900s the Ecke family of {{southern}} California grew <b>poinsettias</b> outdoors {{for use as}} landscape plants and as a cut flower.

5|$|There are densely forested regions around Gangtok, {{consisting}} of temperate, deciduous forests of poplar, birch, oak, and elm, {{as well as}} evergreen, coniferous trees of the wet alpine zone. Orchids are common, and rare varieties of orchids are featured in flower shows in the city. Bamboos are also abundant. In the lower reaches of the town, the vegetation gradually changes from alpine to temperate deciduous and subtropical. Flowers such as sunflower, marigold, <b>poinsettia,</b> and others bloom, especially in November and December.|$|E
5|$|The Midshipmen, using {{a triple}} option {{offensive}} scheme under head coach Paul Johnson, had gained the most rushing yards of {{any team in}} the nation and had a record of 4–4 through the first eight games of the season. In their ninthgame the team defeated the Notre Dame Fighting Irish in triple overtime, ending a 43-year losing streak in the Notre Dame–Navy rivalry and improving the team's record to 5–4. With threegames remaining in the season, Navy needed to win at least one more to become bowl eligible. Sponsors had arranged for Navy (which was unaffiliated with any college football conference) to play in the <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl if they won six games. The Midshipmen defense allowed an average of 38.8 points per game.|$|E
5|$|The win {{lifted the}} Midshipmen's record for that season to 10–2, Navy's second 10-win season {{in its history}} and first in 99 years. It was the first bowl game victory for the Midshipmen since the 1996 Aloha Bowl. As {{a result of the}} win, the team {{finished}} the season ranked 24th in both the Associated Press and USA Today Coaches' Poll, the first time since 1978 that the Midshipmen finished the season ranked in any major poll. For his coaching accomplishments that year, head coach Paul Johnson was awarded the 2004 Bobby Dodd Coach of the Year Award. The next season, Navy played in the inaugural 2005 <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl, defeating the Colorado State Rams 51–30. In November 2012, Navy accepted an invitation to Kraft Fight Hunger Bowl, the newest name for the Emerald Bowl, based on the team's positive experiences from this game.|$|E

25|$|The 2007 <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl was {{the last}} time the bowl would feature a matchup between an at-large team and the second-place Mountain West Conference team. Prior to the game, <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl {{officials}} announced that the at-large half of the matchup would be replaced by the Pacific-10 Conference's seventh-place team in 2008. In 2009, the Pac-10's sixth-place team would be granted a bid to the <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl.|$|E
25|$|Prior to the {{beginning}} of the 2007 college football season, <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl organizers and Navy reached a single-season agreement with the United States Naval Academy for the Midshipmen to play in the 2007 <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl if the team became bowl eligible by reaching at least sixwins. The Midshipmen had previously won the inaugural 2005 <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl and played in the 2006 Meineke Car Care Bowl. The team earned a 4–4 record through the first eight games of the season, including an overtime loss against the Ball State Cardinals and a double-overtime win against the Pittsburgh Panthers. The team's ninth game versus the Notre Dame Fighting Irish ended with a triple-overtime win for the Midshipmen, their first victory in the Navy–Notre Dame football rivalry in 43 years. With a 5–4 record and needing another win to become bowl eligible, the Midshipmen reached that mark when they defeated the North Texas Mean Green in a contest that set a new NCAA record for most points scored in a regulation-length FBS college football game. The Midshipmen accepted their invitation to play in the 2007 <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl on November 12.|$|E

25|$|The 2007 <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl was {{the first}} of 32bowl games {{scheduled}} for 2007 college football bowl season. At the conclusion of the national anthem during the pre-game show, four United States Navy F/A-18 Hornet aircraft performed a flyover past the stadium. The 2007 <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl kicked off on 9:12pm EST on December 20, 2007 at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California. The game began in fair weather, but by the start of the second half, it had begun to rain. The game was televised in the United States on ESPN, although the first six minutes of game time were broadcast on ESPN Classic rather than ESPN due to a time overrun from another program. The program earned a Nielsen rating of 2.00.|$|E
25|$|The post-season {{kicked off}} with the San Diego County Credit Union <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl at San Diego's Qualcomm Stadium on December 19, 2006, {{the first of two}} {{scheduled}} bowl games in that stadium. The Mountain West's Texas Christian University Horned Frogs held the Mid-American Conference's NIU Huskies' star running back Garrett Wolfe to 28yards en route to a 37–7 win. TCU quarterback Jeff Ballard rushed for three touchdowns and threw for another. The Horned Frogs entered the game ranked 25th in the final regular season AP Poll, while the Huskies entered the <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl after finishing in third place in the MAC's West Division. Each team earned $750,000 for their conference by participating in the game. Among those in attendance were San Diego Chargers running backs LaDainian Tomlinson (TCU alumnus) and his backup, NIU alum Michael Turner.|$|E

25|$|Prior to the game, Midshipmen head {{football}} coach Paul Johnson announced he would take over the head coaching position at Georgia Tech for the 2007 season. Navy's offensive line coach Ken Niumatalolo was initially named interim head coach, but was confirmed as Navy's permanent head coach before the game. The 2007 <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl was Niumatalolo's first game as head coach at any school.|$|E
25|$|The 2007 <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl, {{operated}} by {{the organizers of the}} Holiday Bowl, was sponsored by the San Diego County Credit Union. The previous year's game matched the TCU Horned Frogs from the Mountain West Conference against Northern Illinois Huskies from the Mid-American Conference. TCU defeated Northern Illinois with a score of 37–7. In exchange for their participation in the 2007 game, Navy and Utah each received $750,000.|$|E
40|$|The {{nucleotide}} precursors of cell-wall mucopeptide {{were prepared}} by vancomycin inhibition of Corynebacterium insidiosum and Corynebacterium <b>poinsettiae.</b> The amino acid {{in the third}} position in the former peptide was shown by optical rotatory dispersion of the bisdinitrophenyl derivative to be l-diaminobutyric acid. Homoserine in the nucleotide from C. <b>poinsettiae</b> was catalytically oxidized to aspartic acid, which was then shown to be the l-isomer by optical rotatory dispersion of the trinitrophenyl compound. The sequence for C. insidiosum was UDP-N-acetylmuramyl-glycyl-isoglutamyl- (γ-acetyl) -diaminobutyryl-alanyl-alanine. The cell walls of C. insidiosum and Corynebacterium sepedonicum contained diaminobutyric acid that was optically inactive. It is proposed, therefore, that the primary peptide chain contains the l-isomer with its γ-amino group blocked by acetylation and that cross-linking is achieved {{by means of the}} d-isomer, analogous to d-ornithine in C. <b>poinsettiae...</b>|$|R
50|$|Keep <b>poinsettias</b> {{away from}} warm or cold drafts from radiators, air {{registers}} or open doors and windows.Ideally <b>poinsettias</b> require daytime temperatures of 60 to 70 °F and night time temperatures around 55 °F.

25|$|Utah {{defeated}} California 37–27 in the <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl {{for their}} ninth consecutive bowl victory. The win improved Utah's record to 10–3 (6–2 MWC) and dropped California to 8–5 (5–3 Pac-10). Utah has the longest bowl winning streak {{in the country}} and is tied for the second longest streak of all time. Florida State holds the record with eleven consecutive bowl victories from 1985 to 1996. The win improved Utah's bowl record to 12–3 (.800).|$|E
25|$|The 2007 Navy Midshipmen {{football}} team {{was off to}} a better start. They had achieved victories against Temple, Duke, Air Force, and Pittsburgh. Losses against Rutgers, Ball State, Wake Forest, and Delaware put them 4–4 on the season. With four games remaining in the season, Navy needed to win at least two {{in order to be}} invited to a bowl game. The <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl had arranged for the Midshipmen to play in that bowl if they reached six wins.|$|E
25|$|The Pacific Life Holiday Bowl was {{the first}} of the six prestigious non-BCS games and the third game to be played on December 28. It was played at Qualcomm Stadium in San Diego, California, which also hosts the <b>Poinsettia</b> Bowl.
