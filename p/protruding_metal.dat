50|$|The exact {{date of the}} {{invention}} of the buccin has not been documented and apart from Berlioz’s Messe, there is {{little in the way of}} surviving music for it. Yet we do know that the buccin was popularized in military bands in France between 1810 and 1845. Parades, outdoor festivals and civic celebrations were an important part of French cultural life from the time of the Revolution (1789) through most of the 19th century. The visual appeal of band members in uniform playing instruments with zoomorphic heads (in addition to the buccin, serpents, bass horns, bassoons and Russian bassoons—a form of upright serpent—all were made with decorative bells) was indisputable and manufacturers were quick to supply more and more exotic designs. The buccin bell was often vividly painted red, green and gold and the <b>protruding</b> <b>metal</b> tongue included by many makers would flap while marching and playing.|$|E

5000|$|Inside {{the twisted}} debris {{of the crew}} cabin were {{the bodies of the}} astronauts, which after weeks of {{immersion}} in salt water and exposure to scavenging marine life were in a semi-liquefied state that bore little resemblance to anything living, although according to John Devlin, the skipper of the USS Preserve, they [...] "were not as badly mangled as you'd see in some aircraft accidents". Lt. Cmdr James Simpson of the Coast Guard reported finding a helmet with ears and a scalp in it. Judy Resnik was the first to be removed followed by Christa McAuliffe with more human remains retrieved over several hours. Due to the hazardous nature of the recovery operation (the cabin was filled with large pieces of <b>protruding</b> jagged <b>metal),</b> the Navy divers protested that they would not go on with the work unless the cabin was hauled onto the ship's deck.

5000|$|Rolland Ballestros, one of {{the agents}} {{assigned}} to the ATF door team that assaulted the front door, told Texas Rangers and Waco police that he thought the first shots came from the ATF dog team assigned to neutralize the Branch Davidians' dogs, but later at the trial he insisted that the Branch Davidians had shot first. The Branch Davidians claimed that the ATF door team then opened fire {{at the door and}} they returned fire in self-defense. An Austin Chronicle article noted, [...] "Long before the fire, the Davidians were discussing the evidence contained in the doors. During the siege, in a phone conversation with the FBI, Steve Schneider, one of Koresh's main confidants, told FBI agents that 'the evidence from the front door will clearly show how many bullets and what happened. Houston attorney Dick DeGuerin, who went inside Mount Carmel during the siege, testified at the trial that <b>protruding</b> <b>metal</b> {{on the inside of the}} right-hand entry door made it clear that the bullet holes were made by incoming rounds. DeGuerin also testified that only the right-hand entry door had bullet holes, while the left-hand entry door was intact. The government presented the left-hand entry door at the trial, claiming that the right-hand entry door had been lost. The left-hand door contained numerous bullet holes made by both outgoing and incoming rounds. Texas Trooper Sgt. David Keys testified that he witnessed two men loading what could have been the missing door into a U-Haul van shortly after the siege had ended, but he did not see the object itself. Michael Caddell, the lead attorney for the Branch Davidians' wrongful death lawsuit explained, [...] "The fact that the left-hand door is in the condition it's in tells you that the right-hand door was not consumed by the fire. It was lost on purpose by somebody." [...] Caddell offered no evidence to support this allegation, which has never been proved. However, fire investigators stated that it was [...] "extremely unlikely" [...] that the steel right door could have suffered damage in the fire much greater than did the steel left door, and both doors would have been found together. The right door remains missing, and the entire site was under close supervision by law enforcement officials until the debris—including both doors—had been removed.|$|E
40|$|Quilt Packaging (QP), a novel chip-to-chip {{communication}} {{paradigm for}} system-in-package integration, is presented. By forming <b>protruding</b> <b>metal</b> nodules {{along the edges}} of the chips and interconnecting integrated circuits (ICs) through them, QP offers an approach to ameliorate the I/O speed bottleneck. A fabrication process that includes deep reactive ion etching, electroplating, and chemical-mechanical polishing is demonstrated. As a low-temperature process, it can be easily integrated into a standard IC fabrication process. Three-dimensional electromagnetic simulations of coplanar waveguide QP structures have been performed, and geometries intended to improve impedance matching at the interface between the on-chip interconnects and the chip-to-chip nodule structures were evaluated. Test chips with 100 µm wide nodules were fabricated on silicon substrates, and s-parameters of chip-to-chip interconnects were measured. The insertion loss of the chip-to-chip interconnects was as low as 0. 2 dB at 40 GHz. Simulations of 20 µm wide QP structures suggest that the bandwidth of the inter-chip nodules is expected to be above 200 GHz...|$|E

40|$|Polycrystalline nickel was reacted at 680 &# 176;C with a carbon-supersaturated CO/H 2 /H 2 O gas. Graphite {{deposited}} {{on the metal}} surface as (a) very thin (20 - 200 nm) layers on a smooth metal surface, (b) thick (1 - 2 &# 956;m), relatively uniform layers which developed serrated incursions into the metal, and (c) nodules which stood proud of, and <b>protruded</b> into, the <b>metal</b> surface.

50|$|The {{device was}} well {{received}} by the public and media, however, comments have been made about the micro-USB port being too recessed (preventing many third-party cables from properly locking in the port). The plug shaft length of cables supplied by Wileyfox exceeds the minimum length mandated by the USB specification by approximately 0,5mm. Wileyfox's cables do not meet USB specification requirements in other aspects, and as of 2016-01-15, Wileyfox did not pass the compliance requirements to use USB logos or trademarks. Because the metal ring holding the rear camera lens has sharp edges, moving the device on a comparatively soft surface, such as a wooden table, easily leaves scratch marks. The accessory clip-on covers available from Wileyfox alleviate this issue by <b>protruding</b> beyond the <b>metal</b> ring, and are offered in black and red orange. While these cases protect the back, rear camera lens and sides, they do not protrude to protect the screen. The device dimensions change to 73mm width, 143mm height, and 10mm thickness.

25|$|In 1576, the {{governor}} of a province in Northern Argentina commissioned the military {{to search for a}} huge mass of iron, which he had heard that Natives used for their weapons. The Natives claimed that the mass had fallen from the sky in a place they called Piguem Nonralta which the Spanish translated as Campo del Cielo ("Field of Heaven"). The expedition found a large mass of <b>metal</b> <b>protruding</b> out of the soil. They assumed it was an iron mine and brought back a few samples, which were described as being of unusual purity. The governor documented the expedition and deposited the report in the Archivo General de Indias in Seville, but it was quickly forgotten and later reports on that area merely repeated the Native legends. Following the legends, in 1774 Don Bartolomé Francisco de Maguna rediscovered the iron mass which he called el Meson de Fierro ("the Table of Iron"). Maguna thought the mass was the tip of an iron vein. The next expedition, led by Rubin de Celis in 1783, used explosives to clear the ground around the mass and found that it was probably a single stone. Celis estimated its mass as 15 tonnes and abandoned it as worthless. He himself did not believe that the stone had fallen from the sky and assumed that it had formed by a volcanic eruption. However, he sent the samples to the Royal Society of London and published his report in the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society. Those samples were later analyzed and found to contain 90% iron and 10% nickel and assigned to a meteoritic origin.|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, flash x-ray {{photography}} {{as well as}} high speed regular photography was used to investigate the fragmentation process during the vapor explosion of single drops of molten metal in water. For drops heated to 700 $ sp circ$C, a vapor bubble is formed around the drop after a short induction time of about 80 $ mu$s which grows to a maximum diameter and then collapses. X-ray radiographs, which can "see through" the vapor bubble, show that filaments of <b>metal</b> <b>protruding</b> from the drop surface are produced during the bubble growth. At {{the time of the}} bubble collapse, the drop surface is highly convoluted and a second interaction is initiated producing an even larger second bubble in the case of tin drops. A mechanism based on nonuniform superheating and evaporation of the water upon unstable film collapse is proposed to describe the origin of the melt filaments. For liquid drops under isothermal conditions with the water, fragmentation occurs as mass is stripped off the surface due to relative motion of the water. For hot drops at higher flow velocities (i. e., $>$ 45 m/s) initially a vapor bubble forms but it is quickly displaced downstream. It is proposed that evaporation at the upstream surface of the bubble generates a vapor flow around the drop surface which strips the drop surface. The vapor flow carries the fragments into the bubble region behind the drop. The vapor later condenses leaving a cloud of fragments which are subsequently dispersed by the water. The dynamics of the vapor bubble produced by the explosion of a hot drop under low flow conditions is modeled using a parametric model incorporating the Rayleigh equation for bubble dynamics and an energy equation for the vapor to account for added heat transfer from the distorting drop surface. Estimates of the total heat transferred from the drop show that only 3 % of the initial drop thermal energy is converted into work done by the vapor bubble...|$|R
60|$|When {{consciousness}} {{returned the}} sun was high in the heavens, yet the light was dim, and had that indefinable ghastly quality that is observed during a partial eclipse. The sun itself appeared singularly small, {{as if it were}} at an immensely greater distance than usual. Rising with some difficulty to my feet, I looked about me. I was in an open space among some trees growing on the slope of a mountain range whose summit on the one hand was obscured by a mist of a strange pinkish hue, and on the other rose into peaks glittering with snow. Skirting the base at a distance of two or three miles flowed a wide river, and beyond it a nearly level plain stretched away to the horizon, dotted with villages and farmhouses and apparently in a high state of cultivation. All was unfamiliar in its every aspect. The trees were unlike any that I had ever seen or even imagined, the trunks being mostly square and the foliage consisting of slender filaments resembling hair, in many instances long enough to reach the earth. It was of many colors, and I could not perceive that there was any prevailing one, as green is in the vegetation to which I was accustomed. As far as I could see there were no grass, no weeds, no flowers; the earth was covered with a kind of lichen, uniformly blue. Instead of rocks, great masses of <b>metals</b> <b>protruded</b> here and there, and above me on the mountain were high cliffs of what seemed to be bronze veined with brass. No animals were visible, but a few birds as uncommon in appearance as their surroundings glided through the air or perched upon the rocks. I say glided, for their motion was not true flight, their wings being mere membranes extended parallel to their sides, and having no movement independent of the body. The bird was, so to say, suspended between them and moved forward by quick strokes of a pair of enormously large webbed feet, precisely as a duck propels itself in water. All these things excited in me no surprise, nor even curiosity; they were merely unfamiliar. That which most interested me was {{what appeared to be a}} bridge several miles away, up the river, and to this I directed my steps, crossing over from the barren and desolate hills to the populous plain.|$|R
