High level of these loans limits banks’ lending activity which results in a decline in credit supply.

The continued poor performance of some banks compelled authorities to expand their systemic restructuring efforts through new interventions and the forced sale of some banks.

40|$|There is {{an ample}} {{literature}} whose main subject {{is to build}} models able to anticipate or provide some early warning signals of problematic financial institutions. This article overview these literature {{in an attempt to}} detect latent fragility in the Chilean financial system. Most applications in this area estimate some probability model with discrete dependent variables that separate, ex-post, failed or bailed-out institutions from the healthy ones, an exercise that during the nineties is not feasible in the Chilean case. We adopt a simpler approach by estimating a linear reduced form model of determination of <b>past</b> <b>due</b> <b>loans</b> and inter-bank spread as measures of financial fragility, which can be interpreted as probability indicators of credit and liquidity risk. Bank financial ratios and macro variables form our set of explanatory variables. The models estimated in this article intend to capture financial fragility in the context of non-crisis environment, which characterizes the Chilean financial system during the present decade. Although some institutions had left the market, failure or insolvency was not the main cause. ...|$|R

If the individual becomes <b>past</b> <b>due</b> on the <b>loan,</b> the financial institution may take {{money out of the}} bank account or freeze the account until the loan becomes current. Because cross-collaterlization reduces the lender's risk, credit unions often offer cross-collateralized loans as a way to give borrowers lower interest rates.|$|R
40|$|In Mexico the December 1994 peso {{devaluation}} {{provoked a}} profound economic downturn {{in that country}} and revealed a fragile banking sector. Fearful that the financial system would collapse under a rising level of <b>past</b> <b>due</b> <b>loans,</b> the Mexican government mounted a rescue of the banking sector by intervening in the daily operations of some problem banks while establishing a series of capitalization and restructuring programs available to all banks.; This article examines Mexico's bank rescue efforts (1995 - 98) with a particular focus {{on the role of}} the deposit insurance fund, the Bank Fund for the Protection of Savings. According to the author, the governmental rescue programs prevented a systemic collapse of the banking sector but cost more than $ 55 billion dollars. The rescue was not entirely successful in restoring the banking sector's credit functions to a productive role in the Mexican economy.; The article also attempts to place the overall rescue effort within a larger context by looking at its economic and political consequences. The Mexican experience suggests that country-specific factors can profoundly affect the success of government policies. The outcome of the bailout in Mexico was significantly shaped by the process of political democratization under way there. The polemical debate surfacing out of the legislative battle over the costs of the bank rescue demonstrates the need for governments to pay more attention to political matters, even when the problems appear economic or technical in nature.

5000|$|There {{were around}} 37 million student loan borrowers with {{outstanding}} student loans in 2013. According to the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, outstanding student loan debt in the United States lies between $902 Billion and $1 Trillion with around $864 Billion in Federal student loan debt. [...] As of Quarter 1 in 2012, the average student loan balance for {{all age groups}} is $24,301. [...] About one-quarter of borrowers owe more than $28,000; 10% of borrowers owe more than $54,000; 3% owe more than $100,000; and less than 1%, or 167,000 people, owe more than $200,000. [...] Of the 37 million borrowers who have outstanding student loan balances, 14%, or about 5.4 million borrowers, {{have at least one}} <b>past</b> <b>due</b> student <b>loan</b> account. [...] For every student loan borrower who defaults, at least two more borrowers become delinquent without default. [...] In 2010 for the first time ever, student loan debt exceeded credit card debt and in 2011 student debt surpassed auto loans (both of which were decreasing). According to Mark Kantrowitz, publisher of FinAid.org, student loan debt is growing by $3,000 per second. According to a report by The Institute for College Access and Success the average debt from those who graduated in 2013 topped $30,000 in six states and was only below $20,000 in one state. Data released by the Federal Reserve Bank of New York showed that {{in the fourth quarter of}} 2014 delinquency rates for students dipped to the point where approximately one in nine student <b>loans</b> is <b>past</b> <b>due.</b> As of 2015 over half of outstanding student loans are in deferral, delinquency or default.

40|$|We {{postulate}} {{a direct}} role for energy {{prices in the}} 2008 financial crisis. Rising energy prices constrain consumer budgets and thereby raise mortgage delinquency rates. This hypothesis is tested by estimating a quarterly cointegrating vector autoregressive (CVAR) model that seeks to quantify {{the factors that influence}} the percentage of US mortgages that are 30 to 89  days <b>past</b> <b>due</b> and those that enter foreclosure. Results identify a long-run relationship for the percentage of US mortgages that are 30 to 89  days <b>past</b> <b>due</b> that includes the interest rate on one-year adjustable mortgages, household expenditures on energy, nominal home prices, rates of home ownership, and the fraction of mortgages 90  days or more <b>past</b> <b>due</b> that enter foreclosure [...] unemployment rates have a short-run effect. Together, these variables account for much of the historical variation in the percentage of US mortgages that are 30 to 89  days <b>past</b> <b>due</b> and indicate that the post 2006 rise in this measure of mortgage delinquency is associated with falling home prices, an increase in household expenditures on energy, and rising unemployment.
