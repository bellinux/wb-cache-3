40|$|In {{this paper}} the {{experimental}} and theoretical investigations of moisture transfer through microporous film <b>laminated</b> <b>leather</b> are presented. The water vapour absorption and desorption processes of <b>laminated</b> <b>leather</b> are described. Water vapour absorption in the <b>laminated</b> <b>leather</b> and its separate layers may {{be classified as}} non-Fickian: sigmoidal – for microporous film and two-stage – for the leather of different structures. Water vapour desorption of leather changes according to the exponential law and for microporous film according to the linear one. Water vapour absorption/desorption mechanism depends on the leather permeability. Microporous film does not worsen moisture transfer properties of the <b>laminated</b> <b>leather.</b> However water vapour permeability decreases and absorption increases due to the nonporous adhesive layer used for microporous film bonding. The decrease of <b>laminated</b> <b>leather</b> permeability intensifies the formation of capillary moisture or water clusters and increases water accumulation...|$|R
40|$|<b>Laminated</b> <b>leather,</b> {{obtained}} by the bonding of the microporous polyurethane film to split leather surface, was used for investigation. Such hybrid leather is resistant to water penetration, but shows high breathable properties. The effect of different nature layers on mechanical properties and viscoelastic behaviour of <b>laminated</b> <b>leather</b> was examined. It was shown that leather backing mainly determines the strength of <b>laminated</b> <b>leather,</b> while polyurethane film – deformability. The combinative strengthening is characteristic for hybrid system due to the repairing of leather surface defects by adhesive layers and dissipation of kinetic energy, which releases during the elementary act of the failure. Generalized Maxwell model, possessing a regular spectrum of relaxation times, successfully describes stress relaxation behaviour of the leather in non-linear regions. The polyurethane film increases the stress relaxation rate in the <b>laminated</b> <b>leather,</b> because rearrangement at the interface of two layers arises. It was obtained that the viscoelastic nature of polyurethane film dominates on the long-term properties of <b>laminated</b> <b>leather...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{water vapour}} {{transfer}} through microporous film <b>laminated</b> <b>leather</b> has been investigated. Water vapour transmission is a multi-stage process, consisting of penetrant absorption, solubility, desorption and diffusion. Adhesively bonded microporous film does not worsen moisture transfer {{properties of the}} <b>laminated</b> <b>leather.</b> Notwithstanding water vapour permeability decreases and absorption increases due to the nonporous adhesive layer. In <b>laminated</b> <b>leather</b> and its layers water vapour absorption may be classified as non-Fickian: sigmoidal – for microporous film and two-stage – for all leather samples. Water vapour accumulation at the leather/adhesive layer interface causes the adhesion loss of coating polyurethane film {{and changes in the}} failure mode. Water vapour induced film delamination begins at the weakened sites of the interface (i. e. small cavities, voids, and topographical irregularities of leather, etc.). Under driving gradient the local accumulation of interfacial water expands and multi-layers of water molecules build up. The splitting of the interfacial water layers begins the loss of adhesion. At long penetrant activity at both sides the film delamination propagation and blister formation in the <b>laminated</b> <b>leather</b> may occur...|$|R

40|$|In September 1981 Memphis {{unveiled}} {{its first}} {{collection at the}} annual Milan furniture fair. The decorated <b>plastic</b> <b>laminate</b> <b>surfaces</b> and bright clashing colours were not only an iconoclastic attack on Italian design’s reputation for good taste but also introduced an identifiable postmodernist aesthetic to be much-imitated throughout the 1980 s. However, the condition of these well-known objects as one-off, hand-crafted prototypes has been totally overlooked, and yet was key, speaking of their provisionality and marginality, and a continuing reliance on Italy’s wealth of artisanal workshops {{as an alternative to}} mainstream industry. Memphis {{was not the first time}} prototypes had played a leading role in the critical turn in post-war Italian design. The self-declared Marxist Enzo Mari had used prototypes in his early 1970 s criticism of the alienating nature of mass production and consumption; curating the 1981 Where is the Artisan? exhibition, Mari included prototypes as one of the primary manifestations of craft in Italy’s post-industrial landscape. While prototypes in multiple materials were included in the Exhibition, all the examples discussed here are low-tech wooden objects that explored the expressive, rather than technical qualities of objects, as in Michele de Lucchi’s prototypes for domestic appliance manufacturer Girmi from 1980. Unlike Memphis, de Lucchi’s prototypes never went into production, seen as too experimental for the design marketplace. By examining the multiple engagement with prototypes in 1970 s and 1980 s, this chapter aims to re-consider Italian design practice in this period, and offers an opportunity to analyse the marginalized role of craft practice in Italy’s post-war design history...|$|R

Polymers in forms of plastics have the most extensive applications {{in all kinds of}} products. This research aims to empirically study wettability of commonly used plastics with symmetrically arranged surface structure, and then proposes a methodology for solids? wettability predictions. The research starts from studying various liquids? contact angles on <b>plastic</b> <b>surfaces.</b> It was found that surface structures within certain dimensions, in terms of liquid-solid contact length parameters, have linear relationship with liquids? contact angles. Results were found explanations by further studied the change of <b>plastics?</b> <b>surface</b> free energy due to their surface structures. Such results were used to develop empirical models for liquids? contact angles and solids? surface free energy estimations, and models were verified by liquid-solid interfacial tensions. The extending research was investigated based on aforementioned results. Liquids? contact angle hysteresis and retentions on inclined surfaces were studied. Liquids? advancing and receding contact angles were found to maintain the same ratio on structured <b>plastic</b> <b>surfaces</b> with various dimensions and inclined angles. The new finding confirms and further extends the statement proposed in the literature. Based on liquid-solid interfacial tension and gravity effect, an empirical formula was proposed to estimate liquids? critical retention volumes on inclined <b>plastic</b> <b>surfaces.</b> Integrating the formula with predicted advancing contact angles, the prediction of liquids? critical retention volumes on structured <b>plastic</b> <b>surfaces</b> becomes possible...|$|R

40|$|Germ {{tubes of}} Candida albicans {{produced}} an additional fibrillar surface layer responsible for enhanced adherence to plastic. The correlation between germination of C. albicans and adherence of germ tubes to a plastic matrix {{led us to}} consider the existence of germ tube-specific adhesive components involved in the attachment process. Using concanavalin A-sensitized latex microspheres, we first detected extracellular molecules on the <b>plastic</b> <b>surface</b> after removal of the adherent germ tubes. Electron microscopy confirmed that fibrils of the germ tube involved in cell-substratum interconnections were retained on the <b>plastic</b> <b>surface.</b> Cytochemistry with concanavalin A-gold labeling demonstrated that these fibrillar structures contained mannoproteins. Dithiothreitol and iodoacetamide treatment of washed plastic allowed us to further characterize these fibrillar adhesins. Through analysis by sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, two components with molecular weights (MWs) of 68, 000 and 60, 000 were detected on the <b>plastic</b> <b>surface.</b> The 68, 000 -MW component appeared {{to be one of}} the major constituents of the germ tube surface layers.

The extinction of oligotrophs after six months was detected in all samples. In contrast, the overall bacterial number recovered on full strength marine agar from the sample flasks with PET did not dramatically reduce.

40|$|The {{effect of}} human plasma and {{isolated}} plasma proteins on the adhesion of mixed human leukocytes to <b>plastic</b> (polystyrene) <b>surfaces,</b> {{with or without}} Ca++ and Mg++ depletion, was investigated.

The results showed that almost all leukocytes adhered to plastics in protein-free buffers, but cell adhesion was hindered in buffers containing plastic proteins. Dialyzed and heat-inactivated plasma, but not serum, were shown to inhibit leukocyte adhesion more than normal plasma. EDTA, Ca ++ - Mg ++ - free buffer or EDTA-pre-incubated leukocytes caused increased inhibition of leukocyte adhesion {{in the presence of}} plasma and some plasma proteins, but not others.
