5000|$|The station {{picks up}} several <b>preempted</b> <b>programs</b> from local {{broadcast}} stations that {{are unable to}} air them: ...|$|R
50|$|Note {{that live}} sports <b>programming</b> <b>preempts</b> the regularly-scheduled <b>programming</b> listed above.|$|R
50|$|Note: Some local {{affiliates}} may <b>preempt</b> network <b>programming.</b>|$|R
50|$|Note: Some local {{affiliates}} may <b>preempt</b> network <b>programming,</b> or air {{shows at}} times not listed.|$|R
50|$|As a CBS affiliate, {{the station}} <b>preempted</b> <b>programming</b> in moderation, {{in favor of}} more locally {{produced}} shows. From 1989 to 1990, the station delayed the first hour of CBS This Morning in favor of the children's show Ready To Go. In February 1994, CBS This Morning was dropped and picked up by WABU (channel 68, now WBPX-TV). WHDH then began airing an expanded local morning newscast.|$|R
5000|$|WVII-TV in Bangor, Maine <b>preempts</b> the <b>program</b> {{in favor}} of airing a {{simulcast}} of the cable shopping network Jewelry Television.|$|R
50|$|Due to its {{commitment}} to local programming, the station was quick to <b>preempt</b> <b>programs,</b> including lower-rated ABC primetime shows. Most of the time, these programs were picked up by independent stations such as WQTV (channel 68, now WBPX-TV) or Worcester-based WHLL (channel 27, now WUNI). Since the mid-1990s, WCVB has carried ABC's entire programming schedule, although it occasionally <b>preempts</b> network <b>programming</b> in favor of locally produced specials and movies. Notable examples are the annual MDA Labor Day Telethon (before the program's 2013 move to ABC) and the 2004 preemption of Saving Private Ryan (one of several ABC stations that preempted the film out of concern over the graphic war battle scenes and profanity that were left intact in the uncut ABC telecast and fear of resulting FCC fines) for another movie, Far and Away.|$|R
25|$|Even in {{the years}} after WPVI became an ABC-owned station, it {{continued}} to preempt an hour of ABC daytime programs in favor of other programs. Wildwood, New Jersey-based NBC affiliate WMGM-TV (channel 40) picked up the pre-empted ABC shows until 1987, when those programs moved back to channel 29, which was now WTXF-TV. The <b>preempted</b> <b>programs</b> were usually magazine shows, game shows or reruns of ABC primetime sitcoms. By the early 1990s, WPVI preempted only the first half-hour of The Home Show.|$|R
50|$|At least 26 Fox {{affiliates}} {{opted to}} <b>preempt</b> the <b>program,</b> 10 of them delaying it until {{a later time}} and at least 16 not showing it at all, due to concerns over {{the nature of the}} program, most of them part of the station groups Local TV LLC and Raycom Media. All Raycom owned/operated affiliates (WBRC, WDFX-TV, WFLX, WTNZ, WPGX, WXIX-TV WFXG, WXTX, and WSFX-TV (the latter two are owned by Southeastern Media Holdings and operated by Raycom)) <b>preempted</b> the <b>program</b> outright.|$|R
50|$|Even in {{the years}} after WPVI became an ABC-owned station, it {{continued}} to preempt an hour of ABC daytime programs in favor of other programs. Wildwood, New Jersey-based NBC affiliate WMGM-TV (channel 40) picked up the pre-empted ABC shows until 1987, when those programs moved back to channel 29, which was now WTXF-TV. The <b>preempted</b> <b>programs</b> were usually magazine shows, game shows or reruns of ABC primetime sitcoms. By the early 1990s, WPVI preempted only the first half-hour of The Home Show.|$|R
50|$|In {{markets where}} an Antenna TV-affiliated station {{acts as a}} {{broadcast}} partner of either sports syndication service, some of its stations (notably among them, WHNT-DT2 in Huntsville, Alabama and WOAI-DT2 in San Antonio) <b>preempt</b> <b>programming</b> carried by the network in order to carry college sports events produced by either the Raycom Sports-operated ACC Network or the Sinclair-owned American Sports Network. While these preemptions typically occur on Saturday afternoons, in many instances, such stations may <b>preempt</b> certain <b>programs</b> aired within the network's prime time lineup, either to allow the affiliated subchannel {{to serve as an}} alternate feed of the partner sports service in lieu of the parent station's main channel or a co-owned/co-managed sister station, or to carry programs aired by a major broadcast network with which the station maintains a primary affiliation so the events can air on the main channel.|$|R
50|$|As {{with other}} networks, {{affiliates}} fill {{the rest of}} the time with their own local and syndicated programming, as well as sports, which would <b>preempt</b> Star <b>programming.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fox Television Stations {{purchased}} KUTP (channel 45) in 2001 {{as part of}} its {{acquisition of}} United Television (which had owned a 50% stake in UPN, until Viacom bought United's share of the network in 2000) forming the Phoenix market's second television duopoly. Although Fox owns both KSAZ and KUTP (now a MyNetworkTV station), neither aired the Saturday morning children's program block eventually known as 4Kids TV, which continued to air on KASW until Fox discontinued its programming agreement with 4Kids Entertainment and replaced the block with the Weekend Marketplace infomercial lineup in December 2008 (which ended up on KAZT-TV, channel 7). With the launch of Xploration Station which will replace Weekend Marketplace in the fall of 2014, KSAZ {{for the first time in}} its history will be clearing its network's entire schedule, although it will occasionally continue to <b>preempt</b> network <b>programming</b> for specials and breaking news coverage (which would result in the <b>preempted</b> <b>programming</b> airing on KUTP).|$|R
50|$|When warranted, Newsroom would air special {{editions of}} the newscast, either within or beyond the current five-edition format. Emulating its {{international}} counterpart, Newsroom <b>preempts</b> <b>programming</b> for rolling news coverage and breaking stories (i.e. Senate and Congress hearings, and hooking up to CNN International during major relevant overseas coverage). However, when special events warrant during the early primetime slot, this function goes to News Night with Pia Hontiveros until 8:00 pm and only under the most dire situations would warrant preemption of the weeknight 9:00 pm edition in favor of uninterrupted coverage starting from where News Night leaves off.|$|R
50|$|The program did not air {{at all in}} the Northwest Territories or Nunavut, as the CBC North {{stations}} in those territories entirely <b>preempted</b> the <b>program</b> in order to offer special local programming in aboriginal languages.|$|R
50|$|NOTE: ABC {{rescinded}} {{the noon}} time slot to affiliates on August 17. Many ABC affiliates <b>preempted</b> network <b>programming</b> to air local {{news in the}} noon time slot. Loving was now available to affiliates at Noon/11:00 CT or 12:30/11:30 CT.|$|R
5000|$|Fox {{returned}} its daytime programming hours {{back to its}} affiliates when Fox Kids {{ended its}} weekday block in December 2001. Many Fox affiliates <b>preempted</b> kids <b>programming</b> in daytime or deferred it to other television stations, opting to air syndicated programs or local news instead.|$|R
50|$|Until {{the late}} 1990s, WCVB {{broadcast}} the 1954 film White Christmas annually {{during the holiday}} season, <b>preempting</b> ABC network <b>programming.</b>|$|R
50|$|The American Family Association urged {{members to}} write letters of {{complaint}} to the media, while the Parents Television Council followed a failed boycott attempt with an effort to convince CBS affiliates to <b>preempt</b> the <b>program.</b> Procter & Gamble and Ace Hardware stopped advertising on the serial.|$|R
50|$|The Red Hand Gang was {{cancelled}} in November 1977 — {{not even}} halfway into the television season. The cancellation was {{partly due to}} its 12:30PM ET time slot, when many key affiliates tend to <b>preempt</b> NBC <b>programming</b> after 12 Noon ET for their own programming, especially college football.|$|R
50|$|The Supreme Court of the United States {{has held}} “good faith and fair dealing” claim about frequent-flyer <b>program</b> <b>preempted</b> by the Airline Deregulation Act.|$|R
50|$|In December 2011, MeTV {{announced}} {{on its website}} that it signed WSAH as its New York City affiliate. On January 4, 2012, WSAH switched from Retro Television Network to MeTV on its primary channel, carrying MeTV's programming from 2 a.m. to 6 a.m. and 9 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. on weekdays and 11:00 a.m. to 12:30 a.m. on weekends. Infomercials run in the hours that MeTV programming is not shown (making it the largest MeTV affiliate not to carry the network's complete schedule, particularly unusual given {{the size of the}} New York City market, and since most MeTV affiliates that <b>preempt</b> <b>programming</b> are in mid-sized and small markets and are alternately affiliated with major broadcast networks). RTV moved to WSAH's second subchannel, replacing the Chinese-language programming. On July 29, 2012, the station's call letters became WZME to reflect its affiliation with MeTV.|$|R
50|$|On August 1, 2011, KMCI began airing a rebroadcast of KSHB's 11:00 a.m. {{newscast}} {{at noon on}} weekdays. In {{addition to}} airing rebroadcasts of local news programming from KSHB-TV, KMCI will take on the responsibility of <b>preempting</b> regular <b>programming</b> and running NBC network shows {{in the event of}} extended breaking news or severe weather coverage on KSHB.|$|R
50|$|Over the years, WNAC-TV did not <b>preempt</b> much network <b>programming.</b> This fact greatly {{appealed to}} CBS when {{it decided to}} abandon WCVB in 1972 and re-affiliate with WNAC.|$|R
50|$|More changes descended upon channel 7 after Belo {{took control}} of the station on January 31, 1995. The station began {{carrying}} UPN programming on January 16; However, until CBS moved to KSTW on March 13, 1995, UPN programs generally aired on weekend afternoons, though KIRO-TV did <b>preempt</b> CBS <b>programming</b> so that it could air the series premiere of Star Trek: Voyager in primetime.|$|R
50|$|Caesars Challenge {{replaced}} Scattergories on NBC's daytime schedule when it premiered on June 13, 1993 and inherited its timeslot of 12:30 pm Eastern. Some affiliates did not air Caesars Challenge at its scheduled time {{due to the}} affiliates' longstanding {{practice of}} <b>preempting</b> <b>programs</b> that the networks aired in the noon hour in favor of news or syndicated programming; this resulted in some stations airing Caesars Challenge in another spot on their schedule while others did not air it at all. In the markets that did air the show at its normal time, Caesars Challenge faced off against CBS' The Young and the Restless, and did not perform well enough against either that series or ABC's Loving, its other competition. NBC cancelled Caesars Challenge after 31 weeks of episodes, and returned the 12:00 pm hour to its affiliates on January 17, 1994. However, NBC would take back the noon hour from its affiliates when Sunset Beach premiered in January 1997.|$|R
50|$|As an NBC affiliate, {{the station}} was known to preempt several hours of network {{programming}} per day - a common practice among Group W television stations affiliated with NBC and CBS. This was significant, since WBZ-TV was NBC's third-largest affiliate, and second-largest in the Eastern Time Zone. It primarily preempted several of the network's morning <b>programs,</b> with most <b>preempted</b> <b>programs</b> appearing on independent stations WSBK-TV and WQTV (now WBPX). In January 1983, when People Are Talking expanded to one hour, WBZ-TV dropped the NBC soap opera Another World, which moved first to WQTV, then to Worcester-based WHLL-TV (now WUNI-TV) and later with Lawrence-licensed WMFP in the early 1990s. The station also dropped a couple of Saturday morning cartoons in 1990 (which also aired on WHLL), even though NBC later abandoned such programming {{in favor of a}} Saturday edition of the morning news show Today and live-action series aimed at teenagers such as Saved by the Bell.|$|R
50|$|On April 19, ABC <b>preempted</b> its primetime <b>programming</b> {{in favor}} of {{covering}} the Boston manhunt, after the Boston Marathon bombing, pushing back the season finale date to May 3, 2013.|$|R
5000|$|As a CBS affiliate, KSL-TV aired {{the drama}} Picket Fences at 11 p.m. on Saturdays instead of 9 p.m. on Fridays in the mid-1990s. The station {{has also been}} known to {{occasionally}} <b>preempt</b> some <b>programs</b> due to content that station management deems objectionable (many of these <b>preempted</b> <b>programs</b> are picked up for broadcast on CW affiliate KUCW, channel 30). The station {{has in the past}} declined to air the short-lived sitcom Coupling because of its sexual content, as well as much of NBC's poker programming such as Poker After Dark (which has since been canceled due to legal complications) due to ownership, Church and viewership objections against gambling. KSL-TV also preempted The Playboy Club upon its October 2011 debut (replacing it with the locally produced newsmagazine We Are Utah, which resembles WCVB-TV/Boston's Chronicle in format), on grounds that the series was [...] "completely inconsistent" [...] with the station's own mission and branding; KSL sponsors the [...] "Out in the Light Campaign," [...] which educates people on problems associated with viewing pornography, and the station {{did not want to be}} associated with the Playboy brand, even though the program did not specifically focus on the magazine nor include any nudity. The program aired on MyNetworkTV affiliate KMYU (channel 12)/KUTV-DT2 (channel 2.2) in its Monday 9 p.m. MT time slot until NBC canceled the show after three episodes. KSL continued to air already filmed episodes of We Are Utah in the 9 p.m. slot until the October 31, 2011 premiere of Rock Center with Brian Williams.|$|R
2500|$|On Christmas Eve, Gabbert would <b>preempt</b> normal <b>programming</b> {{during the}} entire evening and {{broadcast}} {{its own version of}} the Yule Log, a concept borrowed from WPIX in New York City (which incidentally, would also later affiliate with The WB). In the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, the station ran an [...] "oldies dance party" [...] hosted by James Gabbert, and emceed by Sean King.|$|R
50|$|What {{began as}} a {{communication}} between president and Congress has become a communication {{between the president and}} the people of the United States. Since the advent of radio, and then television, the speech has been broadcast live on most networks, <b>preempting</b> scheduled <b>programming.</b> To reach the largest audience, the speech, once given during the day, is now typically given in the evening, after 9pm ET (UTC-5).|$|R
5000|$|On Christmas Eve, Gabbert would <b>preempt</b> normal <b>programming</b> {{during the}} entire evening and {{broadcast}} {{its own version of}} the Yule Log, a concept borrowed from WPIX in New York City (which incidentally, would also later affiliate with The WB). In the late 1980s through the mid-1990s, the station ran an [...] "oldies dance party" [...] hosted by James Gabbert, and emceed by Sean King.|$|R
5000|$|Overnights, WXSP-CD airs a live feed of WOOD-TV's Doppler {{weather radar}} (known as [...] "Storm Track Live"), along with NOAA Weather Radio {{broadcast}} audio. The station may sometimes air NBC or ABC programming whenever WOOD-TV and WOTV preempt such shows for breaking news, local specials, or the annual North American International Auto Show charity preview. However, {{some of the}} <b>preempted</b> ABC <b>programs</b> are available on WZZM-TV (channel 13).|$|R
50|$|On January 11, 1995, WXON {{became a}} charter {{affiliate}} of the upstart WB Television Network. Granite Broadcasting bought WXON {{two years later}} in January 1997 and on October 14 of that year, the station's call letters were changed to WDWB. In 2004, the station became the new over-the-air broadcast home of the NBA's Detroit Pistons, taking the rights from the team's longtime broadcaster, WKBD and was the broadcast home for 15 to 20 Detroit Tigers baseball games produced by Fox Sports Net Detroit. WDWB carried the full WB network schedule, but after joining the network it frequently <b>preempted</b> <b>programming</b> that it rescheduled or did not air in favor of programming such as movies, Big Ten Conference basketball, the Pistons, the Tigers, and from 1999 until 2012, the Jerry Lewis MDA Telethon. Like the baseball and basketball games, the annual MDA telethon was broadcast live, but since the station had no studios to accommodate the local telethon segments, it was produced out of the studios of PBS member station WTVS (channel 56) in the New Center section of downtown Detroit.|$|R
5000|$|In March 1995, WSMC {{formed a}} {{community}} advisory board {{to address these}} concerns. However, as Steverson's group saw it, Southern College had three options—stop <b>preempting</b> NPR <b>programming,</b> move NPR programming to the area's other NPR member station, WUTC, or give up its license to another owner. In June 1995, NPR officials began the process of terminating WSMC's membership {{on the grounds that}} the station <b>preempted</b> NPR <b>programming</b> too often and aired too much religious programming. In response, college officials and station management decided to take action themselves, discontinuing most NPR programming, news included, taking effect on September 30, 1995. Replacing ATC were Public Radio International's The World and American Public Media's Marketplace, which could air on a delayed basis (or even be preempted), instead of live, as ATC does. A few NPR programs remained on the schedule (purchased separately without a network discount); most of the other programs moved to WUTC, which replaced WSMC as the Chattanooga market's flagship NPR station. [...] WSMC has since dropped most NPR programming from its schedule, though it does still air NPR news updates.|$|R
50|$|On April 19, 2013, ABC <b>preempted</b> its primetime <b>programming</b> {{in favor}} of {{coverage}} of the manhunt for Dzhokhar Tsarnaev and Tamerlan Tsarnaev, after the Boston Marathon bombing, pushing back the season finale date to May 3, 2013.|$|R
