During Clinton's term, Arkansas performed its first executions since 1964 (the death penalty had been re-enacted on March 23, 1973).

The plan included a total of $152billion in bipartisan tax cuts over five years.

5|$|Clinton and Obama {{forged a}} good working {{relationship}} without power struggles; {{she was a}} team player within the administration and a defender {{of it to the}} outside and was careful that neither she nor her husband would upstage the <b>president.</b> <b>Clinton</b> formed an alliance with Secretary of Defense Gates as they shared similar strategic outlooks. Obama and Clinton both approached foreign policy as a largely non-ideological, pragmatic exercise. She met with him weekly but did not have the close, daily relationship that some of her predecessors had had with their presidents; moreover, certain key areas of policymaking were kept inside the White House or Pentagon. Nevertheless, the president had trust in her actions.|$|E

5|$|Generally, {{his time}} as housing {{secretary}} was considered unsuccessful. However, although {{he could not get}} federal funding for empowerment zones passed during his tenure, by 1992 38 states had created empowerment zones, and in 1994 $3.5billion was approved for them under <b>President</b> <b>Clinton.</b> A free market Kemp initiative to allow homeowners to subdivide their houses for the purpose of creating rental units without inordinate bureaucracy did not get executed under the Clinton administration, however. In 1992, with H. Ross Perot mounting a formidable campaign, Kemp was again considered a Vice Presidential candidate.|$|E

5|$|In 1996, after {{constructing}} two {{welfare reform}} bills that Clinton vetoed, Gingrich {{and his supporters}} pushed for passage of the Personal Responsibility and Work Opportunity Act, which was intended to reconstruct the welfare system. The act gave state governments more autonomy over welfare delivery, while also reducing the federal government's responsibilities. It instituted the Temporary Assistance for Needy Families program, which placed time limits on welfare assistance and replaced the longstanding Aid to Families with Dependent Children program. Other changes to the welfare system included stricter conditions for food stamp eligibility, reductions in immigrant welfare assistance, and work requirements for recipients. The bill {{was signed into law}} by <b>President</b> <b>Clinton</b> on August 22, 1996.|$|E
