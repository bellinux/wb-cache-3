40|$|The {{cavitation}} {{performance of}} an {{axial flow pump}} with inlet guide vanes for different flow rates is studied in this article. The effects of inlet guide vanes on pump hydraulic performance and cavitation are investigated, where the total vapor fraction of impeller zone (Ftv) is calculated to predict the critical net <b>positive</b> suction <b>head,</b> which is compared with that predicted by efficiency criterion for different flow rates. The influences {{of the development of}} cavitation on internal flow in impeller zone are also investigated. The results obtained show that the cavitation performance of axial flow pump can be improved at off-design flow conditions by adjusting angles of inlet guide vanes to positive values at low flow rates and by regulating angles of inlet guide vanes to negative values at high flow rates. As the net <b>positive</b> suction <b>head</b> decreases, the vapor fraction first increases slowly and then increases greatly, clearly presenting cavitation process from inception to full development, which can be used to predict the required net <b>positive</b> suction <b>head.</b> When net <b>positive</b> suction <b>head</b> decreases to the value around required net <b>positive</b> suction <b>head,</b> the cavitation zone from tip of blade suction side close to leading edge and the cavitation zone from hub part of the blade suction side connect together.

40|$|Background:There {{continues}} to be an ongoing debate regarding the utility of head CT scans in Patients with a normal Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) after minor head injury. The objective {{of this study is to}} determine Patient and injury characteristics that predict a <b>positive</b> <b>head</b> CT scan or need for a neurosurgical procedure (NSP) among Patients with blunt head injury and a normal GCS. Materials and Methods: Retrospective analysis of adult Patients in the National Trauma Data Bank who presented to the ED with a history of blunt head injury and a normal GCS of 15. The primary outcomes were a <b>positive</b> <b>head</b> CT scan or a NSP. Multivariate logistic regression controlling for Patient and injury characteristics was used to determine predictors of each outcome. Results: Out of a total of 83, 566 Patients, 24, 414 (29. 2 %) had a <b>positive</b> <b>head</b> CT scan and 3476 (4. 2 %) underwent a NSP. Older Patients and Patients with a history of fall (compared with a motor vehicle crash) were more likely to have a positive finding on a head CT scan. Male Patients, African-Americans (compared with Caucasians), and those who presented with a fall were more likely to have a NSP. Conclusions: Older age, male gender, ethnicity, and mechanism of injury are significant predictors of a positive finding on head CT scans and the need for neurosurgical procedures.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{temperature}} and fluid properties on pump cavitatzon performance are discussed. Consideration {{is given to}} the problems of measuring net <b>positive</b> suction <b>head</b> and a novel test technique is described for examining cavitation performance using a closed loop system.

In conflict with theory the pump performance with kerosine is inferior to that with cold water as net <b>positive</b> suction <b>head</b> is reduced.

40|$|Paper {{presented}} at the 5 th International Conference on Heat Transfer, Fluid Mechanics and Thermodynamics, South Africa, 1 - 4 July, 2007. This paper presents a theoretical model for the prediction of the incipient of cavitation in centrifugal pumps. The model includes the physical fluid parameters and the real working phenomena at off-design condition. The parameters considered in the model were flow rate ratio, pump rational speed, water temperature, thermodynamic properties of water, nuclei and gas content, relative velocity and incidence angle. The thermodynamic effect had a more complex expression compared with other parameters. The present model has been tested against extensive earlier published experimental results in centrifugal pumps at wide operating conditions. The comparison of the predicted net <b>positive</b> suction <b>head</b> at inception with the published data showed a good agreement was achieved. This agreement means that the roles played by operating parameters, off-design phenomena and thermodynamic properties of water {{are consistent with the}} present model. The results obtained from the present model make it possible to explain why {{there is a difference between}} the real net <b>positive</b> suction <b>head</b> values and the theoretical ones in the previous published models.

40|$|International audienceThe {{hydraulic}} {{properties of}} the topsoil control the partition of rainfall into infiltration and runoff at the soil surface.

This study {{presents the results of}} a field campaign documenting topsoil hydraulic properties in a small French suburban catchment (7 km 2) located near Lyon, France. Two types of infiltration tests were performed: single ring infiltration tests under <b>positive</b> <b>head</b> and tension-disk infiltration using a mini-disk. Both categories were processed using the BEST [...] Beerkan Estimation of Soil Transfer parameters [...] method to derive parameters describing the retention and hydraulic conductivity curves. Dry bulk density and particle size data were also sampled. Almost all the topsoils were found to belong to the sandy loam soil class. No significant differences in hydraulic properties were found in terms of pedologic units, but the results showed a high impact of land use on these properties. The lowest dry bulk density values were obtained in forested soils with the highest organic matter content. Permanent pasture soils showed intermediate values, whereas the highest values were encountered in cultivated lands. For saturated hydraulic conductivity, the highest values were found in broad-leaved forests and small woods. The complementary use of tension-disk and <b>positive</b> <b>head</b> infiltration tests highlighted a sharp increase of hydraulic conductivity between near saturation and saturated conditions, attributed to macroporosity effect. The ratio of median saturated hydraulic conductivity to median hydraulic conductivity at a pressure of − 20 mm of water was about 50. The study suggests that soil texture, such as used in most pedo-transfer functions, might not be sufficient to properly map the variability of soil hydraulic properties. Land use information should be considered in the parameterizations of topsoil within hydrological models to better represent in situ conditions, as illustrated in the paper.

40|$|AIM—To {{evaluate}} the possible relation between adenosine sensitive syncope and tilt induced vasovagal syncope.  METHODS—An ATP test {{and a head}} up tilt test were performed in 175  consecutive patients with syncope of uncertain origin. The ATP test consisted of the rapid intravenous injection of 20  mg of ATP; a positive response {{was defined as the}} induction of a ventricular pause (maximum RR interval) ⩾  6000 ms. The head up tilt test was performed at 60 ° for 45  minutes; if negative, 0. 4  mg oral glyceryl trinitrate spray was given and the test continued for a further 20  minutes; a positive response was defined as induction of syncope in the presence of bradycardia, hypotension, or both.  RESULTS—Of the 121  patients with a positive response, 77  (64 %) had a <b>positive</b> <b>head</b> up tilt alone, 18  (15 %) had a positive ATP test alone, and in 26  (21 %) both ATP and head up tilt were positive. Compared with the patients with isolated <b>positive</b> <b>head</b> up tilt, those with isolated positive ATP were older (mean (SD) age, 68  (10) v 45  (20) years), had a lower median number of syncopal episodes (2  v 3), a shorter median duration of syncopal episodes (4  v 36  months), a lower prevalence of situational, vasovagal, or triggering factors (11 % v 64 %), a lower prevalence of warning symptoms (44 % v 71 %), and a higher prevalence of systemic hypertension (22 % v 5 %) and ECG abnormalities (28 % v 9 %). The patients with a positive response to both tests had intermediate features. Of the 44  positive responses to the ATP test, atrioventricular block was the cause of the ventricular pause in 43; of the 29  positive cardioinhibitory responses to head up tilt, sinus arrest was present in 23  cases and atrioventricular block in six.  CONCLUSIONS—ATP and head up tilt tests identify different populations of patients affected by syncope; these have different general clinical features, different histories of syncopal episodes, and different mechanism sites of action. Therefore, adenosine sensitive syncope and tilt induced vasovagal syncope are two distinct clinical entities.    Keywords: syncope; adenosine; ATP; head up til...|$|E
40|$|Several {{studies show}} that human {{papillomavirus}} (HPV) <b>positive</b> <b>head</b> and neck cancers (HNSCC) are typically characterized by low tumor and high regional node stages, intrinsically indicating high local metastatic potential. Despite this, the distant metastasis rates of HPV positive and negative HNSCC are similar. To date, majority of the studies focus on molecular characterization of HPV positive disease and on treatment outcome. Here we assessed the biological mechanisms of metastasis by combining in vitro and in vivo head and neck carcinoma xenograft models with patient data. We provide experimental evidence for a dual role of p 16, a surrogate marker for HPV infections, in the metastasis process of HNSCC. We found that p 16 regulates the invasiveness and metastatic potential of HNSCC cells by impairing angiogenesis. In parallel, we found that p 16 is regulating the nodal spread by mediating lymphatic vessel formation through the upregulation of integrins. These findings not only provide understanding of the biology of the different dissemination patterns but also suggest that inhibition of lymphangiogenesis in HPV positive cancers and inhibition of angiogenesis in HPV negative cancers can form a treatment strategy against metastasis. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|To {{maintain}} optimum {{mechanical properties}} in glutaraldehyde-treated heart-valve tissue the full collagen crimp geometry originally {{present in the}} relaxed fresh tissue should be retained. By varying the pressure at which glutaraldehyde fixation is carried out, considerable alterations to this crimp geometry can be achieved. The mechanical stiffness of the preserved tissue is consequently affected, and this in turn has a striking influence on both the opening behaviour of the valve {{and the degree of}} strain localisation in the leaflet tissue. A pressure of 100 mmHg eliminated the collagen crimp geometry entirely, and this resulted in the formation of sites of local strain or kinks in the valve leaflets during opening. It is expected that this strain localisation phenomenon will influence the long-term fatigue durability of the treated tissue. Pressures even as low as 4 mmHg result in significant reductions of crimp geometry. Fresh valves should therefore be fixed under a <b>positive</b> <b>head</b> of pressure sufficient only to ensure that the leaflets seal along their coapting free margins.
