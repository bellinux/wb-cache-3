2500|$|Bleed air {{produced}} by gas turbine engines is compressed air that {{is taken from}} the compressor stage of those engines, which is upstream of the fuel-burning sections. In modern airliner engines, two regulator valves (high stage and low stage) turn on and off automatically and are controlled by at least [...] "...two air supply and cabin pressure controllers (ASCPCs) which open and close appropriate valves. Engine bleed air comes from the high stage or low stage engine compressor section. Low stage air is used during high power setting operation, and high stage air is used during descent and other low power setting operations." [...] Bleed air from that system can be utilized for internal cooling of the engine, cross-starting another engine, engine and airframe anti-icing, cabin pressurization, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuators,</b> air-driven motors, pressurizing the hydraulic reservoir, and waste and water storage tanks.

40|$|Silicon wafers {{are getting}} bigger and bigger in the {{production}} line, aiming for faster manufacturing, lower cost and higher yield. The handling/transportation technique {{is becoming more and}} more critical during the production. As the wafer is being handled with physical contact there is always risk of damage and contemination coming from the contact surface. Contactless wafer stage utilizes a thin film of pressurized air to support the wafer, provides wafer handling without physical contact, hence reducing the risk of damage and contamination. A special contactless 3 DoF wafer stage called "the Flowerbed" is developed by H. P. Vuong during his PhD research. This flowerbed has a creative mechanical design to combine the wafer support and driving function, so that the wafer can be supported and driven by pressurized air with 3 degrees of freedom (x-y-theta). The goal of this MSc research is to design an actuation system for the Flowerbed, and design a special <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuator</b> specific for this application. Two actuation configurations are discussed and the concept of 3 -RPR parallel manipulator is chosen. <b>Pneumatic</b> <b>actuator</b> is chosen to be the type of actuator in this research. This <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuator</b> has to be specially made, because the requirement of the actuators is, that it should have a stroke of 80 micro meters, with a maximum force of higher than 140 N, and the required bandwidth is 150 Hz. Such <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuator</b> is rarely seen and is not available. A model is developed for this special <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuator,</b> and is validated by test setups. Further development is made by a design with piezo buzzer. This piezo buzzer is implemented as a low cost valve with high performance, and the use of piezo buzzer makes it possible to integrate the valve into the actuator housing, hence further reduce the cost and improve the performance. A prototype is made to demonstrate the feasibility of such kind of <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuator.</b> This prototype meets the requirement of the actuator and has very good performance for small range of stroke. However due to the weakness of the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuator,</b> the performance of large stroke must be improved.

40|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> <b>actuator</b> {{is widely}} used in the {{automation}} industry and {{in the field of}} automatic control due to its advantages such as high power to weight ratio, costeffective and uses air as a clean medium to drive it. However, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuator</b> also has some drawback in control due to the nonlinear factors such as air compressibility and friction. Therefore, the purpose of this research is to design a controller that will control the position of the cylinder pneumatic stroke. Fuzzy Logic Control is proposed because of its simplicity in terms of less mathematical equation and also its performance in controlling the nonlinearities. Three different types of Fuzzy Logic controller were designed and compared to observe the performance of the controller in controlling the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuator.</b> An optimization method of the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) algorithm is used in tuning the fuzzy control parameter. PSO is used to find the best value of the parameter involved in the controller design. Both controllers and optimization method are designed using MATLAB/Simulink platform from position transfer function obtained by System Identification (SI) technique. Then, the simulation results are analyzed and validated with real-time experiment using the Data Acquisition (DAQ) card. The experiment has been done to the <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuator</b> with different loads and positions target.

50|$|<b>Pneumatic</b> <b>actuators,</b> or {{pneumatic}} cylinders, {{are similar}} to hydraulic actuators except they use compressed gas to generate force instead of a liquid. They work similarly to a piston in which air is pumped inside a chamber and pushed out {{of the other side}} of the chamber. Air actuators are not necessarily used for heavy duty machinery and instances where large amounts of weight are present. One of the reasons pneumatic linear actuators are preferred to other types is the fact that the power source is simply an air compressor. Because air is the input source, <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuators</b> are able to be used in many places of mechanical activity. The downside is, most air compressors are large, bulky, and loud. They are hard to transport to other areas once installed. Pneumatic linear actuators are likely to leak and this makes them less efficient than mechanical linear actuators.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — A <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuator</b> with {{solenoid valves}} is a discontinuous-input system because each valve {{can be either}} in on or off state. For such an actuator, this paper proposes a sliding-mode control scheme based on an {{averaged}} continuous-input equivalent model for the open-loop system. The averaged model is obtained from the nonlinear dynamics of the open-loop discontinuous-input system undergoing pulse-width-modulation (PWM) at the input (i. e., valve open/close action). The PWM duty cycle will {{be regarded as a}} continuous input to the proposed averaged model, and thus generated by the proposed sliding-mode controller. By adjusting the PWM duty cycle, the controller switches between seven modes of operation of the open-loop system in order to select the ones with necessary and sufficient amounts of drive energy to achieve position tracking. We will show that this results in reduced position error and valve switching activity for the actuator. The proposed control scheme is experimentally used in the position control of a <b>pneumatic</b> <b>actuator</b> and the results are presented.
