To this end, it was specifically studied {{the effect of the}} locking beam on the <b>pile</b> <b>caps</b> when supported by the lateral walls of the socket. A three-dimensional numerical analysis was developed using a software based on the finite element method (FEM), which considered the nonlinear physical behavior of the materials. It was found that for strut angle inclination close to 45 º, the <b>pile</b> <b>caps</b> showed the same behavior, independent of the wall interfaces. The results indicated that the presence of a locking beam has no significant influence on the <b>pile</b> <b>caps</b> behavior and that the socket wall is able to effectively transfer the force from the beam to the piles. ...|$|R

40|$|The <b>piles</b> <b>cap</b> is an {{important}} structural element whose function is to transfer {{the actions of the}} superstructure for a group of piles. The visual inspection of the <b>piles</b> <b>cap</b> behavior under service conditions is not possible and, in addition, the knowledge of its actual structural performance is a vital necessity for the constructions overall stability. In this paper, a two-dimensional nonlinear analysis is carried out, by means of Finite Element Method, of a reinforced concrete <b>pile</b> <b>caps</b> with two <b>piles</b> found in the literature. It adopts for the material concrete a constitutive model based on the Continuum Damage Mechanics, with the possibility to provide a tensile and compression differentiated behavior. The steel is described by an elastoplastic bilinear model. The equilibrium path is achieved by Arc Length iteration technique in association with the Newton - Raphson Method.

40|$|A large {{percentage}} of <b>pile</b> <b>caps</b> support only one column, and the <b>pile</b> <b>caps</b> in turn are supported by only a few piles. These are typically short and deep members with overall span-depth ratios of less than 1. 5. Codes of practice do not provide uniform treatment {{for the design of}} these types of <b>pile</b> <b>caps.</b> These members have traditionally been designed as beams spanning between piles with the depth selected to avoid shear failures and the amount of longitudinal reinforcement selected to provide sufficient flexural capacity as calculated by the engineering beam theory. More recently, the strut-and-tie method has been used for the design of <b>pile</b> <b>caps</b> (disturbed or D-region) in which the load path is envisaged to be a three-dimensional truss, with compressive forces being supported by concrete compressive struts between the column and piles and tensile forces being carried by reinforcing steel located between piles. Both of these models have not provided uniform factors of safety against failure or been able to predict whether failure will occur by flexure (ductile mode) or shear (fragile mode). In this paper, an analytical model based on the strut-and-tie approach is presented. The proposed model has been calibrated using an extensive experimental database of <b>pile</b> <b>caps</b> subjected to compression and evaluated analytically for more complex loading conditions. It has been proven to be applicable across a broad range of test data and can predict the failures modes, cracking, yielding, and failure loads of four-pile caps with reasonable accuracy.

50|$|Arguably {{the largest}} {{part of the}} {{renovation}} was improving the building's resistance to earthquake damage. A base isolation system was installed under the building to provide this protection. The building's isolation system is composed {{of a network of}} 280 base isolators, each 20 in high, and between 36 in and 44 in in diameter. Installing the isolators required excavating the dirt around and beneath the capitol, exposing the foundation and footings. The original concrete support columns were then attached to a network of new load transfer beams, which extended horizontally from under the building, and were supported by <b>pile</b> <b>caps</b> under and along the perimeter of the capitol. The support columns were then detached from the original footings, leaving the building sitting on the load transfer beams and <b>pile</b> <b>caps.</b> A new concrete mat was poured around and on top of the original footings, leaving a space between the new load transfer beams and the concrete mat. The base isolators were then installed on top of the concrete mat, directly above the covered footings. Once all the isolators had been installed the temporary supports between the <b>pile</b> <b>caps</b> and load transfer beams were removed, leaving the beams to sit directly on the isolators, which sit on the concrete mat foundation. The isolators are made of layers of laminated rubber, and are very strong vertically but not horizontally, which allows the building to rock gently back and forth as the ground underneath moves during an earthquake.|$|R
