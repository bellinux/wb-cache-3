5|$|The points {{classification}} {{was determined}} by adding together the points that each rider won on each stage. <b>Points</b> <b>were</b> awarded for coming in the top ten in the stage (the winner won 15 points; the tenth-placed rider won one point). <b>Points</b> <b>were</b> also awarded for coming {{in the top three}} in the intermediate sprints that took place on each road stage (three points for the winner, two for the second-placed rider and one for the third). The leader of the points classification was awarded a silver jersey.|$|E
30|$|As {{defined in}} Section  2.2, an {{interior}} grid <b>point</b> <b>is</b> a neighboring <b>point</b> when it <b>is</b> {{not in the}} contact set but one of its adjacent grid <b>points</b> <b>is</b> in the contact set. Thus the neighboring <b>points</b> can <b>be</b> found more effectively as follows. Visit each point in the contact set; if any one of its four adjacent <b>points</b> <b>is</b> not in the contact set, then the non-contacting <b>point</b> <b>is</b> a neighboring <b>point.</b> The set of all neighboring <b>points</b> <b>is</b> the neighboring set N_h.|$|R
50|$|The {{game has}} six levels, {{each of which}} {{features}} increased speed and scoring. Each level is represented by a differently-colored background.

5|$|The second {{classification}} was {{the points}} classification. On {{each stage of}} the race, <b>points</b> <b>were</b> awarded to the top 10 riders. The winner won 12 points, with 10 for the second-placed rider, 8 for the third-placed rider and then one point fewer for each place down to tenth place. <b>Points</b> <b>were</b> also awarded to the top four riders at intermediate sprints, with five points for {{the winner of the}} sprint and three, two and one points for the riders in second, third and fourth places respectively. It was originally intended that points would not be awarded on stage 1 as it was a team time trial. After this was changed to an individual time trial, however, <b>points</b> <b>were</b> awarded on the stage, on the same scale as for an intermediate sprint. The winner of the points classification was awarded a red jersey.|$|E
5|$|The third {{classification}} was {{the mountains}} classification. <b>Points</b> <b>were</b> {{awarded to the}} riders that reached {{the summit of the}} most difficult climbs first. The climbs were categorised as fourth-, third-, second- or first-category and hors catégorie, with the more difficult climbs rated lower. Double <b>points</b> <b>were</b> awarded on the summit finishes on stages 9, 12, 17 and 19. The leader wore a white jersey with red polka dots.|$|E
5|$|There {{was also}} a {{mountains}} classification, the leadership of which was marked by a red and white polka-dot jersey. In the mountains classification, <b>points</b> <b>were</b> won by reaching {{the top of a}} climb before other cyclists. Each climb was categorised as either hors, first, second, third, or fourth-category, with more points available for the higher-categorised climbs. Hors catégorie climbs awarded the most points, with 20points on offer for the first rider across the summit; the first ten riders were able to accrue points towards the mountains classification, compared with the first eight on first-category passes and the first six riders on second-category climbs. Fewer <b>points</b> <b>were</b> on offer for the smaller hills, marked as third-category or fourth-category.|$|E
5000|$|Please note: a {{different}} <b>points</b> system <b>is</b> {{being used in}} this tournament. 2 <b>points</b> <b>are</b> awarded for a win, and 1 <b>point</b> <b>is</b> awarded for a draw.

2500|$|A turning <b>point</b> <b>is</b> a <b>point</b> {{at which}} the {{derivative}} changes sign. A turning <b>point</b> may <b>be</b> either a relative maximum or a relative minimum (also known as local minimum and maximum). If the function is differentiable, then a turning <b>point</b> <b>is</b> a stationary point; however not all stationary <b>points</b> <b>are</b> turning <b>points.</b> If the function is twice differentiable, the stationary <b>points</b> that <b>are</b> not turning <b>points</b> <b>are</b> horizontal inflection <b>points.</b> For example, the function [...] has a stationary point at x=0, which is also an inflection <b>point,</b> but <b>is</b> not a turning point.|$|R

The emergence of younger defenseman Matt Hunwick was partly responsible for his expandability.
