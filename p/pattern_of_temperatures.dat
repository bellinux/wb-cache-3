40|$|This report {{provides}} {{a review of}} the Winter of 1995 - 1996 [...] a winter of unusual extremes in parts of the country. Although December was not unusually active, January and February proved to be quite interesting. Those months included the following extreme events: the January blizzard and ensuing flooding in the Northeast, and then in February [...] a severe cold wave, Pacific Northwest flooding, and unusual warmth and fires in the southern plains. Another interesting aspect of the past winter was the 'seesaw ' <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperatures</b> and precipitation over much of the nation. Extremely cold conditions (such as early February) were often followed by unusual warmth. The same applied to precipitation, with the Northwest beginning the season on the dry side, and then moving into a very wet pattern. Therefore, as is sometimes the case in climatology, the averages of the season as a whole belie the extremes contained within...|$|E
40|$|PIXIE is a {{recently}} proposed middle-class explorer mission designed to produce full-sky maps of polarization in the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB). PIXIEs challenging science goals require not only measuring the extremely faint b-modes of the CMB, but distinguishing between true CMB signatures and 1) polarized light reflecting off local dust, and 2) signals arising {{from within the}} instrument. PIXIEs detectors will operate at 100 mK {{in order to achieve}} the required sensitivity. Instrument errors will be minimized in part by operating the telescope and optics at an average temperature close to that of the CMB (2. 72 K) and systematically varying the temperature of various components by a small amount (10 - 20 mK). Signals appearing at the frequency of those variations can then be subtracted out. For this to be successful at the level required, it is necessary for the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperatures</b> to be stable over very long time frames. Consequently, cooling of the detectors and telescope will be done using two 3 -stage ADR assemblies that will produce continuous cooling, one at 100 mK and the other at approximately 2. 65 K. The latter will act as the heat sink for 100 mK ADR and establish a base temperature from which the telescope and optics will be regulated. Its heat sink is a 4. 5 K cryocooler. The design and operation of the ADRs will be discussed...|$|E
40|$|Abstract [...] Characterization of the Nonesuch Formation, middle {{unit of the}} Proterozoic Oronto Group, as a {{potential}} hydrocarbon source for the Lake Superior basin portion of the Midcontinent Rift system requires {{an understanding of the}} thermal maturity of the region and its relationship to the thermal history. Illite/smectite (I/S) expandability data were collected from the Nonesuch Formation and the overlying Freda Sandstone and compared with organic thermal maturity data; both data sets coupled with a thermal and burial history for the White Pine area of Michigan allow regional interpretation f maximum formation temperatures of the Nonesuch Formation and the Freda Sandstone with respect to time. Samples collected from drill holes in northeastern Wisconsin display nearly pure smectite within the lower Freda Sandstone trending abruptly to ordered I/S within the Nonesuch Formation. Regular trends of decreasing expand-ability with depth occur in four other drill holes to the northeast. Comparison ofI/S expandability between similar stratigraphic ntervals reveals a significant trend of increasing thermal maturity to the northeast, with the lowest thermal maturities observed in the Iron River Syncline area just west of White Pine, Michigan. I/S geothermometry suggests maximum temperatures in the Nonesuch Formation of 140 ~ in Wis-consin, 115 ~ in the Iron River Syncline area, 160 ~ at White Pine, and 190 ~ near the southern portions of the Keweenaw Copper District. The geographic <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperatures</b> determined from I/S geother-mometry is identical to that determined from organic thermal maturity indicators in the Nonesuc...|$|E

40|$|The IPCC {{projections}} show {{changes in}} <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperatures</b> and rainfall and greater frequency of extreme events. Despite these disclosures, some skeptical {{scientists believe that}} the planet temperature is undergoing cyclical and natural changes, sometimes going heating some others going cooling. According to these concerns, there are many doubts and uncertainties related to climate change and its consequences, and that all events related to the actual weather and climate changes should not always be related to global warming. The objective of this work was to detect trends in pattern of maximum and minimum air temperatures for the period from 1961 to 2008, at Recife-PE, Brazil, through the RClimdex (2. 9. 0) software, {{with the purpose of}} giving support to studies of uncertainties surrounding the management of the climate change. The results showed an increase in maximum and minimum air temperature with the development of heat waves in the study region. Based in these results it is possible to conclude that the study area is becoming warmer with tendency more to climatic change than climatic variability. However, {{it is not possible to}} say that these observed climatic indexes tendencies are only related to global climatic changes, once the contribution of several local factors may have modified the regional climate. For instance, the substitution of vegetated areas by asphalt, industries, among others surface covering elements may contributed to the formation of heat waves and altered the local climate...|$|E
40|$|Several {{building}} codes {{are now available}} {{for the design of}} concrete structures reinforced with FRP even if no calculation model taking account of fire conditions has been suggested. Only the Canadian code (CAN/CSA 806 - 02) provides a design procedure in fire situations based on critical temperature. Furthermore, the literature provides some significant experimental results of failure tests performed on FRP–reinforced concrete members working in flexure that were exposed to conventional fire conditions. Tests recently performed by the authors allowed the behavior of six concrete slabs reinforced with GFRP bars exposed to fire action to be evaluated: four slabs were tested under typical design loads in fire situations (40 % and 60 % of design bending moment resistance at normal temperature) and two unloaded slabs were tested after the cooling phase in order to evaluate their residual resistance. In the present paper the experimental programme is extensively reported, giving detailed information on tests to highlight the practical significance of the experimental research. The results of investigations are discussed with particular reference to the structural behavior of concrete members once the glass transition temperature in the bars is attained and resin softening reduces adhesion at the FRP-to-concrete interface. Results are shown with the aim of providing suggestions for updating design codes. In a companion paper the <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperatures</b> recorded during the tests by means of thermocouples applied both on the surface of bars and in the concrete are presented in depth and compared with results of numerical simulations...|$|E
40|$|Several {{recent studies}} have {{compared}} observed changes in near-surface <b>temperature</b> with <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature</b> change predicted by climate models in response to combined forcing by carbon dioxide and anthropogenic sulphate aerosols. These results suggest that a combined carbon dioxide + sulphate aerosol signal is easier to identify in the observations than a <b>pattern</b> <b>of</b> <b>temperature</b> change due to carbon dioxide alone. This work compares modelled and observed <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> vertical <b>temperature</b> change in the atmosphere. Results show that the observed and model-predicted changes in the mid- to low troposphere are in better accord with greenhouse warming predictions when the likely effects of anthropogenic sulphate aerosols and stratospheric ozone reduction are incorporated in model calculations, and {{that the level of}} agreement increases with time. This improved correspondence is primarily due to hemispheric-scale temperature contrasts. If current model-based estimates of natural internal variability are realistic, {{it is likely that the}} level of time-increasing similarity between modelled and predicted <b>patterns</b> <b>of</b> vertical <b>temperature</b> change is partially due to human activities...|$|R

At any rate, the few other existing studies are hinting towards the same result [17, 18].
