40|$|Abstract. Four {{semantics}} {{for a small}} {{programming language}} involving unbounded (but countable) nondeterminism are provided. These comprise an operational semantics, two state transformation semantics based on the Egli-Milner and Smyth orders, respectively, and a weakest precondition semantics. Their equivalence is proved. A Hoare-like <b>proof</b> system for <b>total</b> correctness is also introduced and its soundness and completeness in an appropriate sense are shown. Finally, the recursion theoretic complexity of the notions introduced is studied. Admission of countable nondeterminism results in a lack of continuity of various semantic functions, and this is shown to be necessary for any semantics satisfying appropriate conditions. In <b>proofs</b> of <b>total</b> correctness, one resorts {{to the use of}} (countable) ordinals, and it is shown that all recursive ordinals are needed...|$|R

40|$|AbstractWe {{begin by}} {{classifying}} all solutions of two natural recurrences that Bernstein polynomials satisfy. The first scheme gives a natural characterization of Stancu polynomials. In Section 2, we identify the Bernstein polynomials as coefficients in the generating function for the elementary symmetric functions, which gives a new <b>proof</b> of <b>total</b> positivity for Bernstein polynomials, {{by identifying the}} required determinants as Schur functions. In the final section, we introduce {{a new class of}} approximation polynomials based on the symplectic Schur functions. These polynomials are shown to agree with the polynomials introduced by Vaughan Jones in his work on subfactors and knots. We show that they have the same fundamental properties as the usual Bernstein polynomials: variation diminishing (whose proof uses symplectic characters), uniform convergence, and conditions for monotone convergence...|$|R

30|$|Productivity is a <b>proof</b> of <b>total</b> {{efficiency}} of production process {{and also a}} subject of maximization. It is determined by comparing the quantity of output and input and is also {{considered to be a}} significant measure of any economy, industry, and company’s development. However, it requires an appropriate identification of real inputs and outputs within a business. Productivity is one of the considerable concerns of engineering management, so that it has been causing companies to follow procedures of collecting and analyzing data in order to evaluate their performance. Productivity improvement stems from a certain degree of complex interaction among factors. Teamwork and IT are two decisive factors which may cause immediate effect on the way productivity can be improved. Investing in ICT capital increases firm productivity by increasing the productivity of labor (Kılıçaslan et al. 2017).|$|R

40|$|Logical {{frameworks}} are languages used {{to represent}} information. In this dissertation we present the Delphin programming language, which is a functional programming syntax and dependent types. Higher-order abstract syntax, or HOAS, refers to the technique of representing variables of an object language using variables of a metalanguage, which leads to more concise and elegant encodings than first-order alternatives. Dependent types allow one to represent complex data (such as derivations in various logics) and enforce more properties of programs than possible using only simple types. Delphin {{is not only a}} useful programming language but also a useful system for formalizing <b>proofs</b> as <b>total</b> functions express <b>proofs</b> that the input entails the output. Just as representations using HOAS free the programmer from concerns of handling explicit contexts and substitutions, our system permits computation and reasoning over such encodings without making these constructs explicit, leading to concise and elegant programs. Delphin is a two-level system distinguishing functions use...|$|R
40|$|Higher-order {{abstract}} syntax {{is a central}} representation technique in logical frameworks which maps variables of the object language into variables of the meta language. On the one hand, encodings using this idea are often extremely concise and elegant, on the other, higher-order representations are no longer inductive, which means that standard techniques for reasoning by induction do not apply. In this proposal, we present a meta-logic for LF (M!) which overcomes this problem by representing inductive <b>proofs</b> as <b>total</b> functions. It uses recursion and pattern-matching to mimic strong induction principles. Because of the elegant representation of proofs {{it is possible to}} devise an efficient proof search algorithm for a fragment M 2 of M!. It has been implemented as an automated theorem prover for the proof assistant Twelf, a reimplementation and extension of the logic programming language Elf.

By then, the price of copper had risen; in 1797, a pound of copper had coined 16 pence of coins, and in 1799 that amount of metal had made 18 pence worth, but it took 24 of the 1806 pennies to weigh a pound. The pennies were issued dated 1806 or 1807; they weigh [...] 18.9grams ( [...] ounces) and measure 34 millimetres (one and a third inches) in diameter [...] These were more conventionally designed, also by Küchler, with a right facing bust of the King and the same inscription as on the obverse of 1797 pennies.

These predicates allow collapsing execution histories into equivalence classes of conditional traces. Using this approach, {{it is possible that}} the execution of two operations will be dependent in one context and independent in another. The predicates allow defining a family of possible semantic definitions for each language, where each is an extension of previous standard definitions.
