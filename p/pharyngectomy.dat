40|$|Abstract: Background. Surgery for {{squamous}} cell carci-noma (SCC) arising or extending to the hypopharynx is generally reserved for advanced disease or salvage. The {{prognosis of patients}} requiring <b>pharyngectomy</b> is poor, and the perioperative morbidity is significant. The aim {{of the present study}} is to describe the disease-related and treatment-related outcomes of patients undergoing primary and salvage <b>pharyngectomy</b> for cancer of the hypopharynx and larynx over a 10 -year period from a single institution. Methods. We retrospectively reviewed 138 partial and cir-cumferential pharyngectomies performed at a tertiary referral center between 1992 and 2002. There were 31 females and 107 males. The median age was 62 years (range, 27 â€“ 81 years), and mean follow-up was 3. 6 years. Salvage <b>pharyngectomy</b> for radi-ation failure was performed in 72 patients (52 %), and in 6...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Background. Patients {{treated by}} a {{circular}} pha-ryngolaryngectomy for advanced hypopharyngeal carcinoma have a poor prognosis and disappointing speech restoration. Methods. Three carefully selected patients underwent a near-total laryngectomy circular <b>pharyngectomy</b> with jejunal free flap repair and dynamic tracheopharyngeal shunt {{for treatment of}} advanced hypopharyngeal carcinoma. They received induc-tion chemotherapy and postoperative radiotherapy. We as-sessed the functional outcome. Results. There was no major local complication. One year {{after the end of}} radiotherapy, all patients were able to eat solid diets. Two patients were able to speak immediately {{after the end of the}} treatment. After speech re-education, a high-quality tracheopharyngeal voice was restored in all three patients.

40|$|Between 1982 and 1985, 83 {{patients}} with hypopharyngeal or extensive laryngeal cancers underwent pharyngoesophagectomy (48 patients), circumferential <b>pharyngectomy</b> (8 patients) and partial <b>pharyngectomy</b> (27 patients), {{depending on the}} site and extent of tumor involvement. The resultant hypopharyngeal defects were reconstructed with gastric transposition, a tubed pectoralis major myocutaneous flap, and a pectoralis major flap patch, respectively. There were three hospital deaths in the gastric transposition group (6 percent) and none in both pectoralis major flap groups. The leakage rate was 8. 3 percent in the gastric transposition group, 25 percent in the tubed pectoralis major flap group, and 3. 7 percent in the pectoralis major flap patch group. Stricture was avoided with the interdigitation technique used at the tubed-flap-to-esophagus anastomosis, although the fistula rate was high. The overall complication rate was higher with gastric transposition. Although swallowing was satisfactory in all three groups, 42 percent of the {{patients with}} gastric transposition experienced regurgitation. Over a follow-up period of 16 to 50 months the local recurrence rate was 5 percent, and the actuarial survival rate was 55 percent at 24 months. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|Objectives. To {{evaluate}} the oncologic and functional results of larynx-preserving partial <b>pharyngectomy</b> (LPP) via lateral pharyngotomy approach {{as a primary}} treatment for small (T 1 or T 2) hypopharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma (HP-SCC). Methods. We performed a retrospective review of 23 patients who underwent LPP through lateral pharyngotomy approach for small HPSCC at the our department between January 1991 and June 2007. Fourteen (61 %) patients had adjuvant postoperative radiotherapy. Results. The 2 -years and 5 -years disease specific survival rate was 77 % and 61 %, respectively. Nine patients (39 %) had tumor recurrence. The most common pattern of recurrence was isolated distant failure (n= 4, 44 %) followed by local (n= 2, 22 %) and loco-regional (n= 3, 34 %) recurrence. The ultimate cure rate of the primary tumor was 87 % (20 of 23). Twenty-two of the 23 patients (95 %) could be decannulated, tolerate an oral diet, and had acceptable postoperative phonatory function. Conclusion.

40|$|Partial or total <b>pharyngectomy</b> {{is often}} {{required}} for the surgical treatment of advanced laryngeal and hypopharyngeal cancers. Reconstructive techniques for the <b>pharyngectomy</b> defect have evolved from the Wookey procedure, which was introduced in 19421 {{through the use of}} free tissue transfer with fasciocuta-neous and jejunal flaps. 2 - 12 The pectoralis major (PM) flap was a major advancement and remains an impor-tant tool for the repair of specific pharyngeal defects. 3, 4 With this technique, successful deglutition and essential wound closure can be achieved readily. Singer et al. 13 and Hamaker et al. 14 demonstrated that successful voice restoration with the tracheo-esophageal puncture technique could also be completed after neopharyngeal reconstruction with the PM myocutaneous flap. Others have confirmed the efficacy of this reconstructive method in small heterogeneous patient groups, 15, 16 but few studies have characterized the specific voice attainable after PM flap reconstruc-tion of the neopharynx. Using an extensive voice pro-tocol, we undertook this study to evaluate, in a quanti-tative and qualitative manner, tracheoesophageal voice after PM flap reconstruction and compared this with the voice of laryngectomy patients after standard pharyn-geal closure and voice restoration. METHODS AND MATERIAL Two patient groups were chosen for study. Group 1 (PM) consisted of patients who had undergone neopha-ryngeal reconstruction with a PM myocutaneous flap. Patients in group 1 were diagnosed with laryngeal/pha-ryngeal squamous cell cancer and underwent laryn-gopharyngectomy and subsequent reconstruction. Group 2 (standard) consisted of patients with similar cancer diagnoses who underwent total laryngectomy with standard pharyngeal closure.

The {{aim of the}} study is to examine the result of our experience and to formulate improved management guidelines. METHODS: Between 1980 and 2009, all patients who had circumferential <b>pharyngectomy</b> were recruited. Data were recorded prospectively for analysis. RESULTS: Two hundred and two patients were recruited. Majority had primary tumour in the hypopharynx (n = 165), and the remaining patients had recurrent laryngeal carcinoma. Radiotherapy was given pre-operatively in 72 patients and post-operatively in 108 patients. Pectoralis major (PM) flap was used in 92 (45. 5 %) patients, free anterolateral thigh (ALT) flap in 24 (11. 9 %) patients and free jejuna flap in 86 (42. 6 %) patients. Early fistula rate was 23. 9 % in the PM flap group, 12. 5 % in the ALT group and 4. 6 % in the jejunum group. Late anastomotic stricture rate was 27. 2 % in the PM flap group, 12. 5 % in free ALT group and 2. 3 % in the jejunum group. Early fistula formation significantly increased the risk of subsequent anastomotic stricture (p = 0. 023).

The sites of perforations were inherent points of weakness at {{the left side of the}} distal oesophagus and at the high lesser curve of stomach.

40|$|Background. The pharyngocutaneous fistula is {{troublesome}} complication after total laryngectomy. Despite a {{large number}} of studies, there is still disagreement on factors predisposing to this complication. Methods. A retrospective analysis of pharyngocutaneous tistulas in 133 patients in whom total laryngectomy was performed. Results. Fistulas were found in 15 % of the patients. Spontaneous closure was noted in 80 %. Simultaneous laryngectomy and partial <b>pharyngectomy</b> or neck dissection increased the risk of fistula formation. Preoperative irradiation, short interval between radiotherapy and operation, and cobalt/roentgen radiation instead of photons predispose to this complication. The fistulas appeared earlier, and the sizes of fistulas were significantly larger in patients with previous irradiation than those in patients with no preoperative irradiation. Conclusions. Postoperative pharyngocutaneous fistulas significantly increase patients' morbidity and hospital stay. Good surgical technique and postoperative treatment should be paid attention to patients with an increased risk of pharyngocutaneous fistula formation.

40|$|Objective: Although the {{majority}} of pharyngocutaneous fistulas close spontaneously with conservative measures, 20 % to 30 % of patients {{do not respond to}} this approach, thereby necessitating major reconstruction with adjacent or free tissue transfers. These procedures carry considerable risk, particularly in patients with medical comorbidities or a history of prior surgery/radiation. Less invasive treatment approaches designed to reverse tissue damage or promote spontaneous healing would represent an important medical advance. Autologous fat grafts have been previously shown to promote healing of persistent wounds and improve the quality of radiation-damaged tissue.

30|$|First, {{consideration}} {{should be}} given to the prevention of perioperative aspiration pneumonia. Takahashi et al. [11] reported that a patient with PSP after gastric surgery under general and epidural anesthesia had postoperative pneumonia. Progressive dysphasia and weakness of sputum excretion seen in patients with PSP would increase the risk of aspiration pneumonia. In this case, a history of partial <b>pharyngectomy</b> may worsen the symptoms of dysphasia in addition to those related to PSP. It has been reported that general anesthesia may increase the risk of postoperative pulmonary complications compared with regional anesthesia [13]. Arozullah et al. showed that the odds ratio of patients undergoing major non-cardiac surgery using general anesthesia was 1.56 (confidence interval, 1.36 to 1.80) compared with patients receiving local anesthesia [14]. Canet et al. [15] also reported that the risk for postoperative pulmonary complications with general anesthesia was 3.7 -times higher than that with regional anesthesia. Thus, regional anesthesia seems to be effective for preventing aspiration pneumonia. However, {{it should be noted that}} regional anesthesia is relatively safe but not absolutely safe. Accordingly, we did not use any sedative agents and opiates, and secretion was sucked to eliminate oral retention during the operation.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Compare {{the most}} {{commonly}} used types of tracheoesophageal voice prostheses, Blom Singer and Provox. STUDY DESIGN: Prospective study of 113 prostheses placed in 52 patients randomly selected to receive Blom-Singer and Provox. METHODS: Postoperative voice was recorded at 1 and 4 months after valve placement. Survival time of the prosthesis and four objective voice parameters were analyzed. Eight judges rated all recordings in a random order for six subjective voice parameters. Subgroup analysis for primary versus secondary placements and type of procedure was performed. In addition, patients were asked for their subjective assessment. RESULTS: Overall, Blom-Singer and Provox prostheses give very similar voice quality, lifetime, and patient satisfaction. Cleaning management is somewhat better for Provox, but there is a trend toward better overall voice quality for the Blom-Singer prosthesis. In subgroup analysis secondarily placed prostheses score somewhat better than primary placements, and patients with total laryngectomy have better voices than patients with extended laryngectomy combined with partial <b>pharyngectomy.</b> CONCLUSIONS: Given the equal and good results in terms of voice quality, other factors (e. g., costs, surgery-related factors, maintenance, patient preference) should be taken into account when deciding which type of tracheoesophageal voice prosthesis to use. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|Primary {{prosthetic}} voice restoration {{by performing}} tracheoesophageal puncture (TEP) and immediate insertion {{of a voice}} prosthesis {{at the time of}} total laryngectomy (TLE) is presently the method of choice. This enables the easiest and most comfortable voice rehabilitation with the patient still under general anesthesia when the first prosthesis is inserted. Reconstruction of the pharynx with e. g. free revascularized or pedicled flaps does not preclude surgical prosthetic voice restoration. The TEP can even be done as a primary procedure after total laryngectomy and total <b>pharyngectomy</b> when the full circumference of the neopharynx has to be reconstructed, provided the esophagus is still present {{at the level of the}} trachea. Since indwelling devices may have a more robust construction, their device-life generally is longer than that of their non-indwelling counterparts. Indwelling devices have the unique advantage in that patient's dexterity plays a lesser role in the daily maintenance of the device. With a few refinements in the surgery of TLE several postlaryngectomy problems can be avoided or diminished such as hypertonicity of the pharyngoesophageal (PE) segment and a poor contour of the stoma.

40|$|After total {{laryngectomy}} {{with or without}} partial <b>pharyngectomy,</b> the remaining pharyngeal defect can be repaired either by primary closure or with additional tissue, depending {{on the amount of}} pharyngeal tissue remnant available. The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the minimum width of the pharyngeal remnant that could be safely closed primarily without causing difficulty in swallowing. A total of 52 consecutive patients who underwent {{total laryngectomy}} were entered into the study. The relaxed and stretched widths of the pharyngeal remnant were measured after removal of the specimen. The widths of the pharyngeal mucosa ranged from 1. 5 to 5. 0 cm relaxed (mean, 3. 24 cm) and from 2. 5 to 8. 0 cm stretched (mean, 4. 83 cm). All neopharynx was reconstructed by closing the pharynx primarily. Seven of the 52 patients developed recurrent tumor with concomitant dysphagia. Two of the 45 patients without recurrence presented with acute dysphagia from food bolus obstruction, and 1 patient developed benign inflammatory stricture following an episode of fish-bone impaction. The narrowest widths of the pharyngeal remnant in this group of 45 were 1. 5 cm relaxed and 2. 5 cm stretched. As these patients do not have swallowing difficulty, we conclude that in the absence of tumor recurrence, this amount of residual pharyngeal tissue is sufficient both for primary closure of the pharynx and in restoring swallowing function. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E

40|$|To {{clarify the}} {{characteristics}} of hypopharyngeal cancer, data from both Kurume University and Kinki University were analyzed retrospectively. The results are as follows : (1) The number of cases has increased markedly; (2) Relatively early cases currently accounts for 60 ï¼…; (3) In T 3 /T 4 cases, bilateral neck dissections are absolutely necessary, whereas in T 1 /T 2 cases, neck dissection of the affected side should be performed; (4) Dissection of the retropharyngeal and paratracheal lymph nodes is essential in T 3 /T 4 cases; (5) The current most important and serious problem is how distant metastasis can be controlled; (6) Intensive medical treatment is necessary in adult diseases including cancer at other site. Based on these data and in consideration of {{quality of life of}} patients, the author has performed particular treatment strategies for more than fifteen years. For T 3 /T 4 cases, laryngectomy and partial <b>pharyngectomy</b> are performed, followed by primary suture of the remaining hypopharyngeal membrane. The disease-specific three-year survival rate is 60 ï¼…. For T 1 /T 2 cases, a treatment modality employing curative irradiation is performed after debulking the primary tumorwith a CO_ 2, laser.

40|$|Abstract It {{has been}} a common {{practice}} among the oncologist to reduce the dosage of adjuvant radiotherapy for patients after free jejunal Xap reconstruction. The current aims to study potential risk of radiation to the visceral Xap and the subsequent oncological outcome. Between 1996 and 2010, consecutive patients with carcinoma of the hypopharynx requiring laryngectomy, circumferential <b>pharyngectomy</b> and post-operative irradiation were recruited. Ninety-six patients were recruited. TNM tumor staging at presentation was: stage II (40. 6 %), stage III (34. 4 %) and stage IV (25. 0 %). Median follow-up period after surgery was 68 months. After tumor ablation, reconstruction was performed using free jejunal Xap (60. 4 %), pectoralis major myocu-taneous (PM) Xap (31. 3 %) and free anterolateral thigh (ALT) Xap (8. 3 %). All patients underwent adjuvant radiotherapy within 6. 4 weeks after surgery. The mean total dose of radiation given to those receiving cutaneous and jejunal Xap reconstruction was 62. 2 Gy and 54. 8 Gy, respectively. There was no secondary ischaemia or necrosis of the Xaps after radiotherapy. The 5 -year actu-arial loco-regional tumor control for the cutaneous Xap and jejunal Xap group was: stage II (61 vs. 69 %, p = 0. 9), stage III (36 vs. 46 %, p = 0. 2) and stage IV (32 vs. 14 %, p = 0. 04), respectively. Reduction of radiation dosage in free jejunal group adversely aVects the oncological con-trol in stage IV hypopharyngeal carcinoma. In such cir-cumstances, tubed cutaneous Xaps are the preferred reconstructive option, so that full-dose radiotherapy can be given...|$|E
40|$|Squamous cell {{carcinoma}} of the hypopharynx represents a distinct clinical entity. Most patients present with significant comorbidities and advanced-stage disease. The overall survival is relatively poor because of high rates of regional and distant metastasis at presentation or early {{in the course of}} the disease. A multidisciplinary approach is crucial in the overall management of these patients to achieve the best results and maintain or improve functional results. Traditionally, operable hypopharyngeal cancer has been treated by total (occasionally partial) laryngectomy and partial or circumferential <b>pharyngectomy,</b> followed by reconstruction and postoperative radiotherapy in most cases. Efforts to preserve speech and swallowing function in the surgical treatment of hypopharyngeal (and laryngeal) cancer have resulted in a declining use of total laryngopharyngectomy and improved reconstructive efforts, including microvascular free tissue transfer. There are many surgical, as well as nonsurgical, options available for organ and function preservation, which report equally effective tumor control and survival. The selection of appropriate treatment is of crucial importance in the achievement of optimal results for these patients. In this article, several aspects of surgical and nonsurgical approaches in the treatment of hypopharyngeal cancer are discussed. Future studies must be carefully designed within clearly defined populations and use uniform terminology and standardized functional assessment and declare appropriate patient or disease endpoints. These studies should focus on improvement of results, without increasing patient morbidity. In this respect, technical improvements in radiotherapy such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, advances in supportive care, and incorporation of newer systemic agents such as targeted therapy, are relevant developments...|$|E
40|$|The {{increasing}} use {{of primary}} chemoradiation (CRT) for laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) means that historical surgical data sets are not representative of the modern laryngectomy patient. We analyse a contemporary total laryngectomy (TL) cohort to identify factors predictive of outcome. This is a retrospective consecutive case note review in a UK tertiary referral centre. Demographic, staging, treatment and outcome data were collected. Oncological outcomes are expressed using the Kaplan-Meier method. The log-rank test was used for univariate analysis and cox regression for multivariate analysis. Sixty consecutive patients between 2003 and 2010 underwent primary TL, 28 including partial <b>pharyngectomy.</b> Median age was 61 Â years and mean follow-up was 24 Â months (1 - 78 Â months). Thirty six patients died during the study period, 24 of their disease. Of the disease-specific deaths, two occurred peri-operatively, four from local, two from regional and 18 from distant disease [two patients had simultaneous local and distant recurrence (DR) ]. Five-year overall survival, disease-specific survival, loco-regional recurrence-free survival and distant recurrence-free survival (DRFS) were 36, 51, 87, 62 Â %, respectively. Of 17 parameters analysed, pN-stage, extra-capsular spread, a non-cohesive tumour front, thyroid infiltration and involvement of level 6 were significant predictors of disease-specific survival (DSS) on univariate analysis. pNÂ >Â  1 {{and the presence of}} adverse histological features were found to be independent predictors of DSS and DRFS on multivariate analysis. Neither was significantly associated with loco-regional recurrence-free survival. Around half of patients who undergo TL for stage IV SCC will die of disease within 5 Â years, with most deaths attributable to DR. Surgery provides excellent loco-regional control but patients, especially those with advanced nodal disease and/or adverse histological features, should be thoroughly screened for occult distant disease.

40|$|Com o objetivo de analisar as complicaÃ§Ãµes do tubo gÃ¡strico isoperistÃ¡ltico na reconstruÃ§Ã£o de faringe os autores analisaram retrospectivamente 16 pacientes submetidos a faringolaringectomia total (FL) no perÃ­odo de julho de 1997 a dezembro de 2000. Todos os pacientes eram dos sexo masculino, idades entre os 38 - 74 anos (mÃ©dia 54), sendo nove eutrÃ³ficos e sete desnutridos. Onze pacientes apresentavam lesÃ£o primÃ¡ria no seio piriforme, dois na Ã¡rea retrocricÃ³ideia, um na epiglote e duas recidivas (base da lÃ­ngua e faringe). Todos eram estadio IV. Quatro pacientes apresentavam tratamento prÃ©vio, trÃªs com cirurgia e um com radioterapia. Em dez pacientes foram {{realizadas}} faringolaringectomia total + esofagectomia cervical com esvaziamento linfonodal bilateral, em trÃªs faringolaringectomia total + esofagectomia cervical + esvaziamento cervical unilateral; em um faringectomia total e esofagectomia cervical; glossectomia total com faringectomia total + esofagectomia cervical em um paciente e a rotaÃ§Ã£o do tubo gÃ¡strico em um paciente. O tempo cirÃºrgico variou de duas horas e trinta minutos a oito horas (mÃ©dia cinco horas). Somente um paciente nÃ£o apresentou complicaÃ§Ãµes. A complicaÃ§Ã£o cirÃºrgica mais freqÃ¼ente foi a fÃ­stula em doze pacientes (75 %), seguida da deiscÃªncia em cinco (31, 2 %). As complicaÃ§Ãµes clÃ­nicas ocorreram em 37, 5 % dos pacientes, sendo a mais freqÃ¼ente a broncopneumonia em quatro casos (25 %). O tempo de internaÃ§Ã£o variou de cinco a 20 dias com mÃ©dia de oito dias. Dois pacientes faleceram, um de sepsis abdominal e outro por acidente vascular cerebral. Os dados foram submetidos a anÃ¡lise estatÃ­stica. ConcluÃ­mos que o tempo cirÃºrgico Ã© um fator determinante de complicaÃ§Ãµes, existe uma tendÃªncia dos pacientes com idades acima de 74 anos de apresentar complicaÃ§Ãµes. As demais variÃ¡veis estudadas: idade, estado nutricional, confecÃ§Ã£o de retalhos, esplenectomias e tratamento prÃ©vio (radioterapia) nÃ£o implicam necessariamente em complicaÃ§Ãµes. Assim, nÃ£o constituem fatores limitantes para utilizaÃ§Ã£o do tubo gÃ¡strico isoperistÃ¡ltico com vistas Ã  reconstruÃ§Ã£o da faringe e esÃ´fago cervicalThe {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze complications when the isoperistaltic gastric tube is used in pharyngeal reconstruction. Therefore, the authors retrospectively analyzed 16 patients who had undergone total pharyngolaryngectomy during the period, July 1997 to December 2000. The study population consisted of male patients, whose ages ranged from 38 years to 74 years (mean 54 years). There were nine healthy patients and seven malnourished patients, who presented: primary lesions in the piriform sinus ? 11 patients, lesions in the retrocricoid area ? 02 patients, lesions in the epiglottis ? 01 patient and 2 recurrences (base of tongue and pharynx). All were stage IV lesions and four patients had previously undergone treatment - three surgical and one radiotherapeutic. Ten patients underwent total pharyngolaryngectomy and cervical esophagectomy with bilateral lymphonodal emptying; three patients - total pharyngolaryngectomy and cervical esophagectomy with unilateral cervical emptying; one patient underwent total <b>pharyngectomy</b> and cervical esophagectomy; one patient underwent total glossectomy with total <b>pharyngectomy</b> and cervical esophagectomy; gastric tube rotation was performed in one patient. The duration of the surgery varied between two and a half hours and eight hours (mean 05 hours). Only one patient did not present complications. The most common complication was a fistula in twelve patients (75 %), followed by dehiscence in five patients (31. 2 %). Clinical complications occurred in 37. 5 % of the patients, the most common was bronchopneumonia in 4 cases (25 %). The hospitalization period varied between 05 days and 20 days (mean 08 days). Two patients died, one with abdominal sepsis and the other due to cerebrovascular accident. The data were statistically analyzed. We concluded that the duration of surgery was a determining factor for complications and patients above the age of 74 demonstrated a tendency to present complications. The other variables in this study such as age, nutritional status, creation of flaps, splenectomies as well as previous radiotherapy do not necessarily imply complications and, therefore, are not limiting factors when the isoperistaltic gastric tube is used in pharyngeal and cervical esophageal reconstructio...|$|E
