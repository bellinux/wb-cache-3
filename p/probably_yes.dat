40|$|In 1962 Lewis Binford (American Antiquity, 28 [2]: 217 - 25) {{classified}} archaeological objects into technomic, sociotechnic, and ideotechnic categories. In {{the following}} decades the New Archaeologists, largely concerned with societies at the Domestic Mode of Production, emphasized the technomic objects. Prehistorians of state societies {{were much more}} frequently faced with socio- and ideotechnic objects, ritual and state symbols; {{the significance of these}} to all societies eventually crawled back into the thinking of prehistorians of band and tribal systems. Thence come landscapes into the archaeological discourse. As with manufactured objects, landscapes can be categorized into technomic, sociotechnic, and ideotechnic classes. And the authors of this volume engage landscapes from all three perspectives. The editors address the diverse perspectives of the chapters by pointing out the multitude of definitions of the word landscape and the commonality in these definitions revolving around the “emphasis on the negotiation between people and their physical surrounding” (5). “Negotiation” is an ambiguous word, and if all of the authors buy into this perspective I think they do so in very different ways. However, the editors’ point that the natural world is at once natural and cultural is important. In Binford’s words, “If there is one principle that anthropological field studies have affirmed over and over again, it is that the intellectual contexts of behavior in different cultures renders rationality a relative phenomenon” (Working at Archaeology 1983 : 220). The editors, though, overstep their bounds a bit when they state “Hunter-gatherers primarily conceptualize rather than construct their landscapes, that is, they imbue features on the land with meaning rather than physically alter the land itself” (8). If by this they mean that foragers do not cause global warming they are undoubtedly correct.

40|$|The {{ultimate}} {{object of}} interest is not the outcomes the model produces but how those outcomes affect society’s welfare. Advocates of free trade in the Americas may have been disappointed {{last year when the}} U. S. Congress denied the president fast-track authority to pursue trade agreements with other nations. The main concern of free trade advocates is that this decision will halt, and even reverse, the trend toward free trade initiated in the Americas in the 1980 s. This frustration would be particularly justified if countries in the region would benefit from mutual trade concessions but not from a unilateral move to free trade. Should countries pursue free trade policies even when their trading partners do not? Readers familiar with Ricardo’s celebrated comparative advantage theory of international trade would <b>probably</b> say <b>yes.</b> 1 However, contemporary models of international trade do not warrant such a clear-cut conclusion. This is the first of two articles that examine the reasons behind this ambiguity. This first article examines the welfare gains from unilateral trade liberalization suggested by static models of international trade. The second article will study the welfare gains from unilateral trade liberalization predicted by the more realistic (but also more complicated) dynamic models. 2 A survey of the literature reveals that models predicting that unilateral free trade will be harmful to societies rely on a common assumption whose empirical and theoretical foundations have not been convincingly substantiated. Thus, I conclude that, on balance, the arguments in favor of a unilateral move to free trade are stronger than those against it. Carlos E. J. M.
