500|$|Wendy Davis of Online Media Daily {{commented on}} the {{potential}} impact of the case, and observed it was a victory for proponents of Internet rights. Davis pointed out a judgment for Beck would have enabled additional WIPO cases from individuals who were the focus of satire on the web, as a way for those people to avoid judgment in U.S. courts which adhere to First Amendment case law. [...] John Cook of Gawker called Eiland-Hall's decision to turn the domain name over to Beck an optimal end to the affair which emphasized the ridiculousness of Beck's actions. Citizen Media Law <b>Project</b> <b>assistant</b> director Sam Bayard applauded WIPO's decision, noting, [...] "It's good to see that this WIPO arbitrator had no interest in allowing Beck to circumvent the guarantees of the U.S. Constitution." ...|$|E

In 1947 he became the treasurer of the Prehistoric Society, a position that he retained until 1970, during which he helped to secure the organisation's post-war reconstruction. In 1949 the archaeologist Christopher Hawkes invited Grinsell to join him and Stuart Piggott as a <b>project</b> <b>assistant</b> at Victoria County History in order to compile the Victoria County History of Wiltshire. Grinsell accepted, leaving his bank job and moving to the Wiltshire town of Devizes, thus becoming a professional archaeologist. Thomas later stated that the Victoria County History of Wiltshire [...] "represents the high point in [...] combined powers of fieldwork, grasp of secondary sources and handling of a great deal of detailed information." [...] Grinsell later published the book The Archaeology of Wessex, which was based on his experience during this period.|$|E

40|$|This {{case study}} {{discusses}} variation and formalization strategies for managing technology-use mediation of Web-based groupware technologies in an organizational context. Research and development projects of a multi-national pharmaceutical company entail a close collaboration between many geographically distributed actors. The {{use of a}} groupware technology in long term, cross-disciplinary and distributed development projects has been investigated {{in order to understand}} how Web-based technologies for collaboration become part of organizational work practices. In this paper, the work of <b>project</b> <b>assistants</b> in setting up and promoting the technology is described and analyzed as technology-use mediation. The ways in which the <b>project</b> <b>assistants</b> position themselves as system administrators by delegating access rights, providing content, and advocating use among development project members are identified as crucial to the integration of the groupware technology in work practices. Two configurations of the groupware technology and the cooperation within the development projects are compared under the metaphors of “the ultimate communication tool ” and “a set of private and safe workspaces ” respectively. The differences between them are brought forth to discuss the roles of the <b>project</b> <b>assistants</b> and the variety of ongoing meta-structuring activities. In conclusion, formalizing the technology-use mediations is discussed as beneficial if it renders the position of the <b>project</b> <b>assistants</b> more visible within the organization. This need not induce uniformity of configurations across the development projects, but might strengthen the mediating position of th...|$|R

50|$|To {{support its}} varied activities, NIO uses the {{services}} of limited-tenure staff, including doctoral students, <b>project</b> <b>assistants</b> and post-doctoral fellows. Their numbers have grown significantly with the growth in research programmes. The largest increase {{has been in the}} number of <b>project</b> <b>assistants</b> since CSIR introduced the “Project Assistant Scheme” to tap {{the services of}} fresh graduates for enhancing the productivity of its institutions. Hired regularly through walk-in interviews, the fresh graduates are permitted by this scheme to gain hands-on exposure to oceanographic research. The graduates also have the option of becoming doctoral students through the Senior Research Fellow scheme of the Human Resource Development Group (HRDG) of CSIR. A number of universities have recognized NIO as a centre for doctoral research and about 50 scientists from amongst its staff are at present recognized by these universities as doctoral research guides. With the establishment of the Academy for Scientific and Innovative Research (AcSIR), CSIR's institutions are poised to take major initiatives in advanced education in the country. NIO's Research Council has recommended that the institute take steps to start a school of oceanography as early as possible {{to address the problem of}} shortage of advanced manpower in ocean sciences in the country. The number of Junior Research Fellows, qualified through NET (i.e., the National Eligibility Test, conducted by CSIR), Senior Research Fellows (selected by HRDG, CSIR) and <b>Project</b> <b>Assistants</b> who are enrolled for Ph.D. in the Institute is now 80.
