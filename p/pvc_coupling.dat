40|$|My senior {{design project}} was to design, construct, and test an {{underwater}} glider. A glider operates by changing its buoyancy to descend and ascend, and then converts this vertical motion into horizontal motion {{by the addition of}} wings. The change in buoyancy in my glider was effected by using a linear actuator to move two pistons, which were open to the environment, in and out. By moving the pistons in and out, the volume of water displaced by the glider can be controlled. Because of Archimedes' principle, the change in volume of water that is displaced changes the buoyancy of the glider. The glider was built out of pieces of 6 inch inner diameter, schedule 40, white PVC pipe, along with two end caps and a <b>PVC</b> <b>coupling.</b> The wing of my glider was made from a piece of plywood. After construction, testing showed that the glider had the ability to both descend and ascend in a water tank {{in the basement of the}} engineering building. When the glider was taken to the pool however, it failed to return to the surface after sinking, though it displayed its ability to glide forward while it sank...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Factors {{associated}} with premature ventricular contraction-induced cardiomyopathy (PVCi-CMP) remain debated. OBJECTIVE: The {{purpose of this}} study was to test the correlation of various factors to the presence PVCi-CMP in a large multicenter population. METHODS: One hundred sixty-eight consecutive patients referred for ablation of frequent premature ventricular contractions (PVCs) were included. Patients were divided into 2 groups: group 1 with suspected PVCi-CMP (96 patients, ejection fraction 38 % ± 10 %, left ventricular end-diastolic diameter 62 ± 8 mm, with or without additional structural heart disease); and group 2 (control group, 72 patients with normal ejection fraction and left ventricular dimensions). Various clinical and electrophysiologic parameters were compared between groups. RESULTS: In univariate analysis, left ventricular origin of PVC, lack of palpitations, long <b>PVC</b> <b>coupling</b> interval, epicardial origin of the focus, long sinus beat QRS duration, male gender, high PVC burden, presence of polymorphic PVCs, high PVC QRS duration, and older age were significantly related to the presence of PVCi-CMP. In multivariate analysis, only lack of palpitations, PVC burden, and epicardial origin remained significantly and independently correlated with the presence of cardiomyopathy. Even if sinus QRS duration or PVC left ventricular origin were also found independently linked to PVCi-CMP in the whole population, they were no longer correlated when patients with additional heart disease were excluded. CONCLUSION: Lack of palpitations, PVC burden, and epicardial origin are independent factors that identify patients prone to developing PVCi-CMP...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} {{determine}} the role of the coupling interval of a premature ventricular contraction (PVC) in the development of paroxysmal ventricular tachycardia (PVT) during the early phase of acute myocardial in-farction in man, 52 male patients with documented acute myocardial infarction had 24 -hour Holter monitoring commenced within 24 hours of the onset of prolonged chest pain. Review of the tape recordings revealed that 27 patients had PVT documented, while 25 patients did not. Analysis of the data on the two groups showed that the frequency of <b>PVCs,</b> <b>coupled</b> <b>PVCs,</b> and accelerated idioventricular rhythm (AIVR) were found to be associated with a significantly increased incidence of ventricular tachycardia. The mean coupling interval of the PVCs initiating episodes of ventricular tachycardia was not significantly different from either the mean coupling interval of the isolated PVCs in the patients with PVT or the mean coupling interval of the PVCs in the patients without PVT. This suggests that the coupling in-terval of a ventricular ectopic is a poor predictor of ventricular tachycardia in the early phases of acute myocardial infarction...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the branchial mechanisms utilized by freshwater fish to regulate internal acid-base status and presents {{a model to}} explain the underlying basis of the compensatory processes. Rainbow trout, Oncorhynchus mykiss, brown bullhead, Ictalurus nebulosus, and American eels, Anguilla rostrata, were examined {{under a variety of}} experimental treatments which induced both respiratory (hyperoxia, hypercapnia) and metabolic (post-hyperoxia, post-hypercapnia, HCl infusion, NaHCO 3 infusion) acid-base disturbances. Acid-base-regulation was achieved by appropriate adjustments of Na+ and Cl- net fluxes across the gills which, in turn, were accomplished by variable contributions of three different branchial mechanisms; (i) morphological adjustments to the gill epithelium, (ii) changes in internal (H+, HCO 3 -) and external (Na+, HCO 3 -) substrate availability, and (iii) differential changes in Na+ versus Cl- net fluxes through regulation of Cl- efflux. This thesis determined the variable contribution of each of these mechanisms to overall compensation of acid-base disturbances. In brown bullhead and trout, respiratory acidosis caused a reduction in chloride cell (CC) surface area whereas alkalosis was associated with increases in CC surface area. Increases in the density of microvilli displayed on the external surface of the <b>PVC</b> <b>coupled</b> with ultrastructural modifications during hypercapnic acidosis were associated with increases in Na+ uptake (JinNa+). In addition to the effect that alterations in CC surface area have on the rate of Cl-/HCO 3 - exchange (JinCl-), it was demonstrated that changes in the concentration of the internal counter-ion (HCO 3 -) may alter the rates of acid-base compensation. When (HCO 3 -) is elevated, JmaxCl- is elevated thereby increasing the capacity to excrete HCO 3 - via the Cl-/HCO 3 - exchanger over and above those determined by CC morphology. This is an important mechanism to increase the rate of acid-base compensation during metabolic alkalosis. (Abstract shortened by UMI. ...|$|R

40|$|Infestations of {{the marine}} macrophytic alga Caulerpa taxifolia were {{discovered}} in Agua Hedionda Lagoon, California in 2000. Rapid response actions included containment under <b>pvc</b> tarps <b>coupled</b> with injection of liquid sodium hypochlorite. To assess the efficacy of these treatments, replicated sediment cores were removed from representative treated sites and transferred to grow-out facilities. Similar cores from uninfested (control) sediments were removed, inoculated with viable explants of C. taxifolia and placed in grow-out facilities. Results from two sampling periods (1 year, 2 years post-treatment) showed that no viable C. taxifolia emerged in cores, and that inoculated “control” sediments supported normal growth. Eelgrass (Zostera marina L.) seedlings emerged from native seed-banks in “treated” cores, which also supported growth of some invertebrates (annelid worms and hydroids).

40|$|Premature {{ventricular}} contractions (PVCs) and non-sustained {{ventricular tachycardia}} (NSVT) are frequently encountered and a marker of electrocardiomyopathy. In some instances, they increase the risk for sustained ventricular tachycardia, ventricular fibrillation, and sudden cardiac death. While often associated with a primary cardiomyopathy, they have also been known to cause tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy in patients without preceding structural heart disease. Medical therapy including beta-blockers and class III anti-arrhythmic agents can be effective while implantable cardiac defibrillators (ICD) are indicated in certain patients. Radiofrequency ablation (RFA) is the preferred, definitive treatment in those patients that improve with anti-arrhythmic therapy, have tachycardia-induced cardiomyopathy, or have certain subtypes of PVCs/NSVT.

40|$|BackgroundVentricular {{fibrillation}} may {{be caused}} by premature ventricular contractions (<b>PVCs)</b> whose <b>coupling</b> intervals are < 300 ms, a characteristic of the short-coupled variant of torsades de pointes (scTdP). ObjectiveThe {{purpose of this study was}} to analyze the underlying cardiac ryanodine receptor (RyR 2) variants in patients with scTdP. MethodsSeven patients with scTdP (mean age 34 ± 12 years; 4 men and 3 women) were enrolled in this study. The RyR 2 gene was screened by targeted gene sequencing methods; variant minor allele frequency was confirmed in 3 databases; and the pathogenicity was investigated in silico analysis using multiple tools. The activity of wild-type and mutant RyR 2 channels was evaluated by monitoring Ca 2 + signals of HEK 293 cells with a [3 H]ryanodine binding assay. ResultsThe mean <b>coupling</b> interval of <b>PVCs</b> was 282 ± 13 ms. The 12 -lead electrocardiogram had no specific findings except PVCs with an extremely short-coupling interval. Genetic analysis revealed 3 novel RyR 2 variants and 1 polymorphism, all located in the cytoplasmic region. p. Ser 4938 Phe was not detected in 3 databases, and in silico analysis indicated its pathogenicity. In functional analysis, p. Ser 4938 Phe demonstrated loss of function and impaired RyR 2 channel Ca 2 + release, while 2 other variants, p. Val 1024 Ile and p. Ala 2673 Val, had mild gain-of-function effects but were similar to the polymorphism p. Asn 1551 Ser.

BACKGROUNDThe electrophysiologic mechanisms of VF in Brugada syndrome have not been fully investigated. METHODSNineteen patients (all male, mean age 47 ± 12 years) with Brugada syndrome were treated with an implantable cardioverter defibrillator (ICD). The implanted devices were capable of storing electrograms during an arrhythmic event. We investigated the mode of spontaneous onset of VF according to the electrocardiographic features during the episode of VF, which were obtained from stored electrograms of ICDs and/or electrocardiographic (ECG) monitoring. RESULTSDuring a follow-up of 34. 7 ± 19. 4 months (range 14 to 81 months), 46 episodes of spontaneous VF attacks were documented in 7 / 19 (37 %) patients. The event-free period between ICD implantation and the first spontaneous occurrence of VF was 14. 6 ± 12. 1 months (range 3. 7 to 27. 4 months). We investigated 33 / 46 episodes of VF, for which electrocardiographic features (10 to 20 s before and during VF) were obtained from ICDs and/or ECG monitoring in five patients. A total of 22 / 33 episodes of VF were preceded by premature ventricular contractions (PVCs), which were almost identical to the initiating PVCs of VF. Furthermore, in three patients who had multiple VF episodes, VF attacks were always initiated by the same respective <b>PVC.</b> The <b>coupling</b> interval of the initiating PVCs of VF was 388 ± 28 ms. CONCLUSIONSSpontaneous episodes of VF in patients with Brugada syndrome were triggered by specific PVCs. These findings may provide important insights into the pathophysiological mechanisms causing VF in Brugada syndrome...|$|R
40|$|Since in {{patients}} with ventricular tachycardia (VT) and compromised left ventricular function, antiarrhythmic therapy poses a particular problem, an open-label safety study of d-sotalol, a new class III antiarrhythmic agent, was performed. Thirteen patients with defined VT and a low left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) were treated with orally administered d-sotalol, 100 mg bid, {{and in a few}} patients 100 mg tid, in an open study. Patients were followed up for 35 +/- 11 months, with the longest follow-up amounting to 51 months. The data obtained suggest that d-sotalol was moderately effective as an antiarrhythmic agent, in particular with respect to premature ventricular contractions (<b>PVCs)</b> and <b>coupled</b> and repetitive <b>PVCs.</b> The beneficial effect appeared to persist on long-term treatment. d-Sotalol was well tolerated and no subjective or objective adverse reactions were observed. There were no signs of worsening of congestive heart failure, proarrhythmogenic activity, or torsades de pointes, although QT-prolongation was observed. There were no dropouts in the study. Two patients died: One patient with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (with LVEF = 11 %) died suddenly after 38 months of follow-up and one patient after 17 months from recurrent myocardial infarction. Neither of these had shown recurrence of VT on 24 hour ambulatory ECG recordings. In conclusion, in this small group of patients d-sotalol appeared to be safe and well tolerated during long-term treatment of patients with VT and poor left ventricular function. There were clear suggestions of antiarrhythmic activity, reflected by the suppression of complex ventricular arrhythmias and by the absence of recurrent VT on long-term follow-up in the majority of patients.

40|$|In {{this paper}} {{we present a}} new {{formalism}} to implement the nuclear particle-vibration <b>coupling</b> (<b>PVC)</b> model. The key issue is the proper treatment of the continuum, that is allowed by the coordinate space representation. Our formalism, based {{on the use of}} zero-range interactions like the Skyrme forces, is microscopic and fully self-consistent. We apply it to the case of neutron single-particle states in $^{ 40 }$Ca, $^{ 208 }$Pb and $^{ 24 }$O. The first two cases are meant to illustrate the comparison with the usual (i. e., discrete) PVC model. However, we stress that the present approach allows to calculate properly the effect of PVC on resonant states. We compare our results with those from experiments in which the particle transfer in the continuum region has been attempted. The latter case, namely $^{ 24 }$O, is chosen {{as an example of a}} weakly-bound system. Such a nucleus, being double-magic and not displaying collective low-lying vibrational excitations, is characterized by quite pure neutron single-particle states around the Fermi surface.

40|$|Assessment of {{fluctuations}} in heart rate (HR) following a premature ventricular complex (PVC) is valuable for identifying patients {{at high risk}} of sudden cardiac death. We hypothesised that postextrasystolic potentiation is the main determinant of the regulation patterns of blood pressure (BP) and HR following a PVC. Twelve patients with idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) and 13 control subjects with single <b>PVCs</b> (comparable <b>coupling</b> intervals) were investigated. Non-invasive finger arterial BP and ECGs were analysed. Regulation patterns following a single PVC were quantified using the indices postextrasystolic amplitude potentiation (PEAP) and maximum turbulence slope of five consecutive mean BP values (MBP-TS), and compared with the HR turbulence parameters turbulence slope (HR-TS) and turbulence onset (HR-TO). PEAP was significantly higher in IDC patients compared to controls (48. 7 ± 32. 6 vs. 9. 8 ± 5. 4 %, P < 0. 01), whereas MBP-TS was lower (0. 97 ± 0. 60 vs. 2. 07 ± 1. 04 mmHg BBI− 1 (BBI, beat-to-beat interval), P < 0. 05), as was HR-TS (8. 46 ± 7. 90 vs. 30. 73 ± 22. 90 ms BBI− 1, P < 0. 01). HR-TO was significantly higher in IDC patients (− 0. 56 ± 2. 19 vs. − 5. 52 ± 4. 13 %, P < 0. 01). In addition, the regulation patterns of BP and HR following a single PVC differed significantly between IDC patients and controls. Specifically, we observed pronounced PEAPs in IDC patients. The baroreflex response initiated by the low pressure amplitude of the PVC was suppressed in IDC patients due to the augmented potentiation of the first postextrasystolic blood pressure. Furthermore, IDC patients displayed impressive postextrasystolic pulsus alternans phenomena, whereas healthy subjects exhibited a typical baroreflex pattern. The pulsus alternans phenomenon seems to be triggered by a PVC...|$|R
40|$|A {{complete}} {{characterization of}} the structure of nuclei can be obtained by combining information arising from inelastic scattering, Coulomb excitation, and γ -decay, together with one- and two-particle transfer reactions. In this way it is possible to probe both the single-particle and collective components of the nuclear many-body wave function resulting from the coupling of these modes and, as a result, diagonalizing the low-energy Hamiltonian. We address the question of how accurately such a description can account for experimental observations in the case of superfluid nuclei. Our treatment goes beyond the traditional approach, in which these properties are calculated separately, and most often for systems near closed shells, based on perturbative approximations (weak coupling). It is concluded that renormalizing empirically and on equal footing bare single-particle and collective motion of open-shell nuclei in terms of self-energy (mass) and vertex corrections (screening), as well as particle-hole and pairing interactions through particle-vibration <b>coupling</b> (<b>PVC),</b> leads to a detailed, quantitative account of the data, constraining the possible values of the k mass, of the 1 S 0 bare NN interaction, and of the PVC strengths within a rather narrow window...|$|R

As a safety precaution, visual feedback was implemented to confirm the user’s inputs were received by the exoskeleton and that the robot is actuating.

40|$|Covariant density {{functional}} theory, {{which has}} so far been applied only within the framework of static and time dependent mean field theory is extended to include Particle-Vibration <b>Coupling</b> (<b>PVC)</b> in a consistent way. Starting from a conventional energy functional we calculate the low-lying collective vibrations in Relativistic Random Phase Approximation (RRPA) and construct an energy dependent self-energy for the Dyson equation. The resulting Bethe-Salpeter equation in the particle-hole (ph) channel is solved in the Time Blocking Approximation (TBA). No additional parameters are used and double counting is avoided by a proper subtraction method. The same energy functional, i. e. the same set of coupling constants, generates the Dirac-Hartree single-particle spectrum, the static part of the residual ph-interaction and the particle-phonon coupling vertices. Therefore a fully consistent description of nuclear excited states is developed. This method is applied for an investigation of damping phenomena in the spherical nuclei with closed shells ^ 208 Pb and ^ 132 Sn. Since the phonon coupling terms enrich the RRPA spectrum with a multitude of ph⊗phonon components a noticeable fragmentation of the giant resonances is found, which is in full agreement with experimental data and with results of the semi-phenomenological non-relativistic approach.
