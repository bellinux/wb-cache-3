A significant difference in the antioxidant properties between the fresh apricot pulp and its <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> was observed. The difference in antioxidant properties between the fresh and the <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> may be attributed to the partial degradation of the bioactive compounds by the action of heat during processing.

40|$|A {{chemical}} fingerprint {{method was}} developed for reorganizing and validating different <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> of Angelica using HPLC. About 11 common peaks of this HPLC fingerprints were found by assigning Ferulic acid peak as the reference peak. The correlation coefficient of entire chromatographic patterns among samples were calculated and the simulative mean chromatogram was calculated and generated using the Computer Aided Similarity Evaluation System, the observation indicated that the characteristic peaks of this HPLC fingerprints existed significant difference between different <b>processed</b> <b>products.</b> Data were evaluated statistically using Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Hierarchical Cluster Analysis (HCA) and Discriminant Analysis (DA) in order to classify the samples and to identify key categorizing parameters. The statistical {{results showed that the}} projected plots of each <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> were localized in confined cluster in the 3 D-projection plots of Principal Component Analysis (PCA) and that 55 representative samples were separated into 5 groups using HCA at a rescaled distance of 5 and the same <b>processed</b> <b>product</b> samples were clustered in the same cluster. Furthermore, Fish’s discriminant functions were generated using 6 selected predictor variables, the tested samples of different <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> were classified with 100 % accuracy and DA plots for the 5 groups were well-resolved. To the knowledge, this is the first demonstration of the feasibility and advantages of employing chromatographic fingerprinting combined with PCA, HCA and DA for the accurate identification and validation of different <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> of Angelica.

Domestic Support and Border Measures for <b>Processed</b> Horticultural <b>Products</b> In horticultural markets, trade barriers often apply to the <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> whereas domestic support applies to farm-produced raw commodities. Here we assess the effects of such trade barriers and domestic support by simulating the effects of policy reform on global processing tomato markets, which are faced with modest <b>processed</b> <b>product</b> tariffs and high domestic support in the European Union (EU). Both protection and EU subsidy drive down world welfare, but we find that reducing import tariffs for tomato products would yield greater effects on markets and larger welfare impacts outside Europe than would reductions in EU domestic support. Key words: agricultural trade policy, equilibrium displacement model, EU subsidies, horticulture, processing tomatoes, tariffs, welfare analysis, WTO negotiations.

40|$|Romania's {{international}} agrifood trade {{increased significantly}} {{during the last}} decade, and mostly after the EU accession. Since 1990, the Romanian agrifood trade balance showed an almost continuous increasing deficit trend until 2008. In four years only, the trend reversed and in 2013, {{for the first time}} in the last two and a half decades, the agrifood trade balance turned positive. The present paper is analyzing the evolution of the trade evolution and its structure, separating the agrifood products in three categories: agricultural commodities, primarily <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> and secondary <b>processed</b> <b>products.</b> A higher ratio of <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> in exports is indicating an increased competitiveness, resulting from higher unit values incorporating more added value, and showing, at the same time, a higher development degree of the country's food industry. The results for total trade show that the <b>processed</b> <b>products</b> represented at most 46 % of the Romanian exports, and at least 63 % of imports, indicating a low-competitive structure of the agrifood trade. The analysis is detailed for intra and extra-EU trade and by main partners and groups of products...|$|R

50|$|The {{commercial}} {{imperative for}} business process preservation comes from several pressures. Heavily regulated industries, such as pharmaceuticals and aircraft manufacture must fully document processes {{so that they}} can be audited, reproduced, or diagnosed. Long-lived companies must manage services across multiple changes in technical environments. Organisations that use escrow services to mitigate risk must be confident that all of the needed information is demonstrably included in the escrow agreement and services. Organisations undergoing major staff changes must ensure that they retain the knowledge needed to operate or re-instate production processes. In addition to publications and data, academics need the software and process information to assess the validity of the data and the derived scientific claims. The same provenance information that can provide a key in regulated industries can also support credit assignment in academia. All industries benefit from analysis of processes that may lead to their continuous improvement.
