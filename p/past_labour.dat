60|$|He reached Lamb House {{again in}} August, 1905, and {{immediately}} {{set to work}} on his American book. It grew at such a rate that he presently found he had filled a large volume without nearly exhausting his material; but by that time the whole experience seemed remote and faint, and he felt it impossible to go further with it. The wreckage of San Francisco, moreover, by the great earthquake and fire of 1906, drove his own Californian recollections still further from his mind. He left The American Scene a fragment, therefore, and turned to another occupation which engaged him very closely for the next two years. This was the preparation of the revised and collected edition of his works, or at least of so much of his fiction as he could find room for in a limited number of volumes. To read his own books was an entirely new amusement to him; they had always been rigidly thrust out of sight from the moment they were finished and done with; and he came back now to his early novels with a perfectly detached critical curiosity. He took each of them in hand and plunged into the enormous toil, not indeed of modifying its substance in any way--where he was dissatisfied with the substance he rejected it altogether--but of bringing its surface, every syllable of its diction, to the level of his exigent taste. At the same time, in the prefaces to the various volumes, he wrote what became in the end a complete exposition of his theory of the art of fiction, intertwined with the memories of <b>past</b> <b>labour</b> that he found everywhere in the much-forgotten pages. It all represented a great expenditure of time and trouble, besides the postponement of new work; and {{there is no doubt that}} he was deeply disappointed by the half-hearted welcome that the edition met with after all, schooled as he was in such discouragements.|$|E

5000|$|In Sraffian theory, {{the value}} of a {{commodity}} [...] "contains" [...] both the average labour directly involved in making it ("direct labour") and <b>past</b> <b>labour</b> contained in the materials from which it is made ("indirect labour" [...] or [...] "dated labour"). After some pioneering work by various scholars in the 1960s, Luigi Pasinetti provided a methodological foundation for measuring the labour content of commodities, in this sense, which was developed further by Anwar Shaikh, Eduardo Ochoa, and Lefteris Tsoulfidis. In Marx's developed theory, however, {{the value of}} the commodity represents the average labour currently required to make it, given {{the current state of the}} whole production complex - it is the current social valuation (the replacement cost) of that commodity. This is a synchronic valuation, not a diachronic one. This was not so clearly realized during the 20th century, because economists could not grasp how, in the course of Marx's dialectical story, the meaning of the operative concept of value itself could undergo some important changes. Because Marx's developed concept of value differs from the simplified concept of value, economists thought that Marx's theory was formally inconsistent.|$|E
5000|$|The Marxist labor {{theory of}} value has been criticised on several counts. Some {{argue that it}} predicts that profits will be higher in labor-intensive {{industries}} than in capital-intensive industries, which would be contradicted by empirical data, even if Marx has never 'mechanically' simplified the matter in these terms, as capital itself is product of <b>past</b> <b>labour,</b> thus, the 'general tendency of falling profit' does not concern or invalidate the labour origin of value, present in both live and dead labour (capital)(cf chapter 1 and 24 of Das Kapital). This is {{sometimes referred to as}} the [...] "Great Contradiction". In volume 3 of Capital, Marx explains why profits are not distributed according to which industries are the most labor-intensive and why this is consistent with his theory. Whether or not {{this is consistent with the}} labor theory of value as presented in volume 1 has been a topic of debate. According to Marx, surplus value is extracted by the capitalist class as a whole and then distributed according to the amount of total capital, not the just variable component. In the example given earlier, of making a cup of coffee, the constant capital involved in production is the coffee beans themselves, and the variable capital is the value added by the coffee maker. The value added by the coffee maker is dependent on its technological capabilities, and the coffee maker can only add so much total value to cups of coffee over its lifespan. The amount of value added to the product is thus the amortization of the value of the coffeemaker. We can also note that not all products have equal proportions of value added by amortized capital. Capital intensive industries such as finance may have a large contribution of capital, while labor-intensive industries like traditional agriculture would have a relatively small one.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyses}} {{the dynamics}} of wives ’ labour force participation in Spain during the late 1980 s from a non-parametric descriptive perspective. This research is motivated by two basic facts: One, {{there is evidence that}} female labour supply behaviour in Spain is changing since the late 1980 s. Two, while the analysis of participation stocks is covered in the literature, there is no published research on mobility or flows. In {{the first part of this}} paper there is a description of the three-monts ’ transition rates over twowaves. The underlying assumption is the First Order Markov Hypothesis. In the second part, the Markov assumption is questioned. This is done by carrying out an analysis of survival over 7 waves in which re-entries are ignored. Moreover, there is also an analysis of mobility contingent on <b>past</b> <b>labour</b> market state, which includes re-entries in the analysis. This allows me to study the likelihood of relapsing in a particular state, or the likelihood of surviving contingent on <b>past</b> <b>labour</b> market states.

Sir Neil accordingly started to obtain the necessary vessels, and the king and his company followed slowly. To reach the Firth of Clyde it was necessary to cross Loch Lomond. This was a difficult undertaking; but after great search Sir James Douglas discovered a small boat sunk {{beneath the surface of the}} lake. On being pulled out it was found to be old and leaky, and would hold at best but three. With strips torn from their garments they stopped the leaks as best they could, and then started across the lake. There were two hundred to cross, and the passage occupied a night and a day; those who could not swim being taken over in the boat, while the swimmers kept alongside and when fatigued rested their hands on her gunwales. They were now in the Lennox country, and while Bruce and his friends were hunting, they were delighted to come across the Earl of Lennox and some of his companions, who had found refuge there after the battle of Methven. Although himself an exile and a fugitive the earl was in his own country, and was therefore able to entertain the king and his companions hospitably, and the rest and feeling of security were welcome indeed after the <b>past</b> <b>labours</b> and dangers.|$|R
