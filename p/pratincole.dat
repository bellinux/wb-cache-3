5|$|The reserve's {{location}} {{means that}} migrants may be found, sometimes in huge numbers {{when the weather}} conditions are right. These may include vagrant rarities, including a western sandpiper in 2012, a displaying great snipe in 2011, a trumpeter finch in 2010 and a collared <b>pratincole</b> in 2009. In order to maintain a good habitat, parts of the reed bed are cut and sold for thatch each year to establish a mosaic of plants of different ages.|$|E

50|$|The {{most unusual}} {{feature of the}} <b>pratincoles</b> is that {{although}} classed as waders they typically hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground.|$|R
50|$|The {{feature that}} defines the family {{from the rest of}} the order is the bill, which is arched and has the {{nostrils}} at the base. The <b>pratincoles</b> have short legs, long pointed wings and long forked tails. They have a buoyant flight that allows them the unusual (for the order) hunting technique of taking their insect prey on the wing like swallows. The wings also allow for long migrations in some species.The coursers have long legs, which are used to run (giving the group its name. The wings are shorter and have a more sustained flight than that of the <b>pratincoles.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>pratincoles</b> or greywaders are a {{group of}} birds which {{together}} with the coursers and Egyptian plover make up the family Glareolidae. They have short legs, very long pointed wings and long forked tails.|$|R
50|$|Very good {{views are}} needed to {{distinguish}} this species from other pratincoles, such as the collared <b>pratincole</b> and the oriental <b>pratincole</b> which may occur in its range.

5000|$|The {{collared}} <b>pratincole</b> or common <b>pratincole</b> (Glareola pratincola) is a wader in the <b>pratincole</b> family, Glareolidae. The genus name is {{a diminutive}} of Latin glarea, [...] "gravel", referring to a typical nesting habitat for pratincoles. The species name pratincola means an inhabitant of meadows, from Latin pratum, prati, [...] "meadow" [...] and incola, [...] "inhabitant", from incolere, [...] "to inhabit".|$|E
50|$|The Australian <b>pratincole</b> {{belongs to}} the Glareolidae family. The Australian <b>Pratincole</b> has a high taxonomic {{uniqueness}} {{as it is the}} only species belonging to the genus Stiltia within the Glareolidae family.|$|E
5|$|Glareolidae is {{a family}} of wading birds {{comprising}} the <b>pratincoles,</b> which have short legs, long pointed wings and long forked tails, and the coursers, which have long legs, short wings and long, pointed bills which curve downwards.|$|R
5000|$|Glareolidae [...] is {{a family}} of birds in the wader {{suborder}} Charadri. It contains two distinct groups, the <b>pratincoles</b> and the coursers. The atypical Egyptian plover (Pluvianus aegyptius), traditionally placed in this family, is now known to be only distantly related.|$|R
50|$|The coursers are crepuscular and nocturnal {{in their}} habits, and are {{generally}} inconspicuous, particularly the woodland species. They {{are not as}} social as the highly gregarious and noisy <b>pratincoles,</b> some species of which may also active at dawn and dusk.|$|R
50|$|Very good {{views are}} needed to {{distinguish}} this species from other pratincoles, such as the black-winged <b>pratincole</b> and the oriental <b>pratincole,</b> which may occur in its range. The latter species also has a chestnut underwing, but is shorter-tailed.|$|E
5000|$|The black-winged <b>pratincole</b> (Glareola nordmanni) is a wader in the <b>pratincole</b> bird family, Glareolidae.

50|$|The coursers are a {{group of}} birds which {{together}} with the <b>pratincoles</b> make up the family Glareolidae. They have long legs, short wings and long pointed bills which curve downwards. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders is that they inhabit deserts and similar arid regions.|$|R
5|$|<b>Pratincoles</b> have short legs, {{very long}} pointed wings and long forked tails. Their most unusual feature for birds classed as waders {{is that they}} {{typically}} hunt their insect prey on the wing like swallows, although they can also feed on the ground.

50|$|On 7 February 2004, 2.5 million oriental <b>pratincoles</b> were {{recorded}} on Eighty Mile Beach in Australia's north-west by the Australasian Wader Studies Group. There {{had previously been}} no record of this magnitude and it is supposed that weather conditions caused much of the world's population of this species to congregate in one area.|$|R

50|$|Some {{species of}} <b>pratincole</b> are long-distance migrants. Shorter migrations include {{those of the}} Madagascan <b>pratincole,</b> which migrates from its {{breeding}} grounds in Madagascar to East Africa; in contrast the black-winged <b>pratincole</b> migrates from the steppes of Eastern Europe and Central Asia to West and Southern Africa. The migration, which can measure 10,000 km in distance, is often undertaken as a single non-stop flight and is flown at high altitude. The coursers are not particularly migratory, although the cream-coloured courser does migrate from the northern extremes of its range in the winter. The coursers are fairly nomadic, but do not undertake long distance migrations.|$|E
50|$|There {{are four}} species which breed in Africa and South Asia.They have long legs, short wings and long pointed bills which curve downwards.

It also supports Australian bustards and grey grasswrens. Large numbers of Australian <b>pratincoles,</b> black-tailed godwits and flock bronzewings have been recorded.|$|R
