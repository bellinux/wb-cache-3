5|$|In 1977-78, the West Australian Government, {{under the}} {{leadership}} of Charles Court, announced plans for a nuclear <b>power</b> <b>reactor</b> near Perth. 1977 was seen as the year of mass mobilization in WA, with 300 at the first anti-nuclear demonstration to 9,000 at the third protest in the inner city of Perth. Despite public protest, the WA Government selected a first site for a nuclear reactor in 1979 at Wilbinga, 70 kilometres north of Perth. Court predicted that at least another 20 nuclear power plants would be needed {{by the end of the}} century to meet rapidly growing power demand, but all of this never eventuated.|$|E
5|$|Most of the {{reactors}} {{were shut down}} between 1964 and 1971, with an average individual life span of 22 years. The last reactor, N Reactor, continued to operate as a dual-purpose reactor, being both a <b>power</b> <b>reactor</b> used to feed the civilian electrical grid via the Washington Public Power Supply System (WPPSS) and a plutonium production reactor for nuclear weapons. N Reactor operated until 1987. Since then, most of the Hanford reactors have been entombed ("cocooned") to allow the radioactive materials to decay, and the surrounding structures have been removed and buried. The B-Reactor has not been cocooned and is accessible to the public on occasional guided tours. It was listed on the National Register of Historic Places in 1992, and some historians advocate converting it into a museum. B reactor was designated a National Historic Landmark by the National Park Service on August 19, 2008.|$|E

25|$|The U.S. Army {{also had}} a nuclear power program, {{beginning}} in 1954. The SM-1 Nuclear Power Plant, at Fort Belvoir, Virginia, was the first <b>power</b> <b>reactor</b> in the U.S. to supply electrical energy to a commercial grid (VEPCO), in April 1957, before Shippingport. The SL-1 was a U.S. Army experimental nuclear <b>power</b> <b>reactor</b> at the National Reactor Testing Station in eastern Idaho. It underwent a steam explosion and meltdown in January 1961, which killed its three operators. In the Soviet Union at The Mayak Production Association facility {{there were a number}} of accidents, including an explosion, that released 50–100 tonnes of high-level radioactive waste, contaminating a huge territory in the eastern Urals and causing numerous deaths and injuries. The Soviet regime kept this accident secret for about 30 years. The event was eventually rated at 6 on the seven-level INES scale (third in severity only to the disasters at Chernobyl and Fukushima).|$|E
25|$|Most {{experiments}} on polywells involve low-beta plasma regimes (where β < 1), where the plasma pressure is weak {{compared to the}} magnetic pressure. Several models describe magnetic trapping in polywells. Tests indicated that plasma confinement is enhanced in a magnetic cusp configuration when β (plasma pressure/magnetic field pressure) is of order unity. This enhancement is required for a fusion <b>power</b> <b>reactor</b> based on cusp confinement to be feasible.|$|E
25|$|While {{the cost}} of {{constructing}} established nuclear <b>power</b> <b>reactor</b> designs has followed an increasing trend due to regulations and court cases whereas the levelized cost of electricity is declining for wind power.

25|$|From 1954 to 1955, the U.S. Army {{evaluated}} {{their need}} for nuclear reactor plants that would be operable in remote regions of the Arctic. The reactors were to replace diesel generators and boilers that provided electricity and space heating for the Army's radar stations. The Army Reactors Branch formed the guidelines for the project and contracted with Argonne National Laboratory to design, build, and test a prototype reactor plant {{to be called the}} Argonne Low <b>Power</b> <b>Reactor</b> (ALPR).|$|E
25|$|The first {{heavy water}} moderated design in Canada was the ZEEP, which started {{operation}} {{just after the}} end of World War II. ZEEP was joined by several other experimental machines, including the NRX in 1947 and NRU in 1957. These efforts led to the first CANDU-type reactor, the Nuclear Power Demonstration (NPD), in Rolphton, Ontario. It was intended as a proof-of-concept and rated for only 22 MWe, a very low power for a commercial <b>power</b> <b>reactor.</b> NPD produced the first nuclear-generated electricity in Canada, and ran successfully from 1962 to 1987.|$|E
25|$|In January 1975, a {{deal was}} {{announced}} {{for a single}} CANDU 6 reactor {{to be built in}} South Korea, now known as the Wolsong-1 <b>Power</b> <b>Reactor.</b> Construction started in 1977 and commercial operation began in April 1983. In December 1990 a further deal was announced for three additional units at the same site, which began operation in the period 1997–1999. South Korea also negotiated development and technology transfer deals with Westinghouse for their advanced System-80 reactor design, and all future development is based on locally built versions of this reactor.|$|E

However, care is needed to avoid uncontrolled operation at dangerously high power levels.|$|R

25|$|Following {{graduation}} from the U.S. Naval Academy, Anders took his commission in the U.S. Air Force. After receiving his pilot wings in 1956, {{he served as}} a fighter pilot in all-weather interceptor squadrons of the Air Defense Command in California and in Iceland, where he participated in early intercepts of Soviet heavy bombers who at the time were challenging America's air defense borders. While at the Air Force Weapons Laboratory in New Mexico, he was responsible for technical management of nuclear <b>power</b> <b>reactor</b> shielding and radiation effects programs.|$|E
25|$|As of 2012, {{according}} to the IAEA, worldwide there were 68 civil nuclear power reactors under construction in 15 countries, approximately 28 of which in the Peoples Republic of China (PRC), with the most recent nuclear <b>power</b> <b>reactor,</b> as of May 2013, {{to be connected to}} the electrical grid, occurring on February 17, 2013 in Hongyanhe Nuclear Power Plant in the PRC. In the United States, two new Generation III reactors are under construction at Vogtle. U.S. nuclear industry officials expect five new reactors to enter service by 2020, all at existing plants. In 2013, four aging, uncompetitive, reactors were permanently closed.|$|E
25|$|In 1978, the EC, Japan, United States, and USSR {{joined in}} the International Tokamak Reactor (INTOR) Workshop, {{under the auspices of}} the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), to assess the {{readiness}} of magnetic fusion to move forward to the experimental <b>power</b> <b>reactor</b> (EPR) stage, to identify the additional R that must be undertaken, and to define the characteristics of such an EPR by means of a conceptual design. Hundreds of fusion scientists and engineers in each participating country took part in a detailed assessment of the then present status of the tokamak confinement concept vis-a-vis the requirements of an EPR, identified the required R by early 1980, and produced a conceptual design by mid-1981.|$|E

25|$|Uranium dioxide (UO2) powder is {{compacted}} to cylindrical pellets and sintered at {{high temperatures}} to produce ceramic nuclear fuel pellets {{with a high}} density and well defined physical properties and chemical composition. A grinding process is used to achieve a uniform cylindrical geometry with narrow tolerances. Such fuel pellets are then stacked and filled into the metallic tubes. The metal used for the tubes depends {{on the design of}} the reactor. Stainless steel was used in the past, but most reactors now use a zirconium alloy which, in addition to being highly corrosion-resistant, has low neutron absorption. The tubes containing the fuel pellets are sealed: these tubes are called fuel rods. The finished fuel rods are grouped into fuel assemblies that are used to build up the core of a <b>power</b> <b>reactor.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{a nuclear}} <b>power</b> <b>reactor,</b> {{there are two}} types of fuel. The first is fissile material, which splits when hit by neutrons, {{releasing}} a large amount of energy and also releasing two or three new neutrons. These can split more fissile material, resulting in a continued chain reaction. Examples of fissile fuels are U-233, U-235 and Pu-239. The second type of fuel is called fertile. Examples of fertile fuel are Th-232 (mined thorium) and U-238 (mined uranium). Often the amount of fertile fuel in the reactor is far greater than the amount of fissile, but it cannot be fissioned directly. It must first absorb one of the 2 or 3 neutrons produced in the fission process, which is called neutron capture, then it becomes a fissile isotope by radioactive decay. This process is called breeding.|$|E
25|$|Units 2 and 3 {{were both}} {{originally}} {{licensed by the}} NRC for 40 years of operation. The NRC limits commercial <b>power</b> <b>reactor</b> licenses to an initial 40 years, but also permits such licenses to be renewed. This original 40-year term for reactor licenses was based on economic and antitrust considerations, not on limitations of nuclear technology. Due to this selected period, however, some structures and components may have been engineered {{on the basis of}} an expected 40-year service life. The original federal license for Unit Two expired on September 28, 2013, and the license for Unit Three was due to expire in December 2015. On April 30, 2007, Entergy submitted an application for a 20-year renewal of the licenses for both units. On May 2, 2007, the NRC announced that this application is available for public review. Because the owner submitted license renewal applications at least five years prior to the original expiration date, the units are allowed to continue operation past this date while the NRC considers the renewal application.|$|E
