5|$|Two {{high-level}} island platforms serve {{three of}} the four Northeast Corridor passenger tracks; there is a center <b>passing</b> <b>track,</b> as well as a fifth track on the south side that is only used by CSX and Norfolk Southern freights. Most SEPTA Trenton Line trains and five daily Amtrak trains (two northbound and three southbound) stop at these platforms. Two low-level platforms, a short distance to the west, serve the diverging SEPTA-owned Chestnut Hill West Line. North Philadelphia has been a flag stop on the line since 1993. The station has relatively low inbound boardings; however, it is used by riders from the Chestnut Hill West Line transferring to SEPTA and Amtrak trains to reach jobs in New Jersey and New York.|$|E
5|$|The $46.9 million {{station was}} opened during a ribbon-cutting {{ceremony}} on February 4, 2002, attended by Everett Mayor Ed Hansen, Governor Gary Locke, U.S. Representative Rick Larsen, Snohomish County Executive Bob Drewel and Sound Transit Board chairman and King County Executive Ron Sims. Initially, only Everett Transit and Community Transit operated {{out of the}} station on opening day, but they were quickly joined by Sound Transit Express service the following day and Greyhound intercity bus service that summer. Amtrak was initially expected to begin serving Everett Station in July 2002, but the construction of a <b>passing</b> <b>track</b> delayed the move of the Cascades and Empire Builder from Bond Street Station to November 12. Construction of a Sounder commuter rail platform and rail spur was approved by the Everett City Council in September 2002, pending reimbursement from Sound Transit and Amtrak for its cost of $726,000. Sounder service to King Street Station in Seattle via Edmonds began with special Seattle Seahawks gameday service on December 22, 2003, carrying 700 passengers on the inaugural run of the Sounder North Line.|$|E
5|$|From the {{introduction}} of Massachusetts Bay Transportation Authority (MBTA) funding in 1965 until the mid-2000s, Wedgemere station remained essentially static. The Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 required transit agencies to make certain stations handicapped accessible. A number of high-ridership stations on the MBTA Commuter Rail system were upgraded, but due to its relatively low ridership — less than 600 riders per day as of 2009 — Wedgemere was not chosen as a key station for upgrades. Wedgemere had older low-level platforms, and access from the street was via stairs only. Beginning in 2008, a local family lobbied the MBTA to make the station accessible; in July 2009, the Federal Transit Administration granted the MBTA permission to build mini-high platforms. (Full-length high level platforms {{would not have been}} possible because the Lowell Line is a designated freight corridor; full-length platforms cause operational difficulties with freight trains. Wedgemere does not have room for a dedicated freight <b>passing</b> <b>track</b> like Anderson RTC.) In February 2010, the MBTA announced that $2 million in federal stimulus funds had been allotted to the project, part of a grant that also funded construction of the John W. Olver Transit Center and repairs to the Red Line tunnels between Harvard and Alewife. The work was then intended to be finished by the end of 2010.|$|E

25|$|There may {{be other}} sidings at the station which are lower speed tracks for other purposes. A {{maintenance}} track or a maintenance siding, usually connected to a <b>passing</b> <b>track,</b> is used for parking maintenance equipment, trains not in service, autoracks or sleepers. A refuge track is a dead-end siding that is connected to a station track as a temporary storage of a disabled train.|$|E
25|$|A {{track with}} a {{spot at the}} station to board and {{disembark}} trains is called station track or house track {{regardless of whether it}} is a main line or loop line. If such track is served by a platform, the track may be called platform track. A loop line without a platform which is used to allow a train to clear the main line at the station only, it is called <b>passing</b> <b>track.</b> A track at the station without a platform which is used for trains to pass the station without stopping is called through track.|$|E
25|$|On May 6, 1872, the Watts Street station opened, and on June 17, 1872, the Little West 12th Street station {{opened with}} a <b>passing</b> <b>track.</b> On August 15, 1872 the Morris Street station was opened. On March 19, 1873, the Morris Street station was closed {{in favor of a}} {{terminal}} at the rear of 7 Broadway, where the company offices were located. US mail was carried on regular passenger trains on the front platform of the first car accompanied by a US Post Office guard with a limit of 7 bags. Railway Postal Office cars were not used for this service. The first yard and engine repair shop was located here. On January 21, 1873, the Franklin Street station opened. At the time, running time on the line was 28 minutes. On July 30, 1873, the line was extended to 34th Street on Ninth Avenue. On October 21, 1873, the 21st Street station opened. On November 3, 1873, the Houston Street station opened. On December 13, 1873, a new station opened at 30th Street, which replaced the original terminal at 29th Street. On May 25, 1874, a new and larger Cortlandt Street station replaced the original Dey Street station.|$|E

2500|$|Unknown to Casey, three {{separate}} trains {{were in the}} station at Vaughan: double-header freight train No. 83 (located {{to the north and}} headed south, which had been delayed due to having two drawbars pulled while at Vaughan) and long freight train No. 72 (located to the south and headed north) were both in the <b>passing</b> <b>track</b> to the east of the main line. As the combined length of the trains was ten cars longer than the length of the east <b>passing</b> <b>track,</b> some of the cars were stopped on the main line. [...] The two sections of northbound local passenger train No. 26 had arrived from Canton earlier, and required a [...] "saw by" [...] for them to get to the [...] "house track" [...] west of the main line. [...] The [...] "saw by" [...] maneuver required that No. 83 back up (onto the main line) to allow No. 72 to move northward and pull its overlapping cars off the main line and onto the east side track from the south switch, thus allowing the two sections of No. 26 {{to gain access to the}} west house track. [...] The [...] "saw by", however, left the rear cars of No. 83 overlapping above the north switch and on the main line – right in Jones' path. [...] As workers prepared a second [...] "saw by" [...] to let Jones pass, an air hose broke on No. 72, locking its brakes and leaving the last four cars of No. 83 on the main line.|$|E

2500|$|The Lötschberg axis, {{with the}} Lötschberg Base Tunnel in the Bernese Alps was {{constructed}} by the company BLS Alp Transit AG. The [...] long base tunnel opened to traffic on 7 December 2007; {{it was the first}} part of the NRLA to be delivered, though in an only partly completed state. It supports the western transit link via Basel – Olten – Bern – Brig – Domodossola – Milan. For most traffic, it replaces the existing higher altitude [...] Lötschberg Tunnel that opened in 1913. Because of cost overruns of the overall NRLA project, some of the funding was diverted to the Gotthard Base Tunnel and only one of the two bores of the Lötschberg Base Tunnel has been fully completed and is equipped for rail use. The other bore was completed on only one third of its length and excavated a further third, with the final third unstarted. High-speed track switches allow the use of the completed third as a <b>passing</b> <b>track,</b> but the 21 km of single track without passing loops greatly complicate operations and reduce the capacity of the line. Trains are scheduled by batches in each direction separated by long intervals, and trains more than 7 minutes late are either routed via the old line or must wait for the next available timetable slot in their direction in the LBT, incurring further delay in either case. The cost of completing the second bore is estimated to be 1 billion Swiss Francs..|$|E
