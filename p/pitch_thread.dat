50|$|Screw jacks {{are limited}} in their lifting capacity. Increasing load {{increases}} friction within the screw threads. A fine <b>pitch</b> <b>thread,</b> which would increase {{the advantage of the}} screw, also reduces the size and strength of the threads. Longer operating levers soon reach a point where the lever will simply bend at their inner end.|$|E
50|$|Coarse threads {{are those}} with larger <b>pitch</b> (fewer <b>threads</b> per axial distance), and fine threads are those with smaller <b>pitch</b> (more <b>threads</b> per axial distance). Coarse threads {{have a larger}} threadform {{relative}} to screw diameter, where fine threads have a smaller threadform relative to screw diameter. This distinction is analogous to that between coarse teeth and fine teeth on a saw or file, or between coarse grit and fine grit on sandpaper.|$|R
5000|$|The British Standard Fine (BSF) {{standard}} has {{the same}} thread angle as the BSW, but has a finer <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> and smaller <b>thread</b> depth. This is more like the modern [...] "mechanical" [...] screw and was used for fine machinery and for steel bolts.|$|R
5000|$|This new {{standard}} specified a 55° thread angle and a thread depth of 0.640327p and a radius of 0.137329p, where p is the <b>pitch.</b> The <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> increased with diameter in steps specified on a chart.

50|$|In {{addition}} to coarse and fine threads, {{there is another}} division of extra fine, or “superfine” threads, with a very fine <b>pitch</b> <b>thread.</b> Superfine pitch metric threads are occasionally used in automotive components, such as suspension struts, and are commonly used in the aviation manufacturing industry. This is because extra fine threads are more resistant to coming loose from vibrations.|$|E

If the pitch is the normally used [...] "coarse" [...] pitch listed in ISO 261 or ISO 262, it can be omitted (e.g., M8). Tolerance classes defined in ISO 965-1 can be appended to these designations, if required (e.g., M500- 6g in external threads). If, for instance, only M20 is given then it is coarse <b>pitch</b> <b>thread.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Thread limit or pitch {{diameter}} limit {{is a standard}} used for classifying the tolerance of the thread {{pitch diameter}} for taps. For imperial, H or L limits are used which designate how many units of 5 ten thousandths of an inch over or undersized the pitch diameter is from its basic value, respectively. Thus a tap designated with an H limit of 3, denoted H3, would have a pitch diameter 5 ten thousandths × 3 = 1.5 thousandths of an inch larger than base pitch diameter and would thus result in cutting an external thread with a looser fit than say an H2 tap. Metric uses D or DU limits {{which is the same}} system as imperial, but uses D or DU designators for over and undersized respectively, and goes by units of 0.013 mm.Generally taps come in the range of H1 to H5 and rarely L1.The pitch diameter of a thread is measured where the radial cross section of a single thread equals [...]5 x Pitchexample: 16 <b>pitch</b> <b>thread</b> = 1/16" [...] = [...]0625" [...] the pitch actual pitch diameter of the thread is measured at the radial cross section measures [...]03125" ...|$|E

40|$|Objectives : Implant design {{features}} such as macro- and micro-design may influence overall implant success. Limited information is currently available. Therefore, it {{is the purpose of}} this paper to examine these factors such as thread <b>pitch,</b> <b>thread</b> geometry, helix angle, thread depth and width as well as implant crestal module may affect implant stability. Search Strategy : A literature search was conducted using MEDLINE to identify studies, from simulated laboratory models, animal, to human, related to this topic using the keywords of implant thread, implant macrodesign, thread <b>pitch,</b> <b>thread</b> geometry, helix angle, thread depth, thread width and implant crestal module. Results : The results showed how thread geometry affects the distribution of stress forces around the implant. A decreased thread pitch may positively influence implant stability. Excess helix angles in spite of a faster insertion may jeopardize the ability of implants to sustain axial load. Deeper threads seem to have an important effect on the stabilization in poorer bone quality situations. The addition of threads or microthreads up to the crestal module of an implant might provide a potential positive contribution on bone-to to-implant contact as well as on the preservation of marginal bone; nonetheless this remains to be determined. Conclusions : Appraising the current literature on this subject and combining existing data to verify the presence of any association between the selected characteristics may be critical in the achievement of overall implant success.

50|$|The Whitworth thread was the world's first {{national}} screw thread standard, devised and specified by Joseph Whitworth in 1841. Until then, the only standardization was what little {{had been done}} by individual people and companies, with some companies' in-house standards spreading a bit within their industries. Whitworth's new standard specified a 55° thread angle and a thread depth of 0.640327p and a radius of 0.137329p, where p is the <b>pitch.</b> The <b>thread</b> <b>pitch</b> increases with diameter in steps specified on a chart.|$|R

40|$|Proper initial load is {{necessary}} to ensure {{the stability of the}} bolted connections. In order to apply appropriate torque, the relationship between tightening torque and initial load should be determined. In this study, a detailed three-dimensional finite element model of bolted joints was established with consideration of helix angle, <b>pitch,</b> <b>thread</b> type, tooth-type angle, and other details. The process of pre-tightening of bolted joints was simulated to validate the finite element model. The curves for the relationship between the torque and initial load obtained from finite element analysis agree well with those calculated from theoretical equations. Then, the influence of the friction coefficient, pitch, elastic modulus, assembly clearance, and strain-hardening exponent on the relationship was studied. The results show that the friction coefficient between nut and joint has great influence on the relationship between torque and initial load, that is, the larger the friction coefficient, the smaller the initial load of bolt at the same tightening torque. In contrast, the pitch, assembly clearance, Young’s modulus, and strain-hardening exponent have little influence on torque–initial load relation. The method used in this study provides a theoretical basis for accurately determining the tightening torque for bolted joints...|$|E
40|$|In this study, the {{influence}} of the orthopedic screws engineering design such as profile shape and geometrical parameters on its biomechanical compatibility in terms of load sharing with adjacent bone tissue was investigated. The study was conducted on a set of three-dimensional finite element design models. A dimension less Stress Transfer Parameter (STP) was utilized for gauging the performances of the different screws according to its load sharing capabilities. Stress-transfer behavior was found to be linear for varying load magnitudes. The geometric properties investigated; <b>pitch,</b> <b>thread</b> length, width, major diameter and thread angle showed different influences on the three different profiles studied (triangular, trapezoidal and rectangular). The results indicated that 13 out of 32 screw designs produced were to achieve STP values greater than 0. 3 of these, 6 were the rectangular profile. The best design was of the rectangular profile (Design no. 24) with an STP value of 0. 4344. It was concluded that the best biomechanical properties were found in rectangular screw profiles. However, due to mix trends for the different properties, the careful combination and consideration towards pullout strength was necessary to obtain a design with the highest biocompatibility...|$|E
40|$|Measurement {{of thread}} {{surfaces}} accuracy {{is a subject}} of this investigation. The standard complex indicator of thread accuracy – the virtual <b>pitch</b> <b>thread</b> diameter (VPTD) is considered. The author previously developed and published the method of calculation of VPTD. This method is based on data, which are obtained from coordi-nate measuring machines (CMM). However, using this method the preliminary deter-mination of the thread axis position is assumed. Actually this case does not always occur in practice. This disadvantage limited the possibility of CMM application {{for the assessment of}} the thread accuracy significantly. Taking it into account, the additional method for the thread axis determination for the cases where the axis is located arbitrarily is offered in this article. This method includes two stages. One of them is based on the determination of average values of point cloud coordinates received from CMM. The second one is based on minimiza-tion (maximization) of objective function. The objective function, in turn, includes such parameters as parameters of thread location in CMM coordinate system. VPTD is used as the minimized (maximized) value. The concerned method is confirmed by computer calculations, which show sufficient reliability and «robust » algorithm of the accepted approach. Calculations were done with point cloud calculated theoretically by using other computer program, and also with points that were received from CMM in real mea-surement. This investigation determined sufficient minimum number of points to ob-tain the reliable result at the first most effective stage of the method. Thus, the research showed that for VPTD assessment the earlier offered method and the additional new method gives a possibility to use CMM instead of using gauges...|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} the combined effect of macro and <b>pitch</b> shortened <b>threads</b> on {{primary and secondary}} stability during healing, but before dynamic loading. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Two sets of turned implants with different macro geometry were prepared. The test group possessed <b>pitch</b> shortened <b>threads</b> in between the large threads and the control group did not have thread alterations. The two implant groups were placed in both femur and tibiae of 10 lop-eared rabbits, {{and at the time}} of implant insertion, insertion torques were recorded. After 4 weeks, all implants were subjected to removal torque tests. RESULTS: The insertion torque values for the control and test groups for the tibia were 15. 7 and 20. 6 Ncm, respectively, and for the femur, 11. 8, and 12. 8 Ncm respectively. The removal torque values for the control and test groups in the tibia were 7. 9 and 9. 1 Ncm, respectively, and for the femur, 7. 9 and 7. 7 Ncm respectively. There was no statistically significant difference between the control and test groups. CONCLUSION: Under limited dynamic load, the addition of <b>pitch</b> shortened <b>threads</b> did not significantly improve either the primary or the secondary stability of the implants in bone...|$|R
