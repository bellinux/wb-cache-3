500|$|The {{earliest}} anarchist themes can {{be found}} in the 6th century BC among the works of Taoist philosopher Laozi and in later centuries by Zhuangzi and Bao Jingyan.

Georges Lechartier wrote: [...] "The true founder of anarchy was Jesus Christ and... the first anarchist society was that of the apostles".
