5|$|Tracing its lineage to a {{military}} government group that was active after World War II, the 95th Civil Affairs Brigade was not officially activated until 2006, and remained a <b>provisional</b> <b>unit</b> until 2007. Its creation {{was part of a}} U.S. Army plan to increase civil affairs units overall.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, {{the brigade}} {{took on the}} {{additional}} responsibility of training Reserve Officer's Training Corps cadets. The 8th Brigade, 95th Division was activated as a <b>provisional</b> <b>unit</b> in charge of ROTC units throughout the southwestern United States. In 2005, the division headquarters were relocated to Fort Sill, Oklahoma. This put the division at the area's major training center, allowing it to more effectively provide training oversight.|$|E
5|$|Employing the Sub Intelligent Numbers Selector {{theory that}} {{assigned}} non-descript unit names and randomized numerical designations to formations {{in order to}} disguise their role from the enemy, the company was designated the 8213th Army Unit. Upon formation, {{it was decided that}} the company would be considered an ad hoc, or <b>provisional</b> <b>unit,</b> which meant it did not have a permanent lineage and was only a temporary formation, akin to a task force. This decision was unique to the Eighth Army Ranger Company, as subsequent companies assumed the lineage of Ranger units from World War II, and veterans later expressed resentment with the choice as it prevented the company from accruing its own campaign streamers or unit decorations. While subsequent Ranger companies were authorized shoulder sleeve insignia with the distinctive black and red scroll of their World War II predecessors, the Eighth Army Ranger Company wore the shoulder patch of the Eighth United States Army, which commanded all UN troops in Korea.|$|E

5|$|The {{success of}} these rifle units during the skirmishing period, coupled {{with the arrival of}} large numbers of new army recruits, led Washington to create {{additional}} provisional rifle companies. He placed them under the command of Daniel Morgan in early June 1777, calling the unit the Provisional Rifle Corps, although it was most commonly known as Morgan's Rifle Corps in period documents. Morgan then simultaneously led the 11th Virginia Regiment, his permanent unit, and this <b>provisional</b> <b>unit.</b> Thirty-five officers and enlisted men in Smith's and Long's composite companies, as well as others selected from their regular musket regiments, were detached from their permanent units to form this elite regiment-sized force. The men from the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment all served in one of the Rifle Corps' eight companies, Capt. Gabriel Long's Provisional Rifle Company; {{with the exception of a}} single man, all other members of the company came from the 11th Virginia Regiment. Like Morgan, Long was now technically in command of two Continental Army units, one permanent and one provisional. Long served in the Rifle Corps until his resignation in May 1779, at which time command of his company passed to Marylander Lt. Elijah Evans, also one of the original officers of the Maryland and Virginia Rifle Regiment. Evans returned to Rawlings' regiment, his permanent unit, when his detached duty in the Rifle Corps ended with its formal disbanding in early November 1779. The Rifle Corps is most notable for the major role it played in the Battles of Saratoga.|$|E

5000|$|Weather {{reconnaissance}} for Eighth Air Force {{was initially}} performed on {{an ad hoc}} basis by heavy bombers detailed to the 18th Weather Squadron for individual missions. In the spring of 1944, Eighth Air Force created <b>provisional</b> reconnaissance <b>units,</b> primarily for weather reconnaissance. On 22 March, it brought these <b>provisional</b> <b>units</b> together, along with a squadron for special reconnaissance, under the 8th Reconnaissance Group (Special) (Provisional) at RAF Cheddington, England. This unit became the 802d Reconnaissance Group (Special)(Provisional) on 30 March 1944, and moved to RAF Watton on 12 April 1944. [...] In July, Eighth received permission to organize these <b>provisional</b> <b>units</b> into a regular organization and on 9 August, it activated the 25th Bombardment Group, Reconnaissance from {{the resources of the}} provisional 802d Group and assigned to it the 652d, 653d and 654th Bombardment Squadrons.|$|R

50|$|The 4589th/4590th TFS were <b>provisional</b> <b>units,</b> {{pending the}} {{transfer}} of the 389th and 390th TFSs from the 12th and 366th TFWs in Southeast Asia. All three squadrons adopted the MO tail code under the common wing concept in June 1972.|$|R
25|$|In April 1943, Webster assumed {{command of}} the 42nd Bomb Wing, a unit without men or aircraft. In the Mediterranean Theater of Operations, Webster {{supervised}} the incorporation of air groups in August. He took official command on August 24, 1943. Webster commanded the unit during its participation in the Allied invasion of Italy. In July 1944, he was appointed commander of the Allied Forces in Sardinia, Italy, and deputy commander of the 12th Air Force. Going to France in March 1945, Webster assumed {{command of the}} First Tactical Air Force, a <b>provisional</b> <b>unit</b> made up of both Free French and American units.|$|E
25|$|The {{squadron}} {{was first}} organized as a <b>provisional</b> <b>unit</b> at Kelly Field, Texas in June 1917. In early August the unit received formal recognition as the 38th Aero Squadron as the United States expanded the United States Army Air Service after entering World War I. A few weeks later, the squadron moved to Chanute Field, Illinois, where {{it served as}} a training unit, equipped with Curtiss JN-4 and DH-4 single engined biplanes. In July 1918, the Air Service renamed its squadrons at training fields {{if they were not}} programmed for overseas deployment as lettered squadrons and the 38th became Squadron A, Chanute Field. The squadron was demobilized in December 1918 as Chanute prepared to transition from a pilot training field into a temporary storage depot following the Armistice of 11 November 1918.|$|E

50|$|Many of battalions of the Tigris Corps {{remained}} understrength {{at the end}} of March 1916. The {{problem was}} particularly acute with the British battalions and the British officers of the Indian Army units. To deal with this, survivors of several units were amalgamated into battalions which approached full strength. Furthermore, replacement drafts meant for units besieged in Kut were formed into <b>provisional</b> <b>units.</b> These <b>provisional</b> <b>units</b> included the Highland Battalion (survivors of 1st Black Watch and 1st Seaforth Highlanders), Norsets (replacement drafts for 2nd Norfolk and 2nd Dorset regiments in Kut), Composite Dogra Battalion (37th Dogras and 41st Dogras) and the Composite Territorials (remnants of 1/5th Buffs (East Kent Regiment) and 1/4th Hampshire).|$|R
50|$|On 1 June 1997 the 16th Air Expeditionary Wing {{replaced}} the 4190th as USAF replaced its <b>provisional</b> <b>units</b> with expeditionary units.

2500|$|The {{origins of}} the 325th Photographic Wing {{can be traced to}} early 1944 when Colonel Elliott Roosevelt arrived in the United Kingdom to study and report on weather {{reconnaissance}} and photographic reconnaissance there. [...] On the basis of his report, Eighth Air Force formed a <b>provisional</b> <b>unit,</b> the 8th Reconnaissance Wing (Provisional) at RAF Cheddington on 18 February 1944 with Col. Roosevelt as its commander. [...] The wing moved to RAF High Wycombe a few months later. [...] During the preparation for Operation Overlord, the Normandy invasion, the wing flew the first advanced aerial weather scouting missions for strategic bombardment missions.

2500|$|At midnight between July 12 and 13, Obrenović set {{out with}} some units north of Liplje to {{organize}} an ambush of forward components of 28th Division. [...] The ambush was laid, but no ARBiH units arrived. [...] Leaving some troops at Snagovo, Obrenović and the rest returned to Zvornik. When he arrived at brigade headquarters, he was informed that the column had been stopped on the road from Kravica, Konjević Polje, to Milici, {{and that there were}} no troops in their area. [...] Shortly thereafter he received word from intercept groups that chatter was picking up in the area stretching from Cerska toward Kamenica, despite Drina Corps' reassurance that there was no troop presence there. 28th Division radio intercepts showed that their security slipped up and the Serbs were able to learn that their numbers were 1,000-1,500 in that area. Later on July 13 Obrenović strengthened the units that had stayed up there providing the ambush, and he decided to organise a <b>provisional</b> <b>unit,</b> grouping squad and platoon from the units at his disposal: 15 soldiers from the engineers company, five or six soldiers from the staff command, and about 15 to 20 soldiers from the logistics battalion, a remaining platoon from the 5th Battalion, and an intervention platoon; this formed a unit with the strength of a company.|$|E

The great call-up transformed the national guard into a much more effective fighting force, for it was as close as the United States came to the large-scale military maneuvers in which European armies traditionally engaged.|$|R
50|$|A complicating {{factor for}} an O/B was the {{composition}} of the VC and the PAVN. Regularly uniformed, 'conventional' soldiers were often called (in the parlance of the American military in Vietnam) 'main force' units.
