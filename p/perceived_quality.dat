Then it proposes hypotheses reflecting {{the effect of these}} factors on Chinese consumer perceived value (functional value, social value and affective value) and on online purchase intention. Using questionnaire, the researcher gets 184 copies of valid questionnaires. The data is processed by statistical analysis: descriptive statistical analysis, reliability and validity test, correlation analysis and regression analysis. The conclusions are developed as follows. Firstly, <b>perceived</b> product <b>quality,</b> <b>perceived</b> website service <b>quality,</b> purchase costs and online perceived risk all have significant effect on Chinese consumer online perceived value (functional value, affective value and social value).

25|$|Anosognosia {{is a lack}} of {{awareness}} or understanding of the loss of function caused by the brain injury and is common in individuals who have suffered a right hemisphere stroke. Because patients with anosognosia may be unaware of their deficits, they may be less likely to seek treatment once they are released from the hospital. The lack of proper treatment could lead to higher levels of dependency later on. In order to make functional recovery gains, right hemisphere stroke survivors should receive rehabilitation services, so patients with anosognosia should be encouraged to seek out additional treatment. However, due to the anosognosia, these patients often report a higher <b>perceived</b> <b>quality</b> of life than other right hemisphere stroke survivors because of the unawareness of the resulting deficits (Daia et al., 2014). Patients with smaller lesions often recover faster from anosognosia than patients with larger lesions resulting in anosognosia (Hier et al., 1983).|$|E

However, the loss at the beginning of voiced segments has the most severe impact on <b>perceived</b> speech <b>quality.</b> The convergence time depends on the speech content (voiced/unvoiced). For unvoiced segments, the convergence time is stable whereas for voiced segments it varies but has an upper bound at the end of the segment.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the functional diversity of the contributors in a CSCW as a major determinant of <b>perceived</b> information <b>quality.</b> The study relied on the Technology Acceptance Model (TAM), the Theory of Reasoned Action (TRA) and the Theory of Planned Behavior (TPB) to propose a theoretical model which shows that <b>perceived</b> information <b>quality</b> influences <b>perceived</b> risk and trusting belief of the users of these systems. Both perceived risk and trusting belief shape the intention to use a computer supported collaborative work systems. This study conducted a web-based survey to validate the theoretical model. The study focused on the use of computer-supported collaborative work systems in the Federal Highway Administration. This study empirically validated the theoretical model. Scales were developed within the context of the variables (functional diversity, <b>perceived</b> information <b>quality,</b> <b>perceived</b> risk, trusting belief, and intention to use.) to survey discipline members at the Federal Highway Administration. The statistical results showed support for <b>perceived</b> information <b>quality’s</b> positive influence on trusting belief, <b>perceived</b> information <b>quality’s</b> negative influence on perceived risk, perceived risk’s negative influence on the intention to use a CSCW and trusting belief’s positive influence on the intention to use a CSCW.
