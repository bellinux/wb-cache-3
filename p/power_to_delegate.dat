5|$|Organisationally, {{the commune}} of Pichilemu has a mayor–council form of government. This {{provides}} for a commune-wide elected mayor serving in an executive role, {{as well as a}} city council serving in a legislative role. The mayor, as the highest authority of the commune of Pichilemu, has the responsibility to direct, manage and supervise the work of the municipality, and legally represents the commune. The mayor is also responsible for administrating the commune's financial resources, and municipal and national goods of public use, presides the local city council, and has the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>delegate</b> his work to other functionaries of the local government, which he may appoint. Additionally, the mayor may give a public account of his gesture to the city council every year, usually in April; an extract of his account may be published to the community. If the mayor dies in office, resigns, or is unable to carry out his/her duties, a councilor may be elected by the city council to replace the former mayor. In the meantime, the municipal secretary may take office as acting mayor. This has happened several times in Pichilemu: following the resignation of René Maturana Maldonado in April 1992, municipal secretary Gustavo Parraguez Galarce took over his office since, at the time, there were no councilors; in November 1998, mayor Jorge Vargas González was convicted of illegally giving a driver's license, and the city council chose councilor Carlos Leyton Labarca until Vargas González resumed his duties in November 1999.|$|E

50|$|In {{many parts}} of the protectorate, there were few strong chiefs and, at first the powers of {{existing}} chiefs who were powerful was minimised in favour of direct rule by the Collectors. From 1912, Collectors were able to nominate Principal headmen and village headmen as local intermediaries between the protectorate administration and local people, in an early form of Indirect rule. Each Collector could determine what <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>delegate</b> <b>to</b> headmen in his district, and some appointed traditional chiefs as Principal headmen with significant authority locally.|$|R

2500|$|Miller now {{considered}} the third question. The majority held {{that although the}} language of the two statutes of January 31, 1863, and February 4, 1863, were different, they had the same legal intent and force. Virginia showed [...] "good faith" [...] in holding the elections, Miller asserted. That the Reorganized Virginia legislature did not require vote totals to be reported to it and delegated the transmission of the vote totals to West Virginia was not at issue, Miller said. [...] It gave the Reorganized Governor discretion as to when and where to hold the votes, under what condition the votes should be held, and to certify the votes. The legislature acted within its <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>delegate</b> these duties to the Reorganized Governor, [...] "and his decision [...] conclusive as to the result." [...] Were these votes fair and regular? The Virginia Assembly, Miller noted, made only [...] "indefinite and vague" [...] allegations about vote fraud, and unspecified charges that somehow Governor Pierpont must have been [...] "misled and deceived" [...] by others into believing the voting was fair and regular. Miller pointedly observed that not a single person was charged with fraud, no specific act of fraud was stated, and no legal wrongs asserted. The Virginia Assembly also did not claim that the state of West Virginia interfered in the elections. Absent such allegations, Virginia's accusations cannot be sustained, Miller concluded. [...] But even if this aspect of Virginia's argument was ignored, Miller wrote, the Reorganized legislature had delegated all its power to certify to the election to Governor Pierpont, and he had certified it. That alone laid to rest Virginia's allegations. [...] " [...] must be bound by what she had done. She can have no right, years after all this has been settled, to come into a court of chancery to charge that her own conduct has been a wrong and a fraud; that her own subordinate agents have misled her governor, and that her solemn act transferring these counties shall be set aside, against the will of the State of West Virginia, and without consulting the wishes of the people of those counties." ...|$|E

2500|$|Miller had {{criticized the}} provincial government's {{previous}} authority over Toronto as constitutionally outdated and {{a barrier to}} economic growth, noting that simple changes like parking levies and tax-free transit passes needed approval from the provincial government. [...] He gave his full support to the McGuinty government's City of Toronto Act, which grants {{a variety of new}} <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> the city. In 2005, he wrote that the City of Toronto Act will [...] "give the city freedom and flexibility to deliver services creatively and effectively", and that it [...] "will essentially be Toronto's constitution". [...] The act was formally proclaimed on January 1, 2007. [...] Soon after, Toronto used its new <b>powers</b> <b>to</b> <b>delegate</b> local matters <b>to</b> community councils, and announced plans for a Lobbying Control Framework. Recently, Miller has used the Act to justify the $600,000 cost of hiring new staff for his office, saying that his position has increased responsibilities.|$|R
50|$|It {{should be}} {{emphasised}} that {{the essence of}} the Carltona doctrine therefore lies in the elision of the identity of departmental officials with the relevant Minister.

40|$|Some {{existing}} studies {{argue that}} indirect colonial rule adversely affects postcolonial development.

The colonial <b>power</b> decides whether <b>to</b> <b>delegate</b> policy choice in multiple districts, and can acquire information by paying a cost in each district. We show that colonial <b>powers</b> are prone <b>to</b> adopt indirect rule when the heterogeneity among districts is high. The results are a possible explanation for why colonial powers utilized indirect rule in Africa, a region with high levels of ethnic diversity...|$|R

5000|$|After a {{conversation}} with Urwick, A.V. Graicunas wrote an article, [...] "Relationship in Organization", that was published in 1933 in the Bulletin of the International Management Institute. In this article, Graicunas noted that superiors must be cognizant of not only their direct relationships of their subordinates, but the cross relationships between subordinates and different subgroupings. Graicunas went on to apply a mathematical formula to show that each increase of direct relationships by 1 represented a 25% increase in <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>delegate</b> {{and more than a}} 100% increase in the burden of supervision and co-ordination. Urwick expanded on these findings to provide the recommendation that [...] "no superior can supervise directly the work of more than five or, at the most, six subordinates whose work interlocks".|$|E
5000|$|In 1959, {{the first}} state {{legislature}} established the Department of Fish and Game. However, full authority could not be granted until January 1, 1960, when the regulations and statutes were in place. They gave the commissioner great authority to manage the fish and game resources. Alaska Statute 16.05.020 stated the commissioner shall: (1) supervise and control the department and may employ division heads, enforcement agents, and the technical, clerical and other assistants necessary for the general administration of the department; (2) manage, protect, maintain, improve, and extend the fish, game and aquatic plant resources {{of the state in}} the interests of the economy and general well-being of the state; and (3) have necessary power to accomplish the foregoing including, but not limited to, the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>delegate</b> authority to subordinate officers and employees of the department.|$|E
5000|$|Under 1940 the act {{a county}} manager was {{the manager of}} every borough or {{municipal}} town in that county, but from the 1990s had the <b>power</b> <b>to</b> <b>delegate</b> these functions to any other officer of that borough or town council. The Borough of Dún Laoghaire, with nearly the level of autonomy as a county borough, had a borough manager from its 1930 creation. Initially, some smaller counties shared a manager. On several occasions, the Minister for the Environment has suspended a fractious elected council, leaving the manager to run its affairs until the next local elections. The split of Galway city from County Galway in 1985, and of County Dublin into three counties in 1993 saw separate managers appointed. A 2010 report commissioned by the Government suggested {{reducing the number of}} county managers from 34 to 24.
