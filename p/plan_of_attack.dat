5|$|Abercrombie held a war {{council that}} evening. The options he {{presented}} {{to his staff}} were limited to asking if the next day's attack should be in three ranks or four; the council opted for three. Abercrombie's <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> omitted Clerk's recommendation to fortify the summit of Rattlesnake Hill; {{in addition to the}} frontal assault, 4 six-pound guns and a howitzer were to be floated down the La Chute River and mounted at the base of Rattlesnake Hill, with 20 bateaux of troops to support the effort.|$|E
5|$|Gibraltar {{was part}} of a 17-ship squadron, keeping four French ships-of-the-line in Fort Royal, Martinique, when on 29April 1781 a 20-ship fleet and a {{merchant}} convoy under Contre-amiral François deGrasse arrived from Brest. Out of sight of the British, deGrasse put a man ashore to swap information with Fort Royal's garrison, and agree on a <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> with the blockaded ships.|$|E
5|$|In Montreal, Carleton {{was finally}} prodded to move. Under {{constant}} criticism {{for failure to}} act sooner, and mistrustful of his militia forces, he developed a <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> He sent word to Colonel Allan Maclean at Quebec to bring more of his Royal Highland Emigrants and some militia forces to Sorel, from where they would move up the Richelieu toward St. Jean, while Carleton would lead a force across the Saint Lawrence at Longueuil.|$|E

5|$|On 20 August 636, {{the final}} day of the battle, Khalid put into action a simple but bold <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b> With his massed cavalry force he {{intended}} to drive the Byzantine cavalry entirely off the battlefield so that the infantry, which formed the bulk of the imperial army, would be left without cavalry support and thus would be exposed when attacked from the flanks and rear.|$|E
5|$|On October 11, the Port Said Sector was {{reinforced}} with the 103rd Sa'iqa battalion of the 139th Sa'iqa Group. The battalion had arrived from Cairo, {{and three days}} later the sector received ten new fiberglass boats from Alexandria. The boats however had been sent without necessary maintenance of the boats themselves or their engines. With the arrival of these reinforcements and equipment, Salah began to lay a <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack.</b>|$|E
5|$|After unrelenting {{political}} pressure from Adolf Hitler, Yugoslavia signed the Tripartite Pact on 25 March 1941. On 27 March, {{a military coup}} d'état overthrew the government that had signed the pact, and a new government was formed under {{the commander of the}} VVKJ, Armijski đeneral Dušan Simović. A general mobilisation was not initiated by the new government until 3 April 1941, out of fear of offending Hitler and thus precipitating war. However, on the same day as the coup, Hitler issued Führer Directive 25 which called for Yugoslavia to be treated as a hostile state, and on 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, detailing the <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> and command structure for the German-led Axis invasion.|$|E
50|$|Another {{version is}} that Darragh's eldest son had already joined the Continental Army when she overheard the plans.

5|$|Near {{the town}} of Bazeilles, the Engineers and assault {{infantry}} had gathered to prepare the boats for the crossing of the Meuse at Wadelincourt when an artillery barrage from the French positions destroyed 81 out of 96 rubber boats. The <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> had included an assault by both the 69th and 89th Infantry Regiments, but the loss of so many boats meant that only the 86th Infantry Regiment was able to conduct the crossing. The 69th Infantry Regiment was kept in reserve to follow the 86th as reinforcements.|$|E
5|$|On 3 April, Führer Directive 26 was issued, {{detailing}} the <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> and command {{structure for the}} invasion. Hungary and Bulgaria were promised the Banat and Yugoslav Macedonia respectively and the Romanian army was asked not to take part, holding its position at the countries' border. Internal conflict in Hungary over the invasion plans between the army and Teleki led to the Prime Minister's suicide that same evening. Also on 3 April, Edmund Veesenmayer, representing the Dienststelle Ribbentrop, arrived in Zagreb {{in preparation for a}} regime change. Croatian pilot Vladimir Kren, a captain in the Royal Yugoslav Air Force, defected to the Germans on 3 April taking with him valuable information about the country's air defenses.|$|E
60|$|Yet {{in spite}} of this ebullition, which had greatly exasperated Dr. May, there was every {{probability}} that Henry's consent might be wrung out or dispensed with, and <b>plans</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> were being arranged at the tea-table, when a new obstacle {{in the shape of a}} note from Leonard himself.|$|R

5|$|On {{the evening}} of 1October Valckenier {{received}} reports that a crowd of a thousand Chinese had gathered outside the gate, angered by his statements at the emergency meeting five days earlier. This report was received incredulously by Valckenier and the council. However, after {{the murder of a}} Balinese sergeant by the Chinese outside the walls, the council decided to take extraordinary measures and reinforce the guard. Two groups of 50 Europeans and some native porters were sent to outposts on the south and east sides of the city, and a <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> was formulated.|$|E
5|$|The German <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> {{required}} that Army Group B would advance and {{draw in the}} Allied First Army Group into central Belgium, while Army Group A conducted the surprise assault through the Ardennes. Belgium was {{to act as a}} secondary front with regard to importance. Army Group B was given only limited numbers of armoured and mobile units while {{the vast majority of the}} Army Group comprised infantry divisions. After the English Channel was reached, all Panzer division units and most motorised infantry were removed from Army Group B and given to Army Group A, to strengthen the German lines of communication and to prevent an Allied breakout.|$|E
5|$|The German <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> was {{influenced}} by their army's experiences during the Battle of France. Their strategy {{was to create a}} diversion through the campaign in Albania, thus stripping the Hellenic Army of manpower for the defence of their Yugoslavian and Bulgarian borders. By driving armoured wedges through the weakest links of the defence chain, penetrating Allied territory would not require substantial armour behind an infantry advance. Once Southern Yugoslavia was overrun by German armour, the Metaxas Line could be outflanked by highly mobile forces thrusting southward from Yugoslavia. Thus, possession of Monastir and the Axios valley leading to Thessaloniki became essential for such an outflanking maneuver.|$|E

5|$|The Yugoslav coup d'état led to {{a sudden}} change in the <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> and confronted the Twelfth Army {{with a number of}} {{difficult}} problems. According to the 28 March Directive No. 25, the Twelfth Army was to create a mobile task force to attack via Niš toward Belgrade. With only nine days left before their final deployment, every hour became valuable and each fresh assembly of troops took time to mobilise. By the evening of 5 April, the forces intended to enter southern Yugoslavia and Greece had been assembled.|$|E
5|$|The {{four hours}} passed with no reply, and Salvori began formulating his <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> against Tripoli. Though the Sardinian {{commander}} had initially wished {{to use his}} squadron's frigates in {{the assault on the}} city, the seas were too rough to ensure their safety close to shore, so he instead made plans to attack Tripoli using several boats from his squadron's vessels. Sivori placed 260 men in ten boats separated into three divisions under the command of Commercios Lieutenant Giorgio Mamelli. One division would attack the Tripolitanian brig, another the schooners, and the third group of boats would assault the city's dockyard and customs house to ensure no reinforcements could enter the harbor.|$|E
5|$|The <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> {{was for the}} British raiding {{force to}} sink two {{obsolete}} cruisers in the canal mouth at Ostend and three at Zeebrugge, thus preventing raiding ships leaving Bruges. The Ostend canal was the smaller and narrower of the two channels giving access to Bruges and so was considered a secondary target behind the Zeebrugge Raid. Consequently, fewer resources were provided to the force assaulting Ostend. While the attack at Zeebrugge garnered some limited success, the assault on Ostend was a complete failure. The German marines who defended the port had taken careful preparations and drove the British assault ships astray, forcing the abortion of the operation at the final stage.|$|E

5|$|Though the location, <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack,</b> {{and timing}} were {{determined}} by Hitler, he blamed the defeat on his General Staff. Unlike Stalin, who gave his commanding generals the liberty to make important command decisions, Hitler's interference in German military matters progressively increased while {{his attention to the}} political aspects of the war decreased. The opposite was true for Stalin; throughout the Kursk campaign, he trusted the judgment of his commanders, and as their decisions led to battlefield success it increased his trust in their military judgment. Stalin stepped back from operational planning, only rarely overruling military decisions, resulting in the Red Army gaining more freedom of action {{during the course of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|With {{no time to}} make {{a coordinated}} <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> for the whole army, Khalid decided to storm the East Gate himself. He, Qa'qa ibn Amr, and Mazur ibn Adi climbed the wall hand-by-hand {{from the side of the}} gate. This part of the wall was the strongest, no guard was {{stationed}} at the top. They secured ropes to the wall and dropped them to 100 selected soldiers waiting at the base. Leaving a few men to assist the climbers, Khalid descended into the city, killing the guards at the inside of the East Gate. Khalid and Qa'qa flung the gate open and the remainder of Khalid's men entered the city. An intense battle ensued.|$|E
5|$|After the British {{force had}} {{surveyed}} the Danish positions around Copenhagen, a council of war was held between Parker, his {{second in command}} Vice-Admiral Horatio Nelson, and the other British captains. Riou was among those present. Riou had worked closely with Nelson and Captain Thomas Foley in the lead up to the attack, and Nelson duly appointed him commander of the frigates and smaller vessels, with the instruction to deploy his ships to support the main fleet. As the battle began, several of Nelson's ships ran aground on shoals in the harbour, and a new <b>plan</b> <b>of</b> <b>attack</b> had to be improvised. As Nelson's ships of the line engaged their Danish counterparts, Riou took his frigates in to harass the Tre Kroner forts and blockships. Despite being heavily outmatched and dangerously exposed, they exchanged fire for several hours. The ships suffered heavy casualties; Riou was hit on {{the head by a}} splinter.|$|E
