More holistic tools and methods {{are required to}} support the integrated planning and management of fresh water resources at the river basin level. This paper compares an index-based cost-effectiveness analysis (IBCEA) with a least-cost river basin optimization model (LCRBOM).

The IBCEA is a common approach to select <b>programmes</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> {{in the implementation of}} the EU Water Framework Directive.

The performances <b>of</b> the <b>programmes</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> selected by the two methods are compared for the same annual equivalent cost.

40|$|International audienceManaging water {{scarcity}} {{is a major}} challenge for regions all over the world. In the European Union, robust methodologies are needed to establish effective <b>programmes</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> aimed at achieving the "good status" of water bodies according to the Water Framework Directive (WFD). These programmes often target the current gap between the actual status of water bodies and the "good" status without accounting for uncertainty in water demand. We develop a new methodological framework that enable to account for uncertainty in future water demand and design programmes {{in order to increase}} their likelihood of attaining the good quantitative status. The foresight approach enables to construct and quantify future water demand scenarios hand-in-hand with stakeholders during workshops. They consist in identifying drivers, debating pre-constructed scenarios, reconstructing scenarios and estimating water demand. The impact of the co-constructed scenarios is simulated with a resource-demand balance model for all water resources and a cost-effectiveness analysis makes it possible to construct programmes that target the estimated future water deficits at least cost. The methodology is illustrated with an application to Reunion Island (Indian Ocean, France) considering agriculture (Ag) and urban water (Uw) demand. Three combinations of sector scenarios (Uw, Ag) were produced and coherence was eventually ensured by fitting the land use parameter. This solution can accommodate case studies faced with a binding land constraint for housing and agriculture. As each scenario implies significantly different <b>programmes</b> <b>of</b> <b>measure</b> in terms <b>of</b> intensity and spatial distribution, results demonstrate the importance of taking uncertainty on water demand into account...|$|R

40|$|The Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC) (WFD) {{establishes}} {{a suite of}} environmental objectives for groundwater. In implementing the Directive and producing the first River Basin Management Plans, Member States have had to identify whether the these objectives are being met. If this assessment has shown that {{one or more of}} the objectives for groundwater is not being met, or is at risk <b>of</b> being failed, <b>programmes</b> <b>of</b> <b>measures</b> must be implemented to ensure that all relevant environmental objectives are met within six years – the publication date of the next River Basin Management Plan (22 nd December, 2015). In reality, especially for groundwater, achieving all the relevant objectives in such a short timescale may not be possible or practical. The WFD recognises this and allows for an extension of the deadline (beyond 2015) for the purposes of a phased achievement of the environmental objectives. This is provided that there is no further deterioration in status (Article 4. 4). Any such extension is limited to a maximum of two further river basin cycles (12 years) except where natural conditions mean that objectives can still not be achieved. A further provision is made for the situation where a water body is so badly affected by human activity or where natural conditions mean that achievement of the objectives(s) would be infeasible or disproportionally expensive. In these cases less stringent objectives (relative to those defined in Article 4. 1) can be set, provided that there is the least possible deviation from good status conditions. Where extended deadlines or less stringent objectives have been proposed, Member States must provide an explanation and justification in the River Basin Management Plan.
