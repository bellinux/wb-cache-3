He was {{accompanied}} by his Hungarian supporters and Elizabeth was unable to raise an army against him or <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> from convoking a diet, in which he obtained an overwhelming support.

However, no one had glimpsed the murderer's face, and no one selected Williams from an identity parade. Power was immediately released.|$|E

Several cases where BZP individually or combined with alcohol or other medicines or illicit drugs resulting in complications exist. One such example is the well publicised case {{of a combination of}} BZP and MDMA by a 23-year-old from Greymouth, New Zealand. Ben Rodham, a DJ, ingested a combination of BZP and MDMA in February 2007, which nearly resulted in his death.

5|$|Coffin {{grew up on}} {{the family}} farm in North Carolina. He was educated at home and {{received}} little, if any, formal education.

5|$|Eight {{different}} receivers {{caught at}} least one pass, with Dexton Fields leading all receivers in the game with sevencatches for 101yards. Both totals were the highest marks recorded in the game by either team. Fields was also the recipient of a play that tied for the longest pass play of the game, a 37-yard toss from Reesing halfway through the third quarter. Cornerback and game MVP Aqib Talib came into the game as a receiver several times, but because his appearance in the game was such an unusual occurrence, the Virginia Tech defense was able {{to zero in on}} him and <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> from catching the ball.|$|E
5|$|Graff and {{the other}} leaders of the school covertly work to isolate Ender from his fellow {{recruits}} and <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> from growing too comfortable in his environment. The cadets participate in competitive war simulations in zero gravity, where Ender quickly masters the game and dominates his opponents. The school continually tries to break Ender down, first promoting him to command a new army composed of raw recruits, then pitting him against multiple armies at once, but Ender's success continues. The jealous commander of the army with whom Ender first served, Bonzo Madrid, compels him to fight outside the simulation, and Ender unintentionally kills him, once again seeking to preemptively prevent all future struggles with Bonzo.|$|E
5|$|Harley's co-creator, Paul Dini, {{describes}} {{their relationship}} as Harley being someone {{who makes the}} Joker feel better about himself, and who can do the work {{that he does not}} want to do himself. In the 1999 one-shot comic Batman: Harley Quinn, the Joker decides to kill Harley, after admitting that he does care for her, that their relationship is romantic, and that these feelings <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> from fulfilling his purpose. Removing the traditional male-female relationship, such as in the Batman: Thrillkiller storyline where the Joker (Bianca Steeplechase) is a female and involved in a lesbian relationship with Harley, their relationship lacks any aspects of violence or subjugation.|$|E

He was drafted in the 21st round of the 2002 Major League Baseball Draft by the San Francisco Giants. The Giants gave him a $955,000 bonus to <b>prevent</b> <b>him</b> from attending Oregon State University. The bonus was the highest back then for a non-first-round player, cued on by the organization's approaching signing deadline. The Giants could afford to pay a 21st-round pick that much because their higher picks had signed quickly for routine bonuses.|$|E
