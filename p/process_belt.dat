African Journal of Business Management Vol. 5 (28), pp. 11413 - 11424, 16 November, 2011 Different {{capability}} measuring {{techniques have}} been proposed and are being used in industry today. Each one gives a certain portion of the quality picture, leaving out some equally important details about the process. There is no single index which addresses the whole quality of a production process on its own, hence the {{need to look at}} all the indices holistically. Each index has its own merits and demerits. In this paper, we consider a case study of a company which manufactures belts, and has been using only one index, Cpk. Its quality checks were indicating that the process was under control. On the other hand, customers have been complaining that the belts they are manufacturing are not strong and tend to breaking easily. This paper concentrates on addressing the production <b>process</b> of <b>belts</b> by looking at different capability indices {{and come up with a}} method or algorithm that addresses this problem holistically.

Unless the feed is well mixed from a digester, {{the use of}} belt filters will be more costly when processing a feed with varying solids content as this requires more operator attention, raising staffing costs.

Venus displays two geometrical patterns of concentrated lithospheric extension: quasi-circular coronae and broad rises with linear rift zones; both are sites of significant volcanism. No long, large-offset strike-slip faults have been observed, although limited local horizontal shear is accommodated across many zones of crustal shortening. In general, tectonic features on Venus are unlike those in Earth's oceanic regions in that strain typically is distributed across broad zones that are one to a few hundred kilometers wide, and separated by stronger and less deformed blocks hundreds of kilometers in width, as in actively deforming continental regions on Earth...|$|R

Energetic electrons and ions are also subjected to pitch-angle and energy diffusion when interact with plasma waves in the radiation belts. Important wave modes include whistler mode chorus waves, plasmaspheric hiss, electromagnetic ion cyclotron waves, and magnetosonic waves.

40|$|Abstract—For most interpreters {{working on}} {{two-dimensional}} data or maps, a line-drawing process to depict linear and curvilinear features is often needed. One {{of the main}} diculties in simulating human insight in such a process by computer is that the human eye is able to consider data trends within a wide range on the map. A program based on the profile recognition and polygon-breaking algorithms is introduced in this paper to extract automatically ridge and valley axes. The two algorithms are capable of simulating human performance in the line-drawing process over a range of conditions. The program starts from a profile recognition process which takes all the points close to the possible axes as targets and connects them as a belt of closed polygons. Then, a polygon-breaking <b>process</b> resolves the <b>belt</b> into a continuous line, and a smoothing process further makes the line as smooth as one depicted manually.
