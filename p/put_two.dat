5|$|The Phillies scored {{first for}} the second game {{in a row in}} the second inning; Raúl Ibañez hit a ground rule double, and a Matt Stairs single off of A. J. Burnett drove him in. It was the only run allowed by the New York {{pitching}} staff. Mark Teixeira tied the game with a solo home run in the fourth inning, and Hideki Matsui broke the tie in the sixth with another, giving the Yankees their first lead. Chan Ho Park allowed an RBI single to Jorge Posada after Martínez <b>put</b> <b>two</b> baserunners on {{in the top of the}} seventh. Burnett departed after seven innings, replaced by Mariano Rivera in the eighth. The Phillies <b>put</b> <b>two</b> runners on with a walk to Jimmy Rollins and a single by Shane Victorino with one out in the eighth. However, Chase Utley grounded into an inning-ending double play ending on a close play at first base that drew controversy. Rivera completed the ninth inning for his 38th postseason save.|$|E
5|$|A {{new game}} was also {{introduced}} {{on the roof}} of BBC Television Centre called Sacrifice Your Family which Cawood hosted that <b>put</b> <b>two</b> families against each other in various games. This was later renamed Sacrifice Your Friends in 2001. Other features included Talk To The Hand where a celebrity had to answer questions from viewers with the option to only be able to pass one of the questions {{with the use of the}} hand and L Most Wanted where viewers could win prizes if they could spot a three digit number clue placed somewhere throughout the show which was the code to the cage containing the prizes. The winner was the one who guessed the correct order out of a possible six combinations.|$|E
5|$|Orders were {{immediately}} issued (at 06:00) to start new preparations. Under the new ones, two companies from the 51st Battalion were to base themselves in Hatzor and Barqa, respectively. The 52nd Battalion was to prepare at Camp Bilu (next to Kfar Bilu). The 53rd Battalion was to <b>put</b> <b>two</b> companies in Be'er Tuvia, two platoons in Negba, {{and one in}} Kfar Warburg. Two companies from the 54th were to be placed at Tel Nof (Eqron Airbase). Six platoons from the 55th were to be based between al-Maghar and al-Qubayba. The 8th Brigade was to be based between Gat, Gal On and Nitzanim, as well as remaining in the Gedera–Bashit area. A battalion was also temporarily transferred from Kiryati to Givati (now {{referred to as the}} 56th), preparing in Abu Shusha and Hulda. The 57th Battalion (Irgun) was to be placed in Zarnuqa. Of the Negev Brigade, two companies would be in Camp Julis and one in Camp Beit Daras. Finally, the artillery forces were to keep their former positions, as well as taking new ones in Bitzaron.|$|E

5|$|The battle {{continued}} {{during the}} morning; however, by 12:00 the North Koreans finally withdrew, abandoning {{the bridge to}} the Australians. Meanwhile, Coad <b>put</b> <b>two</b> companies from the Argylls across the Taeryong River on tanks at the Pakchon ford, and they met only slight opposition. The Middlesex then passed through them, moving south-west onto the main {{road in front of}} 3 RAR where they knocked out a North Korean tank which was blocking their advance. By nightfall they had linked up with the Australians, consolidating their positions and securing a safe crossing {{for the remainder of the}} brigade, including the wheeled vehicles which followed that evening. North Korean patrols attempted to harass the British and Australian outposts; however, despite their perimeter being shelled it proved to be a relatively quiet night for the 27th British Commonwealth Brigade.|$|E
5|$|William {{remained}} in England after his coronation {{and tried to}} reconcile the native magnates. The remaining earls– Edwin (of Mercia), Morcar (of Northumbria), and Waltheof (of Northampton)– were confirmed in their lands and titles. Waltheof was married to William's niece Judith, daughter of Adelaide, and a marriage between Edwin and one of William's daughters was proposed. Edgar the Ætheling also {{appears to have been}} given lands. Ecclesiastical offices continued to be held by the same bishops as before the invasion, including the uncanonical Stigand. But the families of Harold and his brothers did lose their lands, as did some others who had fought against William at Hastings. By March, William was secure enough to return to Normandy, but he took with him Stigand, Morcar, Edwin, Edgar, and Waltheof. He left his half-brother Odo, the Bishop of Bayeux, in charge of England along with another influential supporter, William fitzOsbern, the son of his former guardian. Both men were also named to earldoms– fitzOsbern to Hereford (or Wessex) and Odo to Kent. Although he <b>put</b> <b>two</b> Normans in overall charge, he retained many of the native English sheriffs. Once in Normandy the new English king went to Rouen and the Abbey of Fecamp, and then attended the consecration of new churches at two Norman monasteries.|$|E

Haas, who began his career as a solo timpanist in 1980, is notable for {{performing}} music from many genres including jazz, rock, and classical. He released an album with a rather unconventional jazz band called Johnny H. and the Prisoners of Swing. Glass's Concerto Fantasy, commissioned by Haas, <b>put</b> <b>two</b> soloists in front of the orchestra, an atypical placement for the instruments. Haas also commissioned Susman's Floating Falling for timpani and cello.|$|E
25|$|The British {{immediately}} fitted out James Madison for {{the protection}} of the fleet. They <b>put</b> <b>two</b> officers and 40 men on board, drawn from Barbadoes and her existing crew. On 26 August a hurricane came up that scattered the vessels of the convoy. It also totally dis-masted Barbadoes and sprung Polyphemuss main and foremasts. On 3 September an American privateer schooner of 14 guns started shadowing James Madison and the vessels she was escorting. During the subsequent four days the privateer stayed close enough to exchange occasional shots with James Madison, but did not succeed in capturing anything. On 3 October Polyphemus and James Madison arrived separately at Portsmouth.|$|E
25|$|As the Space Race {{between the}} two superpowers reached its climax with the conquest of the Moon, Mao Zedong and Zhou Enlai decided on July 14, 1967 that the PRC should not be left behind, and {{therefore}} initiated China's own crewed space program. The top-secret Project 714 aimed to <b>put</b> <b>two</b> people into space by 1973 with the Shuguang spacecraft. Nineteen PLAAF pilots were selected for this goal on March 1971. The Shuguang-1 spacecraft to be launched with the CZ-2A rocket was designed to carry a crew of two. The program was officially cancelled on May 13, 1972 for economic reasons, though the internal politics of the Cultural Revolution likely motivated the closure.|$|E

But the July 20 agreement began to fall apart. IBEW Local 38 reneged on its agreement to <b>put</b> <b>two</b> black apprentices on the job. Sheet Metal Workers Local 65 had admitted to membership the lone African American to apply, but the contractor refused to hire him for fear of violating union seniority rules. At an emergency meeting called on July 25 by Locher, IBEW local 38 backed down and agreed to process two African American applications for apprenticeships on July 26 (effectively affirming the agreement reached July 20). The local also agreed to employ at least two black apprentices at job sites in the city thereafter.|$|E
25|$|On {{the road}} {{for the first of}} several swings through Canada this season on November 15, Arvidsson and Neal <b>put</b> <b>two</b> goals on the board for the Predators, but Marek Mazanec – {{starting}} in place of Rinne, who sat out with a lower back injury – allowed six goals on 32 shots, including a hat-trick by James van Riemsdyk, and the Predators lost 6–2 to the Maple Leafs. Two nights later in Ottawa, the Predators rebounded from their first regulation loss of the month with a 5–1 victory over the Senators. Neal scored in his sixth straight game during the contest, setting a career-high and tying the franchise record for longest goal streak. Concluding their road swing in St. Louis, the Predators scored one goal from Ribeiro in a 3–1 loss to the Blues.|$|E
25|$|Whatever the {{reasoning}} behind the decision was, McNamara called upon his closer Schiraldi {{in the bottom of}} the eighth inning for a potential two-inning save. Lee Mazzilli, pinch hitting for Jesse Orosco, who recorded the final out of the eighth, led off the inning with a single. Lenny Dykstra then reached on an attempted sacrifice to <b>put</b> <b>two</b> runners on. Wally Backman followed with another bunt to move Mazzilli and Dykstra into scoring position, and Schiraldi intentionally walked Keith Hernandez to load the bases for Gary Carter. Schiraldi ran up a 3-0 count on Carter, but Carter swung at the next pitch and flied to left, deep enough to score Mazzilli and tie the game. With Dykstra now on third, Darryl Strawberry stood in with a chance to drive in the go-ahead run. Instead, Strawberry flied out to end the inning.|$|E
