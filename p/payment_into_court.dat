50|$|Unless he cancels the contract, or obtains {{an order}} {{compelling}} the creditor {{to accept his}} performance, {{it is not clear}} how the debtor can discharge his debt without having to wait until the period of prescription has run, or until performance has become impossible. Consignation (<b>payment</b> <b>into</b> <b>court</b> with notice to the creditor) appears to have fallen into desuetude, and is in any event impossible or impracticable in many cases (as in the case where perishables are to be delivered). Whether the debtor may sell the goods for the account of the creditor is also uncertain.|$|E
50|$|The {{defendant}} {{may make}} an unconditional <b>payment</b> <b>into</b> the <b>court</b> with {{an admission of}} liability, {{in which case the}} matter then terminates. The plaintiff is only entitled to costs up to that point. The defendant is not a judgment debtor.|$|R
5000|$|Alternatively, the {{defendant}} {{may make a}} compromise offer of settlement without admission of liability or without prejudice. If the plaintiff rejects this, {{the defendant}} can pay amount <b>into</b> the <b>court</b> in [...] "final settlement." [...] If the plaintiff does not accept payment, this cannot be disclosed to the court {{until the end of}} the trial. If judgment is for less than the amount paid in, the court will order payment to the plaintiff in terms of the award. If judgment is for the defendant, not the plaintiff, the plaintiff must make <b>payment</b> <b>into</b> the <b>court</b> of the defendant's costs since payment.|$|R
50|$|The Court of Exchequer Chamber {{held that}} where a party agrees to grant {{a good and}} valid lease, having full {{knowledge}} {{that he has no}} title, the plaintiff, in an action for the breach of such agreement, may recover, beyond his expenses, damages resulting from the loss of his bargain; and the defendant cannot, under a plea of <b>payment</b> of money <b>into</b> <b>court,</b> give evidence that the plaintiff was aware of the defect of title. Parke B's judgment went as follows.|$|R
50|$|The House of Lords {{felt that}} the point {{relating}} to estoppel by convention (i.e. that the parties had contemplated such further action might be brought in the earlier settlement agreement) was {{tied up in the}} issue of abuse of process. They noted that the litigation between Mr Johnson and Gore Wood had been ongoing for nearly four and half years before the defendant firm of solicitors sought to strike out the claims on this basis, which was reflective of the parties common understanding that those claims might be pursued, and during that time pleadings had been considerably advanced and they had even made a <b>payment</b> <b>into</b> <b>court.</b> Their Lordships determined that the key issues was whether (i) the settlement of WWH's action proceeded on the basis of an underlying assumption that Mr Johnson would be bringing further claims, and (ii) whether it would be unfair or unjust to now allow Gore Wood to go back on that assumption. Their Lordships held that both grounds were made out.|$|E
40|$|This chapter {{surveys the}} effects of legal fee {{shifting}} {{on a variety of}} decisions arising before and during the litigation process. Section 2 provides a brief survey of the practical situations in which legal fee shifting does and does not arise. Section 3 analyzes {{the effects of}} indemnification on the incentives to expend resources in litigated cases. Section 4 examines how indemnification influences the decisions to bring and to defend against suit, and Section 5 assesses its effects on the choice between settlement and trial. Section 6 addresses the interaction between the allocation of legal fees and the parties ’ incentives for efficient primary behavior. Section 7 considers two important variants on simple indemnification: rules that shift costs based on the parties ’ settlement negotiations (such as US Federal Rule 68 and the English practice of <b>payment</b> <b>into</b> <b>court),</b> and rules that shift costs based on the margin of victory (such as US Federal Rule 11 and the common law tort of malicious prosecution). Section 8 reviews the brief but instructive empirical literature on legal cost shifting, and Section 9 summarizes the discussion and offers conclusions. JEL classification: K 40, K 4...|$|E
