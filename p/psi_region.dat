In this paper, we propose a novel system for automatically protecting the privacy in CGVs. The proposed system tackles the problem of determining <b>PSI</b> <b>regions</b> by using an intended human ob-ject detector that detects human objects which the camera person wanted to capture to achieve his/her capture inten-tion.

Analysis of the resulting data reveals no evidence for any globin-related sequences in this region. The region does, however, contain several stretches of poly (dA-dT).

Retroviral vectors pKD-HTTK and pKD-HTpTK containing direct repeats composed of segments of the herpes simplex virus type 1 thymidine kinase (HTK) gene were constructed; in pKD-HTpTK, the direct repeat flanked the MLV packaging signal. The generation of hypoxanthine-aminopterin-thymidine-resistant colonies after one cycle of retroviral replication demonstrated functional reconstitution of the HTK gene. Quantitative Southern analysis indicated that direct repeat deletions occurred in 57 and 91 % of the KD-HTTK and KD-HTpTK proviruses, respectively. These results demonstrate that (i) deletion of direct repeats occurs at similar high frequencies in SNV and MLV vectors, (ii) MLV psi can be efficiently deleted by using direct repeats, (iii) suicide genes can be functionally reconstituted during reverse transcription, and (iv) the <b>psi</b> <b>region</b> may be a hot spot for reverse transcriptase template switching events...|$|E

Such RNAs can be reverse transcribed by endogenous polymerase and integrated into the genomes of newly infected cells (M. Linial, Cell 49 : 93 - 102, 1987). Genomic RNA is not packaged because the packaging (<b>psi)</b> <b>region</b> of the provirus is deleted. The provirus also lacks the negative-strand primer binding site, which prevents efficient reverse transcription of randomly packaged genomic RNA. Previous work from our laboratory suggested that the trans-acting defect which allows packaging of cellular mRNA mapped to the provirus but did not map to the nucleocapsid region of the gag gene (D.

40|$|A {{number of}} lentiviral vector {{systems have been}} {{developed}} for gene delivery and therapy by eliminating and/or modifying viral genetic elements. However, all lentiviral vector systems derived from HIV- 1 must have a viral packaging signal sequence, Psi (Y), which is placed downstream of 59 long terminal repeat in a transgene plasmid to effectively package and deliver transgene mRNA. In this study, we examined feasible regions or sequences around Psi that could be manipulated to further modify the packaging sequence. Surprisingly, we found that the sequences immediately upstream of the Psi are highly refractory to any modification and resulted in transgene vectors with very poor gene transduction efficiency. Analysis around the <b>Psi</b> <b>region</b> revealed that there are a few sites {{that can be used for}} manipulation of the Psi sequence without disturbing the virus production as well as the efficiency of transgene RNA packaging and gene transduction. By exploiting this new vector system, we investigated the requirement of each of four individual stem-loops of the Psi sequence by deletion mapping analysis and found that all stem-loops, including the SL 4 region, are needed for efficient transgene RNA packaging and gene delivery. These results suggest a possible frame of the lentiviral vector that might be useful for further modifying the region/sequence around the packaging sequence as well as directly on the Psi sequence without destroying transduction efficiency...|$|E

Photosystem I (PSI) {{is one of the}} two reaction centers of oxygenic photosynthesis. PSI is a multiheteromeric membrane-protein complex that catalyzes light-driven electron transfer from plastocyanin or cytochrome c 6 to ferredoxin. The PsaA and PsaB subunits form the heterodimeric core that harbors the primary electron donor P 700. On the oxidizing side of the PSI complex, plastocyanin or cytochrome c 6 donates electrons to the P 700 reaction center. The objective of this dissertation is to identify elements of molecular recognition on the oxidizing side of PSI;To identify <b>PSI</b> <b>regions</b> that are exposed on the luminal oxidizing side, the topography of the PSI complex from Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 was examined by biochemical analyses. These studies indicated that the H and J luminal loops of the core proteins were the most logical candidates for hydrophobic interactions with the donor proteins. To test this hypothesis, site-directed mutations were generated in these loops. Biochemical characteristics of these mutants provided evidence for interactions between the electron donor proteins and a luminal surface helix in the J loop of the PsaB protein. Sections of the H loop of PsaB {{plays an important role in}} the structural integrity of the PsaB protein. The N-terminal lysine-rich region of PsaF in eukaryotic PSI complex has been proposed to provide a binding site for plastocyanin and cytochrome c 6 through electrostatic interactions. Chimeric PsaF proteins containing the lysine-rich region of spinach PsaF were produced in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803 cells through mutagenesis. Cross-linking and functional studies showed that the lysine-rich region of spinach PsaF protein is sufficient for binding of donor proteins, but not for the electron transfer within the intermolecular complex.

Fingerprint analysis and oligonucleotide mapping suggested that the sequence of the oligonucleotide containing 5 -methylcytidine is CpCpm 5 CpUpGp, which corresponds to the extra and T <b>psi</b> stem <b>regions</b> in the secondary structure of phenylalanine tRNA.

Based on the refined atomic coordinates of the tRNAphe in the orthorhombic crystal, on the recent advances in the distance dependence of the ring-current magnetic field effects and on the adopted values for the isolated hydrogen-bonded NH resonances, a computed spectrum consisting of 23 protons was constructed. A quantitative comparison by computer was made between the computed spectrum and the spectrum simulated from the observed spectrum. These two spectra are closely similar but not identical. We suggest that the conformation of yeast tRNAphe in aqueous solution is closely similar but not identical to that found in the crystal, especially in the T <b>psi</b> C <b>region</b> and D region.

Four putative stem-loop structures between the 5 ' splice donor site and the gag initiation codon have been examined: stem structure A, corresponding to M-MuLV viral nucleotides 211 to 224; stem-loop B, nucleotides 278 to 303; stem-loop C, nucleotides 310 to 352; and stem-loop D, nucleotides 355 to 374. By measuring infectivities, encapsidation and splicing efficiencies, and endogenous reverse transcription levels of motif A, B, C, and D deletion mutants, we identified mutations which affect replication at the encapsidation step. In particular, deletion of all four motifs in a single mutant eliminated encapsidation of viral RNA, while deletion of individual elements moderately reduced the encapsidation efficiencies. Through analysis of different deletion combinations, we found that deletion of the first two motifs (A plus B) reduced both encapsidation and reverse transcription efficiencies, while deletion of the 3 ' motifs (C plus D) eliminated encapsidation. Interestingly, the C and D motifs both contain a GACG loop sequence and are highly conserved among murine type C retroviruses. Our results indicate that M-MuLV motifs C and D are necessary for efficient encapsidation, and the presence of {{at least one of these}} two stem-loops is crucial to encapsidation and virus replication...|$|E

To gain better understanding of this process, we analyzed the interactions between Pr 55 (Gag) and a large panel of viral RNA (vRNA) fragments encompassing the main packaging signal (Psi) and its flanking regions by fluorescence spectroscopy. We showed that the gRNA harbors a high affinity binding site which is absent from svRNA species, suggesting that this site might be crucial for selecting the HIV- 1 genome. Our stoichiometry analysis of protein/RNA complexes revealed that few copies of Pr 55 (Gag) specifically associate with the 52 ̆ 7 region of the gRNA. Besides, we found that gRNA dimerization significantly impacts Pr 55 (Gag) binding, and we confirmed that the internal loop of stem-loop 1 (SL 1) in Psi is crucial for specific interaction with Pr 55 (Gag). Our analysis of gRNA fragments of different length supports {{the existence of a}} long-range tertiary interaction involving sequences upstream and downstream of the <b>Psi</b> <b>region.</b> This long-range interaction might promote optimal exposure of SL 1 for efficient Pr 55 (Gag) recognition.

Comparison of homologous and cross reactive Gag-specific T-cell responses between HIV- 1 and HIV- 2 infected patients for their gag peptides revealed that homologous Gag-specific T-cell responses were broader and stronger in HIV- 2 infected patients as compared to HIV- 1. In contrast cross reactive T-cell response was narrower and weaker in HIV- 2 as compared to HIV- 1 infected patients. This cross reactive response indicated HIV- 1 /HIV- 2 Gag sequence similarities. Thus HIV- 2 -specific T-cell responses control HIV- 2 replication restraining viral diversification (Jennes et al. 2008). The capsid region of Gag may be better processed and presented on MHC in contrast to other viral proteins moreover antigens from this region, might be more exposed to be presented as capsid, is generally expressed in higher levels (Chertova et al. 2006). A further examination reported another strategy for HIV- 2 targeting. Genomic RNA dimerisation is facilitated by a sequence positioned within the <b>Psi</b> <b>region</b> and that dimerisation may certainly be linked to viral packaging thus dimerisation defective viruses will be deficient in virion maturation and infectivity, possibly presenting new targets for HIV- 2 replication inhibition (L'Hernault et al. 2007).|$|E

The 120 -bp 5 S rRNA-like <b>region</b> of <b>Psi</b> 63 is interrupted by a 1. 9 -kb insertion that has characteristics of sequences that have been modified by repeat-induced point mutation (RIP). We found sequences related to this insertion in wild-type strains of N. crassa and other Neurospora species. Most showed evidence of RIP; but one, isolated from the N. crassa host of Psi 63, showed no evidence of RIP. A deletion from near the center of this sequence apparently rendered it incapable of participating in RIP with the related full-length copies. The Psi 63 insertion and the related sequences have features of transposons and are related to the Fot 1 class of fungal transposable elements.

Su(Hw) associates with over 500 non-gypsy genomic sites, the functions of which are largely unknown. Using a bioinformatics approach, we identified 37 putative Su(Hw) insulators (<b>pSIs)</b> that represent <b>regions</b> containing clustered matches to the gypsy insulator Su(Hw) consensus binding sequence.

It is reverse-transcribed, and its DNA copy, integrated into the host genome, constitutes a splice donor-associated retroelement. FL and SD' RNAs share a common 5 '-UTR that includes the packaging/dimerization signal (Psi). To investigate whether the mechanism of copackaging of these two RNAs involves RNA heterodimerization, we examined the spontaneous dimerization capacity of the two RNAs as large synthetic RNAs transcribed in vitro. We showed that SD' RNA not only formed homodimers with similar efficiency as the FL RNA, but that FL and SD' RNAs also formed FL/SD' heterodimers via Psi sequences. Comparison of the thermostabilities determined for these different dimeric species and competition experiments with Psi RNA fragments indicate the recruitment of similar dimer-linkage interactions within the <b>Psi</b> <b>region.</b> To validate these results, the dimeric state of the SD' RNA was analyzed in MLV particles. RNA capture assays performed with the FL RNA as bait revealed that SD', and not the host packageable U 6 or 7 SL RNAs, {{was associated with the}} FL RNA in virions. Heterodimerization of SD' RNA with FL RNA may argue for the recent concept of a nuclear dimerization at or near the site of transcription and raises the new hypothesis of RNA dimerization during splicing.

40|$|Abstract Background Retroviruses {{selectively}} encapsidate {{two copies}} of their genomic RNA, the Gag protein binding a specific RNA motif in the 5 ' UTR of the genome. In human immunodeficiency virus type 2 (HIV- 2), the principal packaging signal (Psi) is upstream of the major splice donor and hence is present on all the viral RNA species. Cotranslational capture of the full length genome ensures specificity. HIV- 2 RNA dimerisation is thought to occur at the dimer initiation site (DIS) located in stem-loop 1 (SL- 1), downstream of the main packaging determinant. However, the HIV- 2 packaging signal also contains a palindromic sequence (pal) involved in dimerisation. In this study, we analysed {{the role of the}} HIV- 2 packaging signal in genomic RNA dimerisation in vivo and its implication in viral replication. Results Using a series of deletion and substitution mutants in SL- 1 and the <b>Psi</b> <b>region,</b> we show that in fully infectious HIV- 2, genomic RNA dimerisation is mediated by the palindrome pal. Mutation of the DIS had no effect on dimerisation or viral infectivity, while mutations in the packaging signal severely reduce both processes as well as RNA encapsidation. Electron micrographs of the Psi-deleted virions revealed a significant reduction in the proportion of mature particles and an increase in that of particles containing multiple cores. Conclusion In addition to its role in RNA encapsidation, the HIV- 2 packaging signal contains a palindromic sequence that is critical for genomic RNA dimerisation. Encapsidation of a dimeric genome seems required for the production of infectious mature particles, and provides a promising therapeutic target. </p...|$|E

Although the power of interferometry was demon-strated, the conventional technique has not always been applicable in all operational scenarios. Over the last few years, however, a number of technical developments have emerged that provide a higher precision of motion rates, the extraction of specific motion histories, and precise targeting. This paper examines uses of differential SAR interferometry (DifSAR) for monitoring geohazards. Limitations of DifSAR will be discussed: lack of coherence, atmospheric refraction and targeting. It will be shown how some of these limitations can be overcome with per-sistent scatterer interferometry (PSI), which detects slow ground motion with annual rates of as little as a few millimetres, reconstructing a motion history based on the European Space Agency’s SAR image archive. The technique permits the estimation and removal of the atmos-pheric phase, achieving higher accuracies than DifSAR.
