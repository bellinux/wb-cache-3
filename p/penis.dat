5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Oryzomys couesi has a complex <b>penis,</b> with the baculum (<b>penis</b> bone) ending in three cartilaginous digits at its tip. The outer surface of the <b>penis</b> is mostly covered by small spines, {{but there is a}} broad band of nonspinous tissue. The papilla (nipple-like projection) on the dorsal (upper) side of the <b>penis</b> is covered with small spines, a character Oryzomys couesi shares only with Oligoryzomys and the marsh rice rat among oryzomyines examined. On the urethral process, located in the crater {{at the end of the}} <b>penis,</b> a fleshy process (the subapical lobule) is present; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except the marsh rice rat and Holochilus brasiliensis.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, the marsh rice rat and O.couesi have a complex <b>penis,</b> with the baculum (<b>penis</b> bone) displaying large protuberances at the sides. The outer surface of the <b>penis</b> is mostly covered by small spines, {{but there is a}} broad band of nonspinous tissue. The papilla (nipple-like projection) on the dorsal (upper) side of the <b>penis</b> is covered with small spines, a character these two species share only with Oligoryzomys among oryzomyines examined. On the urethral process, located in the crater {{at the end of the}} <b>penis,</b> a fleshy process (the subapical lobule) is present; it is absent in all other oryzomyines with studied penes except Holochilus brasiliensis. Both traits are recovered as synapomorphies of O.couesi plus the marsh rice rat in Weksler's analysis.|$|E
5|$|Males have a long, {{straight}} <b>penis</b> with a notch {{between the}} shaft and the narrow, egg-shaped glans <b>penis.</b> Near the top, the <b>penis</b> is haired, but {{the base is}} almost naked. In the baculum (<b>penis</b> bone), the shaft is long and narrow and slightly curved. The length of the <b>penis</b> and baculum distinguish P.raceyi from all comparably sized African and Malagasy vespertilionids. P.endoi, P.paterculus, and P.abramus have more similar bacula, but that of P.abramus is more curved, the shaft and the tip are more robust in P.paterculus, and the proximal (near) end is more robust in P.endoi. In males, <b>penis</b> length is 9.6 to 11.8mm (0.38 to 0.46in) and baculum length is 8.8 to 10.0mm (0.35 to 0.39in).|$|E

50|$|In 2008, Anthony Atala {{and colleagues}} at the Wake Forest Institute for Regenerative Medicine in North Carolina transplanted {{bioengineered}} <b>penises</b> onto 12 rabbits. All of them mated and four produced offspring. It was a test for a concept {{he had been working}} on since 1992, with the aim of making human <b>penises</b> for transplant. He has produced test versions of bioengineered human <b>penises,</b> but none of them are suitable for transplantation yet.|$|R

5|$|Upon {{anatomical}} study, the <b>penis</b> can {{be described}} as a clitoris that has been mostly pulled out of the body and grafted on top of a significantly smaller piece of spongiosum containing the urethra. With regard to nerve endings, the human clitoris's estimated 8,000 or more (for its glans or clitoral body as a whole) is commonly cited as being twice as many as the nerve endings found in the human <b>penis</b> (for its glans or body as a whole), and as more than any other part of the human body. These reports sometimes conflict with other sources on clitoral anatomy or those concerning the nerve endings in the human <b>penis.</b> For example, while some sources estimate that the human <b>penis</b> has 4,000 nerve endings, other sources state that the glans or the entire penile structure have the same amount of nerve endings as the clitoral glans, or discuss whether the uncircumcised <b>penis</b> has thousands more than the circumcised <b>penis</b> or is generally more sensitive.|$|E
5|$|As is {{characteristic}} of Sigmodontinae, Transandinomys talamancae has a complex <b>penis,</b> with the distal (far) end of the baculum (<b>penis</b> bone) ending in a structure consisting of three digits. As in most oryzomyines, the central digit {{is larger than the}} two at the sides. The outer surface of the <b>penis</b> is mostly covered by small spines, but there is a broad band of nonspinous tissue.|$|E
5|$|In males, the semen {{is forming}} in the testis. The sperm {{structure}} of Theodoxus fluviatilis was examined by Gustaf Retzius. Then semen travels through the prostate, where it mixes with prostatic fluid. Finally {{it goes through}} the vas deferens to the <b>penis.</b> The <b>penis</b> {{is located on the}} inner side of the right tentacle.|$|E

50|$|In 2009, {{researchers}} Chen, Eberli, Yoo and Atala {{have produced}} bioengineered <b>penises</b> and implanted them on rabbits. The animals {{were able to}} obtain erection and copulate, with 10 of 12 rabbits achieving ejaculation. This study shows {{that in the future}} it could be possible to produce artificial <b>penises</b> for replacement surgeries or phalloplasties.|$|R

5|$|Motivations for {{clitoral}} modification and mutilation vary. Those taking hormones {{or other}} medications {{as part of}} female-to-male transition usually experience dramatic clitoral growth; individual desires and the difficulties of phalloplasty (construction of a <b>penis)</b> often result in the retention of the original genitalia with the enlarged clitoris as a <b>penis</b> analogue (metoidioplasty). However, the clitoris cannot reach {{the size of the}} <b>penis</b> through hormones. A surgery to add function to the clitoris, such as metoidioplasty, is an alternative to phalloplasty that permits retention of sexual sensation in the clitoris.|$|E
5|$|<b>Penis</b> pumps induce erections {{without the}} need for drugs or {{invasive}} treatments. To use a pump, the man inserts his <b>penis</b> into a cylinder, then pumps it to create a vacuum which draws blood into the <b>penis,</b> making it erect. He then slides a ring from the outside of the cylinder onto the base of the <b>penis</b> to hold the blood in and maintain the erection. A man who is able to get an erection but has trouble maintaining it for long enough can use a ring by itself. The ring cannot be left on for more than 30 minutes and cannot be used {{at the same time as}} anticoagulant medications.|$|E
5|$|In Bruce Bagemihl's {{survey of}} The Zoological Record (1978–1997)– which {{contains}} {{over a million}} documents from over 6,000 scientific journals– 539 articles focusing on the <b>penis</b> were found, while 7 were found focusing on the clitoris. In 2000, researchers Shirley Ogletree and Harvey Ginsberg concluded {{that there is a}} general neglect of the word clitoris in common vernacular. They looked at the terms used to describe genitalia in the PsycINFO database from 1887 to 2000 and found that <b>penis</b> was used in 1,482 sources, vagina in 409, while clitoris was only mentioned in 83. They additionally analyzed 57 books listed in a computer database for sex instruction. In the majority of the books, <b>penis</b> was the most commonly discussed body part– mentioned more than clitoris, vagina, and uterus put together. They last investigated terminology used by college students, ranging from Euro-American (76%/76%), Hispanic (18%/14%), and African American (4%/7%), regarding the students' beliefs about sexuality and knowledge on the subject. The students were overwhelmingly educated to believe that the vagina is the female counterpart of the <b>penis.</b> The authors found that the students' belief that the inner portion of the vagina is the most sexually sensitive part of the female body correlated with negative attitudes toward masturbation and strong support for sexual myths.|$|E

5|$|Male {{and female}} guinea pigs {{do not differ}} in {{external}} appearance apart from general size. The position of the anus {{is very close to}} the genitals in both sexes. Female genitals are distinguished by a Y-shaped configuration formed from a vulvar flap, while the male genitals may look similar, with the <b>penis</b> and anus forming a like shape, the <b>penis</b> will protrude if pressure is applied to the surrounding hair. The male's testes may also be visible externally from scrotal swelling.|$|E
5|$|Most lionesses {{will have}} {{reproduced}} {{by the time}} they are four years of age. Lions do not mate at any specific time of year, and the females are polyestrous. As with other cats' penises, the male lion's <b>penis</b> has spines that point backward. During withdrawal of the <b>penis,</b> the spines rake the walls of the female's vagina, which may cause ovulation. A lioness may mate with more than one male when she is in heat.|$|E
5|$|The {{clitoris}} develops from a phallic outgrowth in {{the embryo}} called the genital tubercle. Initially undifferentiated, the tubercle develops into either a clitoris or <b>penis</b> during {{development of the}} reproductive system depending on exposure to androgens (primarily male hormones). The clitoris forms from the same tissues that become the glans and upper shaft of the <b>penis,</b> and this shared embryonic origin makes these two organs homologous (different {{versions of the same}} structure).|$|E

As is characteristic of Sigmodontinae, Pseudoryzomys has a complex <b>penis,</b> with the baculum (<b>penis</b> bone) displaying large protuberances at the sides. In the cartilaginous part of the baculum, the central digit is smaller than those at the sides.|$|E
5|$|The {{foreskin}} extends {{out from}} the base of the glans and covers the glans when the <b>penis</b> is flaccid. Proposed theories for the purpose of the foreskin are that it serves to protect the <b>penis</b> as the fetus develops in the mother's womb, that it helps to preserve moisture in the glans, and that it improves sexual pleasure. The foreskin may also be a pathway of infection for certain diseases. Circumcision removes the foreskin at its attachment to the base of the glans.|$|E

5|$|Candi Sukuh {{temple of}} Ngancar, East Java, {{was built in}} the 10th century and is {{dedicated}} to Shiva and is evidence of Tantric ritual in Hinduism and the fertility cult practiced at the time and preoccupation with the lingga. The temple has numerous reliefs graphically depicting sexuality and fertility including several stone depictions of a copulating <b>penis</b> and vagina. It consists of a pyramid with reliefs and statues at the front. Among them is a male statue clutching his <b>penis,</b> with three tortoises with flattened shells. The temple once had a striking 1.82 metre (5'11.5ft) representation of lingga with four testicles; this is now housed in the National Museum of Indonesia. Phallic references were also made in Khmer architecture in Cambodia, and several Khmer temples depict the phallus in reliefs.|$|E
5|$|If oral {{medications}} and mechanical treatments fail, the second choice is local injections: medications such as papaverine and prostaglandin that alter the blood flow and trigger erection are {{injected into the}} <b>penis.</b> This method is preferred for its effectiveness, but can cause pain and scarring.|$|E
