This technique can be mounted on many <b>types</b> of <b>drilling</b> <b>machines.</b> In <b>drilling</b> process, the drilling bit contacts the drilling material directly, which means the drilling process has a close relation with mechanical properties of drilling material. So the drilling process can be considered as an in-situ test of rock mechanical properties. The major obstacle {{is that it is not}} easy to grasp the basic mechanic properties of natural materials. As the physical and mechanical properties of concrete are similar to those of intact rock, it is a suitable material for the purpose of this study and is henceforth termed as artificial geo-materials. Therefore, the main aim of the first part of this study was to investigate the specific relationships between the drilling parameters and mechanical parameters of artificial geo-materials in the drilling process. The second part of this study introduced DPM method in the ground investigation in Tongchuan. The main objective of in-situ DPM tests is to use DPM method to characterize rock stratum along the borehole. Furthermore, from the in-situ DPM tests, the data interpretation criteria have been improved. The detailed elaboration of putting steel wires operation has been summarized, which is the distinctive operation.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} {{generally}} {{about how the}} mechanical system reacts when a load is given or friction is happen to touch the mechanical system. Every mechanical system will always be affected {{when there is a}} disturbance. Drilling operation is one of the common operations in the industry. When the drilling operation works, there must be a friction occurs when the work is done. Thus, there will be lack of performance for the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> The lack of the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> will lead to the speed of the machine that will decrease slightly. That is the main part of this project. To make the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> maintain, the speed must be increase as soon the friction is given to the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> To solve the problem, the Fuzzy Logic Method is use in this project. Using Fuzzy Logic Method, new equation will be finding and use it for this project. From the method, the speed of the motor will increase when the drilling operation is given a friction. There will be feedback for the error that the sensors detect from the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine.</b> The feedback will calculate the error and from the calculation the new increasing voltage will be determined. For the conclusion, the method is trying to find the new voltage for the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> to maintain the speed of the machine. From the fact, we know that when the voltage in increase, the speed will also increase. Thus, the performance of the <b>drilling</b> <b>machine</b> will become more efficient...|$|R
