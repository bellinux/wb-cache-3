40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the results of}} static compression and tension load tests performed on three-instrumented large diameter Continuous Flight Auger piles installed in Dublin boulder clay. The piles developed very high shaft resistance and, in contrast to <b>piles</b> <b>driven</b> into boulder clay which exhibit friction fatigue, the shaft distribution was uniform along the pile shaft. This resulted in the normalised average shear resistance being mobilised by a bored pile exceeding that of a <b>pile</b> <b>driven</b> in similar ground conditions. In contrast the base resistance of the test piles were significantly lower than a <b>pile</b> <b>driven</b> in similar ground conditions...|$|R

2500|$|Prefabricated <b>piles</b> are <b>driven</b> {{into the}} ground using a <b>pile</b> driver. <b>Driven</b> <b>piles</b> are either wood, {{reinforced}} concrete, or steel. Wooden piles are made from the trunks of tall trees. Concrete piles are available in square, octagonal, and round cross-sections (like Franki piles). They are reinforced with rebar and are often prestressed. Steel piles are either pipe piles {{or some sort of}} beam section (like an H-pile).

40|$|Graduation date: 1970 Predetermining the {{ultimate}} capacity of <b>piles</b> <b>driven</b> into purely cohesive soils and purely cohesionless soils involves, respectively, {{the consideration of}} soil shear strength in a completely undrained and a completely drained condition. For the intermediate cases concerning soils that possess both cohesion and internal friction (silts, clayey silts, sandy clays, etc.) the capacity prediction may assume either condition of drainage depending upon {{the characteristics of the}} soil, its stress history, and the duration of load. The actual conditions of failure for <b>piles</b> <b>driven</b> into these soils are uncertain unless test piles can be observed under a series of loads to failure. This study involves the determination of the capacity of an individual <b>pile</b> <b>driven</b> into a clayey silt. Capacity predictions based upon static formulas by Terzaghi and Peck, Meyerhof and William Moore are calculated for both drained and undrained conditions around the pile. By the performance of a series of load tests is is found that in the soil encountered {{the ultimate}} load supported by the pile is best described by the Meyerhof determination, assuming a state of complete drainage...|$|R

40|$|Estimation of the axial {{capacity}} of <b>piles</b> <b>driven</b> into sand involves considerable uncertainty, and design rules {{are generally not}} consistent with the physical processes involved.

It allows for the effects of confining stress on the frictional and compress-ibility characteristics of sand, and hence on end-bearing capacity. In keeping with field observations, shaft friction is assumed to degrade with driving of the pile past a particular location, from an initial maximum value linked to the local end-bearing capacity. The resulting design approach is compared with field data, and effects of factors such as the direction of loading are dis-cussed...|$|R
