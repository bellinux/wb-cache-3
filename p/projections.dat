50|$|Orthographic <b>projection</b> (sometimes {{orthogonal}} <b>projection),</b> is a {{means of}} representing three-dimensional objects in two dimensions. It is a form of parallel <b>projection,</b> in which all the <b>projection</b> lines are orthogonal to the <b>projection</b> plane, resulting in every plane of the scene appearing in affine transformation on the viewing surface. The obverse of an orthographic <b>projection</b> is an oblique <b>projection,</b> which is a parallel <b>projection</b> in which the <b>projection</b> lines are not orthogonal to the <b>projection</b> plane.|$|R
5000|$|Special {{cases of}} the Bonne <b>projection</b> include the {{sinusoidal}} <b>projection,</b> when φ1 is zero (i.e. the Equator), and the Werner <b>projection,</b> when φ1 is 90° (i.e. the North or South Pole). The Bonne <b>projection</b> {{can be seen as}} an intermediate <b>projection</b> in the unwinding of a Werner <b>projection</b> into a Sinusoidal projection; an alternative intermediate would be a Bottomley <b>projection</b> ...|$|R

5|$|Sculpturing is seen {{on many of}} {{the skull}} bones, in the form of long grooves, pits and protrusions. Like other ceratosaurs, the frontal bones of the skull roof were fused together. Carnotaurines {{commonly}} had bony <b>projections</b> from the skull. Carnotaurus had two pronounced horns, projecting outward above the eyes, while its close relative Aucasaurus had smaller <b>projections</b> in the same area. Majungasaurus and Rajasaurus had a single bony horn or dome, projecting upwards from the skull. These <b>projections,</b> like the horns of many modern animals, might have been displayed for species recognition or intimidation. In Arcovenator, the dorsal margin of the postorbital (and probably also the lacrimal) is thickened dorsolaterally, forming a strong and rugose bony brow ridge rising above the level of the skull roof. Maybe this rugose brow ridge supported a keratinous or scaly structure for displays.|$|E

50|$|The Mollweide <b>projection</b> is an equal-area, pseudocylindrical map <b>projection</b> {{generally}} {{used for}} global {{maps of the}} world or night sky. It {{is also known as}} the Babinet <b>projection,</b> homalographic <b>projection,</b> homolographic <b>projection,</b> and elliptical <b>projection.</b> The <b>projection</b> trades accuracy of angle and shape for accuracy of proportions in area, and as such is used where that property is needed, such as maps depicting global distributions.|$|R
50|$|Orthographic <b>projection</b> {{is derived}} from the {{principles}} of descriptive geometry, and is a type of parallel <b>projection</b> where the <b>projection</b> rays are perpendicular to the <b>projection</b> plane. It is the <b>projection</b> type of choice for working drawings.|$|R
5|$|The {{walls of}} the vimana below the dravida {{superstructure}} are decorated with simple pilasters in low relief with boldly modeled sculptures between them. There are fully decorated surfaces with frequent recesses and <b>projections</b> with deeper niches and conventional sculptures. The decoration of the walls is subdued {{compared to that of}} the later Hoysala architecture. The walls, which are broken up into hundreds of <b>projections</b> and recesses, produce a remarkable effect of light and shade, an artistic vocabulary inherited by the Hoysala builders in the decades that followed.|$|E
5|$|All <b>projections</b> of {{the future}} of the Earth, the Solar System, and the Universe must account for the second law of thermodynamics, which states that entropy, or a loss of the energy {{available}} to do work, must increase over time. Stars will eventually exhaust their supply of hydrogen fuel and burn out. Close encounters gravitationally fling planets from their star systems, and star systems from galaxies.|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from the}} large nasal horn and four long frill spikes, the cranial {{ornamentation}} was variable. Some individuals had small hook-like <b>projections</b> and knobs at the posterior margin of the frill, similar to but smaller than those in Centrosaurus. Others had less prominent tabs. Some, like the type individual, had a third pair of long frill spikes. Others had much smaller <b>projections,</b> and small points are found on the side margins of some but not all specimens. Modest pyramid-shaped brow horns were present in subadults, but were replaced by pits in adults. Like most ceratopsids, Styracosaurus had large fenestrae (skull openings) in its frill. The front of the mouth had a toothless beak.|$|E
40|$|Rear <b>projection</b> of {{large-scale}} upright displays is often preferred over front <b>projection</b> {{because of the}} elimination of shadows that occlude the projected image. However, rear <b>projection</b> {{is not always a}} feasible option for space and cost reasons. Recent research suggests that many of the desirable features of rear <b>projection,</b> in particular shadow elimination, can be reproduced using new front <b>projection</b> techniques. We report on an empirical study to determine how two of these new <b>projection</b> techniques compare with traditional rear <b>projection</b> and front <b>projection,</b> with the hope of motivating the continued advance of improved virtual rear <b>projection</b> techniques...|$|R

5|$|By extrapolating the now-eroded {{and tilted}} beds upward, geologists have {{determined}} that these mountains were several kilometers high. Similar <b>projections</b> of the tilted beds downward, coupled with geophysical measurements on the greenstone belts in Canada, suggest the metavolcanic and metasedimentary rocks of the belts project downward {{at least a few}} kilometers.|$|E
5|$|Caterpillars have {{different}} types of projections; setae (hairs), spines, warts, tubercles, and horns. The hairs come in an assortment of colours and may be long or short; single, in clusters, or in tufts; thinner at the point or clubbed at the end. A spine may either be a chalaza (having a single point) or a scolus (having multiple points). The warts may either be small bumps or short <b>projections</b> on the body. The tubercles are fleshy body <b>projections</b> that are either short and bump-like or long and filament-like. They usually occur in pairs or in a cluster on one or more segments. The horns are short, fleshy, and are drawn to a point. They are usually found on the eighth abdominal segment.|$|E
5|$|Despite the on-ice success, the Atlanta {{ownership}} {{was never}} on sound financial footing. Longtime general manager Cliff Fletcher said {{years later that}} Cousins' initial financial <b>projections</b> for an NHL team did {{not account for the}} WHA entering the picture. The Flames were also a poor draw, and never signed a major television contract.|$|E
50|$|The Behrmann <b>projection</b> is a {{cylindrical}} map <b>projection</b> {{described by}} Walter Behrmann in 1910. It {{is a member}} of the cylindrical equal-area <b>projection</b> family. Members of the family differ by their standard parallels, which are parallels along which the <b>projection</b> has no distortion. In the case of the Behrmann <b>projection,</b> the standard parallels are 30°N and 30°S. The <b>projection</b> shares many characteristics with other members of the family such as the Lambert cylindrical equal-area <b>projection,</b> whose standard parallel is the equator, and the Gall-Peters <b>projection,</b> whose standard parallels are 45°N and 45°S. While equal-area, distortion of shape increases in the Behrmann <b>projection</b> according to distance from the standard parallels. This <b>projection</b> is not equidistant.|$|R
40|$|To {{produce the}} {{greatest}} horizontal distance in a punt kick the ball must be projected at an appropriate angle. Here, we investigated the optimum <b>projection</b> angle that maximises the distance attained in a punt kick by a soccer goalkeeper. Two male players performed many maximum-effort kicks using <b>projection</b> angles of between 10 ° and 90 °. The kicks were recorded by {{a video camera}} at 100 Hz and a 2 D biomechanical analysis was conducted to obtain measures of the <b>projection</b> velocity, <b>projection</b> angle, <b>projection</b> height, ball spin rate, and foot velocity at impact. The player's optimum <b>projection</b> angle was calculated by substituting mathematical equations for {{the relationships between the}} <b>projection</b> variables into the equations for the aerodynamic flight of a soccer ball. The calculated optimum <b>projection</b> angles were in agreement with the player's preferred <b>projection</b> angles (40 ° and 44 °). In projectile sports even a small dependence of <b>projection</b> velocity on <b>projection</b> angle is sufficient to produce a substantial shift in the optimum <b>projection</b> angle away from 45 °. In the punt kicks studied here, the optimum <b>projection</b> angle was close to 45 ° because the <b>projection</b> velocity of the ball remained almost constant across all <b>projection</b> angles. This result is in contrast to throwing and jumping for maximum distance, where the <b>projection</b> velocity the athlete is able to achieve decreases substantially with increasing <b>projection</b> angle and so the optimum <b>projection</b> angle is well below 45 °...|$|R

5|$|Just Cause 2 {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised its gameplay, open-ended nature, stunts, world design and graphics and criticized its story, gunplay and mission design. Sales of six million copies worldwide exceeded original <b>projections.</b> The game was supported with downloadable content at release, and a multiplayer fan project was eventually approved as an add-on. A sequel, Just Cause 3, {{was released in}} late 2015.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of <b>projection</b> angle on the distance attained in a rugby place kick. A male rugby player performed 49 maximum-effort kicks using <b>projection</b> angles of between 20 and 50 °. The kicks were recorded by a video camera at 50 Hz and a 2 D biomechanical analysis was conducted to obtain measures of the <b>projection</b> velocity and <b>projection</b> angle of the ball. The player’s optimum <b>projection</b> angle was calculated by substituting a mathematical expression {{for the relationship between}} <b>projection</b> velocity and <b>projection</b> angle into the equations for the aerodynamic flight of a rugby ball. We found that the player’s calculated optimum <b>projection</b> angle (30. 6 °, 95 % confidence limits ± 1. 9 °) was in close agreement with his preferred <b>projection</b> angle (mean value 30. 8 °, 95 % confidence limits ± 2. 1 °). The player’s calculated optimum <b>projection</b> angle was also similar to <b>projection</b> angles previously reported for skilled rugby players. The optimum <b>projection</b> angle in a rugby place kick is considerably less than 45 ° because the <b>projection</b> velocity that a player can produce decreases substantially as <b>projection</b> angle is increased. Aerodynamic forces and the requirement to clear the crossbar have little effect on the optimum <b>projection</b> angle...|$|R

The swollen parts of the cheilocystidia are covered with short rodlike protuberances or warts. The flesh of the gills is vinaceous-brown when stained in iodine. The flesh of the cap is made up of greatly enlarged cells, with the surface covered with club-shaped to almost globular cells measuring 25–40 by about 20µm. Their walls are finely verrucose (covered with small warts), and all but the verrucose cells are -brown in iodine. Clamp connections are abundant in the hyphae.|$|E
5|$|The {{establishment}} of national television networks {{during this period}} further fueled the growth of independent Somali productions, most shot on video. Having now obtained greater penetration of the domestic market, the focus then shifted from traditional film premieres in movie theaters to private <b>projections.</b> Consequently, fewer foreign films were imported into the country.|$|E
5|$|The {{gatehouse}} in {{the centre}} of the south curtain wall mostly dates from the 13thcentury. It was originally accessed via a drawbridge and visitors had to pass through two gates, one {{at either end of the}} passage, and a portcullis. The semi-octagonal <b>projections</b> on either side of the gate passage are considered ornamental. Between the <b>projections</b> and above the gate were machicolations, openings for missiles to be hurled at attackers. The rooms on either side of the passage were guardrooms. The only remaining openings on the front are slits at ground level. Slits on the other sides of the gatehouse, and along the entrance passage, allowed the gatekeeper to watch people approaching and entering the castle. The structure underwent later alterations in the 19th and 20thcenturies when it housed the castle's custodian; slits in the gatehouse's front may have been filled in.|$|E
