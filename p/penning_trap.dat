5|$|In {{laboratory}} conditions, {{the interactions}} of individual electrons can be observed by means of particle detectors, which allow measurement of specific properties such as energy, spin and charge. The development of the Paul trap and <b>Penning</b> <b>trap</b> allows charged particles to be contained within a small region for long durations. This enables precise measurements of the particle properties. For example, in one instance a <b>Penning</b> <b>trap</b> was used to contain a single electron {{for a period of}} 10 months. The magnetic moment of the electron was measured to a precision of eleven digits, which, in 1980, was a greater accuracy than for any other physical constant.|$|E
5|$|The {{strength}} {{and range of}} the electric force and the good conductivity of plasmas usually ensure that the densities {{of positive and negative}} charges in any sizeable region are equal ("quasineutrality"). A plasma with a significant excess of charge density, or, in the extreme case, is composed of a single species, is called a non-neutral plasma. In such a plasma, electric fields play a dominant role. Examples are charged particle beams, an electron cloud in a <b>Penning</b> <b>trap</b> and positron plasmas.|$|E
25|$|Ion {{cyclotron}} resonance (ICR) is an older mass analysis technique similar to FTMS except that ions are detected {{with a traditional}} detector. Ions trapped in a <b>Penning</b> <b>trap</b> are excited by an RF electric field until they impact {{the wall of the}} trap, where the detector is located.

25|$|In physics, {{there are}} several systems whose {{dynamical}} equations resemble the equations of motion of a gyrostat. Examples include a solid body with a cavity filled with an inviscid, incompressible, homogeneous liquid, the static equilibrium configuration of a stressed elastic rod in elastica theory, the polarization dynamics of a light pulse propagating through a nonlinear medium, the Lorenz system in chaos theory, and the motion of an ion in a <b>Penning</b> <b>trap</b> mass spectrometer.|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 2000s, Researchers at LANL {{reasoned}} that a plasma oscillating {{could be at}} local thermodynamic equilibrium. This prompted the POPS and <b>Penning</b> <b>trap</b> designs. At this time, researchers at MIT became interested in fusors for space propulsion and powering space vehicles. Specifically, researchers developed fusors with multiple inner cages. Greg Piefer graduated from Madison and founded Phoenix Nuclear Labs, a company that developed the fusor into a neutron source for the mass production of medical isotopes. Robert Bussard began speaking openly about the Polywell in 2006. He attempted to generate interest in the research, before his death. In 2008, Taylor Wilson achieved notoriety for achieving nuclear fusion at 14, with a homemade fusor.|$|E
25|$|Antimatter {{cannot be}} stored in a {{container}} made of ordinary matter because antimatter reacts with any matter it touches, annihilating itself and {{an equal amount of}} the container. Antimatter in the form of charged particles can be contained by a combination of electric and magnetic fields, in a device called a <b>Penning</b> <b>trap.</b> This device cannot, however, contain antimatter that consists of uncharged particles, for which atomic traps are used. In particular, such a trap may use the dipole moment (electric or magnetic) of the trapped particles. At high vacuum, the matter or antimatter particles can be trapped and cooled with slightly off-resonant laser radiation using a magneto-optical trap or magnetic trap. Small particles can also be suspended with optical tweezers, using a highly focused laser beam.|$|E

50|$|<b>Penning</b> <b>traps,</b> {{the central}} element in modern high-accuracy high-sensitivity mass {{measurement}} installations, enable measurements of accuracies approaching 1 part in 10^11 on single ions. However, {{to achieve this}} <b>Penning</b> <b>traps</b> must have the ion to be measured delivered to it very precisely and with certainty that it is indeed the desired ion. This imposes severe requirements on the apparatus that must take the atomic nucleus out of the target {{in which it has}} been created, sort it from the myriad of other ions that are emitted from the target and then direct it {{so that it can be}} captured in the measurement trap.|$|R

2500|$|There {{are also}} {{electrostatic}} confinement fusion devices. These devices confine ions using electrostatic fields. The best known is the Fusor. This device has a cathode inside an anode wire cage. Positive ions fly towards the negative inner cage, and are heated by the electric {{field in the}} process. If they miss the inner cage they can collide and fuse. Ions typically hit the cathode, however, creating prohibitory high conduction losses. Also, fusion rates in fusors are very low because of competing physical effects, such as energy loss {{in the form of}} light radiation. Designs have been proposed to avoid the problems associated with the cage, by generating the field using a non-neutral cloud. These include a plasma oscillating device, a [...] a <b>penning</b> <b>trap</b> and the polywell. The technology is relatively immature, however, and many scientific and engineering questions remain.|$|E
2500|$|Fourier {{transform}} {{mass spectrometry}} (FTMS), {{or more precisely}} Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance MS, measures mass by detecting the image current produced by ions cyclotroning {{in the presence of}} a magnetic field. Instead of measuring the deflection of ions with a detector such as an electron multiplier, the ions are injected into a <b>Penning</b> <b>trap</b> (a static electric/magnetic ion trap) where they effectively form part of a circuit. Detectors at fixed positions in space measure the electrical signal of ions which pass near them over time, producing a periodic signal. Since the frequency of an ion's cycling is determined by its mass-to-charge ratio, this can be deconvoluted by performing a Fourier transform on the signal. FTMS has the advantage of high sensitivity (since each ion is [...] "counted" [...] more than once) and much higher resolution and thus precision.|$|E

40|$|The CPT theorem {{has been}} tested to very high {{precision}} {{in a variety of}} experiments involving particles and antiparticles confined within <b>Penning</b> <b>traps.</b> These tests include comparisons of anomalous magnetic moments and charge-to-mass ratios of electrons and positrons, protons and antiprotons, and hydrogen ions and antiprotons. We present a theoretical analysis of possible signals for CPT and Lorentz violation in these systems. We use the framework of Colladay and Kosteleck´y, which consists of a general extension of the SU(3) × SU(2) × U(1) standard model including possible CPT and Lorentz violations arising from spontaneous symmetry breaking at a fundamental level, such as in string theory. We work {{in the context of an}} extension of quantum electrodynamics to examine CPT and Lorentz tests in <b>Penning</b> <b>traps.</b> Our analysis permits a detailed study of the effectiveness of experimental tests of CPT and Lorentz symmetry performed in <b>Penning</b> <b>traps.</b> We describe possible signals that might appear in principle, and estimate bounds on CPT and Lorentz violation attainable in present and future experiments. ...|$|R

2500|$|Fourier-transform ion {{cyclotron}} resonance mass spectrometry {{is a type of}} mass analyzer (or mass spectrometer) for determining the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) of ions based on the cyclotron frequency of the ions in a fixed magnetic field. The ions are trapped in a <b>Penning</b> <b>trap</b> (a magnetic field with electric trapping plates), where they are excited (at their resonant cyclotron frequencies) to a larger cyclotron radius by an oscillating electric field orthogonal to the magnetic field. After the excitation field is removed, the ions are rotating at their cyclotron frequency in phase (as a [...] "packet" [...] of ions). These ions induce a charge (detected as an image current) on a pair of electrodes as the packets of ions pass close to them. The resulting signal is called a free induction decay (FID), transient or interferogram that consists of a superposition of sine waves. The useful signal is extracted from this data by performing a Fourier transform to give a mass spectrum.|$|E

50|$|Using the <b>Penning</b> <b>trap</b> {{can have}} {{advantages}} {{over the radio}} frequency trap (Paul trap). Firstly, in the <b>Penning</b> <b>trap</b> only static fields are applied and therefore there is no micro-motion and resultant heating of the ions due to the dynamic fields, even for extended 2- and 3-dimensional ion Coulomb crystals. Also, the <b>Penning</b> <b>trap</b> can be made larger whilst maintaining strong trapping. The trapped ion can then be held further away from the electrode surfaces. Interaction with patch potentials on the electrode surfaces can be responsible for heating and decoherence effects and these effects scale as a high power of the inverse distance between the ion and the electrode.|$|E
