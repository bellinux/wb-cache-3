40|$|Separate {{samples of}} supragingival dental <b>plaque</b> overtly free of blood were {{centrifuged}} {{to obtain the}} free fluid phase (<b>plaque</b> fluid). Bound protein was eluted from the <b>plaque</b> bacteria and matrix by washing the <b>plaque</b> with a low-pH buffer. The <b>plaque</b> fluid, low pH eluate, and whole saliva were assayed for immunoglobulins A, G, and M, the third component of complement, lysozyme, lactoferrin, and lactoperoxidase. Concentrations of total protein and albumin were also determined. Antibody reactive with specific <b>plaque</b> bacteria was detected by indirect immunofluorescent microscopy.

40|$|Objectives The {{aim of this}} {{cross-sectional}} study {{was to assess the}} correlation between dental <b>plaque</b> scores determined by the measurement of red autofluorescence or by visualization with a two-tone solution. Clinical photographs were used for this study. Materials and methods Overnight <b>plaque</b> from the anterior teeth of 48 participants was assessed for red fluorescence on photographs (taken with a QLF-camera) using a modified Quigley & Hein (mQH) index. A two-tone disclosing solution was applied. Total disclosed <b>plaque</b> was clinically assessed using the mQH index. In addition, total and blue disclosed <b>plaque</b> was scored on clinical photographs using the mQH index. Results A strong correlation was observed between the total disclosed <b>plaque</b> scored on photographs and the clinical scores (r = 0. 70 at site level; r = 0. 88 at subject level). The correlation between red fluorescent <b>plaque</b> and total <b>plaque,</b> as assessed on the photographs, was moderate to strong and significant (r = 0. 50 at the site level; r = 0. 70 at the subject level), with the total <b>plaque</b> scores consistently higher than the red fluorescent <b>plaque</b> scores. The correlation between red fluorescent <b>plaque</b> and blue disclosed <b>plaque</b> was weak to moderate and significant (r = 0. 30 at the site level; r = 0. 50 at the subject level).

A computational procedure based on meshless gen-eralized finite difference (MGFD) method and serial magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data was introduced to quantify patient-specific carotid atherosclerotic <b>plaque</b> growth functions and sim-ulate <b>plaque</b> progression. Participating patients were scanned three times (T 1, T 2, and T 3, at inter-vals of about 18 months) to obtain <b>plaque</b> progres-sion data.

40|$|Abstract Background Cholesterol {{deposition}} in arterial wall drives atherosclerosis. The key {{goal of this}} study was to examine the relationship between <b>plaque</b> cholesterol content and patient characteristics that typically associate with disease state and lesion vulnerability. Quantitative assays for free cholesterol, cholesteryl ester, triglyceride, and protein markers in atherosclerotic <b>plaque</b> were established and applied to <b>plaque</b> samples from multiple patients and arterial beds (Carotid and peripheral arteries; 98 lesions in total). Results We observed a lower cholesterol level in restenotic than primary peripheral <b>plaque.</b> We observed a trend toward a higher level in symptomatic than asymptomatic carotid <b>plaque.</b> Peripheral <b>plaque</b> from a group of well-managed diabetic patients displayed a weak trend of more free cholesterol deposition than <b>plaque</b> from non-diabetic patients. <b>Plaque</b> triglyceride content exhibited less difference in the same comparisons. We also measured cholesterol in multiple segments within one carotid <b>plaque</b> sample, and found that cholesterol content positively correlated with markers of <b>plaque</b> vulnerability, and negatively correlated with stability markers. Conclusions Our results offer important biological validation of cholesterol as a key lipid marker for <b>plaque</b> severity.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Atherosclerotic <b>plaque</b> rupture is {{the culprit}} event which underpins most acute {{vascular}} syndromes such as acute myocardial infarction. Novel biomarkers of <b>plaque</b> rupture could improve biological understanding and clinical management of patients presenting with possible acute vascular syndromes but such biomarker(s) remain elusive. Investigation of biomarkers {{in the context}} of de novo <b>plaque</b> rupture in humans is confounded by the inability to attribute the <b>plaque</b> rupture as the source of biomarker release, as <b>plaque</b> ruptures are typically associated with prompt down-stream events of myocardial necrosis and systemic inflammation. METHODS: We developed a novel approach to identify potential biomarkers of <b>plaque</b> rupture by integrating <b>plaque</b> imaging, using optical coherence tomography, with both <b>plaque</b> and plasma proteomic analysis in a human model of angioplasty-induced <b>plaque</b> disruption. RESULTS: We compared two pairs of coronary <b>plaque</b> debris, captured by a FilterWire Device, and their corresponding control samples and found matrix metalloproteinase 9 (MMP 9) to be significantly enriched in <b>plaque.</b> <b>Plaque</b> contents, as defined by optical coherence tomography, affect the systemic changes of MMP 9. Disruption of lipid-rich <b>plaque</b> led to prompt elevation of plasma MMP 9, whereas disruption of non-lipid-rich <b>plaque</b> resulted in delayed elevation of plasma MMP 9. Systemic MMP 9 elevation is independent of the associated myocardial necrosis and systemic inflammation (measured by Troponin I and C-reactive protein, respectively). This information guided the selection of a subset of subjects of for further label free proteomics analysis by liquid chromatography tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). We discovered five novel, plaque-enriched proteins (lipopolysaccharide binding protein, Annexin A 5, eukaryotic translocation initiation factor, syntaxin 11, cytochrome B 5 reductase 3) to be significantly elevated in systemic circulation at 5  min after <b>plaque</b> disruption. CONCLUSION: This novel approach for biomarker discovery in human coronary artery <b>plaque</b> disruption can identify new biomarkers related to human coronary artery <b>plaque</b> composition and disruption.

40|$|Rupture of {{atherosclerotic}} <b>plaque</b> is a {{major cause}} of mortality. <b>Plaque</b> stress analysis, based on patient-specific multisequence in vivo MRI, can provide critical information for the understanding of <b>plaque</b> rupture and could eventually lead to <b>plaque</b> rupture prediction.

40|$|Although <b>plaque</b> erosion causes {{approximately}} 40 % of all coronary thrombi and disproportionally affects {{women more}} than men, its mechanism {{is not well}} understood. The role of tissue mechanics in <b>plaque</b> rupture and regulation of mechanosensitive inflammatory proteins is well established, but their role in <b>plaque</b> erosion is unknown. Given obvious differences in morphology between <b>plaque</b> erosion and rupture, we hypothesized that inflammation in general {{as well as the}} association between local mechanical strain and inflammation known to exist in <b>plaque</b> rupture may not occur in <b>plaque</b> erosion. Therefore, our objective was to determine if similar mechanisms underlie <b>plaque</b> rupture and <b>plaque</b> erosion. We studied a total of 74 human coronary <b>plaque</b> specimens obtained at autopsy. Using lesion-specific computer modeling of solid mechanics, we calculated the stress and strain distribution for each <b>plaque</b> and determined if there were any relationships with markers of inflammation. Consistent with previous studies, inflammatory markers were positively associated with increasing strain in specimens with rupture and thin-cap fibroatheromas. Conversely, overall staining for inflammatory markers and apoptosis were significantly lower in erosion, and there was no relationship with mechanical strain. Samples with <b>plaque</b> erosion most closely resembled those with the stable phenotype of thick-cap fibroatheromas. In contrast to classic <b>plaque</b> rupture, <b>plaque</b> erosion was not associated with markers of inflammation and mechanical strain. These data suggest that <b>plaque</b> erosion is a distinct pathophysiological process with a different etiology and therefore raises the possibility that a different therapeutic approach may be required to prevent <b>plaque</b> erosion...|$|R

40|$|AbstractObjective: Microemboli {{passing through}} the {{cerebral}} artery downstream from high-grade carotid artery stenosis produce transient ischemic symptoms and may result in stroke. Rupture of carotid artery <b>plaque</b> is {{the main source of}} microemboli in high-grade internal carotid artery stenosis. However, the mechanisms underlying <b>plaque</b> rupture are unclear. We hypothesized that vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMC) from <b>plaque</b> in patients with symptoms of carotid artery stenosis undergo increased apoptosis and decreased proliferation, compared with VSMC in patients without symptoms. Methods: VSMC were isolated by means of enzymatic dissociation from <b>plaque</b> removed at carotid endarterectomy in patients with symptoms of carotid artery stenosis, eg, hemispheric transient ischemic attacks, amaurosis fugax, or stroke, and patients with high-grade stenosis without symptoms. VSMC were cultured and immunostained with smooth muscle α-actin and caldesmon antibodies to ensure purity. TUNEL assay and annexin V labeling were performed to identify VSMC undergoing apoptosis. Proliferation assay with [3 H] thymidine incorporation was performed in VSMC stimulated with fetal bovine serum (FBS), and cell cycle profile was analyzed with DNA staining with Vindelov reagent. Results: We isolated VSMC from symptomatic <b>plaque</b> that showed gross ulceration, and asymptomatic <b>plaque.</b> Apoptosis, as measured with the TUNEL assay, in VSMC from symptomatic <b>plaque</b> was 5. 45 % ± 0. 8 %, and in asymptomatic <b>plaque</b> was 1. 20 % ± 0. 2 %. Annexin V labeling revealed that 26. 8 % ± 3. 8 % cells were labeled for phosphatidylserine in VSMC in symptomatic <b>plaque,</b> compared with 4. 8 % ± 0. 3 % cells in asymptomatic <b>plaque.</b> VSMC in asymptomatic <b>plaque</b> showed significantly increased uptake of [3 H] thymidine at all concentrations of FBS, compared with symptomatic <b>plaque.</b> In the presence of 10 % FBS, VSMC from asymptomatic <b>plaque</b> progressed through the S phase of the cell cycle, whereas significantly increased numbers of VSMC from symptomatic <b>plaque</b> were arrested in the S phase. Conclusion: Increased numbers of VSMC from symptomatic <b>plaque</b> undergo apoptosis, compared with VSMC from asymptomatic <b>plaque.</b> This could be due to inability of VSMC from symptomatic <b>plaque</b> to progress beyond the S phase of the cell cycle. Decreased proliferation and increased loss of VSMC as a result of apoptosis in symptomatic <b>plaque</b> may result in <b>plaque</b> rupture, leading to development of symptoms...|$|R
