40|$|Canada is {{an immense}} {{archipelago}} of islands and satellite cities, with several highly urbanized regions around the great metropolises of Montréal, Toronto, Vancouver and Ottawa, where {{half of the}} population is concentrated. For the great metropolises with extreme climates, the underground could be an important resource that could modify the overall fruition of the urban structure, with an interesting impact on the organization of the territory and landscape. One of the major cities built underground at the international level is the Ville Souterraine or RESO in Montréal, 32 km of pedestrian paths and shopping malls, 12 square metres of multipurpose spaces perfectly integrated into 41 districts above ground. Built in the 1960 s and later expanded, this complex, which has 120 entrances, is used by 500, 000 people every day. Toronto, divided into two parallel cities, one on the surface and one underground, is internationally recognized for the PATH, one of the most extensive shopping complexes that is perfectly integrated with a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>system</b> with facilities and vertical connections. The PATH plays an important role not only in the economic growth and urban evolution of Toronto, but is also an alternative way of experiencing the heart of the city.

40|$|HISTORY OF MUNCIE AND CURRENT SITE ISSUES This project {{looks at}} the {{problems}} with Muncie’s downtown and proposes a design that will revitalize it through urban parks. Muncie’s downtown began to see businesses leave during the 1970 s and 80 s, when Muncie had two major events that affected its downtown. First, Walnut Street was converted to a pedestrian mall, eliminating any automobile traffic along it and essentially killing the retail of the downtown. The second major event was {{the installation of the}} Muncie Mall on the north end of Muncie, which began to take businesses away from the downtown and out to the mall. In the 90 s to 2000 s, Muncie’s downtown began to slowly recovering from the devastation of the loss of businesses. However, as businesses began to move out in the 1990 s, their vacant buildings were replaced with parking lots. This has lead to an overabundance of parking lots in the downtown. Though Walnut has maintained its downtown style, the neighboring streets east and west of it, Mulberry and High, currently face mostly parking lots. Even though these streets are one block away, they have a completely different experience than Walnut. Most of these streets have poor sidewalk conditions and little destinations along them to get people to walk down them. As a result of this parking situation, most of the developmental land is tied up in privately owned parking lots, which means development only occurs when existing buildings become vacant. The other key issue is a lack of public spaces throughout the downtown. There are no places to gather or draw people to the downtown. Even if people were walking around downtown, there is little shade or seating provided anywhere outside of the buildings. DESIGN PHILOSPHY In order to solve these problems, a design philosophy was developed. After reviewing literature on the subject, an urban park was conceived as the solution towards the downtown’s problems. The idea behind this philosophy is that the park, people, and businesses are all connected in a cycle where they all benefit from the each other and if one is removed, it breaks the cycle. The cycle starts with the park providing activities and attractions for people. This will bring more people downtown to live and play. With more people living and visiting near the park, there will be a higher demand for goods and services to accommodate the increase of people. The businesses will realize the potential demand and move their retail near the park. The businesses, located next to the park, will help maintain it to keep people visiting it. DESIGN CONCEPT The main concept that followed this philosophy was incorporating multiple pocket parks connected along a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>circulation</b> <b>system</b> that looped throughout the downtown. These pocket parks form one larger linear park that becomes a landmark for the downtown. Although these parks are relatively close to each other, they are designed to each have a different style and character to them. Each park will provide different amenities to attract a diverse amount of users and give different opportunities for people downtown. These parks, connected to form one linear park, will attract people with its variety of amenities to the downtown and help revitalize the businesses. College of Architecture and PlanningThesis (B. L.

40|$|Analysis of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>circulation</b> in {{buildings}} is usually {{performed in the}} early stages of the design process or later on with respect to a specific design problem such as fire safety. In both cases, the analysis relates more to wayfinding, i. e. search for a route on the basis of fundamental normative criteria. Wayfinding analysis in existing buildings is useful for the comparison between “rational” behaviour and actual usage but this comparison does little to explicate the observed structure of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>circulation.</b> In contrast to wayfinding, route analysis deals with the registration and assessment of actual patterns of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>circulation</b> in existing buildings. These patterns are represented topologically and geometrically. The geometric representation makes use of norms underlying building codes in order to reach an appropriate level of abstraction. Route representations are implemented on top of a building representation of relevant spatial and building elements. The building representation serves both as input and output for the route analysis. Input and output are largely automated, including production of the geometric route locally (i. e. within each space) and measurement of route distance and complexity. Use data are collected in an alphanumeric database and linked dynamically to the geometric and topological representation. Route analysis supports and refines other forms of post-occupancy evaluation by adding important dynamic aspects to activity allocation and compartmentalization...|$|R

40|$|This report {{documents}} {{the work of}} the Senior Urban Design Studio in Springfield’s Upper Lyman District in downtown Springfield. It is part of the Metro Center neighborhood and adjacent to the Union Station that will be revitalized in 2016. The district is challenged by high vacancies and general abandonment. Housing opportunities and market-rate housing in particular are very low. The primary goal of the project was to develop a staged vision to revitalize and rediscover the Upper Lyman Warehouse District and to improve livability in the heart of downtown Springfield for employers, employees, residents, and visitors. The following recommendations can be articulated:Zoning regulations and creative incentives should encourage mixed land uses. Strategies such as adaptive reuse for significant historic buildings or urban infill could keep some of the historic character. New housing typologies should attract a diverse clientele to accommodate different styles of life, create a robust mix and support the vibrancy of the city. New retail with focus on grocery markets can attracts people to live in downtown and provides food security. A <b>pedestrian</b> and bicycle-oriented <b>circulation</b> <b>system</b> should connect to the Arc of Recreation and the Connecticut River Walk and Bikeway and to local assets like Downtown, the Union Station and the Quadrangle Museums. Include strategies should transform our area on a short-term basis and foster shaping a community.

40|$|Rail transit {{with its}} high {{passenger}} capacity and high efficiency {{has become one}} of the preferred alternatives to automobile travel. This is evident in the increasing patronage of rail travel especially in urban areas. As a result, many railway stations experience high levels of pedestrian congestion especially during the morning and afternoon peak periods. Traditional design and evaluation procedures for pedestrian transit facilities aim to maintain a desirable pedestrian level-of-service (PLOS) for the individual pedestrian areas or subprecincts. In complex transit facilities, these sub-precincts interact with one another so that <b>pedestrian</b> <b>circulation</b> might be better assessed from a broader systems perspective. Microsimulation packages that can model pedestrians (e. g. VISSIM) can be employed to assess these interactions. This paper outlines a procedure for the potential implementation of pedestrian flow analysis in a rail transit station using micro-simulation. Base model data requirements are identified which include static (facility layout and locations of temporary equipment) and dynamic data (pedestrian demand and public transport services). Possible model calibration criteria were also identified. A VISSIM® micro-simulation base model was developed for the North Melbourne Rail Station for investigating proposed station operational and infrastructure changes.
