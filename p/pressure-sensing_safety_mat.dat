25|$|There {{are several}} acts that {{completely}} invalidate the vault {{and result in}} a score of 0. These include receiving spotting (assistance) from a coach, going before the signal and not using the U-shaped <b>safety</b> <b>mat</b> for Yurchenko-style vaults.|$|R
50|$|Safety Light {{curtains}} {{fall into}} a category of equipment known as presence detection devices. Other common presence detection devices are pressure-sensitive <b>safety</b> <b>mats</b> and laser scanners (often used on Remotely Operated Vehicles (ROV) when in industrial settings). Most important application of safety relays is in automation industries dealing with robotic cell set up.|$|R
50|$|Rubbersoil, a recycled, {{lightweight}} and porous material made from cement and shredded old tyres, {{is used as}} a sub-base material of the facility. <b>Safety</b> <b>mats</b> in the ground is also derived from used tyres.A statue made from cement, crushed construction waste and glass pieces was erected in front of the ground's office as a landmark of the ground.|$|R
50|$|This episode {{aired on}} Tuesday 25 July, 2017. Similar to many European {{versions}} of Ninja Warrior, the Grand Final was set over three stages. Fred Dorrington had Berocca {{performance of the}} night. Dorrington was nearly disqualified after his foot thought to touch the water, but after a replay shows that the <b>safety</b> <b>mat</b> caused the ripple, Dorrington was allowed to continue from where he left off.|$|R
50|$|These firm mats {{are used}} on vault. They are U-shaped and {{surround}} the springboard on three sides. In {{the event that}} the gymnast's foot misses the springboard during his or her vault attempt, he or she can push off the mat for momentum and, hopefully, avoid a serious injury. Under the current Code of Points, performing a Yurchenko-style vault without the <b>safety</b> <b>mat</b> results in an automatic score of zero.|$|R
50|$|The Gomez tragedy {{stands as}} one of the most serious {{accidents}} ever to occur in artistic gymnastics, and helped prompt changes in the sport. In 1989, the International Gymnastics Federation decided to increase vaulting safety by allowing U-shaped springboard mats, traditionally utilized in practice to give all gymnasts a greater margin of error in preflight, to be used during competitions. The mat is now mandatory: as of the 2006 Code of Points, performing a Yurchenko-style vault without the <b>safety</b> <b>mat</b> results in an automatic score of zero.|$|R
50|$|Bell {{was well}} known in the wrestling {{community}} for a 2001 incident with Perry Saturn during a videotaped WWF dark match. Bell botched a snapmare armdrag of Saturn, causing Saturn to land on the mat headfirst. Saturn legitimately attacked Bell in retaliation for this perceived lack of professionalism and in-ring ethic, at one point tossing Bell out of the ring and causing Bell himself to land on his head on the <b>safety</b> <b>mat.</b> Neither performer sustained serious injury, and both were able to resume their respective roles and finish the match as planned, without most spectators realizing what had actually happened.|$|R
50|$|Rie Komiya has competed several times. She is a Kunoichi (Women of Ninja Warrior) 8 champion. She first {{competed in}} Sasuke 22, {{where she was}} disqualified on the Jumping Spider for falling on the <b>safety</b> <b>mat</b> just after the trampoline. She got her revenge in Sasuke 23, but she fell on the Halfpipe Attack. In Sasuke 24, she {{surprised}} many by failing the log grip. She did not compete in Sasuke 25, but did compete in Sasuke 26, and failed the Rolling Escargot and she competed again in Sasuke 27, where she failed the Rolling Escargot again.|$|R
50|$|The {{official}} {{start of}} the track in on the Grey River stopbank in Greymouth next to the historic railway signal box. The track then follows the coast up to the Taramakau River. There, trail users are currently required to use the Taramakau River Bridge, which is the last remaining combined road-rail bridge in the South Island. A clip on is under construction by civil contractor Fulton Hogan, due to open later in 2015, and as an interim measure, rubber <b>safety</b> <b>mats</b> have been installed that seal the groove between the rail tracks. From there, the track goes inland towards Kumara, following an old tram line. The 30 km section is grade 1.|$|R
50|$|The match {{takes place}} on a thick rubber mat that is {{shock-absorbing}} to ensure safety. A large outer circle at least 28 feet in diameter that designates the wrestling area is marked on the mat. The circumference line of that circle is called the boundary line. The wrestling area {{is surrounded by a}} <b>safety</b> <b>mat</b> area (or protection area) that is at least five inches in width. The mat area is designated by the use of contrasting colors or a 2 in line, which is in bounds as of the 2011-2012 scholastic season. The wrestlers are within bounds when the supporting points (the weight-bearing points of the body, such as the feet, hands, knees, buttocks) of either wrestler are inside this boundary line.|$|R
50|$|Over The Mat (All Ground Vehicles): One {{of the few}} {{games that}} uses all three track {{vehicles}} in the main games, most often the second or final event of the day. They make one lap around the long or short courses before making a turn {{to the center of}} the course where they park their vehicles into a parking zone that has their team color. They must avoid knocking a ball off a cone when parking, otherwise they are penalized 5 seconds before they can continue. Once they park they can jump on blue <b>safety</b> <b>mats</b> and the giant bean bag ball in order to switch to the next vehicle or tag their partner to continue the race. There are 4 laps for this and the first player to cross will win 1st place.|$|R
5000|$|In 1999, however, Atler had {{significant}} struggles. Early in the year, at the American Cup, {{she became the}} first American woman to successfully complete a Rudi vault in competition, and won the gold medal on the event, as well as on beam and on floor. However, she once again fell off the bars during both days of competition [...] and placed third overall. Shortly thereafter, at the Paris-Bercy meet in France, she placed second in the all-around and won another vault gold medal, but severely injured her ankle during the floor exercise final when she landed out-of-bounds, in an area without protective <b>safety</b> <b>mats,</b> after her first tumbling pass. Atler recovered in time to compete at the 1999 U.S. Nationals, where she won the event titles on the vault and the balance beam. However, in the all-around, she once again fell from bars and finished second to Kristen Maloney.|$|R
5|$|A foot pursuit {{in which}} Diesel, Brewster and Walker are chased across favela rooftops by Johnson {{and his team}} was filmed {{over the course of}} a week in the small {{hillside}} town of Naranjito, Puerto Rico. The scene was considered difficult to shoot, as pathways were slippery from moist tropical heat and the scene involved actors and stunt doubles running while avoiding dogs, chickens and other stray animals loose in the area. To capture the scene, a 420-foot cable-camera rig was used to allow for a fast moving, birds-eye view of the action, and cameras on cranes were set up on rooftops and in alleyways. Walker and Brewster made multiple takes of the conclusion of the scene, requiring them to jump nearly 30 feet from a building onto a waiting <b>safety</b> <b>mat.</b> In total the production employed 236 technicians, 13,145 extras, and generated 16,824 room nights at hotels, contributing $27 million to the Puerto Rican community.|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{study the}} rate, causes, {{and nature of}} rock {{climbing}} injuries presenting to an accident and emergency (A&E) department. METHODS: Patients presenting with rock climbing injuries to an urban A&E department were studied prospectively for one year. RESULTS: 19 rock climbers presented during the year, {{at a rate of}} one per 2774 A&E attendances. Fourteen climbers were injured on outdoor cliffs and five on the local indoor climbing wall, where the <b>safety</b> <b>mats</b> were noted to be in poor condition. Eighteen climbers had been injured during falls, 17 hitting the ground. Twelve of these climbers sustained fractures, four of which were missed on initial attendance. The remaining climber sustained the characteristic A 2 pulley finger injury, which was treated conservatively with a good result. CONCLUSIONS: The risks of rock climbing in Britain would be reduced if lead climbers arranged protection at earlier stages of climbs. Sports centres with climbing walls should regularly inspect and repair their safety equipment. It is important for staff in A&E departments to appreciate the large forces involved in any climbing fall, in order that significant injuries are not missed. Those treating injured climbers should also be aware of the specific injuries to which elite climbers are predisposed...|$|R
40|$|Numerous {{industrial}} robots for welding, material flow tasks, painting, inspection, assembly and disassembly applications are installed or {{are going to}} be put into service all over the world. They are working effectively, especially cost-effectively and {{with a high degree of}} reliability. One of their characteristics is the strict separation between robot and humans, who are working in the same production environment. The applicabel means for separation are prescribed very strictly by diverse national and international regualtions and extend from physical fences to light barriers, light curtains and <b>safety</b> <b>mats.</b> New robot applications are aiming at the automation of sevices which imply close cooperation with humans. Examples are well-known transportation vehicles (AGVs) and an increasing number of robots in public or at least populated environment. IPA's approach uses distributed smart sensor systems which are strategically installed around the robot. To adapt their survey areas to the a ctual robot configuration fault tolerant and self-controlling field-bus-systems are implemented. Recent prototypes are refueling robots or welding robots in shipyards. Here people are allowed to go in the nearest vicinity of the robot. This paper will present the above scope of interest for service robot safety sensors beginning with new requirements for sensor and control systems and continuing with the discussion of further developments of existing regulations. The safety concepts of selected examples, where robots are working closely adjacent to humans, will be presented. The paper will include an survey as well as major study results of these projects...|$|R
40|$|Climbing {{is one of}} {{the fastest}} growing extreme sports and this is {{reflected}} in the exponentially evolving equipment design. Mountaineering equipment is focused mainly on safety, prevention of injuries and protection from falls. Fall protection equipment comprises ropes, belay devices (rope brakes), energy absorbers and harnesses, as well as <b>safety</b> <b>mats</b> for bouldering. Shoes, crampons, ice axes and chalk improve friction and grip. Helmets protect the head primarily from falling rocks and secondarily from impacts in the event of a fall. Traditional alpine mountaineering has evolved into different climbing disciplines, such as sport climbing on natural rock faces and artificial climbing centres, characterised by routes equipped with permanent anchors; lead climbing, speed climbing and bouldering, the classical disciplines of climbing competitions; top roping; high-altitude mountaineering; ice climbing; dry tooling (combination of ice and rock climbing); &# 039;via ferrata&# 039; climbing (with pre-installed safety equipment such as ladders and iron cables); and free climbing and soloing disciplines, where the strength of a rope is merely replaced by mental toughness. The growth rate and popularity of sport climbing was triggered by the introduction of artificial outdoor climbing centres, climbing gyms and even indoor ice-climbing facilities, which make the sport more accessible. Modern design of climbing equipment is driven by innovation and constrained by safety standards. The general design principle is finding the optimum balance of minimising the weight and improving the strength of equipment. This chapter covers selected aspects of ropes and karabiners and discusses the mechanics and tribology of belay devices, friction anchors and chalk...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify the {{fundamental}} mechanism of a goalkeeper's (GK) diving motion according to the height and distance of the shot. We performed an experiment in which 11 university GKs participated. Their average height was 178. 4 cm (SD = 6. 2), and average mass was 71. 2 kg (SD = 2. 5). They were asked to dive toward and touch balls set at three different heights (2. 2 m from the ground, 1. 22 m from the ground, and <b>safety</b> <b>mat</b> height) located a short or a long distance (1. 83 m and 3. 50 m, respectively) from the GK. Kinematics and kinetic data were recorded using a three-dimensional motion analysis system (VICON; Oxford Metrix, 250 frames/s) and two force platforms (9281 A, Kistler Inc. 9287 B, Kistler Inc., 1000 Hz). By examining the GKs’ diving motions, we calculated the position of center of gravity (CG), joint angle, ground reaction force (GRF) and joint torque. The results indicated that the magnitude of the GRF under both legs and the direction of the GRF under the ball-side (BS) leg differed with the ball height. We also found that a higher dive by the GKs corresponded to a larger counter-movement of the contralateral-side (CS) leg and more exertion of extension torques at the hip and foot for take-off compared to those in lower dives (p <. 05). Furthermore, there were differences in timing of extension of the BS leg. These findings suggest that during the take-off part of the diving motion of a GK, depending on the ball height the CS leg controls the magnitude of power and the BS leg controls both the magnitude and the direction of power in order for the GK to dive directly towards the ball...|$|R
40|$|According to the World Health Organization, 0. 5 % of the {{population}} in developing countries is in need of prostheses or orthoses. For this population, obtaining a prosthetic is made difficult due to medical and transportation costs as well as a general lack of area resources. One possible solution to these problems would be to design a prosthetic socket from an inexpensive biodegradable material that could be produced in developing countries. One such material has been developed by Ecovative Design, LLC. Ecovativeâ€™s technology grows mycelium, mushroom roots, throughout a plant fiber matrix. Ecovative products are completely biodegradable and made naturally from local agricultural byproducts allowing it to be produced anywhere in the world. The objective of this project is to test material properties of Ecovative flat stock samples to analyze the materialâ€™s applicability as a prosthetic socket for developing countries. Properties evaluated include specific gravity, water absorption, coefficient of linear thermal expansion (CLTE), and hardness. The average specific gravity of the samples ranged from 0. 1036 to 0. 1440; the average water absorption ranged from 298. 70 to 350. 48 %; the average CLTE ranged from - 17. 42 to - 2. 99 x 10 - 5 /â„ƒ; the top hardness ranged from 30. 47 to 37. 63 N; the bottom hardness ranged from 17. 49 to 38. 70 N. From this data, it was determined that the Ecovative samples tested have potential to be used in prosthetic sockets if it can be redesigned to lower the water absorption. A hydrophilic coating {{would be one of the}} recommendations to decrease the water absorption. Future research should include further evaluation of a hydrophobic coating for the Ecovative materials, complete characterization of the material as well as implementation within floatation devices, <b>safety</b> <b>mats,</b> and arch support shoe inserts...|$|R
40|$|Recycling of {{elastomers}} {{in practice}} {{is fraught with}} a series of technological and economic hurdles. Here, the varietal separation is an absolute prerequisite for the utilisation of recycled materials in primary products. In the field of end-of-life products (e. g. tyres), where large quantities are accumulating, single-variety processing is not feasible, limiting the utilisation to secondary applications. Demand for such products, such as sports or <b>safety</b> <b>mats</b> however, is showing first signs of saturation, so new utilisation concepts must be found. In-house production residues on the other hand could be collected separately and returned to the initial mixture, but usually do not accumulate to sufficient amounts to be processed with the established recycling facilities economically. Furthermore, {{little is known about the}} interactions arising from the addition of recyclates to a rubber mixture, especially a scientific basis concerning the failure mechanisms of elastomers filled with recycled material is lacking. By the development of a new ambient grinding device ("Reaktruder"), which was specially designed for the recycling of small batches of varietal production residues, an efficient tool for refeeding recyclates into the initial mixture was provided, wherewith recycling rates of 20 % and more have already been realised in practice. Based on the example of a highly filled SBR blend (40 % recyclates), the impacts regarding processing and material behaviour of mixture and vulcanisate caused by the addition of recycled materials are illustrated and the significant factors of the regeneration process underlying these recyclates - the cryogenic grinding versus the ambient grinding technology - are worked out. Finally, the status and perspectives of utilising elastomeric recycling materials in valuable secondary applications are delineated, whereby thermoplastic elastomeric compounds as an economic substitute for classic TPE materials are in the foreground...|$|R
50|$|McKay {{was drafted}} into the {{starting}} line-up as Postecoglou made three changes to the team that handed Kuwait a 4-1 thrashing in the opening game, with injured captain Mile Jedinak replaced by Mark Milligan, and McKay and Jason Davidson came in instead of James Troisi and Aziz Behich. The changes did little to disrupt {{the rhythm of the}} Socceroos, who steadily took control of the game after an early scare, when Raed Ibrahim Saleh's third minute thunderbolt from long range was brilliantly palmed to <b>safety</b> by <b>Mat</b> Ryan. However, the Socceroos, just as they did against Kuwait in the tournament opener in Melbourne, slowly took control of the game {{and by the time the}} clock had ticked past the halfway point in the opening period, Australia were in total command. Tim Cahill, captain for the night in Jedinak's absence twice went close with looping headers before McKay, one of the heroes of Australia's run to the final in Qatar four years ago, put his side in front.|$|R
