40|$|Abstract—Substation Automation System (SAS) {{performance}} has been gained great improvements by implementing the {{high data rate}} <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> based on IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 LE. However, these improvements need to be fully assessed within different circumstances before the scheme can be implemented to real SAS. This paper illustrates a comparisons between the performance testing of a practical (using commercial physical devices) prototype <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> and the simulated model based on the sample value (SV) traffic stream latency using a novel estimation approach. The practical prototype <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> has been implemented based on the IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 LE <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> and the simulated model has been initiated within the OPNET simulation tool models complaint with the IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 LE <b>process</b> <b>bus.</b> By implementing the comparison two benefits have been achieved, from the practical experiments point view it proves the correctness of the design and {{the implementation of the}} IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 LE <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> and the novel time analysis of the SV traffic stream latency. From the OPNET simulation models point view it shows the rightness of IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 LE <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> modeling and also it shows the powerful of the OPNET simulation tools that can model a high data rate real-time system based on the new standard IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 LE.

40|$|New {{substation}} technology, such as non-conventional instrument transformers,and a need {{to reduce}} design and construction costs, are driving the adoption of Ethernet based digital <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> networks for high voltage substations. Protection and control applications can share a <b>process</b> <b>bus,</b> making more efficient use of the network infrastructure. This paper classifies and defines performance requirements for the protocols used in a <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> {{on the basis of}} application. These include GOOSE, SNMP and IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 sampled values. A method, based on the Multiple Spanning Tree Protocol (MSTP) and virtual local area networks, is presented that separates management and monitoring traffic {{from the rest of the}} <b>process</b> <b>bus.</b> A quantitative investigation of the interaction between various protocols used in a <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> is described. These tests also validate the effectiveness of the MSTP based traffic segregation method. While this paper focusses on a substation automation network, the results are applicable to other real-time industrial networks that implement multiple protocols. High volume sampled value data and time-critical circuit breaker tripping commands do not interact on a full duplex switched Ethernet network, even under very high network load conditions. This enables an efficient digital network to replace a large number of conventional analog connections between control rooms and high voltage switchyards...|$|E

40|$|To {{reduce the}} cost of complex and long copper wiring, as well as to achieve {{flexibility}} in signal communications, IEC 61850 part 9 - 2 proposes a <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> communication network between process level switchyard equipments, and bay level protection and control (P 2 ̆ 6 C) Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs). After successful implementation of Ethernet networks for IEC 61850 standard part 8 - 1 (station bus) at several substations worldwide, major manufacturers are currently working on the development of interoperable products for the IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 based <b>process</b> <b>bus.</b> The major technical challenges for applying Ethernet networks at process level include: 1) the performance of time critical messages for protection applications; 2) impacts of <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> Ethernet networks on the reliability of substation protection systems. This work starts with the performance analysis in terms of time critical Sampled Value (SV) messages loss and/or delay over the IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> networks of a typical substation. Unlike GOOSE, the SV message is not repeated several times, and therefore, there is no assurance that each SV message will be received from the <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> network at protection IEDs. Therefore, the detailed modeling of IEC 61850 based substation protection devices, communication protocols, and packet format is carried out using an industry-trusted simulation tool OPNET, to study and quantify number of SV loss and delay over the <b>process</b> <b>bus.</b> The impact of SV loss/delay on digital substation protection systems is evident, and recognized by several manufacturers. Therefore, a sample value estimation algorithm is developed in order to enhance the performance of digital substation protection functions by estimating the lost and delayed sampled values. The error of estimation is evaluated in detail considering several scenarios of power system relaying. The work is further carried out to investigate the possible impact of SV loss/delay on protection functions, and test the proposed SV estimation algorithm using the hardware setup. Therefore, a state-of-the-art <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> laboratory with the protection IEDs and merging unit playback simulator using industrial computers on the QNX hard-real-time platform, is developed for a typical IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 based <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> network. Moreover, the proposed SV estimation algorithm is implemented as a part of bus differential and transmission line distance protection IEDs, and it is tested using the developed experimental setup for various SV loss/delay scenarios and power system fault conditions. In addition to the performance analysis, this work also focuses on the reliability aspects of protection systems with <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> communication network. To study the impact of <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> communication on reliability indices of a substation protection function, the detailed reliability modeling and analysis is carried out for a typical substation layout. First of all, reliability analysis is done using Reliability Block Diagrams (RBD) considering various practical <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> architectures, as well as, time synchronization techniques. After obtaining important failure rates from the RBD, an extended Markov model is proposed to analyze the reliability indices of protection systems, such as, protection unavailability, abnormal unavailability, and loss of security. It is shown with the proposed Markov model that the implementation of sampled value estimation improves the reliability indices of a protection system...|$|E

This standard proposes that the Current and Voltage Transformer (CT, PT) outputs that are presently hard wired to various devices (relays, meters, IED, and SCADA) be digitized at the source and then communicated to those devices using an Ethernet-Based Local Area Network (LAN). The approach is especially interesting for modern optical CT/PT devices that possess high quality information about the primary voltage/current waveforms, but are often forced to degrade output signal accuracy {{in order to meet}} traditional analog interface requirements (5 A/ 120 V).

40|$|IEC 61850 <b>Process</b> <b>Bus</b> {{technology}} {{has the potential}} to improve cost, performance and reliability of substation design. Substantial costs associated with copper wiring (designing, documentation, construction, commissioning and troubleshooting) can be reduced with the application of digital <b>Process</b> <b>Bus</b> technology, especially those based upon international standards. An IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 based sampled value <b>Process</b> <b>Bus</b> is an enabling technology for the application of Non-Conventional Instrument Transformers (NCIT). Retaining the output of the NCIT in its native digital form, rather than conversion to an analogue output, allows for improved transient performance, dynamic range, safety, reliability and reduced cost. In this paper we report on a pilot installation using NCITs communicating across a switched Ethernet network using the UCAIug Implementation Guideline for IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 (9 - 2 Light Edition or 9 - 2 LE). This system was commissioned in a 275 kV Line Reactor bay at Powerlink Queensland’s Braemar substation in 2009, with sampled value protection IEDs 'shadowing' the existing protection system. The results of commissioning tests and twelve months of service experience using a Fibre Optic Current Transformer (FOCT) from Smart Digital Optics (SDO) are presented, including the response of the system to fault conditions. A number of remaining issues to be resolved to enable wide-scale deployment of NCITs and IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 <b>Process</b> <b>Bus</b> technology are also discussed...|$|E
40|$|<b>Process</b> <b>bus</b> {{networks}} are {{the next stage}} {{in the evolution of}} substation design, bringing digital technology to the high voltage switchyard. Benefits of process buses include facilitating the use of Non-Conventional Instrument Transformers, improved disturbance recording and phasor measurement and the removal of costly, and potentially hazardous, copper cabling from substation switchyards and control rooms. This paper examines the role a <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> plays in an IEC 61850 based Substation Automation System. Measurements taken from a <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> substation are used to develop an understanding of the network characteristics of "whole of substation" process buses. The concept of "coherent transmission" is presented and the impact of this on Ethernet switches is examined. Experiments based on substation observations are used to investigate in detail the behavior of Ethernet switches with sampled value traffic. Test methods {{that can be used to}} assess the adequacy of a network are proposed, and examples of the application and interpretation of these tests are provided. Once sampled value frames are queued by an Ethernet switch the additional delay incurred by subsequent switches is minimal, and this allows their use in switchyards to further reduce communications cabling, without significantly impacting operation. The performance and reliability of a <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> network operating with close to the theoretical maximum number of digital sampling units (merging units or electronic instrument transformers) was investigated with networking equipment from several vendors, and has been demonstrated to be acceptable...|$|E
40|$|The use of process-bus technology, {{designed}} {{in accordance with}} the IEC 61850 standard, introduces new opportunities for protection and control. However, before the technology can be deployed, adequate tests are required to prove use of the <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> does not have a detrimental impact on the operating performance of future protection, as expressed in terms of dependability, security and operating speed. The paper will describe an overview of the concepts and benefits of the <b>process</b> <b>bus,</b> and how it affects the design of prototype protection scheme suitable for the mesh-corner of a transmission substation. The operating characteristics of conventional hardwired relays and IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 LE relays applied within a feeder protection scheme, were compared and assessed against conventional type-test results. The scheme includes Ethernet Switches from different manufacturers, configured to allow the assessment of different process-bus architectures. The effect of interchangeability and time offsets were investigated both experimentally and using the OPNET simulator. The scheme includes Merging Units (MU), tested to assess the magnitude of their time offset and how they drift with time and temperature. Causes of incorrect operation were recognized and recommendations presented to avoid the degradation of system performance. Given an appropriate configuration, the performance of a <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> based protection scheme is comparable to a conventional hardwired scheme.

40|$|The primary {{plant and}} {{instrument}} transformers used in transmission substations generally remain in-service for many decades, typically 40 - 70 years, and are renewed only when physically or mechanically life-expired. However, the secondary systems, which include {{protection and control}}, are changed significantly more frequently. The current replacement rate for protection and control on the UK transmission network is about 5 % per annum, i. e. it take approximately 20 years to complete the replacement cycle. However, the asset life of numerical protection and control is often considered to be 15 years, although 10 years may be more realistic due to declining technical knowledge and support, product obsolescence and difficulties in obtaining spares. One way to overcome the problem {{is to develop a}} new architecture for substation secondary systems by deploying technologies such as standard interface modules, the bay <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> and the IEC 61850 communication protocol. IEC 61850 - 9 - 2 <b>Process</b> <b>Bus</b> proposes a local communication network that replaces traditional hard-wiring with serial communication of analogue and binary signals using Ethernet messages. A <b>Process</b> <b>Bus</b> solution reduces the lifetime cost of the system, improves flexibility and functionality and allows substation secondary equipment retrofitting to proceed without the long circuit outages normally required. Once the new technology is installed, secondary equipment renewals, particularly those occurring mid-life in the primary plant lifecycle, can be undertaken in a safer, quicker and easier way with reduced or no outages of primary systems. This enables vendor interoperability and provides easier modification and extension of the secondary schemes; particularly those related to reconfiguration and feature enhancement by software means, rather than the hardwiring changes required in the past. As a precursor to the widespread deployment of IEC 61850 technology within the UK utility AS 3 (Architecture of Substation Secondary System) project, it must be ensured that the reliability and performance of IEC 61850 based protection and control schemes meets or exceeds that of its hardwired SICAP (Substation Information, Control and Protection) predecessors. The aims of the AS 3 Architectures are to allow the replacement of faulty Intelligent Electronic Device (IED) without outages; enable the refurbishment of bay level secondary systems with minimal disruption to the primary system; simplify the isolation procedures between the primary and secondary systems; and reduce the risk of mal-operation. This paper presents the research outcomes of two industry-university projects (Working Stream 1 & 2) aligned to the AS 3 project-WS 1 : Evaluation of the IEC 61850 <b>Process</b> <b>Bus</b> Architecture and Reliability. This was designed to study the AS 3 generic architecture, the <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> reliability and the optimal architecture when considering the life cycle costs and the design of a testing system; WS 2 : Protection Performance Study for Secondary Systems with IEC 61850 <b>Process</b> <b>Bus</b> Architecture.

As {{a part of the}} IEC 61850 series, IEC 61850 Part 9 - 2 was introduced in 2004 and updated to a stable version in 2011 [2]. Part 9 - 2 de nes the specfic communication service mapping for the transmission of sampled values from process equipment [3]. The interface between process equipment and bay level devices is named as Merging Unit (MU) [4]. The 9 - 2 standard is a newly updated standard which has not yet been implemented in large scale.

The project can be also referred as "soft" MU project and consists of two parts. Part A is to implement conventional power system model, instrument transformer, and analog to digital converter [5]. This thesis project is Part B of the light weight merging unit (MU) testing tool project. This project is focusing on developing the 9 - 2 <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> communication interface for the "soft" MU project.

This <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> facilitates the communication of two types of real-time, peer-to-peer communication messages. Generic object-oriented substation event messages, the GOOSE messages and the data sample values, SVs which include the measured currents and voltages. Although this standard describes the message structures and the timing requirements, it does not describe the <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> topology. This work describes different LAN topologies that can be used in the design of <b>process</b> <b>bus</b> for protection systems. It considers the implications of the different structures on the operation of the protection scheme and how these relate to the operational strategy of different operators. It provides an assessment of the data handling capabilities of the system and how the demands of the protection system can be met. Several potential problem areas are identified and analyzed. The probabilistic nature of these systems is discussed and the implications explained. It also provides an insight into the implementation of the alternative topologies and their performance when applied to a transmission line feeder protection and transformer protection. The digital substation and the implementation of IEC 61850 are fundamental to the future of protection ‘relays’. There are many pointers to the potential directions that these systems will develop and the skills required for the protection engineers of the future. This project is seeking to overcome some of the ownership challenges presented by modern protection and control (P&C) devices, which have an inherent short life due to their dependence on modern electronics and software.

40|$|In on-cell type {{touch panel}} structure, screen {{printing}} technology which uses Ag paste on ITO film {{is one of}} the general <b>processes</b> for <b>Bus</b> bar formation. Considering the growing of capacitance touch panel industry and slim design trend, decreasing the Bezel width is necessary. The high technology should be developed for Bus bar printing. Thus, <b>Bus</b> bar formation <b>process</b> was designed by metal deposition and photo lithography in this theory. By applying multiple layers structure process, the comparisons of adhesion strength between ITO films, resistances and pitch width were proceeded. Based on the comparisons, Mo/Al/Mo structure was known as the best for fine pitch <b>bus</b> bar formation <b>process...</b>|$|R

40|$|Fieldbuses are {{traditionally}} {{used in the}} Industrial Automation context to interconnect different devices like PLC (Programmable Logic Controller), sensors, actuators and any other intelligent node at the field level, providing a powerful data communication tool with definite characteristics (e. g. transfer rate, frame length, media access method, security and so on). The broadness of the market that fieldbuses networks are aiming at, {{has led to a}} large number of different protocols, such as CAN (Controller Area Network), ProfiBus (<b>Process</b> Field <b>Bus),</b> Modbus and recently tended toward the use of Industrial Ethernet standards. Powerlink is one of these relatively new fieldbuses, based on standard ethernet. The aim of this paper is just to discuss the potentialities of Powerlink in the Home Automation field...|$|R
