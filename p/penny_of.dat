5|$|The {{history of}} the <b>penny</b> <b>of</b> Great Britain and the United Kingdom from 1714 to 1901, {{the period in which}} the House of Hanover reigned, saw its {{transformation}} from a little-used small silver coin to the bronze piece recognisable to modern-day Britons, by 1901 struck in the tens of millions each year. All bear the portrait of the monarch on the obverse; copper and bronze pennies have a depiction of Britannia on the reverse.|$|E
5|$|Recent studies, {{based on}} the {{discovery}} of a <b>penny</b> <b>of</b> Eanred for which a date no earlier than c. 850 is proposed, suggest a very different dating for ninth-century Northumbrian kings. From this, it is argued that Eardwulf's second reign ended circa 830, rather than in the years soon after 810, and that the reigns of subsequent kings should be re-dated accordingly: Eanred from 830 to 854, Æthelred II from 854 to 862, Rædwulf in 858, and Osberht from 862 to 867.|$|E
5|$|Six medieval coins were recovered, the {{earliest}} {{of which was}} a silver <b>penny</b> <b>of</b> John from the early 13thcentury. Coins from later periods were a silver threepence from the reign of Elizabeth I and a silver penny from Charles I. Only low-denomination coins were found from the 18thcentury and later, including a 10-pfennig piece from Germany dated 1901. Two silver spoons were recovered, one of which was dated 1846 from the hallmark. Objects made from copper alloy were found, many of which were associated with personal adornment and dress including brooches, buckles, and buttons. Also found from this period was a small simple chape (scabbard tip), and part of a skimmer that had been used in the kitchen. Artefacts made from iron, other than nails, were again mainly items of personal adornment and dress. Other identifiable iron items from this period included keys, two possible rowel spurs (spurs with revolving pointed wheels), and about 12horseshoes.|$|E

5|$|The {{museum was}} opened by The King at the Crystal Palace on 9 June 1920. During the opening ceremony, Sir Alfred Mond {{addressed}} the King {{on behalf of}} the committee, saying that 'it was hoped to make the museum so complete that every one {{who took part in the}} war, however obscurely, would find therein an example or illustration of the sacrifice he or she made' and that the museum 'was not a monument of military glory, but a record of toil and sacrifice'. Shortly afterwards the Imperial War Museum Act 1920 was passed and established a Board of Trustees to oversee the governance of the museum. To reflect the museum's Imperial remit the board included appointees of the governments of India, South Africa, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. While the Act was being debated, some Parliamentarians felt that the museum would perpetuate an undesirable war spirit and Commander Joseph Kenworthy MP said that he would 'refuse to vote a <b>penny</b> <b>of</b> public money to commemorate such suicidal madness of civilisation as that which was shown in the late War'. On the August Bank Holiday 1920, the first public holiday since the museum's opening, 94,179 visitors were received, and by November 1921, 2,290,719 had visited the museum.|$|E

25|$|Shortly {{after the}} initial legal {{announcements}} and rmgroup attempt, representatives of Scientology followed through {{with a series of}} lawsuits against various participants on the newsgroup, including Dennis Erlich, in Religious Technology Center v. Netcom. The first raid took place on February 13, 1995. Accompanied by Scientology lawyers, federal marshals made several raids on the homes of individuals who were accused of posting Scientology's copyrighted materials to the newsgroup. Raids took place against Arnaldo Lerma (Virginia), Lawrence A. Wollersheim and Robert <b>Penny</b> <b>of</b> FACTNet (Colorado), and Dennis Erlich (California). Internationally, raids took place against Karin Spaink (The Netherlands) and Zenon Panoussis (Sweden). In addition to filing lawsuits against individuals, Scientology also sued the Washington Post for reprinting one paragraph of the OT writings in a newspaper article, as well as several Internet service providers, including Netcom, Tom Klemesrud, and XS4ALL. It also regularly demanded the deletion of material from the Deja News archive.|$|E

2500|$|... c. 750–14 October 1066: {{the silver}} coinage of sceattas petered out in Southumbrian England {{in the middle}} of the 8th century, to be {{replaced}} by a broader, thinner model of silver coinage modelled on that of contemporary Carolingian coinage. These new coins carried legends naming the king, moneyer and (later) the mint of origin. With various modifications in weight (within the range 1.00g–1.70g) and fineness this format of coinage remained standard for the rest of the period, and indeed silver <b>pennies</b> <b>of</b> similar design remained the basis for the English currency until the 14th century. <b>Pennies</b> <b>of</b> this form were made by English kings from Offa onwards, and also by Viking rulers from the later 9th century.|$|R
500|$|In 1910, it {{was noted}} that the county councils of Essex and Middlesex and the Sheriff's Office of the County of London were all using the same arms. Middlesex County Council decided to apply for a formal grant of arms from the College of Arms, with the {{addition}} of an heraldic [...] "difference" [...] to the attributed arms. Colonel Otley Parry, a Justice of the Peace for Middlesex and author of a book on military badges, was asked to devise an addition to the shield. The chosen addition was a [...] "Saxon Crown", derived from the portrait of King Athelstan on a silver <b>penny</b> <b>of</b> his reign, stated to be the earliest form of crown associated with any English sovereign. The grant of arms was made by letters patent dated 7 November 1910.|$|E
500|$|Harrison found {{frustration}} in this {{next phase of}} the Bangladesh project, as the various record companies associated with the concerts' performers attempted {{to profit from the}} forthcoming release. Chief among these was the Beatles' US distributor, Capitol Records, who delayed issuing the album in the hope of negotiating a royalty rate to cover what they perceived as high distribution costs for the boxed three-record set. Harrison was resolute that Capitol should absorb the costs, just as the Beatles' Apple record label had already paid for the album's lavish packaging and full-colour booklet. All those involved with the concerts and post-production on the live album had given their services for free, in keeping with Harrison's hope that, in Tillery's words: [...] "Every <b>penny</b> <b>of</b> income – from the gate receipts to the profits from an album and a film – would go toward alleviating the suffering." ...|$|E

Contemporary female pop artists Lana Del Rey, Avril Lavigne, Tove Lo, and Sky Ferreira have also cited Love as an influence. Love has frequently {{been recognized as}} the most high-profile contributor of feminist music during the 1990s, and for [...] "subverting [...] mainstream expectations of how a woman should look, act, and sound." [...] According to music journalist Maria Raha, [...] "Hole was the highest-profile female-fronted band of the '90s to openly and directly sing about feminism." [...] Patti Smith, a major influence of Love's, also praised her, saying: [...] "I hate genderizing things... when I heard Hole, I was amazed to hear a girl sing like that. Janis Joplin was her own thing; she was into Big Mama Thornton and Bessie Smith. But what Courtney Love does, I'd never heard a girl do that." ...|$|E

A month later, Henderson appeared to reject the overture, saying, [...] "One day? I don't want one day. I want to play again, man. I don't want nobody's spot... I just want to see if I deserve to be out there. If I don't, just get rid of me, release me.

500|$|Bottomley's {{trial began}} on 19 May 1922, before Mr Justice Salter. As {{the case was}} beginning, Bottomley secured the {{agreement}} of the prosecuting counsel, Travers Humphreys, to a 15-minute adjournment each day so that he, Bottomley, could drink a pint of champagne, ostensibly for medicinal purposes. He faced 24 fraud charges, involving amounts totalling £170,000. The prosecution produced evidence that he had regularly used Victory Bonds Club funds to finance business ventures, private debts and his expensive lifestyle. Bottomley, who defended himself, claimed that his legitimate expenses {{in connection with the}} club, and repayments made to Victory Bonds Club members, exceeded total receipts by at least £50,000: [...] "I swear I have never made a penny out of it. I swear before God that I have never fraudulently converted a <b>penny</b> <b>of</b> the Club's money". The weight of evidence suggested otherwise; Salter's summing up, described by a biographer as [...] "masterly; lucid and concise, yet complete", went heavily against Bottomley, and the jury required only 28 minutes to convict him on {{all but one of the}} charges. He was sentenced to seven years' penal servitude. Humphreys commented later: [...] "It was not I that floored him, but Drink".|$|E

2500|$|According to the Oxford English Dictionary, {{the most}} {{plausible}} etymology is derivation from a late Old English steorling (with (or like) a [...] "little star"), as some early Norman pennies were imprinted {{with a small}} star.
