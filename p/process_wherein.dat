5|$|Fingerspelling {{is a form}} of borrowing, a {{linguistic}} <b>process</b> <b>wherein</b> words from one language are incorporated into another. In ASL, fingerspelling is used for proper nouns and for technical terms with no native ASL equivalent. There are also some other loan words which are fingerspelled, either very short English words or abbreviations of longer English words, e.g. O-N from English 'on', and A-P-T from English 'apartment'. Fingerspelling may also be used to emphasize a word that would normally be signed otherwise.|$|E

40|$|This work {{describes}} {{the extension of}} rhodium-catalysed intermolecular hydroacylation to encompass some tandem catalytic <b>processes,</b> <b>wherein</b> a further catalytic process is enacted on {{the product of an}} intermolecular hydroacylation reaction in “one pot”. Chapter 1 entails an overview of the development of hydroacylation chemistry, with a focus on the different types of catalytic systems which have been used to facilitate this transformation. A brief description of some precedented examples of tandem catalytic processes which include a hydroacylation reaction is also included. Chapter 2 {{describes the}} intermolecular hydroacylation of chelating aldehydes and propargylic alkynes to form γ-hydroxy-α,β-enones, and their subsequent acid-catalysed cyclisation to form substituted furans in a "one-pot" procedure. Additionally, a tandem intermolecular hydroacylation/double-bond isomerisation protocol for the synthesis of 1, 4 -dicarbonyl compounds is detailed, and the subsequent transformation of this class of compounds to heterocycles is included. Chapter 3 focuses on the development of tandem catalytic hydroacylation/reductive <b>processes,</b> <b>wherein</b> a hydroacylation product undergoes a reduction which is catalysed by the hydroacylation catalyst. Chapter 4 describes an attempt to utilise the rhodium-catalysed conjugate addition of arylmetal species to enomes to create a tandem alkyne hydroacylation/conjugate addition process. Chapter 5 encompasses the use of a small range of different solvents in rhodium-catalysed hydroacylation, in an attempt to find higher-boiling alternatives to acetone and a "green" alternative to the commonly used DCE.

30|$|Recently, we {{described}} a novel separation technology for rhamnolipid recovery from fermentative <b>processes</b> <b>wherein</b> rhamnolipid rich, cell-containing foam was directed onto an adsorbent, resulting in rhamnolipid depletion and consequent foam collapse (Anic et al. 2017).

2500|$|The {{industrial}} production of soap involves continuous processes, such as continuous addition {{of fat and}} removal of product. Smaller-scale production involves the traditional batch processes. The three variations are the cold <b>process,</b> <b>wherein</b> the reaction takes place substantially at room temperature; the semi-boiled or [...] "hot process," [...] wherein the reaction takes place near the boiling point; and the fully boiled <b>process,</b> <b>wherein</b> the reactants are boiled at least once and the glycerol is recovered. There are several types of semi-boiled hot process methods, the most common being DBHP (Double Boiler Hot Process) and CPHP (Crock Pot Hot Process). Most soapmakers, however, continue to prefer the cold process method. The cold process and hot process (semi-boiled) are the simplest, and are typically used by small artisans and hobbyists producing handmade decorative soaps. The glycerol remains in the soap and the reaction continues for many days after the soap is poured into molds. The glycerol is left during the hot-process method, but at the high temperature employed, the reaction is practically completed in the kettle, before the soap is poured into molds. This simple and quick process is employed in small factories all over the world.|$|E

[...] Instead, it is a dynamic <b>process</b> <b>wherein</b> persistent painful stimuli can sensitize the system and either make pain management difficult or promote the development of chronic pain. For this reason, preemptive acute pain management may reduce both acute and chronic pain and is tailored to the surgery, the environment in which it is given (in-patient/out-patient) and the individual patient.|$|E

A simulation of collisionless reconnection shows that the toroidal electric field which directly relates to reconnection is generated naturally in the kinetic study, and that a thin dissipation region is formed whose width is a few electron skin depth. Thus, collisionless reconnection is considered to proceed under the electron inertia. ...|$|R
