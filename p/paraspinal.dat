For patients with CLBP, relevant muscles are the lower <b>paraspinals</b> (LPs). Anger-in hostility and anger-out hostility interactions were tested to determine whether particularly reactive groups of patients could be identified with a multivariable profile approach. Methods: Ninety-four patients with CLBP underwent anger recall (ARI) and sadness recall (SRI) interviews, whereas LP and trapezius electromyography and systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure, and heart rate were recorded. They completed anger-in, anger-out, hostility, and trait anger measures. Results: Hierarchical regressions were used to test anger-in hostility and anger-out hostility interactions for physiological changes during the ARI and SRI. A significant anger-in hostility interaction was found for LP change during the ARI (but not SRI) such that high anger-in/high hostility patients evinced the greatest reactivity. Effects for trapezius reactivity were nonsignificant. Significant anger-in hostility interactions were also found for systolic blood pressure and diastolic blood pressure changes during the ARI such that high anger-in/low hostility patients showed the smallest changes. The anger-out hostility interaction for diastolic blood pressure change during ARI was also significant such that high anger-out/low hostility patients showed the smallest changes. All effects remained significant with trait anger controlled. Conclusions: A multivariable profile approach may help identify especially vulnerable patient groups.

The goal of the current study was to explore these more systems-level effects by assessing the effects of a pelvic/lower extremity constraint on the biomechanical response of the lumbar spine in an in-vivo experiment. Twelve participants performed full range of motion, sagittal-plane trunk flexion-extension movements under two conditions: unconstrained stoop movement and pelvic/lower extremity constrained stoop movement (six repetitions in each condition over three days). Kinematics and muscle activities of the trunk and lower extremity muscles were monitored. Results showed a significant effect of pelvic/lower-extremity constraint on a number of lumbar performance measures. Trunk flexion angle was, as expected, significantly reduced with the lower extremity constraints (81 Â° (free stoop) vs. 56 Â° (lower extremity constrained)). At a more local level, there was a 6. 4 % greater peak lumbar flexion angle and a 9. 1 % increase in the lumbar angle at which the trunk extensor musculature demonstrated flexion-relaxation in the constrained stooping condition as compared to the unconstrained stooping condition. Also, the EMG of the L 3 /L 4 <b>paraspinals</b> was greater in the restricted stooping as compared to the free stooping (16. 3 % MVC vs. 15. 1 % MVC).

40|$|Background Electromyography-assisted (EMG-assisted) biomechanical {{models are}} used to {{characterize}} the muscle and joint reaction forces in the lumbar region. However, during a full-range trunk flexion, there is a transition of extension moment from the trunk extensor muscles to the passive tissues of the low back, indicating that the empirical EMG data used to drive these EMG-assisted models becomes less correlated with the extensor moment. The objectives {{of this study were}} to establish the trunk flexion angles at which the passive tissues generate substantial trunk extension moment and to document how these angles change with asymmetry. Methods Participants performed controlled trunk flexionâ€“extension motions in three asymmetric postures. The trunk kinematics data and the electromyographic activity from L 3 - and L 4 -level <b>paraspinals</b> and rectus abdominis were captured. The time-dependent net internal active moment (from an EMG-assisted model) and the net external moment were calculated. The trunk and lumbar angles at which the net internal active moment was less than 70 % of the external moment were found. Findings The trunk flexion angle at which the net internal moment reaches the stated criteria varied as a function of asymmetry of trunk flexion motion with the sagittally symmetric case providing the deepest flexion angle of 38 Â° (asymmetry 15 Â°: 33 Â°; asymmetry 30 Â°: 26 Â°). Interpretation These results indicate that EMG-assisted biomechanical models need to consider the role of passive tissues at trunk flexion angles significantly less than previously thought and these flexion angles vary {{as a function of the}} asymmetry and direction of motion...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the effects of}} ageing on balance corrections induced by sudden stance perturbations in different directions. Effects were examined in biomechanical and electromyographic (EMG) recordings from a total of 36 healthy subjects divided equally into three age groups (20 â€“ 34, 35 â€“ 55 and 60 â€“ 75 years old). Perturbations consisted of six combinations of support-surface roll (laterally) and pitch (forward-backward) each with 7. 5 deg amplitude (2 pure pitch, and 4 roll and pitch) delivered randomly. To reduce stimulus predictability further and to investigate scaling effects, perturbations were at either 30 or 60 deg sâˆ’ 1. In the legs, trunk and arms we observed age-related changes in balance corrections. The changes {{that appeared in the}} lower leg responses included smaller stretch reflexes in soleus and larger reflexes in tibialis anterior of the elderly compared with the young. For all perturbation directions, onsets of balance correcting responses in these ankle muscles were delayed by 20 â€“ 30 ms and initially had smaller amplitudes (between 120 â€“ 220 ms) in the elderly. This reduced early activity was compensated by increased lower leg activity after 240 ms. These EMG changes were paralleled by comparable differences in ankle torque responses, which were initially (after 160 ms) smaller in the elderly, but subsequently greater (after 280 ms). Findings in the middle-aged group were generally intermediate between the young and the elderly groups. Comparable results were obtained for the two different stimulus velocities. Stimulus-induced trunk roll, but not trunk pitch, changed dramatically with increasing age. Young subjects responded with early large roll movements of the trunk in the opposite direction to platform roll. A similarly directed but reduced amplitude of trunk roll was observed in the middle-aged. The elderly had very little initial roll modulation and also had smaller stretch reflexes in <b>paraspinals.</b> Balance-correcting responses (over 120 â€“ 220 ms) in gluteus medius and <b>paraspinals</b> were equally well tuned to roll in the elderly, as in the young, but were reduced in amplitude. Onset latencies were delayed with age in gluteus medius muscles. Following the onset of trunk and hip balance corrections, trunk roll was {{in the same direction as}} support-surface motion for all age groups and resulted in overall trunk roll towards the fall side in the elderly, but not in the young. Protective arm movements also changed with age. Initial arm roll movements were largest in the young, smaller in the middle aged, and smallest in the elderly. Initial arm roll movements were in the same direction as initial trunk motion in the young and middle aged. Thus initial roll arm movements in the elderly were directed oppositely to those in the young. Initial pitch motion of the arms was similar across age groups. Subsequent arm movements were related to the amplitude of deltoid muscle responses which commenced at 100 ms in the young and 20 â€“ 30 ms later in the elderly. These deltoid muscle responses preceded additional arm roll motion which left the arms directed â€˜downhillâ€™ (in the direction of the fall) in the elderly, but â€˜uphillâ€™ (to counterbalance motion of the pelvis) in the young. We conclude that increased trunk roll stiffness is a key biomechanical change with age. This interferes with early compensatory trunk movements and leads to trunk displacements in the direction of the impending fall. The reversal of protective arm movements in the elderly may reflect an adaptive strategy to cushion the fall. The uniform delay and amplitude reduction of balance-correcting responses across many segments (legs, hips and arms) suggests a neurally based alteration in processing times and response modulation with age. Interestingly, the elderly compensated for these â€˜early abnormalitiesâ€™ with enlarged later responses in the legs, but no similar adaptation was noted in the arms and trunk. These changes with age provide an insight into possible mechanisms underlying falls in the elderly...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare muscle latencies for {{patients}} diagnosed with diabetic neuropathy versus healthy controls during a perturbed balance task, with a secondary purpose to distinguish postural control strategies the groups used based on the muscle latencies.

Subjects performed three trials of a perturbed balance task (SOT VI). EMG data were analyzed in MatLab using custom written script. Latency was determined as the time from the perturbation to the time when the smoothed EMG data exceeded two standard deviations above the baseline for at least 50 ms. Dependent variables (latency for each muscle) were evaluated between groups using a paired t-test (SPSS Statistics 20; IBM; Armonk, NY). Single subject (SS) analysis between matched participants was performed using Microsoft Excel. No statistically significant differences (p 3 Ì†e 0. 05) were observed between the groups for any muscle latency. Single subject analysis identified differences (p 3 Ì†c 0. 05) between some matched pairs with no distinguishable trend or pattern observed. Similar balance strategies based on muscle latency were observed between groups.

40|$|Lightweight corsets {{were used}} to produce mid-body stiffening, {{rendering}} the hip and trunk joints practically inflexible. To {{examine the effect of}} this artificially increased stiffness on balance control, we perturbed the upright stance of young subjects (20 - 34 years of age) while they wore one of two types of corset or no corset at all. One type, the "half-corset", only increased hip stiffness, and the other, the "full-corset", increased stiffness of the hips and trunk. The perturbations consisted of combined roll and pitch rotations of the support surface (7. 5 deg, 60 deg/s) in one of six different directions. Outcome measures were biomechanical responses of the legs, trunk, arms and head, and electromyographic (EMG) responses from leg, trunk, and upper arm muscles. With the full-corset, a decrease in forward stabilising trunk pitch rotation compared to the no-corset condition occurred for backward pitch tilts of the support surface. In contrast, the half-corset condition yielded increased forward trunk motion. Trunk backward pitch motion after forwards support-surface perturbations was the same for all corset conditions. Ankle torques and lower leg angle changes in the pitch direction were decreased for both corset conditions for forward pitch tilts of the support-surface but unaltered for backward tilts. Changes in trunk roll motion with increased stiffness were profound. After onset of a roll support-surface perturbation, the trunk rolled in the opposite direction to the support-surface tilt for the no-corset and half-corset conditions, but {{in the same direction as}} the tilt for the full-corset condition. Initial head roll angular accelerations (at 100 ms) were larger for the full-corset condition but in the same direction (opposite platform tilt) for all conditions. Arm roll movements were initially in the same direction as trunk movements, and were followed by large compensatory arm movements only for the full-corset condition. Leg muscle (soleus, peroneus longus, but not tibialis anterior) balance-correcting responses were reduced for roll and pitch tilts under both corset conditions. Responses in <b>paraspinals</b> were also reduced. These results indicate that young healthy normals cannot rapidly modify movement strategies sufficiently to account for changes in link flexibility following increases in hip and trunk stiffness. The changes in leg and trunk muscle responses failed to achieve a normal roll or pitch trunk end position at 700 ms (except for forward tilt rotations), even though head accelerations and trunk joint proprioception seemed to provide information on changed trunk movement profiles over the first 300 ms following the perturbation. The major adaptation to stiffness involved increased use of arm movements to regain stability. The major differences in trunk motion for the no-corset, half-corset and full-corset conditions support the concept of a multi-link pendulum with different control dynamics in the pitch and roll planes as a model of human stance. Stiffening of the hip and trunk increases the likelihood of a loss of balance laterally and/or backwards. Thus, these results may have implications for the elderly and others, with and without disease states, who stiffen for a variety of reasons...|$|R
