50|$|A <b>pivot</b> <b>bracket</b> to the {{top right}} of the count wheel holds a three-pronged fork-like construction. The left tine of the fork keeps the flail in place. The middle tine of the fork is used to {{transmit}} the release from the main arbor of the going train.|$|E
50|$|Slightly {{below the}} centre of the main {{striking}} arbor, a <b>pivot</b> <b>bracket</b> goes {{to the left of the}} mechanism. This holds a lever that is pushed up as the hour pins of the main wheel move upwards. The lever is connected to the bell in the bell tower via a steel wire.|$|E
50|$|After 13 {{years of}} production, 1997 saw the Cherokee receive updated {{exterior}} and interior styling. Both the two- and four-door bodies remained in production, receiving a steel liftgate (replacing the fiberglass one used previously), restyled taillights, additional plastic molding along the doors, {{as well as a}} new front header panel that featured more aerodynamic styling. The spare tire was moved from a rear exterior bumper mount to an interior location due to de-contenting the rear bumper. A new, unique spare tire carrier was invented by Peter Gruich while working for Jeep Special Programs that utilized the trailer hitch bar and a unique <b>pivot</b> <b>bracket</b> and although it was the only external spare tire carrier to pass the full Jeep durability test, it was not offered for sale.|$|E

50|$|The 6T2 Samozhenkov tripod mount was {{designed}} by E. S. Samozhenkov and entered service in 1961 and weighs 7.5 kg. The 6T2 Samozhenkov tripod mount was earlier envisioned for the Nikitin-Sokoiov machine gun that was not adopted by the Soviet Union. All types of ammunition belt boxes are carried and mounted separately. The Rakov device is used for loading ammunition belts. The PK machine gun {{is attached to a}} cradle on the 6T2 Samozhenkov mount. The cradle is hinged to a plug-in swivel equipped with a rack-and-pinion traversing mechanism, and a rod-and-screw elevation mechanism. The traversing mechanism is fitted with stops to limit the field of fire. For anti-aircraft fire or fire against ground targets from a kneeling position the cradle mounts a collapsible pole with a <b>pivoting</b> <b>bracket.</b> The mount features non-digging-in spades — sliding spades affect the accuracy of fire less than a «jumping» tripod with dug-in spades. There is an extra folding spade on the front leg for slippery and moving ground. Hinged tripod legs allow a gunner to fire the machine gun from a prone, a sitting, or a kneeling position.|$|R
50|$|The Drift Sight {{was mounted}} {{to the side}} of the {{aircraft}} using two brackets at the front and back of the sights. The forward <b>bracket</b> had a <b>pivot</b> point, and the rear a screw jack that rotated the entire sighting system up or down around the front <b>bracket's</b> <b>pivot.</b> This allowed fine adjustment of the levelling of the sight during flight to account for changes in trim; after making these adjustments the system was locked in position using wingnuts. This mounting system was common among early British bombsights, notably the Equal Distance Sight that led to the Drift Sight.|$|R
50|$|He {{collaborated with}} Nigel Gresley {{to develop the}} Gresley {{conjugated}} valve gear for 3-cylinder locomotives as fitted to LNER 3 cylinder locomotives. Holcroft continued to develop this mechanism by driving the middle cylinder gear of a steam locomotive from the outside cylinder combination levers, as opposed to Gresley's method of using direct transmission from the front valve spindles. This was necessary {{in the case of}} the SECR / SR Moguls because there was insufficient space for Holcroft's original gear to fit between the cylinder leading wheels and first drivers. Holcroft's method had a number of advantages. The Gresley design of conjugated valve gear suffered from variations in valve events brought about by heat expansion of the valve spindles and flexing of the combination lever - even after considerable re-design of the lever and <b>pivot</b> <b>bracket,</b> affecting the valve events when the locomotive was under way. By using the combination lever assembly to drive the middle cylinder, Holcroft managed to circumvent these problems. Subsequently the problem of flexure and lost motion caused the gear to be removed from the SR Moguls in 1931, to be replaced by a third set of Walschaerts gear, as allowed for in the original design.|$|E
40|$|A {{method and}} {{apparatus}} for the steady-state measurement of {{poloidal magnetic field}} near a tokamak plasma, where the tokamak is configured {{with respect to a}} cylindrical coordinate system having z, phi (toroidal), and r axes. The method is based on combining the two magnetic field principles of induction and torque. The apparatus includes a rotor assembly having a pair of inductive magnetic field pickup coils which are concentrically mounted, orthogonally oriented in the r and z directions, and coupled to remotely located electronics which include electronic integrators for determining magnetic field changes. The rotor assembly includes an axle oriented in the toroidal direction, with the axle mounted on <b>pivot</b> support <b>brackets</b> which in turn are mounted on a baseplate. First and second springs are located between the baseplate and the rotor assembly restricting rotation of the rotor assembly about its axle, the second spring providing a constant tensile preload in the first spring. A strain gauge is mounted on the first spring, and electronic means to continually monitor strain gauge resistance variations is provided. Electronic means for providing a known current pulse waveform to be periodically injected into each coil to create a time-varying torque on the rotor assembly in the toroidal direction causes mechanical strain variations proportional to the torque in the mounting means and springs so that strain gauge measurement of the variation provides periodic magnetic field measurements independent of the magnetic field measured by the electronic integrators...|$|R
