40|$|The Electricity Supply Industry of Australia and its {{consumers}} have gained overwhelming momentum through media personnel and governments {{over the past}} decade. This is due to rigorous challenges prompted by climate change, escalating energy prices, diminishing resources, cyber security and system stability. These influences {{have led to the}} commercialization of new technologies and policies including the National Broadband Network (NBN) and Carbon Tax. However, the motivation to improve the Energy Sector must look well beyond rudimentary renewable energy technologies and smart grid infrastructures such as solar and wind, and provide a robust solution that can cope with Australia's rising population growth and base-load demands. This vision is supported by many electrical utilities worldwide and attempts to couple substation communication standards like the IEC 61850 international protocol with modern grid architectures is at the forefront of research developments. The authors of this paper aim to demonstrate the practical assembly, configuration and testing of a new and innovative <b>portable</b> IEC 61850 <b>testing</b> <b>unit</b> capable of multi-vendor interoperability between different types of Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs). The <b>portable</b> IEC 61850 <b>testing</b> <b>unit</b> serves as a platform for the development, research and training of university students and power system personnel.

25|$|Currently NSW Ambulance {{operates}} six primary rescue {{units in}} rural NSW and employs over 200 rescue officers. The rural stations are located at Rutherford, Tamworth, Singleton, Cowra, Bomaderry and Wagga Wagga. Officers are trained for {{all forms of}} rescue including, road crash, vertical, confined space, swift water, trench, industrial, technical and domestic to name a few. They learn navigation skills, four wheel driving, urban search and rescue, and chemical biological and radiological procedures. Rescue training commences with the recruitment of up to 12 officers, who are selected to undergo a rigorous six week training course. On successful completion of the course, officers are then rostered to rescue units where training continues with a minimum eight hours of structured training per month. Officers are also required to undergo a recertification program.

40|$|Abstract. A {{test program}} was carried {{to assess the}} {{performance}} of "no contact" EMAT probes in thickness evaluation of aged waterwall, super-heater and re-heater tubes. While PZT probes require a point is ground flat before testing, EMAT probes tolerate scale and thick oxide grown due to high temperatures. In addition the aged oxided surface improves the EMAT sensitivity allowing higher echoes and easier thickness evaluation. Procedures to evaluate residual wall thickness were assessed in lab tests. Measures were taken on aged tube samples with nominal thickness 3. 5 - 5 mm. EMAT data were found quite in agreement (± 0. 2 mm) to destructive data. More measures were taken on calibration specimen machined from oxidised tubes to test and compare different wall conditions. The results suggest the industrial exploitation of EMAT thickness testing shall benefit from a deeper understanding on the EMAT probe interaction with clean and oxidised tubes, standardized procedures, and from more efficient pulse/receive units. Conventional UT instruments and EMAT probes can test aged tubes with oxide and scale, but are ineffective on new clean surfaces. <b>Portable</b> flexible <b>test</b> <b>units</b> shall thus be designed to work on both new and aged tubes. Such steps would support the exploitation of EMATs for in-service thickness testing of boiler tubes without oxide removal. It is envisaged that manual and even automated thickness test procedure could be eventually set, based on present UT thickness gauging methods, possibly updating the current UT thickness gauging standard or issuing a dedicated one...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a study of air-conditioning usage in homes in the southeast of England. First part of the study consisted surveying 13 dwellings with air-conditioning for a series of 4 week periods during the summer of 2004. The second part involved testing energy efficiency of “single-split ” and “portable ” air-conditioning units under “in-use” conditions. Data on usage patterns and typical temperature profiles during operation was collected and is presented here. Temperatures at which users switched their units on were, on average, 24 - 25 oC, while typical running times for a single operation were found to be around 5 hours during daytime and 7 hours at night in bedrooms. The study also indicated high occupant satisfaction rates with split-units. An unexpectedly high overall energy efficiency ratio (EER), of 5 - 10, was found for the single-split <b>unit</b> <b>tested</b> during the relatively mild autumn weather. However, a very poor EER, of less than 1, was found for the <b>portable</b> <b>unit</b> <b>tested.</b> Further work is needed to increase the reliability and statistical significance of the results...|$|R
40|$|The {{rapid growth}} of {{electric}} power systems has resulted in many utility companies increasing the investment of Substation Automation Systems (SAS). Free marketing, deregulation and competition has brought about greater restrictive requirements to produce reliable, continuous and good-quality power supply, without {{a significant increase in}} the cost of delivery. For this reason, engineers ever since the development of the earliest microprocessor based Intelligent Electronic Devices (IEDs), have depended on digital superiority to assist personnel in the precise location of faults. The ability of these IEDs to generate an abundance of valuable network data through information exchange of relays, permits power authorities to capitalise in areas such as control, protection, monitoring, fault recording and communication. These Instrumentation and Control (I&C) devices facilitate on-site personnel to accurately establish the fault distance of a transmission line and repair any damage at reduced outage times using Supervisory Control and Data Acquisition (SCADA). However, the system inherent problem endured by the earlier IED models was the fact that the serial bus communication caused a dilemma in the overall response times of the data. This was greatly attributable to the profusion of copper wiring and the lack of compatibility between vendor specific IEDs. To contend with these concerns, a variety of standardised communication paradigms and international protocols were introduced. These incremental additions to the existing substation framework lead to the reduction of copper wiring through the use of fibre optic technologies and interoperability between different vendor specific IEDs via the use of Generic Object Oriented Substation Event (GOOSE) messaging. The majority of in-service substation protocols are still based on MODBUS and DNP 3 standards. These standards however are slowly becoming replaced by Ethernet and fibre optic technologies in the form of the IEC 61850 protocol. This thesis contributes to knowledge in two parts. Part I attempts to construct a <b>portable</b> IEC 61850 <b>testing</b> <b>unit</b> capable of achieving interoperability between three different vendors including ABB, Areva and SEL. The IEC 61850 <b>testing</b> <b>unit</b> is built to serve as a replica of a real-life in-service substation. The rig is equipped with copper, fibre and Ethernet capabilities in order to set and capture GOOSE messages in the form of ICD, CID, SCL and SCD files using logical nodes. Part II of the research develops an innovative fault locator algorithm to determine the distance to fault error in overhead transmission lines. The algorithm is derived using Discrete Fourier Transformation (DFT) and uses a square wave arc model to determine the fault distance, arc resistance, total fault resistance and tower footing resistance. The algorithm is simulated and <b>tested</b> using the <b>portable</b> IEC 61850 <b>testing</b> <b>unit</b> and a 300 km Artificial Transmission Line (ATL) ...|$|R
