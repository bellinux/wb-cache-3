50|$|They {{arrange to}} meet at a hotel, where the sniper is {{positioned}} on a nearby rooftop. A waiter offers them water and Peter is surprised to see it is Eric. With increased confidence, he demands information on Salina and his brother's killer. Kelvin asks that they move to a quieter area. While on the way out, he <b>pokes</b> <b>gun</b> in Peter's back, who finally realizes who his brother's killer really is. Eric pursues and they fight on the hotel roof. The sniper pins Eric down. As they fight for the laptop, Peter falls off the roof, but is saved by a window washing platform, while Kelvin escapes with the laptop. Bobby sees Kelvin leaving and tails him in a taxi.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] he added, [...] "you don't want to aim, <b>poking</b> the <b>gun</b> about. You keep it {{down and}} {{your eyes on the}} bird, until you're ready, and then pitch it up right on the spot first time--it's better with both eyes open, if you can manage it." [...] The gun went in to his {{shoulder}} and Frank heard the striker click, after which the man swung the muzzle half a foot or so. [...] "Say you missed. You've still got the second barrel--" ...|$|R
50|$|The bombs {{had to be}} {{launched}} behind the pusher plate with enough velocity to explode 20-30 meters beyond it every 1.1 seconds. Numerous proposals were investigated, from multiple <b>guns</b> <b>poking</b> {{over the edge of}} the pusher plate to rocket propelled bombs launched from roller coaster tracks, however the final reference design used a simple gas gun to shoot the devices through a hole in the center of the pusher plate.|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{moved in}} here three years ago," [...] {{continued}} Jake, [...] "they met {{me and told}} me to get out. I told 'em I weren't takin' a back track that year. One night they rode down a-whoopin' and a-shoutin', and I natcherly <b>poked</b> my <b>gun</b> out'n the winder and handed out a few to 'em--an' they rode off. Next year quite a little squad o' truck farmers moved into the bend just below, an' we got together and talked it over and agreed to stand by. We planted two more o' them, and they got one on us. They control the courts, and so we have got to fight. They've got a judge that suits 'em now, and this year will be hot--it will, sure." ...|$|R
2500|$|... "In one {{polling place}} a watcher had a <b>gun</b> <b>poked</b> into his ribs {{and a second}} later a thug struck him from behind, laying him out; in another polling place a gangster threw tear powder {{into the eyes of}} the two Socialist watchers just as the voting machine was being opened for {{recording}} of the votes; Socialist watchers were refused the right to note the results tabulated on the machines. Many were ejected and threatened." ...|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the beavers {{come across}} Old Sequoia and, {{thinking}} they've {{hit the jackpot}} of all tree chomping, get ready to chew it down, but Donald <b>pokes</b> the <b>gun</b> in their faces. The beavers try to sneak away, but Donald uses both the barrels of the shotgun to bring them back. Just as Donald is beginning {{to pull the trigger}} to kill the beavers, the telephone in the lookout post rings. After a brief moment of panic and deadlocked decisions (if Donald doesn't answer the phone, he will lose his job, but if he does answer it, it will give the beavers a chance to get away), Donald rushes away to answer the phone. It's the chief ranger calling to make sure Donald is guarding Old Sequoia, but scolds him for answering the phone and orders him to go back to work.|$|R
2500|$|At this point, Thomas {{arrived on}} the field and ordered the 9th Ohio to advance while the 2nd Minnesota {{maintained}} heavy fire from the front line. Col. Robert L. McCook, commanding Thomas's 3rd Brigade, wrote that the lines were so close that the [...] "enemy and the Second Minnesota were <b>poking</b> their <b>guns</b> through the same fence." [...] When the 9th Ohio turned the Confederate left flank, the battle was decided. The Confederate troops broke and ran back toward Mill Springs in a disorderly rout, and Crittenden, who was rumored to be drunk during the battle, was powerless to stop them. They frantically crossed to {{the south side of the}} Cumberland, abandoning twelve valuable artillery pieces, 150 wagons, more than 1,000 horses and mules, and all of their dead and wounded. The retreat continued all the way to Chestnut Mound, Tennessee, (near Carthage), about [...] due east of Nashville.|$|R
5000|$|On July 18, 2002, {{there was}} a robbery {{incident}} inside the house of Parsons. Six men armed with pistols barged into the house in suburban Marikina as the maid opened the gate. The intruders then tied everyone up (Parsons {{with his wife and}} his maid). One of them <b>poked</b> a <b>gun</b> on Parsons' head but it did not go off. The men took the money, jewelry, cellular phones and a video camera. They then entered the girl's bedroom, tied them up and started undressing them. Parsons tricked the intruders into believing a police patrol would be having breakfast at his house, prompting the gunmen to panic and leave. The maid then untied herself and that of Parsons. Parsons then retrieved his [...]45-caliber pistol and chased the gunmen, who were boarding a passenger jeepney, a public transit vehicle they commandeered. A shootout occurred and the actor killed the two men.|$|R
50|$|Meanwhile, the Belgian Army {{became a}} growing threat to German {{communications}} {{as the battle}} shifted northward. The Germans made plans on 28 September to capture the port of Antwerp and crush the Belgian forces. This important maritime city was encircled by an obsolete fortress system that could not withstand even 6-inch shells. An outer ring of eighteen forts ranged from seven to nine miles from the city, an inner ring from one to two miles. Each fort had two machine guns, but lacked telephone communications and means for observing gunfire. One 6-inch <b>gun</b> <b>poked</b> out at each mile; none of these forts had high explosive projectiles or smokeless gunpowder and several thousand surrounding acres had been cleared to provide unobstructed fields of fire.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{polling places}} of the 4th {{assembly}} district...were {{scenes of the}} most disgraceful election stealing."In all cases the Tammany election officials were falnked by a collection of gangsters who aided in the intimidation of voters who were being deprived of their votes. The Socialist poll watchers who made protests over the procedure were brutalized. The voters were threatened, brow-beaten, and flustered. Notorious gangsters, gunmen, and pimps were on hand in full force taking orders from the Tammany leaders...."In one polling place a watcher had a <b>gun</b> <b>poked</b> into his ribs and a second later a thug struck him from behind, laying him out; in another polling place a gangster threw tear powder {{into the eyes of}} the two Socialist watchers just as the voting machine was being opened for recording of the votes; Socialist watchers were refused the right to note the results tabulated on the machines. Many were ejected and threatened." ...|$|R
5000|$|The UN High Commissioner for Human Rights Navi Pillay accused Hamas militants {{of violating}} {{international}} humanitarian law by [...] "locating rockets within schools and hospitals, or even launching these rockets from densely populated areas." [...] The European Union condemned Hamas, and in particular condemned [...] "calls on the civilian population of Gaza to provide themselves as human shields." [...] France24 confirmed the use of urban warfare, filming a rocket launch pad which {{was placed in a}} civilian area next to a hotel where international journalists were staying. Peter Stefanovic of Australia’s Channel Nine News tweeted that rockets had been fired [...] "over our hotel from a site about two hundred metres away. So a missile launch site is basically next door.” Janis Mackey Frayer of Canada's CTV reported seeing a Hamas gunman dressed in a woman's headscarf with a [...] "tip of a <b>gun</b> <b>poked</b> out from under cloak.” Harry Fear reporting for Russia Today tweeted that rockets were fired from near his hotel. His tweet was later deleted, and he was expelled from Gaza. Several journalists who alleged Hamas use of human shields and rocket locations close to civilian infrastructure reported being threatened by Hamas.|$|R
5000|$|Elmer Fudd then appears {{and notices}} rabbit tracks that Daffy left, leading to Bugs' hole. He <b>pokes</b> his <b>gun</b> into the hole, threatens to blast him {{out if he}} doesn't come out, and then follows through on his threat. Bugs Bunny, however, appears {{out the other side}} and begins a {{conversation}} with Elmer about rabbit season. When Elmer fails to realize that Bugs is a rabbit, Daffy emerges from his hiding spot, disgusted by this, and points out that Bugs is a rabbit, which the latter confirms, asking if Elmer would prefer to shoot him now or wait until he gets home. Daffy eagerly shouts for the first option and Bugs rebukes him, [...] "You keep out of this! He doesn't have to shoot you now!" [...] Daffy angrily asserts, [...] "He does so have to shoot me now!" [...] and outright demands that Elmer do so. Elmer looks confused for a few seconds, but complies as Daffy sticks his tongue out at Bugs. The shot dislocates his beak {{to the back of his}} head, and Daffy replaces his beak before requesting to run through what they just said again. Bugs complies, and upon reaching Bugs' word swap, Daffy calls him out on [...] "pronoun trouble", saying [...] "It's not 'he doesn't have to shoot you now.' It's 'he doesn't have to shoot me now.' WELL, I SAY HE DOES HAVE TO SHOOT ME NOW!" [...] Subsequently, Daffy commands Elmer to shoot him again, which he does. Daffy fixes his beak again and is about to rant at Bugs before realizing that he may fall into the trap again. He decides to speak to Elmer instead, confirming that he is a hunter and that it is rabbit season. Bugs interjects, asking what Elmer would do if Daffy was a rabbit. Daffy repeats the question angrily, and has enough time to realize what he said (looking towards the camera and piteously saying [...] "Not again") before Elmer shoots him. Daffy fixes his bill once more and laughs sarcastically at Bugs for his trick.|$|R
