60|$|It must be understood, however, by the reader, that a republic, as {{contemplated}} {{and intended}} by Otanes in this speech, was entirely {{different from the}} mode of government which that word denotes at the present day. They had little idea, in those times, of the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>representation,</b> by which the thousand separate and detached communities of a great empire can choose delegates, who are to deliberate, speak, and act {{for them in the}} assemblies where the great governmental decisions are ultimately made. By this <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>representation,</b> the people can really all share in the exercise of power. Without it they can not, for it is impossible that the people of a great state can ever be brought together in one assembly; nor, even if it were practicable to bring them thus together, would it be possible for such a concourse to deliberate or act. The action of any assembly which goes beyond a very few hundred in numbers, is always, in fact, the action exclusively of the small knot of leaders who call and manage it. Otanes, therefore, as well as all other advocates of republican government in ancient times, meant that the supreme power should be exercised, not by the great mass of the people included within the jurisdiction in question, but by such a portion of certain privileged classes as could be brought together in the capital. It was such a sort of republic as would be formed in this country if the affairs of the country at large, and the municipal and domestic institutions of all the states, were regulated and controlled by laws enacted, and by governors appointed, at great municipal meetings held in the city of New York.|$|E
60|$|Now {{take it in}} {{the other}} point of view, and let us suppose their <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>representation</b> {{according}} to contribution, that is according to riches, to be well imagined, {{and to be a}} necessary basis for their republic. In this their third basis they assume that riches ought to be respected, and that justice and policy require that they should entitle men, in some mode or other, to a larger share in the administration of public affairs; it is now to be seen how the Assembly provides for the preëminence, or even for the security of the rich, by conferring, in virtue of their opulence, that larger measure of power to their district which is denied to them personally. I readily admit (indeed, I should lay it down as a fundamental principle) that in a republican government, which has a democratic basis, the rich do require an additional security above what is necessary to them in monarchies. They are subject to envy, and through envy to oppression. On the present scheme it is impossible to divine what advantage they derive from the aristocratic preference upon which the unequal representation of the masses is founded. The rich cannot feel it, either as a support to dignity or as security to fortune: for the aristocratic mass is generated from purely democratic principles; and the prevalence given to it in the general representation has no sort of reference to or connection with the persons upon account of whose property this superiority of the mass is established. If the contrivers of this scheme meant any sort of favor to the rich, in consequence of their contribution, they ought to have conferred the privilege either on the individual rich, or on some class formed of rich persons (as historians represent Servius Tullius to have done in the early constitution of Rome); because the contest between {{the rich and the poor}} is not a struggle between corporation and corporation, but a contest between men and men,--a competition, not between districts, but between descriptions. It would answer its purpose better, if the scheme were inverted: that the votes of the masses were rendered equal, and that the votes within each mass were proportioned to property.|$|E

60|$|Richard dying without lawful issue, the {{succession}} to his dominions again became dubious. They consisted of various territories, governed by various rules of descent, {{and all of}} them uncertain. There were two competitors: the first was Prince John, youngest son of Henry the Second; the other was Arthur, son of Constance of Bretagne, by Geoffrey, the third son of that monarch. If the right of consanguinity were only considered, the title of John to the whole succession had been indubitable. If the right of representation had then prevailed, which now universally prevails, Arthur, as standing in the place of his father, Geoffrey, had a solid claim. About Brittany there was no dispute. Anjou, Poitou, Touraine, and Guienne declared in favor of Arthur, on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>representation.</b> Normandy was entirely for John. In England the point of law had never been entirely settled, but it seemed rather inclined to the side of consanguinity. Therefore in England, where this point was dubious at best, the claim of Arthur, an infant and a stranger, had little force against the pretensions of John, declared heir by the will of the late king, supported by his armies, possessed of his treasures, and {{at the head of a}} powerful party. He secured in his interests Hubert, Archbishop of Canterbury, and Glanville, the chief justiciary, and by them the body of the ecclesiastics and the law. It is remarkable, also, that he paid court to the cities and boroughs, which is the first instance of that policy: but several of these communities now happily began to emerge from their slavery, and, taking advantage of the necessities and confusion of the late reign, increased in wealth and consequence, and had then first attained a free and regular form of administration. The towns new to power declared heartily in favor of a prince who was willing to allow that their declaration could confer a right. The nobility, who saw themselves beset by the Church, the law, and the burghers, had taken no measures, nor even a resolution, and therefore had nothing left but to concur in acknowledging the title of John, whom they knew and hated. But though they were not able to exclude him from {{the succession}}, they had strength enough to oblige him to a solemn promise of restoring those liberties and franchises which they had always claimed without having ever enjoyed or even perfectly understood. The clergy also took advantage of the badness of his title to establish one altogether as ill founded. Hubert, Archbishop of Canterbury, in the speech which he delivered at the king's coronation, publicly affirmed that the crown of England was of right elective. He drew his examples in support of this doctrine, not from the histories of the ancient Saxon kings, although a species of election within a certain family had then frequently prevailed, but from the history of the first kings of the Jews: without doubt in order to revive those pretensions which the clergy first set up in the election of Stephen, and which they had since been obliged to conceal, but had not entirely forgotten.|$|E

5000|$|Solana’s thought {{contained}} a strong anti-tyrannical thread, embodied {{already in the}} concept of a moderated monarchy; he also largely ignored his rival to the title of key party pundit, Víctor Pradera, whose thought endorsed dictatorial solutions. During the Republic Solana produced a treaty on the right to resist and to overthrow a despotic regime. However, an entirely new element introduced to Traditionalism was spelling out its incompatibility with totalitarian concepts. He went to great lengths denouncing Soviet, Fascist and Nazi regimes, claiming that the tyranny and deification of state which they introduce, combined with excessive nationalism, render them [...] "irreconcilable Traditionalist enemies". Manuscript of his key theoretical work, completed in 1938, in its epilogue {{contained a}} veiled warning to Franco; it noted that Traditionalists would never support a regime based on foreign ideas, lamented [...] "espantosa guerra civil que desangra a la Patria" [...] and feared [...] "que tanta sangre y tantas ruínas y tantas desgracias" [...] might turn useless.Like some Traditionalists, Solana welcomed democracy though he understood it simply as a <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>representation.</b> Other a bit unorthodox piece of his concepts were references to [...] "derechos del hombre", praise of religious and educational liberties (though [...] "rectamente entendida" [...] and [...] "para fínes lícitos"), notes that a human was the end and not the means and that [...] "sociedad es para el hombre y no al revés". Some of his writings contain highly exalted passages on exceptional role of the Spaniards, comments resemblant of typical nationalist discourse and quite atypical for Traditionalism. Finally, as member of the movement which prided itself on belligerent past Solana was unusually bold in condemnation of [...] "espiritú de violencia"; though he applied it mostly to foreign ideas, he was also careful to note that notorious [...] "Traditionalist intransigency" [...] had its limits. Last but not least, he considered himself a Traditionalist rather than a Carlist.|$|E
5000|$|In {{line with}} the {{prevailing}} Traditionalist reading, representation should be channeled by cuerpos intermedios along what is usually considered a corporative pattern; Traditionalists preferred to name it an organic representation. Differently defined intermediary bodies were free {{to find their own}} way of appointing their representatives along differently defined structural patterns. This mechanism was pitted against representation exercised by means of individual popular suffrage, a faulty Liberal concept invented to serve either bourgeoisie or [...] "plebe", exploiting atomization of individuals, unavoidably leading to corruption, partidocracía, oligarchy and caciquismo while failing to represent social interests properly. However, some Traditionalists embraced an idea of non-corporative elections, though usually highly limited by census requirements. The bodies usually named as those gathering representatives of the society were first of all bi-cameral Cortes and then Royal Council.A somewhat unclear question is this of Traditionalism and democracy. Understood in presently prevailing terms the two are clearly incompatible, as the former identified divine order and the latter the people as a source of public power. Also in terms of praxis most Traditionalists generally rejected democracy as unstable and non-functional system and at the level of popular public discourse Traditionalist press have usually denigrated democracy. However, some key theorists admitted that it might be operational at the lowest community level, e.g. in case of a municipio. Moreover, few - at times dubbed [...] "democrats to the core" [...] - did not reject democracy, understanding it as a <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>representation</b> and legal recognition; according to this reading, popular parliamentary elections were rejected as not genuinely democratic. Similarly vague is Traditionalist approach to dictatorship. In principle fiercely hostile to tyrannical or despotic regimes exercising power beyond appropriate limits, some Traditionalist theorists acknowledged the sovereign right to coerce and agreed - usually as a last resort applicable in extremis - to dictatorial rule. Some have even developed own theories of dictatorship; the one of the 1840s was resemblant of a praetorian praxis, while the one of the 1920s was far closer to an authoritarian paradigm.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This article {{consists}} of two parts. The main objectives of Part 1 are to postulate a new <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>representation</b> invariance (PRI), and to refine the unified field model of four interactions, derived using the principle of interaction dynamics (PID). Intuitively, PID takes the variation of the action functional under energy-momentum conservation constraint, and PRI requires that physical laws be independent of representations of the gauge groups. One important outcome of this unified field model is a natural duality between the interacting fields (g,A,Wa, Sk), corresponding to graviton, photon, inter-mediate vector bosons W ± and Z and gluons, and the adjoint bosonic fields (Φµ, φ 0, φaw, φ k s). This duality predicts two Higgs particles of similar mass with one due to weak interaction and the other due to strong interaction. The uni-fied field model can be naturally decoupled to study individual interactions, leading to 1) modified Einstein equations, giving rise to a unified theory fo...|$|E
