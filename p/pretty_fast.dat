25|$|Alan Davidson led {{their attack}} {{in this and}} other Tests. He had a {{beautiful}} action, run-up and delivery and, besides being <b>pretty</b> <b>fast,</b> he made the ball swing into the batsmen very late. Often, our batsmen {{had to make a}} hurried stroke against him because they thought it would not swing. Then when they got used {{to the fact that it}} did, he would send one down that didn't! But we found that the great thing about Alan was to keep him from getting a wicket in his first four or five overs. If this happened, he was inclined to lose enthusiasm and with it went his fire. Unfortunately for us, this seldom happened.|$|E
500|$|After the game, Brandon Graham, {{who played}} with Robinson at Michigan in 2009 and also played with Michael Vick on the Philadelphia Eagles told reporters that Robinson is even quicker than Vick: [...] "Both of them are <b>pretty</b> <b>fast,</b> I just think Vick's older; he's not really that fast like how Shoelace is. I think Shoelace is more quick than Vick, but Vick, he gets away. He's <b>pretty</b> <b>fast</b> still. I think Shoelace might have got him by a couple steps." ...|$|E

She speeds off trying to beat Ferris home. Ferris makes it home first, to find Rooney waiting for him outside. Jeannie races into the house as their mother talks to their father about her {{behavior}} today. Jeannie discovers Rooney threatening Ferris, and has a change of heart; she tells {{him that she was}} just helping to return Ferris from the hospital, and shows Rooney his wallet that she had found from his earlier break-in attempts. Rooney flees while Ferris thanks Jeannie and rushes back to his bedroom to greet his parents while feigning his waning illness. As they leave, Ferris reminds the audience, [...] "Life moves <b>pretty</b> <b>fast.</b> If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it." ...|$|E

500|$|Although {{developers}} billed {{a realistic}} atmosphere, reviewers criticized {{that aspect of}} the game. [...] "I understand the emphasis for this game is on the gameplay. However, a little more effort {{could have been made}} with the visuals and particularly in the audio department. Crowds will applaud your great plays and touchdowns, but the essence of a football game revolves around atmosphere. Here, it’s completely lacking," [...] said Acevedo in his review. The game was also criticized for its lack of play-by-play and poor audio. [...] "There's no witty banter between a play-by-play announcer and color commentator (although some would argue that Madden's audio presentation's been seriously lacking the past few iterations), there's no stadium music aside from “Boom” by P.O.D. being played during kickoffs (it gets old <b>pretty</b> <b>fast),</b> and the stadium crowds are basically an afterthought," [...] added Doug Aamoth of Techland. After the patch, the song only comes up for the first kick-off and the kick-off of the second half.|$|E

Carmichael took Brosnan to see a James Bond film for the first time (Goldfinger), at the age of 11. Later moving back to London, Brosnan was educated at Elliott School, a state {{comprehensive}} school in Putney, southwest London, now known as Ark Putney Academy. Brosnan has spoken about the transition from Ireland to England and his education in London; [...] "When you go to a very large city, a metropolis like London, as an Irish boy of 10, life suddenly moves <b>pretty</b> <b>fast.</b> From a little school of, say, seven classrooms in Ireland, to this very large comprehensive school, with over 2,000 children. And you're Irish. And they make you feel it; the British have a wonderful way of doing that, and I had a certain deep sense of being an outsider."

500|$|The band {{began work}} on the album two years before {{entering}} the studio to record on April 1, 2000. During this period, the group members met {{five days a week}} to write new songs and rehearse old ones, with Tre Cool observing, [...] "We've been practicing and writing songs and playing them and playing them and writing new songs and playing them and playing them... People think we're off in Hawaii kicking back and shit, but we're in Oakland playing our jams." [...] The album was recorded at Studio 880 in Oakland. Cool noted of the band's work ethic in the studio, [...] "We're not really sprinting. We're working at the same pace, but it's a <b>pretty</b> <b>fast</b> pace for recording. We're faster than every other band, pretty much. That's what I've been told." [...] With the record, the band aimed to construct a solid list of tracks where [...] "each song could be its own album". The group also made sure to make each song [...] "well thought out and well placed" [...] with regard to the album's track listing.|$|E

He was delighted to take the victory: [...] "It's one thing to get back to Victory Lane, but to do it at Talladega wow." [...] "I've wanted to win here for so long. This hasn't been one of my favorite places on the fan side. People haven't always liked me here. But this was for those guys up in the stands today." [...] Second-place finisher Menard was pleased with his result, saying he had a good car throughout the duration of the race: [...] "Car had speed in it all day. Didn't make any chassis adjustments, just did a little bit of air pressure after the first run to free it up. It was just all track position really." [...] In the post-race press conference, third-place finisher Ragan said that he felt that he had a car which could have secured the victory under the right circumstances, but believed it was a good day for his team: [...] "We always seem to be <b>pretty</b> <b>fast</b> here on the superspeedway track, so that just goes to show you how much effort our Roush Fenway team is putting into this program." ...|$|E
500|$|The album {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from critics upon its release. [...] Duncan Strauss of the Los Angeles Times described the album as [...] "hit-and-miss"; while he praised the [...] "tender tunefulness" [...] of [...] "Behind the Sun", {{he felt that}} the majority of the songs [...] "wear pretty thin <b>pretty</b> <b>fast,</b> further suggesting that this is a band that's in command on stage—but in trouble in the studio." [...] Bill Meredith of AllMusic observed that [...] "the energy of having these four friends from Los Angeles back together jumps out of the opening anthem 'Fight Like a Brave' and the experimental 'Funky Crime' ... Slovak and Irons brought things to the Chili Peppers that no one else ever has." [...] Blaine Sayers of Consequence of Sound praised Slovak's guitar work on the album, saying that [...] "Slovak proves with these tracks that he was not just a funk guitarist, but he could rock with the best thrash metal bands of the 80s as well." [...] In The Rolling Stone Album Guide (2004), Greg Kot was less impressed, writing that the album was a minor improvement over the band's last two efforts, but felt that the group's offbeat humor detracted from the album: [...] "The California quartet brings a modicum of structure to The Uplift Mofo Party Plan, but their humor—as their famous 'party on your pussy' chorus demonstrates—wouldn't merit an audience in a high-school locker room." ...|$|E
2500|$|The music {{came from}} Brian Wilson's first {{psychedelic}} experience. He was quoted saying in 1986, [...] " [...] something I'm {{very proud of}} in a sense because it represents the Beach Boys really greatest record production we’ve ever made. It goes back to 1965 when I was sitting in my apartment, wondering {{how to write a}} song about girls, because I love girls. I mean, everybody loves girls." [...] He added in 2007, [...] "I was thinking about the music from cowboy movies. And I sat down and started playing it, bum-buhdeeda, bum-buhdeeda. I did that for about an hour. I got these chords going. Then I got this melody, it came <b>pretty</b> <b>fast</b> after that." [...] Inspiration came from the rhythm of [...] "Jesu, Joy of Man's Desiring". In 2015, he explained: [...] "'California Girls' had that beat — it's called a shuffle beat — and that's definitely a Bach influence." ...|$|E

When the Fast Co. rig blows a tire, Black, jealous of Fiasco's money and Lonnie's popularity, refuses to help change the tire. Adamson flies in his private plane with Candy Ellison (Judy Foster) the <b>pretty</b> new <b>Fast</b> Co. ad girl. At the Big Sky meet, Adamson takes a {{backhander}} from the organizer. He says that the fans come to see Lonnie, so while the dragster is being repaired he will replace Billy in the Funny Car. Lonnie doesn't like the idea. Billy likes it less, blaming Lonnie's ego. Lonnie's first ever Funny Car run is against Black, who is angry at the driver switch, especially when he loses the race. Billy finds some compensation in the attractive presence of Candy.|$|R

[...] Hagaman also noted the [...] "classic rock influences", [...] "rawking, rampant guitar solos", and [...] "the odd falsetto hit, male harmonies and a song-writing touch of ecstatic harmonic highs," [...] reminiscent of The Darkness. Awarding the album 4 out of 5 stars and Album of the Week for Radar Radio, Declan Dickinson praised the album's [...] "mixture of dirty, grungy guitar riffs with soaring vocal harmonies provided by the group's wealth of singing talent", and asserted that [...] "whether they realise it or not, Papa vs <b>Pretty</b> are <b>fast</b> becoming a part of the Australian Rock music canon." ...|$|R

5000|$|Downfall of Gaia's third studio album, Aeon Unveils the Thrones of Decay, was {{released}} on 11 November 2014 through Metal Blade. The songs were mostly created in two weeks of rehearsing and writing after the band's new drummer, Michael Kadnar from New York City who recently replaced Hannes, flew to Germany in March, while vocals were added a month later after Goncalves wrote the lyrics. The final version was recorded at '79 Sound Studio, mixed at Atomic Garden Studio and mastered at Audiosiege Studio in Portland, Oregon. Describing the record, Goncalves stated that it [...] "is a concept album about time {{and all of its}} relentless sides ... dealing with the darker sides of life and the struggles everyone has to fight on a day to day basis" [...] and while [...] "songs on band's previous records grew slowly and things took their time, this time they tried to focus on <b>pretty</b> straight, <b>fast</b> and aggressive song structures." [...] In support of the album, they toured the East Coast and the Midwest of the US in January/February 2015. and Europe with fellow German extreme metal band Der Weg Einer Freiheit in March/April 2015. Further tours followed, including through Japan and Australia, only ending {{towards the end of the}} year when the band began working on their next album.|$|R
40|$|Our sensory systems perform <b>pretty</b> {{successful}} and <b>fast</b> in processing the complex scenarios of sensory stimuli that we encounter during every day tasks. It {{seems likely that}} over evolutionary timescales our senses adapted to the statistical regularities inherent to the every day stimuli {{that we have to}} analyze. This leads to the hypothesis that various aspects of sensory processing are ‘optimal’ for extracting information from natural input; vice versa, one should be able to understand the organization of sensory processing given the statistical regularities of natural stimuli and given the right optimization principle. In this talk I will address this question by examining the processing of single neurons in the primary visual cortex, so called simple and complex cells. Recent work showed how the processing of these cells can be understood as efficient and redundancy reducing codes of natural visual features—called sparse and slow feature codes. Especially, by applying these optimality principles to artificial networks processing natural visual scenes, properties of simple and complex cells can be reproduced. Besides vision, other senses perform similar analysis of complex stimuli, posing the question whether different senses can be understood using similar functional principles. Using audition as an example, it can be shown that the same optimality principles deduced from the visual cortex do a good job in explaining the processing of auditory neurons. This suggests that, on a more abstract level, different sensory systems perform similar operations that are defined by certain optimality criteria and the statistical properties of natural sensory stimuli. Especially, the early sensory processing in different sensory systems seems to be based on a small set of common computational principles that links properties of the outside world to properties of neuronal circuits...|$|R
