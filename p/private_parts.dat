25|$|In ritual fashion, the Indians scalped, stripped, and {{mutilated}} the soldiers' bodies before leaving.

The two civilians, Wheatley and Fisher, had had their faces smashed into bloody pulp, and Wheatley had been pierced {{by more than a}} hundred arrows. The last trooper to die in the battle may have been Adolph Metzger, a bugler who used his instrument as a weapon until it was battered shapeless. Metzger was the only soldier whose dead body was not mutilated. The Indians covered him with a buffalo hide. Some historians interpreted that as a tribute to his bravery in standing alone against several armed enemies.|$|E
25|$|Corporal {{punishment}} is prohibited in schools {{but it is}} still widely practiced. Both students (34%) and teachers (25%) reported corporal punishment by teachers and parents against girls in school. Apart from corporal punishment, mainly older boys beat up girls to harass and degrade them or in retaliation for a refusal to initiate a sexual relationship. Male students might snatch girls' school materials, intimidate them and threaten to harm them as a way of forcing them into sexual relationships. Parents could take girls' property as a disciplinary measure. School teachers were reported to humiliate and verbally abuse girls in class and this was worse if the girl was attractive. In the school community, girls most frequently suffered verbal abuse aimed at undermining their self-esteem. Other abuse involved touching <b>private</b> <b>parts</b> and punishment for refusing sexual requests. School girls might experience various forms of seduction before being subjected to sexually violent acts. This could be from school boys, teachers or rich sugar daddies who waited outside school gates.|$|E

According to Publishers Weekly, 1.39 million copies were sold in 1995 alone which ranked it the year's third best-selling book. As with <b>Private</b> <b>Parts,</b> Stern's book signings attracted thousands.

25|$|Another {{factor is}} the level of privacy to which a person can be assured - for example, some parts of a home may be seen from the outside or there may be a {{possibility}} of others walking in. The expectation of privacy may be confined to the home and sometimes the backyard. Inside the home, it may be restricted to the bedroom or just the bathroom. If a person is not alone, their comfort in removing clothing in front of another person will generally depend on the nature of a relationship of those who jointly occupy the same private space, as well as the attitudes of others to nudity. Besides the nature of a relationship, attitudes and incidences of nudity will also depend on the level of inhibition that each person has, as well as the level of privacy to which that they can be assured. Sometimes a person may unintentionally intrude on a person who is in the nude, which may lead to embarrassment of {{one or both of the}} people. The nude person may seek to quickly cover their <b>private</b> <b>parts,</b> while the clothed person may turn away, but this also depends on cultural differences and the relationship of the people.|$|E
