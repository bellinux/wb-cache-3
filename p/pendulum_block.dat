40|$|In {{order to}} improve the {{precision}} of vision inspection system for micro accessory, edge detection technique of micro accessory was studied. Firstly, the imaging features of the micro accessory inspection system were analyzed. Fraunhofer diffraction happens, because the light wave is restricted by microscope. Secondly, optical characteristics of micro images were analyzed. The gray curve of the micro image edge does not change with the different inspected accessories. The threshold function of the edge detection was put forward according to the Analysis of dividing rule diffraction fringe. Finally, the threshold function of the edge detection was applied to gauge block and <b>pendulum</b> <b>block.</b> Experimental {{results indicate that the}} maximum error of the gauge block inspection is 0. 22 µm and the maximum error of the <b>pendulum</b> <b>block</b> inspection is 0. 28 µm. The measuring precision of figures is up to sub-pixel and the measuring precision of micro accessories is up to submicron. It can satisfy the system requirements of the micro accessory inspection...|$|E

In the competition, two alliances, each {{consisting of two}} teams of high school students, compete to score blocks in plastic crates atop alliance-colored <b>pendulums.</b> <b>Block</b> Party! is the ninth FTC challenge.|$|R
