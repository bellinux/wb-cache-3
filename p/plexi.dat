5|$|McKagan first formed Loaded {{to be his}} touring band {{in support}} of his {{unreleased}} solo album Beautiful Disease. The first lineup included Michael Barragan (formerly of <b>Plexi),</b> Dez Cadena (formerly of Black Flag), and Taz Bentley (formerly of The Reverend Horton Heat). The band disbanded before the end of 1999. After working on new material with drummer Geoff Reading, Loaded was reformed in 2001, adding guitarist Mike Squires and Jeff Rouse to the line-up, though both were briefly replaced by guitarist Dave Kushner (Velvet Revolver, formerly of Wasted Youth and Electric Love Hogs) and bassist George Stuart Dahlquist (formerly of Asva and Burning Witch) in 2002.|$|E
25|$|McKagan's second solo album, Beautiful Disease, was {{intended}} to be released in 1999, but became lost in the legal shuffle of the merge between Geffen Records and Interscope Records. McKagan was dropped from Geffen's roster, and subsequently lost all commercial rights to release the record. For the tour supporting his ill-fated solo album, he formed the band Loaded, which consisted of McKagan on bass and vocals, Dez Cadena, formerly of Black Flag, on guitar, Michael Barragan, formerly of <b>Plexi,</b> on guitar, and Taz Bentley, formerly of The Reverend Horton Heat, on drums. Loaded independently released the live record , before disbanding in late 1999.|$|E
25|$|The SWAT team {{started to}} {{surround}} the bus at 7:37pm. The policemen attempted {{for nearly an}} hour to enter the bus, first by breaking its <b>Plexi</b> glass windows with sledgehammers, pulling the door with a rope attached to a police vehicle but it snapped. After running out of choices, they threw two canisters of tear gas inside and Mendoza stepped out of the bus. Snipers, who had taken positions earlier in the day, ultimately shot Mendoza in the head after he exited the bus, killing him instantly. By that time, however, four more hostages were confirmed dead, while only six hostages were confirmed alive and not seriously injured. Two other people outside the bus — 47-year-old TVB news crew engineer Wen Ming, and child bystander Mike Ladrillo y Campanero — were wounded by stray bullets.|$|E

500|$|Because the New York Dolls {{had little}} money, Sylvain and Thunders played the austerely {{designed}} and affordable Gibson Les Paul Junior guitars on the record. They jokingly {{referred to them}} as [...] "automatic guitars" [...] due to their limited sound shaping features. To amplify their guitars, they ran a Marshall <b>Plexi</b> standalone amplifier through the speaker cabinets of a Fender Dual Showman, and occasionally used a Fender Twin Reverb. Some songs were embellished with additional instruments, including Buddy Bowser's brassy saxophone on [...] "Lonely Planet Boy". Johansen sang into distorted guitar pickups for additional vocals and overdubbed them into the song. He also played an Asian gong for [...] "Vietnamese Baby" [...] and harmonica on [...] "Pills". For [...] "Personality Crisis", Sylvain originally played on The Record Plant's Yamaha grand piano before Rundgren added his own piano flourishes to both that song and [...] "Private World". Rundgren {{also contributed to the}} background vocals heard on [...] "Trash" [...] and played synthesizers on [...] "Vietnamese Baby" [...] and [...] "Frankenstein (Orig.)", which Sylvain recalled: [...] "I remember him getting those weird sounds from this beautiful old Moog synthesizer he brought in. He said it was a model that only he and The Beatles had." ...|$|E

2500|$|Jones also {{occasionally}} {{played an}} Olympic White Fender Stratocaster (for live versions of [...] "Straight to Hell") and several Bond Electraglide Guitars that were donated {{to him by}} Andrew Bond, who made the guitars. For effects Jones mainly uses MXR pedals including a Phase 100, a flanger, an analog delay and a noise gate {{as well as a}} Roland chorus or Space Echo effect. During his days with the Clash, Jones used a Marshall <b>Plexi</b> amplifier and occasionally a Fender Twin with a 2x12 cabinet. He later changed to a Mesa Boogie amplifier with two Marshall 4x12 cabinets that he used throughout the rest of his career with the Clash.|$|E
2500|$|Other early {{customers}} included Pete Townshend and John Entwistle of The Who, whose {{search for}} extra volume led Marshall {{to design the}} classic 100-watt valve amplifier. Ken Bran and Dudley Craven, Marshall's developers, doubled the number of output valves, added a larger power transformer and an extra output transformer. Four of these amplifiers were built and delivered to Pete Townshend, and the Marshall Super Lead Model 1959, the original <b>Plexi,</b> was born in 1965. At the request of Pete Townshend, Marshall produced an 8×12-inch cabinet (soon replaced {{by a pair of}} 4×12-inch cabinets) on top of which the 1959 amplifier head was placed, giving rise to the Marshall stack, an iconic image for rock and roll. The size of the wall of Marshall stacks [...] "soon became an indicator of the band's status", even when rendered obsolete by improved PA systems; indeed, many of the [...] "ridiculously huge arrays of heads and cabs" [...] included dummies. Still, most modern 100-watt heads have roots in Marshall's design, even though they often contain many more features (or different tubes, such as the more American-sounding 6L6 tubes).|$|E

50|$|The {{members of}} the band met as {{students}} studying civil engineering at the Czech Technical University in Prague. Upon forming the band, their plan was to perform one gig only for other students, which took place on 7 December 1982 in a student club, 007. However, they decided to continue as a band. They sold out a concert at Chmelnice club. However, their music did not correspond to the communist authorities' conception of official art, and the band {{changed its name to}} Traktor, named after one of their biggest hits, to avoid possible problems. However, some {{members of the}} band were called up to complete compulsory military service. Pixa, Šťástka and Pátek were placed in the same army unit and formed a new band called Sedum vostrejch. The remaining band members joined other bands (e.g. <b>Plexis)</b> and later played in a different lineup as V.Z. (V zastoupení - on behalf of).|$|R
5000|$|From December 1995 to January 1996, {{their first}} {{full-length}} album was recorded for Sub Pop. The brooding, film noir-esque album {{was given the}} ironic title Cheer Up. After much delay due to personnel shakeups within Sub Pop, the album was released in October 1996. Leadoff track/single [...] "Forest Ranger" [...] had strange pop-culture references and a singalong line of, [...] "When I was looking at you, I didn't mind your foggy weather/ I just wonder what it's like to die." [...] The album also featured reworkings of [...] "Magnet" [...] and [...] "Peel" [...] from the second EP. Cheer Up featured cello by Rasputina's Melora Creager on two tracks ("Ordinary Things" [...] and [...] "Star Star"). In an interview with Alternative Press magazine in Nov. 1996, Angelos professed his fandom of Aldous Huxley and David Bowie; upon being asked if <b>Plexi's</b> music might send {{the wrong message to}} suicidal listeners, Angelos laughed and responded, [...] "Well, as long as I don't die..." ...|$|R
