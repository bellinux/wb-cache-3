The same depth from the surface, residual stress of material after hardening is larger than the residual stress after annealing, With the different combination of tool electrode and work-piece material, the form of the discharge between two electrodes and the proportion of energy put between two electrodes are different, surface residual stress are also different.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the presence of}} antibiotics in cryopreserved cardiovascular tissues and cryopreservation media, after tissue decontamination with antibiotic cocktails, {{and the impact of}} antibiotic residues on standard tissue bank microbiological analyses. Sixteen cardiovascular tissues were decontaminated with bank-prepared cocktails and cryopreserved by two different tissue banks according to their standard operating procedures. Before and after decontamination, samples underwent microbiological analysis by standard tissue bank methods. Cryopreserved samples were tested again with and without the removal of antibiotic residues using a RESEP tube, after thawing. Presence of antibiotics in tissue homogenates and <b>processing</b> <b>liquids</b> was determined by a modified agar diffusion test. All cryopreserved tissue homogenates and cryopreservation media induced important inhibition zones on both Staphylococcus aureus- and Pseudomonas aeruginosa-seeded plates, immediately after thawing {{and at the end of}} the sterility test.

Based on standard tissue bank analysis, 50 % of tissues were found positive for bacteria and/or fungi, before decontamination and 2 out of 16 tested samples (13 %) still contained microorganisms after decontamination. After thawing, none of the 16 cryopreserved samples resulted positive with direct inoculum method.

40|$|The {{swelling}} {{behavior of}} SU- 8 is studied. It {{is well known}} that negative resist swells under the influence of common <b>processing</b> <b>liquids,</b> developers, solvents, etc. However, when SU- 8 is used as a construction material for plating molds, or for permanent structures, for instance in microfluidics or as active mechanical components in the MEM structure, a more quantitative investigation is needed. In this paper, the volume change is measured when the SU- 8 epoxy is submersed in common <b>processing</b> <b>liquids.</b> An analytical model is derived to link the diffusion mechanism to the mechanical response of the SU- 8 material. Using the obtained model, the diffusion constants are calculated from the mechanical displacement measurements. Also, the derived model can be used for the prediction of the mechanical behavior of SU- 8 structures in the future. The swelling behavior is also correlated with the internal stresses that exist in the SU- 8 film. This helps to understand crack formation and delamination of SU- 8 patterns during processing. The results show that the built-in stress in the SU- 8 epoxy is strongly dependent on the ambient or submersion liquid and that this effect in itself is strongly dependent on the softbake procedure of the polymer. The built-in stress in SU- 8 was found to be maximum when submersed in propylene glycol methyl ether acetate and in isopropyl alcohol, both liquids that are used during the development, and found to be very low in water. status: publishe...|$|R
