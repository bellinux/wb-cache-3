50|$|The <b>plain</b> <b>antvireo</b> (Dysithamnus mentalis) is a {{passerine}} {{bird species}} in the antbird family (Thamnophilidae), wherein {{it belongs to the}} antshrike subfamily (Thamnophilinae). It is a resident breeder in tropical Central and South America.|$|E
50|$|This is {{a common}} and confiding bird of primary and {{secondary}} forest. The <b>plain</b> <b>antvireo</b> breeds from southern Mexico south to northern Argentina, and on Trinidad and Tobago. It is patchily distributed {{at the margins of}} its range and generally (but not universally) avoids the lowlands.|$|E
50|$|The {{details of}} its {{breeding}} biology are little known {{except for a}} short list of known host species which includes drab-breasted bamboo tyrant, ochre-faced tody-flycatcher, eared pygmy tyrant and <b>plain</b> <b>antvireo.</b> As with other parasitic cuckoos, parental care of eggs and young is provided by the host species.|$|E
50|$|Other species {{participate}} {{to varying}} extents depending on location or altitude - presumably, the different species composition of mixed flocks at varying locations allows these irregular members {{more or less}} opportunity to get food. Such species include the grey-hooded flycatcher, or the <b>plain</b> <b>antvireo</b> and the red-crowned ant tanager which are often recorded in lowland flocks but rarely join them {{at least in some}} more montane regions.|$|E
50|$|The <b>plain</b> <b>antvireo</b> is {{typically}} 11.4 cm long, and weighs 13.5 g. The adult male has a slate grey head and upperparts, blackish cheeks, three narrow white wing bars, pale grey underparts {{and a white}} belly. The female has olive brown upperparts, a rufous crown, a white eye-ring, yellowish-buff underparts and weakly buff-barred rufous wings. A white (male) or buff (female) shoulder stripe is only visible when the wing is spread. Immature males are much like the adult male, but have brown edgings to the flight feathers, an olive rump and yellowish underparts.|$|E
50|$|In Guyana for example, it is {{at least}} locally common above 1,000 meters ASL in the Pakaraima Mountains (though not Mount Roraima), and also inhabits the {{southern}} Acari Mountains. On the other hand, it has not been recorded from the Iwokrama Forest or the Potaro Plateau. In Nicaragua where upland habitat is mainly restricted to the northwest, the species occurs only here and there in most of the country. For example, the <b>plain</b> <b>antvireo</b> was found to be common, a few dozen meters ASL, in the Dipteryx oleifera-dominated primary forest of Refugio Bartola in the very south of Nicaragua.|$|E
50|$|The <b>plain</b> <b>antvireo</b> feeds like a vireo of the {{songbird}} family Vireonidae, hence its common name. It forages {{for small}} insects and other arthropods taken from twigs and foliage {{in the lower}} branches of trees. It usually does not join mixed-species feeding flocks often, preferring to keep its distance from other species it encounters when attending army ant swarms. Locally, however (e.g. {{as noted in the}} somewhat atypical habitat of Refugio Bartola), it may attend mixed-species flocks more frequently. But usually, it is encountered in pairs or small groups, such as adults with last years' young or birds congregating at a special food source. Breeding pairs are quite territorial against conspecifics however, and defend a patch of habitat that may be as large as about 7,000 square metres, but sometimes is only half that size.|$|E
