5|$|Abra {{arrived back}} in Holby {{towards the end}} of series 8, {{immediately}} becoming embroiled in an illegal <b>porcine</b> kidney transplantation on renal patient Pete Golding. When Ric discovered what he had done, the deception strained their friendship, and Abra came close to losing his job. Eventually, Ric decided the pressure of covering up their misdoing was too great to bear, and after making up with Abra, departed once more for Africa on sabbatical.|$|E
5|$|In November 2008, the Conservancy {{started the}} Rare Breed Swine Initiative, which, in {{cooperation}} with other organizations, assists in training breeders and cultivating the rare breed pig market. The three main foci of the initiative are marketing breeding stock and products, conserving bloodlines and supporting breed associations. As of 2010, proposals were {{in place for the}} funding of a study of <b>porcine</b> genetics, including variability and relationships among breeds, with the aims of maintaining genetic variability among rare pig breeds and releasing a definition of heritage pork.|$|E
5|$|Public Law 105-229, {{commonly}} referred to as the Shackleford Banks Wild Horses Protection Act, states that the Bankers on Shackleford Island are to be jointly managed by the National Park Service and another qualified nonprofit entity (currently the Foundation for Shackleford Horses). The herd is limited to 120–130horses. Population management is achieved through adoption and by administering the contraceptive vaccine <b>Porcine</b> zona pellucida (PZP) to individual mares via dart. The island's horse population is monitored by freeze branding numbers onto each animal's left hindquarter. The identification of individuals allows the National Park Service to ensure correct gender ratios and to select which mares to inject with PZP.|$|E

25|$|Before biosynthetic human {{recombinant}} analogues were available, <b>porcine</b> insulin was chemically {{converted into}} human insulin. Chemical modifications of the amino acid side chains at the N-terminus and/or the C-terminus {{were made in}} order to alter the ADME characteristics of the analogue. Semisynthetic insulins were clinically used for some time based on chemical modification of animal insulins, for example Novo Nordisk enzymatically converted <b>porcine</b> insulin into semisynthetic 'human' insulin by removing the single amino acid that varies from the human variety, and chemically adding the human amino acid.|$|E
25|$|Several {{companies}} {{have attempted to}} have a version of GH for use in pigs (<b>porcine</b> somatotropin) approved by the FDA but all applications have been withdrawn.|$|E
25|$|The 2009 flu pandemic, {{involving}} {{an outbreak of}} a new strain of influenza commonly known as swine flu (usually referred as grippe A or grippe <b>porcine</b> in French), reached France in early May 2009.|$|E
25|$|Circoviruses {{are small}} {{single-stranded}} DNA viruses. There are to genera: gyrovirus, with one species called chicken anemia virus; and circovirus, which includes <b>porcine</b> circovirus types 1 and 2, psittacine beak and feather disease virus, pigeon circovirus, canary circovirus goose circovirus.|$|E
25|$|In the {{pregnant}} sow, uteroferrin is highly {{expressed in the}} uterine fluids. Due to the unique anatomy of the <b>porcine</b> uterus, and the specific, progesterone-induced expression of TRAP; it is hypothesized that uteroferrin acts as an iron transport protein.|$|E
25|$|Arteriviruses are small, enveloped, animal viruses with an {{icosahedral}} core {{containing a}} positive-sense RNA genome. The family includes equine arteritis virus (EAV), <b>porcine</b> reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV), lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus (LDV) of mice and simian haemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV).|$|E
25|$|STS-126 also {{flew the}} first bovine embryos {{as well as}} <b>porcine</b> {{embryonic}} stem cells on an American spacecraft for an experiment to evaluate effects of the environment of space on embryonic development. The project was a joint project of ZeroGravity Inc., University of Florida and USDA ARS.|$|E
25|$|CRISPRs {{have been}} used to cut five to 62 genes at once: pig cells have been {{engineered}} to inactivate all 62 <b>Porcine</b> Endogenous Retroviruses in the pig genome, which eliminated transinfection from the pig to human cells in culture. CRISPR's low cost compared to alternatives is widely seen as revolutionary.|$|E
25|$|Human, murine, and <b>porcine</b> TRAP genes all contain 5 exons, {{and have}} the ATG codon at the {{beginning}} of exon 2, with exon 1 being non-coding. Within the exon 1 promoter, there are three distinct “tissue-specific” promoters: 1A, 1B, and 1C. This would allow TRAP expression to be tightly controlled.|$|E
25|$|Mammalian TRAP is encoded by one gene, {{which is}} {{localized}} on chromosome 19 (19p13.2-13.3) in humans, and on chromosome 9 in mice. TRAP DNA is, as expected from protein sequencing, highly conserved throughout the class mammalia. The TRAP gene has been cloned and sequenced in <b>porcine,</b> rat, human, and murine species.|$|E
25|$|While loss-of-function {{mutations}} in KCNE1 cause Long QT syndrome, gain-of-function KCNE1 mutations {{are associated with}} early-onset atrial fibrillation. A common KCNE1 polymorphism, S38G, is associated with altered predisposition to lone atrial fibrillation and postoperative atrial fibrillation. Atrial KCNE1 expression was downregulated in a <b>porcine</b> model of post-operative atrial fibrillation following lung lobectomy.|$|E
25|$|Each dimer of IDH has two {{active site}}s. Each active site binds a NAD+/NADP+ {{molecule}} and a divalent metal ion (Mg2+,Mn2+). In general, each active site has a conserved sequence of amino acids for each specific binding site. In Desulfotalea psychrophila (DpIDH) and <b>porcine</b> (PcIDH) {{there are three}} substrates bound to the active site.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to the physodic acid mentioned above, P.furfuracea also contains 2-hydroxy-4-methoxy-3,6-dimethyl benzoic acid, atranorin, oxyphysodic acid, and virensic acid. Of these compounds, atranorin showed the highest inhibition of proteolytic enzymes trypsin and <b>porcine</b> pancreatic elastase. Research suggests that the biosynthesis of both atranorin and physodic acid {{is influenced by the}} cooperation of epiphytic bacteria.|$|E
25|$|Feline {{coronavirus}} (FCoV) is a positive-stranded RNA {{virus that}} is infectious to cats worldwide. This virus {{is part of}} the Alphacoronavirus 1 species of the Alphacoronavirus genus belonging to the Coronaviridae family of viruses. Alphacoronavirus 1 also includes the canine coronavirus (CCoV) and the <b>porcine</b> transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus (TGEV). It has two different forms; the FECV (feline enteric coronavirus) that infects the intestines and the FIPV (feline infectious peritonitis virus) that causes the disease feline infectious peritonitis (FIP).|$|E
25|$|The {{compound}} bortezomib with a boronic {{acid group}} is a drug used in chemotherapy. The boron atom in this molecule is a key substructure because through it certain proteasomes are blocked that would otherwise degrade proteins. Boronic acids are known to bind to active site serines and are part of inhibitors for <b>porcine</b> pancreatic lipase, subtilisin and the protease Kex2. Furthermore, boronic acid derivatives constitute a class of inhibitors for human acyl protein thioesterase 1 and 2, which are cancer drug targets within the Ras cycle.|$|E
25|$|Also in {{the late}} 1980s, {{research}} began into the use of vaccines based around zonae pellucidae harvested from pigs {{for the purpose of}} wildlife control. Such <b>porcine</b> zona pellucida (PZP) vaccines were tested in captive and domestic horses in 1986 with encouraging results. This led to the first successful field trial of contraceptive vaccines with free-ranging wildlife, which examined PZP vaccines used upon wild horses of Assateague Island National Seashore in 1988. The successful results of the field trial were maintained by annual booster inoculations.|$|E
25|$|The {{human insulin}} protein is {{composed}} of 51 amino acids, and has a molecular mass of 5808 Da. It is a dimer of an A-chain and a B-chain, which are linked together by disulfide bonds. Insulin's structure varies slightly between species of animals. Insulin from animal sources differs somewhat in effectiveness (in carbohydrate metabolism effects) from human insulin because of these variations. <b>Porcine</b> insulin is especially close to the human version, and was widely used to treat type 1 diabetics before human insulin could be produced in large quantities by recombinant DNA technologies.|$|E
25|$|Two {{aspartate}} {{amino acid}} residues (below left) are interacting with two adjacent water molecules (w6 and w8) in the Mn2+ isocitrate <b>porcine</b> IDH complex to deprotonate the alcohol off the alpha-carbon atom. The oxidation of the alpha-C also {{takes place in}} this picture where NAD+ accepts a hydride resulting in oxalosuccinate. Along with the sp3 to sp2 stereochemical change around the alpha-C, there is a ketone group that is formed form the alcohol group. The formation of this ketone double bond allows for resonance to take place as electrons {{coming down from the}} leaving carboxylate group move towards the ketone.|$|E
25|$|As {{the rising}} {{success rate of}} transplants and modern {{immunosuppression}} make transplants more common, {{the need for more}} organs has become critical. Transplants from living donors, especially relatives, have become increasingly common. Additionally, there is substantive research into xenotransplantation, or transgenic organs; although these forms of transplant are not yet being used in humans, clinical trials involving the use of specific cell types have been conducted with promising results, such as using <b>porcine</b> islets of Langerhans to treat type1 diabetes. However, there are still many problems that would need to be solved before they would be feasible options in people requiring transplants.|$|E
25|$|Within vertebrates, {{the amino}} acid {{sequence}} of insulin is strongly conserved. Bovine insulin differs from human in only three amino acid residues, and <b>porcine</b> insulin in one. Even insulin from some species of fish is similar enough to human to be clinically effective in humans. Insulin in some invertebrates is quite similar in sequence to human insulin, and has similar physiological effects. The strong homology seen in the insulin sequence of diverse species suggests {{that it has been}} conserved across much of animal evolutionary history. The C-peptide of proinsulin (discussed later), however, differs much more among species; it is also a hormone, but a secondary one.|$|E
25|$|A {{transplant}} {{of organs}} or tissue from one species to another. An example is <b>porcine</b> heart valve transplant, {{which is quite}} common and successful. Another example is attempted piscine-primate (fish to non-human primate) transplant of islet (i.e. pancreatic or insular tissue) tissue. The latter research study was intended {{to pave the way}} for potential human use if successful. However, xenotransplantion is often an extremely dangerous type of transplant because of the increased risk of non-compatibility, rejection, and disease carried in the tissue. In an opposite twist, Ganogen Research Institute CEO Eugene Gu is studying how to transplant human fetal hearts and kidneys into animals for future transplantation into human patients to address the shortage of donor organs.|$|E
25|$|The {{religion}} of Jainism has always opposed eating meat, {{and there are}} also schools of Buddhism and Hinduism that condemn the eating of meat. Jewish dietary rules (Kashrut) allow certain (kosher) meat and forbid other (treif). The rules include prohibitions on the consumption of unclean animals (such as pork, shellfish including mollusca and crustacea, and most insects), and mixtures of meat and milk. Similar rules apply in Islamic dietary laws: The Quran explicitly forbids meat from animals that die naturally, blood, the meat of swine (<b>porcine</b> animals, pigs), and animals dedicated to other than Allah (either undedicated or dedicated to idols) which are haram as opposed to halal. Sikhism forbids meat of slowly slaughtered animals ("kutha") and prescribes killing animals with a single strike ("jhatka"), but some Sikh groups oppose eating any meat.|$|E
25|$|Most bite mark {{analysis}} studies use <b>porcine</b> skin (pigskin), {{because it}} {{is comparable to the}} skin of a human, and it is considered unethical to bite a human for study in the United States. Limitations to the bite mark studies include differences in properties of pigskin compared to human skin and the technique of using simulated pressures to create bite marks. Although similar histologically, pigskin and human skin behave in dynamically different ways due to differences in elasticity. Furthermore, postmortem bites on nonhuman skin, such as those used in the experiments of Martin-de-las Heras et al., display different patterns to those seen in antemortem bite injuries. In recognition of the limitations of their study, Kouble and Craig suggest using a G-clamp on an articulator in future studies to standardize the amount of pressure used to produce experimental bite marks instead of applying manual pressure to models on pigskin. Future research and technological developments may help reduce the occurrence of such limitations.|$|E
500|$|RosettaDock {{was added}} to the Rosetta {{software}} suite during the first CAPRI experiment in 2002 as the Baker laboratory's algorithm for protein–protein docking prediction. In that experiment, RosettaDock made a high-accuracy prediction for the docking between streptococcal pyogenic exotoxin A and a T cell-receptor β-chain, and a medium accuracy prediction for a complex between <b>porcine</b> α-amylase and a camelid antibody. [...] While the RosettaDock method only made two acceptably accurate predictions out of seven possible, this was enough to rank it seventh out of nineteen prediction methods in the first CAPRI assessment.|$|E
500|$|The [...] are a {{powerful}} and agile <b>porcine</b> race possessing low intellect and described as barely able to speak human languages. Though somewhat cowardly, they are often hired as mercenaries, guards, or hunters, with a significant amount going into thievery. The Seeq are also attracted by shiny objects, often adorning themselves with such. Seeq often adorn themselves with markings of sorts, the most common being something that resembles a smiley face on their chest. Males and Females are almost impossible to distinguish, the only real sign being that females often wear some clothing on their upper bodies.|$|E
500|$|The {{area around}} the hill was largely {{abandoned}} {{after the fall of}} Rome. A print of 1625 depicts Monte Testaccio standing in isolation in an area of wasteland within the ancient city walls, and even as late as the mid-19th century the surrounding area {{was little more than a}} [...] "romantic desert" [...] on which was situated only [...] "a few shabby houses". It was the scene of jousts and tournaments during the Middle Ages, when Monte Testaccio was the scene of pre-Lenten celebrations. As part of the festivities, two carts filled with pigs were hauled to the top of the hill, then allowed to run back down the steep slope to be smashed to pieces along with their <b>porcine</b> passengers. The watching revellers would then dismember the pigs on the spot and carry the parts off to be roasted and eaten.|$|E
500|$|Since {{early in}} the 1980s, fetal, <b>porcine,</b> carotid or retinal tissues {{have been used in}} cell transplants, in which dissociated cells are {{injected}} into the substantia nigra in the hope that they will incorporate themselves into the brain in a way that replaces the dopamine-producing cells that have been lost. [...] Although there was initial evidence of mesencephalic dopamine-producing cell transplants being beneficial, double-blind trials to date indicate that cell transplants produce no long-term benefit. An additional significant problem was the excess release of dopamine by the transplanted tissue, leading to dystonias. Stem cell transplants are a recent research target, because stem cells are easy to manipulate and stem cells transplanted into the brains of rodents and monkeys have been found to survive and reduce behavioral abnormalities. Nevertheless, use of fetal stem cells is controversial. It has been proposed that effective treatments may be developed in a less controversial way by use of induced pluripotent stem cells taken from adults.|$|E
2500|$|... fAPN (feline), hAPN (human) and pAPN (<b>porcine)</b> {{differ in}} some areas of N-glycosylation. All strains of the {{coronavirus}} study group 1 (feline, <b>porcine</b> and human) can bind to the feline aminopeptidase N fapn but the human coronavirus can bind to the human APN (HAPN) but not to the <b>porcine</b> type receptor (pAPN) and the pig coronavirus can bind to the <b>porcine</b> APN (pAPN) but not the human type receptor (hAPN). At the cellular level the glycosylation level of enterocytes APN is important for the binding of virus to the receptor.|$|E
