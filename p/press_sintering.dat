40|$|We {{investigated}} the thermoelectric properties of PbTe/Ag 2 Te bulk composites, synthesized by hand milling, mixing, and hot <b>press</b> <b>sintering.</b> From x-ray diffraction and {{energy dispersive x-ray spectroscopy}} measurements, we observed Ag 2 Te phase separation in the PbTe matrix without Ag atom diffusion. In comparison with previously reported pseudo-binary (PbTe) 1 −x(Ag 2 Te) x composites, synthesized by high temperature phase separation, the PbTe/Ag 2 Te bulk composites fabricated {{with a low}} temperature phase mixing process give rise to p-type conduction of carriers with significantly decreased electrical conductivity.

40|$|This is {{the final}} {{technical}} report for the Department of Energy NETL project NT 01931 Energy Efficient <b>Press</b> and <b>Sinter</b> of Titanium Powder for Low-Cost Components in Vehicle Applications. Titanium {{has been identified as}} one of the key materials with the required strength that can reduce the weight of automotive components and thereby reduce fuel consumption. Working with newly developed sources of titanium powder, Webster-Hoff will develop the processing technology to manufacture low cost vehicle components using the single press/single sinter techniques developed for iron based powder metallurgy today. Working with an automotive or truck manufacturer, Webster-Hoff will demonstrate the feasibility of manufacturing a <b>press</b> and <b>sinter</b> titanium component for a vehicle application. The project objective is two-fold, to develop the technology for manufacturing <b>press</b> and <b>sinter</b> titanium components, and to demonstrate the feasibility of producing a titanium component for a vehicle application. The lowest cost method for converting metal powder into a net shape part is the Powder Metallurgy <b>Press</b> and <b>Sinter</b> Process. The method involves compaction of the metal powder in a tool (usually a die and punches, upper and lower) at a high pressure (up to 60 TSI or 827 MPa) to form a green compact with the net shape of the final component. The powder in the green compact is held together by the compression bonds between the powder particles. The sinter process then converts the green compact to a metallurgically bonded net shape part through the process of solid state diffusion. The goal of this project is to expand the understanding and application of <b>press</b> and <b>sinter</b> technology to Titanium Powder applications, developing techniques to manufacture net shape Titanium components via the <b>press</b> and <b>sinter</b> process. In addition, working with a vehicle manufacturer, demonstrate the feasibility of producing a titanium component for a vehicle. This is not a research program, but rather a project to develop a process for <b>press</b> and <b>sinter</b> of net shape Titanium components. All of these project objectives have been successfully completed...|$|R
