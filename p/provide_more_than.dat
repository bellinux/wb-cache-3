She was secretary of the corporation, although this may have been a nominal position as Louis and his lawyer prepared most of the corporation's correspondence and its filings. She also probably helped her husband decide to <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> one million dollars toward achieving the Roeriches' spiritual and cultural ambitions. She met with the Roeriches and their other supporters in making plans for the Roerich Museum, Master Institute, Corona Mundi, and the other organizations housed in the Master Building.

5|$|President Bush also {{declared}} Washington, D.C., as {{a disaster}} area {{two days after}} Isabel passed through the area. The United States Department of Agriculture approved a request for an emergency food stamp program for two weeks {{for the city to}} ensure those who lost food {{as a result of the}} hurricane would not go hungry. By eight days after the hurricane, the Department of Employment Services created disaster unemployment benefits for those who lost their work as a direct result of Isabel. By 11days after Isabel, the government approved $5.21million in disaster assistance (2003USD, $ USD). The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers delivered nearly 800,000pounds (363,000kg) of dry ice to four distribution sites for use with cold food storage to areas in the District suffering from power outages. Various groups joined to <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 15,000meals for residents who lost stored food due to spoilage resulting from the power outages. Volunteers assisted in distributing 515tons (467t) of ice, along with 21,000 sandbags throughout the district. Officials opened two disaster recovery centers which moved through the neighborhoods of the district. Ultimately, nearly 1,500residents in the district applied for federal assistance, with FEMA providing the residents more than $600,000 in aid (2003USD, ($ USD).|$|E
5|$|The George McGovern–Robert Dole International Food for Education and Nutrition Program {{that was}} created in 2000, and funded largely through the Congress, {{would go on to}} <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 22 million meals to {{children}} in 41 countries over the next eight years. It was also credited with improving school attendance, especially among girls, who {{were more likely to be}} allowed to go to school if a meal was being provided. In August 2000, President Clinton presented McGovern with the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor, in recognition of McGovern's service in the effort to eradicate world hunger. McGovern's book The Third Freedom: Ending Hunger In Our Time was published in January 2001; with its title making reference to Roosevelt's Four Freedoms speech, it proposed a plan whereby chronic world hunger could be eliminated within thirty years. In January 2001, McGovern was asked to stay on at the UN post for a while by the incoming George W. Bush administration. His stint then concluded with a termination of mission on September 28, 2001.|$|E

25|$|Reactors {{that use}} the uranium-plutonium fuel cycle require fast {{reactors}} to sustain breeding, because only with fast moving neutrons does the fission process <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 2 neutrons per fission.

This was proven to work in the Shippingport Atomic Power Station, whose final fuel load bred slightly more fissile from thorium than it consumed, despite being a fairly standard light water reactor. Thermal reactors require less of the expensive fissile fuel to start, but are more sensitive to fission products left in the core.|$|E

25|$|Pressure {{measurement}} {{systems are}} an additional {{way to measure}} gait by providing insights into pressure distribution, contact area, center of force movement and symmetry between sides. These systems typically <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> just pressure information; additional information available from these systems are force, timing and spatial parameters. Different methods for assessing pressure are available, like a pressure measurement mat or walkway (longer in length to capture more foot strikes), as well as in-shoe pressure measurement systems (where sensors are placed inside the shoe). Many pressure measurement systems integrate with additional types of analysis systems, like motion capture, EMG or force plates to provide a comprehensive gait analysis.|$|E
25|$|In July 2005, the Federal Planning Bureau {{published}} a new report, {{which states that}} oil and other fossil fuels generate 90% of Belgian energy use, while nuclear power accounts for 9% and renewable energy for 1%. Electricity only amounts to 16% of total energy use, and while nuclear-powered electricity amounts to 9% of use in Belgium, {{in many parts of}} Belgium, especially in Flanders, it makes up more than 50% of the electricity provided to households and businesses. This was one of the major reasons to revert the earlier phase-out, since it was impossible to <b>provide</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> 50% of the electricity by 'alternative' energy-production, and a revert to the classical coal-driven electricity would mean inability to adhere to the Kyoto Protocol.|$|E

A large portion of the world's total oil exists as unconventional sources, such as bitumen in Canada and extra heavy oil in Venezuela.

However, Ricky Ponting and Hayden scored at above six an over in their partnership, before Ponting was eventually run out.

Shane Watson's 33 from 26 balls also helped push Australia to 322 for 6 after the full 50 overs. This was the sixth successive score above 300 for Australia, a new One-day International record.|$|E
