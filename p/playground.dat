50|$|Even as Congress {{continued}} to exercise rather than delegate federal authority over {{parks and recreation}} facilities in the District of Columbia, the District government {{continued to}} press its own initiatives over these areas. In 1910, the District Commissioners pressed for federal legislation that would permit the city to build, maintain, and run public <b>playgrounds</b> (the construction of public <b>playgrounds</b> then being a revolutionary and new national movement). In March 1911, Congress approved legislation creating the D.C. Department of <b>Playgrounds.</b> In 1913, the Department of <b>Playgrounds</b> won congressional authorization to allow recreational programs at these <b>playgrounds.</b> Two years later, Congress established the Community Center Department under the D.C. Board of Education to provide adult recreation throughout the city (not just at public schools). Congress enacted legislation in 1932 authorizing the NPS to transfer land {{to the government of}} the District of Columbia (after following certain procedures) without Congressional approval, and vice versa. In 1939, Congress required that the Community Center Department and Department of <b>Playgrounds</b> merge to form the Community Center and <b>Playgrounds</b> Department.|$|R

40|$|Interactive <b>playgrounds</b> are technology-enhanced {{installations}} {{that aim}} to provide rich game experiences for children {{by combining the}} benefits of traditional <b>playgrounds</b> with those of digital games. These game experiences could be attained by addressing three design considerations: context-awareness, adaptability, and personalization. The authors propose using social signal processing (SSP) to enhance current interactive <b>playgrounds</b> to meet these criteria. This article surveys how SSP techniques can help <b>playgrounds</b> automatically sense and interpret children's social interactions, adapt game mechanics to induce targeted social behavior, and learn from the sensed behavior to meet players expectations and desires...|$|R

Taking into account the latest contemporary foreign researches, the article discusses the facts concerning the link between the types of <b>playgrounds,</b> their equipment and the nature of child behavior. The article provides basic criteria for expertize of game environment: game value of plating objects or game environment in general, landscape features of <b>playgrounds,</b> the elements that trigger risky behavior, etc. The conclusion states that <b>playgrounds</b> must be assessed in terms of their compliance to the needs of children and the age related challenges of their development...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare the number of {{accessibility}} adapted outdoor <b>playgrounds</b> in the Norrland municipalities since 2001, and to find answers on how the responsible persons within the municipalities perceived the concepts of accessibility and adaption, since previous studies have implicated deficiencies in these areas. Children with disabilities risk social isolation and discrimination if the physical environment of outdoor <b>playgrounds</b> creates barriers. According to the official disability policy of Sweden, all public places and buildings are to be adapted for accessibility by year 2016. Method: A mixed method survey-study was carried out in which questionnaires were sent to the responsible persons of outdoor <b>playgrounds</b> in the 54 municipalities of Norrland. Result: The results were compared to a study from 2001. The response rate in this study was equal to the study from 2001, in which 41 out of 54 (76 %) respondents participated. The results showed that the number of accessibility adapted outdoor <b>playgrounds</b> have increased and that the total number of outdoor <b>playgrounds</b> in Norrland have decreased. Of the 1767 reported <b>playgrounds,</b> more than 1500 of them do not enable participation in play and meaningful activities due to lack of adaptation, accessibility and usability. The most common obstacle in outdoor <b>playgrounds</b> proved to be surfaces such as gravel or grass. The results also showed a lack of knowledge with the people responsible for outdoor <b>playgrounds</b> within the municipalities when it comes to the relationship between peoples skills, the demands of the surrounding environment and activity.

After the air battle ends with no winners, Bertram resorts to biological warfare, and infects Stewie with chickenpox. After recovering, an enraged Stewie confronts Bertram, and they engage in a sword fight in the play area. Stewie eventually wins by disarming Bertram, and later that night, is seen suspiciously digging a hole with Christopher Moltisanti, but the hole is actually for a young tree. Stewie explains to Christopher that Bertram admitted defeat to Stewie and ran away.|$|E
