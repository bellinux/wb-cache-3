40|$|In {{order to}} prevent the scour {{resulting}} from water falls, such as a vertical waterjet impinging normally on a sediment bed, {{it is necessary to}} make clear the hydraulicmechanism of the beginning of motion of sand gravels, that is the criterion for scour,due to the flows caused by a vertical jet. The first part of this paper deals with the theoretical approach to solve the char-acter of flows close to a boundary which is caused by impingement of jets on a normalboundary. A theoretical consideration for the boundary layer growth on the normalboundary in the various cases of two and three dimensional jets, at submerged and non-submerged conditions is described with the aid of the results of some experiments. Inthe above considerations, the boundary layer growth in the vicinity of impingement ofjets is disclosed. In the second part, the criterion <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> from a vertical submerged water jet isanalyzed by the same procedure as done by the author in the previous paper entitled"Basic Studies on the Criterion <b>for</b> <b>Scour</b> from Flows Downstream of an Outlet". It isconcluded from the comparison between the theoretical and experimental results that thefundamental relationships in the criterion <b>for</b> <b>scour,</b> which are reduced by the theory,are in good agreement with the experimental results. Based on both results of the theoryand the experiments, an empirical formula for the criterion <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> from a verticalsubmerged water jet is proposed, and moreover, some considerations on the method pre-venting the bed from scour are described...|$|R

40|$|Tens of {{millions}} of dollars have been spent over the years on Federal-aid highway system bridges damaged by floods. Nearly 500, 000 of the 577, 000 existing bridges within the National Bridge Inventory are over waterways. The screening of these bridges over waterways <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> susceptibility will be completed, for the most part, by October 1992. The Federal Highway Administration has established January 1997 as the completion date <b>for</b> the <b>scour</b> evaluations of all existing bridges identified as scour susceptible. A cost-effective means of determining the specifics of bridges with unknown foundations is not currently available. Pending the development of technology to determine unknown foundations, these structures must be monitored during routine National Bridge Inspection Standards inspections and following significant flood events. The only exception to this course of action is for unknown foundation bridges on the Interstate system, which must be evaluated <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> before the January 1997 target date.

40|$|A {{field trial}} was {{designed}} to determine the efficacy of a combination rotavirus-coronavirus/Escherichia coli vaccine on dairy farms in southwestern Ontario. In Part A of the trial, 321 cows on 15 farms {{were randomly assigned to}} either vaccination or placebo groups. On eight farms, 50 % of the dams were vaccinated, while on the other seven farms, 80 % of the dams were vaccinated. In Part B of the trial, 26 farms were randomly assigned to either a total vaccination program or to no vaccination program. Mortality, disease occurrence and weight gains were recorded on all calves for {{the first two weeks of}} life. In Part A, 23. 5 % of all calves were treated in the first two weeks of life, 20. 9 % were treated specifically <b>for</b> <b>scours</b> and 3. 6 % of live-born calves died. Enteropathogenic E. coli was identified on 13 of the 15 farms, rotavirus on 11 and coronavirus on ten. At least one of the three potential pathogens was found on every farm. There were no significant differences between calves from placebo-treated and vaccine-treated dams with regard to the proportion treated for all diseases, or <b>for</b> <b>scours,</b> or the proportion which died. Neither were there differences in days to first treatment for all diseases (seven days on average), days to first scour (6. 7 days), duration of treatments (3. 9 days for all diseases, 3. 7 days <b>for</b> <b>scours),</b> or estimated weight gains (0. 5 kg/day to 14 days).

40|$|Calf-related {{drug use}} was studied on 104 {{randomly}} selected Holstein dairy farms in southwestern Ontario between October 1980 and July 1983. About 20 % of dairy farmers were observed to administer antimicrobials preventively to healthy newborn calves (primarily as commercial “cocktails” of various antimicrobials, {{vitamins and minerals}} given in an oral bolus form) at some time during the year. About 30 % of the farmers were observed to use vitamins (primarily vitamins A,D and E) preventively. The pattern of types of antimicrobials used preventively appeared {{to be different from}} the pattern seen for therapeutic use. Chloramphenicol was the single most commonly used therapeutic antimicrobial in this population of calves, accounting for some 30 % of overall therapeutic antimicrobial use. In this study population, the prophylactic use of antimicrobials was associated with a decreased risk of being treated for pneumonia, and of dying, but an increased risk of being treated <b>for</b> <b>scours.</b> Case fatality rates for calves treated therapeutically varied, depending on the antimicrobial used and the routine of treatment. Calves treated with penicillin consistently suffered the highest case fatality rates. Case fatality rates for calves treated with chloramphenicol were considerably higher for calves treated once per day than for calves treated twice per day. For instance, calves first treated <b>for</b> <b>scours</b> with chloramphenicol, if treated once per day, suffered a case fatality rate of 22 %. <b>For</b> <b>scouring</b> calves treated twice per day the case fatality rate was just under five percent. Clinical field trials of specific antimicrobials used preventively and therapeutically are required to delineate the conditions under which they might be useful...|$|R

40|$|This $ 800 {{million project}} has {{presented}} many engineering challenges, {{one of which}} has been the assessment of <b>scour</b> protection requirements <b>for</b> the 65 bridge piers.

The direct application of standard scour prediction techniques was not possible for this project due to the combination of complex flow conditions (waves and currents), complex pier geometry (conical base, with some piers located in dredged pits), and complex seabed conditions (highly weathered and fractured bedrock).
