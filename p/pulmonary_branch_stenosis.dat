40|$|Transient {{systolic}} murmurs in neonates and premature infants due to mild left (LPA) {{and right}} (RPA) <b>pulmonary</b> <b>branch</b> <b>stenosis</b> is recognized but follow up studies are lacking. A total of 32 neonates with murmur and 32 controls were evaluated echocardiographically at baseline and {{in four months}} follow up. Diameters of LPA and RPA were smaller in patients with murmur. Colour-coded Doppler showed turbulent flow in LPA and RPA in 93 % of patients and flow velocities of both pulmonary branches {{were significantly higher than}} in controls. The follow up study at 4 months showed absent (23 %) or decreased murmur (76 %). Echocardiographically, absolute and relative diameters of LPA and RPA increased whereas the ratio of main pulmonary artery/aorta did not change suggesting accelerated growth or dilatation of the pulmonary branches. Thus, transient systolic murmurs in neonates are associated with temporary relative hypoplasia of the pulmonary branches which showed increased growth leading to disappearance of the murmur in most cases within 4 months of life...|$|E
40|$|AIMS—To define {{how often}} {{transient}} <b>pulmonary</b> <b>branch</b> <b>stenosis</b> (PBS) develops after closure of a {{patent ductus arteriosus}} (PDA) in babies born at less than 32 weeks gestation; to describe {{the natural history of}} PBS and the relation between PBS and a cardiac murmur.  METHODS—Fifty three preterm infants born at a gestational age less than 32 weeks and who had PDA diagnosed on echocardiography were recruited. An echocardiogram was performed on alternate days until the ductus arteriosus closed. If PBS was diagnosed, the baby was followed up until PBS resolved.  RESULTS—In 59 %, PBS developed in one or both branches after closure of the PDA. In 21 %, both pulmonary branches were affected. In 79 %, the left pulmonary artery alone was involved but the right side was never affected alone. PBS had resolved in 74 % by the time the infants reached 40 weeks, in 95 % at a corrected age of 6 weeks, and in 100 % at a corrected age of 3 months. There is a better correlation between a cardiac murmur and PBS than between a murmur and PDA.  CONCLUSIONS—PBS in preterm infants is usually not present at birth but develops after closure of a PDA. PBS resolves by a corrected age of 3 months. The presence of a murmur after closure of a PDA is usually related to PBS and not to reopening of the ductus arteriosus. ...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACTBackgroundHistorically, {{intravascular}} {{pressure recording}} {{has contributed to}} the development of interventional cardiology. Although new imaging resources have gained much attention, accurate intravascular pressure measurement remains essential for the diagnosis and evaluation of interventional therapy methods. We describe the use of the miniature manometric system (pressure-wire) to obtain pressure curves in congenital and acquired structural heart diseases. MethodsThe Radi Analyzer® Xpress (St. Jude Medical Inc., St. Paul, MN, USA) and PressureWire® Certus systems were used in procedures with 5 F catheters under general anesthesia and ventilatory support in children. Manometric tracings were obtained simultaneously from pressure-wire and the 5 F catheter in patients whose therapy strategies were dependent on the analysis of intravascular pressures, and in whom {{it was not possible to}} obtain them accurately by conventional methods. ResultsPressure-wire was used to obtain pulmonary intravascular pressures in patients with systemic-pulmonary collaterals with or without angiographically detected stenosis, and with different structural heart diseases, in the evaluation of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>branch</b> <b>stenosis,</b> in the localization of surgical conduit stenosis (e. g. after Rastelli surgery), surgical shunts (such as Blalock-Taussig) and in the preoperative evaluation of cavopulmonary shunts. The procedure was performed safely, and manometric tracings were obtained with an adequate quality. ConclusionsThe miniature manometric system is well accepted as a complementary diagnostic modality for the functional assessment of coronary lesions in interventional cardiology. It is also a complementary diagnostic method in different structural, congenital and acquired heart diseases...|$|E

40|$|ObjectiveWe {{sought to}} {{determine}} the impact of relieving <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>stenosis</b> on pulmonary valve insufficiency and right ventricular function. Long-standing pulmonary insufficiency causes progressive right ventricular dilatation, leading to decreased right ventricular function. Adults with pulmonary insufficiency {{are at risk of}} decreased exercise tolerance, arrhythmias, and sudden cardiac death. <b>Branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>stenosis</b> frequently occurs in these patients, and the presence of <b>branch</b> <b>stenosis</b> may exacerbate valve insufficiency. MethodsNeonatal piglets (n = 7) underwent surgery to create pulmonary insufficiency and left pulmonary artery stenosis. At 3 months of age, the animals underwent baseline cardiac magnetic resonance imaging followed by stenting of the left pulmonary artery. A repeat magnetic resonance imaging scan was performed 1 week after intervention. Magnetic resonance imaging evaluation included (1) velocity mapping to assess the forward and reverse flow at the main, left and right pulmonary arteries, and aorta; and (2) volumetric assessment of the right ventricle. ResultsLeft pulmonary artery flow increased from 14. 5 % to 36. 3 % of total net flow after stenting (P <. 01). Pulmonary regurgitation decreased from 38. 7 % to 27. 4 % (P <. 02). Right ventricular ejection fraction improved from a median of 53. 5 % to 58. 2 % after stenting (P <. 01). Cardiac index improved from a median of 2. 7 to 3. 5 L/min/m 2 (P =. 01).

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Comparison of {{the results}} of <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>stenosis</b> treated with balloon {{angioplasty}} (BA) or stent implantation (SI) in children. BACKGROUND: <b>Branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>stenosis</b> may be treated with BA or SI. METHODS: We compared the results of 147 interventions of <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>stenosis</b> in 87 children (median age 3. 6 years). Patients were treated during 1989 - 2000 with BA and during 2001 - 2004 with SI. Primary endpoints were acute complications and reintervention during follow up. Secondary variables were age, vessel diameter increase, acute success rate, balloon/vessel diameter ratio, pulmonary artery hypoplasia indices, and procedure related factors. RESULTS: The acute vessel diameter increase with BA (4. 31 +/- 1. 98 vs. 7. 15 +/- 2. 31 mm) and SI (3. 71 +/- 1. 58 vs. 6. 97 +/- 2. 68 mm) was significant within both groups (P < 0. 001), but not between both groups. The reintervention rate was comparable between both groups, but median time to reintervention was shorter after SI in infants compared to BA. The balloon/vessel diameter ratio was on average higher in BA than the stent/vessel diameter ratio in SI (3. 49 +/- 2. 16 vs. 2. 42 +/- 0. 56; P < 0. 05) and was a significant risk factor (P < 0. 01) for the higher complication rate after BA (BA: 14. 1 % vs. SI: 4. 8 %). No mortality occurred in both groups. CONCLUSION: BA and SI are safe interventional catheter therapies of <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>stenosis.</b> The immediate results of BA and SI are comparable. The higher complication rate after BA, especially in infants, was associated with a higher balloon/vessel diameter ratio. SI seems to be a safe permanent alternative with foreign material, but requires more reinterventions in infants due to its therapeutic strategy...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVES: Despite {{excellent}} {{survival in}} patients after the arterial switch operation, reintervention is frequently required and exercise capacity is decreased in {{a substantial number}} of patients. This study relates right-sided imaging features in patients long-term after the arterial switch operation to exercise capacity and ventilatory efficiency to investigate which lesions are functionally important. METHODS: Patients operated in the UMC Utrecht, the Netherlands (1976 - 2001) and healthy controls underwent cardiac magnetic resonance imaging and cardiopulmonary exercise testing within 1 week. We measured main, left, and right pulmonary artery cross-sectional areas, pulmonary blood flow distribution, peak oxygen uptake, and minute ventilation relative to carbon dioxide elimination. RESULTS: A total of 71 patients (median age, 20 [12 - 35] years, 73 % were male) and 21 healthy controls (median age, 26 [21 - 35] years, 48 % were male) were included. Main, left, and right pulmonary artery areas were decreased compared with controls (190 vs 269 mm(2) /m(2), 59 vs 157 mm(2) /m(2), 98 vs 139 mm(2) /m(2), respectively, all P /= 34, respectively). The main pulmonary artery area significantly correlated with peak oxygen uptake (r = 0. 401, P =. 001) and pulmonary blood flow distribution with minute ventilation relative to carbon dioxide elimination (r = - 0. 329, P =. 008). Subanalysis ( 25 years) showed that the main pulmonary artery area was smaller in older age groups. In multivariable analysis, the main pulmonary artery area was independently associated with peak oxygen uptake (P =. 032). CONCLUSIONS: In adult patients after the arterial switch operation, narrowing of the main pulmonary artery is a common finding and is the main determinant of limitation in functional capacity, rather than <b>pulmonary</b> <b>branch</b> <b>stenosis...</b>|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: We {{analyzed}} {{the results in}} two centers of using bovine jugular vein graft for right ventricular outflow tract reconstruction. METHODS: From April 1999 to July 2005, 133 children with a median age of 30. 9 months (range, 4 days to 19 years) underwent graft implantation. Echocardiography was performed during follow-up and retrospectively reviewed. RESULTS: Nongraft-related early mortality occurred in 8 patients. Late mortality occurred in 11 patients, 2 late deaths were graft related (endocarditis). Median follow-up was 31. 6 months (range, 1 to 73). Twelve patients received a new graft, because of endocarditis (3), distal pulmonary artery branch stenosis (4), graft obstruction caused by fibrosis (4), or thrombosis (1). Echocardiography Doppler studies showed good conduit function, with 92 % of the patients having absent, trivial, or only mild valve regurgitation at last follow-up. A moderate degree of conduit stenosis due to external compression was observed in 2 patients. Twenty-five patients with otherwise intact conduits had hemodynamically significant distal stenosis. In most cases, the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>branch</b> <b>stenosis</b> was related to preoperative small pulmonary arteries and young age at operation. At 31. 6 months, significant graft dilatation was observed in 4 grafts and was related to pulmonary artery branch obstruction or pulmonary hypertension. Calcification did not occur in 5 years time. Survival was 85. 7 %, freedom from conduit explantation was 91 %, and freedom from intervention for pulmonary artery branch stenosis was 80 % after 5 years. CONCLUSIONS: The bovine jugular vein graft is a valuable right ventricular outflow tract conduit, but younger age and small pulmonary arteries {{increase the risk of}} distal conduit stenosis...|$|E
40|$|Background and Objectives: Repair of tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) with monocusp {{pulmonary}} valve reconstruction prevents pulmonary regurgitation (PR) for {{a variable}} period. Since postoperative outcome {{is governed by}} PR and right ventricular function, we sought to assess the severity of pulmonary regurgitation and right ventricular outflow (RVOT) gradient in the immediate postoperative period and at 1 year and attempted to identify the anatomical substrates responsible for adverse outcomes. Methods: The study included 30 patients. Transthoracic echocardiography was performed before surgery, within 5 days of surgery, and 1 year later. Presence and severity of PR, RVOT gradient, and residual branch pulmonary stenosis were assessed. Right ventricular and monocusp valve functions were studied. Results: Median age was 36. 5 months (3 - 444 months). There were no deaths. Pulmonary regurgitation was mild in 18, moderate in 10, and severe in 2 patients immediately following surgery. At 1 year, 10 patients had severe PR and one had significant RVOT gradient. None of the variables like age, presence of supravalvar <b>pulmonary</b> <b>branch</b> <b>stenosis,</b> main pulmonary artery diameter, or mobility of monocusp valve {{was found to have}} any significant association with the progression of PR. McGoon index < 1. 5 showed a trend toward more PR, while patients with more residual RVOT gradient had lesser regurgitation. Conclusions: Repair of TOF with monocusp pulmonary valve reduces immediate postoperative PR. At 1 year, the monocusp valve underwent loss of function in a significant proportion and PR also progressed. This study could not identify any predictors of progression of PR, though patients with McGoon index < 1. 5 tended to have more PR while those with more outflow gradient had lesser PR...|$|E
40|$|SummaryA Genesis stent was {{implanted}} in two children, one with superior vena caval (SVC) stenosis {{and one with}} <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>branch</b> <b>stenosis.</b> Case 1 was a 2 -month-old baby with SVC stenosis following intracardiac repair for total anomalous pulmonary venous connection (TAPVC) and case 2 was a 2 -year-old child with left lower pulmonary artery stenosis following one-stage unifocalization for dextrocardia, double outlet right ventricle, ventricular septal defect, pulmonary atresia and major aortopulmonary collateral arteries. Both procedures resulted in immediate clinical and hemodynamic improvement. The Genesis stent has a closed-cell design with sigma hinges interpositioned between each cell.

40|$|Tetralogy of Fallot (TOF) {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{congenital}} heart diseases for which patients are referred for postoperative magnetic resonance (MR) imaging evaluation. The most common surgical procedures for TOF repair include infundibulectomy, transannular pulmonary artery patch repair, and right ventricle-pulmonary artery conduit placement. In the past few decades, surgery has proved successful, but most patients require repeat imaging throughout their lives. MR imaging is now frequently used for morphologic and functional evaluation after TOF repair. The most common late postoperative sequelae and residual lesions include right ventricular outflow tract aneurysm and dyskinesis, conduit failure, pulmonary regurgitation, tricuspid regurgitation, right ventricular failure, residual main and <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>stenosis,</b> <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery aneurysm, left pulmonary artery kinking, and residual or recurrent ventricular septal defect. The imaging approach for the evaluation of patients with repaired TOF should be guided by the surgical procedure used and the complications that are expected.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the efficacy and safety of high pressure balloons (17 to 20 atm, Blue Max, Meditech) to dilate <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>stenosis.</b> Background. The low success rate (50 % to 60 %) for angioplasty of <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>stenosis</b> using low pressure balloons is due primarily to the inability to eliminate the balloon waist. Hence, higher inflation pressures may improve results. Methods. Hemodynamic and angiographic data from 52 patients (0. 3 to 34. 8 years old) who underwent high pressure balloon dilation of <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>stenosis</b> between October 1990 and February 1992 were reviewed retrospectively, as were data from previous low pressure dilations in these patients. Common diagnoses included tetralogy of Fallot (n = 9), tetralogy of Fallot with pulmonary atresia (n = 23), single ventricle (n = 8) and isolated congenital pulmonary stenosis (n = 7). The 52 patients had 72 vessels dilated. Criteria for success were a 5 ̆ 0 % increase in vessel diameter or a ≥ 20 % decrease in right ventricular to aortic pressure ratio. Results. Of 36 vessels with previously unsuccessful low pressure balloon dilation, 23 (63 %) were successfully dilated with high pressure balloons. Of the 36 remaining vessels, 29 (81 %) were successfully dilated with high pressure balloons. Factors associated with success were stenosis at a surgical anastomosis and disappearance of the balloon waist with dilation. Aneurysms developed in three vessels. Complications occurred in seven patients (13 %); in two patients the distal pulmonary artery was perforated by a stiff guide wire, causing death in one. Conclusions. Dilation of stenotic peripheral pulmonary arteries with high pressure balloons improves the success rate of angioplasty both in patients who have had unsuccessful dilation with a low pressure balloon and in those without previous attempted dilation...|$|R

Eight of the coarctation stents were electively underdilated at implantation. Coarctation stent redilata-tion increased median (range) lumen diameter from 9. 2 (6. 3 – 11. 1) mm to 11. 7 (9. 8 – 14. 1) mm (p = 0. 002), decreased gradient from 10. 5 (0 – 20) mm Hg to 0. 5 (0 – 15) mm Hg (p = 0. 008), and increased the ratio of stent diameter to descending aorta diameter from 0. 66 (0. 38 – 1. 02) to 0. 85 (0. 52 – 1. 2) (p = 0. 008).

40|$|This {{retrospective}} study attempts {{to assess the}} size and growth pattern of the pulmonary artery about 1 year after neonatal arterial switch operation for simple transposition of the great arteries. Sixty-seven patients underwent cardiac catheterization, including catheterization of {{the right and left}} pulmonary arteries, and right ventricular angiography an average of 13. 9 months after arterial switch operation. In 34 of these patients pre-operative right ventricular angiocardiograms were available. The diameter of the main pulmonary artery and that of its proximal right and left branches were measured. The values were compared to those of normal children matched for body surface area, taken from the literature and, for the branch values, related to the degree of <b>branch</b> <b>stenosis</b> and to the corresponding values, measured on pre-operative angiocardiograms. The cross-section of the main pulmonary artery after arterial switch operation with Lecompte manoeuvre becomes oval. The <b>branches</b> of the <b>pulmonary</b> artery are sometimes underdeveloped and this finding is related to <b>branch</b> <b>stenosis.</b> The ratio of the branch gradients is inversely proportional to the growth ratio of both branches while the pre- and postoperative Nakata indices are identical.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Pulmonary {{arterial}} stenosis {{is a relatively}} common complication after corrective operation of congenital heart disease. Unilateral stenosis of pulmonary arteries could result in decrease perfusion of affected lung, pulmonary regurgitation, or elevation of right ventricular pressure. Eventually there are increasing risks of right ventricular failure, arrhythmia, or sudden death. However we have limited data of pulmonary arterial stent in paediatric population as the treatment of <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>stenosis.</b> This study aimed at validating the effectiveness and investigating complications of pulmonary arterial stent implantation in a single institution during mid-term follow up period. Subjects and Methods: A total of 42 patients (50 stents) were implanted for treating <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> arterial <b>stenosis.</b> We used cardiac catheterization for comparing diameter after stent implantation directly and lung perfusion scan indirectly. We also investigated any adverse effect relating the procedure. Results: Percent stenosis of stenotic lesions were decreased from 54. 1 ± 10. 7 % to 22. 8 ± 12. 5 % (p< 0. 001) and degree of decrement in affected lung perfusion was declined from 22. 7 ± 8. 0 % to 10. 3 ± 9. 0 % (p< 0. 001) immediately and lasts during mid-term follow up period. Complication rate relating the procedure was 12 % (6 out of 12) {{and there was no}} mortality case.

Fifteen adult mongrel dogs had surgically created stenoses of either a <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery and/or superior vena cava.

40|$|ObjectiveCongenital heart defects with a {{component}} of pulmonary stenosis are often palliated in childhood by disrupting the pulmonary valve, either by means of dilation or excision. It is unclear what factors affect a patient's ability to tolerate long-term pulmonary insufficiency before requiring pulmonary valve replacement. We analyze potential factors {{that are related to}} the interval between pulmonary valve disruption and pulmonary valve replacement. MethodsOne hundred seven patients were analyzed. They had a congenital diagnosis of pulmonary stenosis or tetralogy of Fallot, had their first pulmonary valve replacement between 2002 and 2008, and had a known interval between pulmonary valve disruption and pulmonary valve replacement. The median age at the time of surgical intervention was 2 years for pulmonary valve disruption (range, 0 – 56 years) and 26 years for pulmonary valve replacement (range, 1 – 72 years). The median interval was 23 years (range, 0 – 51 years). Potential related factors were sex, race, initial diagnosis and procedure, age at pulmonary valve disruption, prior shunt operation, presence of <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>stenosis,</b> and degree of pulmonary regurgitation. ResultsAs determined by using univariate analysis, male patients had a shorter interval than female patients (median, 16 vs 26 years; P =. 01), and African American patients had a shorter interval than white patients (median, 16 vs 25 years; P =. 049). A significant correlation was also identified between age at the time of pulmonary valve disruption and the subsequent interval to pulmonary valve replacement. Overall, the interval tended to increase as age at disruption increased (P <. 0001). Although the presence of <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>stenosis</b> determined by the need for concomitant pulmonary arterioplasty was associated with a significantly shorter interval to pulmonary valve replacement (21 vs 24 years, P =. 02), stenosis determined based on small <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery diameter was correlated to a prolonged interval to pulmonary valve replacement (P =. 009). Initial diagnosis, prior palliative shunt operation, and degree of pulmonary regurgitation had no effect on the interval between pulmonary valve disruption and subsequent pulmonary valve replacement. As determined by using multivariate analysis, only male sex and small pulmonary artery diameter remained significant factors. ConclusionsMale sex appears to shorten the interval between pulmonary valve disruption and pulmonary valve replacement, whereas small <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery diameter appears to lengthen the interval. Knowing which factors are detrimental and which are protective might help identify patients who are prone to a more rapid progression of right heart failure from free pulmonary insufficiency, possibly steering them toward more frequent follow-up or more aggressive heart failure medical regimens...|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectivesThis {{study was}} {{designed}} to assess the safety, efficacy, medium-term outcome, and complications of patent ductus arteriosus (PDA) stenting in duct-dependent pulmonary circulation. BackgroundPatent ductus arteriosus stenting has been proposed as an alternative to surgical shunt on account of postoperative morbidity and complications of surgical shunting. MethodsBetween April 2000 and February 2003, 69 patients with duct-dependent pulmonary circulation underwent cardiac catheterization with the intent of PDA stenting as first palliative procedure. Patients with critical pulmonary stenosis and pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum post-radiofrequency valvotomy who had PDA stenting were excluded. Thirteen more patients were excluded because of <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery (PA) <b>stenosis.</b> The follow-up was by clinical examination, echocardiography, and repeat cardiac catheterization at six to nine months following the procedure. ResultsPatent ductus arteriosus stenting was successful in 51 patients (91. 1 %) and failed in 5 patients (8. 9 %). The mean narrowest PDA diameter was 1. 9 ± 0. 6 mm. The mean procedure and fluoroscopy time were 95. 7 min and 29. 4 min, respectively. In one patient the stent dislodged and migrated to the left femoral artery and another patient developed transient intravascular hemolysis. There was no procedure-related mortality. Three patients (5. 9 %) died one day to two months after the procedure. At follow-up (3. 2 months to 2. 4 years), 8 patients developed significant stent stenosis requiring reintervention. Seven patients developed worsening of preexisting <b>branch</b> PA <b>stenosis.</b> The freedom from reintervention was 89 % and 55 % at 6 months and 1 year, respectively.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{evaluate}} the feasibility of re-expansion of balloon expandable intravascular stents and to examine the gross and histologic effects of re-expansion on vascular integrity. Background. Intravascular stents have been used successfully as an adjunct to balloon dilation of congenital <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>branch</b> <b>stenosis</b> and postoperative stenosis of the pulmonary arteries in children. However, use of rigid stents in children could result in development of relative stenosis at the site of stent implantation with subsequent growth of the child. Methods. Stainless steel “iliac” stents were placed in the thoracic aorta of 10 normal juvenile swine by a transcatheter technique. Angiography and re-expansion were performed at a mean of 11 weeks (n = 9) and again at 18 weeks (n = 5). After euthanasia, the aortic specimens were removed for gross and histologic examination. Results. Stents were successfully implanted in 10 swine. Re-expansion was successfully performed in each animal at 11 weeks and at 18 weeks. Aortic growth produced a relative constriction of the aorta of 20 % ± 10 % (mean ± SD) at the site of stent implantation at both 11 and 18 weeks. Re-expansion produced a significant increase in mean stent diameter from 10. 1 ± 1 mm to 12. 3 ± 1. 2 mm at 11 weeks and from 11. 2 ± 0. 7 to 13. 5 ± 1. 1 mm at 18 weeks after implantation (p < 0. 001). Balloon dilation produced a relative increase in stent diameter of 21 % ± 7 % at 11 weeks and 18 % ± 4 % at 18 weeks. Stent re-expansion was accompanied by plastic deformation of the neointima without neointimal dissection. Where neointima was thick, there was no evidence of neointimal abrasion, but where neointima was thin, areas of localized neointimal abrasion were observed with focal fibrin and platelet adherence to the stent struts. There was no evidence of medial or adventitial hemorrhage or dissection produced by re-expansion. Conclusions.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: Balloon {{expandable}} stents are {{an integral}} part in the catheter treatment of congenital heart disease. In the growing child, stents require dilatation to greater diameters over time. The Cook Formula stent is a recent 316 stainless steel open-cell design licensed for peripheral vascular work. METHODS: Following extensive ex vivo studies, 112 stents were implanted in 97 children [median age 3. 9 (0. 01 - 17. 6) years; median weight 13. 7 (2. 4 - 62. 8) kg] over a 27 -month (Oct 2011 -Dec 2013) period. RESULTS: Bench testing revealed that there was no stent shortening for dilatation to nominal diameter and beyond. The 5 mm stents could be dilated up to 10 mm, and the 10 mm stents to 20 mm. Stents were implanted through 4 - 7 F sheaths or guide catheters over appropriate wires. Stent tracking and delivery was excellent. Twenty-three stents were implanted in the right ventricular outflow tract in Fallot-type lesions, 53 for <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>stenosis</b> (22 post cavopulmonary shunt/Fontan), 14 conduit stenosis, 13 Fontan fenestrations, 3 PDA in hybrid stage I Norwood, 5 in coarctation, and 1 for SVC obstruction.

Truncus arteriosus consists of a single great arterial trunk with the systemic, pulmonary, and coronary circulation, with no atretic aortic or pulmonary vessel. The complex cardiac anatomy can be delineated with transesophageal and transthoracic echocardiography, as is illustrated the case of our patient, who was diagnosed in infancy, at 5 months of age. This is the oldest documented case report of Type 3 truncus arteriosus with balanced biventricular anatomy, whose survival was secondary to an innate severe <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>stenosis.</b> <Learning objective: This case report documents the echocardiographic features of a rare congenital cardiac anatomy of truncus arteriosus where survival for the majority is only in infancy but those with pulmonary hypertension can survive to their 4 th decade.

40|$|Congenital {{heart disease}} (CHD) {{is the most}} common form of {{cardiovascular}} diseases in children. In Thailand, there has not been available information about congenital heart disease in neonates. Between January 1 st and December 31 st, 2000, all full-term babies born at Siriraj Hospital with detected heart murmur within the first week of life were consulted to pediatric cardiologists. Echocardiography was performed for diagnosis in every baby. Total livebirths during that period were 11, 245 cases. Heart murmurs were detected in 83 cases. The incidence of heart murmur within the first week of life was 7. 38 : 1, 000 livebirths. Innocent murmurs were found in 34 cases and echocardiogram revealed no detectable cardiac anomalies (2 cases), mild tricuspid regurgitation (2 cases), physiologic <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>stenosis</b> (4 cases), and small size PDA (< 2 mm., 26 cases). Forty-nine cases had CHDs. The incidence of CHD was 4. 36 : 1, 000 livebirths. At the time of initial diagnosis, 22 cases (44. 8 %) were asymptomatic. Among these patients, 1 case had serious cardiac anomaly, i. e., tetralogy of Fallot. There were 27 cases with symptoms, including 15 cases (30. 6 %) with tachypnea, 8 cases (16. 4 %) with cyanosis and 4 cases (8. 2 %) with congestive heart failure. The 3 most common cardiac diseases were ventricular septal defect (9 cases, 18. 4 %), patent ductus arteriosus greater than 2 mm. (8 cases, 16. 3 %), and atrial septal defect (8 cases, 16. 3 %). Those with CHDs were treated with anticongestive medications (22 cases, 44. 8 %), prostaglandin...|$|R

40|$|ObjectiveThe {{modified}} Blalock-Taussig shunt is {{the most}} commonly used palliative procedure for infants with ductal-dependent pulmonary circulation. Recently, catheter-based stenting of the ductus arteriosus has been used by some centers to avoid surgical shunt placement. We evaluated the durability and safety of ductal stenting {{as an alternative to the}} modified Blalock-Taussig shunt. MethodsA single-institution, retrospective review of patients undergoing modified Blalock-Taussig shunt versus ductal stenting was performed. Survival, procedural complications, and freedom from reintervention were the primary outcome variables. ResultsA total of 42 shunted and 13 stented patients with similar age and weight were identified. Survival to second-stage palliation, definitive repair, or 12 months was similar between the 2 groups (88 % vs 85 %; P = . 742). The incidence of surgical or catheter-based reintervention to maintain adequate pulmonary blood flow was 26 % in the shunted patients and 25 % in the stented patients (P =  1. 000). Three shunted patients (7 %) required intervention to address contralateral pulmonary artery stenosis and 3 (7 %) required surgical reintervention to address nonpulmonary blood flow-related complications. The need for ipsilateral or juxtaductal pulmonary artery intervention at, or subsequent to, second-stage palliation or definitive repair was similar between the 2 groups. ConclusionsFreedom from reintervention to maintain adequate pulmonary blood flow was similar between infants undergoing modified Blalock-Taussig shunt or ductal stenting as an initial palliative procedure. However, a greater percentage of shunted patients experienced procedure-related complications and distal <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> artery <b>stenosis.</b> Palliative ductal stenting appears to be a safe and effective alternative to modified Blalock-Taussig in selected infants...|$|R
40|$|AbstractOBJECTIVESWe {{sought to}} {{determine}} the incidence of and risk factors {{for the development of}} restenosis and neointimal proliferation after endovascular stent implantation for congenital heart disease (CHD). BACKGROUNDRisk factors for the development of restenosis and neointimal proliferation are poorly understood. METHODSThis was a retrospective review of patients who underwent endovascular stent redilation between September 1989 and February 2000. RESULTSOf 368 patients who had 752 stents implanted, 220 were recatheterized. Of those 220 patients, 103 underwent stent redilation. Patients were classified into three groups: 1) those with pulmonary artery stenosis (n = 94), tetralogy of Fallot/pulmonary atresia (n = 72), congenital <b>branch</b> <b>pulmonary</b> <b>stenosis</b> (n = 9), status post-Fontan operation (n = 6), status post-arterial switch operation (n = 7); 2) those with iliofemoral venous obstruction (n = 6); and 3) those with miscellaneous disorders (n = 3). The patients’ median age was 9. 9 years (range 0. 5 to 39. 8); their mean follow-up duration was 3. 8 years (range 0. 1 to 10). Indications for stent redilation included somatic growth (n = 67), serial dilation (n = 27) and development of neointimal proliferation or restenosis, or both (n = 9). There was a low incidence of neointimal proliferation (1. 8 %) and restenosis (2 %). There were no deaths. Complications included pulmonary edema (n = 1), hemoptysis (n = 1) and contralateral stent compression (n = 2). CONCLUSIONSRedilation or further dilation of endovascular stents for CHD is effective as late as 10 years. The risk of neointimal proliferation (1. 8 %) and restenosis (2 %) is low and possibly avoidable. Awareness of specific risk factors and modification of the stent implantation technique, including avoidance of minimal stent overlap and sharp angulation of the stent to the vessel wall and avoidance of overdilation, have helped to reduce the incidence of restenosis...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{anomalous}} {{origin of}} <b>pulmonary</b> <b>branches</b> {{is a rare}} entity where, either the right or the left pulmonary arteries arise from the ascending aorta and where the aortic and pulmonary valves are separated. Clinical manifestations usually appear in the infant or, more rarely, in the newborn and include respiratory distress or congestive heart failure due to increased pulmonary resistance. The survival rate in an Indian series was 94 % {{with the death of}} one patient from Fallot tetralogy. We have treated five patients with this congenital heart disease in 20 years; the survival rate was of 80 % and in all survival cases, the systolic pressure was significantly decreased. The current treatment of choice, consisting of the anatomical correction with translocation of the right pulmonary artery to the pulmonary trunk, was first performed by Kirkpatrick in 1961. The aim {{of this paper is to}} show the Mexican experience in the diagnosis and treatment of the anomalous origin of <b>pulmonary</b> <b>branches</b> from the ascending aorta. ConclusionEarly surgery with timely correction of this congenital heart disease improves the prognosis and survival rate of patients, with a reduction in pulmonary hypertension. <Learning objective: This article reports a series of cases of anomalous origin of the <b>pulmonary</b> <b>branches</b> from the ascending aorta. This is a rare congenital anomaly of difficult clinical diagnosis that is often accompanied by other associated anomalies. The diagnosis is based on image studies such as computed tomography and echocardiography and the hemodynamic evaluation is essential to determine a surgical procedure.
