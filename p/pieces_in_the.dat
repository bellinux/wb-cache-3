5|$|American author Dan Savage (born October 7, 1964) {{has written}} six books, op-ed <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>The</b> New York Times, and an advice column on sexual issues in The Stranger (an {{alternative}} newspaper from Seattle, Washington). A {{graduate of the}} University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign, Savage began contributing a column, Savage Love, to The Stranger from its inception in 1991. By 1998 his column had a readership of four million. He was Associate Editor at the newspaper from 1991 to 2001, when he became its editor-in-chief, later becoming its editorial director in 2007.|$|E
5|$|Artefacts in the {{collection}} include stone sculptures, ceramics and artefacts sculpted from bone, shell, obsidian and flint. The <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> museum graphically depict {{the two sides of}} the power exercised by Toniná, on the one hand with sculptures of the city's rulers and on the other with its depictions of bound prisoners of war.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to his French chansons, he wrote at least three <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> manner of the Italian frottola, a popular Italian song form which he would have encountered during his years in Milan. These songs include Scaramella, El grillo, and In te domine speravi. They are even simpler in texture than his French chansons, being almost uniformly syllabic and homophonic, and they remain among the most frequently sung portions of his output.|$|E

5|$|Rodin {{earned his}} living collaborating with more {{established}} sculptors on public commissions, primarily memorials and neo-baroque architectural <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> style of Carpeaux. In competitions for commissions he submitted models of Denis Diderot, Jean-Jacques Rousseau, and Lazare Carnot, all to no avail. On his own time, {{he worked on}} studies leading {{to the creation of}} his next important work, St. John the Baptist Preaching.|$|E
5|$|Benchley {{started at}} the Tribune as a reporter. He was a very poor one, unable to get {{statements}} from people quoted in other papers, and eventually had greater success covering lectures around the city. He was promised a position at the Tribunes Sunday magazine when it launched, and he {{was moved to the}} magazine's staff soon after he was hired, eventually becoming chief writer. He wrote two articles a week: the first a review of non-literary books, the other a feature-style article about whatever he wanted. The liberty gave his work new life, and the success of his <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> magazine convinced his editors to give him a signed byline column in the Tribune proper.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} LP era little of Holst's music was {{available}} on disc. Only {{six of his}} works {{are listed in the}} 1955 issue of The Record Guide: The Planets (recordings under Boult on HMV and Nixa, and another under Sir Malcolm Sargent on Decca); the Perfect Fool ballet music; the St Paul's Suite; and three short choral <b>pieces.</b> <b>In</b> <b>the</b> stereo LP and CD eras numerous recordings of The Planets were issued, performed by orchestras and conductors from round the world. By {{the early years of the}} 21st century most of the major and many of the minor orchestral and choral works had been issued on disc. The 2008 issue of The Penguin Guide to Recorded Classical Music contained seven pages of listings of Holst's works on CD. Of the operas, Savitri, The Wandering Scholar, and At the Boar's Head have been recorded.|$|E

5|$|Lazzell {{returned}} to Provincetown {{the following summer}} and requested that painting instructor, Oliver Chaffee, teach her the white-line woodcut technique innovated by B.J.O. Nordfeldt and adopted {{by a group of}} artists who had spent the previous winter in Provincetown. The white-line woodcuts were inspired by Japanese ukiyo-e woodblock prints, but only used a single block of wood. Designs were etched into the surface of woodblocks, with the incised lines separating sections of the blocks. The sections were individually painted and printed onto paper with the carved portions forming white lines. Lazzell and other artists specializing in the white-line technique formed the Provincetown Printers, an artist collective that later would earn national recognition. Toward the close of 1916 she traveled to Manhattan where she studied with Homer Boss and did an analysis of color with William E. Schumacher. Two of her <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> white-line style were exhibited in the Provincetown Art Association's annual show in 1917.|$|E
5|$|Mahjong: The Dutch {{journalist}} and writer Jelte Rep {{writes that the}} gambling game of mahjong (Traditional Chinese: 麻將; Pinyin: májiàng), which employs a set of over a hundred tiles, was first invented in 1846 by Zhen Yumen, a Qing Dynasty (1644–1912) diplomatic official from Ningbo. However, Rep traces {{the origins of the}} game to a card game of the Tang Dynasty (618–907) which used thirty-two wood or ivory <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> shape of cards. This evolved into the forty-card game of madiao (馬吊) during the Ming Dynasty (1368–1644), which had four suits of cards instead of the three found in modern mahjong.|$|E
5|$|Marty O'Donnell again {{composed}} the original {{score for the}} game. Some pieces of the game's music are produced with a much larger real orchestra than any <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prior two games. For example, the music for the announcement trailer was recorded with a 60-piece orchestra and a 24-piece choir. Halo 3 is the first game in the series to feature custom soundtracks, allowing players to replace in-game music with their own choices. The Halo 3 Original Soundtrack was released on November 20, 2007. Included on the soundtrack is an original composition submitted by fans and judged by Nile Rodgers, Michael Ostin, and Marty O'Donnell.|$|E

5|$|On February 28, 2001, the Nisqually {{earthquake}} {{rocked the}} 5th Avenue Theatre. At the time, actors were on stage rehearsing the musical 1776. The theatre suffered minimal damages with no structural {{damage from the}} quake. Earthquake repairs included removal and replacement of 72 plaster ceiling supports and the repair of numerous cracks and damaged decorative plaster <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> ceiling. Contractors had to install scaffolding tall enough to reach the highest interior crevice in the ceiling eight stories up—the first time that area had been reached in 75 years. The chandeliers had to be lowered for repair and maintenance. As part of the repair work, Turner Construction provided services for seismic upgrades to the Skinner Building.|$|E
5|$|The Cummer Museum’s art {{collection}} has expanded {{from the group}} of more than 60 works of Ninah Cummer's collection to over 5,000 works of art. The permanent collection spans from 2100 BCE through the 21st century and includes pieces created by Peter Paul Rubens, Winslow Homer, Thomas Moran, Norman Rockwell, and Romare Bearden. It {{is also home to}} the Wark Collection of Early Meissen Porcelain. <b>Pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> museum's collection were either donated to the museum, like the Wark collection, or they were purchased using the museum's acquisition fund, which is sustained through individual gifts and fundraising events.|$|E
5|$|The European collection, {{which is}} {{organized}} into works before 1800 and works from 1800–1945, includes highlights such as Aristotle by Jusepe de Ribera and The Flageolet Player on the Cliff by Paul Gauguin. Rembrandt's Self-Portrait {{is part of}} the Clowes Fund Collection, which comprises a number of significant Old Masters pieces. Part of the Neo-Impressionist collection, The Channel of Gravelines, Petit Fort Philippe by Georges Seurat {{was one of the first}} works to be donated by Caroline Marmon Fesler in the 1940s. Fesler would go on to donate a number of important works, including her bequest in 1961 of notable 20th-century modernism pieces that included Pablo Picasso, Chagall, and Matisse. <b>Pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> American collection represent American Impressionism and Modernism, including works by Georgia O'Keeffe and George Inness. Significant pieces include Hotel Lobby (1943) by Edward Hopper and Boat Builders by Winslow Homer.|$|E

5|$|The final {{part of the}} {{ceremony}} was marked with the drawing of lots. It was assisted by Vladimir Kramnik and Hou Yifan as the highest-rated players of the highest-ranked teams in the open and women's event, respectively, who joined the Chief Arbiter Faiq Hasanov for the drawing of colours. The draw resulted in Hou picking the White pieces, meaning that all players in the women's section with odd board numbers (1 or 3) will be White in the first round; and Kramnik picking the Black pieces, meaning that all players in the open section with odd board numbers (1 or 3) will have the Black <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> opening round.|$|E
5|$|The {{proportions}} {{were chosen}} arbitrarily {{in all but}} the last four <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> cycle: sonatas XIII and XVI use symmetrical proportions, and sonatas XIV and XV share the 2, 2, 3, 3 proportion. This symmetry, and the adherence of all four sonatas to the ten-bar unit, were explained by Cage as an expression of tranquility. The complexity of proportions prompted Cage to use asymmetric musical phrases and somewhat frequent changes of time signature to achieve both microscopic and macroscopic correlation. For example, unit length of 8½ in the first section of Sonata III is achieved by using six bars in 2/2 time and two in 5/4 (rather than eight bars in 2/2 and one in 1/2). In many sonatas the microstructure—how the melodic lines are constructed—deviates slightly from the pre-defined proportion.|$|E
5|$|After {{the legions}} under Flamininus had {{returned}} to Italy, the Greek states were once again on their own. The dominant powers in the region at this time were the kingdom of Macedon, which had recently lost a war against Rome, the Aetolians, the strengthened Achaean League and a reduced Sparta. The Aetolians, who had opposed the Roman intervention in Greek affairs, incited Nabis to retake his former territories and position among the Greek powers. By 192, Nabis who had built a new fleet and strengthened his army, besieged Gythium. The Achaeans responded by sending an envoy to Rome with a request for help. In response the Senate sent the praetor Atilius with a navy to defeat Nabis' navy {{as well as an}} embassy headed by Flamininus. Instead of waiting for the Roman fleet to arrive, the Achaean army and navy headed towards Gythium under the command of Philopoemen. The Achaean fleet was defeated by the recently constructed Spartan fleet, with the Achean flagship falling to <b>pieces</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> first ramming attack. On land as well the Achaeans could not defeat the Spartan forces outside Gythium and Philopoemen retreated to Tegea. When Philopoemen reentered Laconia for a second attempt his forces were ambushed by Nabis' but nevertheless he managed to gain a victory. The Achaeans now could ravage Laconia for thirty days unopposed while the Spartan troops remained in their fortified city. Plans for capturing Sparta itself had been laid by the time the Roman envoy Flamininus arrived and convinced the Achaean strategus Philopoemen to spare it. For the time being Nabis decided to accept the status quo in return and surrender under the same conditions as the last treaty.|$|E
