2500|$|When {{performed}} with a YAG laser {{designed specifically for}} vitreolysis, reported side effects and complications associated with vitreolysis are rare. However, YAG lasers have traditionally been designed {{for use in the}} anterior portion of the eye, i.e. <b>posterior</b> <b>capsulotomy</b> and iridotomy treatments. As a result, they often provide a limited view of the vitreous, which can make it difficult to identify the targeted floaters and membranes. They also carry a high risk of damage to surrounding ocular tissue. Accordingly, vitreolysis is not widely practised, being performed by very few specialists. One of them, John Karickhoff, has performed the procedure more than 1,400 times and claims a 90 percent success rate. However, the MedicineNet web site states that [...] "there is no evidence that this [...] is effective. The use of a laser also poses significant risks to the vision in what is otherwise a healthy eye." [...] A YAG laser optimized for use in the posterior segment, in addition to use in the anterior segment, is recommended for vitreolysis. In order to visualize the floater and target accordingly, the laser's light source must be positioned in the same optical axis as the ophthalmologist's visual axis. Most conventional YAG lasers, in contrast, use a lower angle of illuminating light. Whilst these lasers are well-suited to use in the anterior part of the eye, they are ill-equipped for use in the vitreous chamber, and thereby make it difficult for the ophthalmologist to visualize (and treat) the floater(s).|$|E
50|$|A capsulotomy (rarely {{known as}} cystotomy) is a {{procedure}} {{to open a}} portion of the lens capsule, using an instrument called a cystotome. An anterior capsulotomy refers to the opening of the front portion of the lens capsule, whereas a <b>posterior</b> <b>capsulotomy</b> refers to the opening of the back portion of the lens capsule. In phacoemulsification, the surgeon performs an anterior continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis, to create a round and smooth opening through which the lens nucleus can be emulsified and the intraocular lens implant inserted.|$|E
5000|$|The first {{successful}} use of photodisruption was in 1972, {{on a case}} of trabecular meshwork.

[...] The technique is most commonly used for lithotripsy of unrinary calculi and the treatment of <b>posterior</b> <b>capsulotomy</b> of the lens. [...] When used in corneal surgery, picosecond and nanosecond disruptors are used on the lamellae of the corneal stroma, and the method may be preferable as it leaves the epithelium and Bowman's membrane unharmed. This modifies the outer corneal curvature, which affects the refractive property of the eye.|$|E

40|$|Background: The pulsed {{electron}} avalanche knife (PEAK-fc) {{is a new}} pulsed electrosurgical device that allows for precise, ``cold'' and traction-free tissue dissection. Aim: To evaluate the surgical applicability, safety and potential complications of PEAK-fc in complicated cataract surgery. Methods: The study included five children with congenital cataracts, two patients with advanced senile cataracts, six adults with mature cataracts, three of them with posterior iris synechia, three patients with post-traumatic cataracts with zonulolysis, one patient with intumescent traumatic cataract and three patients with massive anterior capsule opacification. Anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>capsulotomies,</b> iris synechiolysis, dissection of anterior capsule opacification and fibrotic scar tissue were performed. PEAK-fc was set at voltages of 500 [...] 700 V, pulse duration of 0. 1 m and repetition rate of 40 [...] 100 Hz. Results: Anterior and <b>posterior</b> <b>capsulotomies</b> were successfully and safely performed in all eyes. The edges of capsulotomies appeared sharp, showing only limited collateral damage. PEAK-fc worked best by just gently touching the capsule, thereby avoiding tractional forces or pressure on the lens capsule. Posterior iris synechiae could be released and anterior capsule opacification was dissected without complications. Conclusions: PEAK-fc is a very helpful cutting device for complicated cases of cataract surgery, especially for mature and congenital cataracts, traumatic zonulolysis or anterior segment complications after intraocular inflammation. ...|$|R
30|$|Several reports {{record a}} {{functional}} improvement in 31 to 70 % {{of the patients}} [7, 11, 25, 28]. In this series, improvement occurred in 33 % of the cases. Published results for correction of knee flexion contractures, irrespective of method, were excellent or good in 30 – 69 % of the cases, average in 14 – 60 % of the cases, and unsatisfactory in 10 – 21 % of the cases [20, 25, 27]. These results are similar to ours: 56 % excellent and good, 33 % average, and 11 % unsatisfactory. Genu recurvatum occurs in 4 – 16 % after hamstring lengthening but seldom has a significant functional effect as it does not usually exceed 5 – 10 ° and also improves with time [9, 11, 16, 24]. In our study, 25 % of our patient population experienced genu recurvatum. This high percentage {{was due to the}} association, in some cases, of gastrocnemius and distal hamstring lengthening and <b>posterior</b> <b>capsulotomies.</b> Nevertheless, and in agreement with other authors, we do not consider this evidence of a functional repercussion because it does not exceed 10 ° [9, 24]. Another complication we encountered was femorotibial arthrodiatasis which took place through technical error when applying joint distraction instead of extension; it is mentioned by other authors in up to 12 % of the cases [20, 27], and we observed that this is totally reversible and it does not cause permanent sequelae.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{people can}} develop a {{posterior}} capsular opacification (PCO, also called an after-cataract). As a physiological change expected after cataract surgery, the posterior capsular cells undergo hyperplasia and cellular migration, showing up as a thickening, opacification and clouding of the posterior lens capsule (which is left behind when the cataract was removed, for placement of the IOL). This may compromise visual acuity and the ophthalmologist can use a device to correct this situation. It can be safely and painlessly corrected using a laser device to make small holes in the posterior lens capsule of the crystalline. It usually is a quick outpatient procedure that uses a Nd-YAG laser (neodymium-yttrium-aluminum-garnet) to disrupt and clear the central portion of the opacified posterior lens capsule (<b>posterior</b> <b>capsulotomy).</b> This creates a clear central visual axis for improving visual acuity. In very thick opacified posterior capsules, a surgical (manual) capsulectomy is the surgical procedure performed. A YAG capsulotomy is, however, a factor which must be taken in consideration {{in the event of}} IOL replacement as vitreous can migrate toward the anterior chamber through the opening hitherto occluded by the IOL.|$|E

40|$|AIMS/BACKGROUND—Compared with {{nanosecond}} (ns) {{pulses of}} conventional Nd-YAG lasers, picosecond (ps) laser pulses allow intraocular surgery at considerably lower pulse energy. The authors report initial clinical experiences using a Nd:YLF ps laser {{for the treatment}} of various indications for photodisruption.  METHODS—A Nd:YLF laser system (ISL 2001, wavelength 1053  nm) was used to apply pulse series of 100 - 400 µJ single pulse energy at a repetition rate of 0. 12 - 1. 0 kHz. Computer controlled patterns were used to perform iridectomies (n= 53), capsulotomies (n= 9), synechiolysis (n= 3), and pupilloplasties (n= 2). Other procedures were vitreoretinal strand incision (n= 2) and peripheral retinotomy (n= 1). For comparison, 10  capsulotomies and 20  iridotomies were performed with a Nd:YAG ns laser. The ps laser cut of an anterior capsule was assessed by scanning electron microscopy (SEM).  RESULTS—Open, well defined iridectomies (mean total energy 4028  mJ, mean diameter 724  µm) were achieved at first attempt in 92 % of the cases. In 64 % an iris bleeding and in 21 % an IOP increase of > 10 mm Hg occurred. All capsulotomies were performed successfully (mean energy 690  mJ/mm cutting length) but with a high incidence of intraocular lens damage. The attempted vitreoretinal applications remained unsuccessful as a result of optical aberrations of the eye and contact lens. Although ps laser capsulotomies and iridectomies required much higher total energy than ns procedures, the resulting tissue effects of the ps pulses were more clearly defined. SEM examination of a ps incision of the anterior lens capsule demonstrated, nevertheless, that the cut was more irregular than the edge of a continuous curvilinear capsulorhexis.  CONCLUSION—Series of ps pulses applied in computer controlled patterns can be used effectively for laser surgery in the anterior segment and are considerably less disruptive than ns pulses. The ps laser is well suited for laser iridectomies while the ns laser is preferable for <b>posterior</b> <b>capsulotomies.</b> As vitreoretinal applications remained unsuccessful, the range of indications for intraocular photodisruption could not be extended by the ps laser.    Keywords: picosecond laser; intraocular photodisruption; capsulotomy; iridotomy; iridectom...|$|R

Methods: This retrospective chart review comprised 75 pseudophakic eyes (55 consecutive patients) with a SN 6 AD 1 or SN 6 AD 3 IOL after cataract surgery or refractive lens exchange, treated for posterior capsule opacification with Nd:YAG laser <b>posterior</b> <b>capsulotomy.</b> Values of monocular uncorrected distance acuity (UCDA), monocular corrected distance acuity (CDVA), spherical equivalent (SE), defocus equivalent (DE), astigmatic power vectors J 0 and J 45 and overall blurring strength (B) after Nd:YAG <b>posterior</b> <b>capsulotomy</b> were compared with values of before the intervention. The amount of energy used during Nd:YAG <b>posterior</b> <b>capsulotomy</b> and the severity of PCO were evaluated to determine correlation with change in refraction. Values of autorefraction were compared with those of subjective refraction to determine the correlation between the two methods. Results: Visual acuity improved statistically significant in both UDVA and CDVA (P 0, 5 D in subjective refraction. Of those eyes, 3 eyes (5, 5 %) had a deterioration of the refractive error.

40|$|Purpose: To {{compare the}} visual {{outcomes}} and complications of lensectomy and pos-terior chamber intraocular lens (PCIOL) implantation {{with or without}} posterior capsulo-tomy and anterior vitrectomy in older subjects with pediatric cataracts. Methods: Seventeen eyes of 12 children aged 10 to 15 years with congenital or deve-lopmental cataracts were randomly divided to two groups. Lensectomy and PCIOL (Alcon Acrysof MA 60 AC) implantation was performed with (8 eyes) or without (9 eyes) <b>posterior</b> <b>capsulotomy</b> and anterior vitrectomy. Results: Mean age {{at the time of}} surgery was 12. 3 ± 1. 5 (range 10 - 15) years and mean follow-up period was 18. 7 ± 11. 2 (range 6 - 36) months. Posterior capsule opacification developed in three eyes in the non-vitrectomy group; however, media opacification was mild and capsulotomy was not required in any case. All eyes in the vitrectomy group had a clear visual axis at final follow-up (P= 0. 2). No significant difference was observed between the two groups in term of visual acuity (P= 0. 3) or complications. Conclusion: Although <b>posterior</b> <b>capsulotomy</b> and anterior vitrectomy seems to be safe in pediatric cataract surgery, it may not be necessary as a routine procedure in older children...|$|E
30|$|Under the {{irrigation}} {{at one side}} port with a 25 -gauge infusion cannula, a 25 -gauge trocar was inserted perpendicularly to the scleral surface in the superotemporal quadrant of the pars plana to plicata junction at 1.5  mm from the corneal limbus. <b>Posterior</b> <b>capsulotomy</b> and anterior vitrectomy were done with a vitreous cutter. The trocar was removed and the scleral wound was sutured with 8 - 0 virgin silk. All surgeries were done by a single surgeon (T. M.) under general anesthesia.|$|E
40|$|AIM: To {{evaluate}} {{the impact of}} 4 different intraocular lenses (IOLs) on posterior capsule opacification (PCO) by comparing the neodymium: yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser capsulotomy rates. METHODS: This retrospective study included 4970 eyes of 4013 cataract patients who underwent phacoemulsification and IOL implantation between January 2000 and January 2008 by the same surgeon at one clinic. Four different IOLs were assessed. The outcome parameter was the incidence of Nd:YAG laser posterior capsulotomies. RESULTS: An Nd:YAG laser <b>posterior</b> <b>capsulotomy</b> was performed in 153 (3. 07...|$|E
40|$|A 78 -year-old man had uneventful {{cataract}} surgery with implantation of a 1 -piece plate–haptic {{intraocular lens}} in the capsular bag. Seven weeks later, he presented {{as an emergency}} with intense fibrinous uveitis and increased intraocular pressure (IOP). Examination revealed an inflammatory capsular block syndrome (CBS) causing fibrinous anterior uveitis and secondary angle-closure glaucoma. The glaucoma resolved and the patient’s vision improved following neodymium:YAG laser <b>posterior</b> <b>capsulotomy.</b> Inflammatory CBS {{should be considered in}} pseudophakic patients presenting with fibrinous anterior uveitis, increased IOP, and secondary angle closure...|$|E
30|$|As the {{standard}} of care at this hospital in the study period, intraocular lenses were not implanted in children with bilateral cataract while intraocular lenses were implanted in those with unilateral cataract. Ten children with bilateral cataract underwent lensectomy in both eyes with a 25 -gauge vitreous cutter under irrigation with a 25 -gauge infusion cannula, inserted from two side ports at the corneal limbus. Six children with unilateral cataract underwent intraocular lens implantation and <b>posterior</b> <b>capsulotomy</b> after lens aspiration from limbal side ports (Table  1).|$|E
40|$|A {{retrospective}} {{series of}} 117 highly myopic eyes with extracapsular cataract extractions and posterior chamber lens implants is presented. The results are analysed {{with reference to}} the current understanding of the complications anticipated. Of particular note is the use of low-powered posteriorly vaulted posterior chamber implants, with and without primary <b>posterior</b> <b>capsulotomy.</b> The results show a low retinal detachment rate (one eye, mean follow-up 12 months); low induced astigmatism (average 0. 86 D); low myopic postoperative refraction (median - 1. 0 D); and high patient satisfaction...|$|E
40|$|Patients {{undergoing}} neodymium:yttrium-aluminum-garnet (Nd:YAG) laser <b>posterior</b> <b>capsulotomy</b> for posterior capsular opacification after penetrating keratoplasty {{were reviewed}} retrospectively for incidence of graft rejection. All patients underwent extracapsular cataract extraction with posterior chamber intraocular lens implantation (PC-IOL) performed {{as a separate}} or combined procedure. Only one of 20 eyes (4. 7 %) of 20 patients developed corneal graft rejection over a follow-up period of 6 months to 6 years after capsulotomy. Nd:YAG laser capsulotomy {{does not appear to}} increase the risk of corneal graft rejection. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
