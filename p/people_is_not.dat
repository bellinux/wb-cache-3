5|$|At {{the same}} time, Athens orchestrated the {{creation}} of an alliance with Euboea, Megara, Achaea, Corinth, Acarnania and other states in the Peloponnese. However the most desirable ally for Athens was Thebes. To secure their allegiance, Demosthenes was sent, by Athens, to the Boeotian city; Philip also sent a deputation, but Demosthenes succeeded in securing Thebes's allegiance.* K. Tsatsos, Demosthenes, 284–285; H. Weil, Biography of Demosthenes, 41–42. Demosthenes' oration before the Theban <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> extant and, therefore, the arguments he used to convince the Thebans remain unknown. In any case, the alliance came at a price: Thebes's control of Boeotia was recognised, Thebes was to command solely on land and jointly at sea, and Athens was to pay two thirds of the campaign's cost.|$|E
5|$|Routine {{screening}} of asymptomatic <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> indicated, since {{the disease is}} highly curable in its early, symptomatic stages. Instead, women, particularly menopausal women, {{should be aware of}} the symptoms and risk factors of endometrial cancer. A cervical screening test, such as a Pap smear, is not a useful diagnostic tool for endometrial cancer because the smear will be normal 50% of the time. A Pap smear can detect disease that has spread to the cervix. Results from a pelvic examination are frequently normal, especially in the early stages of disease. Changes in the size, shape or consistency of the uterus and/or its surrounding, supporting structures may exist when the disease is more advanced. Cervical stenosis, the narrowing of the cervical opening, is a sign of endometrial cancer when pus or blood is found collected in the uterus (pyometra or hematometra).|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} Monpa <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> clearly defined. As other tribes of North East India, Monpa people is {{believed}} to have migrated to Tawang. Monpa people are believed to be the only nomadic tribe in Northeast India, viz., they were totally dependent on animals like sheep, cow, yak, goats and horses and had no permanent settlement or attachment to a particular place. This is the theory which claim that Monpa people might have migrated through the Western Himalaya and travelling via Sikkim route, might have settled in the Tawang area. This also claims that of Monpa people having connections to the Bhutias of the State of Sikkim.|$|E
25|$|Some {{cities have}} a very {{well-defined}} gay village {{in the heart of}} a larger area that also has a significant gay population. For example, Boystown in Chicago is a very well-defined gay village situated within the larger Lakeview neighborhood. Lakeview is an affluent neighborhood with a reputation for being a stronghold of liberal and progressive political views. Outside of Boystown, Lakeview is a mixture of both gay and straight citizens and families, but Boystown is the main gay village. Other examples of this phenomenon include Davie Village in the heart of Vancouver's gay community. It sits within the greater West End area, which, though decently populated by gay <b>people,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> necessarily considered a gay village.|$|E

25|$|Pit latrines {{may or may}} not be {{an enjoyable}} {{experience}} to use. Problems may occur when the pit latrine is shared by too many <b>people,</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> cleaned daily and not emptied when the pit is full. In such cases, flies and odour can be a massive nuisance. Also, pit latrines are usually dark places which are difficult to keep clean. Often, handwashing facilities are missing. For these reasons, shared pit latrines can be quite uncomfortable to use in developing countries. Also, there might be cultural preferences for open defecation and these may be difficult to overcome with unattractive toilet designs. This is currently being discussed amongst experts for the example in the case of rural India where behavior change campaigns are needed to reduce open defecation.|$|E
25|$|The {{history of}} the area is {{connected}} to the Chiapa people, who occupied the Central Valley area before the arrival of the Spanish. The origin of these <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known, but theories have them migrating north from Nicaragua or even Paraguay. Their main settlement was in Chiapa de Corzo near the canyon, with a fortified area in the higher areas in the canyon for protection from invasions. The Chiapa fiercely resisted Spanish conquest and were not subdued until the arrival of Diego de Mazariegos in 1528. Their last refuge was in the fortified area, now known as the archeological site of the Ruins of Berlin. Here the last of the Chiapa held out from 1528 to 1535 after the Spanish took over the main city. Legend states that when this last fortification fell, the remaining Chiapa committed collective suicide by jumping into the canyon. Since then, the canyon has served as a boundary marker between the Zoque and Tzotzil peoples.|$|E
500|$|The {{earliest}} attested {{reference to}} the Angles occurs in the 1st-century work by Tacitus, Germania, in which the Latin word Anglii is used. The etymology of the tribal name itself is disputed by scholars; {{it has been suggested}} that it derives from the shape of the Angeln peninsula, an angular shape. How and why a term derived from the name of a tribe that was less significant than others, such as the Saxons, came to be used for the entire country and its <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> known, but it seems this is related to the custom of calling the Germanic people in Britain Angli Saxones or English Saxons to distinguish them from continental Saxons (Eald-Seaxe) of Old Saxony between Weser and Eider rivers in Northern Germany. In Scottish Gaelic, another language which developed on the island of Great Britain, the Saxon tribe gave their name to the word for England (Sasunn); similarly, the Welsh name for the English language is [...] "Saesneg".|$|E

500|$|In {{order to}} develop Whitney's sexual abuse storyline, by March 2008 EastEnders {{researchers}} Libby Duplock and Cleo Bicat were {{in contact with the}} NSPCC's Tom Narducci, Jude Toasland, who deals with abused children, and Yvonne Traynor, CEO of the Rape and Sexual Abuse Support Centre. Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing that was quite difficult for me to get right was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough." [...] Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show [...] "feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it [...] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they can do something about it. [...] We're not trying to cause a national panic. This is a responsible effort to try to get over an important story." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{break between}} {{the forces of}} Mihailović and Tito in the Territory of the Military Commander in Serbia reached eastern Bosnia in early November. In response, a joint Partisan-Chetnik conference was held in Vlasenica on 16 November. It was convened by Čolaković and Vukmanović without {{consulting}} the Partisan Provincial Committee for Bosnia-Herzegovina. Serbian Partisans were situated at Ljubovija at the time, ready to launch an offensive across the Drina against Dangić's forces in Bratunac and Srebrenica, but held off at Čolaković's request. At the conference, Čolaković tried to maintain the alliance, but Vukmanović raised Mihailović's attack on Tito's headquarters at Užice and the Chetnik's failure to fight Axis forces. Dangić questioned Vukmanović's Montenegrin background {{and told him to}} return to Montenegro. The Partisan representatives sought a policy of brotherhood and unity among Serbs, Muslims, and Croats, whereas Dangić stated that his Chetniks were fighting a purely Serbian war for the Serbian people. Dangić's envoys told them they intended [...] "to slit the throats of the Turks, except for any pretty Turkish ladies" [...] and [...] "screw down the Croats so hard that they wouldn't dare for a thousand years to look at a Serb askance." [...] At this conference the two sides failed to come to an agreement. The next day a separate Chetnik conference was held where a 14-article resolution was adopted in support of Dangić's views. Meanwhile, the Partisan General Staff of Bosnia and Herzegovina appealed to the Chetnik rank and file that Partisan-Chetnik cooperation was broken due to the Chetnik importation of Royal Yugoslav Army officers from Serbia to Bosnia and due to Dangić wanting [...] "to turn our People's Liberation Struggle into a war of Serbs against Muslims" [...] as opposed to the Partisan belief [...] "that the peaceful toiling Muslim <b>people</b> <b>is</b> <b>not</b> to blame for the crimes that the Ustaše have committed, and that the People's Liberation Army must protect them from persecution and killing." [...] The Staff charged that Dangić wished for [...] "Serbs to gather for a war of revenge" [...] instead of the Partisans' [...] "summon to our flag all honorable people, Serbs, Muslims, and Croats." [...] They claimed that Dangić attempted to collaborate with the Germans and Italians.|$|E
