The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate and compare the PPI of the anti-infective agents manufactured in Palestine with the imported equivalents. Method: The selection criteria generated 15 different anti-infective agents available as 36 locally manufactured products and 15 imported equivalents. The design of the <b>patient</b> <b>package</b> <b>insert</b> was evaluated in terms of the number of words used in eight main headings and the presence or absence of certain information regarding nine statements. Results: Inserts of locally manufactured products have significantly fewer words than those of imported products with respect to warnings, dosage and administration, and side effects. The most significant difference was found in the warnings. Moreover, differences were found between inserts of local and imported products in terms of the presence of the nine informative statements. Locally manufactured products did not mention inactive ingredients, clinical pharmacology or date of last revision, but all of them provided information on the use of the drug during pregnancy and lactation and on the duration of therapy. However, in general they provided less information than the imported equivalents. Conclusion: Palestinian authorities and local manufacturers should implement appropriate measures to regulate the quality and quantity of information in the <b>patient</b> <b>package</b> <b>insert</b> of locally produced anti-infective agents.

40|$|In Belgium, the {{distribution}} of medications to outpatients in community pharmacies is almost exclusively by branded unit-of-use packages, with a <b>package</b> <b>insert</b> inside every <b>package.</b> At {{the time of the}} study (spring 1990), the implementation of legislation that mandated a shift from highly technical documents to <b>patient</b> <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> (PPIs), understandable by the lay person, had begun. This study explores the attitude of practising physicians toward written medication information for patients. A mail questionnaire was sent to 1500 (8 % random sample) Belgian general practitioners and to 500 (22 % random sample) internal medicine specialists. A total of 543 usable questionnaires were returned (27. 5 % return rate). Ninety-two percent of the physicians stated that their patients seldom or never requested additional information on drug efficacy or side effects, during routine consultation; 30 % estimated that more than half of their patients read the PPI; 75 % expect that a patient would experience side effects after reading about them in the PPI; 59 % agreed that the PPI could help the patient react more adequately in unforeseen situations. It was possible to cluster the respondents in a stable segmentation of three clusters: moderately positive physicians (20 %), ambiguous to neutral physicians (44 %), physicians overtly negative to written drug information (36 %).

Methods: The first part of the study was a cross-sectional self-administered questionnaire. The questionnaire for consumers included 15 items. The questionnaire for healthcare professionals included 10 items and it was very similar to that of consumers with some modifications. In the second part, a random sample of PPIs was reviewed. In our community pharmacies, where medications are arranged according to their producing company, a researcher was asked to choose randomly 10 - 15 medications for every company to check for the availability of pharmacological, pharmaceutical and clinical information. Results: A total of 304 healthcare professionals out of 320 (95. 0 %) and 223 consumers out of 240 (92. 9 %) accepted to answer the survey. Forty five percent consumers reported that they always read the PPIs, and 29. 3 % said that they read the PPIs most of the times. Increased rate of reading the leaflet was found among females (P = 0. 047). The preferred language for the PPIs was Arabic for most of the consumers (89. 6 %) while it was English for most of the healthcare professionals (80. 8 %). 35. 9 % of the consumers and 43. 6 % of the healthcare professionals found the font size suitable. 42. 3 % of the consumers and 25. 5 % of the healthcare professionals said that they found the information in the PPIs useful and enough.

Setting: Female members of community social organizations, female relatives of psychology students, and caregivers to psychotic patients. Nature of the study: Randomized, controlled healthy human volunteer study with three parallel experiments, involving the inserts of cisapride, itraconazol, and risperidon. Design. Subjects were recruited in a convenience sample and randomized to one control and two intervention groups (one with a normal insert and one with an insert with a benefit message). Material and methods: Subjects were asked to read the inserts (using mock text in the control group) in 5 to 15 minutes. Knowledge of the medication was tested with 20 simple questions (to be answered Yes/No/Don't know) and benefit/risk perception with a five-point bipolar Likert scale. Results: In the three experiments respectively 89, 102, and 83 subjects were recruited. The provision of inserts increased the knowledge about medication in all the intervention groups. Thirty-one pet-cent, 41 %, and 54 % of the subjects who read a normal insert agreed that the benefit of the medicine was greater than its risks, compared to 62 %, 64 %, and 70 % of subjects who read an insert with a benefit message included (P < 0. 05 in all 3 experiments).

40|$|There {{has been}} {{increasing}} concernabout the adverse effects of some medications. Despite rigorous premarket evaluation of drug effects before a medi-cation can be approved for marketing by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), adverse effects are not uncom-mon, with nearly 400, 000 adverse events (of both prescription and over-the-counter [OTC] drugs) voluntarily report-ed to the FDA in 2007. 1 Recent years have also seen prominent instances in which serious adverse effects were at-tributed to marketed drugs, and in which focused analysis of safety data has re-vealed significant, if rare, adverse effects of some marketed drugs. 2 - 4 In response to this, drug manufactur-ers, pharmacies, and the FDA have sought to promote the safe use of medi-cations by educating patients, to warn them about potential adverse effects and provide directions about how to use medications safely, detect adverse ef-fects, and react to adverse effects appro-priately. 5 One key avenue for doing this is the inclusion of patient information materials (PIMs) —a variety of educa-tional and instructional materials dis-tributed to patients {{at the time a}} medication is dispensed. 5 A patient receiving medication may receive up to 3 differ-ent PIMs with overlapping content.

40|$|Background: There {{is growing}} {{international}} interest in involving patients in interventions {{to promote and}} support them in securing their own safety. This paper reports a systematic review of evaluations {{of the effectiveness of}} interventions that have been used with the explicit intention of promoting patient involvement in patient safety in healthcare. Methods: The authors searched Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews, Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects, CENTRAL, CINAHL, EMBASE, HMIC, MEDLINE, MEDLINE in-process, PsycINFO and ASSIA to August 2008. We also searched databases of reports, conference proceedings, grey literature, ongoing research and relevant patient safety organisations, and hand-searched two journals. Meta-analysis of the data was not appropriate; therefore, studies were categorised according to how the interventions encouraged patients' actions to improve safety-informing the management plan, monitoring and ensuring safe delivery of treatment (by health professional and by self), making systems safer-and were critiqued in a narrative manner. Findings: The authors identified 14 individual experimental and quasiexperimental studies plus one systematic review. The majority of studies fell into the monitoring and ensuring safe delivery of treatment by self category and were all related to enhancing medication safety. Authors reported improved patient safety incident outcomes for the intervention groups compared with controls where the interventions aimed to encourage patient involvement in: (1) monitoring and ensuring safe delivery of treatment by self (self-management of anticoagulation, 'easy' read information leaflet, nurse-led education to promote self-medication in hospital, <b>patient</b> <b>package</b> <b>insert</b> using lay terminology); (2) informing the management plan/monitoring and ensuring safe delivery of treatment by self (individualised teaching plan by nurse, pharmacist counselling). It was not possible to draw any clear conclusions as to the effectiveness of the interventions (with the exception of one specific aspect of self-medication, that is, self-management of anticoagulation) due to concerns about the methodological quality of the studies. Conclusions: There is limited evidence for the effectiveness of interventions designed to promote patient involvement on patient safety incidents and in general is poor quality. Existing evidence is confined to the promotion of safe self-management of medication, most notably relating to the self-management of oral anticoagulants...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{discusses}} the <b>patient</b> <b>package</b> <b>insert</b> (PPI), a folded {{sheet of paper}} in the drug package with a text {{which is supposed to}} be comprehensible for the general public. The PPI contains information on how the drug must be taken, on the risks of taking the drug, and a limited amount of information on whatthe drug is for. Belgium was the first country in Europe, together with Switzerland, to introduce PPIs. PPIs were first introduced in 1988 and the process was completed in 1992. In Europe, health authorities decided in 1992 that all medicinal product packages should contain a comprehensible insert. This decision is slowly but surely being implemented in all European countries. Similar developments did not take place in the US {{and other parts of the}} world, where medicines are distributed in bulk and dispensed without much information, even when dealing with powerful prescription drugs. During the introduction of PPIs in Belgium, a research programme wasconducted to evaluate this change in the way drug information was provided in the drug distribution system. This thesis provides an overview of the studiescarried out during that period. In addition, a number of other descriptive studies of the flow of drug information in specific patients groups is provided. Finally, a number of experimental studies is presented, which evaluate the impact of written drug information on patients? benefit/risk perception. The acceptance of a drug distribution system with mandatory PPIs in all drug packages will be evaluated on the basis of Belgium?s relatively long and welldocumented experience with PPIs. We address the following questions: what is the percentage of patients who read, accept and appreciate PPIs; what happens when a country changes from technical inserts with difficult jargon to comprehensible PPIs; what do we know about the impact of PPIs on patients knowledge and feelings about their drugs? In this thesis, an attempt is made to understand the mental processing of drug information which precedes patients' decisions and coping strategies, necessary for successful drug treatment. The question here is whether the PPI is capable of influencing the benefit/risk perception of patients. A further step is to study the impact of the PPI on behaviour. Here, other questions are at stake. Does the PPI have an impact on patients' reporting of health problems and side-effects, on their ability to carry out a treatment correctly and safely, on their adherence to therapy at the beginning of treatment, and on their motivation to continue crucial therapy? These questions are addressed only to a limited extent in this work, as we have focused on the preceding cognitive process of benefit/risk perception...|$|E

This report focuses on three types of prescription drug labeling: the prescribing information intended for health care practitioners, Medication Guides intended to inform patients about drugs FDA has determined pose a serious and significant public health concern, and <b>patient</b> <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> (PPI) required for oral contraceptives and estrogens. Stakeholders said an advantage of such a change would be that it could provide physicians, pharmacists, and patients with the most current drug information in a more user-friendly format, which would positively impact public health. For example, drug labeling could be made interactive to include hyperlinks to definitions of key terms or to additional information, enhancing patients' knowledge about the drugs they are using. However, stakeholders noted disadvantages that could offset any advantages gained from such a change. Relying on electronic labeling as a complete substitute for paper labeling could adversely impact public health by limiting the availability of drug labeling for some physicians, pharmacists, and patients by requiring them to access drug labeling through a medium with which they might be uncomfortable, that they might find inconvenient, or that might be unavailable. In addition, for electronic drug labeling to be successful, stakeholders said it is important to have a single data source that is reliable and unbiased for physicians, pharmacists, and patients to use, particularly given that there are multiple websites these groups can use to access information about prescription drugs. However, these websites that currently provide electronic labeling have limitations. For example, nongovernmental websites are not standardized, and one website can include information on a particular drug not included on another website. ...|$|R

The SMOG Readability Formula was used to determine the grade levels at which PPIs were written. One hundred thirty-six adults enrolled in GED classes in Tucson and other communities and 107 adults enrolled in remedial reading classes at Tucson's Pima Community College were administered the Zip Scale reading placement test and blocked by their reading abilities. Within each of the three blocks, subjects randomly received one of the seven information sheets or no sheet. Subjects took a multiple-choice test based upon information common to all of the PPIs, a cloze comprehension test based upon the PPI which they read, and completed a satisfaction survey which asked subjects to rate the PPI which they read. Subjects also read five vignettes describing fictitious patients taking thiazides who were confronted with different barriers to compliance. Subjects indicated how likely the fictitious patients were to overcome the barriers to compliance. Among this sample of remedial-reading adults, the Test PPI emerged as clearly superior to the others for any of the variables measured.

He was President of Watauga Corp, which operated Falcon Heights Pharmacy and Medical Supply (1966 - 1996) and Bel-Aire Pharmacy, a community based health center in White Bear Lake, MN (1981 - 2006). He left private practice in 2006. Throughout his career, he has been highly active in professional organizations and served as president of the American Pharmacists Association, the Minnesota Pharmacists Association, and the Minnesota Board of Pharmacy. He has also served as an industry advisor, on several boards of directors, and on national steering committees. In 1995, he was awarded an honorary doctorate from the Philadelphia College of Pharmacy and Sciences for his local, national, and international efforts. While in private practice, Anderson continued to play an active role in the University of Minnesota’s College of Pharmacy. He was named advisor to the dean from 1994 to 1997 and participated in many committees from the 1980 s through the 2000 s concerning planning, evaluation, and curriculum development. Anderson has served as co-director of the Center for Health Care Change since 2008, an adjunct professor in the College of Pharmacy since 2009, and manager of the UPlan MTM network for the University’s employee health plan since 2009. Lowell Anderson begins his interview with a reflection on his early life and education, highlighting his experience earning a bachelor’s degree in pharmacy from the University of Minnesota. He describes the profession’s receptiveness to female pharmacists, his recollections of the Kefauver Hearings regarding prescription drug pricing in the early 1960 s, and the impact of managed care on pharmacy. He goes on to discuss his professional goals; his time at Walgreen’s as a pharmacy student; his early career, including time at Northwestern Hospital and the State Department of Administration; and his experience of ownership of pharmacies in Falcon Heights (1966) and White Bear Lake. Within this discussion, he reflects on how relationships between health care professionals and pharmacists change in different venues, the differences between a chain pharmacy and a privately owned pharmacy, building community relationships, generic substitution, the <b>patient</b> <b>package</b> <b>insert,</b> patient expectations regarding drug advice from doctors and pharmacists, the function of Pharmacy Benefit Managers. The conversation then transitions to the Academic Health Center and Mr. Anderson’s contributions to the College of Pharmacy. The following topics are discussed: the introduction of clinical pharmacy in the College; relations between basic scientists and professional pharmacists in the College; relations among schools and colleges in the AHC; the potential creation of the Pharmacy Technician Program; the threatened shortage of pharmacists; the creation of the Department of Social and Administrative Pharmacy; the development of pharmaceutical care practice; and the Center for Leading Healthcare Change. He concludes his interview with current policy issues in which pharmacists should adopt a larger role...|$|E

40|$|Voxel-level {{absorbed dose}} (VLAD) is rarely {{calculated}} for nuclear medicine (NM) procedures involving unsealed sources or 90 Y microspheres (YM). The current standard of practice for absorbed dose calculations in NM utilizes MIRD S-values, which 1) assume a uniform distribution in organs, 2) {{do not use}} patient specific geometry, and 3) lack a tumor model. VLADs overcome these limitations. One reason VLADs are not routinely performed is the difficulty in obtaining accurate absorbed doses in a clinically acceptable time. The deterministic grid-based Boltzmann solver (GBBS) was recently applied to radiation oncology where it was reported as fast and accurate for both megavoltage photons and high dose rate nuclide-based photon brachytherapy. This dissertation had two goals. The first was {{to demonstrate that the}} general GBBS code ATTILA™ can be used for VLADs in NM, where primary photon and electron sources are distributed throughout a patient. The GBBS was evaluated in voxel-S-value geometries where agreement with Monte Carlo (MC) in the source voxel was 6 % for 90 Y and 131 I; 20 % differences were seen for mono-energetic 10 keV photons in bone. An adaptive tetrahedral mesh (ATM) generation procedure was developed using information from both the SPECT and CT for 90 Y and 131 I patients. The ATM with increased energy transport cutoffs, enabled GBBS transport to execute in under 2 (90 Y) and 10 minutes (131 I). GBBS absorbed doses to tumors and organs were within 4. 5 % of MC. Dose volume histograms were indistinguishable from MC. The second goal was to demonstrate VLAD value using 21 YM <b>patients.</b> <b>Package</b> <b>insert</b> dosimetry was not able to predict mean VLAD tumor absorbed doses. Partition model had large bias (factor of 0. 39) and uncertainty (± 128 Gy). Dose-response curves for hepatocellular carcinoma tumors were generated using logistic regression. The dose covering 70 % of volume (D 70) predicted binary modified RECIST response with an area under the curve of 80. 3 %. A D 70 88 Gy threshold yielded 89 % specificity and 69 % sensitivity. The GBBS was shown to be fast and accurate, flaws in clinical dosimetry models were highlighted, and dose-response curves were generated. The findings in this dissertation support the adoption of VLADs in NM...|$|R
30|$|SPC {{methods for}} RCP testing {{for the two}} {{existing}} formulations of 99 mTc-MAG 3, heated (<b>Package</b> <b>insert</b> for Technescan MAG 3. Mallinckrodt Suisse SA, 2003; <b>Package</b> <b>insert</b> for Technescan MAG 3. Mallinckrodt Suisse SA, 2015) and non-heated (<b>Package</b> <b>insert</b> for ROTOP-MAG- 3 Kit. Heider AG, 2006) differ and results are not {{in accordance with the}} Ph.Eur. specifications. Our new two-strip TLC method, combining two separations on the same type of support with two different solvent mixtures, {{has been found to be}} adequate for the determination of the RCP of 99 mTc-MAG 3 (<b>Package</b> <b>insert</b> for Technescan MAG 3. Mallinckrodt Suisse SA, 2003). The RCP obtained by TLC does not deviate significantly from the reference RCP determined by HPLC and PC following the Ph.Eur. method (European Pharmacopoeia Edition 7.0, 2008). The limit value for the total RCP is identic. This was not the case in former proposed methods where some impurities have been excluded and declared as insignificant (Seetharaman et al., 2006; Chen et al., 1993; <b>Package</b> <b>insert</b> for Technescan MAG 3. Mallinckrodt Suisse SA, 2003; <b>Package</b> <b>insert</b> for ROTOP-MAG- 3 Kit. Heider AG, 2006; <b>Package</b> <b>insert</b> for Technescan MAG 3. Mallinckrodt Suisse SA, 2015; <b>Package</b> <b>insert</b> for Technescan MAG 3, 2015; <b>Package</b> <b>insert</b> for Technescan MAG 3, 2015; <b>Package</b> <b>insert</b> for ROTOP-MAG- 3 Kit, n.d.-a; <b>Package</b> <b>insert</b> for ROTOP-MAG- 3 Kit, n.d.-b). The specificity and accuracy of our method have been confirmed and results of total RCP are in very good agreement with the Ph.Eur. reference method. The limit of detection meets the limit test criteria necessary to identify the total amount of impurities in a TLC QC method. Its precision and robustness have been successfully validated. Results of the intermediate fidelity show a good correlation with the Ph.Eur. reference values, both for the TLC-scanner and the dose calibrator measurements. This two-strip TLC method could therefore be established for routine quality control of 99 mTc-MAG 3 kits by introducing it into the SPC of the products (<b>Package</b> <b>insert</b> for Technescan MAG 3. Mallinckrodt Suisse SA, 2003; <b>Package</b> <b>insert</b> for ROTOP-MAG- 3 Kit. Heider AG, 2006; <b>Package</b> <b>insert</b> for Technescan MAG 3. Mallinckrodt Suisse SA, 2015).|$|R

We compared test accuracy for tuberculosis diagnostics reported in 19 <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> against estimates in publishedmeta-analyses and found that <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> generally report overoptimistic accuracy estimates. However, <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> of most tests approved by the U. S.

40|$|Background: It {{is widely}} {{recognized}} that accurate and reliable product information {{is essential for}} the safe and effective use of medications. Pharmaceutical companies are the primary source of most drug information, including <b>package</b> <b>inserts.</b> <b>Package</b> <b>inserts</b> are printed leaflets accompanying marketed drug products and contain information approved by the regulatory agencies. Studies on <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> in India, in 1996, had shown that crucial information was often missing and they lacked uniformity. Aim: To assess the presentation and completeness of clinically important information provided in the currently available <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> in India. Materials and Methods: <b>Package</b> <b>inserts</b> accompanying allopathic drug products marketed by pharmaceutical companies in India were collected. These <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> were analyzed for the content of clinically important information in various sections. Statistical Analysis: The results were expressed as absolute numbers and percentages. Results: Preliminary analyses revealed that most <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> did contain information under headings, such as, therapeutic indications, contraindications, undesirable effects, etc., listed in the Drugs and Cosmetics Rules 1945. The findings indicated considerable improvement in <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> since 1996. However, on critical evaluation it was revealed that clinically important information was not well presented and was often incomplete. Information with regard to pediatric and geriatric use was present in only 44 &#x 0025; and 13 &#x 0025; of the <b>package</b> <b>inserts,</b> respectively. Only five of the inserts had information on the most frequent adverse drug reactions associated with the drug. Also, information on interactions and overdosage was often missing. Conclusion: Although the <b>package</b> <b>inserts</b> appear to have improved over the past decade there is still a definite need to further refine the clinical information contained, to minimize the risks to patients. This could be brought about by self-regulation {{on the part of the}} industry as well as by updating the relevant guidelines in line with those of developed countries...|$|R
