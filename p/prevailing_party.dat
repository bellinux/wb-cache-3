First {{introduced in the}} federal Clean Air Act, attorney s fee provisions are now included in virtually all environmental legislation.

In recent years, advocates of tort reform have praised Alaska’s Civil Rule 82 as a model for tort reform to help rid the overburdened courts of low merit claims.

Although filings in the District of Alaska were lower than the national average, they were indistinguishable from the remainder of the sample. Other measures also failed to demonstrate any significant differences between civil cases in the District of Alaska and the other districts.

May not such motives as these, put them often upon actions directly against the law, such as no evasions can be found for, and which will lay them fully open to the vengeance of a prevailing interest, whenever they are out of power? It is answered in the affirmative. And here we cannot refuse the late m[inistr]y their due praises, who foreseeing a storm, provided for their own safety, by two admirable expedients, by which, with great prudence, they have escaped the punishments due to pernicious counsels and corrupt management.

6000|$|I now devoted {{myself to}} poetry {{and to the}} study of ethics and psychology; and so {{profound}} was my admiration at this time of Hartley's ESSAY ON MAN, that I gave his name to my first-born. In addition to the gentleman, my neighbour, whose garden joined on to my little orchard, and the cultivation of whose friendship had been my sole motive in choosing Stowey for my residence, I was so fortunate as to acquire, shortly after my settlement there, an invaluable blessing in the society and neighbourhood of one, to whom I could look up with equal reverence, whether I regarded him as a poet, a philosopher, or a man. His conversation extended to almost all subjects, except physics and politics; with the latter he never troubled himself. Yet neither my retirement nor my utter abstraction from all the disputes of the day could secure me in those jealous times from suspicion and obloquy, which did not stop at me, but extended to my excellent friend, whose perfect innocence was even adduced as a proof of his guilt.

60|$|The {{understanding}} {{reader will}} easily conceive that this alteration {{of the current}} in favour of those who disapproved of witch-prosecutions, must have received encouragement from some quarter of weight and influence; yet it may sound strangely enough that this spirit of lenity {{should have been the}} result of the peculiar principles of those sectarians of all denominations, classed in general as Independents, who, though they had originally courted the Presbyterians as the more numerous and <b>prevailing</b> <b>party,</b> had at length shaken themselves loose of that connexion, and finally combated with and overcome them. The Independents were distinguished by the wildest license in their religious tenets, mixed with much that was nonsensical and mystical. They disowned even the title of a regular clergy, and allowed the preaching of any one who could draw together a congregation that would support him, or who was willing, without recompense, to minister to the spiritual necessities of his hearers. Although such laxity of discipline afforded scope to the wildest enthusiasm, and room for all possible varieties of doctrine, it had, on the other hand, this inestimable recommendation, that it contributed to a degree of general toleration which was at that time unknown to any other Christian establishment. The very genius of a religion which admitted of the subdivision of sects ad infinitum, excluded a legal prosecution of any one of these for heresy or apostasy. If there had even existed a sect of Manichæans, who made it their practice to adore the Evil Principle, it may be doubted whether the other sectaries would have accounted them absolute outcasts from the pale of the church; and, fortunately, the same sentiment induced them to regard with horror the prosecutions against witchcraft. Thus the Independents, when, under Cromwell, they attained a supremacy over the Presbyterians, who to a certain point had been their allies, were disposed to counteract the violence of such proceedings under pretence of witchcraft, as had been driven forward by the wretched Hopkins, in Essex, Norfolk, and Suffolk, for three or four years previous to 1647.|$|E

40|$|First {{published}} online: July 14, 2015 This {{article examines}} remedies awarded by international {{courts and tribunals}} {{with the aim of}} inducing substantive compliance rather than providing reparation for injury. Authors and courts have traditionally assumed that compliance is a matter for states and political bodies rather than adjudicators. Within the field of international trade law, however, a set of ‘prospective’ remedies has emerged, designed to create incentives for future compliance rather than to determine reparation for past injury. Prospective remedies, including control over compliance and authorizations for retaliation, have sometimes been considered to be unique to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade/World Trade Organization (WTO) system, and responsible for its ‘teeth’. On closer examination, however, there is little that is unique about the jurisdiction exercised by WTO adjudicators at the implementation stage. International courts may make, and have sometimes made, determinations with a prospective character, ensuring continued judicial oversight over disputes and providing <b>prevailing</b> <b>parties</b> with the option of adjudication as a means to press for compliance...|$|R
40|$|The {{expanding}} {{volume of}} lawsuits and the ballooning of legal expenditures {{in recent years}} has attracted the interest, concern, and even anger of the American public and politicians.

One reform proposal is the English rule, under which the losing party must pay the <b>prevailing</b> <b>party's</b> attorney fees in addition to her own expenses. To evaluate the different effects of these two rules on litigant behavior and legal outcomes, we conduct a theoretical and experimental analysis of environments which can be interpreted as legal disputes in which the probability of winning a lawsuit is partially determined by the legal expenditures of the litigants and partially determined by the inherent merits of the case.
