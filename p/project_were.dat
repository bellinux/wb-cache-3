5|$|During World War II the U.S. {{government}} {{established the}} Manhattan Project, which was tasked with developing an atomic bomb. The three primary research and production {{sites of the}} <b>project</b> <b>were</b> the plutonium production facility at {{what is now the}} Hanford Site, the uranium enrichment facilities at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and the weapons research and design laboratory, now known as Los Alamos National Laboratory.|$|E
5|$|Electromagnetic {{separation}} for {{uranium enrichment}} was {{abandoned in the}} post-war period {{in favor of the}} more complicated, but more efficient, gaseous diffusion method. Although most of the calutrons of the Manhattan <b>Project</b> <b>were</b> dismantled {{at the end of the}} war, some remained in use to produce isotopically enriched samples of naturally occurring elements for military, scientific and medical purposes.|$|E
50|$|The <b>project</b> <b>is</b> {{currently}} dormant. In September 2010, the <b>project</b> <b>was</b> {{maintained by}} one developer, Robert Gabriel. Previously, the <b>project</b> <b>was</b> maintained by A.J. Venter.|$|R

5|$|Main Roads' 2006 {{plan for}} {{environmental}} {{management of the}} project included numerous aspects, described as best management practices, which for the northern segment of the <b>project</b> <b>were</b> beyond the environmental approval requirements. Specific plans were developed regarding fauna, vegetation, dieback and weeds, and revegetation and rehabilitation. Other areas with specific plans included topsoil management, drainage, construction (covering dust, noise, and vibrations), foreshores, and both Aboriginal and European heritage.|$|E

5|$|After {{the lodge}} was completed, {{it was decided}} to build a {{restaurant}} and breezeway onto the lodge building. Logs for most of the <b>project</b> <b>were</b> shipped via railroad {{from as far away as}} Oregon and Washington state, unloaded in Stratford, Illinois and dragged to the construction site by teams of horses. The CCC project also completed sixteen one-room log cabins and three four-bedroom cabins. The work crews also built picnic shelters, trail shelters, and foot bridges. Only the logs for the cabins came from another source. They were purchased from a salvage company that had purchased utility poles from a defunct utility company at the price of 30 cents a piece.|$|E
5|$|After the war, {{plans to}} {{complete}} the Northern Heights <b>project</b> <b>were</b> reviewed but no work was carried out. Maintenance works and reconstruction of war damage on the existing network had the greatest call on London Underground funds. Funds for new works were severely limited and priority {{was given to the}} completion of the western and eastern extensions of the Central line to West Ruislip, Epping and Hainault. Despite being shown as under construction on underground maps as late as 1950, work never restarted on the unimplemented parts of the Northern Heights project.|$|E

In early 1946, {{the conversion of the}} LNER line from Mill Hill East to Edgware was scheduled by the LPTB for completion between January 1947 and June 1948. No work was carried out as maintenance works and reconstruction of war damage on the existing network had the greatest call on London Underground funds.

5|$|As {{a result}} of the incident, safety {{regulations}} for the <b>project</b> <b>were</b> scrutinized and revised. A special committee was established to review any similar experiments and recommend appropriate safety procedures. This change of procedures included needing a minimum of two people involved in such an experiment, using at least two instruments monitoring neutron intensities with audible alerts, and preparing a plan for operating methods and any contingencies that might occur during similar experiments. Additionally, discussions and designs for remote-controlled test devices were initiated, eventually leading {{to the creation of the}} Godiva device.|$|E
5|$|By 1980, the USACE {{was working}} to obtain funding, {{which was the}} major {{obstacle}} for completion; public concerns about the <b>project</b> <b>were</b> {{that it was not}} needed and would be too costly. The USACE announced in 1981 that an environmental impact report was necessary before the project could begin, following the Endangered Species Act of 1973; the least tern and light-footed clapper rail were considered endangered, and construction would have affected their habitat. The next year, the environmental impact report process began, funded by the USACE.|$|E
50|$|The Highway 2000 <b>project</b> <b>was</b> {{conceptualized}} by Government of Jamaica (by former Prime Minister P.J. Patterson) in September 1999.

5|$|G. Homer Durham, {{a member}} of the First Quorum of the Seventy, {{replaced}} Joseph Anderson as director of the Historical Department in 1977 and began restraining the History Division's activity. Durham required that all manuscripts go through him for approval before publication. He attempted to combine the Mormon History Trust Fund with the general department budget, but was prevented by Arrington. Durham also refrained from hiring new staff members to replace staff who had left. The multi-volume church history project was dropped, allowing the outside authors to seek publishers other than Deseret Book who would give them royalties and not be tempted to sanitize church history. Not all twelve authors completed their projects, but many books that started from the History Division <b>project</b> <b>were</b> later published through other publishers.|$|E
5|$|In 2006 Bayern {{purchased}} {{land near}} the Allianz Arena {{with the purpose}} of building a new youth academy. In 2015 the project, estimated to cost €70 million, was started, after overcoming internal resistance. The main reasons for the <b>project</b> <b>were</b> that the existing facilities were too small and that the club, while very successful at senior level, lacked competitiveness with other German and European clubs at youth level. The new facility is scheduled to open in the 2017–18 season.|$|E
5|$|In 2012, the {{government}} of New York City installed Wi-Fi routers at 10 payphones in the city (seven in Manhattan, two in Brooklyn, and one in Queens) {{as part of a}} pilot project. The Wi-Fi was free of charge and available for use at all times. The Wi-Fi signal was detectable from a radius of a few hundred feet (about 100m). Two of New York City's largest advertising companies—Van Wagner and Titan, who collectively owned more than 9,000 of New York City's 12,000 payphones at the time—paid $2,000 per router, with no monetary input from either the city or taxpayers. While the payphones participating in the Wi-Fi pilot <b>project</b> <b>were</b> poorly marked, the Wi-Fi offered at these payphones was significantly faster than some of the other free public Wi-Fi networks offered elsewhere.|$|E

5|$|In June 1942, the United States Army Corps of Engineers {{took over}} the Manhattan Project from OSRD, and Groves became the project's director. He {{tightened}} security, which dried up {{the flow of information}} to Britain. American officials were particularly concerned that Akers and other people from ICI involved in the Tube Alloys <b>project</b> <b>were</b> trying to exploit American nuclear scientific knowledge to create a profitable post-war industry. In October 1942, Bush and Conant convinced Roosevelt that the United States should independently develop the atomic bomb project, despite an agreement of unrestricted scientific interchange between the US and Britain.|$|E
5|$|Introduction {{of these}} quagga-like zebras {{could be part}} of a {{comprehensive}} restoration program including such ongoing efforts as eradication of non-native trees. Quaggas, wildebeest, and ostriches, which occurred together during historical times in a mutually beneficial association, could be kept together in areas where the indigenous vegetation has to be maintained by grazing. In early 2006, the third and fourth generation animals produced by the <b>project</b> <b>were</b> considered looking much like the depictions and preserved specimens of the quagga. This type of selective breeding is called breeding back. The practice is controversial, since the resulting zebras will resemble the quaggas only in external appearance, but will be genetically different. The technology to use recovered DNA for cloning does not yet exist.|$|E
5|$|On 11 December 1971, {{the bridge}} opened for traffic, {{and on the}} same day, the Alvøy–Brattholmen Ferry was terminated. In February 1972, there were twice as many cars as there {{had been on the}} ferry in February 1971. The {{official}} opening by King Olav V took place on 25 May 1972. The bridge cost NOK39.8 million to construct. This included NOK650,000 for the county road between Knarrevik and Brattholmen, which had been paid for by the state. The cost the company had to pay was NOK23.45 million. The final estimates for the <b>project</b> <b>were</b> for NOK34 million, and the whole cost above this was covered by the state. When it opened, the bridge was the longest in Norway.|$|E
