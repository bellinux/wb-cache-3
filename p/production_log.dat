However, the RTA equations may have some uncertainties as well. The dis{{advantage of}} RTA method is that the early-time data specially the linear flow time period may be affected by well clean-up period, when oil and/or gas are produced with water and fracturing fluids. This causes the early-time linear flow data points on RTA plot to be scattered, and therefore m LF cannot be identified very accurately.

On RTA plots, the data points may also be scattered because of the changes in well conditions during production (well head, choke size, liquid loading in wellbore, etc.). These affect RTA plots and calculation of slope of the lines. Also if the effective number of producing fractures (n) is not known, it makes uncertainties to be more.

30|$|Fuzzy c-means (FCM) is a data {{clustering}} technique wherein each {{data point}} {{belongs to a}} cluster to some degree that is specified by a membership grade. Bezdek (1981) originally introduced the technique as an improvement on earlier clustering methods. The method shows how to group data points that populate some multidimensional space into a specific number of different clusters. Fuzzy c-means is a well-known fuzzy clustering technique that generalizes the classical c-means algorithm {{and can be used}} where it is unclear how many clusters there should be for a given set of data (Chiu 1994). Fang and Chen (1997) applied fuzzy rules to predict porosity and permeability from five compositional and textural characteristics of sandstone in the Yacheng Field (South China Sea). The five input attributes were the relative amounts of rigid grains, ductile grains and detrital matrix, grain size and the Trask sorting coefficient. All the porosity and permeability data were first divided into a certain number of clusters by fuzzy c-means. The corresponding sandstone characteristics for each cluster were used to general the fuzzy linguistic rules. Each fuzzy cluster produced one fuzzy if–then rule with five input statements. The formulated rules were then used to make linguistic prediction by combining individual conclusion from each rule. Nikravesh et al. (2000) applied k-clustering, neural networks and fuzzy c-means techniques to characterize a field that produces from Ellenburger Dolomite. They used the techniques to perform clustering of 3 D seismic attributes and to establish relationships between the clusters and the <b>production</b> <b>log.</b> The <b>production</b> <b>log</b> was established away from the wellbore. They were able to identify the optimum locations for new wells based on the connectivity, size and shape of the clusters related to the pay zone. IIkachi et al. (2006) used data from three wells of an offshore gas field in Iran to construct fuzzy logic models of the reservoir. They applied fuzzy c-means clustering technique for rock type classification using porosity and permeability data. Permeability was modeled and predicted using Takagi–Sugeno fuzzy inference system. Their results showed that fuzzy logic approach was successful in predicting permeability of rocks in the gas reservoir. Fuzzy c-means is thus a vital technique with the capability of identifying structures in data from the large volume of historical oil and gas data currently residing in E&P companies’ data bases. Pattern recognition and classification will help to achieve a concise representation of a petroleum reservoir’s behaviour which will lead to efficient and cost-effective hydrocarbon recovery.|$|E

ABSTRACT: The demand for oil {{has been on the}} high in the recent past and will continue as search for sustainable alternative energy sources intensifies. The exploration and exploitation of oil from subsurface reservoirs have posed several environmental challenges which include flaring and improper water disposal to name a few, caused by excessive production of gas and water. Hence it is important to establish a reservoir performance monitoring scheme that will ensure that appropriate fluids are produced from the reservoir within the economic producing life of each well draining a given reservoir by monitoring the fluid contact levels. Furthermore, appropriate reservoir monitoring will help to improve productivity and recovery of old wells, calibrate predictive reservoir models and identify opportunities for optimum reservoir development. A key tool used in reservoir performance monitoring is the post <b>production</b> <b>log,</b> particularly the Pulsed Neutron Capture (PNC) and Pulsed Neutron Spectroscopy (PNS) logs which make use of high energy neutrons to determine the fluid contacts in the reservoir. This campaign however is very expensive; hence an alternative and less expensive method of determining and predicting the present and future fluid contacts will be discussed. This involves using calibrated material balance models to predict the fluid contacts based on the pore volume (voidage) replacement by the displacing fluid. This will help in generating fluid contacts on a more frequent time interval...|$|E

40|$|Interpretation of <b>production</b> <b>logging</b> in {{multi-phase}} flow wells is challenging, especially for highly deviated wells or horizontal wells. Flow regime-dependent flow conditions strongly affect the measurements of <b>production</b> <b>logging</b> tools. Segregation and possible back flow of denser phases result in misinterpretation of the inflow distribution. To assess the downhole flow conditions more accurately, logging tools {{have been developed}} to overcome the flow regime related issues. Multiple-sensor array tools measure the fluid properties at multiple locations around the cross-sectional area of the wellbore, providing a distributed measurement array that helps to relate the measurements to flow regime and translate the measurement to inflow distribution. This thesis present a methodology for using array data from <b>production</b> <b>logging</b> tools to interpret downhole flow conditions. The study uses an example logging tool that consists of 12 resistivity, 12 capacitance probes, and six spinners around the wellbore circumference. The method allows interpretation of phase volumetric flow rates in sub-divided cross-sectional areas based on sensor locations. The sub-divided area method divides the wellbore cross-sectional area into several layers depending on the number and arrangement of the sensors with each layer containing at least one sensor. Holdup and velocity outputs from sensors in each wellbore area segment are combined to calculate the volumetric flow rates of each phase in each segment. These results yield a profile of flow of each phase from the high side to the low side of the wellbore, and the overall flow rates of each phase at every location along the well where the interpretation method is applied. The results from different methods of interpreting <b>production</b> <b>logging</b> are compared in the thesis. Three Eagle Ford horizontal well examples are presented in the thesis; one has single sensor PLT measures, and the other two cases used a multiple sensor tool package.

40|$|At a {{political}} club, the members debate whose bust will replace that of Theodore Roosevelt. Unable to agree, each {{goes to a}} sculptor's studio and bribes him to sculpt a bust of the individual favorite. Instead, the sculptor spends their fees on a dinner with his model during which he becomes so inebriated that he is taken to jail. There he has a nightmare, wherein three busts are created and animated from clay (through stop-motion photography) in the likenesses of Democrat William Jennings Bryan and Republicans Charles W. Fairbanks and William Howard Taft. The drunken sculptor arises from his cot to see the animated faces of the three politicians. The busts disappear and he falls on his cot, writhing in distress. While he is prone, another figure begins to appear: first the clay forms itself into a G. O. P. donkey, then a teddy bear, and finally, into the animated face of Teddy Roosevelt himself. The sculptor rises again, and is startled to see yet another apparition. It disappears and the sculptor collapses on his cot and is still.

50|$|At the {{beginning}} of the 20th century Pennsylvania's economy was centered around steel <b>production,</b> <b>logging,</b> coal mining, textile production and other forms of industrial manufacturing. A surge in immigration to the U.S. during the late 19th and early 20th centuries provided a steady flow of cheap labor for these industries which often employed children and people who could not speak English.|$|R

As one example, most oil wells require periodic "workovers" to maintain production at satisfactory levels, and acquiring up-to-date information on the reservoir using a <b>production</b> <b>logging</b> tool (PLT) generally improves the efficiency of such workovers. 2005 Morgan Stanley. ...|$|R
