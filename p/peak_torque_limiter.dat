In this research, the {{verification}} on the <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> {{is completed}} {{by using the}} mechanism of a <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> integrated with the infrared optointerrupter feedback detection. Through a shuttle and an infrared optointerrupter, {{it is meant to}} determine whether the rotation mechanism is affected by the mechanism of a <b>torque</b> <b>limiter.</b> With this, it is available to determine if any jamming happens. Through the testing verification of physical mechanisms, the feasibility for the <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> proposed by this research is conducted. It can avoid current shorting when dead jamming happens. Also, the detection circuits relevant to the detection of motor current feedback can be saved to reduce systematical circuit maintenance and manufacture <b>torque</b> <b>limiters</b> with long life expectancy, higher stability and low cost...|$|R

40|$|Background: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to analyse the effectiveness of the surgical <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> during operative use. The study also investigates the potential differences in torque between hand and drill-based screw insertion into locking plates using a standardised <b>torque</b> <b>limiter.</b> Methods: <b>Torque</b> for both hand and power screw insertion was measured through a load cell, registering 6. 66 points per second. This was performed in a controlled environment using synthetic bone, a locking plate and locking screws to simulate plate fixation. Screws were inserted by hand and by drill with torque values measured. Results: The surgical <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> (1. 5 Nm) was effective as the highest recorded reading in the study was 1. 409 Nm. Comparatively, there is a statistically significant difference between screw insertion methods. Torque produced for manually driven screw insertion into locking plates was 1. 289 Nm (95 % CI 1. 269 – 1. 308) with drill-powered screw insertion at 0. 740 Nm (95 % CI 0. 723 – 0. 757). Conclusions: The surgical <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> proved to be effective as per product specifications. Screws inserted under power produce significantly less torque when compared to manual insertion by hand. This is likely related to the mechanism of the <b>torque</b> <b>limiter</b> when being used at higher speeds for which it was designed. We conclude that screws may be inserted using power to the plate with the addition of a <b>torque</b> <b>limiter.</b> It is recommended that all screws inserted by drill be hand tightened to achieve adequate torque values.

40|$|Purpose: To {{investigate}} {{whether there is}} {{a significant difference between the}} <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> and angle of <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> of the hamstrings in a group of recreational female football players. Methods: A convenience sample of 17 females aged 18 - 22 years from a university ladies football team. <b>Peak</b> <b>torque</b> and angle of <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> of both hamstrings were measured using a Biodex system 2 isokinetic dynamometer in concentric and eccentric mode at an angular velocity of 60 °/sec. The related t-test was used to test for significant differences between limbs. Results: Muscle strength differences ranging between 0. 9 % - 38. 3 % (Concentric: 9. 7 ± 7. 7; Eccentric: 15. 4 ± 9. 3) were noted. However, no significant differences were found between the dominant and non dominant limb (<b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> concentric p= 0. 068, eccentric p= 0. 063; angle of <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> concentric p= 0. 449, eccentric p= 0. 246).

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{isokinetic}} dynamometer {{has been}} considered the gold-standard measurement of muscle performance. However, the reliability for the passive mode in children has not been reported to date. OBJECTIVES: The purpose was to evaluate {{the reliability of the}} isokinetic dynamometer in passive mode in children. METHOD: Twenty-one healthy children (ten girls, eleven boys), aged 5 to 12 years (age: 8. 5 &# 177; 2. 2 years), were evaluated using an isokinetic dynamometer. Each participant was tested twice with a one-week interval and performed five consecutive cycles of knee extension and flexion. The test was performed at 60 &# 186;/s in the concentric passive mode and the children performed maximal contractions. The measured variables were <b>peak</b> <b>torque,</b> average <b>peak</b> <b>torque,</b> total work, and average power, time to <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> and angle of <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> for dominant and non-dominant lower limbs. Reliabilities were determined using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 3, 1), standard error of measurement (SEM and SEM%), and coefficient of variation (CV). RESULTS: We found good reliability in both lower limbs for <b>peak</b> <b>torque,</b> average <b>peak</b> <b>torque,</b> total work and average power of knee flexors and extensors, with ICC 3, 1 values greater than 0. 80; SEM ranging from 6. 7 to 79. 2; SEM% ranging from 10. 4 % to 16. 8 %; CV lower than 15 %. Bland-Altman analysis showed that the bias was low than 10 % and limits of agreement (LOAs) ranging from 33. 9 % to 59. 2 %, and - 28. 8 % and - 52. 8 %, showing that measures tended to disagree. However, time to <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> (ICC 3, 1 0. 34; SEM%> 37. 4 %; CV> 41. 7 %; bias > 24. 0 %; LOA> 101. 0 %) and angle of <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> (ICC 3, 1 9. 3; SEM%> 27. 6 %; CV> 15. 3 %; bias> 11. 0 %; LOA> 61. 0 %) were not reliable.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{control of}} force and its between-trial {{variability}} are often taken as critical determinants of motor performance. Subjects performed isometric trunk flexion and extension forces without and with experiment pain to examine if pain yields changes in the control of trunk forces. The objective {{of this study is}} to determine if experimental low back pain modifies trunk isometric force production. Methods Ten control subjects participated in this study. They were required to exert 50 and 75 % of their isometric maximal trunk flexion and extension torque. In a learning phase preceding the non painful and painful trials, visual and verbal feedbacks were provided. Then, subjects were asked to perform 10 trials without any feedback. Time to <b>peak</b> <b>torque,</b> time to <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> variability, <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> variability as well as constant and absolute error in <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> were calculated. Time to peak and peak dF/dt were computed to determine if the first peak of dF/dt could predict the <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> achieved. Results Absolute and constant errors were higher in the presence of a painful electrical stimulation. Furthermore, <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> variability for the higher level of force was increased with in the presence of experimental pain. The linear regressions between peak dF/dt, time to peak dF/dt and <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> were similar for both conditions. Experimental low back pain yielded increased absolute and constant errors as well as a greater <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> variability for the higher levels of force. The control strategy, however, remained the same between the non painful and painful condition. Cutaneous pain affects some isometric force production parameters but modifications of motor control strategies are not implemented spontaneously. Conclusions It is hypothesized that adaptation of motor strategies to low back pain is implemented gradually over time. This would enable LBP patients to perform their daily tasks with presumably less pain and more accuracy. </p...|$|R

Reliability of <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> measurements was determined during test and retest sessions. Significant correlations were consistently observed between muscle CSA and <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> for all contraction types (r = 0. 74 À 0. 85; P < 0. 001) and between EMG activity and submaximal isometric torque (r P 0. 99; P < 0. 05), for both extensor and flexor muscles.

40|$|Measures of {{knee joint}} function, {{although}} useful in predicting injury, {{can be misleading}} because hip position in traditional seated isokinetic tests is dissimilar to when injuries occur. This study aimed to determine the differences between seated and supine <b>peak</b> <b>torques</b> and strength ratios and examine the interaction of position with joint velocity. This was a cross-sectional, repeated measures study. Isokinetic knee extensor and flexor concentric and eccentric <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> was measured seated and supine (10 degrees hip flexion) at 1. 04 and 3. 14 rad. s(- 1) in 11 Rugby players. Repeated measures analysis of variance and paired t-tests were used to analyze <b>peak</b> <b>torques</b> and strength ratios. Bonferroni post hoc, limits of agreement, and Pearson's correlation were applied. Seated <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> was typically greater than that for supine for muscle actions and velocities. The values ranged from 109 +/- 18 N. m (mean +/- sigma) for supine hamstring concentric <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> at 1. 04 rad. s(- 1) to 330 +/- 71 for seated quadriceps eccentric <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> at 1. 04 rad. s(- 1). There was a significant position x muscle action interaction; eccentric <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> was reduced more than concentric in the supine position. Knee joint strength ratios ranged from 0. 47 +/- 0. 06 to 0. 86 +/- 0. 23, with {{a significant difference in}} means between supine and seated positions for functional ratio at 3. 14 rad. s(- 1) observed; for seated it was 0. 86 +/- 0. 23; and for supine, it was 0. 68 +/- 0. 15 (p < 0. 05). Limits of agreement for traditional and functional ratios ranged from 1. 09 x/divided by 1. 37 to 1. 13 x/divided by 1. 51. We conclude that hip angle affects isokinetic <b>peak</b> <b>torques</b> and knee joint strength ratios. Therefore, the hip angle should be nearer 10 degrees when measuring knee joint function because this is more ecologically valid. Using similar protocols, sports practitioners can screen for injury and affect training to minimize injury...|$|R
40|$|To {{determine}} the effects of shin pad placement on <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> and reported comfort with knee flexion and extension a cross-over design was utilized. Two groups of 30 individuals tested either quadriceps or hamstring muscle groups on the Cybex 340. Unidirectional concentric maximal contractions with the shin pad placed anteriorly and posteriorly on the lower leg were performed at 60 and 120 degrees/second with the subjects seated. <b>Peak</b> <b>torque</b> was derived as art average of the test repetitions computed by the Cybex 340. Comfort was assessed via a rank order question. Conclusions: (a) hamstring posterior shin pad placement results (as opposed to anterior placement) showed significant difference (p =. 05) with the t-test in <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> at 60 degrees/second; (b) assessment of reported comfort (anterior versus posterior pad placement) was insignificant; (c) no significant correlation was found between <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> and professed degree of comfort...|$|R
40|$|Twenty elderly adults (aged 65 to 86) {{participated in}} a study to {{determine}} <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> values for eccentric isokinetic contractions of the right hamstrings and quadriceps and {{to examine the relationship}} between <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> and a timed descending stair test Eccentric testIng at 30 degrees per second was performed on the BIOOEX isokinetic dynamometer. The mean <b>peak</b> isokinetic eccentric <b>torque</b> produced by the hamstrings was found to be 42. 25 ft-Ibs (SD= 18. 65). The mean <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> produced by the quadriceps was 80. 14 ft-Ibs (SD= 34. 17). A negative correlation between the timed stair test and the <b>peak</b> eccentric isokinetic <b>torque</b> of the hamstrings (r= -. 178) and quadriceps (r= -. 344) was found. As the <b>peak</b> eccentric isokinetic <b>torque</b> values for the hamstrings and quadriceps increased, the times for the timed stair test decreased; however, these results were not significant at p 3 ̆c 0. 05...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess knee flexor-extensor muscular {{strength}} in elderly women with no previous history of musculoskeletal disorders {{on the lower}} limbs using an isokinetic dynamometer, {{in order to obtain}} data that {{could be used as a}} comparative parameter in the evaluation of elderly women with knee disorders, thus facilitating a better rehabilitation of these patients. METHODS: Twenty-six volunteers aged 75 to 83 years were studied using a Cybex® 6000 isokinetic dynamometer. The chosen angular velocity was 60 º/s, and concentric exercise was used for either flexion or extension. The studied parameters were: <b>peak</b> <b>torque,</b> angle of <b>peak</b> <b>torque,</b> and flexor-extensor torque rate. RESULTS: There were no differences between dominant (D) and nondominant (ND) knee <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> values. This was true for both flexor (D = 42. 46 ± 9. 09 Nm / ND = 40. 65 ± 9. 38 Nm) and extensor (D = 76. 92 ± 13. 97 Nm / ND = 77. 65 ± 15. 21 Nm) movements. The descriptive statistical analysis of the values obtained for the flexor-extensor <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> rate and for the angle of occurrence of <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> was the same for the dominant and nondominant sides. CONCLUSIONS: The values of <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> for the contralateral side can be used as a reference during rehabilitation of elderly women with acute disease of the knee, and the angular velocity of 60 º/s is proper and safe for isokinetic assessment of elderly people...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT | Background: The {{isokinetic}} dynamometer {{has been}} considered the gold-standard measurement of muscle performance. However, the reliability for the passive mode in children has not been reported to date. Objectives: The purpose was to evaluate {{the reliability of the}} isokinetic dynamometer in passive mode in children. Method: Twenty-one healthy children (ten girls, eleven boys), aged 5 to 12 years (age: 8. 5 ± 2. 2 years), were evaluated using an isokinetic dynamometer. Each participant was tested twice with a one-week interval and performed five consecutive cycles of knee extension and flexion. The test was performed at 60 °/s in the concentric passive mode and the children performed maximal contractions. The measured variables were <b>peak</b> <b>torque,</b> average <b>peak</b> <b>torque,</b> total work, and average power, time to <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> and angle of <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> for dominant and non-dominant lower limbs. Reliabilities were determined using intraclass correlation coefficient (ICC 3, 1), standard error of measurement (SEM and SEM%), and coefficient of variation (CV). Results: We found good reliability in both lower limbs for <b>peak</b> <b>torque,</b> average <b>peak</b> <b>torque,</b> total work and average power of knee flexors and extensors, with ICC 3, 1 values greater than 0. 80; SEM ranging from 6. 7 to 79. 2; SEM % ranging from 10. 4 % to 16. 8 %; CV lower than 15 %. Bland-Altman analysis showed that the bias was low than 10 % and limits of agreement (LOAs) ranging from 33. 9 % to 59. 2 %, and- 28. 8 % and- 52. 8 %, showing that measures tended to disagree. However, time to <b>peak</b> <b>torque</b> (ICC 3, 1 0. 34; SEM%> 37. 4 %; CV> 41. 7 %; bias> 24. 0 %...|$|R
