40|$|In {{patients}} with unresectable peripancreatic carcinoma, pain is generally treated with pain medication {{or with a}} celiac plexus blockade. Radiotherapy has also been reported to reduce pain. The efficacy of these treatment modalities is still under discussion. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the effects of the various types of pain management on patients who underwent <b>palliative</b> bypass <b>surgery</b> for unresectable peripancreatic carcinoma. During the period January 1995 to December 1998 a series of 98 patients underwent <b>palliative</b> bypass <b>surgery,</b> mostly for unresectable disease found during exploration. Patients were divided into three groups: <b>palliative</b> bypass <b>surgery</b> (BP), <b>palliative</b> bypass <b>surgery</b> with an intraoperative celiac plexus blockade (CPB), and <b>palliative</b> bypass <b>surgery</b> with or without celiac plexus blockade followed by high-dose conformal radiotherapy (RT). Radiotherapy was performed only in selected {{patients with}} locally advanced disease and without metastases, implying a better prognosis of the last group. The pain medication consumption, pain medication-free survival, hospital-free survival, and overall survival were analyzed. The preoperative consumption of pain medication was significantly higher in the CPB group than in the BP or RT group. The postoperative consumption of pain medication in the CPB, BP, and RT groups increased during Follow-up from 15 %, 17 %, and 13 % before surgery to 52 %, 57 %, and 46 %, respectively, at three-fourths of the survival time (NS). This increase in consumption of pain medication was not different in the three groups. In the RT group the median pain medication-free survival was significantly longer than in the BP or CPB group (9. 3 vs. 3. 1 and 3. 3 months; p = 0. 02). The median hospital-free survival and median overall survival were significantly longer in the RT group than in the CPB group (10. 3 vs. 6. 8 months, p = 0. 01; and 7. 1 vs. 10. 8 months, p = 0. 01). Celiac plexus blockade as pain management did not result in an increase of the pain medication-free survival or overall survival. Therefore a positive effect of a celiac plexus blockade on pain could not be confirmed in the present study. Radiotherapy resulted in increased pain-medication survival, hospital-free survival, and overall survival compared to celiac plexus blockade. These effects are probably partly related to patient selectio...|$|R

40|$|AbstractMulti-stage palliation is {{the current}} {{management}} strategy {{for the treatment of}} children with various single ventricle (SV) cardiac malformations. The success of this strategy depends on the presence of favorable anatomic and hemodynamic criteria. Several SV anomalies have the potential of developing systemic ventricular outflow tract obstruction (SVOTO) that might be evident early on or progress later after <b>palliative</b> <b>surgeries.</b> SVOTO could result in ventricular hypertrophy, impaired diastolic function and subendocardial ischemia with subsequent deleterious effects on the SV and disturbance of some of those criteria for a successful multi-stage palliation strategy. Careful identification of SV patients at risk of developing SVOTO and proper planning of the optimal palliation sequence beginning at the 1 st stage procedure are vital factors that would affect long-term outcomes in those patients. In the current review, we describe the morphology of SV patients with potential SVOTO risk, surgical procedures that address potential or present SVOTO, and optimal timing of those procedures within the multi-stage palliation chain.

40|$|Congenital {{heart disease}} is {{identified}} as the most common birth defect with single ventricle physiology carrying the highest mortality. Staged surgical palliation is required for treatment, with mortality historically as high as 22 % in the four- to six-month period from the first- to second-stage surgical palliation, known as the interstage. A standardized postoperative feeding approach was implemented through an evidence-based protocol, parent engagement, and interprofessional team rounds. Five infants with single ventricle physiology preprotocol were compared with five infants who received the standardized feeding approach. Mann-Whitney U tests were conducted to evaluate the hypotheses that infants in the intervention condition would consume more calories and have a positive change in weight-to-age z-score (WAZ) and shorter length of stay (LOS) following {{the first and second}} surgeries compared to infants in the control condition. After the protocol, the change in WAZ during the interstage increased by virtually one standard deviation from 0. 05 to 0. 91. Median LOS dropped 32 % after the first surgery and 43 % after the second surgery. Since first- and second-stage <b>palliative</b> <b>surgeries</b> occur within the same year of life, this represents savings of $ 500, 000 to $ 800, 000 per year in a 10 -infant model.

Presentation of case: A 43 year old man was diagnosed with pancreatic tail cancer. After distal pancreatectomy, he underwent six cycle of adjuvant chemotherapy. 10 months later, he had suffered from small bowel obstruction by seeding metastases. We performed segmental small bowel resection. This patient had good recovery and continued to receive palliative chemotherapy. A 78 year old man was diagnosed with unresectable, huge pancreatic cancer. He had recurrent obstructive symptoms and periumbilical pain.

40|$|Background: Locally {{advanced}} {{pancreatic cancer}} has a poor prognosis, due to late clinical manifestation and diagnosis. Even in a palliative setting, surgical interventions due to cancer progression and for reduction of symptoms, may be necessary. Nowadays cytoreductive resections for locally advanced pancreatic cancer are feasible without complications. Methods: In a retrospective study we analyzed if patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer, whom {{were treated with}} primary <b>palliative</b> cytoreductive <b>surgery</b> and adjuvant gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, have a longer overall survival and {{better quality of life}} compared to patients, whom were treated with primary gemcitabine-based chemotherapy. From a prospectively conducted database from the Department of General-, Visceral and Transplantation Surgery, Charité – Universitätsmedizin Berlin, 45 patients from 01. 01. 2000 until 31. 12. 2008 were identified, who were treated with primary <b>palliative</b> cytoreductive <b>surgery</b> followed by adjuvant gemcitabine-based chemotherapy (OP+Gem group). Through a matched-pair-analysis, patients from the OP+Gem group were compared to a group of 45 patients from the Medical Department, Division of Hematology, Oncology and Tumor Immunology, whom were treated with primary palliative gemcitabine-based chemotherapy (Gem group). Results: In the OP+Gem group median overall survival was 10, 4 months (95 %-KI: 7, 1 – 12, 9). In the Gem group median overall survival was 7, 2 months (95 %-KI: 6, 3 – 9, 6). The difference in the overall survival between both groups was significant (p= 0, 009). In the subgroup analysis, patients with R 0 M 1 stage had a median overall survival of 14, 4 months. Patients with R 2 M 0 stage had a median overall survival of 11 months. Patients with R 1 M 1 or R 2 M 1 stage had a nominal worse median overall survival, comparable to patients in the Gem group. The difference in survival between subgroups was also significant (p = 0, 01). An endoscopic intervention due to symptoms caused by the tumor was necessary in two patients (15 %) of the OP+Gem group, and in 14 patients (41 %) of the Gem group. Conclusion: Our study shows that in patients with advanced pancreatic adenocarcinoma, a longer survival was achieved through primary <b>palliative</b> cytoreductive <b>surgery</b> followed by gemcitabine-based chemotherapy, compared to a 9 matched control group of patients with primary gemcitabine-based chemotherapy.
