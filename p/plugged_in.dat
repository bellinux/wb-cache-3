5|$|Ethnic Cleansing was {{developed}} {{by members of the}} National Alliance, an American white supremacist organization, and published by Resistance Records, its subsidiary record label that specializes in white power music. It {{was developed}} for Microsoft Windows personal computers using Eclipse Entertainment's open-source game engine Genesis3D along with the Reality Factory development kit. The source code was not substantially changed from the original. Instead, the developers simply <b>plugged</b> <b>in</b> images and sounds that they had created in freely available editing programs.|$|E
25|$|On November 15, 2013, a fire {{broke out}} in an Irvine, California garage where a Tesla Model S was <b>plugged</b> <b>in</b> and charging. The fire appears to have {{originated}} at the wall connection where the Tesla charging equipment was <b>plugged</b> <b>in.</b> Shortly afterwards, Tesla updated the Model S firmware to reduce charging current when power fluctuations were detected and replaced wall adapters with a new unit containing a thermal fuse.|$|E

Combining a 7000-series storage oscillocope with a spectrum analyzer <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> allowed a slow sweep with a display that did not fade away.|$|R
40|$|The {{need for}} a {{mechanism}} to control and filter subscriptions to control system variables by the client was described in a paper at the ICALEPCS 2009 conference [1]. The implementation follows a <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> design that allows the insertion of <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> instances into the event stream on the server side. The client can instantiate and configure these <b>plug</b> <b>ins</b> when opening a subscription, by adding modifiers to the channel name using JSON notation [2]. This paper describes the design and implementation of a modular server side <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> framework for Channel Access, and shows examples for <b>plug</b> <b>ins</b> {{as well as their}} use within an EPICS control syste...|$|R
50|$|In {{practical}} use, a V-6 engine {{would only}} need three coil packs instead of six. Each individual coil fires the spark <b>plugs</b> <b>in</b> two cylinders simultaneously, the spark <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> one cylinder on a compression stroke where the power comes from, and the spark <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> the other cylinder on an exhaust stroke.|$|R
25|$|For Orbital's debut TOTP {{performance}} {{they just}} stood around, occasionally leaning forward to {{press a button}} on their sequencers. One of their machines had its power plug deliberately draped across it, to show the equipment wasn't even <b>plugged</b> <b>in.</b>|$|E
25|$|The thick mucus seen in {{the lungs}} has a {{counterpart}} in thickened secretions from the pancreas, an organ responsible for providing digestive juices that help break down food. These secretions block the exocrine movement of the digestive enzymes into the duodenum and result in irreversible damage to the pancreas, often with painful inflammation (pancreatitis). The pancreatic ducts are totally <b>plugged</b> <b>in</b> more advanced cases, usually seen in older children or adolescents. This causes atrophy of the exocrine glands and progressive fibrosis.|$|E
25|$|The UCS {{explained}} that the Chevrolet Volt plug-in hybrid (PHEV) {{was not included in}} the evaluation even though the Volt could have been compared with the Chevrolet Cruze as the conventional similar. The reason for the exclusion is that PHEVs are affected by a variety of factors that affect their environmental performance, such as the type of fuel used (coal, wind, solar, etc.) for generating electricity to charge the vehicle, and also by the driving habits, including how often the vehicle is <b>plugged</b> <b>in</b> and the number of miles driven on electricity-only mode.|$|E
50|$|The 7Bnn <b>plug</b> <b>ins</b> were {{intended}} as time bases. There were several choices {{to match the}} mainframe's bandwidth. Two time base <b>plug</b> <b>ins</b> could communicate to obtain a delayed sweep feature (e.g., 7B80 and 7B85, $1,335 and $1,605 in 1983). Some time base <b>plug</b> <b>ins</b> included a delayed sweep in one module, such as the 7B53A or 7B92A ($1,430 and $3,175 in 1983).|$|R

50|$|Drivers can now <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> at two {{park-and-ride}} lots in King County, {{which includes}} Seattle. The county {{plans to add}} sockets at three garages under construction. There are about 30 reliable sites in the Seattle area to <b>plug</b> <b>in.</b> Most are free, others charge the same as parking a gas-powered car -- $7 an hour. In recent months, the cities of Edmonds and Lacey invited drivers to <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> their electric vehicles at free public stations.|$|R
25|$|When a {{compatible}} {{device is}} <b>plugged</b> <b>in,</b> the Windows AutoPlay dialog offers an additional option {{to use the}} flash drive {{to speed up the}} system; an additional ReadyBoost tab is added to the drive's properties dialog where the amount of space to be used can be configured. The minimum cache size is 250MB. In Vista or with FAT32 formatting of the drive, the maximum is 4GB. In Windows 7 with NTFS or exFAT formatting, the maximum cache size is 32GB per device. Windows Vista allows only one device to be used, while Windows 7 allows multiple caches, one per device, up to a total of 256GB.|$|E
25|$|Similar to a {{breakout}} device, some docking stations produce multiple connections from one port, only instead of extracting them from internal chipsets, they create them inside the dock using converters. They are functionally identical to a hub with various converters <b>plugged</b> <b>in.</b> Typically USB- or Thunderbolt-based, they incorporate {{a range of}} converters such as USB display adapters or a full external GPU, audio chipsets, NICs, storage enclosures, modems and memory card readers even PCI Express card slots connected through an internal USB hub or PCI Express bridge to give the host computer access to extra connections it did not previously possess. Simpler “docking stations” consist of {{nothing more than a}} hub inside a stand.|$|E
25|$|On-site auctions – Sometimes {{when the}} stock or assets of a company are simply too vast or too bulky for an auction house to {{transport}} to their own premises and store, they will hold an auction {{within the confines of}} the bankrupt company itself. Bidders could find themselves bidding for items which are still <b>plugged</b> <b>in,</b> and the great advantage of these auctions taking place on the premises is that they have the opportunity to view the goods as they were being used, and may be able to try them out. Bidders can also avoid the possibility of goods being damaged whilst they are being removed as they can do it or at least supervise the activity.|$|E
50|$|There {{were several}} digital or meter <b>plug</b> <b>ins</b> (7Dnn). For {{the first time}} in commercially {{available}} oscilloscopes, the 7000 series had a digital read-out system, so a <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> could display its settings or display the value of a measurement on the CRT. The 7D11 ($2,915 in 1983) was a digital delay, the 7D15 ($3,020) was a 225 MHz counter/timer, the 7D13 ($1,105) was a multimeter, and the 7D12/M2 ($2,815) was a sample-and-hold with an analog-to-digital converter. More exotic digital <b>plug</b> <b>ins</b> used the mainframe oscilloscope as a mere display unit. The 7D01 and 7D02 were logic analyzer <b>plug</b> <b>ins.</b> The triple-wide 7D20 programmable digitizer with GPIB ($7,750 in 1983) would turn an analog mainframe into a digital scope.|$|R

40|$|A {{new class}} of <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> {{classification}} techniques have recently been de-veloped in the statistics and machine learning literature. A <b>plug</b> <b>in</b> clas-sification technique (PaCT) is a method that takes a standard classifier (such as LDA or TREES) and plugs it into an algorithm to produce a new classifier. The standard classifier {{is known as the}} <b>Plug</b> <b>in</b> Classi-fier (PiC). These methods often produce large improvements over using a single classifier. In this paper we investigate one of these methods and give some motivation for its success. ...|$|R
25|$|The {{pre-production}} Prius Plug-in uses {{three different}} batteries, two to provide all-electric drive {{and a third}} battery engages when the first two are depleted, allowing the car to operate in hybrid mode, like a regular 50-mpg Prius. According to Toyota, when the vehicle starts, the plug-in operates in all-electric mode, drawing electrical power directly from the first battery pack. When its charge is depleted, it disconnects from the circuit and the second pack engages and supplies electrical energy to the motor. When the second pack is depleted again it disconnects from the circuit and the system defaults to conventional hybrid mode, using the main battery as the sole electrical power source. Pack one and pack two will not reengage {{in tandem with the}} main battery pack until the vehicle is <b>plugged</b> <b>in</b> and charged.|$|E
25|$|In the United States the Prius Plug-in Hybrid is {{available}} in two models, the standard Prius Plug-in and the Prius Plug-in Advanced, and offered in five exterior colors. The standard trim level includes all {{the features of the}} 2012 Prius Two Liftback grade, plus some features from the Prius Three and Prius Four grades. Standard features include heated front seats, remote air conditioning system (which can run either off the grid while the vehicle is <b>plugged</b> <b>in</b> or off the battery like the third-generation Prius), a charger timer, EV/ECO/POWER modes, three-door smart key with push-button start, new touch-screen display audio with navigation and an integrated backup camera, Toyota Entune, and LED daytime running lights. Additional features of the Prius Plug-in Advanced include head-up display, LED headlamps, softex interior seat trim, eight-way adjustable power driver seat, JBL premium audio and HDD navigation system and exclusive Entune Plug-in Hybrid Applications for smartphones. Additional safety features in the Advanced model include the Pre-Collision System with Dynamic Radar Cruise Control and Safety Connect system.|$|E
25|$|In 1990, GameTek {{created a}} Price Is Right {{computer}} {{game for the}} DOS and Commodore 64 platforms and other systems to fit in their line of other game show games. A handheld Tiger game was made in 1998 with four pricing games. A DVD game with 12 pricing games, live casino show host Todd Newton and video of prizes taken directly from the show was produced by Endless Games in 2005. A 2008 DVD edition, also from Endless Games, featured many changes based on season 36 and included seven new games: Half Off, More or Less, Swap Meet, Secret X, That's Too Much, Coming or Going and Hole in One. It also featured both host Drew Carey and announcer Rich Fields. CBS.com featured an online Price Is Right-based game in the late-1990s, which was <b>plugged</b> <b>in</b> the closing credits of each episode. The game consisted of choosing which of the four bidders in Contestant's Row was closest {{to the price of}} a prize without going over. Additionally, Mobliss provides a suite of pricing games for cellular phones.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to the game industry, the Unreal Engine has also seen adoption by many non-gaming projects. For instance, visual effects company Industrial Light & Magic employed the Unreal Tournament version of the engine to recreate Rouge City, a fictional place in the 2001 film A.I. Artificial Intelligence, {{in order to help}} Steven Spielberg plan out camera angles for scenes set in Rouge City. The popular children's TV show LazyTown used Unreal Engine 3 during filming to generate virtual sets for real-time integration with footage of actors and puppets performing in front of green screens. On the architectural side, HKS announced in 2007 that it had licensed UE3 to produce detailed interactive environments of its projects. Among them was the Cowboys Stadium, whose owners were able to explore its design before construction was completed in 2009. The Unreal Development Kit also was used by the Michigan Department of Transportation, who in 2010 designed a multiscreen driving simulator in a close partnership with Parsons Brinckerhoff to show how vehicles can be <b>plugged</b> <b>in</b> to the national transportation grid. That year also saw the premiere of Chadam, an Unreal Engine 3-powered animated internet series produced by HDFilms and distributed by Warner Bros. Television Group.|$|E
25|$|The first {{versions}} of Windows (1.0 through to 3.11) were actually just programs run from MS-DOS which then {{took over the}} screen and launched an application called Program Manager; later on, Windows 95, though still being based on MS-DOS, was its own operating system, using a 16-bit DOS-based kernel and a 32-bit user space. Windows 95 introduced many staple features that remain in current {{versions of}} Windows today, including the Start menu, the taskbar, and Windows Explorer (renamed File Explorer in Windows 8). In 1997, Microsoft released Internet Explorer 4 which included the (at the time) controversial Windows Desktop Update, which aimed to integrate Internet Explorer and the web into the user interface and also brought many new features into Windows, {{such as the ability}} to display JPEG images as the desktop wallpaper and single window navigation in Windows Explorer, all of which still exist in Windows today. In 1998, Microsoft released Windows 98, which also included the Windows Desktop Update and Internet Explorer 4 by default. The inclusion of Internet Explorer 4 and the Desktop Update led to an infamous anti-trust case. Windows 98 also included plug and play, which allowed devices to simply work when <b>plugged</b> <b>in</b> instead of requiring a system reboot, and USB support out of the box, which was previously only available in specially updated versions of Windows 95 which were only shipped to OEMs and not available to the general public. Windows ME, the last DOS-based version of Windows, was aimed at consumers and released in 2000. It introduced the Help and Support Center, System Restore, and updated user-friendly versions of the Disk Defragmenter and other system tools.|$|E
