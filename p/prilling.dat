50|$|Until the 1970s most urea plants {{produced}} their fertilizer in {{the form}} of prills. In the <b>prilling</b> process, droplets of urea ‘melt’ (obtained by concentrating the product solution from the urea plant to a very high level) are cast into an upward flow of air, solidifying as they fall. For air <b>prilling,</b> a concrete tower is required between 40 and 70 meters high, depending on the production capacity and climatic conditions. On account of their relatively low strength, prills are susceptible to breakage during handling and transportation, which increases the risk of caking (concretion) of the product during storage and gives rise to dust when the urea is spread on the land.Stamicarbon developed a new technology to improve the impact strength, known as ‘seeding’. This process involves blowing tiny urea particles (seeds) into the <b>prilling</b> tower. The seeds act as kernels for the crystallization of the urea melt droplets, and in so doing their strength is increased.|$|E
50|$|Since the 1970s the urea {{industry}} has been gradually changing over from <b>prilling</b> to granulation, which produces stronger particles of a more suitable size for fertilizer use. In the 1990s Stamicarbon introduced its own fluidized-bed granulation process, which rapidly gained acceptance in the world nitrogen fertilizer industry.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. A {{comprehensive}} study of the internal flow field for the <b>prilling</b> application in a perforated rotating bucket has been carried out. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) is used to investigate the flow field of urea melt inside the perforated rotating bucket. The bucket is mounted {{at the top of}} the <b>prilling</b> tower. In <b>prilling</b> process, urea melt is sprayed by the perforated rotating bucket to produce the urea droplets, which falls down due to gravity. These drops fall down through a cooling medium and solidify into prills.

40|$|Ammonium nitrate (AN) is {{commonly}} used as an explosive and as a fertilizer. In both roles it is provided as <b>prills</b> or pellets, approximately spherical and a few millimetres in diameter. The microstructures of several commercially-available AN compositions were investigated using environmental scanning electron microscopy (ESEM) and X-ray microtomography. Those intended for explosive use {{were found to be}} more porous than those intended for fertilizer use. The pores in explosive <b>prills</b> were also found to form a connected network. The elemental composition of pellets of mixed AN and dolomite was investigated using energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX); the dolomite additive was found to take the form of grains roughly 50 μm in size. The compaction behaviour of confined cylindrical beds of these <b>prills</b> and pellets was studied at strain rates between 4 × 10 − 4 s− 1 and 200 s− 1. Quasi-static experiments were performed using a screw-driven instrumented press, while higher-rate experiments used a drop weight, instrumented with a line laser and load cell. The resistance of a bed to compaction was found to depend on the microstructure of its <b>prills</b> in most cases. Denser <b>prills</b> offered greater resistance to compaction. The exception to this rule was a pellet, rather than <b>prill,</b> formulation. Beds were also found to offer more resistance to compaction at higher strain rates. The Kawakita compaction model was found to agree well with the experimental data. A commercial fertilizer, not containing any AN, was assessed for use as an inert mock for AN <b>prills</b> and pellets. <b>Prills</b> of a suitable size for this purpose were found using EDX to consist of P 2 O 5, with a coating of unknown composition. They were supplied mixed with smaller K 2 CO 3 and urea <b>prills.</b> The mixture was found to have comparable compaction behaviour to AN compositions, indicating that it was useful as a mock for those compositions. In a plate impact experiment on a single layer of P 2 O 5 <b>prills,</b> very little light was observed. This indicated that these <b>prills</b> were sufficiently inert for these purposes. The light produced by shocked granular ammonium nitrate beds and single <b>prill</b> layers was investigated using high-speed framing photography, photodiodes and gated visible-light spectroscopy. Framing photography of <b>prill</b> layers suggested that reaction in <b>prill</b> beds was dominated by effects internal to <b>prills.</b> This was further supported by the similarity between photodiode recordings of <b>prill</b> beds and beds of inert <b>prills</b> containing a single reactive <b>prills.</b> Framing photography of drop weight experiments searching for a mechanism for initiation of reaction by interaction between <b>prills</b> found nothing. Decay of the light output of the beds suggested that in both granular and <b>prill</b> beds this light output was due to small regions heated to thousands of kelvin, which then cooled. Spectroscopic study confirmed this. These regions were found to reach a peak temperature of 6660 ± 20 K, well in excess of the approximately 2000 K predicted by a simple chemical model. Investigation of spectral lines observed during this study indicated that the exothermic reaction that led to heating of these emitting regions involved NO...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: In {{this study}} the {{feasibility}} of joining <b>prilling</b> and microwave (MW) assisted treatments as combined technique to produce controlled release alginate beads was tested. Beads were produced by <b>prilling</b> (laminar jet break-up) using different polymer concentrations and loaded with ketoprofen, a slightly soluble non-steroidal anti-inflammatory BCS class II drug characterized by low melting point. MW assisted treatments applied using different irradiating conditions were performed as drying/curing step. The effect of formulation conditions and process variables on drying kinetics, particle micromeritics, shape, surface and inner characteristics of the matrix as well as drug loading and drug release behaviour was studied (USP pH change method). The properties of MW dried particles were compared to those dehydrated by convective methods (room conditions and tray oven 105 ◦C). Results showed that MW dried ketoprofen loaded beads were obtained in a very narrow dimensional range retaining shape and size distribution of the hydrates particles. Compared to the traditional drying methods, MW treatments were able to strongly increase drying rate of the hydrated beads achieving faster and controllable dehydration kinetics. Moreover, different regimes of irradiation affected structural properties of the particles such as matrix porosity {{as well as the}} solid state of the loaded drug. DSC, X-ray and FTIR analyses indicated complex chemical interactions between the drug and polymer matrix induced by MW, related with the regime of irradiation, that contributes to the differences in release profiles. In fact, MW treatments under different time and irradiating regimes are able to modulate drug release from alginate beads; high levels of irradiation led to beads suitable for immediate release oral dosage forms whereas the lowest regime of irradiation led to beads that achieved a prolonged/sustained release of the drug till 8 h in simulated intestinal medium.

Ketoprofen and ketoprofen lysinate loaded alginate beads were obtained in a very narrow dimensional range when the Cross model was used to set <b>prilling</b> operative conditions. Size distribution of alginate beads in the hydrated state was strongly dependent on viscosity of drug/polymer solutions and frequency of the vibration. The release kinetics of the drugs showed that drug release rate was related with alginate concentration and solubility of the drug. Alginate solutions with concentration higher than 0. 50 % (w/w) were suitable to prepare ketoprofen gastro-resistant formulation, while for ketoprofen lysinate alginate, concentration should be increased to 1. 50 % (w/w) in order to retain the drug in gastric environment.

40|$|Context: Ketoprofen lysinate (KL) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} drugs in the symptomatic treatment of some chronic inflammatory diseases.

Thus, the present work deals with its encapsulation in a hydrogel-based system by <b>prilling</b> in order to prolong its activity. Objective: In this paper, we propose alginate and pectin as carriers and release tailoring agent for the development of hydrogel-based beads for KL retarded and sustained release. Materials and methods: Beads were produced by a Nisco Encapsulator® using alginate or pectin. Operative variables were optimized to produce beads with desired morphology and size. Solid state properties were analyzed by SEM and DSC. Drug release performance was studied by Pharmacopeia pH-change assay to simulate gastrointestinal environment. Results and discussion: <b>Prilling</b> technique was successfully used to encapsulate high soluble drugs as KL in polysaccharides-based hydrogels.
