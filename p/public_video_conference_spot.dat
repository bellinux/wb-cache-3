40|$|M. Sc. (Computer Science) A <b>video</b> <b>conference</b> is an {{interactive}} meeting between {{two or more}} locations, facilitated by simultaneous two-way video and audio transmissions. People in a <b>video</b> <b>conference,</b> also known as participants, join these <b>video</b> <b>conferences</b> for business and recreational purposes. In a typical <b>video</b> <b>conference,</b> we should properly identify and authenticate every participant in the <b>video</b> <b>conference,</b> if information discussed during the <b>video</b> <b>conference</b> is confidential. This prevents unauthorized and unwanted people from {{being part of the}} conference and exposing any confidential information during the <b>video</b> <b>conference.</b> Present existing <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> systems however, have problems in this area, resulting in some risks. These risks relate precisely to the lack of facilities to properly identify and authenticate participants, making it possible for unwanted/unauthorised participants to join the conference or masquerade as another participant. It is especially a problem, when facilitators or organisers are the only participants that know the authorised participants, or participants allowed in a <b>video</b> <b>conference.</b> In this dissertation, we review the risks that are present in <b>video</b> <b>conferencing,</b> and create a security system, (called BioVid) that mitigates the identification and authentication risks in <b>video</b> <b>conferences.</b> BioVid uses a Speeded-Up Robust Features or SURF-based face recognition approach, to identify and authenticate any participant in a <b>video</b> <b>conference.</b> BioVid continuously monitors the participants to check if masquerading has occurred and when it does detect an unauthorised participant, it informs the Service Provider. The Service Provider can then deal with the problem by either kicking the participant or asking the other participants to vote the unauthorised participant out of the <b>video</b> <b>conference...</b>|$|R

40|$|Thesis (MTech. {{degree in}} Office Management and Technology) [...] Tshwane University of Technology, 2004. <b>Video</b> <b>conferencing</b> {{networks}} are complex. Implementation and cross-departmental functioning requires a managerial strategy {{to ensure a}} systematic and logical implementation process. The implementation of <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> equipment is based on existing managerial strategies e. g. Process, System, Operation and Project Management in a Total Quality Management (TQM) framework. Managerial functions (planning, organising, activation/motivation and control) are applied in the concluding of an effective managerial strategy for <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> implementation. The proposed managerial strategy for <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> implementation was tested with <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> equipment suppliers (in-depth structured interviews) and <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> network managers (questionnaires) in Gauteng. The proposed strategy (chapter 5) as constituted from comprehensive literature studies (chapters 3 and 4) needed to be adapted. The final <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> implementation strategy (chapter 8) indicated that the inclusion of processes and procedures {{is not sufficient to}} ensure successful implementation. The final strategy for <b>video</b> <b>conferencing</b> implementation is a flexible strategy that is aligned with existing managerial (operational and implementation) strategies to ensure successful implementation. This is based on the involvement of senior, middle and lower management that also includes the appointment of project teams to ensure successful cross-departmental implementation. The formulation of quality structures and evaluation criteria ensures that strategic objectives set in the strategic plan, vision and mission statement, are achieved. The conclusion of the implemented project is by testing the project through pilot projects and finalising project documentation by means of an acceptance letter to the management team. Dissemination of data (whether the project was successful or not) has to be made to the senior management team. <b>Video</b> <b>conferencing</b> implementation is not just an action that takes place on an ad hoc basis. It requires a logical and systematic plan, supported by a scientific managerial strategy to ensure that the set objectives and quality standards are achieved...|$|R
