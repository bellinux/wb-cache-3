25|$|Sail-powered {{vehicles}} travel {{over land}} or ice at apparent wind speeds that {{are higher than}} the true wind speed, close-hauled on most <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail.</b> Both land yachts and ice boats have low forward resistance to speed and high lateral resistance to sideways motion.|$|E
25|$|Recreational {{and sport}} {{catamarans}} typically {{are designed to}} have a crew of two and be launched and landed from a beach. Most have a trampoline on the bridging structure, a rotating mast and full-length battens on the mainsail. Performance versions often have trapezes to allow the crew to hike out and counterbalance capsize forces during strong winds on certain <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail.</b>|$|E
2500|$|The rigging of the proa {{also shows}} {{a high degree}} of elegance. By keeping the wind always {{to one side of the}} boat, the forces act on the sail, mast, rigging and akas always in the same direction. [...] Where a tacking boat must have stays on both sides of the mast, with only one set under tension at a time, the layout of the proa {{requires}} stays on only one side, where they are under tension on all <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail.</b> [...] Having the ama to the windward side also allows the use of materials like bamboo for the akas—the akas only need to be able to bear the weight of the ama, which is countered by the tension on the stays. [...] Leeward akas, on the other hand, would need to bear the displacement of the ama, and cannot be assisted by tensioned rope.|$|E

50|$|Self {{steering}} aboard Winnibelle II on its Atlantic crossing from Douarnenez, France, to New York in 1933 {{was somewhat}} {{similar to a}} Braine gear, using twin jibs (Trinquettes jumelles) with their sheets connected to the rudder via an array of blocks and lines. The long keeled Winnibelle II was perfectly stable on course on close-hauled or beam reach <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sailing</b> but the self steering twin jib system could take over in the trickier downwind broad reaches and running <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sailing.</b>|$|R
50|$|Sailing {{employs the}} wind—acting on sails, wingsails or kites—to propel a craft {{on the surface}} <b>of</b> the water (<b>sailing</b> ship, sailboat, windsurfer, or kitesurfer), on ice (iceboat) or on land (land yacht) over a chosen course, which is often {{part of a larger}} plan of navigation. A course defined with respect to the true wind {{direction}} is called a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail.</b> Conventional sailing craft cannot derive power from <b>sails</b> on a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> that is too close into the wind. On a given <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail,</b> the sailor adjusts the alignment <b>of</b> each <b>sail</b> with respect to the apparent wind direction (as perceived on the craft) to mobilize the power of the wind. The forces transmitted via the sails are resisted by forces from the hull, keel, and rudder <b>of</b> a <b>sailing</b> craft, by forces from skate runners of an iceboat, or by forces from wheels <b>of</b> a land <b>sailing</b> craft to allow steering the course.|$|R

5000|$|Nielsen {{summarised}} the efficiencies of wingsails, {{compared with}} conventional sails, for different <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail,</b> as follows: ...|$|E
5000|$|In these {{diagrams}} {{the direction}} of travel changes {{with respect to the}} apparent wind (VA), which is constant for the purpose of illustration. In reality, for a constant true wind, apparent wind would vary with <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail.</b> Constant VA in these examples means that either VT or VB varies with <b>point</b> <b>of</b> sail; this allows the same polar diagram to be used for comparison with the same conversion of coefficients into units of force (in this case Newtons). In the examples for close-hauled and reach (left and right), the <b>sail's</b> angle <b>of</b> attack (α [...] ) is essentially constant, although the boom angle over the boat changes with <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> to trim the sail close to the highest lift force on the polar curve. In these cases, lift and drag are the same, but the decomposition of total aerodynamic force (FT) into forward driving force (FR) and lateral force (FLAT) vary with <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail.</b> Forward driving force (FR) increases, as {{the direction of}} travel is more aligned with the wind, and lateral force (FLAT) decreases.|$|R
50|$|On this <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> (also called running {{before the}} wind), the true wind {{is coming from}} {{directly}} behind the sailing craft. In this mode the sails act in a manner substantially like a parachute.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} deny that, Dromas," [...] {{answered}} the captain, [...] "but {{you have not}} detained me long. Nevertheless, I was on the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sailing</b> without your friend, for the winds and waves respect no one." ...|$|R
50|$|In <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> {{that range}} from {{close-hauled}} to a broad reach, sails act substantially like a wing, with lift predominantly propelling the craft. In <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> from a broad reach to down wind, sails act substantially like a parachute, with drag predominantly propelling the craft. For craft with little forward resistance ice boats and land yachts, this transition occurs further off the wind than for sailboats and sailing ships.|$|E

60|$|Upon the {{following}} day Harry at once obtained leave to go on shore for twenty-four hours. Immediately he reached the Head he chartered a wherry, {{and was on the}} <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sailing</b> when he heard a well-known voice among a group of sailors standing near him.|$|R
60|$|Still, {{how it was}} that, {{although}} our vessel had lain three days anchored nigh the isle, its one human tenant should not have discovered us till just upon the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sailing,</b> never to revisit so lone and far a spot, this needs explaining ere the sequel come.|$|R
50|$|Again, {{in these}} {{diagrams}} the direction of travel changes {{with respect to the}} apparent wind (VA), which is constant for the sake of illustration, but would in reality vary with <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> for a constant true wind. In the left-hand diagram (broad reach), the boat is on a <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail,</b> where the sail can no longer be aligned into the apparent wind to create an optimum angle of attack. Instead, the sail is in a stalled condition, creating about 80% of the lift as in the upwind examples and drag has doubled. Total aerodynamic force (FT) has moved away from the maximum lift value. In the right-hand diagram (running before the wind), lift is one-fifth of the upwind cases (for the same strength apparent wind) and drag has almost quadrupled.|$|R
50|$|Three sail shape {{controls}} which {{control the}} leech tension, and therefore sail twist, are the mainsheet, the boom vang and the traveler. The mainsheet pulls the boom (and therefore {{the foot of}} the sail) primarily inwards at lower <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> and downwards at higher <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail.</b> Manipulation of the traveler can counteract this because it always pulls the boom laterally. The vang on the other hand does the opposite, it always changes the height of the boom.|$|E

5000|$|Upwash {{from the}} sails - the airflow {{around the top}} of the mast is {{distorted}} by the presence <b>of</b> the <b>sails.</b> This effect varies with the sails set at the time, the wind speed and the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail,</b> but is noticed by the true wind angle changing from port to starboard tack, and the true wind speed changing from when beating to running ...|$|R
5000|$|The race ran {{every two}} years between 1996 and 2002, and then skipped a year, with {{subsequent}} races beginning in 2005, 2007, 2009, 2013, 2015. The routes used for the races have varied slightly each race. The routes are selected {{to allow for a}} high proportion <b>of</b> downwind <b>sailing,</b> the most technically demanding <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail.</b> Other considerations include port stops in locations related to yacht or race sponsors.|$|R
50|$|Front loops may be initiated, unhooked, from {{close-hauled}} through broad-reach <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail,</b> {{with ease}} of initiation often determined by wave-face rather than wind direction.|$|E
5000|$|In <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> {{that range}} from {{close-hauled}} to a broad reach, sails act substantially like a wing, with lift predominantly propelling the craft. In <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> from a broad reach to down wind, sails [...] act substantially like a parachute, with drag predominantly propelling the craft. For craft with little forward resistance ice boats and land yachts, this transition occurs further off the wind than for sailboats and sailing ships. In the no-go zone sails are unable to generate motive power from the wind.|$|E
50|$|Windward and leeward {{directions}} {{are important}} factors (<b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail)</b> {{to consider when}} sailing a sailing ship. Other terms with broadly the same meaning are widely used, particularly upwind and downwind.|$|E
5000|$|Aerodynamic {{forces on}} sails depend on wind speed and {{direction}} {{and the speed}} {{and direction of the}} craft. The direction that the craft is traveling with respect to the true wind (the wind direction and speed over the surface) is called the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail.</b> The speed <b>of</b> the craft at a given <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> contributes to the apparent wind ( [...] VA)—the wind speed and direction as measured on the moving craft. The apparent wind on the sail creates a total aerodynamic force, which may be resolved into drag—the force component {{in the direction of the}} apparent wind—and lift—the force component normal (90°) to the apparent wind. Depending on the alignment <b>of</b> the <b>sail</b> with the apparent wind, lift or drag may be the predominant propulsive component. Total aerodynamic force also resolves into a forward, propulsive, driving force—resisted by the medium through or over which the craft is passing (e.g. through water, air, or over ice, sand)—and a lateral force, resisted by the underwater foils, ice runners, or wheels <b>of</b> the <b>sailing</b> craft.|$|R
50|$|A sailing craft {{is said to}} be sailing {{close-hauled}} (also called beating {{or working}} to windward) when its sails are trimmed in tightly, are acting substantially like a wing, and the craft's course is as close to the wind as allows the sail(s) to generate maximum lift. This <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> lets the sailing craft travel diagonally to the wind direction, or 'upwind'.|$|R
2500|$|Aerodynamic {{forces on}} sails depend on wind speed and {{direction}} {{and the speed}} {{and direction of the}} craft ( [...] VB [...] ). The direction that the craft is traveling with respect to the true wind (the wind direction and speed over the surface – VT [...] ) is called the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail.</b> The speed <b>of</b> the craft at a given <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> contributes to the apparent wind ( [...] VA [...] )—the wind speed and direction as measured on the moving craft.

5000|$|... #Caption: Aerodynamic {{forces for}} two <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail.</b> Left-hand boat:Down wind—predominant drag propels {{the boat with}} little heeling moment. Right-hand boat:Up wind (close-hauled)—predominant lift both propels the boat and {{contributes}} to heel.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> {{clarify the}} realities of sailing into the wind. One of the <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> is [...] "Head to Wind." [...] A boat turns through this point on each tack. It is {{the point at which}} the boat is neither on port tack or {{starboard}} tack and is headed directly into the wind. However, a boat cannot sail directly into the wind, thus if it comes head to the wind it loses steerage and is said to be [...] "in irons." [...] Thus boats sailing into the wind are actually sailing [...] "Close Hauled" [...] (i.e., with sails tightly trimmed).|$|E
50|$|Sails may be {{classified}} as either triangular, which describes sails that either come to one point of suspension at the top or where the sail comes to a point at the forward end, or quadrilateral, which includes sails that are attached to a spar {{at the top and}} have three other sides, or as square. They also may {{be classified}} as symmetrical (square sails and symmetric spinnakers) or asymmetrical (most other sails). Typically, asymmetrical sails perform better on <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> closer to the wind and are designed for fore-and-aft rigs than symmetrical sails, which perform best on <b>points</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> that are further from the wind direction.|$|E
50|$|All sailing craft reach a {{constant}} forward speed (VB) {{for a given}} wind speed (VT) and <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail,</b> when the forward driving force (FR) equals the forward resisting force (Rl). For an ice boat, the dominant forward resisting force is aerodynamic, since the coefficient of friction on smooth ice is as low as 0.02. Accordingly, high-performance ice boats are streamlined to minimize aerodynamic drag.|$|R
5000|$|Sailing {{into the}} wind is a sailing {{expression}} that refers to a sail boat's ability to move forward despite being headed into (or very nearly into) the wind. A sailboat cannot make headway by sailing directly {{into the wind}} (see [...] "Discussion," [...] below), so the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sail</b> into the wind is called [...] "close hauled", and is 22° to the apparent wind.|$|R
60|$|The others quite {{agreed with}} Captain Reuben's views, {{and the next}} morning the ship's head was pointed west. Two days later, when passing an island they saw, on opening a headland, a port with many houses, and a Spanish flag flying from a mast on shore. Two large Spanish vessels were lying there. They were {{apparently}} on the <b>point</b> <b>of</b> <b>sailing,</b> for the sails were already dropped.|$|R
