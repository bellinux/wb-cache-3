The primary aim of forest thinning is to increase growth of selected trees, but ecological thinning is done to favor development of wildlife habitat (such as hollows) rather than focusing on increased timber yields.

The respondents were chosen by the model SKOGSÄGARPROFILENTM (forest owner profile). The results of the interviews showed that five categories: ownership, the storm Gudrun´s impact, silviculture, forestry contacts and driving force was important.

Furthermore, when <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> is not carried out or postponed, the silviculture has got lower priority, and other chores higher priority.

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this study is to {{investigate}} the needs of <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> on private owned forest properties, which is considered to be increasing.

The study was made through a survey among members of Mellanskog forest owners association. The survey was distributed by e-mail. The time to answer was set to two weeks. The answers indicate that the most common reason why the <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> is delayed, or not done at all, is the forest owner’s lack of time.

40|$|Between 1953 and 1961 {{a series}} of <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> {{experiments}} were established in Sweden, in which selective thinning removals to various numbers of stems per hectare were applied.

In total, experiments were established in 140 stands in Sweden, mainly in Scots pine and Norway spruce sites. The experiments have usually been assessed every five years {{up to the first}} thinning (at a dominant height of 12 - 15 m).

40|$|In {{the last}} decade {{relative}} <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> costs have increased, {{as a proportion of}} total silvicultural costs, and the annual area treated with <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> has decreased, partly because stands are denser and the development of tools has been slow compared to advances in tools for other forestry measures, calling for new methods and techniques to be developed. Reducing competition by topping secondary stems might be an attractive alternative to traditional <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> for biological, technical and financial reasons. However, the topped secondary stems must not overtop the main stems and should not present obstacles {{at the time of the}} first commercial thinning. Topping, i. e. top-cutting or top-breaking of secondary stems, was tested in birch (Betula sp.) stands with the background that increased competition from topped secondary stems may promote higher quality in the main stems and that topped secondary stems might die and disappear by the time of the first commercial thinning as a result of treatment. Furthermore, growth of the topped birch stems was studied after treatment in different seasons. Motor-manual equipment for topping and a mechanised prototype were tested in an experimental rig and the mechanised prototype was also tested in a field experiment. All tools were compared with a conventional brush saw, regarding both time requirements and quality of work. Results indicated that topping, especially at a higher level above ground leading to a smaller height lead for the main stems, gave a significant increase in main stem quality of birch, compared to traditional <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning.</b> Secondary stems showed higher survival after topping compared to traditional <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning,</b> but topping at a lower level above ground gave lower survival than topping at a higher level. No differences in growth or survival were detected between top-cut and top-broken stems over three years and survival and height growth was lower for stems treated in a growing condition compared to stems treated earlier in the year. Despite having a significantly less powerful engine, a motor-manual pole saw prototype designed to be used for topping was a competitive alternative to the brush saw in terms of both time consumption and damage to the residual stand. The mechanised prototype seemed to be a competitive alternative in high diameter and dense stands. Although the quality of work obtained with the mechanised prototype was equally high to the quality obtained with the brush saw, the results regarding time requirements for the mechanised prototype from the experimental study could not be verified in field experiments, resulting in a faster operation under field conditions with the brush saw irrespective of type of stand. It was also concluded that current standards for time requirements for brush saws might need to be revised, and that the height/diameter ratio might have an important influence on the time requirements for both motor-manual and mechanised <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> tools. Topping seemed to be an attractive alternative to traditional <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning.</b> However, further studies with varying initial and remaining stand density, stand height, species composition and tests of other possible advantages, e. g. reduced browsing pressure on main stems and reduced time requirements for mechanised tools when the cutting height can be raised above obstacles, should be performed. Tools for topping could be developed that would give equal or better results with respect to both quality and costs compared to the traditional brush saw. Mechanised equipment for <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> that can give acceptable results in terms of quality of work are available, but further development is needed in order to lower time requirements...|$|E

Aims To analyse <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> effects on tree size, reproductive potential, stem biomass and annual growth in 15 -year-old saplings. Methods Twenty nine circular plots (5 m radius) were established based on (1) years since thinning and (2) aspect. Non-thinned plots were included as controls. Sapling variables were measured and pine cones were counted and classified according to maturity. Three saplings per plot were felled, five sample disks were extracted from each and tree rings were analysed with Windendro® software. Results Sapling size, annual growth and stem biomass were higher in thinned plots than in control plots 2 – 4 years after thinning. Annual growth declined {{five years after}} thinning. Cone counts were higher 2 – 5 years after thinning, depending on the cone type. Aspect influenced some variables. Conclusion Thinning accelerated stand maturity but positive effects were indiscernible until 2 – 5 years later. Serotinous cones, which are fundamental to regeneration after fire, increased in number after 5 years. The effects of aspect were inconclusive due to interactions with years since thinning.

It {{is able to}} simulate natural and planted stands with pre-commercial and commercial thinning, as well as fertilisation. Four stand types were compared (natural, planted, planted and commercially thinned, natural with <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> and fertilisation) at three levels of site index (25.9, 32.0, and 38.1).

The experiment comprises five treatments based on combinations of three grades of <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> and three stump heights. Treatments include the unthinned control, thinning only of whips and wolf trees (using low stumps), and thinning for potential crop trees using low, medium or high stumps. All treatments were replicated three times. Stump heights averaged 10, 90 or 230 cm, respectively. Pre-treatment stem number (live trees) varied from 17, 500 to 41, 000 per ha. In the potential crop tree treatment, post-treatment stem number ranged from 4, 750 to 9, 500 per ha. Following two growth seasons, the quantity of stump regrowth increased with increasing stump height, the rate of stump regrowth increased with increasing stump height, the diameter growth of potential crop trees increased with decreasing stump height, the increase in stand height did not depend on stump height or post-treatment stem number, and the natural pruning of potential crop trees increased with increasing stump height. It remains to be seen, whether these trends hold in the long run, and whether additional economic return from the increase in wood quality with increasing stump height compensates for the reduction in diameter growth...|$|E

To demonstrate the utility of these coupled growth and wood density models, we predicted the growth and wood density for stands growing at three different sites: (1) southern South Island (MAT =  8  °C); (2) northern South Island (MAT =  10  °C); and (3) North Island (MAT =  12  °C). At each site, two different silvicultural regimes were simulated: (1) initial planting density of 1667 trees ha− 1, <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> to a residual stand density of 750 trees ha− 1 at mean top height of 14  m and commercially thinned to a residual stand density of 325 trees ha− 1 at mean top height 22  m (a typical regime for Douglas-fir in New Zealand); and (2) initial planting density of 1250 trees ha− 1, <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> to a residual stand density of 400 trees ha− 1 at mean top height of 14  m (a more aggressive early thinning regime).

30|$|In {{contrast}} to natural forest, in managed forest this post-disturbance (post-harvest) stage has low diversity of structural legacies and forest regeneration is often controlled through tree planting and vegetation control, and/or <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning.</b> This situation tends {{to create more}} homogeneous and less diverse stands, which may impair the adaptive capacity of the forest ecosystem to novel conditions.

40|$|Possibilities {{for energy}} wood {{procurement}} in the Leningrad region are assessed in this report. As sources for energy production, wood from thinnings, logging residues, non-industrial round wood and residues from sawmilling are considered. The costs for energy wood procurement are also calculated. Available energy wood, {{based on the}} 2004 actual cut, if collected, is approximately 4 million m 3. Nearly 86 % of it is non-industrial round wood and felling residues in cutting areas (56 %) and central processing yards (30 %), the rest (14 %) are by-products from sawmilling. The deciduous tree species (birch and aspen) dominate and are valued at 65 % of {{the total amount of}} felling residiues and non-industrial wood. It is possible to intensify utilisation of forest resources and thereby also to increase the use of wood in energy production. The total amount could be 54 % higher if the allowable cut could be utilised completely and 124 % higher if thinnings could also be utilised completely. There are, however, big differences within the region, as the current rate of utilisation of forest resources varies in the region. Currently, <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> is an economically unfeasible source of energy wood. Despite well developed technologies, the high costs of the <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> make supply of energy wood unprofitable. Commercial thinnings are economically more attractive as sources of energy wood. However, a choice of energy wood procurement chain for the 1 st commercial thinning is limited by cost factors. There are more possibilities for energy wood supply from the 2 nd commercial thinning. The most cost-efficient supply chain based on a harvester and a forwarder allows a profitable energy wood supply from a distance of up to 150 km. Currently, at final felling areas non-industrial wood is an economically feasible resource for energy production. The same applies to the availability of process residues at central processing yards and sawmills, where lump wood and slabs are the most cost-efficient resources for wood chip production and at present these sources of energy wood look very attractive.

Site index (SI) for this case analysis is 60 base age 25 for planted woods-run loblolly seedlings. Case 1 : A landowner has a tract that is reseeded naturally by loblolly pine, 1, 344 trees per acre in year 9.

However, economic analyses undertaken during the 1960 s showed that alternative silvicultural regimes comprising early pruning coupled with <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> could provide very good economic returns (Fenton and Sutton 1968). This resulted in stands being grown at wider spacing, with heavy thinning to concentrate growth on {{a smaller number of}} trees. Rotation lengths were shortened considerably from 45 down to 30  years and, in some cases, 25  years (James 1990). It was recognised at least as early as the 1970 s that these changes in silvicultural practices would give rise to trees with a higher proportion of corewood, larger branches in the upper un-pruned logs and a reduction in wood density (Burdon et al. 2004; Cown 1992; Harris et al. 1976). Selective breeding to improve wood density was recommended as one means to compensate for the reduction in wood quality associated with changing silvicultural practices (Harris et al. 1976).|$|E
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study and to model the effect of <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> and pruning on diameter growth, on a 15 th year old stand of Pinus taeda L. in northeastern Argentina. The study was established in a deep red clay soil, with a systematic design of blocks for thinning intensity and sub-blocks for pruning intensity. The thinning treatments, performed at 3 year old were: 1666 (without thinning); 833; 416 and 208 trees ha- 1. The pruning were done annually, starting at 3 year old, and applied by 2, 3 or 4 consecutive years removing 30, 50 and 70 % of the living crown, respectively. The general model obtained by linear regression allowed to estimate, with good precision (mean absolute deviation as a percentage equal to 5. 71), the quadratic mean diameter (QMD) in function of age. The variable remnant trees, remnant crown, and number of prunings were considered to estimate the general function coefficients. At 15 year old, the QMD varied from 25. 6 to 41. 5 cm to 1666 and 208 trees ha-, 1 respectively, without pruning. The QMD growth was negatively affected by pruning and positively affected by thinning...|$|E
40|$|Seven {{silvicultural}} {{scenarios for}} pure and even aged maritime pine stands were simulated using a diameter class growth and yield model, for {{three levels of}} site index (low, medium and high). Total and merchantable yield along rotation and mean annual increment at rotation age were simulated. Revenue obtained from sale of standing timber (three commercial thinning and final harvest) was estimated. Costs paid for stand establishment (site preparation and plantation) and treatments (release, <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> and pruning) were also estimated. For each scenario, a cash-flow was simulated and economic efficiency was assessed using the net present value of an infinitive series of rotations (NPVIS) and the {{internal rate of return}} (IRR). The economic analysis results proved the selection of an intensive management stand prescription that is used as a guide for reforestation projects, using artificial regeneration by plantation, when the main goal is round wood yield. For areas of natural regeneration, a fully stocked stand prescription, pulp wood yield oriented, was selected. This prescription enables saving in site preparation and plantation costs, being at the moment the most suitable for the existing naturally regenerated maritime pine stands of Portuguese private forest areas...|$|E
40|$|Landslides {{have been}} mapped at least {{annually}} in the 473 ha North Fork Caspar Creek watershed since 1985, allowing evaluation of landslide distribution, characteristics, and rates associated with second-entry partial clearcut logging of 1989 to 1992. Comparison of sliding rates in logged and forested areas shows no appreciable difference for streamside slides (size range: 7. 6 to 380 m 3). However, the incidence of large landslides, including both streamside and upslope slides of 98 to 4900 m 3, varied by treatment. Such slides displaced 12 m 3 /yr per km 2 of unlogged forest but showed rates one and two orders of magnitude higher in logged areas and along roads, respectively. Moreover, the volume rate of sliding from roads in logged areas was {{more than three times}} that from forested roads. The largest slides occurred 9 to 14 years after logging, when root cohesion is expected to be near its minimum value; and within a few years of <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning,</b> when hydrologic changes are again evident. Large slides may strongly influence suspended sediment yields both by increasing yields for several years after the slide and by emplacing temporarily stable channel and floodplain deposits, which then provide a sediment source for future gully and bank erosion...|$|E
40|$|The Caspar Creek Experimental Watersheds were {{established}} in 1962 to {{study the effects of}} forest management on streamflow, sedimentation, and erosion in the rainfall-dominated, forested watersheds of north coastal California. Currently, 21 stream sites are gaged in the North Fork (473 ha) and South Fork (424 ha) of Caspar Creek. From 1971 to 1973, 65 % of the timber volume in the South Fork was selectively cut and tractor yarded, and from 1985 to 1991, 50 % of the North Fork basin was harvested, mostly as cableyarded clearcut. The South Fork logging resulted in annual suspended sediment load increases exceeding 300 %. Mass-wasting has been predominantly associated with roads, landings, and tractor skid trails in the South Fork. Accelerated mass-wasting and renewed sediment mobilization in the South Fork have occurred since 1998. Peak flow increases detected following North Fork logging are attributable to reduced canopy interception and transpiration. These recovered to pretreatment levels about 10 years after logging, followed by renewed increases from <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning.</b> Annual sediment loads increased 89 % in the partially clearcut North Fork and 123 % to 238 % in 4 of 5 clearcut sub-basins. Twelve years after logging, elevated storm-event sediment yields persist in some clearcut tributaries...|$|E
40|$|The general {{belief that}} intense regenerationmeasures are financially viable and {{essential}} for high sustained yields of commercial forest products has been inadequately tested. This field experiment evaluates effects of three dif-ferent regeneration intensities 24 – 27 years after clear-cutting of 14 sites across Sweden. The treatments, desig-nated high (HI), normal (NI) and low (LI), respectively, consisted of: mechanical site preparation and planting of large seedlings at 2 × 2 m spacing, with supplemental planting and <b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning</b> (PCT) when deemed necessary; standard local practices; and natural regeneration with no site preparation, artificial regener-ation or PCT. Average crop seedling densities were highest and lowest (3359 and 1662 ha 21) under the HI and LI treatments, respectively, 4 – 8 growing seasons after planting. After 24 – 27 years, HI {{also resulted in}} higher mean stem volume (90 m 3 ha 21) than LI (36 m 3 ha 21) but was {{not significantly different from}} NI (65 m 3 ha 21) and increasing the regeneration intensitywas not consistently positive. In some cases, high planted seedlingmortality and generally abundant natural regeneration resulted in minor (or no) differences between the treatments. The results illustrate that current Swedish regeneration standardsmay need revision in order to reflect contemporary societal and commercial demands...|$|E
40|$|Cleaning (<b>pre-commercial</b> <b>thinning)</b> {{costs have}} {{increased}} relative to logging and regenera-tion costs, creating {{a desire for}} rationalisation. Cleaning with robots may be a solution, but automating stem selections requires a decision support system (DSS) capable of rendering acceptable results. The aims were to develop a DSS for automation of individual stem selec-tions in practical cleaning, and to test, using simulations, if it renders acceptable results. Data on 17 young forest stands were used to develop a DSS that selects stems by species, position (including distance and density parameters), diameter, and damage. Six simulations were run, following the DSS, with different target settings for density, percentage of deciduous stems and minimum distance between stems. The results depend on the initial state of the stands, but generally met the requested targets in an acceptable way. On average, the density results deviated by – 20 % to + 6 % from the target values, the amount of deciduous stems shifted towards the target values, {{and the proportion of}} stems with defined damaged decreased from initially 14 – 90 % to 4 – 13 %. The mean diameter at breast height increased and the minimum allowed distance between stems was never violated. The simulation results indicate that the DSS is operational. However, for implementation in robotics a crucial problem is to automati...|$|E
