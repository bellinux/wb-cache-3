40|$|Effective {{collaboration}} dynamics are at {{the core}} of learning, knowledge exchange and innovation processes. Nevertheless, in today’s global environment, a large number of collaboration initiatives fail to deliver the value expected, as complexity is increased by the diversity and the distributed nature of the people, groups, and knowledge sources and by the knowledge integration processes involved. Effective collaboration competencies are hence emerging as a key condition for productive and sustainable value creation at the individual, team, organizational and inter-organizational level. L 2 C- Learning to Collaborate- is an ongoing research project addressing the design of effective immersive simulation-based learning experiences su <b>pporting</b> the development of collaboration competencies both at the individual and organizational level.

40|$|World Congress of Malacology, Ponta Delgada, July 22 - 28, 2013. There {{is growing}} {{consensus}} that anthropogenic activities are impacting {{the structure and}} functioning of marine ecosystems and {{that these can have}} profound community level effects, particularly when targeting keystone species. Limpet harvesting in Azores (NE Atlantic) has been taking place probably since the islands were first colonized. These species are highly exploited and the stocks in most islands have declined steadily with catastrophic effects on coastal communities. They are a locally important resource but also ecologically important species and require prioritizing conservation strategies. Such strategies should be su <b>pported</b> by reliable data on the structure and dynamics of their populations, so that ecological hotspots are identified and protected. Characterizing the genetic diversity and structure of marine exploited populations is thus of paramount importance to identify such units of conservation. Here we describe and develop species-specific microsatellite markers for the harvested limpets Patella candei and Patella aspera using whole genome shotgun 454 sequencing. A total of 309 bioinformatic-validated pairs of primers were obtained from P. aspera microsatellite enriched library. The optimization of the amplification conditions of selectect microsatellites (simplex and multiplex reactions) was performed in a gradient thermal cycler to optimize locus-specific amplification conditions and test their utility as genetic markers. Forty pairs of primers were tested, and about 28 revealed to be polymorphic. Using the same procedure, a total of 107 pairs of primers were validated for P. candei of which 15 turned out to be polymorphic. These novel genetic markers can be used to study the population genetic structure and evolutionary history of both patellid species e. g. levels of genetic variability within and between populations, and thus to contribute for stock conservation and management along their distributional area...|$|R

With respect to the correlates of quality of motivation, it was shown t hat mastery goals were related to emotional and social adjustment regard less of students perceived competence or peer acceptance and prosocial behavior. Also, it was tested whether experimentally manipulated mastery goals with task-referenced or self-referenced standards yielded differe nt effects on performance and well-being, whereas it was demonstrated th at athletes endorsing performance goals for controlling reasons, as thes e are defined within SDT framework, were more susceptible to report ill- being. Also, further evidence for a link between achievement goals and a utonomous and controlled motivation was provided, and an association bet ween mastery goals and outcome goals and between performance goals and a bility goals was also found. With respect to the antecedents of quality of motivation, the present doctoral research provided evidence of a moti vational model in which the need for competence and autonomous motivatio n mediated the effects of positive competence feedback on intrinsic moti vation, well-being, and performance. Similarly, it demonstrated {{that the need for}} autonomy and competence mediated the differential relation of autonomous and controlling styles of corrective feedback to well being, and moral functioning. Last, it showed that autonomy- and relatedness-su <b>pporting</b> environments interact with individuals motivational orientatio ns on the prediction of enjoyment and vitality as it was found that opti mally motivated individuals benefited more when embedded in favorable mo tivational environments.

Paracoccus denitrificans contains an unusual arrangement whereby two of the se transporters, NarK 1 and NarK 2, are fused into a single protein, N arK, which delivers nitrate to the respiratory nitrate reductase and transfers the pro duct, nitrite, to the periplasm.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{assistance}} for tu rf diagnosis far outstrips {{the availability of}} agricultural agents to offer this service. To meet this de mand, thousands of Web Sites {{have been developed to}} assist with the diagnosis and treatment of turf grass problems. The two major types are Web Documentation Sites (DS’s) and Expert Systems S ites (ES’s). Documentation Sites consist of a library of relevant documents with a search engi ne. The user simply uses the search engine to find documents which will help with the problem. Ex pert Systems consist of a user interface, a computer readable knowledge base and an infere nce engine. The user answers questions about problem symptoms; this may include evaluating pi ctures of lawns with various problems. The Expert System then presents a description of the most likely problems and describes treatments. The {{purpose of this study was}} to empirically comp are the diagnostic effectiveness of a DS with an ES for turf grass problems. Three groups were used—a control group, a DS group, and an ES group. The Control group received no diagnostic assi stance. (The control was necessary since many people have developed some knowledge of grass problems in caring for their own or others’ lawns). All groups attempted to correct ly diagnose three common lawn problems. The DS group used five excellent Document websites to aid with the diagnosis. The ES group used a well-regarded Expert System. Di agnostic correctness was measured by rating the similarity of the participant’s written diagnosis with correct di agnosis obtained from a Turf Grass expert. The mean diagnostic correctness of the DS group and the mean diagnostic correctness of the ES group were both highly significan tly better than the mean diagnostic correctness of the Control group. There was no significant difference between the mean diagnostic corr ectness of either the DS or the ES group.

Background: The dynamic {{changes that occur}} in protein {{expression}} after treatment of a cancer in vivo are poorly described. In this study we measure the effect of chemotherapy over time on {{the expression of a}} panel of proteins in ovarian cancer xenograft models. The objective was to identify phosphoprotein and other protein changes indicative of pathway activation that might link with drug response. Methods: Two xenograft models, platinum-responsive OV 1002 and platinum-unresponsive HOX 424, were used. Treatments were carboplatin and carboplatin-paclitaxel. Expression of 49 proteins over 14 days post treatment was measured by quantitative immunofluorescence and analysed by AQUA. Results: Carboplatin treatment in the platinum-sensitive OV 1002 model triggered up-regulation of cell cycle, mTOR and DDR pathways, while at late time points WNT, invasion, EMT and MAPK pathways were modulated. Estrogen receptor-alpha (ESR 1) and ERBB pathways were down-regulated early, within 24 h from treatment administration. Combined carboplatin-paclitaxel treatment triggered a more extensive response in the OV 1002 model modulating expression of 23 of 49 proteins. Therefore the cell cycle and DDR pathways showed similar or more pronounced changes than with carboplatin alone. In addition to expression of pS 6 and pERK increasing, components of the AKT pathway were modulated with pAKT increasing while its regulator PTEN was down-regulated early. WNT signaling, EMT and invasion markers were modulated at later time points. Additional pathways were also observed with the NFκB and JAK/STAT pathways being up-regulated. ESR 1 was down-regulated as was HER 4, while further protein members of the ERB B pathway were upregulated late. By contrast, in the carboplatin-unresponsive HOX 424 xenograft, carboplatin only modulated expression of MLH 1 while carboplatin-paclitaxel treatment modulated ESR 1 and pMET.

40|$|Policy context: Generally speaking, {{there is}} a (slow) {{movement}} towards more gender equality taking place in France, that is perhaps most visible in politics (for examp le, there are 107 women out of 577 members of the National Assembly, with very few in positions of responsibility, www. observatoire-parite. gouv. fr). The work situation of women in France is reasonably favourable, with good child-care and relatively high ac tivity rates for women. Gender equality policy cannot be considered a priority in French research, although the principle of equality is fundamental to the French Republic. Law 2001 - 397 of May 9, 2001 on professional equality {{between women and men}} both i n the public and the private sector, forbids any discrimination and requires a balanced composition of juries and selection committees in the civil service (to which tenured research and university personnel belong). However, it is not often enforced. What 's more, in the decree of application of the law (Décret n ° 2002 - 766 du 3 mai 2002), higher education and research 1 are exempted from having to balance their committees. The Research minister announced that this exception would be removed, in a communiqué on 2 November, 2005 2. This has not yet been done. A new law on research was voted in 2006 (Loi de programme n ° 2006 - 450 du 18 avril 2006). It stipulates that nominations in the various committees that it mentions {{as well as at the}} heads of government orga nisations should "assure a balanced representation of men and women " 3 and that the government will publish a yearly report on the question 4.

40|$|Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) is a {{group of}} neurodevelopmental {{conditions}} characterized by difficulties in social interaction, communication and the presence of repetitive or stereotyped behaviors. Previous studies have demonstrated structural and functional abnormalities in different brain regions in ASD. Motor difficulties, unusual percept ion and minor physical anomalies have been reported but not systematically investigated in the adult population with ASD and normal intelligence. In Study I, the internal consistency as well as diagnostic and concurrent validity of the Swedish version of t he Ritvo Autism Asperger Diagnostic Scale - Revised (RAADS - R) were evaluated. The results imply that the Swedish version of the RAADS - R has good psychometric properties and is strongly correlated with the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). The RAADS - R captures ASD symptoms and can be used for screening of ASD {{as well as in the}} assessment of ASD in adults with normal intelligence. In Studies II and III, regional cerebral blood flow (rCBF) was assessed by positron emission tomography (PET) in thirteen adults with ASD and ten neurotypical controls after psychiatric and neurological assessments. In comparison with the neurotypical controls, individuals with ASD showed significantly increased cerebral blood flow bilaterally in large parts of cerebellum, occipital ass ociative cortex and posterior parietal cortex. In Study III, principal components corresponding to “Autistic/ADHD symptoms”, “Sensori - motor integration” and “Intelligence/motor sequencing” were identified by factor analysis based on the normalized scores o f 13 neuropsychological measures. The positive correlation between ‘‘Autistic/ADHD traits’’ and rCBF in the caudate indicates a possible association of CBF changes with the executive impairments and ritualistic or stereotyped behaviors typical for ASD. Fur thermore, “Sensorimotor integration” was correlated with rCBF in the occipital visual cortex, reflecting an atypical visual perception often reported in ASD. Cerebral blood flow in the left thalamus was negatively correlated with all three factors which su <b>pports</b> the implication of this brain region in the pathophysiology of ASD. Autistic traits and ADHD symptoms were associated with shared neural substrates whereas sensory - motor deficits were grouped in another independent factor and correlated with rCBF in other regions. In Study IV, minor physical anomalies (MPAs) were investigated in 53 individuals with ASD and 50 age - and gender matched controls. The ASD group showed significantly more MPAs in comparison to the control group. Moreover, MPAs were correlat ed with severity of symptoms and overall functioning according to the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF). On the whole, various behavioral, cognitive, neurological and morphological signs are suggested to converge into the ASD phenotype.

40|$|The Supportive Schools Project (SSP) was a {{three year}} {{randomised}} cluster comparison trial conducted from 2005 to 2007, involving 21 Perth metropolitan secondary schools from the Catholic Education s ector. The SSP aimed to develop, implement and empirically evaluate a whole -of-school bullying {{prevention and intervention}} program. This thesis utilised data collected at post-test 2 of the SSP, when the student cohort was in Term 3 of Year 9, to identify the individual, interpersonal and contextual variables associated with secondary school students’ bystander behaviour and how these predictors may differ according to gender. The peer group who is witness to bullying can {{play a crucial role}} in the active reinforcement of this aggression (1 - 3). Many students do not agree with bullying and would like to intervene and help the child being bullied, yet most act in ways which enable and maintain the bullying (3). A wide range of individual and interpersonal variables have been examined with regard to their influence on bystander behaviour, however there is a paucity of research regarding the relative importance of multiple personal and interpersonal predictor variables on bullying (4, 5), and participant role behaviour in particular. This study aimed to identify which of a wide range of variables were most important in determining Year 9 boys’ and girls’ thoughts and actions as a bystander to bullying, including the participant roles they take. These variables included individual factors (self- esteem, problem behaviours, pro- victim attitudes, outcome expectancies, normative beliefs about bullying and loneliness); interpersonal factors (peer support, social competence, and delinquent peer affiliation), and; contextual factors (school bullying ethos, school connectedness, connectedness to teachers, safety at school, classroom management climate, academic achievement and absenteeism). Multivariate analyses used in this thesis revealed that f or both boys and girls, individual variables and then interpersonal variables, rather than school-related contextual variables, were most important in determining bystander behaviour. The most important variables associated with both boys’ and girls’ pro -social bystander thoughts and actions were: having pro-victim attitudes, believing helping behaviour to be normative in their year group, and reporting less bullying- related delinquent peer affiliation. That individual and peer -group level interpersonal factors (i. e. normative beliefs about helping, having ever watched or joined in bullying to keep or make friends) were especially important in determining the responses both boys and gi rls have when they see another student being bullied suggests the need to work at the peer- group level to foster group norms that discourage bullying. Additionally, that pro- victim attitudes were an important predictor of bystander thoughts and actions, su <b>pports</b> the use of intervention strategies directed towards empathy building and raising awareness of the detrimental effects of bullying among boys and girls. The predictors of boys’ and girls’ bystander thoughts and actions were mostly similar, suggesting that interventions to address these risk and protective factors would be of benefit for both genders and largely do not need to be tailored specifically to boys and girls. However, some predictors did differ between boys and girls in terms of their relati ve importance in determining bystander behaviour. Interestingly, the frequency of reporting the different bystander thoughts and actions differed between boys and girls (e. g. a higher percentage of girls reported trying to help and walking away, and a higher percentage of boys reported joining in and watching the bullying).

Methods: After one familiarization session, 14 patients with moderate to severe COPD (mean age 65 ± 4 years; forced expiratory volume in 1 second (FEV 1) 55 %± 18 % predicted) performed two quadriceps isokinetic endurance tests on two separate occasions within a 5 – 7 -day interval. Quadriceps isokinetic endurance tests consisted of 30 maximal knee extensions at angular velocities of 90 ° and 180 ° per second, performed in random order. Test-retest reliability was assessed for peak torque, muscle endurance, work slope, work fatigue index, and changes in FEV 1 for dyspnea and leg fatigue from rest to the end of the test. The intraclass correlation coefficient, minimal detectable change, and limits of agreement were calculated. Results: High test-retest reliability was identified for peak torque and muscle total work at both velocities. Work fatigue index was considered reliable at 90 ° per second but not at 180 ° per second. A lower reliability was identified for dyspnea and leg fatigue scores at both angular velocities. Conclusion: Despite a limited sample size, our findings su <b>pport</b> the use of a 30 -maximal repetition isokinetic muscle testing procedure at angular velocities of 90 ° and 180 ° per second in patients with moderate to severe COPD. Endurance measurement (total isokinetic work) at 90 ° per second was highly reliable, with a minimal detectable change at the 95 % confidence level of 10 %. Peak torque and fatigue index could also be assessed reliably at 90 ° per second. Evaluation of dyspnea and leg fatigue using the modified Borg scale of perceived exertion was poorly reliable and its clinical usefulness is questionable. These results should be useful in the design and interpretation of future interventions aimed at improving muscle endurance in COPD.

40|$|Summary The {{journey through}} the study on Grassroots {{community-based}} inclusive e ducation and its outcomes has been considerably shaped by the field. Th e earlier déjà-vu attitudes about the Rwandan society and its socio-cu ltural context that the researcher had always been part of, was sensitiv ely changed through the exposure {{to a number of}} interventions in the fie ld and experiences within the communities surveyed. It is along this jou rney that new outlooks on the communities of the disabled Rwandan childr en in general, and on approaches required to meet their educational chal lenges and needs in particular, kept emerging. Our stance now, is in lin e with the search for innovative educational approaches that are able to alter the traditional strategies and deliver more access to inclusive l earning opportunities for disabled children, {{in the face of a}} wide range of challenges. The case studies highlighting achievements in circumstances that are app roximately similar to those in Rwanda have been deliberately discussed, presenting a wide spectrum of approaches and strategies, ranging from mi cro to macro frameworks of interventions. We learn from these that to be effective, the approaches of a program that is promoting inclusive educ ation of disabled children need to be both flexible and widely encompass ing. For example, some of the emerging lessons on ways to include disabl ed children through community-based programs are likely to involve: Enlisting and enhancing the community members support, beginning with t he most effectively involved family and community members, by empowering them with the means to understand better the needs of their disabled ch ildren. Developing an enabling environment in which disability concerns would be mainstreamed into development frameworks. To ensure sustainability, it is also important that an organisational su <b>pport</b> framework comprising of the local government, civil society organi sations and the private sector or NGOs, as well as disabled people thems elves, be developed. All the stakeholders in the inclusion program should be equipped in term s of relevant awareness, capacities and resources. The inclusion project for disabled children can be accomplished in situa tions of extreme poverty of the Rwandan communities if a vulnerability perspective is integrated in all aspects of community-based develo pment programs. Hence, disability issues much like gender being socially cross-cutting, ought to be incorporated in all stages of the project (d esign and appraisal, implementation, reviews, monitoring and evaluation). Finally, owing to historical, systemic and physical barriers, disabled c hildren, especially the severely disabled, can only be part of the inclu sion process if they are considered within the mainstream education refo rm process. In this way, the inclusion processes will be empowered with provisions, not only to cater for educational needs, but also involving a safety net system that ensures sustainable education within the wider spectrum of other needs. In other words, the study does not recommend any defined model of inclus ive education program for the Rwandan children with disabilities; rather, through highlighted cases and discussed experiences, it proposes a num ber of considerations and principles for both practitioners and policy m akers. The emerging position thus, suggests a dialogue between the communities (or beneficiaries) and various actors contributing to inclusive activiti es. Engagement into a dialogue entails both the community and practition ers taking a position where they are able to evaluate each others chall enges and inputs to inclusive initiatives, and a constructive feedback f rom either side be shared. By privileging a dialogue therefore, the comm unity-based inclusion undertaking would allow support from both experts and local community, whose initiatives would be assured. It is under suc h conversations that despite the numerous economic and social limitation s and challenges in the remote Karamoja in Uganda and Douenza in Mali (i n case study 3), the local people, respective governments and NGOs were able to develop successful educational projects with inclusion perspecti ve. The peoples inputs included the promotion of their cultural values, fostering their nomadic way of life, and when these were adopted in the curriculum, they felt part of the educational project to which they owe d the obligation of support, thus, the engagement in a dialogue with sup portive NGOs and the Government became part of the initiative. In this w ay, the level of functional literacy and numeracy was raised considerabl y, social and basic technological skills found their place in the local curriculum, and appropriate ways of including the most marginalised grou ps such as girls and disabled children were proposed and developed with the support and means of the local communities. Our understanding from this study is that every human society is endowed with inherent potential and power to support its own disadvantaged peop le. These powers are identifiable within the cultural way of life at eve ry grassroots community level. Thus, the study suggests that an inclusiv e education model building on such potentials is the most sustainable be cause it draws from the local means and know-how, and is able to underst and more accurately the needs of the community. It is on such notions th at Fugayerollas (2000) model of intervention (In Fig. 20 & 21), an d proven experiences in remote African villages shared by Ingstad (1997), Vanneste (1997) and Stubbs (2002), jointly suggest a revisit to potent ials available within families and local communities of disabled childre n, because they are inherently endowed with cultural mechanisms with whi ch disadvantaged groups find support. The idea being emphasised does not rule out the existence of limitations, rather, it warns that poverty an d politically motivated challenges are enormous, and these cannot be ove rcome without mobilising enhancing and enlisting the support of those wh o have the first hand experience. We have pointed out for example hat the government commitment is practic ally unknown at the Rwandan grassroots community levels (See Fig. 17). B ecause of this phenomenon, we expressed scepticism about the possible su ccess of the national policy on Inclusive Education and Special Needs Ed ucation (SNE/IE), scheduled for this September 2006. We argued that the fact that for such an important policy to appear 17 years after the Chil ds Rights declaration, 16 years after the Jomtien declarations on Univ ersal Primary Education, and 12 years after the Salamanca statement on i nclusion, are all testimonies of a culture of procrastination of fundame ntal issues in Rwanda. Therefore, given this cultural trend, and the poo r channel of communication available among Rwandans as demonstrated by t he study, there are no evidences that the due inclusion policy will be c orrectly translated and quickly transmitted to the grassroots communitie s. In a way, we underlined the wide gap between the policy making level (organs) and the grassroots community level on issues related to disabil ity and inclusion, or an urgent need for putting in place an effective i mplementation program able to mediate between the two levels, capable of drawing and maintaining support from both. In the study, we also stressed policy frameworks and programs that are s upportive of inclusive education of disabled children in the neighbourho od schools. The central point however is not about what works best, but rather, about what is socially and functionally capable of generating op portunities, or what imposes barriers and therefore how can the former b e useful in counteracting the latter in order to achieve the best possib le access (or inclusion) for the disabled children in their neighbourhoo d school. It has been proposed in the emerging inclusion model in sectio n 11. 1 above for example, that rehabilitation centres and schools in the same communities should be able to open doors to each other, in order t o foster an integrated education system that is supportive of both the d isabled and the non-disabled children in the same setting. However, we a rgue that the success of such a setting is also dependent on the extent to which both the people in the community and the means available to the m are mobilised for the cause. In Rwanda, it may mean how religious orga nisations are supportive and coordinated for example, how the local lead ers and educators are able to understand and support the educational nee ds of the children with disabilities, how peer groups are enabled to fun ction with disabled youths in mutual support of each other. We have thus stressed and demonstrated that for ideas about inclusion to gain a foothold within the Rwandan grassroots communities, sensitisatio n is very crucial. We suggested an approach that responds to questions s uch as, who needs to be sensitised about inclusion most? Who can most effectively alter the communitys negative ways and imp art the positive thinking? How can the community be reached b est? The guiding principle is the need for transmission of adequate a wareness about disabilities and inclusion, and reaching as many people a s possible. Accounts on the plausible techniques to reach and change the dominant attitudes in the communities were apparent in a number of prev ious instances discussed above: § When the influential o ld lady who was popular in the community for her skills in local medicin e changed her attitude about disability for example, the results sent ph enomenal sensitising messages to the whole community, and the local peop le drastically changed from negative perceptions to total support of the social workers proposal of appropriate services. The latters work in sensitisation was made easier (In the extract in section 7. 2. 4). § In the same way, the c riteria set (in the study) for the selection of the informants among the social workers, are also examples of channels to be used for sensitisat ion. They stressed selecting those who are most effective and capable of reaching, understanding and changing the community (In the roles of Inn oc & Mama ARU in section 6. 1. 1). Being religious for example (In se ctions 7. 1 - 7. 3), being disabled or being an aware mother of a disabled c hild were some of the determinant factors on which criteria to chose eff ective informants or social workers were based, because these were also means by which the community was reached and understood. § The link between disab ility and some dominant religious beliefs in some communities were also found to be influential factors in determining what decisions are taken for disabled children by parents (In section 7. 2 & Fig. 12). This p henomenon suggests that sensitisation programs can also be effective if they are integrated within the local religious practices and programs (I n the role of ISAKs clergy father in section 7. 1). These and a few other examples in the study, all emphasise the idea that the problem of perception about disability is fundamental and unique in Rwanda, depending on the circumstances and communities, and if the issu e of inclusion of the disabled children has to be successful, then an ap propriately fitting method of sensitisation has to be devised. It was admitted however, that all the theories and claims discussed abov e, do not necessarily present the precise scale of the problems that the children with disabilities face, nor any feasible response to their nee ds, rather, it emphasises the process and procedures that might guide in clusive action within the limits and means of the Rwandan society. In ot her words, it will be understood that this study reflects strongly on th e normative research paradigm, representing an investigative journey thr ough complexities of the Rwandan communities in search of pointers to in clusive phenomena. In a way, we concur with Cohen et al. s (2003 : 22) vi ew that human behaviours in any society are often associated with normat ive paradigms because they are rule governed, thus, research approaches used in the study were devised in response to the rules that govern the Rwandan society as affirmed by Cohen et al. (2003) :  normative researchers try to devise general theory of human behaviour and to validate them through the use of increasingly complex r esearch methodologies To them, the basic reality is the collectivity; i t is external to the actor and manifest in society, its institutions and its organisationsthe researchers ultimate aim is to establish a compr ehensive rational edifice, a universal theory, to account for human an d social behaviour (p. 23). It will thus be understood that our study approach has underlined the co mplex problems that surround a substantial number of children who are ex cluded from the mainstream Rwandan education and consequently from meani ngful participation in the economic, social, political and cultural life of their society, pointing to feasible paths to explore towards their i nclusion. We share the argument apparent in the Dakar World Education Fo rum of April 2000 in its paragraph 19, that the need to address the vuln erabilities of learners who are marginalised and excluded from education al opportunities is urgent (UNESCO, 2000), and it asserts that:  In order to attract and retain children from marginalized and excluded groups, education systems should respond flexibly must be inc lusive, actively seeking out children who are not enrolled, and respondi ng flexibly to the circumstances and needs of all learners  (U NESCO World Education Forum on Education For All, Para. 33). The idea raised by the extract also calls for studies that are tailored to different environments and situations. However, we recognise that thi s study has not been able to address the many specific issues related to inclusive developments in Rwandan education. In fact it was established by the present study that the understanding of childrens disabilities and related issues are a function of social, cultural and economic facto rs, and therefore the study does not address many of these. We are aware that an educated mother is likely to be conversant with primary health care (including awareness about disabilities and reproductive health) fo r example, while non-educated mothers are more likely to be influenced b y the traditionally established perceptions about disability. In other w ords, the assumption that the parents level of education has a role to play in influencing the kind of services chosen for their disabled child ren is also founded, and demands to be investigated further (See Appendi x B & table 7). Likewise, issues related to specific methods and ad apted materials were not looked into. We thus suggest that future studie s will have to take care of some of these and the influences they have o n disabled childrens lives and their subsequent inclusion into the neig hbourhood schools. Our position in this study thus, is in line with the view that 'inc lusive education' is a transverse issue which regards all marginalised g roups of learners, and in the Rwandan situation, it cuts across all educ ation programs, ranging from early childhood education to adult educatio n, teacher education and curriculum development, as well as in spheres r elated to culture and social development.
