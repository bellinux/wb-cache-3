40|$|This {{thesis is}} about the banking of the seeds of food plants. It {{considers}} the practices and politics of that banking {{in order to understand}} its contribution to future food security scenarios. The thesis expands upon existing literature to provide new analytical and empirical insights into the preservation of biological materials. It does so by examining how practices undertaken in seed bank settings function to make seeds into materials of use to food security practitioners; an outcome which is achieved by the incorporation of banked seed into the framework of plant genetic resources. The thesis also contributes to knowledge on food security, by examining the function of those plant genetic resources within the food security milieu. First, the temporalities engendered by seed banking are analysed. Here, it is argued that seed banking assists in enhancing food security by acting as a mechanism which folds the <b>plant</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resource</b> materials of the past and future together through work undertaken in the present. Second, the material politics of <b>plant</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resource</b> preservation in a food security setting are explored, and a case is made for a framework by which seed may be banked "well"; a framework which is hinged on seed materiality. Overall, the thesis makes two key claims. First, that food security should not be regarded as a state that can be reached, but rather as an ongoing process of strengthening the food system as a whole. Second, that seeds must be regarded as materials with agency in seed banking practice, agency which impacts upon the practice of seed banking itself and on the wider political setting of that practice.

The meeting brought together farmers from distant parts of Nepal who were recognized for their outstanding dedication and contribution to the conservation of agricultural biodiversity, known as custodian farmers. Joined by researchers, NGO representatives and government officials, the meeting facilitated knowledge sharing and discussionbetween stakeholders in <b>plant</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resource</b> conservation in Nepal with regard to three objectives: 1) to define methods and tools to support the work of custodian farmers, 2) to explore policy options to enable agricultural biodiversity conservation and 3) to develop understanding of the characteristics and motivations of custodian farmers. These proceedings share {{the results of this}} experience. The document begins by establishing the context and goals of the workshop, it then shares papers contributed by researchers and NGO representatives that were presented at the event, participating farmer profiles, and the results of breakout discussions. The workshop recommendations were derived from the group discussions on the third day of the meeting and consist of a vision and action points to strengthen the conservation of agricultural biodiversity in Nepal as proposed by a spectrum of critical stakeholders in this pursuit. The document follows the general flow of events of the meeting, ending with reflections by the workshop organizers on the outcomes, as well as observations by gender specialist Marlène Elias (Bioversity International) on how to ensure the custodian farmer approach is gender responsive.

We determined that reduced pollen diversity probably has effects over and above those of inbreeding on progeny fitness. This provides an alternative mechanistic explanation for the indirect density dependence often inferred between conspecific density and offspring fitness. Martin F. Breed, Maria H. K.

40|$|Cryopreservation is the {{technology}} of choice not only for <b>plant</b> <b>genetic</b> <b>resource</b> preservation but also for virus eradication and for the efficient management of large-scale micropropagation. In this chapter, we describe three cryopreservation protocols (standard vitrification, droplet vitrification, and encapsulation vitrification) for date palm highly proliferating meristems that are initiated from vitro-cultures using plant growth regulator-free MS medium. The positive impact of sucrose preculture and cold hardening treatments on survival rates is significant. Regeneration rates obtained with standard vitrification, encapsulation-vitrification, and droplet-vitrification protocols can reach 30, 40, and 70 %, respectively. All regenerated plants from non-cryopreserved or cryopreserved explants don't show morphological variation by maintaining genetic integrity without adverse effect of cryogenic treatment. Cryopreservation of date palm vitro-cultures enables commercial tissue culture laboratories to move to large-scale propagation from cryopreserved cell lines producing true-to-type plants after clonal field-testing trials. When comparing the cost of cryostorage and in-field conservation of date palm cultivars, tissue cryopreservation is the most cost-effective. Moreover, many of the risks linked to field conservation like erosion due to climatic, edaphic, and phytopathologic constraints are circumvented. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
