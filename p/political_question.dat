5|$|In 287 BC, the plebeians again seceded. To end the secession, the lex Hortensia was passed, which {{required}} that plebiscites, laws {{passed by the}} Plebeian Council, be binding on the whole Roman people. The Hortensian law resolved the last great <b>political</b> <b>question</b> of the earlier era; the electoral and legislative sovereignty of the assemblies was confirmed and would remain part of the constitution until {{the demise of the}} Republic. As a whole, the outcome of the political struggles of the early republic was to eliminate the privileged status of patricians in the constitution and grant the plebs recognition of their own officers. The institution of the Senate was also now arguably stronger, as it became a repository of former magistrates rather than a body of hereditary nobles.|$|E

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{controversial}} theories in constitutional discourse is the doctrine of <b>political</b> <b>questions.</b> The court, by this, seeks to insulate itself from political pressures by avoiding the determination of <b>questions</b> which appear <b>political</b> in nature. The singular reason for this act is basically that some questions, such as this, are outside the purview of the courts to decide. Courts are therefore enjoined to refuse the determination of <b>political</b> <b>questions</b> in order to insulate itself from politics. This is despite the fact that democracy enjoins, constitutionalism, free speech, accountability, transparency, human rights, political pluralism and so on on the part of governmental institutions. The institution in which these concepts are anchored is the court. The paper therefore makes a critical exposition of the doctrine of <b>political</b> <b>questions</b> and contends that the court cannot insulate itself from politics merely because it has avoided the determination of <b>political</b> <b>questions.</b> Rather, this will amount to court abdicating its constitutional role as an organ of government.

5|$|The Hortensian Law {{deprived}} the patricians {{of their}} last weapon against the plebeians, and thus resolved the last great <b>political</b> <b>question</b> of the era. No such important political changes occurred between 287 BC and 133 BC. The important laws of this era were still enacted by the senate. In effect, the plebeians {{were satisfied with the}} possession of power, but did not care to use it. The senate was supreme during this era because the era was dominated by questions of foreign and military policy. This was the most militarily active era of the Roman Republic.|$|E
5|$|The great {{accomplishment}} of the Hortensian Law {{was in that}} it deprived the Patricians of their final weapon over the Plebeians. Therefore, the new Patricio-Plebeian aristocracy replaced the old Patrician aristocracy, and the last great <b>political</b> <b>question</b> of the earlier era had been resolved. As such, no important political changes occurred between 287 BC and 133 BC. This entire era was dominated by foreign wars, which eliminated the {{need to address the}} flaws in the current political system, since the patriotism of the Plebeians suppressed their desire for further reforms. However, this era created new problems, which began to be realized {{near the end of the}} 2nd century BC. For example, the nature of Rome's military commanders changed. Roman soldiers of earlier eras fought short wars, and then returned to their farms. Since their generals did the same thing, the soldiers came to view their generals as being nothing more than fellow citizen-soldiers. Now, however, wars were becoming longer and of a larger scale. Thus, this period saw a growing affinity between the average citizen and his general, while the generals acquired more power than they had ever held before.|$|E
5|$|As the {{independent}} state of Belgium consolidated after the Revolution, {{the issue of}} a consensus language in the country became an increasingly important <b>political</b> <b>question.</b> At the start of the period, French was the dominant language, and was the only language that was approved for use in legal and government business anywhere in the country. It was also the language of the economic and social elite, even in Flanders. By the 1860s, with Flemish dialects in decline, increasing numbers of Flemish people of all social classes were bilingual, paralleling a similar decline in northern France. However, partly inspired by a resurgence in Flemish literature and culture, the Flamingant political movement began to develop, with their first political parties formed in the 1860s and 70s. Political agitation by Flamingant groups, often directed by local priests, led to Belgium becoming officially bilingual in 1870. Teaching Dutch in all secondary schools in Flanders became compulsory, reinforcing the language's presence. By 1898, Dutch was officially recognized as an equal language to French in legal matters. During {{the first decades of the}} 20th century, the Flemish Movement became increasingly radicalized and began to develop as a mass political movement (although not a united one), fully emerging during the First World War.|$|E

Their argument is that an amendment that would allow a non-state district to have two Senators would deprive the states of their equal suffrage in the Senate and would therefore require unanimous ratification by all the states.

25|$|Earlier, as General Ridgway {{was about}} to open Operation Courageous, the gains he already had {{registered}} in his Killer and Ripper advances had influenced a decision in Washington by which operations above the parallel assumed new importance as a <b>political</b> <b>question.</b> The decision centered on {{how and when to}} approach the desired cease-fire. Notwithstanding the building evidence of North Korean offensive preparations, officials of the Departments of State and Defense believed that Ridgway's recent successes might have convinced the Chinese and North Koreans that they could not win a military victory and, if this was the case, that they might agree to negotiate an end to hostilities. On the advice of these officials, President Harry S. Truman planned to make a public statement suggesting the United Nations' willingness to end the fighting. The statement was carefully worded to avoid a threatening tone and so to encourage a favorable reply. Truman intended to deliver the appeal as soon as his statement had been approved by officials of all nations that had contributed forces to the U.N. Command.|$|E

He fought hard {{to protect the rights of}} the less populous states, arguing for a strong upper house organised along state lines. He also argued for a number of concessions to Western Australia, and for the building of a trans-Australian railway. Although he was largely unsuccessful in his endeavours, by 1900 he was convinced that better terms were not to be obtained, so called the referendum in which Western Australians voted to join the federation, and Western Australia became a part of Australia in 1901.|$|E
