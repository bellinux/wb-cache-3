5|$|Anderson et al. argue that, {{aside from}} acute care, {{emergency}} medicine can also <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> public health. Vaccinations for many {{diseases such as}} diphtheria, tetanus and pertussis can be administered by emergency departments, patients can be targeted for specific interventions such as counseling for substance abuse, and conditions like hypertension can be detected and treated. Emergency departments are excellent locations to train health care providers and to collect data, {{because of the high}} number of patients. Emergency medicine also improves public health by preventing secondary disease developing from an initial presentation (initial symptoms), and it serves as {{the first line of defense}} in disaster scenarios.|$|E

5|$|Deal Castle {{was seized}} by Parliamentary forces {{at the start of}} the first English Civil War between the {{supporters}} of King Charles I and Parliament, resulting in the dismissal of Byng as a suspected Royalist, and his replacement by Colonel Rainsborough, a vice-admiral. The castle did not <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the remainder of the initial conflict. After the few years of unsteady peace after 1645, the Second Civil War broke out in 1648, this time with Charles' Royalist supporters joined by their Scottish allies. The Parliamentary navy was based in the Downs, protected by Walmer and the other Henrician castles, but by May a Royalist insurrection was under way across Kent.|$|E
5|$|During HBV infection, {{the host}} immune {{response}} causes both hepatocellular damage and viral clearance. Although the innate immune response does not <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> these processes, the adaptive immune response, in particular virus-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes(CTLs), contributes {{to most of}} the liver injury associated with HBV infection. CTLs eliminate HBV infection by killing infected cells and producing antiviral cytokines, which are then used to purge HBV from viable hepatocytes. Although liver damage is initiated and mediated by the CTLs, antigen-nonspecific inflammatory cells can worsen CTL-induced immunopathology, and platelets activated at the site of infection may facilitate the accumulation of CTLs in the liver.|$|E
5|$|The BCG vaccine has limitations, and {{research}} {{to develop new}} TB vaccines is ongoing. A number of potential candidates are currently in phase I and II clinical trials. Two main approaches {{are being used to}} attempt to improve the efficacy of available vaccines. One approach involves adding a subunit vaccine to BCG, while the other strategy is attempting to create new and better live vaccines. MVA85A, an example of a subunit vaccine, currently in trials in South Africa, is based on a genetically modified vaccinia virus. Vaccines are hoped to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> treatment of both latent and active disease.|$|E

The Hearnes Center and Mizzou Arena are two other large sport and event venues, the latter being the home arena for Mizzou's basketball team. Taylor Stadium is host to their baseball team and was the regional host for the 2007 NCAA Baseball Championship. Columbia College has several men and women collegiate sports teams as well. In 2007, Columbia hosted the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics Volleyball National Championship, which the Lady Cougars participated in.|$|E
5|$|Thrips setipennis is {{the sole}} {{pollinator}} of Wilkiea huegeliana, a small, unisexual annually flowering tree or shrub in the rainforests of eastern Australia. T. setipennis serves as an obligate pollinator for other Australian rainforest plant species, including Myrsine howittiana and M. variabilis. The genus Cycadothrips is a specialist pollinator of cycads, the flowers of which are adapted for pollination by small insects. Thrips are likewise the primary pollinators of heathers in the family Ericaceae, and <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the pollination of pointleaf manzanita. Electron microscopy has shown thrips carrying pollen grains adhering to their backs, and their fringed wings are perfectly capable of allowing them to fly from plant to plant.|$|E
5|$|Trade winds blow {{from east}} to west across the Hawaiian islands, and the {{presence}} of Mauna Loa strongly affects the local climate. At low elevations, the eastern (windward) side of the volcano receives heavy rain; the city of Hilo is the wettest in the United States. The rainfall supports extensive forestation. The western (leeward) side has a much drier climate. At higher elevations, the amount of precipitation decreases, and skies are very often clear. Very low temperatures mean that precipitation often occurs in the form of snow, and the summit of Mauna Loa is described as a periglacial region, where freezing and thawing <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> shaping the landscape.|$|E

5|$|Homosexual arousal in {{childhood}} appeared to predict adult homosexuality, while homosexual activities and arousal during adolescence {{had a very}} strong connection with adult homosexuality. Rape and sexual molestation {{did not appear to be}} significant in the development of homosexuality. Heterosexual arousal during childhood had a very small effect on adult sexual preference. Homosexual women were more likely to have their first homosexual encounter before their first heterosexual encounter. Phenomena associated with physical maturation, such as the age at which menstruation began, did not appear to <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> the development of sexual preference, while parental attitudes toward sex and failure to enjoy early heterosexual activity also seemed unimportant. Sexual feelings seemed important in the development of adult homosexuality.|$|E
5|$|Marco Polo was {{an armored}} cruiser {{built for the}} Royal Italian Navy (Regia Marina) in the 1890s, the first of her type in Italian service. The ship spent the bulk of her career {{deployed}} in the Far East. Between deployments she participated in the Italo-Turkish War of 1911–12 during which she caused a diplomatic incident with the Austro-Hungarian Empire. After that affair Marco Polo was sent to Libya where she bombarded the towns of Homs, and Zuara and the defenses of the Dardanelles. In between these operations, the ship provided naval gunfire support to the Royal Italian Army in Libya. Due to her age, Marco Polo did not <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> World War I, serving as an accommodation ship in Venice until she began conversion into a troopship in 1917. After a series of renamings in 1920–21, the ship was stricken from the naval register in 1922 and subsequently sold for scrap.|$|E
5|$|Trees <b>play</b> <b>a</b> <b>significant</b> <b>role</b> <b>in</b> {{reducing}} {{erosion and}} moderating the climate. They remove carbon dioxide {{from the atmosphere}} and store large quantities of carbon in their tissues. Trees and forests provide a habitat for many species of animals and plants. Tropical rainforests {{are one of the}} most biodiverse habitats in the world. Trees provide shade and shelter, timber for construction, fuel for cooking and heating, and fruit for food as well as having many other uses. In parts of the world, forests are shrinking as trees are cleared to increase the amount of land available for agriculture. Because of their longevity and usefulness, trees have always been revered, with sacred groves in various cultures, and they play a role in many of the world's mythologies.|$|E
