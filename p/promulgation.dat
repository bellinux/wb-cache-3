5|$|Royal assent or {{sanction}} is {{the method}} by which a country's monarch (possibly through a delegated official) formally approves an act of that nation's parliament. In certain nations, such assent makes the act law (<b>promulgation)</b> while in other nations assent is distinct from <b>promulgation.</b> In {{the vast majority of}} contemporary monarchies, this act is considered to be little more than a formality; even in those nations which still permit their monarchs to withhold royal assent (such as the United Kingdom, Norway, and Liechtenstein), the monarch almost never does so, save in a dire political emergency or upon the advice of their government. While the power to withhold royal assent was once exercised often in European monarchies, it is exceedingly rare in the modern, democratic political atmosphere that has developed there since the 18th century.|$|E

5|$|A {{scientist}} with a PhD in plant physiology, Marshall became independently wealthy {{after the death}} of his father in 1929. He had started his outdoor career in 1925 as forester with the U.S. Forest Service. He used his financial independence for expeditions to Alaska and other wilderness areas. Later he held two significant public appointed posts: chief of forestry in the Bureau of Indian Affairs, from 1933 to 1937, and head of recreation management in the Forest Service, from 1937 to 1939, both during the administration of President Franklin D. Roosevelt. During this period, he directed the <b>promulgation</b> of regulations to preserve large areas of roadless land that were under federal management.

5|$|After Indian Independence in 1947, all the non-princely {{states were}} subject to a test of {{religious}} majority in which the Muslim majority areas formed the Dominion of Pakistan, while the other regions formed the Dominion of India. Murshidabad (the capital city for both, the Nawabs of Bengal and the Nawabs of Murshidabad) {{became a part of}} East Pakistan (now Bangladesh) for two days, as it had a Muslim majority. However, it became a part of India on 17 August 1947. The Pakistani flag was brought down from the Hazarduari Palace and the Indian tricolour was hoisted atop the palace. The Nawabs, after the takeover by the British had no actual power and after merging with India too, they had yielded power, as the Government of India took over control of all the areas that merged with India. Furthermore, with the <b>promulgation</b> of the Indian Constitution on 26 January 1950, the Dominion of India was transformed into the Republic of India, and the Article 18 of the Indian Constitution (which {{is a part of the}} Right to Equality, a fundamental right in India), titles were abolished. The Article prevents the state from confirming any title except those titles given by the Government to those who have made their mark in military and academic fields. Such titles and awards include the Bharat Ratna, the Padma Shri and the Padma Vibhushan (the Supreme Court of India, on 15 December 1995, upheld the validity of such awards). Thus, with the <b>promulgation</b> of the Constitution, the title of the Nawab Bahadur of Murshidabad was abolished. And although, the Nawab Waris Ali Meerza held titles such as Raes ud-Daulah, they were not officially or legally recognised.|$|E

According to Article 91, the monarch shall give his or her assent and promulgate the new law within fifteen days of passage of a bill by the Cortes Generales.

5|$|Karmal's {{three most}} {{important}} promises were the general amnesty of prisoners, the <b>promulgation</b> of the Fundamental Principles of the Democratic Republic of Afghanistan and {{the adoption of a}} new flag containing the traditional black, red and green (the flag of Taraki and Amin was red). His government granted concessions to religious leaders and the restoration of confiscated property. Some property, which was confiscated during earlier land reforms, was also partially restored. All these measures, {{with the exception of the}} general amnesty of prisoners, were introduced gradually. Of 2,700 prisoners, 2,600 were released from prison; 600 of these were Parchamites. The general amnesty was greatly publicized by the government. While the event was hailed with enthusiasm by some, many others greeted the event with disdain, since their loved ones or associates had died during earlier purges. Amin had planned to introduce a general amnesty on 1 January 1980, to coincide with the PDPA's sixteenth anniversary.|$|E
50|$|Miles Ogborn partly {{answers the}} {{question}} that Shaw raises in Indian Ink: script and print {{in the making of}} the English East India Company when he explains how the East India Company introduced printing not simply to facilitate trade, but more importantly, to consolidate the empire. Therefore, the “fear of printing” as cited in the letter above disappears in the 1770s when the Company needs to cement the empire. Till this time, scribes made handwritten announcements and <b>promulgations</b> as seen in the letter cited above.|$|R
40|$|Are {{the risk}} and control {{developments}} in corporate governance changing {{the role of the}} external auditor? This paper examines how the concepts of risk and control are incorporated in current corporate governance <b>promulgations</b> and analyses the implications for the role of the external auditor. It is suggested that up till now the corporate governance debate has strengthened the position or role of the internal auditor in the advantage {{of the role of the}} external auditor. The <b>promulgations</b> have influenced the internal control mechanisms, and the control responsibilities have become more explicit. Dominant determinants for the future role of the external auditor seem to be in conflict, namely the value adding function of the audit with an alignment of risk oriented efforts by the auditor and the company versus the notion of "back to basics". The external auditors ought to recognise that they must be perceived as "the" experts regarding internal control and risk management and that this must be engrained as part of the service rendered, i. e. part of the value adding nature of an audit. At the same time they must improve the transparency of the audit standards and the communication processes of audit reporting.

50|$|Bhutanese {{legislation}} {{is the source}} of Bhutanese domestic law, including civil, criminal, and administrative law. Bhutanese {{legislation is}} created by the bicameral Parliament of Bhutan. Either the upper house National Council, the lower house National Assembly, or the Attorney General may author bills to be passed as acts, with the exception of money and financial bills, which are the sole purview of the National Assembly.

5|$|Later, again under {{pressure}} from the plebs, a political compromise was reached in which the consuls and tribunes would give place to a commission of ten men, the decemviri, who would be empowered to publish a code of laws for all Rome. According to Livy, it codified all public and private law, but however, its <b>promulgation</b> did not grant further political rights to the plebs, as it enshired into the tables a law banning intermarriage between plebeians and patricians. With a short attempt to establish a tyranny by the decemviri, they were overthrown by the second secession of the army, restoring the old republic and preventing {{the creation of a new}} constitution based on the ten-man commission.|$|E
5|$|The above {{procedures}} {{are not sufficient}} to cause an Act of Tynwald to come into full force of law. By ancient custom, an Act did not come into force until it had been promulgated at an open-air sitting of the Tynwald, historically held on Tynwald Hill at St John's on St John's Day (24 June), but, since {{the adoption of the}} Gregorian calendar in 1753, on 5 July (or on the following Monday if 5 July is a Saturday or Sunday). <b>Promulgation</b> originally consisted of the reading of the Act in English and Manx; but after 1865 the reading of the title of the Act and a summary of each section was sufficient. This was reduced in 1895 to the titles and a memorandum of the object and purport of the Act, and since 1988 only the short title and a summary of the long title have been read.|$|E
5|$|The {{canon law}} of the Catholic Church is the system of laws and legal {{principles}} made and enforced by the hierarchical authorities to regulate the church's external organisation and government and to order and direct the activities of Catholics towards the church's mission. In the Catholic Church, universal positive ecclesiastical laws, based upon either immutable divine and natural law, or changeable circumstantial and merely positive law, derive formal authority and <b>promulgation</b> {{from the office of}} pope who, as Supreme Pontiff, possesses the totality of legislative, executive and judicial power in his person. It has all the ordinary elements of a mature legal system: laws, courts, lawyers, judges, a fully articulated legal code, principles of legal interpretation and coercive penalties that are limited to moral coercion.|$|E
50|$|Kiszka's more {{important}} result as Metropolitan of Kiev was the Synod of Zamość, opened on 26 August 1720, in which were codified the canons of the Ukrainian Greek Catholic Church.

5000|$|The {{field of}} {{management}} {{may well be}} said to have originated in ancient China, including possibly the first highly centralized bureaucratic state, and the earliest (by the second century BC) example of an administration based on merit through testing. Far in advance {{of the rest of the}} world until almost the end of the eighteenth century, Sinologist Herrlee G.

5000|$|During the pontificate of Pius XII, “the most Marian Pope in Church history” , Roschini {{worked closely}} with the Pontiff, {{arranging}} his own publications parallel to Papal mariological <b>promulgations.</b> During and after the Vatican council, Roschini tried to adjust to the colder mariological spirit in his 1973 publication Il mistero di Maria considerato alla luce del mistero di Cristo e della Chiesa, an updated four volume handbook of mariology. This largely explains the animosity of Dominican theologian Yves-Marie Congar, strongly opposed to such perceived mariological excesses; indeed, in his journal, Congar once called the eminent Mariologist [...] "Trouduc Roschini" [...] ("Asshole Roschini").|$|R
5|$|While Article 34 of the {{constitution}} of Luxembourg formerly required the grand duke or duchess to sanction and promulgate a new law for it to take effect, the required sanction was removed in 2008, after Grand Duke Henri informed his prime minister {{that he could not}} in good conscience assent to a bill to permit euthanasia in the country. The subsequent constitutional amendment removed the need for assent while retaining the need for the Grand Duke to promulgate new laws. The Grand-Duke's signature is still required, but does not imply assent, only <b>promulgation</b> (announcement that the law has been enacted by Parliament). The Grand-Duke did sign the Euthanasia Act under this new constitutional arrangement.|$|E
5|$|As part {{of these}} changes, in July 1960 the 27th Battalion was amalgamated with the 43rd/48th Battalion (Hindmarsh Regiment) and 10th Battalion (The Adelaide Rifles) to form the Pentropic 1st Battalion, Royal South Australian Regiment (1 RSAR), with the 27th Battalion's {{personnel}} forming 'A' and 'B' Companies within this organisation. The 16 battle honours awarded to the 2nd AIF's 2/27th Battalion, which had served in North Africa, Syria, and New Guinea with the 7th Division were entrusted to the battalion in 1961, through the <b>promulgation</b> of Army Order 135. In 1965, the Australian Army's experiment with the Pentropic structure was abandoned and the CMF was once again reorganised {{with many of the}} Pentropic battalions being split once again to form additional battalions. On 1 July 1965, 1 RSAR was split and the 10th, 27th and 43rd Battalions were reformed in their own right as battalions of the Royal South Australia Regiment. On 29 November 1987, the 10th and 27th Battalions were linked to form the 10th/27th Battalion, Royal South Australia Regiment (10/27 RSAR). This unit continues to exist to this day, maintaining the battle honours and traditions of its predecessor units.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} Bede wrote the Historia Ecclesiastica, {{there were two}} common ways of {{referring}} to dates. One was to use indictions, which were 15-year cycles, counting from 312 AD. There were three different varieties of indiction, each starting on a different day of the year. The other approach was to use regnal years—the reigning Roman emperor, for example, or the ruler of whichever kingdom was under discussion. This meant that in discussing conflicts between kingdoms, the date {{would have to be}} given in the regnal years of all the kings involved. Bede used both these approaches on occasion, but adopted a third method as his main approach to dating: the Anno Domini method invented by Dionysius Exiguus. Although Bede did not invent this method, his adoption of it, and his <b>promulgation</b> of it in De Temporum Ratione, his work on chronology, is the main reason why it is now so widely used. Beda Venerabilis' Easter cycle, contained in De Temporum Ratione, was developed from Dionysius Exiguus’ famous Easter table.|$|E
