40|$|A {{satellite}} system for optical communications {{such as a}} multi-access laser transceiver system. Up to six low Earth orbiting satellites send satellite data to a geosynchronous satellite. The data is relayed to a ground station at the Earth's surface. The earth pointing geosynchronous satellite terminal has no gimbal but has a separate tracking mechanism for tracking each low Earth orbiting satellite. The tracking mechanism has a ring assembly rotatable about an axis coaxial with the axis {{of the field of}} view of the geosynchronous satellite and a <b>pivotable</b> <b>arm</b> mounted for pivotal movement on the ring assembly. An optical pickup mechanism {{at the end of each}} arm is positioned for optical communication with one of the orbiting satellites by rotation of the ring...|$|E
