40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to know influence of <b>process</b> <b>oil</b> to the physical properties tensile strength and elongation at break of rubber compound for hand water pump. Vulcanized rubber makes from Rubber Smoke Sheet (RSS) and Styrene Butadiene Rubber (SBR 1502) as raw material. Ingredient which added to raw material were Paraffin Wax, Strearic Acid, ZnO, CaCO 3, Carbon Black, <b>Process</b> <b>Oil,</b> CBS, TMT, AOSP and Sulphur. Raw material rubber and ingredient were compounded in a two roll mill and formed to slab by hydraulic press at temperature 1500 C and pressure 150 kg/cm 2. It should be carry out by varying <b>process</b> <b>oil</b> 3 – 9 part by weight raw material. The compound was tested tensile strength and elongation at break. The result of this research indicated that <b>process</b> <b>oil</b> (X 1) and tensile strength (Y 1) have regression equation as Y 1 = 235, 697 – 8, 33 X (correlation coeffisien = 0, 72) while <b>process</b> <b>oil</b> and elongation at break has regression equation as Y 2 = 251, 64 + 12, 75 X (correlation coeffisien = 0, 97). ...|$|R

50|$|On {{the other}} hand, Russia diversified its export markets by {{building}} the Trans-Siberian oil pipeline {{to the markets}} of China, Japan and Korea, {{as well as the}} Sakhalin-Khabarovsk-Vladivostok gas pipeline in the Russian Far East. Russia has built LNG plant on Sakhalin and is building another one in Primorye, aiming to increase the overseas gas exports. Meanwhile, in the Gulf of Finland Russia has built a major Ust-Luga port connected to the Baltic Pipeline System-II, which allowed the export of oil without transit through the ports of the Baltic states. The share of <b>processed</b> <b>oil</b> slowly grows with major oil refineries being built in Tatarstan and other regions of Russia.|$|E

The Ohio Oil Company controlled the field and piped its product to markets in the U.S. Midwest. A part-time Ohio Oil employee, Roy Chamberlain, obtained permission to use oil from the Lance Creek pipeline and refine it. Using salvaged equipment from the defunct Pennsylvanian Belgo-American Refinery in Casper, Chamberlain and his partner James Hoblit built their refinery in 1933 in Lusk on a 1.5 acre site. Some of the equipment used by the C & H had been made as early as 1886.|$|E
5000|$|China has the 4th largest {{area for}} organic {{agricultural}} {{land in the}} world at 1.9 million hectares.In 2009, there were 4,000 certified organic enterprises in China, primarily focused on exporting to the United States, European Union and Japan. [...] The main products destined for export are beans, rice, tea, mushrooms, vegetables, <b>processed</b> <b>oil</b> and herbs. Beans, at approximately 42 percent of the total export value, is the largest export followed behind by cereals, nuts, vegetables, and tea. In 2009, Chinese organic products were traded to more than 20 different countries. According to the China Organic Food Certification Center (COFCC), exported organic products increased in value in 1995 from $300K USD to $350 million USD in 2004, which accounted for 1.7 percent of the total value for Chinese agricultural exports.|$|E

Economic development of southern Russia requires completion of the canal. Construction of additional processing capacity {{for oil and gas}} fields on the Russian Caspian territory would produce 15 million tons of cargo per year by 2020. <b>Processed</b> <b>oil</b> products would reach 25 million tons annually if Kazakhstan, Azerbaijan and Turkmenistan processing capacities expand as planned. That amount could be carried to Western Europe by waterways rather than by railway. Oil from the Caspian shelf oilfield could be directly transported by tankers to processing capacities of Lukoil and KazMunayGas on the Black Sea shore without trans-shipments.|$|E

5000|$|The {{collected}} {{waste oil}} is sold to local workshops or small factories for cleaning and packaging. When sold to workshops {{it is often}} transported {{on the back of}} bicycles by peddlers who are paid a monthly wage; afterwards, the oil is held in 200-liter barrels at the workshops until it is processed. On other occasions the oil goes to industrial cooking oil refineries for further processing before it finally reaches its end purpose. The industrial oil refineries are usually legitimate producers that sell the <b>processed</b> <b>oil</b> for use in the chemical or energy industries. Gutter oil is perfectly suitable as a raw ingredient for producing soap, rubber, bio-fuel, and cosmetics. However, the refiners can also have other intentions as the prices attained by selling it as cooking oil are much higher than if it is sold to the chemical or energy industries.|$|E
5000|$|Soybeans had {{replaced}} cotton as the country's most important crop by the 1980s. A relatively new crop for Paraguay, soybeans were not produced in any quantity until 1967, {{when they were}} introduced as the summer rotation crop in a national plan for self-sufficiency in wheat. After soybean prices nearly tripled in 1973, however, much of the land slated for wheat was sown with soybeans instead. As the lucrative nature of soybean cultivation and processing became apparent, several large agribusinesses from Brazil, the United States, and Italy engaged in large-scale, commercial production of soybeans and soybean oil. It is difficult to exaggerate the drastic growth soybeans enjoyed in Paraguay. In 1970 soybeans covered only 54,600 hectares and had an annual production of over 75,000 tons. [...] By 1987 soybeans covered some 718,800 hectares, {{more than any other}} crop, with an annual output of 1 million tons and export revenues of approximately US$150 million. [...] The soybean crop grew primarily in the newly colonized departments of Itapúa, Alto Paraná, Canendiyú, and Amambay. Soybeans were produced principally for the world market and sold both as a raw bean and as a <b>processed</b> <b>oil,</b> which was also consumed locally. Soybean prices generally rose beginning in the 1970s but experienced significant fluctuations in the early to mid-1980s before recovering in the late 1980s. The major constraint on growth in soybean output, besides price fluctuations, was the lack of storage, drying facilities, and local processing capacity.|$|E
5000|$|Geddes {{was born}} in Scotland in 1919 and {{claimed to have been}} raised by his father in Canada. He was said to have worked as a lumber camp monkey boy sawing tree tops and as a rum runner in the North Atlantic before {{returning}} to Britain during World War II, although some details are disputed. Geddes was a special forces instructor alongside Gavin Maxwell in Arisaig during the war, where as a sergeant in the Seaforth Highlanders he specialised in amphibious warfare.Following the war and his marriage to Cheltenham Ladies College-educated Jeanne, Geddes served on the Mallaig lifeboat. He joined Gavin Maxwell's basking shark oil extraction venture in the late 1940s, harpooning basking sharks in the Minch from the Traveller, the remains of which boat are still visible in Soay Harbour.After Maxwell's business venture failed and he abandoned the island, Geddes and his wife purchased Soay in 1952. Geddes continued fishing basking sharks, selling unprocessed livers rather than <b>processed</b> <b>oil</b> to Glasgow. While much of the remaining population of the island evacuated to Mull in 1953, Geddes and his family remained. Geddes protested at the lack of emergency telephone services and with the threat of loss of postal service to the remaining inhabitants of the island, he asked people to send him registered letters and packages. As a result the service was kept with post arriving once a month.Historian of Gaelic culture Margaret Fay Shaw said of him: [...] "Tex was a great storyteller and important as such. He was also immensely kind, and had that hunger for life and fun that is essential if you are to make a go of living in these islands. The Hebrides needs more people like Tex Geddes. So does the world." ...|$|E
