Despite the delay, the RAWCF and Jagger parted on very good terms, the {{committee}} exceptionally <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> final memorial.

5|$|Allen {{recalled}} The Original Series, {{and said}} that she was pleased to be remembered as an Orion slave girl. However, she was not <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> make-up process which took between four and five hours to apply, and required each actress to be sprayed with green make-up over their whole body. Removal of the makeup was via the showers in the Paramount lot's executive gym. The make-up team also needed to apply fake sweat and bruises to other members of the cast to represent the results of the increased aggression shown by them in the episode's plot.|$|E

I’ve been blown away by their professionalism, their confidence, their dedication. There aren’t a lot of cities like that. You {{kind of have to}} find the city that can be Indianapolis.

5|$|Contemporary {{critics were}} <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> album. Cyrus was praised for being natural and {{reflected}} while performing as herself. They also complimented Swift's performance and debated if she or Cyrus were more dominant.

In the United States, it peaked at number one on the Billboard 200 and the Billboard Top Country Albums chart. By May 2009, the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) certified the album platinum.|$|E
5|$|For the Coalition, the Russians were secure on {{the north}} bank of the Danube, {{awaiting}} reinforcements from Galicia; the bridges between Linz and Vienna had been destroyed, making French access to the Austrian capital more difficult, but not impossible. After six months of fighting in which the Austrians had enjoyed little good news, the Coalition could claim a difficult and timely victory. The French had retreated from the field with a badly mauled division and Kutuzov had secured the right flank. Indeed, Francis was so <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> outcome at Dürenstein that he awarded Kutuzov the Military Order of Maria Theresa.|$|E

5|$|Hancock's {{time in the}} West was brief. President Johnson, {{unhappy with}} the way Republican generals were {{governing}} the South under Reconstruction, sought replacements for them. The general who offended Johnson the most was Philip Sheridan, and Johnson soon ordered General Grant to switch the assignments of Hancock and Sheridan, believing that Hancock, a Democrat, would govern in a style more to Johnson's liking. Although neither man was <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> change, Sheridan reported to Fort Leavenworth and Hancock to New Orleans.|$|E
5|$|Heidfeld {{was finally}} {{announced}} as Webber's 2005 teammate at the Williams season launch on 31 January, with Webber admitting he was <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> eventual decision.

Expectations were high as Webber's former team boss Paul Stoddart predicted Webber would take his first victory in 2005 while Williams technical director Sam Michael said Webber would eventually win the World Championship with Williams.|$|E

According to Network World, Elliot Management was <b>pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> plan.|$|E
5|$|Le Père Goriot, {{especially}} in its revised form, marks an important early instance of Balzac's trademark use of recurring characters: persons from earlier novels appear in later works, usually during significantly {{different times of}} life. <b>Pleased</b> <b>with</b> <b>the</b> effect he achieved {{with the return of}} Rastignac, Balzac included 23 characters in the first edition of Le Père Goriot that would recur in later works; during his revisions for later editions the number increased to 48. Although Balzac had used this technique before, the characters had always reappeared in minor roles, as nearly identical versions of the same people. Rastignac's appearance shows, {{for the first time in}} Balzac's fiction, a novel-length backstory that illuminates and develops a returning character.|$|E
