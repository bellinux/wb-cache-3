A variety of <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> algorithms for Ethernet networks and the progress of standardization are summarized in the document. There are several kinds of <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> algorithms for Ethernet networks, such as STP, RSTP, MSTP and etc. However, since Ethernet signal move through detour route, it causes much time to recover. Accordingly, {{it is difficult to}} secure a usability of Ethernet networks and QOS(Quality of Service). Also, if the <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> protocol standardized by IEEE and ITU-T is used, it remains a inherent network <b>switching</b> time for <b>protection.</b> Therefore, a specific <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> algorithm for Ethernet are needed for seamless and stable operation of Ethernet networks service for Distribution Automation System(DAS).

Design {{has been completed}} for this new generation pulsed-power machine consisting of an azimuthal array of 24, 240 -kV Marx modules and transmission lines supplying current to the load region at the machine center. The transmission line consists of a cable header, load <b>protection</b> <b>switch,</b> and tri-plate assembly interfacing to the center transition section. The cable header interface to the Marx module provides a mechanism to remove the Marx module for maintenance without removing other components of the transmission line.

The aluminum tri-plate is a low-inductance transmission line carries radial current flow from the Marx energy storage system at the machine periphery toward the load. All transmission line components are oil insulated except the solid-dielectric insulated power flow channel connected directly to the load. The transition region at the machine center consists of several components that enable the radial converging vertical transmission lines to interface to a horizontal disk/conical power flow channel delivering current to the load. The current carrying transition components include the high-voltage and ground conductors interfacing to the tri-plate transmission lines. The tri-plate tank attachment ring interfaces to the tri-plate tanks and the base-plate. The base-plate supports the transition components and interfaces to the center support structure of the machine.

40|$|Abstract- A crowbar <b>protection</b> <b>switch</b> is {{normally}} considered {{to protect the}} power converter of doubly fed induction generator (DFIG) during grid fault. However, the crowbar protection has some adverse effects on the operation of DFIG as to deteriorate the independent controllability of real and reactive powers. This paper investigates the effect of connecting FACTS (Flexible AC Transmission System) device such as a STATCOM (Static Synchronous Compensator) {{to the point of}} common coupling (PCC) of a wind farm composed of DFIG. Simulation results in power system computer aided design/electromagnetic transient including DC (PSCAD/EMTDC) show that a FACTS device can effectively enhance the performance of the DFIG, when it is disconnected by the crowbar switch during grid fault by providing additional reactive power to the system, thus improving the voltage instability performance of the DFIG and the wind farm as well. A comparative study of stabilizing a wind farm with variable speed wind turbine generator system that use DFIG as the wind generator and FACTS was also carried out in this study. Simulation results in PSCAD/EMTDC also show that the wind farm could be effectively stabilized with both systems, but at a reduced cost with the proposed DFIG system.

40|$|The Internet is {{emerging}} as the new universal telecommunication medium. IP over WDM has been envisioned {{as one of the}} most attractive architectures for the new Internet. Consequently survivability is a crucial concern in designing IP over WDM networks. This paper presents a survey of the survivability mechanisms for IP over WDM networks and thus is intended to provide a summary of what has been done in this area and help further research. A number of optical layer protection techniques have been discussed. They are examined from the point of view of cost, complexity, and application. Survivability techniques are being made available at multiple layers of the network. This paper also studies the recovery features of each network layer and explains the impact of interaction between layers on survivability. The advantages and issues of multi-layer survivability have been identified. The main idea is that the optical layer can provide fast protection while the higher layers can provide intelligent restoration. With this idea in mind, a new scheme of carrying IP over WDM using MPLS or Multi Protocol Lambda-Switching has been discussed.

40|$|MPLS-based {{recovery}} {{is intended to}} effect rapid and complete restoration of traffic affected by a fault in an MPLS network. Two MPLS-based recovery models have been proposed: IP re-routing which establishes recovery paths on demand, and <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> which works with pre-established recovery paths. IP re-routing is robust and frugal since no resources are pre-committed but is inherently slower than <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> which is intended to offer high reliability to premium services where fault recovery {{takes place at the}} 100 ms time scale. We present a model of <b>protection</b> <b>switching</b> in MPLS networks. A variant of the flow deviation method is used to find and capacitate a set of optimal label switched paths.

The model has been verified by running transient simulations using ANSYS. The circuit was composed of a high voltage (50 Volt) pulse driver, a NMOS <b>protection</b> <b>switch</b> and a trans impedance amplifier. The IC was manufactured by AustriaMicroSystems AG, Graz, Austria, in 0. 35 μm high-voltage CMOS technology. We wire bonded the IC to a cMUT element to test the overall circuit performance.

The applied DC bias was 70 Volts. The cMUTs were driven by a 40 Volts unipolar pulse. We first performed hydrophone measurements to verify the functionality of the driver circuit. A droplet of vegetable oil was used as the propagation medium for pulse-echo measurements. The echo was observed from the air-oil interface. The results show that the performance of the circuit was consistent with the simulations. We were able to receive an echo from the surface of an oil layer of thickness less than 0. 5 mm.

40|$|For many years, it was {{generally}} understood that a. c. transmission systems could not be controlled fast enough to handle dynamic system conditions. The dynamic system problems were usually handled by over-design, which resulted in under utilisation of the system. Flexible AC Transmission System (FACTS) devices {{play an important role}} in improving the dynamic performance of a power system and hence achieve better utilisation of the available system. They are principally employed to 'rapidly' control one or more of the three main parameters directly affecting a. c. power transmission, namely the system impedance, magnitude and phase angle of the system voltage. The Voltage Source Inverter (VSI) is the basic building block of most FACTS devices. The multi-level VSI topologies are becoming the favourite power circuits for the 2 nd generation of FACTS shunt compensators. The research reported in this thesis is to investigate the reliability of Voltage Source Inverter topologies that are used in high power applications, mainly the Advanced Static VAr Compensator (ASVC). The inherent redundancy of the diode-clamped multi-level VSI topology, with respect to short-circuit and open- circuit device faults, is investigated using a space-vector nodal representation. The harmonic performance of the ASVC under normal and during 'device fault' operating conditions is also investigated. A new multi-level inverter topology is proposed to improve the robustness of the conventional diode-clamped VSI topology. Harmonic spectrum 'recovery' techniques to be utilised in the event of device failure are also investigated and discussed. An adaptive PWM controller is proposed to maintain an acceptable low order harmonic performance for the ASVC under normal and abnormal operating conditions. The results obtained show that the proposed system can maintain uninterrupted operational performance throughout certain device failure conditions. An experimental 3 -level discharge path <b>protection</b> <b>switch</b> clamped (DPPSC) VSI system has been designed, constructed and analysed. To demonstrate the 3 -level adaptive SHEM strategy, the adaptive DPPS controller was implemented on a TMS 320 F 240 DSP evaluation module (EVM). The results were in good agreement with those predicted in the analytical and simulation parts of the work. The research carried out in this work showed that under loaded operating conditions, the low frequency harmonic components targeted by SHEM techniques are not fully eliminated from the output voltage spectrum. This investigation revealed that this is due to the harmonic interaction between the a. c. and d. c. sides of the multi-level inverter. A new 'Dynamic Selective Harmonic Elimination Modulation (DSHEM) ' scheme is proposed to overcome this problem. The DSHEM dynamically adjusts the switching angles according to the system operating point. The proposed method is verified using simulation and the experimental model...|$|E
