2500|$|World of Reptiles {{has been}} an {{attraction}} at the zoo since it first opened. The building's first curator was Raymond Lee Ditmars, who had kept 45 snakes in his attic before being hired at the zoo. The exhibit is a long hall with various terrariums situated on both sides. The exhibit also features a nursery area, which exhibits newborn herptiles born at the zoo, {{as well as a}} window into the off-show breeding and caring facilities. In the building, the zoo breeds and exhibits a wide range of endangered species, including Cuban crocodile, false gharial, yellow-headed day gecko, Mary River turtle, Fly River turtle, golden coin turtle, yellow-headed box turtle, Volc√°n Darwin giant tortoise (Chelonoidis nigra microphyes), Egyptian tortoise, <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoise,</b> Panamanian golden frog, and golden poison dart frog. The building also is home to the zoo's breeding population of Kihansi spray toads, which the zoo saved from extinction. Other species held include lace monitor, northern caiman lizard, Taylor's cantil, green anaconda, eyelash palm pitviper, giant snake-necked turtle, Chiapas giant musk turtle, and Solomon Island leaf frog. On March 25, 2011, a cobra escaped from its off-show enclosure, during which time the exhibit was closed to the public. Six days later, the animal was found elsewhere in the building. The zoo named the cobra [...] "MIA" [...] (Missing In Action) and placed it on-exhibit.|$|E
2500|$|Historic Hill {{contains}} Bird House, Bird Garden, Sea Lion Sound, Herpetarium, Chain of Lakes, Flight Cage and Cypress Swamp, and Primate House. The Bird House features birds {{as varied}} as bald eagle, rhinoceros hornbill, hyacinth macaw, burrowing owl, toco toucan, Cape thick-knee, golden pheasant, kookaburra, Mariana fruit-dove, king vulture, horned guan, superb starling, tawny frogmouth, and the Guam kingfisher, which is extinct in the wild. The Bird Garden contains outdoor bird enclosures. Sea Lion Sound provides an underwater viewing tunnel of California sea lions and three harbor seals. The herpetarium houses most of the zoo's reptiles and amphibians, including the critically endangered Jamaican iguana, Chinese alligator, McCord's box turtle, Panamanian golden frog, and Arakan forest turtle. Other species include the Komodo dragon, green anaconda, mountain chicken, spotted turtle, false gharial, king cobra, Gila monster, frill-necked lizard, Aldabra giant tortoise, tuatara, reticulated python, tiger salamander, three-toed amphiuma, <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoise,</b> and over two dozen species of pit vipers from around the world. The Chain of Lakes {{is a series of}} small enclosures between the Bird House and the Herpetarium and Primate House, where the zoo's North American river otters and alligator snapping turtles reside. In 1904, the Flight Cage was the largest bird cage ever built, and {{is still one of the}} world's largest free-flight aviaries at [...] long, [...] wide, and [...] high. The Cypress Swamp is dedicated to North American birds found it the cypress swamps of the southern Mississippi River. Among the birds in the aviary are black-crowned night heron, blue-winged teal, bufflehead duck, cattle egret, double-crested cormorant, great egret, wood duck, northern bobwhite, roseate spoonbill, snowy egret, and American white ibis. Primate House is home to the zoo's monkeys and lemurs. Species included are Allen's swamp monkey, Coquerel's sifaka, golden-headed lion tamarin, black-and-white colobus monkey, lion-tailed macaque, pygmy marmoset, ring-tailed lemur, and white-faced saki.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoise</b> is {{classified}} as vulnerable on the IUCN Red List and listed on Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In 1981, Kenya banned the export of the <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoise</b> unless given written permission by the Minister for the Environment and Natural Resources. Tanzania protects this species under the Wildlife Conservation (National Game) Order, 1974, and it is protected within the Serengeti National Park. CITES quotas also {{limit the number of}} these animals that can be exported from Tanzania, although violations of these quotas are thought to occur. The European Union banned the import of the <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoise</b> in 1988, but trade with EU members continues, with several countries having reported importing the species. The <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoise</b> has been bred in captivity and is now the subject of a coordinated breeding programme in European zoos.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Large {{numbers of}} <b>pancake</b> <b>{{tortoises}}</b> (Malacochersus tornieri) and Horsfield tortoises (Testudo horsfieldii) in three consignments imported into Japan died soon after arrival. Some tortoises {{in the first}} con-signment were dead on arrival. Postmortem examination {{of two of the}} <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoises</b> and four of the Horsfield tortoises revealed necrotizing lesions of the oral mucosa in both species, primarily in the tongue. Eosinophilic to amphophilic inclusion bodies were visible in the nuclei of mucosal epithelial cells in the lesions. Similar inclusion bodies were observed in the liver, spleen, adrenal glands, stomach, lungs, kidneys, small and large intestines, pancreas, and cerebrum of the <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoises</b> and in the liver, spleen, and pancreas of the Horsfield tortoises. Electron microscopic examination of the cells containing inclusion bodies showed herpesvirus-like particles about 100 nm in diameter in the cytoplasm. Nested polymerase chain reaction analysis using a her-pesvirus consensus primer method confirmed the presence of a characteristic herpesvirus base sequence in tissue from these lesions.

5000|$|The <b>pancake</b> <b>{{tortoise}}</b> (Malacochersus tornieri [...] ) is {{a species}} of flat-shelled tortoise in the family Testudinidae. The species is native to Tanzania and Kenya. Its common name refers to the flat shape of its shell.|$|E
50|$|Most {{activity}} {{occurs during}} the morning hours or {{in the late afternoon}} and early evening. The diet primarily consists of dry grasses and vegetation. The <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoise</b> is a fast and agile climber, and is rarely found far from its rocky home so that, if disturbed, it can make a dash for the nearest rock crevice. Since this tortoise could easily be torn apart by predators, it must rely on its speed and flexibility to escape from dangerous situations, rather than withdrawing into its shell. The flexibility of its shell allows the <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoise</b> to crawl into narrow rock crevices to avoid potential predators, thus exploiting an environment that no other tortoise is capable of using.|$|E
50|$|The <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoise</b> has {{an unusually}} thin, flat, {{flexible}} shell, which {{is up to}} 17.8 cm long. While the shell bones of most other tortoises are solid, the <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoise</b> has shell bones with many openings, making it lighter and more agile than other tortoises. The carapace (top shell) is brown, frequently with a variable pattern of radiating dark lines on each scute (shell plate), helping to camouflage the tortoise in its natural dry habitat. The plastron (bottom shell) is pale yellow with dark brown seams and light yellow rays, and the head, limbs and tail are yellow-brown. Its bizarre, flattened, pancake-like profile makes this tortoise a sought-after animal in zoological and private collections, leading to its over-exploitation in the wild.|$|E
50|$|The Desert House is a {{walk-through}} glasshouse containing authentic desert {{plants such}} as cacti of various species. The animals kept in the Desert House include red-billed quelea, gila monsters, superb starlings, <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoises,</b> Guinea pigs and free-flying Princess of Wales parakeets, {{as well as a}} real termite mound.|$|R
25|$|Dublin Zoo's Reptile House {{was opened}} in 1876. It {{features}} reptiles such as West African crocodiles, Gila monsters, veiled chameleons, <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoises,</b> leopard tortoises, plated lizards, Bell's hinge-back tortoises, Burmese pythons, Asian leaf turtles, Asian water monitors and East African black mud turtles, {{as well as}} invertebrates such as Macleay's spectres and Chilean rose tarantulas.|$|R
50|$|Animal Avenue, a children's zoo expansion, {{includes}} meerkats, ring-tailed lemurs, {{black and}} white ruffed lemurs, black lemurs, Damaraland mole rats, Antilles pink-toed tree spiders, emerald tree boas, green tree pythons, western Bell's hinge-back <b>tortoises,</b> <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoises,</b> ornate horned frogs, White's tree frogs, hourglass tree frogs, long-legged desert ants, emperor scorpions, Madagascar hissing cockroachs, African cichlids and budgies.|$|R
50|$|The {{greatest}} threats {{facing the}} <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoise</b> are habitat destruction and its over-exploitation by the pet trade. Given the low reproductive rate of this tortoise, populations {{that have been}} harvested may {{take a long time}} to recover. Commercial development diminishes the amount of suitable habitat for pancake tortoises, which already is neither common nor extensive. Tortoises in Kenya are threatened by clearance of thorn scrub for conversion to agriculture and in Tanzania by over-grazing of goats and cattle.|$|E

50|$|The Trionychidae are a taxonomic {{family of}} a number of turtle genera {{commonly}} known as softshells. They are also sometimes called pancake turtles (although they are distinct from the <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoise).</b> Softshells include some of the world's largest freshwater turtles, though many can adapt to living in highly brackish areas. Members of this family occur in Africa, Asia, and North America. North American members of genus Trionyx were fairly recently (1987) assigned the resurrected genus name Apalone by Meylan, though they are still listed semicorrectly as Trionyx in some texts.|$|E
50|$|Monkey Trails showcases {{monkeys and}} other animals from the rainforests of Asia and Africa. Opened in 2005, it {{replaced}} an older exhibit known as the Monkey Yard. Monkey Trails is home primarily to monkeys such as guenons, mangabeys, and mandrills, but it also showcases many other species of animals, such as yellow-backed duikers. Pygmy hippos, slender-snouted crocodiles, and many species of turtles and fish {{can be seen in}} a series of water/land exhibits all with underwater viewing areas. In smaller exhibits are many reptiles and amphibians such as <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoises,</b> and many species of arthropods such as Madagascar hissing cockroaches. Monkey Trails utilizes a new method of displaying arboreal animals‚Äîby climbing up an elevated walkway throughout the exhibit. Some of the horticultural highlights in Monkey Trails include a ficus tree, cycads, and a bog garden.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pancake</b> <b>tortoises</b> live in {{isolated}} colonies, with many individuals {{sharing the same}} kopje, or even crevice. Males fight for access to females during the mating season, in January and February, with large males tending {{to get the most}} chances to mate. Nesting in the wild seems to occur in July and August, although clutches are produced year-round in captivity. The female digs a nest cavity about 7.5 to 10 cm deep in loose, sandy soil. Usually only one egg is laid at a time, but a female can lay multiple eggs {{over the course of a}} single season, with eggs appearing every four to eight weeks. In captivity, the incubation of the eggs lasts from four to six months, and young are independent as soon as they hatch. Wild and captive specimens often bask and, although they do not appear to hibernate, there are reports that they may aestivate beneath flat rocks during the hottest months.|$|R
50|$|The {{shape of}} the shell gives helpful clues about how a turtle lives. Most {{tortoises}} have a large, dome-shaped shell {{that makes it difficult}} for predators to crush the shell between their jaws. One of the few exceptions is the African <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoise,</b> which has a flat, flexible shell that allows it to hide in rock crevices. Most aquatic turtles have flat, streamlined shells, which aid in swimming and diving. American snapping turtles and musk turtles have small, cross-shaped plastrons that give them more efficient leg movement for walking along the bottom of ponds and streams.|$|E
5000|$|Containing {{many animals}} {{previously}} kept in Pets' Corner, this area opened in 2009 and contains many exotic and familiar mammals, birds, reptiles and insects. There are small areas for striped skunk, ferrets, chickens, guinea pigs, cockatoos, Indian runner ducks, Hermann's tortoises, <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoise,</b> spur-thighed tortoise, iguanas, armadillos, rock hyraxes, and a fennec fox. An undercover area houses a regular Parrot show, where keepers demonstrate {{the intelligence of}} the resident macaws. Next door is a walk-through butterfly house, home to a large variety of the species, which replaced an older butterfly house built in the 1980s. Inside the main building is the Animal Handling Hall, where visitors can {{get a chance to}} hold a variety of creatures such as a Chilean rose tarantula or a corn snake, or even get up close to a selection of reptiles.

40|$|Abstract. Bacteria of {{the genus}} Helicobacter are {{associated}} with disease in humans and animals. Reports of infection in reptiles are very limited. In the present study, pathological findings and molecular characterization are reported for a Helicobacter species associated with septicemia in a <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoise</b> (Malacochersus tornieri). Disseminated infection resulted in regional cellulitis and edema {{of the head and}} neck, and pericarditis. Spiral bacteria were identified in cytological preparations and Warthin‚ÄìStarry-stained sections of pathological lesions. Amplification of partial sequence of the 16 S ribosomal gene using polymerase chain reaction identified the organism as Helicobacter and suggest that it is a novel species...|$|E

Similar degrees of variation have not yet been described in any other extant turtle species and therefore seem notable in M. tornieri, and might be related to the species‚Äô unique lifestyle. Within the carapace, the peripherals and suprapygals are most variable in number. Furthermore, different combinations of peripherals are participating in the central plastral fontanelle and in some individuals additional bones take part {{in the formation of the}} plastron...|$|E
40|$|In the USA and in Hungary, almost simultaneously, adenoviruses of a {{putative}} novel lineage {{were detected}} by PCR and sequencing in turtles belonging to four different species (including two subspecies) of the superfamily Testudinoidea. In the USA, partial {{sequence of the}} adenoviral DNA-dependent DNA polymerase was obtained from samples of a captive <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoise</b> (Malacochersus tornieri), four eastern box turtles (Terrapene carolina carolina) and two red-eared sliders (Trachemys scripta elegans). In Hungary, several individuals of the latter subspecies {{as well as some}} yellow-bellied sliders (T. s. scripta) were found to harbor identical, or closely related, putative new adenoviruses. From numerous attempts to amplify any other genomic fragment by PCR, only a nested method was successful, in which a 476 -bp fragment of the hexon gene could be obtained from several samples. In phylogeny reconstructions, based on either DNA polymerase or hexon partial sequences, the putative new adenoviruses formed a clade distinct from the five accepted genera of the family Adenoviridae. Three viral sub-clades corresponding to the three host genera (Malacochersus, Terrapene, Trachemys) were observed. Attempts to isolate the new adenoviruses on turtle heart (TH- 1) cells were unsuccessful. Targeted PCR screening of live and dead specimens revealed a prevalence of approximately 25...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Cryptosporidiosis {{affects the}} {{gastrointestinal}} and respiratory tract of humans {{as well as}} {{of a wide range of}} companion, farm, laboratory and wild animals. In the past few years, three independent studies have provided strong evidence for the existence of a distinct Cryptosporidium species affecting tortoises and likely circulating in other reptile species as well. A new Cryptosporidium genotype was firstly detected and genetically characterized in a marginated tortoise in Italy in 2007 and named Cryptosporidium sp. ex Testudo marginata CrIT- 20. The phylogenetic analysis of this isolate indicated that this Cryptosporidium was unique and belonged to the intestinal clade. These findings were later on confirmed by the detection of genetic homologies of isolates from a python and a chameleon from Spain and by recent research in the United States. The latter study presented both the occurrence of intestinal lesions in a <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoise</b> and a Russian tortoise and the genetic characterization of the isolates, together with the first pictures of the endogenous stages of Cryptosporidium CrIT- 20. Phylogenetic inference based on the sequences representing small subunit of the nuclear ribosomal RNA gene (SSU) of these isolates confirmed the pathological findings because this Cryptosporidium was related to the intestinal group and supported previous results in T. marginata from Italy. The present scientific data on the Cryptosporidium CrIT- 20 support its classification as a new species of Cryptosporidium causing intestinal diseases in tortoises. Although further morphological (i. e. exogenous stages) and biological aspects (i. e. complete host range) are yet to be elucidated, it is proposed that this Cryptosporidium is designated Cryptosporidium ducismarci. </p...|$|E
40|$|As part of {{an ongoing}} project to {{generate}} a mitochondrial database for terrestrial tortoises based on museum specimens, the complete mitochondrial genome sequences of 10 species and a {approx} 14 kb sequence from an eleventh species are reported. The sampling of the present study emphasizes Mediterranean tortoises (genus Testudo and their close relatives). Our new sequences are aligned, along with those of two testudinoid turtles from GenBank, Chrysemys picta and Mauremys reevesii, yielding an alignment of 14, 858 positions, of which 3, 238 are parsimony informative. We develop a phylogenetic taxonomy for Testudo and related species based on well-supported, diagnosable clades. Several well-supported nodes are recovered, including the monophyly of a restricted Testudo, T. kleinmanni + T. marginata (the Chersus clade), and the placement of the enigmatic African <b>pancake</b> <b>tortoise</b> (Malacochersustornieri) within the predominantly Palearctic greater Testudo group (Testudona tax. nov.). Despite the large amount of sequence reported, there is low statistical support for some nodes within Testudona and Sowe do not propose names for those groups. A preliminary and conservative estimation of divergence times implies a late Miocene diversification for the testudonan clade (6 - 12 million years ago), matching their first appearance in the fossil record. The multi-continental distribution of testudonan turtles {{can be explained by the}} establishment of permanent connections between Europe, Africa, and Asia at this time. The arrival of testudonan turtles to Africa occurred after one or more initial tortoise invasions gave rise to the diverse (> 25 species) 'Geochelone complex. 'Two unusual genomic features are reported for the mtDNA of one tortoise, M. tornieri: (1) nad 4 has a shift of reading frame that we suggest is resolved by translational frameshifting of the mRNA on the ribosome during protein synthesis and (2) there are two copies of the control region and trnF, with the latter having experienced multiple nucleotide substitutions in a pattern suggesting that each is being maintained by selection...|$|E
