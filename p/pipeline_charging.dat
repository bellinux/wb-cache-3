50|$|Federal {{regulations}} {{at first}} included only the rates interstate <b>pipelines</b> <b>charged</b> to carry gas. When {{the market price}} of natural gas at the wellhead increased in the 1950s, gas utilities complained that the gas producers should be regulated as well. In 1954, the US Supreme Court ruled in Phillips Petroleum Co. v. Wisconsin that regulation of the wellhead price was within {{the intent of the}} Natural Gas Act of 1938 to control prices to utilities, and therefore the federal government could control wellhead prices of any natural gas going into an interstate pipeline.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} dynamic {{relationship}} between oil futures and spot markets and tanker freight rates across two major tanker routes. In particular, {{we examine the}} validity of the cost of carry relationship in the WTI futures market, which suggests that the difference between physical and futures crude oil prices should reflect the transportation costs. We also examine whether the futures-physical oil differential contains information regarding tanker freight rate formation. Using physical crude oil prices for the Brent and Bonny markets, WTI futures prices and freight rates we find no evidence to support the existence of a relationship between tanker freight rates and physical-futures differentials in the crude oil market. This is mainly attributed to regional supply and demand imbalances and suggests that arbitrage opportunities between oil derivatives and tanker freight markets exist. Simulated trading strategies reveal the existence of excess profits, which are robust to variations in transaction costs, <b>pipeline</b> <b>charges</b> and timing of initiation of arbitrage.

Trigger regions consist of 28 * 16 crystals, inter-connected via analogue signals generated on front-end cards and transmitted to Trigger Region Units (TRU) which digitize and process the analogue hit information. Eight TRU cards are embedded inside each PHOS module in water-cooled cassettes, each inserted between a block 14 FEE readout cards. Analogue sums are generated by fast summing shapers, with their outputs connected to the TRU via equal-length differential cables.

40|$|As in many {{regulated}} industries, {{jurisdiction of}} the commission regulating the natural gas pipelines does not encompass all transactions of the regulated companies. The Federal Power Commission does not regulate direct sales of the pipelines to industry, while it does set profit limits on sales to retail gas utilities companies. If regulation is effective, the prices on the regulated sales should be different from those on the unregulated industrial transactions, all else being equal.

40|$|To recycle the {{vibration}} energy of vehicles over rough roads, a hydraulic-electricity energy regenerative suspension (HEERS) was {{designed in the}} present work, and simulations were performed with focus on its performance. On {{the basis of the}} system principle, the mathematical model of hydraulic-electrical energy regenerative absorber (HEERA) and two degrees of freedom (DOF) suspension dynamic model were constructed. Using the model of HEERA, simulations on force-displacement and force-velocity characteristics were performed with a 1. 67 Hz frequency and a sinusoidal input adopted. And then in combination with HEERA model and two DOF suspension models, simulations on the performance of HEERS also were carried out. Finally, the influences of charging pressure and volume of the accumulator, hydraulic motor displacement, orifice area of check valve, and inner diameter of hydraulic pipelines on the performance of HEERA and HEERS were investigated in depth. The simulation results indicated that (i) the damping characteristic of HEERA was coincident with the damping characteristics of traditional absorber; (ii) the most remarkable influencing factor on the performance of HEERS was the hydraulic motor displacement, followed by orifice area of check valve, inner diameter of <b>pipelines,</b> and <b>charging</b> pressure of accumulator, while the effects of charging volume of accumulator were quite limited...|$|R
40|$|Telecommunication data {{is being}} used {{increasingly}} in urban mobility applications around the world. Despite its ubiquity and usefulness, technical difficulties arise when using Packet-Switched Charging Data Records (CDR), since its main purpose was not intended {{for this kind of}} applications. Due to its particular nature, a trade-off must be considered between accessibility and time accuracy when using this data. On the one hand, to obtain highly accurate timestamps, huge amounts of network-level CDR must be extracted and stored. This task is very difficult and expensive since highly critical network node applications can be compromised in the data extraction and storage. On the other hand, post-mediation CDR can be easily accessed since no network node application is involved in its analysis. The pay-off is in the lower accurate timestamps recorded, since several aggregations and filtering is performed in previous steps of the <b>charging</b> <b>pipelines.</b> In this work, {{a detailed description of the}} timestamp error problem using post-mediation CDR is presented, together with a methodology to analyze error time series collected in each network cell.

40|$|Electrical charge {{tomography}} (EChT) is a non-invasive {{imaging technique}} that is aimed {{to reconstruct the}} image of materials being conveyed based on data measured by an electrodynamics sensor installed around the pipe. Image reconstruction in electrical charge tomography is vital {{and has not been}} widely studied before. Three methods have been introduced before, namely the linear back projection method, the filtered back projection method and the least square method. These methods normally face ill-posed problems and their solutions are unstable and inaccurate.

40|$|The {{proliferation}} of portable communication devices {{combined with the}} relentless demand for higher data rates has spurred the development of wireless communication standards which can support wide signal bandwidths. Benefits of the {{complementary metal oxide semiconductor}} (CMOS) process such as high device speeds and low manufacturing cost have rendered it the technology of choice for implementing wideband wireless transceiver integrated circuits (ICs). This dissertation addresses the key challenges encountered in the design of wideband wireless transceiver ICs. It is divided into two parts. Part I describes the design of crucial circuit blocks such as a highly selective wideband radio frequency (RF) front-end and an on-chip test module which are typically found in wireless receivers. The design of high-speed, capacitive DACs for wireless transmitters is included in Part II. The first work in Part I is the design and implementation of a wideband RF frontend in 65 -nm CMOS. To achieve blocker rejection comparable to surface-acousticwave (SAW) filters, the highly selective and tunable RF receiver utilizes impedance transformation filtering along with a two-stage architecture. It is well known that the low-noise amplifier (LNA) which forms the first front-end stage largely decides the receiver performance in terms of noise figure (NF) and linearity (IIP 3 /P 1 dB). The proposed LNA uses double cross-coupling technique to reduce NF while complementary derivative superposition (DS) and resistive feedback are employed to achieve high linearity. The resistive feedback also enhances input matching. In measurements, the front-end achieves performance comparable to SAW filters with blocker rejection greater than 38 dB, NF 3. 2 ‚Äì 5. 2 dB, out-of-band IIP 3 > + 17 dBm and blocker P 1 dB > + 5 dBm over a frequency range of 0. 5 ‚Äì 3 GHz. The second work in Part I is the design of an RF amplitude detector for on-chip test. As the complexity of RF ICs continues to grow, the task of testing and debugging them becomes increasingly challenging. The degradation in performance or the drift from the optimal operation points may cause systems to fail. To prevent this effect and ensure acceptable performance in the presence of process, voltage and temperature variations (PVT), test and calibration of the RF ICs become indispensable. A wideband, high dynamic range RF amplitude detector design aimed at on-chip test is proposed. Gain-boosting and sub-ranging techniques are applied to the detection circuit to increase the gain over the full range of input amplitudes without compromising the input impedance. A technique suitable for on-chip third/second-order intercept¬† point (IP 3 /IP 2) test by embedded RF detectors is also introduced. Part II comprises the design and analysis of high-speed switched-capacitor (SC) DACs for 60 -GHz radio transmitters. The digital-to-analog converter (DAC) is one of the fundamental building blocks of transmitters. SC DACs offer several advantages over the current-steering DAC architecture. Specifically, lower capacitor mismatch helps the SC DAC to achieve higher linearity. The switches in the SC DAC are realized by MOS transistors in the triode region which substantially relaxes the voltage headroom requirement. Consequently, SC DACs can be implemented using lower supply voltages in advanced CMOS process nodes compared to their currentsteering counterparts. The first work in Part II analyzes the factors limiting the performance of capacitive pipeline DACs. It is shown that the DAC performance is¬† limited mainly by the clock feed-through and settling effects in the SC¬† arrays while the impact of capacitor mismatch and kT/C noise are found to be negligible. Based on this analysis, the second work in Part II proposes the split-segmented SC array DAC to overcome the clock feed-through problem since this topology eliminates <b>pipelined</b> <b>charge</b> propagation. Implemented in 65 -nm CMOS, the 12 -bit SC DAC achieves a Spurious Free Dynamic Range (SFDR) greater than 44 dB within the input signal bandwidth (BW) of 1 GHz with on-chip memory embedded for digital data generation. Power dissipation is 50 mW from 1. 2 V supply. Similar performance is achieved with a lower supply voltage (0. 9 V) which shows the scalability of the SC DAC for more advanced CMOS technologies. Furthermore, the proposed SC DAC satisfies the spectral mask of the IEEE 802. 11 ad WiGig standard with a second-order reconstruction filter and hence it can be used for the 60 -GHz radio baseband...|$|R

40|$|The European Space Agency's Gaia {{mission is}} {{scheduled}} for launch in 2013. It will operate at L 2 for 5 years, rotating slowly to scan the sky so that its two optical telescopes will repeatedly observe more than one billion stars. The resulting data set will be iteratively reduced to solve for the position, parallax and proper motion of every observed star. The focal plane contains 106 large area silicon CCDs continuously operating in a mode where the line transfer rate and the satellite rotation are in synchronisation. One {{of the greatest challenges}} facing the mission is radiation damage to the CCDs which will cause charge deferral and image shape distortion. This is particularly important because of the extreme accuracy requirements of the mission. Despite steps taken at hardware level to minimise the effects of radiation, the residual distortion will need to be calibrated during the pipeline data processing. Due to the volume and inhomogeneity of data involved, this requires a model which describes the effects of the radiation damage which is physically realistic, yet fast enough to implement in the <b>pipeline.</b> The resulting <b>charge</b> distortion model was developed specifically for the Gaia CCD operating mode. However, a generalised version is presented in this paper and this has already been applied in a broader context, for example to investigate the impact of radiation damage on the Euclid dark-energy mission data.
