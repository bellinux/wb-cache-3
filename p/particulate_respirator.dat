50|$|An {{occupational}} exposure limit (OEL) is an upper limit on the acceptable concentration of a hazardous substance in workplace air. As of 2016, quantitative OELs have not been determined for most nanomaterials. The U.S. National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health has determined non-regulatory recommended exposure limits (RELs) of 1.0 μg/m3 for carbon nanotubes and carbon nanofibers as background-corrected elemental carbon as an 8-hour time-weighted average (TWA) respirable mass concentration, and 300 μg/m3 for ultrafine titanium dioxide as TWA concentrations for up to 10 hr/day during a 40-hour work week. A properly tested, half-face <b>particulate</b> <b>respirator</b> will provide protection at exposure concentrations 10 times the REL, while an elastomeric full facepiece respirator with P100 filters will provide protection at 50 times the REL. Agencies and organizations from other countries, including the British Standards Institute and the Institute for Occupational Safety and Health in Germany, have established OELs for some nanomaterials, and some companies have supplied OELs for their products.|$|E
50|$|Ventilation System: A {{system of}} local and/or general exhaust is {{recommended}} to keep employee exposures {{as low as}} possible. Local exhaust ventilation is generally preferred because it can control the emissions of the contaminant at its source, preventing dispersion of it into the general work area. Please refer to the ACGIH document, Industrial Ventilation, A Manual of Recommended Practices, most recent edition, for details. Personal Respirators (NIOSH Approved): For conditions of use where exposure to dust or mist is apparent and engineering controls are not feasible, a <b>particulate</b> <b>respirator</b> (NIOSH type N95 or better filters) may be worn. If oil particles (e.g. lubricants, cutting fluids, glycerine, etc.) are present, use a NIOSH type R or P filter. For emergencies or instances where the exposure levels are not known, use a full-face positive-pressure, air-supplied respirator.Skin Protection: Not required.Eye Protection: Not required. Optionally use chemical safety goggles where dusting or splashing of solutions is possible.|$|E

50|$|Respirators {{serve to}} protect the user from {{breathing}} in contaminants in the air, thus preserving the health of one's respiratory tract. There are two main types of respirators. One type functions by filtering out chemicals and gases, or airborne particles, from the air breathed by the user. The filtration may be either passive or active (powered). Gas masks and <b>particulate</b> <b>respirators</b> are examples {{of this type of}} respirator. A second type protects users by providing clean, respirable air from another source. This type includes airline respirators and self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA). In work environments, respirators are relied upon when adequate ventilation is not available or other engineering control systems are not feasible or inadequate.|$|R

40|$|Recent {{guidelines}} {{recommend the}} use by healthcare personnel of a fit-tested N 95 <b>particulate</b> <b>respirator</b> or higher-grade respiratory precaution {{in a patient}} undergoing bronchoscopy when pulmonary tuberculosis (PTB) is suspected. However, PTB may be unexpectedly diagnosed in this setting and therefore not evaluated, resulting in the unexpected exposure to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) of healthcare workers in the bronchoscopy suite. Here, we examined the incidence of unexpected exposure to MTB during flexible bronchoscopy and determined the exposure-related factors. Between 2011 and 2013, a retrospective {{study was conducted to}} evaluate unexpected diagnoses of PTB in the bronchoscopy suite. During the study period, 1650 consecutive patients for whom previous CT scans were available and who underwent bronchoscopy for respiratory disease other than PTB were included. The results of bronchial washing, bronchoalveolar lavage, and post-bronchoscopic sputum were reviewed. PTB was unexpectedly diagnosed in 76 patients (4. 6 %). The presence of anthracofibrosis [odds ratio (OR), 3. 878; 95 % confidence interval (CI), 1. 291 - 11. 650; P = 0. 016), bronchiectasis (OR, 1. 974; 95 % CI, 1. 095 - 3. 557; P = 0. 024), or atelectasis (OR, 1. 740; 95 % CI, 1. 010 - 2. 903; P = 0. 046) as seen on chest CT scan was independently associated with unexpected PTB. Patients with both anthracofibrosis and atelectasis were at much higher risk of unexpected PTB (OR, 4. 606; 95 % CI, 1. 383 - 15. 342; P = 0. 013). The risk of MTB exposure by healthcare personnel in the bronchoscopy suite due to patients with undiagnosed PTB has been underestimated. Therefore, in geographic regions with an intermediate PTB prevalence, such as South Korea (97 / 100, 000 persons per year), higher-grade respiratory precaution, such as a fit-tested N 95 <b>particulate</b> <b>respirator,</b> should be considered to prevent occupational exposure to MTB during routine bronchoscopy, especially in patients with CT-confirmed anthracofibrosis, bronchiectasis, or atelectasis...|$|E

40|$|National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health {{recommends}} {{the use of}} particulate res-pirators for protection against nanoparticles (< 100 nm size). Protection afforded by a filtering facepiece <b>particulate</b> <b>respirator</b> {{is a function of}} the filter efficiency and the leakage through the face-to-facepiece seal. The combination of particle penetration through filter media and par-ticle leakage through face seal and any component interfaces is considered as total inward leakage (TIL). Although the mechanisms and extent of nanoparticle penetration through filter media have been well documented, information concerning nanoparticle leakage through face seal is lacking. A previous study in our laboratory measured filter penetration and TIL for spe-cific size particles. The results showed higher filter penetration and TIL for 50 nm size par-ticles, i. e. the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) than for 8 and 400 nm size particles. To better understand the significance of particle penetration through filter media and through face seal leakage, this study was expanded to measure filter penetration at sealed condition and TIL with artificially introduced leaks for 20 – 800 nm particles at 8 – 40 l minute volumes for four N 95 models of filtering facepiece respirators (FFRs) using a breathing manikin.

40|$|A {{pamphlet}} {{providing information}} on how to prevent occupational silicosis was presented. The pamphlet, which was published by NIOSH and the United States Department of Labor, provided guidelines for both employers and workers to reduce exposures to crystalline silica (14808607) dust and summarized the properties and sources of exposure to silica dust and OSHA and Mine Safety and Health Administration (MSHA) regulations for controlling occupational silica dust exposures. Recommendations that employers can take include making a commitment to prevent silicosis at the worksite. This involves complying with OSHA and MSHA regulations regarding silica exposure, performing air monitoring at the worksite, maintaining engineering controls, substituting less hazardous materials for silica for abrasive blasting operations, and supplying vacuums with high efficiency particulate air filters. Strategies to improve worker health include training them about the health effects of silica, establishing a written respirator program, providing medical evaluations for employees potentially exposed to silica, reporting all silicosis cases to state health departments and the MSHA and recording cases on OSHA logs, and posting warning signs to identify work areas where respirable silica is present. Actions that workers can take to protect themselves include cooperating with their employers to prevent silicosis at the worksite, use of engineering controls installed by the employer for reducing silica dust levels, minimizing dust exposures by following good work and housekeeping practices, wearing, maintaining, and correctly using approved <b>particulate</b> <b>respirators</b> when engineering controls alone cannot reduce silica exposures below permissible levels, using positive pressure abrasive blasting respirators if and when sandblasting is performed, participating in all air monitoring, medical surveillance, and training programs, and talking with the employer, employee representative, or union if concerned about the presence of dust in the workplace.

40|$|Abstract Background Urban air {{pollution}} {{is an increasing}} health problem, particularly in Asia, where the combustion of fossil fuels has increased rapidly {{as a result of}} industrialization and socio-economic development. The adverse health impacts of urban {{air pollution}} are well established, but less is known about effective intervention strategies. In this demonstration study we set out to establish methods to assess whether wearing an R 95 activated carbon respirator could reduce intake of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) in street workers in Hanoi, Vietnam. Methods In this demonstration study we performed a cross-over study in which non-smoking participants that worked at least 4 hours per day on the street in Hanoi were randomly allocated to specific respirator wearing sequences for a duration of 2 weeks. Urines were collected after each period, i. e. twice per week, {{at the end of the}} working day to measure hydroxy PAHs (OH-PAH) using gas chromatography/high resolution mass spectrometry. The primary endpoint was the urinary concentration of 1 -hydroxypyrene (1 -OHP). Results Forty-four participants (54. 5 % male, median age 40 years) were enrolled with the majority being motorbike taxi drivers (38. 6 %) or street vendors (34. 1 %). The baseline creatinine corrected urinary level for 1 -OHP was much higher than other international comparisons: 1020 ng/g creatinine (IQR: 604 – 1551). Wearing a R 95 mask had no significant effect on 1 -OHP levels: estimated multiplicative effect 1. 0 (95 % CI: 0. 92 - 1. 09) or other OH-PAHs, except 1 -hydroxynaphthalene (1 -OHN) : 0. 86 (95 % CI: 0. 11 - 0. 96). Conclusions High levels of urine OH-PAHs were found in Hanoi street workers. No effect was seen on urine OH-PAH levels by wearing R 95 <b>particulate</b> <b>respirators</b> in an area of high urban air pollution, except for 1 -OHN. A lack of effect may be de to gaseous phase PAHs that were not filtered efficiently by the respirator. The high levels of urinary OH-PAHs found, urges for effective interventions.

40|$|A {{shortage}} of disposable filtering facepiece respirators {{can be expected}} during a pandemic re-spiratory infection such as influenza A. Some individuals may want to use common fabric ma-terials for respiratory protection because of shortage or affordability reasons. To address the filtration performance of common fabric materials against nano-size particles including vi-ruses, five major categories of fabric materials including sweatshirts, T-shirts, towels, scarves, and cloth masks were tested for polydisperse and monodisperse aerosols (20 – 1000 nm) at two different face velocities (5. 5 and 16. 5 cm s 21) and compared with the penetration levels for N 95 respirator filter media. The results showed that cloth masks and other fabric materials tested in the study had 40 – 90 % instantaneous penetration levels against polydisperse NaCl aerosols em-ployed in the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health <b>particulate</b> <b>respirator</b> test protocol at 5. 5 cm s 21. Similarly, varying levels of penetrations (9 – 98 %) were obtained for dif-ferent size monodisperse NaCl aerosol particles in the 20 – 1000 nm range.

40|$|Field {{qualitative}} fit {{tests were}} conducted at 10 separate companies in the Northwest of England to determine the proportion of leaking respirators in a cross-section of pharmaceutical manufacturing industries. The 3 M FT- 10 Qualitative Fit Test Apparatus {{was used to test}} a total of 211 half-face <b>particulate</b> <b>respirator</b> wearers. Participants wore their own respirators and were asked to don them as they would normally. In all cases, no specific intervention had occurred prior to testing. Results indicated a failure rate of 69 % (of the 211 subjects tested, 145 respirators were leaking). Successful results were not associated with the frequency of use (p = 0. 71) or years of experience wearing respirators (p = 0. 59). Similarly, successful results were not associated with respirator training in the current job (p = 0. 38) or training in previous jobs (p = 0. 49). Leakage was not consistent across the 10 companies, with two companies exhibiting a 100 % failure rate while another company had 26 successful tests in 50 wearers (52 % pass rate).

40|$|Respiratory {{protection}} {{provided by}} a <b>particulate</b> <b>respirator</b> {{is a function of}} particle penetration through filter media and through faceseal leakage. Faceseal leakage largely contributes to the penetration of particles through a respirator and compromises protection. When faceseal leaks arise, filter penetration is assumed to be negligible. The contribution of filter penetration and faceseal leakage to total inward leakage (TIL) of submicron-size bioaerosols is not well studied. To address this issue, TIL values for two N 95 filtering facepiece respirator (FFR) models and two surgical mask (SM) models sealed to a manikin were measured at 8 L and 40 L breathing minute volumes with different artificial leak sizes. TIL values for different size (20 - 80020 nm, electrical mobility diameter) NaCl particles representing submicron-size bioaerosols were measured using a scanning mobility particle sizer. Efficiency of filtering devices was assessed by measuring the penetration against NaCl aerosol similar to the method used for NIOSH particulate filter certification. Results showed that the most penetrating particle size (MPPS) was 22 ̆c 64520 nm for both N 95 FFR models and one of the two SM models, and 22 ̆c 635020 nm for the other SM model at sealed condition with no leaks as well as with different leak sizes. TIL values increased with increasing leak sizes and breathing minute volumes. Relatively, higher efficiency N 95 and SM models showed lower TIL values. Filter efficiency of FFRs and SMs influenced the TIL at different flow rates and leak sizes. Overall, the data indicate that good fitting higher-efficiency FFRs may offer higher protection against submicron-size bioaerosols.

40|$|Keene State College has a {{voluntary}} use policy {{with respect to}} respiratory protection. This means there are no known job tasks where Permissible Exposure Limits (PELs) are exceeded 1. However, if an employee chooses to wear a respirator the College will provide the employee with a respirator for their comfort in accordance with this policy. The following procedures must be followed {{if you choose to}} wear a respirator. Respirators A respirator is a device that protects you from inhaling dangerous substances, such as chemicals and infectious particles. Selecting the right respirator requires an assessment of all the workplace operations, processes or environments that may create a respiratory hazard. There are four main types of respirators: Particulate Respirators only protect against particles (e. g., dust). They do not protect against chemicals, gases, or vapors, and are intended only for low hazard levels. The “N- 95 ” filtering facepiece 2 respirator or “dust mask ” is one type of <b>particulate</b> <b>respirator.</b> Particulate respirators filter out dusts, fumes, and mists, are usually disposable dust masks or respirators with disposable filters, and must be replaced when they become discolored, damaged, or clogged. Chemical Cartridge/Gas Mask Respirators filter or clean chemical gases out of the air as you breathe. This respirator includes a facepiece or mask, a replaceable cartridge or canister to remove the contaminant, and may require more than one cartridge to protect against multiple hazards. They are color coded, {{depending on the type of}} chemical hazard. It is very important to choose the correct type of cartridge to protect you from the chemical hazard you may be exposed to. Powered Air-Purifying Respirators (PAPR) use a fan to draw air through the filter to the user. They use the same type of filters/cartridges as other respirators, but they are easier to breathe through. Self-Contained Breathing Apparatus (SCBA) use their own air tank to supply clean air, so you don’t need to worry about filters. They are commonly used by firefighters and require special training and provide clean air when the air round you is simply too dangerous to breathe. If you do not use a respirator correctly, it is very likely that it will not adequately protect you and may even hurt you...|$|E
