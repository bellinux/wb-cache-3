25|$|The {{roots of}} {{traditional}} Qajar painting {{can be found}} in the style of painting that arose during the preceding Safavid empire. During this time, there was a great deal of European influence on Persian culture, especially in the arts of the royalty and noble classes. European art was undergoing a period of realism and this can be seen in the depiction of objects especially by Qajar artists. The European influence is very well evidenced in the preëminent position and prestige of oil painting. While oil paintings had been <b>par</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> during previous periods of Persian art, it was the influence of the European masters, like Rubens and Rembrandt, the true masters of oil portraiture, that raised it to the highest level. Heavy application of paint and dark, rich, saturated colors are elements of Qajar painting that owe their influences directly to the European style.|$|E

The lyrics are <b>par</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>course</b> on this lineup of overwhelmingly melancholy compositions. Still, it's well-executed music, and it's an ideal soundtrack for life's moodier moments." [...] Jon Dolan {{of the magazine}} Entertainment Weekly found the song to be a [...] "bruising breakup lament that turns into an anthem of freedom." [...] Giving the song a negative review, Alex Nun of musicOMH wrote that [...] "Sweet Sacrifice" [...] was [...] "a turgid attempt to recapture past glories, the heard-before riffs and shockingly average vocals act as a slap from the proverbial wet fish." [...] The song was nominated for Best Hard Rock Performance at the 50th Grammy Awards.|$|E

2500|$|Richards' {{keynote address}} to the 1988 Democratic National Convention {{put her in the}} {{national}} spotlight. The speech was highly critical of the Reagan Administration and then-Vice President George H. W. Bush. Her address was notable for including several humorous remarks displaying her down-home Texas charm such as: [...] "I'm delighted to be here with you this evening, because after listening to George Bush all these years, I figured you needed to know what a real Texas accent sounds like", [...] "Poor George, he can't help it. He was born with a silver foot in his mouth", [...] "…two women in 160 years is about <b>par</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>course.</b> But if you give us a chance, we can perform. After all, Ginger Rogers did everything that Fred Astaire did. She just did it backwards and in high heels." [...] and [...] "When we pay billions for planes that won't fly, billions for tanks that won't fire, and billions for systems that won't work, that old dog won't hunt. And you don't have to be from Waco to know that when the Pentagon makes crooks rich and doesn't make America strong, that it's a bum deal." [...] Richards' convention address has been cited by rhetorical experts as a historically significant speech.|$|E

50|$|The 36-hole cut was 149 (+7), {{and only}} 63 players {{advanced}} to the third round.
