40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effect of temperature and air pollutants on total mortality in summers in Sydney, Australia. Daily data on weather variables, mortality and air pollution for the Sydney metropolitan area from 1 January 1994 to 31 December 2004 were supplied by Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Australian Bureau of Statistics, and Environment Protection Agency of New South Wales, respectively. We examined the association of total mortality with weather indicators and air pollution using generalised additive models (GAMs). A time-series {{classification and regression tree}} (CART) model was developed to explore the interaction effects of temperature and air pollution that impacted on mortality. Our results show that the average increase in total daily mortality was 0. 9 % [95 % confidence interval (CI) : 0. 6 – 1. 3 %] and 22 % (95 % CI: 6. 4 – 40. 5 %) for a 1 °C increase in daily maximum temperature and 1 <b>part</b> <b>per</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> (pphm) increase in daily average concentration of sulphur dioxide (SO 2), respectively. Time-series CART results show that maximum temperature and SO 2 on the current day had significant interaction effects on total mortality. There were 7. 3 % and 12. 1 % increases in daily average mortality when maximum temperature was over 32 °C and mean SO 2 exceeded 0. 315 pphm, respectively. Daily maximum temperature was statistically significantly associated with daily deaths in Sydney during summers between 1994 and 2004. Elevated daily maximum temperature combined with high SO 2 concentrations appeared to have contributed to the increased mortality observed in Sydney during this period...|$|E

40|$|Short-term {{effects of}} ozone (O 3) on phyllosphere fungi were studied by {{examining}} fungal populations from leaves of giant sequoia (Sequoiadendron giganteum (Lindl.) Buchholz) and California black oak (Quercus kelloggii Newb.). Chronic effects of both O 3 and sulfur dioxide (SO 2) were studied by isolating fungi from leaves of mature Valencia orange (Citrus sinensis L.) trees. In this chronic-exposure experiment, mature orange trees were fumigated in open-top chambers at the University of California, Riverside, {{for 4 years}} with filtered air, ambient air plus filtered air (1 : 1), ambient air, or filtered air plus SO 2 at 9. 3 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>million.</b> Populations of Alternaria alternata (Fr.) Keissler and Cladosporium cladosporioides (Fres.) de Vries, {{two of the four}} most common fungi isolated from orange leaves, were significantly reduced by chronic exposure to ambient air. In the short-term experiments, seedlings of giant sequoia or California black oak were fumigated in open-top chambers in Sequoia National Park for 9 to 11 weeks with filtered air, ambient air, or ambient air plus O 3. These short-term fumigations did not significantly affect the numbers of phyllosphere fungi. Exposure of Valencia orange trees to SO 2 at 9. 3 <b>parts</b> <b>per</b> <b>hundred</b> <b>million</b> for 4 years reduced the number of phyllosphere fungi isolated by 75 % compared with the number from the filtered-air treatment and reduced the Simpson diversity index value from 3. 3 to 2. 5. A significant chamber effect was evident since leaves of giant sequoia and California black oak located outside of chambers had more phyllosphere fungi than did seedlings within chambers. Results suggest that chronic exposure to ambient ozone or SO 2 in polluted areas can affect phyllosphere fungal communities, while short-term exposures may not significantly disturb phyllosphere fungi...|$|R

Previous eptdemiologic investigations of effects of acute exposure to ozone have focused on groups who may not be representative of the general public, such as asthmatics or student nurses. For this study, participants recorded the daily incidence of several respiratory symptoms over a 6 -month period between 1978 and 1979. The authors examined the impact of ambient concentrations of ozone, paniculate sulfates, and other air pollutants on the incidence of respiratory morbidity, measured as either upper or lower respiratory tract symptoms.
