5|$|According to The Census of the <b>Peach</b> Crop of 1907 in West Virginia {{published}} by the West Virginia Department of Agriculture, Kuykendall was engaged {{in the management of}} a commercial <b>peach</b> orchard near Romney known as Sherman Orchard.

5|$|After {{collecting}} 80 power stars, Mario and {{his friends}} reach the highest area of the castle, where they ensue a final battle against Bowser. Eventually, after Bowser's defeat, Mario {{and his friends}} return to Peach's castle, where they free <b>Peach</b> from a stained-glass window above the entrance. As a reward for saving <b>Peach,</b> she kisses Mario on the nose and bakes the cake she had promised. The game ends when Mario, Luigi, <b>Peach,</b> Yoshi and Wario wave goodbye to the player as Lakitu films and flies away. A photo with Peach's cake appears.|$|E
40|$|The USA is {{the third}} major world {{producer}} of <b>peaches</b> but consumption has decreased {{over the last two}} decades. Consumers have cited mealy texture, fruit browning and lack of sweetness as some undesirable characteristics in <b>peaches,</b> which {{may be related to the}} decline. The focus of this study was to evaluate the effect of farm management practices on fruit quality. Physical parameters (color, firmness and size), volatiles and metabolite data was collected. Sensory evaluation indicated transitional organic <b>peaches</b> were liked the best and organically grown <b>peaches</b> were least liked. All the treatments were significantly different from each other and consumers preferred the aroma of conventionally grown <b>peaches.</b> Firmness and sugar content of the treatments were not different from each other. The total phenolic content was found to be significantly higher in transitional organic and organic <b>peaches</b> compared to conventional <b>peaches.</b> Transitional organic <b>peaches</b> were more liked and organic were least liked, but the nutritional values in organic <b>peaches</b> can be the point of interest for the consumers...|$|R

5|$|In Pennsylvania, the <b>Peach</b> Bottom Railway was {{incorporated}} in 1871. The railway's Middle Division laid narrow gauge track between York and Red Lion by August 1874 and completed its line southward to Delta in 1876. It went bankrupt in 1881 and was reorganized as the York and <b>Peach</b> Bottom Railway (Y) in 1882. The Y {{merged with the}} Maryland Central Railway (successor to the Maryland Central RR) in 1891, becoming the Baltimore and Lehigh, and the new company operated trains on the combined track between York and Baltimore.|$|E
5|$|In {{the spring}} of 1986, the Metro Atlanta Chamber of Commerce (MACOC) took over the <b>Peach</b> Bowl. The bowl {{executive}} director {{at the time was}} Dick Bestwick, and he encouraged the Chamber to step up its support of the game over what had been provided by the Lions Club. In 1986, the <b>Peach</b> Bowl had no contractual obligations with college football conferences, as its successor, the Chick-fil-A Bowl, does today. Team selections were made by the <b>Peach</b> Bowl committee, a board of Atlanta community members, business leaders, and organizers of the <b>Peach</b> Bowl. To form one half of the matchup, the committee selected second-place Atlantic Coast Conference team NC State, which accepted the bowl bid on November 22, 1986, the day of their final regular-season game. The other half of the matchup was Virginia Tech, a football independent that had finished with nine wins, one loss, and one tie during the regular season and received its invitation one week after the regular season concluded.|$|E

25|$|As with <b>peaches,</b> {{nectarines}} can {{be white}} or yellow, and clingstone or freestone. On average, nectarines are slightly smaller and sweeter than <b>peaches,</b> but with much overlap. The lack of skin fuzz can make nectarine skins appear more reddish {{than those of}} <b>peaches,</b> contributing to the fruit's plum-like appearance. The lack of down on nectarines' skin also means their skin is more easily bruised than <b>peaches.</b>|$|R

5|$|Partners in Time {{features}} both original {{characters and}} those that were introduced before the game. Professor E. Gadd provides the player with advice throughout the game, while Toadsworth teaches the player new moves and skills to progress through the adventure. Although the older <b>Peach</b> is kidnapped, Baby <b>Peach</b> is retrieved from the past into the present by Toadsworth, where she is nurtured by both the old and young renditions of him. Baby Bowser appeared {{near the beginning of}} the game in the past to kidnap Baby <b>Peach,</b> although his plans were halted by an encounter with the Mario brothers and a subsequent attack from the Shroobs. Baby Bowser harasses the quartet frequently during their journey by stealing their Cobalt Star shards, and later attacking the group with his older self. Kamek the Magikoopa, Petey Piranha and Fawful, an antagonist from Mario & Luigi: Superstar Saga, appear in the game as well.|$|E
5|$|<b>Peach</b> Bowl {{officials}} pronounced themselves {{pleased with}} both the turnout for {{the game and the}} action on the field. Though traffic jams snarled attendees' arrival to the stadium, there were only 5,366 no-shows out of 58,212tickets sold. Following the game, <b>Peach</b> Bowl chairman Ira Hefter announced that the bowl would seek corporate sponsorship and a potential television broadcast deal with a major American television network. The takeover by the chamber of commerce also proved to be successful, as the 1986 game made a small profit. This was an improvement over the three previous <b>Peach</b> Bowls, which lost more than $170,000. The sellout also confirmed that the game would continue to be held annually instead of being abandoned, as sportswriters had speculated prior to the 1986 game.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the aroma and sensory profiles of various types of <b>peaches</b> (Prunus persica L. Batsch.). Forty-three commercial cultivars comprising <b>peaches,</b> flat <b>peaches,</b> nectarines, and canning <b>peaches</b> (pav√≠as) were grown over two consecutive harvest years. Fruits were assessed for chemical aroma and sensory profiles. Chemical aroma profile was obtained by proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry (PTR-MS) and spectral masses were tentatively identified with PTR-Time of Flight-MS (PTR-Tof-MS). Sensory analysis was performed at commercial maturity considering seven aroma/ flavor attributes. The four types of <b>peaches</b> showed both distinct chemical aroma and sensory profiles. Flat <b>peaches</b> and canning <b>peaches</b> showed most distinct patterns according to discriminant analysis. The sensory data were related to the volatile compounds by partial least square regression. Œ≥-Hexalactone, Œ≥-Octalactone, hotrienol, acetic acid and ethyl acetate correlated positively, and benzeneacetaldehyde, trimethylbenzene and acetaldehyde negatively to the intensities of aroma and ripe fruit sensory score...|$|R

5|$|The <b>Peach</b> Bowl {{game was}} created in 1968 by the Lions Club of Atlanta {{as a means to}} attract tourism to the city. First played at Grant Field on the campus of Georgia Tech, the game was moved to Fulton County Stadium in 1971. By the mid-1980s, the <b>Peach</b> Bowl was facing hard times. At the time, NCAA {{guidelines}} for bowls required 75percent of gross receipts to go to participating schools, with 33percent of tickets to the game also required to go to each school. In 1983, the NCAA threatened to revoke the <b>Peach</b> Bowl's charter when ticket sales hovered around 25,000 with a week to go before the bowl. Last-minute sales saved the game, as attendance at the 1983 game climbed to 40,000 and a new television contract allowed the bowl to make a payout of $580,000 to each team. Still, the bowl's future was in doubt.|$|E
5|$|The Thousand-Year Door borrows many {{gameplay}} {{elements from}} its predecessor, {{such as a}} paper-themed universe and a turn-based battle system {{with an emphasis on}} action. For the majority of the game the player controls Mario, although Bowser and Princess <b>Peach</b> are playable at certain points. The plot follows Mario's quest as he tries to retrieve the seven Crystal Stars and rescue <b>Peach</b> from the X-Nauts.|$|E
5|$|The game {{begins as}} Professor E. Gadd completes his newest {{invention}} {{of a time}} machine powered by a gem called the Cobalt Star, which is presented at Peach's Castle. <b>Peach</b> enters the time machine into the past, but fails to return, only leaving {{a member of an}} alien species known only as the Shroobs within the damaged time machine. The Mushroom Kingdom of the past had actually been invaded by the Shroobs, with <b>Peach</b> being kidnapped and held hostage at her castle. After defeating the monster, a time hole opens, leaving a passageway into the past. While searching for <b>Peach,</b> Mario and Luigi locate their younger selves, and agree to locate the crystal shards, which are remnants of the Cobalt Star which had been shattered during Peach's journey. Unwittingly, the brothers collect all of the shards, while being pestered by Baby Bowser (Bowser in the past) who wants the Cobalt Star. At the end, they restore the Cobalt Star only to unleash the Elder Princess Shroob, who serves as the game's final boss character. The story ends when she is defeated, <b>Peach</b> is rescued, and the past returns to normal.|$|E
