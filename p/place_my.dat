In her words in 1902:My joy in the Persian Revelation is not that it reveals one of the streams flowing to the great Ocean of Life, Light and Love, but that it is a perfect mirror of that Ocean. What, in Green Acre, was a vision and a hope becomes, through it a blessed reality now. It has illuminated for me every other expression of Truth which I had hitherto known and <b>place</b> <b>my</b> feet on a Rock from which they cannot be moved. And it is the Manifestation of the Fatherhood - Behá'u'lláh (ed - as it was spelled in those days) - who had taught me to look away from even the Greatest and find within the One 'Powerful, Mighty, and Supreme' who is to be the Redeemer of my life. It is a Revelation of Unity such as I had never before found. By means of its Light, as shown the life of the Master Abbas Abdul Beha, I have entered into a joy greater than any I have hitherto known. Green Acre was established as a means to that end and in proportion as well lay aside all spirit of criticism of others and seek only to live the Unity we find, shall we be able to help others to the same divine realization.|$|E

However, his peers believed that it was very distinct from the lead single, [...] "Don't Wanna Go Home" [...] and that response motivated him to pick it as the second single. He believed that showing the difference in the new album was important in picking the single. He did not want to put another dance song so that his fans do not assume that the entire album consisted of uptempo songs. He concluded that [...] "growing up has definitely taken <b>place.</b> <b>My</b> music has always been a representation of who I am and I guess I speak differently, my demeanour is different." ...|$|E
500|$|In Cosmas's writing, {{the saint}} was named [...] "Jovan from Vladimir"; {{his father was}} Nemanja (historically, Grand Prince of Raška from 1166 to 1196), and his {{grandfather}} was Simeon (Bulgarian Tsar from 893 to 927). He married a daughter of Samuel, the tsar of Bulgaria and Ohrid. He succeeded his father as emperor of Albania, Illyria, and Dalmatia. After Byzantine Emperor Basil defeated Tsar Samuel, Emperor Jovan defeated Basil. He also fought against the Bogomil and Messalian heretics. From his early youth, Jovan Vladimir longed for the Kingdom of God. After he was married, he prayed day and night, and abstained from intercourse with his wife. She was a heretic like her brother, whom she incited to kill Jovan. When the two brothers-in-law rode together, accompanied by soldiers, the heretic suddenly struck Jovan with a sword at a mountain pass named Derven, but could not cut him. Only when Jovan gave him his own sword was the murderer able to cut off his head. Jovan caught {{it in the air}} and rode on to the church he had built near Elbasan. There he put his head down, saying, [...] "Lord Jesus Christ, in your hands I <b>place</b> <b>my</b> spirit," [...] and died; it was AD899. He was buried in the church, which then became the scene of many miracles. The saint's beneficent power is described in the hagiography: ...|$|E

The Jewish Sages stressed {{that although the}} priests are the ones carrying out the blessing, it is not them or the ceremonial practice of raising their hands that results in the blessing, but rather it is God's desire that His blessing should be transferred {{by means of the}} Kohanim's hands.|$|E

Baldwin, a noninterventionist, admitted others [...] "have urged me to <b>place</b> <b>my</b> name in nomination."

[...] Asquith had anticipated this response, but {{was surprised by}} a letter from Arthur Balfour, who until that point {{had been removed from}} the crisis by illness. On its face, this letter merely offered confirmation that Balfour believed that Lloyd George's scheme for a smaller War Council deserved a chance and that he had no wish to remain at the Admiralty if Lloyd George wished him out. Jenkins argues that Asquith should have recognised it as a shift of allegiance. Asquith discussed the crisis with Lord Crewe and they agreed an early meeting with the Unionist ministers was essential. Without their support, [...] "it would be impossible for Asquith to continue." ...|$|E

2500|$|All of Norman Africa was {{essentially}} abandoned to the Almohads save Mahdia. Tripoli fell in 1158, and Mahdia was under siege from {{late in the}} summer of 1159. In response to the Almohad caliph's question, [...] "Why did you ever abandon so strongly-fortified a place as that?", al-Hasan, who was in his camp, is said to have replied, [...] "Because I had few in whom I could <b>place</b> <b>my</b> trust; because food was lacking; and because it was the will of fate." [...] In response, Caliph Abd al-Mū‘min is said to have temporarily abandoned the siege in order to construct two large mounds of wheat and barley. Sfax, which had been in revolt against William for some time, accepted Almohad overlordship during the siege, while the city of Gabès was taken by force. In January 1160 Mahdia was breached and Abd al-Mū‘min gave its remaining Christians and Jews the option of Islam or death.|$|E
2500|$|Following the 1904 Olympics, Rose bested Coe {{again at}} an event hosted by the Boston Athletic Association.

[...] In February 1905, a large crowd was drawn to watch Coe at the indoor games of the Lawrence Light Guard Athletic Association held in the armory at Medford, Massachusetts. [...] Rose attended the event as a guest and wished Coe luck before his first toss. [...] Coe fell short of the record on his first four throws. [...] As Coe prepared for his final throw, Rose said, [...] "Come on now, old boy, you are in grand form this evening, and {{with just a little}} more power on your next put, you ought to <b>place</b> <b>my</b> mark well in the shade." [...] The Boston Globe described the final throw as follows:"Coe smiled at the encouraging remark of his famous rival, and then made steady for his final put. [...] The padded shot was carefully poised in his right hand, a firm grip was secured and then, with a lightning-like hop and spring, he drove the ball down the half. [...] He secured splendid altitude, and when it dropped beyond his previous mark, Rose exclaimed, 'You've got it, Coe, and I congratulate you.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|Mishnah Sheviit chapter 10 and Tosefta Sheviit 8:3–11 {{interpreted}} [...] {{to address}} debts and the Sabbatical year. The Mishnah {{held that the}} Sabbatical year cancelled loans, whether they were secured by a bond or not, but did not cancel debts to a shopkeeper or unpaid wages of a laborer, unless these debts were made into loans. When Hillel saw people refraining from lending, in transgression of [...] he ordained the prosbul (...) , which ensured the repayment of loans notwithstanding the Sabbatical year. Citing the literal meaning of [...] — [...] "this is {{the word of the}} release" [...] — the Mishnah held that a creditor could accept payment of a debt notwithstanding an intervening Sabbatical year, if the creditor had first by word told the debtor that the creditor relinquished the debt. A prosbul prevents the remission of debts in the Sabbatical year. Hillel saw that people were unwilling to lend money to one another and disregarded the precept laid down in [...] "Beware that there be not a base thought in your heart saying, ‘The seventh year, the year of release, is at hand'; and your eye be evil against your needy brother, and you give him nothing," [...] and Hillel therefore decided to institute the prosbul. The text of the prosbul says: [...] "I hand over to you, So-and-so, the judges in such-and-such a <b>place,</b> <b>my</b> bonds, so that I may be able to recover any money owing to me from So-and-so at any time I shall desire."
