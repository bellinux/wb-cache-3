40|$|In {{the second}} of two {{companion}} articles, a 54 -year time series for the oyster population in the New Jersey waters of Delaware Bay is analyzed to examine how the presence of multiple stable states affects reference-point–based management. Multiple stable states are described by four types of reference points. Type I is the carrying capacity for the stable state: each has associated with it a type-II reference point wherein <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> reaches a local maximum. Type-II reference points are separated by an intermediate <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> low (type III). Two stable states establish a type-IV reference point, a point-of-no-return that impedes recovery to the higher stable state. The type-II to type-III differential in <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> {{is a measure of}} the difficulty of rebuilding the population and the sensitivity of the population to collapse at high abundance. <b>Surplus</b> <b>production</b> projections show that the abundances defining the four types of reference points are relatively stable over a wide range of uncertainties in recruitment and mortality rates.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we analyze {{the effect of}} {{inequality}} {{in the distribution of}} endowments of private inputs (like land, capital) on production efficiency through its effect on the voluntary provision of collective inputs (like irrigation, public research) that are complementary in production with those private inputs. The collective inputs can be both of the kind in which one producer benefits from their use by others (as in the case of research and extension) and the kind in which one’s use detracts from potential use by others (as in the case of irrigation water from a pond). Markets in the private inputs are assumed to be imperfect, inhibiting their efficient allocation across individuals. In this context we work out how an increase in inequality in the distribution of private inputs affects the voluntary provision or use of the collective inputs and the total <b>production</b> <b>surplus</b> in this simple economy. In general we show that while <b>production</b> <b>surplus</b> increases with greater equality within the group of contributors (users) and the group of non-contributors (non-users) to the collective input, in some situations there is an optimal degree of inequality between the two groups. ∗We thank the editors Jean-Marie Baland and Sam Bowles for very helpful comments.

The traditional <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> model incorporates the assumption that catch per unit of effort is constant for a given stock size. As a result, effort can be indefinitely applied to the fishery in the short term, and catch would indefinitely increase at a constant rate. In this paper, a <b>surplus</b> <b>production</b> bioeconomic model is developed using a nonlinear form of the short-run catch equation based on the Spillman production function. Two long-run models were derived using the logistic and exponential growth models. The parameters for the long-run equilibrium models are estimated from catch and effort data using a disequilibrium form of the model.

While very appealing from an incentives viewpoint under diminishing marginal returns, the asymmetry of these methods lacks solid economic interpretation. We provide such an interpretation by considering {{a situation where the}} technology to be shared results from the aggregation of private production processes. We propose a group-strategyproof mechanism under which no single agent wishes to secede from the partnership: the inverse marginal product proportions mechanism.

In the production of colored grape juices for direct consumption, the application of heat on crushed grapes is a possible technology to increase extraction of anthocyanins and other phenolic compounds. To achieve this aim, three different thermal treatments were performed on crushed grapes of two different red varieties with peonidin or malvidin prevalence in the anthocyanin profile. Qualitative and quantitative differences in the chem- ical composition and color characteristics of the juices were evaluated to pinpoint the time–temperature combi- nation that allowed the highest extraction of anthocyanins. Furthermore, the modification of skin mechanical properties during thermal treatment and impact of the peonidin/malvidin ratio on juice color were investigated. The use of high temperatures for short times was the most profitable time–temperature combination based on the extraction efficacy, color stability and energetic requirements...|$|E
