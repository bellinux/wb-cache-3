40|$|Using Annual Housing Survey data on multifamily {{structure}} occupancy by {{household type}} for 1975, together with number of household projections from the Department of Agriculture, a gross level of multifamily housing demand is <b>projected.</b> <b>Allowance</b> is made for a 2 percent replacement rate of the total stock {{as well as a}} 5 percent vacancy figure for new household demand. Assuming that: (1) there is no massive shift away from one-family ownership to multifamily units, and (2) the present level of conversions from one-family units to multiple occupancy continues to offset the trend of conversion from rental multifamily units to condominium status, then total future demand for multifamily rental units is well within current construction levels. We are presently building one and one-half times the demand of 416, 000 units per year projected for 1975 - 80. The demand from 1980 to 1990 decreases to 367, 000 new units annually. This is further reduced to 335, 000 units annually for the period 1990 - 2000. The major determinants of future demand will focus on the scrap-page rate of extant facilities and the regional shifts of population. The future supply of multifamily structures depends on an abatement of construction costs and interest rates, and/or massive levels of Government subsidy. There is evidence that operating cost rises are challenging the financial integrity of multifamily structures. This is manifested by the HUD and private market mortgage delinquency and foreclosure rates. Policy focus for the future should emphasize the minimization of both construction and operating costs rather than augmented delivery rates.

40|$|For many years, {{applications}} of copper fungicides {{have been used}} to control downy mildew on grapes. Nowadays, its intensive use is under consideration due to ecotoxicological aspects, especially in organic viticulture. As a result, this <b>project</b> made <b>allowance</b> for consumer perception about organic viticulture and is seeking suitable alternatives. The project includes an association of six research facilities, four organic wineries, several consultant agencies for organic viticulture as well as SME (small and medium-sized enterprise) partners, which are working together in four work packages. The aim of this work is to obtain an array of products that provide sufficient control of Plasmopara viticola with the lowest possible input of copper. As a longterm intention, copper-containing products should be totally replaced by other effective agents. Progress to-date suggests that some non-copper products and several copper-based products using less than 3 kg/(ha*a) have potential to effectively control the disease with less ecological residue...|$|R

2500|$|A {{pilot for}} the new policy was {{initiated}} by WaterAid in Dodoma Urban District together with the district government. An innovative feature {{of the project was}} that the water department worked closely with the community development department and the health department. Both had previously not been involved in water projects. Using the acronyms of the three departments and of WaterAid the integrated team was called WAMMA, giving the project its name. Each of the three departmental teams had to have both men and women among its staff, although this was difficult to implement because of a shortage of female staff. Unlike before, communities were selected based on a needs survey. [...] However, government staff at all levels were poorly paid and had little interesting work to do. Some were consequently demotivated. Like many other externally funded projects, the WAMMA <b>project</b> paid <b>allowances</b> to fieldworkers for work undertaken outside their offices in order to motivate them. However, “payments were made at the official rate, as any higher allowances would undermine the government’s capacity to sustain or replicate work without donor inputs.” Interestingly, WaterAid initially worked directly at the district level without any formal agreement with the regional government until 1995. The programme, which was considered a success by WaterAid and the district government, was subsequently extended from Dodoma Urban District to three other districts in Dodoma Region. 86 projects were built under between 1991 and 1996. The innovative collaborative work between three district departments and the participatory approach attracted visitors from all over Tanzania.|$|R
30|$|Cap & {{trade has}} been the {{preferred}} policy instrument for many years, though there is some recent momentum for a carbon tax approach. Successful examples of emissions trading are the US Clean Air Act amendments of 1990, which implemented this policy to reduce sulfur dioxide omissions that contribute heavily to acid rain, the European (GHG) Emissions Trading System (ETS), the (Northeastern/Mid-Atlantic US States) Regional Greenhouse Gas Initiative (RGGI), and more recent emissions trading systems in California and some Chinese provinces. While these systems have incurred some problems, overall the assessment {{is that they have}} been successful (Ellerman and Buchner 2007). Another attractive feature of cap & trade is that equity issues can be addressed head-on by the allocation of allowances among countries without undercutting economic efficiency (thereby overcoming the standard equity-efficiency trade-off that plagues so many policies, such as unemployment insurance) (Rose et al. 1998). Moreover, this policy instrument is compatible with the bottom-up approach, whereby each country decides on its own initial allocation of <b>allowances</b> (<b>projected</b> baseline emissions minus their pledge) (Rose et al. 2017).|$|R

Under the EU and especially the G- 20 proposals the Overall commitment constrains distorting support {{to be less than}} the sum of the cap on blue and the Maximum Usable Components (MUC). The MUC is smaller than the sum of the commitment on Total Aggregate Measurement of Support (TAMS) and all de minimis allowances.

40|$|Phosphor bronze tapes used in {{underground}} {{power transmission}} cables {{are affected by}} pitting corrosion {{that can lead to}} cable failures. In the present work, the probability distribution of corrosion pit depth on phosphor bronze tape is investigated by using Monte Carlo simulations and compared with the measured pit depth distribution of such tapes which have been in service for about 45 years. The pit depth as a function of time is modelled as 1 ̆d 466 (1 ̆d 461) = 1 ̆d 6 fc(1 ̆d 461) ^ 1 ̆d 6 fd where y is the pit depth, α and β are pitting proportionality and exponent factors. A Monte Carlo simulation is performed to generate the pit depth distribution by keeping β as constant and varying α using three parameter Generalized Extreme Value (GEV) distribution. We observed that the simple power law is capable of predicting the evolution of pit depth distribution and also the distribution under different environmental conditions. This predictive pit depth distribution model will be a valuable tool to decide the extent of pitting corrosion in phosphor bronze tape used in underground power transmission cables.

40|$|Biomass {{cogeneration}} {{is widely}} used for district heating applications in central and northern Europe. Biomass trigeneration on the other hand, constitutes an innovative renewable energy application. In this work an approved UNFCCC baseline methodology has been extended to allow the examination of biomass trigeneration applications. The methodology is applied to {{a case study in}} Greece, to investigate various environmental and financial aspects of this type of applications. The results suggest that trigeneration may lead to significant emissions reduction, compared to using fossil fuels or even biomass co-generation and electricity generation. The emissions reduction achieved may be materialized into a considerable revenue stream for the project, if traded through a trading mechanism such as EU ETS. A sensitivity analysis has been performed to compensate for the high volatility of the emission allowances’ value and the immaturity of the EU Trading Scheme, which prevent a reliable estimation of the related revenue. The work concludes that emission allowances trading may develop into one of the major revenue streams of biomass trigeneration projects, significantly increasing their financial yield and attractiveness. The impact on the yield is significant even for low future values of emission allowances and could become the main income revenue source of such <b>projects,</b> if emission <b>allowances</b> increase their value substantially. The application of trigeneration for district energy proves to lead to increased environmental and financial benefits compared to the co-generation or electricity generation cases...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this report is to provide the office of Waste Management (WM) with {{recommended}} contingency calculation procedures for typical WM projects. Typical projects were defined as conventional construction-type activities that use innovative elements when necessary to meet the project objectives. Projects involve treatment, storage, and disposal of low level, mixed low level, hazardous, transuranic, and high level waste. Cost contingencies are {{an essential part of}} Total Cost Management. A contingency is an amount added to a cost estimate to compensate for unexpected expenses resulting from incomplete design, unforeseen and unpredictable conditions, or uncertainties in the project scope (DOE 1994, AACE 1998). Contingency allowances are expressed as percentages of estimated cost and improve cost estimates by accounting for uncertainties. The contingency allowance is large {{at the beginning of a}} project because there are more uncertainties, but as a <b>project</b> develops, the <b>allowance</b> shrinks to adjust for costs already incurred. Ideally, the total estimated cost remains the same throughout a project. Project contingency reflects the degree of uncertainty caused by lack of project definition, and process contingency reflects the degree of uncertainty caused by use of new technology. Different cost estimation methods were reviewed and compared with respect to terminology, accuracy, and Cost Guide standards. The Association for the Advancement of Cost Engineering (AACE) methods for cost estimation were selected to represent best industry practice. AACE methodology for contingency analysis can be readily applied to WM Projects, accounts for uncertainties associated with different stages of a project, and considers both project and process contingencies and the stage of technical readiness. As recommended, AACE contingency allowances taper off linearly as a project nears completion...|$|R
40|$|The {{concerns}} {{related to}} {{global climate change}} {{have resulted in the}} formulation of new mechanisms concerning environmental governance. Payments for Environmental Services (PES) are one of these tools; however the implications of introducing such methods are not yet fully understood. In the context of REDD, Brazil has a lot of potential for the successful implementation of PES-based programmes. This has {{led to the creation of}} a PES-based <b>project,</b> the Forest <b>Allowance</b> Programme (BFP), which is currently operating in 14 protected areas in the Amazon State, under the management of the non-governmental Sustainable Amazonas Foundation (FAS). The introduction of monetary incentives can alter local dynamics, and the implementation of the programme thus requires a thorough understanding of local institutional settings in order for the desired objectives to be achieved. Institutional theory regarding rationality and normative behaviour must also be taken into account, in order to avoid adverse outcomes. The study area of the Juma Sustainable Development Reserve in the Amazon State was chosen as it is currently one of the sites of the implementation of the BFP, which is at present the only internationally certified project in Brazil aimed at rewarding the forest communities for protecting their resources. We looked at possible indicators, such as changes in agricultural practices, income level, awareness of the environmental protection, and others, which could reveal shifts in attitudes, motivation and behaviour resulting from the introduction of the programme. The field data was collected via household questionnaires with the residents of the reserve and interviews with programme facilitators, as well as by informal group discussions, and direct field observations. The results reveal that the recent implementation of the BFP makes estimating the potential effects and costs of the project a challenge. Minor changes in behaviour and attitudes were observed, however the results could not be clearly attributed to the introduction of the programme and the financial incentives. The findings suggest that other incentives besides the monetary one, such as education efforts, are likely to have a stronger effect and will also be more long-lasting. The programme also seems to have a positive role in reinforcing the functioning of the reserve, through encouragement of monitoring and control among the participants, as well as through ensuring the continued presence of forest dwellers in the area, thus minimising the risk of external deforestation threats...|$|R
30|$|The license {{adopted by}} an open source {{software}} is associated with its success in terms of attractiveness and maintenance of an active ecosystem of users, bug reporters, developers, and sponsors because what can and cannot {{be done with the}} software and its derivatives in terms of improvement and market distribution depends on legal terms there specified. By knowing this licensing effect through scientific publications and their experience, project managers became able to act strategically, loosening up the restrictions associated with their source code due to sponsor interests, for example; or the contrary, tightening restrictions up to guarantee source code openness, adhering to the “forever free” strategy. But, have project managers behaved strategically like that, changing their projects license? Up to this paper, we did not know if and what types of changes in these legal <b>allowances</b> <b>project</b> managers have made and, more importantly, whether such managerial interventions are associated with variations in intervened project attractiveness (i.e., related to their numbers of web hits, downloads and members). This paper accomplishes these two goals and demonstrates that: 1) managers of free and {{open source software}} projects do change the distribution rights of their source code through a change in the (group of) license(s) adopted; and 2) variations in attractiveness are associated with the strategic choice of a licensing schema. To reach these conclusions, a unique dataset of open source projects that have changed license was assembled in a comparative form, analyzing intervened projects over its monthly periods of different licenses. Based on a sample of more than 3500 active projects over 44  months obtained from the FLOSSmole repository of Sourceforge.net data, 756 projects that had changed their source code distribution allowances and restrictions were identified and analyzed. A dataset on these projects’ type of changes was assembled to enable a descriptive and exploratory analysis of the types of license interventions observed over a period of almost four years anchored on projects’ attractiveness. More than 35 types of interventions were detected. The results indicate that variations in attractiveness after a license intervention are not symmetric; that is, if a change from license schema A to B is beneficial to attractiveness, a change from B to A is not necessarily prejudicial. This and other interesting findings are discussed in detail. In general, the results here reported support the current literature knowledge that the restrictions imposed by the license on the source code distribution are associated with market success vis-a-vis project attractiveness, but they also suggest that the state-of-the-science is superficial in terms of what is known about why these differences in attractiveness can be observed. The complexity of the results indicates to free software managers that no licensing schema should be seen as the right one, and its choice should be carefully made, considering project strategic goals as perceived relevant to stakeholders of the application and its production. These conclusions create awareness of several limitations of our current knowledge, which are discussed along with guidelines to understand them deeper in future research endeavors.|$|R
