Parents' decision whether the compulsory school attendance will be postponed or not, should never become a formal matter, whereas parents can cause their children considerable difficulties in the future education and subsequent life just through their unadvised approach. My final thesis consists of four chapters and is divided into theoretical and empirical parts. The theoretical part is based on the theoretical resources and the general characteristics of <b>pre-primary</b> <b>education,</b> school counselling <b>service</b> departments, also from the experiences of senior staff of kindergartens in the field of compulsory school attendance. It is based on the legal definitions of <b>pre-primary</b> <b>education</b> and school counselling service departments.

However, to better understand which aspects of <b>pre-primary</b> <b>education</b> are most important and how the relationship to learning outcomes varies by context—critical information for policymakers designing new or modifying existing <b>pre-primary</b> <b>education</b> systems with resource constraints—detailed data on the programs in place in countries across the income spectrum is needed.

30|$|While global {{enrollment}} in primary education has increased significantly particularly since {{it became a}} target of the United Nations “Education for All” initiative {{and one of the}} Millennium Development Goals, primary completion rates have remained virtually unchanged since 1999. Evidence from studies of individual programs in a range of countries suggests that {{enrollment in}} <b>pre-primary</b> <b>education</b> can improve school readiness and achievement in primary school, and therefore, potentially raise primary completion rates. As research has also found that provision of free education is associated with higher enrollment, we hypothesize that provision of free and compulsory <b>pre-primary</b> <b>education</b> will be associated with higher primary school completion rates. Further, we hypothesize that free <b>pre-primary</b> <b>education</b> will have the largest impact where completion rates have been lowest. Using a database of quantitative, globally comparable measures of national provision of free <b>pre-primary</b> <b>education</b> we created, and data from UNESCO’s Institute for Education Statistics, we analyze the 104 nations with complete data. We conduct multivariate quantile regression analyses. We find that, controlling for national income and level of urbanization, provision of at least 1  year of free and compulsory <b>pre-primary</b> <b>education</b> is associated with a nearly 10 percentage point increase in primary school graduation rates for countries at the median and a 12 percentage point increase in rates for primarily low- and lower-middle-income countries {{at the lower end of}} the distribution.|$|R
30|$|We {{examine the}} effect of two public {{policies}} which reflect the choices of policymakers providing free and compulsory <b>pre-primary</b> <b>education.</b> Enrollment in <b>pre-primary</b> <b>education,</b> on the other hand, is a function of observed and unobserved child and family characteristics which may be correlated with the likelihood of primary graduation. As a result, using enrollment as a predictor in the regression model would generate biased estimates. To correct for the potential endogeneity, we use an indicator of a national policy of <b>pre-primary</b> <b>education</b> as an instrument for pre-primary participation. The policy indicator is a valid instrument first because it is correlated with pre-primary enrollment (enrollment rates should be higher in countries with free and compulsory education). Second, the provision of free and compulsory <b>pre-primary</b> <b>education</b> is determined by national policymakers not parents (directly at least) so therefore, it is independent of the family and individual-level characteristics that are correlated with both pre-primary enrollment and primary graduation, and as such the policy is uncorrelated with the error term in a standard regression model, the second criteria for a valid instrument.|$|R
30|$|Is it {{feasible}} to extend free and compulsory education {{for one or}} more pre-primary years in countries that struggle to meet other social priorities? Numerous countries’ experiences support an affirmative response. While there are many complex issues of scaling-up small programs (Wolfensohn Center for Development at Brookings 2009), effective <b>pre-primary</b> <b>education</b> programs at scale exist in developing countries from diverse regions, with different governing and economic development approaches. For example, in Vietnam, {{after the passage of}} a 1999 law expanding provision of public preschools, enrollment among 3 – 5 -year-olds, particularly in urban areas, increased markedly (Heymann 2006). In 1999, 39 % of children aged 3 – 5 were enrolled in pre-primary schools. Just 8  years later, in 2007, the rate had reached 65 % (UNESCO IS 2017 d). In Cuba, the universality of <b>pre-primary</b> <b>education</b> was achieved by 2000 (Tinajero 2010). Kazakhstan made <b>pre-primary</b> <b>education</b> free and compulsory in 1999 (Shaeffer 2015).

In this study, we use the most recent data on primary graduation rates available between 2009 and 2014 and data on policies regarding the provision of free and/or compulsory <b>pre-primary</b> <b>education</b> (or lack thereof) in the year when students eligible to graduate would have been entering their last year of pre-primary school if it was provided (2002 – 2009).|$|R
