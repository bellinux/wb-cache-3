40|$|More {{than any}} other {{environmental}} chemicals, dioxins {{have been in the}} limelight of public interest for about 10 years. In addition to carcinogenicity, genetic risk is a cause for concern. Mutagenicity tests performed so far do not give a clear picture. The mutagenic potential of dioxins has to be considered weak or absent. Therefore, it seemed profitable to investigate comutagenicity and co-recombinogenicity of dioxins more thoroughly. The only useful method for investigating comutagenicity and co-recombinogenicity of dioxins in vivo is the spot test with mice. In this test system, a number of cocarcinogens and tumor promoters have shown comutagenic or co-recombinogenic effects. In the present study, tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (TCDD) and two environmental dioxin mixtures (<b>pentachlorodibenzodioxin</b> - PCDD - 1 and 2) were tested for genetic activity...|$|E
