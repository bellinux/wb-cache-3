50|$|The Office of Patented Medicines and Liaison {{is located}} in the Therapeutic ProductsDirectorate, Health Products and Foods Branch, Health Canada. The Notice of Compliance Regulations it administers require the Minister of Health to {{maintain}} a <b>Patent</b> <b>Register.</b> This consists of patent lists submitted in respect of eligible NOC-issued drugs. The Minister responsible for Health Canada may refuse to add, or may delete, information from this <b>Patent</b> <b>Register.</b> Each patent list is audited (for example as to whether potential inclusions are mere 'evergreening' attempts) by the Office of Patented Medicines and Liaison. Reports produced by that body outline statistics relating to the maintenance of the <b>Patent</b> <b>Register,</b> including the number of patents filed, the number of patents accepted and rejected, and litigation resulting from the acceptance or rejection of patents for listing on the <b>Patent</b> <b>Register.</b> In October 2006, the Canadian federal government recognized that some brand-name companies had been abusing the NOC Regulations. It limited their use of 'evergreening' follow-on patents by promulgating regulations that prevented any new patents they filed after a generic company had submitted an application for approval of its product from being considered in the NOC Regulations process. Moreover, the new regulations made it clear that patents covering areas without direct therapeutic application, such as processes or intermediates, could not be used to delay generic approval.|$|E

40|$|Australia, {{like most}} countries, faces high and rapidly-rising drug costs. There are longstanding {{concerns}} about pharmaceutical companies inappropriately extending their monopoly position by "evergreening" blockbuster drugs, through misuse of the patent system. There is, however, very little empirical {{information about this}} behaviour. We fill the gap by analysing all of the patents associated with 15 of the costliest drugs in Australia over the last 20 years. Specifically, we search the <b>patent</b> <b>register</b> to identify all the granted patents that cover the active pharmaceutical ingredient of the high-cost drugs. Then, we classify the patents by type, and identify their owners. We find a mean of 49 patents associated with each drug. Three-quarters of these patents are owned by companies other than the drug's originator. Surprisingly, the majority of all patents are owned by companies {{that do not have}} a record of developing top-selling drugs. Our findings show that a multitude of players seek monopoly control over innovations to blockbuster drugs. Consequently, attempts to control drug costs by mitigating misuse of the patent system are likely to miss the mark if they focus only on the patenting activities of originator...|$|E
40|$|Patent {{opposition}} in Australia is an administrative process within the Patent Office, whereby third parties, such as competitors, suppliers, or customers of the patentee, raise arguments and provide evidence against {{the validity of}} a patent that has been accepted, but not yet granted. As such, it can potentially {{play an important role}} in maintaining the quality of the <b>patent</b> <b>register.</b> As a number of economists and legal scholars have pointed out, it is impossible for patent offices to find all the prior art relevant to a patent, particularly where that prior art lies outside the patent literature. Competitors and other outsiders, however, are likely to have information relevant to the validity of the patent, because they are active in the technology. If these 2 ̆ 7 outsiders 2 ̆ 7 can be encouraged to bring that information to the attention of the Patent Office, the examiners will be in a better position to make the right decisions about granting patents. At the same time, there are potential benefits, especially for smaller businesses, to having a low cost mechanism for challenging the validity of patent applications, particularly in an era where increasing burdens on patent offices are raising questions about the quality of the patents being granted...|$|E

40|$|Sustained {{very high}} rate of growth (above 8 % in the context today in India) {{would be able to}} achieve (since a labour {{productivity}} growth of 4 to 4. 5 % is to be factored in) a labour absorption rate of 3. 5 to 4 % which is about a percent above the growth in the rate of the workforce. But slower growth of around 6 % which is what India seems to be achieving in the 90 s on an average would keep disguised unemployment alive for long. Similarly, the transformation of firms and especially SMEs which have little autonomous capacity is itself a function of growth oriented policies. In the nineties labour has been sufficiently flexible to allow rapid growth whenever demand was high. In any case the unorganised workers, did not have the ability to resist hire and fire. Demand has been lower than possible otherwise since the rupee especially in comparison to the East Asian currencies has not been aggressively priced. Lacking a very rapid growth in the market sufficient to overcome disguised unemployment, the transformation of these industries has itself been affected. Similarly the continuation of tariff inversion, high and uncompensated energy taxes hurt manufacturing and especially the small and medium sector whose dependence on relative factor cost is higher. The slow movement towards de-reservation has further attenuated the process. The dynamic inefficiencies and distortions are far more significant than the static efficiency penalty that the economy pays in the continuation of reservation. Without these corrections the move to have “free-trade” agreements with the ASEAN countries would hurt manufacturing in India and especially the SMEs. Many of the traditional small firms are in clusters, and a cluster oriented approach would be important for their success. A strategy based on leveraging trade names /brand names, many of which could be argued to be "geographic indicators", with much equity world wide, would require immediate changes in our intellectual property rights regime. Costs of excise registration and dealing with excise authorities are too large, and there is a fixed component to this cost which cannot be spread over a large value of turnover. Only significantly lower excise rates for small firms could compensate them sufficiently. The criteria of "with and without the use of power" in the Factories Act, be entirely dispensed with. All units with more than 50 employees including the entrepreneur and family labour, be brought /retained under (all) the provisions of the Factories Act. And all other units be entirely exempt from its provisions. Credit {{is the single most important}} constraint for small firms. Incentivisation of priority sector targets is the solution. The policy of directed lending to small firms (the targets for priority sector lending) ought to shift from targets or quotas to incentives to banks for lending to small firms. Responsible risk taking in lending would have to re-emerge. Tax based incentives for banks and financial intermediaries are possible. Statutory Reserves based incentives for banks too are possible. Concessions on interest rates are dysfunctional, though the margin above PLR rates ought to be subject to a ceiling. State Finance Corporations which could play a crucial role in financing of SMEs would have to go through quick restructuring and refocus on promotion of new enterprises typically where vast positive external effects are anticipated, such as in technology based small firms, promising industries, nodal industries, industrial estate corporations, in exchanging specific infrastructural support to existing clusters of small firms, etc. Investments in infrastructure especially general roads, power, railways, and water supply would help to improve the performance of small firms significantly. For all small firms power and water continue to remain constraints shamefully after nearly 10 years of reform. These can easily come down at least for export industries if the taxes and cross subsidies on them are made vattable. Despite the Electricity Act 2003, it is shameful that open-access has not been extended to SMEs. Technology based and skill labour using industries such as IT, BT, pharmaceuticals and auto oriented industries, also need to be exploited. In automobiles taxes are still very large and the inverted tariffs / high cost of materials and energy that are uncompensated hurt the prospects of India emerging as a base for manufactures. In IT, Biotechnology, pharmaceutical industries and other related offshoring activities the challenges lie in bringing about better IPR regimes that reduces the risk faced by foreign firms in their operations in India. IPR regimes requiring much insight would have to be worked work out that is able to balance the interest of Indian firms and yet lead to much industrial relocation. The addition of a petty <b>patent</b> <b>register</b> could considerably enhance the extraction of value from the many innovations that take place in the SME sector. Municipal infrastructure is inadequate and its correction in at least a few cities is of crucial importance to the growth of the off-shoring activities and growth in these industries. Financial institutions could usefully develop strong venture capital arms to finance innovative small firms that have a good potential to emerge in the near future in many industries. Problems with government procurement which are designed to fail keeps alive a very large market for shoddy goods among SMEs. Merging of the umpteen laws and regulations into one wherever feasible can reduce the currently large costs of SMEs in dealing with government. ...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Patents {{are used}} as {{indicators}} to assess the growth {{of science and technology}} in a given country or area. They are examined to determine the research potentials of research centers, universities, and inventors. This study aims to map the past and current trends in patenting activities with a view to understanding better and tracking the changing nature of science and technology in Iran. Materials and Methods: The patenting activity in Iran was investigated based on USPTO, WIPO, and Esp@cenet for the period 1976 - 2011. The researchers analyzed the affiliation of inventors, and collected patents having at least one Iranian inventor. The collected data were analyzed using Microsoft Excel. Results: results showed that between 1976 and 2011, 212 <b>patents</b> were <b>registered</b> by Iranian inventors in the above-mentioned three databases. The average number of Iranian <b>patents</b> <b>registered</b> per year increased significantly from 25 in 1976 - 1980 to 119 in 2006 - 2011. It {{should be noted that the}} highest number of <b>registered</b> <b>patents</b> (27 %) were in" chemistry, metallurgy" area of International Patent Classification, followed by "human necessities"(18 %), and "performing operations; transporting"(15 %). Conclusion: Overall, the proportion of Iranian inventors' <b>patents</b> <b>registered</b> in databases is small. However, the figure shows a growth for the years under study. Iran's <b>patents</b> <b>registered</b> in databases have considerable subject concentration. Scientific areas are growing together, and there is more potential of research work and innovation in areas of "chemistry, metallurgy", "Electricity" and "human needs"...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Patent {{registrations}} {{have often}} {{been used as a}} proxy of innovation as they reflect a country’s technological capability. Recently, some studies have found that the Generalised Autoregressive Conditional Heteroscedasticity (GARCH) model and an asymmetric extension, namely Glosten, Jagannathan and Runkle's (GJR) model, are useful to model the time-varying volatility of the patent ratio, namely the ratio of foreign <b>patents</b> <b>registered</b> in the USA to total patents in the USA. However, this approach assumes that the conditional variance is independent across countries. Furthermore, the time series properties of the patent growth rate, namely the rate of change of foreign <b>patents</b> <b>registered</b> in the USA, have not previously been analysed.

40|$|Background:Innovations in {{vascular}} and endovascular surgery {{have important}} {{social and economic}} repercussions. Most endovascular devices used in Brazil are imported and, therefore, particularly expensive. Objective:To conduct a retrospective analysis of patent and regulatory approval data for newly developed vascular and endovascular devices, {{based on the number}} of <b>patents</b> <b>registered</b> at the Brazilian National Industrial Property Institute (INPI) and the number of products approved by the National Health Surveillance Agency (ANVISA) over recent years. Methods:This retrospective study involved electronic searches of the INPI (www. inpi. gov. br) and ANVISA websites (www. anvisa. gov. br), for <b>patents</b> <b>registered</b> and products approved between January 1997 and December 2012. Results:The keywords used for the search ("catheter(s)," "stent(s)," "graft(s)," and "wound dressing(s) ") returned a total of 701 new <b>patents</b> <b>registered</b> during the period studied. Thirty-four percent (n= 237) of these were patents for wound dressings, while the remaining 66 % (n= 464) were for devices used in endovascular surgery.
