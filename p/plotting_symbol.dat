They are useful for data where a conventional scatterplot is difficult to read due to overstriking of the <b>plot</b> <b>symbol.</b> The x – y plane is subdivided into a lattice of small, regular, hexagonal bins. These bins are divided into low-, medium-, and high-density groups. In low-density bins, the individual observations are plotted as in a conventional scatterplot. Medium- and high-density bins contain light and dark sunflowers, respectively. In a light sunflower, each petal represents one observation. In a dark sunflower, each petal represents a specific number of observations. The user can control the sizes and colors of the sunflowers. By selecting appropriate colors and sizes for the light and dark sunflowers, plots can be obtained that give both the overall sense of the data-density distribution, {{as well as the}} number of data points in any given region. Sunflower plots are also contrasted with contour plots of bivariate kernel- density estimates. The appearance of these plots is markedly affected by the choice of smoothing parameters and the spacing of points at which the probability density function is evaluated.

The choice {{is determined by the}} BAR, SPIKE, CHARACTER, and LINE commands. The switches for these commands work independently so that a plot point can be any combination of these (or even none of them). The BAR switch is most commonly used to generate bar charts. The following types of bar charts are commonly used in business and presentation graphics: 1. Standard bar charts (a bar is drawn from the data point to the X axis); 2. Grouped bar charts (bars are drawn for 2 or more groups of data); 3. Stacked (or divided) bar charts (the bar is divided into several intervals). All of these formats are possible using DATAPLOT. At least one example of each of these formats is given in the PROGRAM section. DATAPLOT provides commands to control the various aspects of the bar (see the RELATED COMMANDS section). Many of these are also demonstrated with the sample programs. Many analysts prefer that bar charts be drawn vertically rather than horizontally.

40|$|Forest plots are {{frequently}} used {{to display the}} results of meta-analyses and {{have been published in}} the medical literature since 1988 (Lewis & Clarke, 2001). A review of forest plots reveals that the format chosen can affect the accuracy with which the information is conveyed to the reader. One formatting convention is the use of symbol areas to reflect the relative contributions, or weights, of the studies included in the analysis. Typically a study with a larger weight is represented by a symbol with a proportionately larger area. The use of symbol areas to convey study weights is not optimal for a number of reasons. First, it is difficult for viewers to accurately decode symbol areas to enable a visual comparison of study weights. Second, as symbol areas increase in size they can obscure other information on the plot. Third, if a logarithmic scale is used, studies with equal weights should, but often do not, have symbols with the same physical dimensions. This issue becomes more apparent as the difference in effect sizes increases. The macro used to generate the figures in this paper provides SAS ® software users with an easy to use program to produce high-resolution forest plots. It will generate forest <b>plots</b> where <b>symbol</b> widths represent study weights, but it will also generate traditional forest <b>plots</b> where <b>symbol</b> areas represent study weights. Regardless of the symbol format or type of scale being used, symbols representing studies of equal weight will have the same dimension anywhere on the plot...|$|R
40|$|Cluster {{analysis}} is commonly applied to microarray data {{in order to}} find groups of co-expressed genes where cluster algorithms with the ability to visualize the resulting cluster objects (e. g., a dendrogram for hierarchical clustering) are usually preferred. The display of cluster solutions particularly for a large number of clusters is very important in exploratory data analysis. It gives practitioners an idea of the relationships between segments of a partition and allows to interpret the cluster results. Neighborhood graphs (Leisch, 2006) can be used for visual assessment of the cluster structure of centroid-based cluster solutions. In a neighborhood graph each node represents a cluster and two nodes are connected if there exist data points that have the two corresponding centroids as closest and second closest centroid. In this work we present new visualization methods based on the neighborhood graph. For node representation different <b>plot</b> <b>symbols</b> visualizing single clusters are used allowing a quick overview of the data. On the one hand the corresponding data points themselves can be visualized using for example line diagrams for gene expression over time. On the other hand node symbols like pie charts can be used to visualize further properties of the clusters like association to functional groups under study. Finally the neighborhood graph can be used for the validation of a cluster solution, e. g., by testing the relationship between a clustering and a priori information about gene functions. All visualization methods and test procedures used are implemented in R package gcExplorer (Scharl and Leisch, 2009) which is now available on CRAN.

(Space and the Two-Crown Coin: Karin Boye’s För lite and {{the debate}} on authors’ social circum­stances.) Karin Boye’s (1900 – 1941) novel För lite (1936) [Too Little] depicts a writer who has failed his early promise as a {{literary}} author. To provide {{for his wife and}} two sons, he has relegated himself to a producer of popular fiction. The article begins with an examination of how Boye uses <b>plot,</b> <b>symbols,</b> psychology and references to the contemporary literary field to discuss the social and intellectual roles of different kinds of artists. The novel has often been read as a veiled piece of literary autobiography, and the article moves on to an examination of Boye’s own literary career. Although Boye had temporary dif­ficulties in supporting herself solely by writing, there are many differences between her and the protagonist in För lite. Boye graduated as a school-teacher in the 1920 s, but after a brief period of teaching she soon became a professional writer. In the early 1930 s, Boye was forced to occasional reviewing and even writing of popular stories, but her main output was literary fiction, which made her an esteemed author, published by the prestigious Bonnier’s publishing house {{and a member of the}} distinguished literary academy Samfundet De Nio [Academy of the Nine]. She supplemented the remuneration for her own books with translation fees, but an important part of her income came from literary awards and grants (a general feature for liter­ary authors of her days). As exactly as possible, her literary incomes from various sources are calculated, grants roughly equivalating the remunerations from her books, grants and remu­nerations both each giving her double the income from her translations. The possibility of receiving such grants is conspicuously absent in the literary world of För lite. In fact, the novel may be read as an attempt of promulgating the necessity of such grants. During the 1930 s, Karin Boye took an active part in the campaign launched by Sveriges Förfat­tareförening [The Swedish Association of Authors] for giving authors compensation for the use of their books in public libraries. The gloomy representation of the writer’s conditions in För lite is perfectly consistent with arguments in this campaign. The article concludes with information on Karin Boye’s work in Sveriges Författarefören­ing and Samfundet De Nio (the later with the main objective of dispensing literary grants and awards), and on her posthumous success as an author. The vast differences between her own literary career and that of the protagonist in För lite is stressed, maintaining that the novel is neither realistic nor mainly psychological, but an attempt to stir up debate.

40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} Symbol Error Rate (SER) -simulation of {{wireless}} communications and its application into throughput analysis of UltraWideband (UWB) systems. The SERs will be simulated in C++ using the Monte Carlo method and when some are calculated, {{the rest will}} be estimated using a novel extrapolation method. These SER values will be very accurate and in this thesis go as low as 1. 0 e- 14. Reaching that low values would otherwise be impossible using the traditional Monte Carlo method, because of very large computation time. However, the novel extrapolation method, can simulate a SER-curve in less than 30 seconds. It is assumed that the noise belongs to the Generalized Gaussian distribution family and among them noise from the Normal distribution (Gaussian noise) gives the best result. It is to be noted that Gaussian noise is {{the most commonly used}} in digital communication simulations. Although the program is used for throughput analysis of UWB, the program could easily be adapted to various signals. In this thesis, throughput analysis means a <b>plot</b> with <b>symbol</b> rate vs distance. From any given symbols, the user can, with a desired minimum SER, generate an extrapolated SER-curve and see what symbol rate can be achieved by the system, while obeying power constraints of signals imposed by international laws. The developed program is, by comparing with published theoretical results, tested for QAM and PSK cases, but can easily be extended to UWB systems...|$|R
40|$|Zimbabwean author Yvonne Vera's {{fiction is}} radical in its {{disruption}} of the conventional form of the novel. Her writing style rejects linear <b>plot</b> structures, consistent <b>symbols</b> and conventional resolutions to the narrative crisis. The textile, commonly associated with {{the realm of the}} domestic which has consumed the energies of women's lives in Africa and around the world, is a recurring presence. The textile is perhaps a particularly useful motif to consider in light of the female centred experiences of rape, abortion, infanticide, and incest which are the focus of Vera's narratives. This chapter explores the use of the quilt as a structure within Vera's fictions and argues that the fragments of cloth that appear throughout Vera's fiction can be understood as a distinct aspect of Veras textual style, a style that does not shy away from the fragmented realities her characters endure. Through fragments of cloth, Vera evokes an alternative voice which speaks in familiar, albeit disrupted, patterns...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this essay is to analyze the {{symbolism}} in the book Mornas eram as noites (Warm were the nights), by Cape-Verdean writer Dina Sa­lústio, and propose a thematic typology to the short stories, relating it {{to the topic of}} voyage. In the thirty-five narratives, we note that are common themes in some of them, such as: leaving and returning; the female condi­tion; family relations; poverty and necessity; memory; (domestic and so­cial) violence. In the same way, we perceived that are differentiated female characters, representing a broad view of all social classes and different ages. Most of the stories are narrated in the first person, which makes the reader closer to the narrator and functions as a call for an accomplice to the reader by the narrator. We also observed that the night appears in many <b>plots</b> as a <b>symbol</b> of transformation, as seen in the subtitle of the work: “ [...] . De como elas se entregam aos dias” (Of how they deliver themselves to the days. Likewise, we can see the dubiety in the subtitle that can refer not only to the nights (in the title) but also to the female characters presented in the stories. </p...|$|R
40|$|This study {{discusses}} {{the extent to}} which Charles Sturridge's Where Angels Fear to Tread, Merchant Ivory's Howards End, and David Lean's A Passage to India have aimed at, and succeeded in, exploring the thematic concerns of E. M. Forster's novels. A brief introductory chapter explains the motivation behind this research, and the choice of critical methodologies used. It concludes with an outline of some of the problems confronting film-makers wishing to explore the concerns of novels. The first chapter, which is devoted to Where Angels Fear to Tread, reveals that while Sturridge is "faithful" to Forster's novel at a superficial level, basing most of his scenes on, and taking most of his dialogue directly from, the text, he does not explore Forster's themes. The facility with which film tells stories proves to be a treacherous trap for Sturridge. His version of Where Angels Fear to Tread is totally vacuous because he failed to develop anything beyond the story [...] Forster's "tapeworm" of time (Aspects of the NoyeI 41). The causality that Forster calls plot seemed beyond Sturridge's comprehension, leaving his film little more than an endless progression of "and then[s]" (Forster, Aspects 87). Characters are not given their full weight; symbols and leitmotifs are overlooked; the allegorical elements he did recognize, he failed to understand, and thus misplaced, so that the epiphanic moments of the novel are lost. There is no possibility of thematic concerns emerging from a film in which <b>plot,</b> characterization, <b>symbol</b> and rhythm are ignored. Sturridge's apparent inability to understand his source is in stark contrast to Merchant Ivory's sensitivity to Howards End, and their evident familiarity with literary criticism on the work. Chapter two explores the way in which their adaptation smooths out putative flaws in characterization and plot, and uses filmic rhythm and camera work to suggest comments made by the novel's narrator. Almost wholly successful in developing the novel's themes, Merchant Ivory's Howards End does not, however, successfully explore the spiritual dimensions of Forster's novel. Film is a medium capable of great subtlety, but its strength lies in its ability to capture the seen; the unseen tends to evade its grasp. It is in dealing with the unseen that Lean's A Passage to India misses greatness, for in virtually every other respect his version of Forster's masterpiece is superb. Chapter three explores Lean's creative and flexible approach to adaptation, his acute sensitivity to the differing demands of film and novel, and his confident technical mastery. It also explores, however, the emptiness at the heart of his film, an emptiness that is the result of his trivialization of the spiritual concerns of Forster's novel...|$|R
