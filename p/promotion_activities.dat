40|$|The {{effects of}} inhibitors of arachidonic acid {{metabolism}} and antioxidants on the rat liver tumor <b>promotion</b> <b>activity</b> of phenobarbital (PB) were assessed using the enzyme-altered focus as the end-point lesion. Fischer 344 male rats were initiated with iV-nitrosodiethylamine (200 mg/kg) and then divided into five groups placed on basal diet, diet containing 0. 05 % PB, diet containing 0. 05 % PB plus 0. 75 %, 1 % or 1. 5 % levels of various inhibitors of arachidonic acid metabolism or antioxidants, or diet containing 1 % or 1. 5 % inhibitors or antioxidants alone for 10 weeks, and then killed. />-Bromo-phenacyl bromide, an inhibitor of phospholipase A 2, signifi-cantly inhibited the <b>promotion</b> <b>activity</b> of PB at dose levels of 0. 75 % and 1. 5 %, reaching plateau at 0. 75 %. Both quercetin, an inhibitor of lipoxygenase, and morin, a dual inhibitor of lipoxygenase-cyclooxygenase, significantly reduced the <b>promotion</b> <b>activity</b> of PB at the 1. 5 % but not 0. 75 % dose levels. Moreover, acetylsancyhc acid, an inhibitor of cyclooxygenase dose-dependently inhibited the <b>promotion</b> <b>activity</b> of PB. Among the antioxidants investigated, vitamin E did not affect, but n-propyl gallate and ethoxyquin exerted a dose-dependent inhibition of PB promotion. These results are strongly suggestive of an involvement of phospholipase A 2, lipoxygenase and cyclooxygenase arachidonic acid metabolic pathways in the mechanisms underlying PB enhancement of hepatocarcinogenesis...|$|R
25|$|In {{addition}} to increased involvement and commitment, {{the central government}} has increased funding for public health from $835 million in 2002 to $1·44 billion in 2004. Over this period, the proportion of total CDC funding provided by the government increased from 40·7% to 47·1%, reversing a downward trend. The central government increased funding for four priority communicable diseases in particular—HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, schistosomiasis, and hepatitis B. Tuberculosis funding {{increased by more than}} seven times during this period (reaching $36 million in 2005) and contributed to 26% of the total funding available for the national tuberculosis control program in 2005. The additional funding has been used to expand health <b>promotion</b> <b>activities,</b> to provide financial incentives to village workers to find and treat tuberculosis, and to provide free treatment for people with smear-negative pulmonary tuberculosis for the first time.|$|E
25|$|The US FTT bills {{proposed}} by Rep. Peter DeFazio (D-Oregon) and Sen. Harkin (D-Iowa) {{have received a}} number of cosponsors in the Senate and House. The Let Wall Street Pay for the Restoration of Main Street Bill is {{an early version of}} their cosponsored US FTT bill which includes a tax on US financial market securities transactions. The bill suggests to tax stock transactions at a rate of 0.25%. The tax on futures contracts to buy or sell a specified commodity of standardized quality at a certain date in the future, at a market determined price would be 0.02%. Swaps between two firms and credit default swaps would be taxed 0.02%. The tax would only target speculators, since the tax would be refunded to average investors, pension funds and health savings accounts. Projected annual revenue is $150 billion per year, half of which would go towards deficit reduction and half of which would go towards job <b>promotion</b> <b>activities.</b> The day the bill was introduced, it had the support of 25 of DeFazio's House colleagues.|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigated}} parental attitudes toward child exposure to alcohol, nicotine (smoking tobacco) and gambling, via a questionnaire that examined parental tolerance {{with regard to}} hypothetical scenarios of exposure and participation, alongside perceptions {{of the importance of}} associated health <b>promotion</b> for each <b>activity.</b> It was hypothesised that parents would indicate significantly less tolerance of, and rate health <b>promotion</b> <b>activity</b> of greater importance for, nicotine and alcohol in comparison to gambling. Results from a sample of 500 UK based parents, showed significantly less tolerance for nicotine versus alcohol and gambling in all hypothetical scenarios of exposure and direct participation. Parents also reported significantly less tolerance surrounding child consumption of alcohol than gambling. Health <b>promotion</b> <b>activity</b> surrounding nicotine was rated significantly more important than that of alcohol and gambling. It is argued that greater parental concern surrounding nicotine was attributable to increased availability of knowledge surrounding associated risks of smoking behaviour within existing regulation and health <b>promotion</b> <b>activity.</b> Arguments are made for increased public awareness of the potential harms that may be associated with gambling behaviour, which may assist parents in making informed decisions regarding their children’s exposure to and participation in gambling-related activities...|$|R
40|$|An {{in vitro}} assay was used to study the growth-promotional {{activity}} of human milk (HM), cow's milk (CM), and whey and casein fractions of HM and CM for five strains of Bifidobacterium species isolated originally from stools of human infants. Whey- and casein-predominant CM-based infant formulas were studied as well. When compared on an equivalent protein basis, the growth <b>promotion</b> <b>activity</b> of HM was {{greater than that of}} CM for Bifidobacterium bifidum serovar pennsylvanicus and Bifidobacterium longum but comparable for B. bifidum, Bifidobacterium infantis, and Bifidobacterium breve. Pasteurization of HM and CM resulted in an increase of growth <b>promotion</b> <b>activity</b> for B. bifidum serovar pennsylvanicus and B. bifidum, a decrease for B. infantis, and no change for B. longum and B. breve. The growth <b>promotion</b> <b>activity</b> of HM whey was slightly higher than that of HM casein for four strains of bifidobacteria. When CM casein was a substrate, virtually no growth occurred for B. bifidum serovar pennsylvanicus, B. bifidum, B. infantis, and B. longum. The growth <b>promotion</b> <b>activity</b> of CM whey, however, was similar to that of HM whey. A similar trend was observed for CM-based infant formula. Whey-dominant formulas promoted better growth of B. bifidum serovar pennsylvanicus, B. bifidum, and B. infantis than casein-dominant formulas. The data suggest a direct relationship between amount of whey-specific factors and the ability to promote growth of clinically relevant strains of Bifidobacterium species by HM, CM, and CM-based infant formulas...|$|R

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{qualitative}} {{study was to explore}} the views of health professionals on the current and future provision of physical <b>activity</b> <b>promotion</b> within routine diabetes care. Responses were collected from participants (n= 23) in two phases. An online survey (Phase 1, n= 16) and semi-structured interviews (Phase 2, n= 7) were used to explore the experiences of health professionals on the provision of physical <b>activity</b> <b>promotion.</b> Qualitative responses were analysed using Interpretative phenomenological analysis and categorised into themes and sub-themes. Three main themes were identified: (1) current physical <b>activity</b> <b>promotion</b> practices; (2) delivery of physical <b>activity</b> <b>promotion</b> by health professionals; and (3) future physical <b>activity</b> <b>promotion.</b> Findings demonstrated that a lack of structure for physical <b>activity</b> <b>promotion</b> and ineffective behaviour change training made physical <b>activity</b> <b>promotion</b> within routine diabetes care challenging. Health professionals struggled to prioritise physical activity within routine consultations. They were clinically driven to provide physical activity advice to patients; however, they lacked the skills to elicit significant behaviour change. Five recommendations were presented to improve physical <b>activity</b> <b>promotion</b> within diabetes care: (1) having a key member of staff responsible for physical activity promotion; (2) access to a referral route for physical activity support; (3) inclusion of diabetes-specific information in behaviour change training; (4) linking the delivery of physical <b>activity</b> <b>promotion</b> with clinical outcomes; and (5) using ‘champions’ to raise the profile of physical activity within the health service. Incorporation of these recommendations by health professionals and health boards may significantly improve the provision of physical <b>activity</b> <b>promotion</b> within routine diabetes care...|$|R

30|$|Strain PF 1 {{exhibits}} potent keratinolytic {{activity and}} can efficiently degrade 10  g/l chicken feathers under submerged cultivation with 81.4  ±  4.40 U/ml keratinase activity. Different concentrations of feathers supported {{the production of}} indole acetic acid by strain PF 1. Strain PF 1 produces maximum indole acetic acid (46.2  ±  0.21  µg/ml) {{in the presence of}} 2.0  % feathers at 120  h of incubation. The indole acetic acid production was confirmed by thin-layer chromatography and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopic analysis. However, increased concentration of feathers exhibited negative effect on phosphate solubilization due to increased alkalinity. HCN production also exhibited positive correlation with concentration of feathers. Finally, plant growth of Vigna radiata in the presence of strain PF 1 with chicken feathers in soil was investigated, which showed good plant growth <b>promotion</b> <b>activity.</b> Increased ratio of C/N in soil also supported the plant growth <b>promotion</b> <b>activity</b> of feathers.|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to examine}} critically whether contemporary approaches to health promotion {{have the potential to}} influence trends in breastfeeding. A selection of data relating to the practice of breastfeeding and current health <b>promotion</b> <b>activity,</b> in conjunction with a literature review forms the basis for this analysis. A comprehensive understanding of the activity of breastfeeding is achieved by analysing the scientific evidence relating to breastfeeding, identifying the patterns of breastfeeding and determining the factors that affect the activity. This analysis provides the basis for further investigation. Using the WHO/Ottawa Charter (1986) framework of health promotion both the current concept of health promotion, and current health <b>promotion</b> <b>activity</b> are examined in relation to the practice of breastfeeding The analysis reveals that, paradoxically, fewer women are breastfeeding at a time when scientific evidence is increasingly supportive of breastfeeding. Social factors (such as work and family support), the availability of infant formula and inadequate health professional support have all affected breastfeeding trends. The issue of empowerment as the 'key principle' of all health <b>promotion</b> <b>activity</b> has important implications for the health promoter in that it requires him/her to work in a fundamentally different way. Examining the proposed strategies in the Ottawa Charter (1986) demonstrates that he/she needs different skills, while the implications that empowering strategies would not necessarily increase the number of women who breastfeed, when targets have been set to increase their number to 75...|$|R
