40|$|Â© 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd. Aim: To {{examine the}} {{internal}} and external responsiveness of the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (<b>PUSH)</b> <b>tool</b> for assessing the healing progress in acute and chronic wounds. Background: It is important to establish the responsiveness of instruments used in conducting wound care assessments to ensure that they are able to capture changes in wound healing accurately over time. Design: Prospective longitudinal observational study. Method: The key study instrument was the <b>PUSH</b> <b>tool.</b> Internal responsiveness was assessed using paired t-testing and effect size statistics. External responsiveness was assessed using multiple linear regression. All new patients with at least one eligible acute or chronic wound, enrolled in the Nurse and Allied Health Clinic-Wound Care programme between 1 December 2012 - 31 March 2013 were included for analysis (N = 541). Results: Overall, the <b>PUSH</b> <b>tool</b> was able to detect statistically significant changes in wound healing between baseline and discharge. The effect size statistics were large. The internal responsiveness of the <b>PUSH</b> <b>tool</b> was confirmed in patients with a variety of different wound types including venous ulcers, pressure ulcers, neuropathic ulcers, burns and scalds, skin tears, surgical wounds and traumatic wounds. After controlling for age, gender and wound type, subjects in the 'wound improved but not healed' group had a smaller change in PUSH scores than those in the 'wound healed' group. Subjects in the 'wound static or worsened' group had the smallest change in PUSH scores. The external responsiveness was confirmed. Conclusion: The internal and external responsiveness of the <b>PUSH</b> <b>tool</b> confirmed that {{it can be used to}} track the healing progress of both acute and chronic wounds.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{investigate}} {{the effectiveness of}} an innovative electrical stimulation (ES) therapy as adjuvant treatment for chronic wounds of various aetiology, in terms of pain and ulcer healing. METHOD: Patients with chronic limb ulcers were enrolled for the study and randomised into the intervention or control group. The intervention group received conventional treatment plus ES therapy (FREMS; Lorenz Lifetech) while the control group received only conventional treatment. Each ES treatment cycle consisted of 12 sessions performed in 4 weeks (three sessions/week). All patients were treated until full wound healing occurred, or for a maximum of 9 ES cycles, with a 2 -week rest between each cycle. RESULTS: A total of 60 patients {{were enrolled in the}} study and randomised into the two groups: the intervention group (n= 30) and the control group (n= 30). During follow-up, some patients terminated the protocol because they reached the ulcer closure before the maximum of 9 cycles. The analysis of the effect of ES on pain and ulcer healing was performed on all patients who underwent at least two consecutive clinical evaluations (two cycles), in order to reach a compatible sample size with the primary objective (one patient withdrew). In both groups, there was a significant reduction of pain compared with baseline (p < 0. 05), starting from T 6 visit in the first cycle. In particular, there was a significant reduction of pain in the intervention group compared with the control group after 14 days, and this reduction continued {{until the end of the}} second cycle. Similarly, there was a significant reduction of <b>PUSH</b> <b>tool</b> score in the intervention group compared with the control group after 14 days, and this reduction continued until the end of the second cycle. CONCLUSION: Data collected in this study support data in the literature. Analysis of longitudinal data analysed by simple models and complex models suggest that the ES therapy had a positive and significant effect on pain reduction (VAS) and on the improvement of ulcer healing process in terms of the <b>PUSH</b> <b>tool</b> total index compared with conventional treatment, and may have induced a significant acceleration of the wound-healing process...|$|E
40|$|Aims : The {{purposes}} of this study were to compare the efTects of polaprezinc and zinc chloride on serum zinc and copper concentrations in elderly bedridden patients receiving enteral nutrition, and to examine the efTects of polaprezinc on pressure ulcer healing in those patients. Methods : Seven elderly bedridden patients receiving enteral nutrition entered into a crossover study of 2 -week treatment periods with polaprezinc or zinc chloride, separated by a 4 week washout period. Serum zinc and copper concentra- tions were compared between both treatment periods. Then, another five elderly patients with pressure ulcers were treated with polaprezinc for 8 weeks. The assessment of pressure ulcers was made weekly using the <b>PUSH</b> <b>tool</b> 3. 0. Results: After 2 weeks, polaprezinc significantly increased serum zinc concentrations, decreased serum copper/zinc ratios, but did not change serum copper concentrations. Zinc chloride did not change these three parameters. Polaprezinc also produced a significant improve- ment in PUSH score and a reduction of 81 96 in ulcer area after 8 weeks. Conclusion: The efficiency of absorption of zinc from polaprezinc may be much higher than that from zinc chloride in elderly bedridden patients receiving enteral nutrition. Polaprezinc may also have a beneficial efTect on pressure ulcer healing in those patients...|$|E

40|$|The Savannah River Site (SRS) {{is located}} in the Atlantic Coastal Plaingeologic province. This area is {{characterized}} by low relief, predominantly unconsolidated sediments of Cretaceous though Tertiary age. A multiple aquifer system underlies the A/M Area and affects the definition and distribution of a contaminant plume. The water table and uppermost confined aquifer (Steed Pond Aquifer) are contaminated with elevated concentrations of trichloroethylene(TCE) and tetrachloroethylene (PCE) and their associated compounds. The deeper aquifers in this area have less widely spread chlorinated hydrocarbon contamination. Cone penetrometer testing was selected as the method of investigation because it is minimally invasive, offers advanced technological capabilities in gathering lithologic data, and offers groundwater sampling capabilities. CPT testing utilizes a hydraulic <b>push</b> <b>tool</b> system. The probe collects real-time data that is processed by computer into soil/lithology classifications. The system {{can also be used to}} collect sediment and soil vapor samples although these features were not utilized during this project.

40|$|Pressure ulcers are {{a common}} and costly problem in acute care facilities. One of the most {{challenging}} aspects of care is establishing and maintaining a moist wound environment to promote wound healing. Since the moist wound healing theory was introduced, numerous advanced wound care products and dressings have become available. The {{purpose of this study is}} to compare four dressings: a hydrocolloid dressing to a traditional saline-gauze dressing, a foam dressing, and a hydrogel dressing. Dressings will be evaluated for performance in wound healing and cost effectiveness in the treatment of pressure ulcers in an acute care setting. This quasi-experimental study will be guided by Roy's Adaptation Model. Patients admitted to acute care facilities with Stage II and Stage III pressure ulcers will be enrolled in the study after consent obtained. It is estimated that 80 patients will be alternately assigned to one of the four treatment groups; the hydrocolloid, traditional saline-gauze, foam, or hydrogel. Wound healing characteristics will be analyzed using the Pressure Ulcer Scale for Healing (<b>PUSH</b> <b>Tool),</b> andcost effectiveness of each dressing will be analyzed by data collected on dressing cost, number of dressing changes and nursing time. Permission will be obtained from Ball State University and the participating institutions. The findings will provide information on an effective treatment modality for pressure ulcer wound healing.

40|$|Abstract—This work {{deals with}} {{problems}} of tool axis inclination angles in ball-end milling. Tool axis inclination angle contributes to improvement of functional surface properties (surface integrity-surface roughness, residual stress, micro hardness, etc.), decreasing cutting forces and improving production. By milling with ball-end milling tool, using standard way of cutting, when work piece and cutting tool contain right angle, we have zero cutting speed on edge. At this point cutting <b>tool</b> only <b>pushes</b> material {{into the work}} piece. Here we can observe the following undesirable effects- chip contraction, increasing of cutting temperature, increasing vibrations or creation of built-up edge. These effects have negative results – low quality of surface and decreasing of tool life (in the worse case even it is pinching out). These effects can be eliminated with the tilt of cutting tool or tilt of work piece. Very important is direction of feed. If the feed is designated as pulled, the tool runs silently, and also the surface of work piece improves, as opposed to <b>pushed</b> <b>tool</b> [5]. These two ways {{can be used with}} the tool axis inclination angle in feed direction and also in pick feed direction. Also using climb milling or conventional milling has big influence on surface quality and on tool life. Keywords—CAD/CAM system, tool axis inclination angle, ballend milling, surface roughness, cutting forces. I. MILLING BY MEANS OF THE TOLL AXIS INCLINATION ANGLE Thanks to tilt of cutting tool we can change effective diameter of cutting tool and with it also effective cutting speed. Effective tool diameter (without tilt of cutting tool) can be calculated according to this mathematical expression: d 2 (d- a) eff = ⋅ a [mm] (1) p p Where: ap axial depth of cut [mm], d tool diameter [mm], deff effective tool diameter [mm]. Effective diameter of pulled cutting tool is calculated according to this mathematical expression [2]: ⎡ ⎛ d- 2 a ⎤ p ⎞ d = d ⋅ sin ⎢arccos ⎟ + β eff f ⎥ [mm] ⎝ d ⎠ ⎥...|$|R
