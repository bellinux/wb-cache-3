40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{appraise}} various types of phosphate fertilizers (bone meal, superphosphate, triple superphosphate, and <b>potassium</b> <b>orthophosphate)</b> for immobilizing metals and metalloids in mining-impacted soils from Broken Hill, Australia. Soils were rich in metals (Pb, Zn, Cu, and Cd) and metalloids (As and Sb) which were mainly contained in minor to trace amounts of coronadite [PbMn 8 O 16], kintoreite [PbFe 3 (PO 4) 2 (OH,H 2 O) 6], Pb, and Zn sulfides and sulfates (possibly sphalerite, galena, and anglesite) as well as in unidentified soluble metal-bearing phases. Phosphate stabilization experiments were conducted as kinetic column leaching experiments, and chemical and mineralogical changes were assessed using elemental, sulfur isotope, and XRD analyses as well as electron microprobe phase mapping. The application of phosphate fertilizer to the metal-contaminated topsoils led to mineralogical changes, including the formation of secondary metal-bearing phosphates. The elemental concentrations of leachates were used as a criterion to assess the performance of phosphate treatments. <b>Potassium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> fertilizer was the most effective amendment for Cd stabilization; superphosphate and triple superphosphate fertilizers were the most effective amendments for Pb stabilization. By contrast, the release of As, Cu, Mn, Sb, and Zn were not significantly suppressed, and in several cases, increased, using bone meal, superphosphate, triple superphosphate, and <b>potassium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> amendments. This study indicates that in situ phosphate stabilization of mining-impacted soils at Broken Hill would most likely be a complex and impractical undertaking in residential areas due to the risk of substantial metal, metalloid, phosphate, and sulfate release...|$|R

Under these conditions, pH 6. 5, 6. 5 degrees C, 0. 10 M ionic strength <b>potassium</b> <b>orthophosphate,</b> the protein {{can be made to}} exist as a metastable 20 S aggregate that is necessary for efficient reconstitution. The overall assembly process consists of an initiation (nucleation) reaction that requires two to three 20 S disk aggregates per RNA molecule and is followed by an elongation (growth) reaction. In the elongation phase of assembly the 4 S protein is incorporated 50 to 70 times faster than the 20 S disk, calculated {{on the basis of a}} steady-state kinetic analysis. Therefore, under these conditions, in which the rate of assembly is about 0. 06 of that at pH 7, 20 degrees C, 0. 10 M ionic strength orthophosphate, the 4 S protein preferentially participates in the elongation phase.

40|$|Phosphate induced {{stabilisation}} {{has been}} used to create passive iron phosphate coatings on pyrite and pyrrhotite. The formation of solid phosphate coatings on sulfide grains thereby inhibits sulfide oxidation. The aims of the study were to determine whether phosphate induced stabilisation could control sulfide oxidation and metal mobility in partly oxidised, polymineralic, sulfidic mine wastes. Waste materials were obtained from the acid mine drainage generating, abandoned Montalbion silver mine site, far north Queensland, Australia. The waste consists of quartz, kaolinite/illite, sulfide minerals (galena, chalcopyrite, tetrahedrite, sphalerite, pyrite, arsenopyrite), and pre- and post-mining oxidation products (hydrated Fe, Cu, Pb and alkali mineral salts). SEM observations of waste material treated with <b>potassium</b> <b>orthophosphate</b> showed that metal, metal-alkali and alkali phosphate coatings developed on all sulfides (with the exception of tetrahedrite). The abundance of phosphate phases was dependant on the availability of cations in solution for complexation with the phosphate anion. In turn, the release of cations was dependent on sulfide oxidation or the dissolution of efflorescent mineral salts. Experiments aiming to dissolve these phosphate coatings – using a strongly oxidising solution – showed that the phosphate coatings remained stable, preventing acid generation and metal release. The results of this study demonstrate that liquid phosphate stabilisers can suppress sulfide oxidation and immobilise metals in partly oxidised, polymineralic mine wastes...|$|R

Our objectives were to investigate {{the effect of the}} initial loading ratio between liquid and biochar on nutrient removal, and to investigate the effect of combining biochar with clinoptilolite on nutrient and DOC removal efficiency. Increasing the initial loading ratios increased nutrient concentrations on biochar to 8. 61  mg NH 4 -N g − 1, 1. 95  mg PO 4 -P g − 1 and 13. 01  mg DOC g − 1, but resulted in decreasing removal efficiencies. The combination of biochar and clinoptilolite resulted in improved ammonium, potassium and DOC removal efficiencies compared to biochar alone, but did not significantly change PO 4 -P removal efficiencies. Removal efficiencies with combined sorbents were up to 67 % for ammonium, 58 % for DOC and 58 % for potassium. Clinoptilolite showed higher removal efficiencies compared to biochar alone, and combining clinoptilolite with biochar improved only total P removal efficiency.

Phosphatefertilizer (bovine bone meal, superphosphate, triple superphosphate, <b>potassium</b> <b>orthophosphate)</b> and pine bark (Pinus radiata) were applied to two soils (BH 1, BH 2) contaminated with mining waste. Both soils had near neutral to alkaline pH values, were sulfide- or sulfate-rich, and contained metal and metalloid at concentrations that pose high environmental risks (e. g., Pb = 1. 25 wt% and 0. 55 wt%, Zn = 0. 71 wt% and 0. 47 wt% for BH 1 and BH 2, respectively).

Vickers microhardness study shows higher mechanical stability in SR method grown crystals...|$|R

The method employed Hypersil Gold C 18 (250 mm x 4. 6 mm) column as stationary phase. The mobile phase consisted of 0. 65 % <b>potassium</b> dihydrogen <b>orthophosphate</b> (pH 6) and methanol in a ratio of 45 : 55 v/v. This system was found to give good resolution of meloxicam and its impurities A, D, C (retention time 4. 18, 5. 32, 7. 21, 9. 13 min respectively). Method was validated as per ICH guidelines, in the concentration range of 5 - 25 µg/ml at 361 nm. Key words: RP-HPLC, Meloxicam, Meloxicam’s impurities A, D, C. Introduction and Experimental: Meloxicam (MEL) (4 -hydroxy- 2 -methyl-N-(5 -methyl- 2 -thiazoly) - 2 H- 1, 2 -benzo-thiazine- 3 -carboxamide- 1, 1 dioxide) (C 14 H 13 N 3 O 4 S 2) is a potent non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug (NSAID) with a favorable COX-...|$|R
40|$|The polarographical {{behaviour}} of Mo (VI) in {{a supporting}} electrolyte composed of citric acid, <b>potassium</b> dihydrogen <b>orthophosphate</b> and <b>potassium</b> chloride was investigated. At pH 1, 6, Mo (VI) gives two waves with half‐wave electric tensions of ‐ 0, 17 V and — 0, 57 V vs S. C. E. The quantitative determination {{is based on}} the height of the second reduction wave which is proportional to the concentration of Mo (VI). Rounded maxima which appeared in certain cases are eliminated by addition of methylene blue or basic fuchsin. Cu (II), Bi (III), Pb (II), Zn (II), As (V), W, V, Ni (II), Co (II), Mn (II) and Zr (IV) do not interfere. Fe (III), when present in great quantity, must be eliminated. The wave of Cd (II) interfere. The method proposed was applied to the determination of Mo (VI) in steel samples. Copyright © 1965 Wiley‐VCH Verlag GmbH & Co. KGaA, WeinheimSCOPUS: ar. jinfo:eu-repo/semantics/publishe...|$|R
