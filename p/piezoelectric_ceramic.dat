40|$|We use a {{piezoelectric}} quartz tuning fork to calibrate {{the displacement of}} <b>ceramic</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> scanners which are widely employed in scanning probe microscopy. We measure the static piezoelectric response of a quartz tuning fork and find it to be highly linear, non-hysteretic and with negligible creep. These performance characteristics, close to those of an ideal transducer, make quartz transducers superior to <b>ceramic</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> actuators. Furthermore, quartz actuators {{in the form of}} a tuning fork have the advantage of yielding static displacements comparable to those of local probe microscope scanners. We use the static displacement of a quartz tuning fork as a reference to calibrate the three axis displacement of a <b>ceramic</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> scanner. Although this calibration technique is a non-traceable method, it can be more versatile than using calibration grids because it enables to characterize the linear and non-linear response of a piezoelectric scanner in a broad range of displacements, spanning from a fraction of a nanometer to hundreds of nanometers. In addition, the creep and the speed dependent <b>piezoelectric</b> response of <b>ceramic</b> scanners can be studied in detail. Comment: 9 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|Conventional <b>ceramic</b> <b>piezoelectric</b> {{materials}} {{have been used}} in hydrophones for sonar applications since 1940 's. In the last few years since the discovery of polymeric piezoelectric hydrophones, the technology has matured, applications have emerged in extraordinary number of cases such as underwater navigation, biomedical applications, biomimetics, etc. Hydrophones are used underwater at high hydrostatic pressures. In the presence of hydrostatic pressures, the anisotropic <b>piezoelectric</b> response of <b>ceramic</b> materials is such that it has poor hydrophone performance characteristics whereas polymeric piezoelectric materials show enough hydrostatic piezoelectric coefficients. Moreover, piezoelectric polymers have low acoustic impedance, which is only 2 - 6 time that of water, whereas in piezoelectric ceramics, it is typically 11 -time greater than that of water. A close impedance match permits efficient transduction of acoustic signals in water and tissues. Newly developed hydrostatic-mode polyvinylidene flouride (PVDF) hydrophones use a pressure-release system to achieve improved sensitivity. Recently, voided PVDF {{materials have}} been used for making hydrophones having higher sensitivity and figure of merit than unvoided PVDF materials...|$|R

5000|$|Piezo-electric current therapy, or PECT, is an {{analgesic}} technique {{based on}} the principle that mechanical deformation of a motorized <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>ceramic</b> rod produces a burst of 10 electrical pulses (five positive and five negative), each lasting 2-3 ms. Each electrical burst lasts for 50 to 250 ms (depending on the motor speed set) and generates a current of approximately 25 mA. The application of PECT to the skin for 2 min produces a tolerable [...] "pricking" [...] pain sensation associated with a neurogenic inflammatory response lasting 3-4 h.

5000|$|An {{ultrasonically}} vibrating mill {{consists of}} two major components, a transducer and a sonotrode, attached to an electronic control unit with a cable. An electronic oscillator in the control unit produces an alternating current oscillating at a high frequency, usually between 18 and 40 kHz in the ultrasonic range. The transducer usually consists of a cylinder made of <b>piezoelectric</b> <b>ceramic.</b> The oscillating voltage is applied to electrodes attached to the transducer, which converts the electrical energy into mechanical vibrations. The transducer then vibrates the sonotrode at low amplitudes and high frequencies. [...] The sonotrode is usually made of low carbon steel. [...] A constant stream of abrasive slurry flows between the sonotrode and work piece. This flow of slurry allows debris to flow away from the cutting area. The slurry usually consists of water (20 to 60% by volume) and boron carbide, aluminum oxide and silicon carbide particles. [...] The sonotrode removes material from the work piece by abrasion where it contacts it, so the result of machining is to cut a perfect negative of the sonotrode's profile into the work piece. Ultrasonic vibration machining allows extremely complex and non-uniform shapes to be cut into the workpiece with extremely high precision.|$|E
