5|$|Conroy {{left the}} Flames {{as a free}} agent {{following}} the playoff run, opting to sign a four-year, US$12 million contract with the Los Angeles Kings. He later admitted that he did not truly wish to leave the Flames, but facing financial uncertainty with the 2004–05 NHL lockout looming, Conroy chose to accept the guaranteed contract. The lockout wiped out {{the first year of the}} deal, but he returned in 2005–06 to reach the 20-goal mark for the third time and 60 <b>points</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> second time in his career. During that season, he joined the United States national team for a second time, playing in the 2006 Winter Olympics. He appeared in six games, scoring one goal and five <b>points</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> eighth place Americans.|$|E

Points were also awarded to the top four riders at intermediate sprints, with five <b>points</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> winner of the sprint and three, two and one <b>points</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> riders in second, third and fourth places respectively. It was originally intended that points would not be awarded on stage 1 {{as it was a}} team time trial. After this was changed to an individual time trial, however, points were awarded on the stage, on the same scale as for an intermediate sprint. The winner of the points classification was awarded a red jersey.|$|E

5|$|Although {{he scored}} 129 <b>points</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> Warriors in 1986–87, Fleury's small stature led many teams {{to doubt that}} he could play in the NHL. The Calgary Flames drafted him in the 8th round, 166th overall, of the 1987 NHL Entry Draft. Upon {{completing}} his junior season in 1988, Fleury signed his first professional contract, worth C$415,000, and joined the Flames' International Hockey League (IHL) affiliate, the Salt Lake Golden Eagles. He scored seven points in two regular season games, then 16 more in eight playoff games as the Eagles won the Turner Cup championship.|$|E

In the current points system, points are awarded {{at the end of each}} rally to the top ten WRC (overall), junior and production car drivers that qualify as follows: 25, 18, 15, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1. Despite how many drivers are in one team, constructors can only nominate two drivers to score <b>points</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> team as well as scoring for themselves.|$|E

Over 200 cannon and gun ports were set within the walls, and the fort was essentially a firing platform, with a shape that allowed many lines of fire; its low curved bastions were designed to deflect cannonballs.|$|E

Polling {{in the final}} few weeks of the election suggested Brown had pulled ahead of Shaheen, with weekly polls by NH1 News, New England College, and Vox Populi showing Brown leading {{by a margin of}} 1–4 percentage <b>points</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> three consecutive weeks leading up to the election.|$|E
5|$|Sanchez {{once again}} {{put up the}} only <b>points</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> offense in another humiliating blowout, this time a 45-14 loss to the Detroit Lions.

Sanchez finished 19/27 for 199 yards with 2 touchdowns and no interceptions, which translated into a passer rating of 116.1.|$|E
