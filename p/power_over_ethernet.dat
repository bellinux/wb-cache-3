It operates at 48VDC and can supply more power (up to 12.95W, PoE+ 25.5W) over a cable up to 100meters compared to USB2.0, which provides 2.5W {{with a maximum}} cable length of 5meters. This has made PoE popular for VoIP telephones, security cameras, wireless access points, and other networked devices within buildings.

In {{addition to providing}} wireless connection speeds of up {{to a maximum of}} 54Mbit/s, it adds an external antenna port and a USB port.

The CPU is an AU1500-333MBC Alchemy (processor). A second model (...) lacking the modem and external antenna port was briefly made available, but then discontinued after the launch of AirPort Express (see below). On April 19, 2004, a third version, marketed as the AirPort Extreme Base Station (with <b>Power</b> <b>over</b> <b>Ethernet</b> and UL 2043), was introduced that supports <b>Power</b> <b>over</b> <b>Ethernet</b> and complies to the UL 2043 specifications for safe usage in air handling spaces, such as above suspended ceilings.

"With the {{evolution}} of PoE from a fairly low power source (up to 12.95 W per port) to one with devices of up to 25.5 W, the direct current (DC) <b>power</b> losses <b>over</b> <b>Ethernet</b> cables increased exponentially. Approximately 4.5 W/port of power is wasted on a CAT5, CAT5e, CAT6 or CAT6A cable...after 100 m... EEE typically saves no more than 1 W per link, so addressing the 4.5 W per link loss from PoE transmission inefficiency would provide much more incremental savings. New energy-efficient PoE (EEPoE) technology can increase efficiency to 94% while transmitting over the same 25 ohm cable, powering IEEE 802.3at-compliant devices in synchronous 4-pairs. When utilizing synchronous 4-pairs, powered devices are fed using all the available wires. For example, on a 24-port IEEE 802.3at-2009 Type 2 system (delivering 25.5 W per port), more than 50 W are saved." ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} the design and {{construction}} of the meteorological station. The meteorological station is designed and constructed {{to be able to}} measure the basic meteorological parameters (temperature, humidity, air pressure) and the other three variables (measuring rainfall, wind speed, wind direction). This thesis will introduce you to meteorology. Meteorology determines the daily weather forecast and the results are used for examples in aviation or maritime affairs. The method of atmospheric origin is given in the theoretical part. Meteorology must use measuring instruments to determine quantities. The dissertation also includes analysis of the measuring instruments. The meteorological station uses the Ethernet technology. In the chapter devoted to Ethernet are described its principles, types and method of <b>power</b> supply <b>over</b> <b>Ethernet.</b> The following section describes the design of the entire meteorological station, selection of all components and description of their connection.

40|$|At present, the {{designers}} of voltage converters {{can choose from}} a wide variety of custom integrated drivers operating at different principles. The authors of this paper aim to show that although the two different designs of a step-down voltage converters can achieve comparable nominal values, at least from the view of the user, due to the differences in the basic principles applied in their drivers they may exhibit different behaviour in the area of the electromagnetic compatibility. This can lead to considerable problems in design of more complex circuits these voltage converters are a part of. For the purposes of the hereby presented results, two different constructions of step-down converters have been chosen. The first one is based on a low-cost and randomly operating solution based on the driver MC 34063 while the second one employs more advanced driver marketed under the label AP 1501. Both converters were constructed and tested for the purposes of application in a power backup device for <b>Power</b> <b>over</b> the <b>Ethernet.</b> The nominal input voltage of both converters is 24 V while their nominal output voltage is 12 V, as used in common applications. Both converters were tested in the EMC laboratory of Tomas Bata University Zlin in order to obtain not only the static parameters, but also the information on how they can interfere with other electronic devices. Within this paper, the most interesting findings are published. © 2016, North Atlantic University Union. All rights Reserved...|$|R
