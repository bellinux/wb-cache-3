40|$|The {{patellofemoral}} joint {{tends to}} develop osteoarthritis {{due to the}} high rates of anatomical abnormalities and exposure to large weights through relatively small areas. The rate of isolated <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthrosis</b> is 11 % in men and 24 % in women above 55 years of age. This gender difference {{may be due to}} the more frequent presence of patellar aligment problems and dysplasia in women. Although, <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthrosis,</b> in general, is treated by conservative methods, surgery should be considered for patients who have failed to benefit from weight loss, physical therapy and drug treatment because the disease leads to pain and loss of function. In the surgical treatment of <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthrosis,</b> methods such as arthroscopic debride-ment, management of loads that affect the patella, cartilage grafting, patellar resurfacing, patellafemoral arthroplasty (PFA), total joint replacement and patellectomy can be used. However, PFA has not been widely used. The reasons were problems with the initial design, and mistakes in patient selection, but those were reduced recently and this has led to increasing interest in the PFA. The current indications of PFA comprise of patients with little or no malalignment, and young patients with isolated patellofemoral disease who were planned for patellectomy due to symptom severity.

40|$|The {{function}} and survival time of unicompartmental knee prostheses {{for patients with}} severe gonarthrosis have been improved {{the past few years}} by developments in their design, the instrumentarium and the surgical technique. A medial unicompartmental knee prosthesis may be indicated in patients with arthrosis of the medial tibiofemoral compartment. The prerequisites are an intact anterior cruciate ligament, an intact lateral compartment, a correctable varus axis and sufficient flexion in the knee. Contraindications are inflammatory arthropathies and a recent episode of septic arthritis. Relative contraindications are: old age, excess body weight, <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthrosis</b> and chondrocalcinosis. A unicompartmental knee prosthesis can be placed via a small parapatellar incision. The postoperative recovery is more rapid than following the classical open approach, while the knee function after 5 years is comparable. The knee function also seems better following a medial unicompartmental knee prosthesis than after valgusising tibial head osteotomy. The latter is still preferred for young active patients. Medial unicompartmental knee prostheses fail in 6 - 8 % of patients. Revision to a total knee prosthesis is then the treatment of choice. In the long term, unicompartmental prostheses with a mobile bearing become loose less often than comparable prostheses with a fixed bearing...|$|E
40|$|Introdução: A degeneração da articulação patelofemoral é uma patologia relativamente comum, ocorrendo em 5 % a 9 % dos pacientes com artrose isolada do joelho. Avanço progressivo do processo degenerativo acompanhado de dor, rigidez {{articular}} e considerável limitação funcional são achados comumente presentes, tornando-se, muitas vezes, necessária a adoção de intervenções cirúrgicas. O tratamento cirúrgico para pacientes jovens, apresentando estágio avançado de artrose isolada da articulação patelofemoral, permanece controverso. Diversas técnicas cirúrgicas, incluindo liberação do retináculo lateral, avanço da tuberosidade tibial, implante autólogo de condrócitos, patelectomia, artroplastia patelofemoral e artroplastia total do joelho têm sido empregadas, apresentando ampla variação nos índices de sucesso. Além disso, a rotina pós-operatória e a necessidade de imobilização e proteção do reparo, após alguns procedimentos, tendem a repercutir nos resultados funcionais finais e no retorno às atividades de vida diária. Não há solução perfeita para o tratamento cirúrgico da artrose patelofemoral isolada. As opções terapêuticas disponíveis até proporcionam resultados funcionais aceitáveis, mas os problemas inerentes a cada uma delas não podem ser considerados desprezíveis. Algumas das cirurgias sem implantes artificiais costumam comprometer, significativamente, a morfologia articular, com resultados estéticos bastante desconfortáveis, principalmente para pacientes do sexo feminino. As cirurgias com implantes, por outro lado, agregam um custo adicional significativamente alto, na forma do valor intrínseco desses implantes, já que os demais custos hospitalares são equivalentes aos procedimentos convencionais. Dessa forma, o desenvolvimento de um procedimento cirúrgico alternativo, capaz de promover alívio das queixas álgicas, melhora funcional, reabilitação precoce e resultado estético aceitável traria não somente grandes benefícios para os pacientes com artrose patelofemoral em estágios avançados de comprometimento articular, como também certo alívio para os gestores das secretarias municipais de saúde no que se refere ao alto custo dos implantes. Objetivo: Avaliar os resultados funcionais de pacientes com artrose patelofemoral submetidos a uma nova técnica cirúrgica, artroplastia de interposição retinacular. Material e Métodos: O estudo descreve uma série de 11 casos de pacientes com diagnóstico de artrose patelofemoral isolada, submetidos à artroplastia de interposição retinacular no Serviço de Ortopedia e Traumatologia do Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre, que foram avaliados quanto à função e movimento articular do joelho durante o pré e o pós-operatório. O tempo de seguimento pós-operatório foi de, no mínimo, 2 anos. A avaliação da função foi realizada utilizando-se a Escala de Atividades de Vida Diária para Análise do Joelho. As amplitudes de movimento de flexão e extensão do joelho foram mensuradas por meio de um goniômetro universal. Foram comparados os resultados obtidos durante o pré e pós-operatório. Resultados: Após um período médio de seguimento de 25, 9 meses (entre 24 e 29 meses), 10 dos 11 pacientes apresentaram melhora nos resultados funcionais. A média de escores da Escala de Atividades de Vida Diária para Análise do Joelho foi 34, 0 ± 12, 4 (IC 95 %= 25, 7 - 42, 3) antes da cirurgia e 55, 8 ± 11, 2 (IC 95 %= 48, 3 - 63, 4) após a cirurgia, apresentando uma melhora estatisticamente significativa (p< 0, 001). O paciente que não evidenciou melhora funcional pós-operatória apresentou progressão da artrose tibiofemoral e, após 2 anos de pós-operatório, foi submetido à artroplastia total do joelho. Não foi observado aumento estatisticamente significativo na amplitude de movimento de flexão e extensão do joelho após a cirurgia. Conclusão: A artroplastia de interposição retinacular proporcionou bons resultados funcionais em pacientes com artrose da articulação patelofemoral, podendo ser uma alternativa cirúrgica para pacientes jovens e de meia idade com processo degenerativo articular em estágio avançado. Introduction: The degeneration of the patellofemoral joint is {{a relatively}} common patology. Patellofemoral artrhosis occurs in between 5 % and 9 % of patients with knee arthrosis. The frequent clinical findings observed {{in the presence of}} progressive degenerative process are pain, joint stiffness, and considerable functional impairment, which many a time requires surgical intervention. Yet, in the case of young patients in an advanced stage of isolated <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthrosis,</b> surgical approaches to treatment are surrounded by controversy. Several surgical techniques have been employed to varying degrees of success, including lateral reticular release, advancement of tibial tuberosity, autologous chondrocyte implantation, patellectomy, patellofemoral arthroplasty and total knee arthroplasty. Besides, the different postoperative routines adopted, at times followed by periods of immobilization and protection of the surgical repair performed, tend to lead to different functional outcomes and to influence the resumption of daily living activities. There is no ideal solution to the surgical treatment of isolated <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthrosis.</b> The therapeutic alternatives available do indeed manage to produce acceptable outcomes, but the issues inherent to each choice cannot be ignored. Some surgical procedures that do not use artificial implantations usually compromise significantly the joint morphology, and follow-up involves undesired esthetic results, specially for female patients. Conversely, surgeries that use implantations impose rising additional costs expressed by the intrinsic values of the implantation, as the other hospital expenditures are equivalent to conventional medical procedures. Therefore, the development of an alternative surgical procedure that promotes pain relief, functional improvements, with an early rehabilitation and an acceptable esthetic result, would bring not only substantial benefits to patients who suffer from <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthrosis</b> with advanced commitment of the joint, but also a certain relief to health authorities as regards high implantation costs. Aim: To evaluate the functional outcomes of patients with <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthrosis</b> who underwent a new surgical technique, retinacular interposition arthroplasty. Materials and methods: The present study is a case series. Eleven patients with positive diagnosis for isolated <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthrosis</b> who underwent to retinacular interposition arthroplasty were evaluated in the Orthopedics and Traumatology Service of Hospital de Clínicas de Porto Alegre for function and articular range of motion of the knee during the preand postoperative period. Follow-up was at least 2 years. The evaluation of function was carried out using the Knee Outcome Survey Activities of Daily Living Scale. The range of flexion and extension motion were measured by means of a goniometer. Pre- and postoperative results were compared. Results: After an average follow-up period of 25. 9 months (between 24 and 29 months), 10 of the 11 patients showed improved functional outcomes. Average scores obtained by the Knee Outcome Survey Activities of Daily Living Scale was 34. 0 ± 12. 4 (CI 95 % = 25. 7 – 42. 3) before surgery and 55. 8 ± 11. 2 (CI 95 % = 48. 3 – 63. 4) after surgery, with a statistically significant improvement (P < 0. 001). One patient did not present any functional improvement, and presented a progression of the femorotibial arthrosis. Two {{years after the end of}} the postoperative period, the patient underwent total knee arthroplasty. No statistically significant increase was observed in motion of knee flexion and extension after the surgery. Conclusion: Retinacular interposition arthroplasty afforded good functional results in patients with isolated arthrosis of the patellofemoral joint. The technique may be a surgical alternative for young and middle-aged patients who suffer from articular degenerative process at advanced stage...|$|E
30|$|Progression of <b>patellofemoral</b> <b>arthrosis</b> after UKA is a {{possibility}} and Berger et al. [1] observed patellofemoral symptoms were present in 1.6  % of patients at 10  years which increased markedly to 10  % of patients at 15  years. Hernigou and Deschamps [26] reported that after UKA the patellofemoral joint was affected by degenerative changes and patellar impingement against the femoral component and that both factors negatively influenced the functional outcome. Patellar impingement with the Oxford UKA prosthesis, as in our study, {{may not be a}} problem as during the surgical procedure care is taken to remove the bone anteriorly until there is at least 4  mm clearance for the front of the bearing in full extension. Price et al. [4] ignored the state of the patellofemoral joint in the absence of anterior knee pain at surgery and at 10  years follow-up; 97  % of knees reviewed had no patella-femoral pain and also the main cause for revision in their series was progression of osteoarthritis in the lateral compartment. At an average follow-up of 6.4  years we had 5.22  % of patients who complained of anterior knee pain. However, in only one patient with associated anterior knee pain was a TKA performed.|$|E
