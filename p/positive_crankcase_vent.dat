50|$|The first {{effort at}} {{controlling}} pollution from automobiles was the PCV (<b>positive</b> <b>crankcase</b> ventilation) system. This draws crankcase fumes heavy in unburned hydrocarbons — {{a precursor to}} photochemical smog — into the engine's intake tract so they are burned rather than released unburned from the crankcase into the atmosphere. <b>Positive</b> <b>crankcase</b> ventilation was first installed on a widespread basis by law on all new 1961-model cars first sold in California. The following year, New York required it. By 1964, most new cars sold in the U.S. were so equipped, and PCV quickly became standard equipment on all vehicles worldwide.|$|R

50|$|Emission {{reducing}} technology {{began with}} the installation of a <b>positive</b> <b>crankcase</b> ventilation (PCV) valve (MCA-I), followed {{by the addition of}} a thermo reactor air pump and catalytic converter in addition to a exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) valve (MCA-II) and a solenoid controlled automatic choke installed on the carburetor.|$|R
50|$|This is {{necessary}} because internal combustion inevitably involves {{a small but}} continual amount of blow-by, which occurs {{when some of the}} gases from the combustion leak past the piston rings (that is, blow by them) to end up inside the crankcase, causing pressure to build up in the crank case. For control of the pressure inside it, a PCV (<b>positive</b> <b>crankcase</b> ventilation) valve is used to <b>vent</b> the <b>crankcase.</b>|$|R
50|$|Lubricating oil {{creates a}} {{separating}} film between surfaces of adjacent moving parts to minimize direct contact between them, decreasing heat caused by friction and reducing wear, thus protecting the engine.

50|$|Emissions output was {{controlled}} by several systems. The EGR, or Exhaust Gas Recirculation system, brought exhaust gas from the exhaust stream up to the intake manifold, lowering peak combustion temperatures, the goal being the reduction of NOX emissions. A PCV, or <b>Positive</b> <b>Crankcase</b> Ventilation system, introduced oil vapor and unburnt fuel vapors from the crankcase to the intake, allowing the engine to re-use these as well. Furthermore, gasoline vapors that would normally be released into the atmosphere were captured by the EVAP system, to then be introduced into the engine.|$|R

5000|$|In {{addition}} to the oil cooler seals; this engine can also have an issue with {{the design of the}} <b>positive</b> <b>crankcase</b> ventilation system. The <b>crankcase</b> ventilation system <b>vents</b> to the inlet of the turbo. The issue is that the air <b>vented</b> from the <b>crankcase</b> contains too much oil to easily pass through the swirl motor valves downstream of the turbo. Once this oil and sludge begin to accumulate, the valve becomes inoperative and blows a fuse that controls many other sensors required to properly operate the engine and emission system. This will immediately place the vehicle into limp home mode and limit the rpm to 3000. It also causes a check engine light and numerous OBDII Codes. Mercedes Benz has previously recognized this feature of the vehicle and has stated that this engine feature, the accumulation of oil at the turbo inlet, is [...] "normal". In a Technical Service Bulletin they issued in 2008 they state:"Engine oil venting occurs on the right hand side of the engine air intake duct. For this reason there is always some oil in the engine air intake duct, see (Figure 3). This is no justification for replacing the turbocharger. Turbochargers replaced for this reason will not be covered by warranty." [...] While a slight amount of oil may be normal and acceptable, sufficient quantities and accumulation will indeed lead to other failures as identified above.|$|R
50|$|The B205 & B235-based 9-5 {{models have}} {{suffered}} {{a high rate of}} engine failures due to engine oil sludge. This primarily affected the 1999-2003 models. Saab refined the engine's <b>positive</b> <b>crankcase</b> ventilation system (PCV) for the 2004 and later model years and required use of fully synthetic oil, virtually eliminating the problem. Additionally, SAAB created update kits to retrofit to the 1999-2003 cars since they cannot be easily modified to accept the 2004 and later system. Mounting complaints by 9-5 owners forced GM to offer an eight-year warranty on the engine in 4-cylinder models for original owners, provided the owner can produce proof that they followed the manufacturer's oil change intervals. Saab recommends the use of Full Synthetic or Synthetic blend oil as a preventative measure.|$|R
5000|$|After the 1967 Trans-Am {{campaign}} with the 4-Bbl induction system producing more horsepower than the competing auto makers' 8-Bbl systems, for 1968 Chevrolet developed a factory 'cross-ram' aluminum intake-manifold package using two Holley [...] mechanical secondary carburetors for Trans-Am racing. It was available only as off-road service parts purchased over the Chevrolet dealership parts counter. With the Chevrolet '140 1st-design off-road cam, the package increased a stock 302's horsepower from [...] to approximately [...] Chevrolet {{went so far}} as to carry the <b>positive</b> <b>crankcase</b> ventilation (PCV) system over to the cross-ram induction system to retain emissions compliance mandated for US-produced cars beginning in 1967, that also provided full-throttle <b>crankcase</b> pressure <b>venting</b> to the intake air to burn its vapors. Engines prepared for competition use were capable of producing [...] with little more than the 8-Bbl induction, ported heads with higher pressure valvesprings, roller rocker arms, and the '754 2nd-design road-race cam. 1967/1968 models' cowl-induction system had an enclosed air-cleaner assembly ducted from its passenger side into the firewall cowl above the heater core. In 1969, factory Z/28's could be ordered with the ZL-1 aluminum-block 427 adaption of the 1967 L-88 427 Corvette cowl-induction 'ZL-2' hood available for both single and dual four-barrel induction systems that were sealed to the air cleaner base ensuring dense cooler, high-pressure, oxygen-laiden air from the center of the base of the windshield was supplied to the engine for combustion smoothness and maximum power production. Another popular service-parts-only component used on the 302 was the magnetic-pulse Delco transistor-ignition ball-bearing distributor. Introduced in 1963 on Pontiac's 389 and 421 drag racing engines, General Motors fitted it to the 1966? Z/28 before they used it on the L88 [...] Corvette. It eliminated the production breaker-point ignition allowing greater spark energy and more stable ignition timing at all engine speeds including idle. This was one of the least talked about yet most transformative and comprehensive performance and durability upgrades of its time. Many of the 302s off-road service parts were the development work of racers like Roger Penske. Every part in a SCCA Trans-Am engine had to be available through local Chevrolet parts departments to encourage their use by anyone who wanted them.|$|R

5000|$|... 1995 {{model year}} engines had three {{features}} that set {{them apart from}} later engines. The <b>positive</b> <b>crankcase</b> ventilation (PCV) system utilized a plastic oil separator box that was vented directly to the block itself; the breather hose and PCV valve hoses attached to the box, and connected to the induction system. Later engines featured a PCV system that was molded to the cylinder head valve cover. The second feature was internal in nature - the crankshaft main bearings were keyed into the bedplate on the right rear of each transverse web. Later model years featured keys machined on the right front of each web. These considerations are important when considering a rebuild or replacement of this engine. The third feature would be a slightly bigger camshaft that was changed on 1996 and up SOHC vehicles due to a rough idle when the air conditioning was on. This 1995 model year cam is now being sold by dealers as a power upgrade for 1996 and up SOHC engines, {{but it can also}} easily be found at salvage yards for a low price.|$|R
40|$|Exposures of {{occupants}} {{in school}} buses to on-road vehicle emissions, including emissions {{from the bus}} itself, can be substantially greater than those in outdoor settings. A dual tracer method was developed and applied to two school buses in Seattle in 2005 to quantify in-cabin fine particulate matter (PM 2. 5) concentrations attributable to the buses' diesel engine tailpipe (DPMtp) and <b>crankcase</b> <b>vent</b> (PMck) emissions. The new method avoids the problem of differentiating bus emissions from chemically identical emissions of other vehicles by using a fuel-based organometallic iridium tracer for engine exhaust and by adding deuterated hexatriacontane to engine oil. Source testing results showed consistent PM:tracer ratios for the primary tracer {{for each type of}} emissions. Comparisons of the PM:tracer ratios indicated that there was a small amount of unburned lubricating oil emitted from the tailpipe; however, virtually no diesel fuel combustion products were found in the crankcase emissions. For the limited testing conducted here, although PMck emission rates (averages of 0. 028 and 0. 099 g/km for the two buses) were lower than those from the tailpipe (0. 18 and 0. 14 g/km), in-cabin PMck concentrations averaging 6. 8 microg/m 3 were higher than DPMtp (0. 91 microg/m 3 average). In-cabin DPMtp and PMck concentrations were significantly higher with bus windows closed (1. 4 and 12 microg/m 3, respectively) as compared with open (0. 44 and 1. 3 microg/m 3, respectively). For comparison, average closed- and open-window in-cabin total PM 2. 5 concentrations were 26 and 12 microg/m 3, respectively.

40|$|The <b>Positive</b> <b>Crankcase</b> Ventilation (PCV) {{system in}} a car engine is {{designed}} to lower the pressure in the crankcase, which otherwise could lead to oil leaks and seal damage. The rotation of crankshaft in the crankcase causes the churn up of oil which conducts to occurrence of oil droplets which in turn may end in the PCV exhaust air intended to be re-injected in the engine admission. The oil catch can (OCC) is a device designed to trap these oil droplets, allowing the air {{to escape from the}} crankcase with the lowest content of oil as possible and thus, reducing the generation and emission of extra pollutants during the combustion of the air-fuel mixture. The main {{purpose of this paper is}} to optimize the design of a typical OCC used in many commercial cars by varying the length of its inner tube and the relative position of the outlet from radial to tangential fitting to the can body. For this purpose, CFD parametric analysis is performed to compute a one-way coupled Lagrangian-Eulerian two-phase flow simulation of the engine oil droplets driven by the air flow stream running through the device. The study was performed using the finite volume method with second-order spatial discretization scheme on governing equations in the Solid Works-EFD CFD platform. The turbulence was modelled using the k-ɛ model with wall functions.

40|$|Engine oil {{consumption}} {{is an important}} source of hydrocarbon and particulate emissions in modem automobile engines. Great efforts have been made by automotive manufacturers to minimize the impact of {{oil consumption}} on engine emissions. Research engineers in the last decade have been trying to study the sources and driving mechanism of oil consumption. In contrast to oil consumption mechanisms in the piston-ring-liner system of the engine, the <b>Positive</b> <b>Crankcase</b> Ventilation (PCV) blowby-oil consumption mechanism has not yet been fully characterized. Studies have shown that the blowby contribution to oil consumption could be significant under certain conditions. In this study, an experimental approach was taken in order to study the sources and characteristics of oil in the PCV blowby gases at different speeds and loads. An extensive diagnostic system was successfully integrated in a production spark ignition engine, to measure total oil consumption, blowby oil consumption and flow and in-cylinder variables, such as inter-ring pressures, oil film thickness and liner temperatures. Results showed an increase in blowby oil consumption with load and speed. Blowby flow was mainly dependent on the load of the engine. Oil concentration in the blowby varied with engine operating conditions. A strong relationship was observed between oil consumption and sump oil level, showing that the oil in the crankcase is {{an important source of}} oil in the blowby. Moreover, extensive experiments were conducted to determine the blowby flow's oil characteristics, by varying the liner temperatures and analyzing the mass distribution of different oil particle size. It was found that the average oil droplet size decreased as the load and speed were increased. (cont.) This work is an important step in understanding blowby oil consumption in efforts to minimize oil consumption in spark ignition engines. by Oscar Lopez. Thesis (S. M.)

40|$|At {{compressor}} stations, fugitive methane {{emissions from}} compressor piston rod packing and engine <b>crankcases</b> are <b>vented</b> {{directly into the}} atmosphere. In {{an effort to reduce}} compression station carbon footprint, this study evaluates the feasibility of combusting the methane emissions into carbon dioxide and thus reduce the global warming potential. This study focuses on running simulations to determine the methane reduction from rebreathing engine <b>crankcase</b> and compressor <b>vent</b> gases into the air intake of a large bore, natural gas, 2 -stroke engine. The methane reduction percentage is observed over a range of rebreathed gas mass flow rates, and rebreathed gas composition. It is extremely difficult to determine the composition of the engine blow-by gases in the crankcase, since the composition depends on a large variety of parameters. For this study, the emissions from the compressor was modeled as methane, and the emissions from the engine crankcase was modeled as products of combustion with a varying amount of methane concentrations. A sensitivity analysis was performed, and the observed pressure traces show that the engine performance is not affected by the addition of rebreathed gases. This insensitivity mainly results from the very small rebreathed flow rates compared to the air intake, and the adjustments made on engine parameters, boost pressure and fuel injection rate, to keep TER and the energy delivery rate the same. The simulations also showed that the net methane reduction percentage was approximately 52 %, no matter the study test conditions. It was discovered that the methane reduction depends on the trapping ratio of the engine; since these engines generally have trapping ratios around 50 %, the actual methane reduction tends to be small. A 52 % reduction rate is not desirable; the hope is to increase the reduction rate closer to 100 %. More importantly to note, a substantial amount of complexity would need to be added to a typical compressor station just to reduce methane emissions by 1 kg/hr. Thus, at present, the idea of rebreathing compressor and engine crank case gases for methane emission reduction is not feasible. Future studies should focus on routing the emissions to a 4 -stroke engine, a waste heat recovery system, or other combustion devices with higher trapping ratios...|$|R

These engines were fitted {{to a wide range of}} vehicles, from Ford Transit vans to sedans, coupés like the Ford Capri and sports cars like TVR and Marcos. The earlier versions of engine were rated at 128 hp ( [...] 95 kW [...] ) and 173 lb/ft of torque, around October 1971 the engine was revised by modifying the camshaft and cylinder heads that improved the power and torque to produce 157 SAE Hp or 138 DIN hp (103 kW) at 5000 rpm and 192 SAE lb/ft or 174 DIN lb/ft of torque at 3000 rpm. At the same time, the oil disptick was moved from the front of the engine to the side, the inlet manifold was improved from earlier models, and the compression ratio was raised slightly from 8.9:1 to 9.0:1 due to a change of the piston design. The shape of the inlet ports were also changed, from an O-port design to a D-port design which improved the flow characteristics of the heads, the old Weber 40 DFAV carburetor that was prone to over-fueling and resulting bore wash was replaced by the Weber 38 DGAS Carburetor, the air filter housing was also changed and later around 1976 and a hot air intake was added consisting of a metal pipe running from the top of a plate welded on the exhaust manifold or header to an opening in the air intake to prevent the carburetor from icing and making the engine warm up quicker, the carburetor was also modified again and a return style fuel system was adopted and a vacuum operated choke in the air filter housing were also added, this and a <b>Positive</b> <b>crankcase</b> ventilation (PCV) system were also early forms of emissions control. The camshaft gear was also made slightly stronger by using steel with nylon teeth instead of being completely made from nylon as on previous ones. Aftermarket steel, aluminium, and alloy gears have been produced as replacements to prevent the gear from stripping its teeth: this is commonly due to overheating causing the nylon to weaken.
