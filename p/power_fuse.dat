40|$|General Information: Power fuses {{shall be}} {{utilized}} to provide primarily {{short circuit protection}} for cables and transformers. The fuse rating shall be selected to appropriately provide 125 percent of the transformers full-load rating continuously, sustain no damage from magnetizing in-rush currents, and provide protection against thermal damage from internal or secondary faults. The interrupting rating shall be sufficient to quickly and safely interrupt fault currents and prevent extensive damage to equipment. Expulsion Type Power Fuses: The quality of components is to be that represented by: S & C Electric type SM- 5 S or SM- 5 SS Fuses shall be of the solid-material type and shall utilize refill-unit-and-holder or fuse-unit-andend-fitting construction with readily replaceable refill unit or fuse unit. Disconnect style mountings shall be used for switchgear rated up through 600 MVA at 13. 8 kV. Non-disconnect style mountings for power fuses shall be used only where higher ratings are required. Fusible elements shall be non-aging and non-damageable construction. Melting time-current characteristics shall be permanently accurate with a maximum total tolerance of 10 % in terms of current. Power fuses shall be capable of detecting and interrupting down to minimum melting current, under all realistic conditions of line-to-line or line-to-ground voltage, and shall be capable of handling {{the full range of}} transient recovery voltage severity associated with these faults. All arcing accompanying <b>power</b> <b>fuse</b> operation shall be contained within the fuse, and any arc products and gases evolved during fuse operation shall be vented through exhaust control devices that shall effectively control fuse exhaust. Blown-fuse indicators shall provide visible evidence of fuse operation while installed in the fuse mounting.

40|$|Traditionally, {{substation}} {{transformer protection}} was pro-vided by relayed circuit breakers or circuit-switchers, <b>power</b> <b>fuses,</b> or relayed-remote fault-interrupting schemes. Relayed protective schemes required an expen-sive substation control house and station batteries. <b>Power</b> <b>fuses</b> {{can only be}} applied where the continuous and fault-interrupting currents are within their more limited capa-bilities. A new transformer protective device was recently developed to address the short-comings of traditional pro-tective measures. The device has high interrupting capac-ity similar to circuit breakers, and higher continuous current capacity than <b>fuses.</b> But, like <b>power</b> <b>fuses,</b> the new device derives power for fault sensing and tripping from the fault current itself – a relay control house is not required {{and the need for}} batteries and associated mainte-nance is eliminated, providing the most economical pro-tection possible. Unlike <b>power</b> <b>fuses,</b> separate secondary neutral current sensing can be applied for more sensitive protection against ground faults and three-phase tripping is possible, even for single-phase faults. The transformer protective device has a 31. 5 -kA inter-rupting rating and a total 5 -cycle operating time. It is pow-ered from the current transformers installed on the primary bushings of the transformer. It is furnished with a compact control cabinet, which contains three single-phase self-powered overcurrent relays, and optional fourth secondary neutral current relay. The electrically linked pole-units are lightweight and have minimal real estate requirements. In many cases, the device can be installed on the transformer, or on existing structures...|$|R

25|$|Large <b>power</b> <b>fuses</b> use fusible {{elements}} made of silver, copper or tin {{to provide}} stable and predictable performance. High voltage expulsion fuses surround the fusible link with gas-evolving substances, such as boric acid. When the fuse blows, {{heat from the}} arc causes the boric acid to evolve large volumes of gases. The associated high pressure (often greater than 100 atmospheres) and cooling gases rapidly quench the resulting arc. The hot gases are then explosively expelled out of the end(s) of the fuse. Such fuses can only be used outdoors.|$|R

According to Bussard the high speed and therefore low cross section for Coulomb collisions of the ions in the core makes thermalizing collisions very unlikely, while the low speed at the rim means that thermalization there has almost no impact on ion velocity in the core.
