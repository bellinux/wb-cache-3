5|$|Escape from Butcher Bay {{is set in}} the futuristic {{science fiction}} {{universe}} of the Chronicles of Riddick franchise, and is a prequel to the film <b>Pitch</b> <b>Black.</b> The game takes place inside Butcher Bay, a maximum-security prison from which no prisoner has escaped. The facility—constructed on a barren planet—contains three increasingly secure holding areas, and a subterranean mining operation.|$|E
5|$|Since the Group's formation, ACG {{aircraft}} have {{deployed to}} Diego Garcia during Operation Slipper and formed {{part of the}} Australian contribution to the 2003 invasion of Iraq. ACG also worked on Operation Guardian II, which was {{the protection of the}} Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting 2002, and on Operation Falconer, which was providing a larger ground crew and strike force in Iraq. Other tasks have included support for Operation Acolyte (Melbourne Commonwealth Games 2006) and participation in exercises such as Exercise <b>Pitch</b> <b>Black</b> in Australia and Exercise Red Flag in the United States. Aircraft from the Group have also performed domestic security tasks and participated in overseas exercises.|$|E
5000|$|... “Lovelock” is {{also the}} second track on <b>Pitch</b> <b>Black‘s</b> second album, This is the Modern Sound (Revelation Records, 2005). Though the words are {{difficult}} to make out, a review informs us {{that this is a}} typically punk ‘us against the world anthem’. Other songs referencing mining towns and imagery explain why the name [...] "Lovelock" [...] was chosen.|$|R
40|$|Since hip-hop’s {{inception}} {{in the late}} 1970 s, {{there has been a}} pervasive emphasis, from Rakim’s “I Ain’t No Joke” to <b>Pitch</b> <b>Black’s</b> “Its All Real,” on an emcee’s realness, or authenticity. Why is there such an emphasis on proving oneself to be authentic? How has the notion of an emcee or DJ’s “realness” evolved with the music itself? How have musicologists and sociologists defined authenticity with regard to hip-hop? Are these definitions appropriate? Are they adequate? How has the tradition of sampling other songs shaped the debate on hip-hop authenticity...|$|R
50|$|Several {{months later}} on August 19, 2008 Crate {{announced}} {{the acquisition of}} the Black Legion intellectual property {{that has been in}} development at Iron Lore Entertainment before that studio closed. Iron Lore had attracted significant interest from publishers while <b>pitching</b> <b>Black</b> Legion in late 2007 but {{had not been able to}} survive long enough to close a publishing deal. Crate had hoped to pick up on the momentum that Black Legion had gained but due to the U.S. economic recession publishers opted to pass on a large project from the studio.|$|R
5|$|Near {{the end of}} the year, Harry and Dumbledore {{journey to}} a cave to {{retrieve}} a suspected Horcrux, Slytherin's locket. Dumbledore expertly finds a secret passageway to a large, <b>pitch</b> <b>black</b> underground lake, which Harry and Dumbledore cross in a small boat to an island in the centre. The locket is {{at the bottom of a}} basin and can only be reached by drinking the potion above it. Harry helps Dumbledore, who drinks the potion, and though Dumbledore is severely weakened, together they manage to fight off Voldemort's Inferi that have been hiding in the lake. They take the locket and return to find that the Dark Mark has been placed over the highest tower in Hogwarts in their absence. Harry and Dumbledore ascend the tower where they are ambushed by Draco Malfoy, accompanied by Death Eaters that he helped get inside Hogwarts. Dumbledore freezes Harry under his Invisibility Cloak with a body-bind spell to keep him hidden. Draco disarms Dumbledore of his wand and then threatens to kill him, which turns out to have been his mission from Voldemort. Draco is unable to go through with it, and Snape arrives and casts the spell to kill Dumbledore instead. Harry ignores the battle raging in Hogwarts to pursue Dumbledore's killer. Snape successfully fights Harry off, and he reveals that he is in fact the Half-Blood Prince before he, Draco, and the rest of the Death Eaters escape.|$|E
25|$|To {{increase}} {{the feeling of}} claustrophobia in Sunshine, Boyle refused to cut back to scenes on Earth, a traditional technique in most films about the planet in jeopardy. The director also maintained an atmosphere of confinement in Sunshine by avoiding filming the primary ship, Icarus II, from the outside. There {{are only a few}} outside shots of the ship. He also attempted to avoid filming star field backgrounds, keeping the ship's exterior <b>pitch</b> <b>black,</b> but he was ultimately compelled to show stars outside the spacecraft to help convey a sense of the ship's movement.|$|E
25|$|Among postmodernist photographers, the Australian Bill Henson {{photographs}} controversial nudes in low-key, Elad David works {{mainly with}} male nudes {{and in some}} of them only the busts – no head – of young men, is highlighted, leaving everything else in <b>pitch</b> <b>black.</b> Another artist who created a series of low-key photos exhibited in numerous exhibitions around the world, is the Finnish photographer Juha Arvid Helminen. He names his series The Invisible Empire, and refers to the shield that black colour offers, like a mask between who we truly are and the way society perceives us.|$|E
50|$|The {{music on}} the album {{features}} extremely fast melodic black metal mixed with classic and thrash metal, and incorporates a range of vocal styles such as high <b>pitched</b> <b>black</b> metal shrieks, death growls, and female singing. Recorded on 16-track analog tape in April and December 1997 as two separate sessions, the album was originally released as a cassette by THT Productions in January 1998. Later in October 1998, Sonic Wave and Candlelight Productions re-released the album as CD and cassette with a different cover artwork. It went to sell 5000 copies total until being completely sold out in 2002. The album was re-mastered and re-issued in June, 2014.|$|R

5000|$|Pitch was {{traditionally}} {{used to help}} caulk {{the seams}} of wooden sailing vessels (see shipbuilding).

25|$|At 1800 {{hours that}} same day, {{artillery}} bombardment {{of the enemy}} positions on Point 4875 commenced, and continued non-stop, throughout the whole night. 155 mm Bofors Howitzers, 105 mm Field Guns, and multi barrel rocket launchers {{were used in the}} bombardment of Point 4875. At 2030 hours in the <b>pitch</b> <b>black</b> night, under cover of artillery fire, 'A' and 'C' Companies began climbing the Point 4875. Captain Vikram Batra was lying in a sleeping bag in a tent on the rocky ground near the Mushkoh nullah, and was down with fever and fatigue. His commanding officer had ordered him to rest even though his battalion, 13 JAK Rifles, had launched its attack on the Point 4875.|$|E
25|$|The game uses several {{different}} level types and layouts. The game starts {{out in a}} front yard, and progresses to nighttime levels, where the gameplay is more challenging without any replenishing sun unless specific plants are used. Other levels feature the backyard, with a pool added. The final levels are nighttime pool levels (where fog fills the right half of the screen except when specific plants are used), a lightning storm level in <b>pitch</b> <b>black</b> (except when illuminated by occasional flashes of lightning), and rooftop levels (on the final level, the player must face a huge robot operated by a mad scientist {{who is also a}} zombie known as Dr. Zomboss). At set points throughout the game, the player is either warned through a letter by zombies or addressed by Crazy Dave to prepare for an ambush, where the game takes on a bowling style, using Wall-nuts to bowl down zombies, or a modified version of regular levels, where random plant types come up on a small selection, and the player can use the plants without spending sun.|$|E
25|$|An 18-hour {{standoff}} ensued {{during which}} time the police talked over the phone to Bryant, still calling himself Jamie. He requested a helicopter, saying {{that he wanted to}} be flown to a plane and then on to Adelaide, South Australia. He said that if the helicopter arrived, he would release Pears and only keep Noelene Martin. Bryant could see the movements of SOG officers, and continually demanded their retreat each time they began to approach the house. As he appeared to have excellent awareness of the events unfurling around him, despite the <b>pitch</b> <b>black</b> of night, the police believed he had some kind of visual aid device; none was ever found, however. A man was spotted on the roof of an adjacent building at one point, believed to be Bryant. Later in the night, the cordless phone Bryant was using began to run low on batteries. Police tried unsuccessfully to get him to return the phone to the charger, but it went dead and there were no further communications.|$|E
50|$|He {{was assassinated}} by ETA, who shot him {{twice in the}} head {{at his home in}} Barcelona, in 2000. At a UEFA soccer match with Club Brugge later that week, FC Barcelona came onto the <b>pitch</b> wearing <b>black</b> armbands in honor of Lluch, who had also been a fervent {{supporter}} of the team.|$|R

5000|$|In September 2016, {{after being}} {{in various stages of}} development, Warner Bros. Television began <b>pitching</b> <b>Black</b> Lightning to networks. The project was being {{developed}} by Mara Brock Akil and her husband, Salim Akil. They were partnered with Greg Berlanti, who was behind several DC Comics properties for the studio, eventually landing at Fox with a pilot production commitment. In February 2017, Fox opted not to go forward with the project, deciding that it was [...] "not a good fit into its already crowded genre drama space". Warner Bros. Television presented the project to other networks, with The CW officially ordering a pilot for Black Lightning. The CW also opted to discard the original pilot script, as it had been written for Fox, and shoot a short presentation instead. The CW officially ordered Black Lightning to series on May 10, 2017. It will premiere in 2018 of the 2017-18 season.|$|R
25|$|The player, {{who sits}} in an office, is {{given access to}} a network of {{security}} cameras throughout the facility to track {{the movement of the}} animatronics. Each character roams the restaurant and has distinct movement patterns, and most of the characters' movements take place off-screen. The camera feeds are dimly lit and distorted, one of the rooms only contains an audio feed, and the cameras do not cover certain areas of the building, most notably the two hallways directly to the left and right of the player. The player cannot leave the guard room, but can close the doors to defend themselves, and briefly turn on lights in the hallways to check for animatronics. Use of these actions consume the player's limited electrical power; if the power runs out, the cameras become inoperable, the doors open, and the lights go out. Once these things happen, the Toreador March will play, the screen will go <b>pitch</b> <b>black,</b> and the player will be jumpscared by Freddy, provided they do not reach {{the end of the night}} in the meantime. If the player is jumpscared by any of the animatronics, the game ends, and the player must restart from the beginning of the night.|$|E
25|$|Members of Death {{have since}} stayed active as musicians. Gene Hoglan from Dark Angel and Andy LaRocque from King Diamond {{had already made}} a name for themselves, with LaRocque {{continuing}} to work with King Diamond while Hoglan has done stints {{with a wide variety of}} bands including Strapping Young Lad, Old Man's Child, Opeth, Zimmers Hole, Unearth, <b>Pitch</b> <b>Black</b> Forecast, Dethklok, Fear Factory, and most recently, Testament. Paul Masvidal found success with Cynic alongside fellow Death member Sean Reinert, who continue to release albums and tour in the present. Richard Christy went on to gigs with Acheron and Iced Earth before joining The Howard Stern Show, though he has recently resurfaced on the metal scene with Charred Walls of the Damned and guesting on a Crotchduster album. Ralph Santolla has also played with Iced Earth, as well as Sebastian Bach; both are bands which Steve DiGiorgio played in as well. Santolla was in Obituary and he was previously in Deicide. Di Giorgio also played for Testament and is still active with his original band Sadus. Bobby Koelble founded the Orlando rock-funk-Latin fusion group JunkieRush in 2000. James Murphy was also in Testament, formed projects such as Disincarnate, as well as having stints with death metal bands Obituary and Cancer. Murphy was also stricken with a noncancerous brain tumor, for which he received treatment, and, along with Deron Miller of CKY, attempted to organize a Death tribute album. Kam Lee became well known as the frontman and face of the band Massacre, and formed the band Denial Fiend with Terry Butler, who has also found success in Six Feet Under and is currently in Obituary. Lee also continues to perform and record today with numerous underground projects, including Bone Gnawer and The Grotesquery. Scott Clendenin died in 2015.|$|E
500|$|The game follows Riddick, the anti-hero of the {{two films}} <b>Pitch</b> <b>Black</b> and The Chronicles of Riddick, as he {{attempts}} to escape from a maximum-security prison called Butcher Bay. Escape from Butcher Bays designers focused on exploring Riddick's character in a prison break setting to differentiate the game from the film. [...] The game's influences include the film Escape from Alcatraz, and video games such as Half-Life and Tom Clancy's Splinter Cell.|$|E

5000|$|Recurring {{features}} {{unique to}} the first series were sketches about terrible videogames <b>pitches</b> (like <b>Black</b> and White Minstrel Show 2006), Glasgow hard-man Barry Anoki reporting on videogames news, and a spoof soap opera about videogame development called DevCo. The [...] "Gaiden Top 100" [...] was ostensibly a series of talking-head interviews on the best games of all time, but in fact provided thinly veiled mockery or game-inspired jokes.|$|R
5000|$|In 2001, Solefald came {{together}} to release their third full-length. The new album, entitled Pills Against The Ageless Ills, was a concept album based on a fictitious tale written by Cornelius. Musically, Pills is more straightforward than Neonism. The album features more prominent guitar, with the keys acting as an accent and background instrument much of the time. Whereas Neonism consisted of songs that would each {{have a variety of}} styles and genres within them, Pills has a variety of different style songs, each focusing individually on a certain style. Vocally, the band had made yet another change. Maintaining Lazare's style and getting rid of his hollering style singing, and keeping Cornelius' lower black metal grunting, [...] "Pills" [...] saw the addition of a less high <b>pitched</b> <b>black</b> metal shriek from Cornelius, as well as Cornelius' most common style of singing to date. This new vocal style is a throaty sounding form of vocals, similar to some gothic rock bands. This album, released on September 19, 2001, was Solefald's first album released through the German record label Century Media.|$|R
500|$|On February 5, 2013, Meshuggah {{released}} a free two-track EP entitled <b>Pitch</b> <b>Black</b> with Scion A/V. The EP features a previously unreleased track, [...] "Pitch Black", that was recorded by Fredrik Thordendal in 2003 at Fear and Loathing, in Stockholm Sweden. The second track is a live recording of [...] "Dancers to a Discordant System" [...] from obZen. The track was recorded at Distortion Fest in Eindhoven, Netherlands, on December 9, 2012.|$|E
500|$|Ben Croshaw of Zero Punctuation {{gave the}} game the only entirely {{positive}} review in the show's history, calling it [...] "the most fun you'll have with your PC until they invent a force-feedback codpiece". Croshaw went on to say: [...] "I went in expecting a slew of interesting portal-based puzzles and that's exactly what I got, but what I wasn't expecting was some of the funniest <b>pitch</b> <b>black</b> humor I've ever heard in a game". He states that, while the game was short, the two- to three-hour length of the game was perfect as the game did not outstay its welcome, and called the ending [...] "balls-tighteningly fantastic", while praising the game as [...] "absolutely sublime from start to finish" [...] (adding that he would jam forks in his eyes if he ever praised a game so highly ever again).|$|E
500|$|The lights, and, by extension, the {{flashlight}} and flash beacon, {{are found in}} all main games, excluding the third. While use varies per game, lights are generally used to ward off animatronics, or warn the player of their presence. Lights {{in the first game}} and second games are activated via buttons mounted into the walls, and light up the player's 'blind spot', being the doorway or vent exit, respectively. The fifth game has the lights work similarly, however, they are now mounted onto a control pad, and serve no purpose other than the ability to see the animatronics, due to the different gameplay style. [...] The flashlight in the second and fourth game works in the same fashion as its real life counterpart, {{in the sense that it}} has a limited battery life, albeit only in the second game, and must be toggled on and off. The flash beacon was introduced in Sister Location, and is used to quickly gather bearings in the <b>pitch</b> <b>black</b> room seen on the third and fifth nights.|$|E
50|$|There {{are other}} pitch choices, with two very popular choices being Red (or {{sometimes}} referred to as brown) German Pitch and a versatile medium (grade/hardness) dark green chasers pitch. There is also a <b>black</b> <b>pitch.</b>|$|R
5000|$|In June 2008, Abnett and Lanning {{signed an}} {{exclusive}} deal with Marvel, which they hoped {{would give them}} {{time to work on}} the [...] "cosmic" [...] characters they have been dealing with, as well as more earth-based ones. The contract allowed them to finish existing commitments, so {{they will be able to}} finish their fifteen issue run on The Authority. In addition Marvel has allowed the contract to include [...] "a couple of exceptions that are not direct competition, for example, Dan's 2000AD work in the UK and his Games Workshop novels." [...] The first major work to emerge after this deal will be War of Kings, a crossover storyline, emerging from Secret Invasion, that <b>pitches</b> <b>Black</b> Bolt (and the Inhumans) against Gabriel Summers (and the Shi’ar Empire) but also draws in other teams and characters, including Nova, the Guardians of the Galaxy and the Starjammers. This then led straight into [...] "Realm of Kings" [...] which deals with how the different groups deal with the fallout from the events in War of Kings and this, in turn, was followed by The Thanos Imperative. DnA have also written an Iron Man/Thor limited series.|$|R
50|$|The {{ball will}} only travel at 15°, 30°, or 45° angles. If the ball hits a brick, the brick disappears {{and the ball}} ricochets in a {{different}} direction at the same angle. The ball's speed depends on the type of brick that it hits: gray and black bricks increase its speed, while white and square, indestructible bricks have no effect. A sound effect is also played when the ball collides with an object or wall, with walls producing the lowest <b>pitch</b> and <b>black</b> bricks the highest.|$|R
500|$|Giotto {{provided}} {{the first evidence}} in support of Fred Whipple's [...] "dirty snowball" [...] hypothesis for comet construction; Whipple postulated that comets are icy objects warmed by the Sun as they approach the inner Solar System, causing ices on their surfaces to sublimate (change directly from a solid to a gas), and jets of volatile material to burst outward, creating the coma. Giotto showed that this model was broadly correct, though with modifications. Halley's albedo, for instance, is about 4%, meaning that it reflects only 4% of the sunlight hitting it; about what one would expect for coal. Thus, despite appearing brilliant white to observers on Earth, Halley's Comet is in fact <b>pitch</b> <b>black.</b> The surface temperature of evaporating [...] "dirty ice" [...] ranges from 170 K (−103°C) at higher albedo to 220K (−53°C) at low albedo; Vega 1 found Halley's surface temperature to be in the range 300–400 K (30–130°C). This suggested that only 10% of Halley's surface was active, and that large portions of it were coated in a layer of dark dust that retained heat. Together, these observations suggested that Halley was in fact predominantly composed of non-volatile materials, and thus more closely resembled a [...] "snowy dirtball" [...] than a [...] "dirty snowball".|$|E
500|$|The video {{opens with}} a scene of the band in a stage room with a tunnel light, which is {{accompanied}} by the song playing in the background. The scene moves to the band grabbing their instruments, respectively. The band proceeds in performing the song. The scene then shifts to Key when he begins to sing. The camera shifts all around the room with different color lights, including a bullet hole scenery, as it then shifts to the band, as they continue performing. When Key sings [...] "'Cause nobody's there" [...] the light wall changes into a bright purple background. As the video shows the band continuing the song still at a fast pace, the effect {{is followed by a}} slow motion sequence. In the middle of the song, the lights are turned off, leaving the room <b>pitch</b> <b>black.</b> This is followed with the camera switching to the band members as they begin to play, once more, only with a bright yellow light on the tip of their instruments; the tips of the drum sticks that Parsons is holding also have yellow lights. As Key sings [...] "I've got a way to work this out" [...] blue lights emerge in the wall behind the group. The video ends with a focus on Key's microphone.|$|E
500|$|In late July 1944, Soviet forces {{began to}} {{approach}} from the east. The departing Germans who already destroyed most direct evidence of genocidal intent burned surrounding villages to the ground, including 761 buildings in Poniatowo, Prostyń, and Grądy. Many families were killed. The fields of grain that once fed the SS were burned. On 19 August 1944, German forces {{blew up the}} church in Prostyń and its bell tower, the last defensive strongpoint against the Red Army in the area. When the Soviets entered Treblinka on 16 August, the extermination zone had been levelled, ploughed over, and planted with lupins. What remained, wrote visiting Soviet war correspondent Vasily Grossman, were small pieces of bone in the soil, human teeth, scraps of paper and fabric, broken dishes, jars, shaving brushes, rusted pots and pans, cups of all sizes, mangled shoes, and lumps of human hair. The road leading to the camp was <b>pitch</b> <b>black.</b> Until mid-1944 human ashes (up to 20 carts every day) had been regularly strewn by the remaining prisoners along the road for [...] {{in the direction of}} TreblinkaI. When the war ended, destitute and starving locals started walking up the Black Road (as they began to call it) in search of man-made nuggets shaped from melted gold in order to buy bread.|$|E
25|$|At {{this point}} of Deuteronomium's career, Johnny Pesonen and Jari Mantour were {{replaced}} by Kalle Paju (guitar) and Janne-Jussi Kontoniemi (drums). The songs on Street Corner Queen were written between many years before the band entered the Studio Watercastle in Jyväskylä, 1998. According to the band members, on Street Corner Queen they couldn't decide what style they wanted to focus on yet wanted to be pioneering and write lyrics that kept balance between artistic output and intelligible meaning. Their guitarist-vocalist Miika Partala was the main songwriter {{at this point and}} he experimented with more and more bizarre musical styles after another, combining these elements with extreme metal. Street Corner Queen eventually ended up being a mixture of a broad spectrum of different styles, the main focus being on melodic output of Scandinavian death metal in vein of old In Flames or Dark Tranquillity and groovy rock oriented aggression similar to later Entombed and 1990s Napalm Death material. Many of the songs incorporate death metal, black metal, punk rock, classic rock, jazz, rap, reggae and funk metal elements – a style they were known to call 'death and roll'. The vocalization of Miika Partala shifts between aggressive Killing Joke type punk shouting and high <b>pitched</b> <b>black</b> metal style shrieking.|$|R
50|$|In 1938, while <b>pitching</b> for the <b>Black</b> Crackers, Smith threw two no-hitters in one day, and in 1941 {{with the}} Stars hurled another against the Black Yankees. He also started Games 3 and 6 of the 1947 Negro League World Series against the New York Cubans.|$|R
5000|$|He {{was honored}} by his club JSM Béjaïa in its next game {{following}} his death, a league match against CA Bordj Bou Arreridj. Players from both teams entered the <b>pitch</b> with <b>black</b> t-shirts {{with his face}} on them. Club officials then held an official ceremony presenting his father and two brothers an official framed jersey before holding a minute of silence in his honor prior to kick off. The fans in the stadium also prepared a giant two-piece black tifo with the messages [...] "Lahmar 24" [...] and [...] "Repose en paix" [...] (Rest in Peace).|$|R
