5|$|Marasmius rotula is {{a common}} species of agaric fungus in the family Marasmiaceae. Widespread in the Northern Hemisphere, it is {{commonly}} known variously as the <b>pinwheel</b> mushroom, the <b>pinwheel</b> marasmius, the little wheel, the collared parachute, or the horse hair fungus. The type species of the genus Marasmius, M.rotula was first described scientifically in 1772 by mycologist Giovanni Antonio Scopoli and assigned its current name in 1838 by Elias Fries.|$|E
5|$|On August 24, 2011, the Palomar Transient Factory {{automated}} survey {{discovered a}} new Type Ia supernova (SN 2011fe) in the <b>Pinwheel</b> Galaxy (M101) shortly after it burst into existence. Being only 21 million lightyears away and detected so early after the event started, it will allow scientists {{to learn more about}} the early developments of these types of supernovae.|$|E
5|$|Other Marasmius {{species with}} a <b>pinwheel</b> {{arrangement}} of gills are readily distinguished from M.rotula by differences in color, including the orange M.siccus, the pink M.pulcherripes, and the rust M.fulvoferrugineus. Mycena corticola {{is smaller than}} Marasmius rotula, has a pale pink-brown cap, and is usually found growing singly or in small groups on bark near the base of living trees.|$|E
50|$|A program {{started by}} two teachers, Ellen McMillan and Ann Ayers at Monarch High, the <b>Pinwheels</b> for Peace Project invites {{students}} {{to create and}} display their <b>pinwheels</b> on the campus during the International Day of Peace and has been adopted internationally.

50|$|During {{the nineteenth}} century in the United States, any wind-driven toy held aloft by a running child was {{characterized}} as a whirligig, including <b>pinwheels.</b> <b>Pinwheels</b> provided many children with almost endless hours of enjoyment and amusement.|$|R
50|$|<b>Pinwheels</b> {{might be}} turned through a purely {{mechanical}} action (as in the M-209) or electromechanically (as in the Lorenz SZ 40/42). Other cipher machines which used <b>pinwheels</b> include the C-52, the CD-57 and the Siemens and Halske T52.|$|R
5|$|Death Cab for Cutie {{began as}} a solo project of Ben Gibbard in 1997, while he was the guitar player for the band <b>Pinwheel,</b> and was {{recorded}} under the name All-Time Quarterback. As Death Cab for Cutie, Gibbard released a cassette titled You Can Play These Songs with Chords the same year. The release was surprisingly successful, and Gibbard decided to expand the project into a complete band, recruiting Chris Walla (who had also worked on the cassette) as lead guitarist, Nick Harmer as bass player, and Nathan Good as drummer. Death Cab for Cutie was officially formed at Western Washington University in Bellingham, Washington, and lyrics from early songs include local references that were important to the band's development. Many of the early songs were recorded {{in the basement of}} an Ellis Street home Gibbard lived in with several roommates in Bellingham.|$|E
5|$|Penrose tilings, {{which use}} two {{different}} quadrilaterals, {{are the best}} known example of tiles that forcibly create non-periodic patterns. They belong to a general class of aperiodic tilings, which use tiles that cannot tessellate periodically. The recursive process of substitution tiling is a method of generating aperiodic tilings. One class that can be generated {{in this way is}} the rep-tiles; these tilings have surprising self-replicating properties. <b>Pinwheel</b> tilings are non-periodic, using a rep-tile construction; the tiles appear in infinitely many orientations. It might be thought that a non-periodic pattern would be entirely without symmetry, but this is not so. Aperiodic tilings, while lacking in translational symmetry, do have symmetries of other types, by infinite repetition of any bounded patch of the tiling and in certain finite groups of rotations or reflections of those patches. A substitution rule, such as can be used to generate some Penrose patterns using assemblies of tiles called rhombs, illustrates scaling symmetry. A Fibonacci word can be used to build an aperiodic tiling, and to study quasicrystals, which are structures with aperiodic order.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationships}} between cytochrome oxidase blobs, ocular-dominance columns, and iso-orientation domains, subsystems underlying visual perception, were explored in {{primary visual cortex}} of macaque monkey. High-resolution maps of these three subsystems were acquired. Optical imaging based on activity-dependent intrinsic signals revealed that the most prominent organizational feature of orientation preference was a radial arrangement, forming a pinwheel-like structure surrounding a singularity point. More than 80 % of these <b>pinwheels</b> were centered along the midline of ocular-dominance columns. The iso-orientation contours of adjacent <b>pinwheels</b> crossed borders of ocular-dominance columns at approximately right angles. <b>Pinwheels</b> with the same or opposite directions of orientation-preference change were smoothly connected with each other. On the average, all orientations were equally represented. In exactly the same cortical area, the cytochrome oxidase blobs, thought {{to be involved in}} color processing, were also mapped, using cytochrome oxidase histology. Like the centers of <b>pinwheels,</b> the centers of blobs also lie along the midline of ocular-dominance columns. However, the centers of <b>pinwheels</b> did not coincide with the centers of blobs; these two subsystems are spatially independent. "Hypercolumn" modules, each including two complete <b>pinwheels</b> in two adjacent columns of complementary ocularity, as well as portions of a few blobs, were frequently found but {{did not seem to be}} the primary unit of cortical organization. An alternative to hypercolumns is proposed...|$|R
30|$|We now {{consider}} the hexagonal lattice. This case {{is different from}} the square lattice because it seems from Proposition  3.6 that only counterclockwise <b>pinwheels</b> are center of rotations. However, it turns out that γ as in Lemma  3.4 is a rotation on the torus, hence yielding the other <b>pinwheels</b> as center of rotations.|$|R

In a very few minutes they had most of the fireworks <b>pinwheels,</b> rockets, Roman candles, flower pots and others---in their possession.

40|$|Many {{everyday}} tasks {{require us}} to track moving objects with attention. The demand for attention increases both when more targets are tracked and when the targets move faster. These 2 aspects of attention—assigning multiple attentional foci (or indices) to targets and monitoring each focus with precision—may tap into different cognitive and brain mechanisms. In this study, we used {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} to quantify the response profile of dorsal attentional areas to variations in the number of attentional foci and their spatiotemporal precision. Subjects were asked to track a specific spoke of either 1 or 2 <b>pinwheels</b> that rotated at various speeds. Their tracking performance declined both when more <b>pinwheels</b> were tracked and when the tracked <b>pinwheels</b> rotated faster. However, posterior parietal activity increased only when subjects tracked more <b>pinwheels</b> but remained flat when they tracked faster moving <b>pinwheels.</b> The frontal eye fields and early visual areas increased activity when there were more targets and when the targets rotated faster. These results suggest that the posterior parietal cortex is specifically involved in indexing independently moving targets with attention but not in monitoring each focus with precision...|$|R
50|$|The community's {{street network}} design {{consists}} largely of concentric circles in four main <b>pinwheels.</b>|$|R
30|$|The main {{difference}} with the square {{case is that}} the clockwise rotation is not a network symmetry because of the anisotropic function J_ 0 in (7) when χ> 0. Hence, {{only half of the}} <b>pinwheels</b> are centers of rotation for the network equations (1), namely the counterclockwise <b>pinwheels.</b> A direct consequence of the lemmas in the previous section is the following.|$|R

25|$|The Facit calculator, and one {{similar to}} it, are {{basically}} <b>pinwheel</b> machines, but {{the array of}} pinwheels moves sidewise, instead of the carriage. The pinwheels are biquinary; digits 1 through 4 cause the corresponding number of sliding pins ot extend from the surface; digits 5 through 9 also extend a five-tooth sector {{as well as the}} same pins for 6 through 9.|$|E
25|$|M101, {{also called}} the <b>Pinwheel</b> Galaxy, is a face-on spiral galaxy located 25 million light-years from Earth. It was {{discovered}} by Pierre Méchain in 1781. Its spiral arms have regions with extensive star formation and have strong ultraviolet emissions. It has an integrated magnitude of 7.5, making it visible in both binoculars and telescopes, {{but not to the}} naked eye.|$|E
25|$|Typical European four-operation {{machines}} use the Odhner mechanism, or {{variations of}} it. This kind of machine included the Original Odhner, Brunsviga and several following imitators, starting from Triumphator, Thales, Walther, Facit up to Toshiba. Although {{most of these}} were operated by handcranks, there were motor-driven versions. Hamann calculators externally resembled <b>pinwheel</b> machines, but the setting lever positioned a cam that disengaged a drive pawl when the dial had moved far enough.|$|E

50|$|HVY is {{mechanically}} {{transmitted from}} plant to plant, often through hosts like aphids.

Potyviruses induce the intracellular formation of 3D cytoplasmic inclusions within affected plants, which are seen as <b>pinwheels</b> in transverse section and as bundles in longitudinal section. HVY induces typical <b>pinwheels</b> and bundles. HVY can be easily prevented in Helenium hybrids through disinfectants and antisera.|$|R
30|$|In this work, we have {{extended}} the seminal and very influential work [8] on cortical hallucinations {{after the original}} work of Ermentrout and Cowan [7]. Our idea is to assume a discrete lattice of <b>pinwheels</b> (as opposed to a continuous one) and to describe the cortical activity in the laminar zone which is located in between <b>pinwheels.</b> This is important, for example, {{if we want to}} confront our predictions to optical imaging experiments. This approach has led us to shed some new light onto two outstanding questions. First, what are the possible lattices of <b>pinwheels?</b> They turn out to be closely related to the wallpaper groups. Second, what is the simplest spontaneous dynamics generated by these networks? They turn out to be determined by the perturbation of invariant tori.|$|R

He also refined the binary number system, foundation of virtually all modern computer architectures.|$|E
25|$|Synchronized diving {{was adopted}} as an Olympic sport in 2000. Two divers form {{a team and}} perform dives simultaneously. The dives are identical. It used to be {{possible}} to dive opposites, {{also known as a}} <b>pinwheel,</b> but this is no longer part of competitive synchronized diving. For example, one diver would perform a forward dive and the other an inward dive in the same position, or one would do a reverse and the other a back movement. In these events, the diving would be judged both on the quality of execution and the synchronicity – in timing of take-off and entry, height and forward travel.|$|E
