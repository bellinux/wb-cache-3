2500|$|As {{medical science}} advances, {{the number of}} people who could be helped by organ donors {{increases}} continuously. As opportunities to save lives increase with new technologies and procedures, {{the number of people}} willing to donate organs needs to increase as well. In order to respect individual autonomy, voluntary consent must be determined for the individual's disposition of their remains following death. There are two main methods for determining voluntary consent: [...] "opt in" [...] (only those who have given explicit consent are donors) and [...] "opt out" [...] (anyone who has not refused consent to donate is a donor). In terms of an opt-out or <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>system,</b> it is assumed that individuals do intend to donate their organs to medical use when they expire. Opt-out legislative systems dramatically increase effective rates of consent for donation (the so-called default effect). For example, Germany, which uses an opt-in system, has an organ donation consent rate of 12% among its population, while Austria, a country with a very similar culture and economic development, but which uses an opt-out system, has a consent rate of 99.98%.|$|E
40|$|The recent {{debate about}} organ {{donation}} was surprisingly heated. People complained about a ‘nanny state’ infringing on their post-mortem rights; some threatened {{to tear up}} their donor cards if the proposed change to an ‘opt-out’ system went ahead. ‘Opt out’ means presumed consent, or a legal system in which people {{no longer have to}} actively join the organ donor register (ODR) in order to become donors. Everyone is automatically treated as a potential donor, unless they actively opt-out. Supporters of presumed consent propose this system as a means of increasing the number of organs available for transplantation. Opponents say it violates their right to their body after their death. The government has recently appointed a taskforce to examine the proposed change to a <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>system,</b> triggering a public debate about {{the pros and cons of}} presumed versus informed consent. This public debate, for all the strong emotions it arouses, has focused on the wrong issues. Moving to a <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>system</b> is unlikely to produce the sorely-needed increase in the number of organs available for transplantation. The empirical evidence shows that opt-in (informed consent) and opt-out (presumed consent) typically yield similar results in terms of number of organs procured, so a change to opt-out will not in itself solve the problem of organ shortage. Instead of arguing about the type of legal system that ought to be in place, we should focus on investment in infrastructure, public education and organisational change, as these are the measures that will in fact increase the number of organs available for life-saving tra...|$|E

40|$|Contrary to what {{is often}} stated in policy and ethical arenas, it is argued in this paper that no {{existing}} empirical data proves the superiority or the inanity of <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>systems</b> {{when it comes to}} understanding variations in procurement rates. A historical analysis of the French case is presented that shows that only contextualized and historically based analyses of specific situations can help understanding such variations. Indeed, although organ donation from cadaveric donors has been governed in France by <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> legislation since 1976, such legislation has been applied exceptionally and in specific socio-political contexts. Actually, relatives of brain dead potential donors enjoy in practice a para-legal veto right and play the most central role in the process of deciding whether to retrieve the organs of a brain dead potential donor. The analysis of the French situation shows thus that there is no general, decontextualised answer to the question Do consent regimes explain variations in procurement rates? As a matter of fact, no pre-established connection between the two exists, for procurement rates vary together with micro and macro social and political contexts that differ historically and geographically...|$|R
40|$|The organ {{shortage}} {{is commonly}} presented {{as having a}} clear solution, {{increase the number of}} organs donated and the problem will be solved. In the light of the Northern Ireland Assembly’s consultation on moving to an opt-out organ donor register this article focusses on the social factors and complexities which impact strongly on both the supply of, and demand for, transplantable organs. Judging by the experience of other countries <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>systems</b> may or may not increase donations but have not met demand. Donation rates have risen considerably {{in all parts of the}} UK recently but there is also an increasing demand for organs. Looking at international donation rates and attitudes, future demand for organs and education on donation, the question is whether the organ shortage could ever be met. The increase in longevity, in rates of diabetes and obesity and in alcohol related liver disease all contribute both to increased demand for transplants, and re-transplants, and a reduction in the number of usable organs. It is unlikely that demand could ever be met, since, if supply was unlimited, the focus would move to financial resources and competing demands on the health care budget in a publicly funded health system. These factors point to the need to focus on ways of reducing, or at least stabilizing, demand where lifestyle factors contribute to the underlying disease...|$|R

40|$|Background: Malaysia, which {{currently}} uses the informed consent system (ICS), {{is suffering from}} a severe shortage of organs for transplantation. Family members of dialysis patients (FMDPs) {{are expected to have}} a positive attitude toward deceased organ donation (DOD) because they have a close relative in need of a kidney donation. This study explores FMDPs' attitude toward DOD under the ICS and the <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>system</b> (PCS). Material/Methods: The attitude of 350 FMDPs toward DOD under the ICS and PCS were sought between June and October 2013 in 3 dialysis institutions in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Results: Under the ICS, 6. 6 % of respondents were registered donors, 6. 6 % were ready to register {{at the time of the}} survey, 38. 6 % were willing to donate but not ready to register at the time of the survey, and 48. 2 % were unwilling to donate organs upon death. If the PCS were implemented, 57. 7 % of respondents (28. 7 % of the willing donors and 88. 7 % of the unwilling respondents) stated that they would officially object to organ donation. Conclusions: FMDPs' attitude toward DOD is not more positive or significantly better than that of the general public (based on earlier studies). The PCS may increase the number of donors, but it may also worsen the attitude of FMDPs toward DOD. Strategies aiming to promote DOD in Malaysia should be revised, and should perhaps be focused on enhancing trust of the medical system...|$|E

25|$|Because {{of public}} policies, cultural, infrastructural and other factors, <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> or opt-out models {{do not always}} {{translate}} directly into increased effective rates of donation. The United Kingdom has several different laws and policies for the organ donation process, such as consent of a witness or guardian must be provided to participate in organ donation. In terms of effective organ donations, in some systems like Australia (14.9 donors per million, 337 donors in 2011), family members are required to give consent or refusal, or may veto a potential recovery even if the donor has consented. Some countries with an opt-out system like Spain (36 effective donors per million inhabitants) or Austria (21 donors/million) have high donor rates and some countries with opt-in systems like Germany (16 donors/million) or Greece (6 donors/million) have lower effective donation rates. The president of the Spanish National Transplant Organisation has acknowledged Spain's legislative approach is likely not {{the primary reason for}} the country's success in increasing the donor rates, starting in the 1990s. Looking to the example of Spain, which has successfully adopted the <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> donation <b>system,</b> intensive care units (ICUs) must be equipped with enough doctors to maximize the recognition of potential donors and maintain organs while families are consulted for donation. The characteristic that enables the Spanish <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> model to be successful is the resource of transplant coordinators; it is recommended to have at least one at each hospital where opt-out donation is practiced to authorize organ procurement efficiently.|$|R

There is limited information on public relative attitudes towards various consenting systems, especially in Middle Eastern/Islamic countries. Methods We surveyed 698 Saudi Adults attending outpatient clinics at a tertiary care hospital. Preference and perception of norm regarding consenting options for posthumous organ donation were explored. Participants ranked (1, most agreeable) the following, randomly-presented, options from 1 to 11 : no-organ-donation, presumed consent, informed consent by donor-only, informed consent by donor-or-surrogate, and mandatory choice; the last three options ± medical or financial incentive.

40|$|Abstract Background Transplantable {{organs are}} scarce everywhere. Therefore, {{countries}} have developed policies {{to support the}} efficient use of potential donors. Nevertheless, the shortage of organs remains. Were these policies in vain? The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the impact of donor policies on donor procurement in 10 Western European countries from 1995 to 2005. Method To assess the impact of the donor policies we studied the conversion of potential donors into effectuated donors. 80 % of the donors died from CVAs or a (traffic) accident. We considered these mortality rates to be a good proxy for potential donors. Here we call the conversion of potential donors into actual donors 'the donor efficiency rate by proxy'. Results The mortality rates for CVA and (traffic) accidents have decreased in the countries under study. At the same time, in most countries the donor efficiency rates have steadily increased. The variance in donor efficiency rates between countries has also increased from 1995 to 2005. Four countries introduced a new consent system or changed their existing system, without (visible) long-term effects. Conclusion The overall increase in donor efficiency means that the efforts to improve donor policies have paid off. However, substantial differences between countries were found. The success of donor policies in terms of the number of absolute donors is blurred by the success of policies on traffic safety and CVA treatment. It remains unclear which specific policy measures are responsible for the increase in donor efficiency rates. This increase is not related to having a <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>system.</b> Furthermore, an analysis of countries that introduced a new consent system or changed their system showed no effect on donor efficiency. </p...|$|E
40|$|Next of kin decisive on organ {{donation}} Changing the donor registration systems {{is not expected}} to result in more donor organs. We better try to solve the bottlenecks in the donation process within hospitals and {{to reduce the number of}} refusals by next of kin, as NIVEL research shows, based on which study Remco Coppen took his doctor’s degree on 3 September at Tranzo, Tilburg university in the Netherlands In the Netherlands, about 1300 people are on the waiting list for a donor organ, but there are no more than about 200 to 220 donors each year. Consequently, there is a serious shortage of donor organs. Amendments to the Dutch Organ Donation Act or changes in the Dutch consent system, which is based on explicit consent, to a <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>system</b> does not solve this shortage according to the PhD-thesis of Remco Coppen. "Indeed, countries with a <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> <b>system</b> have more donors, but those countries also have for example more traffic deaths. After adjusting the national donation rates for differences in mortality rates which are relevant for {{organ donation}} (e. g. traffic-deaths and CVA), the differences in donation rates between presumed and explicit consent countries disappear. The absence of differences in organ donor procurement between presumed and explicit consent countries can be explained by a similar practice around organ donation. In each country the medical staff consults the next of kin about the donation of organs: in practice, next of kin give their final approval, regardless of the consent system. ” Close contact with relatives Taking into account the differences in mortality rates for CVA and traffic-accidents between 10 Western European countries, only Spain and Austria have more donors than the Netherlands. In these countries, next of kin seem to be more willing to consent to organ donation. In Austria, this can probably be explained by its autopsy custom which makes the decision to donate organs easier. Spain is well-known for its intensive system and organisation of organ donation. An important element of the Spanish system is a very intensive contact between the medical staff and the relatives. Decision under pressure "It is remarkable that despite the positive attitude towards organ donation of the Dutch population, relatives often refuse a donation procedure," says Coppen. "The consultation of next of kin always takes place under very emotional and stressful circumstances. On the one hand, it is, therefore, required to educate people and to make sure they reflect about their view on organ donation, which may lead to consent registration or a family discussion on this topic. On the other hand, it is also important for the medical staff to be prepared for a consultation with next of kin regarding organ donation and to train them how to conduct such a consultation. However, there is still little known on communication styles which work in Dutch practice. We also hardly know why next of kin refuse the donation of organs. " No magic bullet "That a system change will not solve the organ shortage is a very disappointing message for people on the waiting list," says Coppen. "Although a system in which everyone is a donor (presumed consent) does not lead to more donor organs, such a system may show, for example, more solidarity with the people on the waiting list than our current system based on explicit consent. This may explain why there is still much debate about the Dutch consent system. " Hospitals Currently NIVEL studies the process of organ donation in hospitals, in collaboration with the Erasmus Medical Centre and iBMG of the Erasmus University. "There are disparities in the number of donations between similar hospitals. This suggests that there are still opportunities to increase the number of successful organ donation procedures", argues Coppen. "We now search for bottlenecks in the donation process in hospitals. These bottlenecks should be solved in order to prevent procedures being more difficult than necessary, and to prevent that for this reason organ donation procedures do not proceed. ...|$|E

2500|$|Opt-out consent, {{otherwise}} known as [...] "deemed" [...] consent, support refers {{to the notion that}} the majority of people support organ donation, but {{only a small percentage of}} the population are actually registered, because they fail to go through the actual step of registration, even if they want to donate their organs at the time of death. This could be resolved with an opt-out system, where many more people would be registered as donors when only those who object consent to donation have to register to be on the non-donation list. For this reasons, countries, such as Wales, have adopted a [...] "soft opt-out" [...] consent, meaning if a citizen has not clearly made a decision to register, then they will be treated as a registered citizen and participate in the organ donation process. Likewise, opt-in consent refers to the consent process of only those who are registered to participate in organ donation. Currently, the United States has an opt-in system, but studies show that countries with an opt-out system save more lives due to more availability of donated organs. The current opt-in consent policy assumes that individuals are not willing to become organ donors at the time of their death, unless they have documented otherwise through organ donation registration. Registering to become an organ donor heavily depends on the attitude of the individual; those with a positive outlook might feel a sense of altruism towards organ donation, while others may have a more negative perspective, such as not trusting doctors to work as hard to save the lives of registered organ donors. Some common concerns regarding a <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> ("opt-out") <b>system</b> are sociologic fears of a new system, moral objection, sentimentality, and worries of the management of the objection registry for those who do decide to opt-out of donation. Additional concerns exist with views of compromising the freedom of choice to donate [...] and conflicts with religious beliefs which exist. Even though concerns exist, the United States still has a 95 percent organ donation approval rate. This level of nationwide acceptance may foster an environment where moving to a policy of <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> may help solve some of the organ shortage problem, where individuals are assumed to be willing organ donors unless they document a desire to [...] "opt-out", which must be respected.|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background The {{organ donor}} {{shortfall}} in the UK has prompted calls to introduce legislation {{to allow for}} presumed consent: {{if there is no}} explicit objection to donation of an organ, <b>consent</b> should be <b>presumed.</b> The current debate has not taken in account accepted meanings of presumption in law and science and the consequences for rights of ownership that would arise should <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> become law. In addition, arguments revolve around the rights of the competent autonomous adult but do not always consider the more serious implications for children or the disabled. Discussion Any action or decision made on a presumption is accepted in law and science as one based on judgement of a provisional situation. It should therefore allow the possibility of reversing the action or decision. <b>Presumed</b> <b>consent</b> to organ donation will not permit such reversal. Placing prime importance on the functionality of body organs and their capacity to sustain life rather than on explicit consent of the individual will lead to further debate about rights of ownership and potentially to questions about financial incentives and to whom benefits should accrue. Factors that influence donor rates are not fully understood and attitudes of the public to <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> require further investigation. <b>Presuming</b> <b>consent</b> will also necessitate considering how such a measure would be applied in situations involving children and mentally incompetent adults. Summary The presumption of consent to organ donation cannot be understood {{in the same way as}} is presumption when applied to science or law. Consideration should be given to the consequences of <b>presuming</b> <b>consent</b> and to the questions of ownership and organ monetary value as these questions are likely to arise should <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> be permitted. In addition, the implications of <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> on children and adults who are unable to object to organ donation, requires serious contemplation if these most vulnerable members of society are to be protected. </p...|$|R
40|$|Background—Financial incentives, donor authorization, and <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> are {{strategies}} {{designed to}} increase organ donation rates. Surveys designed to assess attitudes toward these initiatives have been conducted with the general public, transplant patients, and transplant professionals. Methods—To assess attitudes toward financial incentives, donor authorization, and <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> and to identify multivariate predictors of such attitudes, we conducted telephone interviews with 561 family members who had recently been asked for consent to donate the organs of a deceased family member (348 donors, 213 nondonors). Results—Financial incentives {{would have made a}} difference in the donation decision for 54 % of nondonors (vs. 46 % of donors, P = 0. 02), and a higher percentage of nondonors would themselves become donors if financial incentives were available (P = 0. 03).

Overall, 54 % of participants thought that family permission for donation was unnecessary when the deceased documented their donation intention, and 24 % favored a <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> law with an opting out provision.

These included requiring UKT to comply with the Welsh Language Act 1993; the report noted that UKT had made no provision for Welsh speakers and the only Welsh language literature produced by UKT was the organ donor card. No suggestion was made, however, [...] "that organs harvested in Wales should not continue to be made available across the UK". A number of recommendations were made in the report, including implementing the UK [...] "ODTF recommendations in full in Wales as a matter of urgency". Although most of the Committee agreed with <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> in principle, their report did not recommend that the Assembly should seek to introduce of a <b>system</b> of <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> [...] "at this stage". Of the nine committee members, six voted against proposing a <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> system: Jonathan Morgan (Chair) (Conservative (Con)); Lorraine Barrett (Labour (Lab)); Irene James (Lab); Ann Jones (Lab); Val Lloyd (Lab); and Nick Ramsay (Con). Three voted in its favour; Helen Mary Jones (Plaid Cymru (PC)); Dr Dai Lloyd (PC); and Jenny Randerson (Liberal Democrat). In September 2008, Edwina Hart, Minister for Health and Social Care, rejected the committee's main recommendation, saying it did not reflect the weight of public opinion in favour of <b>presumed</b> <b>consent.</b> Hart confirmed the Welsh Government's intention to keep a change to the law under [...] "active consideration".|$|R

Our contention is that if one correctly understands the metaphysics of both {{the human body and}} material property, then it will turn out that while organ sales are illiberal, <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> is not. What we mean by illiberal includes violating rights of bodily integrity, property, or autonomy, as well as arguing for or against a policy in a manner that runs afoul of Rawlsian public reason...|$|R
40|$|Background: The kidney is {{the most}} common transplanted organ, {{accounting}} for almost all living donor transplantations and most deceased donor organ transplantations. The organ shortage has caused policymakers in many nations to debate the merits of adopting <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> legislation as a way to increase donor organ donation from deceased donors. Objective: To compare characteristics and kidney transplantation rates for countries with <b>presumed</b> <b>consent</b> for deceased organ do-nation with countries with explicit consent. Design: A longitudinal study of international kidney transplantation from 1997 to 2007. Setting: 44 nations performing kidney transplantation...|$|R
