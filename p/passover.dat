5|$|The White House <b>Passover</b> Seder was {{an annual}} private dinner {{held at the}} White House on the Jewish holiday of <b>Passover</b> during the {{presidency}} of Barack Obama. Obama initiated it in 2009 for his family, staff members, friends, and their families. The gathering recited the <b>Passover</b> Haggadah, discussed the themes of the <b>Passover</b> Seder and their relation to current events, and partook of a holiday-themed meal. Obama hosted and attended the Seder each year from 2009 to 2016. It was the first <b>Passover</b> Seder to be conducted by a sitting U.S. president in the White House.|$|E
5|$|The week-long holiday of <b>Passover</b> in {{the spring}} commemorates the Exodus from Egypt, and in Israel is usually a time for visiting friends and relatives, travelling, and {{on the first night}} of <b>Passover,</b> the {{traditional}} ritual dinner, known as the Seder. Foods containing ḥametz– leaven or yeast– may not be eaten during <b>Passover.</b> This means bread, pastries and certain fermented beverages, such as beer, cannot be consumed. Ashkenazim also do not eat legumes, known as kitniyot. Over the centuries, Jewish cooks have developed dishes using alternative ingredients and this characterizes <b>Passover</b> food in Israel today.|$|E
5|$|Angel Bakeries {{operates}} year-round {{except for}} Shabbat, Yom Tov, and <b>Passover</b> week. In accordance with Jewish law, it annually sells its stock to a non-Jew before <b>Passover</b> {{so that it}} does not own chametz over the holiday.|$|E
5|$|Obama {{hosted the}} White House <b>Passover</b> Seder for all {{eight years of}} his administration. Among the annual traditions for the White House Seder were Obama's {{imitation}} of Pharaoh, Chaudhary's speech on the Hillel sandwich, and the hiding of the afikoman {{under the watchful eye}} of a Secret Service member. The Seder convened in the Old Family Dining Room and lasted for two hours. During Obama's last year in office in 2016, the Seder was held on April 26, the sixth day of <b>Passover,</b> due to Obama's previously scheduled visit to Saudi Arabia on the first and second nights of <b>Passover.</b>|$|E
5|$|On April 10, 2017, {{the first}} night of <b>Passover,</b> President Donald Trump {{continued}} Obama's tradition of hosting a <b>Passover</b> Seder, but unlike Obama, neither Trump nor his family members attended the ritual. This Seder, too, was conducted by staffers in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building.|$|E
5|$|The Maxwell House Haggadah is an English-Hebrew <b>Passover</b> Haggadah {{introduced}} by the Maxwell House company as a marketing promotion in 1932 and printed continuously since that time. With over 50 million copies in print, {{it is the best}} known and most popular Haggadah among American Jews, and is considered a cultural icon. It is used at <b>Passover</b> Seders in homes, schools, senior centers, prisons, and the United States Army, and was the edition used by President Obama and his guests at the White House <b>Passover</b> Seder conducted yearly from 2009 to 2016. In 2011 a new English translation replaced archaic phrases in the original and also incorporated gender-neutral language.|$|E
5|$|The Maxwell House Haggadah is used at <b>Passover</b> Seders in homes, schools, senior centers, and prisons. The United States Army {{has issued}} it to {{soldiers}} in every military campaign since the 1930s. It {{was used in}} underground Seders in the Soviet Union, and by President Barack Obama and his guests at the annual White House <b>Passover</b> Seder from 2009 to 2016.|$|E
5|$|A <b>Passover</b> Seder is {{a ritual}} meal held by Jews {{on the first}} two nights of the <b>Passover</b> holiday (first night only in Israel). The Seder is {{traditionally}} conducted in the home by the family and their invited guests, although it may also be held by any group of Jews, such as members of a synagogue, condominium complex, student group, army base, etc. At the Seder, participants read the Haggadah, a ritual text recounting the liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. The reading is accompanied by visual aids {{in the form of the}} symbolic foods on the <b>Passover</b> Seder Plate. A festive meal is part of the ritual. While religious Jewish law places certain restrictions on a non-Jew eating at a Seder, non-traditional Jews often invite non-Jews to their Seders, and non-Jews also conduct Seders of their own.|$|E
5|$|After <b>Passover,</b> {{the celebration}} of Mimouna takes place, a {{tradition}} brought to Israel by the Jewish communities of North Africa. In the evening, a feast of fruit, confectionery and pastries is set out for neighbors and visitors to enjoy. Most notably, the first leaven after <b>Passover,</b> a thin crepe called a mofletta, eaten with honey, syrup or jam, is served. The occasion is celebrated the following day by outdoor picnics at which salads and barbecued meat feature prominently.|$|E
5|$|In April 1993 staffers of President Clinton {{conducted}} a <b>Passover</b> Seder in the Indian Treaty Room of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, {{in the absence}} of the President.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} year, with Obama {{elected president}} and his junior staffers working in the White House, Obama encouraged the group to hold the Seder again. The 2009 event {{was the first time}} that a sitting U.S. president conducted a <b>Passover</b> Seder in the White House. The White House switchboard was reportedly swamped with callers seeking a dinner invitation. The White House Seder was scheduled for the second night of <b>Passover</b> to allow Jewish staffers to spend the first Seder on the first night of <b>Passover</b> with their families. About 20 guests sat around a table in the Old Family Dining Room reading the Haggadah and sampling the traditional Seder foods. Malia and Sasha Obama, being the youngest in attendance, recited the Four Questions and engaged in the search for the afikoman.|$|E
5|$|The menu at the White House <b>Passover</b> Seder {{featured}} traditional American Jewish <b>Passover</b> cuisine such as gefilte fish, charoset, {{chicken soup}} with matzah balls, brisket, potato kugel, and macaroons. Salads and vegetable side dishes completed the menu. Lesser brought handmade shmurah matzah from the Chabad-Lubavitch center in Springfield, Massachusetts. Family recipes were emphasized: in 2015, these recipes included matzo ball soup from Ziskend's grandmother, carrot soufflé from Lesser's mother, and Raspberry Ganache Marjolaine from Chaudhary's mother. Recipes covered foods {{from both the}} Ashkenazic and Sephardic traditions. The food was not strictly kosher, but kosher style. In 2014, the White House <b>Passover</b> Seder began inviting a guest chef to coordinate the menu with the White House executive chef.|$|E
5|$|At {{the time}} the {{building}} was constructed, the Phoenix area had only 120 Jewish residents. The synagogue served as a cultural center for the Jewish community, including hosting communal <b>Passover</b> Seders, {{at a time when}} Jews faced discrimination at hotels and other places of public gathering.|$|E
5|$|Fenster {{notes that}} until the {{introduction}} of the Maxwell House Haggadah, American families purchased new and different Haggadahs each year for their <b>Passover</b> Seder guests. The easy availability and textual consistency of each year's Maxwell House Haggadah made it ideal for expanding the family's Haggadah collection.|$|E
5|$|In Eastern European Ashkenazi Jewish tradition, {{vegetarian}} borscht {{served with}} sour cream and boiled potatoes on the side, known as , is considered an essential dish during the <b>Passover</b> period. As the holiday is observed in spring (March or April), the preparation of <b>Passover</b> borscht used to {{provide an opportunity to}} use up the beet sour left over from pickled beetroots that had been consumed during winter, remaining potatoes that had been stored throughout the winter and sour cream that was readily available in the new calving season. Cold borscht blended {{with sour cream}} is also popular on Shavuot (Feast of Weeks), a holiday customarily associated with dairy foods, observed in late May or early June. Seudah Shlishit, or the third meal of the Shabbat, often includes borscht as well.|$|E
5|$|It {{became the}} largest film {{production}} ever in New York State. The decision to film in Williamsburg, Brooklyn near the <b>Passover</b> holiday caused some controversy, as critics {{believed that this}} was culturally insensitive, and would cause problems with parking. The filming company decided {{to work with the}} community and then agreed to adjust its production activities for <b>Passover.</b> The producers had assembled a 200-person crew for the 10-day shoot in Rochester, with a total number of 250 local crew members and 150 local extras. The prominent scenes were shot mostly on Main Street of Rochester and were digitally remastered to look like New York City.|$|E
5|$|Lettuce is also eaten {{as part of}} the Jewish <b>Passover</b> Seder, {{where it}} is {{considered}} the optimal choice for use as the bitter herb, which is eaten together with the matzah.|$|E
5|$|Many Israelis, both {{religious}} and secular, celebrate with a kabbalistic-inspired Tu Bishvat seder {{that includes a}} feast of fruits and four cups of wine according to the ceremony presented in special haggadot modeled on the Haggadah of <b>Passover</b> for this purpose.|$|E
5|$|The cheering crowds {{greeting}} Jesus as {{he enters}} Jerusalem add to the animosity {{between him and the}} establishment. In John, Jesus has already cleansed the Second Temple during an earlier <b>Passover</b> visit to Jerusalem. John next recounts Jesus' Last Supper with his disciples.|$|E
5|$|A Haggadah is {{a ritual}} Jewish text {{containing}} prayers, hymns, Midrashic statements, and {{commentary on the}} story of Passoverthe liberation of the Israelites from slavery in ancient Egypt. This text is recited by participants at a <b>Passover</b> Seder. The Haggadah has appeared in print since the 15th century and thousands of editions have been published.|$|E
5|$|Although not all Jews in Israel keep kosher, the {{tradition}} of kashrut strongly influences the availability of certain foods and their preparation in homes, public institutions and many restaurants, including the separation of milk and meat and avoiding the use of non-kosher foods, especially pork and shellfish. During <b>Passover,</b> bread and other leavened foods are prohibited to observant Jews and matza and leaven-free foods are substituted.|$|E
5|$|Constantine {{enforced}} {{the prohibition}} of the First Council of Nicaea against celebrating the Lord's Supper {{on the day before}} the Jewish <b>Passover</b> (14 Nisan) (see Quartodecimanism and Easter controversy). This marked a definite break of Christianity from the Judaic tradition. From then on the Roman Julian Calendar, a solar calendar, was given precedence over the lunisolar Hebrew Calendar among the Christian churches of the Roman Empire.|$|E
5|$|Fish {{are also}} braised, as in a dish called hraime, in which fish such as grouper (better known in Israel by its Arabic name lokus) or halibut is {{prepared}} in a sauce with hot pepper and other spices for Rosh Hashanah, <b>Passover</b> and the Sabbath by North African Jews. Everyday versions are prepared with cheaper kinds {{of fish and}} are served in market eateries, public kitchens and at home for weekday meals.|$|E
5|$|If {{the story}} of the Star of Bethlehem {{described}} an actual event, it might identify the year Jesus was born. The Gospel of Matthew describes the birth of Jesus as taking place when Herod was king. According to Josephus, Herod died after a lunar eclipse and before a <b>Passover</b> Feast. The eclipse is usually identified as the eclipse of March 13, 4 BC. Other scholars suggested dates in 5 BC, because it allows seven months for the events Josephus documented between the lunar eclipse and the <b>Passover</b> than the 29 days allowed by lunar eclipse in 4 BC. Others suggest it was an eclipse in 1 BC. The narrative implies that Jesus was born sometime between the first appearance of the star and the appearance of the Magi at Herod's court. That the king is said to have ordered the execution of boys two years of age and younger implies that the Star of Bethlehem appeared within the preceding two years. Some scholars date the birth of Jesus as 6–4 BC, while others suggest Jesus' birth was in 3/2 BC.|$|E
5|$|The Black Hebrews {{believe they}} are descended {{from members of the}} Tribe of Judah who were exiled from the Land of Israel after the Romans {{destroyed}} the Second Temple in 70 CE. The group incorporates elements of African-American culture into their interpretation of the Bible. They do not recognize rabbinical Jewish interpretations such as the Talmud. The Black Hebrews observe Shabbat and biblically ordained Jewish holidays such as Yom Kippur and <b>Passover.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Church of God and Saints of Christ synthesizes rituals {{from both}} Judaism and Christianity. They have adopted rites drawn {{from both the}} Old and New Testaments. Its Old Testament observances {{include the use of}} the Jewish calendar, the celebration of <b>Passover,</b> the {{circumcision}} of infant males, the commemoration of the Sabbath on Saturday, and the wearing of yarmulkes. Its New Testament rites include baptism (immersion) and footwashing, both of which have Old Testament origins.|$|E
5|$|Unlike the White House Hanukkah Party, Obama's White House <b>Passover</b> Seder {{was not a}} {{political}} event. The guest list did not include rabbinical figures, Jewish lobbyists, members of Congress, or Israeli representatives. The guest list of approximately 20 remained basically the same each year. Attendees included {{the president and his}} family, members of the president's and first lady's staff and their families, and friends of the Obamas, with a mix of Jews and non-Jews.|$|E
5|$|According to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs, 522 {{residents}} of Nablus and surrounding refugee camps, including civilians, {{were killed and}} 3,104 injured during IDF military operations from 2000 to 2005. In April 2002, following the <b>Passover</b> massacre—an attack by Palestinian militants that killed 30 Israeli civilians attending a seder dinner at the Park Hotel in Netanya—Israel launched Operation Defensive Shield, a major military operation targeting in particular Nablus and Jenin. At least 80 Palestinians were killed in Nablus during the operation and several houses were destroyed or severely damaged.|$|E
5|$|Angel's Bakery {{opened its}} {{landmark}} factory store {{adjacent to the}} Givat Shaul plant in 1984. The store offers a full selection of packaged breads, rolls, and muffins, bourekas, danishes, fancy cakes, handmade pastries, coffee and soft drinks. For many years, visitors could watch bakers braid challahs through a large side window. At {{the end of the}} <b>Passover</b> holiday, a long line of customers traditionally forms outside the store after midnight, waiting to buy the first bread off the production line.|$|E
5|$|Eugene Sack, {{the father}} of Second Circuit Court of Appeals judge Robert D. Sack, joined Landman as rabbi in 1946. While serving as {{assistant}} rabbi of Congregation Rodeph Shalom of Philadelphia, Sack had been instrumental in {{the founding of the}} Reform movement's National Federation of Temple Youth in 1939, and had presented a paper at its first biennial convention. Starting in 1943 he spent 18 months in the Pacific Theater of Operations of World War II as an army chaplain; at one point he had to substitute peach juice for <b>Passover</b> wine.|$|E
5|$|In addition, Jewish {{holidays}} {{influence the}} cuisine, with {{the preparation of}} traditional foods at holiday times, such as various types of challah (braided bread) for Shabbats and Festivals, jelly doughnuts (sufganiyot) for Hanukah, the hamantaschen pastry (oznei haman) for Purim, charoset, a type of fruit paste, for <b>Passover,</b> and dairy foods for Shavuot. The Shabbat dinner, eaten on Friday, {{and to a lesser}} extent the Shabbat lunch, is a significant meal in Israeli homes, together with holiday meals.|$|E
5|$|On March 20, 1994, Chris Lord, an {{individual}} {{associated with the}} Volksfront and American Front, fired ten rounds with an assault rifle into the temple, damaging the interior. The attacks were prompted by a newspaper article about several members of Eugene's Jewish community, including a lesbian. Community organizations, including a local gay rights group, responded by standing vigil outside the synagogue during <b>Passover</b> services. Lord and an associate were caught and convicted, and Lord was sentenced to {{four and a half}} years in prison.|$|E
5|$|Scholars usually {{agree that}} John {{is not entirely}} without {{historical}} value. It has become generally accepted that certain sayings in John are as old or older than their synoptic counterparts. His representation of the topography around Jerusalem is often superior {{to that of the}} synoptics, his testimony that Jesus was executed before, rather than on, <b>Passover,</b> might well be more accurate, and his presentation of Jesus in the garden and the prior meeting held by the Jewish authorities are possibly more historically plausible than their synoptic parallels.|$|E
5|$|The {{congregation}} {{carried out}} extensive charity campaigns during the <b>Passover</b> season; by 1905 the congregation was distributing wagon-loads of matzos to poor Jews {{so they could}} celebrate the holiday. By 1907–1908 membership had risen to 500 (up from 160 in 1900), the Talmud Torah had 250 students, and the synagogue's annual revenues were $25,000 (today $). The congregation ran into financial difficulties of its own in 1908, and in October of that year raised funds by selling a number of its Torah scrolls in a public auction.|$|E
5|$|The first Rugrats Jewish holiday special was {{suggested}} {{to the production}} staff in 1992 by Nickelodeon executives as a special devoted to Hanukkah. Germain instead refashioned it into a <b>Passover</b> episode and the series did not explore a Hanukkah special until 1996. Critical reaction to Jewish themes in Rugrats was largely positive. Each holiday special achieved high viewing numbers according to Nielsen Media Research and received positive reviews. However, Jewish character Grandpa Boris' portrayal in a 1998 Rugrats comic strip was criticized by the Anti-Defamation League for apparent antisemitism.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{approaches}} {{have been used}} to estimate the year of the crucifixion of Jesus. Most scholars agree that he died in 30 or 33 AD. The gospels state that the event occurred during the prefecture of Pilate, the Roman governor of Judea from 26 to 36 AD. The date for the conversion of Paul (estimated to be 33–36 AD) acts as an upper bound for the date of Crucifixion. The dates for Paul's conversion and ministry can be determined by analyzing the Pauline epistles and the Acts of the Apostles. Astronomers have tried to estimate the precise date of the Crucifixion by analyzing lunar motion and calculating historic dates of <b>Passover,</b> a festival based on the lunisolar Hebrew calendar. The most widely accepted dates derived from this method are April 7, 30 AD, and April 3, 33 AD (both Julian).|$|E
