30|$|In {{addition}} to the pH stability, we investigated {{the behavior of the}} PQDs in aqueous solutions with different ionic strengths. In the experiment, the PL properties of PQDs dispersed in <b>PB</b> <b>buffer</b> solutions at neutral pH were monitored, with NaCl concentration increased from 0 to 300  mM. Over the concentration range of NaCl, we observed little decrease in PL intensity and no change of the emission spectra for PQDs (Figure  4 b, the PL intensity without NaCl added was set to 100 %). This result is very similar with the previous reports [44, 45]. These results of pH and ionic strength stability further highlight that the PQDs may be completely tolerant to intracellular and in vivo environments, where the ionic concentration is known to be less than 150  mM [46].|$|R
40|$|In chiral and non-chiral electrophoretic {{resolution}} of basic drugs, adsorption of analytes to negatively charged capillary wall {{could lead to}} poor repeatability of migration time and peak area. In addition, chiral resolutions of basic drugs are commonly performed in low pH buffers. Therefore, longer analysis time due to suppression of electroosmotic flow (EOF) is another dilemma. In this work the improvement effect of polybrene (PB), a cationic polymer, on chiral separation of a model basic drug, amlodipine (AML), was investigated. PB both as a semi-permanent coating agent and as an additive in the running buffer was utilized. Better results were obtained with <b>PB</b> as a <b>buffer</b> additive. Compare to untreated bare silica without using <b>PB</b> in running <b>buffer,</b> addition of 0. 0005 % <b>PB</b> to <b>buffer</b> decreased analysis time downed to 3 folds; efficiency improved up to 5 folds; limit of detection (LOD) and limit of quantification (LOQ) downed to 8 folds and within-day migration time and peak area repeatabilities, in terms of relative standard deviations (RSD) downed to 5 and 20 folds, respectively...|$|R
50|$|In bioconjugation (forming {{a stable}} {{covalent}} link between a biomolecule and a functional payloads, such as fluorescent dyes, cytotoxic agents, or tracers), linking of the payload was classically achieved using maleimide heterobifunctional reagents (for example, see SMCC). However, when administered into living organisms, maleimide-containing bioconjugates {{were found to}} be relatively unstable and lose the payload in the blood circulation due to reversibility of the addition reaction between maleimide moiety and cysteine residue of a protein (retro Michael addition). Due to increased stability of bioconjugates obtained with analogous APN-based payloads (a schematic reaction is shown in the Figure 2 below), their use is often preferable when high selectivity and biostability are especially important: namely for the preparation of antibody−drug conjugates and other biologics. Standard procedure for APN protein labeling consists in incubation of a protein containing free cysteine residues with an APN-functionalized probe in <b>PBS</b> <b>buffer</b> at pH 7.5-9.0 at room temperature for 2-12 hours, followed by an optional step of purification of the resulting bioconjugate using size exclusion chromatography or ultrafiltration.|$|E

40|$|The uptake of Pb {{into human}} {{red blood cells}} has been studied using <b>Pb</b> <b>buffers.</b> Passive <b>Pb</b> {{movements}} can be studied conveniently when the cells are depleted of adenosine 5 '-triphosphate (ATP), to eliminate active transport, and of inorganic phosphate, to prevent precipitation of lead phosphate. Pb can cross the membrane passively in either direction. Influx and efflux show similar properties. Passive Pb transport is strongly stimulated by HCO 3 -, and is reduced by replacing Cl- with ClO 4 -. It is inhibited by low concentrations of 4 -acetamido- 4 '-isothiocyanostilbene- 2, 2 '-disulphonic acid (SITS) and 4, 4 '-diisothiocyanostilbene- 2. 2 '-disulphonic acid (DIDS), characteristic inhibitors of anion transport. Pb uptake is unaffected by varying the external concentrations of Na+, K+ and Ca 2 +. When Pb enters the cell, it binds mainly to haemoglobin. The ratio of bound Pb:free Pb 2 + in the cytosol {{is estimated to be}} 6000 : 1. Pb binding to haemoglobin is unaffected by oxygenation.
