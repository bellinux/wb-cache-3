25|$|Marmaros (Greek for Marble) was a {{small town}} that formed along with the Marble Cave Mining and Manufacturing Company in 1884. It was {{originally}} called Marble City. It was located on the rough hilltop near the cave and recorded a <b>plat</b> <b>map</b> at the courthouse in Galena, Missouri. Marmaros contained a hotel, general store, pottery shop, white oak furniture factory, and was rumored to have a saloon. The town turned into a ghost town in 1889 after the Marble Cave Mining, Co. closed. When the Lynches bought the cave, the town was {{burned to the ground}} by the local group of vigilantes known as the Bald Knobbers.|$|E
25|$|In 2015, Lopez's great-grandchildren rediscovered a box {{in their}} late grandfather's attic {{containing}} the items Ernesto Lopez had found plus {{what appeared to be}} his wedding photo. The family brought the box to the attention of a local reporter, whose TV news report on the strange find was picked up by several national and international news outlets. However, upon examination, experts at the Tampa Bay History Center determined that the coins were likely a collection of 20th century coins plus souvenirs from an early Gasparilla parade and the map was a <b>plat</b> <b>map</b> from the 1920s with local streets, businesses, and landmarks from that time clearly depicted. The origin of the hand remained a mystery, though the curator of the history center opined that it might be a mummified monkey hand.|$|E

2500|$|The {{area that}} later became Galax {{was part of}} an [...] land grant given to James Buchanan in 1756 by the English Crown. The first <b>plat</b> <b>map</b> for Galax is dated December 1903; The town founders {{selected}} the site for the city on a wide expanse of meadowland bisected by Chestnut Creek and sitting at an altitude of 2,500 feet on a plateau. The Virginia General Assembly officially chartered the town of Galax in 1906. The town is named for Galax urceolata, an evergreen groundcover plant found throughout the Blue Ridge Mountains. [...] At the time, the plant was gathered and sold by many people in southwestern Virginia and northwestern North Carolina as an ornamental plant; a Norfolk and Western Railway Company official suggested that the town be named for the plant. The first Galax Agricultural Fair took place in September 1908, when Galax had 600 residents.|$|E
2500|$|In March 1868, McCarver {{then moved}} north and helped found Tacoma, Washington. He {{first went to}} Olympia, capital of the then Washington Territory, and {{procured}} a map to study the area and consider the most likely terminus of the then planned transcontinental railroad. On April 1, 1868, McCarver arrived at Commencement Bay, a likely railroad terminus on Puget Sound due to its proximity to Snoqualmie Pass, and then purchased the land of Job Carr. He continued buying up available land along Commencement Bay {{in anticipation of the}} railroad. McCarver also convinced Hanson, Ackerson & Company to build a sawmill in the area while he platted a town site and sold-off lots. McCarver wanted to call the city Commencement City, but after a suggestion by Philip Ritz of the Northern Pacific Railroad, McCarver changed his mind. Anthony Carr, Job's son, had already filed a plat for [...] "Tacoma" [...] on November 30, 1869. McCarver chose to call his neighboring plat [...] "Tacoma City," [...] when he filed his <b>plat</b> <b>map</b> on December 3, 1869. The word [...] "Tacoma" [...] may be the purported Native American name for nearby Mount Rainier. Alternatively, it may have been used by Native Americans in the Puget Sound region to describe all snow-topped peaks in the region, and was not specific to Mount Rainier.|$|E

5000|$|The use of {{the chain}} was once very common in laying out townships and mapping the U.S. along the train routes in the 19th century.

40|$|Much of the Watonwan River {{tributary}} {{system to}} the upper Mississippi River basin (UMR), and the fluvial systems to which it drains, are listed as impaired under the United States Environmental Protection Agency Clean Water Act 303 (d) and/or by the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency. In addition, eutrophic conditions and excessive sedimentation rates exist in Lake Pepin, a riverine lake to which the UMR drains. Thus, understanding the hydrogeomorphic change throughout the UMR is vital {{in order to establish}} appropriate efforts to mitigate environmental hazards downstream. This study attempts to evaluate hydrogeomorphic change at the watershed scale in the Watonwan River watershed between 1855 and the near present. Historical <b>plat</b> <b>maps,</b> digital elevation models (DEMs), aerial images, soil/topographic characteristics, land-use change, and field surveys are analyzed. Surficial hydrologic features digitized from historical <b>plat</b> <b>maps</b> are compared with contemporary stream networks extracted from high-resolution DEMs. Scale effects are investigated using multi-resolution (1 m, 3 m, 8. 5 m, and 30 m) DEMs, with 8. 5 m DEMs being ideal for watershed scale analysis, and 1 – 3 m DEMs being ideal for subwatershed analysis. There has been a substantial hydrogeomorphic change in the watershed since 1855, but most significantly, we interpret that the highest rates of erosion occur in the eastern watershed, where knickzone propagation has produced substantial relief...|$|R
