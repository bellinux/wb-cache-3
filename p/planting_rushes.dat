When noontide has passed, and the weary day has driven her team to their western stalls, the fires of heaven rise from the East, moving in their accustomed path, they ascend and descend the skiey hill. When their course is fulfilled, the dial begins to cast westward an uncertain shadow; the eye-lids of day are opened, and birds and flowers, the startled vegetation, and fresh breeze awaken; the sun at length appears, and in majestic procession climbs the capitol of heaven. All proceeds, changes and dies, except the sense of misery in my bursting heart.|$|R

5000|$|For a {{few minutes}} the lives of the entire {{population}} of the south side school hung in the balance, and that all escaped injury is considered little less than a miracle...About 2:30 Oscar Nolan, janitor of the building, started down the hill on an errand. When but a short distance away he happened to glance back and saw a large volume of steam issuing from the escape pipe of the school's steam heating <b>plant.</b> <b>Rushing</b> back to the basement he was horrified to find the boiler dry and very hot, while a big fire raged underneath. He at once gave the alarm to clear the building and then proceeded to the dangerous task of pulling the fires, although he expected every second that the overheated boiler must explode. By his prompt action the catastrophe was averted, but in the opinion of those who visited the place directly after, a delay of five minutes would have caused an entirely different story - one of death and destruction. But a short time before the janitor says his gauge showed the boiler half full of water.

40|$|Australian alpine {{ecosystems}} {{are expected to}} diminish in extent as global warming intensifies. Alpine vegetation patterns {{are influenced by the}} duration of snow cover including the presence of snowdrifts in summer, but there is little quantitative information on landscape-scale relationships between vegetation patterns and the frequency of occurrence of persistent summer snowdrifts in the Australian alps. We mapped annual changes in summer snowdrifts in the Kosciuszko alpine region, Australia, from Landsat TM images and modelled the frequency of occurrence of persistent summer snowdrifts from long-term records (1954 – 2003) of winter snow depth. We then compared vegetation composition and structure among four classes that differed in the frequency of occurrence of persistent summer snowdrifts. We found a curvilinear relationship between annual winter snow depth and the area occupied by persistent snowdrifts in the following summer (r 2 = 0. 9756). Only 21 ha (0. 42 % of study area) was predicted to have supported summer snowdrifts in 80 % of the past 50 years, while 440 ha supported persistent summer snow in 10 % of years. Mean cover and species richness of vascular plants declined significantly, and species composition varied significantly, as the frequency of summer snow persistence increased. Cushion <b>plants</b> and <b>rushes</b> were most abundant where summer snowdrifts occurred most frequently, and shrubs, grasses and sedges were most abundant in areas that did not support snowdrifts in summer. The results demonstrate strong regional relationships between vegetation composition and structure and the frequency of occurrence of persistent summer snowdrifts. Reductions in winter snow depth due to global warming are expected to lead to substantial reductions in the extent of persistent summer snowdrifts. As a consequence, shrubs, grasses and sedges are predicted to expand at the expense of cushion <b>plants</b> and <b>rushes,</b> reducing landscape vegetation diversity. Fortunately, few vascular plant species (e. g. Ranunculus niphophilus) appear to be totally restricted to areas where summer snow occurs most frequently. The results from this study highlight potential indicator species that could be monitored to assess the effects of global warming on Australian alpine environments. <br /...|$|R
