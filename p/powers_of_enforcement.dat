50|$|The {{purpose of}} the ICOC was {{originally}} to determine the legitimacy of orders of chivalry as, since the late 19th century, a number of purported orders had been operating, bestowing (and often selling) chivalric and noble titles.

Problems arise, and networks of actors are constructed to deal with them {{in the absence of an}} international analogue to a domestic government. This system has been termed disaggregated sovereignty.|$|R

50|$|Republic Services, {{along with}} all other waste and {{recycling}} companies, are subject {{to a variety of}} federal, state and local requirements that regulate, among other things, the environment, public health, safety, zoning and land use. Operating and other permits, licenses and other approvals generally are required for landfills and transfer stations, certain solid waste collection vehicles, fuel storage tanks and other facilities that they own or operate. Federal, state and local laws and regulations vary, but generally govern wastewater or storm water discharges, air emissions, the handling, transportation, treatment, storage and disposal of hazardous and non-hazardous waste, and the remediation of contamination associated with the release or threatened release of hazardous substances. These laws and regulations provide governmental authorities with strict <b>powers</b> <b>of</b> <b>enforcement.</b> The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and various other federal, state and local authorities administer these regulations.|$|E
