50|$|<b>Pedalfer</b> is a {{formative}} {{element in}} the United States soil taxonomic system for the Alfisols soil order. Alf is the formative {{element in the}} Alfisol name, and refers to aluminium (Al) and iron (Fe).|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pedalfer</b> is {{composed}} of aluminum and iron oxides. It is a subdivision of the zonal soil order comprising {{a large group of}} soils in which sesquioxides increase relative to silica during soil formation. Pedalfers usually occur in humid areas. It is not used in the current United States system of soil classification but the term commonly shows up in college geology texts.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the handout is to {{identify}} the three major types of soils: <b>pedalfer,</b> pedocal, and laterite, and to understand the soil profile. This is accomplished with brief descriptions of the soil horizons and the designation of common elements to pedalfers, pedocals, and laterite soils. The handout is concluded {{with a discussion of}} soil erosion. Links are provided to the online Physical Geology resources at Georgia Perimeter College. Educational levels: Undergraduate lower division, Undergraduate upper division...|$|E

50|$|In 1920 Marbut {{began his}} work on a soil {{classification}} scheme. In 1927 he published a translation of Glinka's The Great Soil Groups of the World and their Development from German to English. His classification scheme became the 1935 system that was modified to become the system published in the 1938 Yearbook of Agriculture, Soils and Men: the 1938 USDA soil taxonomy. At {{the highest level of}} classification the soils were divided into pedocals and <b>pedalfers.</b> Pedocals were used in the drier climates and referred to the carbonate rich soils. The <b>Pedalfers</b> began about at the Udic border and referred to soils rich in Aluminum (Alumen) and Iron (Ferrous). Alfer became the root term for Alfisols.|$|R
