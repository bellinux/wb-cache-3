30|$|HPN [8] are an {{extension}} of standard PN. They model the coexistence of discrete and continuous variables. HPN have two groups of <b>places</b> <b>and</b> transitions: discrete and continuous. Thus, there are three kinds of directed arcs here: (i) between discrete <b>places</b> <b>and</b> discrete transitions (described by the incidence matrices Pre_dd and Post_dd); (ii) between continuous <b>places</b> <b>and</b> continuous transitions (described by the incidence matrices Pre_cc and Post_cc); (iii) between discrete <b>places</b> <b>and</b> continuous transitions (described by the incidence matrices Pre_dc and Post_dc) {{as well as between}} the continuous <b>places</b> <b>and</b> discrete transitions (described by the incidence matrices Pre_cd and Post_cd). The discrete <b>places</b> <b>and</b> transitions handle discrete tokens, while the continuous <b>places</b> <b>and</b> transitions handle continuous variables.|$|R

5000|$|Everyone is {{the proper}} owner of his own {{physical}} body {{as well as of}} all <b>places</b> <b>and</b> nature-given goods that he occupies and puts to use by means of his body, provided only that no one else has already occupied or used the same <b>places</b> <b>and</b> goods before him.

In particular, once a place or good has been first appropriated by, in John Locke's phrase, 'mixing one's labor' with it, ownership in such <b>places</b> <b>and</b> goods can be acquired only by means of a voluntary - contractual - transfer of its property title from a previous to a later owner.|$|R
