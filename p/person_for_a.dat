5|$|Rights of {{a person}} arrested under {{ordinary}} circumstances is laid down in {{the right to life}} and personal liberty. No one can be arrested without being told the grounds for his arrest. If arrested, the person has the right to defend himself by a lawyer of his choice. Also an arrested citizen has to be brought before the nearest magistrate within 24 hours. The rights {{of a person}} arrested under ordinary circumstances are not available to an enemy alien. They are also not available to persons detained under the Preventive Detention Act. Under preventive detention, the government can imprison a <b>person</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> maximum of three months. It means that if the government feels that a person being at liberty can be a threat to the law and order or to the unity and integrity of the nation, it can detain or arrest that person to prevent him from doing this possible harm. After three months such a case is brought before an advisory board for review.|$|E

25|$|On 20 August 1827, the British naval {{commander-in-chief}} in the Mediterranean, Vice-Admiral of the Blue Sir Edward Codrington (1770–1851), {{a veteran}} of 44 years at sea and a popular hero {{for his role in}} the Battle of Trafalgar, received his government's instructions regarding enforcement of the treaty. Codrington could not have been a less suitable <b>person</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> task which required great tact. He had joined the Royal Navy at age 13 as a midshipman and worked his way to the top by sheer merit and courage. An impetuous fighting sailor, he entirely lacked diplomatic finesse, a quality he despised and derisively ascribed to his French counterpart, H. de Rigny. He was also a sympathiser with the Greek cause, having subscribed to the London Philhellenic Committee.|$|E

25|$|The Humanitarian Daily Ration (HDR) is a {{self-contained}} Halal meal {{designed to be}} given to refugees and other displaced people. It is designed to feed a single <b>person</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> full day, and the menus were intended to be palatable to many religious and cultural tastes around the globe. To meet this goal, no animal products or by-products, no alcohol or alcohol-based products, and minimal dairy products are used in their production. It is otherwise created and packaged much like MREs; feedback from the Afghanistan campaign led to the interior packing being reinforced to withstand being air-dropped, as the packets sometimes ruptured on impact. The outer bag is tinted a high-visibility red or yellow and has an American Flag and a picture of a person eating out of the bag with a spoon. There are usually instructions printed on it in English and one or more local languages as well.|$|E
25|$|Atwater and her husband, Michael Haas, an {{emergency}} room physician at a local hospital, filed suit under 42 U.S.C. § 1983, represented by Charles Lincoln, alleging that the city violated her Fourth Amendment right {{to be free from}} unreasonable seizures by arresting her for a crime whose only punishment was a fine. This argument required her to concede that the police had probable cause to arrest her for violating the seat belt law, and thus the United States District Court for the Western District of Texas found summary judgment for the city. A panel of the Fifth Circuit reversed, holding that arresting a <b>person</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> fine-only misdemeanor was per se unreasonable. The Fifth Circuit sitting en banc reversed the panel, agreeing with the district court's reasoning. Three judges dissented from the en banc panel's ruling, arguing that the police had to have a specific reason for arresting Atwater for only violating the seat belt law. The U.S. Supreme Court agreed to hear the case.|$|E
25|$|No other {{candidates}} were proposed and the Returning Officer called for Dyer {{to give a}} speech to the electors regarding what he would advocate for and his goals if he became the Member of Parliament for Bruce. However, before Dyer made his speech John Hardy stepped in and asked if he could say some words as Henry Clapcott's representative, an action opposed by other electors. Hardy said that in reply to some observations by J. L. Gillies regarding the state of the province of Otago without a treasurer— he would then also like to nominate Marryatt—who was himself an elector for the by-election. The observations were concerning the fact that Clapcott would be forced to resign as Treasurer to take up his role as MP for Bruce. Marryatt had opposed the stepping in of Hardy, without a clue that he would be nominated for the role. Laughingly, J. L. Gillies seconded that nomination. However, Gillies said that an elector may only nominate one <b>person</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> role at an election. The Returning Officer then justified that an elector may nominate as many people as they like. Returning the compliment, Marryatt nominated Hardy for the role, seconded by George E. Brown. However, the Returning Officer took no notice of the nominations, stating that it was immature of the electors to make a joke on such a serious duty. Multiple electors then said that some fun at an election was expected, a stance which the Returning Officer disagreed with.|$|E

500|$|Film writer Paul Simpson notes {{how closely}} Steiger {{prepared}} for his roles, {{and how he}} [...] "effortlessly" [...] recreated the mannerisms of figures such as Mussolini, in a [...] "compelling take on an enigmatic figure". Judith Crist of New York Magazine, reviewing Duck, You Sucker!, commented that Steiger was [...] "totally without mannerisms, always with manner", and noted that his [...] "silences are stunningly effective". Roger Ebert later echoed this statement, concurring that Steiger lacked mannerisms, writing, [...] "When he gets a character worth playing with, he creates it new from the bottom up, out of whole cloth. I don't know how he does it. It's {{almost as if he}} gets inside the skin of the guy he's playing and starts being that <b>person</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> while". Steiger said: [...] "I always tried to do things different. If I got a role which was similar to another I'd try to do it a little different." [...] His explosive screen performances were an influence on many later actors, including Robert De Niro, who used Steiger's portrayal of Al Capone as a reference for his own performance in The Untouchables (1987). Elvis Presley was highly impressed with Steiger's [...] "powerful and wrenching performance" [...] in The Pawnbroker.|$|E
500|$|Muhammad, {{the future}} al-Mu'tasim, {{was born in}} the Khuld ("Eternity") Palace in Baghdad, but the exact date is unclear: {{according}} to the 10th-century historian al-Tabari, his birth was placed by various authorities either in Sha'ban AH 180, i.e. October 796, or in AH 179 (i.e. spring 796 or earlier). His parents were the Caliph Harun al-Rashid (ruled 786–809) and Marida, an otherwise unknown slave concubine. Marida was born in Kufa, but her family hailed from Soghdia, and she is usually considered to have been of Turkic origin. As an adult, including during his caliphate, he was commonly called by his kunya, Abu Ishaq. Al-Tabari describes the adult Abu Ishaq as [...] "fair-complexioned, with a black beard the hair tips of which were red and the end of which was square and streaked with red, and with handsome eyes". Other authors stress his physical strength and his love for physical activity—an anecdote recalls how during the Amorium campaign he went ahead of the army riding on a mule and searched in <b>person</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> shallow crossing-point across a river—in stark contrast to his more sedentary predecessors and successors. Later authors claim he was almost illiterate, but as the historian Hugh Kennedy comments, this [...] "would have been most improbable for an Abbasid prince", and most likely simply reflects his disinterest in intellectual pursuits.|$|E

But the more profound, more lasting idea – being the film fans we are – was Ingmar Bergman. So we hit upon a fantasy situation of him going to Hollywood, which is obviously a lot more universal, too." [...] Before starting work on the musical, the Mael brothers decided to refresh their memories by looking at Bergman's films again. [...] "We were both really big film fans in university. At that time unless you only liked foreign film, and hated American ones, you weren't cool", Ron Mael told The Times. [...] "There was a real kind of seriousness to [...] He actually addressed big things {{and was able to}} frame those in really pure, cinematic ways. Now those things are seen as being kind of pretentious. Everyone wants to be seen as though they don't care about the big issues." [...] Commenting on the suitability of Bergman as the topic of a musical, Russell Mael told a Swedish newspaper, [...] "In a way, he is the least appropriate <b>person</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> musical. We like the absurdity of it all. He was such a deep, intense person {{and the vast majority of}} his films are about really deep topics. But we did not want to ridicule him, we wanted to do something respectful that Bergman would have been able to appreciate." ...|$|E
