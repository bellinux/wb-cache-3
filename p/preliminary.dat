5|$|The extant book {{contains}} <b>preliminary</b> matter, {{the complete}} {{text of the}} Gospels of Matthew, Mark and Luke, and the Gospel of John through John 17:13. The remainder of John and an unknown amount of the <b>preliminary</b> matter is missing and was perhaps lost when the book was stolen early in the 11th century. The remaining <b>preliminary</b> matter consists of two fragmentary lists of Hebrew names contained in the Gospels, Breves causae (Gospel summaries), Argumenta (short biographies of the Evangelists), and Eusebian canon tables. It is probable that, like the Lindisfarne Gospels and the Books of Durrow and Armagh, part of the lost <b>preliminary</b> material included the letter of Jerome to Pope Damasus I beginning Novum opus, in which Jerome explains the purpose of his translation. It is also possible, though less likely, that the lost material included the letter of Eusebius to Carpianus, in which he explains {{the use of the}} canon tables. Of all the insular Gospels, only the Lindisfarne manuscript contains this letter.|$|E

5|$|An oil sketch {{attributed}} to Etty, given to York Art Gallery in 1952 by Judith Hare, Countess of Listowel and entitled Three Female Nudes, is possibly a <b>preliminary</b> study by Etty for Youth and Pleasure, or a copy {{by a student}} of the three central figures. Art historian Sarah Burnage considers both possibilities unlikely, as neither the arrangement of figures, the subject matter or the sea serpent approaching the group appear to relate to the completed Youth and Pleasure, and considers it more likely to be a <b>preliminary</b> sketch for a now-unknown work.|$|E

5|$|Atlético Mineiro did {{not qualify}} for any {{continental}} competitions in 2001 or 2002, a season in which Brazil did not have representatives in {{the first edition of}} Copa Sudamericana, the new cup which replaced Copa Mercosur and Copa Merconorte. The club qualified for the 2003 Copa Sudamericana, taking part in a single round-robin <b>preliminary</b> group stage for Brazilian clubs, with Fluminense and Corinthians. Atlético defeated the latter 20 in São Paulo, but lost to the former 20 at home, and did {{not qualify for}} the second <b>preliminary</b> stage. The club became a regular participant in the Copa Sudamericana in the 2000s, but failed to advance from the Brazilian <b>preliminary</b> round in most tournaments. In 2004, Atlético fell to Goiás with a 42 away loss and a 11 home draw. Going through a bad period in its history, which included relegation in 2005, the club was absent from continental football for three years between 2005 and 2007.|$|E
