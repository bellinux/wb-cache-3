5000|$|During the American Civil War, {{when the}} Union Army invaded his home state, Smith had to flee north to British Columbia {{because of his}} {{well-known}} Southern sympathies. He returned to Virginia in 1862 by way of steamer to Baltimore, Maryland, {{and then on to}} Richmond. Smith enlisted in the Confederate Army and was appointed Captain in the Engineer Corps of the Army of Northern Virginia in charge of the Confederate <b>pontoon</b> <b>service.</b> He was instrumental in the defense of Petersburg and Richmond during the Siege of Petersburg, and was present at the surrender of Confederate forces at Appomattox Court House. Smith returned home with [...] "an old gray uniform, much tattered and worn, a good horse and a large amount of experience." ...|$|E
50|$|It {{was built}} {{as part of}} an order to {{construct}} four berthing <b>pontoons,</b> one <b>service</b> barge <b>pontoon</b> and four gangways. The request for proposal was issued on 7 March 2011 and the contract was signed on June 2011. By February 2013 it had been delivered and was stationed at Naval Dockyard, Mumbai. GSL class berthing pontoons are its cousin sister ships.|$|R
50|$|On October 29, 2012 Hurricane Sandy caused major {{damage to}} the Greenville facility, {{undermining}} the float bridge gantries and sinking one of the car floats. The 81-year-old gantry structures were ultimately demolished. The working float bridge at Bush Terminal was transferred by barge to Greenville, where it was re-designated the Greenville <b>Pontoon</b> Bridge. <b>Service</b> was restored in late December, after 52 days of intensive reconstruction.|$|R
40|$|The {{establishment}} of a tourist destination <b>pontoon</b> <b>serviced</b> by 300 seat international catamarans on Nonnan Reef to the NE of Cairns prompted the GBRMPA to require an on-going biological monitoring program to be implemented. The aims of the program were to attempt to establish the effect such intensive tourist operations were having on the reef community; specifically on the percentage cover of encrusting organisms, the height of coral colonies and the density of selected fish species. Surveys of corals, other encrusting organisms and fishes were made at 4 sites on Nonnan Reef between March 1987 and June 1988. Sites were: adjacent to the Great Adventures pontoon; {{in the area of}} Great Adventures semi-submersible operation; adjacent to the Deep Sea Divers Den main mooring; and at an undisturbed control area. A total of 35 permanent 20 m line transects were used to measure the cover of corals and other encrusting organisms. Measures of coral height were also made at each site. Fishes were counted along 5 haphazard 50 x 20 m transects at each site. Corals were only affected directly by the pontoon, either by shading or mooring chain abrasion. This affected an area of about 365 square metres of potential coral habita...|$|R
50|$|In early 1944, Achelous left India {{and sailed}} to the Mediterranean to support {{operations}} along the Italian coast. She remained at these duties for seven months. In July, the landing craft repair ship began {{preparations for the}} assault on the southern coast of France. In mid-August, she dropped anchor off the French coast and set up a <b>pontoon</b> drydock to <b>service</b> landing craft used in the invasion. These duties occupied her through most of 1944. Late in the year, the repair ship was reassigned to the Pacific Ocean and began her voyage via the Strait of Gibraltar and the Panama Canal to her new area of operations. She transited the Panama Canal on 7 March 1945 and proceeded to Eniwetok, where she arrived on 24 April. Achelous then was assigned to support the invasion and occupation of Okinawa, her last combat operation of World War II. Following the War, Achelous returned to the west coast. She was placed out of commission in reserve in January 1947 and berthed in the Columbia River Group of the Pacific Reserve Fleet. Achelous name was struck from the Naval Vessel Register on 1 June 1973 and the ship was sold on 21 January 1974 to Overseas Shipyard, Ltd. of Hong Kong for scrapping.|$|R
