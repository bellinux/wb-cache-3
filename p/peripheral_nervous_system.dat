5|$|The {{cranial nerves}} are {{considered}} {{components of the}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> (PNS), although on a structural level the olfactory, optic and terminal nerves are more accurately {{considered part of the}} central nervous system (CNS).|$|E
5|$|Nervous {{tissue is}} {{composed}} of many nerve cells known as neurons which transmit information. In some slow-moving radially symmetrical marine animals such as ctenophores and cnidarians (including sea anemones and jellyfish), the nerves form a nerve net, but in most animals they are organized longitudinally into bundles. In simple animals, receptor neurons in the body wall cause a local reaction to a stimulus. In more complex animals, specialized receptor cells such as chemoreceptors and photoreceptors are found in groups and send messages along neural networks {{to other parts of}} the organism. Neurons can be connected together in ganglia. In higher animals, specialized receptors are the basis of sense organs and there is a central nervous system (brain and spinal cord) and a <b>peripheral</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> The latter consists of sensory nerves that transmit information from sense organs and motor nerves that influence target organs. The <b>peripheral</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> is divided into the somatic nervous system which conveys sensation and controls voluntary muscle, and the autonomic nervous system which involuntarily controls smooth muscle, certain glands and internal organs, including the stomach.|$|E
40|$|The <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> can {{initially}} {{be divided}} {{up into the}} central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems.</b> The central <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> is the brain and spinal cord and drugs that modify the central <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> are considered as a subject in systematic pharmacology (therapeutics) section.

5|$|Peptides {{in black}} mamba venom {{have been found}} to be {{effective}} analgesics. These peptides, part of the 'three-finger' family of snake venom toxins (mambalgins), act as inhibitors for acid-sensing ion channels in the central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system,</b> causing a pain-inihibiting effect. While this effect can be as strong as that of morphine, mambalgins do not have a resistance to naloxone, suffer less from induced tolerance, and cause no respiratory distress.|$|E
5|$|The {{benzodiazepine}} {{class of}} drugs also interact with peripheral benzodiazepine receptors. Peripheral benzodiazepine receptors {{are present in}} <b>peripheral</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> tissues, glial cells, {{and to a lesser}} extent the central nervous system. These peripheral receptors are not structurally related or coupled to GABAA receptors. They modulate the immune system and are involved in the body response to injury. Benzodiazepines also function as weak adenosine reuptake inhibitors. It has been suggested that some of their anticonvulsant, anxiolytic, and muscle relaxant effects may be in part mediated by this action.|$|E
5|$|The name {{multiple}} sclerosis {{refers to the}} scars (sclerae – better known as plaques or lesions) that form in the nervous system. These lesions most commonly affect the white matter in the optic nerve, brain stem, basal ganglia, and spinal cord, or white matter tracts close to the lateral ventricles. The function of white matter cells is to carry signals between grey matter areas, where the processing is done, {{and the rest of}} the body. The <b>peripheral</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> is rarely involved.|$|E

Here, we investigated the expression of factor X mRNA {{in the brain and}} some cell lines derived from the central <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> Reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) demonstrated the expression of mRNA encoding factor X in the rat brain, A 172 (human glioblastoma) and GOTO (human neuroblastoma) cells. The sequences of PCR-derived fragments were identical to those reported for rat and human factor X. These results indicated the synthesis of factor X in the cells of the central <b>nervous</b> <b>system...</b>|$|R
5|$|Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} (GBS) is a rapid-onset {{muscle weakness}} {{caused by the}} immune system damaging the <b>peripheral</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system.</b> The initial symptoms are typically changes in sensation or pain along with muscle weakness, beginning in the feet and hands. This often spreads to the arms and upper body with both sides being involved. The symptoms develop over hours to a few weeks. During the acute phase, the disorder can be life-threatening with about 15% developing weakness of the breathing muscles requiring mechanical ventilation. Some are affected by changes in {{the function of the}} autonomic nervous system, which can lead to dangerous abnormalities in heart rate and blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|In general, blue-staining red-pored boletes {{should be}} avoided for consumption. Thiers warned this species may be toxic after being alerted to severe {{gastrointestinal}} symptoms in one who had merely tasted it. Years later, in 1994, a couple developed gastrointestinal symptoms after eating this fungus and the husband died as a result. A subsequent autopsy revealed {{that the man had}} suffered an infarction of the midgut. Rubroboletus pulcherrimus was the only bolete that had been implicated in the death of someone consuming it, It is known to contain low levels of muscarine, a <b>peripheral</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> toxin. until 2005. A report from Australia records a fatality from muscarinic syndrome after consuming a mushroom from the genus Rubinoboletus.|$|E
5|$|The nerve {{dysfunction}} in Guillain–Barré {{syndrome is}} caused by an immune attack on the nerve cells of the <b>peripheral</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> and their support structures. The nerve cells have their body (the soma) in the spinal cord and a long projection (the axon) that carries electrical nerve impulses to the neuromuscular junction where the impulse is transferred to the muscle. Axons are wrapped in a sheath of Schwann cells that contain myelin. Between Schwann cells are gaps (nodes of Ranvier) where the axon is exposed. Different types of Guillain–Barré syndrome feature different types of immune attack. The demyelinating variant (AIDP, see below) features damage to the myelin sheath by white blood cells (T lymphocytes and macrophages); this process is preceded by activation {{of a group of}} blood proteins known as complement. In contrast, the axonal variant is mediated by IgG antibodies and complement against the cell membrane covering the axon without direct lymphocyte involvement.|$|E

5|$|Drinking {{more than}} one drink a day for women or two drinks for men {{increases}} the risk of heart disease, high blood pressure, atrial fibrillation, and stroke. Risk is greater in younger people due to binge drinking which may result in violence or accidents. About 3.3 million deaths (5.9% of all deaths) are believed to be due to alcohol each year. Alcoholism reduces a person's life expectancy by around ten years and alcohol use is the third leading cause of early death in the United States. No professional medical association recommends that people who are nondrinkers should start drinking wine. Long-term alcohol abuse can cause a number of physical symptoms, including cirrhosis of the liver, pancreatitis, epilepsy, polyneuropathy, alcoholic dementia, heart disease, nutritional deficiencies, peptic ulcers and sexual dysfunction, and can eventually be fatal. Other physical effects include an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease, malabsorption, alcoholic liver disease, and cancer. Damage to the central nervous system and <b>peripheral</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>system</b> can occur from sustained alcohol consumption. A wide range of immunologic defects can result and there may be a generalized skeletal fragility, in addition to a recognized tendency to accidental injury, resulting a propensity to bone fractures.|$|E

50|$|Clinical {{neurophysiology}} is {{a medical}} specialty that studies the central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> through the recording of bioelectrical activity, whether spontaneous or stimulated. It encompasses both research regarding the pathophysiology along with clinical methods used to diagnose diseases involving both central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems.</b> Examinations in the clinical neurophysiology field {{are not limited to}} tests conducted in a laboratory. It is thought of as an extension of a neurologic consultation. Tests that are conducted are concerned with measuring the electrical functions of the brain, spinal cord, and nerves in the limbs and muscles. It can give the precise definition of site, the type and degree of the lesion, along with revealing the abnormalities that are in question. Due to these abilities, clinical neurophysiology is used to mainly help diagnose diseases rather than treat them.|$|R
40|$|International audienceOnly a few methods permit {{researchers}} to study selected {{regions of the}} central and <b>peripheral</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>systems</b> with a spatial and time resolution sufficient to image the function of neural structures.

Here, we show that fibred fluorescence microscopy-which uses a small-diameter fibre-optic probe to provide real-time images-has the spatial resolution to image various neural structures in the living animal, the consistency needed for a sequential, quantitative evaluation of axonal degeneration/regeneration of a peripheral nerve, and the sensitivity to detect calcium transients on a sub-second timescale. These unique features should prove useful in many physiological studies requiring the in situ functional imaging of tissues in a living animal...|$|R
