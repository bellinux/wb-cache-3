Dry and sweet white Bordeaux, including oak-aged examples from Pessac-Léognan and Graves, as well as some Loire wines from Pouilly-Fumé and Sancerre are some of the few examples of Sauvignon blancs with aging potential.|$|E
5|$|As {{early as}} 1300, the port {{exported}} wheat, <b>peas</b> <b>and</b> beans to Ireland, France and Spain, and by 1400 was also exporting cloth from Somerset and the adjoining counties. By 1500 {{it was the}} largest port in Somerset, later becoming the fifth largest in England, until eclipsed by Bristol in the 18th century. In its heyday, imports included wine, grain, fish, hemp, coal and timber. Exports included wheat, wool, cloth, cement, bricks and tiles. Unlike Bristol, Bridgwater was never involved in the slave trade and, in 1797, was the first town in Britain to petition the government to ban it.|$|E
5|$|Cowpeas {{are grown}} mostly for their edible beans, {{although}} the leaves, green <b>peas</b> <b>and</b> green pea pods {{can also be}} consumed, meaning the cowpea {{can be used as}} a food source before the dried peas are harvested. Like other legumes, cowpea grain is cooked to make it edible, usually by boiling. Cowpeas can be prepared in stews, soups, purees and casseroles, but the most common way to eat them is in curries. They can also be processed into a paste or flour. Chinese long beans can be eaten raw or cooked, but as they easily become waterlogged are usually sautéed, stir-fried, or deep-fried.|$|E
40|$|Single i. v. doses of, 6 -phenylethylamine (<b>PEA)</b> <b>and</b> its N-methyl homolog (NMPEA) were {{administered}} to separate groups of five dogs. The dose- and time-related effects of these com-pounds were determined on pupil diameter, heart rate and body temperature. Blood samples were obtained concurrently with the physiologic measures and plasma levels of <b>PEA</b> <b>and</b> NMPEA were determined by gas chromatography. Both com-pounds dilated pupils, tended to produce an initial tachycardia followed by a bradycardia and elevated body temperature. The plasma pharmacokinetics of both <b>PEA</b> <b>and</b> NMPEA could be described by first-order kinetics which estimated half-lives of approximately 5 to 1 0 mm.

40|$|Genotype had a {{significant}} effect on protein and starch concentrations in <b>pea</b> <b>and</b> fababean, on pasting, trough, cooling and final viscosities of starch from <b>pea</b> <b>and</b> fababean, and on onset and peak temperatures of gelatinization of starch from fababean. Significant genotype x environment interactions were observed for the concentrations of starch in <b>pea</b> <b>and</b> fababean, the concentration of amylose, endothermic enthalpy and trough viscosity in starch from fababean, and pasting viscosities of starch from pea. The effects of genotype and environment on the physicochemical characteristics of starch from <b>pea</b> <b>and</b> fababean grown in western Canada would likely not be of practical significance. Native, heat-moisture-treated and pregelatinized blends of <b>pea</b> starch <b>and</b> starch from corn, waxy corn, high-amylose corn or potato exhibited a variety of functionalities due to differences in the functionalities of the constituent starches and to the effects of heat-moisture treatment and pregelatinization. Compared to calculated weighted average values, blends of <b>pea</b> starch <b>and</b> corn starch exhibited lower degrees of syneresis and lower shear stabilities, blends of <b>pea</b> starch <b>and</b> waxy corn starch exhibited higher degrees of syneresis and lower shear stabilities, <b>and</b> blends of <b>pea</b> starch <b>and</b> high-amylose corn starch exhibited lower viscosities and lower shear stabilities. In general, heat-moisture treatment of blends reduced pasting viscosities, swelling and degree of syneresis as compared to respective native starch blends. Compared to pea starch, combinations of <b>pea</b> starch <b>and</b> galactomannans (guar gum and locust bean gum) exhibited increased viscosities during pasting, whereas combinations of <b>pea</b> starch <b>and</b> anionic hydrocolloids (xanthan gum and carboxymethylcellulose) exhibited increased viscosities at lower inclusion rates only. Generally, combinations of <b>pea</b> starch <b>and</b> guar gum exhibited less syneresis than combinations of <b>pea</b> starch <b>and</b> locust bean gum, xanthan gum or carboxymethylcellulose. It was concluded that some blends of <b>pea</b> starch <b>and</b> starch from corn, waxy corn, high- amylose corn or potato may have potential in food applications such as confectionery, batters and breadings, breakfast cereals, retorted products, snack foods and baked goods, and that some combinations of <b>pea</b> starch <b>and</b> hydrocolloids might offer functionality that would be of practical use...|$|R
40|$|Background: Serologic {{cross-reactivity}} among legumes {{has been}} described; however, it is rarely clinically significant. In this study 3 {{patients with a}} history of anaphylaxis to pea are described who subsequently had symptoms after ingestion of peanut. Objective: We investigated whether the peanut-related symptoms were due to cross-reactivity between <b>pea</b> <b>and</b> peanut proteins. Methods: Peanut-related symptoms were documented according to case history or double-blind, placebo-controlled food challenge results. Skin prick tests were performed, and specific IgE levels were determined for <b>pea</b> <b>and</b> peanut with the CAP system FEIA. IgE-binding proteins in <b>pea</b> <b>and</b> peanut were identified by using immunoblot analysis. Cross-reactivity was studied by means of immunoblot and ELISA inhibition studies with whole extracts and purified allergens. Results: Peanut-related symptoms consisted of oral symptoms in all patients, with additional urticaria and dyspnea or angioedema in 2 patients. All patients had a positive skin prick test response and an increased IgE level to <b>pea</b> <b>and</b> peanut. Immunoblotting revealed strong IgE binding to mainly vicilin in <b>pea</b> extract <b>and</b> exclusively to Ara h 1 in crude peanut extract. Immunoblot and ELISA inhibition studies with crude extracts, as well as purified proteins, showed that IgE binding to peanut could be inhibited by pea but not or only partially the other way around. Conclusion: Clinically relevant cross-reactivity between <b>pea</b> <b>and</b> peanut does occur. Vicilin homologues in <b>pea</b> <b>and</b> peanut (Ara h 1) are the molecular basis for this cross-reactivit...|$|R
5|$|It was {{not until}} after 9,500 BC that the eight {{so-called}} founder crops of agriculture appear: first emmer and einkorn wheat, then hulled barley, peas, lentils, bitter vetch, chick <b>peas</b> <b>and</b> flax. These eight crops occur more or less simultaneously on Pre-Pottery Neolithic B (PPNB) sites in the Levant, although wheat {{was the first to}} be grown and harvested on a significant scale. At around the same time (9400 BC), parthenocarpic fig trees were domesticated.|$|E
5|$|On a more {{practical}} level, the central government took an active interest in supporting agriculture. Producing food was the top priority of land use. Larger farms (latifundia) achieved an economy of scale that sustained urban life and its more specialized division of labour. Small farmers benefited from the development of local markets in towns and trade centres. Agricultural techniques such as crop rotation and selective breeding were disseminated throughout the Empire, and new crops were introduced from one province to another, such as <b>peas</b> <b>and</b> cabbage to Britain.|$|E
5|$|Radishes can {{be useful}} as {{companion}} plants for many other crops, probably because their pungent odour deters such insect pests as aphids, cucumber beetles, tomato hornworms, squash bugs, and ants. They can function as a trap crop, luring insect pests away from the main crop. Cucumbers and radishes seem to thrive when grown in close association with each other, and radishes also grow well with chervil, lettuce, <b>peas,</b> <b>and</b> nasturtiums. However, they react adversely to growing in close association with hyssop.|$|E

5|$|Despite some concerns, western vegetarians and vegans do {{not suffer}} any more from overt zinc {{deficiency}} than meat-eaters. Major plant sources of zinc include cooked dried beans, sea vegetables, fortified cereals, soy foods, nuts, <b>peas,</b> <b>and</b> seeds. However, phytates in many whole-grains and fibers {{may interfere with}} zinc absorption and marginal zinc intake has poorly understood effects. The zinc chelator phytate, found in seeds and cereal bran, can contribute to zinc malabsorption. Some evidence suggests that more than the US RDA (15mg) of zinc daily may be needed in those whose diet is high in phytates, such as some vegetarians. These considerations must be balanced against the paucity of adequate zinc biomarkers, and {{the most widely used}} indicator, plasma zinc, has poor sensitivity and specificity. Diagnosing zinc deficiency is a persistent challenge.|$|E
5|$|Humans {{depend on}} plants for food, either {{directly}} or as feed for domestic animals. Agriculture deals with the production of food crops, and has {{played a key role}} in the history of world civilizations. Agriculture includes agronomy for arable crops, horticulture for vegetables and fruit, and forestry for timber. About 7,000 species of plant have been used for food, though most of today's food is derived from only 30 species. The major staples include cereals such as rice and wheat, starchy roots and tubers such as cassava and potato, and legumes such as <b>peas</b> <b>and</b> beans. Vegetable oils such as olive oil provide lipids, while fruit and vegetables contribute vitamins and minerals to the diet.|$|E

5|$|Severe C. maculatus, infestations {{can affect}} 100% of the stored <b>peas</b> <b>and</b> cause up to 60% grain loss {{within a few}} months. The weevil {{generally}} enters the cowpea pod through holes pre-harvest and lays eggs on the dry seed. The larvae burrow {{their way into the}} seed, feeding on the endosperm. The weevil develops into a sexually mature adult within the seed. An individual bruchid will lay 20–40 eggs, and in optimal conditions each egg can develop into a reproductively active adult in 3 weeks. The most common methods of protection involve the use of insecticides, the main pesticides used being carbomates, synthetic pyrethoids and organophosphates.|$|E
5|$|A {{computer}} program such as KetoCalculator {{may be used}} to help generate recipes. The meals often have four components: heavy whipping cream, a protein-rich food (typically meat), a fruit or vegetable and a fat such as butter, vegetable oil or mayonnaise. Only low-carbohydrate fruits and vegetables are allowed, which excludes bananas, potatoes, <b>peas</b> <b>and</b> corn. Suitable fruits are divided into two groups based on the amount of carbohydrate they contain, and vegetables are similarly divided into two groups. Foods within each of these four groups may be freely substituted to allow for variation without needing to recalculate portion sizes. For example, cooked broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cauliflower and green beans are all equivalent. Fresh, canned or frozen foods are equivalent, but raw and cooked vegetables differ, and processed foods are an additional complication. Parents are required to be precise when measuring food quantities on an electronic scale accurate to 1g. The child must eat the whole meal and cannot have extra portions; any snacks must be incorporated into the meal plan. A small amount of MCT oil {{may be used to}} help with constipation or to increase ketosis.|$|E
5|$|Early {{freight traffic}} {{consisted}} of agricultural products, including carrots, celery, clover, peas, potatoes, sugar beet and swedes, together with {{large volumes of}} peat from Swinefleet Works near Reedness Junction and from Hatfield Works on the Hatfield Moor Branch.

In the 1920s, stations notified the control centre at Goole {{of the number of}} wagons they would need for consignments of <b>peas</b> <b>and</b> potatoes, and could also request additional trains. 4,000 tons of green peas were despatched during the 1926 growing season, and in the following year, 7,000 bundles of celery left Epworth station in a three-day period. Traffic started to decline in the 1930s, as motor lorries began {{to take some of the}} trade. By 1937, there were only three workings each day, and those were run if required.

40|$|The present work {{is carried}} out to {{evaluate}} potential applications of aqueous extracts of two microalgae Isochrysis galbana (<b>PEA)</b> <b>and</b> Nannochloropsis oculata (PEB) containing mainly polysaccharides. The monosaccharide composition of microalgal extracts was determined. GC–MS analyses after derivatization show that glucose is the major compound in both microalgae PEA (56. 88 %) and PEB (68. 23 %). Mannitol (38. 8 %) and inositol (20. 32 %) are respectively the second major compounds in <b>PEA</b> <b>and</b> PEB. Silylation of monosaccharides allows the determination of sorbitol that attained 3. 38 % in PEB. The determination of antioxidant, antimicrobial and cytotoxic properties were also analyzed.

5|$|The Royalists {{turned their}} {{attention}} to the harbour over the next week, placing artillery units on the cliff-tops above it, and bombarding any ships within. On the morning of 22 May, such an attack sunk a barge laden with malt and <b>peas,</b> <b>and</b> was followed by a raiding party of around 50 men that evening, who attacked the harbour, setting fire to the barges that remained. During the fighting to drive them back, Captain Thomas Pyne, who had commanded the town's cavalry, was mortally wounded. Pyne died of fever four days later, despite the attentions of a surgeon. The Earl of Warwick arrived on 23 May with eight ships and the promise of as much help as he could provide, including 400 of his seamen to help garrison the town. Pyne's funeral was held on 27 May, and upon the firing volley from the town's ordnance and musketeers, the besieging army signalled a second attempt to storm the town. The town came under barrage from the enemy batteries, and scaling ladders were brought against the earthen fortifications. Once again the attack was repelled by the town's defenders, and a parley request from Maurice in the immediate aftermath was turned down for fear of treachery.|$|E
5|$|Theophrastus groups {{together}} the cereals and the legumes (<b>peas</b> <b>and</b> beans), and includes millet and other many-seeded plants like sesame also. These {{can only be}} grown from seed. They can be sown early, as with wheat, barley and beans, or in spring after the equinox, for plants like lentils, tares and peas. Vetch and chickpeas can, he reports, be sown at either season. When sprouting, beans form a shape like a penis, from which the root grows down and the leafy stem upwards. Wheat and barley flower {{for four or five}} days, whereas the legumes flower for much longer. Theophrastus reports that these plants grow differently according to the region, so for instance crops in Salamis appear earlier than those elsewhere in Attica. Wheat varieties are recorded as being named for their localities; they differ in colour, size, growth habit and food value. In a place near Bactra in Asia the wheat grains are said to grow as big as the stone of an olive, whereas pulses do not in Theophrastus's view vary to the same extent.|$|E
5|$|Crop {{diversity}} is {{an aspect of}} biodiversity important for food security. The loss of bio{{diversity is}} considered one of today’s most serious environmental concerns by the Food and Agriculture Organization. If current trends persist, as many as half of all plant species could face extinction. Among the many threatened species are wild relatives of our crops – the wild and weedy cousins of domesticated plants that possess valuable traits for crop breeding, such as pest and disease resistance. Some 6% of wild relatives of cereal crops such as wheat, maize, rice, and sorghum are under threat, as are 18% of legumes (Fabaceae), the wild relatives of beans, <b>peas</b> <b>and</b> lentils, and 13% of species within the botanical family (Solanaceae) that includes potato, tomato, eggplant (aubergine), and peppers (Capsicum). In 2016, 29% of wild relative plant species were completely missing from the world’s genebanks, with a further 24% represented by fewer than 10 samples. Over 70% of all crop wild relative species worldwide were in urgent need of further collecting to improve their representation in genebanks, and over 95% were insufficiently represented with regard to the full range of geographic and ecological variation in their native distributions. While the most critical priorities for further collecting were found in the Mediterranean and Near East, Western and Southern Europe, Southeast and East Asia, and South America, crop wild relatives insufficiently represented in genebanks are distributed across almost all countries worldwide.|$|E
