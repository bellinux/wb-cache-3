40|$|A {{geometric}} dissection is {{a cutting}} {{of one or}} more geometric gures into pieces that we can rearrange to form one or more other geometric gures [3]. When applied to two-dimensional gures, dissections are not only demon-strations of the equivalence of area but also a source of enchantment since ancient times. In the last hundred years, there has been an increasing em-phasis on nding dissections that use the fewest possible number of pieces. Various dissections have remarkable properties. One such property is the hingeability of pieces, which has been explored in some depth in [4]: Swing the pieces one way on their hinges to form one gure, say an equilateral triangle; swing them another way to form another gure, say a square. Dif-ferent types of hinges eect dierent types of motion, ranging from swinging to twisting, and most recently, to folding [5]. In this article, we focus on a <b>piano</b> <b>hinge,</b> which connects two pieces along a shared edge and allows a folding motion.

40|$|A {{new test}} method is {{presented}} {{for the purpose}} of investigating migration of a delamination between neighboring ply interfaces in fiber-reinforced, polymer matrix tape laminates. The test is a single cantilever beam configuration consisting of a cross-ply laminate with a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) insert implanted at the mid-plane and spanning part way {{along the length of the}} specimen. The insert is located between a 0 -degree ply (specimen length direction) and a stack of four 90 -degree plies (specimen width direction). The specimen is clamped at both ends onto a rigid baseplate and is loaded on its upper surface via a <b>piano</b> <b>hinge.</b> Tests were conducted with the load-application point located on the intact portion of the specimen in order to initiate delamination growth onset followed by migration of the delamination to a neighboring 90 / 0 ply interface by kinking through the 90 - degree ply stack. Varying this position was found to affect the distance relative to the load-application point at which migration initiated. In each specimen, migration initiated by a gradual transition of the delamination at the 0 / 90 interface into the 90 - degree ply stack. In contrast, transition of the kinked crack into the 90 / 0 interface was sudden. Fractography of the specimens indicated that delamination prior to migration was generally mixed mode-I/II. Inspection of the kink surface revealed mode-I fracture. In general, use of this test allows for the observation of the growth of a delamination followed by migration of the delamination to another ply interface, and should thus provide a means for validating analyses aimed at simulating migration...|$|E

50|$|The basic {{configuration}} of the PL-2 incorporates two-place, side by side seating, a low wing of rectangular plan form, and tricycle landing gear. The overall layout is compact and light compared with some other contemporary aircraft in the same category. The structure is stressed to + 6 g’s limit for safety and aerobatics. Aluminum 2024-T3 is the basic material. Landing gear and engine mount are made from 4130 steel tubes and plates. There are no double curvature skins in the whole airplane. Very few formed blocks are necessary, considering that the wing and horizontal tail have constant chord.The wing has a 15% thickness laminar airfoil, with the single spar located at the maximum thickness and is assembled as a unit to the fuselage and can be removed in approximately two hours.The wing-fuselage connection is provided by two bolts at the main spar and two bolts at the rear spar. The seats form an integral structure with the wing. Also, the control sticks and flap control lever are directly attached to the wing structure. The elevator trim {{is located in a}} center box between the seats. Aileron and flaps are piano-hinged to the bottom skin. The elevator trim is located in a center box between the seats. Aileron and flaps are <b>piano</b> <b>hinged</b> to the bottom skin. Ailerons are mass-balanced and push-pull controlled, having differential displacement.

50|$|The PL-4A is a sport {{airplane}} {{intended to}} answer {{the need for a}} well designed, all-metal airplane which is easy to build, easy to fly, with low initial and operating costs, and folding wings so that it may be towed behind an automobile and stored at home. It is a low-wing airplane, VW-powered, with a closed or open cockpit large enough to accommodate even very large persons, and a generous baggage compartment. A “T” tail configuration improves rudder effectiveness and prevents the stabilator from interfering with the folded wings.Wing: In order to favor takeoff and climb performance, a high aspect ratio of 8 is used, which in combination with a large diameter, slow turning prop should provide good performance even at high altitude airports. The airfoil is the NACA 633418, which has a mild stall and a good overall performance even at “standard roughness.” The 18% thickness provides a deep spar, high torsional rigidity, and makes possible the simple, compact fittings at the wing folding joint, which are band-sawed from aluminum plate. The chord is constant at 40 in., and there is no washout.The ailerons have differential travel to minimize, adverse yaw. They are hinged at the bottom skin with standard <b>piano</b> <b>hinges,</b> as in the PL-1 and 2, providing smooth airflow {{over the top of the}} “down” aileron, and a good gap seal. The mass balance is concentrated in a lead weight attached to an arm extending into the wing box.|$|R
40|$|Two {{different}} unidirectional {{composite materials}} {{were provided by}} NASA Langley Research Center and tested by the Composite Materials Research Group within the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Wyoming. Double cantilever beam and end notched flexure tests were performed to measure the mode I (crack opening) and mode II (sliding or shear) interlaminar fracture toughness of the two materials. The two composites consisted of IM 7 carbon fiber combined with either RP 46 resin toughened with special formulation of LaRC IA resin, known as JJS 1356; or PES chain extended thermoplastic resin known as JJS 1361. Double Cantilever Beam Specimen Configuration and Test Methods As received from NASA, the test specimens were nominally 0. 5 inch wide, 6 inches long, and 0. 2 inch thick. A 1 inch long Kapton insert at the midplane of {{one end of the}} specimen (placed during laminate fabrication) facilitated crack initiation and extension. It was noted that the specimens provided were smaller than the nominal 1. 5 inch wide, 9. 0 inch long configuration specified. Similarly, the Kapton inserts were of greater length than those in the present specimens. Hence, the data below should not be compared directly to those generated with the referenced methods. No preconditioning was performed on the specimens prior to testing. In general, the methodology was used for the present work. Crack opening loads were introduced to the specimens via <b>piano</b> <b>hinges</b> attached to the main specimen faces at a single end of each specimen.

40|$|In this paper, we derive {{analytical}} expressions {{for mass}} and stiffness functions of transversely vibrating clamped-clamped non-uniform beams under no axial loads, which are isospectral {{to a given}} uniform axially loaded beam. Examples of such axially loaded beams are beam columns (compressive axial load) and piano strings (tensile axial load). The Barcilon-Gottlieb transformation is invoked to transform the non-uniform beam equation into the axially loaded uniform beam equation. The coupled ODEs involved in this transformation are solved for two specific cases (pq (z) = k (0) and q = q (0)), and analytical solutions for mass and stiffness are obtained. Examples of beams having a rectangular cross section are shown as a practical application of the analysis. Some non-uniform beams are found whose frequencies are known exactly since uniform axially loaded beams with clamped ends have closed-form solutions. In addition, we show that the tension required in a stiff <b>piano</b> string with <b>hinged</b> ends can be adjusted by changing the mass and stiffness functions of a stiff string, retaining its natural frequencies...|$|R
