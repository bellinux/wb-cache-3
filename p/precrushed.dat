40|$|Purpose. To {{examine the}} {{relationship}} between the distance of axotomy and axonal regeneration of injured retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) systematically and the effect of a predegenerated (pre-transected or <b>precrushed)</b> peripheral nerve (PN) graft on axonal regeneration of RGCs axotomized at a definite distance (0. 5 mm from the optic disc) in comparison with a normal PN graft. Methods. The optic nerve (ON) was transected intraorbitally at 0. 5, 1, 1. 5, 2, or 3 mm or intracranially at 6 to 8 mm from the optic disc, and a PN graft was transplanted onto the ocular ON stump in adult hamsters. Four weeks after grafting, the number of RGCs regenerating their injured axons into the PN graft was investigated in all animals. Results. The number of regenerating RGCs decreased significantly when the distance of axotomy increased from 0. 5 to 7 mm. A <b>precrushed</b> PN graft was shown to enhance more injured RGCs to regenerate axons than a normal or pretransected PN graft. Conclusions. The distance of axotomy on the ON of adult hamsters is critical in determining the number of regenerating RGCs. Thus, experimental strategies to repair the damaged ON by PN transplantation is to attach a <b>precrushed</b> PN graft as close to the optic disc as possible to obtain optimal axonal regeneration of the axotomized RGCs. link_to_OA_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|The {{presence}} of pesticides in the aquatic environment represents {{a potential threat}} to water quality and human health. Increasingly stringent drinking water quality directives focus {{on the need for}} efficient pesticide removal processes. Granular activated carbon (GAC) has proved the most effective and reliable barrier to sporadic, seasonal variations of pesticides, although it has now been established that natural organic matter (NOM) hinders adsorption through preloading and competitive adsorption. The effect of preloading GAC with NOM and the competitive interaction of NOM with the herbicides atrazine and MCPA were studied. Preloading and competitive interaction were considered as two separate mechanisms and were investigated through Freundlich adsorption isotherms, partition coefficients and site energy distribution theory. Adsorption tests with herbicides were carried out with preloaded and non-preloaded carbon in combination with NOM from lake water, treated water from two treatment plants, groundwater, ultrapure water and synthetic organic compounds including polystyrene sulphonate (PSS) standards. The results demonstrate that competitive interaction overrides the effect from preloading, even at low NOM concentrations. These findings can be explained by site energy distribution theory, where the activated carbon has a heterogeneous surface with a distribution of adsorption site energies. Characterisation of NOM through a pilot-scale GAC column as specific UV absorbance showed the preferential removal of UV-absorbing NOM compared to total organic carbon characterised NOM. The competitively absorbing component is probably the small, hydrophobic aromatic fraction of NOM. Analysis of the molecular weight (MW) distribution in the waters used in the study through high-performance size-exclusion chromatography demonstrated that a low MW refractory NOM fraction accounts for competitive interaction during GAC adsorption and that this fraction is not affected by conventional water treatment. These findings were confirmed by adsorption studies of atrazine in the {{presence of}} PSS standards. There appeared to be no evidence of pore blockage by larger molecules during atrazine adsorption to GAC. Prediction of GAC performance in a treatment plant for herbicide removal requires a consideration of both NOM preloading and NOM competitive interaction. The candidate GAC's should be <b>precrushed</b> and site-preloaded and adsorption isotherms for target compounds carried out {{in the presence of the}} relevant NOM. Further improvement in the design of GAC filters to allow the preferential adsorption of pesticides or the reduction of NOM interference seems an unproductive approach, because the competing fraction is always in excess of target compounds, even in groundwater. Further research might focus on nanofiltration-GAC which seems well poised to solve the competitive effects presented in this thesis...|$|E
50|$|Whirlwind mills {{essentially}} {{consist of}} a mill base, a mill cover and a rotor. The inner side of the cover is equipped with wear protection elements. The top of the rotor is equipped with <b>precrushing</b> tools, and its side is covered with numerous U-shaped grinding tools.|$|R
50|$|The {{grinding}} stock is fed to the mill via an inlet box and is pre-crushed by the tools {{on top of}} the rotor. The <b>precrushing</b> tools also carry the product into the milling zone {{at the side of the}} rotor. There the {{grinding stock}} is fluidised in the air stream between rotor and stator caused by rotation and the U-shaped grinding tools. The special design of these tools creates massive air whirls in the grinding zone (this is where the name of the mill comes from). These air whirls cause the main grinding effect. The particles collide with each other in these whirlwinds. The final particle size can be adjusted by changing the clearance between rotor and stator, air flow and rotor speed.|$|R
