5|$|Seeing all the singers, {{you really}} {{come face to}} face with a lot of <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{predominantly}} younger. That's inspiring, because they come up to you and they're such big fans and they share with you what song touched them the most and how they had to learn every single ad lib and dissect it. As a vocalist it brought me back to, 'Yeah, that's what I used to do to my Whitney Houston record and my Mariah Carey record and my Etta James record.' It brings you back to a place where it becomes your personal responsibility to infuse the next generation with more information about learning every intricate note. That's why a song called 'Sing for Me' is a special song. It's one of those singer's songs where if you're not a vocalist you can't mess with that song.|$|E
5|$|Armstrong concluded: The {{responsibility}} for this flight lies first with history and with the giants of science who have preceded this effort; next with the American people, who have, through their will, indicated their desire; next with four administrations and their Congresses, for implementing that will; and then, with the agency and industry teams that built our spacecraft, the Saturn, the Columbia, the Eagle, and the little EMU, the spacesuit and backpack that was our small spacecraft out on the lunar surface. We {{would like to give}} special thanks to all those Americans who built the spacecraft; who did the construction, design, the tests, and put their hearts and all their abilities into those craft. To those people tonight, we give a special thank you, and to all the other <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> listening and watching tonight, God bless you. Good night from Apollo 11.|$|E

25|$|Young {{children}} {{are particularly vulnerable}} to ingesting feces of other <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> lying around after open defecation, because young children crawl on the ground, walk barefoot, and put things in their mouths without washing their hands.

25|$|Because of {{turnover}} {{in the population}} of <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> homeless, {{the total number of}} people who experience homelessness for at least a few nights {{during the course of a}} year is thought to be considerably higher than point-in-time counts. A 2000 study estimated the number of such people to be between 2.3million and 3.5million. According to Amnesty International USA, vacant houses outnumber homeless people by five times.|$|E
25|$|Homelessness {{emerged as}} a {{national}} issue in the 1870s. Many homeless people lived in emerging urban cities, such as New York City. Into the 20th Century, the Great Depression of the 1930s caused a devastating epidemic of poverty, hunger, and homelessness. There were two million homeless people migrating across the United States. In the 1970s, the de-institutionalization of patients from state psychiatric hospitals was a precipitating factor which seeded the population of <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> homeless.|$|E

According to an international survey, conducted in 2016, 53 percent of the young Hungarians aged between 18 and 35 years would vote for Jobbik.|$|E

25|$|We {{really hit}} it off and we would go fishing every day. I was in awe of all these great songs he’d written, and he would play them on the {{acoustic}} guitar really hard, Johnny Ramone style, all six strings. He had this bitter resentment that drenched every step he took and every word that he spoke. His songs were just filled with that envy of <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> better looking, that are more successful. It was just really inspiring to be around someone that just hated everything that much. It was just great.|$|E
25|$|The PA {{profession}} has expanded globally.

25|$|Like most {{old world}} tarantulas, the female orange baboon spider digs a burrow, or uses a burrow {{that has been}} abandoned. It lays silk threads on the {{entrance}} to feel vibrations from other animals. Also, it has lots of hairs on it that detect motion in the air. The orange baboon spider has no urticating hairs, and is very defensive. It also {{is not a good}} choice for <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> new to the Tarantula keeping hobby, and has a painful and venomous bite.|$|E

25|$|The Austrian federal {{states of}} Carinthia and Styria {{are home to}} a {{significant}} indigenous Slovene-speaking minority while in the easternmost state, Burgenland (formerly part of the Hungarian portion of Austria–Hungary), there are significant Hungarian- and Croatian-speaking minorities. Of the remaining number of Austria's <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> of non-Austrian descent, many come from surrounding countries, especially from the former East Bloc nations. Guest workers (Gastarbeiter) and their descendants, as well as refugees from the Yugoslav wars and other conflicts, also form an important minority group in Austria. Since 1994 the Roma–Sinti (gypsies) have been an officially recognised ethnic minority in Austria.|$|E
25|$|The Community Mental Health Act of 1963 was a pre-disposing {{factor in}} {{setting the stage for}} {{homelessness}} in the United States. Long term psychiatric patients were released from state hospitals into Single Room Occupancies and sent to community health centers for treatment and follow-up. It never quite worked out properly and this population largely was found living in the streets soon thereafter with no sustainable support system. In the United States, during the late 1970s, the deinstitutionalization of patients from state psychiatric hospitals was a precipitating factor which seeded population <b>people</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> homeless, especially in urban areas such as New York City.|$|E
25|$|Complications with measles are {{relatively}} common, ranging from mild complications such as diarrhea to serious complications such as pneumonia (either direct viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia), bronchitis (either direct viral bronchitis or secondary bacterial bronchitis), otitis media, acute brain inflammation (and very rarely SSPE—subacute sclerosing panencephalitis), and corneal ulceration (leading to corneal scarring). Complications are usually more severe in adults who catch the virus. The death {{rate in the}} 1920s was around 30% for measles pneumonia. <b>People</b> <b>that</b> <b>are</b> {{at high risk for}} complications are: Infants and children aged <5 years, adults aged >20 years, pregnant women, and people with compromised immune systems, such as from leukemia and HIV infection.|$|E
