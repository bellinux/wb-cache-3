40|$|This {{document}} {{is a report}} on the research of a potentially superior method of color image transformation for producing rapid and accurate printed color output from a digitized color image. The primary objective is to reduce the complexities, inaccuracies, objectionable artifacts, and processing time common to current methods of color modeling. A new method of vector-corrected mathematical modeling combined with improved color space interpolation is studied. This achievement allows for rapid automatic closed-loop color-match calibration between image capture and output devices. Currently, digital image creation or manipulation systems rely on image <b>proof</b> <b>printing</b> which is slow and often of poor color fidelity or proprietary. The ideal system would provide optimum color reproduction fidelity and rapid <b>proof</b> <b>printing</b> at a low cost. Existing systems often rely on mathematical models for image con version for printing. These models are usually a bottleneck in the proofing process and are not accurate enough for many applica tions. Increasing their accuracy rapidly increases processing time to the point of impracticality well before graphic arts quality levels are achieved. A common solution to this problem in larger systems is a massive and tediously generated color look-up table based on actual measured print samples. This method is costly and does not readily accommodate printing process changes such as paper grade or ink color. Attempts {{to reduce the size of}} these look-up tables and the large quantity of required sample measurements have been disappointing. In this thesis, new methods will be reported which should allow practical small-system color <b>proof</b> <b>printing</b> with excellent color fidelity and rapid processing. By eliminating common problems associated with color space interpolation, these new methods make closed-loop control practical with a relatively small quantity of sample measurements which can be automatically printed, scanned, and incorporated into conversion processes...|$|E

Assessment of quality of the printing paper should include not only the analysis of its physical-mechanical properties and the optical, but also a complex of printing properties, in order to increase the stability of printing and producing a paper with an improved printing properties. The article concerns not only the analysis and enhancement of the properties of the final product, but also the prediction of its properties. For this purpose test conducted by changing the composition of paper and its effect on the printability complex defined by multicolor <b>proof</b> <b>printing</b> technology based on analysis of image of complex test scale. The result is a multi-factorial system with the specified parameters of the composition and quality characteristics of the printed image.

As a result of pilot tests the paper with improved printing properties is got out. ? ????????? ????? ??????? ???????? ??????? ?????? ???????? ?????????. ? ?? ?? ????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????????? ?????? ????????????? ? ???????????. ?????? ???????? ?????? ??? ?????? ?????? ???????? ?? ?????? ?????? ?? ??????-???????????? ? ?????????? ???????, ?? ? ???????? ???????? ??????? ? ????? ????????? ???????????? ?????? ? ???????????? ?????? ? ??????????? ????????? ??????????. ? ?????? ?????????? ?????? ?? ?????? ??????? ? ????????? ??????? ????????? ????????, ?? ? ??????????????? ??? ???????. ??? ????? ????????? ????????? ?? ????????? ??????????????? ??????? ?????? ? ??? ??????? ?? ???????? ???????? ???????, ???????????? ?? ?????????? ??????????????? ?????????????? ?? ?????? ??????? ??????????? ??????????? ???????? ?????. ? ?????????? ???????? ?????????????? ??????? ? ????????? ??????????? ?????????? ? ??????????? ??????? ??????????? ???????? ????????? ???????????. ??? ???????? ??????????? ??????? ?????? ?????????? ????????, ??????? ???????? ???????? ??????????? ?????????? ? ?????? ???????? ?? ???????????? ? ??????????????? ????????? ???????? ??????? ? ?????????. ? ?????????? ?????????? ??????-???????????? ????????? ???????? ?????? ? ??????????? ????????? ??????????...|$|E
40|$|Background: In 2013, {{an unusually}} high {{incidence}} of biliary tract cancer among current or former workers of the offset color <b>proof</b> <b>printing</b> department of a printing company in Osaka, Japan, was reported. The {{purpose of this study}} was to examine whether distance from the printing factory was associated with incidence of biliary tract cancer and whether incident biliary tract cancer cases clustered around the printing factory in Osaka using population-based cancer registry data. Methods: We estimated the age-standardized incidence ratio of biliary tract cancer according to distance from this printing factory. We also searched for clusters of biliary tract cancer incidence using spatial scan statistics. Results: We did not observe statistically significantly high or low standardized incidence ratios for residents in each area categorized by distance from the printing factory for the entire sample or for either sex. The scan statistics did not show any statistically significant clustering of biliary tract cancer incidence anywhere in Osaka prefecture in 2004 – 2007. Conclusions: There was no statistically significant clustering of biliary tract cancer incidence around the printing factory or in any other areas in Osaka, Japan, between 2004 and 2007. To date, even if some substances have diffused outside this source factory, they do not appear to have influenced the incidence of biliary tract cancer in neighboring residents...|$|E
40|$|During early 1990 ’s the inkjet IRIS {{printing}} technique {{was one of}} the first digital {{printing technique}}s used by artists for fine art printing. The technique was initially developed in the mid 1980 ’s, to do pre <b>proof</b> <b>printing.</b> It soon became clear that, though the technique had many aesthetic qualities, it also had poor qualities when it came to stability. It lacked light fastness and was very sensitive to high relative humidity levels (RH) and changes in RH. Research and testing of digital printing techniques have always been done, but for the most part, only to develop new, qualitative and cost effective techniques for the industry. Poor lightning policies can have immense impact on all art prone to fading. The IRIS prints have shown to fade more than other digital printing techniques and since the printers are no longer in common use, all IRIS prints can be viewed as originals. Many IRIS prints are also printed on different fine art paper and with different ink-sets i. e. all IRIS prints are different. This thesis will conduct MFT (micro fading testing) of IRIS prints and inkjet model materials. Some results pointed to the fading of a newly produced print to a higher extent than when solvents had evaporated several days later. The results of the conducted tests show that all IRIS prints will fade but to a different extent, due to different qualities of the prints. This study can be used to shed some light on what an IRIS print actually requires when it comes to preventive conservation.

40|$|Colour {{management}} {{technology has}} reached {{a high level of}} maturity. Only ten years after it first appeared on the market, ICC colour profiles have become indispensable in modern premedia. It can be said without exaggeration that colour management has revolutionised digital <b>proof</b> <b>printing.</b> A whole range of newcomers in the print industry supplier community offer an intelligent combination of a PostScript RIP with integral colour management functions. The quality of these low-priced proofing systems has now reached such a high level that even discerning customers accept such digital proofs as contract proofs. Modular proofing solutions are regularly to be found among the leaders in the digital proofer tests. Working with colour profiles and profiled workflows is still a major problem area. It is no mere chance that notably digital proofing is the field in which users work with colour profiles in virtually all systems, since applications here are locally limited. An important step for the widespread use of colour management technology is the now very extensive implementation of ICC mechanisms in application programs such as Adobe Photoshop. Version 7 is regarded as a model of well thought-out ICC-based colour management implementation. As Microsoft has neglected the ICC standard in recent years, Adobe has created its own colour management interface, called ACE. Based on the ICC standard, it is regarded by many experts as a reference implementation. Adobe products, which are so important for the graphic arts industry, now contain a standard colour management platform across all supported operating systems. Incompatibilities at system level can now be virtually ruled out, at least across the Adobe product line, including the important interfaces with PostScript and PDF. Modern prepress technology is set to move ever further away from exclusive print production for standardised offset print. Multiple use of production data is still at an early stage. Numerous large and small production jobs are being run at customer request from media- or process-neutral data files. Colour management is a key technology, and its importance is set to increase further. </p...|$|E
40|$|Optical Brightening Agents (OBAs) are {{chemicals}} {{added to}} paper pulp whose {{purpose is to}} brighten the white point of the paper. Adding OBAs results in a brighter white, increased tonal range, and more chromatic colors. However, adding OBAs can also create problems in visual print-to-proof match where proofing substrates do not contain OBAs. Visual print-to-proof match is the final judge of conformance in a print business. When printing and proofing in conformance to standards and specifications on non-OBA papers, there is visual match between the print and the <b>proof.</b> <b>Printing</b> on OBA loaded papers causes two main problems: (1) difficulty in achieving conformance to printing standards and (2) visual print-to-proof mismatch. To solve the above problems, this research begins by adopting the new 2 ̆ 2 M 12 ̆ 2 measurement condition and the revised ISO 3664 : 2009 viewing conditions. It then assumes that the print on OBA loaded paper is the anchor and the proof must be color managed to match the print using these new measurement and viewing conditions. In order to test the proposed solution, the researcher prepared a series of prints and proofs that (1) reproduced the proof-to-print match traditionally achieved on non-OBA loaded printing papers (the anchor pair), (2) reproduced the proof-to-print mismatch on OBA loaded printing papers (the problem pair), ix and (3) tested the color managed approach to solving the problem described above (the solution pair). Finally, these pairs were evaluated {{by a panel of}} observers in a paired comparison experiment under the revised ISO 3664 : 2009 viewing conditions. The results of the paired comparison experiment first demonstrated that the researcher could reproduced both a proof-to-print match on non-OBA loaded papers and a proof-to-print mismatch on OBA loaded papers. In addition, the solution pair was demonstrated to be preferred to all other pairs at the. 05 level of significance. Finally CIELAB plots of the problem pair and the solution pair under M 1 conditions supported the results of the pair comparison experiment. Under M 1 conditions the proof-to-print mismatch (difference in CIELAB values) for the problem pair was shown to be approximately twice as large as the proof-to-print mismatch for the solution pair. Based on the results of this research, the proposed solution was shown to be a promising approach for solving the industry wide problem of print-to-proof mismatch when printers print on OBA loaded papers...|$|E
