60|$|Nor {{were the}} conversations of these gentlemen {{the only sounds}} that broke upon the ear. Standing on a box behind a wooden bar at another {{end of the room}} was a clerk in {{spectacles}} who was 'taking the affidavits'; large batches of which were, from time to time, carried into the private room by another clerk for the judge's signature. There were a large number of attorneys' clerks to be sworn, and it being a moral impossibility to swear them all at once, the struggles of these gentlemen to reach the clerk in spectacles, were like those of a crowd to get in at the <b>pit</b> <b>door</b> of a theatre when Gracious Majesty honours it with its presence. Another functionary, from time to time, exercised his lungs in calling over the names of those who had been sworn, for the purpose of restoring to them their affidavits after they had been signed by the judge, which gave rise to a few more scuffles; and all these things going on at the same time, occasioned as much bustle as the most active and excitable person could desire to behold. There were yet another class of persons--those who were waiting to attend summonses their employers had taken out, which it was optional to the attorney on the opposite side to attend or not--and whose business it was, from time to time, to cry out the opposite attorney's name; to make certain that he was not in attendance without their knowledge.|$|E

50|$|The lineup {{was very}} well {{received}} by the people as it brought many quality, big name artists such as Pearl Jam, Keane, Franz Ferdinand, Queens of the Stone Age, The Black Keys, The Hives, Kaiser Chiefs, deadmau5, Passion <b>Pit,</b> Two <b>Door</b> Cinema Club, Of Monsters and Men, A Perfect Circle, Hot Chip and Foals, and many others.|$|R
60|$|There was a {{long string}} of people waiting at the door, and Liza was delighted to see a couple of niggers who were helping them to while away the time of waiting. The niggers sang and danced, and made faces, while the people looked on with appreciative gravity, like royalty {{listening}} to de Reské, and they were very generous of applause and halfpence {{at the end of the}} performance. Then, when the niggers moved to the <b>pit</b> <b>doors,</b> paper boys came along offering Tit-Bits and 'extra specials'; after that three little girls came round and sang sentimental songs and collected more halfpence. At last a movement ran through the serpent-like string of people, sounds were heard behind the door, everyone closed up, the men told the women to keep close and hold tight; there was a great unbarring and unbolting, the doors were thrown open, and, like a bursting river, the people surged in.|$|R
50|$|The {{shock wave}} from firing {{just one of}} these huge mortars, {{particularly}} if it was fired within one of the smaller, old-style pits, was often so strong that it destroyed sensitive equipment mounted near the <b>pit,</b> knocked <b>doors</b> off nearby magazines and barracks, and broke windows in nearby neighborhoods. The thundering crash of four of these mortars being fired simultaneously in a pit must have been overwhelming.|$|R
6000|$|It was {{not until}} I was nearly {{seventeen}} that the idea {{occurred to me to}} visit a Music Hall again. Then, having regard to my double capacity of [...] "Man About Town" [...] and journalist (for I had written a letter to The Era, complaining of the way <b>pit</b> <b>doors</b> were made to open, and it had been inserted), I felt I had no longer any right to neglect acquaintanceship with so important a feature {{in the life of the}} people. Accordingly, one Saturday night, I wended my way to the [...] "Pav."; and there the first person that I ran against was my uncle. He laid a heavy hand upon my shoulder, and asked me, in severe tones, what I was doing there. I felt this to be an awkward question, for it would have been useless trying to make him understand my real motives (one's own relations are never sympathetic), and I was somewhat nonplussed for an answer, until the reflection occurred to me: What was he doing there? This riddle I, in my turn, propounded to him, with the result that we entered into treaty, by the terms of which it was agreed that no future reference should be made to the meeting by either of us--especially not in the presence of my aunt--and the compact was ratified according to the usual custom, my uncle paying the necessary expenses.|$|R
60|$|One man, {{as he sat}} on his door-step smoking {{his pipe}} after dinner, amused himself by poking the handle of an axe into the ground, and, unexpectedly, turned up a small nugget of gold worth several dollars. In ten minutes there was a <b>pit</b> before his <b>door</b> {{big enough to hold}} a sheep, and, before night, he {{realised}} about fifty dollars. Another, in the course of two days, dug out one hundred dollars behind his tent, and all were more or less fortunate.|$|R
60|$|The taxicab {{was making}} a slight detour as Whitehall and the Mall were closed for road repairs. The chauffeur was driving round by St. Martin's Lane. At one of the theatres there, a popular play was filling the house night after night with {{enthusiastic}} crowds. It was only half past six now, and in a long queue extending over two hundred yards away from the <b>pit</b> and gallery <b>doors</b> of the lucky playhouse, patient crowds waited for the evening's pleasure.|$|R
500|$|Keeps were {{traditionally}} {{built with}} an entrance at first-floor level, and Rochester's follows this pattern. A forebuilding {{attached to the}} north side guarded the entrance. A stone staircase began {{on the west side}} of the keep before turning and meeting the forebuilding, which could be entered by crossing a drawbridge across a gap [...] wide. There was another entrance in the west of the forebuilding, and at some point a new doorway was knocked through to the keep at the bottom of the drawbridge <b>pit.</b> The original <b>door</b> from the forebuilding into the keep was protected by a portcullis.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes Jones would {{propose a}} half-price visit to Drury Lane or Covent Garden, {{to see two}} acts of a five-act play, and a new farce, perhaps, or a ballet, on which {{occasions}} the whole four of them went together: none of your hurrying and nonsense, but having their brandy-and-water first, comfortably, and ordering a steak and some oysters for their supper against they came back, and then walking coolly into the pit, when the ‘rush’ had gone in, as all sensible people do, and did when Mr. Dounce was a young man, except when the celebrated Master Betty was {{at the height of}} his popularity, and then, sir,—then—Mr. Dounce perfectly well remembered getting a holiday from business; and going to the <b>pit</b> <b>doors</b> at eleven o’clock in the forenoon, and waiting there, till six in the afternoon, with some sandwiches in a pocket-handkerchief and some wine in a phial; and fainting after all, with the heat and fatigue, before the play began; in which situation he was lifted out of the pit, into one of the dress boxes, sir, by five of the finest women of that day, sir, who compassionated his situation and administered restoratives, and sent a black servant, six foot high, in blue and silver livery, next morning with their compliments, and to know how he found himself, sir—by G-! Between the acts Mr. Dounce and Mr. Harris, and Mr. Jennings, used to stand up, and look round the house, and Jones—knowing fellow that Jones—knew everybody—pointed out the fashionable and celebrated Lady So-and-So in the boxes, at the mention of whose name Mr. Dounce, after brushing up his hair, and adjusting his neckerchief, would inspect the aforesaid Lady So-and-So through an immense glass, and remark, either, that she was a ‘fine woman—very fine woman, indeed,’ or that ‘there might be a little more of her, eh, Jones?’ Just as the case might happen to be. When the dancing began, John Dounce and the other old boys were particularly anxious to see what was going forward on the stage, and Jones—wicked dog that Jones—whispered little critical remarks into the ears of John Dounce, which John Dounce retailed to Mr. Harris and Mr. Harris to Mr. Jennings; and then they all four laughed, until the tears ran down out of their eyes.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "basic obscenity" [...] for {{the female}} {{genitalia}} is cunnus, [...] "cunt", though perhaps not as strongly offensive as the English. Martial uses the word more than thirty times, Catullus once, and Horace thrice only in his early work; it also appears in the Priapea and graffiti. One of the slang words women used for their genitals was porcus, [...] "pig", particularly when mature women spoke of girls. Varro connects this usage of the word to the sacrifice of a pig to the goddess Ceres in preliminary wedding rites. Metaphors of fields, gardens, and meadows are common, as {{is the image of}} the masculine [...] "plough" [...] in the feminine [...] "furrow". Other metaphors include cave, ditch, <b>pit,</b> bag, vessel, <b>door,</b> hearth, oven, and altar.|$|R
60|$|While Mr Brass, {{with his}} eye curiously twisted into the keyhole, uttered these sounds {{as a means}} of {{attracting}} the lodger's attention, and while Miss Brass plied the hand-bell, Mr Swiveller put his stool close against the wall {{by the side of the}} door, and mounting on the top and standing bolt upright, so that if the lodger did make a rush, he would most probably pass him in its onward fury, began a violent battery with the ruler upon the upper panels of the door. Captivated with his own ingenuity, and confident in the strength of his position, which he had taken up after the method of those hardy individuals who open the <b>pit</b> and gallery <b>doors</b> of theatres on crowded nights, Mr Swiveller rained down such a shower of blows, that the noise of the bell was drowned; and the small servant, who lingered on the stairs below, ready to fly at a moment's notice, was obliged to hold her ears lest she should be rendered deaf for life.|$|R
5000|$|Citizens has {{received}} all favorably positive reviews from five critics. At CCM Magazine, Matt Conner told that [...] "the new movement of worship music out of Mars Hill {{is one of}} the most imaginative and important shifts within the Christian music industry in years, and Citizens is the latest example alongside The Modern Post and Ghost Ship. Citizens echoes Passion <b>Pit</b> or Two <b>Door</b> Cinema Club comparisons with their club rock groove, and gospel-centric lyrics on each tune bolster their theological importance." [...] Tyler Hess of Christian Music Zine found that Citizens are [...] "appearing to be putting forth an attempt to buck that trend" [...] of what the standard worship album is to be. In addition, Hess alluded us to [...] "ponder what a worship song would sound like with an indie rocker up in front", and add to that [...] "a return to energy and excitement, not just when there are 50,000 people at a festival, but even contained in a studio production" [...] because that is what the album contains. Hess was critical in noting that this [...] "isn't like this is the best album ever created", which means [...] "this album isn't perfect", yet the album [...] "it is simply a step in the right direction, with a huge sound that gives the rest of us a little something to look forward to in the years to come." ...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to review {{international}} literature on the incidence of suicide on railway networks, describe risk factors associated with it, and examine existing prevention practices. Searches on Medline and PsycINFO for the period 1966 - 2007 were performed. Thirty original studies published in English on epidemiology of rail suicide were included in the review along with peer-reviewed articles on risk factors and prevention of rail suicide. Internationally, suicide by collision with a train accounted for 1 - 12 % of all suicides, with up to 94 % of all attempts resulting in death. Suicide by train seriously affects not only survivors, but also train drivers and bystanders. Correlations between density of rail network, number of passengers and number of suicides by train have been found. Conflicting data exist on gender ratio of this type of suicide, but studies are homogenous in identifying young adults (20 - 40 year of age) as those most exposed to train suicide. Documented psychiatric diagnoses were found in up to 83 % of cases. Mid-seasonal peaks were also identified, with events occurring mostly during late morning and early afternoon. Limited evidence exists for effective suicide prevention practices. Successful examples are represented by <b>pits</b> and sliding <b>door</b> systems (Singapore Mass Rapid Transit System) and responsible media reporting (Viennese Subway). Suicide by train involves emotional and financial costs to individuals and society as a whole. A combination of different strategies might significantly reduce its effect.
