5|$|Regional geology accords that Dublin's {{hard water}} is well-suited to making stout, such as Guinness, while the Plzeň Region's soft water {{is ideal for}} brewing <b>Pilsner</b> (pale lager), such as <b>Pilsner</b> Urquell. The waters of Burton in England contain gypsum, which {{benefits}} making pale ale {{to such a degree}} that brewers of pale ales will add gypsum to the local water in a process known as Burtonisation.|$|E
5|$|In {{terms of}} sales volume, most of today's beer {{is based on}} the pale lager brewed in 1842 in the town of Pilsen in the present-day Czech Republic. The modern pale lager is light in colour with a {{noticeable}} carbonation (fizzy bubbles) and a typical alcohol by volume content of around 5%. The <b>Pilsner</b> Urquell, Bitburger, and Heineken brands of beer are typical examples of pale lager, as are the American brands Budweiser, Coors, and Miller.|$|E

50|$|Beer {{is widely}} {{popular in the}} South, though its {{consumption}} is frowned upon in some religious circles. Lagers and <b>Pilsners</b> are generally preferred to heavier/darker beers due to the predominantly humid, warm climate. The most popular beers in the south are those produced by Anheuser Busch, particularly Budweiser and Busch. Cartersville, Georgia, north of Atlanta, has a massive production facility for Anheuser Busch. Regional brands such as Dixie and Jax beers of New Orleans or Pearl beer of San Antonio, Texas, had a strong regional following.|$|R
50|$|The {{drinking}} {{culture in}} the North {{is more or less}} {{similar to that of the}} rest of the country, heavily based on beer with Pale lagers and <b>pilsners</b> being favourites. Unlike Bavaria, Austria and Central Germany, dark beers or dark lagers are not at all popular in Northern Germany. The North has a slightly stronger tradition of hard liquor, such as Korn, vodka, and schnapps. Binge drinking is far more common in the North - almost 70% of binge drinking hospitalizations on weekends happen in the eight Northern provinces and states containing just 40% of the population. As in all of Germany, mulled wine is a popular alcoholic drink during the Christmas season.|$|R
2500|$|Rather than {{building}} a second brewery and potentially putting {{the company at}} risk, Pearl decided to purchase an existing brewery to increase production and the distribution network. [...] Overall, buying out another brewery meant a larger initial investment, but the new brewery {{would be able to}} put out Pearl beer almost immediately and therefore help recoup costs more quickly. [...] From a short list of potentials, the M. K. Goetz Brewing Company in St. Joseph, Missouri, seemed the perfect fit for Pearl’s plans. [...] Goetz’s historic brewery would allow increased production levels and the ability to use the well-established distribution network to help Pearl reach untapped markets. [...] In addition, Pearl gained access to the Goetz line of beers, from <b>pilsners</b> to malt liquors.|$|R

50|$|Both {{industrial}} and small-scale brewing have long traditions in Norway. In addition, {{the volume of}} craft brewed beers from an expanding number of micro breweries, {{in the recent years}} have increased significantly. Despite restrictive alcohol policies there is a rich community of brewers, and a colourful variety of beverages both legal and illegal. The most popular industrial beers are usually <b>pilsners</b> and red beers (bayer), while traditional beer is much richer, with a high alcohol and malt content. The ancient practice of brewing Juleøl (Christmas beer) persists even today, and imitations of these are available before Christmas, in shops and, for the more potent versions, at state monopoly outlets. Cider brewing has faced tough barriers to commercial production due to alcohol regulations, and the famous honey wine, mjød (mead), is mostly a drink for connoisseurs, Norse and medieval historical reenactors, and practitioners of åsatru and other Norse neopagan religions. The climate has not been hospitable to grapes for millennia, and wines and more potent drinks are available only from the wine monopolies.|$|R
40|$|The carbon isotope ratios (delta(13) C) of 160 beers {{from around}} the world ranged from - 27. 3 to - 14. 9 %., {{primarily}} due to variation in the percentage of C- 3 or C- 4 plant carbon in the final product. Thirty-one percent of beers had a carbon signature of C- 3 plants (barley, rice, etc.), whereas the remaining 69 % contained some C- 3 -C- 4 mixture (mean of mixtures, 39 +/- 11 % C- 4 carbon). Use Of C- 4 carbon (corn, cane sugar, etc.) was not confined to beers from any particular region (Pacific Rim, Mexico, Brazil, Europe, Canada, and the United States). However, the delta(13) C of European beers indicated Mostly C- 3 plant carbon. In contrast, U. S. and Canadian beers contained either only C- 3 or C- 3 -C- 4 mixtures; Brazilian, Mexican, and Pacific Rim beers were Mostly C- 3 -C- 4 mixtures. Among different lagers, U. S. -style lagers generally contained more C- 4 carbon than did imported <b>pilsners.</b> Among different ales, those brewed by large high-production breweries contained significant proportions Of C- 4 carbon, while C- 4 carbon was not detected in microbrewery or home-brew ales. Furthermore, inexpensive beers generally contained more C- 4 carbon than expensive beers...|$|R

25|$|On 17 February, Scherffenberg {{was arrested}} in Vienna. On 18 February, a second patent was {{released}} accusing Wallenstein of conspiracy and condemning him to death, its publication was delayed {{so as not to}} split the army in two. Wallenstein's letters refuting the accusations against him remained unanswered, after realizing that the emperor was positioning troops in such a manner as to surround him he decided to flee to the Swedes, departing from his headquarters on 22 February. On 24 February, Wallenstein reached Eger where he was assassinated by a group of Scottish and Irish officers who were previously hired by Piccolomini. Schaffgotsch was arrested on the same day, later being transferred to the fortress of Glatz where he was held for eight weeks. On 1 March, the commander of the Troppau garrison (an officer under Schaffgotsch's command) declared his allegiance to Wallenstein, unaware of what had previously happened. An investigation into the incident proved that Schaffgotsch was not implicated the uprising. In the second half of April, he was sent to Vienna upon his request, where he continued to be interrogated. In July, he was again taken to Pilsen, on 20 June he was relocated to Budweis due to the risk posed by Johan Banér's invasion of Bohemia. On 18 February 1635, a military tribunal responsible for Schaffgotsch's case convened in Regensburg, with the proceedings opening in the middle of March. On 31 March 1635, Schaffgotsch was convicted of conspiracy to overthrow the emperor and sentenced to death. Schaffgotsch pleaded not guilty citing the fact that Wallenstein was not officially relieved of his command and as such he was obliged to follow his orders. On 4 July, presiding judge Heinrich von Schlick ordered the use of torture which failed to produce a confession of guilt. A day later, the emperor confirmed the death sentence which was implemented on the morning of 24 July 1635. Schaffgotsch's execution was part of larger purge that included the execution of the Troppau garrison commander and the demotion and the temporary imprisonment of seven generals including , all of the convicted were signatories of the <b>Pilsner</b> Reverse. Schaffgotsch's estates at Trachenberg-Prausnitz and the Riesengebirge were confiscated in April 1634. On 31 August 1641, the former were granted to Melchior von Hatzfeldt while the latter were gradually returned to Hans Ulrich's sons following their conversion to Catholicism.|$|E
