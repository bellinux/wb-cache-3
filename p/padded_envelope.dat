She later develops amnesia and gets married to Clifford (the Bishop of Manchesterford officiating) before discovering that she is not only the twin sister of Derek, but also the daughter of Mrs Overall, and the mother of an unnamed baby. In the musical version, Berta is revealed to be Babs's sister: both siblings are the daughters of Mrs Overall.|$|E
5000|$|In 2005, KSAS {{became a}} crucial {{location}} {{in the search for}} and apprehension of infamous Wichita serial killer Dennis Rader, known for decades as the anonymous BTK Killer. Rader's last known communication with the media and police was a <b>padded</b> <b>envelope</b> which arrived at KSAS' West Street studios (one of many stations in the Wichita market which Rader had contacted over the years) on February 16 of that year. Enclosed in the package was a purple, 1.44-MB Memorex floppy disk; a letter; a photocopy of the cover of a 1989 novel about a serial killer (Rules of Prey); and a gold-colored necklace with a large medallion. Police found metadata embedded in a Microsoft Word document on the disk that pointed to Wichita's Christ Lutheran Church and the document was marked as last modified by [...] "Dennis". A search of the church website turned up Dennis Rader as president of the congregation council.|$|E

Accepted items included shirts, undershirts with short sleeves, mufflers, balaclava caps, handkerchiefs, writing <b>pads,</b> <b>envelopes,</b> pencils, pipes, tobacco, cigarettes, bootlaces, toothbrushes, toothpaste, soap, Vaseline, sweets, coffee, games, books and magazines.|$|R
40|$|Surveys are an {{important}} tool for assessing physician and nursing profes-sionals ’ practice patterns and guideline adherence. Obtaining quality survey data consisting of low item and unit nonresponse remains a persistent chal-lenge in these populations. We tested the relative impact of two envelope types (padded vs. priority mail) on unit and item nonresponse {{in a survey of}} Minnesota health care workers. Respondents were randomized to receive a survey in one of two envelope types: a padded 8. 500 1100 envelope or a similarly sized priority mail envelope. After the first mailing, the response rate was 53. 9 % and did not differ across envelope conditions. Females and RNs were more likely to respond to the priority envelope than the <b>padded</b> <b>envelope,</b> but this finding did not hold in multivariate analysis. There was no difference in item nonresponse across the two envelope conditions. It may be that our two approaches were not enough to permeate the semi-porou...|$|E
2500|$|In February, {{four months}} after the attack against politicians, five more letter bombs were sent to {{different}} addresses in London, England, claimed again by the ARM. In an action apparently to protest the annual seal hunt in Newfoundland, Canada, the explosives were delivered to the Canadian High Commission, the then Agriculture minister, a surgeon and a furrier. This time, however, as the <b>padded</b> <b>envelopes</b> were defused, there were no injuries.|$|R

50|$|President Arnold Maremont {{declared}} in January 1957 {{that it was}} possible the company could double its size within a year and intimated that other paper companies could be acquired. By 1958 the corporation was specializing in three areas of production: book papers, business papers and school supply papers. The Allied book paper lines then included grades from the thinnest bible paper to heavy book paper for novels. Business papers include forms, mimeo, duplication and offset for reproduction machines, bond, carbon insets and special coated papers for electrostatic office copiers. School supply papers include notebook filler, construction and drawing paper, <b>pads,</b> <b>envelopes</b> and reproduction and typing papers. Also in early 1957 Allied announced they would build a large new pulp mill {{on the north side of}} Cork St in Kalamazoo but this addition never occurred. Bryant Mills A and B continued to be used to de-ink waste paper for use as stock in the Kalamazoo paper mills. This use of recycled paper would cause huge problems for the corporation in future years. Included in the recycled paper was carbonless copy paper manufactured by the National Cash Register (NCR) Company and this paper contained toxic polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs).|$|R
50|$|There {{are many}} styles of cloth menstrual pads {{available}} today, ranging from pantyliners to overnight pads. Popular styles of cloth menstrual pads include all-in-one, or AIO pads, {{in which the}} absorbent layer is sewn inside the pad, 'inserts on top' style pads, which have absorbent layers that can be secured {{on top of the}} <b>pad</b> as needed, <b>envelope</b> or pocket style pads, which have absorbent layers that can be inserted inside the pad as needed, and a foldable style, in which the pad folds around the absorbent layers. Cloth menstrual pads can have waterproof lining, which provides more leak protection but may also be less breathable.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, an {{algorithm}} for secure {{transmission of}} message is proposed based on Lagrange's interpolation. The message {{is viewed as}} a polynomial of degree n where n is kept secret and transmitted to the receiver's side using the concept of a digital envelope. As any nth degree polynomial is uniquely determined by n+ 1 points, n + 1 points are communicated to the other side, where the polynomial and hence the message is reconstructed. Padding of length m is added to the message to overcome the message length issue. Although any coding scheme may be used, in this paper Huffman coding is used for converting the plaintext into binary form. Finally, the proposed algorithm is compared with the performance of RSA algorithm and found to be efficient.
