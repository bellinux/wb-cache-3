5|$|Macedonia {{during the}} reign of Philip II was at first preoccupied by wars with marauding Illyrians and Thracians.

In a series of campaigns stretching from 356 to 340 BC, Philip II managed to ultimately subjugate Kersebleptes as a tributary vassal, conquering much of Thrace in the process and founding new cities there such as Philippi (modern Filippoi, Greece) and Philippopolis (modern Plovdiv, Bulgaria). Philip II also fought against the Illyrian king Bardylis, who threatened Macedonia <b>proper,</b> <b>and</b> against Grabos and Pleuratus in Illyria (centred in modern-day Albania).|$|E

50|$|A {{distinction}} is normally made in current linguistics between <b>proper</b> nouns <b>and</b> <b>proper</b> names. By this strict distinction, because the term noun {{is used for}} a class of single words (tree, beauty), only single-word proper names are <b>proper</b> nouns: Peter <b>and</b> Africa are both <b>proper</b> names <b>and</b> <b>proper</b> nouns; but Peter the Great and South Africa, while they are proper names, are not proper nouns. The term common name is not much used to contrast with proper name, but some linguists have used the term for that purpose. Sometimes proper names are called simply names; but that term is often used more broadly. Words derived from proper names are sometimes called proper adjectives (or <b>proper</b> adverbs, <b>and</b> so on), but not in mainstream linguistic theory. Not every noun or noun phrase that refers to a unique entity is a <b>proper</b> name. Blackness <b>and</b> chastity are common nouns, even if blackness and chastity are considered unique abstract entities.|$|R
