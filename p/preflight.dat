5|$|Ford {{responded to}} the December 7, 1941, attack on Pearl Harbor by enlisting in the navy. He {{received}} a commission as ensign in the U.S. Naval Reserve on April 13, 1942. On April 20, he reported for active duty to the V-5 instructor school at Annapolis, Maryland. After one month of training, he went to Navy <b>Preflight</b> School in Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where {{he was one of}} 83 instructors and taught elementary navigation skills, ordnance, gunnery, first aid, and military drill. In addition, he coached in all nine sports that were offered, but mostly in swimming, boxing and football. During the year he was at the <b>Preflight</b> School, he was promoted to Lieutenant, Junior Grade, on June 2, 1942, and to lieutenant, in March 1943.|$|E
5|$|NASA astronauts train {{underwater}} {{to simulate}} the weightlessness and occasionally need to fly afterwards at cabin altitudes not exceeding 10,000 feet (3,000 meters). Training dives use 46% Nitrox and can exceed six hours at a maximum depth of 40ffw (12mfw) for a maximum equivalent air depth (EAD) of 24fsw (7 msw). NASA guidelines for EADs of 20–50fsw (6–15msw) with maximum dive durations of 100–400 minutes allow either air or oxygen to be breathed in the <b>preflight</b> surface intervals. Oxygen breathing during surface intervals reduces the time to fly {{by a factor of}} seven to nine times compared with air. A study by another military organization, the Special Operations Command also indicated that <b>preflight</b> oxygen might be an effective means for reducing DCS risk.|$|E
5|$|Five {{of these}} had been {{completed}} {{by the spring of}} 1956 and were undergoing <b>preflight</b> tests when the entire program was canceled on 13 April 1956 and all components in preparation scrapped. A week later, the Attack Aviation branch of the VVS was superseded by the Fighter-Bomber branch and the doctrine of the VVS was drastically modified. No longer would the VVS provide close support to the Army, but rather it would use tactical nuclear weapons as part of the nuclear battlefield.|$|E

5|$|Suggestions {{have been}} made that wings may have evolved {{initially}} for sailing {{on the surface of}} water as seen in some stoneflies. An alternative idea is that it drives from directed aerial gliding descent—a <b>preflight</b> phenomena found in some apterygote, a wingless sister taxa to the winged insects. The earliest fliers were similar to dragonflies with two sets of wings, direct flight muscles, and no ability to fold their wings over their abdomens. Most insects today, which evolved from those first fliers, have simplified to either one pair of wings or two pairs functioning as a single pair and using a system of indirect flight muscles.|$|E
5|$|The {{official}} mission countdown {{began on}} Monday, April 10, 1972, at 8:30 AM, six {{days before the}} launch. At this point the Saturn V rocket's three stages were powered up and drinking water was pumped into the spacecraft. As the countdown began, the crew of Apollo 16 was participating in final training exercises {{in anticipation of a}} launch on April 16. The astronauts underwent their final <b>preflight</b> physical examination on April 11. On April 15, liquid hydrogen and liquid oxygen propellants were pumped into the spacecraft, while the astronauts rested in anticipation of their launch the next day.|$|E

50|$|John C. Meyer {{had risen}} to be Deputy Commander of the 352d by December and was now a {{lieutenant}} colonel. He suspected that the Germans might use New Year's Day {{as an opportunity to}} attack and decided to have Y-29 in readiness when the sun rose. While haggling with higher authorities at Ninth Air Force throughout the night, he ordered a squadron assigned to do a morning sweep and ordered the pilots not to engage in any alcoholic celebration the night prior. Although he did not get permission until 0800, he joined the 487th Fighter Squadron in the frigid cold of the snowy weather at 0530 <b>preflighting</b> their Mustangs and was sitting in the cockpit of the lead aircraft. As the Mustangs were awaiting take-off for the morning patrol, their airfield was overrun with Luftwaffe fighters from Jagdgeschwader 11 (JG.11).|$|R
50|$|During the 1980s and 1990s, {{computer-aided}} prepress techniques {{began to}} supplant the traditional dark room and light table processes, {{and by the}} early 2000s the word prepress became, in some ways, synonymous with digital pre-press. Immediately before the mainstream introduction of computers to the process, much of the industry was using large format cameras to make emulsion-based (film) copies of text and images. This film was then assembled (stripping) and used to expose another layer of emulsion on a plate, thus copying images from one emulsion to another. This method is still used; however, as digital pre-press technology has become less cost intensive, more efficient and reliable, and as the knowledge and skill required {{to use the new}} hardware and especially software have become more widespread within the labor force, digital automation has been introduced to almost every part of the process. Some topics related to digital but not analog prepress include <b>preflighting</b> (verifying the presence, quality and format of each digital component), color management, and RIPping.|$|R

50|$|By 30 November {{the ground}} echelon {{had arrived at}} Kimpo Air Base (K-14), South Korea, {{preparing}} {{for the arrival of}} the air echelon which had been unloaded in Japan. Once unloaded from the transport carriers, the aircraft were barged to Kisarazu Air Base where they were <b>preflighted</b> for a short flight to Yokota Air Base. However the aircraft were damaged during their trans-Pacific open-air deck shipment and had salt air induced corrosion; corroded electrical equipment and landing gear damage. Some of the aircraft also had flat tires. On 1 December Far East Air Forces decided they would station their short-ranged 4th FIG at Kimpo (K-14) and the 27th was ordered split into forward and rear echelons. Advanced headquarters would be at Taegu Air Base (K-2), South Korea; while the rear echelon would locate at Itazuke Air Base, Japan. The advanced echelon would be attached to the F-80 Shooting Star equipped 49th Fighter-Bomber Wing at Tageu for logistical support, while the rear portion would be attached to the provisional 6160th Air Base Wing at Itazuke for the same kind of support.|$|R
40|$|This {{article was}} {{accepted}} for publication in Journal of Sports Sciences [Taylor and Francis] and the definitive version is available at: [URL] study reports the techniques used by gymnasts to perform the Hecht vault and compares them with techniques used for the handspring somersault vault (Takei and Kim, 1990). Data were obtained on 27 elite gymnasts performing the Hecht vault at the 1993 Canadian National Championships using two-dimensional video analysis with the Direct Linear Transformation (DLT) technique. The maximum height reached by the mass centre during postflight was significantly correlated (p < 0. 001) with the vertical velocity of the mass centre and the body angle at horse contact. The backwards rotation of the body was significantly correlated (p = 0. 002) with the shoulder angle at horse contact. The competition score was significantly correlated (p = 0. 031) with the body angle at horse contact and the maximum height of the mass centre during postflight. For the Hecht vault the gymnasts had longer, lower and faster <b>preflights</b> with slower rotation at horse contact compared with the handspring somersault vaults...|$|R
5000|$|In January 1949, Eighth Air Force {{planned a}} large celebration at Carswell AFB. All of its {{assigned}} units were {{to participate in}} a coordinated flyover. Most of SAC's bombers were to participate, along with SAC's only [...] "Long Range" [...] fighter group, the 27th. The weather in Nebraska in January that year was especially horrible, with most airports in the Midwest weathered in the day of the display. At Kearney AFB, the base was socked-in with a blizzard. Nevertheless, the crews had an early morning mission briefing, the aircraft in the hangars were <b>preflighted</b> and prepared for the flyover mission. Paths were cut though the snow for the aircraft to taxi and somehow the F-82s got airborne, with the 27th's Twin Mustangs joining up with SAC bombers over Oklahoma on schedule. The flyover by the Twin Mustangs was a tremendous success, with SAC leadership being amazed that the F-82 was truly an [...] "all weather" [...] aircraft and the 27th being able to carry out their mission despite the weather.|$|R

25|$|As {{part of the}} {{acquisition}} program the Portuguese Air Force received equipment and its technicians were instructed {{in the first two}} echelons of maintenance. The first echelon performed by the squadron mechanics was responsible for service of the aircraft and their equipment, <b>preflight</b> and daily inspections, light repairs, anti-corrosive treatments, parts replacement, and refueling, while the second echelon was carried out at dedicated facilities at Monte Real Air Base (BA5) and was responsible for the periodic preventive inspections and the periodic servicing for the systems, engines and other aircraft equipment.|$|E
25|$|At 5:00 pm EST, 15-year-old Charlie J. Bishop's {{instructor}} {{left him}} at the plane to perform a <b>preflight</b> inspection.

As soon as the plane took off, the air traffic controllers alerted the United States Coast Guard and the MacDill Air Force Base. Despite repeated warnings from a helicopter dispatched by the Coast Guard, the small plane continued on until it collided with an office building. The plane crashed between the 28th and 29th floors of the 42-story building.|$|E
40|$|It is more {{important}} than ever for printers to improve efficiency and productivity, and the means for doing so are available. Computer-assisted scheduling is one method that is claimed to increase throughput speed and reduce costs, among other benefits. Recently, scheduling applications have started to increase in popularity, and many management information systems (MISs) have built-in scheduling features. However, only 15 % of the companies that own scheduling software utilize it. The first part of this research project seeks to determine the reasons for the low usage. Another way to increase efficiency is through Lean manufacturing, a strategy for eliminating non-value-added activities, such as defects, excess inventory, and overproduction. Lean manufacturing and computer-assisted scheduling share many of the same objectives. The second part of the research project seeks {{to determine whether or not}} there is a difference in production performance between users and nonusers of scheduling software from a lean manufacturing perspective. The analysis is based on data collected through an email questionnaire from 60 commercial printing companies in the U. S. It was found that the surveyed companies who own scheduling software but do not use it, do not rely on the application’s capability because they believe that they can achieve better control with manual scheduling. Furthermore, they believe scheduling software is difficult to integrate with their workflow. Companies who have owned an MIS for 5 years or fewer have a more negative perception about scheduling software compared with those who have owned one for a longer time. In the research, it was also found that companies using scheduling software have higher utilization rates of equipment, shorter lead times for paper storage, and a higher percentage of short makereadies out of the total number of makreadies. Nonusers of scheduling software have shorter throughput time and shorter waiting time for a job between <b>preflighting</b> and platemaking, between platemaking and plate mounting, and between completed printing and the first postpress operation. In general, the scheduling software users in the study are more homogeneous as a group in performance, whereas the nonusers are more diverse in performance, with a relatively high percentage performing at a very low or very high level. The implication of the study is that scheduling software needs to be more userfriendly and easier to customize to increase the flexibility and capability of integrating it into a workflow. Furthermore, companies that own scheduling software, but do not use it, should investigate the possibility of achieving better performance by beginning to use the scheduling application. Scheduling software that is already in house has the capability of enhancing a lean manufacturing effort...|$|R

One year later, it became an independent organization—the San Antonio Aviation Cadet Center. On 8 January 1943, the War Department constituted and activated the 78th Flying Training Wing (<b>Preflight)</b> at San Antonio and assigned it to the AAF Central Flying Training Command. The 78th Wing provided aviation cadets the mechanics and physics of flight and required the cadets to pass courses in mathematics and the hard sciences. Then the cadets were taught to apply their knowledge practically by teaching them aeronautics, deflection shooting, and thinking in three dimensions.

25|$|The {{mission was}} jeopardised by a {{concurrent}} software bug in the lander, {{which had been}} found in <b>preflight</b> testing but was deemed a glitch and therefore given a low priority as it only occurred in certain unanticipated heavy-load conditions, and the focus was on verifying the entry and landing code. The problem, which was reproduced and corrected from Earth using a laboratory duplicate thanks to the logging and debugging functionality enabled in the flight software, was due to computer resets caused by priority inversion. No scientific or engineering data was lost after a computer reset, but all the following operations were interrupted until the next day. Four resets occurred (on July 5, 10, 11 and 14) during the mission, before patching the software on July 21 to enable priority inheritance.|$|E
