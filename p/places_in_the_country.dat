25|$|Due to the Japanese {{invasion}} {{establishing the}} unofficial Second Philippine Republic, {{the economic growth}} receded and food shortages occurred.

Manila was one of the many <b>places</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> that suffered from severe shortages, due mainly to a typhoon that struck the country in November 1943. The people were forced to cultivate private plots which produced root crops like kangkong. The Japanese, in order to raise rice production in the country, brought a quick-maturing horai rice, which was first used in Taiwan. Horai rice was expected to make the Philippines self-sufficient in rice by 1943, but rains during 1942 prevented this.|$|E

25|$|Ireland {{has many}} {{geological}} attractions, most being along the coastline of the country. The two most famous geologically important destinations {{are both in}} Co. Clare; the Cliffs of Moher and The Burren. The Cliffs of Moher {{are one of the}} most visited sites in the country, with the rocks at the bottom of the cliffs dated as being about 320 million years old, formed when Ireland was under water during the Carboniferous Period. The Burren was also created during this period. When a tropical sea flooded the south of the country, a buildup of coral (Limestone) began, covering many places in Ireland. When the sea shallowed, rocks such as Sandstone and Shale were deposited over the Limestone, effectively covering it over again. The Burren is one of the largest karst landscapes in Europe and is one of the few <b>places</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>country</b> where the limestone is visible above ground.|$|E
