50|$|Stothert and Pitt {{supplied}} their earliest electric {{powered crane}} to Southampton Dock Authority in 1892. Electric power provided several advantages: powerful motors {{could be placed}} in each crane and powered centrally, without requiring a separate prime mover (i.e. steam engine and boiler) in each crane. The crane mechanisms were also lighter, allowing them {{to be placed on}} raised carriages that could then straddle a railway freight line- the <b>portal</b> <b>crane.</b> Rather than requiring a bare strip of unused quayside between the railway line and the harbour wall to leave space for cranes, the railway could now be brought right to the dock edge. Cranes were also available immediately, without waiting for boilers to raise steam. Most importantly though (and an advantage over centrally powered hydraulic cranes), electric cranes were now mobile along the dock edge on their own rail lines. Rather than ships queueing for a single berth space alongside a fixed crane, cranes could be brought to each ship's hold hatches as needed. This made a single crane far more efficient, in terms of cargo handled per day. Soon such mobile electric cranes were near universal.|$|E

5000|$|They {{are also}} called <b>portal</b> <b>cranes,</b> the [...] "portal" [...] being {{the empty space}} straddled by the gantry. The terms gantry crane and {{overhead}} crane (or bridge crane) are often used interchangeably, as both types of crane straddle their workload. The usual distinction drawn {{between the two is}} that with gantry cranes, the entire structure (including gantry) is usually wheeled (often on rails). By contrast, the supporting structure of an overhead crane is fixed in location, often {{in the form of the}} walls or ceiling of a building, to which is attached a movable hoist running overhead along a rail or beam (which may itself move). Further confusing the issue is that gantry cranes may also incorporate a movable beam-mounted hoist in addition to the entire structure being wheeled, and some overhead cranes are suspended from a freestanding gantry.|$|R
30|$|Consistent {{with the}} {{objectives}} of transport policy, {{there are a variety}} of technology providers who offer solutions for the horizontal transshipment of non-liftable semi-trailers (e.g., CargoBeamer®, Modalohr, Mega Swing by Kockums Industrier). In recent years, accelerated marketing efforts from several technology providers who strongly advocate for horizontal transshipment technologies for non-liftable semi-trailers in the transport market have been observed. On contrast to vertical transshipment, which is performed by <b>portal</b> <b>cranes,</b> horizontal transshipment technologies operate with rotating or sliding wagon elements. Thus, the semi-trailers need not to be equipped with the special grappler pockets that containers require. The figures above illustrate the market potential that “theoretically” could be shifted from road to rail if the access barrier to the CCFT system is overcome as a result of these new technologies. Therefore, horizontal transshipment technologies maybe perceived as a powerful enabler for the modal shift from road to rail.|$|R
