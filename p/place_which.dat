5|$|A Jo Tessem {{equaliser}} for Southampton {{earned the}} visitors a point against Arsenal on 2 February 2002; in hindsight this {{proved to be}} the last time they dropped points in the league season. Wiltord scored the winning goal against Everton and Arsenal moved back to second <b>place,</b> <b>which</b> was obtained by Liverpool, following a 4–1 win at home to Fulham.|$|E
5|$|As his hunger became intolerable, Periyar {{was forced}} to feed on {{leftovers}} from the streets. Around this time, he realised that the eatery which had refused him entry was built by a wealthy non-Brahmin from South India. This discriminatory attitude dealt a blow to Periyar's regard for Hinduism, for the events he had witnessed at Kasi were completely different from the picture of Kasi he had in mind, as a holy <b>place</b> <b>which</b> welcomed all. Ramasami was a theist until his visit to Kasi, after which his views changed and he became an atheist.|$|E
5|$|During Artavasdes' imprisonment, a {{civil war}} between the Parthians later took <b>place,</b> <b>which</b> gave him the {{opportunity}} to escape prison. He took refuge with Augustus, who received him with friendliness, gave him back his daughter Iotapa and made him a Client King of Lesser Armenia. He died around 20 BC probably in Rome.

5|$|During {{offensive}} {{operations at}} Saint-Mihiel, though artillery bombing was in force, Banker {{and her team}} of operators manned the switchboards.

5|$|During the First Schleswig War Aarhus was {{occupied}} by German troops from 21 June to 24 July 1849. The city was spared any fighting, but in Vejlby {{north of the city}} a cavalry skirmish known as Rytterfægtningen took <b>place</b> <b>which</b> stopped the German advance through Jutland. The war and occupation left a notable impact on the city as many streets, particularly in Frederiksbjerg, are named after Danish officers of the time. Fifteen years later, in 1864, the city {{was occupied}} again, this time for seven months, during the Second Schleswig War.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the winter}} break, Nasri's goal-scoring {{began to take}} form. In late January, he scored goals in {{back-to-back}} matches against Nancy and Caen. In European competition, Nasri participated in the UEFA Champions League {{for the first time}} in his career, however he failed to make an impact in the four group stage matches he appeared in. He missed the club's upset victory over Liverpool at Anfield due to dealing with a bout of meningitis. Marseille ultimately finished the group in third <b>place,</b> <b>which</b> resulted in the team qualifying for the round of 32 of the UEFA Cup. The club was defeated in the round of 16 by Zenit Saint Petersburg despite being up 3–1 heading into the second leg. Of those three goals Marseille scored in the first leg, Nasri assisted on two of them. On 16 March 2008, Nasri scored a goal in a 3–3 draw with Lens. A month later, he scored the game-winning goal in a 2–1 victory over Metz. In his final match with Marseille, against Strasbourg, Nasri scored a goal and assisted on another in a 4–3 victory. Marseille finished the league campaign in third <b>place,</b> <b>which</b> resulted in the club qualifying for the UEFA Champions League for the second consecutive season. On 8 May 2008, with all the transfer speculation surrounding the player, Nasri surprised many by signing a three-year contract extension with the club until 2012.|$|E

In 729 a battle between supporters of Óengus and Nechtan's enemies was fought at Monith Carno (traditionally Cairn o' Mount, near Fettercairn) where the supporters of Óengus were victorious.

5|$|In 1819, Sir Walter Scott's novel Ivanhoe {{featured}} a scene involving a tournament at Ashby de la Zouch Castle; the novel was immensely popular {{and made the}} location famous. Edward Mammatt, Francis Rawdon's agent, repaired the castle ruins and opened them to visitors, whom Rawdon hoped to attract to the Ivanhoe Baths which he opened nearby. Ashby <b>Place,</b> <b>which</b> had become used as a House of Industry, was pulled down in 1830 and a new house, Ashby Manor, was built in its place. Work continued throughout the 19th century to repair the castle ruins, although they remained mostly covered in ivy.|$|E
