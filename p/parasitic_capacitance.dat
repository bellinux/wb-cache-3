40|$|Abstract- In this paper, {{we report}} {{the impact of}} the <b>parasitic</b> <b>capacitances</b> in the {{modeling}} and analysis of advanced floating gate (FG) non-volatile memory (NVM) devices, especially on the coupling ratio. Due to the poor accuracy of the existing capacitance model when compared to practice, an approach to include the <b>parasitic</b> <b>capacitances</b> has been established. Measurement results from two transistor (2 T) Fowler-Nordheim (FN) tunneling operated flash memory show a good improvement in the model accuracy. The <b>parasitic</b> <b>capacitances</b> depend very much on the floating gate dimension, and the spacing to the neighboring elements in the flash cell array. The growing influence of the <b>parasitic</b> <b>capacitances</b> and the subsequent degradation of the existing model accuracy can be expected for the cells dimensions in future process technologies. With the accurate calculation method for the <b>parasitic</b> <b>capacitances</b> proposed in this paper, the cell characteristics can be more accurately modeled, and the degradation of the cell can be accurately studied.

25|$|The antenna is an {{integral}} part of the tuned circuit and its reactance contributes to determining the circuit's resonant frequency. Antennas usually act as a capacitance, as antennas shorter than a quarter-wavelength have capacitive reactance. Many early crystal sets did not have a tuning capacitor, and relied instead on the capacitance inherent in the wire antenna (in addition to significant <b>parasitic</b> <b>capacitance</b> in the coil) to form the tuned circuit with the coil.|$|E
25|$|In the {{simplest}} output-limiting circuits, the RO {{is placed in}} the top (series connection) or lower (shunt) arm of the voltage divider. The series connection provides a greater controlling range (−80dB) at DC and low frequencies. The operation is complicated by the nonlinearity of the resistance vs. the controlling current. The narrowing of the dynamic range due to the <b>parasitic</b> <b>capacitance</b> is significant at frequencies as low as hundreds of Hz. The reaction is significantly faster to the increase than decrease in the controlling current.|$|E
25|$|The {{maximum energy}} is a {{function}} of dielectric volume, permittivity, and dielectric strength. Changing the plate area and the separation between the plates while maintaining the same volume causes no change of the maximum amount of energy that the capacitor can store, so long as the distance between plates remains much smaller than both the length and width of the plates. In addition, these equations assume that the electric field is entirely concentrated in the dielectric between the plates. In reality there are fringing fields outside the dielectric, for example between the sides of the capacitor plates, which increase the effective capacitance of the capacitor. This is sometimes called <b>parasitic</b> <b>capacitance.</b> For some simple capacitor geometries this additional capacitance term can be calculated analytically. It becomes negligibly small when the ratios of plate width to separation and length to separation are large.|$|E

25|$|The {{specialized}} transformer {{used in the}} Tesla coil circuit, {{called a}} resonant transformer, oscillation transformer or radio-frequency (RF) transformer, functions differently from an ordinary transformer used in AC power circuits. While an ordinary transformer is designed to transfer energy efficiently from primary to secondary winding, the resonant transformer is also designed to temporarily store electrical energy. Each winding has a capacitance across it and functions as an LC circuit (resonant circuit, tuned circuit), storing oscillating electrical energy, analogously to a tuning fork. The primary coil (L1) consisting of a relatively few turns of heavy copper wire or tubing, is connected to a capacitor (C1) through the spark gap (SG). The secondary coil (L2) consists of many turns (hundreds to thousands) of fine wire on a hollow cylindrical form inside the primary. The secondary is not connected to an actual capacitor, but it also functions as an LC circuit, the inductance of (L2) resonates with stray capacitance (C2), {{the sum of the}} stray <b>parasitic</b> <b>capacitance</b> between the windings of the coil, and the capacitance of the toroidal metal electrode attached to the high voltage terminal. The primary and secondary circuits are tuned so they resonate at the same frequency, they have the same resonant frequency. This allows them to exchange energy, so the oscillating current alternates {{back and forth between the}} primary and secondary coils.|$|E
2500|$|When triodes {{were first}} used in radio {{transmitters}} and receivers, {{it was found}} that tuned amplification stages had a tendency to oscillate unless their gain was very limited.

He summarised these design rules in a maxim: [...] "Do not attempt to match discrete components in integrated circuits design". Armed with this strategy and Hung-Chang Lin's theory of compensated devices, he designed the industry's first true linear integrated circuit, and the first monolithic operational amplifier, the μA702.|$|E

In addition to the primary (L1) and secondary (L2) coils, it had a third coil (L3) which he called the [...] "extra" [...] coil, not magnetically coupled to the others, attached to the top terminal of the secondary. When driven by the secondary it produced additional high voltage by resonance, being adjusted to resonate with its own <b>parasitic</b> <b>capacitance</b> (C2) The use of a series-fed resonator coil to generate high voltages was independently discovered by Paul Marie Oudin in 1893 and employed in his Oudin coil.|$|E
2500|$|RO is {{the first}} and the slowest opto-isolator: its {{switching}} time exceeds 1 ms, and for the lamp-based models can reach hundreds of milliseconds. <b>Parasitic</b> <b>capacitance</b> limits the frequency range of the photoresistor by ultrasonic frequencies. Cadmium-based photoresistors exhibit a [...] "memory effect": their resistance depends on the illumination history; it also drifts during the illumination and stabilizes within hours, or even weeks for high-sensitivity models. Heating induces irreversible degradation of ROs, whereas cooling to below −25°C dramatically increases the response time. Therefore, ROs were mostly replaced in the 1970s by the faster and more stable photodiodes and photoresistors. ROs are still used in some sound equipment, guitar amplifiers and analog synthesizers owing to their good electrical isolation, low signal distortion and ease of circuit design.|$|E
2500|$|The {{oscillating}} {{magnetic field}} of the primary winding induces an oscillating current in the secondary winding (L2), by Faraday's law of induction. Over a number of cycles, the energy in the primary circuit is transferred to the secondary. The total energy in the tuned circuits {{is limited to the}} energy originally stored in the capacitor C1, so as the oscillating voltage in the secondary increases in amplitude ("ring up") the oscillations in the primary decrease to zero ("ring down"). Although the ends of the secondary coil are open, it also acts as a tuned circuit due to the capacitance (C2), the sum of the <b>parasitic</b> <b>capacitance</b> between the turns of the coil plus the capacitance of the toroid electrode E. Current flows rapidly back and forth through the secondary coil between its ends. Because of the small capacitance, the oscillating voltage across the secondary coil which appears on the output terminal is much larger than the primary voltage.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} {{systematic}} sizing methodology for switched-capacitor DC/DC converters aimed at maximizing the converter efficiency under the die area constraint. To do so, we propose first an analytical {{solution of the}} optimum switching frequency to maximize the converter efficiency. When the <b>parasitic</b> <b>capacitances</b> are low, this solution leads to an identical contribution of the switches and transfer capacitors to the converter output impedance. As the <b>parasitic</b> <b>capacitances</b> increase, the optimum switching frequency decreases. Secondly, optimum capacitor and switch sizes for maximum efficiency are provided.

40|$|Size {{and cost}} of a {{switched}} mode power supply can be reduced by increasing the switching frequency. This leads especially at a high input voltage to a decreasing efficiency caused by switching losses. Conventional calculations are not suitable to predict the efficiency as <b>parasitic</b> <b>capacitances</b> have a significant loss contribution. This paper presents an analytical efficiency model which considers <b>parasitic</b> <b>capacitances</b> separately and calculates the power loss contribution of each capacitance to any resistive element. The proposed model is utilized for efficiency optimization of converters with switching frequencies > 10 MHz and input voltages up to 40 V.
