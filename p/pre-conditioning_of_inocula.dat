40|$|Pre-conditioning by brief {{exposure}} to ischemia does not only protect the concerned organ against subsequent severe ischemic damage, {{but also has}} protective effect on other organs, which is called remote pre-conditioning. Our aim {{in this study was}} to evaluate the protective effect of brief liver ischemia on the pancreas against severe ischemia-reperfusion-induced pancreatitis. This study was performed on 30 male wistar rats. Ischemic <b>pre-conditioning</b> <b>of</b> liver was performed by first clamping of the hepatic pedicle for 10 minutes. Following this, ischemia-reperfusion of the pancreas was performed by first clam-ping the inferior splenic artery for 30 minutes, followed by reperfusion for one hour. The rats were divided into three groups (10 rats in each group). Group-One was the sham operated group, without clamping of any artery. Group-two developed ischemia-reperfusion-induced pancreatitis, without ischemic <b>pre-conditioning</b> <b>of</b> the liver, while Group-three underwent ischemic <b>pre-conditioning</b> <b>of</b> the liver followed by ischemia-reperfusion of the pancreas. Ischemic pre-conditioning, applied prior to induction of pancreatitis, caused a reduction in plasma lipase, plasma interleukin- 1 &# 946; and histological signs of pancreatic damage, but plasma interleukin- 10 levels were not significantly different between the three groups. Ischemic <b>pre-conditioning</b> <b>of</b> the liver did not cause any alteration of the liver enzymes. Our study suggests that ischemic <b>pre-conditioning</b> <b>of</b> the liver reduces the severity of ischemia-reperfusion-induced pancreatitis. These effects are partly related to the reduction of pro-inflammatory interleukin - 1 &# 946;...|$|R

40|$|Background: Xenotransplantation models {{allowing}} {{the identification and}} quantification of human Hematopoietic stem cells (HSC) in immunodeficient mice remain {{the only way to}} appropriately address human HSC function despite the recent progress in phenotypic characterization. However, these in vivo experiments are technically demanding, time consuming and expensive. Indeed, HSCs engraftment in mouse requires <b>pre-conditioning</b> <b>of</b> animals either by irradiation or cytotoxic drugs to allow homing of injected cells in specific stem cell niches and their subsequent expansion and differentiation in bone marrow. Recently, the development <b>of</b> busulfan <b>pre-conditioning</b> <b>of</b> animals improved the flexibility of experimentation in comparison with irradiation. Design and Methods: In order to further facilitate the organization of these complex experiments we investigated the effect of extending the period between mice pre-conditioning and cell injection on the engraftment efficiency. In the meantime, we also explored the role of busulfan doses, mouse gender and intravenous injection route (caudal or retro orbital) on engraftment efficiency. Results and Conclusion: We showed that a period of up to 7 days did not modify engraftment efficiency of human HSCs in NSG model. Moreover, retro orbital cell injection to female mice pre-conditioned with 2 x 25 mg/kg of busulfa...|$|R

40|$|We {{have shown}} that ex vivo <b>pre-conditioning</b> <b>of</b> bone marrow-derived {{dendritic}} cells (DC) with low molecular weight hyaluronan (LMW HA) induces antitumor immunity against colorectal carcinoma (CRC) in mice. In the present study we investigated the effects of LMW HA priming on human-tumor-pulsed monocytes-derived dendritic cells (DC/TL) obtained from healthy donors and patients with CRC. LMW HA treatment resulted in an improved maturation state of DC/TL and an enhanced mixed leucocyte reaction activity in vivo. Importantly, <b>pre-conditioning</b> <b>of</b> DC/TL with LMW HA increased their ability to migrate and reduced their attraction to human tumor derived supernatants. These effects were associated with increased CCR 7 expression levels in DC. Indeed, {{a significant increase in}} migratory response toward CCL 21 was observed in LMW HA primed tumor-pulsed monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DC/TL/LMW HA) when compared to LWM HA untreated cells (DC/TL). Moreover, LMW HA priming modulated other mechanisms implicated in DC migration toward lymph nodes such as the metalloproteinase activity. Furthermore, it also resulted in a significant reduction in DC migratory capacity toward tumor supernatant and IL 8 in vitro. Consistently, LMW HA dramatically enhanced in vivo DC recruitment to tumor-regional lymph nodes and reduced DC migration toward tumor tissue. This study shows that LMW HA [...] a poorly immunogenic molecule [...] represents a promising candidate to improve human DC maturation protocols in the context of DC-based vaccines development, due to its ability to enhance their immunogenic properties as well as their migratory capacity toward lymph nodes instead of tumors...|$|R
