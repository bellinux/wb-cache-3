And that's what I feel like Tricky and Dream did with this record. They took that 'Jenny from the Block' side of me, which is still very much a <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> I am and will always be, and they put it right there on that track".

Due to similarities which stem from their shared sexuality, Blaine [...] "sees a lot of himself in Kurt, in terms of experiences and the way they feel about the world around them. He feels the need to impart his knowledge, be a source of strength for him, and really help him through what he's going through." [...] Initially, Criss felt that the most important element of his character was to give Kurt [...] "someone he can relate to", and demonstrate that Kurt could have [...] "a young out male friend, a support system".|$|E

It's not something that you hear and you're like, 'That's not her,' but you also go, 'Is that her? I like that. It's new,' and that's what I wanted. I {{wanted it to be}} very me, but I wanted it to be me not from my first album or my second album, but for today." [...] Additionally, Lopez felt a strong connection to [...] "On the Floor" [...] because it captured both sides of her career, singing and dancing, [...] "The minute RedOne played it for me, I made him play it 20 times in a row, and I just sat there at the board and I kept listening to it and listening to it ... Because I really feel like, emotionally, I connected to it, but also because of how much I love to dance and how much that's always been such a big <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> I am since I started.

500|$|In 2003, Katherine and Jill were {{believed}} to be mother and daughter after Katherine's friend, Charlotte Ramsey, provided factual proof. Of the storyline, Walton stated: [...] "She's [...] going down a bad road. In looking back over the past 16 years, she's gone down a lot of bad roads, for a lot of different reasons. She'll survive this one and, hopefully, maybe this time she'll learn something from it." [...] She also described Jill as being in a [...] "soul-searching period" [...] during the storyline, saying: [...] "Now she's numbing herself with the alcohol because all those feelings of love are coming up for her mother, and she doesn't {{know how to deal with}} them." [...] Walton said she felt Jill had been [...] "shaken to the very foundation" [...] upon the revelation that Katherine is her mother, stating: [...] "A big <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> she has been all these years has to do with her anger towards Katherine. She always shoved any feeling of love down. Now, she's questioning everything about herself. That's why she is in such pain and why she is drinking. That hate thing is baseless now." [...] While admitting to having been surprised with the maternity revelation, Walton thought it was [...] "fabulous and rich, and it's opened up a whole new facet to the story". However, in 2009, the characters' history was rewritten by Maria Arena Bell; Charlotte had made up this information for revenge against Katherine, and they were not mother and daughter.|$|E
500|$|In September 2000, {{she joined}} the ABT Studio Company, which is ABT's second company, and {{became a member of}} its Corps de ballet in 2001. As part of the Studio Company, she {{performed}} the Pas de Deux in Tchaikovsky's The Sleeping Beauty. Eight months after joining the company, she was sidelined for nearly a year by a lumbar stress fracture. When Copeland joined the company, she weighed [...] (she is [...] tall). At age 19, her puberty had been delayed, a situation common in ballet dancers. After the lumbar fracture, her doctor told her that inducing puberty would help to strengthen her bones, and he prescribed birth control pills. Copeland recalls that in one month she gained 10 pounds, and her small breasts swelled to double D-cup size: [...] "Leotards had to be altered for me ... to cover my cleavage, for instance. I hated this sign that I was different from the others. ... I became so self-conscious that, {{for the first time in}} my life, I couldn’t dance strong. I was too busy trying to hide my breasts." [...] Management noticed and called her in to talk about her body. The professional pressure to conform to conventional ballet aesthetics resulted in body image struggles and a binge eating disorder. Copeland says that, over the next year, new friendships outside of ABT, including with Victoria Rowell and her boyfriend, Olu Evans, helped her to regain confidence in her body. She explained, [...] "My curves became an integral <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>who</b> I am as a dancer, not something I needed to lose to become one. I started dancing with confidence and joy, and soon the staff at ABT began giving me positive feedback again. And I think I changed everyone’s mind about what a perfect dancer is supposed to look like." [...] During her years in the corps, as the only Black woman in the company, Copeland also felt the burden of her ethnicity in many ways and contemplated a variety of career choices. Recognizing that Copeland's isolation and self-doubt were standing in the way of her talent, ABT's artistic director, Kevin McKenzie, asked writer and arts figure Susan Fales-Hill, then vice-chair of ABT's Board of Directors, to mentor Copeland. Fales-Hill introduced Copeland to Black women trailblazers who encouraged Copeland and helped her to gain perspective.|$|E
