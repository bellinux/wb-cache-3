40|$|Gas-filled hollow-core fiber (HCF) pulse post-compressors {{generating}} few- to single-cycle pulses {{are a key}} enabling {{tool for}} attosecond science and ultrafast spectroscopy. Achieving optimum performance in this regime can be extremely challenging due to the ultra-broad bandwidth of the pulses and the need of an adequate temporal diagnostic. These difficulties have hindered the full exploitation of HCF post-compressors, namely the generation of stable and high-quality near-Fourier-transform-limited pulses. Here we show that, independently of conditions such as the type of gas or the laser system used, there is a universal route to obtain the shortest stable output <b>pulse</b> <b>down</b> to the single-cycle regime. Numerical simulations and experimental measurements performed with the dispersion-scan technique reveal that, in quite general conditions, post-compressed pulses exhibit a residual third-order dispersion intrinsic to optimum nonlinear propagation within the fiber, in agreement with measurements independently performed in several laboratories around the world. The understanding of this effect and its adequate correction, e. g. using simple transparent optical media, enables achieving high-quality post-compressed pulses with only minor changes in existing setups.

Particle-in-cell simulations were seen to closely reproduce the experimental results, which were concluded to be predominantly dependent on the longitudinal properties of the laser and wakefield. The simulations also revealed a new wakefield instability that is driven by the far red-shifted component of the laser pulse.

40|$|To capture {{radioactive}} ion {{beams of}} tens of keV in an ion trap, {{the use of a}} pulsed drift cavity allows one to avoid placing the complete setup on a high voltage (HV) platform. By pulsing down the voltage on a long electrode while the ion bunch is inside it, the electric potential zero level can be shifted down over a range equal to the initial beam energy, thus allowing the ions to be captured in a trap at ground potential. The pulsed drift cavity of the WITCH setup, which is completely HV-platform free, is described here.

40|$|Time domain {{reflectometry}} (TDR) operates by propagating a radar frequency electromagnetic <b>pulse</b> <b>down</b> {{a transmission}} line while monitoring the reflected signal. As the electromagnetic pulse propagates along the transmission line, it {{is subject to}} impedance by the dielectric properties of the media along the transmission line (e. g., air, water, sediment), reflection at dielectric discontinuities (e. g., air-water or water-sediment interface), and attenuation by electrically conductive materials (e. g., salts, clays). Taken together, these characteristics {{provide a basis for}} integrated stream monitoring; specifically, concurrent measurement of stream stage, channel profile and aqueous conductivity. Here, we make novel application of TDR within the context of stream monitoring. Efforts toward this goal followed three critical phases. First, a means of extracting the desired stream parameters from measured TDR traces was required. Analysis was {{complicated by the fact that}} interface location and aqueous conductivity vary concurrently and multiple interfaces may be present at any time. For this reason a physically based multisection model employing the S 11 scatter function and Cole-Cole parameters for dielectric dispersion and loss was developed to analyze acquired TDR traces. Second, we explored the capability of this multisection modeling approach for interpreting TDR data acquired from complex environments, such as encountered in stream monitoring. A series of laboratory tank experiments were performed in which the depth of water, depth of sediment, and conductivity were varied systematically. Comparisons between modeled and independently measured data indicate that TDR measurements can be made with an accuracy of {+-} 3. 4 x 10 {sup - 3 } m for sensing the location of an air/water or water/sediment interface and {+-} 7. 4 % of actual for the aqueous conductivity.

Additionally, channel profile measurements were acquired at 7 locations across the river.

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} the experimental {{work on the}} applications of surface plasmon polariton (SPP) in terahertz (THz) spectral range. Apertureless near-field optical microscopy (ANSOM) has been widely used to study the localized SPP on various material surfaces. THz ANSOM technique was recently developed to combine the THz time-domain spectroscopy and the ANSOM technique to provide a near-field detection on the localized THz surface waves with improved spatial resolution and signal-noise ratio. We have studied the metal-insulator transition in vanadium dioxide (VO 2) thin film using THz ANSOM. We observe {{a variation of the}} terahertz amplitude due to the phase transition induced by an applied voltage across the sample. The change of the terahertz signal is related to the abrupt change of the conductivity of the VO 2 film at the metal-insulator transition. The subwavelength spatial resolution of this near-field microscopy makes it possible to detect signatures of metallic domains, which exist in the VO 2 thin films {{in the vicinity of the}} phase transition. We experimentally investigate the propagation of guided waves in finite-width parallel-plate waveguides (PPWGs) in the terahertz spectral range. We observe the propagation of SPPs in this guiding structure, instead of the fundamental transverse electromagnetic (TEM) mode. We find that the two-dimensional (2 -D) energy confinement within the finite-width PPWG increases exponentially as the plate separation is reduced. We speculate that edge plasmons play an important role in the energy confinement in this open-structure waveguide. For comparison, the infinite-width PPWGs, the plates of which are much wider than the THz beam size, are also studied with several plate separations. The free-space beam diffraction produces a Gaussian profile along the unconfined direction. The unusual electric field profiles along the vertical direction, perpendicular to the plate are observed. The field enhancement near the metal surfaces are also explained by the SPPs coupled to the metal surfaces. Based on the 2 -D energy confinement in the finite-width PPWGs, we design the tapered slot waveguide by slowly tapering the plate width and slot gap. We first study the transverse component of the THz electric field, where a subwavelength 2 -D energy confinement is observed. The output spot size strongly depends on the output facet size, where the slot gap and the tip width are in the same scale range. Subwavelength confinement is obtained, corresponding to lambda/ 4. Further confinement is limited by the spatial resolution of the detecting technique. To overcome this problem, we adapt the THz ASNOM setup to scattering-probe imaging technique, which has been proven to obtain deep subwavelength spatial resolution and great signal-noise ratio. Scattering-probe imaging setup measures the longitudinal component of the electric field of SPPs in the tapered slot waveguides. By slowly tapering the tip width and the slot gap, we squeeze a single-cycle THz <b>pulse</b> <b>down</b> to a size of 10 mum (lambda/ 260) by 18 mum (lambda/ 145), a mode area of only 2. 6 x 10 - 5 lambda 2.

This polarity flip is similar to that associated with the symmetric plasmon mode of slot waveguides...|$|E
