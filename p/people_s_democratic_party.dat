40|$|In the 1980 <b>s</b> the <b>Democratic</b> <b>party</b> {{went through}} a series of reforms that {{restricted}} autonomy of state parties and democratized delegate selection for presidential nomination conventions. Between 1985 and 1988 rural and urban factions of the <b>Democratic</b> <b>party</b> of Oklahoma struggled over the question of one person/one vote in representation in the State Central Committee (SCC). The matter was resolved only when the Democratic National Committee threatened to bar a delegation from Oklahoma at the 1988 national convention unless the SCC was apportioned in accordance with the national party's constitution. The SCC was reconstituted on more democratic lines, and the state party, operating under a new constitution, has enjoyed a more united leadership. The struggle to reapportion the <b>Democratic</b> <b>party</b> of Oklahoma looms as the most important episode in the organization's fifty year history. The <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party,</b> through reforms of the McGovern-Fraser Commission and its successors in the 1970 s, restricted the autonomy of state parties and ·democratized delegate selection processes for the presidential nomination conventions.

40|$|The {{past year}} has seen growing {{controversy}} over the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal which is currently being negotiated between 12 countries, the U. S. included. Concerns about economic dislocation stemming from similar trade deals often lead social democratic governments to increase spending on welfare programs to compensate citizens. Given {{the lack of a}} U. <b>S.</b> social <b>democratic</b> <b>party,</b> the response of state governments to global economic liberalization is often quite different. In new research, Brian Krueger and Ping Xu find that when exposed to higher levels of international trade, left-leaning state governments maintain their levels of welfare and infrastructure spending, while conservative administrations decrease it. They explain these differing reactions may be partly explained by the increasing levels of policy polarization in state governments...|$|R

40|$|A Kingdom Divided: New Media, the Fragmentation of Evangelical Cultural Values, and U. S. Politics Religious {{movements}} are {{a powerful force}} in politics, {{but there is no}} research that analyzes the relationship between new communication technologies and Christian political mobilization in the United States. In addressing this deficit, this thesis has three interrelated aims. First, beginning from an analysis of social capital, civic engagement and mobilization, it provides a historical overview of the V. S. evangelical community and its rise as a dominant cultural and political force. It argues that changing social norms provided the conditions for a strong reactionary religious movement to take root, while the social effects of broadcast media helped to concentrate evangelical energies on issues such as abortion, homosexuality, and school prayer. Second, this thesis develops an understanding {{of the impact of the}} Internet upon evangelical organizations based on original research and fieldwork. It demonstrates that in contrast to the effects of broadcast media, which served largely to unify evangelical cultural attitudes, the Internet is instead a source of significant theological fragmentation and political pluralization. By serving as a conduit through which dissident religious elements are better able to connect, organize, and mobilize, the Internet is revealed to be a powerful tool for movements such as "creation care" and the "emerging church," which in years past have been unable to gather significant cultural strength due to the limitations of prevailing communication infrastructures. Collectively, these movements have emerged as a source of considerable unrest and internal religious division. Finally, this thesis discusses the political and electoral implications of a fragmented evangelical community and the ways in which the V. <b>S.</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> may capitalize on these developments.

50|$|The 1872 Democratic National Convention met in Baltimore, Maryland, on July 9-10. Because of {{its strong}} desire to defeat Ulysses <b>S.</b> Grant, the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> also {{nominated}} the Liberal Republicans' Greeley/Brown ticket and adopted their platform. Greeley received 686 of the 732 delegate votes cast, while Brown received 713. Accepting the Liberal platform meant the Democrats had accepted the New Departure strategy, which rejected the anti-Reconstruction platform of 1868. They realized that {{to win the election}} they had to look forward, not try to re-fight the Civil War. Also, they realized they would only split the anti-Grant vote if they nominated a candidate other than Greeley. However, Greeley's long reputation as the most aggressive antagonist of the <b>Democratic</b> <b>party,</b> its principles, its leadership, and its activists cooled Democrats' enthusiasm for the nominee, and there was a sizable minority led by James A. Bayard that sought to act independently of the Liberal Republican ticket. The convention, which lasted only six hours stretched over two days, is the shortest major political party convention in history.|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{addresses}} the question: has {{the rise of}} postmodernism and the New Social Movements essentially undermined and “individuated” the traditionally collectivist American Left? The thesis seeks to address the shift of degree, if any, of the American Left’s character as a collective force of dissent regarding, primarily, U. S. foreign policy. The approach of this thesis has been to examine two indicative and comparative case studies, two left-leaning activist groups that emerged spontaneously in the 1980 s and 2000 s {{in one of the}} most conservative areas of the United States, with a view to determining the impact of postmodernism and the New Social Movements on the attitudes and behaviours of the group members. The approach taken, for the purposes of this thesis, has been to investigate through non-random interviews, based upon an open-ended questionnaire, these activist groups protesting U. S. Foreign Policy. The research findings posit that the American Left has become atomised in regards to the central question and the rise of postmodernism and the New Social Movements have undermined and ‘individuated’ the traditionally collectivist American Left. This has been evident for some time as the diffusion of the New Social Movements from the 1970 s onwards has seen the Left fragment into single issue groups. The American Left has become individuated and has migrated away from collectivism to what appears to be a postmodern sensibility, placing ever greater emphasis on self-development and individuality. The American Left has apparently retreated into forms of localism. For example: issues pertaining to municipalities, the academy and the arts. Also, the Left has had a visible presence through single-issue platforms such as: the environmental movement, the anti-nuclear movement, gay and lesbian rights and the feminist movement, to name but a few. Neo-liberals have strongly espoused free market doctrines from a fundamentalist perspective. Neoconservatives have advocated a vision for U. S. foreign policy based on “American values” and the projection of the Liberal “Democratic” project. Neoconservatives, too, possess a fundamentalist ardour. The American Left, by contrast, has found itself perpetually in defensive mode. Generally speaking, American leftists are supporters of the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b> The trajectory of the <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party</b> may be seen as having advocated for the cultural Left on the fringes of its social policy platform. However, few voices that espouse traditional Leftist values remain in its ranks. Therefore, the American left remains a voice in the wilderness buffeted by both the forces of Liberalism and Conservatism...|$|R
40|$|In the {{two-party system}} of the United States, {{political}} candidates are fated to be separated into 2 ̆ 2 winners 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 losers. 2 ̆ 2 The broad narrative of American political history defines George McGovern {{as one of its}} biggest losers, the victim of Richard Nixon 2 ̆ 7 s 1972 steamroller re-election campaign, which pulled out all the stops, legal and illegal, to convert the moment into a new Republican majority. Ironically, despite Watergate, Nixon remains {{in the minds of many}} Americans as more of a political statesman than his defeated opponent. This recounting of McGovern 2 ̆ 7 s abortive 1984 campaign for the Democratic presidential nomination by the senator 2 ̆ 7 s Connecticut coordinator that year (Marano was twentyfour at the time) reminds us that he was more than the candidate of 2 ̆ 2 acid, amnesty, and abortion. 2 ̆ 2 Republican efforts to cast McGovern in 1972 as an ultra-liberal and even radical political freak were highly successful, and to this day calling someone a 2 ̆ 2 McGovernite 2 ̆ 2 works as effectively as calling someone a 2 ̆ 2 McCarthyite. 2 ̆ 2 Vote Your Conscience, a heavily researched and well-written analysis of McGovern 2 ̆ 7 s 1984 bid for the nomination, helps us understand how misleading the label was. Its signal contribution is to put that event into historical context and to demonstrate what kind of person and politican McGovern really was, and is. Marano begins with a chapter describing how this Methodist minister 2 ̆ 7 s son from a lightly populated prairie agricultural state with a long tradition of conservative Republican domination personally rejuvenated the state 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>party</b> in the 1950 s and got elected first to the House of Representatives and then to the United States Senate as a New Deal Democrat.

40|$|After {{the wave}} of {{conservative}} or neo-liberal governments in Europe in the 1980 <b>s,</b> social <b>democratic</b> <b>parties</b> are back in government in most European countries. At the same time, with the 'third way' as its catch phrase, European social democracy seems to have regained the ideological upper hand. The questions posed in this article are, first, whether {{and to what extent}} European social democracy has, in fact, changed course and, second, what the policy content of the new course is. The article focuses on welfare state policies and offers an analysis of social democratic policies in the Netherlands and Denmark. Our main argument is that the 'third way' is more than a new slogan. A fairly coherent set of supply-side policy intentions can be identified, the core of which is found in job creation, active labor market policies, the promotion of high rates of labor market participation, macro-economic stability and wage moderation. The 'third way', understood in this sense, must be seen as a social democratic response to the economic conditions in which Keynesian demand management through fiscal stimulation is no longer possible. It is, however, more a break with the policies pursued in the 1970 s than a break with basic social democratic principles of social justice...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{is about}} Brazilian migrants 2 ̆ 7 intersecting experiences, perceptions, and interrelationships with place, identity, and change. The {{objective of this}} study is to evaluate migrant spatial processes and sociocultural changes incurred by migration by looking at two older and two recent 2 ̆ 2 migration corridors 2 ̆ 2 between the United States and Brazil. In the late 1980 s over one million Brazilians left Brazil without returning. Today, an estimated two million Brazilians live abroad, and over one million are believed to reside in the United States. What are the reasons so many Brazilians are leaving Brazil to the United States? Are they happy? How do Brazilians self-identify ethno-racially before and after migrating? In what ways do religious affiliation impact migration processes? How are Brazilian men and women dealing with change after migrating, and what are their occupations? In what ways does change affect two places of destination and two places of origin after migration occurs? This research has addressed these important questions by using a transnational theoretical framework, and qualitative multi-methods consisting of 100 in-depth interviews, 12 focus groups, 173 informal interviews, a survey, secondary analysis and participant observation. Fieldwork research was conducted in four places; in two receiving communities: (1) Framingham, Massachusetts, and (2) Marietta, Georgia; and, in two sending communities: (3) Governador Valadares, in the state of Minas Gerais, Brazil, and, (4) Piracanjuba, in the state of Goiás, Brazil. Research results show that Brazilians who migrate to the United States are historically seduced by U. S. idealization and by geographical imaginations incurred by, U. S. Protestant and U. S. cultural influences, and by stories of returnee migrants. Brazilian immigrant women are generally happier in the United States than their male counterparts, who experience a sense of emasculation, as levels of female social capital and economic empowerment increase after immigration. Brazilians self-identify with various ethno-racial categories after migration occurs and tend to have positive interactions with U. S. Whites, but negative interactions with U. S. Blacks and other immigrant groups. Brazilian immigrants experience a low sense of unity within their own community, and if they could vote in the U. S., the majority would vote for the U. <b>S.</b> <b>Democratic</b> <b>Party.</b> The conditions and consequences of migration processes are multi-dimensional, complex, and not economic alone, rather they are generated and sustained by transnational social and religious networks. ...|$|R
