5|$|In June 2002, the <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> impounded at London Heathrow Airport, United Kingdom, {{following}} unpaid debts of £4 million {{owned by}} the national carrier to parts supplier AJ Walters Aviation, causing services between Accra, the UK and Italy to be temporarily suspended. The airline went bankrupt in 2005. Following this, the <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> abandoned and left at Kotaka Airport; {{over the course of}} the following years, various parts were sold for scrap, including the three engines.|$|E
5|$|The <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> {{reported}} to be on sale in March 2011, even though repairs to the left wingtip and stabilizer were still being completed in August 2011. The <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> then sold to a private owner in 2013 and registered in Mexico as XA-MHA.|$|E
5|$|Airplanes began {{being used}} in the Sudan in the 1920s, with revolutionary effect on {{military}} and civilian administration. Flying was hazardous, however. On 4 July 1929 a Fokker FViib/3m owned by the Belgian financier Albert Lowenstein crashed at Mongalla. There were no deaths, but the <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> severely damaged.|$|E
25|$|The {{frontal plane}} or coronal plane divides the body into dorsal and ventral (back and front, or {{posterior}} and anterior) portions. For post-embryonic humans a coronal <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> vertical and a transverse <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> horizontal, but for embryos and quadrupeds a coronal <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> horizontal and a transverse <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> vertical. A longitudinal <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> any <b>plane</b> {{perpendicular to the}} transverse plane. The coronal plane and the sagittal <b>plane</b> <b>are</b> examples of longitudinal planes.|$|R
50|$|A (projective) {{translation}} plane {{having at}} least three nonconcurrent translation lines <b>is</b> a Moufang <b>plane.</b> All {{the lines of a}} Moufang <b>plane</b> <b>are</b> translation lines. Every finite Moufang <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> desarguesian and every desarguesian <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> a Moufang <b>plane,</b> but there <b>are</b> infinite Moufang <b>planes</b> that <b>are</b> not desarguesian (such as the Cayley <b>plane).</b> Moufang <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> coordinatized by alternative division rings.|$|R
50|$|Mirror <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> {{denoted by}} σ. In particular, a {{vertical}} mirror <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> denoted σ.|$|R
5|$|Another {{controversy}} {{surrounds the}} sole {{survivor of the}} flight, a Czech officer, Eduard Prchal. Prchal, like many pilots who {{did not wish to}} tempt fate was known for never wearing his Mae West life jacket — but on this occasion, when rescued from the sea, he was wearing one. During the inquiry he denied this, and later blamed the inconsistency on post-crash shock affecting his actions and memory – essentially, on amnesia. Later he explained that he must have instinctively put the vest on when he realised the <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> in trouble. Polish aviation expert Jerzy Maryniak created a simulation of the crash, in which he concluded that the plane must have been under control up until the very moment of the crash. Kisielewski argues that the <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> likely {{under the control of the}} second pilot, who died in the crash.|$|E
5|$|At 15:16, {{while the}} <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> {{in a shallow}} right turn at 37,000 feet, the fan disk of its {{tail-mounted}} General Electric CF6-6 engine explosively disintegrated. Debris penetrated the tail in numerous places, including the horizontal stabilizer, puncturing the lines of all three hydraulic systems.|$|E
5|$|Baliszewski and Tadeusz Kisielewski {{are among}} those who point out the {{opportunity}} the Soviets had at Gibraltar. At {{about the same time}} that Sikorski's <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> left unguarded at the Gibraltar airfield, a Soviet <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> parked nearby; it carried Soviet ambassador Ivan Maisky, giving the Soviets an officially confirmed presence {{at the site of the}} accident. The head of the British Secret Intelligence Service's counterintelligence for the Iberian Peninsula from 1941 to 1944 was Kim Philby, the Soviet double agent who would defect in 1963 and later claim to have been a double agent since the 1940s. Before 1941, Philby had served as an instructor with the Special Operations Executive, an organization specializing in sabotage and diversion behind enemy lines.|$|E

5000|$|In mathematics, a {{translation}} <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> {{a particular kind}} of projective plane. Almost all non-Desarguesian <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> either translation <b>planes</b> or <b>are</b> related to this type of incidence structure.|$|R
2500|$|The {{sagittal}} <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> a <b>plane</b> {{parallel to}} the sagittal suture. All other sagittal planes (referred to as parasagittal <b>planes)</b> <b>are</b> parallel to it. It {{is also known as}} a [...] "longitudinal plane". The <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> a Y-Z <b>plane,</b> perpendicular to the ground.|$|R
5|$|Flight 253, a Northwest Airlines Airbus A330-323E twinjet, {{registered}} N820NW, with 279 passengers, 8 flight attendants, and 3 pilots aboard, left Amsterdam around 08:45 local time. The <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> {{scheduled to}} arrive in Detroit at 11:40 EST, and was painted in Delta Air Lines' livery, as Northwest was a subsidiary of Delta at the time.|$|E
5|$|In 1926 a small {{aeroplane}} {{landed on the}} summit plateau of Helvellyn and took off again. The <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> an Avro 585 Gosport, a two-seater biplane flown by Bert Hinkler, a test pilot who worked for A V Roe, the plane's manufacturers, at Woodford Aerodrome near Manchester.|$|E
5|$|In heavy rain, Baker {{took off}} and began to level off at 600 feet. A {{quarter of a mile}} into the flight, the engine failed. The <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> {{generally}} easy to crash-land if necessary, something he had done previously at the cost of a few broken ribs.|$|E
50|$|Empyreal <b>Plane</b> This <b>Plane</b> <b>is</b> {{described}} as the Sixth Plane, and creatures from this <b>plane</b> <b>are</b> stated as being impossible to coerce.|$|R

5000|$|A {{sagittal}} (also {{known as}} anteroposterior) <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> an Y-Z <b>plane,</b> {{perpendicular to the}} ground, which separates left from right. The midsagittal <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> the specific sagittal <b>plane</b> that <b>is</b> exactly {{in the middle of}} the body.|$|R
5|$|On {{the morning}} of September 11, 2001, Mihdhar boarded American Airlines Flight 77, which was hijacked {{approximately}} 30 minutes after take off. The <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> deliberately crashed into the Pentagon, killing all 64 people aboard the flight, along with 125 on the ground.|$|E
5|$|The 33-seat Saab 340B {{airplane}} {{used for}} Crossair Flight LX498 had been leased to Crossair from Moldavian Airlines since 1 October 1999. The <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> scheduled {{to depart from}} Zurich Airport on Monday, 10 January 2000, at around 6:00p.m. and arrive at Dresden Airport a few hours later. The cold, drizzly weather was normal for the area, there were no indications that anything {{was wrong with the}} aircraft, and, although this particular aircraft had 24,000 flying hours since its November 1990 delivery, this type of airplane had a very good safety record. Captain Pavel Gruzin, 41, had 8,100 hours of flying time, with 1,900 in the Saab 340 type. Co-pilot Rastislav Kolesár, 35, had about 1,800 total hours, with 1,100 hours in the Saab 340 type. The <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> carrying no unusual payload such as freight or mail and the <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> not due for its next regular maintenance check for another 21 days, on 31 January 2000.|$|E
5|$|After {{aftershocks}} {{from the}} quake had concluded, examination took place, producing a focal {{solution to the}} small events. Movement of these shocks {{was similar to that}} of previous earthquakes around the Azores. For these earthquakes, scientists had determined that the conjugate nodal <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> responsible, seeing shearing on the right-lateral (dextral) side. All faulting in this area is strike-slip-oriented, and on a rather large scale. Because of this research, information now points towards Azores volcanism being controlled by earthquake movement.|$|E
50|$|Three of the Farman <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> christened Aetos, Gyps, and Ierax. The <b>planes</b> <b>were</b> {{paid for}} by money donated by a poet named Matsoukis.|$|R
5000|$|The four {{sentences}} in Torres Strait Creole carry a semantic difference difficult {{to show in}} the English translation. Plein i dhe go plai is the basic sentence — 'the <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> flying away over there'. Plein i plai dhe go is more {{along the lines of}} 'the <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> flying away that way'; plein i plai go dhea <b>is</b> 'the <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> flying away heading that way', and finally plein i dhe plai go <b>is</b> 'the <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> there flying away'.|$|R
50|$|The mental plane, {{also known}} as the causal <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> the third lowest plane {{according}} to Theosophy. The mental <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> divided into seven sub-planes.|$|R
5|$|After {{signing the}} Anglo-Soviet Treaty of 1942 on 26 May Molotov left for Washington, D.C., United States. Molotov met with Franklin D. Roosevelt, the President of the United States, and {{ratified}} a Lend-Lease Treaty between the USSR and the US. Both the British and the United States government, albeit vaguely, promised {{to open up}} a second front against Germany. On his flight back to the USSR his <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> attacked by German fighters, and then later by Soviet fighters.|$|E
5|$|Although Faxai {{never made}} landfall, outer bands {{associated}} with the storm produced torrential rains, amounting to 458mm (18in) on Miyakejima. A Japan Airlines flight to Narita Airport encountered severe turbulence during the afternoon of October27. One person sustained serious injuries, and five others received minor injuries; the <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> damaged during the event. One person was killed near Tokyo as the storm passed by, and three others were injured. Damages from the storm amounted to ¥150million (US$1.5million).|$|E
5|$|American {{casualties}} on 16 January were 22 aircraft {{shot down in}} combat and 27 lost in accidents. The Japanese claimed to have downed 10 aircraft over Hong Kong alone. The US Navy pilots claimed to have destroyed 13 Japanese aircraft. An American pilot who was captured after his <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> shot down at Hong Kong was later murdered by a lethal injection at the Ōfuna prisoner of war camp in Japan.|$|E
50|$|A general {{rotation}} is not simple, and has {{the maximum}} number of planes of rotation as given above. In the general case the angles of rotations in these <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> distinct and the <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> uniquely defined.

25|$|Though most <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> pushed {{across a}} piece of wood, holding it with one or both hands, Japanese <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> pulled toward the body, not pushed away.|$|R
25|$|Because {{foliation}} <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> <b>planes</b> of weakness, these fabrics {{within the}} rocks strongly influence landslide and debris flow hazards. Where the foliation <b>planes</b> <b>are</b> dipping towards a free surface, failure {{is likely to}} occur along these planes.|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} it was {{purchased}} by the wife of the Togolese Minister in 2011, there had been preparations to salvage the plane for its aluminium. The <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> converted and re-opened as a restaurant on 11 November 2013 as a public-private partnership between the Ghana Airport Company Limited and Vindira Company Limited. It {{is the first time that}} a plane based restaurant has opened in Africa.|$|E
5|$|Camouflage may {{extend beyond}} an {{aircraft}}'s airframe. High-flying aircraft {{can sometimes be}} detected by their vapor contrails. Researchers have considered whether these might be reduced {{with the use of}} chemical additives. Work was carried out on a contrail management system for B-2 stealth bombers in 1994. From the Second World War onwards, reconnaissance pilots took care to avoid creating contrails, varying their altitude as necessary; the Lockheed U-2 reconnaissance aircraft was equipped with a mirror to enable the pilot to see if the <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> creating a contrail, and to take action accordingly.|$|E
5|$|Cooper {{served as}} a DH-4 bomber pilot with the United States Army Air Service during World War I. On September 26, 1918, his <b>plane</b> <b>was</b> shot down. The plane caught fire, and Cooper spun the plane to suck the flames out. Cooper survived, {{although}} he suffered burns, injured his hands, and was presumed dead. German soldiers saw his plane's incredible landing {{and took him to}} a prisoner reserve hospital.|$|E
40|$|An oval script O {{sign of a}} {{projective}} <b>plane</b> <b>is</b> called two-transitive {{if there}} is a collineation group G fixing script O sign and acting 2 -transitively on its points.
