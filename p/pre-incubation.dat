40|$|Global {{warming is}} likely to alter {{reproductive}} success of ground-nesting birds that lay eggs normally left unattended for days or even weeks before actual parental incubation, especially in already warm climates. The native North American bobwhite quail (Colinus virginianus) is such a species, and <b>pre-incubation</b> quail eggs may experience temperatures ≥ 45 °C. Yet, almost nothing is known about embryonic survival after such high <b>pre-incubation</b> temperatures. Freshly laid bobwhite quail eggs were exposed during a 12 day <b>pre-incubation</b> period to one of five thermal regimes: low oscillating temperatures (25 - 40 °C, mean = 28. 9 °C), high oscillating temperatures (30 - 45 °C, mean = 33. 9 °C), low constant temperatures (28. 85 °C), high constant temperatures (mean = 33. 9 °C), or commercially employed <b>pre-incubation</b> temperatures (20 °C). After treatment, eggs were then incubated at a standard 37. 5 °C to determine subsequent effects on embryonic development rate, survival, water loss, hatching, and embryonic oxygen consumption. Both quantity of heating degree hours during <b>pre-incubation</b> and specific thermal regime (oscillating vs. non-oscillating) profoundly affected important aspects of embryo survival and indices of development and growth <b>Pre-incubation</b> quail eggs showed a remarkable tolerance to constant high temperatures (up to 45 °C), surviving for 4. 5 ± 0. 3 days of subsequent incubation, but high oscillating <b>pre-incubation</b> temperature increased embryo survival (mean survival 12. 2 ± 1. 8 days) and led to more rapid development than high constant temperature (maximum 38. 5 °C), even though both groups experienced the same total heating degree-hours. Oxygen consumption was ~ 200 - 300 μl O 2. egg. min- 1 at hatching in all groups, and was not affected by <b>pre-incubation</b> conditions. Oscillating temperatures, which are the norm for <b>pre-incubation</b> quail eggs in their natural habitat, thus enhanced survival at higher temperatures. However, a 5 °C increase in <b>pre-incubation</b> temperature, which equates to the predicted long-term increases of 5 °C or more, nonetheless reduced hatching rate by approximately 50 %.

40|$|Morphological properties, species {{specific}} differences, development, {{and function}} of egg envelopes are of importance for {{a better understanding of}} fertilization strategies as well as for captive reproduction. We reviewed morphology and the developmental stages of egg envelopes, mechanism of polyspermy block, and also the role of micropyle and cortical granules in polyspermy block for acipenserid eggs. The structure of the egg envelope is similar among the acipenserids, comprising an external envelope (thecal cells, basal lamina, and follicular epithelium), a five-layered oocyte envelope (adhesive layer, alveolar layer, epilayer, and zona radiata externa and interna) and a layer of oocyte matrix and cortical granules. The development of acipenserid egg envelope within the ovary comprises five stages, with further changes following fertilization. Moreover, we standardized the terminology used to describe the egg membranes which can minimize the confusions and be helpful for future work on acipenserids eggs as well as for other fish species. The sperm to egg ratio (required to fertilize eggs) and effects of <b>pre-incubation</b> of eggs in freshwater before fertilization were studied to standardized fertilization protocols for sterlet Acipenser ruthenus. <b>Pre-incubation</b> time had no effect on fertilization success at 430, 000 : 1 and 43, 000 : 1 sperm to egg ratios, while it was significant at the 4300 : 1 and 430 : 1 ratios. The use of adequate experimental suboptimal sperm to egg ratio revealed a positive effect of <b>pre-incubation</b> time, such that at the 430 : 1 ratio, 0. 5 min <b>pre-incubation</b> increased the fertilization rate than 10 min. Transmission electron microscopy showed that <b>pre-incubation</b> of eggs in water for < 10 min did not trigger a cortical reaction, suggesting that a low sperm to egg ratio 0. 5 to 1 min <b>pre-incubation</b> of eggs in freshwater prior to fertilization can enhance fertilization rate of sterlet (minimally do not change fertilization). The effects of <b>pre-incubation</b> in seawater and the duration of egg receptivity were determined for fresh and over-ripe sea bass eggs. Our results revealed a significant effect of <b>pre-incubation</b> time for both the fresh (P < 0. 01) and over-ripe eggs (P < 0. 01). The fresh eggs had a higher fertilization success than over-ripe eggs. Fertilization success of eggs significantly declined for both of these treatments after 3 min of <b>pre-incubation</b> clearly indicated that sea bass eggs are able to be fertilized by sperm for up to 3 min after release into seawater. Effects of <b>pre-incubation</b> of eggs and activation medium on the percentage of eyed embryos for Ide Leuciscus idus were examined. At the eyed-egg stage, <b>pre-incubation</b> time was significant for the freshwater activation medium (P < 0. 001), such that the percentage of eyed embryos declined across the <b>pre-incubation</b> time gradient. Activating medium had a significant effect on the percentage of eyed embryos for each <b>pre-incubation</b> time (P < 0. 05). More precisely, freshwater produced the lowest percentage of eyed embryos at all <b>pre-incubation</b> times, whereas saline water and Woynarovich solution produced the highest percentage of eyed embryos at 0 s and 30 s before incubation. Examination of sperm traits showed no impact of activating medium on computer assisted sperm analysis parameters. Our results suggested that saline water or Woynarovich solution improve fertilization rate in Ide during fertilization. In conclusion, this thesis provides basic knowledge on gamete biology, role of egg receptivity period, effects of <b>pre-incubation</b> of eggs and different activating medium which can be useful to understand the fertilization strategies of different externally fertilizing fishes as well as standardize their fertilization protocol for captive reproduction...|$|E

40|$|Northern bobwhite {{populations have}} {{declined}} concurrent with global warming. The focal period {{of this study}} was the 12 -d <b>pre-incubation</b> period, when bobwhite eggs remain in the nest without the thermal protection of the incubating parent. This study first established the storage and thermal limits of bobwhite eggs, then investigated how global warming may impact oviparous embryos and how bobwhite embryos react to acute and chronic doses of simulated drought temperatures during <b>pre-incubation.</b> First, the maximum storage limit of bobwhite eggs was determined by storing eggs &# 8804; 21 d and measuring hatching success and pH of egg albumen and yolk. Hatching success of stored eggs declined after 14 d, when yolk and albumen pH reached levels detrimental to embryonic development. Secondly, thermal limits were determined by exposing bobwhite eggs to hyperthermic temperatures (38 - 52 °C). Bobwhite embryos survived 50 °C for 1 h, 49 °C for 3 h and 46 °C for 6 h. Results indicate an adaptation to the naturally occurring temperature extremes that can occur in the bobwhite's southern range during <b>pre-incubation.</b> Subsequently, bobwhite eggs were exposed to either low constant (LC), low fluctuating (LF), high constant (HC), or high fluctuating (HF) temperatures during <b>pre-incubation</b> to determine if the nature of temperatures differentially affected development. Although eggs exposed to high heat loads (HC and HF), and low heat loads (LF and LC) had equal heating degree-hours within groups, they exhibited differential growth during <b>pre-incubation.</b> Oxygen consumption, hatch timing, and hatching success were also affected by the thermal regimes. Eggs in simulated drought (HF) had a 47 % lower hatch rate than eggs in simulated non-drought (LF) indicating that thermal stress during <b>pre-incubation</b> may contribute to population declines during drought. Finally, northern bobwhite eggs were exposed to acute or chronic doses of simulated drought temperatures, which tested for critical periods of development during <b>pre-incubation.</b> Collectively, data indicated that the earliest stages of bobwhite development were more affected by hyperthermic temperatures.

Eggs were collected daily from six-months-old quail and stored at room temperature (25 - 29 C) for 0 to 20 days before incubation in an electric incubator. Eggs that failed to hatch were opened foro determination of fertility and estimation of time of death of embryos. A total of 196 (29. 3 %) eggs out of 668 incubated hatched successfully. The length of <b>pre-incubation</b> storage was negatively correlated (r =- 0. 91; P < 0. 0001) with hatchability. The highest hatchability (72. 3 %) was obtained from eggs that were not stored (Day 0 of storage). Hatchability dropped sharply after storage for 9 days. No egg hatched following <b>pre-incubation</b> storage of over 11 days. Among the unhatched eggs, there were significantly more apparently infertile than fertile eggs (P < 0. 0002). There was no relationship between <b>pre-incubation</b> length of storage and the proportion of embryos that died in early, middle or late incubation period.

40|$|Quantification of {{microbial}} activities {{involved in}} soil organic carbon (SOC) decomposition {{is critical for}} the prediction of the long-term impact of climate change on soil respiration (SR) and SOC stock. Although the temperature sensitivity of SR is especially critical in semi-arid regions, such as North West Tunisia, where the SOC stock is low, {{little research has been}} carried out in these environments. More needs to be known about factors, such as SOC availability that influence temperature sensitivity. In this study, soil samples were incubated with and without glucose addition for 28 days after a 28 -day <b>pre-incubation</b> period. <b>Pre-incubation</b> and incubation was carried out at 20 degrees C, 30 degrees C, 40 degrees C and 50 degrees C. Respiration measurements were taken with temperature, glucose addition and incubation time as independent variables. The highest <b>pre-incubation</b> temperature reduced the temperature sensitivity of SR during the subsequent incubation period, both with and without glucose addition. Soil samples pre-incubated at 50 degrees C had the lowest SR at all subsequent incubation temperatures and the lowest temperature sensitivity of SR, even after glucose addition. However, after glucose addition, the effect of a high <b>pre-incubation</b> temperature on soil respiration lasted only two days. Measuring the water-soluble carbon (WSC) in soil samples suggested that the high <b>pre-incubation</b> temperature may have killed part of the microbial biomass, modified microbial communities or solubilized SOC. For quantifying the possible effect of global warming, in particular heat waves, on soil respiration in the soil studied, the results indicate a moderate response of soil respiration to temperature at high temperatures, as shown by Q(10) close to 1. 7, even in the range 40 - 50 degrees C...|$|E
40|$|An unusual {{effect of}} {{temperature}} on the ATPase activity of E. coli F 1 Fo ATP synthase has been investigated. The rate of ATP hydrolysis by the isolated enzyme, previously kept on ice, showed a lag phase when measured at 15 degrees C, {{but not at}} 37 degrees C. A <b>pre-incubation</b> of the enzyme {{at room temperature for}} 5 min completely eliminated the lag phase, and resulted in a higher steady-state rate. Similar results were obtained using the isolated enzyme after incorporation into liposomes. The initial rates of ATP-dependent proton translocation, as measured by 9 -amino- 6 -chloro- 2 -methoxyacridine (ACMA) fluorescence quenching, at 15 degrees C also varied according to the <b>pre-incubation</b> temperature. The relationship between this temperature-dependent pattern of enzyme activity, termed thermohysteresis, and <b>pre-incubation</b> with other agents was examined. <b>Pre-incubation</b> of membrane vesicles with azide and Mg 2 +, without exogenous ADP, resulted in almost complete inhibition of the initial rate of ATPase when assayed at 10 degrees C, but had little effect at 37 degrees C. Rates of ATP synthesis following this <b>pre-incubation</b> were not affected at any temperature. Azide inhibition of ATP hydrolysis by the isolated enzyme was reduced when an ATP-regenerating system was used. A gradual reactivation of azide-blocked enzyme was slowed down by the presence of phosphate in the reaction medium. The well-known Mg 2 + inhibition of ATP hydrolysis was shown to be greatly enhanced at 15 degrees C relative to at 37 degrees C. The results suggest that thermohysteresis is a consequence of an inactive form of the enzyme that is stabilized by the binding of inhibitory Mg-ADP...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to evaluate the effects of Saccharomyces cerevisiae on in vitro gas production (GP) kinetics and degradability of corn stover, oat straw, sugarcane bagasse and sorghum straw. Feedstuffs were incubated with different doses of yeast [0, 4, 8 and 12 mg/g dry matter (DM) ] at direct addition or 72 h <b>pre-incubation.</b> Rumen GP was recorded at 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 24, 30, 48, 54 and 72 h of incubation. After 72 h, rumen pH and methane were determined and contents were filtrated for DM, neutral (NDF) and acid detergent fibre (ADF) degradability. Fibrous species×method of application×yeast interactions occurred (P< 0. 001) for all measured ruminal GP parameters and degradability. The direct addition or 72 h <b>pre-incubation</b> of S. cerevisiae with corn stover improved (P< 0. 05) GP and methane and decreased (P< 0. 05) the lag time (L) and NDF degradability (NDFD). The direct addition of S. cerevisiae to oat straw increased (P< 0. 05) rate of GP (c) and decreased (P< 0. 05) asymptotic GP (b). However, 72 h <b>pre-incubation</b> increased (P< 0. 05) c with linearly decreased b, DM degradability (DMD) and NDFD. Applying S. cerevisiae for 72 h <b>pre-incubation</b> decreased (P< 0. 001) methane emission. The direct addition or 72 h <b>pre-incubation</b> of S. cerevisiae to sorghum straw increased (P< 0. 05) b, c, L, DMD and NDFD. Overall, the effect of dose varied among different feedstuffs and different application methods. Results suggested that the direct addition of S. cerevisiae could support and improve ruminal fermentation of lowquality forages at 4 to 12 g/kg DM...|$|E
