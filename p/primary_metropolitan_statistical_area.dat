They include <b>metropolitan</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>areas</b> (MSA’s), consolidated <b>metropolitan</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>areas</b> (CMSA’s), and <b>primary</b> <b>metropolitan</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>areas</b> (PMSA’s). An area that qualifies as an MSA and has a population of one million or more may be recognized as a CMSA if separate component areas that demonstrate strong internal, social, and economic ties can be identified within the entire area and local opinion supports the component areas. Component areas, if recognized, are designated PMSA’s. If no PMSA’s are designated within the area, then the area remains an MSA. The S&MM survey uses the definitions of MSA throughout the survey and of CMSA when CMSA’s are created. We use the 30 metropolitan areas described in table 1.

40|$|This article {{examines}} alternative models of producer services development in metro-politan communities and analyzes {{factors associated with}} the development of producer services in two deindustrializing urban communities — the <b>primary</b> <b>metropolitan</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>areas</b> (PMSAs) of Cleveland and Akron, Ohio. Sample surveys of producer services in each metropolitan area reveal that establishments: (1) tend to be primarily dependent upon the revenue generated by local trade within the local metropolitan area; (2) tend to simultaneously engage in nonlocal trade and directly contribute to interurban integration and dominance of large metropolitan centers; and (3) engage most extensively in trade, both locally and nonlocally, with other service-sector industries, rather than manufacturing. These findings suggest that producer services development may be sustained in deindustrializing urban communities and that it is not primarily dependent upon trade with locally based manufacturing industry. An important facet of industrial restructuring in the U. S. has been the growth of "producer services " in urban communities. In theory, producer services provide their products of labor to business firms and other productive enterprises such as government agencies (Greenfield 1966; Sassen 1991) 1 In practice, the producer services sector has been operationally defined as including banking and financial services, real estate, insurance, business services, legal services and engineering, architecture and accounting services (Browning and Singelmann 1978; Singelmann 1978 a, 1978 b). Over the period from 1980 to 1988, employment in the producer services sector expanded by 50. 6 % in U. S. metropolitan counties which represented 4. 7 miWon new jobs.

5000|$|The U.S. Census Bureau first {{designated}} {{metropolitan areas}} in 1950 as standard metropolitan areas (SMAs). The [...] "New York-Northeastern NJ SMA" [...] was defined to include 17 counties: 9 in New York (the five boroughs of New York City, Nassau, Suffolk, Westchester, and Rockland) and 8 in New Jersey (Bergen, Hudson, Passaic, Essex, Union, Morris, Somerset, and Middlesex). In 1960, {{the metropolitan area}} standards were modified and renamed standard <b>metropolitan</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>areas</b> (SMSAs). The new standards resulted in the splitting of the former SMA into several pieces: the nine New York counties became the [...] "New York SMSA"; three of the New Jersey counties (Essex, Union, and Morris) became the [...] "Newark SMSA"; two other New Jersey counties (Bergen and Passaic) became the [...] "Paterson-Passaic-Clifton SMSA"; Hudson County was designated the [...] "Jersey City SMSA"; and Middlesex and Somerset counties lost their metropolitan status. In 1973, {{a new set of}} metropolitan area standards resulted in further changes: Nassau and Suffolk counties were split off as their own SMSA ("Nassau-Suffolk SMSA"); Bergen County (originally part of the Paterson-Clifton-Passaic SMSA) was transferred to the New York SMSA; the New York SMSA also received Putnam County (previously non-metropolitan); Somerset County was added to the Newark SMSA; and two new SMSAs, the [...] "New Brunswick-Perth Amboy-Sayreville SMSA" [...] (Middlesex County) and [...] "Long Branch-Asbury Park SMSA" [...] (Monmouth County), were established. In 1983, the concept of a consolidated <b>metropolitan</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>area</b> (CMSA) was first implemented. A CMSA consisted of several <b>primary</b> <b>metropolitan</b> <b>statistical</b> <b>areas</b> (PMSAs), which were individual employment centers within a wider labor market area. The [...] "New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island CMSA" [...] consisted of 12 PMSAs. Seven PMSAs were based on the original 1950 New York SMA that were split up: New York, Bergen-Passaic, Jersey City, Middlesex-Somerset-Hunterdon (Hunterdon added for the first time), Monmouth-Ocean (Ocean added for the first time), Nassau-Suffolk, and Newark (Sussex added for the first time). One additional PMSA was the Orange County PMSA (previously the Newburgh-Middletown SMSA). The other four PMSAs were former SMSAs in Connecticut: Bridgeport, Stamford, Norwalk, and Danbury. In 1993, four PMSAs were added to the New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island CMSA: Trenton PMSA (Mercer County), Dutchess County PMSA, Waterbury PMSA, and New Haven PMSA. Several new counties were also added to the CMSA: Sussex, Warren, and Pike. The CMSA model was originally utilized for tabulating data from the 2000 census. In 2003, a new set of standards was established using the Core Based <b>Statistical</b> <b>Area</b> (CBSA) model was adopted and remains in use as of 2010. The CBSA model resulted in the splitting up of the old CMSA into several <b>metropolitan</b> <b>statistical</b> areas: New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island, Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown, Trenton-Ewing, Bridgeport-Stamford-Norwalk (includes Danbury), and New Haven-Milford (includes Waterbury). In 2013, the Census Bureau added Carbon, Lehigh, Northampton, and Monroe counties in Pennsylvania, and Warren County, New Jersey (encompassing collectively the Allentown-Bethlehem-Easton, PA-NJ MSA and the East Stroudsburg, PA MSA), to the Combined <b>Statistical</b> <b>Area,</b> and assimilated Poughkeepsie-Newburgh-Middletown into the larger New York-Northern New Jersey-Long Island-NY-NJ-PA MSA.|$|R
