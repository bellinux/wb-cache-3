The 33d received a Distinguished Unit Citation for action on 15 January 1943 when nine German Junkers Ju 88 bombers escorted by four Italian Macchi C.202 fighters attempted to knock out the group's base at Thelepte. Group airplanes on combat air patrol drove off the escorting fighters. Other group planes took off while the field was being bombed. The group destroyed eight of the attackers, and the ninth was shot down by antiaircraft fire.|$|E

25|$|On 13 March, {{the upper}} Clyde port of Clydebank near Glasgow was bombed. All but seven of its 12,000 houses were damaged. Many more ports were {{attacked}}. Plymouth was attacked five times {{before the end}} of the month while Belfast, Hull, and Cardiff were hit. Cardiff was bombed on three nights, Portsmouth centre was devastated by five raids. The rate of civilian housing lost was averaging 40,000 people per week dehoused in September 1940. In March 1941, two raids on Plymouth and London dehoused 148,000 people. Still, while heavily damaged, British ports continued to support war industry and supplies from North America continued to pass through them while the Royal Navy continued to operate in Plymouth, Southampton, and Portsmouth. Plymouth in particular, because of its vulnerable position on the south coast and close proximity to German air bases, was subjected to the heaviest attacks. On 10/11 March, 240 bombers dropped 193 tons of high explosives and 46,000 incendiaries. Many houses and commercial centres were heavily damaged, the electrical supply was knocked out, and five oil tanks and two magazines exploded. Nine days later, two waves of 125 and 170 bombers dropped heavy bombs, including 160 tons of high explosive and 32,000 incendiaries. Much of the city centre was destroyed. Damage was inflicted on the <b>port</b> <b>installations,</b> but many bombs fell on the city itself. On 17 April 346 tons of explosives and 46,000 incendiaries were dropped from 250 bombers led by KG 26. The damage was considerable, and the Germans also used aerial mines. Over 2,000 AAA shells were fired, destroying two Ju 88s. By the end of the air campaign over Britain, only eight percent of the German effort against British ports was made using mines.|$|E

500|$|Although Greta did not {{directly}} track over land as a tropical storm or hurricane, {{the size of the}} system contributed to large waves, exceeding [...] in height over a large expanse of the Atlantic. Impacts from the storm were felt as far away as the eastern United States. The National Weather Bureau warned ships {{in the vicinity of the}} system to take precautions. St. Croix was nearly isolated and stressed into an emergency due to Greta after the storm's swells destroyed docks and prevented ships carrying food from reaching the island. Several light vessels were destroyed by Greta's gale-force winds and only schooners with little carrying capacity were able to make it to the island. Along the coast of Jacksonville, Florida alone, coastal structures sustained roughly $1.2million (1956 USD; $9.6million 2009 USD) in damages. In Puerto Rico, waves up to [...] caused significant damage and resulted in the death of one person after he did not evacuate his home. Swells up to [...] were recorded in the Virgin Islands.

The first operations of Vian's new command were against Japanese oil and <b>port</b> <b>installations</b> in Sumatra (Operations Cockpit, Transom, Lentil and Meridian). These served to damage the enemy's capabilities, distract his attention from events elsewhere and provide experience for the British and Commonwealth crews in the procedures that they would use while working with the Americans in the western Pacific. The U.S. aircraft carrier, , participated in the training exercises and the first two operations. Vian was Mentioned in Despatches once again for [...] "bravery, skill and devotion to duty". Once in the Pacific, the BPF operated as Task Force 57 from March 1945, providing air support for the American invasion of Okinawa (Operation Iceberg). Their role was to interdict the Sakishima Islands, suppressing Japanese air operations. Vian's carriers were externally resistant to the determined suicide attacks, returning to active service within hours. He was promoted to vice admiral on 8 May 1945.|$|E
2500|$|The British {{had fought}} the Somaliland Campaign, a twenty-year long {{campaign}} from 1900–1920, against Mohammed Abdullah Hassan and the Dervish state {{to gain control}} over the territory. In 1910 the British garrison {{had been forced to}} retreat to the coast {{until the end of the}} First World War, only ending the insurgency in 1920, after four campaigns by attacking with local troops, a KAR battalion and aircraft. After three weeks of operations the Dervishes were defeated. The colony had an area of about [...] with a plain inland from the coast up to [...] deep, ending at a mountain range an average of [...] high. Agriculture was sparse and the 320,000 inhabitants lived off livestock. Berbera, the biggest town and port, was ringed by desert and scrubland; in the cold season it had a population of about 30,000, falling to around 15,000 in the summer months. Berbera was a first class anchorage and was the principal entrepot of the colony, despite having no <b>port</b> <b>installations</b> and ships having to load and unload by boat. From July to August the Kharif a strong and hot wind blew, making it impossible to work. According to the Hornby Report of 1936, the War Office intended to offer no resistance to an invasion but this was revoked on 19 December 1939, in favour of a defence of the country and of the port of Berbera as a last resort. In 1940, British Somaliland was garrisoned by 631 members of the Somaliland Camel Corps (SCC) in five locations and a small party of police at Berbera. The SCC had only rifles, machine-guns and anti-tank rifles, the infantry rifles being old Belgian [...] calibre single-shot models, with 1.4 million rounds of dubious quality; the SCC had a transport pool of 29 motor vehicles 122 horses and 244 camels.|$|E

40|$|Shore to ship’ system – ships’ {{power supply}} {{from the local}} {{electrical}} substations – {{is one of the}} effective ways to limit the negative impact of the ships lying in ports on the environment. Energy infrastructure of the <b>port</b> <b>installation</b> necessary to provide ships with power supply has to be designed so that different types of ships can use it. The important issue concerning ‘shore to ship’ system is the quality of power supply. This can be achieved via sustaining continuity of power supply while switching from the ships’ electrical network over to the national grid. In this article the author presents the way of synchronizing the national grid with the ships’ electrical network during ship’s lying in port. Such synchronization would allow for uninterruptible work of the ship’s electrical devices...|$|R

50|$|Garrison Point Fort is {{a former}} {{artillery}} fort situated {{at the end of}} the Garrison Point peninsula at Sheerness on the Isle of Sheppey in Kent. Built in the 1860s in response to concerns about a possible French invasion, it was the last in a series of artillery batteries that had existed on the site since the mid-16th century. The fort's position enabled it to guard the strategic point where the River Medway meets the Thames. It is a rare example of a two-tiered casemated fort - one of only two of that era in the country - with a design that is otherwise similar to that of several of the other forts along the lower Thames. It remained operational until 1956 and is now used by the Sheerness Docks as a <b>port</b> <b>installation.</b>|$|R
