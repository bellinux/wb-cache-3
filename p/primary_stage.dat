5|$|For Green Granite, Penney {{proposed}} a design based on radiation implosion and staging. There would be three stages, {{which he called}} Tom, Dick and Harry. Tom, the <b>primary</b> <b>stage,</b> would be a fission bomb. It would produce radiation to implode a secondary, Dick, another fission service. In turn, it would implode Harry, a thermonuclear tertiary. Henceforth, the British designers would refer to Tom, Dick and Harry rather than primary, secondary and tertiary. They still had only vague ideas about how a thermonuclear weapon would work, and whether one, two, or three stages would be required. Nor was there much more certainty about the boosted designs, with no agreement on whether the boosting thermonuclear fuel was best placed inside the hollow core, as in Orange Herald, or wrapped around it, as in Green Bamboo. Keith Roberts and John Ward studied the detonation waves in a thermonuclear detonation, {{but there was an}} incomplete understanding of radiation implosion.|$|E

25|$|LGV {{may begin}} as a self-limited painless genital ulcer that {{occurs at the}} contact site 3–12 days after {{infection}}. Women rarely notice a primary infection because the initial ulceration where the organism penetrates the mucosal layer is often located out of sight, in the vaginal wall. In men fewer than 1/3 of those infected notice {{the first signs of}} LGV. This <b>primary</b> <b>stage</b> heals in a few days. Erythema nodosum occurs in 10% of cases.|$|E

25|$|The {{conversion}} of ammonium to nitrate is performed primarily by soil-living bacteria and other nitrifying bacteria. In the <b>primary</b> <b>stage</b> of nitrification, the oxidation of ammonium (NH) is performed by bacteria {{such as the}} Nitrosomonas species, which converts ammonia to nitrites (NO). Other bacterial species such as Nitrobacter, {{are responsible for the}} oxidation of the nitrites (NO) into nitrates (NO). It is important for the ammonia (NH) to be converted to nitrates or nitrites because ammonia gas is toxic to plants.|$|E
25|$|A {{neutron bomb}} is only {{feasible}} if the yield is sufficiently high that efficient fusion stage ignition is possible, {{and if the}} yield is low enough that the case thickness will not absorb too many neutrons. This means that neutron bombs have a yield range of 1–10 kilotons, with fission proportion varying from 50% at 1-kiloton to 25% at 10-kilotons (all of which comes from the <b>primary</b> <b>stage).</b> The neutron output per kiloton is then 10–15 times greater than for a pure fission implosion weapon or for a strategic warhead like a W87 or W88.|$|E
25|$|The pre-primary {{stage is}} the {{foundation}} of children's knowledge, skills and behaviour.

In rural India, pre-primary schools are rarely available in small villages and urban areas on the contrary.

500|$|While non-Chinese analysts {{generally}} {{agree that}} the CCP has rejected orthodox Marxism–Leninism and Mao Zedong Thought (or at least basic thoughts within orthodox thinking), the CCP itself disagrees. Certain groups argue that Jiang Zemin ended the CCP's formal commitment to Marxism {{with the introduction of}} the ideological theory, the Three Represents. However, party theorist Leng Rong disagrees, claiming that [...] "President Jiang rid the Party of the ideological obstacles to different kinds of ownership [...] He did not give up Marxism or socialism. He strengthened the Party by providing a modern understanding of Marxism and socialism—which is why we talk about a 'socialist market economy' with Chinese characteristics." [...] The attainment of true [...] "communism" [...] is still described as the CCP's and China's [...] "ultimate goal". While the CCP claims that China is in the <b>primary</b> <b>stage</b> of socialism, party theorists argue that the current development stage [...] "looks a lot like capitalism". Alternatively, certain party theorists argue that [...] "capitalism is the early or first stage of communism." [...] Some have dismissed the concept of a <b>primary</b> <b>stage</b> of socialism as intellectual cynicism. According to Robert Lawrence Kuhn, a China analyst, [...] "When I first heard this rationale, I thought it more comic than clever—a wry caricature of hack propagandists leaked by intellectual cynics.

The official explanation for China's economic reforms is that the country is in the <b>primary</b> <b>stage</b> of socialism, a developmental stage similar to the capitalist mode of production.

500|$|Syphilis is {{a sexually}} {{transmitted}} infection caused by the bacterium Treponema pallidum subspecies pallidum. The {{signs and symptoms of}} syphilis vary depending in which of the four stages it presents (primary, secondary, latent, and tertiary). The <b>primary</b> <b>stage</b> classically presents with a single chancre (a firm, painless, non-itchy skin ulceration) but there may be multiple sores. In secondary syphilis a diffuse rash occurs, which frequently involves the palms of the hands and soles of the feet. There may also be sores in the mouth or vagina. In latent syphilis, which can last for years, there are few or no symptoms. In tertiary syphilis there are gummas (soft non-cancerous growths), neurological, or heart symptoms. Syphilis has been known as [...] "the great imitator" [...] as it may cause symptoms similar to many other diseases.|$|E
500|$|Deng Xiaoping Theory {{was added}} to the party {{constitution}} at the 14th National Congress. The concepts of [...] "socialism with Chinese characteristics" [...] and [...] "the <b>primary</b> <b>stage</b> of socialism" [...] were credited to the theory. Deng Xiaoping Theory can be defined as a belief that state socialism and state planning is not by definition communist, and that market mechanisms are class neutral. In addition, the party needs to react to the changing situation dynamically; to know if a certain policy is obsolete or not, the party had to [...] "seek truth from facts" [...] and follow the slogan [...] "practice is the sole criterion for the truth". At the 14th National Congress, Jiang reiterated Deng's mantra that it was unnecessary to ask if something was socialist or capitalist, since the important factor was whether it worked.|$|E

For the opening song, [...] "Zoo Station", Bono entered as his <b>primary</b> <b>stage</b> persona, [...] "The Fly", appearing silhouetted against a giant screen of blue and white video noise interwoven with glimpses of xerox animations of the band members. [...] "The Fly" [...] was usually performed next, with the video monitors flashing a rapidly changing array of textual words and aphorisms. Some of these included [...] "Taste is the enemy of art", [...] "Religion is a club", [...] "Ignorance is bliss", [...] "Watch more TV", [...] "Believe" [...] with letters fading out to leave [...] "lie", and [...] "Everything you know is wrong". (During {{the first week of the}} tour, media outlets incorrectly reported that the words shown included [...] "Bomb Japan Now", forcing the band to issue a statement denying the claim.) Before [...] "Even Better Than the Real Thing", Bono channel surfed through live television programming, and during the song, as random images from television and pop culture flashed on screen, he filmed himself and the band with a camcorder.|$|E
30|$|There is {{very limited}} data {{on the value of}} 18 F-DCFPyL PET/CT in <b>primary</b> <b>staging</b> of {{prostate}} cancer in present literature. 18 F-DCFPyL PET/CT has been intra-individually compared with 18 F-PSMA- 1007 for <b>primary</b> <b>staging</b> in a pilot study in 12 prostate cancer patients (Giesel et al. 2017). Imaging with both tracers resulted in identical clinical findings. No histopathological confirmation of metastases is reported in this study. To our knowledge no other data is present in literature on 18 F-DCFPyL PET in <b>primary</b> <b>staging,</b> therefor this study is the first to present data of a large cohort (>[*] 100 patients) in the setting of <b>primary</b> <b>staging.</b> Also for other 18 F-labbeld PSMA targeting radiopharmaceuticals there is no data present on its role in newly diagnosed prostate cancer. For 68 Ga labelled PSMA targeting radiopharmaceuticals, a recent systematic review focussing on <b>primary</b> <b>staging</b> of prostate cancer shows a substantial variation in methodology and outcomes amongst studies. However it is concluded that the ability of 68 Ga-PSMA PET to detect malignant lesions is evident across studies, with most studies demonstrating increased detection rates with respect to conventional imaging modalities (Corfield et al. 2018).|$|R

2500|$|The term [...] "socialism with Chinese characteristics" [...] {{was added}} to the General Program of the party's {{constitution}} at the 12th National Congress, without a definition of the term. At the 13th National Congress, held in 1987, Zhao Ziyang, the CPC General Secretary, claimed that socialism with Chinese characteristics was the [...] "integration of the fundamental tenets of Marxism with the modernization drive in China" [...] and was [...] "scientific socialism rooted in the realities of present-day China". By this time the CPC believed that China was in the <b>primary</b> <b>stage</b> of socialism, and therefore needed market relations to develop into a socialist society. Two years earlier, Su had tried to internationalize the term [...] "primary stage of socialism" [...] by claiming that socialism contained three different production phases. China was currently in the first phase, while the Soviet Union and the remaining Eastern Bloc countries were in the second phase. Because China was in the <b>primary</b> <b>stage</b> of socialism, Zhao argued that in [...] " [...] {{for a long time to}} come, we shall develop various sectors of the economy, always ensuring the dominant position of the public sector". Further, some individuals should be allowed to become rich [...] "before the objective of common prosperity [...] is achieved". Lastly, during the <b>primary</b> <b>stage</b> of socialism, planning would no longer be the primary means of organization of the economy.
