5|$|Although {{overall the}} shape of Jupiter's {{magnetosphere}} resembles that of the Earth's, closer to the planet its structure is very different. Jupiter's volcanically active moon Io is a strong source of plasma in its own right, and loads Jupiter's magnetosphere with as much as 1,000kg of new material every second. Strong volcanic eruptions on Io emit huge amounts of sulfur dioxide, {{a major part of}} which is dissociated into atoms and ionized by the solar ultraviolet radiation, producing ions of sulfur and oxygen: S+, O+, S2+ and O2+. These ions escape from the satellite's atmosphere and form the Io plasma torus: a thick and relatively cool ring of plasma encircling Jupiter, located near Io's orbit. The plasma temperature within the torus is 10–100eV (100,000–1,000,000K), which is much lower than that of the particles in the radiation belts—10keV (100millionK). The plasma in the torus is forced into co-rotation with Jupiter, meaning both share the same <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation.</b> The Io torus fundamentally alters the dynamics of the Jovian magnetosphere.|$|E
40|$|Number 8 Information on {{the motion}} of {{phytoplankton}} in shear flows is essential for predicting or understanding effects of turbulence on processes such as nutrient uptake, aggregate formation, and phytoplankter-herbivore interactions. Of particular interest is {{the motion of}} diatom chains because {{they are expected to}} benefit most from enhancement of nutrient flux due to turbulence and are often the most abundant components in aggregates. We studied the motion of two chain-forming diatoms, Skeletonema costatum and Thalassiosira nordenskiiildii, in steady shear flow and in the light of available theory for rigid, elongated spheroids. Both species underwent periodic rotation upon exposure to a simple shear flow, as predicted by theory. Whereas the rotational orbits of S. costutum resembled those predicted by theory for rigid spheroids, the rotational motion of T. nordenskiiildii was more like the motion of flexible fibers observed in engineering applications. <b>Periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> S. costutum increased linearly with increasing axis ratio, whereas no clear relationship was observed between <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> and axis ratios for T. nordenskiiildii.

5|$|During one <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> for PSR B1937+21, {{there are}} two peaks observed, known as the pulse and interpulse. PSR B1937+21 is unusual among pulsars in that it {{occasionally}} produces pulses far brighter than an average pulse. Until 1995, the sole other pulsar known to produce giant pulses was the Crab pulsar, and by 2006, there were 11 pulsars that had been observed to produce giant pulses {{out of more than}} 1500 known pulsars. The giant pulses of PSR B1937+21 were first observed in 1984, shortly after its discovery, but difficulty in observing single pulses of PSR B1937+21 due to its fast period meant that the pulses were not studied in more depth until a decade after they were first observed. In more recent follow up observations, more giant pulses have been found. These giant pulses have been observed to occur at the trailing edge of both the pulse and interpulse. The duration of these giant pulses is short compared to the period of the pulsar, lasting on the order of 10 nanoseconds. The flux density of observed pulses is somewhat variable, but has been observed to be as high as 6.5 Wm−2Hz−1 (6.5 janskys). The brightness temperature of a pulse with such high flux density and such low duration exceeds 5 kelvins, making the pulses of PSR B1937+21 the brightest radio emission ever observed. PSR B1937+21 is intrinsically the most luminous millisecond pulsar. In addition to the radio pulses observed, pulses have been detected at x-ray wavelengths, which show the same pulse and interpulse pattern.|$|E

40|$|The recent {{discovery}} of a planet around the closest star, Proxima Centauri, could represent a quantum leap on the testability of models in exoplanet sciences. Unlike any other discovered exoplanet, models of planetary processes in Proxima b could be contrasted against near future telescopic observations and far future in-situ measurements. In this paper we study the geomagnetic properties of Proxima b analogues, namely, solid planets with masses close but larger than Earth's mass, <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> <b>of</b> several days and habitable surface conditions. Assuming different planetary masses, bulk compositions and <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotations,</b> we calculate for each planetary analogue its radius, heat flux, time of inner core formation, dynamo lifetime and minimum dipole magnetic moment. We find that most (≳ 70 %) Proxima b analogues develop intrinsic dynamos that last at least 3 Gyr, although only {{half of them are}} older than the present age of the host star (4 - 6 Gyr). Relying in our planetary evolution models, we predict with a 70 % confidence level that Proxima b will be an earth-like planet with mass and radius 1. 3 <M_ p< 2. 3 M_⊕, R_ p= 1. 4 ^+ 0. 3 _- 0. 2 R_⊕, having today an intrinsic dynamo with a dipole moment M_ dip= 0. 32 ^× 2. 3 _ 2. 9 M_ dip,⊕.

Their <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> shortens dramatically as the stars shrink (due to conservation of angular momentum); observed rotational periods of neutron stars range from about 1.5 milliseconds (over 600 revolutions per second) to several seconds. When these rapidly rotating stars' magnetic poles are aligned with the Earth, we detect a pulse of radiation each revolution. Such neutron stars are called pulsars, and were the first neutron stars to be discovered.

25|$|Because the Earth's tides are {{ultimately}} due to gravitational {{interaction with the}} Moon and Sun and the Earth's rotation, tidal power is practically inexhaustible and classified as a renewable energy resource. Movement of tides causes a loss of mechanical energy in the Earth–Moon system: this {{is a result of}} pumping of water through natural restrictions around coastlines and consequent viscous dissipation at the seabed and in turbulence. This loss of energy has caused the rotation of the Earth to slow in the 4.5billion years since its formation. During the last 620million years the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> of the earth (length of a day) has increased from 21.9hours to 24hours; in this period the Earth has lost 17% of its rotational energy.

This phenomenon is investigated by numerical solutions of partial differential equations that couple local nonlinear kinetics and diffusive transport of the chemotactic signal. In the interface of both regions a complex twisted scroll wave is formed that reduces the wave frequency in the prespore zone.

40|$|The {{main goal}} of the {{research}} is to carry on an extensive study of physical properties (colors and variability) of asteroids in the 1 to 10 km diameter range and of cometary cores, {{with the use of}} a charge coupled device (CCD) camera, PMT photometer, or both. Particular attention is paid to asteroids being observed by radar because the greatest gain is found from the combination of radar results with the data obtained by optical techniques. To satisfy the goal, 100 nights/year have been scheduled on the 2. 3 m and 1. 5 m telescopes. During the past 2 years small asteroids were observed. Out of 22 asteroids for which <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> could be precisely measured, 17 have <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> less than 5 hours.

Taxonomic observations lead to a conclusion that Apollo, Amor, and Aten asteroids represent a variety of classes and are not predominantly of class S. Apollo asteroid 3361 Orpheus was found to belong to the rare class V. In collaboration with Dr A. Harris of JPL the opposition effect was studied for 30 Urania and 64 Angelina.

60|$|Thus taking as our {{standard}} of comparison the Earth with its one moon, {{we see that}} Mercury, in which the centrifugal force is relatively less, has no moon. Mars, {{in which it is}} relatively much greater, has two moons. Jupiter, in which it is far greater, has four moons. Uranus, in which it is greater still, has certainly four, and more if Herschel was right. Saturn, in which it is the greatest, being nearly one-sixth of gravity, has, including his rings, eleven attendants. The only instance in which there is nonconformity with observation, is that of Venus. Here it appears that the centrifugal force is relatively greater than in the Earth; and, according to the hypothesis, Venus ought to have a satellite. Respecting this anomaly several remarks are to be made. Without putting any faith in the alleged discovery of a satellite of Venus (repeated at intervals by five different observers), it may yet be contended that as the satellites of Mars eluded observation up to 1877, a satellite of Venus may have eluded observation up to the present time. Merely naming this as possible, but not probable, a consideration of more weight is that the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>rotation</b> of Venus is but indefinitely fixed, and that a small diminution in the estimated angular velocity of her equator would bring the result into congruity with the hypothesis. Further, it may be remarked that not exact, but only general, congruity is to be expected; since the process of condensation of each planet from nebulous matter can scarcely be expected to have gone on with absolute uniformity: the angular velocities of the superposed strata of nebulous matter probably differed from one another in degrees unlike in each case; and such differences would affect the satellite-forming tendency. But without making much of these possible explanations of the discrepancy, the correspondence between inference and fact which we find in so many planets, may be held to afford strong support to the Nebular Hypothesis.|$|E
