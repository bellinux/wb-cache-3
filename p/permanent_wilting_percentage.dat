40|$|Information about {{effects of}} {{different}} land use systems on soil physico-chemical properties {{is crucial for}} best land management practices. This study was, therefore, conducted to evaluate the same on Nitosols of Achefer District, Northwestern Ethiopia. The landuse systems studied included grassland, cultivated land, plantation forest and natural forest. The research was superimposed on land use systems that were located nearby on similar soil, contour line and slope classes. Undisturbed core and disturbed composite soil samples were collected randomly from two sites with three replications for each landuse system at two varying depths (0 - 15 cm and 15 - 30 cm). The undisturbed soil samples were analysed for bulk density, particle density, porosity and moisture content at different pressures; while the composite soil samples were analyzed for pH, organic carbon, total N and available P. Results of the study indicated that the lowest bulk and particle densities, the highest total porosity, and higher moisture content at both field capacity and <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> <b>percentage</b> were found under natural forest land use system. In contrast, the highest bulk and particle densities, the lowest total porosity and lower water contents at both field capacity and <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> <b>percentage</b> were obtained under the cultivated landuse system. Soil pH was moderately acidic under all landuse systems. The lowest organic carbon, total N, and C:N ratio were recorded under cultivated land; whereas the highest values of the same parameters were found under natural forest. In all landuse systems, organic carbon and total N decreased with soil depth. The highest and lowest available P contents were recorded under natural forest and grassland, respectively. From {{the results of the}} study it was possible to conclude that conversion of forest lands to cultivated and grasslands had detrimental effects on the soil physico-chemical properties under subsistance farming systems of the study area. It is, therefore, recommended that appropriate and integrated land management options for different land use syetems are required to sustain agricultural productivity while protecting the environment...|$|E
40|$|Studies to {{determine}} the effect of various soil moisture regimes on the internal water balance and on the growth and yield of sugar cane were conducted in the Department of Agricultural Botany, D. P. College of Agriculture, Philippines from 1965 to 1967. Experiments were also conducted {{to determine}} a relationship between some physiological processes and plant growth as a result of moisture stress. The results showed that with an increase in soil moisture stress, growth based on stem height, leaf area, total number of leaves, length of internode and diameter of canes, dry weight of tops and yield based on total millable cana, per cent juice in cane and per cent sucrose content in the juice all decreased significantly optimum growth and yields were obtained at field capacity. The internal water balances in sugar cane, measured by relative turgidity was found to have more profound effect on plant growth rather than the degree of moisture stress in the soils This was concluded since the plants subjected to low atmospheric stress (low air tem perature) made a growth (based on stem and leaf area increment) which was almost independent of soil moisture between the range of field capacity and <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> <b>percentage.</b> This was further attributed to a favor able internal water balance maintained by plants under such conditions. When the relative turgidity in plants was changed from 90 to 80 per cent, the reduction in growth was largely attributed to a reduction in the relative activity of gibberellin-like substances. However, when the relative turgidity fell below 80 per cent, the reduction in growth was attributed to a loss of turgence subsequently inhibiting the net assimilation rate...|$|E

Significant interaction (p< 0. 01) between variety and moisture level were observed both in the glasshouse and in the field. Drought resistant genotypes showed high relative water content in stress environment as compared to susceptible ones.

40|$|This {{data set}} {{contains}} measurements of soil hydraulic properties, i. e. field capacity and <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> point. Data presented here {{is from the}} Main Experiment plots of a large grassland biodiversity experiment (the Jena Experiment; see further details below). In the main experiment, 82 grassland plots of 20 x 20 m were established {{from a pool of}} 60 species belonging to four functional groups (grasses, legumes, tall and small herbs). In May 2002, varying numbers of plant species from this species pool were sown into the plots to create a gradient of plant species richness (1, 2, 4, 8, 16 and 60 species) and functional richness (1, 2, 3, 4 functional groups). Plots were maintained in general by bi-annual weeding and mowing. Since 2010, plot size was reduced to 5 x 6 m and plots were weeded three times per year. Field capacity and <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> point at 10, 20 and 30 cm depth were derived from soil texture data of 2002 and bulk density 2006 by using pedotransfer functions. Soil texture was determined from undisturbed soil cores at 27 locations distributed throughout the experimental site in spring 2002 before plot establishment. Soil cores were taken to 100 cm depth and separated in depth increments with a resolution of ten cm from ground level to 40 cm depth and 20 cm from 40 cm to 100 cm depth. The bulk material was passed through a sieve with 2 mm mesh size and only fine soil was used for the investigation of soil texture. Grain size fractions according to DIN 19683 - 2 for every sample were then determined at the laboratory for geoecology of Jena University by a combined sieve and hydrometer analysis. Values for each plot were interpolated by ordinary kriging and the interpolated values were used for the investigation of field capacity and <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> point. Soil bulk density was determined from undisturbed soil samples to a depth of 30 cm. Three soil cores per plot were taken with a split tube sampler with an inner diameter of 4. 8 cm and separated in depth increments of five cm. The bulk material was passed through a sieve with 2 mm mesh size, dried to constant weight at 40 °C and subsequently weighed to calculate the density. The determination of field capacity and <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> point was based on pedotransfer functions described in Zacharias and Wessolek (2007). Applied was equation four (where sand content 66. 5 %) to derive the parameters of the water retention curve.

For 30 cm, bulk density was assumed to be equal to the one measured at 25 - 30 cm. Water contents at field capacity and <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> point were obtained using the van Genuchte Eq (e. g. eq 1 in Zacharias and Wessolek), and calculating water contents at - 330 cm matric potential (field capacity, 1 / 3 of atmospheric pressure) and at - 15000 cm...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the use of the pedostructure soil concept to determine the available water within soil. Specifically, the hydro-structural behavior of the soil in the pedostructure is compared to standard methods of determining field capacity and <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> point. The standard methods evaluated are: the FAO texture estimate, Saxon and Rawls? pedotransfer functions, and the pressure plate method. Additionally, there are two pedostructure methods that are assessed: the water retention curve (WRC) and the soil shrinkage curve (ShC) methods. Three different types of soils were used: 1) Loamy Fine Sand: Undisturbed cores: Millican, Texas, USA; 2) Silty Loam: Reconstituted cores: Versailles soil, France; and 3) Silty clay loam: Reconstituted cores, Rodah Soils, Qatar. The results showed that the water contents at specific water potentials, empirically suggested values, of 330 hPa and 15, 000 hPa for estimating the field capacity and <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> point, respectively the three standards methods and the pedostructure WRC method were in relative agreement. On the other hand, the ShC method used transition characteristic points in the shrinkage curve to estimate the field capacity and <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> point and was significantly higher. For example, in the fine sandy loam Ap horizon analyzed in this study, the filed capacity estimates by standard and WRC methods ranged from 0. 073 to 0. 150 m^ 3 H 2 O/m^ 3 Soil while the ShC method estimate was 0. 342 m^ 3 H 2) /m^ 3 Soil. Overall, it is evident that the process of extracting parameters from the ShC that correlate to the field capacity point of a soil always results in a larger amount of available water. One potential reason for the higher values could be in the selection of the transition point that represents the field capacity. Therefore, it is suggested to have further research to identify the most suitable characteristic point on the shrinkage curve to represent the field capacity value...|$|R

Although these parameters can be measured directly, their measurement is difficult and expensive. Pedotransfer functions (PTFs) provide an alternative by estimating soil parameters from more readily available soil data. In this investigation, 70 soil samples were collected from different horizons of 15 soil profiles located in the Ziaran region, Qazvin province, Iran. The data set was divided into two subsets for calibration (80 %) and testing (20 %) of the models and their normality were tested by Kolmogorov-Smirnov method. Both multivariate regression and artificial neural network (ANN) techniques were employed to develop the appropriate PTFs for predicting soil parameters using easily measurable characteristics of clay, silt, O. C, S. P, B. D and CaCO 3. The performance of the multivariate regression and ANN models was evaluated using an independent test data set. In order to evaluate the models, {{root mean square error}} (RMSE) and R 2 were used. The comparison of RSME for two mentioned models showed that the ANN model gives better estimates of F. C and P.

This study was aimed at evaluating the effect of water stress on growth of three linseed cultivars and to establish the extent of drought tolerance in the three cultivars. A greenhouse pot experiment in a completely randomized design was conducted at Jomo Kenyatta University of Agriculture and Technology, Kenya. The pots were well watered until the fourth week when watering was completely withheld to a half of the pots (stressed) while the other half (well watered control) was maintained at 90  % field capacity. Destructive harvesting was done when the stressed pots were at 90, 70, 60, 50, 40  % field capacities and at <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> point.

40|$|Deep sowing (15 cm) on sands in the {{dry season}} is a {{practice}} used in post-rice sowing of legumes without irrigation, designed to increase moisture access for germination, growth and crops yield. However, with such deep sowing {{there can be a}} penalty for emergence and growth if there is abundant water stored in the upper soil profile during the growing season. Hence, {{there is a need to}} define the soil water regimes under which deep sowing is advantageous for different legumes. To investigate the adaptation of legume crop species to deep sowing, we studied their emergence, growth and yield on three deep soils (3 - 16 % clay) with shallow water tables during two years in northeast Thailand. At site 1 and 2, peanut, cowpea, mungbean and soybean were sown shallow (~ 5 cm) or deep (~ 15 cm). At site 3, only cowpea and peanut were shallow or deep sown. Shallow water tables maintained soil water content (0 - 15 cm) above <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> point throughout the growing season. Deep sowing of all legumes delayed emergence by 3 - 7 days at all locations. Shoot dry weight of legumes after deep sowing was mostly similar or lower than weight after shallow sowing. Yield and harvest index of legumes did not differ meaningfully among sowing depths. Therefore, deep sowing was not beneficial for dry season cropping without irrigation when there was a shallow water table and sufficient water for crop growth throughout soil profiles in the growing season. Taken together with previous studies, we conclude that shallow rather than deep sowing of legumes was preferred when the soil water content at 0 - 15 -cm depth remained higher than <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> point throughout the growing season due to shallow water table...|$|R
40|$|This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to investigate the combined effect of soil gel-conditioner (Aquasorb) addition to calcareous sandy soil (Typic Torripsammcnts) and irrigation water qualities under different water requirements. The soil gel-conditioner was added to the soil surface (0 - 0. 06 m) at the rates (C) : 0. 0, 0. 3, 0. 6 and 0. 9 % (on dry weight basis). Natural irrigation waters having different qualities(ECw) : 0. 45, 3. 10, and 6. 25 dS m- 1 were used at three irrigation levels (IL) : 40, 60, and 80 % of evaporation from free water surface (Ev). The effect of Ecw on the relative water absorption capacity (RWAC) was determined. The gravimetric soil water content a field capacity (WFC), and at <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> point (Wpw) were determined and the available water (WAW) was calculated. Soil expansion and bulk density (Db) were also determined. In addition, the volumetric soil water () and salinity (ECs; for extract of 1 soil: 2. 5 water) profiles were evaluated. 	The RWAC was exponentially decreased with increase of ECw. Although, the gravimetric soil water contents at field capacity, <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> point and available water were significantly increased with increase of C, they were significantly decreased with increase of ECw. These relationships were illustrated exponentially with r > 0. 910. Although the soil surface layer expansion was increased due to the increase of C, it was clearly decreased with increased of ECw. This expansion resulted in peculiar bulk densities for surface layer. The Db decreased as C increased, but the rate of decrease was reduced with increase of ECw. A linear relationship between Db, C and ECw was obtained with r = 0. 968. 	In general. {{it was found that the}} volumetric soil water content of sandy soil profiles increased with increase of C especially at the treated surface layer, and increased with increase of ECw.

40|$|Soil {{scientists}} and agronomists know that increases in {{soil organic matter}} change the way that soil and water interact. Soil high in organic matter develop stronger aggregation and soil structure resulting in increased porosity, water holding capacity, and infiltration rates. Changes in land use and climate alter soil organic matter and subsequently soil hydraulic properties. However, land surface and hydrology models generally use soil hydraulic properties based only on soil texture without information on soil organic matter. The goal for this project is to improve available soil information for hydrology modeling by adding organic matter content into prediction functions of soil hydraulic properties, therefore making more representative predictions of how soils interact with water. Porosity, hydraulic conductivity and soil water contents at field capacity (?FC) and <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> point (?WP) were estimated using multiple linear regression that incorporate measurements of soil texture and organic matter for A (surface) horizons. Data on soils in the National Cooperative Soil Characterization Database were used to create these functions for Texas and neighboring states and then compared to existing pedotransfer functions. The results agree with the literature that soil organic matter is a statistically significant component, along with texture, in predicting porosity, field capacity, and <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> point; however, the change in predicted values is not functionally different except when predicting porosity. Because newly predicted porosity values were different, estimates of saturated hydraulic conductivity were also worth recalculating using organic matter. The results are attributed to the way field capacity is measured on soil clods rather than soil volumes that include inter-pedal pores. Though we know that soil organic matter has a strong link to soil structure, the databases available do not contain the type of information needed to fully represent the relationship between soil organic matter, soil structure, and soil water relations...|$|R
40|$|A simple 'inter-particle contact heat transfer' {{model for}} {{predicting}} effective thermal conductivity of soils at moderate temperatures (0 - 30 degreesC) {{has been extended}} up to 90 degreesC. The extended model accounts for latent heat transport by water vapour diffusion in soil air above the <b>permanent</b> <b>wilting</b> point; below that point, the soil thermal conductivity is approximated by linear interpolation without latent heat effect. By and large the best results are obtained when the latent heat is used only in the 'self consistent approximation' model with an overall {{root mean square error}} of 35 % for all soils under consideration or 26 % when excluding volcanic soils. This option can also be applied to moderate temperatures at which the enhanced heat transfer is negligibly small. Copyright (C) 2005 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} an organic {{commercial}} super gel (containing 24. 5 % humic acids and 3. 8 % polysaccharides) at rates ranging from 0 to 1. 6 % on water retention and modulus of rupture (MOR) of two and four soil samples, respectively were investigated. The amount of water retention by a loamy sand sample at each suction over the whole range (10 - 1500 kPa) significantly increased with increase of Jalma rate.
