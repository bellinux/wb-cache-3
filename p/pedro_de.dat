5|$|From 1530, {{the colonists}} became the arbiters of power, {{installing}} and deposing governors. Spanish government in Honduras was riven by factionalism. As {{a response to}} the growing anarchy, the colonists requested that <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado intervene. Alvarado arrived in 1536, {{put an end to the}} political infighting, and gained an important victory over Sicumba, a Maya leader in the Ulúa valley. Alvarado founded two towns that later became important, San <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Puerto Caballos (later to become San Pedro Sula) and Gracias a Dios.|$|E
5|$|In 1539, {{the fledgling}} colonial town of Villa de Señor San <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Puerto Caballos was moved three leagues {{to the south}} and was given the new name of San <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Puerto Caballos. At this time it {{consisted}} of just twelve palm-thatched houses imitating the native style of construction; in 1541 it had 35 Spanish residents. Montejo also moved Santa María de Comayagua to a more suitable location and assigned 35 conquistadors as its citizens. Rich silver deposits were soon found there.|$|E
5|$|The Annals of the Cakchiquels, an {{indigenous}} document from the Guatemalan Highlands, contains {{an account of}} <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado's initial incursion into El Salvador. <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado wrote four letters to Hernán Cortés describing his conquest of Guatemala and El Salvador, of which two survive. One of these relates his expedition into El Salvador, {{with an eye to}} military detail. It is of particular use in its description of tactics and weaponry, although it is disdainful of the native culture.|$|E

5|$|The conquistadors {{were all}} volunteers, the {{majority}} of whom did not receive a fixed salary but instead {{a portion of the}} spoils of victory, in the form of precious metals, land grants and provision of native labour. Many of the Spanish were already experienced soldiers who had previously campaigned in Europe. The initial incursion into Guatemala was led by <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado, who earned the military title of Adelantado in 1527; he answered to the Spanish crown via Hernán Cortés in Mexico. Other early conquistadors included <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado's brothers Gómez de Alvarado, Jorge de Alvarado and Gonzalo de Alvarado y Contreras; and his cousins Gonzalo de Alvarado y Chávez, Hernando de Alvarado and Diego de Alvarado. <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Portocarrero was a nobleman who joined the initial invasion. Bernal Díaz del Castillo was a petty nobleman who accompanied Hernán Cortés when he crossed the northern lowlands, and <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado on his invasion of the highlands. In addition to Spaniards, the invasion force probably included dozens of armed African slaves and freemen.|$|E

5|$|After {{defeating}} Sicumba, Alvarado led {{his army}} to the Indian village of Choloma, {{in the general}} region of Puerto de Caballos. On 27 June 1536, <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado founded a Spanish town beside the Indian settlement, {{with the name of}} Villa de Señor San <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Puerto Caballos (modern San Pedro Sula). The new town had 35 Spanish citizens, and Alvarado allocated 200 of his slaves to help build the new town and work the surrounding fields. He sent out expeditions into outlying regions to secure the new town, extend the area of Spanish domination, and commandeer supplies. Alvarado annulled all encomienda rights established in the area under Cerezeda, and reassigned the villages to the citizens of San Pedro.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} defend against further rival Spanish incursions from the southeast, <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado {{established}} the Spanish town of San Miguel, which he also used as a base of operations for attacks against the Lenca. A Spanish force commanded by Luis de Moscoso Alvarado, consisting of about 120 Spanish cavalry, accompanied by infantry and Indian auxiliaries, crossed the Lempa River and founded San Miguel on 21 November 1530. In addition to the Spanish colonists, the settlement included Mexica and Tlaxcalan allies, among other Indian auxiliaries. Most of the Spanish population of San Miguel abandoned El Salvador with <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado when he set out on his expedition to Peru.|$|E
5|$|In {{the half}} century {{preceding}} {{the arrival of}} the Spanish, the Kaqchikel were frequently at war with the Pipil of Izcuintepeque (modern Escuintla). By March 1524 the K'iche had been defeated, followed by a Spanish alliance with the Kaqchikel in April of the same year. On 8 May 1524, soon after his arrival in Iximche and immediately following his subsequent conquest of the Tz'utujil around Lake Atitlán, <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado continued southwards to the Pacific coastal plain with an army numbering approximately 6000, where he defeated the Pipil of Panacal or Panacaltepeque (called Panatacat in the Annals of the Kaqchikels) near Izcuintepeque on 9 May. Alvarado described the terrain approaching the town as very difficult, covered with dense vegetation and swampland that made the use of cavalry impossible; instead he sent men with crossbows ahead. The Pipil withdrew their scouts because of the heavy rain, believing that the Spanish and their allies {{would not be able to}} reach the town that day. However, <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado pressed ahead and when the Spanish entered the town the defenders were completely unprepared, with the Pipil warriors indoors sheltering from the torrential rain. In the battle that ensued, the Spanish and their indigenous allies suffered minor losses but the Pipil were able to flee into the forest, sheltered from Spanish pursuit by the weather and the vegetation. <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado ordered the town to be burnt and sent messengers to the Pipil lords demanding their surrender, otherwise he would lay waste to their lands. According to Alvarado's letter to Cortés, the Pipil came back to the town and submitted to him, accepting the king of Spain as their overlord. The Spanish force camped in the captured town for eight days. A few years later, in 1529, <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado was accused of using excessive brutality in his conquest of Izcuintepeque, amongst other atrocities.|$|E

5|$|The first {{campaign}} against the native inhabitants was undertaken in 1524 by <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado. Alvarado launched his expedition against the Pipil province of Cuscatlan from the Guatemalan Highlands, but by July 1524 he had retreated back to Guatemala. Gonzalo de Alvarado founded San Salvador the following year, but it was eradicated by a native attack in 1526, during a general uprising that spread across the region. <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado returned to campaign in El Salvador in 1526 and 1528, and in the latter year, Diego de Alvarado reestablished San Salvador and issued encomiendas to his supporters. In 1528, the uprising finally ended when the Spanish stormed the native stronghold at the Peñol de Cinacantan.|$|E
5|$|The {{following}} day the Spanish entered Tecpan Atitlan but found it deserted. <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado camped in {{the centre of}} the city and sent out scouts to find the enemy.

The Tz'utujil leaders responded by surrendering to <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado and swearing loyalty to Spain, at which point Alvarado considered them pacified and returned to Iximche. Three days after <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado returned to Iximche, the lords of the Tz'utujil arrived there to pledge their loyalty and offer tribute to the conquistadors. A short time afterwards a number of lords arrived from the Pacific lowlands to swear allegiance to the king of Spain, although Alvarado did not name them in his letters; they confirmed Kaqchikel reports that further out on the Pacific plain was the kingdom called Izcuintepeque in Nahuatl, or Panatacat in Kaqchikel, whose inhabitants were warlike and hostile towards their neighbours.|$|E
5|$|The sources {{describing}} the Spanish conquest of Guatemala include those {{written by the}} Spanish themselves, among them two letters written by conquistador <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado in 1524, {{describing the}} initial campaign to subjugate the Guatemalan Highlands.

Bernal Díaz del Castillo wrote a lengthy account of the conquest of Mexico and neighbouring regions, the Historia verdadera de la conquista de la Nueva España ("True History of the Conquest of New Spain"); his account of the conquest of Guatemala generally agrees with that of the Alvarados. He also included his own description of Cortes' expedition, and an account of the conquest of the Chiapas highlands. Conquistador Diego Godoy accompanied Luis Marín on his reconnaissance of Chiapas, and wrote an account of the battle against the inhabitants of Chamula. Hernán Cortés described his expedition to Honduras in the fifth letter of his Cartas de Relación. Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas wrote a highly critical account of the Spanish conquest of the Americas and included accounts of some incidents in Guatemala.|$|E

5|$|The sources {{describing}} the Spanish conquest of Guatemala include those {{written by the}} Spanish themselves, among them two of four letters written by conquistador <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado to Hernán Cortés in 1524, {{describing the}} initial campaign to subjugate the Guatemalan Highlands. These letters were despatched to Tenochtitlan, addressed to Cortés but with a royal audience in mind; two of these letters are now lost. Gonzalo de Alvarado y Chávez was <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado's cousin; he accompanied him on his first campaign in Guatemala and in 1525 he became the chief constable of Santiago de los Caballeros de Guatemala, the newly founded Spanish capital.

His account was finished around 1568, some 40 years after the campaigns it describes. Hernán Cortés described his expedition to Honduras in the fifth letter of his Cartas de Relación, in which he details his crossing of what is now Guatemala's Petén Department. Dominican friar Bartolomé de las Casas wrote a highly critical account of the Spanish conquest of the Americas and included accounts of some incidents in Guatemala.

5|$|After two Kaqchikel {{messengers}} sent by <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado {{were killed}} by the Tz'utujil, the conquistadors and their Kaqchikel allies marched against the Tz'utujil. <b>Pedro</b> <b>de</b> Alvarado led 60 cavalry, 150 Spanish infantry and an unspecified number of Kaqchikel warriors. The Spanish and their allies arrived at the lakeshore after a day's march, and Alvarado rode ahead with 30 cavalry along the lake shore until he engaged a hostile Tz'utujil force, which was broken by the Spanish charge. The survivors were pursued across a causeway to an island on foot before the inhabitants could break the bridges. The rest of Alvarado's army soon arrived and they successfully stormed the island. The surviving Tz'utujil fled into the lake and swam to safety. The Spanish could not pursue them because 300 canoes sent by the Kaqchikels had not yet arrived. This battle took place on 18 April.|$|E
