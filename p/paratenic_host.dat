The oligochaete or <b>paratenic</b> <b>host</b> is then eaten by a definitive host, wherein juveniles penetrate intestinal lining and migrate to the liver. After maturing for approximately 50 days, the juveniles then migrate to the kidneys (typically the right kidney). Upon maturation, D. renale can survive for five years.|$|E

50|$|In recent years, the {{parasite}} {{has been shown}} to be proliferating at an alarming rate due to modern food consumption trends and global transportation of food products. Scientists are calling for a more thorough study of the epidemiology of A. cantonensis, stricter food safety policies, and the increase of knowledge on how to properly consume products commonly infested by {{the parasite}} such as snails and slugs that act as intermediate hosts or those that act as <b>paratenic</b> <b>hosts</b> such as fish, frogs, or freshwater prawns. Food items that can be contaminated by the mucus excretions of intermediate or <b>paratenic</b> <b>hosts</b> such snails and slugs or by the feces of rats that act as definitive hosts can lead to infection of A. cantonensis. The most common route of infection of A. cantonesis in humans is by ingestion of either intermediate or <b>paratenic</b> <b>hosts</b> of the larvae. Unwashed fruits and vegetables, especially romaine lettuce can be contaminated with snail and slug mucus or can result in accidental ingestion of these intermediate and <b>paratenic</b> <b>hosts.</b> These items need to be properly washed and handled to prevent accidental ingestion of A. cantonensis larvae itself or the larvae containing hosts. The best mechanism of prevention of A. cantonesis outbreak is to institute an aggressive control of snail and slug population, proper cooking of intermediate and <b>paratenic</b> <b>hosts</b> such as fish, freshwater prawn, frogs, mollusks and snails along with proper food handling techniques. The common prevention techniques for diarrheal illness is very effective in preventing A. cantonensis infection.|$|R
50|$|As <b>paratenic</b> <b>hosts,</b> {{a number}} of vertebrates, {{including}} humans, and some invertebrates can become infected. Humans are infected, like other <b>paratenic</b> <b>hosts,</b> by ingestion of embryonated T. canis eggs. The disease (called Toxocariasis) caused by migrating T. canis larvae (toxocariasis) results in two syndromes: visceralis larva migrans and ocularis larva migrans.Owing to transmission of the infection from the mother to her puppies, preventive anthelmintic treatment of newborn puppies is strongly recommended. Several antihelmintic drugs are effective against adult worms, for example pyrantel, fenbendazole, selamectin.|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{zoonotic}} roundworms Toxocara canis and T. cati are {{not only}} present worldwide in their definitive hosts; they also frequently occur in other animal species, including humans. In those so-called <b>paratenic</b> <b>hosts,</b> the larvae do not develop into the adult stage, but rather migrate throughout the somatic tissue and persist as infectious L 3 stage for extensive periods. Those arrested larvae may lead to severe inflammatory reactions and consequently {{to a wide range}} of pathological and clinical manifestations. However, the infected <b>paratenic</b> <b>hosts</b> also constitute a potential source of infection for the definitive hosts or humans who may also function as <b>paratenic</b> <b>hosts.</b> In the present review, current knowledge of larval migration in a variety of possible <b>paratenic</b> <b>hosts</b> is summarized including variations of migration routes and susceptibilities. Furthermore, information about the clinical and pathological changes for the presented species and possible consequences of the somatic migration of larvae, i. e. the resulting tissue damage as well as adverse host reactions to arrested larvae are reviewed. There are still many questions unanswered regarding larval behaviour in hosts other than their definitive host. Therefore, it is of great importance to continue further elaboration on the biology of Toxocara spp. to prevent further spreading of larvae in both the paratenic and the definitive host...|$|R
50|$|This {{condition}} {{is caused by}} the infection of Diphyllobothrium latum (also known as the “broad tapeworm” or “fish tapeworm”) and related species. Humans become infected by eating raw, undercooked, or marinated fish acting as a second intermediate or <b>paratenic</b> <b>host</b> harboring metacestodes or plerocercoid larvae.|$|E
50|$|An adult worm {{lives and}} reproduces in the {{intestine}} of its definitive host, the raccoon. The female worm can produce between 115,000-179,000 eggs per day. Eggs are excreted along with feces, and become infective {{in the soil}} after 2-4 weeks. If ingested by another raccoon, the life cycle repeats. However, if these eggs are ingested by a <b>paratenic</b> <b>host</b> (small mammals, birds) the larvae of B. procyonis will penetrate the gut wall of the host and migrate into tissues. Larvae tend to migrate to the brain, cause damage, and affect the behaviour of the intermediate host, making it an easier prey for raccoons. Reproduction does not occur in these paratenic hosts; however, if a raccoon preys on an infected <b>paratenic</b> <b>host,</b> the encysted larvae can become adults in the raccoon and the cycle resumes.|$|E
5000|$|Ingestion — the {{parasite}} is transmitted by the ingestion of the infected invertebrate host by the vertebrate host. The {{mode of transmission}} may even involve a <b>paratenic</b> <b>host.</b> The next definitive host in the life cycle is infected exclusively through blood feeding. Examples include the genera Karyolysus, Hemolivia and Hepatozoon.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. Aquatic snails, Pila ampullacea and Pomacea canaliculata were {{experimentally}} {{found to}} be suitable <b>paratenic</b> <b>hosts</b> for advanced third-stage larvae (L 3) of the nema-tode Gnathostoma spinigerum, the causative parasite of gnathostomiasis in humans. G. spinigerum (L 3) were {{found to be}} encapsulated in the tissue of the snail’s foot and its internal organs. The infection, intensity and survival of third-stage larvae of G. spinigerum in both species of aquatic snails are described. This is the first evidence to reveal that not only vertebrates but also invertebrates (snails) can serve as <b>paratenic</b> <b>hosts</b> to this parasite. Aquatic snails are one of several sources of human gnathosto-miasis in Thailand. experimentally as the first intermediate host. Forty-eight species of vertebrates [fish (20 species), amphibians (2), reptiles (11), avians (11) and mammals (4) ] serve naturally as sec-ond intermediate (and/or <b>paratenic)</b> <b>hosts</b> of the worm (Rojekittikhun, 2002). Second in-termediate <b>hosts</b> and <b>paratenic</b> <b>hosts,</b> contain-ing advanced third-stage larvae (L 3) are the primary sources of infection for the defini-tive host. Humans are an accidental host, who may become infected by eating undercooked fish, poultry, amphibians or reptiles that har-bor the infective larva of G. spinigerum. Each year several hundred suspected cases of gnathostomiasis come to the Gna-thostomiasis clinic, Hospital for Tropical Diseases, Faculty of Tropical Medicine...|$|R

50|$|In parasitology, {{the term}} paratenic {{describes}} a host {{that is not}} necessary {{for the development of}} a particular species of parasite, but nonetheless may happen to serve to maintain the life cycle of that parasite. In contrast to its development in a secondary host, a parasite in a <b>paratenic</b> <b>host</b> does not undergo any changes into the following stages of its development.|$|E
5000|$|Histomoniasis (or histomonosis), {{also known}} as {{blackhead}} disease, is a commercially important disease of poultry, particularly of chickens and turkeys, due to parasitic infection of a protozoan, Histomonas meleagridis. The protozoan is transmitted to the bird by the nematode parasite Heterakis gallinarum. H. meleagridis resides within the eggs of H. gallinarum, so birds ingest the parasites along with contaminated soil or food. Earthworms can also act as a <b>paratenic</b> <b>host.</b>|$|E
50|$|After introduction, the tubenose goby in the Morava River have 13 {{parasite}} species; the trematodes, such as Apatemon cobitidis proterorhini, Diplostomum spathaceum, Tylodelphys clavata, {{were most}} numerous in the parasite community. In the Great Lakes the introduced tubenose goby was infected with 6 parasite species, but the infestation with every particular species was very low. It is included as <b>paratenic</b> <b>host</b> {{to the life}} cycle of the parasite of turtles, the nematode Spiroxys contortus.|$|E
50|$|Humans {{can acquire}} the {{parasite}} by ingesting an infected copepod from drinking contaminated water or by eating infected secondary definitive hosts. Therefore, humans {{can act as}} 2nd intermediate <b>hosts</b> or <b>paratenic</b> <b>hosts.</b>|$|R
40|$|To {{complete}} their life cycle, gordiids {{must make a}} transition from aquatic to terrestrial environments. However, epibenthic aquatic larvae and their terrestrial definitive hosts do not overlap in habitat. This has led many investigators to suggest that infections are acquired through the ingestion of insects, which become infected as aquatic larvae with gordiid cysts and subsequently carry gordiids to land. This proposed life cycle was experimentally tested using three common American species of gordiids: Gordius robustus, Paragordius varius, and Chordodes morgani. Cysts of all three species survived the metamorphosis of Tanytarsus sp., a midge. Subsequent infection trials of definitive hosts with cysts from imagos show that cysts surviving the metamorphosis of insects remained viable and free of host internal defense reaction. Data from naturally infected mayflies, Callibaetus sp., show that encystment and survival of gordiids within aquatic insects occur in nature. Paratenesis between <b>paratenic</b> <b>hosts</b> was also shown to be possible in these three species. This latter finding appears to indicate that cysts formed in spurious <b>paratenic</b> <b>hosts</b> may not be lost but may eventually transfer to normal <b>paratenic</b> <b>hosts...</b>|$|R

50|$|Alaria {{americana}} {{may serve}} as an example: the so-called mesocercarial stages of this parasite reside in tadpoles, which are rarely eaten by the definitive canine host. The tadpoles are more frequently preyed on by snakes, in which the mesocercariae may not undergo further development. However, the parasites may accumulate in the snake <b>paratenic</b> <b>host</b> and infect the definitive host once the snake is consumed by a canid. The Skrjabingylus nasicola nematode is another example, with slugs as the intermediate hosts, shrews and rodents as the paratenic hosts, and mustelids as the definitive hosts.|$|E
50|$|Skrjabingylus nasicola has {{a complex}} lifecycle. Larvae {{passed in the}} faeces of {{infected}} mustelids are ingested by slugs such as Deroceras reticulatum. Mustelids do not usually eat molluscs, but the slugs may be eaten by a mammalian <b>paratenic</b> <b>host</b> such as Apodemus sp. or Clethrionomys glareolus. No developmental stages take place in this host and the nematode rests in the glandular zones in the head or possibly in the muscle or connective tissue. Further development takes place when this host is eaten by a mustelid and the parasite moves into its nasal tissues.|$|E
