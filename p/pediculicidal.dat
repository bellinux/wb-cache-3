40|$|ABSTRACT: Brine shrimp {{lethality}} test as {{a biological}} {{model for the}} preliminary selection of <b>pediculicidal</b> components from a natural source. In order to achieve a good correlation between <b>pediculicidal</b> activity and brine shrimp lethality (BSL) test, several <b>pediculicidal</b> substances and active essential oils were tested in BSL test, with the purpose to use the latter as convenient preliminary protocol for <b>pediculicidal</b> activity. Benzyl benzoate, deltametrine and essential oil of Eucalyptus were purchased and clove essential oil obtained by hydrodistillation, besides essential oils, chloroform extracts from Duguetia furfuracea were also submitted to BSL test. All of them were carried out with same protocol described to <b>pediculicidal</b> assay found in the literature, i. e, flask tests were examined every five minutes {{in the first half}} hour and then every ten minutes until all the naupli were dead or no movements were observed (knockdown). During the BSL test, it was possible to observe the effect of a particular lethal dose or only a knockdown in the arthropod, as occurred in the test with lice. The results of the BSL test for essential oils and other active substances are essentially in agreement with those described in literature for <b>pediculicidal</b> activity. Extracts and essential oil obtained from aerial parts of D. furfuracea did not present activity, but the essential oil from underground stem bark was active. α-asarone ha...|$|E
40|$|Aim: To test a {{combined}} neem oil 6 % w/w and eucalyptus oil 16 % w/w lotion for the whole-of-life cycle treatment of human head lice (Pediculus humanus var. capitis) infestation. Method: Preliminary formulations of dilutions of neem and eucalyptus oils in isopropanol were tested for <b>pediculicidal</b> and ovicidal efficacies against Pediculus humanus var. capitis. This trial informed {{the development of}} a stable formulation consisting of neem oil 6 % w/w and eucalyptus oil 16 % w/w in a hydrophobic carrier (mixture of lanolin and silicones), which was also tested in vitro for <b>pediculicidal</b> and ovicidal efficacies against Pediculus humanus var. capitis. The lotion was then tested in vivo (clinical study) in volunteer Thai female students. At the conclusion of the in vivo study, participants and their parents/guardians completed a questionnaire pertaining to their perceptions and acceptance of the treatment. Results: Initial in vitro testing demonstrated <b>pediculicidal</b> and ovicidal efficacies of 96 % and 100 %, respectively. The clinical study involving 45 volunteer Thai female students aged 7 to 12 years, with 2 applications of the lotion on the scalp and hair 1 week apart, showed significant in vivo activity. <b>Pediculicidal</b> efficacies of 93 % and 97 % and ovicidal efficacies of 80 % and 100 % were measured 2 days after the first and second application of the lotion. Participants and their parents/ guardians indicated strong acceptance of the formulation. Conclusion: The combined neem oil 6 % w/w and eucalyptus oil 16 % w/w lotion demonstrated high <b>pediculicidal</b> and ovicidal efficacy for Pediculus humanus var. capitis infestation...|$|E
40|$|Anecdotal {{reports have}} {{suggested}} that reduced efficacy of pediculicides against Pediculus humanus capitis {{could be related to}} resistance to treatments. Ovicidal and <b>pediculicidal</b> activities of 0. 5 % malathion and 0. 3 % d-phenothrin lotions ‘were tested in an experimental model of P humanus capitis grown on rabbits to ensure that the two treatments were pharmacologically equipotent. We then did a randomised controlled trial in which the lotions were administered to 193 P humanus capitisinfested schoolchildren (malathion, 95; d-phenothrin, 98). Success rate was defined as the absence of both live lice and viable nits. Before treatment, live lice were collected and subjected to a <b>pediculicidal</b> test. Pharmacological tests showed 100 % killing of the rabbit-grown nits and lice after exposure to both pediculicides. On day 1 of the controlled trial, the success rate was 92 % in the malathion group (95 % CI, 0 - 86 - 0. 97) and 40 % in the d-phenothrin group (0. 30 - 0. 49) (pc 0. 0001); on day 7, it was 95 % in the malathion group (0. 90 - 0 - 99) and 39 % in the d-phenothrin group (0 - 29 - 0. 48, p<O. OOOl). Malathion was also significantly more active in the <b>pediculicidal</b> tests compared to d-phenothrin and control.

40|$|Head lice are endemic worldwide. Resistance to {{permethrin}} and {{doubts about}} the safety of pesticides promoted the use of physical therapies (wet-combing, dry-on suffocation). The aim of our study was to test the <b>pediculicidal</b> and ovicidal effects of one application of a silicon-oil complex composed of dimethiconol and castor oil. The study was a prospective cohort of 108 infested patients (11 males, 97 females; 58 children, 50 adults), in Sri-Lanka. <b>Pediculicidal</b> efficacy was evaluated as the percentage of patients free of live lice one hour after the application of the treatment and at day 1 (wet combing). Ovicidal efficacy was calculated as the proportion of subjects without larval stages at days 1 and 7 among subjects followed up all over the study. In normal conditions of use, in this open cohort, a <b>pediculicidal</b> effect of a dimethiconolcastor- oil lotion was shown one hour after application in 99 / 108 (91. 7 %) treated subjects and at day 1 in 86 / 99 (87 %) subjects and an ovicidal effect at day 7 in 79 / 108 (73. 2 %) treated subjects.

40|$|Background Essential oil {{components}} (EOCs) are molecules with interesting {{application in}} pest control, {{these have been}} evaluated against different insect pest from more than 100 years, but their practical use is rather limited. Thus, the enhancement of their bioavailability and manageability due to their dispersion in water can open new perspective for the preparation of formulations for the control of insect pest. In this work, we studied the encapsulation of different monoterpenes in a poloxamer shell in order to prepare aqueous formulations {{that can be used}} for the development of platforms used in pest control. Methods Micellar systems containing a 5 wt% of poloxamer 407 and 1. 25 wt% of the different monoterpenes were prepared. Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) experiments were carried out to characterize the dispersion of the EOCs in water. The <b>pediculicidal</b> activity of these micellar systems was tested on head lice using an ex vivo immersion test. Results The poloxamers allowed the dispersion of EOCs in water due to their encapsulation inside the hydrophobic core of the copolymer micelles. From this study, we concluded that it is possible to make stable micellar systems containing water (> 90 wt%), 1. 25 wt% of different monoterpenes and a highly safe polymer (5 wt% Poloxamer 407). These formulations were effective against head lice with mortality ranging from 30 to 60 %, being the most effective emulsions those containing linalool, 1, 8 -cineole, α-terpineol, thymol, eugenol, geraniol and nonyl alcohol which lead to mortalities above 50 %. Discussion Since these systems showed good <b>pediculicidal</b> activity and high physicochemical stability, they could be a new route for the green fabrication of biocompatible and biosustainable insecticide formulations...|$|E

40|$|Head louse infestation, or pediculosis capitis, {{caused by}} Pediculus humanus var. capitis, {{is a common}} health concern in {{pediatric}} age group.

Secondary bacterial infection with impetignization with cervical and occipital lymphadenopathy can complicate the clinical scenario with physician misdiagnosing pediculosis to a primary bacterial infection. Screening and treatment of all close contacts is necessary for an adequate management of pediculosis. Medical management of head louse infestation requires proper application of topical <b>pediculicidal</b> agents′, chiefly permethrin lotion and wet combing with a fine toothcomb. Severe cases with high parasitic load justify the use of either oral cotrimoxazole or Ivermectin. Other described technique involves a single application of hot air for 30 minutes.

Findings This proof of concept study in 41 people investigated dimeticone 4 % liquid gel, a product that is easier to apply than the lotion, applied for 15 minutes on two occasions a week apart. We found that head lice were eliminated from all participants following the first application of product. We did not find lice of any stage on any participant during four post treatment assessments and particularly, unlike other treatments, no young nymphs on days 1 and 6 prior to the second treatment, indicating ovicidal as well as <b>pediculicidal</b> activity.

A simple in vitro office test that requires no high tech services or expensive equipment is presented which has been already helpful to document effectiveness or recalcitrance to specific therapies. In the protocol, head lice are exposed to insecticides for similar durations and concentrations as the product dictates; thus, exposure imitates routine clinical usage of the specific product tested.

40|$|Objective: Due to {{the toxic}} nature and {{increasing}} resistance of <b>pediculicidal</b> {{agents in the}} treatment of head lice, a new, safe, effective treatment is needed. This study uses a silicone-based, Pre-Combing Conditioner to treat pediculosis and looks at its overall effectiveness and subject-ta-subject variability. Success is defined as the absence of live head lice at day 14, following two uses of the Pre-Combing Conditioner. Methods: Single blind, repeated measures study enrolling 59 subjects ages 2 to 18 years. Results: Fifty-eight of the subjects (98 %) completed the study. Primary efficacy, defined as number of live head lice on day 14, was 100 %. The percentage of subjects with live lice on day 7 was 14 %. The estimated number of nits before and after treatments did not change significantly. Conclusion: The Pre-Combing Conditioner is a safe, effective treatment for head lice. The fact that most or all nits remained after two treatments may be a misleading negative outcome of this study: the incubation period for the nit is 7 to 10 days.

No lice were found {{on any of the}} treated sheep despite careful inspection of at least 40 fleece partings per animal at 2, 6, 12 and 20 weeks after treatment. In the untreated sheep louse numbers increased from a mean (+/- SE) of 2. 4 (+/- 0. 7) per 10 cm fleece part at 2 weeks to 12. 3 (+/- 4. 2) per part at 20 weeks. Treatment of sheep with 6 months wool by jetting (high pressure spraying into the fleece) reduced louse numbers by 94 % in comparison to controls at two weeks after treatment with both 1 % and 2 % TTO formulations. At 6 and 12 weeks after treatment reductions were 94 % and 91 % respectively with the 1 % formulation and 78 % and 84 % respectively with the 2 % formulation. TTO treatment also appeared to reduce wool damage in infested sheep. Laboratory studies indicated that tea tree oil 'stripped' from solution with a progressive reduction in concentration as well as volume as more wool was dipped, indicating that reinforcement of active ingredient would be required to maintain effectiveness when large numbers of sheep are treated.

40|$|Ectoparasitosis {{treatment}} {{provides a}} rare {{example of the}} deliberate use of insecticides on human beings. As the bulk of medical insecticide is em-ployed against head lice, scabies lying second, most patients are children. Those prescribing insecticides may wish to {{understand some of the}} principles involved. Insecticide penetration Insecticides enter insects and ova in accordance with passive physical laws, without active metabolic intervention. 1 The outermost layer of insect cuticles is lipoid and uptake from <b>pediculicidal</b> formulations is controlled by the partition laws. Insecticide moves from higher concentrations, proportional to saturation, into cuticle waxes, where there is greater saturation deficit. The dose then moving on through the integument per unit area is described by the laws of diffusion, D=(cl-c 2) t k where c 1 and c 2 are the insecticide concentrations at the outer and inner boundaries of the integument and c 1 -c 2 the concentration gradient driving the diffusion. The dose is equally determined by t, the time of exposure. Twice the exposure doubles the dose. The constant k describes the particular cuticle involved. 2 Louse cuticles, having the lowest known lipid content of any insect group, 3 are comparatively effective barriers to insecticides, which are always highly lipophilic. Unless k is modified by suitable formulation, then either higher concentrations of insecticides or longer exposure times must be employed against lice than against other insects, and these will equally be experienced by patients. Concentration and time are all important as regards the lice, the actual quantity of insecticide present being irrelevant. As regards human toxicity, however, it is the total quantity present which is vitally important. If there isn't enough insecticide there, then the patient cannot be harmed. The aim of pediculicide formulation is to maximise the dose acquired by the insects while minimising the amount of insecticide employed. Formulation types Formulators achieve these objectives in various ways...|$|E
40|$|Context. During {{the late}} 1990 s, {{insecticide}} resistance had rendered {{a number of}} treatment products ineffective; some companies saw {{this as an opportunity}} to develop alternative types of treatment. We investigated the possibility that a surfactant-based lotion containing 10 % cocamide diethanolamine (cocamide DEA) was effective to eliminate head louse infestation. Settings and Design. Initial in vitro testing of the lotion formulation versus laboratory reared body/clothing lice, followed by two randomised, controlled, community-based, assessor blinded, clinical studies. Materials and Methods. Preliminary laboratory tests were performed by exposing lice or louse eggs to the product using a method that mimicked the intended use. Clinical Study 1 : Children and adults with confirmed head louse infestation were treated by investigators using a single application of aqueous 10 % cocamide DEA lotion applied for 60 min followed by shampooing or a single 1 % permethrin creme rinse treatment applied to pre-washed hair for 10 min. Clinical Study 2 : Compared two treatment regimens using 10 % cocamide DEA lotion that was concentrated by hair drying. A single application left on for 8 h/overnight was compared with two applications 7 days apart of 2 h duration, followed by a shampoo wash. Results. The initial laboratory tests showed a <b>pediculicidal</b> effect for a 60 min application but limited ovicidal effect. A longer application time of 8 h or overnight was found capable of killing all eggs but this differed between batches of test material. Clinical Study 1 : Both treatments performed badly with only 3 / 23 (13 %) successful treatments using cocamide DEA and 5 / 25 (23. 8 %) using permethrin. Clinical Study 2 : The single overnight application of cocamide DEA concentrated by hair drying gave 10 / 56 (17. 9 %) successes compared with 19 / 56 (33. 9 %) for the 2 h application regimen repeated after 1 week. Intention to treat analysis showed no significant difference (p = 0. 0523) between the treatments.

Screening was done in 120 girl’s elementary schools during which 7291 students were examined for head lice infestation. About 13. 5 % (975) of the girls were detected with head lice. The infested girls were divided into three treatment groups with three kinds of shampooes containing pediculicide and one control group with ordinary shampoo (placebo). In a randomized evaluator, blind clinical trial to compare <b>pediculicidal</b> and ovicidal effects of shampooes against head lice, the participants assigned to groups to use the shampooes based on manufacture’s instructions and followed up three weeks after treatment. Statistical analyses were done by X 2 test and line logarithmic procedure. Results: The results show that cure rates (no live adult and nymph of lice were seen on physical re-examination of scalp(, {{at the end of}} the first week were 29, 36, 34 and 15 percent for d-phenothrin 0. 2 %, lindane 1 %, permethrin 1 % and placebo respectively. These cure rates for treatment shampooes showed significant differences when compared to placebo (0. 001 0. 05). but {{at the end of the}} third week, the cure rates for the three mentioned shampooes were 88, 88 and 87 percent and also there is no statisticall differences in their efficacy. It should be noted that the results of ordinary shampoo is just for the first week after usage. Line logarithmic analysis of results shows that efficacy of different pediculicide shampoo (p value= 0. 58) in different times (p value= 0. 25) have no difference. but the cure rate of cases varied three weeks after treatment. (p value< 0. 0001). This shows the residual effect of pediculicides on new hatched nymphs. Conclusion: According to the results obtained, economical viewpoint, and popular acceptance, lindane % 1 shampoo is advocated as the first choice for treatment of head lice infestion if its usage is done under manufacture’s instruction and with caution combine with physical removal of nits with fine-toothed comb.
