This thesis work describes {{the estimation of}} pedestrian crash count and interaction severity prediction models for a sample of signalized intersections in Connecticut with either concurrent or exclusive <b>pedestrian</b> <b>phasing.</b> With concurrent <b>phasing,</b> <b>pedestrians</b> cross during the regular vehicle phase in the direction they are crossing the street, while with exclusive <b>phasing,</b> <b>pedestrians</b> cross in their own phase when all vehicles are stopped. Pedestrians crossing each intersection were observed and classified according to the severity of any interactions with motor vehicles. Intersections were selected to represent both types of signal phasing while controlling for other physical characteristics. In the nonlinear mixed models for interaction severity fixed effects of exposure measures and roadside characteristics, and random effects of intersection were entered nonlinearly {{to account for the}} repeated measures of pedestrian crossings at each intersection. For the models of interaction severity, partial proportional odds was found to fit the interaction data best, and annual average daily conflicts as pedestrian exposure formed the best model for predicting crash count on the basis of adequacy of model fit, significance of covariates, and goodness of fit tests. Intersections with exclusive <b>pedestrian</b> <b>phasing</b> have more minor or severe conflicts between pedestrians and motor vehicles but fewer crashes...|$|R

To examine cost trade-offs between pedestrians and vehicles various multi-attribute weighting criteria are applied to different components of travel delay using relative values of time.

50|$|Since {{it stops}} all motor {{vehicles}} rather than allowing partial vehicle movements to coexist with partial pedestrian movements, the pedestrian scramble {{has sometimes been}} seen as inefficient by traffic engineers, with its removal believed as creating big savings in delays and congestion.

We tested the hypotheses that low vision individuals could learn useful skills in virtual streets and could apply them to improve real street safety. Twelve participants, whose vision was too poor to use the pedestrian signals were taught by a certified orientation and mobility specialist to determine the safest time {{to cross the street}} using the visual and auditory signals made by the start of previously stopped cars at a traffic-light controlled street intersection. Four participants were trained in real streets and eight in virtual streets presented on 3 projection screens. The crossing timing of all participants was evaluated in real streets before and after training. The participants were instructed to say "GO" at the time when they felt the safest to cross the street. A safety score was derived to quantify the GO calls based on its occurrence in the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>phase</b> (when the pedestrian sign did not show DON'T WALK).

40|$|Improvements in {{the quality}} of service on a signalized {{intersection}} or arterial can be interpreted as a reduction in the user cost of service, which is expected to induce demand based on economic theory. This report presents a methodology for measuring and interpreting changes to user costs, and determining whether demand was induced. High-resolution signal event data and Bluetooth device MAC address matching are demonstrated in three case studies with the purpose of quantifying the impacts of changes in signal timing plans. In the first case study, 21 months of vehicle volume data are used to test whether demand was induced by optimizing offsets on a Saturday plan. In the second case study, the increase in demand for pedestrian service is quantified with respect to the implementation of an exclusive <b>pedestrian</b> <b>phase</b> using an econometric model taking the effects of season, weather, and special events into account.

40|$|Despite the {{intention}} {{that they should}} increase pedestrian safety, designated crossings (that is, marked out points for road crossing such as stand-alone signal-controlled crossings, zebras, and junction lights with a <b>pedestrian</b> <b>phase)</b> {{are known to be}} problematic in character (Carsten, Sherborne and Rothengatter, 1998).

The most recent figures (2001) on pedestrian casualties for the UK bear out this point, with cases at all levels of severity tending to be more common at designated crossing sites than within 50 metres of them. Whilst the precise reasons for this are unclear, it {{may be the result of}} children in Britain also making less use of such crossings, and thus having a poorer grasp of what behaviours are appropriate at these points and why. It would therefore be valuable to ascertain what children do understand about designated crossings, and to attempt to ameliorate any gaps via educational intervention, especially since there has been little previous work of this kind. Indeed, at present, none of the practical pedestrian training schemes for children in use in the UK address safe use of designated crossings...|$|E

This paper {{presents the results of}} a pilot study testing the use of existing signal infrastructure – 2070 signal controllers with advanced software to log <b>pedestrian</b> <b>phase</b> actuations and detections from bicycle lane inductive loops – to count pedestrians and bicycles. The pilot study was conducted at a typical suburban signalized intersection with heavy motorized traffic that was instrumented on all four approaches with pedestrian push buttons and advance inductive loops in the bicycle lane for signal operation. One day (24 hours) of video data were collected as ground truth. The data were reduced and compared to the controller logs. Results indicated that utilizing pedestrian phases as a proxy for estimating pedestrian activity is a promising avenue for counting programs. A total of 596 pedestrians used the intersection while 482 pedestrian phases were logged, resulting in an average of 1. 24 pedestrians per phase logged. However, bicycle counts were not as accurate, due to a number site-specific factors: (1) inductive loop location, (2) loop sensitivity settings, (3) loop shape, and (4) nearly half of the bicycle volume through the intersection was riding on the sidewalk.

40|$|The goal {{of signal}} timing at an {{intersection}} {{should be to}} maximize efficiency for all users. In many jurisdictions, however, traffic signals are timed mostly {{with the goal of}} reducing vehicular delay. Other road users, such as pedestrians, deserve similar focus. In legacy transportation systems, pedestrians experience delays much in excess of those that would be deemed acceptable for a motor vehicle at the same location. Excessive delay can lead to pedestrian frustration, non-compliance and ultimately decreased safety. In the North American context, implementation of strategies to address pedestrian service varies greatly across jurisdictions, and there has been limited research on incorporating alternative pedestrian treatments at signalized intersections. Recent updates to the Highway Capacity Manual (HCM 2010) have included specific multimodal delay modeling techniques offering a bit more accommodation to pedestrians, but still remain heavily vehicle-centric. While strategies such as an exclusive <b>pedestrian</b> <b>phase</b> and leading pedestrian intervals can help improve the safety of pedestrian operations, legacy service of pedestrians requires that they still must wait for their turn. This webinar will present the details of alternative pedestrian strategies, as well as the results of recent research into the impact on delay that these treatments have on all users. At the conclusion, practitioner recommendations will be presented developed from the results of a user survey, field implementations of strategies, and software-in-the-loop (SITL). [URL]...|$|E
40|$|People {{with vision}} {{impairment}} have different perception and spatial cognition {{as compared to}} the sighted people. Blind pedestrians primarily rely on auditory, olfactory, or tactile feedback to determine spatial location and find their way. They generally have difficulty crossing intersections due to lack of traffic information at intersections. Among the intersection crossing sub-tasks, locating crosswalk, determining when to cross and maintaining alignment to crosswalk while crossing are the most difficult tasks for the blind and visually impaired. To understand how the blind pedestrians make safe crossing decisions, ten blind and low-vision individuals were interviewed. The purpose of these interviews was to understand the types of information they use while making safe intersection crossings and identify new information types that could assist them. A Mobile Accessible Pedestrian Signals (MAPS) prototype was developed to support decision making at signalized intersections. The MAPS integrates sensors on a Smartphone, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth technologies, and traffic signal controllers were developed to provide intersection geometry information and Signal Phasing and Timing (SPaT) to pedestrians who are blind at signalized intersections. A single-tap command on the Smartphone screen allows users to request for intersection geometry information, such as street name, direction and number of lanes at a corner of an intersection.

However, in instances of the latter case, such as New York City's, the buttons were simply deactivated when traffic signals were updated to automatically include <b>pedestrian</b> <b>phases</b> as part of every signal cycle. In such instances these buttons may be removed during future updates to the pedestrian signals. In the United Kingdom, pressing a button at a standalone pedestrian crossing that is unconnected to a junction will turn a traffic light red immediately, {{but this is not}} necessarily the case at a junction.|$|R
50|$|When {{an advance}} signal is used, {{it should be}} {{actuated}} by an approaching bus to avoid needlessly delaying other traffic {{when there is no}} bus present.

If there is a limited amount of other traffic in the lane, then two or more loop detectors can be used and configured with AND logic such that only a long vehicle will actuate the advance phase. If the queue jump lane is shared with a higher volume of other traffic, a more high-tech detection scheme may be needed such as Opticom or RFID. Queue jump advance phases are typically 5-10 seconds in duration; longer time may be needed if multiple buses or right turning traffic need to be flushed through the queue jump in one signal cycle. <b>Pedestrian</b> <b>phases</b> can generally run concurrent with a queue jump phase {{as long as there are}} no protected turn phases also running with the queue jump phase.|$|R

40|$|Balancing {{the needs}} of all surface {{transportation}} modes safely and efficiently is an important objective, and especially critical at signalized intersections where turning vehicles and pedestrians share the crosswalk. This thesis identifies a significant gap in the literature for evaluating the impact of right turning vehicles on pedestrian level of service (LOS). A new measure for pedestrian LOS that is sensitive to alternative pedestrian phasing options is proposed and a methodology for field application is developed. This methodology, called the percent compromised method, defines a compromised crossing as a crossing in which the pedestrian is delayed or changes travel path or speed in response to turning vehicles. This method can be applied to individual pedestrians or pedestrian platoons, or can be used to identify the cycles in which there are compromises due to turning vehicles. ^ The percent compromised procedure is then applied to a case study intersection near Disneyland in Anaheim, California to evaluate the impact of a leading pedestrian interval and provide quantitative assessment. This study provided quantitative evidence that the leading pedestrian interval did not perform as well as traditional concurrent pedestrian phasing due to right turns on red. ^ Subsequent chapters describe the application of the percent compromised procedure to thirteen crosswalks at ten intersections in West Lafayette, Indiana, Indianapolis, Indiana, Portland, Oregon, and Cincinnati, Ohio. Approximately seventy-six hours of videotape were analyzed, resulting in a data set of 1, 385 pedestrian crossings. Discrete outcome analysis demonstrated the methodology was sensitive to the right turn flow rate, direction of travel, number of pedestrians during the cycle, signal compliance, and crosswalk location. The raw data from the pedestrian crossings is provided in an electronic form in the dissertation appendices. ^ The dissertation concludes by demonstrating how <b>pedestrian</b> <b>phase</b> data can be integrated with vehicle sensing equipment to provide real-time pedestrian LOS performance measures for pedestrian crossings at signalized intersections. ^ Recommendations are made to extend the methodology to incorporate left turning vehicles and revise Chapter 18 of the Highway Capacity Manual to include a pedestrian LOS measure that more effectively quantifies the negative impact of turning vehicles on pedestrians. ...|$|E
40|$|The role {{of walking}} in the {{development}} of healthy, livable communities is being increasingly recognized. In urban areas, intersections represent locations where different modes converge, and are often viewed as deterrents to walking. This is due to the unwarranted and often unnecessary delays imposed by signal timing policies for pedestrians and increased potential for conflicts. Traditional signal timing design prioritizes vehicles over pedestrians leading to undesirable consequences such as large delays and risky pedestrian behaviors. Pedestrians are accommodated {{in a manner that is}} designed to cause least interruption to the flow of motor vehicles. This lack of pedestrian accommodation at signalized intersections is the focus of this dissertation. Understanding pedestrian attitudes and perceptions is important because it offers insights into actual crossing behavior at signalized intersections. An intercept survey of 367 crossing pedestrians was undertaken at four signalized intersections in Portland, Oregon, and binary logistic regression models were constructed to quantify the impacts of demographics, trip characteristics and type of infrastructure on pedestrian perceptions and attitudes regarding delay, crossing time and motivators for crossing decisions. Safety was found to have a larger effect than compliance on the decision to cross the street. Pedestrians at recall intersections expressed higher satisfaction with delay than at actuated intersections. Novel methods to measure pedestrian delay using 2070 signal controllers and Voyage software were developed. These methods have been adopted by the City of Portland to record actuation trends and delays at various intersections. In the absence of demand data, pedestrian push button actuations can be considered as a proxy for crossing demand. The micro-simulation software VISSIM was used to analyze delays resulting from varying pedestrian and vehicle volumes on a network of three intersections in Portland, Oregon. From a pedestrian perspective, free operation was found to be always beneficial due to lower pedestrian delays. However, from a system wide perspective, free operation was found to be beneficial only under low-medium traffic conditions from an overall delay reduction viewpoint, while coordinated operation showed benefits under heavy traffic conditions, irrespective of the volume of pedestrians. Control strategies were developed to identify the best mode of signal controller operation that produced the lowest overall average delay per user. A procedure to identify the optimal control strategy based on user inputs (major street volume to capacity ratios and rate of <b>pedestrian</b> <b>phase</b> serviced for the minor street) was developed. The procedure was applied to a network of three intersections in east Portland, OR and the findings were verified. This research offers significant contributions in the field of pedestrian research. The findings related to attitudes and perceptions of crossing pedestrians offer greater insights into pedestrian crossing behavior and add to the body of existing literature. The methods developed to obtain pedestrian actuations and delay data from signal controllers represent an easy and cost-effective way to characterize pedestrian service at intersections. The results pertaining to signal timing strategies represent an important step towards incorporating pedestrian needs at intersections and demonstrate how control strategies employed to benefit pedestrians could benefit the entire system...|$|E
40|$|The {{safety at}} half-signalized intersections in Portland, Oregon is {{analyzed}} {{in this thesis}} using 10 years of crash history and analysis of video that was collected at a subset of intersections. A half-signalized intersection has a standard red-yellow-green traffic signal for automobiles on the major road, a stop sign for motorists on the minor road, and a pedestrian signal with actuation for pedestrians and/or bicyclists on the minor road. Although prevalent in Canada, this type of intersection control is not typically found in the United States because the MUTCD explicitly prohibits its use. Half-signal use is limited mostly to two cities in the Pacific Northwest. In Portland, Oregon there are forty-seven intersections where half-signals are used but the last installation was in 1986; Seattle has over 100 intersections with half-signals and installs these in new locations where warranted. To explore the safety records of these intersections in Portland, crash data from 2002 - 2011 was analyzed. A total of 442 crashes over the ten-year period at half-signals were observed. Sixteen of these 442 crashes involved pedestrians. In the crashes involving pedestrians, {{significant differences were found}} between the approach street of the vehicle and whether the pedestrian or driver was at fault. In the crash error reports, it was found that significantly more of the crashes involving pedestrians were the fault of motorists departing from the minor road who collided with pedestrians crossing the major street. Further crash analysis at half-signals was performed by developing matched comparison groups of minor stop controlled and fully signalized intersections. Crash rates were 0. 158 and 0. 178 crashes per million entering vehicles for 3 -leg and 4 -leg half-signals and these rates did not differ significantly from the minor street stop controlled and signalized comparison groups. Results from the matched comparison showed that the half-signalized group had more rear-end crashes when compared with the minor stop controlled group. This was the only result that held significance when crash rates were considered. It was also observed that the minor stop controlled group had a higher proportion of angle crashes when compared with the half-signal group but this did not influence the crash severity. Pedestrian crashes were more prevalent in the half-signal group when compared with the fully-signalized group. Pedestrian volumes were not available which would be used to determine if this significant measure is a result of higher pedestrian use at half-signals. In addition to crash analysis, video was captured at five half-signalized intersections totaling 180 hours. Traffic volumes, pedestrian and bicycle volumes, and signal actuations were collected over a twenty-four hour period. Over this twenty-four hour period the five intersections averaged daily counts of 18613 vehicles on the major street, 591 vehicles on the minor street, 263 pedestrians crossing the major street, 285 pedestrians crossing the minor street, 52 bicycles on the major street, 37 bicycles on the minor street, and 126 signal actuations. Twenty-four hour observations from each of the intersections were used to study conflicts and compliance. No conflicts were observed that reflect the left-turning from the minor street pedestrian crashes that were identified in the crash history. Compliance of the half-signal by vehicles and pedestrians was comparable to compliance at fully-signalized intersections found in other studies with one exception. Across the intersections where video was collected, consisting of four 4 -leg intersections and one 3 -leg intersection, seven left turn on red violations were observed which had a significant impact on the time after red that red light violations were made. It is hypothesized that at half-signals vehicles on the major street make a left turn on the red signal very late into the red phase because there is not a risk of colliding with a vehicle traveling on the minor street since traffic volumes on the minor street are comparably low. The observed left turn on red violations did not put pedestrians at risk since by that point into the signal pedestrians were already clear of the intersection. Finally, a stop compliance logistic regression model was developed at four four-leg intersections to see what factors had an effect on minor street vehicle stop compliance. All 166 hours of video were used to observe vehicles that arrived at the half-signal during the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>phase.</b> The dependent variable collected was whether a vehicle came to an acceptable stop. Independent variables collected included the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s queue position, if it was the peak school period, if there was a vehicle across the street on the minor road, if a vehicle was stopped at the signal on the major street, if a pedestrian was present when the vehicle arrived, and the movement that the vehicle made from the minor street. Independent variables used in the model included the vehicle 2 ̆ 7 s queue position, if a vehicle was stopped at the signal on the major street, if a pedestrian was present, and if the vehicle made a right turn at the signal. Pedestrian presence and right turning vehicles had a positive impact on stop compliance. Vehicles being further back in the queue and cars stopped at the signal on the major street had a negative impact on stop sign compliance. In the model, pedestrian presence had the largest positive impact on stop compliance. When pedestrians were present, a motorist on the minor street was four times more likely to stop at the sign...|$|E

The design has taken the pedestrian waiting tolerance limit time into consideration {{as one of the}} constraint conditions to obtain the <b>pedestrian</b> green <b>phase</b> duration. If the green phase duration is not sufficient for pedestrian crossing safety, the methods of twice crossing street or two chances of crossing can be applied according to different situations. The common red time of two intersections is analyzed to build delay functions by using of motorcade dispersion and traffic flow rate relationship, and timing optimization parameter can be worked out to minimize the total vehicle delay, thus determining signal phase difference. The result shows that this design may ensure the pedestrian safety and reduce the pedestrian delay...|$|R
40|$|There are two {{objectives}} for this research. One {{is to develop}} an effective procedure to optimize intersection signal timing by minimizing total delay for both vehicles and pedestrians. The second objective is to establish guidance for <b>pedestrian</b> crossing <b>phase</b> selection (two-way or scramble) {{and the length of}} WALK phase when scramble crossing is used. An optimization procedure for signal plans in an isolated intersection is developed. The procedure yields up to four phases for vehicles with either the two-way or scramble <b>pedestrian</b> crossing <b>phase.</b> A simple Genetic Algorithm (GA) is used in finding suitable signal plans because of the existence of a very large solution space. The GA fitness function is the total users delay (or cost). Compared with Highway Capacity Software (HCS) GA function, the proposed procedure has the same accuracy and more capabilities. When there is no pedestrian at the intersection, with the same input, the total delay from HCS and the proposed GA procedure has no significant difference (< 0. 2 %) before optimization. After optimization, the signal plans recommended by the proposed procedure can result in delay values that are slightly less than or {{at least as much as}} the delay values from the HCS GA optimized signal plans. However, when pedestrian delay is considered in signal timing, such a comparison could not be made because the HCS does not compute a delay for pedestrians, while the proposed GA procedure does. Contour diagrams and look-up tables are generated to guide the decision between two-way and scramble phases. The guidance considers different combinations of vehicular volume, pedestrian volume, relative value of time, initial queue, and geometric layout of the intersection. Not only pedestrian volumes and right-turn vehicle volumes need to be taken into account, but also through (and left-turn) vehicle volumes. Scramble crossing is beneficial when pedestrian and right-turn vehicle volumes in an approach are high but through vehicle volumes are relatively lower...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis was to perform microsimulation {{analyses}} on intersections near Highway-Railroad Grade Crossings (HRGCs) to determine if controlling mean train speed and train speed variability would improve safety and reduce delays. This research focused on three specific areas. First, average vehicle delay was examined, and this delay was compared for seven specific train speed distributions, including existing conditions. Furthermore, each distribution was associated with train detectors that were placed at the distance the fastest train could travel during the given warning time. Second, pedestrian cutoffs were investigated. These cutoffs represented an occasion when the <b>pedestrian</b> <b>phases</b> were truncated or shortened due to railroad signal preemption. Finally, vehicle emissions were analyzed using a modal emissions model. A microscopic simulation model of the Wellborn Corridor in College Station, Texas was created using VISSIM. The model was run twenty times in each train speed distribution for each of three train lengths. Average vehicle delay was collected for three intersections, and delays were compared using the Pooled t-test with a 95 % confidence interval. Comparisons were made between the distributions, and generally, distributions with higher mean train speeds were associated with lower average delay, and train length {{was not a significant}} factor. Unfortunately, pedestrian cutoffs were not specifically controlled in this project; therefore, no statistical conclusions can be made with respect to the pedestrian cutoff problem. However, example cases were devised to demonstrate how these cutoffs could be avoided. In addition, vehicle emissions were examined using the vehicle data from VISSIM as inputs for CMEM (Comprehensive Modal Emissions Model). For individual vehicles, as power (defined as the product of velocity and acceleration) increased, emissions increased. When comparing emissions from different train speed distributions, few significant differences were found. However, a scenario with no train was tested, and it was shown to have significantly higher emissions than three of the distributions with trains. Ultimately, this thesis shows that average vehicle delay and vehicle emissions could be lowered by specific train speed distributions. Also, work could be done to investigate the pedestrian cutoff problem...|$|R
30|$|An {{example of}} a barrier {{identified}} for Recommendation 10 is a user acceptance barrier: the system might cause slight annoyance to car drivers since prioritisation of pedestrians may lead to longer waiting times for cars (especially during rush hour). This could increase the red light running of cars. The annoyance caused to car drivers for giving prioritisation to pedestrians can be solved with a preliminary study of the intersection/area or environment in the traffic plan. In order to reduce waiting times for motorists, various technical developments could be envisaged: (i) pedestrian data could be entered into the traffic optimisation process (along with cyclists detected at the lights) to ensure optimum flow of all modes; (ii) pedestrian calls could be cancelled if the pedestrian has already crossed the street during a gap in traffic, before the <b>pedestrian</b> green <b>phase</b> has appeared.

40|$|During October and November 1988, {{subsurface}} testing (Phase II) {{was conducted}} at prehistoric site 41 BX 785, found in the West Salado Creek Outfall pipeline easement during a <b>pedestrian</b> survey (<b>Phase</b> I) of the project area. The Phase II limited testing determined that the subsurface portion of the prehistoric site is essentially intact, {{and at least two}} stratified occupation levels were identified. Although the tests did not produce diagnostic (datable) cultural materials, there is a notable amount of stone tool debit age in the central area, some unidentified biface fragments and burned rock which probably represents displaced hearth stones. We believe the site to be potentially eligible for consideration as a State Archeological Landmark and for nomination to the National Register of Historic Places. Because the site lies within the pipeline easement and will be impacted by the installation of the pipeline, and since it is a potentially significant cultural resource, we recommend that the site be considered for mitigation...|$|R
40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the results of}} an evaluation of pilot project pedestrian detection systems installed in three different European cities at in total six different sites. The implemented systems had the improvement of safety and comfort of pedestrians as objectives. The systems provided early detection of pedestrians approaching the crossing facility and detection of the presence of pedestrian on the crossing facility, allowing the onset of a <b>pedestrian</b> green <b>phase</b> or an extension of such a green phase. The evaluation involved the registration of pedestrian behaviour and pedestrian-vehicle encounters and conflicts. Pedestrian behaviour was recorded on videotape, conflicts were scored on the spot by trained observers. The behaviour recorded on videotape was later analysed using approach speed, nonnative behaviour and appropriate use of the crossing facilities as main indicators. In addition, pedestrian signal settings were recorded for each crossing. The evaluation design used a beforelafter measurement design with the after measurements being taken at least two weeks after the system implementation. The results indicated that although red light violations were reduced at some sites, they remained at a high level. The implementations had some positive effects on the normative behaviour of pedestrians. The percentage of pedestrians getting involved in encounters with motorized traffic was reduced at one site, increased at another and remained unchanged at the other sites. A significant reduction in conflicts was observed at several sites, but at other sites conflict occurrence remained unchanged. The system implementations had a very distinct positive effect on pedestrian delay. Required waiting times were reduced at all but one site and at some sites the reductions were substantial. Pedestrian comfort was also improved by an increase in the percentage of pedestrians arriving durhg the <b>pedestrian</b> green <b>phase</b> and the percentage being able to complete their crossing during pedestrian green. In summary, the evaluation study demonstrated that some safety effects and substantial effect on comfort were achieved by the implementation of the systems. The effects can be further optimized by selecting sites that fulfil specific requirements for successful implementation. Red light violation by pedestrian remains a serious safety problem and further studies should be undertaken how further reductions can be achieved by optimizing signal settings...|$|R
2500|$|Phase I {{consisted}} {{of building the}} [...] Simpson Center for Student-Athlete High Performance next to the west wall of the stadium. The center was built to be the home of football and 12 of California's Olympic sports that were previously housed in Memorial Stadium. The center saw {{the construction of new}} locker rooms, offices meeting rooms, training and sports medicine facilities, and an academic center in the SAHPC. The roof of the athletic center also acts as a <b>pedestrian</b> plaza. <b>Phase</b> I of the renovations were originally scheduled to begin {{the spring and summer of}} 2006 but was delayed by a court injunction due to three lawsuits against the project. A small group of tree-sitters occupied the oak grove on the west side of the stadium beginning on the [...] "Big Game" [...] day in December 2006 but in September 2008 the court injunction was lifted, the protesters came down, and construction of the athletic center began. The Simpson Center for Student-Athlete High Performance (originally SAHPC) opened in the Fall of 2011 and became 100% operational in January 2012.|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} {{investigate}} collective effects of interactions between pedestrians and attractions, this study extends the social force model. Such interactions lead pedestrians to form stable clusters around attractions, {{or even to}} rush into attractions if the interaction becomes stronger. It is also found that for high pedestrian density and intermediate interaction strength, some pedestrians rush into attractions while others move to neighboring attractions. These collective patterns of <b>pedestrian</b> movements or <b>phases</b> and transitions between them are systematically presented in a phase diagram. The results suggest that safe and efficient use of pedestrian areas {{can be achieved by}} moderating the pedestrian density and the strength of attractive interaction, for example, in order to avoid situations involving extreme desire for limited resources.
