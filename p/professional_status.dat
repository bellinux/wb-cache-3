In 1945, after the Second World War, the side joined the Championnat de France amateur. They achieved promotion to Division 3 in 1970 and stayed in the division for the following eight seasons. Between 1980 and 1984, the team played in Division 4 before winning promotion back to Division 3. The club gained <b>professional</b> <b>status</b> {{for the first time}} the following year when they were promoted to Division 2. After another promotion in 1987, they played in Division 1 for the only time in the 1987–88 season, but were relegated after one season.|$|E
5|$|From the {{beginning}} of the IIHF World Championships in 1920, Canada would send a senior amateur club team, usually the previous year's Allan Cup champion, to compete as the Canadian entry. These teams were often university players, or unpaid players playing ice hockey while being employed in some other profession full-time. From the 1920s until the 1950s, Canadian amateur club teams won most of the World Championship and Olympic titles. As a career, Canadian players would play instead in the various professional hockey leagues, the best reaching the NHL. Their <b>professional</b> <b>status</b> made them ineligible to play in the World Championships or Olympics under the rules of the time. The last Canadian amateur club to win the world championship was the Trail Smoke Eaters in 1961.|$|E

This event, Akhtar's reaction and other similar issues with companies such as Nike and Unilever have been used by conservative political critics, such as James Joyner, claiming that western nations and organizations are kowtowing in too easily to Muslims' claims or threats and by commentators, including author Daniel C. Dennett, highlighting how factions of the Islamic faith gravitate towards iconoclasm.|$|E

Although hoping to leave his post in India several months early, he was concerned for his economic prospects, and desperately searched for a new position. Through friends in the British archaeological community, he was offered a job as the Secretary of the Royal Commission on the Ancient and Historical Monuments of Wales, although he was upset that this would mean a drop in his <b>professional</b> <b>status</b> and income and decided to turn it down. Instead, he agreed {{to take up a}} chair in the Archaeology of the Roman Provinces at the Institute of Archaeology. In addition, the Pakistani Minister of Education invited him to become the Archaeological Adviser to the Pakistani government; he agreed to also take up this position, on the condition that he would only spend several months in the country each year over the next three.|$|E
5|$|Denis Troch {{was hired}} as the club's new manager in August 2008, and despite hopes of a swift return to Ligue 2, the team {{performed}} poorly throughout the 2008–09 campaign. The side failed to win a league match {{during the first three}} months of the season, and that form continued into 2009. They went into their final match of the season, away at Pacy Vallée-d'Eure, requiring three points to avoid successive relegations. However, the side could only procure a 0–0 draw and were relegated to the Championnat de France amateur for the first time since 1970. The relegation saw the end of Chamois Niortais's era as a professional club, as they were forced to become a semi-professional outfit due to the DNCG rules. In June 2009, Pascal Gastien was appointed as manager for his third spell in charge of the club, handed the task of achieving promotion back to the Championnat National at the first attempt. The club won the CFA Group C that season, and was subsequently promoted back to the National division for the following campaign. Niort secured their third-tier status with an 11th-place finish in the 2010–11 season. The following season, the team finished as runners-up in the Championnat National behind Nîmes Olympique to return to Ligue 2 for the 2012–13 campaign and regain their <b>professional</b> <b>status.</b>|$|E

25|$|Many clubs {{disagreed}} with the subjective criteria, most notably Strasbourg, RC Roubaix, Amiens SC, and Stade Français, while others like Rennes and Olympique Lillois were reluctant to become professional due {{to a variety of}} reasons, mostly due to fear of bankruptcy with Rennes and a conflict of interest with the latter club, as the team's president Henri Jooris also served as chairman of the Ligue du Nord. Jooris feared his league would fold and proposed it become the second division of the new league. Eventually, many clubs earned <b>professional</b> <b>status,</b> though it became more difficult to convince Northern clubs with Strasbourg, RC Roubaix, and Amiens still refusing to accept the new league, though Mulhouse, Excelsior AC Roubaix, Metz, and Fives accepted professionalism. On the other side, clubs in the south of France such as Olympique de Marseille, Hyères, SO Montpellier, SC Nîmes, Cannes, Antibes, and Nice were extremely supportive of the new league and accepted their <b>professional</b> <b>status</b> without argument.|$|E

25|$|Despite {{the success}} of these early efforts to {{establish}} <b>professional</b> <b>status</b> of midwives, midwifery failed to make a significant comeback. In the following decades, childbirths almost completely moved to the hospital where they were managed by physicians. At the onset of World War II, more than half of births were in hospitals.

25|$|Another rather strange {{chapter of}} nineteenth century science that is {{relevant}} {{with regard to}} Egyptomania is Craniology, {{the study of the}} human cranium that claimed to be able to determine an individual's intelligence and even character. Egyptian mummies served as an abundant source for the object of study— skulls. Craniology was especially important with regard of the question, whether Egyptians were black or white, a debate lead in light of the justification of slavery. The key figure for this period seems to be Samuel George Morton who founded the American School of Ethnology. He put forward the theory of Polygenesis claiming that there is not one but several human races who are in a hierarchical order with whites at the top and blacks at the bottom end of the scale. Although science today disapproves of Morton's findings it still revalidated his <b>professional</b> <b>status,</b> because Morton's American School was to a large degree responsible {{for the development of the}} current <b>professional</b> <b>status</b> of the sciences and the renunciation of puritan ideas of monogenesis and the Christian, clerical worldview, common at the time.|$|E
