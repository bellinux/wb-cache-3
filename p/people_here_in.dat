In response, at the debate the following day, Huntsman responded: [...] "I was criticized last night by Governor Romney for putting my country first, I just want to remind the <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> New Hampshire and throughout the United States that he criticized me while he was out raising money for serving my country in China, yes under a Democrat, like my two sons {{who are in the}} United States Navy. They’re not asking what the affiliation of the President is. I want to be clear... I will always put my country first. I think that’s important".|$|E

So that process was started before the pilot really, what was this man like before he deteriorated, so I was able to revisit that. Physically, of course, what I had to do was capture the energy, to capture the physicality of the man, the vocal physicality of the man, this was my task. I was aided enormously by my hair and makeup and special effects <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> terms of getting the overall, and indeed wardrobe helped a lot as well.

2500|$|Most {{affluent}} {{families from}} Metro Manila and nearby towns and provinces have chosen Dasmariñas {{to be their}} home due to its proximity to the National Capital Region.

2500|$|In San Francisco, Petrelis {{witnessed}} the White Night riots at San Francisco City Hall, {{a reaction to}} the lenient sentencing of Dan White, convicted of killing San Francisco Mayor George Moscone and openly gay Supervisor Harvey Milk.

And we had to look out for ourselves — even with the relative liberal attitudes of San Francisco.” ...|$|E
2500|$|But I {{would also}} add that as {{important}} as ABC is, {{the fact is that}} this is a disease where 50 percent of the people infected in the world are women. When I cite those numbers to <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> the United States, I find most people are astonished. They just have no idea about that. In some countries in Africa, it's well above 50 percent that are women and girls. In many cases this is driven by cultural factors, where young girls are having sex with older men and [...] coerced to do that, where women aren't regarded as equal citizens with men. So there are lots of things that need to be done addressing those kinds of cultural issues also.|$|E

2500|$|During {{that same}} night, in Lufkin, a local {{resident}} named Robert Atkinson spotted a peeping tom in his window.

2500|$|In the 17th century, Miguel Sánchez {{interpreted}} the Virgin as addressing herself {{specifically to the}} Indians, while noting that Juan Diego himself regarded all the residents of New Spain as his spiritual heirs, the inheritors of the holy image. The Virgin's own words to Juan Diego as reported by Sánchez were equivocal: she wanted a place at Tepeyac where she can show herself:"as a compassionate mother to you and yours, to my devotees, to those who should seek me for the relief of their necessities". By contrast, {{the words of the}} Virgin's initial message as reported in Nican Mopohua are, in terms, specific to all residents of New Spain without distinction, while including others, too:"I am the compassionate mother of you and of all you <b>people</b> <b>here</b> <b>in</b> this land, and of the other various peoples who love me, who cry out to me [...]."

60|$|I {{have been}} quite amused with {{something}} which has happened lately.

60|$|For the rest, it may perhaps admit a controversy, {{whether the}} banishing all notions of {{religion}} whatsoever would be inconvenient for the vulgar.

But I conceive some scattered notions about a superior power to be of singular use for the common people, as furnishing excellent materials to keep children quiet when they grow peevish, and providing topics of amusement in a tedious winter night.|$|E
