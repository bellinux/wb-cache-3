25|$|The {{study of}} {{personality}} has {{a broad and}} varied history in psychology {{with an abundance of}} theoretical traditions. The major theories include dispositional (trait) perspective, psychodynamic, humanistic, biological, behaviorist, evolutionary, and social learning perspective. However, many researchers and psychologists do not explicitly identify themselves with a certain perspective and instead take an eclectic approach. Research in this area is empirically driven, such as dimensional models, based on multivariate statistics, such as factor analysis, or emphasizes theory development, such as that of the psychodynamic theory. There is also a substantial emphasis on the applied field of <b>personality</b> <b>testing.</b> In psychological education and training, the study of the nature of personality and its psychological development is usually reviewed as a prerequisite to courses in abnormal psychology or clinical psychology.|$|E

2500|$|Another {{major focus}} in psychometrics {{has been on}} <b>personality</b> <b>testing.</b> [...] There have been a range of {{theoretical}} approaches to conceptualizing and measuring personality. [...] Some of the better known instruments include the Minnesota Multiphasic Personality Inventory, the Five-Factor Model (or [...] "Big 5") and tools such as Personality and Preference Inventory and the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator. [...] Attitudes have also been studied extensively using psychometric approaches. [...] A common method in the measurement of attitudes {{is the use of}} the Likert scale. [...] An alternative method involves the application of unfolding measurement models, the most general being the Hyperbolic Cosine Model (Andrich & Luo, 1993).|$|E

After six months the applicants reapplied and completed the same <b>personality</b> <b>test.</b> The answers on the <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> were compared and {{there was no significant difference}} between the answers.|$|R
50|$|<b>Personality</b> <b>tests</b> {{have been}} around for a long time, but it wasn't until it became illegal for {{employers}} to use polygraphs that we began to see the widespread use of <b>personality</b> <b>tests.</b> The idea behind these <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> is that employers can reduce their turnover rates and prevent economic losses in the form of people prone to thievery, drug abuse, emotional disorders or violence in the workplace.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{positions}} and explores {{the topic of}} image-based <b>personality</b> <b>test.</b> Instead of responding to text-based questions, the subjects will be provided a set of "choose-your-favorite-image" visual questions. With the image options of each question belonging to the same concept, the subjects' personality traits are estimated by observing their preferences of images under several unique concepts. The solution to design such an image-based <b>personality</b> <b>test</b> consists of concept-question identification and image-option selection. We have presented a preliminary framework to regularize these two steps in this exploratory study. A demo version of the designed image-based <b>personality</b> <b>test</b> is available at [URL] Subjective as well as objective evaluations have demonstrated the feasibility of image-based <b>personality</b> <b>test</b> in limited questions...|$|R
40|$|The {{controversy}} in human resource practice and law today continues, to wit: â€“the use of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> in employment, typically online tests, which human resource practitioners are increasingly using in the hiring process, especially for executives, sales, {{and customer service}} positions. Selecting the right people for the right positions is, of course, one {{of the elements of}} success for any business. Accordingly, it is imperative for the employer to choose highly qualified people for open positions. This article examines the effectiveness, legality, fairness, and morality of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> in employment. Legal aspects of the use of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> are examined, principally pursuant to the U. S. Civil Rights Act and the Americans with Disabilities Act. An ethical analysis of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> is provided to determine if their use in the context of employment is moral. The legal focus of the article is primarily on the private sector, but the principles are applicable across the board. The implications of the use of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> in employment are raised; and accordingly several recommendations are supplied to achieve a legal, moral, and practical use of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> in employment...|$|R

50|$|A {{study by}} American Management Association reveals that 39 percent of {{companies}} surveyed use <b>personality</b> <b>testing</b> {{as part of}} their hiring process.

40|$|In this {{theoretical}} study objective <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> {{are presented}} as a possible means of assessing behavior in standardized settings. A new generation of objective <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> that are directly linked {{to the use of}} computers is described. One of the prime characteristics of these tests is {{that they do not have}} any face validity and are therefore less susceptible to the faking or other answer distortions that are regularly found in the subjective assessment of personality by means of questionnaires. Recent developments in the area of objective <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> are presented. The Hyperkinetic Syndrome Assessment Method (HKSD) is described as an example of the new generation of objective <b>personality</b> <b>tests.</b> The construction rationale, psychometric properties, and results on its validity are presented. Results from studies with clinical and non-clinical samples demonstrate the usefulness of the HKSD in practice. Objective <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> are discussed as alternatives in the field of psychological assessment and as valid, economical instruments for the assessment of behavior...|$|R
50|$|Another {{danger of}} <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> {{is that they}} can create false-negative results (i.e. honest people being labeled as dishonest) {{especially}} in cases when stress on the applicant's part is involved. There is also the issue of privacy to be of concern forcing applicants to reveal private thoughts and feelings through his or her responses that seem to become a condition for employment. Another danger of <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> is the illegal discrimination of certain groups under the guise of a <b>personality</b> <b>test.</b>|$|R

50|$|While {{the utility}} of {{cognitive}} ability testing in selection has been broadly accepted, {{the utility of}} <b>personality</b> <b>testing,</b> until relatively recently, has not. Historically, research documenting the low predictive validity {{and the potential for}} invasion of privacy based on item content has made its application as selection instruments questionable (Hogan, Hogan, & Roberts, 1996).|$|E

5000|$|The Woodworth Personal Data Sheet, {{sometimes}} {{known as}} the Woodworth Psychoneurotic Inventory was a <b>personality</b> <b>test,</b> commonly cited as the first <b>personality</b> <b>test,</b> developed by Robert S. Woodworth during World War I for the United States Army. It was developed to screen recruits for shell shock risk but was not completed in time {{to be used for}} this purpose. It instead became widely used in psychological research and {{led to the development of}} many other <b>personality</b> <b>tests.</b> It has been described as [...] "the linear ancestor of all subsequent personality inventories, schedules and questionnaires".|$|R
40|$|Personality {{research}} has mainly relied on self-report measures, more than on behavioral assessments. In the present study, brief behavioral <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> {{were developed to}} measure behavior that is prototypical for the Big Five traits of conscientiousness and agreeableness. A longitudinal study (N = 322; mean age = 12. 2 years) examined the predictive value of these newly developed <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> on changes in academic and social adjustment across the transition to secondary school. Conscientiousness and agreeableness were measured before the transition to secondary school using both the behavioral <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> and a self-report questionnaire. Academic achievement and social acceptance were measured both pre- and post-transition. The behavioral test of conscientiousness predicted changes in childrenâ€™s school achievement across the transition to secondary school, above and beyond self-reported conscientiousness. Similarly, the behavioral test of agreeableness predicted change in social acceptance, whereas self-reported agreeableness did not. Behavioral <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> index unique aspects of childrenâ€™s behavioral dispositions that are not fully captured by traditional self-report personality questionnaires, and that have predictive power over time. Keywords: objective <b>personality</b> <b>test,</b> agreeableness, conscientiousness, prosocial behavior, school transitio...|$|R
5000|$|Although Murray's {{theory has}} had a {{substantial}} influence on further <b>personality</b> <b>testing</b> and research, critics say that his system of needs is too broad and rather subjective. When evaluating the Thematic Apperception Test, critics have claimed that the test has a low test-retest reliability and validity. This could possibly be due to contrasting instructions from the experimenters (Flett, 2008).|$|E
50|$|The use of ordinal {{data can}} be found in most areas of {{research}} where categorical data are generated.

50|$|More {{successful}} {{has been}} the measurement of personality. There are tests of intelligence for example. No internal organ of intelligence has been found, and no genes either. But intelligence tests have been constructed that predict (helpfully but not perfectly) the performance of children in school.

50|$|The {{origins of}} <b>{{personality}}</b> <b>testing</b> {{date back to}} the 18th and 19th centuries, when personality was assessed through phrenology, the measurement of the human skull, and physiognomy, which assessed personality based on a person's outer appearances. These early pseudoscientific techniques were eventually replaced with more empirical methods in the 20th century. One of the earliest modern personality tests was the Woolworth Personality Data Sheet, a self-report inventory developed for World War I and used for the psychiatric screening of new draftees.|$|E
5000|$|Murray's {{system of}} needs has {{influenced}} {{the creation of}} <b>personality</b> <b>testing.</b> A personality test is a questionnaire or other standardized instrument designed to reveal aspects of an individual's character or psychological makeup. The first personality tests were developed in the 1920s and were intended to ease the process of personnel selection, particularly in the armed forces. The Personality Research Form and the Jackson Personality Inventory are two personality tests that Murray's system of needs directly influenced (Thematic apperception test, n.d.).|$|E
50|$|Employers {{may also}} view <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> as more {{accurate}} {{assessment of a}} candidate's behavioral characteristics versus an employment reference. But the problem with using <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> as a hiring tool is the notion a person's job performance in one environment will carry over to another work environment. However, {{the reality is that}} one's environment plays a crucial role in determining job performance, and not all environments are created equally. One danger of using <b>personality</b> <b>tests</b> is the results may be skewed based on a person's mood so good candidates may potentially be screened out because of unfavorable responses that reflect that mood.|$|R
