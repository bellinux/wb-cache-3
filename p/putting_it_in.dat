5|$|After {{the deaths}} of the Gienkes, {{authorities}} began to investigate the cluster of deaths. The county sheriff, Fred Roshon, soon discovered that Martha Wise had signed at a local drug store for a series of purchases of large quantities of arsenic. An autopsy on Lily Gienke confirmed the presence of arsenic in her digestive tract. Brought in for questioning by the sheriff, Wise at first claimed she had obtained the arsenic to kill rats, but eventually confessed that she had used it to poison family members by <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> water buckets and coffee pots the family drank out of.|$|E
5|$|Lionsgate {{gave the}} film a limited release in North America on November 6, 2009 (the release was {{expanded}} on November 20). Precious received largely positive reviews from critics; the acting, the story, and its message were generally praised. In the film's opening weekend in limited release, it grossed $1.8million, <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> 12th {{place at the}} box office. As of February 2010, the film had grossed over $47million domestically, ranking no. 65 for 2009, recouping its $10million budget, and making it a box office success.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} pie in {{the legend}} included sand eels, horse mackerel, pilchards, herring, dogfish and ling along with a seventh fish. In a traditional pie, the primary ingredient is the pilchard (sardine), although mackerel or herring {{is used as a}} substitute. Richard Stevenson, chef at The Ship Inn in Mousehole, suggests that any white fish will work for the filling, with pilchards or herring just added for the presentation. Prior to <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the pie the fish should be skinned and boned (except the head and tail) {{to make it easier to}} eat. Along with the fish, the other traditional ingredients are thickened milk, eggs and boiled potatoes.|$|E

5|$|Architectural {{historians have}} grouped the Precious Blood-related churches of far western Ohio into four {{different}} generations: the first, composed primarily of small log buildings {{from the first}} years of settlement until 1865; the second, composed of moderately sized brick churches built between 1865 and 1885; the third, composed mostly of large High Gothic Revival churches with massive towers constructed from 1885 to 1905; and the fourth, composed of churches built between 1905 and 1925 {{in a wide range of}} styles. Immaculate Conception's place at the end of the third generation is significant: its Romanesque Revival style is atypical of that period and much more common in the fourth generation that would soon arise, <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> somewhat of a transitional place between the third and fourth generations.|$|E
5|$|Columbia {{and much}} of the {{surrounding}} area lies within the Columbia Public School District. The district enrolls over 17,000 students and had a revenue of nearly $200 million for the 2007–2008 school year. It is above the state average in attendance percentage and in graduation rate. The city operates four public high schools which cover grades 9–12: David H. Hickman High School, Rock Bridge High School, Muriel Battle High School, and Frederick Douglass High School. Rock Bridge is one of two Missouri high schools to receive a silver medal by U.S. News & World Report, <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the top 3% of all high schools in the nation. Hickman has been on Newsweek magazine's list of top 1,300 schools in the country {{for the past three years}} and has more named presidential scholars than any other public high school in the United States. There are also several private high schools including Christian Fellowship School, Columbia Independent School, Heritage Academy, Christian Chapel Academy, and Father Augustine Tolton Regional Catholic High School.|$|E

25|$|The Otomis of {{the state}} are {{concentrated}} {{in the community of}} Cieneguilla in the municipality of Tierra Blanca. In pre-Hispanic times, these people were semi-nomadic, desert dwellers. During the Conquest, these and other Otomi groups allied themselves with the Spanish, in part because the Aztecs and others considered the Otomi to be backwards and barbaric. The Otomi also speak an Oto-Pamean language and are related to other Otomi groups scattered around the central and southern areas of Mexico.

Although the fort was originally intended to be buried on an airfield there was concern that <b>putting</b> <b>it</b> <b>in</b> the ground might, over time, degrade the concrete. Therefore, the fort has been placed at ground level and surrounded with a cone of earth and sandbags.
