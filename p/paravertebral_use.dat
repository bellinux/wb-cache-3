40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{prospective}} {{clinical study}} was to evaluate the location of paravertebral catheters that were placed using the classical landmark puncture technique and to correlate the distribution of contrast dye injected through the catheters with the extent of somatic block. Paravertebral catheter placement was attempted in 31 patients after video-assisted thoracic surgery. In one patient, an ultrasound-guided approach was chosen after failed catheter placement using the landmark method. A fluoroscopic examination in two planes using contrast dye was followed by injection of local anaesthetic and subsequent clinical testing {{of the extent of}} the anaesthetised area. In nine patients (29 %), spread of contrast dye was not seen within the paravertebral space as intended. Misplaced catheters were in the epidural space (three patients), in the erector spinae musculature (five patients), and in the pleural space (one patient). There was also a discrepancy between the radiological findings and the observed distribution of loss of sensation. We have demonstrated an unacceptably high misplacement rate of <b>paravertebral</b> catheters <b>using</b> the landmark method. Additional research is required to compare the efficacy and safety of continuous <b>paravertebral</b> block <b>using</b> ultrasound-guided techniques or surgical inserted catheters...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The authors {{describe}} an initial experience <b>using</b> <b>paravertebral</b> block for ambulatory or short-stay operations for breast cancer. BACKGROUND: Rising hospital costs have {{focused attention on}} limiting the length of stay for patients undergoing surgical treatment of breast cancer. Thus far, ambulatory surgery has been limited by side effects and complications of general anesthesia. Paravertebral block offers the potential benefit of effective analgesia, with limited postoperative nausea and vomiting. METHODS: The medical records of the first 15 patients with breast cancer who underwent 16 major operations {{for the treatment of}} breast cancer <b>using</b> <b>paravertebral</b> block were reviewed. Patients were either discharged directly from the recovery room or after overnight hospital admission. The effectiveness of anesthesia, surgical outcome, patient satisfaction, and hospital costs are reviewed. RESULTS: Paravertebral block achieved effective anesthesia for cancer operations of the breast and axilla; conversion to general anesthesia or supplementation with local anesthesia was not required. There was one postoperative hemorrhage, there were two seromas, and there was one superficial wound infection. Sensory block persisted for an average of 23 hours. Postoperative pain was effectively controlled, in fact, nine patients required no postoperative narcotic for pain control. Nausea and vomiting transiently afflicted three patients and prompted overnight observation in one patient originally scheduled for immediate discharge. Fourteen patients (93 %) rated their experience as "very satisfactory. " CONCLUSION: Breast operations for the surgical management of breast cancer <b>using</b> <b>paravertebral</b> block can be performed safely, with great patient satisfaction, and with potential for significant cost savings...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To assess {{safety and}} {{efficacy}} of the regional anesthetic technique paravertebral block for operative treatment of breast cancer, and to compare postoperative pain, nausea, vomiting, and length of hospital stay in patients undergoing breast surgery <b>using</b> <b>paravertebral</b> block and general anesthesia. BACKGROUND: General anesthesia is currently the standard technique used for surgical treatment of breast cancer. Increasing hospital costs have focused attention on reducing the length of hospital stay for these patients. However, the side effects and complications of general anesthesia preclude ambulatory surgery for most patients undergoing breast surgery. In April 1994, the authors initiated the <b>use</b> of <b>paravertebral</b> block anesthesia for patients undergoing primary breast cancer surgery. A review of our early experience revealed that this regional anesthetic technique enables effective anesthesia for operative procedures of the breast and axilla, reduces postoperative nausea and vomiting, and provides prolonged postoperative sensory block that minimizes narcotic requirements. METHODS: A retrospective analysis of 145 consecutive patients undergoing 156 breast cancer operations <b>using</b> <b>paravertebral</b> block and 100 patients undergoing general anesthesia during a 2 -year period was performed. Anesthetic effectiveness and complications, inpatient experience with postoperative pain, nausea, vomiting, and length of stay were measured. RESULTS: Surgery was successfully completed in 85 % of the cases attempted by <b>using</b> <b>paravertebral</b> block alone, and in 91 % of the cases, surgery was completed by <b>using</b> <b>paravertebral</b> block supplemented with local anesthetic. There was a 2. 6 % incidence of complications associated with block placement. Twenty percent of patients in the paravertebral group required medication for nausea and vomiting during their hospital stay compared with 39 % in the general anesthesia group. Narcotic analgesia was required in 98 % of general anesthesia patients, as opposed to 25 % of patients undergoing paravertebral block. Ninety-six percent of patients having paravertebral block anesthesia were discharged within the day of surgery, compared with 76 % of patients who had a general anesthetic. CONCLUSIONS: Paravertebral block {{can be used to}} perform major operations for breast cancer with minimal complications and a low rate of conversion to general anesthesia. Paravertebral block markedly improves the quality of recovery after breast cancer surgery and provides the patient with the option of ambulatory discharge...|$|R

40|$|Background and Aims: Thoracotomy {{incision}} following {{patent ductus arteriosus}} (PDA) ligation {{surgery is}} often associated with severe post-operative pain that has deleterious effects on respiratory function. We aimed to assess pain relief with thoracic <b>paravertebral</b> block <b>using</b> either bupivacaine or ropivacaine in these surgeries. Methods: One hundred paediatric patients of age group between 2 and 10 years undergoing PDA ligation surgery were randomised either to bupivacaine or ropivacaine group in this prospective double-blinded study. After induction of general anaesthesia, the ultrasound-guided paravertebral block was carried out using 0. 25 % bupivacaine 0. 4 ml/kg in Group B patients and 0. 2 % ropivacaine 0. 4 ml/kg in Group R patients. Monitoring included minimum mandatory monitoring with pulse rate, pulseoximetry (SpO 2), electrocardiogram, blood pressure, temperature during surgery and also in Intensive Care Unit (ICU). Additionally, modified objective pain score (MOPS) was used in ICU for assessment of pain for 12 h after surgery. Incidence of complications was noted. Results: Mean values of MOPSs were comparable in both the groups. The time to rescue analgesic was 8 to 10 h in over 80 % of patients in both the groups. More patients had hypotension and bradycardia in bupivacaine group compared to ropivacaine group. Conclusion: Paravertebral injection of 0. 4 ml/kg of either 0. 2 % ropivacaine or 0. 25 % bupivacaine provided equipotent analgesia, but ropivacaine had a better side effect profile. Ultrasound-guided paravertebral block is a safe and effective mode of analgesia in paediatric patients undergoing thoracotomy...|$|R
40|$|Chronic {{pelvic pain}} {{is a common}} problem with {{variable}} etiology. The sympathetic nervous system {{plays an important role}} in the transmission of visceral pain regardless of its etiology. Sympathetic nerve block is effective and safe for treatment of pelvic visceral pain. One of them, the inferior hypogastric plexus, is not easily assessable to blockade by local anesthetics and neurolytic agents. Inferior hypogastric plexus block is not commonly used in chronic pelvic pain patients due to pre-sacral location. Therefore, inferior hypogastric plexus is not readily blocked <b>using</b> <b>paravertebral</b> or transdiscal approaches. There is only one report of inferior hypogastric plexus block via transsacral approach. This approach has several disadvantages. In this case a favorable outcome was obtained by using coccygeal transverse approach of inferior hypogastric plexus. Thus, we report a patient who was successfully given inferior hypogastric plexus block via coccygeal transverse approach to treat chronic pelvic pain conditions involving the lower pelvic viscera.

40|$|Background: Postoperative pain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common {{complaints}} after elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. The present study was aimed to evaluate the effect of <b>paravertebral</b> block <b>using</b> bupivacaine with/without fentanyl on postoperative pain and complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Materials and Methods: This study was done on 90 patients scheduled to undergo elective laparoscopic cholecystectomy. Patients were assessed in two groups: The case group received bupivacaine and fentanyl, and the control group received bupivacaine and normal saline. Primary outcomes were severity of postoperative pain at rest and during coughing. Secondary outcomes were postoperative cumulative morphine consumption and the incidence of side-effects. Results: Pain score at rest before surgery, after recovery, hour- 1 and hour- 6 was not significantly different between the groups. But in hour- 24 cases, the pain score during coughing was significantly higher than controls. Severity of pain at rest in time points was not different between groups. The frequencies (%) of moderate pain at mentioned times in case and control groups were 64, 31, 16, 9, 0 versus 67, 16, 7, 4, and 0, respectively. Pain score during coughing was lower in controls at hour- 24 in comparison with cases, but in other time points was not significant. The control group significantly received more total dose of morphine in comparison with cases group. Nausea, vomiting and hypotension were similar in groups, but pruritus was significantly different between the groups. Conclusion: Adding fentanyl to bupivacaine in paravertebral block did not significantly improve the postoperative pain and complications after laparoscopic cholecystectomy. However, further studies are needed to be done...|$|R
40|$|Background: Ultrasound-guided {{paravertebral}} blocks during breast surgeries with in-plane needle approaches can {{be challenging}} due to difficult needle visualization. The {{purpose of this study}} was to assess the usefulness of using a needle guide while performing in-plane parasagittal approach paravertebral block for breast surgery. Patients and Methods: Eighty patients, American Society of Anesthesiologists physical status I-III, aged 20 - 40 years with breast mass scheduled for simple mastectomy surgery, were involved in prospective, controlled, randomized study, and were randomly divided by closed envelope method into two groups: Group I (n = 40) : Scheduled for ultrasound-guided paravertebral block or group II (n = 40) : Scheduled for ultrasound-guided <b>paravertebral</b> block <b>using</b> the needle guide. Both techniques compared as regards: (i) Needle visibility and block performance time; (ii) number of needle passes; (iii) duration of the block; (iv) doctor and patient satisfaction; and (v) incidence of complications. Results: Needle visibility score was better in group II (2. 92 ± 0. 26 vs. 1. 9 ± 0. 44, P < 0. 0001). Block performance time was shorter in group II (90. 92 ± 15 vs. 128. 25 ± 16 s, P < 0. 0001). A number of needle passes were less in group II (1. 27 ± 0. 45 vs. 2. 2 ± 0. 68, P < 0. 0001). Doctor and patient satisfaction were better in group II (P = 0. 015). No differences were found regarding the duration of the block and incidence of complications between groups. Conclusion: A needle guide can help reduce the time needed to perform a parasagittal in-plane thoracic paravertebral block, with a significant reduction in the block performance time, the number of needle passes, better needle visibility and better doctor and patient′s satisfaction. However, there was no significant difference regarding the duration of the block or incidence of complications...|$|R
40|$|Objective: to {{evaluate}} the efficiency of high thoracic paravertebral block as an anesthetic component in the surgical treatment of unstable angina pectoris. Subjects and methods. Twenty-six patients aged 38 to 67 years who had unstable angina pectoris and who had underwent surgical myocardial revascularization were examined. A study group included 12 patients in whom high thoracic paravertebral block (Th 3 —Th 4 —Th 5) with 0. 75 % ropivacaine solution {{was used as an}} additional component of general anesthesia. No paravertebral block was conducted in a comparison group (n= 14). Randomization was made by the envelop method in a ratio of 2 : 1. The groups were stratified by age, gender, the class of unstable angina, myocardial contractility, and the type of an operation. Results. Paravertebral block was ascertained to significantly increase the analgesic component of general anesthesia in the surgical treatment of unstable angina. In the study group of patients, there were more steady-state central hemodynamic parameters at surgical stages than in the comparison group, which contributed to a {{reduction in the number of}} critical episodes during anesthesia. The level of stress hormones at the surgical stages also indicated effective analgesia when high thoracic <b>paravertebral</b> block was <b>used.</b> Furthermore, the use of this technique of regional anesthesia substantially optimized an early postoperative period — there were fewer needs for opioids.

This prospective, randomized, double-blinded, pilot study is therefore intended to compare lidocaine to ropivacaine in bilateral continuous <b>paravertebral</b> blocks <b>using</b> a multimodal approach for postoperative pain management following laparoscopic bowel surgery. Methods: Thirty-five ASA I–III consecutive patients undergoing elective laparoscopic bowel surgery and bilateral thoracic paravertebral continuous blocks were analyzed: bilateral thoracic paravertebral infusions of ropivacaine 0. 2 % (Group Ropi, n= 18) or lidocaine 0. 25 % (Group Lido, n= 17) were started at 7 mL/h in the postanesthesia care unit. For each patient, we collected numerical rating scores (NRS) for pain at rest and during movement at baseline, at postanesthesia care unit discharge, at 24 hours and 48 {{hours after the}} end of surgery, as well as hydromorphone patient-controlled analgesia requirements, local anesthetic consumption, side effects, postoperative complications, and functional outcomes. Results: No effect of group distribution on NRS scores for pain at rest or at movement (P= 0. 823 and P= 0. 146), nor on hydromorphone (P= 0. 635) or local anesthetic consumption (P= 0. 063) was demonstrated at any analyzed time point. Hospital length of stay and spontaneous ambulation were comparable between groups (P= 0. 636 and P= 0. 148). In the context of a multimodal approach, the two drugs showed comparable safety profiles. Discussion: Lidocaine 0. 25 % and ropivacaine 0. 2 % provided similar analgesic profiles after elective abdominal surgeries, without any difference in terms of functional outcomes. The easier titratability of lidocaine together with its lower cost induced our clinical practice to definitely switch from ropivacaine to lidocaine for postoperative bilateral paravertebral continuous infusions.

Methods : After taken an approval from the ethics committee of the University, 40 patients were randomly assigned to receive either preservative-free intrathecal morphine 0. 3 mg in 3 ml normal saline together with paravertebral block (group I) or <b>paravertebral</b> block alone <b>using</b> bupivacaine (group II) before an induction of anesthesia. No continuous infusion of bupivacaine was started in both groups. Primary outcomes were Visual Analogue Score (VAS) at rest and on coughing. Hemodynamic and respiratory effects, bupivacaine consumption, patient′s satisfaction, and side effects like nausea, vomiting, urinary retention, and itching were considered as secondary outcomes. All patients in both groups received paracetamol 1 gram (gm) IV every 6 hourly for the 1 st 24 hr. Amount of rescue analgesic (pethidine 0. 5 mg/kg IV) in both groups and total bupivacaine cumulative doses in 48 hrs were calculated. Results : VAS at rest and on coughing did not differ significantly between the 2 groups at 0, 1, 6, 12, 18, 24, and 48 hours (P=> 0. 1). At 24 hours, VAS increased in both the groups, but the increase in VAS was comparable in both groups. There were insignificant incidences of nausea, purities, and urinary retention in intrathecal group compared with paravertebral group.

40|$|International audienceThere is {{a paucity}} of {{research}} in the peri-operative care of the scoliosis patient. We therefore postulated that there would be large differences in hospital care. We assessed this diversity using an online survey, with particular reference to pain control, thromboprophylaxis and blood conservation strategies. Anaesthetists specialising in scoliosis surgery in the U. K. were contacted via email, asking them if they would fill in a short email survey. Non responders were contacted a total of three times over a 6 month period. Of the 24 centres practicing paediatric and adolescent scoliosis surgery we received completed questionnaires from anaesthetists working in 21, a response rate of 88 %. Blood Conservation 20 centres (95 %) routinely cross-match blood. 17 centres (81 %) routinely use cell salvage with a further 3 (14 %) using it for specific cases only. Only 4 centres (19 %) advocated normovolaemic heamodilution, with no centres surveyed using pre donated blood. Peri-operatively, 17 centres (81 %) routinely used anti-fibrinolytics, all of whom use Tranexamic acid. Reported dosing regimes showed an even wider variation than previously reported (1) with loading doses varying between 2 - 100 mg/kg and infusions varying from 3 - 10 mg/kg/hr. Thromboprophylaxis 3 centres (14 %) used TEDS only, 3 centres (14 %) TEDS and foot pumps, 6 centres (29 %) Foot pumps alone and 8 centres (38 %) used no mechanical devices. Low molecular weight heparin was only used as part of a thromboprophylaxis regime in 6 centres (29 %) with some centres prescribing it the night before, others post operatively on the day of surgery, some 24 hours post surgery and one centre on day 2. Pain Control Epidural analgesia is routinely used in 8 centres (38 %), of which 3 centres (14 %) place 2 catheters and 2 centres (10 %) use patient controlled epidural analgesia, all continuing use into the post operative period. 4 centres (19 %) use clonidine as an adjunct. <b>Paravertebral</b> blocks are <b>used</b> in 9 centres (43 %), some with postoperative infusions. Three centres each (14 %) use intercostal nerve blockade or spinal opiods. All respondents use patient controlled analgesia (PCA), most commonly morphine but also fentanyl and oxycodone. Ketamine infusions are used in three centres (14 %). Non steroidal anti inflammatory drugs were avoided by three centres (86 %). Regular paracetamol was prescribed routinely in 12 centres (57 %) and all but 2 (90 %) centres use remifentanyl peri-operatively.

40|$|Thoracic {{paravertebral}} block (TPVB) {{consists of}} an injection of local anaesthetic alongside the thoracic vertebra close to where the spinal nerves emerge from the intervertebral foramen. Clinically TPVB can be accomplished either as a single-injection or as a multiple-injection. It {{can also be used}} as a continuous paravertebral infusion through an indwelling catheter for continuous pain relief. However compared to an epidural block, TPVB is less well understood and not commonly used for anaesthesia and or analgesia in anaesthetic practice. I hypothesized that TPVB is effective for producing unilateral segmental thoracic anaesthesia and managing pain of unilateral origin from the thorax. The objective of this thesis was to develop the technique of TPVB so that it becomes a useful technique for anaesthesia and pain management. So to test my hypothesis a series of clinical studies were performed on 416 patients (396 adults and 20 young infants), presenting for anaesthesia and or acute pain management, to evaluate various aspects of TPVB, namely; clinical application, anatomy of the thoracic paravertebral space, technique and safety, and pharmacology of local anaesthetic after TPVB.
