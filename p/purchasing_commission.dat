5|$|At {{conferences}} in 1946 and 1947, {{the decision was}} made to breed Haflinger horses from pure bloodlines, creating a closed stud book with no new blood being introduced. The Tyrolean Haflinger Breeders' Association established its own stallion center and prohibited private breeders from keeping stallions, thus ensuring that the association maintained 100percent control of breeding stallions. In Bavaria, several young stallions had been saved and breeders could privately own stallions. Bavarian and Tyrolean breeders maintained close ties and cooperated extensively. North Tyrolean breeders were also able to acquire several high-quality older stallions and lower-quality young stallions from South Tyrol. In 1947, the Federation of Austrian Haflinger Breeders was established as a governing organization for the provincial associations. At this time a large-scale breed show was held, attended by visitors from Switzerland, who soon after their return home sent a <b>purchasing</b> <b>commission</b> to Austria and were instrumental in founding the Haflinger population in Switzerland. Southern Tyrol had no difficulty in selling its horses, as all of Italy was in the market to purchase horses, and breeding populations spread as far south as Sicily.|$|E

25|$|The first Soviets {{to arrive}} at Cold Bay {{were members of the}} Soviet <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Commission,</b> who disembarked at the base on 23 March 1945. Maxwell {{believed}} that a great deal of classroom training would be necessary before the Soviet personnel began to train at sea, but the Soviet officers disagreed, preferring a greater emphasis on training at sea. They worked for a week on a training program that both sides could agree on, and achieved a successful compromise before the first trainees arrived.|$|E
25|$|The first 220 Soviet {{officers}} and 1,895 enlisted men began training at Cold Bay on 16 April 1945, divided by ship type and then further divided by individual ship assignment.

25|$|On 14 August, Clauson {{issued an}} order {{concerning}} the mandatory requisitioning mules {{for military purposes}} under martial law. From July until November, 2750 mules, 1,200 donkeys and 140 ponies were sent to Salonica. By July 1919, over 3,500 mules and 3,000 had been exported. On 18 October, special legislation banned immigration for Cypriot males of conscription age in order to halt the mass migration of Cypriots to USA. Passports that were already issued were subsequently revoked. A number of rudimentary recruitment posters and leaflets were issued starting from the summer of 1916, the posters were issued in English, Greek and Turkish. Those interested were invited to the recruitment camps situated at Paphos, Limassol, Nicosia, Kyrenia and Famagusta. As of 6 November, 3496 Cypriots had joined the corps in the capacity of muleteers, foremen and interpreters. A crucial factor in the drive's success was the high wages, free food and clothing offered, {{as well as the}} fact that the muleteers were registered as camp followers under the Army Act, a statement that later triggered controversy over the compensation of those killed and injured. In July 1917, the Mule <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Commission</b> was renamed into Muleteer Recruiting and Staff <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Commission,</b> shifting its focus towards the recruiting manpower. During the course of the campaign Cypriot muleteers were tasked with transporting food, weapons, ammunition and water to the front as well as carrying injured soldiers back and working on road construction. The animals and their handlers endured harsh conditions, such as navigating swamps, rivers and mountain terrain during the night and under freezing temperatures.|$|E

They were then relegated for use as airborne wireless radio trainers, along with the contemporary Fleet Fort intermediate trainer in 1943. Prior to service entry, the throttle and engine mixture controls were modified from the system used by the French whereby the throttle was pulled back to increase power, and the mixture control pulled back to lean out the mixture, to the system used on the Harvard. The Yale appeared in the movie Captains of the Clouds.

25|$|On 24 April 1916, the {{commander}} of the British Salonika Army Bryan Mahon stated that for his advance towards the Greco–Serbian frontier to succeed, the recruitment of 1676 pack animals and 1232 muleteers per division was needed. On 24 May, British ambassador to Greece Francis Elliot requested the high commissioner of Cyprus John Eugene Clauson to raise a force of 7,000 Cypriot muleteers to Macedonian Front in order to augment the British Salonika Army. Three days later the British H.Q. in Salonika sent another inquiry, urgently requesting 3,000 Cypriot muleteers. The National Schism in the then neutral Greece had frustrated British efforts to recruit locals from among the pro–Triple Entente faction. With the Greek prime minister Eleftherios Venizelos stating that he could not guarantee that the British would be allowed to continue their recruitment drive. On 24 June, a belated reply from the British War Office ordered Clauson to purchase 2,000 mules and recruit 500 men to command them, this period of inaction drew the criticism of the Colonial Office. On 25 July, the first group of 150 muleteers disembarked at Salonika. On 27 July, 3,000 additional Cypriot muleteers (with a ratio of 1 foreman per 20 muleteers) were urgently solicited for the Macedonian Front. In the meantime a Mule <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Commission</b> had been established in Famagusta under the supervision of major L. Sisman. On 2 August, 796 muleteers arrived at Salonika, 500 joining the XII Corps and 196 the XVI Corps.|$|E
25|$|An early {{issue to}} resolve {{was the matter}} of how to {{transport}} the Soviet Navy personnel to Cold Bay. At the Yalta Conference in February 1945, Kuznetsov initially proposed that Allied merchant ships returning to North America after delivering cargoes in Europe transport Soviet personnel to the United States East Coast, from which the Soviets could travel across the continental United States to the United States West Coast and then by ship to Cold Bay; however, a shortage of Allied shipping in the Pacific made this plan highly problematic. The day after the conference, the Deputy Chairman of the Soviet Government <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Commission,</b> Admiral A. A. Yakimov, proposed that the United States transfer three Liberty ships or similar vessels to Soviet registry, and that these ships carry Soviet personnel to Cold Bay, presumably from ports in the Soviet Far East, but the Allied shipping shortage blocked this idea as well. On 24 February 1945, the Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the U.S. Navy, Vice Admiral Richard S. Edwards, informed Yakimov that transferred motor torpedo boats and two disassembled self-propelled pontoon barges would be shipped aboard Soviet merchant ships from the U.S. West Coast directly to the Soviet Far East, without calling at Cold Bay, reducing the demand on shipping by Soviet personnel requiring transportation to Cold Bay. The Soviets finally decided to transport their personnel to Cold Bay in their own merchant ships while the ships were making their regular voyages to carry Lend-Lease materials from the U.S. West Coast to the Soviet Far East, with each ship carrying about 600 men at a time.|$|E
5000|$|Only {{commissions}} in cavalry and infantry regiments (and therefore {{only those}} {{up to the}} rank of colonel) could be <b>purchased.</b> <b>Commissions</b> in the Royal Engineers and the Royal Artillery were awarded to those who graduated from a course at the Royal Military Academy at Woolwich, and subsequent promotion was by seniority. Such officers (and those of the Army of the British East India Company) were often looked down upon as being [...] "not quite gentlemen" [...] by officers who had <b>purchased</b> their <b>commissions.</b> Nor did the Royal Navy ever practise the sale of commissions, with advancement in officer ranks being solely by merit or seniority (at least in theory).|$|R

John Cookson suggests that serving with the army did command a certain respect, and those men that became the holder of an office [...] "could lay claim to the title of [...] gentleman". Therefore, self-interest, respect and status were enticing prospects for many who were to join the army. Only {{a small proportion of}} officers were from the nobility; in 1809, only 140 officers were peers or peers' sons. A large proportion of officers came from the Militia, and a small number were gentlemen volunteers, who trained and fought as private soldiers but messed with the officers and remained as such until vacancies (without <b>purchase)</b> for <b>commissions</b> became available.|$|R

500|$|On 30 December 1939, Norway sent a <b>purchasing</b> <b>commission</b> to the United States, {{consisting}} of a Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service [...] contingent headed by Cmdr. Kristian Østby, and a Norwegian Army Air Service contingent led by Birger F. Motzfeldt. The goal of the commission was to inspect the Vultee V-11, which {{would serve as a}} new common reconnaissance bomber for the two air services. Amongst the requirements the commission hoped to fill was replacing the Royal Norwegian Navy Air Service's M.F.11 biplane patrol aircraft. Once in the US, the commission found that Vultee {{would not be able to}} deliver the V-11 within a reasonable amount of time so another aircraft had to be found. Motzfeldt quickly found that the Douglas 8A-5N would satisfy the NOAAS' requirements. As the Douglas 8A-5N could not be fitted with floats, Østby continued to look for an aircraft suitable for the RNNAS. After visits to many of the aviation companies in February 1940, Østby determined that only one manufacturer had both a design and available production capacity, Northrop Aircraft Incorporated. The commission ordered 24 floatplanes based on the Model 8-A, renamed the N-3PB, [...] "off the drawing board" [...] (literally, the aircraft being ordered prior to the type having flown) from Northrop on 8 March 1940, at a total cost of [...] to meet this requirement.

2500|$|The {{existence}} of the P-51 Mustang has been credited to Kelsey's dogged determination to see the project to completion. He formulated the specifications for the Curtiss XP-46 and placed an order for two prototypes in September 1939, hoping that the advanced aircraft would replace the P-40 Warhawk which had not demonstrated above-average fighting qualities. Production of the new design was canceled by General Henry [...] "Hap" [...] Arnold as it was anticipated that a four-month delay in Curtiss fighter deliveries would be incurred by the radical change. Kelsey's boss, Colonel Oliver P. Echols, shopped the design to the Anglo-French <b>Purchasing</b> <b>Commission</b> who were told to find an aircraft manufacturer that wasn't busy with war production. Echols and Kelsey made it understood that the NACA airflow research data collected on the XP-46 would {{be made available to}} the new manufacturer. North American Aviation (NAA) expressed interest and was sold the NACA data for $56,000. They produced a new design, the NA-73, which was approved by the British who christened the fighter [...] "Mustang". Echols and Kelsey arranged to get two prototypes out of the British contract, and, on July 7, 1941, even before the prototypes arrived at Wright Field, Kelsey ordered 150 P-51s from NAA. Nine months later Kelsey ordered 500 nearly identical A-36 Apache models {{that he was able to}} purchase with funds intended for attack bombers.|$|E

6000|$|The exigency {{caused by}} the war, moreover, has {{transformed}} the former practice of international intercourse. Co-operation has replaced competition. We are reorganizing and regulating our industries, our business, making sacrifices and preparing to make more sacrifices {{in order to meet}} the needs of our Allies, now that they are sore beset. For a considerable period after the war is ended, they will require our aid. We shall be better off than any other of the belligerent nations, and we shall therefore be called upon to practice, during the years of reconstruction, a continuation of the same policy of helpfulness. Indeed, for the nations of the world to spring, commercially speaking, at one another's throats would be suicidal even if it were possible. Mr. Sidney Webb has thrown a flood of light upon the conditions likely to prevail. For example, speculative export trade is being replaced by collective importing, bringing business more directly under the control of the consumer. This has been done by co-operative societies, by municipalities and states, in Switzerland, France, the United Kingdom, and in Germany. The Co-operative Wholesale Society of Great Britain, acting on behalf of three and a half million families, buys two and a half million dollars of purchases annually. And the Entente nations, in order to avoid competitive bidding, are buying collectively from us, not only munitions of war, but other supplies, while the British Government has made itself the sole importer of such necessities as wheat, sugar, tea, refrigerated meat, wool, and various metals. The French and Italian governments, and also certain neutral states, have done likewise. A <b>purchasing</b> <b>commission</b> for all the Allies and America is now proposed. After the war, as an inevitable result, for one thing, of transforming some thirty million citizens into soldiers, of engaging a like number of men and women at enhanced wages on the manufacture of the requisites of war, Mr. Webb predicts a world shortage not only in wheat and foodstuffs but in nearly all important raw materials. These will be required for the resumption of manufacture. In brief, international co-operation will be the only means of salvation. The policy of international trade implied by world shortage is not founded upon a law of [...] "supply and demand." [...] The necessities cannot be permitted to go to those who can afford to pay the highest prices, but to those who need them most. For the [...] "free play of economic forces" [...] would mean famine on a large scale, because the richer nations and the richer classes within the nations might be fully supplied; but to the detriment and ruin of the world the poorer nations and the poorer classes would be starved. Therefore governments are already beginning to give consideration to a new organization of international trade for at least three years after the war. Now if this organization produce, as it may produce, a more desirable civilization and a happier world order, we are not likely entirely to go back--especially in regard to commodities which are necessities--to a competitive system. The principle of [...] "priority of need" [...] will supersede the law of [...] "supply and demand." [...] And the organizations built up during the war, if they prove efficient, will not be abolished. Hours of labour and wages in the co-operative League of Nations will gradually be equalized, and tariffs will become things of the past. [...] "The axiom will be established," [...] says Mr. Webb, [...] "that the resources of every country must, be held for the benefit not only of its own people but of the world.... The world shortage will, for years to come, make import duties look both oppressive and ridiculous." ...|$|E
