40|$|<b>Pot</b> <b>casts</b> and gutter casts are {{described}} for the ®rst {{time in the}} lower part of the Majanillos Formation, a Middle Triassic carbonate unit located in the External Zones of the Betic Cordillera (southern Spain). Their identi®cation, as well as their relation to tempestites, enables the better interpretation of the depositional environments and the shoreline-to-offshore facies transition on the Anisian muddy carbonate ramp of the southern Iberian Massif. The Majanillos Formation contains three members, which become progressively more marly towards the top. Well-preserved <b>pot</b> and gutter <b>casts</b> and thin intercalations of calcarenite, which are interpreted as tempestites, are abundant in the lowest member. Above the <b>pot</b> and gutter <b>casts,</b> thicker calcarenite beds, which locally contain hummocky cross-strati®cation, predominate. Bioturbated nodular limestones are prevalent at the top of the member. The remaining succession, which records a long-term Triassic transgressive cycle, consists mostly of ®ne-grained limestones deposited in very shallow-marine environments. Calcarenitic sediments only accumulated within potholes and gutters in the nearshore. They developed during storms when strong currents transported sediment to the outer shelf, where it was deposited as tempestite beds. <b>Pot</b> and gutter <b>casts</b> characterize sedimentation in the bypass zone. It is concluded that storm deposits provide important constraints for the interpretation of palaeobathymetry; it is proposed that gutter casts display a trend of increasing width/thickness ratios towards the outer shelf. The identi®cation of these structures in marine successions elsewhere should prove useful in the interpretation of depositional environments...|$|R
25|$|This was {{followed}} by Abraham Darby, who made great strides using coke to fuel his blast furnaces at Coalbrookdale in 1709.

Coke pig iron was hardly used to produce wrought iron in forges until the mid-1750s, when his son Abraham Darby II built Horsehay and Ketley furnaces (not far from Coalbrookdale). By then, coke pig iron was cheaper than charcoal pig iron. Since cast iron was becoming cheaper and more plentiful, it began being a structural material following the building of the innovative Iron Bridge in 1778 by Abraham Darby III.|$|R

40|$|Abstract— Induction heating is a fast, efficient, precise and repeatable {{non-contact}} {{method for}} heating metals or other electrically-conductive materials. Induction cookers are domestically induction heating devices {{which have become}} more popular against gas based cookers and electrical resistance stoves because they are safer and they present higher heating rates and energy efficiency. However the appropriate performance of these devices for induction heating (IH) depends directly on the coupled system cooker-cookware. Differences in the energy efficiency and temperature distribution during heating and cooling {{are related to the}} configuration of the pot and the different materials which those are made of. In case of cooking processes, the natural convection of the different fluids may affect to the microbiology, safety, food quality and cooking times. This study aims to perform the heating analysis in the lateral of three different induction cookware configurations of aluminium, enameled iron and stainless steel body cookware. The experimental data was analyzed using COMSOL Multiphysics in order to understand the thermal processes in the different pots.  These results were compared with the results obtained by a thermographic camera.

50|$|The Old Furnace began life as {{a typical}} blast furnace, but went over to coke in 1709. Abraham Darby I used it to <b>cast</b> <b>pots,</b> kettles and other goods. His {{grandson}} Abraham Darby III smelted the iron {{here for the first}} Ironbridge, the world's first iron bridge.|$|R
5000|$|He also {{developed}} a method for <b>casting</b> <b>pots</b> in 'greensand' moulds, previously only used for smaller castings.

40|$|The Chapel Island Formation, a 1000 m thick shelf {{sequence}} of late Precambrian-Early Cambrian age, is receiving considerable attention {{as a leading}} candidate for the boundary stratotype for the Precambrian-Cambrian boundary. The formation, composed of five informally defined members, has been divided into six facies associations (1 - 6). [...] Facies Association 1 consists of red and green sandstones and shales (Facies 1. 1 / 1. 2), and grey to black, thinly laminated shales and silty shales (Facies 1. 3), deposited in tidally-influenced peritidal and semi-restricted shoreline environments, respectively. [...] Facies Association 2 consists of very thin to medium bedded sandstones and siltstones (Facies 2. 1 / 2. 2) with subordinate green and red laminated siltstones (Facies 2. 3 / 2 / 4), deposited within a muddy deltaic system. Storm-generated sandstones (tempestites), and other storm-related features (e. g., gutter and <b>pot</b> <b>casts),</b> dominate Facies 2. 1 and 2. 2. These facies are also characterized by abundant and diverse slide and gravity-flow features (debrites, turbidites, and liquefied flow deposits) formed under conditions of high sediment supply in a delta front/upper prodelta setting. Thin bedded and laminated siltstones of Facies 2. 3 / 2. 4 form excellent marker horizons and represent delta abandonment facies. [...] Laminated green siltstones of Facies Association 3 are considered outer shelf deposits. Sandstone laminae are interpreted as distal tempestites deposited by waning flows below storm wave base. [...] Facies Association 4 consists of red, green and gray mudstones of inner shelf origin and thing fossiliferous algal limestones deposited in peritidal environments. Deposition took place on a low energy, oxygen-stratified muddy shelf, with the limestone beds forming during low stands of sea level. [...] Facies Associations 5 and 6 were deposited on a storm- and wave-dominated shelf below and above the influence of storm waves, respectively. The thin to medium bedded sandstones and siltstones of Facies Association 5 represent distal tempestites. The planar laminated and hummocky/swaly cross-stratified sandstones of Facies Association 6 represent inner shelf and shoreface environments. [...] The depositional history of the Chapel Island Formation records a shift from tectonically-active fault-bounded basins (underlying Rencontre Formation) to a tectonically-stable platform (overlying Random formation). Three distinct phases of sedimentation have been delineated. Phase 1, corresponding to {{the lower part of}} the formation (members 1 - 3), is a period of relative sea level rise recording a shift from marginal marine environments to delta front;/prodelta settings to the outer shelf. Phase 2, represented by members 3 and 4, is interpreted as a time of dropping relative sea level and low sediment input. Small scale relative sea level changes are recorded by variations in color, sedimentary and biogenic structures, diagenetic features and the deposition of thin peritidal limestone beds. Phase 3 (member 5) is a period of rapid deepening followed by shallowing with the progradation of a storm- and wave-dominated shelf. This phase, recording high sediment influx and strong storm and wave influence, is associated with major uplift and re-orientation of the shoreline from the southwest to the northeast...|$|R

Solders have low surface tension and high wetting capability. There are many types of solders, each used for different applications. Such as Lead-Silver for strength at higher than room temperature. Tin-Lead is used for General Purpose; Tin-Zinc is used for Aluminum; Cadmium-Silver is used for strength at high temperatures; Zinc-Aluminum is used for Aluminum and corrosion resistance; Tin-Silver and Tin-Bismuth is used for Electronics. Because of the toxicity of lead, lead-free solders are being developed and more widely used.

40|$|As many {{soils are}} unable to supply {{sufficient}} amounts of phosphorus (P) to plants, P availability is often a growth-limiting factor. Literature shows that levels of readily available P can be considerably higher in earthworm casts than in the surrounding bulk soil, possibly resulting in increased plant P uptake. However, the underlying mechanisms through which this increase of readily available P occurs are unclear. In a greenhouse pot experiment with annual ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum) on a soil with low P availability, we tested whether {{the presence of the}} anecic earthworm Lumbricus terrestris resulted in increased grass growth and P uptake and explored the possible mechanisms behind such an effect. During the <b>pot</b> experiment, earthworm <b>casts</b> were collected and analysed for water-extractable P as well as for most other relevant ions. The earthworm's presence significantly increased grass yield from 9. 80 to 10. 80 g dry matter per pot (p = 0. 044) and P uptake from 6. 32 to 8. 04 mg per pot (p = 0. 002). Due to increased microbial activity, the solution chemistry in the water extracts of the casts was dramatically changed compared to the bulk soil samples. The concentrations of dissolved inorganic P in cast were enhanced by a factor ~ 30 – 1000 compared to the levels found in bulk soil. The pH in earthworm casts increased from 5. 9 to values between 7. 4 and 9. 0 and the Ca concentrations decreased by about a factor ~ 2 - 3 compared to bulk soil samples. In addition, there was an increase in dissolved organic carbon (35 mg L − 1 in casts versus 3 mg L − 1 in soil). Surface complexation modelling, using the Charge Distribution model, suggests that, besides an increase in pH, particularly an enhanced interaction of dissolved organic matter with reactive surface of metal (hydr) oxides {{is likely to be a}} major driving force for the augmented release of orthophosphate (PO 4) via competitive adsorption and desorption. This competition for adsorption sites is an alternative pathway, next to mineralisation of organic matter, through which earthworms can increase soil fertility. </p...|$|R
