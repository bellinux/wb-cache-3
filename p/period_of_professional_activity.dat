40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the effect of}} chromium(VI) (Cr(VI)) on human health under conditions of acute and chronic exposure in the workplace. Chromium(VI) compounds as carcinogens and/or mutagens pose a direct danger to people exposed to them. If carcinogens cannot be eliminated from the work and living environments, their exposure should {{be reduced to a}} minimum. In the European Union the proposed binding occupational exposure limit value (BOELV) for chromium(VI) of 0. 025 mg/m³ is still associated with high cancer risk. Based on the Scientific Commitee of Occupational Exposure Limits (SCOEL) document chromium(VI) concentrations at 0. 025 mg/m³ increases the risk of lung cancer in 2 – 14 cases per 1000 exposed workers. Exposure to chromium(VI) compounds expressed in Cr(VI) of 0. 01 mg Cr(VI) /m 3 is responsible for the increased number of lung cancer cases in 1 – 6 per 1000 people employed in this condition for the whole <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>activity.</b> Med Pr 2015; 66 (3) : 407 – 42...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: Early {{diagnosis}} of oral Squamous Cell Carcinoma (OSCC) needs the {{knowledge about the}} disease and keeping it during the <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>activity.</b> This study aimed to compare general dentists and dental interns regarding their knowledge about OSCC in Yazd in 2012. Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was performed on 110 general dentists and 23 dental interns in Yazd (a city in Iran) in 2012 via utilizing a questionnaire. Statistical {{analysis of the data}} was carried out using ANOVA and Fisher's exact test. Results: The results of this study indicated, that although the level of interns' knowledge (8. 93 out of 20) was significantly higher (P< 0. 001) compared to that of general dentists (5. 99 out of 20), both groups revealed poor level of knowledge (5 - 9. 99). As a matter of fact, with an increase in the years of graduation, the mean awareness of general dentists significantly (P= 0. 001) decreased. Moreover, there was no significant relationship between the subjects' knowledge and gender (P= 0. 671), attending re-education courses (P= 0. 864) and the type of university (P= 0. 868). Conclusion: The results of this study showed that reconsidering the education issues for the dental students seems more important than revising re-education courses for the dentists...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{considers}} {{changes in}} occupational {{medicine in the}} last fifty years, describes industrial hygienists tasks and the reasons why their activities grew in importance. Also the needs of compliance with their own professional Code of Ethics are discussed. The Universal Declaration of Human Rights, voted and accepted by the United Nations in 1948 changed the strategic target of occupational medicine. Since then the most important task became prevention of health damage caused by work, which should enable the employees to stay healthy throughout the whole <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>professional</b> <b>activity.</b> Before that the main target was to restore the health of employees injured by work. To make the used preventive measures to be effective, they must be selected appropriately to professional harmfulness posing threat to employees health. This requires to reveal all factors potentially harmful to health, which occur in the work-environment, to measure their concentrations or intensity, to determine the employees exposure to those factors and to estimate {{the level of the}} health risk, caused by this complex exposure. Contemporarily occupational medicine service encompass with its preventive supervision the municipal environments, because they become seriously polluted due to emission of harmful industrial pollutants what brings about a negative impact to health of exposed dwellers. Those activities, being to a large extent outside the scope of competence and tasks of doctors – specialists of occupational medicine, are performed by industrial hygienists, who the required knowledge and skills acquired during university studies on technical and natural faculties. This caused a substantial increase of the role of industrial hygienists in the present activity of occupational medicine service and simultaneously took into consideration the ethical aspects of the work of these professionals. Evaluation of the backbone and the scope of work drew attention not only to the need to follow ethical principles mandatory for everybody working in occupational medicine service but also to the need to have and respect their own ethical code taking into account the specificity of activities and undertaken tasks in this profession...|$|E

He gradually abandoned Modernisme, adopting a personal, eclectic Classical style. In 1911 {{he won the}} competition to design the Real Club Marítimo in Barcelona (built between 1911 and 1913), an octagonal building roofed by a dome and topped by a sort of lighthouse; it was demolished in 1957. In 1912 he began to build the French Chapel in Carrer Bruc, with a crypt divided into three aisles and an upper church in neo-Romanesque style, finished in 1927 probably by his son Josep Maria. Also in 1912 he built the palatial residence of the marquis of Alella, {{on the corner of}} the streets of Muntaner and Marià Cubí, a group of buildings in a style influenced by Plateresque, with paintings by Josep Maria Sert.|$|R
40|$|The rhetoric, eristic and {{negotiating}} competences of lawyers develop {{through the whole}} <b>period</b> <b>of</b> their <b>professional</b> <b>activity.</b> Skills <b>of</b> rhetoric and eristic are of key importance {{not only in the}} courtroom but also in other profession-related situations, for instance in negotiations. Therefore, {{it is important to note}} that eristic is present in judicial as well as non-judicial legal practice. Every person who participates in a communication process on a daily basis applies many eristic methods, although in most cases stays unaware of that fact, does it intuitively. It is crucial, however, when acting professionally, not to act intuitively but in accordance with acquired and deeply-rooted knowledge. This should then help not only in a more effective application of eristic in one’s own actions, but, above all, in foiling eristic actions of the opponent in a dispute. The paper is an attempt to explain the contemporary status of eristic, particularly in its relation to rhetoric, as well as to point to the ethic controversy concerning its application which proves to be a very important issue especially in a courtroom situation. Finally, the paper provides examples that illustrate the actual extent of eristic application in legal practice. As far as the subject is concerned, Die eristische Dialektyk by Arthur Schopenhauer is frequently cited in the paper because its contemporary practical meaning cannot be ignored...|$|R
40|$|Tom C. Clark {{served at}} the pinnacles of the American legal {{profession}} for {{nearly a quarter of}} a century as Attorney General from 1945 to 1949 and Supreme Court Justice from 1949 to 1967. He filed the first amicus curiae brief for the United States in a civil rights case, and he wrote decisions that are true landmarks in the jurisprudence of criminal law and church-state relations. Yet it is arguable that Justice Clark’s greatest contribution to the shaping of a field of law was made after he left the Court in 1967, when his son Ramsey was appointed Attorney General by Lyndon B. Johnson. During that ten-year <b>period</b> <b>of</b> robust <b>professional</b> <b>activity,</b> Justice Clark served as the first Director of the Federal Judicial Center, headed the implementation of the ABA Standards for Criminal Justice, chaired the newly created Supreme Court Fellows Program, sat as an appellate judge on every federal circuit, and even tried cases as a federal trial judge. Most importantly, as an ex-Justice, Clark lent his considerable talent, prestige, and energy to the work of the American Bar Association Special Committee (now known as the “Clark Committee”) which conducted a thorough review of lawyer discipline. That Committee issued a report (the “Clark Report” or “Report”) that proved transformative in its effect. The Report was the starting point in a revolution which, over ensuing decades, has wholly reshaped the field of legal ethics...|$|R
