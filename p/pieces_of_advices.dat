40|$|Se realizó la presente Investigación con el enfoque Cualitativo, y de Nivel Exploratorio. Nace como producto de ejercer la Consejería en el Consultorio de CETSS a las denominadas “TRABAJADORAS SEXUALES”, viendo que la intervención de Enfermería se enmarcaba en lo preventivo-promocional, diagnóstico precoz y tratamiento oportuno de ETS, más no se indagaba el lado “persona”-“ser humano” de estas mujeres ni se buscaba una reorientación de sus vidas. Este tipo de investigación incrementa y enriquece el marco teórico referente a este problema social para su {{posterior}} utilización en el desarrollo de nuevas investigaciones en el ámbito de ENFERMERIA. Se empleó el Método HISTORIA DE VIDA a través de Entrevistas a Profundidad en el Centro de Salud Materno Infantil “Tahuantinsuyo Bajo” a ocho mujeres que ejercen el trabajo sexual. El objetivo fue conocer y describir la {{historia de}} vida de estas mujeres. La entrevistas fueron grabadas, luego transcritas a textos. Las categorías emergentes fueron: Sucesos claves en sus relaciones familiares; CONTEXTO FAMILIAR inmediato en su inicio como trabajadora sexual; Sentimientos y Reacciones Emocionales en el Ejercicio del trabajo sexual; y PROYECTO DE VIDA de las trabajadoras sexuales. Y como subcategorías: Disfuncionalidad y Desintegración Familiar. Entre las Consideraciones Finales tenemos: estas mujeres presentan una vida en la cual predomina la Disfuncionalidad y Desintegración Familiar, Violencia de Genero, llevando a una alteración de la identidad personal y de la autoestima. Ejercen la responsabilidad familiar de su hogar y de la familia de procreación, presentan un nivel educativo bajo, falta de oportunidades y falta de ingresos seguros, estables y suficientes; convirtiéndose en factores que influyen pero que no son causas para su ingreso al trabajo sexual; la defino entonces como una actividad de sobre vivencia. Establecen una relación instrumental e impersonal con sus clientes expresando temor, miedo y vergüenza. No tienen un proyecto de vida convergente a todas ellas. Pero mas allá de ello, son personas, seres humanos que tienen sentimientos, piensan, teniendo por detrás todo una vida con profundas huellas. Palabras Claves: Trabajadora Sexual, Enfermería, Historia de Vida y Proyecto de Vida. [...] - This research {{was made with}} the Qualitative Forus, and the Exploratory. It was born {{as a result of}} the neassity of give <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>advices</b> to the sexual workers in the Advice Program of sexual Transmitión deseases and AIDS. The interventión of nursery partook onley in the preventión-promotión activities, the precocious diagnosis and the timely treatment of the sexual transmitión diseases and AIDS and did not work with the personal side of those women avoiding also the re orientatión of their lifes. This kind of research increases the theory about this social problem, and also it becomes a important tool for nevo researches in Neusery.
