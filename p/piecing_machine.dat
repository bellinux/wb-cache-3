The open numerical controller provides an opportunity to access the signals of servo drivers during the machining process and makes the online monitoring of the machining process realizable. In this paper, a novel online evaluation method of the work <b>piece</b> <b>machining</b> error is proposed based on homogeneous coordinate transformation and built-in signal testing technology. A gear grinding process is monitored experimentally, and it is shown that the proposed method is effective at detecting work <b>piece</b> <b>machining</b> errors...|$|R

40|$|Electrical {{discharge}} machining (EDM) {{is one of}} the processing methods based on non-traditional manufacturing procedures. It is gaining increased popularity, since it does not require cutting tools and allows machining of hard, brittle and intricate geometries. In recent years, EDM researchers have explored a number of ways to improve the surface state of work <b>pieces</b> <b>machined</b> using EDM. In the present paper, roughness value of work <b>pieces</b> <b>machined</b> under the influence of varied magnetic intensities, peak current and pulse durations is investigated. A new laboratory setup, incorporating Nd-magnets, is created to carry out the experiments together with a TOOLCRAFT A 25 EDM. Empirical modeling has been carried out to establish a mathematical relationship between the roughness and the machining parameters. Optimum settings have been identified that produce lowest roughness values. Results indicated that the presence of a magnetic field in the spark gap region increases the surface roughness of the <b>machined</b> work <b>piece.</b> Surface roughness of work piece was also noted to be highly influenced by current and pulse on-time. Higher values of these parameters increased surface roughness. Low magnetic intensity, lower current, lower pulse-on time and relatively higher pulse pause time produced a better surface finish...|$|R

40|$|High speed turning (HST) is an {{approach}} {{that can be used}} to increase the material removal rate (MRR) by higher cutting speed. Increasing MRR will lead to shortening time to market. In contrast, increasing the cutting speed will lead to increasing the flank wear rate and then the tooling cost.   However, the main factor that will justify the best level of cutting speed is the tooling cost which merges all in one understandable measurable factor for manufacturer.

40|$|A CNC {{machine tool}} {{performance}} {{depends on the}} machine accuracy status which {{is very important to}} determine the end product compliance to the specification. The accuracy of the machine can be measured and analyzed; hence the errors' impact can be predicted on a workpiece. This paper presents three types of accuracy tests performed on a CNC Vertical Machining Centre, how the accuracy status affect the end product quality and what are the corrective actions to be taken. First, the laser test to determine the linear positioning accuracy, second the ball bar test to determine the circularity accuracy and third, the static accuracy test to determine the machine current static accuracy status and finally the cutting test to determine the actual machine accuracy effect on a work <b>piece.</b> <b>Machine</b> tool's errors can be diagnosed and minimize or eliminated by either electronic compensation or mechanical maintenance and sometimes both need to be done.

Depending on the product range being processed, a given workplace is the bottleneck only for some period of time. When the bottleneck moves to another workplace, it leads to unnecessary loss of capacity of the fl oating bottleneck. To maximize the utilization, it is necessary to protect those bottlenecks by creating special buff ers.

The integration between both technologies allows us to develop new hybrid architecture capable to reduce the computational time in the deliberative layers fundamentally.

50|$|Weight on bit is {{provided}} by drill collars, which are thick-walled tubular <b>pieces</b> <b>machined</b> from solid bars of steel, usually plain carbon steel but sometimes of nonmagnetic nickel-copper alloy or other nonmagnetic premium alloys. Gravity acts on the large mass of the collars to provide the downward force needed for the bits to efficiently break rock. To accurately control the amount of force applied to the bit, the driller carefully monitors the surface weight measured while the bit is just off {{the bottom of the}} wellbore. Next, the drillstring (and the drill bit), is slowly and carefully lowered until it touches bottom. After that point, as the driller continues to lower the top of the drillstring, more and more weight is applied to the bit, and correspondingly less weight is measured as hanging at the surface. If the surface measurement shows 20,000 pounds kg less weight than with the bit off bottom, then there should be 20,000 pounds force on the bit (in a vertical hole). Some downhole MWD sensors can measure weight-on-bit more accurately and transmit the data to the surface.|$|R
