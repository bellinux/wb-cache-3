40|$|This {{study has}} the general {{objective}} of comparing the {{profiles of the}} tobacco <b>planters</b> with the non-tobacco <b>planters</b> to identify the determining factors of the production value {{to each of these}} groups, in the three Southern states of Brazil. As for methodology, this study has a descriptive and explanatory focus, using cause and effect that, with the use of statistical resources, aims to verify the relationships between variables in a group of 758 tobacco <b>planters</b> and 384 non-tobacco <b>planters</b> in the Brazilian southern regions. It is verified that the tobacco <b>planters,</b> when compared to the non-tobacco <b>planters,</b> present lower averages to the variables related to infrastructure and natural resources. They also present lower averages on the vegetal production activities (except for tobacco) and animal production, being under the averages scored by the non-tobacco <b>planters.</b> As to the impact analysis among the non-tobacco <b>planters,</b> a higher impact is checked, in statistical terms, on the total of production means over the Total Value of Production. Among the non-tobacco <b>planters,</b> on the other hand, the improvement total variable is the one that generates a bigger impact over the dependant variable...|$|R
