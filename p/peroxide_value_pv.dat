Thus, astaxanthin degradation and lipid oxidation in shrimp oil were augmented at high temperature. When shrimp oils with different storage conditions (illumination, oxygen availability and temperature) were stored {{for up to}} 40  days, astaxanthin contents in all samples decreased throughout storage (p <  0.05).

The content of total phenolics in the extracts was determined spectrometrically {{according to the}} Folin-Ciocalteu procedure and calculated as gallic acid equivalents. Antioxidant activity of methanolic extracts was determined by using the Oven (63 °C) and Rancimat (90, 120, 150 °C) methods on refined soybean oil and compared {{with the effects of}} synthetic antioxidants (BHA, BHT and TBHQ). <b>Peroxide</b> <b>values</b> and 2 -thiobarbituric acid values were used to assess lipid peroxidation.

The flavonoid depletion was monitored during the autoxidation with high-performance liquid chromatography-diode array detector (HPLC-DAD) analysis. The fully substituted C-ring was established as the most significant element for maximal antioxidant activity; quercetin even decreased k by 86 % in comparison with the control and presented the highest decrease of PV per mmole of antioxidant. Flavonoids missing the 2, 3 -double bond or the 3 -OH (taxifolin, luteolin) resulted in a smaller decrease of k, and the lack of both of the above structural elements (eriodictyol) resulted in the smallest decrease. Lack of the 4 -carbonyl in the C-ring had the least negative effect on antioxidant activity since (+) -catechin presented the strongest protection after quercetin and fisetin.

Fatty acid levels of the diets increased between the initial and final samplings and the increase was higher (8. 4 %) in diets without BHT stored at 40 Â°C after 10 weeks. <b>Peroxide</b> <b>values</b> of the extracted lipids were low and fluctuated monthly between 2. 2 and 7. 4 mmol/kg fat. MAL levels increased in diets {{with and without}} BHT except those stored at 10 Â°C for 4 weeks. Diets with BHT stored at 10 Â°C had the lowest (8. 7 mg MAL/kg fat) MAL levels and diets without BHT stored at 40 Â°C for 10 weeks had the highest (16. 9 mg MAL/kg fat). Shrimp fed diets with BHT gained 5. 7 â€“ 6. 4 Ã— their initial weight after 10 weeks of rearing. Their growth was significantly better than those fed diets without BHT (4 â€“ 6 Ã—) during the 60 -day culture period. Survival was significantly higher in those fed diets with BHT (87 â€“ 88 %) than those without BHT (75 â€“ 85 %). No hepatopancreatic lesions were seen in shrimp samples fed diets with and without BHT and stored at various temperatures. The incorporation of BHT in shrimp feed is necessary if the feed is to be stored at 40 Â°C for 10 weeks.

40|$|Excerpt] Olive oil is {{a highly}} {{appreciated}} food product due to sensory and healthy attributes, being quite prone to frauds. So, physicochemical evaluation of olive oils is legally required. In this study, 43 olive oil samples produced in Tunisia from different olive cultivars (groups: Sahli cv – 11 samples; Chetoui cv- 26 samples; and, Other cvs – 4 samples including Leguim cv and Arbequina cv) were physicochemically evaluated taking into account: (i) free acidity (FA), K 232 and K 270 extinction coefficients, K, and, <b>peroxide</b> <b>values</b> (<b>PV),</b> required for quality level classification (i. e., extra-virgin, virgin and lampante olive oil: EVOO, VOO and LOO); and (ii) other useful data for olive oil overall characterization (total phenols (TP); antioxidant capacity (DPPH); and, oxidative stability (OS)). Based on the levels found for FA, PV and extinction coefficients (K 232, K 270 and K), the 43 olive oils were classified as: EVOO (4 samples), VOO (5 samples) and LOO (33 samples).

40|$|Abstract: The {{aim of this}} {{research}} was to study the possibility for preservation of catfish fat by using sesame cake extracts (SCE) as a source of natural antioxidants. The SCEs were obtained by extraction of black and white sesame cakes with methanol. Catfish (Pangasius hypophthalmus) fat was mixed with the black and white SCE at different concentrations and stored at room temperature (RT) and 60 o C, in comparison with the synthetic antioxidant –BHT at concentration of 200 ppm. The results showed that the total phenolic content (TPC) in black SCE was 1386. 3 ± 89. 6 mgGAE/ 100 g dw (dry weight) and in white SCE 1318. 5 ± 68. 7 mgGAE/ 100 g dw. The free-radical scavenging capacity, determined by the 1, 1 -diphenyl- 2 -picrylhydrazyl (DPPH) free-radical scavenging assay, of the black and white SCE were significantly lower than that of BHT and ascorbic acid. The IC 50 values of the black, white SCE samples, BHT and ascorbic acid were 817, 833, 31 and 7 mg/L, respectively. However, both the white and black SCE showed a strong effect on retarding lipid oxidation in catfish fat, which was comparable to that of BHT at 200 ppm. The free fatty acid <b>values</b> (FFA) and <b>peroxide</b> <b>values</b> (<b>PV)</b> of the catfish fat samples treated with the black and white SCEs at a concentration of 400 ppm, were lower than 6. 0 mg KOH/g fat and 16 meq/kg fat, respectively, when stored at both room temperature and 60 o C up to 42 days...|$|R
