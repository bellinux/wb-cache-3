New rounds are played until a <b>player</b> <b>or</b> pair reaches the game points goal (three and six point games are the most common). When the number is reached the <b>player</b> <b>or</b> pair wins.|$|E

5|$|Among {{the other}} races {{developed}} were Grunts, or Unggoy (from the planet Balaho), viewed in game's fiction as cannon fodder. Depicted as squat and cowardly fighters, Grunts panic and run if a <b>player</b> <b>or</b> an NPC kills their leaders.|$|E
5|$|Since the {{inception}} of the Terrible Towel, numerous opposing teams, mascots, and players have shown disrespect or have defaced the Terrible Towel, and every such instance has resulted in some form of a negative consequence to the team or <b>player</b> <b>or</b> both.|$|E

5|$|A {{technical}} foul {{requires that the}} defenceman who fouled a player on the opposing team {{be placed in the}} penalty box for 30 seconds. As with a personal foul, until the penalty time expires, no replacement for the player is allowed and the team must play one man short. The <b>player</b> (<b>or</b> a replacement) is allowed to reenter the game once the time in the penalty box is over and the team is thus once again at full strength.|$|E
5|$|Beyond: Two Souls is an {{interactive}} drama action-adventure game, requiring the player {{to move and}} guide the character into interactions with objects and other non-player characters in the scene to progress the story. The player primarily controls Jodie through the in-game environments. At almost any time, however, the <b>player</b> (<b>or</b> second player during a two-player game) can switch to control Aiden instead. Aiden, as an incorporeal entity, exists permanently in noclip mode and can move through walls, ceilings, and other obstacles; however, he is limited to moving only within a certain radius around Jodie due to their spiritual tethering.|$|E
5|$|Blue and Red Landers, {{recurring}} {{characters in}} many Compile games, increase the player's maximum life and power chip capacities, respectively. Blue Landers play multiple roles in The Guardian Legend. Some {{of them are}} not items but non-player characters that dispense advice to the <b>player</b> <b>or</b> exchange upgrades for power chips; others provide a password that allows the player to resume the game at a later time with their progress retained. These Blue Landers also serve as checkpoints; players can restart their game in these designated rooms after being defeated provided the system has not been turned off.|$|E

5|$|In {{association}} football, kit (also {{referred to}} as strip or soccer uniform) is the standard equipment and attire worn by players. The sport's Laws of the Game specify the minimum kit which a player must use, and also prohibit the use of anything that is dangerous to either the <b>player</b> <b>or</b> another participant. Individual competitions may stipulate further restrictions, such as regulating the size of logos displayed on shirts and stating that, {{in the event of}} a match between teams with identical or similar colours, the away team must change to different coloured attire.|$|E
5|$|Looking {{to avoid}} another relegation battle, Allardyce {{made a number}} of signings in {{preparation}} for the 2003–04 season, the most significant of which were Brazilian defender Emerson Thome, Greece international Stelios Giannakopoulos, and target-man striker Kevin Davies. Allardyce's side finished eighth in the league and reached the League Cup final, in what was his first major domestic final appearance as a <b>player</b> <b>or</b> manager. Bolton lost 2–1 to Middlesbrough in the final, though Allardyce blamed referee Mike Riley for not giving a late penalty for an alleged handball by Ugo Ehiogu.|$|E
5|$|Nashville has honored two of {{its players}} by {{retiring}} their uniform numbers. When a number is retired, only the player with the retired number can wear that number if {{he returns to the}} team as a <b>player</b> <b>or</b> coach. This ensures that the number will be associated with one player of particular importance to the team. Nashville displays its retired numbers {{on the front of the}} press box at First Tennessee Park.|$|E
50|$|A tennis {{tournament is}} {{organized}} into matches between players (for singles tournaments) or teams of two players (for doubles tournaments). Very often the tournament {{takes the form}} of a knockout tournament consisting of several rounds. In round 1, all <b>players</b> (<b>or</b> teams) are paired (assuming there are no byes) and play a match against each other. The losers are eliminated, and take no further part in the tournament (this is single elimination). The winners are again paired to matches in the next round. The tournament continues until the quarterfinal round (having eight <b>players</b> <b>or</b> teams playing a total of four matches), then the semifinal round (four <b>players</b> <b>or</b> teams, two matches), and finally the final round (with just two <b>players</b> <b>or</b> teams) is played. The winner of the final round is declared the winner of the entire tournament.|$|R

5|$|One of the {{above-mentioned}} exceptions was a 1986 {{release of the}} film for the now-obsolete VHD video disc system (not {{to be confused with}} LaserDisc). This required a special 3D VHD <b>player,</b> <b>or</b> a standard VHD player with a hardware 3D adapter, and a set of LCD glasses that shuttered the viewer's eyes according to control signals sent by the player, allowing the polarised 3D effect to work. The other exception was the Sensio 3D DVD of Jaws 3-D released in February 2008. The Sensio 3D Processor is needed for 3D home viewing.|$|E
5|$|The Bruce Coulter Award {{was first}} awarded in 1992 and is {{dependent}} on what position {{the winner of the}} Ted Morris Trophy played. If the winner is from the offence, then the Bruce Coulter Award winner will be the most outstanding defensive <b>player</b> <b>or</b> vice versa. It was named after Bruce Coulter, long-time Head Coach at Bishop's University and former offensive and defensive player with the Montreal Alouettes in the 1950s. Coulter was inducted as a builder in the Canadian Football Hall of Fame in 1997.|$|E
5|$|The Nintendo 64 version {{features}} two game types: Deathmatch or Team Deathmatch, {{where the}} objective is to kill as many opposing players as possible; and Frag Tag, in which one random player is transformed into a monkey with no attacks and very little health. The monkey's task is to go to a specific point to return to their normal form and transform another random player into the monkey. Players gain points by killing the monkey and lose points if they die as the monkey. The Microsoft Windows version features three game types: Rok Match, which is the same as Deathmatch; Arena, where two players or teams must battle against each other in an arena setting. The winning <b>player</b> <b>or</b> team will have to face a new opponent. If the <b>player</b> <b>or</b> team loses, they will have to get in line and wait for their next turn to fight again; and Capture the Flag, where the goal is to capture opposing flags and return it to a team's base.|$|E

The Pre-Season Cup competition is not included as well as friendly matches and the clubs intermittent, pre-season Translink Cup. The Roar have had several players compete for them who have been capped at international level including a number for Australia. This includes the former record-holder for goals for the Australian national team, Damian Mori.|$|E
5|$|A {{specialist}} {{was hired}} to enhance the game's artificial intelligence and give enemies more lifelike behaviour. In previous Tomb Raider games, enemies would simply run at Lara and attack immediately, whereas in Tomb Raider III, enemies can pop {{out of the dark}} and attack the <b>player,</b> <b>or</b> retreat back into the level and regroup to attack later. A stealth element partially inspired by Rare's 1997 hit GoldenEye 007 was also introduced, giving players the option of sneaking around and avoid detection. New vehicles that are critical to complete certain levels were added; the team also experimented with the idea of putting Lara on horseback, but they ultimately discarded it. The development of the game took eleven months to complete, and incorporating all the new ideas into the engine was considered the most difficult task of the project.|$|E
