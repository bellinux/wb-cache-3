500|$|Mating occurs belly to belly. Dolphins {{have been}} {{observed}} engaging in intercourse when the females are not in their estrous cycles and cannot produce young, suggesting they may mate for pleasure. The gestation <b>period</b> <b>averages</b> 12 months. Births can occur {{at any time of}} year, although peaks occur in warmer months. The young are born in shallow water, sometimes assisted by a (possibly male) [...] "midwife", and usually only a single calf is born. Twins are possible, but rare. Newborn bottlenose dolphins are [...] long and weigh , with Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin infants being generally smaller than common bottlenose dolphin infants. To accelerate nursing, the mother can eject milk from her mammary glands. The calf suckles for 18 months to up to 8 years, and continues to closely associate with its mother for several years after weaning. Females sexually mature at ages 5–13, males at ages 9–14. Females reproduce every two to six years. Georgetown University professor Janet Mann argues the strong personal behavior among male calves is about bond formation and benefits the species in an evolutionary context. She cites studies showing these dolphins as adults are inseparable, and that early bonds aid protection, as well as in locating females.|$|E

The ALAP algorithm postpones the execution of tasks as long as possible, and it generates massive free time, so both the <b>average</b> busy <b>period</b> and idle period are minimum. However, {{with the increase of}} the number of tasks, the average overhead of the ALAP algorithm increases obviously. The ASAP algorithm executes tasks as soon as possible, and it is equal to the scheduling of fixed-priority preemption. Our algorithm is based on fixed-priority preemption, and increases the threshold of preemption, so it has similar <b>average</b> busy <b>period,</b> <b>average</b> idle <b>period,</b> and <b>average</b> overhead to the ASAP algorithm. In addition, with the introduction of preemption threshold, our algorithm avoids the tasks with high priorities preempted, while keeping these tasks finished in time.
