50|$|One {{application}} in which <b>pressure</b> <b>exchangers</b> {{are widely used}} is reverse osmosis (RO). In an RO system, <b>pressure</b> <b>exchangers</b> are used as energy recovery devices (ERDs). As illustrated, high-pressure concentrate from the membranes C is directed 3 to the ERD D. The ERD uses this high-pressure concentrate stream to pressurize the low-pressure seawater stream (stream 1 becomes stream 4), which it then merges (with {{the aid of a}} circulation pump B) into the highest-pressure seawater stream created by the high-pressure pump A. This combined stream feeds the membranes C. The concentrate leaves the ERD at low pressure 5, expelled by the incoming feedwater flow 1. <b>Pressure</b> <b>exchangers</b> save energy in these systems by reducing the load on the high pressure pump. In a seawater RO system operating at a 40% membrane water recovery rate, the ERD supplies 60% of the membrane feed flow. Energy is consumed by the circulation pump, however, because this pump merely circulates and does not pressurize water, its energy consumption is almost negligible: less than 3% of the energy consumed by the high pressure pump. Therefore, nearly 60% of the membrane feed flow is pressurized with almost no energy input.|$|R

30|$|Significant {{reductions}} in energy demand for SWRO {{have been demonstrated}} recently in the Affordable Desalination Collaboration project (Truby 2008). Using state-of-the-art SWM RO with isobaric <b>pressure</b> <b>exchangers,</b> the energy {{has been reduced to}} as low as 1.58  kWh/m 3, down from the more typical 3  kWh/m 3. It is of interest to note that the minimum water cost occurs at a recovery of about 50 % whereas the minimum energy, and thus minimum GHG impact, occurs at a recovery of about 40 %. In other words, GHG minimization comes at a capital cost penalty for SWRO: a paradigm shift may be needed to adopt GHG minimization as the new optimum. There could also be opportunities for further energy reduction if novel super permeability RO membranes under development are used optimally. For example, {{it may be possible to}} reduce energy using a ‘close to osmotic pressure’ strategy with a multistage process, inter-stage booster pumps and energy recovery devices. Energy savings of about 30 % could be feasible.|$|R

40|$|Batch {{reverse osmosis}} (BRO) systems may enable a {{significant}} reduction in energy consumption for desalination and water reuse. BRO systems operate with variable pressure, by applying only slightly more pressure than is needed to overcome the osmotic pressure and produce reverse water flux. This study explains, quantifies, and optimizes the energy-saving performance of realistic batch designs implemented using <b>pressure</b> <b>exchangers</b> and unpressurized tanks. The effects of additional design parameters such as feed tank volume {{at the end of the}} cycle, volume of water in the pipes, per-pass recovery, cycle operating time, and cycle reset time on the performance of BRO are captured. Loss mechanisms including hydraulic pressure drop and concentration polarization as well as friction and mixing in the energy recovery devices are considered. At low cycle-reset time (10 % of productive time) and low piping volumes (12 % of volume inside membrane elements), about 13 % energy savings is possible compared to a continuous system operating at the same overall pure water productivity. Under these conditions, we also show that the ideal per-pass recovery is close to 50 %, similar to single-stage RO. This recovery reduces the need for system redesign with additional pressure vessels in parallel, contrary to predictions in the literature. The projected savings in terms of the overall cost of water is around 3 %. Additionally, advanced ultra-permeable membranes, such as those based on graphene or graphene oxide, are expected to lead to more significant energy savings in BRO than in single-stage RO...|$|R

40|$|The {{use of a}} <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanger,</b> or wave rotor, in an air-cycle air {{conditioner}} is examined {{as an alternative to}} vapor-compression cycles which use chloroflourocarbons (CFC's), hydrochlorofluorocarbons (HCFC's) and hydrofluorocarbons (HFC's). In a <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanger,</b> expansion and normal shock waves are the mechanisms which transfer energy from a high pressure gas, by expanding it, to a low pressure gas, by compressing it. The device consists of a rotor which is divided into cells and a stator end-plate which controls inflow and outflow. A one-dimensional, homentropic unsteady numerical model was developed using the method of characteristics to simulate the flow through one cell. By entering the inlet and outlet pressures, the locations of the high pressure inlet and outlet ports and the low pressure inlet and outlet ports are calculated based on flow conditions. The mass flow rate through the system {{and the size of the}} rotor are also determined. Besides the <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanger,</b> an air-to-air heat exchanger and air compressor are necessary to develop an air conditioning cycle. These components can be arranged into six configurations of which two are superior to the rest. One configuration consists of the <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanger</b> and compressor working in parallel to raise room air to a higher pressure and temperature so that the heat can be transferred outside. In the other configuration, room air is compressed in stages, first by the <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanger</b> and then by the compressor with heat exchangers located after each compression stage. Six configurations of these components can provide cooling. Three involve expanding outside air below atmospheric pressure to absorb heat from the cooled space. These are not practical because of variability due to outside ambient humidity, high outlet temperatures for cool air to prevent frosting, and high volumetric flow rates of air. Of the three systems which compress room air to extract energy, the configuration with the <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanger</b> and compressor operating in parallel exhibited slightly better performance than the two configurations where the <b>pressure</b> <b>exchanger</b> and compressor compress the air in series...|$|E

In this study, it is projected that 25. 6 - 40. 7 millionkWh/day of energy can be recovered globally, if the brines from SWRO are used as the draw solution and diluted to the seawater level in a PRO system. Detailed integrated SWRO-PRO processes are developed in this study with the option to form a closed-loop SWRO-PRO process that can substantially reduce the pretreatment cost of desalination. The governing mathematical models that describe both the transport phenomena on a module level and the energy flow on a system level are developed to evaluate the performances of the SWRO-PRO processes. The model aims to investigate {{the performance of the}} hollow fibers as dilution occurs and provides guidelines on hollow fiber module design and process operation.

40|$|The current {{scenario}} of Malaysia water crisis demands innovative and novel technologies {{that not only}} provide elevated throughput and productivity, but also ensures optimum energy efficiency at the same time. Launching a RM 60 Million new water desalination plant is Sarawak (Choice, 2013) reflects the necessity of seawater desalination in Malaysia. Today, the most consistent and reliable technology to extract fresh water from seawater is the reverse osmosis (RO) process. However, the energy is consumed by this process, including the <b>pressure</b> <b>exchangers</b> at the brine stream. Furthermore, it also faces the issue of membrane fouling. In {{the turn of the}} new century, scientists have shown keen interest in forward osmosis (FO) process in order to address the challenges faced by the RO process. FO is an osmotically driven membrane process that takes advantage of the osmotic pressure gradient to drive water across the semipermeable membrane from the feed solution (low osmotic pressure) side to the draw solution (high osmotic pressure) side. FO delivers many potential advantages such as less energy input, lower fouling tendency, and higher water recovery than others technologies.
