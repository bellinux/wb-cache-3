40|$|Pheochromocytoma is an {{endocrine}} tumor classically presenting with headache, paroxysmal hypertension, and palpitations. We {{discuss the}} case of a young male, presenting with acute heart failure and cardiogenic shock requiring stabilization with an intra-aortic balloon pump and a combination of ionotropes and vasopressors. Pheochromocytoma was diagnosed by CT scan, as well as urine and plasma metanephrines. After pretreatment with <b>phenoxy-benzamine,</b> the patient underwent adrenalectomy with subsequent cardiovascular stabilization and full recovery. Unfortunately, pheochromocytoma often remains undiagnosed. Given the ample diagnostic tools and good prognosis when treated suitably, the diagnosis should be entertained early in patients, presenting with unexplained cardiovascular compromise...|$|E
40|$|Cultured porcine thyroid cells, {{maintained}} in the differentiated state by dibutyryl cyclic AMP, responded to serotonin (5 -HT; 10 nmol/l to 1 =m/l) with a depolarization of the membrane potential, {{but did not}} respond to histamine (100 =m/l) or dopamine(1 =m/l). The resting membrane potential of these cells was about =- 1 mV, maximal concentrations of 5 -HT (1 =m/l) inducing a depolarization to approximately =- 3 mV. Methysergide or <b>phenoxy-benzamine,</b> but not propranolol, abolished the response to 5 -HT. Sensitivity to 5 -HT was reduced by previous exposure of cultures to TSH, the =badreno-ceptor agonist salbutamol or 5 -HT itself. J. Endocr. (1985) 107, 397 =n- 0...|$|E
40|$|Potassium {{concentrations}} {{in excess of}} 30 mM increase the rate of beating of lateral cilia on the gill of Mytilus edulis. Cilioexcitation produced by low frequency (5 beats/s) electrical stimulation was potentiated with potassium but blocked with bromolysergic acid (a serotonergic inhibitor). Cilio-inhibition produced by high frequency (50 beats/s) stimulation was decreased with potassium and phenoxybenzamine (a dopaminergic inhibitor). <b>Phenoxy-benzamine</b> enhanced the cilioexcitation produced by potassium. Potassium doses incapable of maintaining a basal rate of beating (< 30 mM) could increase ciliary activity if phenoxybenzamine was also added. After tran-section of the branchial nerve, the yellow-fluorophore (serotonergic storage) and cilioexcitatory effect of potassium gradually decrease. This study shows that the potassium effect on ciliary activity (a) increases with low frequency nerve stimulation, presumably through the release of serotonin and (b) decreases with high frequency nerve stimulation, pre-sumably through the release of dopamine...|$|E

40|$|The {{classification}} of adrenergic receptor sites mto alp/ia and beta types by Ahlquist (1948) {{has proved to}} be extremely useful in under-standing the responses of the systemic vascular resistance vessels to adrenergic stimuli. This understanding has been facilitated by the use of adrenergie blocking agents such as <b>phenoxy-benzamine</b> (Dibenzyline) and phentolamine which block only the alpha receptors (Nicker-son, 1959), and agents such as dichloroiso-proterenol (Moran and Perkins, 1958) and nethalide (AY 6204, Alderlin) which block only the beta receptors (Black and Stephenson, 1962). There is considerable dispute concerning the reaction of the capacitance vessels to stimulation of the alpha and beta receptors. It has been suggested by some investigators that if beta receptors exist in the veins, they are relatively few in number and of questionable significance (Folkow, 1960; Green and Kepchar, 1959). On the other hand, isoproterenol, an agent which stimulates beta receptor sites, has been reported to result in venoconstriction (Ecksteiu and Hamilton, 1959), as well as venodilatatio...|$|E
40|$|Palmitoyl {{carnitine}} and lysophosphatidylcholine {{have been}} implicated in the generation of cardiac arrhythmias in the ischemic myocardium. These amphiphilic compounds are structurally similar to platelet-activating factor (PAF). The present study compared the hypotensive effect of these compounds to PAF in the anesthetized rat. Palmitoyl carnitine was about 1000 times less potent than PAF in lowering the blood pressure. Lysophosphatidylcholine and other structurally related compounds, in dosages {{similar to that of}} palmitoyl carnitine, had no significant hypotensive action. CV 3988, a PAF antagonist, blocked the hypotensive action of PAF but had no effect on the hypotensive action of palmitoyl carnitine. This suggested the effect of palmitoyl carnitine was not associated with the same site or mechanism as PAF. The results also ruled out the involvement of prostaglandin formation and of the sympathetic nervous system since indomethacin, <b>phenoxy-benzamine</b> and propranolol did not affect the hypotensive action of palmitoyl carnitine. In addition, it is unlikely that palmitoyl carnitine exerted its effect by a direct membrane-perturbing action because lysophosphatidylcholine, which possesses similar amphiphilic properties, does not share the same hypotensive effect. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Both {{conventional}} and second-generation antipsychotics {{have been associated}} with an increased risk for impaired glucose tolerance and diabetes mellitus. Though this has been largely attributed to weight gain, there may also be a direct, receptor-mediated effect of antipsychotics on glucose tolerance. We tested the hypothesis that antagonism of the serotonin (5 -HT) - 2 receptor impairs insulin sensitivity. Methods: Ten healthy male volunteers were included in a double-blind, placebo-controlled crossover study of a single dose of 40 mg of the 5 -HT 2 antagonist ketanserin versus placebo. Insulin sensitivity was measured by means of the euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. Subjects were treated with the - 1 adrenergic antagonist <b>phenoxy-benzamine</b> in both parts of the study to control for ketanserin’s effects at the level of this receptor. Results: Compared with the placebo condition, subjects showed a significantly decreased insulin sensitivity after ketanserin (placebo: 9. 4 3. 6 mg/kg/min; ketanserin: 7. 7 2. 1 mg/kg/min; p. 047). Conclusion: The selective 5 -HT 2 antagonist ketanserin impaired insulin sensitivity. This effect was possibly mediated by suppression of 5 -HT 2 A receptor mediated glucose uptake in skeletal muscle. Key words: 5 -HT 2 antagonism, impaired insulin sensitivity, euglycemic-hyperinsulinemic clamp technique. 5 -HT 5 -hydroxytryptamine (serotonin); BMI body mass index; FPG fasting plasma glucose; IS insulin sensitivity; BP blood pressure...|$|E
40|$|The {{coronary}} vasoconstrictor {{properties of}} digitals were evaluated in 61 anesthetized, openchest dogs after coronary sinus cannulation and {{under conditions of}} a constant heart rate (atrioventricular pacing) and near-constant blood pressure. The contribution of alpha adrenergic receptor stimulation to the digitalis-induced increase in coronary vascular resistance (CVR) was examined. With Na pentobarbital anesthesia (16 dogs), intravenous acetylstrophanthidin (0. 5 mg) caused a significant (P< 0. 05) rise in CVR from 1 through 9 min after injection. The peak increase was + 11 ± 2 % SE of the control of 1. 8 ± 0. 2 mm Hg/cm 3 /min. The mean time to peak effect was 3 min, and to recovery was 21 min. Prior alpha adrenergic receptor blockade with phenoxybenzamine in 11 animals reduced (P< 0. 05) the acetylstrophanthidin-induced peak of CVR and substantially decreased (P< 0. 05) the time to recovery (5 min). Intravenous digoxin (1. 0 mg) with Na pentobarbital anesthesia (five dogs) had no significant effect on CVR. However, with chloralose and urethane anesthesia (nine dogs) the same dose of digoxin produced a significant rise in CVR from 3 through 30 min. The peak increase was + 20 ± 3 % of control (1. 4 ± 0. 1 mm Hg/cm 3 /min). One-third the dose of intravenous digoxin (0. 35 mg) produced a 9. 5 ± 1. 0 % increase in CVR (five additional dogs). Myocardial oxygen consumption did not change significantly in nine dogs after intravenous digoxin. In 10 additional dogs pretreated with <b>phenoxy-benzamine</b> and in 7 dogs pretreated with mecamylamine, the increase in CVR did not occur after 1. 0 mg of intravenous digoxin. Thus there is a coronary vasoconstrictor effect of intravenous acetylstrophanthidin and digoxin, of rapid onset, which is mediated through alpha adrenergic receptor stimulation...|$|E
