(The company owner, Kevin Halligen, {{was arrested in}} 2009 in {{connection}} with an unrelated fraud allegation.) Oakley sent a five-man team to Portugal. Led by Henri Exton, a former British police officer {{who had worked for}} MI5, the team engaged in undercover operations within the Ocean Club and among <b>paedophile</b> rings and the Roma community.|$|E
5|$|The imams {{said that}} the three {{additional}} images were sent anonymously by mail to Muslims who were participating in an online debate on Jyllands-Postens website, and were apparently included to illustrate the perceived atmosphere of Islamophobia in which they lived. On 1 February, BBC World incorrectly reported {{that one of the}} images had been published in Jyllands-Posten. This image was later found to be a wire-service photograph of a contestant at a French pig-squealing contest in the Trie-sur-Baise's annual festival. One of the other two additional images (a photograph) portrayed a Muslim being mounted by a dog while praying, and the other (a cartoon) portrayed Muhammad as a demonic <b>paedophile.</b>|$|E
40|$|Although  “naming and shaming” <b>paedophiles</b> {{are growing}} in Sweden, {{professionals}} {{working with the}} rehabilitation and treatment of <b>paedophiles</b> describe that the naming and shaming might not prevent child sex abuse. On the opposite naming and shaming alienates the perpetrator from any ordinary life. The alienation could lead them to only having other <b>paedophiles</b> as friends. Previous studies show that professionals are often distancing themselves from working with <b>paedophiles,</b> {{even if there is}} competence. Studies also show that <b>paedophiles</b> are seldom seeking help due to of fear of stigmatization. The aim {{of this study was to}} describe social workers perception of “paedophiles” and to find out the action contingency among social workers regarding clients that express such feelings. A qualitative method with semi-structured interviews was used. Seven social workers and one psychologist were interviewed. Previous research has been confirmed as many professionals actively choose not to work with perpetrators even though they believe the perpetrators deserve adequate help. The data was analysed referring to Hasenfelds theory of human service organizations and the concept of cognitive dissonance. Organizations that are not specifically built to treat perpetrators and <b>paedophiles</b> are apparently not prepared to help them. ...|$|R

5|$|In {{the early}} days of the inquiry, the Portuguese police searched through images seized from <b>paedophile</b> investigations, and Madeleine's parents were shown {{photographs}} of sex offenders in case they recognized them from Praia de Luz. Several British paedophiles were of interest. In May 2009 investigators working for the McCanns tried to question one, Raymond Hewlett; he had allegedly told someone he knew what happened to Madeleine, but he retracted and died of cancer in Germany in December that year. Scotland Yard made inquiries about two paedophiles who have been in jail in Scotland since 2010 for murder. The men were running a window-cleaning service in the Canary Islands when Madeleine went missing.|$|E

Matthew Marsh and Vicky Hall reprised their roles as Dylan's father, Brian Carroll and his partner, Hazel Leyton in episode thirty-five. They continued to appear until episode forty-one. Sydney Wade and Tonicha Lawrence began appearing as Grace's friend Carmel Sims and her mother, Steph in episode thirty-six. They appeared in a storyline which saw Steph psychologically abuse Carmel and later, run Connie and Grace off {{the road in the}} end of series cliffhanger. Owain Arthur's casting in the role of Glen Thomas, a love interest for Robyn was announced in May 2016. He debuted in episode thirty-seven, and was involved in a storyline which saw him revealed to have a brain tumour.|$|E
5|$|Lindqvist {{had insisted}} on writing the {{screenplay}} himself. Alfredson, who had no familiarity with the vampire and horror genres, initially expressed skepticism at having the original author do the adaptation, but found the end result very satisfying. Many of the minor characters and events from the book were removed, and focus directed primarily on the love story between the two leads. In particular, {{many aspects of the}} character Håkan, including him being a <b>paedophile,</b> were toned down, and his relationship with Eli was mostly left open to interpretation. Alfredson felt that the film could not deal with such a serious theme as pedophilia in a satisfying manner, and that this element would detract from the story of the children and their relationship. Still, the film provided a few hints, of which Alfredson mentions one in the director's comments (Håkan likes children, for the wrong reasons).|$|E

5000|$|The case {{prompted}} {{an increased}} {{recognition of the}} problem of female <b>paedophiles</b> and the scale of their offending, with experts suggesting that 20% of <b>paedophiles</b> were female. As well as challenging the false stereotype that only men sexually abused children, other misconceptions have been challenged. Previously some had attempted to blame the behaviour of female <b>paedophiles</b> on men, suggesting female child sex abusers were usually acting under duress or coercion. The case actually showed the perpetrators to be acting of their own free will and for their own sexual gratification. Michele Elliott of child protection charity Kidscape stated [...] "the reality is women abuse, women abuse without men telling them to abuse, and I think we have to acknowledge it {{for the sake of the}} children who are being abused." [...] The case also promoted calls for more research into the offending of female <b>paedophiles.</b>|$|R

5|$|Rosebery's {{frequent}} absences {{from his}} wife fuelled gossip {{that he was a}} secret homosexual. It has been claimed that the inscrutable air that Rosebery wore was a mask to disguise his secret homosexual life. The worry of this illegal secret, it was claimed, and fear of exposure, caused his insomnia and bouts of depression. It was even whispered that his Barnbougle Castle retreat was really a venue for clandestine assignations with young men. Rosebery's possible homosexuality has been much discussed in recent times. Nothing conclusive has ever been found one way or the other, but it is possible that he had homosexual experiences while in the care of a <b>paedophile</b> housemaster at Eton in his youth. No evidence exists that his wife was aware of these rumours against her husband, or even that she would have understood them, bearing in mind her sheltered upbringing and limited education. Sex education was not part of a 19th-century upper-class girl's schooling. The more public and precise accusations of Rosebery's homosexuality by the Marquess of Queensberry did not occur until three years after Lady Rosebery's death.|$|E
5|$|After being {{released}} from prison for assaulting a teenage boy who propositioned Whitney Dean (Shona McGarty), Tony joins his partner Bianca Butcher (Patsy Palmer) and her family in Walford, including her son Morgan Jackson-King, whom he has adopted. It is revealed {{that he is a}} <b>paedophile</b> who has been grooming and sexually abusing Whitney, Bianca's adopted daughter, since she was 12. He immediately resumes his sexual relationship with Whitney, despite his displeasure at her more adult appearance, insisting she remove her make-up and jewellery. When Whitney gets a role in the school play, Romeo and Julie, Tony is angry about having less time with her, becoming jealous of her co-star Peter Beale (Thomas Law). Tony deceives Whitney into believing they will run away and start a new life together when she turns sixteen. Whitney gives him money she has been keeping for his return, which he gives Bianca as a deposit for a flat. Tony assaults Peter {{as a result of his}} growing jealousy, and is nearly reported to the police by Peter's sister Lucy Beale (Melissa Suffield). Whitney convinces Lucy not to go to the police, but not before Lucy tells Bianca what happened. When Bianca angrily tells Tony that she is not a child anymore, he realizes he is no longer attracted to her.|$|E

Gilly and Beth grow closer and kiss. They start a relationship and agree to take it slowly. Gilly decides to become a lifeguard. Whilst cleaning up, Gilly sees boss, Simon Crosby (Simon Lawson), leaving a cubicle with a crying child. Gilly automatically assumes he is a <b>paedophile.</b> Gilly breaks into Simon's house and finds pictures of children in their swimwear, {{one of whom is}} Tom Cunningham (Ellis Hollins).

Realsing his reputation is ruined, Simon attempts suicide. Simon's wife Gemma Grosby (Gemma Langford) shows Gilly a picture of their son, who died.

5000|$|Having {{moved to}} Santa Fe to write, Pizzey {{promptly}} {{became involved in}} running a refuge in New Mexico, as well as dealing with sexual abusers and <b>paedophiles.</b> Pizzey said of this work, [...] "I discovered that there were just as many women <b>paedophiles</b> as there were men. Women go undetected, as usual. Working against <b>paedophiles</b> {{is a very dangerous}} business." [...] Whilst living in Santa Fe, one of her dogs was shot and two others were stolen, which she claims was a result of racist neighbors. Her family suffered new harassment following the publication of her 1982 book Prone to Violence. Pizzey links much of the harassment to militant feminists and their objections to her research, findings and work. Describing the harassment, Deborah Ross of The Independent wrote that [...] "the feminist sisterhood went bonkers".|$|R
