500|$|The {{introduction}} of articulated connecting rods {{was regarded as}} a [...] "nuisance" [...] by Arthur Rubbra, a Rolls-Royce engine designer, as there were inherent problems with the arrangement. The complicated geometry meant that a pair of rods had different effective lengths, giving a longer stroke on the articulated side; consequently the cylinder liners on that side had to be lengthened to prevent the lower <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> from running out of the cylinder skirt. Articulated rods were used in the Goshawk engine, but were not embodied in the later Rolls-Royce Merlin, for which Arthur Rowledge had designed a revised blade and fork system.|$|E

The influence of structural components of metallic basis and of graphite on the stress-strain properties and on the wear resistance of <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> has been ascertained.
