5|$|The {{squadron}} {{was transferred}} to the division with which it would {{spend the rest of the}} war; the 6th Airborne Division, raised in April 1943. The squadron continued to train as an air-portable unit and participated in a number of exercises intended to familiarize it with the duties it would perform, including reconnaissance of enemy positions and performing counter-attacks against enemy infantry and armor. In mid-July an American pilot was sent to Britain to illustrate that the tank could fit inside a Hamilcar and be landed, and then on October 25 the Light Tank Squadron received a shipment of seventeen Locusts. During November the new tanks were issued to the squadron, replacing a majority of the Tetrarchs; however a small number of Tetrarchs fitted with a 3 inch (76.2 mm) infantry support howitzer, which were designated as Tetrarch 1 CS (Close Support), were retained. Several of the Locusts also were fitted with Littlejohn adaptors to increase the range and <b>penetration</b> <b>power</b> of their main armament, although it is not clear how many were fitted or if they were fitted at manufacture or after they reached the squadron. The squadron was expanded into the 6th Airborne Armoured Reconnaissance Regiment in December 1943, and as late as March 1944, plans were made for the regiment to be equipped with seventeen Locusts and three Tetrarchs when it took part in Operation Tonga, the British airborne landings in Normandy. However, records indicate that by April the Hamilcar gliders of the regiment were being refitted to only carry Tetrarchs, and by late March the Locusts appear to have been completely replaced. This seems to have been due to mechanical and gunnery problems with the Locusts, as well as specific problems with the design of the Locust's gearbox.|$|E

2500|$|In a fully upright stance, {{the boxer}} stands with the legs shoulder-width apart and the rear foot a {{half-step}} {{in front of}} the lead man. Right-handed or orthodox boxers lead with the left foot and fist (for most <b>penetration</b> <b>power).</b> Both feet are parallel, and the right heel is off the ground. The lead (left) fist is held vertically about six inches {{in front of the}} face at eye level. The rear (right) fist is held beside the chin and the elbow tucked against the ribcage to protect the body. The chin is tucked into the chest to avoid punches to the jaw which commonly cause knock-outs and is often kept slightly off-center. Wrists are slightly bent to avoid damage when punching and the elbows are kept tucked in to protect the ribcage. Some boxers fight from a crouch, leaning forward and keeping their feet closer together. The stance described is considered the [...] "textbook" [...] stance and fighters are encouraged to change it around once it's been mastered as a base. Case in point, many fast fighters have their hands down and have almost exaggerated footwork, while brawlers or bully fighters tend to slowly stalk their opponents.|$|E

30|$|By {{contrast}} analysis, {{when the}} wind <b>power</b> <b>penetration</b> is low, the integration of wind power in power system has little impact on the system reliability, where LOLP and LOEE maintained at a high level. With the increase of wind <b>power</b> <b>penetration,</b> the impact of wind power on power system reliability increases, as shown in Fig.  12. When wind <b>power</b> <b>penetration</b> is 20.9  %, the maximum LOLP of the system will reach up to 0.308 without the integration of wind power, while the LOLPs are 0.02891 considering a constant FOR of wind turbines and 0.02890 considering the operational outage probability, respectively. Reliability level will be declined by more than 10 times. Similarly, the LOEE of system without the integration of wind power is 6 times higher than that considering operational outage probability model, as shown in Fig.  14.

Unlike the conventional synchronous generation, wind generation has different dynamic characteristics and hence influences the frequency response of a power system.

The investigation is carried out on six different load scenarios, with three different wind <b>power</b> <b>penetrations.</b> The frequency sensitivity index {{and the rate of}} change of frequency (ROCOF) of the system are estimated. It is observed that the system may become more vulnerable in terms of frequency response as the penetration level of wind power increases.

Consequently, it will become necessary that wind power plants (WPPs) could be controlled like conventional generators to contribute to voltage and frequency control. A two level hierarchical structure, consisting of a wind power plant controller and wind turbine controllers, may be used. The wind farm controller communicates with higher level control centre and determines the operating points for wind turbines to meet grid demands. The turbine controller responds to the power set point from WPP controller.|$|R
