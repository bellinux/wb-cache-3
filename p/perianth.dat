5|$|All {{three parts}} may be {{considered}} to be components of the <b>perianth</b> (perigon, perigonium). The <b>perianth</b> arises above the apex of the inferior ovary, its base forming the hypanthial floral tube.|$|E
5|$|Surrounding {{the floral}} tube and corona and reflexed (bent back) {{from the rest}} of the <b>perianth</b> are the six {{spreading}} tepals or floral leaves, in two whorls which may be distally ascending, reflexed (folded back), or lanceolate. Like many monocotyledons, the <b>perianth</b> is homochlamydeous, that is undifferentiated into separate calyx (sepals) and corolla (petals), but rather has six tepals. The three outer tepal segments may be considered sepals, and the three inner segments petals. The transition point between the floral tube and the corona is marked by the insertion of the free tepals on the fused <b>perianth.</b>|$|E
5|$|Depending on the species, {{there are}} two to fifteen large showy flowers, which {{are more or less}} zygomophic and hermaphrodite. Each flower is 1320cm (5"8") across, and the native species are usually purple or red. They are funnelform (funnel shaped) and declinate (curving {{downwards}} and then upwards at the tip) in shape. The <b>perianth</b> has six brightly colored tepals (three outer sepals and three inner petals) that may be similar in appearance or very different. The <b>perianth</b> segments are subequal or unequal. The tepals are united at the base to form a short tube, usually with a rudimentary scaly paraperigonium with fimbriae or a callose ridge present at the throat.|$|E
50|$|Examples {{of flowers}} with much reduced <b>perianths</b> are {{found among the}} grasses.|$|R
50|$|Subspecies hirsuta can be {{distinguished}} by its more densely hairy <b>perianths</b> and pedicels.|$|R
5|$|The related Banksia caleyi {{is similar}} in {{appearance}} but can be distinguished by its recurved (downward curving) leaf margins, and smaller follicles and <b>perianths.</b> Its flowers appear from October to December.|$|R
5|$|Flowers : Hermaphroditic, actinomorphic (radially symmetric) or {{slightly}} zygomorphic (bilaterally symmetric), pedicellate (on a short secondary stem), generally large and showy {{but may be}} inconspicuous : (Medeoleae). Bracts may (bracteate) or may not (ebracteate) be present. The <b>perianth</b> is undifferentiated (perigonium) and biseriate (two whorled), formed from six tepals arranged into two separate whorls of three parts (trimerous) each, although Scoliopus has only three petals, free from the other parts, but overlapping. The tepals are usually petaloid (petal like) and apotepalous (free) with lines (striate) or marks in other colors or shades. The <b>perianth</b> is either homochlamydeous (all tepals equal, e.g. Fritillaria) or dichlamydeous (two separate and different whorls, e.g. Calochortus) and may be united into a tube. Nectar is produced in perigonal nectaries {{at the base of}} the tepals.|$|E
5|$|Occurring {{in spring}} (August to October), {{the bright red}} or orange-red inflorescences are {{terminal}} and well displayed, and consist of anywhere from 10 to 52 individual flowers split into smaller groups of 2 to 20 flowers, arranged in a corymb. The flowers sit atop stalks (known as pedicels) up to 3.5cm (1.6in) in length, which arise in pairs off main horizontal stalks within the inflorescence. Each flower consists of a tubular <b>perianth</b> up to 4cm (1.8in) long, which partly splits along one side at anthesis to release the thick style. The stigma is contained within a slanting disc-like structure {{at the tip of}} the style. The tubular <b>perianth</b> splits into four segments at its tip, and the anther lies in the concave parts within each of these segments. The pedicel and the outer surface of the <b>perianth</b> are pubescent (covered in short fine fur). Flowers are followed by woody rectangular seed pods that sit on long stalks, and are 7–10cm (2.8–4in) long. Each pod contains 8 to 10seeds, and is ripe in February and March. Each seed is separated from the others by a membranous separator, and has a long rectangular wing, which is much longer than the seed itself. The seedlings have obovate cotyledons that are 0.8–1cm (0.3–0.4in) wide by 1cm (0.4in) long.|$|E
5|$|While the <b>perianth</b> may point forwards, in {{some species}} such as N. cyclamineus it is folded back (reflexed, see illustration, left), while in some other {{species such as}} N. bulbocodium (Table I), it is reduced to a few barely visible pointed {{segments}} with a prominent corona.|$|E
5|$|Banksia acanthopoda resembles B.hewardiana but has smaller {{leaves that}} are sticky when young. Its flower heads {{are similar to}} that of B.squarrosa, but its <b>perianths</b> and pistils are {{straight}} rather than curved, and longer.|$|R
40|$|AbstractFlower colours and the {{composition}} of pigments in the <b>perianths</b> of five cultivars of Disa orchids were analyzed. Carotenoids were major pigment components in the orange-red flowers of ‘Dawn Angel’. We identified two types of pigment composition in the red flowered cultivars: ‘San Francisco’ contained more carotenoids and less anthocyanins, while ‘Marlene’ contained more anthocyanins than carotenoids. The red-purple flowered cultivars, only contained slight amounts of carotenoids, and the red-purple colour was attributed to the relatively high density of a cyanidin-based anthocyanin. The importance of the characterization of pigments in the <b>perianths</b> of orchid has been discussed in both breeding for flower colour improvement and chemotaxonomy...|$|R
50|$|It is a shrub {{that grows}} to 1.5 metres in height and 2 metres in width and has divided leaves. The inflorescences are about 12 cm long by 10 cm wide, with apricot-coloured <b>perianths</b> and red styles.|$|R
5|$|George placed B.epica in B.subg. Banksia, {{because its}} inflorescences are typical Banksia flower spikes; B.sect. Banksia {{because of its}} {{straight}} styles; and B.ser. Cyrtostylis because it has slender flowers. He considered its closest relatives to be B.praemorsa (cut-leaf banksia) and B.media, {{both of which have}} shorter flowers and smaller pollen-presenters than B.epica. In addition, B.praemorsa differs in having a hairless <b>perianth,</b> and B.media has larger, more undulate leaves.|$|E
5|$|In 1870, George Bentham {{published}} the first infrageneric arrangement of Adenanthos in Volume 5 of his landmark Flora Australiensis. Bentham divided the genus into two sections, placing A.obovata in A.sect. Eurylaema, defined as containing those species with one sterile stamen, and <b>perianth</b> tubes that are curved and swollen above the middle.|$|E
5|$|The {{flowers of}} all banksias arise in a spiral pattern around the flower spike axis; however in Banksia coccinea they develop into {{distinctive}} vertical columns, which are strongly accentuated by large gaps in between. Paired in columns, the red styles {{contrast with the}} grey-white <b>perianth</b> making a striking flower spike.|$|E
50|$|Allium victorialis attains {{a height}} of abbr=on 30 - 45 cm and forms a {{sheathed}} bulb ("root-stalk") about the thickness of a finger and abbr=on 5 - 8 cm long. Leaves are broad elliptical or lanceolate. Flowers (<b>perianths)</b> are whitish green.|$|R
5000|$|It may be {{prostrate}} or a shrub to 0.5 metres in height. [...] Flowers appear between October and November (mid {{spring to}} late spring) in its native range. These have <b>perianths</b> which are green to pink and styles that are pale greenish-pink.|$|R
50|$|It {{has a low}} {{spreading}} or erect habit, {{growing to}} 1 metre high. The leaves are linear or narrow-oblong elliptic. Flowers appear between August and December (late winter to early summer) in its native range. These have reddish purple <b>perianths</b> with pink or reddish mauve styles.|$|R
5|$|Sexual {{reproduction}} in Eriophorum angustifolium {{begins with}} flowering in spring or early summer (in or around May), when groups of 3–5 brown flowers are produced. Fertilisation usually {{takes place in}} May or June, via anemophily (wind-pollination), and the white bristle-like <b>perianth,</b> composed of achenes with pappi (seeds with hairs) then grows outwards to appear like short tufts of cotton thread. These pappi endure well into summer, lasting from around June to September. Like the pappus of Taraxacum (dandelions), this aids in wind-dispersal, and also serves as thermal insulation, conserving {{the temperature of the}} plant's reproductive organs by trapping solar radiation.|$|E
5|$|The {{species is}} very similar to A.barbiger. There are obvious {{differences}} in typical leaf shape, with leaves of most populations of A.barbiger being very much longer and narrower than those of A.obovatus. However, leaf shape is variable in both species, and some southern populations of A.barbiger have leaves that are indistinguishable from those of A.obovatus. The most systematically important properties by which the two may be distinguished are the shape of the <b>perianth</b> limb, which is rounded in A.obovatus and pointed in A.barbiger; the bracts, glabrous versus hirsute; and the style-ends, which are green and scarlet respectively. The species also differ slightly in range of flower colours: A.barbiger has scarlet to bright red flowers, whereas A.obovatus flowers are scarlet to orange.|$|E
5|$|Narcissi are now {{popular as}} {{ornamental}} plants for gardens, parks and as cut flowers, providing colour {{from the end}} of winter to the beginning of summer in temperate regions. They {{are one of the most}} popular spring flowers and one of the major ornamental spring flowering bulb crops, being produced both for their bulbs and cut flowers, though cultivation of private and public spaces is greater than the area of commercial production. Over a century of breeding has resulted in thousands of varieties and cultivars being available from both general and specialist suppliers. They are normally sold as dry bulbs to be planted in late summer and autumn. They are one of the most economically important ornamental plants. Plant breeders have developed some daffodils with double, triple, or ambiguously multiple rows and layers of segments. Many of the breeding programs have concentrated on the corona (trumpet or cup), in terms of its length, shape, and colour, and the surrounding <b>perianth</b> or even as in varieties derived from N. poeticus a very reduced form.|$|E
25|$|Fritillaria is a genus of {{herbaceous}} bulbous perennials. It is characterised by nodding (pendant) flowers, <b>perianths</b> campanulate (bell- or cup-shaped) with erect {{segments in}} upper part, a nectarial pit, groove or pouch {{at the base}} of the tepal, anthers usually pseudobasifixed, rarely versatile, fruit sometimes winged, embryo minute.|$|R
5000|$|Grevillea montis-cole is a shrub {{which is}} endemic to central-western Victoria, Australia. It has {{similarities}} in appearance to Grevillea microstegia, Grevillea floripendula and Grevillea aquifolium but has larger floral bracts. The flowers, which appear between October and March in its native range, have greenish to fawn <b>perianths</b> and red styles.|$|R
5000|$|In 1981, Alex George {{published}} a revised arrangement that placed B. hookeriana in the subgenus Banksia {{because of its}} flower spike, section Banksia because its styles are straight rather than hooked, and the series Crocinae, {{a new series of}} four closely related species, all with bright orange <b>perianths</b> and pistils.|$|R
5|$|The {{plants are}} scapose, having a single central {{leafless}} hollow flower stem (scape). Several green or blue-green, narrow, strap-shaped leaves {{arise from the}} bulb. The plant stem usually bears a solitary flower, but occasionally a cluster of flowers (umbel). The flowers, which are usually conspicuous and white or yellow, sometimes both or rarely green, consist of a <b>perianth</b> of three parts. Closest to the stem (proximal) is a floral tube above the ovary, then an outer ring composed of six tepals (undifferentiated sepals and petals), and a central disc to conical shaped corona. The flowers may hang down (pendent), or be erect. There are six pollen bearing stamens surrounding a central style. The ovary is inferior (below the floral parts) consisting of three chambers (trilocular). The fruit consists of a dry capsule that splits (dehisces) releasing numerous black seeds.|$|E
5|$|Persoonia levis grows as a tall shrub {{to small}} tree, and can reach 5m (16ft) in height. The flaky soft bark is dark grey on the surface, while deeper layers are reddish in colour. Within the bark are epicormic buds, which sprout new growth after bushfire. The new growth is smooth to {{slightly}} hairy. The large green leaves measure 6 to 14cm (2.2–5.5in) in length, and 1.3 to 8cm (0.5–3.2in) in width, and are oblong or sickle-shaped (falcate). The asymmetrical shape helps distinguish the species from P.lanceolata. The bright green foliage, particularly of new growth, stands {{out against the}} more subdued tones of the surrounding vegetation and the stems, which are reddish in colour. The yellow flowers appear in summer and autumn (December to April), and peak over December to February. They are arranged on short axillary racemes along the branchlets. Each individual flower consists of a cylindrical <b>perianth,</b> consisting of tepals fused {{for most of their}} length, within which are both male and female parts. The central style is surrounded by the anther, which splits into four segments; these curl back and resemble a cross when viewed from above. They provide a landing area for insects attending to the stigma, which is located {{at the tip of the}} style. The smooth fleshy fruit, known as a drupe, is green and more or less round, measuring 1cm (0.4in) by 0.8cm (0.3in) in diameter. It contains two seeds, and has a spike at the end. The drupe is juicy but stringy when unripe, and the seeds and skin are inedible.|$|E
5|$|The {{development}} of DNA sequencing {{and the use}} of genetic data in determining relationships between species of monocots confirmed what many taxonomists had long suspected: Liliaceae s.l. was highly polyphyletic. The family was demonstrated to include a significant number of unrelated groups, which belonged to quite separate families and even orders. For instance some genera such as Hyacinthus, previously placed in Liliaceae s.l., were reclassified in families within Asparagales (in this case Asparagaceae). In 1995 Chase et al. reviewed the understanding of the lilioids and equated them to Dahlgreen's Liliiflorae, which they designated as superorder Lilianae. They pointed out that the understanding of the phylogenetics of this group was critical {{for the establishment of a}} monocot classification. They also noted that while many authors treated this group as monophyletic (having a common ancestor), a closer reading of their texts revealed evidence of paraphyly (excluding some descendants of a common ancestor). For instance, Dahlgren had based monophyly on a single synapomorphy, that of a petaloid <b>perianth,</b> yet in discussing his Lilliflorae admitted it was undoubtedly paraphyletic. Dahlgren treated the monocots as split between ten superorders and placed five orders (Dioscoreales, Asparagales, Liliales, Melanthiales, Burmanniales and Orchidales) in his Liliiflorae.|$|E
