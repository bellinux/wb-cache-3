50|$|The <b>Prudent</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Rule</b> {{requires}} that each investment {{be judged on}} its own merits and that speculative or risky investments must be avoided. Under the <b>Prudent</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Rule,</b> certain types of investments, such as second mortgages or new business ventures, are viewed as intrinsically speculative and therefore prohibited as fiduciary investments. As with any fiduciary relationship, margin accounts and short selling of uncovered securities are also prohibited.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>Prudent</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Rule</b> {{is based}} on common law {{stemming}} from the 1830 Massachusetts court formulation, Harvard College v. Amory The <b>prudent</b> <b>man</b> <b>rule</b> directs trustees [...] "to observe how men of prudence, discretion and intelligence manage their own affairs, not in regard to speculation, but {{in regard to the}} permanent disposition of their funds, considering the probable income, as well as the probable safety of the capital to be invested." ...|$|E
5000|$|Since the <b>Prudent</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Rule</b> {{was last}} revised in 1959, {{numerous}} investment products {{have been introduced}} or have come into the mainstream. For example, in 1959, there were 155 mutual funds with nearly $16 billion in assets. By year-end 2000, mutual funds had grown to 10,725, with $6.9 trillion in assets. In addition, investors have become more sophisticated and are more attuned to investments since the last revision of the Rule. As these two concepts converged, the <b>Prudent</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Rule</b> became less relevant. This discounting of {{the relevance of the}} <b>prudent</b> <b>man</b> <b>rule</b> is more the result of market forces than it is of the needs of individuals for [...] "safety of capital". The 10,000+ mutual funds of 2000 have grown to over 15,000 mutual funds in 2006.|$|E

5000|$|Under the <b>Prudent</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Rule,</b> {{when the}} {{governing}} trust instrument is silent concerning {{the types of}} investments permitted, the fiduciary is required to invest trust assets as a [...] "prudent man" [...] would invest his own property with the following factors in mind: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{application}} of these general principles depends {{on the type of}} account administered. The <b>Prudent</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Rule</b> continues to be the prevailing statute in a small number of states, in particular with regards to investments permitted by mutually-chartered institutions such as savings banks and insurance companies.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Prudent</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Rule</b> in its broader interpretations {{implies that}} the {{fiduciary}} should perform enough due diligence {{to ensure that the}} company meets the investment needs of the investors. Typical due diligence includes discussions with management, vendors and customers, as well as proper evaluation of any risk factors that might affect the performance of the company or its securities.|$|E

5000|$|The modern {{interpretation}} of the [...] "Prudent Man Rule" [...] goes beyond the assessment of each asset individually to include the concept of due diligence and diversification. This is {{sometimes referred to as}} the “Prudent Investor Rule”. The logic is this: an asset may be too risky to put all your money in (thus failing the <b>Prudent</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Rule)</b> but may still be very diversifying and therefore beneficial in a small proportion of the total portfolio.|$|E
5000|$|Staking a claim {{involves}} {{first the}} discovery of a valuable mineral in quantities that a [...] "prudent man" [...] (the <b>Prudent</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Rule)</b> would invest time and expenses to recover. Next, marking the claim boundaries, typically with wooden posts or capped steel posts, which must be four feet tall, or stone cairns, which must be three feet tall. Finally, filing a claim with both the land management agency (USFS or BLM), and the local county registrar.|$|E
50|$|Morgenthaler {{served as}} one of the {{founding}} directors of the National Venture Capital Association (NVCA) and served as Chairman of its Incentives Committee, working with the United States Congress to improve conditions for venture capital and entrepreneurship. He was President and, subsequently, Chairman when the Steiger Amendment to the Revenue Act of 1978 was enacted, resulting in a roll-back of the capital gains tax from 49% to 28%. Under his leadership, NVCA was also able to amend the <b>Prudent</b> <b>Man</b> <b>Rule</b> of ERISA to allow pension funds to invest in venture capital and to liberalize conditions for public offerings for small companies.|$|E

5000|$|Personal fiduciaries {{are held}} to {{standards}} of performance that vary depending on their actual role. These performance standards may be defined by common law, statutes, rules and regulations, or specifically by contracts, trust agreements or wills. Increasingly in the US, the prudent investor rule, {{in place of the}} long-standing <b>prudent</b> <b>man</b> <b>rule,</b> is viewed as the standard of performance for the management of assets by a personal fiduciary. This performance standard shares some characteristics with, but differs in several material respects from, the Employee Retirement Income Security Act, which is applicable to most US employee retirement plans.|$|E
5000|$|In a January 2011 op-ed in the Financial Times’ Market Insights column, Kaplan {{discussed}} the Prudent Man construct {{as a tool}} to evaluate the benefits and risks of investing in gold. In that piece, he explained that a variety of factors - including the supply of and demand for gold, the devastation of financial industry and government balance sheets and the fact that gold is not tied to another person’s ability to pay - are causing asset managers and general banks to begin readmitting “gold back into the select group of prudent asset classes.” According to Kaplan, these developments suggest “interesting times ahead” for those who own the precious metal. Therefore, “the <b>Prudent</b> <b>Man</b> <b>rule</b> may well be golden indeed.” ...|$|E

The <b>prudent</b> <b>man</b> <b>rule</b> and fiduciary responsibilities of institutional managers might be good reasons to explain our findings. </p...|$|E

40|$|The {{problem of}} how to invest the funds of another is not new. While not {{intended}} as an investment guide, this article traces the development of the law in the area of fiduciary investment, analyzing the conflict inherent in balancing the considerations of safety, yield and liquidity with the needs of the beneficiaries. Concluding that most common law and statutory standards are unduly restrictive in light of modern investment practices, the author considers the Maryland experience and suggests that the Maryland legislature adopt a <b>prudent</b> <b>man</b> <b>rule</b> which would enable fiduciaries to effectively utilize contemporary investment vehicles...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of changes in state prudent trust {{investment}} laws on asset allocation in noncommercial trusts. The old <b>prudent</b> <b>man</b> <b>rule</b> favored “safe ” invest-ments and disfavored “speculation ” in stock. The new prudent investor rule directs trustees to craft an investment portfolio that fits the risk tolerance of the beneficiaries {{and the purpose of}} the trust. Using state- and institution-level panel data from 1986 through 1997, we find that after adoption of the new prudent investor rule, institutional trustees held about 1. 5 to 4. 5 per-centage points more stock at the expense of “safe ” investments. Our findings explain roughly 15 to 30 percent of the overall increase in stock holdings in the period studied. We attribute most of the remaining increase to stock market appreciation. We conclude that, even thoug...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of changes in state prudent trust {{investment}} laws on asset allocation in noncommercial trusts. The old <b>prudent</b> <b>man</b> <b>rule</b> favored “safe” investments such as government bonds and disfavored “speculation” in stock. The new prudent investor rule, now widely adopted, relies on modern portfolio theory, freeing the trustee to invest based on risk and return objectives reasonably suited to the trust and {{in light of the}} composition of the trust portfolio as a whole. Using state- and institution-level panel data from 1986 - 1997, we find that after a state’s adoption of the new prudent investor rule, trust institutions held about 1. 5 to 4. 5 percentage points more stock at the expense of “safe” investments. Accordingly, we conclude that trustees are sensitive to changes in trust fiduciary law. Even though trust investment laws are nominally default rules, such rules matter in the presence of agency costs and unreliable judicial enforcement of opt outs...|$|E
