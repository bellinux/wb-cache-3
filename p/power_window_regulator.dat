50|$|Window {{regulators}} - The <b>power</b> <b>window</b> <b>regulator,</b> {{essentially the}} mechanism that transfers {{power from the}} electric motor to the window, has a few plastic parts that can fail after several years causing the power window to stop operating. DIY replacement of a window regulator {{can be done in}} about 1-2 hours at a cost of somewhere between $60 and $120 for the part.|$|E
5000|$|During the 1974 {{recession}} {{with the}} first oil crisis, the company was forced to lay off one quarter of its employees and to switch production to water taps and recliners for the furniture industry. Brose Coburg started to expand again {{over the next few}} years, investing DM 35 million into its new [...] "Plant 2" [...] in Coburg, which went into full operation in 1983. The company employed then around 1500 people. However, the production of injection molded products for the automotive industry which started in 1981 was stopped again in 1989. In the eighties, numerous products were refined such as the <b>power</b> <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> with anti-trap protection, the power seat adjuster and the electronic position memory.|$|E
40|$|<b>Power</b> <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> is a {{mechanism}} for raising and lowering door glass. It consists {{of a set of}} gear, electric motor and door sash channels. For this project, power window design of the Proton Gen- 2 was selected, where the improvement had been made at main arm and slider. The main arm and slider was designed using CAD software. Then, the design was analyzed using FMEA method and FEA (ALGOR) software. These analyses were done to find the best design that can optimize the operation for the stress analysis. There is one design for main arm and two designs for slider had been done. The analysis showed that both of the new designs are better compared to current design. For the both designs, the result showed that when force are applied, the displacement of improvement design that occur is lowest than current design. In conclusion, this improvement can reduce the cost of repairing because the improvement made can hopefully reduce the failure occurrence for that specific power window mechanism...|$|E

In April 2008, Brose added electric drives for <b>window</b> <b>regulators,</b> sunroofs and [...] seat belt retractors to its portfolio by purchasing the electric motor business of Continental AG.

40|$|<b>Window</b> <b>regulator</b> {{system is}} {{becoming}} a complicated mechatronic system. To obtain and improve understandings of system behaviors, this work developed models and simulations. To realize the target, system simulation with uniformed modeling language, VHDL-AMS, is chosen as tool. At first, dynamic behavior of <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> system is studied with method of averaging by a highly abstracted model. As next, main components, e. g. electrical drive, lifting mechanism, door frame and electronic system, are studied and modelled. Parametrization achieves with information from suppliers, existing data bank and measurements. Component models are verified and validated against their measurements. Afterwards, system simulation is built up by assembling component models. As verification and validation, system simulations are compared to measurements. As applications, simulations are used to investigate anti-pinch processes, influence of drum diameter and so on. Depending on the purpose of usage, they can be further improved. As summary, simulation provides support in development of <b>window</b> <b>regulator</b> systems.

5000|$|Ford {{also had}} a similar {{electro-hydraulic}} system on higher-end convertibles. Mercury and Ford Sportsman convertibles (with wood trim) were equipped with <b>power</b> <b>windows</b> on four windows from 1946 through 1948 and Mercury and Lincoln by 1951. These systems were used by other luxury car models (Imperial and Packard) until Chrysler introduced the all-electric operation on the 1951 Imperial. The availability of <b>power</b> <b>windows</b> increased {{with the use of}} small, high-torque electric motors. General Motors also followed with full electric operation in 1954. This included four-way and then six-way seats, which were introduced in 1956. Chevrolet introduced the oddity of <b>power</b> front <b>windows</b> (only) in the 1954 model.

40|$|<b>Power</b> <b>windows</b> {{system or}} {{electric}} windows is divided in two types. They are cable type <b>power</b> <b>window</b> system and scissor type <b>power</b> <b>window</b> system. The main {{function of the}} <b>power</b> <b>windows</b> is to raise and lower automobile windows by depressing a button or switch, as opposed to using a hand-turned crank handle. The system have five components which are the window, the frame and guide rails, the electric motors and the door frame. In the cable type, the electric motors that are provided consist of the motor and a cable driven track that raises and lowers the window. The motor assembly {{will need to be}} fastened to the door frame. These components were reviewed for differences in shape and construction prior to being assembled to the vehicles. There are difference specifications for different manufacturers. For this project, <b>power</b> <b>window</b> system of Proton Gen- 2 car was chosen to be benchmarking. Then the parts that always failed will be defined. The parts will be redesign and the material will be changed. The current and new parts were design by using SOLIDWORK software in dimensional of Proton Gen- 2 car <b>power</b> <b>window</b> system. By using FEA tools that is ALGOR software, the design was analyzed using constant force. Improvement of <b>power</b> <b>window</b> parts design was compared based on material used, analysis on Stress Von Mises and displacement, buying and repairing cost, and others. The new design that will give the lowest value of Stress Von Mises and displacement will be selected as the improvement part.

The important result is to improve <b>power</b> <b>window</b> parts in order to enhance the life time of the system and to give advantages to the car users such as reducing the maintenance cost...|$|R
