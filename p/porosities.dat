30|$|Being {{influenced}} by the complications of <b>porosity</b> evolution and the reliability of <b>porosity</b> data, the initial <b>porosity</b> fitted by the practical <b>porosity</b> (the <b>porosity</b> value of practical data) always exceeds the critical <b>porosity</b> (it {{is defined as a}} <b>porosity</b> that separates mechanical and acoustic behaviors into two distinct domains) of pure shale or sand.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a laboratory examination of the <b>porosity</b> values of Hong Kong completely decomposed granites. Five methods are used to measure the <b>porosity</b> values. They are the conventional physical test, helium instrument, mercury injection, thin section measurement and scanning electronic microscopy (SEM). The <b>porosity</b> from the physical test is an absolute <b>porosity</b> with the largest values (average = 44. 88 %). The <b>porosity</b> from the thin section represents voids or cracks between mineral grains on a plane section and has the smallest values (average = 7. 7 %). The <b>porosity</b> from the helium instrument is an opening <b>porosity.</b> The <b>porosity</b> from the SEM also re{{presents the}} voids on a SEM image. The <b>porosity</b> from mercury injection is an effective <b>porosity.</b> The <b>porosity</b> values from the SEM are closely between the opening and effective <b>porosity</b> values. They have the average values between 30 % and 35 %. In other words, the SEM method can be used to effectively estimate the opening or effective <b>porosity</b> in meso and/or micro scales. © 2004 Elsevier Ltd. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R
25|$|Tiny gas bubbles {{are called}} <b>porosities,</b> but larger gas bubbles are called {{blowholes}} or blisters. Such defects {{can be caused}} by air entrained in the melt, steam or smoke from the casting sand, or other gasses from the melt or mold. (Vacuum holes caused by metal shrinkage (see above) may also be loosely referred to as 'blowholes'). Proper foundry practices, including melt preparation and mold design, can reduce the occurrence of these defects. Because they are often surrounded by a skin of sound metal, blowholes may be difficult to detect, requiring harmonic, ultrasonic, magnetic, or X-ray (i.e., industrial CT scanning) analysis.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: The {{relationship}} between <b>porosity</b> and burial depth of sandstone reservoirs is complex. It depends on primary <b>porosity,</b> which {{is related to}} grain-size and depositional process and also on the <b>porosity</b> gradient (the change in <b>porosity</b> with depth) which, in most cases, is linear. This relationship may be expressed as: ~b u = 4 ~ °-G. D, where ~b u is the <b>porosity</b> at depth D below surface, 4 ~ e is the primary depositional <b>porosity,</b> and G is the <b>porosity</b> gradient in % <b>porosity</b> per 1000 ft (305 m). <b>Porosity</b> gradients decrease with increasing quartz content, abnormal pressures, and {{in the presence of}} hydrocarbons. They increase with increasing geothermal gradient. There are at present insufficient data to quantify these relationships. Empirically derived <b>porosity</b> gradients for North Sea Rotliegendes, Jurassic and Palaeocene reservoir sandstones are 2. 2, 2. 6 and 2. 9 per cent per 1000 ft (305 m) respectively. When calibrated with the <b>porosity</b> spectra of the various facies, graphs can be drawn showing the depth: <b>porosity</b> windows within which economic reservoirs may be found.

30|$|As silicic volatile-rich magma ascends to {{the surface}} and decompresses in {{volcanic}} conduits, the magma vesiculates and its <b>porosity</b> (i.e., gas volume fraction) increases. The <b>porosity</b> changes with depth owing to the competition between the vesiculation and escape of gas from the magma. When gas escape occurs efficiently, the <b>porosity</b> decreases, which may lead to an effusion of a lava dome with a low <b>porosity</b> (Eichelberger et al., 1986; Jaupart and Allegre, 1991; Woods and Koyaguchi, 1994). Recent numerical studies have revealed that the <b>porosity</b> critically depends on magma properties such as viscosity and permeability in dome-forming eruptions and that complex <b>porosity</b> profiles may result as viscosity, permeability, or both change with depth; the <b>porosity</b> increases in the subsurface region, and then decreases near the surface (e.g., Melnik and Sparks, 1999; Diller et al., 2006).
