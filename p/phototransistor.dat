25|$|A <b>phototransistor</b> is a {{light-sensitive}} transistor. A {{common type}} of <b>phototransistor,</b> called a photobipolar transistor, is in essence a bipolar transistor encased in a transparent case so that light can reach the base–collector junction. It was invented by Dr. John N. Shive (more famous for his wave machine) at Bell Labs in 1948, {{but it was not}} announced until 1950. The electrons that are generated by photons in the base–collector junction are injected into the base, and this photodiode current is amplified by the transistor's current gain β (or hfe). If the base and collector leads are used and the emitter is left unconnected, the <b>phototransistor</b> becomes a photodiode. While phototransistors have a higher responsivity for light they are not able to detect low levels of light any better than photodiodes. Phototransistors also have significantly longer response times. Field-effect phototransistors, also known as photoFETs, are light-sensitive field-effect transistors. Unlike photobipolar transistors, photoFETs control drain-source current by creating a gate voltage.|$|E
25|$|Electrically, RO is a {{resistance}} {{controlled by the}} current flowing through the light source. In the dark state, the resistance typically exceeds a few MOhm; when illuminated, it decreases as the inverse of the light intensity. In contrast to the photodiode and <b>phototransistor,</b> the photoresistor can operate in both the AC and DC circuits and have a voltage of several hundred volts across it. The harmonic distortions of the output current by the RO are typically within 0.1% at voltages below 0.5 V.|$|E

The <b>phototransistors</b> were implemented in sizes of 40 × 40 μm 2 and 100 × 100 μm 2. Different base and emitter areas lead to different characteristics of the <b>phototransistors.</b> As starting material a p+ wafer with a p− epitaxial layer on top was used.

40|$|<b>Phototransistors</b> {{based on}} {{monolayer}} transition metal dichalcogenides (TMD) have high photosensitivity {{due to their}} direct band gap transition. However, {{there is a lack}} of understanding of the effect of metal contacts on the performance of atomically thin TMD <b>phototransistors.</b> Here, we fabricate <b>phototransistors</b> based on large-area chemical vapor deposition (CVD) tungsten diselenide (WSe 2) monolayers contacted with the metals of different work function values. We found that the low Schottky-contact WSe 2 <b>phototransistors</b> exhibit a very high photo gain (105) and specific detectivity (1014 Jones), values higher than commercial Si- and InGaAs-based photodetectors; however, the response speed is longer than 5 s in ambient air. In contrast, the high Schottky-contact <b>phototransistors</b> display a fast response time shorter than 23 ms, but the photo gain and specific detectivity decrease by several orders of magnitude. Moreover, the fast response speed of the high Schottky-contact devices is maintained for a few months in ambient air. This study demonstrates that the contact plays an important role in TMD <b>phototransistors,</b> and barrier height tuning is critical for optimizing the photoresponse and photoresponsivity. © 2014 American Chemical Society...|$|R

25|$|Since {{infrared}} (IR) {{remote controls}} use light, they require {{line of sight}} to operate the destination device. The signal can, however, be reflected by mirrors, {{just like any other}} light source. If operation is required where no line of sight is possible, for instance when controlling equipment in another room or installed in a cabinet, many brands of IR extenders are available for this on the market. Most of these have an IR receiver, picking up the IR signal and relaying it via radio waves to the remote part, which has an IR transmitter mimicking the original IR control. Infrared receivers also tend to have a more or less limited operating angle, which mainly depends on the optical characteristics of the <b>phototransistor.</b> However, it's easy to increase the operating angle using a matte transparent object in front of the receiver.|$|E
500|$|John Northrup Shive (February 22, 1913 [...] June 1, 1984) was an American {{physicist}} and inventor. [...] He made notable contributions in electronic engineering and solid-state physics {{during the early}} days of transistor development at Bell Laboratories. [...] In particular, he produced experimental evidence that holes could diffuse through bulk germanium, and not just along the surface as previously thought. This paved the way from Bardeen and Brattain's point contact transistor to Shockley's more-robust junction transistor. Shive is best known for inventing the <b>phototransistor</b> in 1948 (a device that combines the sensitivity to light of a photodiode and the current gain of a transistor), and for the Shive wave machine in 1959 (an educational apparatus used to illustrate wave motion).|$|E

40|$|A {{low-cost}} flowmeter {{would be}} very useful {{in a wide variety}} of monitoring situations. This article discusses the development of such a flowmeter based on optical components and its testing with water in an enclosed flow system. The sensor consisted of two sets of LEDs and <b>phototransistors</b> spaced 4 cm apart, monitoring the optical properties of the fluid at upstream and downstream locations, respectively. A small amount of dye was injected into the flow, which caused a change in the optical properties of the fluid at both locations. The time required for this change to move from the upstream to the downstream locations was determined using the biased estimate of the cross-covariance between the upstream and downstream signals. The velocity was then calculated using this time difference and the known distance between the locations. Tests were conducted at fluid velocities from 0. 125 to 4. 5 m sˉ¹, and separate results were calculated using <b>phototransistors</b> located 45 ° and 180 ° from the LEDs. The mean percent error was between 5 % and 0 % for individual measurements using the 180 ° <b>phototransistors</b> at velocities from 0. 5 to 4. 5 m sˉ¹ and between 2 % and - 8 % for measurements using the 45 ° <b>phototransistors</b> in the same velocity range. Error increased when the velocity was reduced to 0. 5 m sˉ¹ and was greater than 20 % at 0. 125 m sˉ¹ for both sets of <b>phototransistors.</b> A regression model was developed to correct the velocity estimate.

40|$|Having been {{inspired}} by the tremendous progress in material nanoscience and device nanoengineering, hybrid <b>phototransistors</b> combine solution processed colloidal semiconductor quantum dots (QDs) with graphene or two-dimensional (2 D) semiconductor materials. Novel detectors demonstrate ultrahigh photoconductive gain, high and selective photoresponse, low noise, and very high responsivity in visible- and near-infrared ranges. The outstanding performance of <b>phototransistors</b> is primarily due to the strong, selective, and size tunable absorption of QDs and fast charge transfer in 2 D high mobility conductors. However, the relatively small mobility of QD nanomaterials was a technological barrier, which limited the operating rate of devices. Very recent innovations in detector design and significant progress in QD ligand engineering provide effective tools for further qualitative improvements.
