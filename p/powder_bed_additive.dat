40|$|AbstractUnderstanding laser {{interaction}} with metal <b>powder</b> <b>beds</b> {{is critical in}} predicting optimum processing regimes in laser <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> fusion <b>additive</b> manufacturing of metals. In this work, we study the denudation of metal powders that is observed near the laser scan path {{as a function of}} laser parameters and ambient gas pressure. We show that the observed depletion of metal powder particles in the zone immediately surrounding the solidified track is due to a competition between outward metal vapor flux directed away from the laser spot and entrainment of powder particles in a shear flow of gas driven by a metal vapor jet at the melt track. Between atmospheric pressure and ∼ 10  Torr of Ar gas, the denuded zone width increases with decreasing ambient gas pressure and is dominated by entrainment from inward gas flow. The denuded zone then decreases from 10 to 2. 2  Torr reaching a minimum before increasing again from 2. 2 to 0. 5  Torr where metal vapor flux and expansion from the melt pool dominates. The dynamics of the denudation process were captured using high-speed imaging, revealing that the particle movement is a complex interplay among melt pool geometry, metal vapor flow, and ambient gas pressure. The experimental results are rationalized through finite element simulations of the melt track formation and resulting vapor flow patterns. The results presented here represent new insights to denudation and melt track formation that can be important for the prediction and minimization of void defects and surface roughness in additively manufactured metal components...|$|R
40|$|In {{laser welding}} and other processes, such as {{cladding}} and additive manufacturing, the weld bead geometry (depth of penetration and weld width) {{can be controlled}} with different parameters. A common practice is to develop process parameters for a particular application based on an engineering approach using the system parameters i. e. laser power and travel speed. However, {{in such a case}} the process is optimised for a particular system only. This study is focused on understanding of the phenomena controlling the weld profile in conduction welding {{for a wide range of}} beam diameters from 0. 07 mm to 5. 50 mm. It has been shown that the weld bead geometry can be controlled by the spatial and temporal distribution of laser energy on the surface of workpiece, such as power density, interaction time and energy density. This means that similar depths of penetration can be achieved with various optical set-ups. It has been also found that it is more difficult to achieve pure conduction welds with small beam diameters, which are typically used in <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> <b>additive</b> manufacturing, due to high conduction losses and low vaporisation threshold...|$|E
40|$|Metallic <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> <b>additive</b> {{manufacturing}} {{is capable}} of producing complex, functional parts by repeatedly depositing thin layers of powder particles atop of each other whilst selectively melting the corresponding part cross-section into each layer. A weakness with this approach arises when melting overhanging features, which have no prior melted material directly beneath them. This {{is due to the}} lower thermal conductivity of the powder relative to solid material, which as a result leads to an accumulation of heat and thus distortion. The Electron Beam Melting (EBM) process alleviates this to some extent as the powder must first be sintered (by the beam itself) before it is melted, which results in the added benefit of increasing the thermal conductivity. This study thus sought to investigate to what extent the thermal conductivity of local regions in a titanium Ti- 6 Al- 4 V powder bed could be varied by imparting more energy from the beam. Thermal diffusivity and density measurements were taken of the resulting sintered samples, which ranged from being loosely to very well consolidated.

40|$|During {{the last}} decade, the {{development}} in metallic material additive manufacturing (formerly {{also known as}} Rapid Manufacturing, RM or Rapid Tooling, RT) has brought this technology from niche applications and short run tooling to be a competitive method capable of producing complex geometries in industrial grade materials, such as for example injection moulding tool inserts with integrated conformal cooling system. However, while the geometric complexity has little, or no, affection the price or production time in additive manufacturing, this is neither a cheap or particularly “rapid ” manufacturing technology.

40|$|As {{one of the}} <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> fusion <b>additive</b> {{manufacturing}} technologies, {{electron beam}} melting (EBM) is gaining more and more attention due to its near-net-shape production capacity with low residual stress and good mechanical properties. These characteristics also allow EBM built parts {{to be used as}} produced without post-processing. However, the as-built rough surface introduces a detrimental influence on the mechanical properties of metallic alloys. Thereafter, understanding the effects of processing parameters on the part’s surface roughness, in turn, becomes critical. This paper has focused on varying the processing parameters of two types of contouring scanning strategies namely, multispot and non-multispot, in EBM. The results suggest that the beam current and speed function are the most significant processing parameters for non-multispot contouring scanning strategy. While for multispot contouring scanning strategy, the number of spots, spot time, and spot overlap have greater effects than focus offset and beam current. The improved surface roughness has been obtained in both contouring scanning strategies. Furthermore, non-multispot contouring scanning strategy gives a lower surface roughness value and poorer geometrical accuracy than the multispot counterpart under the optimized conditions.

Limitations of the technology as relating to pharmaceuticals have been addressed and prototype dosage forms have been fabricated. The resolution of the 3 DP tablets was found to depend on particle size and liquid migration during printing and drying. The surface finish of 3 DP tablets was enhanced by uniaxial pressing. Migration inhibiting additives were effective in limiting transport. Both aqueous and ethanol-based solutions showed a decrease in migration on the order of 20 % when appropriate <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> <b>additives</b> were introduced. Migration was also decreased by pre-printing barriers to confine secondary printed drug solutions. Low dosage forms were fabricated with as little as 2. 3 nanograms. Lower dosages are expected upon dilution of the initial drug solution. Printing forms with high dosage is limited by powder void volume, filling efficiency, and drug solubility limits. Multiple print passes increased the dosage per tablet volume, 6, at the expense of process time. The use of drug suspensions to overcome solubility limits and uniaxial compression to reduce tablet volume was shown to significantly increase 6. The highest 8 achieved was 427 mg/cc for pressed suspension-printed tablets, representing 74 % of the theoretical limit. Complex oral dosage forms were fabricated with 3 DP to show lagged-release, extended-release, double-release, and zero-order-release.

For the multicomponent alloy Inconel 625, microsegregation between dendrite arms is calculated using the Scheil-Gulliver solidification model and DICTRA software. Phase-field simulations, using Ni-Nb as a binary analogue to Inconel 625, produced microstructures with primary cellular/dendritic arm spacings in agreement with measured spacings in experimentally observed microstructures and a lesser extent of microsegregation than predicted by DICTRA simulations. The composition profiles are used to compare thermodynamic driving forces for nucleation against experimentally observed precipitates identified by electron and X-ray diffraction analyses.

Initially, a common set of parameters were used for all materials and it was found that melt pool could not be sustained in aluminum and steel and only titanium process resulted deep and complete melting and solidification. Optimized process parameter sets are suggested to develop consistent melt pools throughout the build process for aluminum and steel.

The microstructure, analyzed by optical microscopy, SEM/EBSD and X-ray diffraction, consists in fine α lamellae. Numerical reconstruction of the parent β phase highlighted the columnar morphology of the prior β grains, growing along the build direction upon solidification of the melt pool. The presence of grain boundary αGB along the boundaries of these prior β grains {{is indicative of the}} diffusive nature of the β→α phase transformation. Texture analysis of the reconstructed high temperature β phase revealed a strong pole in the build direction. For mechanical characterization, tensile specimens were produced using two different build themes and along several build orientations, revealing that vertically built specimens exhibit a lower yield strength than those built horizontally. The effect of post processing, either mechanical or thermal, was extensively investigated. The influence of surface finish on tensile properties was clearly highlighted. Indeed, mechanical polishing induced an increase in ductility – due to the removal of critical surface defects – as well as a significant increase of the apparent yield strength – caused by the removal of a ~ 150 µm rough surface layer that can be considered as mechanically inefficient and not supporting any tensile load. Thermal post-treatments were performed on electron beam melted specimens, revealing that subtransus treatments induce very moderate microstructural changes, whereas supertransus treatments generate a considerably different type of microstructure, due to the fast β grain growth occurring above the transus.

X-ray Computed Tomography (X-ray CT) scanning indicated that these inclusions were evenly distributed throughout the samples, however the inclusions area was shown to be larger in the load-bearing plane for the vertical specimens.

These technologies {{rely on the}} ability to produce defect free parts through a delicate control of the process. However, this process has not been attempted or has failed for many common metallic materials such as Aluminum. The objective of this thesis was to understand the thermal transport phenomenon in electron and laser beam powder melting technology through simulation and experiments and determine the suitable range of parameters {{that can be used for}} common metallic materials. A finite element model was developed using ANSYS APDL to explore thermal transport and phase change behavior in metallic <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> <b>additive</b> manufacturing processes. To explore a broad base of novel engineering materials, simulations were run in Ti 6 Al 4 V, Inconel 718, Stainless Steel 316 L and Al 7075 in both selective laser melting and {{electron beam}} melting scenarios. Comparison of the four materials in each process showed that it is very challenging to develop and maintain melt pools in aluminum while melt pools are broad and robust in Inconel and titanium, even when subjected to much lower energy densities. Titanium and Inconel were also shown to have larger melt pools and shallower thermal gradients. Effective powder thermal conductivity was used to encapsulate all modes of heat transfer occurring at the inter-particle level and allow the use of macro-level size scale parameters for the finite element analysis. Additionally, an effective liquid conductivity is derived to capture the effects of fluid dynamics and advective transport effects within the melt pool and more accurately predict melt pool geometries without the need for coupled computational fluid dynamics analyses governing the melt pool.

40|$|Nowadays, {{despite the}} growing {{interest}} about metal additive manufacturing, {{only a few}} commercial alloys used for casting are available for these technologies. Therefore, there is the necessity to develop new materials that can exploit the unique opportunities of additive manufacturing processes. The goal of this thesis was to create and characterize new aluminium based materials for <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> <b>additive</b> manufacturing technologies. At first, the feasibility of the production of aluminium matrix composites by laser powder bed fusion (LPBF) was investigated. Three different composites were produced in order to study {{the effect of the}} reinforcement size and properties on the consolidation. Even if the introduction of a ceramic particles alters the consolidation phenomena of the base alloy, the LPBF process allows the production of dense and crack free aluminium matrix composites. The mechanical characterization of these composites revealed that the mechanical properties, and in particular the yield and ultimate strength, are strongly related to the building parameters used during the LPBF process. Regarding the study of existing or new alloys, it was observed that the laser scanning and the phenomena that arise in the melt pool allow the obtainment of an almost homogenous composition even when realizing the alloy in situ, i. e. starting from mixed powders of different composition. A specific alloy that takes advantage from the fast cooling that arises during the laser scanning, and that therefore has excellent mechanical properties, was selected in this study. For both composites and alloys, the laser-powder interaction and the consolidation phenomena were studied and compared by means of single scan tracks analyses which proved to be a promising solution to foresee the behavior of a specific material during the LPBF process. Finally, the effect of a post processing heat treatment on the microstructure on the mechanical properties of LPBF samples was analysed. In most of the cases, the as-built state can be considered as a supersaturated solid solution and therefore a direct-ageing heat treatment allows the achievement of enhanced mechanical properties. This effect was clearly visible on the A 357 alloy and on a modified- 7075 alloy, in which 15 % and 20 % respectively higher hardness values were achieved by the selection of the most suitable ageing heat treatment...|$|E
40|$|This study {{attempts}} {{to develop a}} set of parameters controlling the bead profile of deposits in powder melting, based on the spatial energy distribution of laser. Four parameters, identified as the laser material interaction parameters were used to study the bead profile formation in powder melting. The focus is put on control of the dimensional accuracy of powder deposits independently of the optical set-up and laser system. In the initial stage to understand the effect of welding parameters {{on the development of}} the fusion zone, a solid metal with homogenous and known thermal properties was used. The results indicate that for large beam diameters, typically used in cladding, power density and interaction time control the depth of penetration and beam diameter and interaction time controls the weld width. However, for small beam diameters, typically used in <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> <b>additive</b> manufacturing, it was found that it is more difficult to achieve steady state conduction welds due to high conduction losses to the bulk material and rapid transition to keyhole regime. Therefore, with small beam diameters it is challenging to achieve pure conduction welds, which should guarantee good quality of deposits and low spatter. In the second part, the melting behaviour of solid material and powder for the same material type was compared. The build height in powder melting depends on layer thickness of the deposited powder and energy density, which needs to be provided to fuse the powder to the workpiece, which is equivalent to penetration in laser welding of solids. Similar to solid melting, the build width in powder melting is controlled by beam diameter and the interaction time. It was also found that with small beam diameters and large particle sizes it is more difficult to generate keyhole in the base plate, as compared to solid material. Therefore, despite the presence of spatter in the process, a full keyhole is often not generated. A set of parameters to describe the conduction welding process based on spatial distribution of laser energy has been developed. This enables achievement of a particular weld profile with various optical set-ups and potentially transfers of results between machines. However, more complex melting characteristics of powder requires some additional factors to be included to develop a similar model for powders...|$|E

The yield and ultimate tensile strengths were seen to generally decrease in magnitude with increasing build angle, while a reduction in ductility was observed in some building orientations, and the Young's moduli were typically insensitive to the build angle. The structural behaviour of PBF additive manufactured cross-sections was investigated through a series of square hollow section (SHS) stub column tests, and the results compared with conventionally produced stainless steel SHS. The generated test results have been used to evaluate the applicability of existing design guidance for conventionally produced sections to additive manufactured sections...|$|R
40|$|With the {{paradigm}} shift in personal communications favouring wireless over wired, {{the demand for}} efficient, low-cost, and compact antennas is booming. The proliferation of mobile electronic devices (laptops and tablets, fitness trackers, ‘smart’ phones and watches), together with the desire for longer battery life, poses a unique challenge to antenna designers; there is an unavoidable trade-off between miniaturization and performance (in terms of range and efficiency). The size of an antenna is inherently linked to the wavelengths(s) of the electromagnetic waves that it must transmit and/or receive. Due to real-estate pressures, most modern antennas found in electronics are classed as electrically small, i. e. operating at wavelength(s) many times greater than their largest dimension. Theory dictates that the best possible compromise between size and performance is achievable when an antenna fully occupies a volume, the radius of which is defined by an imaginary sphere circumscribing its largest dimension. This Thesis demonstrates the design and optimization of low-cost, easy-to-fabricate, electrically small antennas through the integration of novel digitated structures into a family of antennas known as inverted-F. The effects of these digitated structures are catalogued using simulated models and measured prototypes throughout. Whereas the limitations of traditional industrial processes might once have constrained the imaginations of antenna designers, there is now tremendous potential in successful exploitation of emergent manufacturing processes – such as additive manufacturing (or 3 D printing) – to realize complex, voluminous antenna designs. This Thesis also presents pioneering measured results for three-dimensional, electrically small antennas fabricated using <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> fusion <b>additive</b> manufacturing. The technology is demonstrated to be well suited for prototyping, with recommendations provided for further maturation. It is hoped that these promising early results spur further investigation and unleash bold new avenues for {{a new class of}} efficient, low-cost, and compact antennas...|$|R
40|$|Ongoing {{research}} efforts in industry and academia {{have a focus}} on optimal build parameters that lead to suitable mechanical properties with minimum defects in parts manufactured by <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> fusion <b>additive</b> manufacturing technologies, such as Electron Beam Melting (EBM) and Selective Laser Melting (SLM). Additional and significant resources, including energy, time, and money are spent {{as a result of}} obligatory post-manufacturing heat and/or mechanical treatment to ensure optimum mechanical properties. One intrinsic fault in these technologies, which contributes to the need for treatment processes after part fabrication, is the creation of residual stresses during these processes. Residual stresses remain in these AM parts after the build process is completed due to plastic deformation resulting from extreme thermal gradients driving thermal expansion and the cool-down phase. Build parameters, such as power and scanning speed, to optimize mechanical properties and lessen these undesirable flaws, are for the most part investigated with a trial-and-error approach. Numerical models, however, offer the less expensive alternative of investigating in depth the nature of residual stresses and thus testing build configurations that may predict and reduce the magnitude of these residual stresses. In this work, the underlying theory for a coupled thermal-displacement finite element model is introduced independently with simple FEA validation problems to build up to a more complex model. Abaqus User Subroutines for the mechanical, thermal, and expansion behavior are developed and tested. These subroutines allows for further definition of a state variable that can be passed along in the solution steps to consider the different phases the material systems go through in these processes. With a prototype model, the coupled-thermal displacement behavior was modelled with success, as the remaining residual stress terms and plastic strain overall agree in principle with published experimental results. ...|$|R

40|$|The {{interaction}} of droplets with powder {{is the key}} set of phenomena that determine many aspects of Three Dimensional Printing (3 DP) including dimensional control and surface finish of the printed part. In the creation of structural ceramic parts by 3 D printing, fine powders {{on the order of}} 1 gm in size must be used. These powders are deposited as slurry and then dried to form a fairly hard cohesive <b>powder</b> <b>bed.</b> The purpose of this work is to understand the {{interaction of}} droplets with such cohesive <b>powder</b> <b>beds,</b> the integration of droplets with previously printed droplets, and to explore print styles which improve the dimensional control and surface finish. Single drop primitives were printed and removed from the <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> and found to resemble discs with a flat top and a rounded bottom with a typical diameter of 180 Vtm and a thickness of 40 [tm. A number of different time domains are defined based on the interaction of droplets with cohesive <b>powder</b> <b>beds.</b> Critical times in defining these domains are: 1) the amount of time it takes for a droplet to splat and spread on the <b>powder</b> <b>bed,</b> 2) the amount of time it takes for the droplet to absorb into a <b>powder</b> <b>bed...</b>|$|R

40|$|This {{dissertation}} explores {{additive manufacturing}} of porous titanium structures for possible use as scaffolds in orthopaedics. Such scaffolds should be tailored {{in terms of}} mechanical properties and porosity to satisfy specific physical and biological needs. In this thesis, powder metallurgy was combined with additive manufacturing to successfully fabricate porous Ti structures. This study describes physical, chemical, and mechanical characterizations of porous titanium implants made by the proposed <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> inkjet-based <b>additive</b> manufacturing process to gain insight into the correlation of process parameters and final physical and mechanical properties of the porous structure. A number of processing parameters were investigated to control the mechanical properties and porosity of the structure. In addition, a model was developed based on the microstructural powder compaction to predict the porosity {{as a function of}} the developed sinter neck among the particles during the sintering process. The produced samples were characterized through several methods including porosity measurement, compression test, Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM), Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (EDX), and shrinkage measurements. Additionally, a new method for manufacturing Ti implants includes encapsulated networks of macro-sized channels was introduced. Also, the influence of different orientations and numbers of channels within the additive-manufactured structures were investigated. The characterization test results showed a level of porosity in the samples in the range of 12 - 43 %, which is within the range of cancellous and cortical bone porosity. The compression test results showed that the porous structure’s compressive strength is in the range of 56 - 1000 MPa, yield strength is in the range of 27 - 383 MPa, and Young’s modulus is in the range of 0. 77 - 11. 46 GPa. This technique of manufacturing porous Ti structures demonstrated a low level of shrinkage with the shrinkage percentage ranging from 1. 5 - 12 %. Also, the experimental results demonstrated excellent agreement with the developed model. Moreover, the novel method of fabricating the encapsulated channel show a reduction in the shear strength to 24 - 30 % that is advantageous for bone implants. The results demonstrate that the channel orientation in the structure affect the shrinkage rate in the parts with vertically orientated channels, in which a relatively isotropic shrinkage in vertical and horizontal directions is achieved after sintering...|$|R
40|$|A conic pyroelectric {{detector}} is employed {{to measure the}} effective reflectances of <b>powder</b> <b>beds</b> of metals, SiC, WC, and graphite. The experimental results are compared with numerical solutions of the radiation transfer equation in a half-infinite homogeneous body with effective radiative properties. The effective albedo and phase function are theoretically estimated by the model of opaque particles with specularly or diffusely reflecting surfaces in the assumption of geometrical optics. The studied <b>powder</b> <b>beds</b> with particles of several tens of microns in diameter are generally described by the model where specular reflection by particle surfaces is assumed corresponding to refraction and extinction indices of materials in the dense form. The model {{does not apply to}} semitransparent particles of SiC. The <b>powder</b> <b>beds</b> of submicron particles of SiC and WC are highly agglomerated and consist of clusters of particles with diameters of several tens of microns. A submicron <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> is found to be considerably less reflective than a micron-sized <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> of the same material. This is described by the model where the agglomerates of submicron particles are treated as large particles with diffusely reflecting surfaces. The effective normal-hemispherical reflectance of a micron-sized <b>powder</b> <b>bed</b> correlates with the hemispherical reflectance of dense material. The observed differences between the experiment and the model can be explained by a systematic error at calibration, oxidation of materials, and diffraction effects. status: publishe...|$|R
