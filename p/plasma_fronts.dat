40|$|An {{experimental}} study of laser-induced spark ignition of flammable, gaseous premixtures is reported, with theoretical interpretations. Ignition was in an explosion bomb, equipped with four variable-speed fans that facilitated the study of quiescent and isotropic turbulent conditions. Good optical access enabled the progress of <b>plasma</b> <b>fronts,</b> shock waves, igniting kernels, and propagating flames to be recorded with high-speed schlieren photography. A focused beam from a Q-switched Nd:YAG laser initiated electrical breakdown, with plasma energies between 85 and 200 mJ. Probabilities of breakdown were found for air and isooctane-air mixtures over ranges of pressures and temperatures. Blast-wave theory applied to shock-wave trajectories enabled initial plasma conditions to be inferred. This suggested electron temperatures of over 10 5 K and very high pressures. Calculated values of the absorption coefficient for the laser beam energy show these plasma properties to be commensurate with the observed energy and size. The ensuing rarefaction wave creates toroidal rings at the {{leading and trailing edges}} of the plasma. The former decays more rapidly and a third lobe of the kernel is generated that moves towards the laser. In flammable mixtures this enhances the flame spread. Laminar flame speeds are overdriven by this gasdynamic effect, {{as well as by the}} high energy of the plasma, to such an extent that the flame speed decays from elevated values as the flame stretch decreases, contrary to the increases that occur with normal flames with positive Markstein numbers. The extent to which turbulence narrows the ignition limits is found experimentally. For mixtures close to the lean flammability limit, strong gasdynamic flows induced by laser ignition can stretch the flames to extinction and narrow the ignition limits. If a flame becomes established, eventually the third lobe disappears as the initial gas dynamic effects decay and are overwhelmed by the imposed flow fields. Nevertheless, the overdrive effects persist for some time and overdriven flames were observed in regimes where normal flames would have quenched...|$|E

In order to explore carrier relaxation in more detail, optical-pump/THz-probeexperiments in the conventional co-propagation geometry were performed.

In [1], the discharge over the surface of a water jet coming from a faucet was studied. The conductivity of water was varied by adding a 12 % salt solution.

A discrete plasma structure was obtained when E 0,rms/Ec≧ 0. 69, where E 0,rms is the root-mean-square of the incident electric field and Ec is the breakdown threshold, because an overcritical field that exceeded the breakdown threshold was formed in a region away from the bulk plasma by the wave reflection when the plasma reflectivity was increased by joule heating. However, a continuous plasma structure with a branching pattern was formed when E 0,rms/Ec< 0. 69 because the enhanced electric-field region away from the bulk plasma never exceeded the breakdown threshold even when the plasma reflectivity increased.

40|$|The {{conventional}} wisdom about solar array arcing in LEO {{is that only}} {{the parts of the}} solar array that are swept over by the arc-generated <b>plasma</b> <b>front</b> are discharged in the initial arc. This limits the amount of energy that can be discharged. Recent work done at the NASA Glenn Research Center has shown that this idea is mistaken. In fact, the capacitance of the entire solar array may be discharged, which for large arrays leads to very large and possibly debilitating arcs, even if no sustained arc occurs. We present the laboratory work that conclusively demonstrates this fact by using a grounded plate that prevents the arc-plasma front from reaching certain array strings. Finally, we discuss the dependence of arc strength and arc pulse width on the capacitance that is discharged, and provide a physical mechanism for discharge of the entire array, even when parts of the array are not accessible to the arc-plasma front.

A temperature‐controlled resonant reflector restricted laser operation to essentially a single‐longitudinal mode.

30|$|It {{has been}} {{estimated}} that the time required for a <b>plasma</b> <b>front</b> to sweep past the geomagnetic field is not more than 30  s, but the observed rise time of SIs is a few minutes. According to the model presented by Dessler et al. (1960), a negative correlation between SI amplitude and rise time can be expected because the larger the distance of the SI source from the observer, the longer the rise time and the smaller the amplitude due to attenuation. The time duration of SI depends on the following: the time taken by the shock front or discontinuity to sweep the geoeffective distance along the magnetosphere, the thickness of the shock front or the discontinuity in the solar wind, inertia of the magnetospheric plasma, and the broadening of the wave front during the passage through the magnetosphere (Nishida 1966).

40|$|The {{quality of}} the ion beam which is {{produced}} by the proton accelerator KALIF depends essentially on {{the properties of the}} anode and cathode plasmas and on electromagnetic fluctuations occuring in the accelerating gap of the diode. For the enhancement of the beam quality the properties of the plasma and the electromagnetic field distribution in the diode gap should be well known. In this thesis, therefore, the properties of the anode plasma were investigated. The measurements of the electron density and temperature and the composition of the anode plasma were carried out through the spectroscopic diagnostic method. The electron density varied form 1 x 10 " 1 " 6 cm"-" 3 early in the KALIF-pulse to 5 x 10 " 1 " 7 cm"-" 3 {{at the end of the}} pulse. The electron temperature grew very fast up to 7 eV early in the pulse. Apart form the hydrogen atoms and ions triple ionized carbon was dominant in the anode plasma. The density of the hydrogen atoms and ions grew continuously during the pulse. For the first time, the dynamics of the magnetic field in the anode plasma of a high-power ion diode could be measured using the Zeeman splitting of CIII and CIV lines. This measurement was time dependent and spatially-resolved. Several important consequences resulted from the diamagnetic field penetration into the anode plasma: the weaker magnetic insulation reduces the diode impedance and may even cause the electron sheath to collapse to the anode, plasma heating by the induced eddy currents leads to exponential growth of the particle density in the plasma. It was further tried to measure the growth of the beam divergence in the accelerating gap. The beam divergence could be determined from the Doppler broadening of a spectral line of carbon which existed as a natural contaminant in the anode plasma. Although the abundance of carbon in the anode plasma was sufficient for the measurement, the carbon ions were not accelerated in sufficient quantities to measure their emission lines in the accelerating gap. We suppose that a sheath of hydrogen ions in front of the anode plasma shields the electric field off from the carbon ions. A measurement performed just near the anode <b>plasma</b> <b>front</b> shows that much of the beam divergence is already created at the anode <b>plasma</b> <b>front.</b> It means that the plasma surface is spatially inhomogeneous.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} diffusion {{equation is}} considered which models the temperature distribution in a laser-sustained plasma subject to wind. As certain parameters are small a singular perturbation problem arises and {{the method of}} matched asymptotic expansions is applied to approximate the solution. An essential role in this problem is played by the <b>plasma</b> <b>front.</b> This is a free surface separating the plasma and non-plasma phases.

This equation is analysed for various wind directions. It appears that for the initial conditions for these parts of this free surface there are different possibilities depending on the wind direction.

Furthermore, the effect of wind on the stability region of the stationary full plasma solution is analysed. The method of analysis presented in this paper is not restricted to the cone-like geometry or the specific form of the non-linearity of the problem considered here, but has potentially a much wider scope.

ICCD imaging on ns and sub-ns time scales, together with measurement {{of the speed of}} the <b>plasma</b> ionization <b>front</b> reveal the specific features of such plasmas. The plasmas are ignited with DBD electrodes and launched into a tube flushed with a moderate flow (a few sccm) of rare gas and powered with high voltage pulses delivered in single shot or repetitive mode up to a few kHz. The plasma expands in a wall hugging mode {{in the vicinity of the}} DBD electrodes gradually switching to a much more homogenous plasma volume during its propagation before inducing a plasma plume in ambient air at the outlet of the capillary. This plasma pattern is associated with two ionization front velocity regimes during which the plasma experiences an order of magnitude deceleration from a few 108 cm/s to a few 107 cm/s in the wall hugging mode and then gradually slows over distances of up to a few tens of cm in the homogenous mode. The influence of pulse repetition rate, dielectric wall permittivity, voltage rising front (either µs or ns) and voltage polarity, will be discussed, while accounting for the roles of the impedance of plasma tail behind the ionization front region and the wall charging processes. For our conditions, photoionization appears to be of minor importance. The plasma triggering, spatial and temporal dependence, and the rather extended <b>plasma</b> <b>front</b> ionization volume (having typical lengths of a few cm) at atmospheric pressure, appear quite different from those measured for conventional unconfined streamer discharges. This suggests that these confined plasma structures are qualitatively different than unconfined structures, and so are called Pulse Atmospheric-pressure Plasma Streams to account for the specific features of such rare gas plasma expanding in dielectric capillaries.

Imaging data with nanosecond time resolution were collected using an intensified CCD camera. This data were used to study the time evolution of plasma morphology, total light emission intensity, and the rate of plasma expansion.

The ignition and plasma propagation inside the 3 mm radius quartz tube are imaged spatially and resolved with nanosecond time resolution using an iCCD camera. The plasma is found to propagate {{in the form of}} a front moving from the launcher to theend of the plasma column with the microwave power being gradually absorbed behind it. The velocity of the <b>plasma</b> <b>front</b> decreases while the plasma goes towards a steady state. The ionization front is found to be strongly non-uniform and various structures as a function of the pulse repetition frequency (i. e. power-off time) are shown in the axial and radial directions. At low frequencies, finger-like structures are found. The plasma becomes more hollow at smaller power-off times. At higher repetition frequencies (kHz regime), a critical repetition frequency is found for which the plasma light intensity sharply increases at the head of the propagation front, taking a shape resembling a plasma bullet. This critical frequency depends on the pressure and power. For even higher frequencies, the bullet shape disappears and plasma volume ignition from the launcher to the end of the plasma column is observed. These results bring a new insight into the ignition mechanisms of pulsed microwave plasmas inside dielectric tubes. A wide variety of effects are found which seem to mostly depend on the background ionization degree. Moreover, the results show that only a 3 D time-dependent model can, in general, correctly describe the ignition of a pulsed microwave discharge...|$|R
