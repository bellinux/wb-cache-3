5|$|INGEMMET (Instituto Geológico Minero y Metalúrgico) of Peru {{released}} internally on September 21 {{a report}} on the Carancas meteorite fall. The release of the document to the public was delayed for one week. The researchers found that the fragments from the crater zone had a chondritic texture and the following mineral composition: <b>pyroxene</b> (1) 40%, olivine 20%, feldspar 10%, <b>pyroxene</b> (2) 10%; kamacite 15%, troilite 5%, and traces of chromite and native copper. Kamacite occurs naturally only in meteorites.|$|E

40|$|The thesis {{describes}} {{a group of}} <b>pyroxenes</b> belonging to a diopside-hedenbergite-acmite series, which come from the alkaline rocks of East and Southern Africa. The <b>pyroxenes</b> have been analysed chemically; and two refractive indices and the specific gravity have been determined. Values obtained for the A' lambda c angle {{have been included in}} the study. The compositions of the <b>pyroxenes</b> depend on the area from which they come and also on the rock types in which they occur; but all the <b>pyroxenes</b> from the African alkaline rocks fall within a well-defined band of composition. It has been found that differences in content of the minor constituents depend both on composition and the area from which they come. The Fe+ 2 /Mg ratio in the more diopsidic <b>pyroxenes,</b> and the Fe+ 3 content in those nearer acmite control the physical properties. <p...|$|R
40|$|Zoning in <b>pyroxenes</b> in martian meteorites {{contains}} a rich {{record of the}} petrogenesis of these samples. In the clinopyroxene cumulate nakhlite group, major element zoning is generally limited to the outer rims of the <b>pyroxenes.</b> However, minor element zoning, especially of Al, Ti, and Cr, is extensive, complex, and difficult to interpret [e. g., 1 - 3]. To help mine the rich information about petrogenetic processes from these samples, we have been comparing minor element zoning in synthetic <b>pyroxenes</b> grown under known conditions with zoning observed in natural nakhlite <b>pyroxenes.</b> We have focused on two nakhlites, MIL 03346 (MIL), {{which is one of}} the most rapidly cooled nakhlites, and Y 000593 (Y 593), which cooled at a more moderate rate [e. g., 4]...|$|R
40|$|We {{present results}} of {{laboratory}} near-infrared reflectance studies {{of a set}} of calcic <b>pyroxenes</b> with comparable calcium contents (Wo 45 - 50) but variable iron content and oxidation states. This new dataset complements earlier published data (Cloutis and Gaffey, 1991, J. Geophys. Res. 96, 22809 - 28826, and references therein). In particular, our new spectra extend the scarce available spectral data on chemically analyzed Fe-rich high-Ca clinopyroxenes. We attempted to interpret the spectral behavior of our samples in terms of chemistry and coordination site occupancies. Tentatively, we conclude that Fe-rich calcic <b>pyroxenes</b> have very low contents of Fe 2 + in the M 2 sites and belong to the spectral type A lacking the 2 -μm band. This may be due to high Ca and Mn contents in these <b>pyroxenes.</b> Fe-poor high-Ca <b>pyroxenes</b> are more spectrally variable. In general, they tend to belong to the spectral type B with two major bands near 1 and 2 μm, unless the samples have high Fe 3 +/Fe 2 + ratios or are rich in Mn and Ca. Some of them (including unusual meteorite Angra dos Reis) are of type B despite very high Ca contents. We applied the Modified Gaussian Model (MGM) to characterize three major Fe 2 + absorption bands in the 1 -μm region of the spectra of Ca-rich <b>pyroxenes.</b> Only the band due to Fe 2 + in the M 1 coordination site near 1. 15 μm may be potentially useful to estimate the Fe content in calcic <b>pyroxenes</b> on remotely-sensed surfaces of Solar System bodies. The spectral variability of basaltic meteorites (angrites that are rich in calcic <b>pyroxenes</b> is also discussed. The presence of spectral type A calcic: <b>pyroxenes</b> in these meteorites complicates unambiguous identification of olivine in asteroid spectra...|$|R
5|$|Spectroscopic {{studies of}} the Junonian surface permit the {{conclusion}} that Juno could be the progenitor of chondrites, a common type of stony meteorite composed of iron-bearing silicates such as olivine and <b>pyroxene.</b> Infrared images reveal that Juno possesses an approximately 100km-wide crater or ejecta feature, {{the result of a}} geologically young impact.|$|E
5|$|Petrographically, the {{composition}} of the cluster ranges from andesite to dacite with SiO2 ranging from 62.8% to 65.7%. Andesites appear as lava flows while dacites form lava domes and dome complexes. The rocks from the main Aucanquilcha volcano are uniformly dacitic and show little evidence of temporal variation in their composition. Potassium content ranges from 1.5 to 4%. Plagioclase is the dominant component of the magma. Clinopyroxene+orthopyroxene+amphibole (hornblende and pargasite) or amphibole+biotite+minor amounts of <b>pyroxene</b> are subordinate components. Apatite, ilmenite, magnetite and zircon can also be found. There is evidence of magma mixing and mingling.|$|E
5|$|The {{composition}} of some lava flows in the Wells Gray-Clearwater volcanic field is unusual because they include small, angular to rounded fragments of rock called nodules and crystals {{that come from}} the mantle. These green nodules are known as peridotites because they are mostly made of a magnesium iron silicate mineral called olivine. These lava flows also comprise large crystals of olivine, plagioclase, and <b>pyroxene</b> that crystallized deep within the Earth's crust and mantle. The lavas and nodules they contain {{are similar to those}} erupted at Volcano Mountain in the Yukon. The nodules help volcanologists and other geoscientists to verify what the mantle beneath the volcanic field is like.|$|E

Composition fields of <b>pyroxenes</b> were obtained for these asteroids by the value of (u-x) and 505 -nm ferrous absorption band position within the <b>pyroxenes</b> quadrilateral. <b>Pyroxenes</b> of the S-asteroids from Apollo-Amor which have spectral parameters similar to achondrites may be presented by the diopside series...|$|R

5|$|The {{principal}} rock is dacite, rich in potassium. The rocks have a porphyric {{appearance and}} contain few vesicles. They {{are also very}} rich in crystals, with the dominant phenocryst-forming minerals being biotite, hornblende and plagioclase. Less important are allanite, apatite, clinopyroxene, olivine, orthopyroxene, quartz, sphene and zircon. The groundmass contains plagioclase, <b>pyroxene,</b> silicon dioxide and oxides of iron and titanium. The composition of Ciomadul's rocks has been fairly constant throughout its evolution, and this diversity of its components indicate that the genesis of Ciomadul magmas involved mixing between felsic and mafic magma.|$|E
5|$|Based on spectroscopic observations, {{the primary}} {{component}} of the material on Pallas's surface is a silicate containing little iron and water. Minerals of this type include olivine and <b>pyroxene,</b> which are found in CM chondrules. The surface composition of Pallas {{is very similar to}} the Renazzo carbonaceous chondrite (CR) meteorites, which are even lower in hydrous minerals than the CM type. The Renazzo meteorite was discovered in Italy in 1824 {{and is one of the}} most primitive meteorites known. Pallas's visible and near-infrared spectrum is almost flat, being slightly brighter in towards the blue. There is only one clear absorption band in the 3-micron part, which suggests an anhydrous component mixed with hydrated CM-like silicates.|$|E
5|$|Molybdenum is the 54th most {{abundant}} {{element in the}} Earth's crust and the 25th {{most abundant}} element in its oceans, {{with an average of}} 10parts per billion; it is the 42nd most abundant element in the Universe. The Russian Luna 24 mission discovered a molybdenum-bearing grain (1 × 0.6µm) in a <b>pyroxene</b> fragment taken from Mare Crisium on the Moon. The comparative rarity of molybdenum in the Earth's crust is offset by its concentration in a number of water-insoluble ores, often combined with sulfur {{in the same way as}} copper, with which it is often found. Though molybdenum is found in such minerals as wulfenite (PbMoO4) and powellite (CaMoO4), the main commercial source is molybdenite (MoS2). Molybdenum is mined as a principal ore and is also recovered as a byproduct of copper and tungsten mining.|$|E

We show that the anisotropic orbital ordering results in the spin-gap formation in NaTiSi$_ 2 $O$_ 6 $. The detailed analysis of different contributions to the intrachain exchange interactions for <b>pyroxenes</b> is performed both analytically using perturbation theory and basing on the {{results of the}} band structure calculations. The antiferromagnetic $t_{ 2 g}-t_{ 2 g}$ exchange is found to decrease gradually in going from Ti to Fe. It turns out to be nearly compensated by ferromagnetic interaction between half-filled $t_{ 2 g}$ and empty $e_g$ orbitals in Cr-based <b>pyroxenes.</b> The fine-tuning of the interaction parameters by the crystal structure results in the ferromagnetism for NaCrGe$_ 2 $O$_ 6 $. Further increase {{of the total number of}} electrons and occupation of $e_g$ sub-shell makes the $t_{ 2 g}-e_g$ contribution and total exchange interaction antiferromagnetic for Mn- and Fe-based <b>pyroxenes.</b> Strong oxygen polarization was found in Fe-based <b>pyroxenes.</b> It is shown that this effect leads to a considerable reduction of antiferromagnetic intrachain exchange. The obtained results may serve as a basis for the analysis of diverse magnetic properties of <b>pyroxenes,</b> including those with recently discovered multiferroic behavior.

5|$|The {{continental}} crust {{consists of}} lower density material {{such as the}} igneous rocks granite and andesite. Less common is basalt, a denser volcanic rock that is the primary constituent of the ocean floors. Sedimentary rock is formed from the accumulation of sediment that becomes buried and compacted together. Nearly 75% of the continental surfaces are covered by sedimentary rocks, although they form about 5% of the crust. The third form of rock material found on Earth is metamorphic rock, which is created from the transformation of pre-existing rock types through high pressures, high temperatures, or both. The most abundant silicate minerals on Earth's surface include quartz, feldspars, amphibole, mica, <b>pyroxene</b> and olivine. Common carbonate minerals include calcite (found in limestone) and dolomite.|$|E
5|$|The magma in {{volcanic}} pipes {{is usually}} {{one of two}} characteristic types, which cool into igneous rock known as either kimberlite or lamproite. The magma itself does not contain diamond; instead, it acts as an elevator that carries deep-formed rocks (xenoliths), minerals (xenocrysts), and fluids upward. These rocks are characteristically rich in magnesium-bearing olivine, <b>pyroxene,</b> and amphibole minerals which are often altered to serpentine by heat and fluids during and after eruption. Certain indicator minerals typically occur within diamantiferous kimberlites and are used as mineralogical tracers by prospectors, who follow the indicator trail back to the volcanic pipe which may contain diamonds. These minerals are rich in chromium (Cr) or titanium (Ti), elements which impart bright colors to the minerals. The most common indicator minerals are chromium garnets (usually bright red chromium-pyrope, and occasionally green ugrandite-series garnets), eclogitic garnets, orange titanium-pyrope, red high-chromium spinels, dark chromite, bright green chromium-diopside, glassy green olivine, black picroilmenite, and magnetite. Kimberlite deposits are known as blue ground for the deeper serpentinized part of the deposits, or as yellow ground for the near surface smectite clay and carbonate weathered and oxidized portion.|$|E
5|$|The {{rotation}} and amplitude of Haumea's light curve were argued to place strong constraints on its composition. If Haumea were in hydrostatic equilibrium {{and had a}} low density like Pluto, with a thick mantle of ice over a small rocky core, its rapid rotation would have elongated it {{to a greater extent}} than the fluctuations in its brightness allow. Such considerations constrained its density to a range of 2.6–3.3 g/cm3. By comparison, the Moon, which is rocky, has a density of 3.3 g/cm3, whereas Pluto, which is typical of icy objects in the Kuiper belt, has a density of 1.86 g/cm3. Haumea's possible high density covered the values for silicate minerals such as olivine and <b>pyroxene,</b> which make up many of the rocky objects in the Solar System. This also suggested that the bulk of Haumea was rock covered with a relatively thin layer of ice. A thick ice mantle more typical of Kuiper belt objects may have been blasted off during the impact that formed the Haumean collisional family.|$|E
40|$|Dhofar 019 {{is a new}} basaltic {{shergottite}} {{found in}} Oman. It is mainly composed of <b>pyroxenes,</b> plagioclase glass, and olivine. Olivine grains show variable size distributions from large (∿ 1 mm) non-euhedral zoned grains with magnesian cores (Fa_) to small euhedral homogeneous grains with variable compositions (Fa_). This may suggest {{that some of the}} Dhofar 019 olivines are xenocrysts and others are phenocrysts. The Dhofar 019 olivines are compositionally distinct from those in other shergottites. <b>Pyroxenes</b> are extensively zoned, and pigeonite cores are usually surrounded with augite rims, suggesting undercooling of magma to a similar degree as that of EETA 79001 (lithology A) and Zagami. There appears to be a compositional change in major and minor elements from the magnesian <b>pyroxenes</b> to ferroan <b>pyroxenes</b> for both pigeonite and augite. The magnesian parts have similar compositions to EETA 79001 (lithology A) <b>pyroxenes,</b> and the ferroan parts are similar to Zagami <b>pyroxenes.</b> Plagioclase zoning in Dhofar 019 more closely resembles that of Zagami. Spinel compositions in Dhofar 019 overlap those of EETA 79001,and the Dhofar 019 chromite may be a xenocryst like EETA 79001. The cooling rate of Dhofar 019 calculated from Fe-Mg zoning profiles of olivine is 0. 05 - 0. 1 ℃/hour. This corresponds to a burial depth of ∿ 5 m from the martian surface, possibly in a lava flow. Thus, the groundmass crystallization of Dhofar 019 occurred near the martian surface, although it is likely that Dhofar 019 has experienced a complex history...|$|R

40|$|SUMMARY. Chemical, optical, and X-ray {{data are}} {{presented}} for <b>pyroxenes</b> from a representative selection of chondrites. The Mg-Fe <b>pyroxenes</b> originally crystallized above iooo-q 2 oo ~ as the protoenstatite-protohypersthene polymorph, and inverted on cooling to the polysynthetically twinned clinoenstatite-clinohypersthene polymorph. In most chondrites the latter became converted to orthopyroxene during recrystallization at temperatures ranging up to 9 oo to 950 ~ The contents of certain minor elements changed uring the clino-ortho inversion.
