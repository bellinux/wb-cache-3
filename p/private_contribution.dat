In April 2002 the painting was auctioned for an equivalent of US$1 million. The purchase was financed by the Russian philanthropist Vladimir Potanin, who donated funds to the Russian Ministry of Culture, and ultimately, to the State Hermitage Museum collection. According to the Hermitage website, this was the largest <b>private</b> <b>contribution</b> to state art museums since the October Revolution.|$|E
25|$|Amtrak {{commenced}} {{operations in}} 1971 with $40million in direct federal aid, $100million in federally insured loans, and a somewhat larger <b>private</b> <b>contribution.</b> Officials expected that Amtrak would break even by 1974, but those expectations proved unrealistic and annual direct federal aid reached a 17-year high in 1981 of $1.25billion. During the Reagan administration, appropriations were halved and by 1986, federal support fell to a decade low of $601million, {{almost none of}} which were capital appropriations. In the late 1980s and early 1990s, Congress continued the reductionist trend even while Amtrak expenses held steady or rose. Amtrak was forced to borrow to meet short-term operating needs, and by 1995 Amtrak {{was on the brink}} of a cash crisis and was unable to continue to service its debts. In response, in 1997 Congress authorized $5.2billion for Amtrak over the next five years – largely to complete the Acela capital project – on the condition that Amtrak submit to the ultimatum of self-sufficiency by 2003 or liquidation. While Amtrak made financial improvements during this period, it did not achieve self-sufficiency.|$|E

To explain this variation, a model of dual provision is developed that endogenizes public and private funding. Members of the economy vote over an income tax that finances public supply of the good, and they vote on whether to permit <b>private</b> <b>contributions.</b> While permitting <b>private</b> <b>contributions</b> may lead to a reduction in total provision of the good, a majority always favors permitting <b>private</b> <b>contributions.</b> Results are developed for small and large economies, and the relevance of excludability and non-congestion are investigated.

2500|$|In 2008, a {{proposal}} was initiated {{to construct a}} new railway line from Perungudi MRTS station in Chennai to Pondicherry via Old Mahabalipuram Road (OMR) and East Coast Road (ECR). The line emanating from Perungudi MRTS station is envisaged to be 179km long {{and is expected to}} traverse via Sholinganallur, SIPCOT, Kovalam, Tiruporur, Mamallapuram, Kalpakkam, Koovathur, Cheyyur, Marakkanam, Kunimedu, Kuiyilappalayam, Jipmer in Pondicherry, Bahour, Varakalpattu, and Tirupadipuliyur to reach Cuddalore Port Jn. The railway line would run on an embankment. There was also {{a proposal}} to extend the line up to Karaikal via Mayiladuthurai. The railway line was sanctioned in the 2007 supplementary budget with an estimated cost of [...] 5,230 million. However, there has been a delay owing to lack of funds and the project is expected to be completed in about 10 years. To expedite the project, the railway board is looking out for multiple options including <b>private</b> <b>contribution,</b> although the model is not yet finalised. There are also alternative plans of beginning or linking the line to Chengalpet. This railway corridor is expected to reduce the travel time between Chennai and Pondicherry to two hours against five hours along the present route via Villupuram. In Oct-2013, the state government started acquiring land for the 179-km project. At that time the project was estimated to cost [...] 8,000 million.|$|E
60|$|This has surely {{much more}} {{the air of}} a table of proscription than an act of grace. What must we suppose the laws {{concerning}} those good subjects to have been, of which this is a relaxation? I know well that there is a cant language current, about the difference between an exclusion from employments, even to the most rigorous extent, and an exclusion from the natural benefits arising from a man's own industry. I allow, that, under some circumstances, the difference is very material in point of justice, and that there are considerations which may render it advisable for a wise government to keep the leading parts of every branch of civil and military administration in hands of the best trust; but a total exclusion from the commonwealth is a very different thing. When a government subsists (as governments formerly did) on an estate of its own, with but few and inconsiderable revenues drawn from the subject, then the few officers which existed in such establishments were naturally at the disposal of that government, which paid the salaries out of its own coffers: there an exclusive preference could hardly merit the name of proscription. Almost the whole produce of a man's industry at that time remained in his own purse to maintain his family. But times alter, and the whole estate of government is from <b>private</b> <b>contribution.</b> When a very great portion of the labor of individuals goes to the state, and is by the state again refunded to individuals, through the medium of offices, and in this circuitous progress from the private to the public, and from the public again to the private fund, the families from whom the revenue is taken are indemnified, and an equitable balance {{between the government and the}} subject is established. But if a great body of the people who contribute to this state lottery are excluded from all the prizes, the stopping the circulation with regard to them may be a most cruel hardship, amounting in effect to being double and treble taxed; and it will be felt as such to the very quick, by all the families, high and low, of those hundreds of thousands who are denied their chance in the returned fruits of their own industry. This is the thing meant by those who look upon the public revenue only as a spoil, and will naturally wish to have as few as possible concerned in the division of the booty. If a state should be so unhappy as to think it cannot subsist without such a barbarous proscription, the persons so proscribed ought to be indemnified by the remission of a large part of their taxes, by an immunity from the offices of public burden, and by an exemption from being pressed into any military or naval service.|$|E

There is a surprisingly decisive comparative statics result (with a nice proof) that if public goods and private goods are both normal goods, then increases in the subsidy rate necessarily increase the equilibrium supply of public goods. Two other models are studied, in which small changes in tax rates and government provision of public goods are neutralized in equilibrium by offsetting changes in <b>private</b> <b>contributions.</b> We explain the differences in these models that lead to opposing conclusions. ...|$|R
