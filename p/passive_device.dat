25|$|T-72B3 (Ob'yekt 184-M3): this upgrade was {{initiated}} in 2010 using old stocks of T-72B tanks held in reserve. In addition to performing a general overhaul of every vehicle, certain tanks were {{equipped with the}} more powerful V-92S2 engines, a new steering system in the driver's compartment and older tracks were replaced with the new universal, twin-pin design. The upgrade program focuses instead on improving the tank's firepower, mainly through {{the implementation of the}} Kalina fire control system, albeit in a simplified form. The tank commander retains an upgraded version of the legacy TKN-3MK sight, which is a <b>passive</b> <b>device</b> with a range of only 600 m at night, but is augmented with a monitor that displays thermal imagery from the gunner's main sight. The commander also has a new turret control panel. The gunner still has the 1A40-4 FCS with 1K13-49 sight, but these are now part of the auxiliary sighting system to complement the new PNM Sosna-U panoramic multi-spectral sensor, which replaced the TPN-3-49 in its mounting. The Sosna-U is a multi-channel, panoramic sight stabilized in both vertical and horizontal axes with a built-in laser rangefinder and command guidance module used with 9M119M missiles. The most advantageous aspect of the Sosna-U is the Thales Catherine-FC thermal imager which extends the detection and identification range of a tank-sized target to 10,500 m and 2,200 m respectively, at night/day and in all weather combat conditions. The T-72B3 series vehicles also received the new 2A46M5 main gun which has a dispersion value significantly lower than previous generations, and reportedly equivalent to the Rheinmetall Rh120 L/44 cannon. The gun laying and stabilization drives were also replaced with the new 2E42-4 system and the AZ ammunition auto-loader was appropriately modified to accommodate newer generations of long-rod (up to 730mm) saboted kinetic energy anti-tank ammunition: the Svinets-1 (using a depleted uranium penetrator) and Svinets-2 (sintered tungsten alloy) rounds, which were fielded in 2002 and reportedly capable of defeating 740–800mm and 660–740mm of RHA at 2,000 m respectively. Only the most recent T-72B3 tanks however feature this capability. Furthermore, the B3 upgrade includes a new explosion and fire suppression system, as well as an advanced VHF radio system designated R-168-25U-2 AKVEDUK. Entered service on 19 October 2012. First delivered to the 20th Field Army in summer 2013 and its Armored Guards Brigade in October 2013. More than 1,000 such tanks are currently in service.|$|E
500|$|Atomic line filters may {{operate in}} the ultraviolet, visible and {{infrared}} regions of the electromagnetic spectrum. In absorption-re-emission ALFs, the frequency of light must be shifted {{in order for the}} filter to operate, and in a <b>passive</b> <b>device,</b> this shift must be to a lower frequency (i.e. red shifted) simply because of energy conservation. This means that passive filters are rarely able to work with infrared light, because the output frequency would be impractically low. If photomultiplier tubes (PMTs) are used then the [...] "output wavelength of the ARF should lie in a spectral region in which commercial, large-area, long-lived PMT's [...] possess maximum sensitivity". In such a case, active ALFs would have the advantage over passive ALFs as they would more readily, [...] "generate output wavelengths in the near UV, the spectral region in which well-developed photocathodes possess their highest sensitivity".|$|E
500|$|The {{coupling}} factor represents the primary property of a directional coupler. [...] Coupling factor {{is a negative}} quantity, it cannot exceed [...] for a <b>passive</b> <b>device,</b> and in practice does not exceed [...] since more than this would result in more power output from the coupled port than power from the transmitted port – in effect their roles would be reversed. [...] Although a negative quantity, the minus sign is frequently dropped (but still implied) in running text and diagrams and a few authors {{go so far as}} to define it as a positive quantity. [...] Coupling is not constant, but varies with frequency. [...] While different designs may reduce the variance, a perfectly flat coupler theoretically cannot be built. [...] Directional couplers are specified in terms of the coupling accuracy at the frequency band center.Vizmuller, p.101 ...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the method of}} recording nonreciprocal passive multipoles containing gyrotropic medium with analysis of linear lumped electric circuits. Nonreciprocal <b>passive</b> <b>devices</b> are designed for meter and decameter wave ranges {{on the basis of}} nonreciprocal effects of helicon waves propagation in magnetized solid-state plasma. The base element for nonreciprocal <b>passive</b> <b>devices</b> is nonreciprocal transformer containing a helicon resonator. Various schemes of nonreciprocal transformer connection, combined with additional reactive components, are used to design the various nonreciprocal <b>passive</b> <b>devices</b> such as isolator, circulator and gyrator. The resulted dimensions of nonreciprocal <b>passive</b> <b>devices</b> are smaller than the wavelength and must be analyzed using lumped theory of circuits. The paper provides an insight into the methods of calculation of circuit parameters of the nonreciprocal transformer based on helicon resonator and three specific nonreciprocal <b>passive</b> <b>devices</b> based on it. The paper also proposes a method of insertion of nonreciprocal <b>passive</b> <b>devices</b> to the matrix of conduction of the nodal model of lumped circuit. It has been demonstrated that the nonreciprocal <b>passive</b> <b>devices</b> based on gyrotropic medium are exceptions from the reciprocity theorem. ?????? ????????? ?????????? ?????? ????? ?????????? ????????? ???????????????, ?????????? ??????????? ?????, ??? ??????? ????????????? ????? ? ???????????????? ??????????? ?? ??????? ??????????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ????????? ? ????????????? ?????????? ????. ?? ?????? ?????????? ???????? ??????????????? ??????????? ???? ? ????????????? ?????? ???????? ???? ??????????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ????. ??????? ????????? ??? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ???????? ?????????? ????????????? ?? ?????? ???????????? ??????????. ?????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ? ????????? ? ??????????????? ??????????? ???????????? ??????????? ???????, ??????????, ???????. ?????????? ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ????? ???????? ??????? ????? ????? ? ??????? ??????? ???????? ?????? ????? ? ???????????????? ???????????. ??????????? ?????? ??????? ??????? ?????????? ??????????? ?????????????? ?? ?????? ???????????? ?????????? ? ???? ????????? ?????????? ????????? ?? ??? ??????. ????????? ????? ????? ?????????? ????????? ????????? ? ??????? ???????????? ??????? ?????? ??? ??????? ???? ??????? ??????? ???????????. ????????, ??? ?????????? ????????? ?????????? ?? ??????????? ?????? ?????????? ?????????? ?? ??????? ??????????...|$|R

40|$|The {{efficiency}} of a solar liquid collector {{can be improved}} by augmenting heat transfer from the tube to the working fluid.

Solar liquid collectors can also be enhanced by these active and <b>passive</b> <b>devices.</b> The <b>passive</b> <b>devices</b> do not require any external source of power and they do not harm structure of the tube or weaken the strength of tube material. For the same reasons <b>passive</b> <b>devices</b> are most widely used heat transfer augmentation techniques. Initially twisted tape inserts and conical inserts were popular devices used in enhanced solar liquid collectors mainly because of availability of established correlations of design parameters.
