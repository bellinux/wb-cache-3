25|$|Whites (including Non-Hispanic Whites) have {{historically}} {{made up the}} overwhelming majority (usually between eighty and ninety percent) of the total United States population. The United States historically had few Hispanics, Asians, and Native Americans, especially before the late twentieth century. Most Asian Americans historically lived in the western United States. The Hispanic and Asian <b>population</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> has rapidly increased {{in the late twentieth}} and twenty-first centuries, and the African American percentage of the U.S. population is slowly increasing as well since reaching a low point of less than ten percent in 1930.|$|E
25|$|The {{issue of}} extramarital sex has been {{examined}} {{frequently in the}} United States. Many surveys asking about extramarital sex in the United States have relied on convenience samples. A convenience sample means surveys are given to whoever happens to be easily available (e.g., volunteer college students or volunteer magazine readers). Convenience samples do not accurately reflect the <b>population</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>United</b> <b>States</b> as a whole, which can cause serious biases in survey results. It should not be surprising, therefore, that surveys of extramarital sex in the United States have produced widely differing results. These studies report that about 12–26% of married women and 15–43% of married men engage in extramarital sex.|$|E
