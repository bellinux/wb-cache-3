50|$|Kodak {{claims that}} Ultima <b>picture</b> <b>paper</b> had been tested to last 162 years. This was disputed by Wilhelm Imaging Research, {{who claimed that}} it only lasted about ten years.

The studies, spanning 18 years, were presented at IS&T's Thirteenth International Symposium on Photofinishing Technologies (IS&T, February 2004, Volume 13).In addition, the 120 lux level has been used by photographic companies for decades. Wilhelm Imaging Research has used a 450 lux level, which is often cited as an ideal viewing condition, but is not typical of a home environment.|$|E

50|$|On 14 July 1877 Leopold Ullstein {{purchased}} the Neue Berliner Tageblatt newspaper, {{a subsidiary of}} the liberal Berliner Tageblatt published by Rudolf Mosse, and on 1 January 1878 converted it into the Berliner Zeitung (B.Z.).

The B.Z. am Mittag, relaunched in 1904, became Germany's first tabloid newspaper. On the other hand, Ullstein's sons on 1 January 1914 acquired the reputable Vossische Zeitung, a liberal newspaper with a tradition dating back to 1617, while the left-wing Berliner Morgenpost established in 1898 reached a high number of subscribers.

It was the almost instant popularity of this famous strip that directly brought national syndication into being. Midwestern and other papers began writing to the Chicago Tribune, which also published The Gumps, requesting to be allowed to use the new comic, and the result was that the heads of the two papers collaborated and founded the Chicago Tribune New York News Syndicate, which soon was distributing Tribune-News features to every nook and cranny of the country.|$|E

Armstrong was promoted to various governments as an [...] "ambassador without portfolio for world peace." [...] In that role he did not so much represent the Worldwide Church of God or Ambassador College as he did a completely new entity called the Ambassador International Cultural Foundation (AICF). This foundation helped to finance the Tatum O'Neal motion <b>picture</b> <b>Paper</b> Moon and a new and slick commercial publication called Quest; bought Everest House, a publishing company; and turned the Ambassador Auditorium, located on the college campus in Pasadena, into a performing arts venue that boasted an annual subscription series featuring world-renowned performers and celebrities from stage, screen and the recording arts. Gifts from the foundation helped Rader secure the audiences with world leaders for the elder Armstrong, whose message was less an overt Christian one than a more general one about peace, brotherly love, giving instead of getting, and a [...] "great unseen hand from someplace" [...] intervening in world affairs.|$|E

40|$|Millisecond pulsar PSR J 0218 + 4232 shows {{remarkable}} high-energy properties: {{very hard}} pulsed X-ray emission up to ~ 10 keV and a likely detection of high-energy gamma-rays (> 100 MeV) {{with a soft}} spectrum. The relative phasing of the X-ray and gamma-ray profiles, however, was unknown. A recently performed Chandra (0. 08 - 10 keV) observation of PSR J 0218 + 4232 settled the phasing down to 0. 2 millisecond, and shows that the X-ray pulses are aligned with the gamma-ray pulses providing supporting evidence for our first detection of high-energy gamma-rays from this source. The preliminary results from a recent RXTE (2 - 250 keV) observation (27 - 12 - 2001 [...] 7 - 01 - 2002) show significant pulsed emission, in a complex profile, up to ~ 20 keV.
