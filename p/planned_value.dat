50|$|BCWP is contrasted to Budgeted Cost for Work Scheduled (BCWS) {{also called}} <b>Planned</b> <b>Value</b> (PV). BCWS {{is the sum}} of the budget items for all work packages, {{planning}} packages, and overhead which was scheduled for the period, rather than the cost of the work actually performed.|$|E
5000|$|ETC is the {{estimate}} to complete the remaining work of the project. ETC {{must be based on}} objective measures of the outstanding work remaining, typically based on the measures or estimates used to create the original <b>planned</b> <b>value</b> (PV) profile, including any adjustments to predict performance based on historical performance, actions being taken to improve performance, or acknowledgement of degraded performance.|$|E
50|$|In {{addition}} to managing technical and schedule performance, large and complex projects require that cost performance be monitored and reviewed at regular intervals. To measure cost performance, <b>planned</b> <b>value</b> (or BCWS - Budgeted Cost of Work Scheduled) and earned value (or BCWP - Budgeted Cost of Work Performed) {{must be in}} units of currency (the same units that actual costs are measured.) In large implementations, the <b>planned</b> <b>value</b> curve is commonly called a Performance Measurement Baseline (PMB) and may be arranged in control accounts, summary-level planning packages, planning packages and work packages. In large projects, establishing control accounts is the primary method of delegating responsibility and authority to {{various parts of the}} performing organization. Control accounts are cells of a responsibility assignment (RACI) matrix, which is the intersection of the project WBS and the organizational breakdown structure (OBS). Control accounts are assigned to Control Account Managers (CAMs). Large projects require more elaborate processes for controlling baseline revisions, more thorough integration with subcontractor EVM systems, and more elaborate management of procured materials.|$|E

He remarried Stephanie in 2003 in Nantucket.|$|R
50|$|Prior to the mid-1970s, Bucharest, as {{most other}} cities, was {{developed}} by expanding the city, especially towards the south, east, and west. High density dormitory neighbourhoods were built at {{the outskirts of the}} city. Some, such as Drumul Taberei, Titan, and Giurgiului have architectural and/or urban <b>planning</b> <b>value.</b>|$|R
50|$|Only two brands {{were able}} to reach the 2008 planned goal of 140 g/km: Fiat, with a value of 133.7 g/km and Peugeot, with 138.1 g/km. The Fiat Auto Group (including the Fiat, Alfa Romeo, Lancia, Abarth, Ferrari and Maserati brands) was the only group to reach the <b>planned</b> <b>value,</b> {{averaging}} 138.4 g/km. The average for the whole car market for 2008 is 153.7 g/km, so the target has not been achieved.|$|E
5000|$|Cost is {{the planned}} cost estimate-to-complete (Cost ETC) of the project. This {{can usually be}} derived from earned value {{management}} planning by using the complement of the <b>planned</b> <b>value</b> (PV) (i.e., budgeted cost of work performed, or BCWS), which estimates what the sunk cost will be at key reporting points during the project. By subtracting the PV from budget, the expected sunk cost at any point during project execution is factored out.|$|E
50|$|Mercury-Redstone 3 finally {{lifted off}} at 9:34 a.m. ET, watched by an {{estimated}} 45 million television viewers in the United States. Shepard {{was subjected to}} a maximum acceleration of 6.3g just before the Redstone engine shut down, two minutes and 22 seconds after launch. Freedom 7's space-fixed velocity was 5134 mph, close to the <b>planned</b> <b>value.</b> Ten seconds later, the escape tower was jettisoned. At the three-minute mark, the automated attitude control system rotated Freedom 7, turning it so the heat shield faced forward ready for re-entry.|$|E
50|$|The {{foundation}} of Anglo-American <b>planning</b> <b>values</b> {{has long been}} guided by a yearning to implement utopian ideals. This starts with planning institutions where academics and practitioners practice, where institutional reform is a constant focus. By reforming institutions, planners believe they can improve core issues in the practice and process of planning.|$|R
50|$|The 2008 {{financial}} crisis did not impact Omaha {{as much as}} {{other areas of the}} country. In addition, the recovery in residential construction in Downtown Omaha was much swifter than the suburban west Omaha. Many new residential developments have been completed or are ongoing. The list below totals 2,063 new units completed or <b>planned</b> <b>valued</b> at approximately $478 million.|$|R
50|$|Certification {{is done on}} {{the basis}} of <b>planning</b> <b>values</b> and thus offers no {{guarantee}} that these values are actually met. Research by the University of Applied Sciences, Business and Social Work in St. Gallen, Switzerland, has proven that refurbishment projects and single-family homes are better than the standard. Larger residential buildings sometimes do not quite meet the standards.|$|R
50|$|To {{adequately}} {{service the}} anticipated new airport, an existing rail line from Olsztyn to Szczytno (line 219) and {{a section of}} the disused railway 35 line between Szczytno and Szymany were renovated. The renovation allows trains to travel at up to 100 kilometres per hour on a single-track line without electrification. The tender was closed in 2011. Later on a short branch line to the airport and a new station at the airport connected the service. Overall, the reconstruction of existing infrastructure and the new spur had a <b>planned</b> <b>value</b> of PLN 115M (€27.2M), of which PLN 68M (€16.1M) was funded through the European Union.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike {{the earned}} value, which {{measures}} {{the value of}} goods and services received {{as a percentage of the}} <b>planned</b> <b>value,</b> the VOWD is not measured against the plan, but against the committed cost. Committed costs can be derived from purchase orders, contracts, approved changes, change orders and other forms of commitments. From an earned value management point of view, the VOWD is comparable to the actual cost achieved rather than the earned value. VOWD represents the full value of the work that has been achieved, at a point in time, against the commercial criteria of the commitments for that work, regardless of payment or receipt.|$|E
5000|$|The {{second step}} is to assign a value, called <b>planned</b> <b>value</b> (PV), to each activity. For large projects, PV is almost always an {{allocation}} of the total project budget, and may be in units of currency (e.g., dollars or euros) or in labor hours, or both. However, in very simple projects, each activity may be assigned a weighted “point value" [...] which {{might not be a}} budget number. Assigning weighted values and achieving consensus on all PV quantities yields an important benefit of EVM, because it exposes misunderstandings and miscommunications about the scope of the project, and resolving these differences should always occur as early as possible. Some terminal elements can not be known (planned) in great detail in advance, and that is expected, because they can be further refined at a later time.|$|E
5000|$|Legislators {{and voters}} were {{dissatisfied}} {{that the larger}} districts in the court's <b>plan</b> <b>valued</b> numerical equality over more local representation. Consequently, the New Hampshire constitution was amended in 2006 to guarantee a representative for each town or ward [...] "within a reasonable deviation from the ideal population for one or more representative seats" [...] and to explicitly authorize floterial districts for fine-tuning.|$|R

40|$|Sustainability is {{the central}} {{development}} issue in the modern economy. Through sustainable development, quality of life can be improved or maintained over time. Since Malaysia is targeting to become a high-income nation by the year 2020, financial investment in public projects should be planned comprehensively {{so that it will}} generate immediate and long-term benefits to the country and the people. Within the currently tight financial environment, achieving value for money in public spending is seen as one of the enablers to maintain the right momentum of economic growth. Previous studies have established the importance of integrating sustainability consideration into <b>Value</b> <b>Planning</b> protocol in order to achieve value for money, underpinned by the sustainable development agenda. Despite the establishment of the framework for the integration, the opportunity of such integration within the Malaysian <b>Value</b> <b>Planning</b> protocol for public projects remains unclear. The present state of sustainability consideration within the <b>Value</b> <b>Planning</b> practice should be first evaluated, so that potential interventions to enhance the integration can be introduced. Responding to the gap, this exploratory study was conducted. The data was collected by means of document analysis, interviews and observations; subsequently analysed using the Template Analysis technique. Based on the current practice of <b>Value</b> <b>Planning</b> in Malaysia, ten interventions are proposed to transform the present practice into Sustainable <b>Value</b> <b>Planning.</b> Sustainable <b>Value</b> <b>Planning</b> is seen as a comprehensive concept in achieving value for money in public spending underpinned by the overarching concept of sustainabilit...|$|R
40|$|On {{the basis}} of a unique data set {{consisting}} of all the amendments to the Italian financial laws from 1988 to 2002, we empirically test whether and how the amending power is an instrument of the parliament or of the government and whether the use of this power was modified by the change of the electoral system in 1994. We show that, in both electoral systems, governments controlled the agenda and parliaments never exploited this power to increase the deficits beyond the <b>planned</b> <b>value.</b> The structural break of the Italian budgetary policy was determined by the Maastricht fiscal rules...|$|E
40|$|AbstractEntrance doses {{measured}} in 50 patients treated by electron beams {{were compared with}} planned values as the percentage difference between the given dose and its <b>planned</b> <b>value.</b> Electron beams of energy 6, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 22 MeV were generated by the Clinac 2300 C/D linear accelerator (Varian). Semiconductor EDE- 5 diodes connected to a DPD- 510 (Scanditronix) electrometer were applied for entrance dose measurements. In our investigations, the mean values of doses administered agreed well with the values of planned doses. The observed relatively large discrepancies in a few patients (up to 12 %) should be carefully investigated...|$|E

In this article, an application of the concept of <b>Planned</b> <b>Value</b> Control (PVC) as a mechanism for improving performance measurement continuously at a major steel producer in Australia, Slab and Plate Product Division (SPPD) of the Broken Hill Proprietary Company Limited (BHP), is examined. An observation is that although the ability of the PVC concept can be enlarged to manage various facets of the business at SPPD, the predominant application has remained limited to costing system with exceptions. At SPPD, the concept is used to improve performance measurement in various business processes including variance analyses, budgeting, production control, management of overtime, absenteeism, maintenance labour, supply operations and key performance indicators (KPI) ...|$|E

40|$|There {{is often}} a large gap between the <b>planned</b> <b>value</b> of {{investment}} in a project (capital expenditure [CAPEX]) and financial implementation of this. This fact creates a mismatch between the net present value (NPV) of the planned project and the outcome achieved. Depending upon the company’s project portfolio, this could even threaten its solvency. Therefore, a quantitative risk analysis {{that takes into account}} different possible scenarios for these investment values is extremely important to statistically measure the real value of a project. The aim {{of this paper is to}} present the reasons for mismatch between planned and final investment values. Although the results are valid for projects in the petrochemical and refining sector, also called downstream in the oil industry, the methodology can be applied upstream, or even to other industry branches...|$|E
40|$|Proceedings Paper (for Acquisition Research Program) The Department of Defense is {{transforming}} its logistics {{and business}} systems to become agile, global-in-reach, and readily adaptable to evolving threats''all with significantly reduced Total Ownership Costs. However, {{the scope and}} complexity of these systems pose significant technical and programmatic challenges, successful management of which requires accurate engineering, planning, and cost estimation data. Because these programs and systems are information intensive, the costs of data acquisition are governed by the efficiency of communication, coordination and control activities. Likewise, they govern the capability of tools such as Earned Value Management (EVM). Unfortunately, {{much of the information}} essential to formulating accurate <b>Planned</b> <b>Value</b> (PV) estimates is not available until after a program is well underway. The key to information/data accuracy lies in the rate and extent to which uncertainty surrounding estimates is eliminated. Acquisition Research Progra...|$|E
40|$|PFI has {{successfully}} transformed {{the management of}} public sector construction projects by minimising construction risks and delivering projects with higher certainty in the price, cost, quality, and client satisfaction than is with the counterpart traditional approach. However, this has not entirely met {{the expectations of the}} procuring authorities or that of the government due to lack of consistency in achieving the desired and <b>planned</b> <b>value</b> for money. The analysis of case studies and official reports reveal that uncertainties in value for money (vfm) progress through all stages of the project life. The fluctuating vfm trend is mainly caused by turbulent market conditions, changing policies, and frequent shifts in the client requirements. Although clients have little control over external factors, a prudent management of the requirements and shorter appraisal and approval periods could potentially reduce the degree of uncertainties and improve long-term vfm...|$|E

The article argues that urban design needs to be retained as an important subset of planning practice, concerned with the physical design of cities, so that the core <b>planning</b> <b>values</b> of serving the public interest in the attainment of social equity, democratic civil society, and an ecologically sustainable future may be maintained in our city-building processes...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} <b>planning</b> {{materiality}} <b>values</b> used by auditors in The Netherlands for {{a sample of}} engagements performed by Big 5 and non-Big 5 firms in 1998 - 99. We find that, consistent with archival evidence from KPMG in Elliott (1983), planning materiality is not a constant percentage of a base, but increases at a decreasing rate with client size. In addition, we find that <b>planning</b> materiality <b>values</b> increase {{with the quality of}} the client's control environment and the magnitude of the client's rate of return on assets, while decreasing with the complexity of the client. We also find that Big 5 firms use lower <b>planning</b> materiality <b>values</b> than non-Big 5 firms, ceteris paribus, which is consistent with the production of relatively higher audit quality levels by the Big 5. Finally, we find that auditors use lower materiality values in situations where earnings might be managed to show a small profit or a small loss...|$|R
