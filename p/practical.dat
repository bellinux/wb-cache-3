5|$|The {{book also}} has a <b>practical</b> dimension, {{presenting}} debates between anthropocentric and non-anthropocentric approaches to environmental ethics as of little <b>practical</b> consequence, and suggesting that animal rights goals can be consistent with holistic environmentalist goals. Jensen argues that Varner's own discussion of the reconciliation of environmentalism and animal advocacy is too narrow, but that, nonetheless, Varner's own biocentric individualism offers potential in this area, even despite the limited engagement in the book with <b>practical</b> animal-related issues.|$|E

40|$|The {{implemented}} robot <b>practicals</b> were {{specifically designed}} to increase student engagement and motivation in electronics <b>practicals</b> while maintaining the same learning outcomes. Design based learning is self-directed where students initiate learning by designing innovative and creative solutions to fulfil both industry and academic requirements. The use of the robot <b>practicals</b> aligns with features of the DBL educational model. DESIGN/METHOD The robot <b>practicals</b> were designed to simultaneously increase student engagement and to improve the learning experience for students studying both Electronics related and non-Electronics related disciplines (such as Mechanical and Civil Engineering). An evaluation study was performed to determine the student perceived effectiveness of the approach in improving student engagement. RESULTS An evaluation survey was undertaken and this paper presents results demonstrating that the robot <b>practicals</b> had {{a positive impact on}} the students&# 039; interest in learning the relevant concepts during the <b>practicals.</b> Lessons learnt from this experience can be applied to future <b>practicals.</b> CONCLUSIONS The implementation of the robot <b>practicals</b> aligns with keys elements of the DBL model such as active learning, hands-on work, and engaging real-world and multidisciplinary tasks. The survey results demonstrate a positive response to the robot <b>practicals</b> which is a particularly valuable outcome considering {{that the majority of the}} cohort and survey respondents were pursuing degrees in unrelated disciplines, i. e.

40|$|Although {{musculoskeletal}} disorders {{are the most}} common reason for general practitioner visits, training did not keep pace. Implementation of learning from patients with rheumatologic disorders linked together with the teaching of theoretical knowledge in the preclinical medical education might be an important step forward in the improvement of quality of care for these patients. The Leiden Medical School curriculum has implemented two non-obligatory real patient learning (RPL) <b>practicals</b> integrated within the preclinical block {{musculoskeletal disorders}}. This study investigates the educational effectiveness of the <b>practicals,</b> the expectations students have of RPL, and students’ satisfaction. Participants’ grades on the end-of-block test served as the test results of the educational effectiveness of the <b>practicals</b> and were compared with those of the non-participants. Qualitative data was collected by means of questionnaires generated by focus groups. The participants in <b>practicals</b> scored significantly higher at the end-of-block test. The expected effects of the contact with real patients concerned positive effects on cognition and skills. ‘Contextualizing of the theory’, ‘better memorizing of clinical pictures’, and ‘understanding {{of the impact of the}} disease’ were the most frequently mentioned effects of the <b>practicals.</b> Overall, the participants were (very) enthusiastic about this educational format. The RPL <b>practicals</b> integrated within a preclinical block musculoskeletal disorders are a valuable addition to the Leiden medical curriculum. This relatively limited intervention exhibits a strong effect on students’ performance in tests. Future research should be directed towards the long-term effects of this intervention...|$|R
40|$|Economic {{actions against}} Cuba since the 90 ´s {{have had a}} {{negative}} impact on laboratory <b>practicals</b> in the Basic Sciences, leading to changes in the curriculum. This paper reviews the feasibility of rescuing and improving such activities related to the Physiology content inserted in the discipline of Morphophysiology. The objective was to identify the Physiology content to be taught in the <b>practicals</b> and define the means and innovations necessary to complete them. The <b>practicals</b> that can be carried out with the available means are presented and characterized. It is concluded that the exercises and topics covered in the <b>practicals</b> coincide with the Physiology content corresponding to Morphophysiology I, III, V and VI and that they can be carried out with the existing resources as well as other innovated by the authors. This way of proceeding saves resources by replacing media or reagents and leads to more effective learning, plus better preparation of teachers to meet the challenges posed by the curriculum D...|$|R
40|$|The two-part Views on Chemistry <b>Practicals</b> (VOCP) {{instrument}} {{for measuring the}} views of grade 10 to 12 Physical Science students about the benefits and problems of Chemistry <b>practicals</b> was empirically developed and trialed using six schools in Gauteng. The summary part of the resultant VOCP instrument comprises 24 Likert items and the explanatory part comprises 24 multiple-choice items with 163 options, thus creating a unique current record {{of a wide range}} of students' views of chemistry <b>practicals</b> and providing teachers with a tool for improving chemistry <b>practicals.</b> The trial of the instrument with 230 students from three schools indicated that the summary part of the instrument is reliable (Cronbach alpha coefficient) and that a shortened explanatory part of the instrument is reliable (Chi squared values for 17 items with 98 options). The validity of the VOCP instrument was established through the empirical development of the instrument using triangulation of data. Educational StudiesM. Ed. (Natural Science Education...|$|R

In spite of these disappointing findings, the authors do not deny the central role of <b>practicals</b> in science education, and they justify these negative results by invoking the great complexity of the subject, the ambiguity that surrounds the term «practicals», and an unsuitable methodology that researchers use to measure their effectiveness. Finally, some plausible solutions to the problem are suggested, such as the characterisation of the educational objectives of <b>practicals,</b> or the use of a qualitative evaluation methodology...|$|R
