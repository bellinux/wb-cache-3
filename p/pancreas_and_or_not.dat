40|$|Background: Neuroendocrine {{neoplasms}} (NENs) {{are rare}} cancers mainly of lung and digestive tract. Little is known on risk factors. The {{aim of this}} work is to define the risk factors for NEN development by extensive review and meta-analysis of published data. Methods: The search was conducted on Medline, Scopus, and Web of Science following the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses. The Newcastle-Ottawa scale was used for study quality. Meta-analyses were conducted by primary site. Odds ratio (OR), hazard ratio, risk ratio, standardized incidence ratio, and associated 95 % confidence intervals (CIs) were abstracted. Data were combined and analyses carried out for risk factors considered by at least two studies. Random-effects model was adopted for study variation. Results: Of 1535 extracted articles, 24 were enrolled. Meta-analyses were possible for <b>pancreas,</b> small intestine, <b>and</b> rectum. Risk for NEN associated with: (i) family history of cancer at all investigated sites (lung, stomach, pancreas, small intestine, appendix, <b>and</b> colon; <b>OR</b> 2. 12 [95 % CI 1. 40 - 3. 22, I 2 = 0. 0 %, P = 0. 681] at meta-analysis in pancreas); (ii) body mass index (BMI) <b>or</b> diabetes (stomach, <b>pancreas,</b> <b>and</b> small intestine; <b>OR</b> of 2. 76 [95 % CI 1. 65 - 4. 64, I 2 = 58. 5 %, P = 0. 090] for diabetes at meta-analysis in pancreas); (iii) cigarette smoking (lung, stomach, <b>pancreas,</b> <b>and</b> small intestine; <b>OR</b> of 1. 34 [95 % CI 1. 10 - 1. 63, I 2 = 0. 0 %, P = 0. 780] and of 1. 59 [95 % CI 1. 07 - 2. 37, I 2 = 32. 9 %, P = 0. 225] for smokers versus never-smokers at meta-analysis for <b>pancreas</b> <b>and</b> small intestine); (iv) alcohol consumption (<b>pancreas</b> <b>and</b> rectum; <b>OR</b> of 2. 44 [95 % CI 1. 07 - 5. 59, I 2 = 65. 8 %, P = 0. 054] and of 1. 53 [95 % CI 0. 99 - 2. 35, I 2 = 0. 0 %, P = 0. 630] for heavy drinkers versus never-drinkers at meta-analysis for <b>pancreas</b> <b>and</b> rectum). Conclusions: Family history of cancer is the most relevant risk factor for NEN development at all investigated sites, followed by BMI and diabetes. Cigarette smoking and alcohol consumption are potential risk factors for selected anatomical sites...|$|R

40|$|An {{understanding}} of the molecular mechanisms governing the survival of organ progenitor cells in vivo is crucial for in vitro tissue regeneration.

Specific knockdown of appl 1 in endoderm or inhibition of akt activity did not affect the formation of endodermal organ primordia at tail bud stages of development, but led to a gut-coiling defect, strong apoptosis in endodermal organs, <b>and</b> <b>pancreas</b> <b>and</b> SD hypoplasia <b>or</b> even aplasia at tadpole stages of development. Furthermore, appl 1 is required for akt phosphorylation and akt 2 in turn can rescue appl 1 knockdown phenotypes.

40|$|As {{clinical}} studies with artificial pancreas systems for automated blood glucose control {{in patients with}} type 1 diabetes move to unsupervised real-life settings, product development will be a focus of companies over the coming years. Directions or requirements regarding safety {{in the design of}} an artificial pancreas are, however, lacking. This review aims to provide an overview and discussion of safety and design requirements of the artificial pancreas. We performed a structured literature search based on three search components-type 1 diabetes, artificial <b>pancreas,</b> <b>and</b> safety <b>or</b> design-and extended the discussion with our own experiences in developing artificial pancreas systems. The main hazards of the artificial <b>pancreas</b> are over- <b>and</b> under-dosing of insulin and, in case of a bi-hormonal system, of glucagon or other hormones. For each component of an artificial <b>pancreas</b> <b>and</b> for the complete system we identified safety issues related to these hazards and proposed control measures. Prerequisites that enable the control algorithms to provide safe closed-loop control are accurate and reliable input of glucose values, assured hormone delivery and an efficient user interface.

30|$|A 70 -year-old female visited our {{hospital}} with a complaint of fever and abdominal pain. Contrast-enhanced computed tomography (CT) revealed dilatation of the main pancreatic duct in the entire <b>pancreas</b> <b>and</b> penetration into the stomach and spleen. Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy revealed mucin extruding from four openings of the fistula in the stomach. No malignancy was detected based on cytology of the mucin. Inflammation markers and tumor markers (CEA, CA 19 – 9) were elevated in the blood. The pre-operative diagnosis was IPMN of main pancreatic duct type penetrating into the stomach and spleen. A total pancreatectomy and splenectomy were performed, combined with distal gastrectomy including resection of the fistulas between the <b>pancreas</b> <b>and</b> stomach. No postoperative complications were noted. Histopathological examination of the resected specimen revealed atrophy of the pancreatic parenchyma, and the main duct of the pancreas was filled with mucin. Mucin-producing malignant tumor cells were detected in the epithelium of the main pancreatic duct with no signs of invasion. No malignancy was found at the fistulas between the <b>pancreas</b> <b>and</b> stomach <b>or</b> spleen. The patient was finally diagnosed with non-invasive intraductal papillary-mucinous carcinoma (IPMC) of main pancreatic duct type. Mechanical penetration was suspected as a mechanism of the penetration. The patient remained disease-free without evidence of recurrence more than 15  months after the operation.|$|R
