40|$|In {{recent years}} area for {{cultivation}} of Melissa officinalis is ranged around 40 ha. Low production could be also caused by less intensive use of machinery. Aerial parts could be fully harvested by mechanisation, but {{in case of}} small growers using of special machinery is not economic. The majority of growers harvest manually and this type of harvest represents up to 80 % of {{the costs associated with}} the cultivation. The less expensive alternative of harvest by a <b>hedge</b> <b>trimmer</b> is evaluated in this article. The goal is to compare two ways of harvest (manual harvest and <b>hedge</b> <b>trimmer</b> harvest) of lemon balm aerial parts in production practise. According to results of experiments were calculated and determined boundaries of effective use of <b>hedge</b> <b>trimmer</b> in production of lemon balm in comparision to manual harvest and fully mechanised harvest. Obtained data shown an increase of harvest performance in case of <b>hedge</b> <b>trimmer</b> (0. 0425 – 0. 0525 ha. hr− 1) compared to manual harvest (0. 0185 – 0. 0216 ha. hr− 1). According to calculations, we can say that effective use of <b>hedge</b> <b>trimmer</b> (including purchase price) is from 0. 37 ha at planting surface and 0. 48 ha at planting rows. Results could also be used for other MAP crops with similar harvest technology as for lemon balm (for example Mentha spp., Origanum spp., Achillea spp.) ...|$|R

50|$|A <b>hedge</b> <b>trimmer,</b> shrub trimmer, or bush trimmer, is a {{gardening}} tool or machine {{used for}} <b>trimming</b> (cutting, pruning) <b>hedges</b> or solitary shrubs (bushes). Different designs {{as well as}} manual and powered versions of hedge trimmers exist.|$|R

5000|$|An {{alternative}} to <b>hedge</b> laying is <b>trimming</b> using a tractor-mounted flail cutter or circular saw, or a <b>hedge</b> <b>trimmer</b> [...] The {{height of the}} cutting can be increased a little every year. <b>Trimming</b> a <b>hedge</b> helps to promote bushy growth. If a flail cutter is used, then the flail must be kept sharp {{to ensure that the}} cutting is effective on the hedge. The disadvantage of this is that the hedge species takes a number of years before it will flower again and subsequently bear fruit for wildlife and people. If the <b>hedge</b> is <b>trimmed</b> repeatedly at the same height, a 'hard knuckle' will start to form at that height - similar to the shape of a pollarded tree.|$|R
