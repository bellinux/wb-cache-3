5|$|Many {{species of}} poison dart frogs are {{dedicated}} parents. Many poison dart frogs in the genera Oophaga and Ranitomeya carry their newly hatched tadpoles into the canopy; the tadpoles {{stick to the}} mucus {{on the backs of}} their parents. Once in {{the upper reaches of the}} rainforest trees, the parents deposit their young in the pools of water that accumulate in epiphytic plants, such as bromeliads. The tadpoles feed on invertebrates in their nursery, and their mother will even supplement their diet by depositing eggs into the water. Other <b>poison</b> <b>frogs</b> lay their eggs on the forest floor, hidden beneath the leaf litter. <b>Poison</b> <b>frogs</b> fertilize their eggs externally; the female lays a cluster of eggs and a male fertilizes them afterward, in the same manner as most fish. <b>Poison</b> <b>frogs</b> can often be observed clutching each other, similar to the manner most frogs copulate. However, these demonstrations are actually territorial wrestling matches. Both males and females frequently engage in disputes over territory. A male will fight for the most prominent roosts from which to broadcast his mating call; females fight over desirable nests, and even invade the nests of other females to devour competitor's eggs.|$|E
5|$|Sexual {{selection}} {{may have}} played a role in the diversification of skin color and pattern in <b>poison</b> <b>frogs.</b> With female preferences in play, male coloration could evolve rapidly. Sexual selection is influenced by many things. The parental investment may shed some light on the evolution of coloration in relation to female choice. In Oophaga pumilio, the female provides care for the offspring for several weeks whereas the males provides care for a few days, implying a strong female preference. Sexual selection increases phenotypic variation drastically. In populations of O. pumilio that participated in sexual selection, the phenotypic polymorphism was evident. The lack of sexual dimorphism in some dendrobatid populations however suggests that sexual selection is not a valid explanation.|$|E
5|$|Some frogs, such as {{the poison}} dart frogs, are {{especially}} toxic. The native peoples of South America extract poison from these frogs to apply to their weapons for hunting, although few species are toxic enough {{to be used for}} this purpose. At least two non-poisonous frog species in tropical America (Eleutherodactylus gaigei and Lithodytes lineatus) mimic the colouration of dart <b>poison</b> <b>frogs</b> for self-protection. Some frogs obtain poisons from the ants and other arthropods they eat. Others, {{such as the}} Australian corroboree frogs (Pseudophryne corroboree and Pseudophryne pengilleyi), can synthesize the alkaloids themselves. The chemicals involved may be irritants, hallucinogens, convulsants, nerve poisons or vasoconstrictors. Many predators of frogs have become adapted to tolerate high levels of these poisons, but other creatures, including humans who handle the frogs, may be severely affected.|$|E

25|$|Oribatid mites {{and to a}} much {{lesser extent}} others {{are a source of}} {{alkaloids}} in <b>poison</b> <b>frogs</b> (namely small species like the strawberry poison-dart frog Oophaga pumilio). Such frogs raised without these orbatids in their diets do not develop the strong poisons associated with them in the wild.|$|E
500|$|Many poison dart frogs secrete {{lipophilic}} alkaloid toxins such as allopumiliotoxin 267A, batrachotoxin, epibatidine, histrionicotoxin, and pumiliotoxin 251D {{through their}} skin. Alkaloids {{in the skin}} glands of <b>poison</b> <b>frogs</b> serve as a chemical defense against predation, and they are therefore able to be active alongside potential predators during the day. About 28 structural classes of alkaloids are known in <b>poison</b> <b>frogs.</b> [...] The most toxic of poison dart frog species is Phyllobates terribilis. It is argued that dart frogs do not synthesize their poisons, but sequester the chemicals from arthropod prey items, such as ants, centipedes and mites – the diet-toxicity hypothesis. Because of this, captive-bred animals do not possess significant levels of toxins as they are reared on diets that do not contain the alkaloids sequestered by wild populations. In fact, new {{studies suggest that the}} maternal frogs of some species lay unfertilized eggs, which are laced with trace amounts of alkaloids, to feed the tadpoles. This behavior shows that the poisons are introduced from a very young age. Nonetheless, the captive-bred frogs retain the ability to accumulate alkaloids when they are once again provided an alkaloid-containing diet. Despite the toxins used by some poison dart frogs, some predators have developed the ability to withstand them. One is the snake Leimadophis epinephelus, which has developed immunity to the poison.|$|E

50|$|The green-and-black <b>poison</b> dart <b>frog,</b> {{while not}} the most toxic <b>poison</b> dart <b>frog,</b> is still a highly toxic animal. The very small amount of <b>poison</b> the <b>frog</b> {{possesses}} {{is enough to make}} a human heart stop beating. However, like most <b>poison</b> dart <b>frogs,</b> the green-and-black <b>poison</b> dart <b>frog</b> only releases its poison if it feels threatened, and wild specimens can be handled provided the human holding it is calm and relaxed. The green-and-black <b>poison</b> dart <b>frog,</b> as with all <b>poison</b> dart <b>frogs,</b> loses its toxicity in captivity due to a change in diet. This has led some scientists to believe that the green-and-black <b>poison</b> <b>frog</b> actually takes its poison from the mites and other insects on which it feeds.|$|R

50|$|Since easily {{purchased}} {{foods are}} not {{rich in the}} alkaloids required to produce batrachotoxins, captive frogs do not produce toxins and they eventually lose their toxicity in captivity. In fact, many hobbyists and herpetologists have reported that most dart frogs will not consume ants at all in captivity, though ants constitute the larger portion of their diets in the wild, likely due to the unavailability of the natural prey species of ants to captive frog keepers. Though all <b>poison</b> <b>frogs</b> lose their toxicity when deprived of certain foods, and captive-bred golden <b>poison</b> <b>frogs</b> are born harmless, a wild-caught poison frog can retain alkaloids for years. It is not clear which prey species supplies the potent alkaloid that gives golden <b>poison</b> <b>frogs</b> their exceptionally high levels of toxicity, or whether the frogs modify another available toxin to produce a more efficient variant, as {{do some of the}} frogs from the genus Dendrobates.|$|E

5000|$|Histrionicotoxins are a {{group of}} related toxins found in the skin of <b>poison</b> <b>frogs</b> from the family Dendrobatidae, notably Oophaga histrionica (formerly Dendrobates histrionicus), which are native to Colombia. It is likely that, as with other poison frog alkaloids, histrionicotoxins are not {{manufactured}} by the amphibians, but absorbed from insects in their diet and stored in glands in their skin. [...] They are notably less toxic than other alkaloids found in <b>poison</b> <b>frogs,</b> yet their distinct structure acts as a neurotoxin by non-competitive inhibition of nicotinic acetylcholine receptors.|$|E
50|$|Epipedobates is a genus {{of poison}} dart frogs native to {{northern}} South America (Colombia and Ecuador) {{west of the}} Andes, including the western slopes. Common name phantasmal <b>poison</b> <b>frogs</b> has been suggested for the genus.|$|E
5000|$|Golden <b>poison</b> <b>frogs</b> {{are social}} animals.
