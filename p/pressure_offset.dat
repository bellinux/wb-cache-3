40|$|An {{innovative}} computationally efficient {{method for}} the simultaneous determination of {{top dead centre}} (TDC) offset and <b>pressure</b> <b>offset</b> is presented. It is based on characteristic deviations of {{the rate of heat}} release (ROHR) that are specific for both offsets in compression phase and expansion phase after the end of combustion. These characteristic deviations of the ROHR are derived from first principles and they were also confirmed through manual shifts of the pressure trace. The ROHR is calculated based on the first law of thermodynamics using an in-cylinder pressure trace, engine geometrical parameters and operating point specific parameters. The method can be applied in off-line analyses using an averaged pressure trace or in on-line analyses using a single pressure trace. In both application areas the method simultaneously determines the TDC position and the <b>pressure</b> <b>offset</b> within a single processing of the pressure trace, whereas a second refinement step can be performed for obtaining more accurate results as correction factors are determined more accurately using nearly converged input data. Innovative analytic basis of the method allows for significant reduction of the computational times compared to the existing methods for the simultaneous determination of TDC offset and <b>pressure</b> <b>offset</b> in fired conditions. The method was validated on a heavy-duty and a light-duty diesel engine...|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{proposes a}} novel {{technique}} to perform propellant-free chaser-target spacecraft relative maneuvers while simultaneously stabilizing the chaser's attitude {{with respect to}} the local vertical local horizontal coordinate system centered at its body center of mass. The control forces required for relative maneuvers at low Earth orbits can be generated by varying the relative aerodynamic drag via maneuverable sails placed in the back-end of the spacecraft. At the same time, aerodynamic torques resulting from the displacement of the centers of pressure of the sails can stabilize the orientation of the spacecraft. In this work, the target vehicle is assumed to maneuver an identical sail in a cooperative fashion and will be centered and attitude-stabilized in its local vertical local horizontal coordinate system. The proposed approach is based on the idea of virtual thrusters, emulating the sail's center of <b>pressure</b> <b>offset</b> in the controller.

The sleeve sensor is a perfused channel which records the highest pressure point along its length. The aim {{of the study was}} to develop and evaluate a prototype sleeve sensor for SO manometry. MATERIALS AND METHODS: Bench-testing was used to assess the dynamic performance of the sleeve and sidehole assemblies. Recordings were initially made with a standard triple-lumen catheter and then with a purpose-built manometric assembly which had a 15 mm long sleeve sensor. RESULTS: A perfusion rate of 0. 04 ml/min gave the best balance between baseline <b>pressure</b> <b>offset</b> and rise rate. Recordings were attempted in nine patients and successfully achieved in four. The sleeve and sidehole recordings of the maximal basal pressure did not differ significantly (mean +/- SEM, 86. 1 +/- 26. 5 mmHg vs. 90. 1 +/- 21. 0 mmHg, P = 0. 57, r = 0. 998).

We examined the relations of age to these variables and to peripheral resistance and vascular stiffness in 272 asymptomatic, unmedicated adults (25 to 80 years old) who had uncomplicated essential hypertension. Cardiac and carotid ultrasound and carotid pressure waveforms were obtained to measure left ventricular dimensions, endocardial and midwall left ventricular shortening, stroke index and cardiac index, end-systolic stress, and pulse pressure/stroke index and b, pressure-dependent and independent measures of vascular stiffness, respectively. Endocardial and midwall stress-corrected left ventricular shortening assessed ventricular performance. Cardiac index and TPRI did not change with age in either gender, with age-related increases in systolic <b>pressure</b> <b>offset</b> by increasingly concentric ventricular geometry in women and enhanced ventricular systolic function in men. In contrast {{to the lack of}} age-related change in traditional hemodynamic indexes, pulse pressure/stroke volume and b strongly increased with age (P, 0. 001). Thus, in uncomplicated, relatively mild essential hypertension, neither cardiac index nor peripheral resistance is associated with age. This hemodynamic stability is associated with age-related increased concentricity of ventricular geometry in women and increased ventricular performance indexes in hypertensive men. Vascular stiffness progressively increases with age, independent of change in mean pressure or resistance, possibly contributing to increased rates of cardiovascular events in older individuals.

The {{objective of this}} project was to design a model from first principals that could function as a design tool for a microchannel based membrane separation unit. The device was composed of two parallel arrays of microchannels separated by a 20 µm membrane.

Ten subjects were studied while awake. The spontaneous mode was used at three levels of inspiratory positive airway pressure (IPAP) : 10, 15, and 20 cm H 2 O. The expiratory pressure was kept at 4 cm H 2 O. Records of spontaneous breathing without nIPPV were also performed. The glottis was continuously monitored through a fiberoptic bronchoscope. We measured, breath by breath, the widest inspiratory angle formed by the vocal cords at the anterior commissure, the corresponding tidal volume (with respiratory inductive plethysmography), the respiratory frequency and other indices. Our data during wakefulness show that inspiratory pressures of 10 and 15 cm H 2 O did not result in increases in effective minute ventilation with respect to spontaneous breathing. Only at 20 cm H 2 O of IPAP did effective minute ventilation increase. This was due essentially to a decrease in respiratory frequency with increasing <b>pressures,</b> <b>offsetting</b> increases in tidal volume at 10 and 15, but not at 20 cm H 2 O of inspiratory pressure. Changes in end-tidal CO 2 suggest that alveolar ventilation increased due to the change in breathing pattern.

Developments in silicone rubber extrusion technology {{made it possible to}} build a perfused manometric system, using a perfused manometric assembly requiring a low volume of perfusate. In the present study the feasibility of recording and automated analysis of small intestinal motility using a perfused multiple lumen manometric system was evaluated in seven healthy volunteers. Pressures were recorded from 12 sideholes arranged in four clusters spaced at 10 -cm intervals from the catheter tip. Each channel was perfused at 0. 15 mL min- 1 with degassed water by a portable, low-compliance, perfusion pump. The 12 sidehole recording channels were connected to external transducers mounted on a belt. Pressure data were stored in two dataloggers. Motility was recorded in the sitting (30 min), and supine (30 min) position, during walking (30 min) and postprandially (90 min). Using purpose-built software baseline variations were corrected for and manometric variables (number of pressure waves, mean amplitude and motility index) calculated. Bench testing of the manometric assembly showed a median baseline <b>pressure</b> <b>offset</b> of 4. 2 kPa (range 3. 7 - 10. 1) and upon occlusion a rise rate of 27. 8 kPa sec- 1 (range 19. 7 - 30. 8).

Left ventricular contractility was estimated from maximal rate of left ventricular pressure rise (max dP/dt), peak measured velocity of contractile element shortening (Vpm) and mean circumferential fiber shortening velocity. Left ventricular relaxation was assessed in 12 patients {{from the time}} constant (T) {{of the decline in}} left ventricular pressure; this constant was calculated from a nonlinear regression analysis of pressure and time (method 1) and a linear regression analysis of pressure and negative dP/dt (method 2). Left ventricular diastolic function was evaluated in nine patients from simultaneous diastolic pressure-volume relations during the strong and weak beats. During pulsus alternans, heart rate and left ventricular end-diastolic pressure remained unchanged, whereas peak systolic pressure (220 versus 204 mm Hg, p < 0. 01) and end-systolic pressure (101 versus 95 mm Hg, p < 0. 01) were significantly higher during the strong beat than during the weak beat. Max dP/dt was alternating 2, 162 versus 1, 964 mm Hg, p < 0. 05), whereas the peak velocity of contractile element shortening remained unchanged (1. 21 versus 1. 18 ML/s). Systolic shortening of the left ventricular minor axis was significantly (p < 0. 02) greater during the strong (24 %) than during the weak (19 %) beat, but that of the left ventricular major axis remained essentially unchanged (8 versus 7 %). The time constant (T) demonstrated only slight alternation during the strong beat (method 1 : 54 ms, method 2 : 58 ms) and during the weak beat (method 1 : 57 ms, method 2 : 67 ms, p = NS). Diastolic pressure-volume relations showed no changes during pulsus alternans. Left ventricular end-diastolic volume was 148 ml/m 2 during the strong and 146 ml/m 2 during the weak beat; systolic ejection fraction was significantly higher during the strong than during the weak beat (48 versus 43 %, p < 0. 02). It is concluded that pulsus alternans is a systolic phenomenon with alternation in left ventricular contractility, but nonsignificant changes in left ventricular relaxation and diastolic function. Although contractility was enhanced, the time constant (T) of the decline in left ventricular pressure did not change significantly during the strong beat, because the increase in peak systolic <b>pressure</b> <b>offset</b> almost completely the decrease in T associated with the increase in contractile state. The alternation of systolic shortening is the result of changes in contractility and not of a Frank-Starling mechanism since preload remained unchanged...|$|E

We hypothesized that such discrepancies could result in apparent increased relaxation sensitivity to load and drug stimulation. BACKGROUNDDeviation of relaxation behavior from model-assumed waveforms may be worsened by failure, enhancing instability and apparent load and drug sensitivity of commonly used indexes. METHODSPressure-volume relations were measured in patients with normal (n = 14), hypertrophic (hypertrophic cardiomyopathy [HCM], n = 15) and dilated-myopathic (dilated cardiomyopathy [DCM], n = 37) hearts before and during preload reduction or inotropic stimulation. Relaxation parameters (monoexponential [ME] model assuming zero-Tlnor non-zero-TD, TFasymptote:, hybrid logistic-TL, linear-TLR, and pressure halftime-T 1 / 2) were contrasted regarding sensitivity to slight data range manipulation and loading or drug changes. RESULTSIn DCM, TDand TFprolonged 15 % to 25 % (p < 0. 0001) by deletion of only 1 – 2 data points, whereas this had minimal effect on controls or HCM. This stemmed from systematic deviation of relaxation from an ME decay in DCM. T 1 / 2 and Tlnwere highly sensitive to pure <b>pressure</b> <b>offsets,</b> whereas TLwas most stable to both manipulations in all hearts. As a result, TDand TFappeared {{to be much more}} sensitive to systolic load in DCM than T 1 / 2 or TLand disproportionately sensitive to increased cyclic adenosine monophosphate (cAMP). CONCLUSIONSRelaxation consistently deviates from an ME decay in DCM resulting in instability and amplified relaxation systolic load or drug dependence of ME-based indexes in failing versus control (or HCM) hearts. The hybrid-logistic method improves quantitative analyses by providing more consistent data fits with all three heart types...|$|R
40|$|Vane pumps exhibit {{pressure}} ripple in {{the pressure}} evolution trend during a complete shaft rotation. Pressure ripple can determine oscillating forces {{within the system}} leading to vibration and noise generation. In this context, this paper {{is focused on the}} experimental measurement of the pressure evolution in vane pumps by using two different methodologies. Results of measurements are shown, highlighting advantages and disadvantages of both methodologies. In the first method a pressure transducer is directly facing the volume between two vanes, in the second method the sensor is located inside an external chamber where the oil is transferred via a ducts suitably designed in the rotor shaft. Briefly, the first method gives better results in terms of pressure evolution but involves some practical problems in the set up: the measurements exhibit <b>pressure</b> <b>offsets</b> strongly dependent on the tightening torque used for sensor mounting and negative pressure values in the low pressure region. The second method is simpler to set up but the results are influenced by the dynamical behavior of the measurement duct carrying oil. In order to avoid resonances of this duct, a vibro-acoustical finite element (FE) model of the oil cavity has been developed. The numerical frequency response functions obtained by the FE model have been used in order to optimize the geometry of the measurement duct, reducing the effects of the resonances of the oil ducts. It is shown that, using this improved methodology, the dynamical components of the measured pressure are not significantly influenced by the frequency response of the measurement duct when the outlet pressures is higher than 50 bar, while for lower outlet pressure the first resonance of the measurement duct is close to the main vane harmonics...|$|R
40|$|Several {{previous}} studies highlight pressure (or equivalently, pressure altitude) discrepancies between the radiosonde pressure sensor and that {{derived from a}} GPS flown with the radiosonde. The offsets vary during the ascent both in absolute and percent pressure differences. To investigate this problem further, a total of 731 radiosonde/ozonesonde launches from the Southern Hemisphere subtropics to northern mid-latitudes are considered, with launches between 2005 and 2013 from both longer term and campaign-based intensive stations. Five series of radiosondes from two manufacturers (International Met Systems: iMet, iMet-P, iMet-S, and Vaisala: RS 80 - 15 N and RS 92 -SGP) are analyzed to determine {{the magnitude of the}} <b>pressure</b> <b>offset.</b> Additionally, electrochemical concentration cell (ECC) ozonesondes from three manufacturers (Science Pump Corporation; SPC and ENSCI/Droplet Measurement Technologies; DMT) are analyzed to quantify the effects these offsets have on the calculation of ECC ozone (O 3) mixing ratio profiles (O 3 MR) from the ozonesonde-measured partial pressure. Approximately half of all offsets are > ± 0. 6 hPa in the free troposphere, with nearly a third > ± 1. 0 hPa at 26 km, where the 1. 0 hPa error represents ~ 5 % of the total atmospheric pressure. Pressure offsets have negligible effects on O 3 MR below 20 km (96 % of launches lie within ± 5 % O 3 MR error at 20 km). Ozone mixing ratio errors above 10 hPa (~ 30 km), can approach greater than ± 10 % (> 25 % of launches that reach 30 km exceed this threshold). These errors cause disagreement between the integrated ozonesonde-only column O 3 from the GPS and radiosonde pressure profile by an average of + 6. 5 DU. Comparisons of total column O 3 between the GPS and radiosonde pressure profiles yield average differences of + 1. 1 DU when the O 3 is integrated to burst with addition of the McPeters and Labow (2012) above-burst O 3 column climatology. Total column differences are reduced to an average of − 0. 5 DU when the O 3 profile is integrated to 10 hPa with subsequent addition of the O 3 climatology above 10 hPa. The RS 92 radiosondes are superior in performance compared to other radiosondes, with average 26 km errors of − 0. 12 hPa or + 0. 61 % O 3 MR error. iMet-P radiosondes had average 26 km errors of − 1. 95 hPa or + 8. 75 % O 3 MR error. Based on our analysis, we suggest that ozonesondes always be coupled with a GPS-enabled radiosonde and that pressure-dependent variables, such as O 3 MR, be recalculated/reprocessed using the GPS-measured altitude, especially when 26 km pressure offsets exceed ± 1. 0 hPa/± 5 %...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe relief around {{subduction}} zones {{results from}} the interplay of dynamic processes that may locally exceed the (iso) static contributions. The viscous dissipation of the energy in and around subduction zones is capable of generating kilometer scale vertical ground movements. In order to evaluate dynamic topography in a selfconsistent subduction system, we carried out a set of laboratory experiments, wherein the lithosphere and mantle are simulated by means of Newtonian viscous materials, namely silicone putty and glucose syrup. Models are kept in their most simple form and are made of negative buoyancy plates, of variable width and thickness, freely plunging into the syrup. The surface of the model {{and the top of}} the slab are scanned in three dimensions. A forebulge systematically emerges from the bending of the viscous plate, adjacent to the trench. With a large wavelength, dynamic <b>pressure</b> <b>offsets</b> the foreside and backside of the slab by ~ 500 m on average. The suction, that accompanies the vertical descent of the slab depresses the surface on both sides. At a distance equal to the half-width of the slab, the topographic depression amounts to ~ 500 m on average and becomes negligible at a distance that equals the width of the slab. In order to explore the impact of slab rollback on the topography, the trailing edge of the plates is alternatively fixed to (fixed mode) and freed from (free mode) the end wall of the tank. Both the pressure and suction components of the topography are ~ 30 % lower in the free mode, indicating that slab rollback fosters the dynamic subsidence of upper plates. Our models are compatible with first order observations of the topography around the East Scotia, Tonga, Kermadec and Banda subduction zones, which exhibit anomalous depths of nearly 1 km as compared to adjacent sea floor of comparable age...|$|R

One opportunity for cost reduction lies in asset management. This paper presents resource allocation scheduling models {{that can be}} used to assign truck loads to delivery times and trucks when delivery times are flexible. The paper makes two main contributions. First, we formulate the problem as a multi-objective optimization model - minimizing the number of trucks needed as well as the costs associated with tardiness or earliness - and demonstrate how improvements in fleet usage translate into savings which carriers can use as incentives to promote flexible delivery times for customers. Second, we show that a two-phase model with a polynomial algorithm in the second phase is able to produce optimal schedules in a reasonable time. close 3...|$|R
30|$|Vasopressors’ {{ultimate}} {{impact on}} tissue perfusion is unclear, as any benefits of higher arterial <b>pressure</b> may be <b>offset</b> by increased microvascular resistance. Microcirculatory derangements and vasoplegia commonly persist despite adequate fluid resuscitation {{in the setting}} of haemorrhagic shock [11]. Organ failure can then result, partly through the release of nitric oxide and peroxynitrites [12, 13]; interestingly, a large number of preclinical haemorrhagic shock models have studied the role of xanthine oxidase activation as a culprit [14, 15].|$|R
