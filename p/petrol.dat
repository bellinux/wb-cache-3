5|$|<b>Petrol</b> cans {{were stacked}} {{along the sides}} of {{existing}} revetted trenches near El Alamein railway station. It was found by experiment that when they were hidden in the shadows in that way, they were invisible from the air and so 2000 tons of <b>petrol</b> were thus stored. Over 100,000 four-gallon <b>petrol</b> tins were stacked in the 100 stone-faced slit trenches.|$|E
5|$|Some local <b>petrol</b> {{stations}} reported {{long queues}} as people started panic buying. A {{spokesman for the}} Department of Trade and Industry gave assurances that no <b>petrol</b> shortage was likely to result from the incident.|$|E
5|$|Across Europe, {{car engines}} are spontaneously exploding; {{a result of}} someone {{tampering}} with the <b>petrol</b> at its source. With Europe {{on the brink of}} war, Captain Haddock is mobilised into the navy while Tintin and detectives Thomson and Thompson set off for the Middle Eastern kingdom of Khemed on board a <b>petrol</b> tanker.|$|E
5|$|All entries {{had to run}} Shell fuel {{in either}} diesel or <b>petrol</b> form.|$|E
5|$|In September 2007, the 2008 NZETS was {{expected}} to increase the GST-inclusive retail price of <b>petrol</b> by 3.7 cents a litre (2.5%) under a $15 carbon price scenario and 6.1 cents (4%) under a $25 scenario. The Labour Government predicted that the NZETS may cause <b>petrol</b> prices to rise by about 4 cents a litre.|$|E
5|$|LMP1s with {{diesel engines}} had their fuel tank {{capacity}} decreased from 90litres to 81litres. LMP1s with <b>petrol</b> engines kept their 90-litre tanks.|$|E
5|$|The Southcote Service Station is an Esso <b>petrol</b> {{filling station}} and Tesco Express {{convenience}} store, adjacent to {{which is a}} Nissan dealership.|$|E
5|$|Tiger {{are also}} mascots for various sports teams around the world. Tony the Tiger is a famous mascot for Kellogg's breakfast cereal Frosted Flakes. The Esso (Exxon) brand of <b>petrol</b> was advertised from 1969 onwards with the slogan 'put a tiger in your tank', and a tiger mascot; more than 2.5 million {{synthetic}} tiger tails {{were sold to}} motorists, who tied them to their <b>petrol</b> tank caps.|$|E
5|$|A unique form of {{circulating}} specie is {{the fuel}} ration coupon, {{which has been}} issued in 2005, 2006, 2007 and 2008. Known denominations include 1, 5, 10, 20, 25, & 50 litres of <b>petrol</b> (gasoline), kerosene and/or diesel, and translate roughly into the local <b>petrol</b> price (about 1 UK pound sterling per litre or US$1.50 in late 2008). Businesses, including Western Union, have been reported paying employees with these coupons, and even auctions have been transacted in this currency. As with much Zimbabwe currency, printing standards are crude and counterfeiting is rampant; the RBZ has been dissuading this widespread use.|$|E
5|$|Between 1 July 2010 and February 2015, the {{estimated}} NZETS {{component of the}} retail <b>petrol</b> price has ranged from a maximum of 2.4 cents per litre from late 2010 to June 2011 to a minimum of half a cent from July 2013 to December 2014.|$|E

5|$|In Thailand, {{the hybrid}} Camry has been {{available}} since 2009. Its unique and differs it from other Camry hybrids because the <b>petrol</b> version of the Thai Camry is built using the Aurion fascia, the hybrid version also makes use of the same body.|$|E
5|$|One of the town's {{buildings}} {{was used}} as a house and a shop from 1859; a Shell <b>petrol</b> bowser was installed in the late 1920s outside the shop.|$|E
5|$|The HOSL is a {{major hub}} on the UK's oil {{pipeline}} network (UKOP) with pipelines to Humberside and Stanlow Refinery and is an important fuel source to the British aviation industry, providing aircraft fuel for local airports including Gatwick, Heathrow and Luton airports. About half of the complex {{is dedicated to the}} storage of aviation fuel. The remainder of the complex stores oil, kerosene, <b>petrol</b> and diesel fuel for <b>petrol</b> stations across much of the South-East of England. The terminal is owned by TOTAL UK Limited (60%) and Texaco 40%.|$|E
5|$|The {{investigation}} {{found that the}} level gauge had stuck at random times after a tank service in August 2005, {{but it did not}} concern maintenance contractors or site management. The independent shut-off switch was not fitted with a critical padlock to allow its check lever to work. Secondary containment (meant to trap the <b>petrol</b> in a retaining wall around the tank) failed and allowed <b>petrol</b> to flow out. Tertiary containment (drains and catchment areas to prevent release of spilled chemicals to the environment) also failed, and fuel and firefighting foam entered groundwater supplies. The {{investigation found}} secondary and tertiary containment to be inadequately designed and poorly maintained.|$|E
5|$|The march ended early {{after the}} DA {{was confronted by}} ANC {{supporters}} 40 minutes into the march. Stones and <b>petrol</b> bombs were thrown by ANC supporters at police trying to calm the situation.|$|E

As of September 2010, {{there are five}} such rest area operators on the A1 motorway: INA, OMV, Tifon, <b>Petrol</b> and Crobenz. The rest area operators {{are not permitted to}} sub-lease the fuel operations; Tifon and <b>Petrol</b> operated rest areas have restaurants or hotels operated by Marché, a Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts subsidiary. All of the A1 motorway rest areas, except Stupnik and Jezerane, are accessible to both directions of the motorway traffic. The rest areas normally operate 24hours a day, 7days a week.|$|E
5|$|These {{factors are}} usually also {{considered}} {{to contribute to}} high quality Riesling wines, so the <b>petrol</b> note is in fact {{more likely to develop}} in top wines than in simpler wines made from high-yielding vineyards, especially those from the New World, where irrigation is common.|$|E
5|$|While {{the real}} {{supplies}} {{in the north}} were carefully hidden, matching dummy supplies had to be created in the south. In the area named Brian after camouflage officer Brian Robb, over 700 dummy stacks, representing food, <b>petrol,</b> ammunition and other supplies, were constructed.|$|E
5|$|A {{district}} {{post office}} {{was established in}} 1871 at the railway siding's station house. By 1908 the post office was run from the chapel house in {{the main part of}} the town, and a shop ran from the same building.

5|$|Although Smith {{maintained}} his innocence, detectives quickly gathered evidence linking him to Corcoran's death {{and those of}} the other two women. Witnesses had seen him leaving the Rainbow with both Corcoran and Hyde, and he was the last person to see them both alive. CCTV footage from around Birmingham showed his distinctive car visiting key locations linked to the investigation, and even captured Hyde getting out at one point to visit a chemist. Smith was seen buying <b>petrol</b> from a filling station and driving near the area where Hyde's body was later discovered. Corcoran was seen on camera struggling with Smith outside Monte Carlo's. CCTV footage showed him driving around Bromsgrove, a town close to Droitwich, after killing Corcoran, and later film showed him returning to Birmingham. At least two witnesses recalled seeing Smith with blood on him: a motorist who saw him buying <b>petrol,</b> and another who spoke with Smith about his appearance. Smith told the latter that he had been in a fight, although he had no visible signs of injury.|$|E
5|$|Although he had {{considered}} {{a career as}} a mining engineer, Pattle sent in an application to join the South African Air Force in 1932 and was employed in menial jobs while waiting for a response. For several months, he worked at a <b>petrol</b> station owned by an uncle.|$|E
5|$|At a <b>petrol</b> station, Angel is {{inspired}} by the movies he watched with Danny, and returns to Sandford. He arms himself with the confiscated guns and reunites with Danny. The pair engage in shootouts with the NWA, then besiege the supermarket {{with the rest of}} the police, forcing Skinner to flee with Inspector Butterman. After a car chase that ends in a model village of Sandford itself, Skinner and Frank are arrested.|$|E

5|$|In 2014, Iran {{started the}} second phase of its {{targeted}} subsidy plan under President Hassan Rohani. <b>Petrol</b> prices were raised by 75% from 4,000 to 7,000 rials ($0.16 to $0.28) per litre, which is far from the target price of approx. $0.90 per litre. As a consequence, fuel smuggling and gasoline imports increased again.|$|E
5|$|In Cairo, a {{standoff}} {{took place in}} front of the Egyptian Museum {{in the early morning hours}} with rocks and <b>petrol</b> bombs reportedly flying.

Anti-government protesters banged on metal railings while rocks were thrown at them.|$|E
5|$|Rumours spread {{throughout}} London that more rioting was imminent, including in Bermondsey and the Wood Green shopping centre near Broadwater Farm. On 1 October, there were disturbances in Toxteth, Liverpool, {{and on the}} same day police stopped and searched all vehicles entering the Farm, finding a <b>petrol</b> bomb there the next day, David Rose wrote in 1992.|$|E
5|$|The Irish and British {{authorities}} co-operated in the chartering of ships. They made combined {{purchases of}} wheat, maize, sugar, animal feeds and <b>petrol.</b> At {{the start of}} the war, Irish ships joined convoys protected by the Royal Navy. The advantages were protection and cheaper insurance. These advantages were not borne out by experience. So they chose to sail alone.|$|E
5|$|The first Commando raid in Norway, Operation Claymore, was {{conducted}} in March 1941 by men of No.s 3 and 4 Commandos. This was the first large scale raid from the United Kingdom during the war. Their objective was the undefended Norwegian Lofoten Islands.

5|$|VAT {{could offer}} only <b>petrol</b> engines until 1953. The most common ones were the Hercules engines made {{domestically}} under licence by SAT and Tampella. The SAT-made engine {{was called the}} Sisu AMG or SA5, and the engine made by Tampella was the Tampella 6000. The second most common engine was the Cadillac V8 1G and the third was the White 160 AX, which Kytölä had bought from Central Europe.
