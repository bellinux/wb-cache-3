25|$|Most keys have needle springs made of <b>phosphor</b> <b>bronze,</b> {{stainless}} steel, beryllium copper, or a gold alloy. The B thumb keys {{typically have}} flat springs. <b>Phosphor</b> <b>bronze</b> {{is by far}} the most common material for needle springs because it is relatively inexpensive, makes a good spring, and is resistant to corrosion. Unfortunately, it is prone to metal fatigue. Stainless steel also makes a good spring and is resistant to corrosion. Gold springs are found mostly in high-end flutes because of gold's cost.|$|E

40|$|This thesis work {{concerns}} {{about the importance of}} the cast surfaces, surface phenomenon such as the formation of the oscillation marks and exudation and related defects including cracks and segregation that happened during the continuous casting. All of the investigated materials were collected during the plant trials while an in-depth analysis on these materials was performed at the laboratory scale with certain explanations supported by the schematic and theoretical models. The work consists on different material classes such as steels and <b>phosphor</b> <b>bronzes</b> with a focus on the surface defects and their improvements. In order to facilitate the theoretical analysis which could be capable of explaining the suggested phenomenon in the thesis, a reduced model is developed which required lesser computational resources with lesser convergence problems.

40|$|This is {{an example}} of a {{hypoeutectic}} alloy. On slow cooling the liquid first solidified at approximately 940 °C as copper rich dendrites. The composition of the remaining liquid became increasingly rich in phosphorus until it solidified as a eutectic (8. 38 wt% P) at the eutectic temperature of 714 °C. Note that the dendrites are cored - the different contrast after etching indicated that the composition varies with position in the dendrites. This is caused by non-equilibrium solidification. The cooling rate was too rapid for equilibrium to be maintained between the solid and the liquid phases. This alloy has no practical applications. <b>Phosphor</b> <b>bronzes</b> usually contain 5 wt% Sn for solid solution strengthening with 0. 2 wt% P for interstitial solution strengthening. They have high strength and corrosion resistance and are usually used for springs. ...|$|R
25|$|Phosphorus {{is also an}} {{important}} component in steel production, in the making of <b>phosphor</b> <b>bronze,</b> and in many other related products. Phosphorus is added to metallic copper during its smelting process to react with oxygen present as an impurity in copper and to produce phosphorus-containing copper (CuOFP) alloys with a higher hydrogen embrittlement resistance than normal copper.|$|E
25|$|The Umnumzaan blade pivot is {{implemented}} with a pivot screw and pin, and {{is supported by}} perforated <b>phosphor</b> <b>bronze</b> thrust washers. The functions of the perforations are to reduce friction due {{to a reduction in}} surface area relative to that of a solid washer, and to increase the duration of use between cleanings by housing lubricant in the perforations. Over the life of the Umnumzaan, the pivot and washers have been incrementally modified.|$|E

2500|$|Other {{materials}} {{have been tried}} {{with varying degrees of}} success, such as the 1950s Grafton plastic alto saxophone and its recent successor, the polycarbonate saxophone, Vibratosax. There is also the wooden Sawat saxophone created in Thailand on a small scale. Recent years have seen the use of higher copper alloys substituted for the [...] "yellow brass" [...] or [...] "cartridge brass" [...] that are most common, for visual and tonal effect. [...] Yanagisawa's 902 and 992 series saxophones are made with <b>phosphor</b> <b>bronze,</b> which is claimed to offer slightly different, more [...] "vintage" [...] tonal qualities from the brass 901 and 991 models of identical design. [...] Other saxophones made of high copper alloys are sold under the brands Chateau, Kessler, Saxgourmet, and Bauhaus Walstein. [...] Yanagisawa and other manufacturers, starting with the King Super 20 around 1950, have made saxophone necks, bells, or entire instruments from sterling silver. Keilwerth and P. Mauriat have made saxes with a nickel silver body. Opinions vary on the significance of body materials to sound. [...] With the exception of the identical brass and <b>phosphor</b> <b>bronze</b> Yanagisawa models, opportunities to isolate body materials from other variables in design and construction are lacking.|$|E

2500|$|A {{potentiometer}} or pot is a three-terminal resistor with a {{continuously adjustable}} tapping point controlled by rotation of a shaft or knob or by a linear slider. [...] It {{is called a}} potentiometer {{because it can be}} connected as an adjustable voltage divider to provide a variable potential at the terminal connected to the tapping point. A volume control for an audio device is a common use of a potentiometer. [...] A typical low power potentiometer (see drawing) is constructed of a flat resistance element (B) of carbon composition, metal film, or conductive plastic, with a springy <b>phosphor</b> <b>bronze</b> wiper contact (C) which moves along the surface. [...] An alternate construction is resistance wire wound on a form, with the wiper sliding axially along the coil. [...] These have lower resolution, since as the wiper moves the resistance changes in steps equal to the resistance of a single turn.|$|E
2500|$|In 1971, Captain T R Kirkpatrick RE led {{the landing}} party on a {{government}} expedition named [...] "Operation Top Hat" [...] that was mounted from RFA Engadine {{to establish that}} the rock {{was part of the}} United Kingdom and to prepare the islet for the installation of a light beacon. The landing party included Royal Engineers, Royal Marines and civilian members from the Institute of Geological Sciences in London. The party was landed by winch line from the Wessex 5 helicopters of the Royal Naval Air Services Commando Headquarters Squadron, commanded by Lt Cmdr Neil Foster RN. As well as collecting samples of the aegerine granite, rockallite, for later analysis in London, the top of the rock was blown off using a newly developed blasting technique, Precision Pre-Splitting. This created a level area that was drilled to take the anchorages for the light beacon that was installed the following year. There was no evidence of the brass plate thought to have been installed in 1955 and two <b>phosphor</b> <b>bronze</b> plates were chased into the wall above Hall's Ledge, each secured by four 80-tonne rock-anchor bolts.|$|E
