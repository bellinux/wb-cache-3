A generalized likelihood ratio test (GLRT) is developed and shown to be a function of the negative-sequence phasor estimator and the acceptable level of imbalances for nominal system operations. As a by-product to the proposed detectionmethod, a constrained estima-tion of the positive and negative phasors and the frequency devia-tion is obtained for both balanced and unbalanced situations.
