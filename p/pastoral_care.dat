The program emphasizes the helping relationship, theological understandings of <b>pastoral</b> <b>care,</b> the multicultural contexts of <b>pastoral</b> <b>care,</b> psychotherapeutic theories and strategies for change, and various forms of <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> and counseling. A race, class, and gender analysis will be appropriated {{to the practice of}} care and counseling. Questions regarding the program may be directed to Danielle Hunter, Director, D. Min.

5|$|Yet if the Benedictine reforms {{dominate}} the sources from this period, their wider impact {{should not be}} overstressed: large areas of England were affected only minimally, if at all. It was the emergence of small local churches {{and the development of}} new systems of <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> – processes only imperfectly documented – that would have the more enduring impact and more thoroughgoing effect on religious life in England.|$|E
5|$|Little {{is known}} of the early life of Plegmund except that he was of Mercian descent. A later tradition, dating 300 years after his death, stated that Plegmund lived as a hermit at Plemstall in Cheshire. His {{reputation}} as a scholar {{attracted the attention of}} King Alfred the Great, who was trying to revive scholarship. Some time before 887, Alfred summoned Plegmund to his court. There he worked with three other scholars, Wærferth, Bishop of Worcester, Æthelstan and Wærwulf in working on translating Pope Gregory the Great's treatise <b>Pastoral</b> <b>Care</b> into Old English.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} {{the ninth}} century Alfred the Great started to revive {{learning}} and monasticism, and this work was carried on by his grandson, King Æthelstan (924–939). Kings before Edgar (959–975) did not take the view, which was adopted by Æthelwold and his circle, that the only worthwhile religious life was Benedictine monasticism. When Gérard of Brogne reformed the Abbey of Saint Bertin in Saint-Omer in 944, dissident monks found a refuge in England under King Edmund (939–946). Before the tenth-century reform, the lines between secular clergy and monastics were sometimes blurred. There are cases of communities of monks established to provide <b>pastoral</b> <b>care,</b> and clergy in some secular establishments lived according to monastic rules.|$|E

5|$|Bede wrote Ecgbert {{a letter}} dealing with monastic {{issues as well}} as the {{problems}} of large dioceses. The letter, written in 734, became known as the Epistola ad Ecgberhtum episcopum. Bede urged Ecgbert to study Gregory the Great's <b>Pastoral</b> <b>Care,</b> and held up Aidan and Cuthbert as examples of model bishops. The main thrust of Bede's letter was to urge Ecgbert to reform his church to more closely resemble Gregory the Great's original plan for it. Bede's admonition to divide up dioceses fell on deaf ears, as Egbert did not break up his large diocese. The suffragans continued to be limited to the bishops of Hexham, Lindisfarne, and Whithorn.|$|E
5|$|In 893 Asser wrote a {{biography}} of Alfred, called the Life of King Alfred. The manuscript survived to modern times in only one copy, {{which was part of}} the Cotton library. That copy was destroyed in a fire in 1731, but transcriptions that had been made earlier, together with material from Asser's work which was included by other early writers, have enabled the work to be reconstructed. The biography is the main source of information about Alfred's life and provides far more information about Alfred than is known about any other early English ruler. Asser assisted Alfred in his translation of Gregory the Great's <b>Pastoral</b> <b>Care,</b> and possibly with other works.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between 887 and 892, Alfred gave Asser {{the monastery}} of Exeter. Asser {{subsequently}} became Bishop of Sherborne, though {{the year of}} succession is unknown. Asser's predecessor as Bishop of Sherborne, Wulfsige, {{is known to have}} attested a charter sometime between 890 and 896. Asser's first appearance in the position is in 900, when he appears as a witness to a charter; hence the succession can only be dated to the years 890 to 900. In any event, Asser had already been a bishop prior to his appointment to the see of Sherborne, since Wulfsige is known to have received a copy of Alfred's <b>Pastoral</b> <b>Care</b> in which Asser is described as a bishop.|$|E

40|$|The classis and the visitation of congregations {{in three}} church orders. It is said by {{reformed}} church politicians that the classis {{as a major}} assembly in reformed church polity {{is the cornerstone of}} the church as a denomination. In the tradition in which the church order of the wellknown Synod of Dordrecht of 1618 – 1619 plays an important role, the classis is used as an assembly of local congregations caring for one another and helping to become better churches. This means that the visit of a commission of the classis to a congregation to care for it should be of a pastoral nature. The <b>pastoral</b> <b>caring</b> and advice of the classis should enable a congregation to become a better church. The members of this commission are, however, not rated as superior or more important ministers. The acceptance of their competent advice by equals helps the latter only to fulfil their ecclesiastical calling.  </p...|$|R

5|$|St Margaret's {{serves as}} the parish church of Ifield parish, which has four churches—one {{in each of the}} neighbourhoods it covers—and a church plant venue at Ifield West (part of the Ifield neighbourhood). A team rector, {{responsible}} for the running of all four churches and their <b>pastoral</b> <b>care,</b> is based at St Margaret's. Bewbush is served by St Mary Magdalene's Church in the far southwest of the parish. St Alban's Church, a brick building with a tall bell tower, is in nearby Gossops Green, and Langley Green is served by St Leonard's Church. All of these churches were built after the Second World War, when the new town was designed.|$|E
5|$|The Anglo-Saxons {{produced}} extensive {{poetry in}} Old English, {{some of which}} was written down {{as early as the}} 9th century, although most surviving poems were compiled in the 10th and early 11th century. Beowulf, probably written between 650 and 750, is typical of these poems, portraying a vivid, heroic tale, ending with the protagonist's death {{at the hands of a}} dragon, but still showing signs of the new Christian influences in England. Old English was also used for academic and courtly writing from the 9th century onwards, including translations of popular foreign works, including The <b>Pastoral</b> <b>Care.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{conversion}} of the Gaelic kingdom of Dál Riata in the west of modern Scotland is traditionally attributed {{to the work of}} St. Columba. However, given the close cultural and linguistic ties, and the short distance across the seas, between the region and Ireland, which had begun to be Christianised from at least the fifth century, it is likely that Christianity had already reached this part of modern Scotland before his arrival in the mid-sixth century. In this view, the role of clergy owing their loyalty to Iona and elsewhere was to consolidate the position of Christianity in the region and beyond and to provide <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> for the people there.|$|E
40|$|There {{is within}} the history of Christian worship {{practices}} {{a long tradition of}} someone offering a sermon to those gathered for worship. The primary means for many Christians throughout the world of receiving Christian education and guidance is by listening to sermons. There is generally embedded in all Christian preaching some attempt {{on the part of the}} preacher to share a worldview based upon the his or her biblical and theological interpretation of the meaning of faith and their application to daily living. This article explores how the sermon can be a source of religious instruction and aspect of <b>pastoral</b> <b>caring</b> for those infected and affected by HIV and AIDS. The article also suggests that such sermons can be a form of advocating social justice for those who are stigmatized because of their HIV status.

40|$|This article {{explored}} {{the meaning of}} love as an ethical principle and the aim of providing <b>pastoral</b> counselling and <b>care.</b> The author, inspired {{by the work of}} Professor Julian M�ller, applied Paul Tillich�s notion of love to affirm the value of pastoral counselling as a constituent practice and research focus of practical theology. The focus of the discussion was upon love as the primary witness of the church and motivating factor for offering <b>pastoral</b> counselling and <b>care</b> to those who seek it. Distinctions were drawn between psychotherapeutic counselling and pastoral counselling. M�ller�s postfoundationalist approach to listening and reflecting upon the work of pastoral counselling and valuing the counselee or co-researcher role as teacher was supported. </span...|$|R
5|$|There is some {{distance}} between legislation and its enforcement. The governmental attacks on recusancy were mostly upon the gentry. Few recusants were actually fined; the fines that were imposed were often at reduced rates; the persecution eased; priests came to recognise {{that they should}} not refuse communion to occasional conformists. The persecutions did not extinguish the faith, but they tested it sorely. The huge number of Roman Catholics in East Anglia and the North in the 1560s disappeared into the general population in part because recusant priests largely served the great Roman Catholic houses, which alone could hide them. Without the Mass and <b>pastoral</b> <b>care,</b> yeomen, artisans and husbandmen fell into conformism. Roman Catholicism, supported by foreign or expatriate priests, came to be seen as treasonous.|$|E
5|$|<b>Pastoral</b> <b>care</b> is {{provided}} {{through the house}} system. Each pupil is assigned to a house. Each house has its own accommodation {{in the school and}} its own set of tutors to look after members of the house. There are eight vertically integrated houses in total, each with its own colour and heraldic-like shield: The two boys' boarding houses are York (red) and Northumberland (pale blue). The three day boys' houses are Tees (dark green) and Dale (burgundy), both formed by splitting Teesdale House, the first day boys' house, and finally Durham (gold), which was converted from boarding to day when the school expanded in the 1990s. The boarding girls belong to the original Sixth Form girls' house, Longfield (dark pink), and the new houses formed for day girls when the school became co-educational are Marwood (purple) and more recently Bowes (pale green). The school considered abolishing its boarding facilities when, like many boarding schools, it suffered a significant drop in numbers during the 1990s. However, numbers unexpectedly improved {{around the turn of the}} millennium, and this turnaround has often been attributed to the positive image that boarding received from the Harry Potter series. The school is interdenominational, whilst maintaining its foundation in Christian principles and values.|$|E
5|$|The {{headmaster}} is {{a member}} of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference and is responsible to the governors for the whole school from 7 to 18, though is primarily based in the Senior School. Housemasters are managed by the principal deputy head, who is accountable to the headteacher for the <b>pastoral</b> <b>care</b> and discipline of the school, as well as for much of the rest of the school's non-academic activity. The governors form the Board of Governors, also known as the Council of Management, which meets each term and is headed by a chairman. Past chairmen have included Donald Dalrymple ON, physician and Liberal MP for Bath (1868–73), J. J. Colman, head of the Colman's mustard company and Liberal MP for Norwich (1890–1898), Augustus Jessopp (1900–1903), James Stuart, founder of the University Extension Movement and Rector of the University of St Andrews (1903–1913), E. E. Blyth, first Lord Mayor of Norwich (1913–1934), David Cranage, Dean of Norwich (1934–1945), and General Manager of Norwich Union E. F. Williamson (1945–1954). The current chairman is P. J. E. Smith. Several governor positions are appointed by organisations closely connected to the school. The dean and chapter of Norwich Cathedral appoint one governor, and the Worshipful Company of Dyers appoint three. The school's historical connection with the Dyers, one of the Livery Companies of the City of London, dates back to 1947 when HH Judge Norman Daynes, an Old Norvicensian, was the Prime Warden of the Company. The charitable trust of the Company continues to be a major benefactor of the school through the funding of building expansion and bursaries. The school is also a member of the Choir Schools' Association and the Lower School {{is a member}} of the Independent Association of Prep Schools.|$|E
