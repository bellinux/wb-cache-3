5|$|Antoinism {{believes}} in a dualistic universe {{composed of a}} spiritual world governed by the law of God or consciousness, and of a corporal world, governed by natural laws, in which matter is an illusion <b>perceived</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> imagination generated by intelligence. The man combines in himself both worlds, as he has a physical body and a divine consciousness. In Antoinist views, the importance of human laws and science is weakened as they are based not on consciousness, but on intelligence. The view of the matter is, however, not considered a sin, but an error that causes suffering.|$|E
5|$|During the Battle of Britain, from July to October 1940, the Spitfire was <b>perceived</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> {{public to}} be the main RAF fighter, though the more {{numerous}} Hawker Hurricane shouldered a greater proportion of the burden against Nazi Germany's air force, the Luftwaffe. Spitfire units, however, had a lower attrition rate and a higher victory-to-loss ratio than those flying Hurricanes because of its higher performance. During the Battle, Spitfires in general were tasked with engaging Luftwaffe fightersmainly Messerschmitt Bf 109E series aircraft which were a close match for them.|$|E

5|$|The storm {{attained}} tropical characteristics near 0000UTC while situated {{south of}} Louisiana and was subsequently designated a tropical depression. Ship communications {{off the coast}} on July24 relayed winds of 23–50knots and a barometric pressure of 1007.5mbar (29.75inHg), which indicated it was a tropical storm on the Saffir–Simpson Hurricane Scale. Radar imagery taken near 0733CST (1333UTC) from a Dow Chemical plant in Freeport, Texas evidenced that Debra was a full-fledged Category1 hurricane on the scale, with a prominent spiral appearance that was not <b>perceived</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> radar the previous afternoon.|$|E

5|$|Maxwell {{was also}} {{interested}} in applying his theory of colour perception, namely in colour photography. Stemming directly from his psychological work on colour perception: if a sum of any three lights could reproduce any perceivable colour, then colour photographs could be produced {{with a set of}} three coloured filters. In the course of his 1855 paper, Maxwell proposed that, if three black-and-white photographs of a scene were taken through red, green and blue filters and transparent prints of the images were projected onto a screen using three projectors equipped with similar filters, when superimposed on the screen the result would be <b>perceived</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> human eye as a complete reproduction of all the colours in the scene.|$|E

5|$|Myrmecophilous (ant-loving) {{caterpillars}} of {{the butterfly}} family Lycaenidae (e.g., blues, coppers, or hairstreaks) are herded by the ants, led to feeding {{areas in the}} daytime, and brought inside the ants' nest at night. The caterpillars have a gland which secretes honeydew when the ants massage them. Some caterpillars produce vibrations and sounds that are <b>perceived</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> ants. A similar adaptation {{can be seen in}} Grizzled skipper butterflies that emit vibrations by expanding their wings in order to communicate with ants, which are natural predators of these butterflies. Other caterpillars have evolved from ant-loving to ant-eating: these myrmecophagous caterpillars secrete a pheromone that makes the ants act as if the caterpillar is one of their own larvae. The caterpillar is then taken into the ant nest where it feeds on the ant larvae.|$|E
5|$|The eggs hatch {{after about}} three weeks and the young are {{attended}} by both parents. Males are present around the nest {{for most of the}} day, and females most of the night. The parents exchange nest duties in the morning and in the evening. Most of the feeding of the chicks occurs during the period where they swap nesting duties. Little feeding is done in the period of the day that is between the two duty swaps and no feeding is done between midnight and 6a.m. Chick mortality is highest in the first twenty days post hatching, with anywhere from 37 to 83% of hatchlings surviving to three weeks of age in the Everglades. During periods of food limitations and starvation events, the American white ibis tends to exhibit sex-dependent pre-fledgling mortality. For many bird species that have sexually dimorphic nestlings, mortality rates are higher for larger-sized male nestlings {{as a result of the}} parents' inability to meet its greater nutritional needs. However, in the case of the American white ibis, the male nestlings actually have a lower mortality rate as compared to the females despite being on average 15% greater in mass as compared to its female counterparts. Although current research has yet to discover the underlying factors to why the males tend to have better survival rates under such conditions, it is suspected that the parents tend to feed the larger male nestlings first because they are either <b>perceived</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> parents to have a higher chance of survival, or, being generally larger, the male nestlings simply out-compete the small females for food.|$|E
