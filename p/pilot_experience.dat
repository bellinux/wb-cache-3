5|$|The film, {{a romantic}} action-war picture, was rewritten by scriptwriters Hope Loring and Louis D. Lighton from {{a story by}} John Monk Saunders to {{accommodate}} Bow, Paramount's biggest star at the time. Wellman was hired as {{he was the only}} director in Hollywood at the time who had World War I combat <b>pilot</b> <b>experience,</b> although Richard Arlen and John Monk Saunders had also served in the war as military aviators. The film was shot on location on a budget of $2 million at Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas between September 7, 1926 and April 7, 1927. Hundreds of extras and some 300 pilots were involved in the filming, including pilots and planes of the United States Army Air Corps which were brought in for the filming and to provide assistance and supervision. Wellman extensively rehearsed the scenes for the Battle of Saint-Mihiel over ten days with some 3500 infantrymen on a battlefield made for the production on location. Although the cast and crew had much spare time during the filming because of weather delays, shooting conditions were intense, and Wellman frequently conflicted with the military officers brought in to supervise the picture.|$|E

25|$|In early 2008, the FAA {{issued a}} Special Federal Air Regulation (SFAR) {{directed}} at MU-2B operations. Pilots flying this aircraft after that date (current MU-2 pilots {{would have a}} year to come into compliance) were required to receive type-specific initial training, as well as recurrent training. The agency also required that a fully functional autopilot be available for single-pilot operations, and that FAA-approved checklists and operating manuals be on board at all times. Unusual for this SFAR, <b>pilot</b> <b>experience</b> in other aircraft types cannot be used to comply with MU-2 operational requirements. For instance, the requirement to perform landings within the preceding 90 calendar days before carrying passengers is altered by this SFAR to require those landings {{be made in the}} MU-2.|$|E

25|$|The Gotha G.II was {{an entirely}} new biplane {{designed}} by Hans Burkhard, who had previously reworked Oskar Ursinus's design for the G.I to make it suitable for mass-production. Burkhard abandoned the G.I's unorthodox configuration {{in favor of a}} more conventional design with the fuselage mounted on the bottom wing rather than the top. In deciding this, he had the benefit of greater <b>pilot</b> <b>experience</b> to draw upon. The difficulties of asymmetric thrust created by losing an engine on a twin-engine design had proved to be not nearly as bad as Ursinus had originally believed, and therefore the G.I's unusual design was really an answer to a non-existent problem. Furthermore, Burkhard had the opportunity to rebuild a crashed G.I (serial number 9/15) and re-arrange its components to place the fuselage on the lower wing, and found this design workable, while also removing the grave danger to the crew that landing accidents posed.|$|E
500|$|Producers Lucien Hubbard and Jesse L. Lasky hired {{director}} Wellman {{as he was}} {{the only}} director in Hollywood at the time who had World War I combat <b>pilot</b> <b>experience.</b> Actor Richard Arlen and writer John Monk Saunders had also served in World War I as military aviators. Arlen was able to do his own flying in the film and Rogers, a non-pilot, underwent flight training {{during the course of the}} production, so that, like Arlen, Rogers could also be filmed in closeup in the air. Lucien Hubbard offered flying lessons to all, and despite the number of aircraft in the air, only two incidents occurredone involved stunt pilot Dick Grace, while the other was the fatal crash of a United States Army Air Corps pilot. Wellman was able to attract War Department support and involvement in the project, and displayed considerable prowess and confidence in dealing with planes and pilots onscreen, knowing [...] "exactly what he wanted", bringing with it a [...] "no-nonsense attitude" [...] according to military film historian Lawrence H. Suid.|$|E

40|$|Unexpected {{emergency}} situations in the aviation realm (e. g., rejected takeoffs) demand an immediate {{response from the}} pilot {{in order to avoid}} severe consequences.
