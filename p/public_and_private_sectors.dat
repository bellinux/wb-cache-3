5|$|During the Brooke era, Sarawak Malays were {{predominantly}} fishermen, leading to their villages being concentrated along river banks. However, {{with the advent}} of urban development, many Malays have migrated to seek employment in <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>sectors.</b> Traditionally, they are known for their silver and brass crafts, wood carvings, and textiles.|$|E

40|$|This report {{looks at}} trends in <b>public</b> sector pay <b>and</b> compares these {{with what has}} been {{happening}} in the <b>private</b> <b>sector.</b> We start by analysing the overall levels of <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> pay, including how they have evolved over recent years and the differences after accounting for the different composition of the <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>sector</b> workforces.

5|$|Since {{the late}} 19th century, <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>sectors</b> have heavily {{developed}} the river. To aid ship and barge navigation, locks {{have been built}} along the lower Columbia and its tributaries, and dredging has opened, maintained, and enlarged shipping channels. Since the early 20th century, dams have been built across the river for power generation, navigation, irrigation, and flood control. The 14 hydroelectric dams on the Columbia's main stem and many more on its tributaries produce more than 44percent of total U.S. hydroelectric generation. Production of nuclear power has taken place at two sites along the river. Plutonium for nuclear weapons was produced for decades at the Hanford Site, which is now the most contaminated nuclear site in the US. These developments have greatly altered river environments in the watershed, mainly through industrial pollution and barriers to fish migration.|$|E
5|$|In {{the years}} {{following}} the wars, tragedy struck Gifu once again. On September 12, 1976, Typhoon 17 (Super Typhoon Fran) struck the city, killing five people and affecting over 40,000 families. Gifu recovered, however, through the establishment of various local industries. The city's growth reached such a point that it was designated a core city by the national government in 1996. As its fashion industry has declined, however, {{the city has been}} looking towards manufacturing to revive the economy. A recent construction boom, much of which has occurred around JR Gifu Station, has improved the city's economy. Both public construction projects (station area renovations and elevated walkways) and private efforts are revitalizing the city of Gifu. Gifu City Tower 43 is an example of cooperation between the <b>public</b> <b>and</b> <b>private</b> <b>sectors,</b> with part of the building belonging to the city and the remainder privately owned. Gifu expanded its size in 2006 by merging with the neighboring town of Yanaizu (from Hashima District) during the great Heisei merger.|$|E
