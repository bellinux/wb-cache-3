Patients and Methods – Twenty patients undergoing physical therapy to recover <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> range of motion participated voluntarily. Ranges of motion at the <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> joint were measured before and after each treatment with a finger goniometer. Results – Both treatments allow the range of motion recovery of the <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> joint. Moreover, {{the effectiveness of the}} Superimposed technique in improving the range of motion is significantly better than that observed after Active range of motion on its own.

40|$|SummaryIntroductionDorsal fracture-dislocation of the <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> joint is an {{unstable}} fracture that associates the anterior marginal fracture {{of the second}} phalangeal base and the dorsal dislocation of the <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> joint {{under the influence of}} the median band traction of the extensor apparatus. Stiffness and residual pain are frequent sequelae. Treatment involves choosing between the various methods with the objective of providing stable reduction allowing early mobilization. HypothesisWe relate our experience concerning treatment by <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> extension-block pinning. It consists in reduction by external manipulation and stabilization by extension-block pinning. Materials and methodsThis technique was used in 22 Trojan-type fractures. The average age of our patients was 36 years, with a predominance of males. In half of the cases, the fracture involved more than 40 % of the second phalangeal articular surface. ResultsThe mean follow-up in this series was 2 years and 7 months. Assessed based on functional, clinical, and radiological criteria, the results were good in 82 % of the cases. The <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> joint was painless and the active mobility sector mean was greater than 85 °. DiscussionThe dorsal dislocation fracture of the <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> joint is {{an unstable}} lesion. Its treatment must provide stable reduction allowing early mobilization. Various therapeutic means are described. We opted for extension-block pinning, a simple and reproducible technique with encouraging results. Level of evidenceLevel IV retrospective study...|$|R
40|$|Surgical {{release of}} the A 1 pulley for {{treatment}} of trigger finger normally produces excellent results. However, in patients with long-standing disease, {{there may be a}} persistent fixed flexion deformity of the <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> joint. This is sometimes due to a degenerative thickening of the flexor tendons and may be treated by resection of the ulnar slip of flexor digitorum superficialis tendon. One hundred seventy-two patients (228 fingers) who had undergone this procedure were reviewed at a mean follow-up of 66 months. Mean pre-operative fixed flexion deformity of the <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> joint was 331. All but eight fingers were improved by surgery and there was an average gain of 261 in passive extension (71 residual fixed flexion deformity) of the <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> joint. Full extension was attained in 141 of the 228 fingers, and in all 101 fingers with a pre-operative loss of passive extension of 301 or less.

40|$|Palmar lip {{injuries}} of the <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> joint with dorsal fracture-dislocation {{are difficult}} to treat and often require major reconstruction. A systematic review was performed and yielded 177 articles. Thirteen articles on hemi-hamate autograft were included in full-text analysis. Results of 71 cases were summarized.

Up to 50 % of the patients showed radiographic signs of osteoarthritis. However, few of those patients complained about pain or impaired finger motion. Based on this systematic analysis and review, hemi-hamate autograft can be considered reliable for the reconstruction of acute and chronic <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> joint fracture-dislocations with joint involvement > 50 %, but longer-term follow-up studies are required to evaluate its outcome, especially regarding the rate of osteoarthritis.

At a mean follow-up time of 53. 6 months, there were no residual deformities nor recurrences in the metacarpophalangeal joint. At the <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> joint, there was an overall improvement of 45 degrees in movement with a residual flexion deformity avering 30 degrees.

40|$|Pachydermodactyly is a rare, benign form {{of digital}} fibromatosis, {{characterized}} by asymptomatic and progressive, periarticular and usually symmetrical soft tissue finger swelling, {{specifically on the}} lateral aspects of the <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> joints mainly of the second, third, and fourth fingers; it mostly affects young adolescents and is probably due to repeated mechanical injury of the skin (such as repeated clasping or rubbing of crossed fingers), sometimes {{as a result of}} obsessive-compulsive disorder, which must be distinguished from obsessive “chewing pads”. This paper presents a male patient aged 19, who presented with first symptoms at the age of 12, and was diagnosed with periarticular hypertrophy: localized soft tissue thickening around the <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> joints of all fingers except the thumbs; slight hypertrophy of the skin; absence of subjective complaints; normal joint function.

The distal joint is subsequently drawn into hyperextension because the two peripheral slips of the extensor tendon are stretched by the head of the proximal phalanx (note that the two peripheral slips are inserted into the distal phalanx, while the proximal slip is inserted into the middle phalanx).

40|$|One of the commonest {{and most}} serious {{problems}} of the injured finger is stiffness of the <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> joint either in flexion or, more rarely, in extension. This {{is reflected in the}} considerable number of references (Moberg and Stener 1953, Curtis 1954, 1964, James 1962, Peacock 1963, McCormack 1964). In contrast the problem in the metacarpo-phalangeal joint is one of stiffness in extension; when immobilised in flexion the joint seldom becomes stiff because of the sagittal cam effect which keeps the collateral ligaments stretched. From dissection of fresh and fixed hand specimens some differences between the joints are immediately obvious. Firstly, the metacarpo-phalangeal joint is a ball-and-socket joint whereas the <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> joint is a hinge joint. Secondly, the configuration of the articular surfaces is different (Fig. 1). In consequence, the metacarpo-phalangeal joint allows abduction, adduction, circumduction and rotation in addition to flexion and extension. In contrast, at the <b>proximal</b> <b>interphalangeal</b> joint little movement is possible other than flexion and extension. Thirdly, hyperextension, particularly passive, is possible at the metacarpo-phalangeal joint but not at the interphalangeal joint. Fourthly, in the metacarpo-phalangeal joint the collateral ligaments are tight in flexion and slack in extension (Fig. 2) whereas in th...|$|R
