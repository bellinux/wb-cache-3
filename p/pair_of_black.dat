5|$|The {{transfer}} of postage-stamp production {{from the states}} to the Commonwealth in 1913 has resulted in four issues being produced featuring a black swan design, three commemorating a Western Australian anniversary. In 1929, a stamp designed by Perth architect George Pitt Morrison, featuring a black swan taken {{from one of the}} colonial stamp designs, marked the state's centenary. In 1954, the centenary of the first Western Australian stamp was marked by a commemorative issue in a similar style to the original one-penny Black Swan. In 1979, the state's 150th anniversary was marked with an issue featuring the anniversary logo, a stylised black swan. A 1991 series of waterbirds included a 43-cent stamp showing a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> swans nesting with cygnets. This is the only philatelic recognition of the black swan's cultural values in eastern Australia as an emblem of estuarine and riverine environments characteristic of south-eastern Australia.|$|E

These consist of a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> stripes, each bearing two conspicuous white dots, separated by a light region. The light region may be gray, white, or even golden; immediately anterior to the black stripes it is enlarged into a conspicuous light dot. While the abdomen of very young spiderlings appears bronze, the red color of the abdomen is striking in later instars. In one of the later instars, the 5th or perhaps the 6th, a red cap appears in the eye region, but this marking disappears in the following molt. The light basal band and side bands of the adult are also present in immature spiders, and, in the two instars proceeding maturity, the chelicerae are also iridescent.|$|E
25|$|Hoping {{to create}} a blockbuster, Peckinpah decided to take on Convoy (1978). His {{associates}} were perplexed, as they felt his choice to direct such substandard material {{was a result of}} his renewed cocaine use and continued alcoholism. Based on the hit song by C. W. McCall, the film was an attempt to capitalize on the huge success of Smokey and the Bandit (1977). Addictions or not, Peckinpah still felt compelled to turn the genre exercise into something more significant. Unhappy with the screenplay written by B.W.L. Norton, Peckinpah tried to encourage the actors to re-write, improvise and ad-lib their dialogue. In another departure from the script, Peckinpah attempted to add a new dimension by casting a <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> actors as members of the convoy, Madge Sinclair as Widow Woman and Franklyn Ajaye as Spider Mike. Filmed in New Mexico and starring Kris Kristofferson, Ali MacGraw and Ernest Borgnine, Convoy turned out to be yet another troubled Peckinpah production, with the director's health a continuing problem. Friend and actor James Coburn was brought in to serve as second unit director, and he filmed many of the scenes while Peckinpah remained in his on-location trailer. The film wrapped in September 1977, 11 days behind schedule and $5 million over budget. Surprisingly, Convoy was the highest-grossing picture of Peckinpah's career, notching $46.5 million at the box office, but was panned by many critics, leaving his reputation seriously damaged. For the first time in almost a decade, Peckinpah finished a picture and found himself unemployed.|$|E

500|$|In February 1991, U2 {{moved the}} album's {{recording}} sessions to the seaside manor Elsinore in the Dublin suburb of Dalkey, renting {{the house for}} â¤10,000 per month. The band nicknamed the house [...] "Dog Town" [...] for the [...] "tackiness" [...] of its exterior dog kennels, and the location was credited as such in the album notes. Lanois' strategy to record in houses, mansions, or castles was something he believed brought atmosphere to the recordings. Dublin audio services company Big Bear Sound installed a recording studio in the house, with the recording room in a converted garage diagonally beneath the control room. Video cameras and TV monitors were used to monitor and communicate between the spaces. With Elsinore located {{within walking distance of}} Bono's and the Edge's homes, the sessions there were more relaxed and productive. The band struggled with one particular songâlater released as the B-side [...] "Lady With the Spinning Head"âbut three separate tracks, [...] "The Fly", [...] "Ultraviolet (Light My Way)" [...] and [...] "Zoo Station", were derived from it. During the writing of [...] "The Fly", Bono created a persona based on an oversized <b>pair</b> <b>of</b> <b>black</b> sunglasses that he wore to lighten the mood in the studio. The character, also named [...] "The Fly", evolved into a leather-clad egomaniac meant to parody rock stardom. Bono assumed this alter ego for the band's subsequent public appearances and live performances on the Zoo TV Tour.|$|E
