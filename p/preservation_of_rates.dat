This information, embedded in the structure and transformations of the optical patterns, may be globally, regionally, or locally available. Global changes occur everywhere in the visual field during landing and include such information as flow rate acceleration due to changing speed and/or altitude. Regional changes occur within a more restricted area and include such information as horizon line motion due to aircraft pitching and rolling. Locally available changes are the most restricted and include such information as changes in runway form ratios due to changing glide slopes.

40|$|The optimal {{goals in}} the {{surgical}} treatment of rectal cancer are curative resection, anal sphincter <b>preservation,</b> and <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> sexual and voiding functions. The quality of complete resection of rectal cancer and the surrounding mesorectum can determine the prognosis of patients and their quality of life. With the emergence of total mesorectal excision {{in the field of}} rectal cancer surgery, anatomical sharp pelvic dissection has been emphasized to achieve these therapeutic goals. In the past, the <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> local recurrence and sexual/ voiding dysfunction have been high. However, with sharp pelvic dissection based on the pelvic anatomy, local recurrence has decreased to less than 10 %, and the <b>preservation</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> sexual and voiding function is high. Improved surgical techniques have created much interest in the surgical anatomy related to curative rectal cancer surgery, with particular focus on the fascial planes and nerve plexuses and their relationship to the surgical planes of dissection.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a new accounting mechanism {{in the context}} of the avoiding deforestation issue of the UNFCCC, including technical options for determining baselines of forest conversions. This proposal builds on the recent scientific achievements related to the estimation <b>of</b> tropical deforestation <b>rates</b> and to the assessment of ‘intact’ forest areas. The distinction between ‘intact’ and ‘non intact’ forests used here arises from experience with satellite-based deforestation measurements and allows accounting for carbon losses from forest degradation. The proposed accounting system would use forest area conversion rates as input data. An optimal technical solution to set baselines would be to use the time period from 1990 to 2005. The system introduces two different schemes to account for preserved carbon: one for countries with high forest conversion rates where the desired outcome would be a reduction in their rates, and another for countries with low rates. A global baseline rate would be used to discriminate between these two country categories (high and low rates). For the hypothetical accounting period 2013 - 2017 and considering 72 % of the total tropical forest domain for which data are available, the scenario of a 10 % reduction <b>of</b> the high <b>rates</b> and <b>of</b> the <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> low <b>rates</b> would result in avoided emissions of approximately 1. 6 billion tCO 2 and a total of 2. 9 billion tCO 2 accountable preserved carbon.

At the end of the 20 -year period the Soviet Union will exceed the most developed capitalist countries in labor productivity, which will ensure the lowest social outlays of production. This, in turn, will enable the Soviet Union to achieve the highest living standard of the people as compared with any capitalist country. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{theory of}} optimum {{currency}} areas (OCA) is widely used, at present, by professional economists {{to defend a}} system of independent fiat currencies. “In deciding whether and against whom a country should adopt a fixed or a flexible exchange rate, one should consider the various criteria that are familiar from {{the literature on the}} determination of optimum currency areas”(Frenkel 1985, p. 126). 1 Mainstream economists maintain that there are benefits to be derived from a system of fiat fluctuating currencies, although not necessarily from the present international monetary order.

The present {{study was conducted to}} evaluate the efficacy and safety of dexmedetomidine versus propofol for sedation in children undergoing MRI. Materials and Methods: A total of sixty children aged 2 – 10 years, having physical status 1 or 2 according to the American Society of Anesthesiologists, undergoing MRI were included in the study. Group D: (n = 30) received injection dexmedetomidine 2 μg/kg for 10 min followed by continuous infusion of 1. 0 μg/kg/h. Group P (n = 30) received injection propofol 1 mg/kg bolus followed by continuous infusion of 100 μg/kg/min. Results: The mean time for onset of sedation in Group D was much longer than in Group P (P = 0. 000). Mean duration of sedation was comparable in the two groups. The number of patients requiring increased infusion of study drug was significantly higher in Group D (30 %) as compared to Group P (16. 7 %) (P < 0. 05). The average recovery time in Group D was much longer than in Group P (P < 0. 001). Conclusion: Propofol had an advantage of providing rapid onset of sedation and quicker recovery time. Dexmedetomidine resulted in a better <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> respiratory <b>rate</b> and oxygen saturation, so it may be more suitable in children who are prone to respiratory depression.

40|$|Obstructive {{nephropathy}} and renal fibrosis: The role of bone morphogenic protein- 7 and hepatocyte growth factor. BackgroundThe nephropathy {{induced by}} ureteral obstruction {{is associated with}} increased interstitial volume due to matrix deposition, fibroblast differentiation/proliferation, and monocyte infiltration. Recent studies indicate that transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) is linked to renal fibrosis. Tumor necrosis factor (TNF-α) has {{a role in the}} recruitment of inflammatory cells. We found that infiltration of macrophages of the interstitium in unilateral ureteral obstruction (UUO) occurred as early as four hours after the onset of UUO. MethodsRecent studies indicate that a renal tubular development morphogen, bone morphogenetic protein- 7 (BMP- 7), is effective in preventing the tubulointerstitial nephritis in the setting of obstructive nephropathy. The mechanism of action appears to be <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> epithelial cell phenotype, inhibition of epithelial-mesenchymal transdifferentiation, and inhibition of injury-induced epithelial cell apoptosis. Hepatocyte growth factor (HGF) also inhibited tubulointerstitial fibrosis. ResultsIn a treatment protocol in rats with ureteral ligation, BMP- 7 restored renal function. The <b>preservation</b> <b>of</b> glomerular filtration <b>rate</b> (GFR) was accompanied by a significant decrease in cortical interstitial volume. In diabetic rats given BMP- 7 proteinuria was normalized. In mice with ureteral obstruction, HGF suppressed the expression of TGF-β and of platelet-derived growth factor. The onset of tubulointerstitial fibrosis was almost completely inhibited by HGF. ConclusionBoth BMP- 7 and HGF attenuate the tubulointerstitial fibrosis due to ureteral obstruction. They also increase GFR and renal plasma flow...|$|R
