5|$|Despite having {{completely}} {{dropped out}} of mainstream radio play since 2008, while being relegated almost solely to alternative rock stations in the United Kingdom, Silent Cry reached #8 on the albums chart in its first week of release in 2008 with 16,000 units sold. It has sold less than 50,000 units to date according to Chrysalis, {{the owners of the}} now defunct Echo Label. The subsequent Silent Cry tour was Feeder's longest <b>playing</b> <b>up</b> to 29 different dates, with many selling out. Nevertheless, Silent Cry remains their first album since 1997's Polythene not to achieve at least gold status. The 2010 follow-up Renegades, was less successful only spending two weeks in the chart after entering at #16, while also being their first since the aforementioned Polythene not to chart within the Top 10.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergence}} of Liverpool native Jimmy Case further reduced Kennedy's chances of <b>playing</b> <b>up</b> front, but Paisley felt Kennedy could perform as a midfielder, and after Kennedy replaced an injured Peter Cormack against Middlesbrough on 1 November {{he went on}} to make the number five shirt his own {{for the rest of the}} decade. His new position allowed him to use his vision and distribution to create chances for his teammates, whilst still allowing him to make runs into scoring positions to add goals himself. Liverpool won the league title in 1975–76 with a final day victory over Wolverhampton Wanderers to beat Queens Park Rangers into second place. They also secured the UEFA Cup, knocking out Hibernian (Scotland), Real Sociedad (Spain), Real Sociedad (Poland), Dynamo Dresden (Germany), and Barcelona (Spain), before facing Belgian side Club Brugge in the final. Liverpool were losing 2–0 in the first leg of the final at Anfield, before Kennedy scored the first of Liverpool's three goals to overturn the deficit; in the return leg at the Olympiastadion, Liverpool drew 1–1 to win the tie 4–3 on aggregate.|$|E

25|$|Gable's {{arrival in}} Hollywood {{occurred}} fortuitously. MGM {{was looking to}} expand its stable of male stars and he fit the bill. He first worked mainly in supporting roles, often as the villain. He made two pictures in 1931 with Wallace Beery, a supporting role in The Secret Six, then with his part increasing in size to almost match Beery's in the naval aviation film Hell Divers. MGM's publicity manager Howard Strickling developed Gable's studio image, <b>playing</b> <b>up</b> his he-man experiences and his 'lumberjack in evening clothes' persona.|$|E
25|$|Larsson {{originally}} {{chose to}} retire from international football after that World Cup. His decision was met with dismay in Sweden and there was much clamoring for {{him to return to}} the team for their campaign at Euro 2004 in Portugal. Despite initially maintaining his decision to retire, he eventually agreed to return to the national side for Euro 2004. <b>Playing</b> <b>up</b> front alongside Zlatan Ibrahimović, Larsson scored three goals in four matches and lead Sweden to the quarter-finals, where they were defeated in a penalty shoot-out by the Netherlands. Larsson's diving header against Bulgaria was voted best goal of the tournament.|$|E
25|$|In mid-1959 Scott LaFaro, who was <b>playing</b> <b>up</b> {{the street}} from Evans, said he was {{interested}} in developing a trio. LaFaro suggested Paul Motian, who had already appeared in some of Evans' first solo albums, as the drummer for the new band. The trio with LaFaro and Motian {{became one of the most}} celebrated piano trios in jazz. With this group Evans' focus settled on traditional jazz standards and original compositions, with an added emphasis on interplay among band members. Evans and LaFaro would achieve a high level of musical empathy. In December 1959 the band recorded its first album, Portrait in Jazz for Riverside Records.|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim of {{this study}} was to assess the effect of <b>Play</b> <b>Up</b> humour therapy on antipsychotic, {{benzodiazepine}} and antidepressant use in Australian nursing homes. Methods: <b>Play</b> <b>Up</b> is a humour therapy program that has been implemented in Australian nursing homes. This study was an uncontrolled retrospective review of psychotropic medication charts of 406 residents in thirty-three nursing homes before and after 12 weeks of participation in <b>Play</b> <b>Up.</b> Prevalence and mean daily equivalent doses of psychotropic medication use were analysed. Results: There were significant reductions from before to after the <b>Play</b> <b>Up</b> program in the prevalence of any psychotropic medication use, antipsychotic use and benzodiazepine use (P = 0. 001, 0. 02, 0. 007, respectively). Mean daily dose equivalents of pro re nata (PRN) antipsychotics and PRN benzodiazepines significantly reduced over time (P = 0. 007; P = 0. 001). Conclusions: <b>Play</b> <b>Up</b> was associated with an overall decline in the use of psychotropic medications. Further trials are required to confirm and better define this association. 6 page(s...|$|R

She also provided an audio commentary track about her documentary for its DVD release. It appears even on pre-2007 editions of The Shining on DVD, although most DVDs of Kubrick films before then were devoid of documentaries or audio commentaries. It has some candid interviews and very private moments caught on set, such as arguments with cast and director, moments of a no-nonsense Kubrick directing his actors, Scatman Crothers being overwhelmed with emotion during his interview, Shelley Duvall collapsing from exhaustion on the set, and Jack Nicholson enjoying <b>playing</b> <b>up</b> to the behind-the-scenes camera.|$|E

Meanwhile concerts and tours continued, with the group <b>playing</b> <b>up</b> to fifteen shows per week. A tour of New South Wales in July included some of the last pop shows staged at the Sydney Stadium on 30 July, and at Sydney Trocadero ballroom (both later demolished).

However, Patel continued to chip away and ended with six for 124 off 38 overs, and Surrey were bowled out for 324, leading by 62 in what shaped {{up to be a}} close match. Before stumps, Kent lost the wicket of David Fulton for 18, but still made 37 for 1. With Key and Martin van Jaarsveld finally <b>playing</b> <b>up</b> to their potential, Key scoring 189 and van Jaarsveld 168, the Surrey bowlers were shown to be rather inadequate as Kent racked up 467 for 4 declared to set Surrey a massive 406 to win in a day.|$|E

25|$|Robertson {{wrote to}} Haig (28 February) that Lloyd George was “an awful liar” for {{claiming}} that the French had originated the proposal (the Prime Minister had in fact met Major Berthier de Sauvigny (15 February), a French liaison officer in London, telling him that Haig needed to be subordinated to Nivelle for the offensive and that if necessary he would be replaced), and that he lacked the “honesty & truth” to remain Prime Minister. Haig claimed (3 March) that with the BEF spread more thinly by having recently taken over line to the south, German forces (they had recently added 300 battalions by more intensive mobilisation, and by withdrawing to the Hindenburg Line would later free up an extra 15–20 divisions (135 -180 battalions)) {{might be used to}} attack at Ypres and cut him off from the Channel Ports. The French assumed Haig was inventing this threat (possibly true – in the summer of 1917 Haig’s staff confessed to MacDonogh of <b>playing</b> <b>up</b> such a threat to avoid cooperating with the French).|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} part of Adrian Lewis' career until 2007, he was Taylor's protégé having practised {{together}} in their home city Stoke-on-Trent and made his television debut in 2004, aged 19, at the UK Open. However, Lewis has kicked on since then and has amassed four PDC major titles including two consecutive World titles in 2011 and 2012. The pair have been part of what has been a feisty rivalry at times. For instance, in their semi-final meeting at the 2010 World Grand Prix, Taylor accused Lewis of <b>playing</b> <b>up</b> to the crowd to put him off. Lewis would win that encounter five sets to four. Lewis and Taylor have met in four PDC major finals during their rivalry. These have included the finals of the 2008 and 2011 European Championship which Taylor won 11–5 and 11–8 respectively, the final of the 2013 Masters which Taylor won 10–1, as well as the final of the 2013 World Matchplay where Taylor averaged 111.23 and won 18–13. The latter involved Lewis playing in his first Matchplay final where he averaged 105.92 and hit 19 maximums. Taylor has played Lewis 70 times, winning 52 and losing 16, with 2 draws.|$|E

During an open day for the new childcare centre, Toadie falls from an out-of-control bouncy castle and is left paralysed. Sonya struggles as Toadie refuses to accept how serious his injury is. She asks Amy to continue living with them to help with Nell while Toadie recovers. Angie briefly visits to help out, but soon leaves after clashing with Sonya. The neighbours organise a benefit for Toadie, which raises over $6000. Sonya is bitten by a Redback spider at the nursery, causing her to pass out. After receiving treatment, Sonya recovers at home. She and Toadie consider using the benefit fund to pay their bills, but discover the money has been taken. Amy's ex-husband Liam Barnett (James Beck) later reveals he stole the money. Steph returns to Erinsborough and Sonya is uncomfortable having her around. However, after she learns Paul was gaslighting Steph, Sonya invites her {{to move in with}} her and Toadie. Steph's ex-girlfriend Belinda Bell (Nikki Shiels) believes Steph has feelings for Toadie, and she threatens Toadie. When Sonya learns that Belinda is the theatre nurse during Toadie's spinal surgery, she interrupts the operation, causing a complication that leaves Toadie infertile. Worried that Steph is a threat to her marriage, Sonya offers Belinda a job as Toadie's nurse. Belinda quits after one day and Sonya's insecurities are exposed. She and Toadie begin attending counselling.|$|E

While there had been previous, successful Mexican-American quarterbacks such as Tom Flores, Jim Plunkett, Joe Kapp, Jeff Garcia, Tony Romo, and Marc Bulger, unlike most of his predecessors, Sanchez is a third-generation, full Mexican and none had been embraced to the extent Sanchez was. USC fans began <b>playing</b> <b>up</b> Sanchez's ethnicity by wearing items such as sarapes, lucha libre masks, and homemade [...] "¡Viva Sanchez!" [...] T-shirts.

However, Scotland on Sunday responded in a piece placing Chalk in the context of other television shows about schools: [...] "where such dramas fall down is not in shirking some contrived social responsibility but in their <b>playing</b> <b>up</b> to so many daft myths about the teaching profession.

500|$|Pirenne, a {{nationalist}} himself, {{argued that the}} Brabant Revolution {{was a very important}} influence on the Belgian Revolution of 1830 and can be seen as an early expression of Belgian nationalism. Pirenne praised the revolution as a unification of Flemish and Walloons. He also argued that the Vonckists and Statists could be seen as the forerunners of the major political factions of Belgium post-independence, the Liberals and Catholics, and expressed sympathy with the Vonckists. Pirenne, as a liberal, could only explain the defeat of the Vonckists by <b>playing</b> <b>up</b> the economic and social backwardness of the Austrian Netherlands. He supported this viewpoint by emphasizing the disgust seen in traveler's tales written by [...] "enlightened" [...] German observers. This has been criticised by modern historians, like J.
