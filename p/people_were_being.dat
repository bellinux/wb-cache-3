5|$|A skills {{commission}} report released in 2013, backed by Labour MP Barry Sheerman, suggests that young <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> let {{down by the}} education system, with particular criticism aimed towards the lack of information, advice and guidance available to 14-19 year olds. The government were hopeful that the changes would {{have an effect on}} preventing the increase in crime levels, as figures reported a substantial percentage of young people leaving school were turning to a life of crime, with many being unable to find suitable work due to lack of skills and qualifications.|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{identified}} two themes: morality and the UN effectiveness. Off characterized Dallaire and Arbour as morally correct and MacKenzie morally wrong. In Rwanda, Dallaire lobbied the UN to intervene {{to stop the}} genocide. In Yugoslavia, MacKenzie is accused of being an apologist for the Serbs. In an interview Off admitted that she would prefer MacKenzie to be her son's commander but would want Dallaire if her <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> attacked because one puts his soldiers before the mission and the other the mission before the soldiers.|$|E

5|$|However, {{when they}} reached the American compound, Lownds refused to give them entry because he feared that North Vietnamese {{soldiers}} may have mingled with the crowd. Instead, Lownds ordered his soldiers to herd the civilians into bomb craters, disarmed the local soldiers, and kept them under guard even though North Vietnamese artillery shells continued to rain down on the base. No food or medical aid was given to the civilians as they were kept outside the wires of the American compound. Frustrated by the lack of support and poor treatment by the Americans, Phetsampou complained that his <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> treated more like an enemy. On 10 February, Laotian civilian refugees started walking back to Laos along Highway 9, because they feared for their lives and preferred to die in their own country. On February 15, through arrangements made by the Laotian embassy in Saigon, the Laotian commander and his soldiers were flown back to their country on a Royal Laotian Air Force C-47 transport aircraft.|$|E
5|$|Over 300 {{more people}} were {{reported}} arrested in early August. According to the BBC, {{the total number of}} arrests in connection with the riots was over 1,500. The Financial Times estimated that the number was higher, citing an insider saying that some 4,000 arrests had already taken place by mid July, and that Ürümqi's prisons were so full that newly arrested <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> held in a People's Liberation Army warehouse. According to the Uyghur American Association, several other Uyghur journalists and bloggers were also detained after the riots; one of them, journalist Gheyret Niyaz, was later sentenced to 15 years in prison for having spoken to foreign media. In the most high-profile case, Ilham Tohti, an ethnic Uyghur economist at Minzu University of China, was arrested two days after the riots over his criticisms of the Xinjiang government.|$|E

Thousands of <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> bused out of Bosnia each month, threatened on religious grounds. In turn, in mid-1994, Croatia was strained by 500,000 refugees, and the Croatian authorities forbade entry {{to a group of}} 462 refugees fleeing northern Bosnia, and forcing UNPROFOR to improvise shelter for them.|$|E

25|$|The {{imperial}} regent, Toyotomi Hideyoshi was so disgusted {{that his}} own Japanese <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> sold en masse into slavery on Kyushu, that {{he wrote a letter}} to Jesuit Vice-Provincial Gaspar Coelho on 24 July 1587 to demand the Portuguese, Siamese, and Cambodians stop purchasing and enslaving Japanese and return Japanese slaves who ended up as far as India. Toyotomi blamed the Portuguese and Jesuits for this slave trade and banned Christian proselytizing as a result.|$|E
25|$|On 19 September 2017, Metropolitan Police Commander Stuart Cundy {{stated that}} 60 victims had been {{identified}} and that the initial estimate of 80 dead {{was expected to be}} lower.

25|$|From 1941, the {{implementation}} of the Final Solution began, and the Holocaust in Poland proceeded with force. As the Jewish ghetto in occupied Warsaw was being liquidated by Nazi SS units, the city was the scene of the Warsaw Ghetto Uprising in April–May 1943. The elimination of Jewish ghettos in German-occupied Poland took place in a number of cities besides Warsaw and other uprisings were waged against impossible odds by desperate Jewish insurgents, whose <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> removed and exterminated.|$|E

25|$|As for the {{political}} structure of the bands, they had a chief but their {{way of dealing with}} issues was like a democracy. Any decisions that needed to be made were reached by finding a consensus between all the families of the band. Although the chief was the advisor of the band there was no guarantee that he would stay at the top. The only way the chief stayed in his position was if <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> fed and the band staved off attacks from enemy bands.|$|E
25|$|During {{the early}} 19th century, {{the demand for}} legally {{obtained}} cadavers for the study and teaching of anatomy in British medical schools greatly exceeded the supply. In the 18th century, hundreds had been executed each year, often for quite trivial crimes, but by the 19th century only 55 <b>people</b> <b>were</b> <b>being</b> hanged each year, while as many as 500 were needed. As medical science began to flourish, demand rose sharply and attracted criminal elements willing to obtain specimens by any means. The activities of body-snatchers, or resurrectionists, {{gave rise to a}} particular public fear and revulsion. Relatives, or people paid by them, often guarded new graves for a period after burial.|$|E

Buses arrived in Cancún from Mérida, where tourists were hoping to find flights home. The United States embassy told tourists to go to Mérida, although {{the next day they}} had to change their announcements because Mérida had become so packed with people. The road to Mérida was very dangerous and practically impassable for taxis, yet people dealt with the exorbitant fees being charged for passage.|$|E
