Active participants in the groups were a mix of communists, members of the Labor Party and political unaligned who wanted to be actively involved in the group.|$|E

40|$|Aim: Dentists {{experience}} frustrations {{in their}} practices with <b>people</b> living <b>on</b> <b>welfare</b> and often perceive {{the latter in}} a negative light. The difficulties encountered are detrimental to the patient-professional relationship and contribute to compromising access to care for this underprivileged population. In order to fully understand patient-professional interactions, {{it is essential to}} consider the macroscopic contexts that partake in their structuring. This paper will therefore examine the systemic influences on these interpersonal relationships to deepen our understanding of an important access-tocare and health equity determinant. Methods: Two frameworks are applied to the analysis of Québec’s oral healthcare system: the social values framework (Donabedian A. In: Aspects of Medical Care Administration. Harvard University Press; 1973, p. 58) and the regulatory logics framework (Contandriopoulos AP. In: La Santé demain. Economica; 1999. p. 87). Results: Our assessment leads us to posit two phenomena: 1) certain negative stereotypes regarding patients living <b>on</b> <b>welfare</b> allow dentists to manage the inevitable regulatory conflicts (i. e. professional vs economic) involved in their practices and 2) patient behaviors are frequently judged {{on the basis of the}} social values embodied in Québec’s oral healthcare system’s organization, delivery and financing. Conclusion: Currently, Québec’s oral healthcare system fails to provide effective access to care for individuals who are particularly at risk for dental disease. Dentists should increase their sensitivity to systemic impacts on their rapport with <b>people</b> living <b>on</b> <b>welfare</b> and governments must significantly augment their involvement in the oral healthcare sector. New considerations for the field of dental professional education are also advanced. Prat Organ Soins. 2011; 42 (3) : 195 - 20...|$|R

40|$|The {{passage of}} welfare reform renewed a long-standing debate over whether {{improved}} public transit would significantly lessen {{the length of time}} that <b>people</b> remain <b>on</b> <b>welfare.</b> Language of the act reflects an assumption that it would. On the other hand, the automobile provides such a high level of service and is so widely available even to the poor {{that it is difficult to}} comprehend how improved public transportation would make a difference to the employability of the poor. Studies addressing this issue do not achieve consensus, we argue, because of methodological issues, particularly in measuring transit accessibility and in the use of aggregate vs. disaggregate data. In this paper we introduce a measure of transit accessibility addressing what we believe to be shortcomings of earlier measures. We use it in a disaggregate analysis of welfare recipients in Broward County, Florida and find that there is a statistically significant association between transit accessibility and length of time <b>on</b> <b>welfare.</b> A one percent improvement in transit accessibility reduces the amount of time that the average <b>welfare</b> recipient is <b>on</b> <b>welfare</b> by one day...|$|R

5000|$|Alongside his {{personal}} history, Vance raises {{questions such as}} the responsibility {{of his family and}} people for their own misfortune. Vance blames hillbilly culture and its encouragement of social rot. Comparatively, he feels that economic insecurity plays a much lesser role. While there is danger in blaming a people for their misfortunes, Vance has greater credence as an insider to the culture. As a grocery store cashier working checkout, he watched <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>welfare</b> talk on cell phones while Vance himself could not afford one. This resentment towards those who profited from misdeeds while he struggled, especially combined with his values of personal responsibility and tough love, is a microcosm of Appalachia's overall political swing from strong Democratic Party to strong Republican affiliations. Likewise, he recounts stories about lack of work ethic. For example, someone who did not like his job's hours and quit only to post on social media about the [...] "Obama economy", and a co-worker who would skip work even though his girlfriend was pregnant.|$|E
5000|$|In 1995, Renee Cox, Fo Wilson and Tony Cokes {{created the}} Negro Art Collective to fight {{cultural}} misrepresentations about Black Americans. The collective, working with Creative Time and Gee Street Records, created a poster campaign to challenge and provoke preconceived notions about race, crime and poverty. “As far as representation, {{we have to}} take it back,” Cox explained to the Daily News. The NAC appropriated a quote from scholar Charles Murray and added their commentary so as to appropriate the quote for their purposes.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: New {{provisions}} in welfare reform target recipients with addictions, {{even though there}} is limited research on how substance abuse affects <b>people's</b> experiences <b>on</b> <b>welfare.</b> This prospective study examined substance abuse as a determinant of subsequent welfare dependency. METHODS: Representative samples of clients on Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and general assistance in a California county were interviewed while applying for services in 1989 and were reinterviewed in 1995. RESULTS: Among AFDC recipients, substance abuse was not a significant determinant of long welfare stays, repeat welfare use, or the total time a person remained <b>on</b> <b>welfare</b> during the 6 -year period. However, substance abuse was a strong predictor of repeat welfare use among general assistance recipients. CONCLUSIONS: Alcohol and drug problems have played dramatically different roles in welfare dependency within the AFDC and general assistance populations. Under welfare reform, local general assistance programs will be the final safety net for recipients removed from federal entitlement programs. These programs will probably be confronted with clients with more complex disabilities related to addiction, as well as with greater family needs for cash assistance...|$|R

5000|$|After graduating with an M.D. at the University of Zurich in 1917, Sigerist devoted {{himself to}} the study of the history of medicine. Socialized Medicine in the Soviet Union (1937), and History of Medicine were among his most {{important}} works. He emerged as a major spokesman for [...] "compulsory health insurance". From 1932 to 1947 he was director at Johns Hopkins University institute of history of medicine. He received financial aid from the Rockefeller Institute. He attacked the American Medical Association because of his conflicting views on socialized medicine. Dr. Sigerist was influential in the creation of socialized medicine in Canada. He made four trips to Canada in the 1930s and 1940s at the invitation of various medical groups to speak on this topic. Under his influence, Saskatchewan introduced state-funded medical and hospital care for pensioners, <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>welfare</b> and cancer patients after being hired to write a report in 1944 by Tommy Douglas the socialist Premier of that Canadian province. This was the basis for the eventual adoption of government funded health care in all of Canada.|$|E

One insight from his research with his colleagues was that <b>people</b> <b>on</b> <b>welfare</b> or with disabilities do not possess the family and friends networks that others have to help them with finding jobs. Azrin created The Job Club Counselor’s Manual (1981) which showed how to employ a system utilizing {{a small group of people}} who assisted each other in their job search by having the leader provide job search information and using positive behavioral leadership by recording member’s positive actions such as number of employer contacts made, applications submitted, and interviews obtained. Participants take ownership of the quest as they share information and encourage each other. Azrin’s successful job club concept soon spread throughout North America and continues to help people with obtaining employment.|$|E

40|$|The Survey of Income and Program Participation (SIPP) {{has become}} an {{important}} tool for studying how long <b>people</b> stay <b>on</b> <b>welfare</b> programs because it has monthly data {{on a variety of}} welfare programs. This article presents estimates of duration models for unmarried women with children who are on the Aid to Families with Dependent Children program (AFDC) using the 1984 and 1985 panels of SIPP. A weakness in previous welfare duration studies is that they do not include local labor market conditions or other local area effects; this omission may bias the estimated effects of policy variables (such as benefit levels) and labor market variables. This article incorporates relevant local area information from the City County Data Book and links this to SIPP <b>welfare</b> recipients based <b>on</b> county of residence.
