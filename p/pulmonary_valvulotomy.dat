40|$|Previously, {{surgical}} repair for neonates with {{pulmonary atresia}} and intact ventricular septum (PAIVS) involved: either 1) a palliative systemic-to-pulmonary shunt, or 2) a corrective <b>pulmonary</b> <b>valvulotomy</b> together with {{reconstruction of the}} right ventricular outflow tract. 1 However, the mortality and the morbidity remained high after surgery, especially in those with severe hypoplastic right ventricles with or without infundibulum, non-confluent pulmonary arteries, ventriculocoronary communication (VCC), and right ventricle-dependent coronary circulation (RVDCC). 2 Recently, transcatheter radiofrequency <b>pulmonary</b> <b>valvulotomy</b> and valvuloplasty (RPVV) emerged as a promising alternative to surgical <b>pulmonary</b> <b>valvulotomy</b> for PAIVS in patients with favorable morphology of the right ventricle, the tricuspid valve, and the pulmonary valve. ...|$|E
40|$|A case of {{successful}} tricuspid valve replacement with a mechanical prosthesis and <b>pulmonary</b> <b>valvulotomy</b> for {{carcinoid heart disease}} is reported. The patient was a 61 years old women. The primary tumor was in the terminal ileum. Liver metastasis and carcinoid syndrome were present since 8 years. After cardiac surgery, the patient survived 38 months and late death was related to disseminated metastasis. Even in case of metastasis, carcinoid tumor is slow growing. Without cardiac operation for correction of valvular lesions, terminal symptoms and death may often be related to cardiac operation for correction of valvular lesions, terminal symptoms and death may often be related to cardiac failure rather than to tumoral growth. Thus, even in presence of metastasis, cardiac surgery may be mandatory to improve both {{quality of life and}} survival. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|SURGICAL {{treatment}} of pulmonary steno-sis has {{advanced to the}} point where a choice of several operative technics is avail-able. This study constitutes a comparative review of the late recatheterization results in the open versus closed method of pulmonary valvuloplasty. Doyen reported an unsuccessful attempt to relieve pulmonary stenosis by transventricular valvulotomy in 1913. 1 In 1948, Sellors reported a successful transventricular valvulotomy, 2 and Brock reported three successful cases of pul-monary valvulotomy. 3 The transventricular valvulotomy, commonly called the Brock pro-cedure, has been used extensively. Varco in-troduced <b>pulmonary</b> <b>valvulotomy</b> under direct vision by a transarterial approach, inflow oc-clusion, and normothermia. 4 Swan, combining hypothermia and inflow occlusion, 5 increased the length of time available in correcting valvular stenosis by direct vision. With total cardiopulmonary bypass, anatomically precise valvulotomy, deliberate infundibular resection when necessary, and repair of associated de-fects can be done. There are several reports of disappointing results following closed procedures for pul-monary stenosis because of failure to relieve the obstruction. 5 - 11 In 1956 we reported the preoperative and postoperative right ventricu...|$|E
40|$|DURING {{the past}} two decades great strides {{have been made in the}} {{surgical}} treatment of tetralogy of Fallot. Prior to 1944, only conservative medical treatment could be offered to these patients. Since the develop-ment of the systemic-pulmonary artery shunt operation that year, 1 this procedure has been extensively employed all over the world. The symptomatic relief offered by this operation is well known. This operation and its mod-ifications, later supplemented by <b>pulmonary</b> infundibulectomy or <b>valvulotomy</b> (Brock pro-cedure), were for 10 years the only operative procedures available. In 1955 the first patient with tetralogy of Fallot had the defect corrected by open intracardiac surgery. 2 Since then rapid prog-ress has been made in operative technics and in the methods of extracorporeal perfusion. A sufficiently large number of patients with a tetralogy of Fallot have now undergone open-heart surgery to permit a preliminary evalua-tion of the results. This paper presents an analysis of the follow-up in the first 146 consecutive pa-tients with tetralogy of Fallot who under-went open-heart surgery at the Johns Hop-kins Hospital from September 1956 to January 1962 and who have been followed until May 1962. The surgical and perfusion technics employed in these cases have been described by Bahnson and associates, 3 who also dis-cussed many of the factors concerned in th...|$|R
40|$|The term fetal therapy {{describes}} {{a broad range}} of therapies that are directed at the fetus with the aim of decreasing perinatal and childhood mortality, and improving quality of life. Current modalities include maternally administered drugs, needle-based interventions, fetoscopic surgery, and open surgery. Maternally administered glucocorticoids, one of the earliest fetal therapies, were shown to decrease respiratory distress syndrome in premature infants in 1972, but it wasn’t until 1999 that they were reported to impact umbilical artery blood flow. Section One examines the relationship between the fetus and placenta, including gender influences, and systematically assesses the impact of betamethasone on the fetoplacental circulation. One of my first findings was an excess of male fetuses with umbilical artery absent or reversed end-diastolic flow (AREDF). In combination with supporting data, this finding suggests that male fetuses might have higher risks of impaired placentation and function, and that perhaps ‘placental origins’ rather than ‘fetal origins’ should be explored to explain sex-ratio differences in mortality rates. In an assessment of flow changes within the fetoplacental unit of fetuses with umbilical artery AREDF after maternal administration of betamethasone I demonstrated that return in umbilical artery end-diastolic flow occurred within 24 hours, and was associated with decreased aorta and middle cerebral resistance suggesting a widespread vasodilatatory effect. I noted that maternal betamethasone administration is also associated with a reduction in fetal limb, body, and breathing movements, biophysical profile score, fetal heart rate variability, and startle response to vibroacoustic stimuli, bringing me {{to the conclusion that the}} return of end-diastolic flow in the umbilical artery is not necessarily associated with improved placental function. I also examined the ultrasound methods of estimating fetal weight, finding that the older equations were more accurate in our high-risk population than the newer volume-based equations. Section Two is centered around the treatment of Twin-Twin Transfusion Syndrome (TTTS), and the development of a statewide collaborative service in Victoria to offer fetoscopic laser therapy. I include a detailed literature review, and a separate publication that describes the process of constructing the collaboration and minimising the learning curve, and reports the excellent results achieved by the service in its first 5 years. The bottom line is that the outcomes for the first 49 consecutive cases of advanced (stage 2 - 4) TTTS were consistent with published Australian and international series, with an overall survival rate of 68 % and a one or more survival rate of 86 %. Section Three details a new technique for fetal cardiac access that involves the insertion of a cardiac catheter in much the same way that it is performed in children and adults. Utilising a lamb model over a four-year period, my multidisciplinary team including cardiologists and neonatal intensive care physicians and I developed and fine-tuned the needle-based, ultrasound- guided procedure. Without the need for maternal laparotomy, and at mid- gestation, I have been able to access the four chambers of the fetal heart, simulate <b>pulmonary</b> valvuloplasty and <b>valvulotomy,</b> and insert self-expanding stents into the foramen ovale. This capability offers great potential for translation to human care for the in utero treatment of fetal cardiac abnormalities...|$|R
40|$|Thirteen of 19 {{neonates}} seen in {{the first}} months of life with critical pulmonary stenosis (PS) and an intact ventricular septum had a diminutive right ventricle (RV) evidenced by electrocardio-graphic and angiocardiographic criteria. All were critically ill and at catheterization had hypoxemia secondary to right-to-left shunting at the atrial level, and RV hypertension. Right ventricular angiogram was useful to evaluate RV size and differentiate the children with PS from those with pulmonary atresia. <b>Pulmonary</b> <b>valvulotomy</b> was the procedure of choice and in ten children the operation resulted in marked improvement with disappearance of cyanosis and cardiomegaly within one year. All are well six months to eight and one half years later. Two children had an additional unrecognized infundibular stenosis and required a shunt after valvulotomy because of persistant cyanosis. One child had a shunt without valvulotomy and died three years later in congestive failure. The three children who have been recatheterized at two to three years postoperatively have RV pressures less than 60 mm Hg. In two the right ventricles more than doubled in size but remain small. These children are critically ill and a good salvage rate depends on rapid evaluation an...|$|E
40|$|IN THE LAST 15 years {{surgical}} {{methods for}} {{the relief of}} the pulmonic obstruction in patients with pulmonary stenosis and in-tact ventricular septum have been success-fully developed. 1 - 6 Although the open-heart technic {{with the use of}} cardiopulmonary by-pass is today the procedure of choice, the classic Brock's transventricular valvulotomy is still preferred for small infants. 7 - 9 The final conclusion as to the respective advan-tages and disadvantages of these procedures cannot be reached without long-term follow-up of the operated patients. The {{purpose of this study is}} to present an evaluation of 46 patients, 10 to 13 years, following transven-tricular <b>pulmonary</b> <b>valvulotomy</b> for pulmo-nary valvular stenosis with intact ventricular septum. Material Fifty-three consecutive patients with valvular pulmonary stenosis and intact ventricular septum were submitted to transventricular valvulotomy at the Johns Hopkins Hospital between November 1949 and January 1952. Forty-six patients sur-vived the operation and are the subject of the present report. There were 18 males and 28 fe-males in this group. At the time of surgery their ages ranged between 6 months and 33 years, the mean age being 11 years and the median 8. 8 years. The age distribution is shown in table 1. Valvular pulmonary stenosis was the only known cardiac malformation present in these patients with the exception of one with an associated atrial septal defect and of three patients who subsequently were found to have an associated infundibula...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Pulmonary {{regurgitation}} after valveless {{repair of}} right ventricular outflow tract obstruction (RVOTO) results in progressive right ventricular (RV) dilatation and dysfunction in {{an increasing number}} of patients. Since 1989, we have exclusively used cryopreserved homografts to restore pulmonary valve competence in these patients. Our 9 -year-experience with pulmonary valve insertion (PVI) in such cases has been reviewed to evaluate the indications for this procedure and its benefits. METHODS: From 1989 to 1998, 49 patients (original diagnosis: tetralogy of Fallot in 42 patients and pulmonary stenosis in seven) aged from 3 to 42 years (mean 18 +/- 9 years) underwent PVI with homografts late (mean 13 +/- 7 years) after valveless repair of RVOTO (transannular patch, n = 38; <b>pulmonary</b> <b>valvulotomy</b> therefore tau chi infundibular patch, n = 11). Preoperatively, all patients had severe pulmonary regurgitation, cardiomegaly, significant to severe RV dilatation and dysfunction, fatigue, reduced exercise tolerance, and were in NYHA class II (n = 43) or III (n = 6). Ten patients had ventricular arrhythmia. RESULTS: There was one early death, due to air embolism, and one late death, due to ventricular arrhythmia. All survivors but one, who subsequently underwent heart transplant, had symptomatic improvement after homograft insertion. The mean RV end-diastolic diameter decreased from 38 +/- 9 to 26 +/- 8 mm (P < 0. 01), and cardiothoracic ratio decreased from 0. 62 +/- 0. 07 to 0. 54 +/- 0. 04 (P < 0. 01). Good late homograft function was the rule, with all the survivors being free of reoperation for valve failure. At a mean follow-up of 42 +/- 28 months, 41 patients (87 % of the survivors) were in New York Heart Association (NYHA) class I and six in class II. Within this group three patients are still in treatment for RV failure and five for ventricular arrhythmias. In these patients, the average interval between RVOTO repair and PVI was significantly longer than in the others (18 +/- 7 vs. 12 +/- 6 years, P < 0. 01). CONCLUSION: Homograft PVI is safe and provides clinical improvement with a significant reduction in RV volume overload and excellent mid-term results in most patients with severe PR late after RVOTO repair. This procedure should be undertaken early in symptomatic patients, before severe RV failure and ventricular arrhythmias ensue. status: publishe...|$|E
