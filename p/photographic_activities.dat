There are at least two photographs taken by him that date from that same year, 1893, and by the following year he was deeply engaged in his new interest. White's grandson wrote, [...] "It is not coincidental that Clarence White's life in photography began in the year of his marriage. My grandmother wore a great many hats, and all with real flair; she was wife, mother, business manager, model, aesthetic critic, stoic, and a buffer between my grandfather and many of the unpleasantnesses of life. With steadfast devotion, she created an environment in which he could lead a calm and productive life." [...] The considerable influence of his wife in White's artistic development may be seen later when he began corresponding with Alfred Stieglitz; White often used the words [...] "we" [...] or [...] "Mrs. White and I" [...] when describing his most recent <b>photographic</b> <b>activities.</b>|$|E

The multiple baseline across participants design included baseline, teaching, maintenance, resequencing of photographs, and generalization to novel photographs phases. The {{results indicated that}} <b>photographic</b> <b>activity</b> schedules (albums depicting after-school activities) produced sustained engagement, and skills generalized to a new sequence of photographs and to new photographs.

30|$|Moreover, we {{extracted}} the <b>photographic</b> <b>activity</b> at {{the local}} scale comparing attraction patterns for residents, domestic and foreign tourists within a city. Spatial distribution of <b>photographic</b> <b>activity</b> of all those user categories follows the same universal pattern - activity density distributions {{of all types of}} users follow log-normal law pretty well while the shapes of the curves for area size vs. activity quintile appear to be strongly consistent. However, the areas covered by tourist activities are always smaller compared to the areas covered by residents with the only exception of Los Angeles where domestic tourist activities cover larger areas compared to city residents. The ratio between areas covered by tourists and city residents is different for domestic and foreign tourists and is always higher for domestic tourists with only exception of Berlin where those factors are almost the same.|$|R

He also sold amateur film cameras and projectors and produced 3-D anaglyph image slides. His company Projektion für Alle also produced a number of films in the early 20th century, some directed by Eugen, his younger brother, but with little success. In his later years Skladanowsky was accused in the press of exaggerating {{his role in the}} early days of cinema, most notably by the pioneering cameraman Guido Seeber.|$|E
5000|$|Born in 1907 in Shkodër, in the 1920s {{he studied}} {{photography}} in the Lumière brothers' school.

50|$|In May 1866 Waterhouse was {{appointed}} Assistant Surveyor {{in charge of}} the photozincographic operations of the Survey of India and after undergoing training at Dehradun in the use of photozincography for the reproduction of maps and plans, he arrived in Calcutta in December 1866 to take up his new post. The remaining thirty years of his career were to be spent in supervising the photographic operations of the Calcutta headquarters, overseeing a dramatic growth in the department's output and activities, from a minor and ill-housed offshoot of the Survey of India to one of its most important departments, housed in the impressive quarters which survive to the present day in Wood Street. As well as printing maps and plans, the Photolithographic Department of the Survey undertook a wide range of additional <b>photographic</b> <b>activities</b> under Waterhouse's direction, including the copying of the sketches made by Edward Law Durand {{in the course of his}} work with the Afghan Boundary Commission of 1884-87, the producing of presentation albums for the Viceroy relating to the Gilgit Mission of 1888 and the reproduction of photographs made by the Archaeological Survey of India.|$|E
5000|$|London in 1969 made Milan Pitlach a photographer. “He {{was fascinated}} by the new {{subject-matter}} and the evidence of a life-style which he empathised with and admired and which he quickly adopted. And because it seemed to him very significant, he wanted to record it. … He did this in photographs and diaries, both forms of expression; because more than an abstract and professional approach to reality we find here an attitude of somebody who wants and must both visually and literally give an account of an important personal experience, perhaps a key event of his life.” On his return to Czechoslovakia he continued taking photographs as a document of the gloomy Czech reality of the Husak period. A similar motivation and aesthetic marks the work produced on the travels he made during that decade (Poland, East Germany, Soviet Union). At that time he developed a subjective line, portraying the “small” world around him. These pictures were exhibited at Dokumenta 1997 and published in a book with the title Deníky / Diaries. [...] Since his emigration to West Germany (1981) he has enjoyed the possibility of free movement, and this has resulted in an intensification of his <b>photographic</b> <b>activities.</b> In his work of the Eighties, a period marked by many journeys (France, Italy, Japan, USA), the most extensive collection of photographs is from India. “In his photographs from India, which he made ten years after his English photographs we encounter formal virtuosity. Pitlach balances his compositions with professional certainty and elegance… He treats the counterpoint of light and shadow almost in the manner of the masters of the Baroque.” (Helena Honcoopová - Photographs from India, Catalogue of an exhibition, National Gallery Prague, The last of Pitlach’s major themes has been China, where he spent six years working as an architect. Recently a more elegiac and contemplative style has characterised much of his photographic output. One example is The Gospel According to Matthew, which was exhibited in the National Library in Prague (2001) and appeared as a book in 2004; other various collections have been published, for example Landscapes According to Friedrich Nietzsche, Fragments, Calligraphies and Gaspar de la Nuit.|$|E

30|$|In {{order to}} use the O/D flows of geotagged {{photography}} {{as a proxy for}} actual human mobility between cities across the globe, the appropriate normalization for the above heterogeneity is required. One way of doing it is by normalizing the O/D flows shown in Figure  2 by the number of photographs taken per 1, 000 of residents of the origin location reported in Table  1. However, this would require further assumptions about the homogeneity of the dataset representativeness for different modes of people travel behavior that would be a questionable assumption given the dataset sparsity and heterogeneity. Therefore, in the further analysis we will refrain from extrapolating the original values of O/D flows defined by the actual number of photographs taken to represent actual human mobility. In this way we will focus our analysis on the actual <b>photographic</b> <b>activity</b> of the users, keeping in mind that flows of the activity from different origins might actually have different representativeness across the entire human population and might not represent the entire variety of types of human activity from the considered origins in the considered destinations. However, we believe that <b>photographic</b> <b>activity</b> by itself is an important component of visitor behavior and might serve as a relevant proxy for measuring city visual attractiveness for the visitors.|$|R
