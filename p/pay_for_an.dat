The awards were sold by Helmut Lent's elder daughter after consultation with her mother who was in urgent need for money to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> operation. The Ministry presented the collection to the Wehrgeschichtliches Museum Rastatt.|$|E
5|$|In November 1815, Louis XVIII's {{government}} had to sign another Treaty of Paris that formally ended Napoleon's Hundred Days. The previous treaty had been quite favourable to France, but this one took a hard line. France's borders were retracted to their extent at 1790. France had to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> army to occupy her, {{for at least five}} years, at a cost of 150million francs per year. France also had to pay a war indemnity of 700million francs to the allies.|$|E

5|$|Various {{delays in}} the arrival of planes and {{equipment}} meant that Baker's squadron was unable {{to participate in the}} final major offensives of the war. In September, Baker became engaged to Scott. He asked Pyne to sell a bond to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> engagement ring, and the newspapers in the United States carried headlines that announced the engagement. Early in October, Baker was promoted again and given the rank of captain. The planes and equipment arrived for his squadron soon after. Baker had the planes painted in Princeton's black and orange and adopted a tiger for the squadron insignia. He recorded two more kills on October 28 and November 5, the last of his career (despite reports {{at the time of his}} death, Baker was not an ace, as that required five confirmed kills).|$|E
5|$|After Baby {{discovers that}} Johnny's dance partner, Penny Johnson (Cynthia Rhodes), is {{pregnant}} by Robbie Gould (Max Cantor), a womanizing waiter {{who is also}} dating and cheating on Baby's older sister, Lisa (Jane Brucker) and several other female guests, she borrows money from her father to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> illegal abortion for Penny. Jake agrees to give the money to Baby even though she says she can't tell him what it's for. Penny eventually accepts the money, but says there is another issue. Johnny and Penny perform a weekly dance at the Sheldrake, another nearby resort. Penny will miss her performance if she goes for the abortion, and they will forfeit their salary for the season. Billy suggests that Baby fill in for her. Johnny scoffs at this, which overcomes Baby's initial resistance. Billy and Penny insist that Johnny can teach anyone to dance. Johnny begins to teach Baby the mambo, and the two spend several awkward practice sessions together. Baby gradually begins to improve, and a romantic attraction grows between them.|$|E
5|$|Carmella is {{introduced}} as a barmaid at the Erinsborough bar Lou's Place. She becomes romantically involved with her colleague, Connor O'Neill (Patrick Harvey), to the disapproval {{of her father}} Rocco (Robert Forza). A feud with Connor's ex-girlfriend, Michelle Scully (Kate Keltie), results in Carmella slapping her and leaving the area. She later returns in 2004, reconciles with Connor and helps him to maintain access to his daughter Madeleine (Madison Lu). To prove that she is business-minded, Carmella becomes a magazine editor. She departs from Erinsborough suddenly after she becomes {{the victim of a}} stalker, Frank Romano (Lliam Amor). Before she leaves, she drives around with a shotgun in an attempt to kill Frank. Upon her return, Carmella loses Connor's affection to Serena Bishop (Lara Sacher). She attempts to ruin their relationship, which results in Serena's mother Liljana (Marcella Russo) slapping her to warn her off. Carmella then tries a different approach; she borrows money from her mother Lucia (Maria Mercedes) to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> operation Madeleine needs, then blackmails Connor into spending time with her. She claims to have borrowed the money from a crime mob who are harassing her for repayment, which prompts Connor to steal money to try to pay it back. When Carmella realises the trouble she has caused, she tells Connor the truth and leaves.|$|E

5|$|However, {{others found}} that the {{bundling}} of the games was a sensible business decision, most highlighting {{the risk that the}} sales of Remastered could overshadow those of Infinite Warfare and result in direct competition between the two. Stephen Wright of Gamespresso, meanwhile, agreed with Activision based around the impulsiveness of the Call of Duty fanbase, writing that due to the series' popularity, many of the individuals who felt discontent towards a new title would still choose to buy it regardless. As such, Activision had released the bundle with the knowledge that fans would certainly purchase Infinite Warfare in order to obtain a remaster of Modern Warfare, a game that was held in such high regard. While Wright did disagree with having to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> unwanted game in order to obtain another, he expressed faith that the bundle would be good value for money.|$|E
5|$|Whitney {{decides to}} give Lee another chance on the {{condition}} that he will never assault her again, therefore he should seek anger management therapy. Lee gratefully accepts for the sake of their marriage. However, on Valentine's Day, Lee leaves Whitney, leaving a handwritten note on their bed saying he no longer loves her. He returns the following day, apologising to Whitney for his actions and tells her of his plans to move to Dover. An upset Whitney, realising that Lee plans to leave on his own to figure himself out, tells him to leave and she watches him from the window as he drives off. Whitney becomes closer to Mick in Linda's absence and is warned by Shirley to stay away from him. When Mick leaves to look after Nancy when she is hit by a car Whitney is left in charge of running the pub. She later steals Vincent Hubbard's (Richard Blackwood) credit card to pay for a dog pen for Lady Di (Hot Lips), as the Carters cannot afford it due to their debts. Whitney later grows close to new bar manager Woody Woodward (Lee Ryan). Lee attempts to call Whitney but Woody tells Lee that she does not want to speak to him, so Lee sends his friend Moose (Sam Gittins) to see her, who says that Lee wants a divorce. Whitney receives a letter from Lee's solicitor, citing her unreasonable behaviour as grounds for the divorce, but Woody tells her it is not a big deal. Whitney declares that she is going to move on with her life and goes out shopping, but Woody sees she has not taken her purse and goes to give it to her. Whitney is caught shoplifting by a security guard, who offers her sex in exchange for not calling the police. Woody arrives and punches the guard, and takes Whitney home. Whitney and Woody kiss and have sex, and then a returning Mick finds them in bed together. Mick finds more items that Whitney has shoplifted, and she says she should never have married Lee as she is damaged and only good for sex but he tells her she is wrong and promises not to leave again. Mick lashes out at Whitney after learning that Linda and Shirley sold the freehold of the Vic without his knowledge to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> operation for Lady Di. A few days later, Whitney is depressed and vulnerable and, when Mick kisses her, she responds. When Shirley finds out about the kiss, she orders Whitney to get out, telling her that Mick would never choose her over Linda. Devastated, Whitney leaves Walford.|$|E

25|$|My illness {{helped me}} to see that what was missing in society is what was missing in me: a little heart, a lot of brotherhood.

What power wouldn't I trade {{for a little more}} time with my family? What price wouldn't I <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> evening with friends?

25|$|The last inheritor of the estate, Rev. Luis C.F.T.

But being unable to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> endowment to maintain the building it was sold again in 1922 to the governors of what became Stowe School. This opened on 11 May 1923. The rest of the estate was sold as separate lots. Clough Williams-Ellis purchased the Grand Avenue to prevent its felling to create building plots. Later he gave it to the school. The gardens remained in the ownership of the School until 1989 when an anonymous donor provided funds for an endowment and the National Trust assumed ownership. In 1997 the ownership of the house passed to the Stowe House Preservation Trust, the major aim of which is to restore the building.|$|E
