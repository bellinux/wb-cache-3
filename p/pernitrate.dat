40|$|The {{partitioning}} {{of relative}} nitrogen in the Arctic and the sub-Arctic troposphere based on measurements {{conducted during the}} 1988 Arctic Boundary Layer Expedition (ABLE 3 A) is described. The first set of comprehensive odd nitrogen and O 3 measurements from the Arctic/sub-Arctic free troposphere shows that a highly aged air mass that has persisted under very cold conditions is present. A large fraction of the odd nitrogen appears {{to be present in}} the form of reservoir species such as PAN. Significant quantities of as yet unknown reactive nitrogen species, such as complex alkyl nitrates and pernitrates, are expected to be present. Together with PAN, these nitrate and <b>pernitrate</b> reservoir species could control the entire NO(x) availability of the high-latitude troposphere and in turn influence the O 3 photochemistry of the region. The role of PAN in influencing the O 3 reservoir is shown to be important and may be responsible for the increasing O 3 temporal trend observed at high latitudes...|$|E
40|$|AbstractIn {{extremely}} arid regions on Earth, {{such as the}} Atacama Desert, nitrate, sulfate and perchlorate salts form in {{the atmosphere}} and accumulate on the surface from dry deposition according to diagnostic evidence in their oxygen isotopes. Salts of similar oxyanions should have formed in the atmosphere of Mars because of comparable photochemical reactions. We use a 1 -D photochemical model to calculate the deposition rates of sulfate, nitrogen oxyanions, and perchlorate from Mars’ atmosphere, given a plausible range of volcanic fluxes of sulfur- and chlorine-containing gases in the past. To calculate integrated fluxes over time, we assume that throughout the last 3 byr (the Amazonian eon), the typical background atmosphere would have been similar to today’s cold and dry environment. If the soil has been mixed by impact perturbations to a characteristic depth of ∼ 2 m during this time, given a time-average volcanic flux 0. 1 % of the modern terrestrial volcanic flux, the model suggests that the soil would have accumulated 1. 0 – 1. 7 wt. % SO 42 - and 0. 2 – 0. 4 wt. % N {{in the form of}} <b>pernitrate</b> (peroxynitrate) or nitrate. The calculated sulfate concentration is consistent with in situ observations of soils from rovers and landers and orbital gamma ray spectroscopy. However, nitrates or pernitrates are yet to be detected. The modeled formation of perchlorate via purely gas-phase oxidation of volcanically-derived chlorine is insufficient by orders of magnitude to explain 0. 4 – 0. 6 wt. % ClO 4 - measured by NASA’s Phoenix Lander. The far smaller amount of ozone in the martian atmosphere compared to the terrestrial atmosphere and the colder, drier conditions are the cause of lower rates of gas phase oxidation of chlorine volatiles to perchloric acid. Our calculations imply that non-gas-phase processes not included in the photochemical model, such as heterogeneous reactions, are likely important for the formation of perchlorate and are yet to be identified...|$|E
40|$|Oxygenated organic {{species are}} intimately {{involved}} with the fate of nitrogen oxides (NO(sub x)) and hydrogen oxides (HO(sub x)), which are necessary for tropospheric ozone formation. A recent airborne experiment (March-April, 1999) focused over the southern hemisphere (SH) Pacific Ocean (PEM-tropics-B) provided a first opportunity for a detailed characterization of the oxygenated organic composition of the remote southern hemisphere troposphere. Three co-located multi-channel airborne instruments measured a dozen key oxygenated species (carbonyls, alcohols, organic nitrates, organic <b>pernitrates,</b> peroxides) along with a comprehensive suite of C 2 -C 8 Nonmethane hydrocarbons (NMHC). These measurements reveal that in the tropical SH (0 - 30 deg south), oxygenated chemical abundances are extremely large and collectively are nearly five times those of NMHC. Even in the NH remote atmospheres their burden is {{equal to or greater}} than that of NMHC. The relatively uniform global distribution oxygenates (EPSILON Ox-org) is indicative of the presence of large natural and distributed sources. A global 3 -D model, reflecting the present state of science, is unable to correctly simulate the atmospheric distribution and variability of several of these species...|$|R
40|$|Measurements of {{peroxyacetyl nitrate}} (PAN), NO, NO 2, HNO 3, NOy (total odd nitrogen), and O 3 {{were made in}} the high-latitude {{troposphere}} over North America and Greenland (35 degrees to 82 degrees N) during the Arctic Boundary Layer Expedition (ABLE 3 A) (July-August 1988) throughout 0 -to 6 -km altitudes. These data are analyzed to quantitatively describe the relationships between various odd nitrogen species and assess their significance to global tropospheric chemistry. In the free troposphere, PAN was as much as 25 times more abundant than NOx. PAN to NOx ratio increased with increasing altitude and latitude. PAN was found to be the single most abundant reactive nitrogen species in the free troposphere and constituted a major fraction of NOy, PAN to NOy ratios were about 0. 1 in the boundary layer and increased to 0. 4 in the free troposphere. A 2 -D global photochemical model with C 1 -C 3 hydrocarbon chemistry is used to compare model predictions with measured results. A sizable portion (approximately 50 %) of the gaseous reactive nitrogen budget is unaccounted for, and unknown organic nitrates and <b>pernitrates</b> are expected to be present. Model calculations (August 1, 70 degrees N) show that a major fraction of the observed NOx (50 to 70 % of median) may find its source in the available PAN reservoir. PAN and the unknown reservoir species may have the potential to control virtually the entire NOx availability of the high latitude troposphere. It is predicted that the summer NOx and O 3 mixing ratios in the Arctic/sub-Arctic troposphere would be considerably lower {{in the absence of the}} ubiquitous PAN reservoir. Conversely, this PAN reservoir may be responsible for the observed temporal increase in tropospheric O 3 at high latitudes...|$|R
