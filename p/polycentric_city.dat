50|$|Seoul {{is in the}} {{northwest}} of South Korea. Seoul proper comprises 605.25 km2, with a radius of approximately 15 km, roughly bisected into northern and southern halves by the Han River. The Han River and its surrounding area {{played an important role}} in Korean history. The Three Kingdoms of Korea strove to take control of this land, where the river was used as a trade route to China (via the Yellow Sea). The river is no longer actively used for navigation, because its estuary is located at the borders of the two Koreas, with civilian entry barred. Historically, the city was during the Joseon Dynasty bounded by the Seoul Fortress Wall, which stretched between the four main mountains in central Seoul: Namsan, Naksan, Bukaksan and Inwangsan. The city is bordered by eight mountains, as well as the more level lands of the Han River plain and western areas. Due to its geography and to economic development policies, Seoul is a very <b>polycentric</b> <b>city.</b> The area that was the old capital in the Joseon Dynasty, and mostly comprises Jongno District and Jung District, constitutes the historical and political center of the city. However, for example, the city's financial capital is widely considered to be in Yeouido, while its economic capital is Gangnam District.|$|E

However, how to precisely design such strategies remains unclear. Indeed, whereas there is a broad consensus that urban spatial structure is a key determinant in explaining travel pattern generation, the mechanisms are not yet fully understood. Especially, the interplay between commuting and localization choices leading to cross commuting in a <b>polycentric</b> <b>city</b> remains an open question, and cannot be easily explained using existing urban economics frameworks. In this study, we introduce a novel urban economic framework, fully micro-economic based, which describes land prices, population distribution and commuting travel choices in a <b>polycentric</b> <b>city,</b> with jobs locations exogenously given. It relies on the modeling of moving costs and market imperfections, especially housing-search imperfections. Using Paris as a case study, we show how this model, when adequately calibrated, reproduces available data on the internal structure of the city (rents, population densities, travel choices). A validation over the 1900 - 2010 period also shows that the model captures the main determinants of city shape evolution over this time.

40|$|This {{paper is}} a pure {{theoretical}} attempt to explain tendencies revealed {{in the last decade}} urban researches, such as decentralization of population toward the cities suburbs, formation of <b>polycentric</b> <b>cities,</b> by a process of alteration of city traditional monocentricity, in time, due to the growth of population. It is shown that the process of alteration of monocentricity is governed by a function of two variables of urban population density. The function is developed following the observation that urban population density is dependent, in the same time, both on distance-falling with the distance from the city center- and on time-growing with the increase of population size in cities area. The city model based on the function of two variables also predicts other interesting urban phenomena, such as cities ‘’collision’’. urban population density, population growth, monocentric city model,polycentricity, decentralization of population. ...|$|R

The main question addressed in this paper is: Are the existing hedonic price models adequate in capturing the effect of accessibility?

The purpose of this research is to explore alternative measures of accessibility that are more sophisticated, and to construct improved hedonic models by incorporating the new measures. Five models were developed in this research, using a sample of housing transaction data in the Boston Metropolitan Area. Model 1 uses the traditional "distance-to-CBD " as the accessibility measure.

40|$|We exploit {{a unique}} panel of 75 metro areas (‘cities’) {{across the globe}} and employ a cityfixed effects model to {{identify}} the determinants of within-city changes in air pollution concentration between 2005 and 2011. Increasing car and population densities significantly reduce air pollution concentration in city centers where air pollution induced health risks are greatest. These effects are largely confined to cities in non-OECD countries. Two possible mechanisms for the negative effect of car density are explored: (i) increasing car density permits a decentralization of residential and economic activity; and (ii) car usage substitutes for motorbike usage. We find limited evidence in favour of (i) and no evidence in favour of (ii). We also observe a complex relationship between income and pollution concentration {{as well as a}} general downward-trend in pollution concentration over time.

40|$|We analyse how {{the interplay}} between urban costs, wage wedges and trade costs may affect the inter-regional {{location}} of firms {{as well as the}} intra-urban location, within the central business district or in a secondary employment centre (SEC) of the selected region. In this way we investigate, on the one hand, how trade may affect the internal structure of cities and, on the other hand, how decentralizing the production and consumption of goods to subcentres changes the intensity of trade by allowing large metropolitan areas to maintain their predominance. We show that, despite low commuting costs, SECs may emerge when the urban population is large and communication technologies are efficient, two features that seem to characterise modern economies. Moreover, when trade costs fall from high levels, the economy moves gradually from dispersion to agglomeration, favouring the formation of SECs. In an integrating world, however, the centre of a small monocentric city could be more attractive than subcentres of large <b>polycentric</b> <b>cities.</b> Nevertheless, the core retains its predominance through the relative growth of its main centre, which occurs at the expense of its subcentres. city structure; commuting costs; polycentric city; relocation; trade costs...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{employs a}} {{multilevel}} market potential indicator to represent urban centrality {{generated by the}} urban railway network in Berlin from 1875 – 1935. Data on population are collected for the whole study period {{on the level of}} city districts (Ortsteile) and disaggregated to the level of 15 937 statistical blocks to enable detailed mapping and spatial aggregation on a micro-level. Disaggregation is conducted referring to built-up areas available in the form of historic maps which were digitized and georeferenced. The urban railway system, including network and stations, was digitally reproduced for the whole study period and merged with micro-level population data within a GIS environment to generate the centrality indicator. We find that preceding the emergence of West Berlin’s central business district during the 1920 s, the area was excellently accessible by means of rail-based public transport. These findings confirm theoretical expectations that processes of urban decentralization lead to the emergence of sub-centers at those locations that are characterized by good accessibility and large market potential. For cities suffering from excessive congestion within their central business districts, our results suggest that city planners may successfully support the transformation of monocentric into <b>polycentric</b> <b>cities</b> by providing alternative sites with large market access based on an excellent transport infrastructure...|$|R
40|$|Polycentricity and {{regional}} development The concept of polycentricity {{is becoming increasingly}} popular in spatial policies {{on a variety of}} spatial scales, ranging from the European to the local. Although the meaning of the concept, as well as the purposes of the policies, differ between these various scales, polycentricity in general is chiefly considered a means to achieve both a more balanced spatial pattern of development and a higher level of international territorial competitiveness by the area at stake. This article deals with the application of this concept to the regional scale, the so-called ‘polycentric urban regions’. At the regional level, polycentricity {{is the result of a}} rather general contemporary tendency in the urban geography of advanced post-industrial societies: the emergence of <b>polycentric</b> <b>cities.</b> In Europe, a transition can be observed since the 1960 s 1 from urban patterns that were dominated by the self-contained functional entities of a central city with its immediate hinterland, towards networking urban systems of multiple centres of residence, employment and services. Due to predominant tendencies of spatial de-concentration and scaling-up, most urban functions, i. e. residence, manufacturing, office-based sectors, retail, wholesale, warehousing and leisure services, have extended over increasing territories to new suburban centres or to places that are strategically located from a transport point of view. Generally speaking, the traditional functional hierarchy and duality between the city centres and the multitude of suburban places is eroding in many city-regions...|$|R
40|$|International audienceInteractions between cities {{intensified}} {{and developed}} at larger scales {{during the second}} half of the twentieth century, under the impetus of lower transport costs, the growth of global economy and technological progress. The diffusion of the automobile has been spectacular, from the 1930 's onwards. In this context, relations between cities are changing: in the 1950 s, insists Gottmann emphasized the existence of strong economic interactions between decision centers and production centers within an integrated region from Boston to Washington called “megalopolis” (Gottmann, 1957). The second half of the twentieth century was marked by the increase in volume and diversity of flows of goods and people between cities. The transition described here, « [...]  large, sudden and long-lasting changes in structure and function” according to Scheffer et al (2012), is the emergence of <b>polycentric</b> <b>cities</b> "Mega-Cities" (Hall & Pain, 2006). It corresponds to a change of scale in the operation of metropolitan areas. Networks and flows that can be called long distance in the first regime transformed in terms of operation and exchanges between places, new entities, called "megacity regions", "mega-regions", "megalopolitan regions", "Regional galaxies, "or" regional states "(Soja, 2011). The long distance becomes intra-urban in the second regime. As Soja points out (2011), "The urban, the metropolitan, and the subnational-regional scales seem to be blending together". The approach presented here combines empirical observation and theoretical modeling situations, to study several explanatory factors candidates to this transition (exogenous factors related to demographics, changing economic context and endogenous factors such as interactions social and governance modes). The MetropolSim model (Le Néchet, 2012), which is integrated model LUTI (Land Use Transport Interaction) and network dynamics, agent-based, is extended.
