40|$|Distributed systems form an {{integral}} part of human life—from ATMs to the Domain Name Service. Typical distributed systems consist of distributed services interacting through messages. Failures in these systems are often the causes of huge financial loss or human catastrophes. Efficient fault detection and diagnosis of cascaded non fail-silent failures is extremely challenging because of legacy code, black-box nature of <b>application</b> <b>entities,</b> scalability and state space explosion. Current error detection and diagnosis protocols suffer from {{one or more of the}} following problems—very specific to one application, require intrusive changes to the application, lack of scalability, impose additional load on the application, are offline and cannot detect (or diagnose) the failures at runtime. ^ In this thesis, we propose Monitor, a scalable, autonomous, fault detection and diagnosis framework. The Monitor only observes the external messages between the components of the application and is unaware of any internal transition of the <b>application</b> <b>entities.</b> The Monitor uses a rule base of allowable behavior and does fast matching of incoming messages. We propose a sampling approach which adjusts a sampling rate in accordance with the incoming rate of packets such that the breakdown in the Monitor capacity is avoided. We use a distributed deployment of Monitors across the Purdue WAN to demonstrate its effectiveness. We compare the performance of the Monitor in diagnosing faults with Pinpoint, the state-of-the-art diagnosis approach. ...|$|R

In order to enforce this paradigm to devices with limited processing and storage resources, lightweight middleware components are required.

Based on this framework, JXTA-SOAP Mobile Edition is a software component that completes the Sun MicroSystem’s JXTA platform, supporting peer-to-peer sharing of Web Services. Keywords...|$|R

We propose a generic role-based abstraction that models <b>application</b> <b>entities</b> as universal plug-n-play roles and network dynamics as changes in node capabilities. In other words, application specifications are mapped as roles played by local in-network sensor nodes with sensor capabilities used as rules for role identification. We argue that the generic role-based framework, due to its universal and portable nature, has many visionary qualities. It facilitates concurrent application specification, development, and testing by providing flexible configurable interfaces. This adaptation and evolution of in-network roles also promotes their seamless integration across heterogenous sensor deployments. ...|$|R
