5|$|Microorganisms {{including}} bacteria, fungi, {{and viruses}} are important as plant pathogens, causing disease to crop plants. Fungi cause serious crop {{diseases such as}} maize leaf rust, wheat stem rust, and powdery mildew. Bacteria cause <b>plant</b> <b>diseases</b> including leaf spot and crown galls. Viruses cause <b>plant</b> <b>diseases</b> such as leaf mosaic. The oomycete Phytophthora infestans causes potato blight, contributing to the Great Irish Famine of the 1840s.|$|E
5|$|Biological {{control is}} a method of {{controlling}} pests such as insects, mites, weeds and <b>plant</b> <b>diseases</b> using other organisms. It relies on predation, parasitism, herbivory, or other natural mechanisms, but typically also involves an active human management role. It {{can be an important}} component of integrated pest management (IPM) programs.|$|E
5|$|Microbes {{can make}} {{nutrients}} and minerals {{in the soil}} available to plants, produce hormones that spur growth, stimulate the plant immune system and trigger or dampen stress responses. In general a more diverse set of soil microbes results in fewer <b>plant</b> <b>diseases</b> and higher yield.|$|E

5|$|Many thrips are pests of {{commercial}} crops {{due to the}} damage caused by feeding on developing flowers or vegetables, causing discoloration, deformities, and reduced marketability of the crop. Some thrips serve as vectors for <b>plant</b> <b>diseases,</b> such as tospoviruses. Over 20 plant-infecting viruses are known to be transmitted by thrips, but perversely, less than a dozen of the described species are known to vector tospoviruses. These enveloped viruses are considered among some of the most damaging of emerging plant pathogens around the world, with those vector species having an outsized impact on human agriculture. Virus members include the tomato spotted wilt virus and the impatiens necrotic spot viruses. The western flower thrips, Frankliniella occidentalis, has spread until it now has a worldwide distribution, and is the primary vector of <b>plant</b> <b>diseases</b> caused by tospoviruses. Their small size and predisposition towards enclosed places makes them difficult to detect by phytosanitary inspection, while their eggs, laid inside plant tissue, are well-protected from pesticide sprays. When coupled with the increasing globalization of trade and the growth of greenhouse agriculture, thrips, unsurprisingly, are among the fastest growing group of invasive species in the world. Examples include F. occidentalis, Thrips simplex, and Thrips palmi.|$|E
5|$|Mycology is {{the branch}} of biology {{concerned}} with the systematic study of fungi, including their genetic and biochemical properties, their taxonomy, and their use to humans {{as a source of}} medicine, food, and psychotropic substances consumed for religious purposes, as well as their dangers, such as poisoning or infection. The field of phytopathology, the study of <b>plant</b> <b>diseases,</b> is closely related because many plant pathogens are fungi.|$|E

5|$|Fungi create harm by spoiling food, {{destroying}} timber, and by causing {{diseases of}} crops, livestock, and humans. Fungi, mainly moulds like Penicillium and Aspergillus, spoil many stored foods. Fungi cause {{the majority of}} <b>plant</b> <b>diseases,</b> which in turn cause serious economic losses. Sometimes, as in the Great Irish Famine of 1845â€“1849, fungal diseases of plants, in this case potato blight caused by Phytophthora, result in large-scale human suffering. Fungi are similarly {{the main cause of}} economic losses of timber in buildings. Finally, fungi cause many diseases of humans and livestock; Aspergillosis kills some 600,000 people a year, mainly however those with already weakened immune systems.|$|E
5|$|Medicinal plants demand {{intensive}} management. Different species each require {{their own}} distinct conditions of cultivation.

In many medicinal and aromatic plants, plant characteristics vary widely with soil type and cropping strategy, so care is required to obtain satisfactory yields.|$|E
5|$|The oxazolidinones {{have been}} known as monoamine oxidase inhibitors since the late 1950s.

In 1987, DuPont scientists presented {{a detailed description of the}} oxazolidinones as a new class of antibiotics with a novel mechanism of action. Early compounds were found to produce liver toxicity, however, and development was discontinued.|$|E

5|$|After the war finished, Rogerson {{continued}} studying fungal systematics {{and started}} a doctoral program with Harry Morton Fitzpatrick at Cornell University; noted mycologist Richard Korf was another of Fitzpatrick's graduate students at the time. Under Fitzpatrick, Rogerson studied Hypomyces fungi and their anamorphs. Fitzpatrick committed suicide in 1950, and Donald S. Welch replaced him as Rogerson's advisor {{for the last few}} months of his doctoral program. Rogerson received his doctorate from Cornell in 1950. That year, he joined the faculty of Kansas State University as an assistant professor, but he would ultimately advance to associate professor. While at Kansas, he worked on the identification of fungi, and published nearly 20 papers on fungal taxonomic novelties, aeromycology (the fungal flora of air), and <b>plant</b> <b>diseases</b> caused by fungi.|$|E
5|$|Fungi are {{important}} crop pathogens, as they reproduce rapidly, affect {{a wide range}} of crops around the world, cause some 85% of <b>plant</b> <b>diseases,</b> and can create serious economic losses. The range of types of fungi involved is also wide, including Ascomycetes such as Fusarium causing wilt, Basidiomycetes such as Ustilago causing smuts and Puccinia causing cereal rusts, and Oomycetes such as Phytophthora causing potato late blight and the resulting Great Irish Famine of 1845-1849. Where crop diversity is low, and in particular where single varieties of major crops are nearly universal, fungal diseases can cause the loss of an entire crop, as with the potato in Ireland, and as with the monocultured crop of maize (corn) in the USA in 1970, where over a billion dollars' worth of production was lost. Similarly, the 'Gros Michel' seedless banana crop was essentially completely destroyed worldwide in the 1950s by the wild fungus, Fusarium oxysporum. It was replaced by the Cavendish banana, which in turn was in 2015 facing total destruction by the same disease.|$|E
5|$|Abundant worldwide, most fungi are {{inconspicuous}} {{because of}} the small size of their structures, and their cryptic lifestyles in soil or on dead matter. Fungi include symbionts of plants, animals, or other fungi and also parasites. They may become noticeable when fruiting, either as mushrooms or as molds. Fungi perform an essential role in the decomposition of organic matter and have fundamental roles in nutrient cycling and exchange in the environment. They have long been used as a direct source of human food, in the form of mushrooms and truffles; as a leavening agent for bread; and in the fermentation of various food products, such as wine, beer, and soy sauce. Since the 1940s, fungi have been used for the production of antibiotics, and, more recently, various enzymes produced by fungi are used industrially and in detergents. Fungi are also used as biological pesticides to control weeds, <b>plant</b> <b>diseases</b> and insect pests. Many species produce bioactive compounds called mycotoxins, such as alkaloids and polyketides, that are toxic to animals including humans. The fruiting structures of a few species contain psychotropic compounds and are consumed recreationally or in traditional spiritual ceremonies. Fungi can break down manufactured materials and buildings, and become significant pathogens of humans and other animals. Losses of crops due to fungal diseases (e.g., rice blast disease) or food spoilage can have a large impact on human food supplies and local economies.|$|E

Model GM(1, 1) was built for <b>plant</b> <b>disease</b> collected during simulative occurrence experiments. At the same time, the data of disease index and disease incidence were analyzed as reference. The results of experiments reveal that the co-deviation of Model GM(1, 1) parameter a and b, cov(a,b), coincides with the standard deviation of disease index and disease incidence. This indicates that Grey system theory is effective for disease incidence analysis and the parameters of GM(1, 1) can well reflect the change of <b>plant</b> <b>disease</b> occurrence.
