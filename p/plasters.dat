5|$|To {{deal with}} the {{complexity}} of bronze reproduction, France has promulgated several laws since 1956 which limit reproduction to twelve casts– the maximum number {{that can be made}} from an artist's <b>plasters</b> and still be considered his work. As a result of this limit, The Burghers of Calais, for example, is found in fourteen cities.|$|E
5|$|The {{preferred}} {{habitat is}} mature deciduous or mixed woodland with large, old trees, preferably oak. Pairs hold permanent territories, and nest in tree holes, usually old woodpecker nests, but sometimes natural cavities. If {{the entrance to}} the hole is too large, the female <b>plasters</b> it with mud to reduce its size, and often coats the inside of the cavity too. The 6–9 red-speckled white eggs are laid on a deep base of pine or other wood chips.|$|E
5|$|Rodin willed to the French state {{his studio}} {{and the right}} to make casts from his <b>plasters.</b> Because he {{encouraged}} the edition of his sculpted work, Rodin's sculptures are represented in many public and private collections. The Musée Rodin was founded in 1916 and opened in 1919 at the Hôtel Biron, where Rodin had lived, and it holds the largest Rodin collection, with more than 6,000 sculptures and 7,000 works on paper. The French order Légion d'honneur made him a Commander, and he received an honorary doctorate from the University of Oxford.|$|E

5|$|The {{combat system}} in Dwarf Fortress is anatomically detailed. Combat is {{displayed}} by viewing the log which describes each weapon striking a specific {{part of the}} character's body. Internal organs can get punctured, combatants can fall to the ground, vomit and lose body parts. Each dwarf has individually detailed limbs, each with damageable bone, fat, muscle and skin. Fat can be bruised without breaking bones and vice versa. Injuries sometimes can be permanent. There is a medical system where a hospital {{can be set up}} containing crutches for disabled dwarves, traction benches, <b>plasters</b> and cloth for casts and bandages, thread for suturing, and splints.|$|E

50|$|Forms of <b>plaster</b> {{have several}} other uses. In {{medicine}} <b>plaster</b> orthopedic casts are still {{often used for}} supporting set broken bones. In dentistry <b>plaster</b> is used to make dental models.

25|$|In 1974 a {{group of}} the sculptor's {{descendants}} gave twenty bronzes, marbles, original <b>plasters,</b> portfolios of drawings and paintings to the New Britain Museum of American Art. Today the Museum houses the largest repository of Borglum's works.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{a little-known}} group of 73 plaster casts, {{more or less}} closely {{resembling}} Degas's original wax sculptures, was presented as having been discovered among the materials bought by the Airaindor Foundry (later known as Airaindor-Valsuani) from Hébrard's descendants. Bronzes cast from these <b>plasters</b> were issued between 2004 and 2016 by Airaindor-Valsuani in editions inconsistently marked and thus of unknown size.

5000|$|<b>Plaster</b> {{spraying}} {{allows a}} plasterer to skim a drywall {{more than five}} times faster than using a hand float to apply it. Although classic gypsum-based <b>plaster</b> can be sprayed if it is [...] "spray grade," [...] most <b>plaster</b> sprayers prefer the organic-based pre-mixed <b>plaster</b> packaged in a plastic bag because the <b>plaster</b> spraying machine {{does not need to be}} cleaned out after the job is finished, providing that <b>plaster</b> is kept moist. The pre-mixed <b>plaster</b> also has the advantage that any surplus can be recycled, almost eliminating waste, and plasterers do not need to haul water and mix the <b>plaster</b> from powder. A drywall skimmed with pre-mixed <b>plaster</b> can be painted in less than 24 hours, depending on the ambient temperature and humidity.|$|R

25|$|Chrysotile {{has been}} used {{more than any other}} type and {{accounts}} for about 95% of the asbestos found in buildings in America. Chrysotile is more flexible than amphibole types of asbestos, and can be spun and woven into fabric. The most common use was corrugated asbestos cement roofing primarily for outbuildings, warehouses and garages. It may also be found in sheets or panels used for ceilings and sometimes for walls and floors. Chrysotile has been a component in joint compound and some <b>plasters.</b> Numerous other items have been made containing chrysotile including brake linings, fire barriers in fuseboxes, pipe insulation, floor tiles, residential shingles, and gaskets for high temperature equipment.|$|E
25|$|Portland cement is {{the most}} common type of cement in general usage. It is a basic {{ingredient}} of concrete, mortar and many <b>plasters.</b> British masonry worker Joseph Aspdin patented Portland cement in 1824. It was named because of the similarity of its color to Portland limestone, quarried from the English Isle of Portland and used extensively in London architecture. It consists of a mixture of calcium silicates (alite, belite), aluminates and ferrites - compounds which combine calcium, silicon, aluminium and iron in forms which will react with water. Portland cement and similar materials are made by heating limestone (a source of calcium) with clay or shale (a source of silicon, aluminium and iron) and grinding this product (called clinker) with a source of sulfate (most commonly gypsum).|$|E
25|$|At {{the early}} age of sixteen, he {{traveled}} to Paris to study at the Académie Julian with Raoul Verlet. Soon he befriended Rembrandt Bugatti, whom he accompanied in 1909 on a journey to Antwerp, where together they made drawings and sculptures of animals in the Zoological Garden. Howard presented these early pieces at the Salon d'Automne in 1910, but later destroyed many of these <b>plasters,</b> as he regarded them as inferior in comparison to Bugatti's works. After his return from Holland, the sculptor moved to a studio on the Avenue du Maine, in Montparnasse, and regularly presented his works in Parisian salons and galleries. In 1913, Howard presented one of his earlier female nudes, simply entitled Woman, at the Armory Show in New York and Boston. This was his first exhibition in the United States.|$|E

500|$|Since clay deteriorates rapidly if {{not kept}} wet or fired into a terra-cotta, sculptors used plaster casts {{as a means}} of {{securing}} the composition they would make from the fugitive material that is clay. [...] This was common practice amongst Rodin's contemporaries, and sculptors would exhibit plaster casts with the hopes that they would be commissioned to have the works made in a more permanent material. [...] Rodin, however, would have multiple <b>plasters</b> made and treat them as the raw material of sculpture, recombining their parts and figures into new compositions, and new names.|$|E
500|$|To {{physicians}} of the time, {{the appropriate}} treatment for [...] "apparent death" [...] was warmth and stimulation. [...] Anne Greene, a woman {{sentenced to death}} and hanged in 1650 for the supposed murder of her stillborn child, was found by anatomists to be still alive. [...] They revived her by pouring hot cordial down her throat, rubbing her limbs and extremities, bleeding her, applying heating <b>plasters</b> and a [...] "heating odoriferous Clyster to be cast up in her body, to give heat and warmth to her bowels." [...] After placing her in a warm bed with another woman, to keep her warm, she recovered fully and was pardoned.|$|E

5000|$|Lime <b>plaster</b> was {{a common}} {{building}} material for wall surfaces in {{a process known as}} lath and <b>plaster,</b> whereby a series of wooden strips on a studwork frame was covered with a semi-dry <b>plaster</b> that hardened into a surface. The <b>plaster</b> used in most lath and <b>plaster</b> construction was mainly lime <b>plaster,</b> with a cure time of about a month. To stabilize the lime <b>plaster</b> during curing, small amounts of <b>plaster</b> of Paris were incorporated into the mix. Because <b>plaster</b> of Paris sets quickly, [...] "retardants" [...] were used to slow setting time enough to allow workers to mix large working quantities of lime putty <b>plaster.</b> A modern form of this method uses expanded metal mesh over wood or metal structures, which allows a great freedom of design as it is adaptable to both simple and compound curves. Today this building method has been partly replaced with drywall, also composed mostly of gypsum <b>plaster.</b> In both these methods, a primary advantage of the material is that it is resistant to a fire within a room and so can assist in reducing or eliminating structural damage or destruction provided the fire is promptly extinguished.|$|R
