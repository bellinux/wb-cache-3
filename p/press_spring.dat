25|$|On January 7, Yellowcard {{went to the}} Middle East to do a USO tour. The group went to Kuwait as {{originally}} planned, but could not get into Iraq because of the President arriving and canceling all flights there. The band released a live album on January 22, 2008, titled iTunes Live from Las Vegas at the Palms. It was recorded during their Blue October Tour in October 2007. The band canceled several European shows in January due to drummer Longineu Parsons taking a couple months off. He spent the time in Jacksonville, Florida, with his grandmother, who raised him and whose health was failing. The band w{{as originally}} scheduled to headline a spring tour with All Time Low, but All Time Low dropped out {{to take part in}} the Alternative <b>Press</b> <b>spring</b> tour. They were then replaced by MxPx, who canceled a few weeks later. Yellowcard then went on an acoustic tour with The Spill Canvas, Secondhand Serenade, PlayRadioPlay!, and Treaty of Paris.|$|E

An {{experimental}} device {{which provided}} uniaxial sustaining tension stress to concrete was especially designed with <b>pressed</b> <b>spring.</b> The accelerated, steady state chloride migration experimental method {{was used to}} test the permeability of concrete under tension resulting from designed device. Concrete with two mixture proportions was tested to get chloride diffusion coefficient under different tension stress. Mathematics models were built to show the change of chloride diffusivity coefficient of concrete under tension...|$|R
