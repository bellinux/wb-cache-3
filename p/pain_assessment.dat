5|$|The chief complaint, and {{the onset}} of the complaint, are usually {{important}} in the diagnosis of toothache. For example, the key distinction between reversible and irreversible pulpitis is given in the history, such as pain following a stimulus in the former, and lingering pain following a stimulus and spontaneous pain in the latter. History is also important in recent filling or other dental treatment, and trauma to the teeth. Based on the most common causes of toothache (dentin hypersensitivity, periodontitis, and pulpitis), the key indicators become localization of the pain (whether the pain is perceived as originating in a specific tooth), thermal sensitivity, pain on biting, spontaneity of the pain, and factors that make the pain worse.The various qualities of the toothache, such as the effect of biting and chewing on the pain, the effect of thermal stimuli, and the effect of the pain on sleep, are verbally established by the clinician, usually in a systematic fashion, such as using the Socrates <b>pain</b> <b>assessment</b> method (see table).|$|E

40|$|Purpose. To {{investigate}} {{adherence to}} our pain protocol considering analgesics administration, number {{and timing of}} <b>pain</b> <b>assessments,</b> and adjustment of analgesics upon unacceptably high (NRS ≥ 4) and low (NRS ≤ 1) pain scores. Material and Methods. The pain protocol for patients {{in the intensive care}} unit (ICU) after cardiac surgery consisted of automated prescriptions for paracetamol and morphine, automated reminders for <b>pain</b> <b>assessments,</b> a flowchart to guide interventions upon high and low pain scores, and reassessments after unacceptable pain. Results. Paracetamol and morphine were prescribed in all 124 patients. Morphine infusion was stopped earlier than protocolized in 40 patients (32 %). During the median stay of 47 hours [IQR 26 to 74 hours], 702 / 706 (99 %) scheduled <b>pain</b> <b>assessments</b> and 218 extra pain scores were recorded. Unacceptably high pain scores accounted for 96 / 920 (10 %) and low pain scores for 546 / 920 (59 %) of all <b>assessments.</b> Upon unacceptable <b>pain</b> additional morphine was administered in 65 % (62 / 96) and reassessment took place in 15 % (14 / 96). Morphine was not tapered in 273 of 303 (90 %) eligible cases of low pain scores. Conclusions. Adherence to automated prescribed analgesics and <b>pain</b> <b>assessments</b> was good. Adherence to nonscheduled, flowchart-guided interventions was poor. Improving adherence may refine pain management and reduce side effects...|$|R

40|$|Background: Pain is {{a common}} {{postoperative}} experience. Guidelines recommend performing regular <b>pain</b> <b>assessments,</b> which include self-rated pain and additional communication to capture patients' experiences. During hospitalisation, pain intensity {{is found to be}} a vital factor influencing other aspects of an early physical recovery, and is consequently an important item in questionnaires for recovery. These tools consist of extensive questionnaires which are difficult to use in everyday clinical work. A simplified method of monitoring postoperative recovery would benefit both patients and healthcare professionals. Aim: The overall aim of this thesis was twofold: (A) to determine the ability of extending the use of pain ratings to reflect and predict early physical postoperative recovery and (B) to describe patients’ perspectives on <b>pain</b> <b>assessments.</b> Methods: The studies were carried out at one (I), three (IV) and four hospitals (II, III) involving general surgical and orthopaedic inpatients. Two quantitative methods were used based on data from questionnaires and medical records. They consisted of one cross-sectional study (I) and one study with repeated measures (IV). An association was sought between pain intensity and postoperative recovery on days 1 and 2 (I, IV), and prehospital data (IV). Two qualitative methods were used involving a phenomenographic (III) approach and Critical Incident Technique (IV), where semi-structured interviews were performed postoperatively and analysed inductively in accordance with the approach. Results: An association was found between moderate/severe average pain intensity compiled from monitoring records and impact on early physical postoperative recovery on day 1 (I). Retrospective average pain intensity at rest and during activity reflected impact on recovery on postoperative day 1 (IV). Severe pain intensity at rest and during activity on postoperative day 1 predicted impact on physical recovery items on day 2 (IV). The use of the Numeric Rating Scale (NRS 0 - 10) was considered to facilitate communication about pain, but to involve difficulties of interpretation and place demand on healthcare professionals and care routines (II). Patients’ descriptions of their experiences when in need of describing pain indicated two main areas: patients’ resources when needing to describe pain and ward resources for performing <b>pain</b> <b>assessments</b> (III). Descriptions of their actions when they were in pain indicated two main areas: patients used active strategies when needing to describe pain or patients used passive strategies when needing to describe pain (III). Conclusions: This thesis contributes to knowledge about the possibility of using patients' self-rated average pain intensity to reflect early physical postoperative recovery on day 1 and to predict recovery on the following day. The pain scale gave patients and healthcare professionals a shared vocabulary, which facilitated communication. Furthermore, dialogue during <b>pain</b> <b>assessments</b> was described as critical in ascertaining whether pain intensity had an impact on different aspects of physical recovery. Environmental factors such as the attitude of healthcare professionals, workload and staffing influenced how <b>pain</b> <b>assessments</b> were performed...|$|R

40|$|Newborns and infants {{are often}} exposed to painful {{procedures}} during hospitalization. Several different scales have been validated to assess pain in specific populations of pediatric patients, but no single scale can easily and accurately assess pain in all newborns and infants regardless of gestational age and disease state. A new pain scale was developed, the COVERS scale, which incorporates 6 physiological and behavioral measures for scoring. Newborns {{admitted to the}} Neonatal Intensive Care Unit or Well Baby Nursery were evaluated for pain/discomfort during two procedures, a heel prick and a diaper change. Pain was assessed using indicators from three previously established scales (CRIES, the Premature Infant Pain Profile, and the Neonatal Infant Pain Scale), {{as well as the}} COVERS Scale, depending upon gestational age. Premature infant testing resulted in similar <b>pain</b> <b>assessments</b> using the COVERS and PIPP scales with an r = 0. 84. For the full-term infants, the COVERS scale and NIPS scale resulted in similar <b>pain</b> <b>assessments</b> with an r = 0. 95.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare ecological and recalled <b>pain</b> intensity <b>assessments</b> over 29 days in hip and knee osteoarthritis (O) and chronic low back pain (L). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Rheumatologists were asked to enroll patients with O and L, with pain intensity above 40 mm, in a prospective study for 29 days. Pain intensity was assessed with physicians on Days 1 and 29, and ecologically, over the intervening 28 -day period, by random phone calls. RESULTS: We carried out correlation analyses for 353 (159 O, 194 L) patients: Overall recalled daily pain was strongly correlated with calculated 3 -day mean <b>pain</b> <b>assessments</b> (r= 0. 96 [O]; 0. 93 [L]) and evening pain (r= 0. 96 [O], 0. 90 [L]). Correlations between ecological and recalled measures were stronger for recall over the last 7 days than for recall over the last 28 days in osteoarthritis patients (r= 0. 78, r= 0. 63), but were similar for both recall periods in low back pain patients (r= 0. 70, r= 0. 72). Correlations between assessments for the last 7 and 28 days were stronger for ecological (r= 0. 88 [O], 0. 91 [L]) than for clinical (r= 0. 77 [O]; 0. 86 [L]) assessments. After adjustment for current pain intensity, correlations remained significant for ecological assessments, but not for clinical <b>assessments.</b> Recalled <b>pain</b> <b>assessments</b> were more accurate when made after 24 hours (r= 0. 71 [O]; 0. 70 [L]) than when made after 48 hours (r= 0. 63 [O]; 0. 61 [L]). CONCLUSIONS: For both low back pain and osteoarthritis, overall daily pain recall is a reliable measurement correlated with daily ecological measurements, whereas a rapid decrease in recall occurs after 48 hours. The most reliable period for pain recall was 7 days, but the results obtained were influenced by current pain. Peer reviewe...|$|R

40|$|Objectives Previous {{research}} has shown that sensitivity to movement-evoked pain is associated with higher scores on self-report measures of disability in individuals who have sustained whiplash injuries. However, it remains unclear whether sensitivity to movement-evoked pain is associated with work-disability. The aim {{of the present study was}} to examine the relation between sensitivity to movement-evoked pain and occupational status in individuals receiving treatment for whiplash injury. Methods A sample of 105 individuals with whiplash injuries participated in a testing session where different measures of pain (i. e. spontaneous pain, multi-site pain, sensitivity to movement-evoked pain) were collected during the performance of a simulated occupational lifting task. Results Hierarchical logistic regression analysis revealed that the measures of multisite pain and sensitivity to movement-evoked pain made significant independent contributions to the prediction of work-disability.

40|$|Across the world, pain is under-treated in {{emergency}} departments (EDs). We canvass the literature testifying to this problem, {{the reasons why}} this problem is so important, and then {{some of the main}} hypotheses that have been advanced in explanation of the problem. We then argue for the plausibility of two new hypotheses: pain’s under-treatment in the ED is due partly to (1) an epistemic preference for signs over symptoms {{on the part of some}} practitioners, and (2) some ED practices that themselves worsen pain by increasing patients’ anxiety and fear. Our argument includes the following logic. Some ED practitioners depart from formal guidance in basing their acute <b>pain</b> <b>assessments</b> on observable features rather than on patient reports of pain. This is potentially due to an epistemic preference for signs over symptoms which aims to circumvent intentional and/or unintentional misrepresentation on the part of patients. However, conducting <b>pain</b> <b>assessments</b> in line with this epistemic preference contributes to the undertreatment of pain in at least three respects, which we detail. Moreover, it may do little to help the practitioner circumvent any intentional misrepresentation on the part of the patient, as we explain. Second, we examine at least four ED practices that may be contributing to the under-treatment of pain by increasing patient anxiety and fear, which can worsen pain. These practices include failing to provide orienting information and partially objectifying patients so as to problem-solve along lines pre-established by modern medical science. We conclude by touching on some potential solutions for ED practice. Drew Carter, Paul Sendziuk, Jaklin A. Eliott, Annette Braunack-Maye...|$|R
