5|$|After the Council of Westminster, Hilary {{supported}} the king throughout the Becket dispute, and one {{factor in his}} royalist position may have been that Hilary remembered who had opposed his case against Battle Abbey, and thus refused to support the archbishop. Towards the end of 1163, Henry sent Hilary on an embassy to Becket, to <b>persuade</b> <b>the</b> archbishop to modify his position, but Becket was unmoved. Hilary also {{took part in the}} king's embassy in 1164 to Pope Alexander III and King Louis VII of France, which attempted to <b>persuade</b> <b>the</b> pope and the king of France to favour King Henry instead of Becket, and to keep Becket from finding a haven in France during his exile.|$|E
5|$|By 917, Simeon was {{preparing}} for yet another war against Byzantium.

50|$|It was {{probably}} the same Argaeus who thirty-five years later in 359 BC again appeared as a pretender to the throne. He had <b>persuaded</b> <b>the</b> Athenians to support his claim to the Macedonian throne, but Philip II, who had just succeeded to the regency of <b>the</b> kingdom, <b>persuaded</b> <b>the</b> Athenians to remain inactive.|$|R
5|$|Béla {{tried to}} <b>persuade</b> <b>the</b> Polish monarch to stop {{supporting}} the pretender. However, Boleslaw remained loyal to Boris. In the decisive battle, which was fought {{on the river}} Sajó on 22 July 1132, the Hungarian and Austrian troops defeated Boris and his allies.|$|E

Only two Halkett boats, that of Orcadian explorer John Rae, and one held in the Hudson's Bay Company Museum Collection at the Manitoba Museum are known to survive today.|$|E
