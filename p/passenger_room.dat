25|$|For 1961 the American line added a four-door station wagon, {{as well as}} a two-door {{convertible}} for {{the first}} time since 1954. It featured a power-operated folding top with roll-down door glass, rather than the fixed side-window frames of the original design. <b>Passenger</b> <b>room</b> increased from five to six.|$|E
25|$|The vehicle's inner {{structure}} {{received as}} much attention as the aerodynamics of its exterior. Fiberglass outer panels were retained, but the Sting Ray emerged with nearly twice as much steel support in its central structure as the 1958—62 Corvette. The resulting extra weight was balanced by a reduction in fiberglass thickness, so the finished product actually weighed a bit less than the old roadster. <b>Passenger</b> <b>room</b> was as good as before despite the tighter wheelbase, and the reinforcing steel girder made the cockpit both stronger and safer.|$|E
25|$|The Honda Civic Hybrid was {{introduced}} in February 2002 as a 2003 model, based on the seventh-generation Civic. The 2003 Civic Hybrid appears identical to the non-hybrid version, but delivers , a 40 percent increase compared to a conventional Civic LX sedan. Along with the conventional Civic, it received a styling update for 2004. The redesigned 2004 Toyota Prius (second generation) improved <b>passenger</b> <b>room,</b> cargo area, and power output, while increasing energy efficiency and reducing emissions. The Honda Insight first generation stopped being produced after 2006 and has a devoted base of owners. A second-generation Insight was launched in 2010. In 2004, Honda also released a hybrid version of the Accord but discontinued it in 2007, citing disappointing sales.|$|E

2500|$|For 1983, AMC {{introduced}} the new Renault Alliance, {{which was a}} much more modern, space-efficient, fuel-efficient, front-wheel-drive subcompact car than the rear-drive Spirit, with its 14-year-old platform. The Spirit was canceled as AMC released the Alliance-based Encore hatchbacks for 1984. In addition, the front-wheel drive Renault Fuego, [...] "a nicely executed sports coupe," [...] was also sold by AMC dealers {{as an alternative to}} the Spirit GT. The Fuego had distinctive styling, four <b>passenger</b> <b>room,</b> fuel economy (U.S. EPA rated at [...] on the highway), and it received good reviews in the automotive media.|$|E
2500|$|In 1996, Chevrolet ceased {{making the}} Caprice. [...] The Ford Crown Victoria {{became the most}} widely used sedan for yellow cabs in New York. In addition, yellow cab {{operators}} also used the Honda Odyssey, Isuzu Oasis, Chevrolet Venture, Ford Freestar, and Toyota Sienna minivans, which offer increased <b>passenger</b> <b>room.</b> The distinctive Checker cabs were, due to their durable construction, phased out slowly. [...] The last one was retired in July 1999, after more than 20 years in service and with nearly one million miles on its odometer. Laws since 1996 require that taxis be replaced every six years regardless of condition; this was changed to 7 years in 2015.|$|E
2500|$|The Mk3 Fabia - {{like the}} facelifted Mk5 Volkswagen Polo {{starting}} 2014 - underwent a major technical revision, being {{based on the}} PQ26 platform: a mixture of the PQ25 platform (Volkswagen Polo MK5 pre-facelift, 2009-2014) and the MQB platform, which is currently utilised by seven Volkswagen Group models. The chassis has been modified to [...] "revert back to the Fabia’s original, first-generation design" [...] by becoming 90mm wider and 30mm lower, resulting in more interior and boot space. Despite being 8mm shorter, the Mk3 Fabia still offers more <b>passenger</b> <b>room</b> due to its extended wheelbase. Simultaneously, its weight has been reduced by [...] A similar approach {{was applied to the}} styling, according to Škoda designer Marko Jevtic: [...] "It [...] has the qualities of the first Fabia, [...] We wanted its simplicity; {{we did not want to}} overload the design." ...|$|E

5000|$|The Orca was {{a concept}} car with {{aerodynamic}} 5-door fastback body by Italdesign Giugiaro, unveiled at the April 1982 Turin Motor Show; {{it was based}} on the Delta platform, with a turbocharged engine and four-wheel-drive which could be disengaged at speed.The concept's goal was to combine a highly aerodynamic shape (...) with outstanding <b>passenger</b> <b>room</b> for its size.|$|E
