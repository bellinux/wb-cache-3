40|$|We {{have studied}} {{conformational}} properties of flexible polymers partially confined to narrow pores of different size using configurational biased Monte Carlo simulations under athermal conditions. The asphericity {{of the chain}} has been studied {{as a function of}} its center of mass position along the pore axis and {{as a function of the}} degree of penetration, or fraction of confined segments. The asphericity passes through a maximum well before all segments are located inside the pore. Rather than deforming gradually, we find that at intermediate penetration degrees, where the center of mass is within distances of approximately one radius of gyration away from the <b>pore</b> entry, the <b>chain</b> part inside the pore stretches out considerably while the remaining part outside the pore is coillike ("flower conformations"). When the center of mass is located further inside the <b>pore,</b> this strong <b>chain</b> extension along the pore axis diminishes, and the average conformation becomes that of a deformed coil.

40|$|Using Grand Canonical Monte Carlo simulation, we {{have studied}} the effects of {{confinement}} on argon and methanol adsorption in graphitic cylindrical and slit <b>pores.</b> Linear <b>chain,</b> zigzag and incomplete helical packing are observed for argon adsorption in cylindrical pores. However, for methanol adsorption different features appear because the electrostatic interactions favour configurations that maximize the hydrogen bonding among methanol molecules. We have found zigzag chains with hydrogen-bonded structures for methanol adsorption in cylindrical and slit pores. To investigate how dense the adsorbed phase is and how many molecules could be packed per unit physical volume of the solid, we consider two different definitions of pore density; one based on the physical volume {{and the other on}} the accessible volume. That based on accessible volume gives a measure of the fluid density, while that based on the physical volume gives a measure of how much adsorbate can be stored per unit volume of the adsorbent. It is found that the adsorbate is denser in cylindrical pores, but that slit pores can pack more molecules per unit solid volume. We also discuss the effects on the isosteric heat of argon and methanol of pore size, pore geometry and loading...|$|R

40|$|We {{demonstrate}} {{sequential assembly}} of chemically patchy colloids such that their valence differs from stage to stage to produce hierarchical structures. For proof of concept, we employ ACB triblock spheres suspended in water, with the C middle band electrostatically repulsive. In the first assembly stage, only A-A hydrophobic attraction contributes, and discrete clusters form. They can be stored, but subsequently activated to allow B-B attractions, leading to higher-order assembly of clusters with one another. The growth dynamics, observed {{at a single}} particle level by fluorescence optical microscopy, obey the kinetics of stepwise polymerization, forming <b>chains,</b> <b>pores,</b> and networks. Between linked clusters, we identify three possible bond geometries, linear, triangular, and square, by an argument that is generalizable to other patchy colloid systems.

Biomimetic design will facilitate production of stable synthetic nanopores with defined functionality. Bacterial porins offer a good source of possible templates for such nanopores as they form stable, selective pores in lipid bilayers. Molecular dynamics simulations have been used to design simple model nanopores with permeation free energy profiles that can be made to mimic a template protein, the OprP porin, which forms pores selective for anions. In particular, we explored the effects of varying the nature of pore-lining groups on free energy profiles for phosphate and chloride ions along the pore axis and the total charge of the permeation pathway of the <b>pore.</b> Cationic side <b>chains</b> lining the model nanopore are required to model the local detail of the OprP permeation landscape, whereas the total charge contributes to its magnitude.

40|$|AbstractThe {{antianginal}} drug ranolazine, {{which combines}} inhibitory actions on rapid and sustained sodium currents with inhibition of the hERG/IKr potassium channel, shows promise as an antiarrhythmic agent. This {{study investigated the}} structural basis of hERG block by ranolazine, with lidocaine used as a low potency, structurally similar comparator. Recordings of hERG current (IhERG) were made from cell lines expressing wild-type (WT) or mutant hERG channels. Docking simulations were performed using homology models built on MthK and KvAP templates. In conventional voltage clamp, ranolazine inhibited IhERG with an IC 50 of 8. 03 μM; peak IhERG during ventricular action potential clamp was inhibited ~ 62 % at 10 μM. The IC 50 values for ranolazine inhibition of the S 620 T inactivation deficient and N 588 K attenuated inactivation mutants were respectively ~ 73 -fold and ~ 15 -fold that for WT IhERG. Mutations {{near the bottom of}} the selectivity filter (V 625 A, S 624 A, T 623 A) exhibited IC 50 s between ~ 8 and 19 -fold that for WT IhERG, whilst the Y 652 A and F 656 A S 6 mutations had IC 50 s ~ 22 -fold and 53 -fold WT controls. Low potency lidocaine was comparatively insensitive to both pore helix and S 6 mutations, but was sensitive to direction of K+ flux and particularly to loss of inactivation, with an IC 50 for S 620 T-hERG ~ 49 -fold that for WT IhERG. Docking simulations indicated that the larger size of ranolazine gives it potential for a greater range of interactions with hERG <b>pore</b> side <b>chains</b> compared to lidocaine, in particular enabling interaction of its two aromatic groups with side chains of both Y 652 and F 656. The N 588 K mutation is responsible for the SQT 1 variant of short QT syndrome and our data suggest that ranolazine is unlikely to be effective against IKr/hERG in SQT 1 patients...|$|R
40|$|Inward {{rectification}} {{induced by}} mono- and diaminoalkane application to inside-out membrane patches was studied in Kir 2. 1 (IRK 1) channels expressed in Xenopus oocytes. Both monoamines and diamines block Kir 2. 1 channels, with potency increasing as the alkyl chain length increases (from 2 to 12 methylene groups), indicating a strong hydrophobic {{interaction with the}} blocking site. For diamines, but not monoamines, increasing the alkyl chain also increases the steepness of the voltage dependence, at any concentration, from a limiting minimal value of ∼ 1. 5 (n = 2 methylene groups) to ∼ 4 (n = 10 methylene groups). These observations lead us to hypothesize that monoamines and diamines block inward rectifier K+ channels by entering deeply into a long, narrow pore, displacing K+ ions {{to the outside of}} the membrane, with this displacement of K+ ions contributing to “extra” charge movement. All monoamines are proposed to lie with the “head” amine at a fixed position in the pore, determined by electrostatic interaction, so that zδ is independent of monoamine alkyl chain length. The head amine of diamines is proposed to lie progressively further into the <b>pore</b> as alkyl <b>chain</b> length increases, thus displacing more K+ ions to the outside, resulting in charge movement (zδ) increasing with the increase in alkyl chain length...|$|R
40|$|We observe by Small Angle Neutron Scattering the {{structure}} of polystyrene chains in semi-dilute solutions confined in a model porous medium, Vycor. The size of the free chains in solution is always larger than the pore diameter, 70  Å. The use of a suitable mixture of hydrogenated and deuterated solvents and polymers enables us to measure directly the form factor of one single chain among the others. The penetration of the chains in the porous medium is almost complete for the concentration (Φ = 20 %) {{and the range of}} molecular weight (35000 < Mw < 800000) used. The radius of gyration of the confined chains is always smaller than the radius of gyration of the free chains in the equivalent bulk solution. Our measurements are in agreement with the theoretical predictions established by Daoud and de Gennes for chains confined in a cylindrical <b>pore</b> when the <b>chains</b> are entangled and laterally squeezed but remain ideal at large scale along the cylinder axis because of the screening of the excluded volume interactions (so-called regime of “semi-dilute cigars”). The values of the partition coefficient of the chains between the porous medium and the free solution and the asymptotic behavior of {{the structure}} factors indicate that polystyrene adsorbs onto the bare surface of Vycor.

40|$|Controlled-release {{formulations}} {{reduce the}} frequency of injections and better maintain plasma concentrations within the therapeutic window. Poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLG) is currently {{the most frequently used}} biodegradable polymer for this application. In {{order to be able to}} control the release rate, it is vital to know the underlying release mechanisms. A novel method for measuring the diffusion of proteins and other substances through PLG films was developed. Size-exclusion effects were seen when studying the simultaneous diffusion of human growth hormone and glucose through the PLG films. Divalent cations in the in vitro buffer, especially zinc cations, increased the rate of pore formation in PLG films. Encapsulated zinc acetate increased the effective diffusion coefficient of lysozyme through PLG films. The pore forming effect was probably due to Lewis-acid-catalyzed hydrolysis. Pore closure was increased in an in vitro buffer with low pH, when using a low-Mw PLG with a relatively low degree of hydrophobicity, or at high temperature. Pore closure may have been caused by: (i) polymer–polymer interactions driven by the hydrophobic effect, causing separation from water and rearrangement of the polymer chains, or (ii) polymer–water interactions that led to a more homogeneously swollen polymer mass, instead of distinct regions of polymer and <b>pores.</b> Polymer <b>chain</b> mobility is important in both cases. The highest porosity of PLG films was found at pH 5 – 6, probably due to rapid pore closure below and above these values and due to relatively rapid hydrolysis in this slightly acidic environment. The pH may be low during drug release due to acidic polymer degradation products and inflammatory reactions. Studies based on diffusion measurements, confocal microscopy, and scanning electron microscopy suggest that there may be considerable transport resistance inside the polymer matrix during the first stage of degradation, while the most significant transport resistance is at the surface at a later stage. Release mechanisms and processes that have been reported to govern drug release were analyzed and discussed in a review article. Diffusion through water-filled pores is the most common way in which a drug is released (in this thesis called a true release mechanism). Several processes have been found to determine the rate of drug release. Drug release is often preceded by a chain of processes, and the dominant process may change with time and space, and when a parameter is altered. This provides many ways of modifying drug release and solving specific problems during pharmaceutical development...|$|R
40|$|Ammonium {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} nitrogen sources for bacteria, fungi, and plants, but it is toxic to animals. The ammonium transport proteins (methylamine permeases/ammonium transporters/rhesus) are present in all domains of life; however, functional studies with members of this family have yielded controversial results with respect to the chemical identity (NH(4) (+) or NH(3)) of the transported species. We have solved the structure of wild-type AmtB from Escherichia coli in two crystal forms at 1. 8 - and 2. 1 -A resolution, respectively. Substrate transport occurs through a narrow mainly hydrophobic pore located at the center of each monomer of the trimeric AmtB. At the periplasmic entry, a binding site for NH(4) (+) is observed. Two phenylalanine side chains (F 107 and F 215) block access into the pore from the periplasmic side. Further into the <b>pore,</b> the side <b>chains</b> of two highly conserved histidine residues (H 168 and H 318) bridged by a H-bond lie adjacent, with their edges pointing into the cavity. These histidine residues may facilitate the deprotonation of an ammonium ion entering the pore. Adiabatic free energy calculations support the hypothesis that an electrostatic barrier between H 168 and H 318 hinders the permeation of cations but not that of the uncharged NH(3.) The structural data and energetic considerations strongly indicate that the methylamine permeases/ammonium transporters/rhesus proteins are ammonia gas channels. Interestingly, at the cytoplasmic exit of the pore, two different conformational states are observed that might be related to the inactivation mechanism by its regulatory partner...|$|R
40|$|Improper wound {{repair of}} the corneal {{epithelium}} can alter refraction of light resulting in impaired vision. We {{have shown that}} ATP is released after injury, activates purinergic receptor signaling pathways and {{plays a major role}} in wound closure. In many cells or tissues, ATP activates P 2 X 7 receptors leading to cation fluxes and cytotoxicity. The corneal epithelium is an excellent model to study the expression of both the full-length P 2 X 7 form (defined as the canonical receptor) and its truncated forms. When Ca 2 + mobilization is induced by BzATP, a P 2 X 7 agonist, it is attenuated in the presence of extracellular Mg 2 + or Zn 2 +, negligible in the absence of extracellular Ca 2 +, and inhibited by the competitive P 2 X 7 receptor inhibitor, A 438079. BzATP enhanced phosphorylation of ERK. Together these responses indicate the presence of a canonical or full-length P 2 X 7 receptor. In addition BzATP enhanced epithelial cell migration, and transfection with siRNA to the P 2 X 7 receptor reduced cell migration. Furthermore, sustained activation did not induce dye uptake indicating the presence of truncated or variant forms that lack the ability to form large <b>pores.</b> Reverse transcription-polymerase <b>chain</b> reaction and Northern blot analysis revealed a P 2 X 7 splice variant. Western blots identified a full-length and truncated form, and the expression pattern changed as cultures progressed from monolayer to stratified. Cross-linking gels demonstrated the presence of homo- and heterotrimers. We examined epithelium from age matched diabetic and non-diabetic corneas patients and detected a 4 -fold increase in P 2 X 7 mRNA from diabetic corneal epithelium compared to non-diabetic control...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} {{molecular}} topology (e. g., branch and loop structures) on the solution properties of polymers is subtle and not well characterized. Because the conformational entropy of a polymer {{depends on its}} topology, many properties are affected by it such as its size and shape, mobility, bulk-to-pore partitioning, adsorption strength on surfaces, and depletion-induced forces on colloidal surfaces. We have systematically studied the effect of molecular topology on the structure and entropic partitioning of linear, branched, hyper-branched, cyclic, and hyper-cyclic polymers in a bulk solution and in pores. Ours is the first simulation study aimed at characterizing the conformational properties of hyper-cyclic molecules. Key findings: Our results show how differences in molecular architecture {{can be used to}} partition polymers in a porous media e. g., a highly branched polymer tends to be depleted in narrow pores (smaller than the coil size) relative to a less branched chain of equal molecular weight, but this trend is reversed in wide pores. It was also found that intra-molecular crosslinking (associated with cyclic structures) is an effective way to tune the conformational entropy of a polymer; the more crosslinks a molecule has, the smaller its conformational entropy, and the easier it is to adsorb it onto attractive <b>pore</b> walls. Intra-crosslinked <b>chains</b> are thus more effective steric stabilizer of colloid particles than linear chains (which are better depleting agents). Simulations were also used to investigate the mechanism of entropic trapping for model linear and branched DNA molecules as they go from a deep channel to a shallow channel driven by an electric field. In such a system, a molecule whose radius of gyration is larger than the gap of the shallow channel tends to get temporarily trapped at its entrance. Our results show that at moderate and strong fields, longer chains escape faster than shorter ones because, in the absence of significant differences in the free energy barrier for escape, larger chains access a larger entrance area to the narrow channel; these results are in agreement with reported experimental observations...|$|R
40|$|The {{interactions}} between three small molecules, water (H 2 O), sulfur dioxide (SO 2) and acetone ((CH 3) 2 CO) with the ionic liquid (IL) 1 -octyl- 3 -methylimidazolium tetrafluoroborate, [OMIM][BF 4], have been determined using {{line of sight}} temperature programmed desorption (LOSTPD) from a gold surface. Multilayers of the IL were deposited by physical vapour deposition with multilayers of the small molecular species (adsorbed from the gas phase) at 90 K. LOSTPD was then carried out with the small molecular species desorbing first from the mixed multilayer, followed at higher temperatures by desorption of the IL from the gold surface. The IL had a high activation energy for desorption of 126 (6) kJ mol- 1. Pure acetone showed a desorption activation energy of 38 (2) kJ mol- 1, which increased to 45 - 61 kJ mol- 1 when it was pre-adsorbed below an overlying porous layer of the ionic liquid at 90 K. The stabilised acetone {{is thought to be}} associated with pores containing ionic moieties. Destabilised acetone was also observed and thought to originate from <b>pores</b> containing octyl <b>chains.</b> The quantity of stabilised acetone scaled with the amount of IL, being ≈ 1. 1 molecules per IL ion pair. SO 2 and H 2 O were co-adsorbed with the IL at 90 K leading to an intimate mixture of the two. For pure SO 2 the desorption energy was 32 (2) kJ mol- 1, which increased to 40 - 50 kJ mol- 1 for relative concentrations up to 6 SO 2 molecules per IL ion pair. For pure water the activation energies were 49 (5) kJ mol- 1 and 43 (1) kJ mol- 1 for amorphous and crystalline ice respectively. When co-adsorbed with the IL the stabilisation energies were 42 - 49 kJ mol- 1, but up to 505 water molecules per IL ion pair could be stabilised to some degree. The desorption mechanisms and the reasons for these interactions are discussed...|$|R
40|$|The {{synthesis}} and {{properties of}} metal phosphonates prepared using piperazine-based bisphosphonic acids have been investigated. The ligands N,N’-piperazinebis(methylenephosphonic acid) (H₄L), and the 2 -methyl (H₄L-Me) and 2, 5 -dimethyl (H₄L 2, 5 -diMe) derivatives {{have been prepared}} using a modified Mannich reaction. Hydrothermal reaction of gels prepared from metal (II) acetates and the bisphosphonic acids results in the synthesis of four structures: STA- 12, Ni VSB- 5, Co H₂L. H₂O and Mg H₂L. STA- 12, synthesised by reaction of Mn, Fe, Co or Ni acetate with H₄L or H₄L-Me, has been investigated further. STA- 12 crystallises in the space group R⁻₃, and Ni STA- 12 is the most crystalline version. Its structure was solved from synchrotron data (a = b = 27. 8342 (1) Å, c = 6. 2421 (3) Å, α = β = 90 °, γ = 120 °), and it has large 10 Å hexagonal shaped <b>pores.</b> Helical <b>chains</b> of Ni octahedra are coordinated by the ligands, resulting in phosphonate tetrahedra pointing towards the pore space. Water is present, both coordinated to the Ni²⁺ cations and physically adsorbed in the pores. Mixed metal structures based on Ni STA- 12, where some Ni is replaced in the gel by another divalent metal (Mg, Mn, Fe or Co) can also be synthesised. Dehydration of STA- 12 results in two types of behaviour, depending on the metal present. Rhombohedral symmetry is retained on dehydration of Mn and Fe STA- 12, the a cell parameter decreasing compared to the as-prepared structures by 2. 42 Å and 1. 64 Å respectively. Structure solution of dehydrated Mn STA- 12 indicates changes in the torsion angles of the piperazine ring bring the inorganic chains closer together. Fe and Mn STA- 12 do not adsorb N₂, which {{is thought to be}} due to the formation of an amorphous surface layer. Dehydration of Ni and Co STA- 12 causes crystallographic distortion. Three phases were isolated for Ni STA- 12 : removal of physically adsorbed water results in retention of rhombohedral symmetry, while dehydration at 323 K removes some coordinated water forming a triclinic structure. A fully dehydrated structure (dehydrated at 423 K) was solved from synchrotron data (a = 6. 03475 (5) Å, b = 14. 9156 (2) Å, c = 16. 1572 (7) Å, α = 112. 5721 (7) °, β = 95. 7025 (11) °, γ = 96. 4950 (11) °). The dehydration mechanism, followed by UV-vis and Infra-red spectroscopy, involves removal of water from the Ni²⁺ cations and full coordination of two out of three of the phosphonate tetrahedra forming three crystallographically distinct Ni and P atoms. No structural distortion takes place on dehydration of Ni and Co STA- 12 prepared using the methylated bisphosphonate, and the solids give a higher N₂ uptake as a result. Dehydrated Ni and Co STA- 12 were tested for adsorption performance for fuel related gases and probe molecules. Investigations were undertaken at low temperature with H₂, CO and CO₂, and ambient temperature with CO₂, CH₄, CH₃CN, CH₃OH and large hydrocarbons. Due to the presence of lower crystallinity, Co STA- 12 has an inferior adsorption performance to Ni STA- 12, although it has similar adsorption enthalpies for CO₂ at ambient temperature (- 30 to - 35 kJ mol⁻¹). Ni STA- 12 adsorbs similar amounts of CO₂ and N₂ at low temperature, indicating the adsorption mechanisms are similar. Also, it adsorbs 10 × more CO₂ than CH₄ at low pressure, meaning it could be used for separation applications. Ni STA- 12 adsorbs 2 mmol g⁻¹ H₂ with an enthalpy of - 7. 5 kJ mol⁻¹, the uptake being due to adsorption on only one-third of the Ni²⁺ cations. The uptake for CO is 6 mmol g⁻¹, with adsorption enthalpies ranging from - 24 to - 14 kJ mol⁻¹. This uptake is due to adsorption on all the Ni²⁺, meaning the adsorption enthalpies are high enough to allow the structure to relax. This is also observed for adsorption of CH₃CN and CH₃OH, where there is a return to rhombohedral symmetry after uptake. The adsorption sites in dehydrated Ni and Co STA- 12 were investigated via Infra-red spectroscopic analysis of adsorbed probe molecules (H₂, CO, CO₂, CH₃CN and CH₃OH). The results indicate the adsorption sites at both low and ambient temperature are the metal cations and the P=O groups. The metal cation sites are also characterised as Lewis acids with reasonable strength. STA- 12 was shown to have acidic activity for the liquid phase selective oxidations of 1 -hexene and cyclohexene, although there is evidence active sites are coordinated by products and/or solvents during the reaction. STA- 12 also demonstrates basic activity for the Knoevenagel condensation of ethyl cyanoacetate and benzaldehyde. Modification of STA- 12 by adsorption of diamine molecules causes a slight increase in the basicity, and the highest conversions are where water and diamine molecules are both present.

40|$|Tesis de Gloria Pilar Simón García de Mora. 242 p. - 71 fig. - 1 tab. Introduction Mitochondria-targeting drugs (“mitochondriotoxics”, or “mitocans”) {{represent}} an family of anticancer agents the toxicity {{of which is}} caused by direct interaction with mitochondrial structures (e. g., permeability transition <b>pore</b> (mPTP), respiratory <b>chain</b> complexes, mtDNA…etc). This enables these agents to overcome certain forms of drug resistance arising when other chemotherapeutic agents (e. g., DNA-targeting drugs) are used. In the present work we have employed arsenic trioxide (ATO, Trisenox) and lonidamine, the main (but not only) target of them being some proteins which form part or are associated to the mPTP – adenine nucleotide translocator and/or hexokinase II-. ATO is clinically used against acute promyelocytic leukaemia, where it promotes growth arrest and terminal differentiation due to disruption of the oncogenic fusion protein PML-RARα, but is also potentially useful against other haematologic diseases via apoptosis induction. Lonidamine, formerly used as anti-spermiogenic agent, is a safe, non toxic agent incorporated in clinical protocols against solid tumours, but also potentially useful in leukaemia. Nevertheless the efficacy of these agents is normally low in monotherapy, and hence the generation of sensitizing strategies is required. Natural polyphenols represent a family of hundreds of compounds present in the vegetal kingdom. Upon long-term administration at low doses (e. g., in the diet) polyphenols are antioxidants and protective agents, preventing inflammation, aging, and cancer initiation and progression. On the other hand, at high but still pharmacologically achievable concentrations, polyphenols may in some circumstance behave as prooxidants, causing cell cycle impairment, cell death, and elimination of mature tumours. Nonetheless, because of limitations in dose availability, rather than used as single agents polyphenols are better valuable as radio-or chemosensitizers {{in combination with other}} chemotherapeutic agents. The utility has been mainly demonstrated in solid tumourderived cell models and in combination with classic DNA-damaging agents, but there is less information in leukaemia cell models, and almost no information in combination with the above-mentioned mitochondriotoxic drugs. Apoptosis and necrosis are the two classic forms of cell death. Necrosis is a nonregulated form of death derived from the rapid loss of cell homeostasis, upon severe cell injury. Apoptosis, is a a regulated form of death, which may be executed following two pathways, namely the death-receptor (“extrinsic”) pathway, and the mitochondrial (“intrinsic”) pathway. The later one is normally produced by most anti-cancer agents, and likely by mitonchodria-targeting drugs. The intrinsic pathway is initiated by the permeabilization of the outer mitchondria membrane (mOMP), the release of mitochondria-located apoptogenic factors, ending in the activation of the caspase- 9 /caspase- 3 pathway. It is normally associated to pore opening at the mitochondrial inner membrane (mIMP), and hence to dissipation of intermembrane potential (m). In addition, it is regulated by multiple signalling factors, including: (a) Oxidative stress, which, depending on the intensity, may cause apoptosis or necrosis, and either produce cell death per se or facilitate the generation of cell death by other agents. Oxidative stress may be evidenced by the over-accumulation of reactive oxigen species (ROS), and/or the loss of anti-oxidant factors (e. g., reduced glutatione, GSH). (b) Alterations in protein kinase signalling pathways, such as the oxidant-sensitive, normally proapoptotic, p 38 -MAPK and JNK kinases, or the normally defensive MEK/ERK and PI 3 K/Akt pathways. (c) Alterations in the activity of the NF-κB transcription factor, which in general operates as a defensive factor. (d) Alterations in the expression heatshock proteins (HSPs), a complex family of chaperones, some of which (as Hsp- 70) functioning as an anti-apoptotic factors. Objectives The general purpose of this thesis was to investigate the capacity of selected polyphenols, with particular interest on curcumin and resveratrol, to potentiate the cytoreductive capacity of ATO and lonidamine. For this purpose we analyze cell cycle, cell death (necrosis and apoptosis), mitochondrial dysfunction (mIMP, apoptogenic protein release) and some regulatory factors (oxidative stress, protein kinases, NF-κB, Hsp- 70) which might explain the apoptotic response. Both the mitocondriotoxic drugs and phenolic agents will be normally used at sub-cytotoxic concentrations, wihin or close to the range of pharmacologically useful doses. As cell models we use the human acute myeloid (promonocytic) leukaemia U- 937 cell line, and for comparison other myeloid and lymphoid leukemia cells. Also for comparison, some DNA-targeting drugs will be used instead of the mitochondriotoxic drugs. Proyecto SAF 2010 - 20256 del MINECO y contrato (2008 - 2012) de la CAMPeer reviewe...|$|R
