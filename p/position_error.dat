25|$|An {{airspeed}} indicator is a {{differential pressure gauge}} with the pressure reading expressed in units of speed, rather than pressure. The airspeed {{is derived from the}} difference between the ram air pressure from the pitot tube, or stagnation pressure, and the static pressure. The pitot tube is mounted facing forward; the static pressure is frequently detected at static ports on one or both sides of the aircraft. Sometimes both pressure sources are combined in a single probe, a pitot-static tube. The static pressure measurement is subject to error due to inability to place the static ports at positions where the pressure is true static pressure at all airspeeds and attitudes. The correction for this error is the <b>position</b> <b>error</b> correction (PEC) and varies for different aircraft and airspeeds. Further errors of 10% or more are common if the airplane is flown in “uncoordinated” flight.|$|E
30|$|Figure  7 {{shows the}} robot arm <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> at {{different}} model placement angles. According {{to the visual}} robot’s <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> for different angles of different models, this paper calculates the <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> of visual robots for different models. The average <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> of the regular quadrilateral is 0.86  mm, the average <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> of the circular shape is 0.8  mm, and the average <b>positioning</b> <b>errors</b> for the triangle and the hexagon are 0.93  mm and 1.27  mm, respectively. The data {{results show that the}} robot system will produce different <b>positioning</b> <b>errors</b> for different shape models. The mean value of the <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> of the visual robot for the regular quadrilateral and the circle is significantly smaller than the mean value of the <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> for the triangle and the hexagon. Therefore, the use of a regular quadrilateral and circular model with low <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> rate can improve the accuracy of positioning.|$|R
30|$|Since {{computed}} tomography (CT) X-ray scanning {{is becoming a}} reality in sawmills, different studies {{have been made to}} establish how well the sawing position of a log can be optimized using CT data. It is also known that <b>positioning</b> <b>errors</b> have an adverse effect on optimization, since the optimization methods used are rather sensitive to <b>positioning</b> <b>errors.</b> To mitigate the effect of <b>positioning</b> <b>errors,</b> a method is proposed in this article that filters results produced by sawing simulation, using a Gaussian filter of a size according to the <b>positioning</b> <b>error.</b> Using these filtered values for optimization, it is possible to retain two percent extra value of the sawn timber, when rotation and offset errors are present, compared to a regular optimization method. A method more robust to <b>positioning</b> <b>errors</b> is more useful in practice, since <b>positioning</b> <b>errors</b> of various magnitudes are always present in sawmills. The main contribution of this paper is, therefore, an optimization method that reduces the effect of <b>positioning</b> <b>errors.</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{dimensional}} accuracy of machined parts mainly {{depends upon the}} positioning accuracy of machine tool slides. An adaptive and active approach of compensating <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> has been demonstrated in this paper, {{in order to bring}} down the <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> of a high precision slide of a CNC turning machine in sub micrometer range. A module has been developed for real time computation and compensation of <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> of an axis through a open architecture motion controller, using back propagation feed forward neural network. The training of neural network has been carried by mapping the <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> using a laser interferometer. Key network parameters of the trained neural network has been extracted and used in a ‘C’ program for real time computation and compensation of the <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> based on the position of the axis, by updating tool offset using global variable. The <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> of the slide has been reduced to sub micrometer range after implementation of the module in the motion controller the high precision turning machine...|$|R
25|$|In 1847, Sears C. Walker of the U.S. Naval Observatory searched {{historical}} records and surveys for possible prediscovery sightings {{of the planet}} Neptune. He found that observations made by Lalande's staff at the Paris Observatory in 1795 were {{in the direction of}} Neptune's position in the sky. In the catalog observations for May 8 and again on May 10 of 1795 a star was observed in the approximate position expected for Neptune. The uncertainty of the position was noted with a colon. This notation was also used to indicate an observation error so {{it was not until the}} original records of the observatory were reviewed that it was established with certainty that the object was Neptune and the <b>position</b> <b>error</b> in the observations made two nights apart was due to the planet's motion across the sky. The discovery of these records of Neptune's position in 1795 led to a better calculation of the planet's orbit.|$|E
500|$|Another {{class of}} {{inherent}} errors {{is that of}} <b>position</b> <b>error.</b> [...] A <b>position</b> <b>error</b> is produced by the aircraft's static pressure being different from the air pressure remote from the aircraft. [...] This error {{is caused by the}} air flowing past the static port at a speed different from the aircraft's true airspeed. [...] Position errors may provide positive or negative errors, depending on one of several factors. [...] These factors include airspeed, angle of attack, aircraft weight, acceleration, aircraft configuration, {{and in the case of}} helicopters, rotor downwash. [...] There are two categories of position errors, which are [...] "fixed errors" [...] and [...] "variable errors". [...] Fixed errors are defined as errors which are specific to a particular model of aircraft. [...] Variable errors are caused by external factors such as deformed panels obstructing the flow of air, or particular situations which may overstress the aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Aiming at {{the large}} <b>positioning</b> <b>errors</b> of {{traditional}} coal mine underground locomotive, an improved received signal strength indication (RSSI) positioning algorithm for coal mine underground locomotive was proposed. The RSSI value fluctuates heavily due to the poor environment of coal mine underground. The nodes with larger RSSI value corrected by Gaussian-weighted model were selected as beacon nodes. In {{order to reduce the}} <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> further, the estimated positions of the locomotives were corrected by the weighted distance correction method. The difference between actual position and estimated position of beacon node was regarded as the <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> and was given a corresponding weight. The results of simulation show that the positioning accuracy of Gaussian-weighted model is better than statistical average model and Gaussian model and it has a high positioning accuracy after correcting <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> correction.

40|$|In {{order to}} realize {{adaptive}} compensation for <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> of precision measurement platform, a new method {{has been proposed}} based on monitoring measurement environment and support vector regression for ensuring the high-precision of measurement platform used for optical element in different measurement environment. Firstly, a prediction model was established with the theory of support vector regression (SVR), using several group data of temperature, humidity, atmospheric pressure in different environment for predicting the maximum <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> value. Then SVR was used iteratively to predict the <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> value of any position, using both maximum <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> value and environmental factors. Finally, the <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> was input to the controller for compensation. Instruments including Renishaw laser interferometer along with temperature and humidity sensors were applied to experiments with the precision measurement platform. Experimental results indicate that, comparing the prediction data with the measured data, {{the average of the}} absolute difference is 0. 88 μm, and the Pearson's square of correlation coefficient is 0. 99. After adaptive compensation, the average of <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> decreases to 1. 4 μm from 43 μm. It concludes that this method is feasible and accurate...|$|R
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{developed}} a new feed correction mechanism which corrected not only a <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> (i. e., feed deviation) but also an angular error (i. e., yaw of a table). A correction mechanism including two piezoelectric actuators was constructed and installed between double nuts. The correction mechanism corrects <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> if both piezoelectric actuators are expanded to the same length, and corrects angular error if one piezoelectric actuator is expanded {{and the other is}} contracted. First, the <b>positioning</b> and angular <b>errors</b> correction functions were investigated separately. A load was applied {{to one side of the}} table in order to simulate a counter force during machining. In the <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> correction, a low-frequency component of <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> was corrected effectively under the condition that the load for the table was set to at least 50 N. In the angular error correction, the correction capability was comparable to that of the <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> correction up to the maximum load torque to the table, 1. 4 Nm. The load torque was limited to 1. 4 Nm because both piezoelectric actuators reached their saturation voltage. Finally, simultaneous correction of <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> and angular error was examined, and the simultaneous correction capability was confirmed to be equivalent to the separate correction capabilities...|$|R

2500|$|Long {{baseline}} systems {{get their}} {{name from the}} fact that the spacing of the baseline transponders is long or similar to the distance between the diver or vehicle and the transponders. [...] That is, the baseline transponders are typically mounted in the corners of an underwater work site within which the vehicle or diver operates. This method yields an ideal geometry for positioning, in which any given error in acoustic range measurements produce only about an equivalent <b>position</b> <b>error.</b> [...] This compares to SBL and USBL systems with shorter baselines where ranging disturbances of a given amount can result in much larger position errors. Further, the mounting of the baseline transponders on the sea floor eliminates the need for converting between reference frames, as is the case for USBL or SBL positioning systems mounted on moving vessels. Finally, sea floor mounting makes the positioning accuracy independent of water depth. [...] For these reasons LBL systems are generally applied to tasks where the required standard of positioning accuracy or reliability exceeds the capabilities of USBL and SBL systems.|$|E

30|$|When <b>positioning</b> <b>errors</b> were small, {{the naive}} method and the robust method chose the same sawing {{positions}} {{to a larger}} extent than when errors were larger. This is intuitive, since for a large <b>positioning</b> <b>error,</b> the robust method chose low risk areas of the value surfaces, while if the error was small, it chose more high risk peaks. The naive method always used the absolute maximum value, meaning that such peaks were frequently chosen regardless of how large the <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> was.|$|R
30|$|To summarize, {{it can be}} {{concluded}} that a sawing positioning method based on CT scanning that takes <b>positioning</b> <b>errors</b> into account can mitigate the effect of these errors to a large extent. Compared to a more naive method of choosing the ‘best’ <b>position</b> regardless of <b>errors,</b> it improves value yield by around two percent, {{depending on the size of}} the <b>positioning</b> <b>error.</b> Compared to sawing logs horns down and centered, it improves value yield of 4 – 11  %, also depending on the <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> size. The method is robust to errors of a rather large size, in the higher range of the measurements that has been done in the previous research. No extra hardware is required compared to the naive method, what is needed though is active work by sawmills to measure and follow up on the size and distribution of <b>positioning</b> <b>errors.</b> This build upon previous work by not only assessing the possible value gain by optimizing log sawing position, but also taking into consideration the <b>positioning</b> <b>error.</b>|$|R

40|$|AbstractPurposeTo {{analyze the}} effects of Eye-Tracker {{performance}} on the pulse <b>positioning</b> <b>errors</b> during refractive surgery. MethodsA comprehensive model, which directly considers eye movements, including saccades, vestibular, optokinetic, vergence, and miniature, as well as, eye-tracker acquisition rate, eye-tracker latency time, scanner positioning time, laser firing rate, and laser trigger delay have been developed. ResultsEye-tracker acquisition rates below 100 Hz correspond to pulse <b>positioning</b> <b>errors</b> above 1. 5 mm. Eye-tracker latency times to about 15 ms correspond to pulse <b>positioning</b> <b>errors</b> of up to 3. 5 mm. Scanner positioning times to about 9 ms correspond to pulse <b>positioning</b> <b>errors</b> of up to 2 mm. Laser firing rates faster than eye-tracker acquisition rates basically duplicate pulse-positioning errors. Laser trigger delays to about 300 μs have minor to no impact on pulse-positioning errors. ConclusionsThe proposed model {{can be used for}} comparison of laser systems used for ablation processes. Due to the pseudo-random nature of eye movements, <b>positioning</b> <b>errors</b> of single pulses are much larger than observed decentrations in the clinical settings. There is no single parameter that ‘alone’ minimizes the <b>positioning</b> <b>error.</b> It is the optimal combination of the several parameters that minimizes the error.

Compared to {{traditional}} indirect methods, direct georeferencing through a Global Positioning System/inertial navigation system requires fewer and simpler steps to obtain exterior orientation parameters of remotely sensed images.

The distribution of pixel shifts introduced by the <b>positioning</b> <b>error</b> on a satellite linear push-broom image is quantitatively analyzed. We use the variation of the object space coordinate to simulate different kinds of <b>positioning</b> <b>errors</b> and terrain topography.
