40|$|During {{pathogen}} recognition T-Cell Receptors form microclusters {{which are}} believed to be the central signalling units. These structures could hold the secret behind the exceptional sensitivity of T-Cells in distinguishing single triggering ‘agonist’ peptides against a background of thousands. We have developed a biophysical approach based on magnetic tweezers that allows us to study the players involved in these receptor clusters and their dynamics. We use antibody functionalized magnetic beads to target CD 3, a subunit of the TCR Complex to induce TCR clustering. Using magnetic tweezers, we move the beads along the cell membrane and simultaneously measure trafficking of co-receptors and proteins involved in the complex using confocal fluorescence microscopy and fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). We study co-receptor CD 6, which is considered a co-stimulator for cell activation during cluster formation. Our findings suggest that while CD 6 is not physically associated with TCR complex, it gets recruited into the TCR clusters. There it is partially immobilized and moves along as clusters are displaced. The diffusion coefficient of CD 6 is higher in bead-stimulated cells, whereas CD 6 outside clusters diffuse faster than those within clusters. We are also downscaling this method to induce formation of receptor nanoclusters, in order to explore the effects of <b>physical</b> <b>receptor</b> oligomerization on the activity of TCR and Epidermal Growth Factor Receptors...|$|E

BackgroundThe renin-angiotensin and endothelin systems interact to regulate blood pressure, in part, by affecting sodium transport in the kidney. Because angiotensin II type 1 (AT 1) receptor activation increases ETB receptor expression in renal proximal tubule cells from Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rat, we hypothesize that ETB receptor activation may also regulate AT 1 receptor expression. Furthermore, ETB receptor {{regulation of the}} AT 1 receptor may be different in the WKY and spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR). MethodAT 1 and ETB receptors were studied in immortalized renal proximal tubule cells from WKY and SHRs, using immunoblotting, confocal microscopic colocalization, and immunoprecipitation. ResultsIn WKY renal proximal tubule cells, an ETB receptor agonist, BQ 3020, decreased AT 1 receptor protein in a time- and concentration-dependent manner [median effective concentration (EC 50) = 3. 2 × 10 - 10 mol/L, t 1 / 2 = 15 hours]. The inhibitory effect of BQ 3020 (10 - 8 mol/L/ 24 hours) on AT 1 receptor protein was blocked by an ETB receptor antagonist (BQ 788). However, BQ 3020 (10 - 8 mol/L/ 24 hours) increased ETB receptor protein in WKY renal proximal tubule cells. In contrast, in SHR renal proximal tubule cells, BQ 3020 (10 - 8 mol/L/ 24 hours) no longer affected AT 1 or ETB receptor protein. AT 1 /ETB receptors colocalized and coimmunoprecipitated in WKY and SHRs. BQ 3020 (10 - 8 mol/L/ 15 minutes) treatment {{had no effect on}} AT 1 /ETB coimmunoprecipitation in WKY but decreased it in SHRs. BQ 3020 (10 - 8 mol/L/ 15 minutes) treatment increased AT 1 receptor phosphorylation in WKY, but decreased it in SHRs.

Lethal removal of targeted individuals reduces the immediate threat, but other approaches should {{be integrated into}} control programs {{to make them more}} effective and to help meet legal and ethical considerations (Dolbeer et al. 1995). When negative media attention, special in terest groups, or calls for restrictive legislation influence public opinion, the resulting public pressure can preclude effective wildlife management and lead to subsequent population control problems (Torres et al. 1996, Coolahan and Snider 1998, Conover 2001). Nonlethal management activities to reduce wildlife use of airports may include habitat modifi cation, exclusion from roosting and nesting areas, and repelling animals from desired locations. When considering repellents alone, there are many that are untested, temporarily effective, or cost-prohibitive (Dol beer et al. 1995). Effective nonlethal repellents must affect some aspect of <b>physical</b> <b>receptors</b> or psychological perception of the intended targeted animals.

Sources of atmospheric particles at Station Nord (81 ° 36 ' N, 16 ° 40 ' W) in North East Greenland were evaluated for a two-year period from March 2008 to February 2010. Source apportionment using Positive Matrix Factorization (PMF) and COnstrained <b>Physical</b> <b>Receptor</b> Model (COPREM) was based on measurements of black carbon, elements (Al, Si, S, K, Ca, Ti, V, Cr, Mn, Fe, Ni, Cu, Zn, Ga, As, Se, Br, Rb, Sr, Zr, Pb) and inorganic ions (SO 2, SO 4 2 −, Na +, NH 4 +, NO 3 −, Cl −). In general, source apportionment results by PMF and COPREM showed good agreement. Five sources adequately explained the measurements, which included a Marine and a Soil source of natural origin and three additional anthropogenic sources, which were all influenced by metal industries. One anthropogenic source was dominated by Zn of which air mass back trajectories using the Hybrid Single Particle Lagrangian Integrated Trajectory (HYSPLIT) model suggested a Canadian Arctic origin, despite certain influences from southern and eastern origins. Another anthropogenic source was characterised by high concentrations of Pb and As, which has been historically referred to as a Combustion source at Station Nord. The impacts of large-scale industry in Siberia, Russia were evident through high Cu concentrations in both the Combustion source and an additional Cu/Ni source. Br correlated well with the anthropogenic species S and Pb though the elements are unlikely to have a common origin. More likely, sulphuric acid aerosols serve as transport containers for Br species of marine or local origin.

Results are presented on the source apportionment of PM 10 and B(a) P during two episodes of thermal inversion (14 / 1; 2 / 3, 2005) at four different air monitoring stations and four apartments (indoor) in the city of Krakow, The results are compared to the Zakopane mountain site selected due to its prominent domestic coal heating and little traffic. The source apportionment was based on receptor modeling of the total of 72 ambient PM samples and 21 individual PM sources, chemically characterised for a high number of organic and inorganic compounds including polyaromatics (15 PAH and 18 azaarenes) heavy metals and trace elements (28 compounds), major ions, soot and organic carbon. An array of multivariate receptor models was used i. e. chemical mass balance (CMB), constrained matrix factorisation (CMF), constrained <b>physical</b> <b>receptor</b> modelling (COPREM) positive matrix factorization (PMF), principle component analysis with multi-linear regression analysis (PCA-MLRA), edge analysis (UNMIX), cluster analysis (CA), and self organizing maps SOM). The variation in the receptor dataset (55 compounds, 60 outdoor and 12 indoor PM samples) allowed the models of the pure factor analysis type (PMF, UNMIX, PCA-MLRA) to identify 3 - 5 factors of mixed sources. The interpretation of the factors was not straightforward, but pointed to a dominating primary source contribution from coal combustion (> 60 %) and a minor contribution from traffic (< 10 %). The secondary PM sources (20 - 30 %) comprised industry and traffic. The results of cluster analysis and self organizing maps supported these indications. PMF was able to disaggregate the coal combustion into three factors i. e. ~ 10 % related to industrial activities, ~ 20 % related to home heating by stoves (coal) and ~ 30 % related to boilers. The chemical fingerprints of the receptor samples and the main PM sources in Krakow and Zakopane allowed the pure chemical mass balance; type model (EPA-CMB 8. 2) to estimate the major contributions from two primary source types i. e. residential heating by coal combustion in small stoves and low efficiency boilers (~ 45 %) and boilers with rudimentary PM reductions techniques such as cyclones (~ 15 %), one major secondary source deriving from industrial and traffic emissions of SO 2 + NOx + possibly HCl (~ 20 %). Five minor primary sources were also identified i. e. traffic 5 %, biomass burning ~ 5 %, coke/fuel combustion ~ 5 %, industrial high efficiency coal combustion 3 %, and road/salt/rock re-suspension ~ 2 %. The indoor PM 10 and B(a) P were found to have the same sources as outdoor PM 10 and B(a) P The results obtained by the models CMF and COPREM - which are hybrids of factor analysis and chemical mass balance generally agreed with the CMB results. However, their source contribution estimates are slightly different: residential heating ~ 30 %, boilers with rudimentary PM reductions techniques such as cyclones ~ 30 %, industrial high efficiency coal combustion ~ 15 % traffic 3 - 7 %, secondary 13 - 21 %, road/salt/rock re-suspension 2 - 8 %.

The architect works with form and space consisting solids and void just as a sculpture who work with form and mass and also like the painter who works with colors The person who experience the architecture enjoys a symphony of a composer or get the taste of a soup cooked by a master chef. As discussed above the architectural space consists of solids and voids The void spaces are connected to each other forming a sequenced progression. This sculpture of composite totality made out of solids and voids determines space to live in. " Photography" {{plays a major role in}} determining the characteristic expressions of the space.

This interaction demands several essential components. • The intensity of expressiveness, clarity and legibility. • The medium of the expression • The ability of the recipient to capture the essence of it. • The personal perception Varity of art forms express through different media.

Although the biochemical pathways governing early B cell signaling have been well studied, the role of the physical properties of antigens, such as antigen mobility, has not been fully examined. We study the interaction of B cells with BCR ligands coated on glass or tethered to planar lipid bilayer surfaces to investigate the differences in B cell response to immobile and mobile ligands. Using high-resolution total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy of live cells, we followed the movement and spatial organization of BCR clusters and the associated signaling. Although ligands on either surface were able to cross-link BCRs and induce clustering, B cells interacting with mobile ligands displayed greater signaling than those interacting with immobile ligands. Quantitative analysis revealed that mobile ligands enabled BCR clusters to move farther and merge more efficiently than immobile ligands. These differences in <b>physical</b> reorganization of <b>receptor</b> clusters were associated with differences in actin remodeling.

In addition, torpedo mutations exhibit interallelic complementation. Molecular analysis of 24 loss-of-function mutations in the torpedo gene provides insights into the mechanistic basis of its genetic complexity.

Surprisingly, deletions did not alter the efficiency of coupling of the beta 2 AR to Gsalpha as assessed by GTP[S]-sensitive high-affinity agonist binding. Moreover, basal and ligand-regulated AC activities in membranes expressing beta 2 AR(Delta 70) Gsalpha and beta 2 AR(Delta 26) Gsalpha were higher than in membranes expressing beta 2 ARGsalpha.

Interspecifi c aggressiveness in rats has been studied considering the mouse-killing behavior; the neonatal androgenization of females increases adult mousekilling as does the administration of testosterone in adults. Intraspecifi c aggressiveness was studied by putting two or more male rats (or mice) in the same cage; the condition of subjection or dominance is infl uenced by testosterone. In monkeys, testosterone is related to aggressiveness and dominance and, during the mating season, increases in testosterone levels and aggressive attitude are observed.

40|$|Abstract: Endothelin- 1 (ET- 1) is a {{vasoconstrictor}} secreted by endothelial cells, {{which acts}} as the natural counterpart of the vasodilator nitric oxide (NO). ET- 1 contributes to vascular tone and regulates cell proliferation through activation of ETA and ETB <b>receptors.</b> <b>Physical</b> factors such as shear stress, or stimuli including thrombin, epinephrine, angiotensin II, growth factors, cytokines and free radicals enhance secretion of ET- 1. By contrast, mediators like nitric oxide (NO), cyclic GMP, atrial natriuretic peptide, and prostacyclin reduce the release of endogenous ET- 1. Thus, under normal conditions, {{the effects of the}} ET- 1 are carefully regulated through inhibition or stimulation of ET- 1 release from endothelium. Endothelial dysfunction is one of the earliest landmarks of vascular abnormalities. Altered function of endothelium may result from absolute decrease in bioavailability of NO as well as from relative augment in ET- 1 synthesis, release or activity. Imbalance in the production of vasodilator and vasoconstrictor agents may contribute to the onset of hemodynamic disorders. Since dysregulation of the endothelin system is important in the pathogenesis of several cardiovascular diseases, the ETA and ETB receptors are attractive therapeutic targets for disorders associated with elevated ET- 1 levels. ET receptor antagonists may be regarded as disease-modifying agents thanks to their ability to preserve endothelial integrity when the endothelin system is overactive. This review summarizes the current knowledge on the role of ET- 1 in experimental hypertension and describes recent findings on the involvement of MAPK signalling pathways in ET- 1 release in hypertension associated with insulin resistance. Moreover, therapeutic applications of ET- 1 receptor blockers are also discussed...|$|R

Pre-beta-VLDL from dys-beta subjects were larger (27 vs. 17 x 10 (6) D) and more triglyceride rich (68 vs. 43 % dry weight) than beta-VLDL. Pre-beta-VLDL predominated in the Sf greater than 100 flotation fraction, whereas beta-VLDL predominated in the Sf 20 - 60 fraction. Because lipolysis converts large VLDL (Sf greater than 100) in vivo to smaller, more cholesteryl ester-rich VLDL (Sf 20 - 60), it is likely that pre-beta-VLDL are precursors of beta-VLDL. Although beta-VLDL were not found in type V hyperlipidemic E 3 / 3 subjects, they were induced by intravenous heparinization, suggesting that lipolysis of pre-beta-VLDL in vivo can result in beta-VLDL formation. Similarly, heparinization of a dys-beta subject produced more beta-VLDL, at the expense of pre-beta-VLDL. The pre-beta-VLDL from normolipidemic and type V hyperlipidemic E 3 / 3 subjects, respectively, had 90 and 280 times the affinity for the apo-B,E(LDL) receptor than did the pre-beta-VLDL from dys-beta subjects. Heparin-induced beta-VLDL from type V hyperlipidemic subjects had a sixfold higher binding affinity than did heparin-induced beta-VLDL from dys-beta subjects. These data suggest that pre-beta-VLDL from E 2 / 2 subjects interact poorly with lipoprotein receptors in vivo, decreasing their receptor-mediated clearance and increasing their conversion to beta-VLDL during lipolytic processing...|$|R

The exact mechanisms causing cough in IPF remain unclear, however {{there is evidence that}} altered cough neurophysiology and sensitisation plays a roleY IPF patients have an enhanced cough reflex sensitivity to the inhalation of capsaicin. It was hypothesised that IPF patients have increased airway expression of the capsaicin receptor TRPVF 1 and a coFexpressed receptor TRPAF 1. Bronchial biopsies were obtained in 16 IPF patients, 11 chronic cough patients and 8 controls. Quantitative PCR was used to detect TRPVF 1 and TRPAF 1 gene expression, with immunohistochemistry demonstrating protein expression. Mean TRPVF 1 and TRPAF 1 gene expression was higher in IPF patients compared with controls, but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Immunostaining supported these findings. Gastroesophageal reflux is common in IPF patients and has also been implicated. An inFvitro study using cultured pulmonary epithelial cells was conducted to assess the expression of these receptors in a cell model of gastric reflux. TRPVF 1 and TRPAF 1 gene expression was demonstrated in pulmonary epithelial cells of bronchial and alveolar origin. No significant difference in receptor expression level was seen in either cell line when exposed to the major constituents of gastric refluxate. This study suggests that a structural upFregulation of central airway TRP receptors is not the key mechanism for cough in IPF patients. Similarly, it does not support the role of the individual constituents of gastric refluxate resulting in cough hypersensitivity through a <b>physical</b> upFregulation of <b>receptors</b> in pulmonary epithelial cells.

To further investigate this phenomenon, we have compared the rates of internalization and recycling between wild-type and Gα s -fused β 2 AR. Results The rate of agonist-induced internalization, measured as the disappearance of cell surface immunofluorescence in HEK 293 cells permanently expressing N-terminus tagged receptors, was reduced three-fold by receptor-G protein fusion. However, both fused and non-fused receptors translocated to the same endocytic compartment, as determined by dual-label confocal analysis of cells co-expressing both proteins and transferrin co-localization. Receptor recycling, determined as the reversion of surface immunofluorescence following the addition of antagonist to cells that were previously exposed to agonist, markedly differed between wild-type and fused receptors. While most of the internalized β 2 AR returned rapidly to the plasma membrane, β 2 AR-Gα s did not recycle, and the observed slow recovery for the fusion protein immunofluorescence was entirely accounted for by protein synthesis. Conclusion The covalent linkage between β 2 AR and Gα s {{does not appear to}} alter the initial endocytic translocation of the two proteins, although there is reduced efficiency. It does, however, completely disrupt the process of receptor and G protein recycling. We conclude that the <b>physical</b> separation between <b>receptor</b> and Gα is not necessary for the transit to early endosomes, but is an essential requirement for the correct post-endocytic sorting and recycling of the two proteins. </p...|$|R
40|$|VEGF {{regulation}} of endothelial {{nitric oxide synthase}} in glomerular endothelial cells. BackgroundVascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) {{regulation of}} endothelial nitric oxide synthase (eNOS) and signaling pathways involved have not been well studied in glomerular endothelial cells (GENCs). MethodsGENCs grown from tsA 58 Immortomice® were used. Immunoblotting and in-cell Western blot analysis were employed to assess changes in VEGF receptor signaling pathway and eNOS phosphorylation of ser 1177. Immunokinase assay and immunoblotting with phosphospecific antibodies were performed to assess activity of kinases. ResultsVEGF rapidly induced tyrosine phosphorylation of type 1 and type 2 VEGF <b>receptors.</b> <b>Physical</b> association between VEGF-receptor 2 (VEGF-R 2) and insulin receptor substrate (IRS- 1) and phosphatidylinositol 3 ′-kinase (PI 3 K) was induced by VEGF, which augmented PI 3 K activity in VEGF-R 2 immunoprecipitates. VEGF stimulated Akt phosphorylation in a PI 3 K-dependent manner. VEGF increased eNOS phosphorylation on Ser 1177. Activation of eNOS was associated with nitric oxide generation as measured by medium nitrite content. Signaling mechanisms involved in VEGF stimulation of eNOS were explored. VEGF-induced eNOS phosphorylation was abolished by SU 1498, a VEGF-R 2 inhibitor, LY 294002, a PI 3 K inhibitor, and infection of cells with an adenovirus carrying a dominant negative-mutant of Akt, demonstrating the requirement of the VEGF-R 2 /IRS- 1 /PI 3 K/Akt axis for activation of eNOS. VEGF also activated extracellular signal-regulated protein kinase (ERK) in a time-dependent manner; and VEGF-stimulated eNOS phosphorylation on Ser 1177 was prevented by PD 098059, an upstream inhibitor of ERK, demonstrating that ERK was involved in VEGF regulation of eNOS. ERK phosphorylation was abolished by LY 294002, suggesting ERK was downstream of PI 3 K in VEGF-treated GENC. ConclusionsOur data demonstrate that in GENC, VEGF stimulates VEGF-R 2 /IRS- 1 /PI 3 K/Akt axis to regulate eNOS phosphorylation on Ser 1177 {{in conjunction with the}} ERK signaling pathway...|$|R
40|$|The studies {{presented}} in this thesis were designed to investigate the effects of reduced sea water pH on the behaviour of intertidal decapod crustaceans, both {{within the context of}} the variations occurring naturally in the pH of rock pool habitats, and in relation to predicted changes to ocean pH resulting from ocean acidification and potential carbon dioxide (CO 2) leaks from carbon capture storage (CCS) sites. Recent studies on marine fish have shown behavioural disruptions as a result of increased CO 2 concentrations in sea water and reduced pH, but the effects on crustaceans are as yet unknown. The first two studies investigated the effects of reduced pH upon the olfactory behaviour of the prawn Palaemon elegans and the hermit crab Pagurus bernhardus, focussing on their responses to food odours. Short-term (five day) exposures to highly reduced pH (pHNBS = 6. 60, 6. 80) revealed disruptions to the chemo-sensory behaviour of both species with a reduction in their ‘sniffing’ response, and the inability of P. bernhardus to locate the chemical cue. This was also accompanied by elevated haemolymph chloride ions. in In a further study P. bernhardus was subjected to a longer exposure (60 days) and to a range of pH levels (pHNBS = 8. 00, 7. 90, 7. 70, 7. 35 and 6. 80) in order to detect a threshold for the behavioural disruptions observed, and to determine if there would be any sign of acclimation over a longer period. A clear gradient in the disruptions to the chemo-sensory responses and survival rates of the hermit crabs, and disruption to a physiological marker (elevated haemolymph calcium ions), was found. Possible thresholds for disruption were also identified at levels that match predictions for ocean acidification and leaks from proposed CO 2 CCS sites. Some of the crabs in the lower pH treatments exhibited a recovery in their responses by day 60, possibly indicating an acclimation effect. The presence of disruption to haemolymph ion concentrations in both the short and longer term hermit crab studies suggest a mechanism for behavioural disruption. In a final study the effects of reduced sea water pH on a more complex behaviour, involving decision making, was investigated. Reduced sea water pH was shown to disrupt the shell assessment and selection behaviour of P. bernhardus affecting its decision making processes, although not all crabs were affected in the same way. The work presented here therefore demonstrates that reduced sea water pH could have disruptive effects upon both information gathering, via chemo-sensory processes, and decision making in intertidal crustaceans. The mechanism responsible is unlikely to be due to changes in the odour molecule, or <b>physical</b> damage to <b>receptor</b> organs. Rather the observed disruptions could be due (a) to ionic changes, causing metabolic depression or interference with neurotransmitter function, or (b) to disruption to chemoreception per se. Such disturbances to key behavioural processes have implications for inter and intraspecific species interactions and population dynamics in the marine environment. Changes in pH are already experienced by intertidal animals for short periods when rock pools are emersed, but future anthropogencially-induced reductions in sea water pH are likely to cause more sustained and widespread disruptions with, as yet, unpredictable consequences. The differential responses observed between individuals in these studies may warrant further investigation as such differences may provide the basis for selection and adaptation to projected changes in ocean pH.
