5|$|Following their {{review of}} {{parliamentary}} representation in Cambridgeshire in 2005, the Boundary Commission for England made minor alterations {{to the existing}} constituencies to deal with <b>population</b> <b>changes.</b> The electoral wards used to create the modified Peterborough constituency fought at the 2010 general election and the 2015 general election were: Bretton North, Bretton South, Central, Dogsthorpe, East, Eye and Thorney, Newborough, North, Park, Paston, Ravensthorpe, Walton, Werrington North, Werrington South, and West. These changes increased the electorate from 64,893 to 70,640. On the enumeration date of 17 February 2000, the electoral quota for England was 69,934 voters per constituency.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT <b>Population</b> <b>change</b> {{has been}} studied {{in the fields of}} human ecology, {{population}} geog-raphy, environmental sociology, transportation planning, and regional economics, which make unique contributions to theorizing and modeling <b>population</b> <b>change.</b> Drawing upon this diverse literature, we develop an integrated framework for understanding <b>population</b> <b>change</b> in this review paper. The proposed framework is composed of five putative influences (demographic characteristics, socio-economic conditions, transportation accessibility, natural amenities, and land development) analyzed across three dimensions—these influential factors of <b>population</b> <b>change</b> conditioned by spatial dynam-ics and temporal variation. We also proposed a practical procedure for tackling the complexity between <b>population</b> <b>change</b> and influential factors. This integrated framework has potential to complement existing population research approaches employed within individual disciplines. P opulation growth (or decline) is an important pursuit in the fields of demo-graphy, human ecology, population geography, environmental sociology, transportation planning, and regional economics. These fields adopt different theories to explain, and employ different approaches to model, <b>population</b> <b>change.</b> For example, human ecologists model <b>population</b> <b>change</b> within a holistic human-society-environment framework (Poston and Frisbie 2006).

5|$|The {{demographic}} {{history of}} Scotland includes {{all aspects of}} population history {{in what is now}} Scotland. Scotland may have been first occupied in the last interglacial period (130,000–70,000 BCE), but the earliest surviving archaeological evidence of human settlement is of Mesolithic hunter-gatherer encampments. These suggest a highly mobile boat-using people, probably with a very low density of population. Neolithic farming brought permanent settlements dating from 3500 BCE, and greater concentrations of population. Evidence of hillforts and other buildings suggest a growing settled <b>population.</b> <b>Changes</b> in the scale of woodland indicates that the Roman invasions from the first century CE had a negative impact on the native population.|$|E
5|$|The name Diane was {{retired from}} the Atlantic {{hurricane}} naming list. Due to the damage from hurricanes in 1954 and 1955, including Diane, public outcry over storm damage {{led to the creation}} of the National Hurricane Center in 1956. Using a monetary deflator in 2010 United States dollars, the damage from Diane would be about $7.4billion, which would have been the 17th highest in the United States. Accounting for inflation, changes in personal wealth, and <b>population</b> <b>changes,</b> it is estimated Diane would have caused $18billion in damage in 2010, or the 15th highest for a United States hurricane.|$|E
5|$|According to {{the hearth}} tax returns of 1664, the {{township}} of Sale had {{a population of}} about 365. Parish registers show that the area experienced steady population growth during the 17th and 18th centuries, more so during {{the latter half of the}} 19th century (due to the Industrial Revolution). This later growth was less rapid than that seen in neighbouring areas such as Altrincham, Bowdon or Stretford. The increase in growth in the latter half of the 19th century also coincides with the arrival of the railway, indicative of Sale's growth as a commuter town. A huge increase in population in 1921–1931 is accounted for by the administrative merger of Sale with Ashton upon Mersey in 1930. Steady growth thereon is evident until 1981, when the decline of industry in Trafford and the Greater Manchester area accounts for a reduction in the town's population. This follows the general population trend for Greater Manchester, with residents relocating to new jobs. The table below details <b>population</b> <b>changes</b> since 1801, including the percentage change since the last census.|$|E

40|$|There is {{evidence}} that mortality rates are highest {{in areas that are}} experiencing population decline, and researchers have recommended that this should be accounted for in health resource allocation.

40|$|Many regions {{across the}} European Union, {{including}} {{regions in the}} Netherlands, face population decline, entailing changing demographics and related social and economic implications. This paper looks into the connection between <b>population</b> <b>change</b> and structure, and rates of new firm formation. Although {{it is clear that}} fewer people will eventually lead to fewer firms, as well as fewer new firms, it is assessed whether this negative relationship differs with the intensity of <b>population</b> <b>change</b> and across regional contexts. In order to establish the impact of <b>population</b> <b>change</b> on new firm formation, this paper examines data on population density, size, growth and decline, together with firm dynamics for the period 2003 – 09. The results show that the relationship between new firm formation and <b>population</b> <b>change</b> depends heavily on the regional context. The results indicate that new firm formation in urban regions tends to be negatively influenced by <b>population</b> <b>change,</b> while the impact in rural regions remains positive. In conclusion, clear differences are found in the intensity of the impact of <b>population</b> <b>change</b> on new firm formation according to the type of region. The regional context and the intensity of decline {{must be taken into account}} when determining the kind of coping mechanism needed to deal with the consequences of decline...|$|R

40|$|Local governments need {{population}} estimates {{in order}} to draw a portrait of <b>population</b> <b>change,</b> {{an integral part of}} assessing needs, and developing policies and programs that serve local residents. The U. S.

This method assumes that post-census <b>population</b> <b>change</b> can be closely approximated by administrative data on births and deaths, along with other data that are symptomatic of migration.
