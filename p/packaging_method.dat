2500|$|Special {{effort has}} been made to build {{accessibility}} features into digital projection systems (see digital cinema). Through SMPTE, standards now exist that dictate how open and closed captions, as well as hearing-impaired and visually impaired narrative audio, are packaged {{with the rest of the}} digital movie. This eliminates the proprietary caption distributions required for film, and the associated royalties. SMPTE has also standardized the communication of closed caption content between the digital cinema server and 3rd-party closed caption systems (the CSP/RPL protocol). As a result, new, competitive closed caption systems for digital cinema are now emerging that will work with any standards-compliant digital cinema server. These newer closed caption devices include cupholder-mounted electronic displays and wireless glasses which display caption text in front of the wearer's eyes. [...] Bridge devices are also available to enable the use of Rear Window systems. As of mid-2010, the remaining challenge to the wide introduction of accessibility in digital cinema is the industry-wide transition to SMPTE DCP, the standardized <b>packaging</b> <b>method</b> for very high quality, secure distribution of digital movies.|$|E

50|$|The 68020 had 32-bit {{internal}} and external data and address buses, compared to the early 680x0 models with 16-bit data and 24-bit address buses.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a survey of}} <b>packaging</b> <b>methods</b> applied to multiple satellites launched on a single launch vehicle. The launch vehicle is a significant expense in most satellite programs and can equal or exceed the payload costs. Efficiency is achieved by fully utilizing launch vehicle payload capacity and by using larger, lower cost per mass to orbit boosters. A single launcher placing several satellites on orbit saves time and money. The economies of scale gained by launching several payloads from a single launch vehicle creates a need for innovative <b>packaging</b> and separation <b>methods</b> which are reliable, adaptable, and lightweight. A group of small satellites can be packaged on a single launcher in many ways. <b>Packaging</b> <b>methods</b> {{are influenced by the}} structure of the satellites (and vice versa), reliability, the number of satellites to be launched, space debris p, and development 2 ̆ 6 manufacturing costs. Several different packaging structures are presented including a variety of stacking methods and hold down structures.

5000|$|Packaging {{methods have}} changed since the {{introduction}} of the LP record. The 'wrap-around' or 'flipback' sleeve initially became the standard <b>packaging</b> <b>method</b> for LPs during the 1950s. In this <b>packaging</b> <b>method</b> the front cover is able to be printed in colour and is laminated, whereas the back cover features only black text on a white background and is usually unlaminated. These sleeves are constructed in two parts: a laminated front section is wrapped around a separate back panel. Three 'flaps' are used to fix the front and back panels together on the outside. As the unlaminated cardboard back cover section is prone to discolouration due to exposure to natural light, in some instances a single printed sheet containing the back cover information is pasted over the entire back panel, covering the 'wrap-around' flaps but not reaching {{the outer edge of the}} sleeve, thus allowing some of the laminated 'flaps' to be exposed. While discolouration still occurs with this method, it is often less evident than when the cardboard back cover alone is exposed. A common feature of flipback sleeves in the 1960s was for information specific to either monaural or stereo versions of the record (typically a format-specific catalogue number and a [...] "MONO" [...] or [...] "STEREO" [...] disclaimer) would be printed on the same front cover artwork, and the whole front panel shifted up or down to expose the appropriate [...] "version" [...] on the front while the unused one would be covered up (but often not very well) by the back cover panel.|$|E
