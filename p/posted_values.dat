A number of papers have shown that underpricing {{is directly related to}} the amount of ex ante uncertainty concerning the IPOs valuation. Recent theoretical papers propose that not all value uncertainty is resolved prior to the start of trading, but rather continues to be resolved in the beginning of the after market. We term this type of uncertainty as ex <b>post</b> <b>value</b> uncertainty and develop proxies for it. We find strong support for the existence of ex <b>post</b> <b>value</b> uncertainty and find that including a proxy for it more than doubles the explanatory power of previous models.

40|$|Objectives: The {{purpose of}} this {{investigation}} was to study the effect of 8 -week Yogic practices on hematological variables and lipid profile of university level sports persons. Methods: Pretest and posttest design was used. Experimental group (N = 10) allowed to undergo yogic practices for 8 weeks (six days a week), while control group (N = 10) maintained their daily routine activities. The selected Hematological variables that is White Blood Cells and Red Blood Cells and Lipid profile that is High Density Lipoprotein and Low Density Lipoprotein were examined by laboratory tests. For the analysis of data paired ‘t’ test was applied. Findings: There was insignificant reduction of white blood cells in experimental group [pretest value (8. 69 x 109 /L) and <b>posttest</b> <b>value</b> (8. 66 x 109 /L) ], but the numbers of red blood cells has significantly improved in experimental group [pretest value (4. 46 x 1012 /L) and <b>posttest</b> <b>value</b> (4. 59 x 1012 /L) ] after 8 week yogic training (P< 0. 05). With the yogic practices high density lipoprotein has also significantly improved in experimental group [pretest value (37 mg/dl) and <b>posttest</b> <b>value</b> (55. 40 mg/dl) ] at (P< 0. 05). The low density lipoprotein has shown significant decrease in experimental group [pretest value (98. 50 mg/dl) and <b>posttest</b> <b>value</b> (89. 30 mg/dl) ] after 8 week yogic training (P< 0. 05.) From the results, it can be predicted that, yoga practice is a cost-effective method which can be helpful to improve performance in sportsperson, especially in endurance sports. Conclusion: These results demonstrate that yogic practices enhance the Red blood cells and high density lipoprotein level and help to decrease the low density lipoprotein level among the sportsmen. *Author for correspondenc...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relative importance}} of earnings and operating cash flows in equity valuation. In contrast to previous studies that use stock returns or future operating cash flows, we use ex <b>post</b> intrinsic <b>value</b> of equity as the criterion for comparison. Ex <b>post</b> intrinsic <b>value</b> of equity is determined adopting both the discounted dividend and residual income models with ex post (future) realizations of dividends/residual income over three- and five-year horizons as inputs. The advantage of using the ex post intrinsic measure is that this measure is not contaminated by the stock markets fixation on reported earnings (Sloan, 1996). Also, unlike future operating cash flows, ex <b>post</b> intrinsic <b>value</b> is a formal and comprehensive measure of the fundamental value of the firms equity. Our findings unambiguously indicate that accrual-based earnings dominates operating cash flows as a summary indicator of ex <b>post</b> intrinsic <b>value.</b> Key words: Earnings, Cash flows, Intrinsic value.

We tested {{the effects of a}} school-based program to improve students' diet and physical activity behavior at school. METHODS: Two of the four elementary schools in one Texas school district were assigned to intervention and two to control conditions. The three intervention components were classroom health education, vigorous physical education, and lower fat, lower sodium school lunches. Nutrients from school lunches and the total day and the amount of physical activity students obtained during physical education were assessed as outcome. RESULTS: Analysis of school lunches showed declines from base line to posttest in the two intervention schools of 15. 5 % and 10. 4 % for total fat, 31. 7 % and 18. 8 % for saturated fat, and 40. 2 % and 53. 6 % for sodium; <b>posttest</b> <b>values</b> were lower in the intervention schools. Observation of physical activity during physical education classes indicated an increase in the intervention schools from baseline to posttest in the percent of time children engaged in moderate-to-vigorous physical activity from less than 10 % of class time at baseline to about 40 % of class time at posttest; <b>posttest</b> <b>values</b> were higher in the intervention schools than in the control schools.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the effectiveness of active (12 min submaximal running and 8 min of static stretching) and passive recovery (20 min sitting on a bench) interventions performed immediately after a training session on anaerobic performances (CMJ, 20 m sprint and Balsom agility test) and lower limb flexibility 24 h after the training. During two experimental sessions, 31 professional soccer players participated in a randomized fully controlled trial design. The first session was designed to evaluate the player’s anaerobic performances and lower limb flexibility (pretest). After baseline measurements, participants performed a standardized soccer training during which heart rate and RPE were recorded to evaluate the training load. At the end of the training unit all players were randomly assigned to the active recovery group and the passive recovery group. A second experimental session was organized to obtain the <b>posttest</b> <b>values.</b> Players performed the same test, administered in the same order than in the first trial. No significant differences between groups were observed in heart rate and RPE.

In most circumstances, these decisions are often politically contentious and frequently influenced by rent seeking behaviour. In this paper, we use a contest model to analyse the effects of rent seeking effort when permits are freely distributed (grandfathered). Rent seeking behaviour can influence both the share of permits which an individual firm receives and also the total supply of permits. This latter impact depends on the responsiveness of the regulator to aggregate rent seeking effort.

40|$|BACKGROUND The term "arrhythmia" {{refers to}} any {{change from the}} normal {{sequence}} of electrical impulses. The electrical impulses may happen too fast, too slowly or erratically causing the heart to beat too fast, too slowly or erratically. When the heart doesn't beat properly, it can't pump blood effectively. When the heart doesn't pump blood effectively, the lungs, brain and all other organs can't work properly and may shutdown or be damaged. Normally, the heart's most rapidly firing cells are in the sinus (or sino-atrial or SA) node making that area a natural pacemaker. Under some conditions, almost all heart tissue can start an impulse of the type that can generate a heartbeat. Cells in the heart's conduction system can fire automatically and start electrical activity. This activity can interrupt the normal order of the heart's pumping activity. Secondary pacemakers elsewhere in the heart provide a "backup" rhythm when the sinus node doesn't work properly or when impulses are blocked somewhere in the conduction system. An arrhythmia occurs when the heart's natural pacemaker develops an abnormal rate or rhythm. The normal conduction pathway is interrupted. Another part of the heart takes over as pacemaker. The aim {{of the study is}} to observe the prevalence of various electrolyte (Na, K, Cl and Mg) imbalances in complications of arrhythmias. MATERIALS AND METHODS This is a prospective study in which the patient admitted with signs and symptoms of cardiac arrhythmias diagnosed clinically, 100 cases were selected over 1 year.

40|$|It has {{recently}} been verified using the Nintendo Wii in the health context. The {{aim of this study}} was to analyze the acute cardiovascular responses monitored by the behavior of heart rate, systolic blood pressure, diastolic blood pressure and double product in an environment virtually simulated by Nintendo Wii. The sample was consisted of 18 health college students with mean age 22. 07 ± 1. 34 years. The variables were observed with use of delta analysis (<b>post</b> <b>value</b> – prior value) after 25 basketball shoots in two experimental situations: (I) seating and (II) jumping vertically. The results suggest the physical activity in a virtual environment emulated by Nintendo Wii is able to change the acute cardiovascular responses, mainly when performed in association with vertical jumps. Thus, the results support the feasibility use of the Nintendo Wii in training programs and favor its indication more securely...|$|R
