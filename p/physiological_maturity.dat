2500|$|The idea of {{physiological}} ripeness (or <b>physiological</b> <b>maturity)</b> of grapes {{is a relatively}} recent addition to the discussion of ripeness in viticulture and winemaking. [...] It is a broad category of factors {{in the development of}} ripening grapes that affect a wine's quality beyond the standard measurements of sugars, acids, and pH. These factors generally include evaluating the ripeness of tannins as well as the development of other phenolic compounds that contribute to the color, flavor, and aroma of wine. In many ways, the concept {{of physiological}} ripeness is similar to the French notion of engustment (from the Latin root gustis or taste), the stage of ripening when aroma and flavor become apparent. Research has shown that most aroma compounds develop in the berry in glycosylated form as secondary metabolites which occur late in ripening as the buildup of sugars have leveled. This stage is distinct from the sugar/acid interactions of ripening because it is possible for a grape to be [...] "ripe" [...] in the context of sugar and acid levels but still be very immature {{when it comes to the}} development of tannins, aromas and flavor that characteristic a complex or quality wine.|$|E
50|$|The {{growing cycle}} varies from 150 to 360 days, {{depending}} on the genotype, altitude and environmental conditions.

30|$|Information on {{yield of}} non-carcass {{components}} of animals is important especially {{in developing countries}} where they are more valuable for the households (Mushi et al. 2009 b). The presence of variations in internal fat deposition among different breeds of goat has been reported earlier by Mahgoub and Lu (1998) and Kadim et al. (2003). On average, about 0.32  kg total non-carcass fat was recorded in the present study, which is lower than 0.57  kg reported for other Ethiopian indigenous goats (Ameha et al. 2007). Among the three goat types, SS goats {{can be regarded as}} physiologically early maturing animals as they have higher deposition of internal fats, and also better composition of chemical fat in the muscle as indicated by Tadesse et al. (2015). According to Ameha et al. (2007), different animals can have different <b>physiological</b> <b>maturities</b> as a result of difference in chemical fat composition and total non-carcass fat contents.|$|R

50|$|Several {{varieties}} of soybean have demonstrated {{resistance to the}} soybean aphid. Resistance may be conferred by antibiosis, antixenosis, or tolerance. In some instances, such as with the soybean cultivars 'Dowling', 'Jackson', and 'Palmetto', resistance to the soybean aphid results {{from a combination of}} both antibiosis and antixenosis. In the 'Dowling' cultivar, resistance is conferred by a single dominant gene (Rag1). Soybean plants that are resistant to the soybean aphid can cause both reduced fecundity and longevity in soybean aphids. In the case of antibiosis, certain life stages of the soybean aphid may be more susceptible than others. For example, nymphs have higher rates of metabolism than other life stages, ingest more phloem, and are thus exposed to larger quantities of antibiotic compounds. Expression of antibiotic factors in resistant soybean plants that negatively affect soybean aphids has been shown to remain constant throughout the growing season, remaining unaffected by the <b>physiological</b> <b>maturity</b> of the plant. Colonization of resistant soybean cultivars can vary between years depending upon the level of infestation, with resistant plants showing lower levels of resistance in years with significant levels of soybean aphid infestation. Physical characteristics of soybean, such as dense pubescence, have thus far proven incapable of reducing colonization by soybean aphids.|$|E
40|$|The {{microbial}} fermentability, ruminal degradability and digestibility of 48 maize silages {{were determined}} using in vitro gas production (GP), in situ degradability and in vitro digestibility procedures.

The potential of near infrared reflectance spectroscopy (NIRS) to predict the biological parameters measured was determined by regression of the biological data against the respective spectral profile. NIRS demonstrated only a moderate ability (R- 2 > 0. 60 - 0. 80) to predict in vitro digestibility, modelled kinetics of gas production (excluding the asymptote of gas production) and the modelled ruminally soluble dry matter (DM) fraction.

40|$|Maize silage nutritive {{quality is}} {{routinely}} determined by {{near infrared reflectance}} spectroscopy (NIRS). However, {{little is known about}} the impact of sample preparation on the accuracy of the calibration to predict biological traits. A sample population of 48 maize silages representing a wide range of <b>physiological</b> <b>maturities</b> was used in a study to determine the impact of different sample preparation procedures (i. e., drying regimes; the presence or absence of residual moisture; the degree of particle comminution) on resultant NIR prediction statistics. All silages were scanned using a total of 12 combinations of sample pre-treatments. Each sample preparation combination was subjected to three multivariate regression techniques to give a total of 36 predictions per biological trait. Increased sample preparations procedure, relative to scanning the unprocessed whole plant (WP) material, always resulted in a numerical minimisation of model statistics. However, the ability of each of the treatments to significantly minimise the model statistics differed. Particle comminution was the most important factor, oven-drying regime was intermediate, and residual moisture presence was the least important. Models to predict various biological parameters of maize silage will be improved if material is subjected to a high degree of particle comminution (i. e., having been passed through a 1 mm screen) and developed on plant material previously dried at 60 degrees C. The extra effort in terms of time and cost required to remove sample residual moisture cannot be justified. (c) 2005 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1982 The need {{to develop}} a shorter life cycle wheat {{cultivar}} which would be more adapted to multiple cropping systems prompted this study. Thus the following information was obtained. Greatest variations in developmental patterns were found in the stem elongation, booting, inflorescence emergence and anthesis for five winter and five spring cultivars when planted at different dates. Differences among the ten winter wheat cultivars in time, duration and rate of grain filling was also observed. Generally later flowering cultivars had a more rapid rate of grain filling than early flowering cultivars with the net result being that <b>physiological</b> <b>maturity</b> was similar between the two groups. Actual grain filling period from flowering to <b>physiological</b> <b>maturity</b> varied among the cultivars, but larger differences were observed in lag period from heading to flowering. The duration of lag period contributed to the largest difference in total grain filling period from heading to <b>physiological</b> <b>maturity.</b> Changes in visual spike color of the glumes and main axis of a spike was satisfactory in identifying <b>physiological</b> <b>maturity</b> without destruction of the spike; however changes in kernel color was a more direct and precise method. <b>Physiological</b> <b>maturity</b> is a better measure of the optimum harvesting time to provide for maximum grain yield for planting sequential crops. Grain yield was positively associated with time of heading, flowering, <b>physiological</b> <b>maturity,</b> rate of grain filling and components of grain yield, but negatively associated with duration of grain filling period, lag period and harvest index. There was little association with the duration of the actual grain filling period and grain yield. However, a large association was observed between grain yield and the rate of grain filling. The direct effects of tiller number and rate of grain filling on grain yield were consistently positive and high.

40|$|Field sample {{preservation}} and tissue selection for condensed tannin (CT) analysis were investigated with three Leucaena genotypes, L. leucocephala subspecies glabrata (Lam.) de Wit cv. Tarramba (K 636), L pallida Britton and Rose (K 806) and the F 1 interspecific hybrid L. pallida (K 748) × L. leucocephala (K 636). Shoot, youngest fully expanded leaf (YFEL) and mature leaf (ML) tissues were analysed for extractable, protein and fibre-bound CT for each Leucaena species. There {{was no significant}} difference in CT content measured in excised tissues whether frozen by dry ice or liquid nitrogen. The shoot material of all genotypes contained more CT, of all components, than the YFEL and ML tissues. Extractable CT was highest in L. pallida, lowest in L. leucocephala and intermediate in the hybrid. The YFEL was selected as the most appropriate sample tissue because it was easily recognized, enabled consistent sampling of tissue at the same <b>physiological</b> stage of <b>maturity,</b> and contained sufficient CT for the determination of the CT status of each genotype. © 1997 Elsevier Science B.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to characterize the chemistry and the antioxidant capacity in 8 species of native fruits from Amazonia. All the fruits were collected at full <b>physiological</b> and commercial <b>maturity</b> from properties located at: Boa Vista / RR, São Luiz do Anauá / RR, Manaus / AM, and Belém / PA. At the end of the experiment, the functional pattern for the camu-camu fruits showed that the total phenolic and ascorbic acid content and antioxidant assays were superior compared to the other samples. Despite the functional losses detected for the freeze-dried samples of the camu-camu fruit, all the other freeze-dried samples kept under - 20 ºC showed appropriate stability for long-term storage. In addition, it was also observed that fruit peel showed higher antioxidant activity than pulp or samples containing peel and pulp tissues in the same extract. When the ratio between the ORAC and total phenolic assays were observed, the uxi fruit demonstrated the highest antioxidant power compared to the other fruits studied, despite its relatively low levels of phenolic compound content and ORAC values. This means that there is a relevant contribution of these phenolic compounds to the antioxidant activity of uxi fruit...|$|R
