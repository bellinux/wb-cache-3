2500|$|Once in place, {{the first}} task of an {{administrator}} is to make proposals to achieve the administration objectives. These {{should be given to}} the registrar and unsecured creditors within 10 weeks, followed by a creditor vote to approve the plans by simple majority. If creditors do not approve the court may make an order as it sees fit. However, before then under Schedule B1, paragraph 59 the administrator can do 'anything necessary or expedient for the management of the affairs, business and property of the company'. In Re Transbus International Ltd Lawrence Collins J made the point that the rules on administration were intended to be [...] "a more flexible, cheaper and comparatively informal alternative to liquidation" [...] and so with regard to doing what is expedient [...] "the fewer applications which need to be made to the court the better." [...] This means that an administrator can sell the whole assets of a company immediately, making the eventual creditors' meeting redundant. Because of this and out of court appointments, since 2002, [...] "pre-packaged administrations" [...] became increasingly popular. Typically the company directors negotiate with their bank, and a prospective administrator, to sell the business to a buyer immediately after entering administration. Often to the company's directors are the buyers. The perceived benefits of this practice, originating in the 1980s in the United States, is that a quick sale without hiring lawyers and expending time or business assets through formalities, can be effected to keep the business running and employees in their jobs. The potential downside is that because a deal is already agreed among the controlling interested parties (directors, insolvency practitioners and the major secured creditor) before broader consultation, unsecured creditors are given no voice, and will recover almost none of their debts. In Re Kayley Vending Ltd, which concerned an in-court appointed administrator, HH Judge Cooke held that a court will ensure that applicants for a <b>prepack</b> administration provide enough information for a court to conclude that the scheme is not being used to unduly disadvantage unsecured creditors. Moreover, while the costs of arranging the <b>prepack</b> before entering administration will count for the purpose of administrator's expenses, it is less likely to do so if the business is sold to the former management. Here the sale of a cigarette vending machine business was to the company's competitors, and so the deal was sufficiently [...] "arm's length" [...] to raise no concern. In their conduct of meetings, the Court of Appeal made clear in Revenue and Customs Commissioners v Maxwell that administrators appointed out of court will be scrutinised in the way they treat unsecured creditors. Here the administrator did not treat the Revenue as having sufficient votes against the company's management buyout proposal, but the court substituted its judgment and stated the number of votes allowed should take account of events all the way in the run up to the meeting, including in this case the Revenue's amended claim for unlawful tax deductions to the managers' trust funds and loans to directors.|$|E

Applicants for a <b>prepack</b> administration should provide sufficient information for a court to see that a <b>prepack</b> deal is not being used to disadvantage creditors. Furthermore, a proposed administrator’s costs may be counted as an expense of liquidation, {{and so it was}} here where the costs were incurred {{for the good of the}} creditors as a whole. It would not be so if a <b>prepack</b> sale was to the management, rather than an arm’s length purchaser. In the course of his judgment he discussed the concerns about pre-pack administrations.|$|E

5000|$|The <b>prepack</b> was criticised as [...] "completely immoral", and {{inappropriate}} for listed companies, by a South African creditor, LA group. It had sold a clothing manufacturer to Wensum in May 2009, {{in exchange for}} Wensum shares which became worthless after the <b>prepack.</b> Another Wensum shareholder compared the deal to a [...] "spider eviscerating a fly it has caught, taking all the good bits, then dropping the useless carcass, which is the creditors, the shareholders {{and of course the}} taxpayer".|$|E
5000|$|In May 2009, Wensum was {{put into}} a <b>prepack</b> {{administration}} which allowed a new company, GG125, to acquire Wensum's assets for £7.9 million, whilst leaving its debts unpaid. GG125 was subsequently renamed Wensum Group Limited. The deal was completed in a day, Dorrell receiving a director salary (increased to £200,000 in September 2009) plus 15% share ownership in the new company. As company contributions had ceased, the workers were put into the Pension Protection Fund (PPF), which caps the maximum payable and has limited protection against inflation. Hall expects to lose 30-40% of his pension because of the cap. [...] Dorrell {{and his wife had}} already withdrawn their pensions, although Dorrell claimed he had lost £550,000 because of the failure, and that the alternative to the <b>prepack</b> would have offered less.|$|E

The results indicated that a retail shelf-life of 4 days can be guaranteed for prepackaged whole plaice and fillets at temperatures not exceeding 4 °C.

50|$|Peter Clark J {{held that}} {{regulation}} 8(7) was triggered and TUPER 2006 regulations 4 and 7 {{did not apply}} since {{the intention of the}} administration was to return value to the creditors.

5000|$|There {{is often}} a {{suspicion}} that the consideration paid for the business {{may not have been}} maximized due to the absence of open marketing. Credit may have been incurred inappropriately prior to the pre-pack and this may not be fully investigated. [...] Criticism of this nature had been levelled at pre-pack sales by John Moulton of Alchemy Partners in January 2009, saying 'Pre-packs could be very easily abused. Bad management can plan for a <b>prepack</b> months in advance, line up an administrator - and then be back running the business immediately.

This concrete may be regarded as a skeleton concrete, as the coarse aggregates effectively rest against one another. The remaining voids are filled with cement mortar.

5000|$|The {{potential}} {{downside is}} that because a deal is already agreed among the controlling interested parties (directors, insolvency practitioners and usually the major secured creditor) before broader consultation, unsecured creditors are left behind as the momentum behind the deal carries events forward.
