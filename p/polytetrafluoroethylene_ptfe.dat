5|$|Polymers {{exhibit the}} same {{stability}} increases afforded by fluorine substitution (for hydrogen) in discrete molecules; their melting points generally increase too. <b>Polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (<b>PTFE),</b> the simplest fluoropolymer and perfluoro analogue of polyethylene with structural unit , demonstrates this change as expected, but its very {{high melting point}} {{makes it difficult to}} mold. Various PTFE derivatives are less temperature-tolerant but easier to mold: fluorinated ethylene propylene replaces some fluorine atoms with trifluoromethyl groups, perfluoroalkoxy alkanes do the same with trifluoromethoxy groups, and Nafion contains perfluoroether side chains capped with sulfonic acid groups. Other fluoropolymers retain some hydrogen atoms; polyvinylidene fluoride has half the fluorine atoms of PTFE and polyvinyl fluoride has a quarter, but both behave much like perfluorinated polymers.|$|E
5|$|<b>Polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (<b>PTFE),</b> {{sometimes}} called by its DuPont name Teflon, represents 60–80% by {{mass of the}} world's fluoropolymer production. The largest application is in electrical insulation since PTFE is an excellent dielectric. It is also used in the chemical industry where corrosion resistance is needed, in coating pipes, tubing, and gaskets. Another major use is in PFTE-coated fiberglass cloth for stadium roofs. The major consumer application is for non-stick cookware. Jerked PTFE film becomes expanded PTFE (ePTFE), a fine-pored membrane sometimes referred to by the brand name Gore-Tex and used for rainwear, protective apparel, and filters; ePTFE fibers may be made into seals and dust filters. Other fluoropolymers, including fluorinated ethylene propylene, mimic PTFE's properties and can substitute for it; they are more moldable, but also more costly and have lower thermal stability. Films from two different fluoropolymers replace glass in solar cells.|$|E

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} the surface functionaliza-tion of woven silk fabric by magnetron sputter coating of <b>PTFE</b> (<b>polytetrafluoroethylene).</b> The <b>PTFE</b> sputter coating {{was applied to}} improve the hydrophobic property of silk fabric. The effects of PTFE sputter coating on surface morphology and surface chemical properties were charac-terized using atomic force microscopy (AFM) and ATR-FTIR (attenuated total reflection-Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy). The wettability of the fabric was charac-terized through measuring the surface contact angle by a dynamic sessile analysis (DSA) technique. The contact angle of the PTFE coated fabric showed a significant in-crease from 68 to about 138. The experimental results also revealed that larger sputtering pressures brought less contact angle hysteresis...|$|R

25|$|Besides the above-described films ((Polypropylene (PP), Polyethylene Terephthalate Polyester PET), Polyphenylene Sulfide (PPS), Polyethylene Naphthalate (PEN), Polycarbonate (PP), Polystyrene (PS) and <b>Polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (<b>PTFE)),</b> {{some other}} plastic {{materials}} {{may be used}} as the dielectric in film capacitors. Thermoplastic polymers such as Polyimide (PI), Polyamide (PA, better known as Nylon or Perlon), Polyvinylidene fluoride (PVDF), Siloxane, Polysulfone (PEx) and Aromatic Polyester (FPE) are described in the technical literature as possible dielectric films for capacitors. The primary reason for considering new film materials for capacitors is the relative low permittivity of commonly used materials. With a higher permittivity, film capacitors could be made even smaller, an advantage in the market for more-compact portable electronic devices.|$|E

PFOA can be used to stabilize fluoropolymer and fluoroelastomer suspensions before further industrial processing and in ion-pair reversed-phase liquid chromatography it can act as an extraction agent.

2500|$|Steel or {{aluminum}} cooking pans can be {{coated with}} a substance such as <b>polytetrafluoroethylene</b> (<b>PTFE,</b> often referred to with the genericized trademark Teflonreg&) {{in order to minimize}} food sticking to the pan surface. [...] There are advantages and disadvantages to such a coating. [...] Coated pans are easier to clean than most non-coated pans, and require little or no additional oil or fat to prevent sticking, a feature that helps to produce more nutritious food. [...] On the other hand, some sticking is required to cause sucs to form, so a non-stick pan cannot be used where a pan sauce is desired. Non-stick coatings tend to degrade over time and are susceptible to damage. [...] In order to preserve the coating, it is important never to use metal implements, harsh scouring pads or chemical abrasives to clean the cooking surface.|$|E

40|$|Polymeric {{composites}} {{are widely}} used for structural, aerospace, and automobile sectors due to their good combination of high specific strength and specific modulus. These two main characteristics make these materials attractive, compared to conventional materials like metal or alloy ones. Some of their typical benefits include easy processing, corrosion resistance, low friction, and damping of noise and vibrations. Wear behavior of <b>Polytetrafluoroethylenes</b> (<b>PTFE)</b> and its composites including glass-filled composites and carbon-filled composites are investigated using a pin-on-disc configuration. A plan of experiments in terms of Taguchi technique is carried out to acquire data in controlled way.

Volume loss increased with abrasive size, load, and distance. Furthermore, specific wear rate decreased with increasing grit size, load, sliding distance, whereas, slightly with compressive strength. Optimal process parameters, which minimize the volume loss, were the factor combinations of L 1, G 3, D 1, and C 3. Confirmation experiments were conducted to verify the optimal testing parameters.
