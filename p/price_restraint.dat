40|$|This PhD thesis {{critically}} surveys vertical territorial and <b>price</b> <b>restraints</b> in the EU and the USA {{not just}} from a legal angle, but also from comparative, economic, theoretical and historical perspectives. Different aspects of such comprehensive research assist with tackling the different issues {{that have occurred in}} the law of vertical territorial and <b>price</b> <b>restraints</b> while determining its correct approach. This thesis argues against some existing competition policies and principles, such as the objective of the law of vertical territorial and <b>price</b> <b>restraints.</b> It shows that law of vertical territorial and <b>price</b> <b>restraints</b> should protect effective and free competition. Nevertheless, it follows that the object of effective competition is efficiency which is difficult to determine in situations when RPM or VTR is used. Furthermore, the complexity of vertical competition and vertical chains, including relationships, power and market structures, is surveyed. This thesis advocates the existence of vertical competition and further explains that it is bargaining power which should be assessed in RPM and VTR cases and not horizontal market power, which serves the purpose of horizontal rather than vertical competition. The development of the laws of vertical territorial and <b>price</b> <b>restraints</b> including the analysis of relevant and significant cases both in the EU and the USA within a broader historical framework and relevant theories unveil some inconsistencies and uncertainties. This thesis criticises the formalistic approach within traditional anti-competitive theories and the demagogical approach within the majority of pro-competitive theories offering new suggestions and points of view. Although vertical restraints have been part of US antitrust law and EU competition law almost since the beginning of their existence, this thesis reveals that their approaches have been unsettled and continue to develop with contradictory arguments on this issue across the legal, economical, empirical and theoretical scholarly works, which show lack of understanding of vertical competition. Unfortunately, vertical competition has not been acknowledged as the basic framework for vertical restraints in both the EU and US policies and their legislations. Therefore, this thesis concludes with legislative suggestions which better reflect the nature of vertical restraints. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

40|$|We {{investigate}} theoretically and empirically {{the competitive}} effects of increased trade on prices, productivity and markups. Using disaggregated data for EU manufacturing {{over the period}} 1988 - 2000 we find increased openness exerts a negative and significant impact on sectoral prices. Increased openness lowers prices by both reducing markups and raising productivity. In response {{to an increase in}} openness, markups show a steep short run decline, which partly reverses later, while productivity rises in a manner that increases over time. Our estimates suggest that EU manufacturing prices fell by 2. 3 %, productivity rose by 11 % and markups fell by 1. 6 % in response to the observed increase in manufacturing imports. The direct <b>price</b> <b>restraint</b> caused by greater imports, assuming unchanged monetary policy, can explain a fall in inflation of up to 0. 14 % per annum. The most substantial impact on inflation arises, however, from the role of lower markups in reducing the inflation bias of monetary policy. Our results suggest that increased trade could account for as much as a quarter of European disinflation over this period. competition; globalization; inflation; markups; openness; prices; productivity; trade...|$|E
40|$|To {{what extent}} do intersubjective {{understandings}} shape interests in wage, price or currency cooperation? What might lead workers, firms or investors to exercise private restraint on behalf of public interests in wage, price or currency stability? Given official efforts to limit uncertainty, could such interests assume "lives of their own" and negate Phillips Curve-styled trade-offs between unemployment and inflation, or Impossible Trinity-styled tensions between openness, autonomy, and exchange-rate stability? In this chapter, I offer a constructivist theory of interests in monetary cooperation, one emphasizing the intersubjective - often self-reinforcing - bases of beliefs regarding the need for private wage or <b>price</b> <b>restraint.</b> From this vantage, a macroeconomic stimulus need not have any inevitable effects on inflation or depreciation if workers, firms, or investors exercise wage, price or currency restraint. Having developed this framework, I then apply it to explain postwar variation in monetary cooperation. I first address {{the emergence of an}} early postwar Keynesian egalitarianism which justified the use of wage and price guidelines to reconcile full employment with monetary stability. I then describe how these views yielded to a Neoclassical pragmatism which reduced the scope for incomes policies to the short run, justifying greater macroeconomic restraint. I finally address the emergence of a Classical libertarianism which would decisively undermine the use of incomes policies by the late 1970 s. Over this narrative, I also highlight the implications for the rise and demise of international cooperation, contrasting the early postwar use of incomes policies as the "first line of defense" for the dollar with their later erosion as it contributed to the collapse of the Bretton Woods fixed exchange rate system. Taken as a whole, this analysis call into question notions of enduring trade-offs between growth and monetary stability: While tensions may exist between these priorities, such trade-offs are not exogenously given. Instead, intersubjective forces can themselves give meaning to macroeconomic trends, potentially altering the very slope of the Phillips Curve itself. No Full Tex...|$|E

40|$|In this Article I {{present a}} two-pronged {{analysis}} of vertical restraints, one {{in law and}} one in economics. By tracing the checkered legal history of vertical restraints, I show the marked changes recent antitrust decisions have wrought, in particular, by comparing the legal standards expressed by the Supreme Court in Monsanto Co. v. Spray-Rite Service Corp. with those in Business Electronics Corp. v. Sharp Electronics Corp and Atlantic Richfield Co. (ARCO) v. USA Petroleum Co. If through the latter two cases the Court has, for all practical purposes, created a category of per se legality for vertical <b>price</b> <b>restraints,</b> which I {{believe to be the}} case, then it would not be unreasonable to expect the Court to proceed in the same fashion with respect to vertical non-price restraints in the future. After assessing the current legal status of vertical restraints through market analyses, I demonstrate that the economic reasoning justifying their per se legal treatment is not as compelling as previously believed. I show this in two respects. One evaluation stems from recent advances in economic theory exploring the dynamics underlying the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s decision process when selecting a method of product distribution. By drawing on those developments, I identify market scenarios not previously considered, in which the anticompetitive effects of vertical <b>price</b> <b>restraints</b> on certain distribution strategies raise new and legitimate antitrust concerns. A second inquiry reexamines the economic issue that initially gave rise to arguments in favor of the legalization of vertical <b>price</b> <b>restraints,</b> that is, the phenomenon of price-discounting retailers who are also free riders. Some commentators have argued that manufacturers should be able to impose vertical <b>price</b> <b>restraints</b> to protect against the dealer erosion that free-riding precipitates. Reaching a different conclusion, this Article demonstrates that either the manufacturer can achieve those same ends through less trade-restrictive business methods that may, in addition, enhance consumers 2 ̆ 7 satisfaction, or, that the strategies themselves, from an economics perspective, are not worthy of protection. Together, both economic analyses, that of the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s distribution choices and that of the free rider phenomenon, signify that unfettered freedom for manufacturers to impose whatever vertical arrangements they choose actually can foster lower efficiency levels and consumer welfare, the primary economic measures used to evaluate antitrust policy. These results are at variance with those of the Chicago School and indicate the need for more subtle, yet well-defined, antitrust treatment of vertical restraints than per se legal rules offer. Moreover, the conclusions of this Article 2 ̆ 7 s market evaluations also demonstrate that the rigidity created by per se illegal treatment of vertical <b>price</b> <b>restraints</b> lowers consumer welfare as well, when applied to certain commonly occurring manufacturer-retailer relationships. Given that neither per se illegal nor per se legal rules for vertical <b>price</b> <b>restraints</b> have the flexibility to make the crucial distinctions between a manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s pro- and anticompetitive conduct, this Article argues for the application of a rule of reason standard that incorporates those features of market structure that economic reasoning indicates will ensure procompetitive impact...|$|R

The paper is organised as follows: after the introduction, section II reviews some salient characteristics of France's trade in recent years; section III discusses an accounting decomposition of movements in the non-energy and in the manufacturing trade balance over the period 1990 to 1996; section IV presents econometric methodology used in the empirical work; section V examines the error-correction model for non-energy and manufacturing imports; section VI examines the possibility of hysteresis in imports through equation stability tests; section VII examines the corresponding model for non-energy and manufacturing exports and section VIII reviews the question of hysteresis in exports; section IX uses elasticity estimates from the economic estimation to shed light on the relationship between the trade balance and demand and competitiveness developments; section X presents simulation results for the non-energy and the manufacturing trade balance since the 1990 s; and, finally, section XI presents conclusions. There are 8 annexes complementing the paper. II/ 511 / 97 -ENOne of the striking characteristics of France's economic performance {{since the beginning of the}} present decade has been the strength of the external accounts. In particular, on the basis of national accounts data, since 1989 the current account and the non-energy trade balance have recorded rising surpluses, which in 1996 amounted to 1. 7 % of GDP and to close to 1. 5 % of GDP, respectively. The service balance, on the other hand, has registered persistent surpluses which averaged between 1 and 1. 4 percent of GDP in the 1990 s. The largest component of merchandise trade is trade in manufactured goods. The balance on manufacturing trade recorded surpluses throughout the period following the 1973 oil crisis to the late 1980 s. The manufacturing trade balance slipped into deficit in the period 1987 - 1991 but subsequently moved into surplus which rose to almost 1 % of GDP in 1996. Graph 1 presents quarterly data on the evolution of these variables from the beginning of the 1970 s to the end of 1996; data adjusted for inflation present a similar picture. It is clear that since movements in the current account are dominated by movements in the non-energy and, in particular, in the manufacturing trade balance throughout this period the sources of the current account improvement in the 1990 s are likely to be those explaining the improvement of the manufacturing trade balance. Awareness of the importance of developments in France's external transactions became more pronounced following the commitment to sustain a stable franc in the ERM. External accounts deficits were considered as leading to devaluations and, consequently, exchange rate stability required that the trade balance was not systematically in deficit, in order not to undermine exchange and the stability. Since the dominant component of France's external transactions is trade in manufactures, the commitment to a stable franc inevitably implied the necessity to strengthen the manufacturing trade balance, principally through improvements in competitiveness. These took the form of cost and <b>price</b> <b>restraint</b> which has had a beneficial effect on export growth and on the manufacturing trade balance, and on supporting the external value of the franc. Graph 1 also shows the importance of manufacturing in France's external and, more specifically, in non-energy trade. Over much of the period since the beginning of the 1970 s peaks and troughs in the former coincide with peaks and troughs in the latter, while the level of the manufacturing trade balance accounts on average for virtually the level of the non-energy trade balance. This relationship has been particularly close in the period up to the second half of the 1980 s. Since then, a systematic deviation has emerged where the level of the manufacturing trade balance has been lower than the level of the non-energy trade balance. Furthermore, since 1987 improvements in the non-energy trade balance have been larger than those in trade in manufactures where notably larger deficits have been recorded until late 1991. Clearly, marked improvements in non-manufacturing, non-energy trade (that is, trade in agricultural and food commodities) are at the background of these developments. By 1996, the non-energy trade balance had registered surpluses amounting to over 1 percent of GDP while the manufacturing trade balance had recovered from a peak deficit of 0. 7 percent of GDP recorded at the end of the 1980 s and in the beginning of the 1990 s to a surplus of 0. 7 percent of GDP in the first three quarters of 1996. This improvement has taken place against a background of turbulence in the ERM marked by the substantial nominal and real depreciations of the exchange rate for the Italian lira, the Spanish peseta, the Portuguese escudo, and the British and the Irish pound against the French franc. There are three significant factors which have undoubtedly contributed to France's external performance in recent years. First, the different cyclical position of France relative to its main trading partners; secondly, relative price developments which have moved to France's advantage or disadvantage principally, but not exclusively, as a result of nominal and real exchange rate changes; and, third, supply improvements which have promoted export expansion and import substitution, principally through gains in cost and price competitiveness but also through improvements in non-price competitiveness associated with changing technology through new investment in the trading sectors of the economy, increased export capacity, productivity-induced relative price changes etc. The impact of the first two factors has likely dominated, especially in short-term developments, the latter's influence on France's trade. Ultimately, however, many supply-side improvements have undoubtedly themselves taken the form of improvements in France's relative costs and relative prices. The {{purpose of the}} present paper is to review the sources of France's trade surplus in recent years and to attribute trade balance movements strictly to those determinants of trade flows suggested by economic theory. These determinants are price and/or cost developments, and demand in France and in the rest of the world. Nominal exchange rate movements in the 1990 s have been perceived as playing a significant role in France's trade performance, particularly during the depreciation episodes of 1992 and 1993, since they were considered to have imparted a competitive advantage to those trading partners whose currency had depreciated against the franc; ceteris paribus, and assuming that the nominal depreciation led to a real exchange depreciation, imports would increase and exports would decline, and the trade surplus in real terms would decline. This could have permanent effects on the trade balance since, according to some models of international trade, prolonged exchange rate appreciations, or depreciations can induce hysteresis phenomena (see Baldwin (1988), for example). At the same time, slow growth in France relative to the rest of the world in the 1990 s would be expected to have led to a widening of the trade surplus. These two factors have a conflicting impact on trade balance movements, and since income elasticities are generally substantially larger than relative price elasticities it is possible to argue that the emergence of the trade surplus since the beginning of the 1990 s is dominated by relative demand movements. A primary objective of the paper is to examine the empirical support for these propositions and to analyse the dynamics of adjustment of trade flows to changes in competitiveness and in relative demand. To do so, a cointegration/error-correction model is applied to flows of both imports and exports, and the estimates of key elasticities obtained are instrumental in shedding light on this question. The paper, in addition to the introduction, is organized as follows: Section II reviews some salient characteristics of France's trade in recent years in terms of trade patterns, price and cost competitiveness developments, import penetration and export market performance, and in terms of demand developments in France and abroad; section III discusses an accounting decomposition of movements in the non-energy and in the manufacturing trade balance over the period 1990 to 1996 according to the state of price competitiveness and of relative demand; section IV presents the econometric methodology used in the empirical work; section V examines the error-correction model for non-energy and manufacturing imports; section VI examines the possibility of hysteresis in imports through equation stability tests; section VII examines the corresponding model for non-energy and manufacturing exports and section VIII reviews the question of hysteresis in exports again through equation stability tests; section IX uses elasticity estimates from the econometric estimation to shed light on the relationship between the trade balance and demand and competitiveness developments; section X presents simulation results for the non-energy and the manufacturing trade balance since the beginning of the 1990 s where the contribution of price competitiveness and of relative demand is evaluated; and, finally, section XI presents conclusions. There are eight annexes complementing the paper. The sources and the time series properties of the data are presented in Annex A; Annexes B, C and D present additional cointegration results and further evidence on the stability of the import equations; and Annexes E, F, G, and H are devoted to reviewing further cointegration results and to examining the stability of the export functions. trade analysis, french imports, french exports...|$|E

Basically, the rule of reason doctrine requires analysis of an alleged violation and the weighing of all circumstances and factors to determine whether a restriction on trade or competition unreasonably restrains competition. Those that do not unreasonably restrain competition are permitted.

40|$|In summary, I have {{addressed}} 5 key issues concerning vaccines today. First is the essentially empiric nature of vaccinology. Vaccinology {{is not a}} rational science. Each idea must be tested by experiment. This need for trial and error experimentation is a substantial barrier to new vaccines. The proven track record of existing vaccines to eradicate disease, to reduce occurrence of disease, reduce human suffering and contain health care spending [...] when coupled {{with the potential for}} new discoveries against significant disease targets [...] is unparalleled by other therapeutic areas. The complexity of vaccine delivery today in clinical practice with 15 - 17 injections {{in the first two years}} of life emphasizes the need for development of combination pediatric vaccines, for example, putting DTaP, HBV, HIB, and IPV together. This has proved to be far more difficult than previously believed due to unpredicted immune interference and incompatibilities on mixing of different components, demonstrating again the inadequacy of our understanding of how vaccines work and the empiric nature of the science. Similar complexity will face adult vaccines in the future, as new adult vaccines are developed. Next, vaccines remain undervalued by people, by government, and by society. Government-controlled prices in many areas of the world prohibit a return on investment that supports innovative R&D. New vaccines may be unavailable in certain markets because of <b>pricing</b> <b>restraints.</b> <b>Prices</b> of new vaccines in the developed world will rise as will prices in the developing world for products currently available only in the developed world. Reluctance to use vaccines is an especially disturbing symptom of the undervaluation issue. In the U. S., school entry requirements have kept childhood immunization rates high by five years of age. But this is a new phenomenon, driven in part by the measles outbreaks. The risk is that history will repeat itself. In the absence of disease and lack of public knowledge of these diseases, complacency sets in, immunization rates fall, with the expected result on occurrence of disease. For adults, we may hope that managed care with its interest in cost saving and disease prevention may actually help in achieving the goals of the Year 2000. Finally, I have talked about the anti-vaccine attitudes and forces that impede control of disease by vaccines. It is important that new initiatives be undertaken that will be successful in providing a balanced view of vaccine safety, efficacy and benefits to the public, to the provider and to the payers...|$|R

To date, the Individual Transferable Quota [ITQ] approach has been adopted for only a few fisheries in the U. S., although there is strong support for extending the approach to others. The basic goal of the ITQ approach is to create well-defined, exclusive property rights in a fishery, giving holders of those rights the incentive to fish efficiently and manage the resource for long-term sustainable yield. The property rights allocated are often percentage shares of the total annual allowable harvest or quota for the particular fishery. The transferability of these shares is key to the ITQ approach-being marketable, the shares will come to be owned by those who will most efficiently utilize them. Analysis of the ITQ approach, however, gives rise to the question of whether ITQ programs will have effects resulting in violations of U. S. antitrust law. The Sherman Antitrust Act, the Clayton Act, and the Federal Trade Commission Act all serve to protect consumers from anticompetitive activity. Once shares in a fishery are placed on the market, will trading result in single-owner accumulation of shares approaching monopoly in violation of these statutes? Will impermissible domination of competition and pricing result from concentrations of shares in the hands of a few? This Article examines the legal implications of ITQs with regard to antitrust law. It begins by identifying the benefits of the ITQ approach and considering the potential anticompetitive effects of an ITQ system. It then discusses the legal requirements for finding of monopoly, illegal <b>price</b> <b>restraints</b> and other impermissible restraints on competition. The Article concludes that ITQ systems can be designed to avert the possibility of excessive accumulation of shares in the hands of a few, and that such ITQ systems are unlikely to have effects that will result in antitrust violations...|$|R
40|$|In Chapter 1, I {{examine the}} {{frequent}} use of recommended retail prices by manufacturers. I present a model in which price recommendations convey information to consumers about aggregate market conditions. The manufacturer uses recommendations to directly affect consumers’ search and indirectly affect retail prices. I show that the manufacturer can credibly provide information through cheap talk. A ban on recommendations can be welfare reducing, harming both consumers and the manufacturer. Price recommendations are not simply a substitute for <b>price</b> <b>restraints</b> and allow the manufacturer to achieve outcomes unattainable with resale price maintenance. With a co-author in Chapter 2, we explore a class of settings in which a principal chooses when to hold a selection contest. Agents’ types evolve and a later contest is more accurate. However, an agent’s effort in the contest diminishes her task performance and the less time until the task, the costlier the effort. We show later contests are better whenever types are more disperse and whenever contests favor the skilled. We find that the expected performance of the selected agent is invariant to average ability and can increase or decrease {{with the number of}} participants. We recast the timing decision as a screening problem with the principal suffering agents’ signalling costs. The optimal screening mechanism is equivalent to that in Chakravarty and Kaplan (2006), is stochastic, and favors agents with low hazard ratios. In Chapter 3, I address the long standing puzzle of trading volume in financial markets. No trade theorems suggest that no two rational speculators can trade. I propose a simple dynamic matching model where trades occur. Agents are endowed with information and through zero sum trading discover whether their information is valuable. Traders with bad information learn their type and exit, traders with good information remain and collect surplus in perpetuity. In equilibrium agents rationally enter trades they expect to lose because of the option value of information. There is a speculator multiplier on trading volume as the market size grows exponentially with gains from trade...|$|R
40|$|American {{pharmaceutical}} {{manufacturers are}} under siege. Even casual observers of this sector recognize the severe {{challenges to the}} prevailing business model: declining research productivity; heightened regulatory focus on safety and comparative outcomes with a correspondingly low number of new product approvals; decreasing market capitalization of mature companies; increasing product liability claims; evolving <b>price</b> <b>restraints</b> {{in the face of}} increasing managed care market power; and the looming uncertainty of the effects of federal health care reform. But, in fact, the single greatest threat to the pharmaceutical industry may be the policy environment within the United States, which is restricting the ability of companies to speak truthfully with physicians about their products. During the past decade drug companies have endured intrusive government investigations of their business practices, particularly with respect to the marketing and promotion of their products. Firms face extraordinary civil and criminal liability if they discuss or otherwise attempt to influence prescribing other than for the indications approved by the U. S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). There are now well more than one hundred ongoing civil and criminal investigations involving the U. S. Department of Justice (DOJ) and units of the U. S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), as well as associated investigations run by state attorneys general. Billions of dollars in civil and criminal penalties have been paid to date for alleged wrongdoing, and many billions more surely will be paid in the coming years, on top of the costs of the investigations themselves and the potential further liability that may stem from related private class actions brought by plaintiffs 2 ̆ 7 counsel. The concomitant media and political scrutiny has irreparably harmed the reputation of the industry. If the history of Western civilization may be seen as one long battle pitting order against freedom, the government 2 ̆ 7 s effort to curtail off-label speech might be dismissed as a minor skirmish on the outskirts of town. However, this issue is anything but minor in policy terms. The eventual outcome will have significant implications for the practice of medicine, the development of new drugs, and the public health...|$|R
40|$|We study a {{model of}} {{vertical}} relations with imperfect retail competition in which {{a fraction of the}} consumers display reference-dependent demand with respect to the manufacturer’s suggested retail price. We demonstrate that in equilibrium the suggestion will either be undercut or complied with by the retailers, but never surpassed: undercutting occurs if competition is fierce, the impact from consumers affected by reference-dependent preferences is significant, and high price suggestions are credible; compliance occurs otherwise. We provide comparisons, and discuss implications, for consumer surplus for the scenarios with suggested retail <b>prices,</b> without vertical <b>restraints</b> and with resale price maintenance...|$|R
40|$|We study a manufacturer-retailer {{relationship}} where, {{besides the}} adverse selection and moral hazard components, it is explicitly considered a type-dependent participation constraint capturing the shadow cost of exclusive dealings. The welfare effects of contracts based on both retail price and sales are {{compared to those}} of contracts contingent solely upon sales. When the type-dependent outside option severely aspects the agency problem and contracts are set non-cooperatively, retail price restrictions may be detrimental to consumers. At the same time, if contracts are set cooperatively, we show that whenever sales-based contracts are observed they are detrimental to consumers. asymmetric information, countervailing incentive, double marginalization, resale <b>price</b> maintenance, vertical <b>restraint,</b> welfare...|$|R
40|$|The paper revisits the {{conventional}} wisdom according to which vertical restrictions on retail prices help upstream firms to collude. We analyse the scope for collusion with and without resale price maintenance (RPM) when retailers observe local shocks on demand or retail costs. In the absence of RPM, retail prices react to retailers' information and deviations from collusive behaviour are thus difficult to detect. By eliminating retail price flexibility, RPM facilitates the detection of deviations but reduces profits and increases the short-run gains from a deviation. Overall, RPM can facilitate collusion and it reduces total welfare whenever firms choose to adopt it. Antitrust; Collusion; Resale <b>Price</b> Maintenance; Vertical <b>Restraints...</b>|$|R
5000|$|By the 1980s, {{televised}} {{college football}} {{had become a}} much larger {{source of income for}} the NCAA. In September 1981, the Board of Regents of the University of Oklahoma and the University of Georgia Athletic Association filed suit against the NCAA in district court in Oklahoma. The plaintiffs stated that the NCAA's football television plan constituted <b>price</b> fixing, output <b>restraints,</b> boycott, and monopolizing, all of which were illegal under the Sherman Act. The NCAA argued that its pro-competitive and non-commercial justifications for the plan - protection of live gate, maintenance of competitive balance among NCAA member institutions, {{and the creation of a}} more attractive [...] "product" [...] to compete with other forms of entertainment - combined to make the plan reasonable.|$|R
40|$|By {{the begining}} of 1997 resale price {{maintenance}} was legally enforceable on only two groups of products in the UK, books and non-prescription medicines. The Net Book Agreement had been in existence substantially unchanged, for close on 100 years. It amounted to a horizontal agreement amongst publishers to maintain a vertical <b>restraint</b> on resale <b>prices.</b> The Restrictive Practices Court in 1962 had accepted that the abandonment of the Agreement would deprive the public of a substantial benefit and that, therefore, it could be retained. By the late 1990 s, however, the Court was persuaded {{that there had been}} a material change of circumstances in the industry (in production costs, in the length of economic production runs, and in the structure of retailing) and that as a result, the arguments accepted in 1962 were no longer valid. In particular, the main supporter of the Agreement, the Publishers Association, had decided it could no longer defend it. The Court decided that the Agreement should be struck down.
