Furthermore, ASA, GSH and their redox ratios (ASC/DHA and GSH/GSSG) enhanced with SA pretreatments.

40|$|Proline {{accumulation}} {{is responsible}} for stress adaptation in many plants. To distinguish the involvement of two proline synthetic pathways, the virus induced gene silencing (VIGS) system that silenced the expression of genes encoding Delta(1) -pyrroline- 5 -carboxylate synthetase (P 5 CS; EC: 1. 5. 1. 12) and ornithine-delta-aminotransferase (OAT; EC 2. 6. 1. 13) was performed, separately or concomitantly, in four-week-old Nicotiana benthamiana. Leaf discs of VIGS-treated tobacco were subjected {{to the treatment of}} drought, abscisic acid (ABA), or polyethylene glycol (PEG). The treated leaf discs were then collected for the determination of mRNA, chlorophyll, proline and polyamine level. Under drought stress or PEG treatment, most proline accumulation was inhibited in P 5 CS-silenced plants and only a small portion was inhibited in OAT-silenced plants under drought stress and no inhibition was observed under PEG treatment. Under ABA treatment, proline accumulation was inhibited completely in P 5 CS-silenced plants but unaffected in OAT-silenced plants. The degradation of chlorophyll was enhanced in P 5 CS-silenced plants but retarded in OAT-silenced <b>plants</b> under <b>PEG</b> treatment. Under ABA treatment, the degradation of chlorophyll was unaffected in both P 5 CS-silenced and OAT-silenced plants. The increase of polyamine level was unaffected in P 5 CS-silenced plants but increased in OAT-silenced <b>plants</b> under <b>PEG</b> treatment. Under ABA treatment, the increase of polyamine level was unaffected in P 5 CS-silenced plants but the polyamine level was increased later in OAT-silenced plants. Therefore, P 5 CS {{plays a major role in}} proline accumulation under drought, PEG, or ABA treatment, while OAT plays a minor role in drought or PEG treatment and does not participate in ABA treatment. OAT appears to have a close relationship with the regulation of polyamine levels in PEG and ABA treatments. (C) 2011 Elsevier Masson SAS. All rights reserved...|$|R

30|$|In summary, {{exposure}} of A. aucheri plant to drought stress induced H 2 O 2, MDA, electrolyte leakage and elevated {{the activity of}} CAT, POD APX, SOD and GR.

Alleviating effects of SA pretreatments in A. aucheri <b>plant</b> exposed to <b>PEG</b> could be associated with the promotion of antioxidative enzyme activities and ascorbate–glutathione cycle resulted in tolerance to PEG stress.

40|$|Medicinal and {{aromatic}} {{plants such as}} peppermint (Mentha x piperita), sweet basil (Ocimum basilicum) and salvia (Salvia deserta) have great importance in the global context due to the demand of the food, chemical, and pharmaceutical industries. Peppermint is used by folk medicine and is grown mainly for essential oil extraction. The study investigated whether osmotic stress induced by two polyethyleneglycol (PEG) levels, in a short time, in peppermint changes the physiological pattern, anatomy, leaf ultrastructure and essential oil content and composition. The results indicated that osmotic stress responses were dose dependent, as <b>plants</b> subjected to <b>PEG</b> 50 g L- 1 maintained structural features and metabolic functions {{similar to those of}} control plants. <b>Plants</b> exposed to <b>PEG</b> 100 g L- 1 showed anatomical changes and ultrastructural damage as degradation and organelles lysis, which are in agreement with the low leaf water potential, gas exchange reduction, increase of total sugars, and activity of antioxidant enzymes. These plants showed lower content and quality of essential oil. Sweet basil, an important medicinal plant used mainly in culinary arts, was grown in a greenhouse using both organic and conventional fertilization systems with two nitrogen rates each (150 and 250 kg N/ha). The results showed that the highest fresh weight was obtained from the plants grown with conventional fertilizer at a rate of 250 kg N/ha. The treatments did not affect the essential oil content, yield, and composition and linalool was the major compound found in the study. The results showed that regardless of fertilizer, organic or conventional, there was no change in the composition of the oil. The bioprospecting conducted with S. deserta roots identified the presence of four diterpenes with biological activities.

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} {{was to assess the}} {{efficacy}} of polyethylene glycol (PEG) for measuring tannin content in leaves of species, Acacia karroo, Acacia nilotica, Acacia tortilis, Acacia galpinii, Acacia sieberiana, Acacia hebeclada, and Acacia rhemniana. In addition, in vitro dry matter and organic matter digestibility of the browse leaves were assessed. Young leaves from the species were collected from five different trees of each species at the University of Limpopo in April 2002, and their capacity to bind PEG was compared using a completely randomized design. PEG (MW 4000) was added at ratios of <b>plant</b> material: <b>PEG</b> solution (w/v) of 1 : 05, 1 : 10, 1 : 15, 1 : 20 and 1 : 25. The ratio of 1 : 20 (w/v) resulted in the best response in terms of tannin precipitated compared to the other ratios. The PEG binding capacity of Acacia species was found to be high ranging from 12. 73 to 28. 82 % dry matter, in direct response to the proportion of tannin content in the leaves. Dry matter and organic matter digestibility varied from 345. 4 to 534. 2 and 254. 4 to 473. 9 g/kg DM, respectively, for all species and were negatively correlated to PEG-binding capacity. A. hebeclada, A. sieberiana and A. galpinii had trace levels of total phenolics, A. tortilis contained approximately 90 g/kg DM of total phenolics whilst A. karroo, A. nilotica and A. rhemniana had intermediate amounts.

30|$|Antioxidative enzyme {{activities}} plays vital {{roles in}} drought tolerance {{by reduction of}} ROS. Exposure of A. aucheri <b>plant</b> to <b>PEG</b> led to increase with some variation in antioxidative enzyme activity including CAT, APX, POD, SOD and GR. The present results are also supported by previous observations in several plant species such as cucumber (Li et al. 2011), alfalfa (Wang et al. 2009), Kentucky bluegrass (Bian and Jiang 2009) and cotton (Sekmen et al. 2014). SOD catalyzes the conversion of superoxide radicals to O 2 and H 2 O 2, while CAT, POD and APX catalyze dismutation reactions of H 2 O 2 into H 2 O (Mittler 2002). In this study, SA pretreatments positively changed antioxidative enzyme activities compared to non SA-pretreated <b>plants</b> under <b>PEG</b> stress. In case of CAT, APX and GR, similar increase was obtained at two SA concentrations, while it was different to the other enzymes. It seemed that SA {{had no effect on}} APX activity under low level of PEG (2 %) but it was effective in 4 % PEG. This result may indicate that the increase in APX activity without SA have been sufficient to cope with oxidative stress under low PEG stress, while SA has improved CAT activity in this condition due to low activity. Under PEG stress, SA at 0.01  mM concentration stimulated SOD activity while POD enzyme was induced by 0.1  mM SA pretreatment. It probably reflects different influences on SOD and POD activity under in vitro condition. Generally, Positive effects of SA pretreatment on antioxidant enzymes in this study is in accordance with the findings obtained in sensitive and tolerant maize cultivars to drought (Saruhan et al. 2012). Furthermore, it has been previously reported that SA alleviates drought stress by induction of antioxidant enzymes such as CAT, APX, SOD, POD and GR (Habibi 2012; Kadioglu et al. 2011). It seemed that the increase of antioxidative enzyme activities by SA pretreatment, as a potential mechanism against water deficiency, promoted the ability of A. aucheri in ROS scavenging and resulting in a better resistance to PEG stress. Notably, our results also revealed that SA pretreatments inhibited CAT and POD activity in non-stressed condition. It has been proved that SA prevented CAT and POD activities and increased ROS accumulation (Horváth et al. 2002; Khokon et al. 2011). On the other hand, SA pretreatment with temporary inhibition of CAT and POD led to increase of H 2 O 2 level in A. aucheri. H 2 O 2, as a signal molecule, induced an adapting mechanism by activation of antioxidative enzymes in PEG condition leading to stress resistance. Additionally, our data indicated that plant exposed to 2 % PEG without SA exhibited higher APX activity without significant change in activity of CAT which could be explained by differences in affinity for H 2 O 2 as substrate of CAT and APX. On the other hand, the H 2 O 2 content in plants grown in 2 % PEG only is sufficient to increase APX activity because this enzyme has high affinity with H 2 O 2. Unlike APX, CAT has low affinity with H 2 O 2, thereby only removing the high concentration of H 2 O 2 (Willekens et al. 1997). Noticeably, both concentrations of SA had similar effects on some antioxidant enzymes as targets under the same levels of in vitro PEG treatment.|$|R

We isolated osppdka cDNA, which encodes a cytosolic rice PPDK isoform of 96. 6 kDa, that corresponded to the ABA-induced protein from roots. Western blot analysis showed a PPDK induction in roots of rice seedlings during gradual drying, cold, high salt and mannitol treatment, indicating a water deficit response. PPDK was also induced in the roots and sheath of submerged rice seedlings, and in etiolated rice seedlings exposed to an oxygen-free Na atmosphere, which indicated a low-oxygen stress response. None of the stress treatments induced PPDK protein accumulation in the lamina of green rice seedlings. Ppdk transcripts were found to accumulate in roots of submerged seedlings, concomitant with the induction of alcohol dehydrogenase I. Low-oxygen stress triggered an increase in PPDK activity in roots and etiolated rice seedlings, accompanied by increases in phosphoenolpyruvate carboxylase and malate dehydrogenase activities.

It is, however, unclear if the application of even gentle methods like freeze drying (lyophilization) affects the results in comparison to fresh material. Therefore, an experiment with the gas-pressure transducer technique, simulating ruminal fermentation dynamics in vitro, was conducted to investigate the effect of freeze drying on the ruminal nutrient degradability of three tropical multipurpose shrub legumes. Leaves of the CT shrubs Calliandra calothyrsus and Flemingia macrophylla and of the CT-free shrub Cratylia argentea were tested either in fresh form or lyophilized. In order to simulate practical feeding conditions, the legume leaves were incubated together with Brachiaria humidicola (1 : 2) for 144 h. Additionally, incubations were carried out either with or without polyethylene glycol (PEG) to be able to separate effects either dependent or independent of the CT. Only few differences were found between fresh and lyophilized leaves. These included that the proportion of apparently undegraded nitrogenous compounds was higher in fresh than in lyophilized leaves of Flemingia macrophylla, and freeze drying had a limited influence on volatile fatty acid production in Calliandra calothyrsus. The variables related to degradation dynamics (i. e., total gas production, the time until the point of inflection, apparent dry matter degradability), however, were not influenced. There was also no difference between CT and non-CT plants in that respect, as is also obvious from the lack of interactions of state of the <b>plant</b> material and <b>PEG</b> addition.

In PEG, maximum percentage germination were near 100 % for C. obtusifolia and D. lasiophylla and 75 % for C. floribunda. Respectively, the water potentials for maximum germination were from 0 to - 1 bar, from 0 to - 5 bars, and at - 5 bars. In moist paper, however, C. floribunda had near 100 % germination. In the three soils, the three species had near or equal to 100 % germination and their radicle grew more than in PEG. The rate of germination tended to be faster in soil than in PEG. However, it was affected by both soil and seed characteristics. So, germination was slower in Canelo, a pH 4, clay soil, {{as well as for}} the large-seeded C. obtusifolia, may be due to the reduction in the soil water conductivity at the seed-soil interface. It is suggested that leakage of solutes and spoilage of seeds as well as rapid water uptake at high water potentials, resulted in low germination of C. floribunda in <b>PEG.</b> <b>Plants</b> of C. floribunda and D. lasiophylla did not decrease their stomatal conductance or transpiration under high water stress, and their leaf water and osmotic potentials were sharply reduced.

40|$|Protein-resistant ("non-fouling") {{surfaces}} {{are particularly important}} in many fields such as medical engineering, dentistry, pharmaceutical processes, bioprocessing, dairy and food manufacturing. Poly(ethylene glycol) (PEG) immobilized onto surfaces {{has been shown to}} confer high resistance to protein adsorption. The reasons for variable performance and optimal protein repellency of PEG layers {{have been the subject of}} much discussion; however there remains no general consensus on the molecular mechanisms underlying the protein resistance achieved with PEG coatings. The main objective of this study was to inhibit protein adsorption onto a stainless steel surface. This objective requires an exploration of the mechanisms of protein adsorption on a stainless steel surface and how these mechanisms are modified when a surface inhibits the adsorption of proteins. The stainless steel surface has been chosen as a substrate as it is a commonly used material in many relevant applications such as in the dairy industry, in food processing and in clinical uses. In order to elucidate the mechanisms of protein-PEG interactions the adsorption of lysozyme, β-casein, apo α-lactalbumin, holo α-lactalbumin and β- lactoglobulin onto various PEG-grafted surfaces was explored. The adsorption was conducted at room temperature and at 40 C. The modification of bare SS surfaces and adsorption kinetics of proteins on unmodified and modified surfaces (i. e. bare stainless steel and PEG surfaces) has been done in-situ and studied by means of a quartz crystal microbalance with dissipation sensing (QCM-D). The merit of the modification methods studied, compared to those of most published methods is that the process of modification is simple and easy, being done simply by passing a solution over the surface. The methods also do not involve any harmful or hazardous chemicals and thus are safe to be used even in food processing <b>plants.</b> The <b>PEG</b> coated surfaces prepared in this study were able to inhibit adsorption of β-casein, α-lactalbumin (calcium enriched) and lysozyme proteins especially; the lowest adsorption of these achieved as a percentage of that on bare stainless steel, β- casein, 45 %, holo α-lactalbumin, 11 % and lysozyme, 1 %. By contrast, and unexpectedly, PEG molecules enhanced the adsorption of apo α-lactalbumin (the form without calcium). It is suggested that the PEG to apo α- lactalbumin hydrophobic interaction plays a dominant role which leads to protein aggregation at the surface, for this latter observation. The results have shown that protein stability (i. e. whether it is a soft or a hard protein) greatly influenced the inhibition performance of PEG surfaces. It is apparently more difficult to prevent the adsorption of soft proteins than hard proteins. This appears to be because soft proteins tend to denature regardless of the surface properties (i. e. hydrophilic or hydrophobic) and attach more effectively in their unfolded state. The results also indicated that higher PEG grafting density is not necessarily reflected in better protein inhibition. At the end of the project, a novel method of surface modification was developed. In this method, stainless steel surfaces were modified by coating the surface with a protein layer (as a base) then followed by the attachment of PEG molecules. Interestingly, the method developed showed an excellent potential for preventing further protein adsorption at room and body temperatures. The adsorption of β-casein, lysozyme, holo α-lactalbumin and β-lactoglobulin on the SS-lysozyme- PEG surfaces was down to about 3, 1, 4 and 0. 4 %, respectively compared to that on the bare surface. More interestingly and surprisingly also, there was almost zero adsorption on those surfaces of mixed protein and single protein solutions at the concentration found in milk. The method is believed to have the potential to be applied in the pharmaceutical industry, in the biosensor field and in artificial medical implants with some modifications perhaps to suit the application. The modelling results demonstrated negative free energy changes on adsorption, consistent with the studied proteins being thermodynamically favoured to adsorb on bare SS. The adsorption of proteins was an endothermic process. The proteins also showed large positive entropy changes on adsorption, indicating adsorption-induced denaturation mechanisms (especially apo α-lactalbumin protein). At high temperatures and concentrations, the adsorption was governed first by diffusion and later by surface kinetics, whereas under lower temperature (i. e. room temperature) and low concentration conditions (i. e. 0. 1 g / L) the adsorption was able to be described solely by surface-reactions...|$|R
