Related to this, it has been observed that, given an end-to-end video distribution network, it is the last networking segment ending to terminal that has the dominant role in the provision of end-user performance. On the other hand, the rest of the video distribution chain can be optimized such to reduce the power consumption under the requirements of provision of specific Quality of Service (QoS) parameters. The paper first provides an overview of VDNs, which is followed by a short presentation of the CONVINcE project.

40|$|It is well {{documented}} {{that global warming is}} unequivocal. Dairy production systems are considered as important sources of greenhouse gas emissions; however, {{little is known about the}} sensitivity and vulnerability of these production systems themselves to climate warming. This review brings different aspects of dairy cow production in Central Europe into focus, with a holistic approach to emphasize potential future consequences and challenges arising from climate change. With the current understanding of the effects of climate change, it is expected that yield of forage per hectare will be influenced positively, whereas quality will mainly depend on water availability and soil characteristics. Thus, the botanical composition of future grassland should include species that are able to withstand the changing conditions (e. g. lucerne and bird's foot trefoil). Changes in nutrient concentration of forage plants, elevated heat loads and altered feeding patterns of animals may influence rumen physiology. Several promising nutritional strategies are available to lower potential negative impacts of climate change on dairy cow nutrition and performance. Adjustment of feeding and drinking regimes, diet composition and additive supplementation can contribute to the maintenance of adequate dairy cow nutrition and <b>performance.</b> <b>Provision</b> of adequate shade and cooling will reduce the direct effects of heat stress. As estimated genetic parameters are promising, heat stress tolerance as a functional trait may be included into breeding programmes. Indirect effects of global warming on the health and welfare of animals seem to be more complicated and thus are less predictable. As the epidemiology of certain gastrointestinal nematodes and liver fluke is favourably influenced by increased temperature and humidity, relations between climate change and disease dynamics should be followed closely. Under current conditions, climate change associated economic impacts are estimated to be neutral if some form of adaptation is integrated. Therefore, it is essential to establish and adopt mitigation strategies covering available tools from management, nutrition, health and plant and animal breeding to cope with the future consequences of climate change on dairy farming...|$|E

It has been determined that one of the principal factors of the solution of the non-profitable commercial activity is the selection of the commercial enterprise’s location. It should be taken into consideration that a maximum adaptation to the territorial organization of trade objects should be created to stereotypes and behaviors of consumers and their needs. The objective of this research paper is to analyze the economic attractiveness of location for retailers. The aim is to determine the characteristics of commercial enterprises in the market and implementation of individual measures of the effective functioning of enterprises based on the analysis of main characteristics for their localization. As a result of the analysis of the main features for localization of 367 trade enterprises of Kharkov the distribution of investigated objects into groups depending on the orientation of the mass consumer or narrow market segment was carried. It has been proved that the studied commercial items, depending on the place of localization have different conditions and opportunities for effective functioning. The analysis of financial and economic indicators showed that a necessary condition for improving the trading activities of retail facilities is the application of individual approach, taking into account the peculiarities of localization, which will form the basis of development strategy based on the economic and mathematical models depending on the amount of income received from financial and economic indicators. Implementation of this model into practicalactivity using the proposed measures will lead to the improvement of trading activity and profitability of enterprises...|$|E

40|$|The project’s {{research}} aim was {{the assessment of}} the effectiveness of the current performance appraisal system (PAS) of the Cyprus Tourism Organisation (CTO) in relation to the enhancement of individual and organisational performance and the project’s outcome was the production of suitable recommendations for the attention of the Board of Directors, the Management and the Trade Unions. The recommendations will assist CTO in changing the current PAS for purposes of enhancing individual and organisational performance i. e. the introduction of an effective PAS at CTO. The change of the current PAS was explored and it is feasible because the inhibitors of change can be mitigated. Through the implementation of the project’s recommendations, the stakeholders will benefit since the recommended effective PAS will transform the culture and enhance the employees’ and CTO’s performance and that will reflect on tourism and the economy of Cyprus. The enhancement of performance and the added value at all levels are particularly important and relevant in today’s economic climate. Through the availability of the project to the academic and practitioner community, other researchers and similar organisations (e. g. the government and public sector organisations in Cyprus) will benefit since they {{will have the opportunity to}} refer to the project and borrow ideas and conduct further research and extend existing knowledge. The project can be considered as an original contribution to the knowledge and practice of performance appraisals because it is unique (a type of research that nobody else conducted before). The research approach that was used was that of the case study. The project was a qualitative study (in depth analysis and understanding) and the research techniques that were used were the following: literature, studies of the government and other public sector organisations in Cyprus, organisational documentation-regulations of the current PAS, insider/practitioner-researcher perspective, interviews, questionnaire (the opinion of the CTO employees was obtained through the interviews and questionnaire). The information that was collected from the above sources (triangulation) was analysed both quantitatively and qualitatively. It was concluded that the performance appraisals were not employed as they should under the current PAS (both inherent and implementation weaknesses). Most of the participants believed that the current PAS was ineffective as it did not enhance their performance, motivation, job satisfaction, ownership, responsibility or commitment and it needed to change. Most of the participants believed in the factors of an effective PAS. Most of the participants believed that the main factors of an effective PAS (feedback, participation, goals) were not present under the current PAS. In consequence, the absence of the above factors (ineffective PAS) has not led to the enhancement of most of the participants’ performance. The features of the recommended PAS are the following: -Introduction of the goals method for purposes of assessing performance (the goals will be jointly set and agreed, “smart”, consistent with the organisational goals and revised when necessary). -Measurement of performance against the goals through fact-based evidence. -Assessment of performance by suitable appraisers (their selection will be determined by the tasks and position of each appraisee). -Examination of appeals by other independent persons only (senior employees who will be educated and trained) who will ratify or amend the performance assessments conducted by the appraisers. -Introduction of the rating scales and 360 degree feedback methods (in combination) for purposes of development. The selection of the most suitable 360 degree feedback respondents (superiors, subordinates, peers, business associates) will be determined by the tasks and position of each appraisee. The usefulness of the rating scales method can be maximised through the following: sufficient scale, explanation of the scale, development of the assessment criteria according to the job requirements of each position and assignment of weights according to the significance of the criteria, specific, clearly defined and explained criteria, justification of the ratings with examples. -Participation of the appraisees in their performance and development assessments through self-assessment. -Consideration and discussion of the assessment results of the performance and development methods during the appraisal interview for purposes of drafting an agreed action plan in relation to the appraisees’ performance improvement and further development. -Introduction of a formal and informal feedback mechanism. The informal feedback mechanism (on a continuous basis) will consist of the following: communication, coaching, monitoring of performance. The formal feedback mechanism (once or twice a year) will consist of the following: assessments for purposes of performance and development, appraisal interview, agreed action plan for the future. -Education and training of the appraisers and the appraisees for purposes of implementing the formal and informal feedback mechanisms. -Computerisation of the recommended PAS for purposes of administering the system more effectively and efficiently. -The recommended PAS will be linked to a new reward system but the two systems will be separate. The features of the new reward system will be the following: the rewards will be based on the appraisees’ performance (performance assessments under the recommended PAS), the rewards will not be awarded at the same time as the assessments of <b>performance,</b> <b>provision</b> of non-monetary rewards to all the appraisees who will meet their performance targets, provision of monetary rewards to the appraisees with the highest performance (ranking). -Monitoring and evaluation of the recommended PAS (as well as the new reward system) by the Management, the employees (appraisers and appraisees) and the Trade Unions on an ongoing basis and making amendments if necessary...|$|E

40|$|Understanding how parental {{expenditure}} reflects food {{availability and}} influences reproductive output {{is a key}} part of studies of breeding <b>performance.</b> <b>Provisioning</b> behaviour is an important aspect of parental expenditure. We show that Macaroni Penguins Eudyptes chrysolophus have clear sex-specific differences in provisioning behaviour. Females provision chicks throughout rearing and at higher rates than males, which only participate in the later stages. Female provisioning is consistent throughout chick-rearing and appears to relate to a threshold rate governing whether or not chicks survive. The additional expenditure by males (but not females) during the creche period influenced chick growth and fledging mass of survivors. We suggest a very simple model to account for these sex-specific differences and effects. Interannual variation in parental expenditure resulted in differences in reproductive output between years. Years of lowest expenditure resulted in lowest growth rate of chicks, Sex-specific differences in provisioning were similar among years, however, with a consistent proportion of expenditure by males...|$|R
