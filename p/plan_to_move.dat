5|$|The {{birth of}} her {{daughter}} in September 1857, however, began to reduce the level of her activism. Stone had made preliminary arrangements for the 1857 national convention {{to be held in}} Providence, but because she {{would not be able to}} attend it, she handed responsibility to Susan B. Anthony and Thomas Wentworth Higginson. When the Panic of 1857 disrupted Anthony’s <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the convention to Chicago, Stone made the announcement that the next National Woman’s Rights Convention would be in May 1858. Anthony helped Stone arrange the 1858 convention and then took sole responsibility for the 1859 meeting. Elizabeth Cady Stanton took charge of the 1860 convention.|$|E
5|$|In 1970, the Ebenezer Avery House was {{in danger}} of being torn down to {{construct}} apartments and it was purchased by R. Stanton Avery. R. Stanton Avery purchased the property with the intention of turning it over to the Avery Memorial Association. Edwin Park, an architect, assessed the house as in need of extensive reconstruction and the association discussed the <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the house to Fort Griswold Battlefield State Park. A meeting held on the association on July 24, 1971, was held to discuss the movement plan which involved disassembling and reassembling the house at its new location. The project to move the house was a shared cost between R. Stanton Avery and the Avery Memorial Association. By the 1972 meeting, the total cost of the relocation was $43,000 and the act provoked interest from the State of Connecticut. The house was donated to the State of Connecticut for use as a historic house museum.|$|E

The city {{had already been}} considering a new headquarters for their police department and studied whether {{to build a new}} city hall in Downtown Bellevue. On November 25, 2002, the City of Bellevue agreed to purchase the Qwest building for $29 million, primarily to house the police and fire departments after $33 million in renovations. The city council approved a preliminary <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> other city offices into the Qwest building in March 2003, citing lower maintenance costs and plentiful capacity in the new building. The plan was finalized in July, estimating the total cost of renovation at $102.4 million (including $29 million used to purchase the building in 2002), and returning the city hall to downtown {{for the first time in}} 25 years. To finance the project, the city issued $103 million in 40-year municipal bonds, which were partially refunded in 2012.|$|E

5|$|Little {{progress}} {{had been}} made on the memorial by 1926. While some debate occurred in respect to the form that the memorial would take, {{the focus of the}} discussions concerned the location of the memorial, and this centred on the future of Government House {{and the role of the}} Governor. A number of left-wing politicians argued that the grounds of Government House should be turned over to the State and used to build the memorial while the conservatives desired to retain the status quo. By 1925 the National War Memorial committee was prepared to accept the Government House grounds as the site of the memorial, but they delayed making an announcement. This proved to be fortuitous, as legal issues prevented the plan from going ahead. Instead a portion of the grounds, located at the corner of North Terrace and Kintore Avenue, was put aside for the purpose. (The <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> the Governor and to use the grounds as part of a larger war memorial were revisited, over 80 years later, in 2007).|$|E
5|$|The book {{is divided}} into ten subject-related chapters. The first chapter {{provides}} an introduction to how Stursberg entered the CBC scene, how he viewed his role replacing the retiring Harold Redekopp as the executive {{vice president in charge}} of English services, and previews what challenges he would encounter. The second chapter covers his experience entering CBC senior management amid contract negotiations with its union, the resulting lock out during summer 2005, and the relations between what he labeled the Gang of Four (senior management) and the Central Committee (union representatives). In the third chapter, Entertainment, he explains his plan for re-orienting CBC television towards entertainment which would use audience numbers to gauge success. He cancelled critically acclaimed shows (Da Vinci's City Hall, This Is Wonderland, and Opening Night) which had low ratings and ordered what he expected would be more audience-friendly shows. Beginning in summer 2006, the first new show under Stursberg's strategy, , received very low ratings and was quickly cancelled. That Autumn's schedule, though, was successful, introducing Little Mosque on the Prairie, The Tudors, Heartland. The nest year's schedule introduced the successful The Border and Being Erica but also the unsuccessful MVP and jPod. Strusberg's move of Marketplace to Friday nights resulted in higher ratings but his <b>plan</b> <b>to</b> <b>move</b> The National to 11pm was denied by the CBC board of directors. In the fourth chapter, The French, he details his relationship with his French counterpart, the style differences between English and French television shows, the disproportionate funding given to the French services, and the lack of CBC Board members who can understand French. As a means of trying to bridge the two cultures, he ordered English versions of the popular Quebec shows Rumours and Sophie but both received low ratings in English Canada.|$|E
