5|$|For the Internet, the <b>physical</b> <b>medium</b> {{and data}} link {{protocol}} can vary several times as packets traverse the globe. This is because the Internet places no constraints on what <b>physical</b> <b>medium</b> or {{data link protocol}} is used. This leads {{to the adoption of}} media and protocols that best suit the local network situation. In practice, most intercontinental communication will use the Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) protocol (or a modern equivalent) on top of optic fiber. This is because for most intercontinental communication the Internet shares the same infrastructure as the public switched telephone network.|$|E
5|$|Sir Arthur Conan Doyle a spiritualist who {{supported}} the mediumship of Home stated that he was unusual in that he had four different types of mediumship: direct voice (the ability to let spirits audibly speak); trance speaker (the ability to let spirits speak through oneself); clairvoyant (ability to see things {{that are out of}} view); and <b>physical</b> <b>medium</b> (moving objects at a distance, levitation, etc., which was the type of mediumship in which he had no equal).|$|E

He {{discovered}} that many <b>physical</b> <b>mediums</b> had utilized sleight of hand trickery. He authored the paper A Survey of American Slate-Writing Mediumship which was almost 300 pages. In this paper he exposed the fraudulent methods of the slate-writing medium Pierre L. O. A. Keeler. He later became a believer in psychic phenomena but remained skeptical of spiritualism.|$|R
25|$|To explain stellar {{aberration}} in {{the context}} of an aether-based theory of light was regarded as more problematic. As the aberration relied on relative velocities, and the measured velocity was dependent on the motion of the Earth, the aether had to be remaining stationary with respect to the star as the Earth moved through it. This meant that the Earth could travel through the aether, a <b>physical</b> <b>medium,</b> with no apparent effect – precisely the problem that led Newton to reject a wave model in the first place.|$|E
25|$|In {{the same}} way, {{postulating}} the aether {{is more complex}} than transmission of light through a vacuum. At the time, however, all known waves propagated through a <b>physical</b> <b>medium,</b> and it seemed simpler to postulate the existence of a medium than to theorize about wave propagation without a medium. Likewise, Newton's idea of light particles seemed simpler than Christiaan Huygens's idea of waves, so many favored it. In this case, as it turned out, neither the wave—nor the particle—explanation alone suffices, as light behaves like waves and like particles.|$|E
25|$|The {{link layer}} {{is used to}} move packets between the Internet layer {{interfaces}} of two different hosts on the same link. The processes of transmitting and receiving packets on a given link can be controlled both in the software device driver for the network card, {{as well as on}} firmware or specialized chipsets. These perform data link functions such as adding a packet header to prepare it for transmission, then actually transmit the frame over a <b>physical</b> <b>medium.</b> The TCP/IP model includes specifications of translating the network addressing methods used in the Internet Protocol to link layer addresses, such as Media Access Control (MAC) addresses. All other aspects below that level, however, are implicitly assumed to exist in the link layer, but are not explicitly defined.|$|E

25|$|Zero-point energy (ZPE) {{or ground}} state energy {{is the lowest}} {{possible}} energy that a quantum mechanical system may have. Unlike in classical mechanics, quantum systems constantly fluctuate in their lowest energy state due to the Heisenberg uncertainty principle. As well as atoms and molecules, the empty space of the vacuum has these properties. According to Quantum Field Theory the universe {{can be thought of}} not as isolated particles but continuous fluctuating fields: matter fields, whose quanta are fermions (i.e. leptons and quarks), and force fields, whose quanta are bosons (e.g. photons and gluons). All these fields have zero-point energy. These fluctuating zero-point fields lead to a kind of reintroduction of an aether in physics, since some systems can detect the existence of this energy. However this aether cannot {{be thought of as a}} <b>physical</b> <b>medium</b> if it is to be Lorentz invariant such that there is no contradiction with Einstein's theory of special relativity.|$|E
25|$|Ikenga (literally 'place of strength') is an alusi and a cult {{figure of}} the right hand and success found among the {{northern}} Igbo people. He is an icon of meditation exclusive to men and owners of the sculpture dedicate and {{refer to it as}} their 'right hand' which is considered instrumental to personal power and success. Ikenga is a source of encoded knowledge unraveled through psychological principles. The image of Ikenga comprises someone's chi ('personal god'), his ndichie (ancestors), aka Ikenga (right hand), ike (power) as well as spiritual activation through prayer and sacrifice. Igbo cultures value of resourcefulness and individualism in society utilises the concept of Ikenga to regulate the relationship between individuality and family relations and obligations, as well as free will and industriousness balanced with destiny decided persons chi. Ikenga acts as a <b>physical</b> <b>medium</b> to the consciousness and emphasises individual initiative through reflection and meditation. Success validates the Ikenga and the sculptures act as visual representation of a persons inner success, people give offerings in thanks to the Ikenga after providing energy to overcome any unwanted pre-life choices. These choices are {{at the hands of the}} persons earth bound spirit, mmuo, who chooses sex, type, and lifespan before incarnation. The successful Ikenga influenced the saying of well being 'íkéǹgàm kwụ̀ ọ̀tọ́ ta ta' meaning that 'my Ikenga stands upright today'. During festivals of Ogbalido or olili Ikenga ('feast of Ikenga') sculptures of him may be paraded around a village or displayed at the village centre if too monumental to transport. When a person does not become successful with hard work the Ikenga has 'fallen' and is seen as a sign of danger, if meditation and cajoling the Ikenga fails, the sculpture is 'thrown down' and broken which spiritually kills the Ikenga; a new one is carved to replace it.|$|E
500|$|In {{the example}} above, the [...] "free space channel" [...] has been divided into {{communications}} channels according to frequencies, and each channel is assigned a separate frequency bandwidth {{in which to}} broadcast radio waves.

500|$|The term [...] "channel" [...] has two {{different}} meanings. In one meaning, a channel is the <b>physical</b> <b>medium</b> that carries a signal between the transmitter and the receiver. Examples of this include the atmosphere for sound communications, glass optical fibers for {{some kinds of}} optical communications, coaxial cables for communications {{by way of the}} voltages and electric currents in them, and free space for communications using visible light, infrared waves, ultraviolet light, and radio waves. Coaxial cable types are classified by RG type or [...] "radio guide", terminology derived from World War II. The various RG designations are used to classify the specific signal transmission applications. This last channel is called the [...] "free space channel". The sending of radio waves {{from one place to another}} has nothing to do with the presence or absence of an atmosphere between the two. Radio waves travel through a perfect vacuum just as easily as they travel through air, fog, clouds, or any other kind of gas.|$|E
