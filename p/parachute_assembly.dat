50|$|Depending upon {{air density}} and the jumper’s total weight, the parachute’s {{average rate of}} descent is from 22 to 24 ft/s; total {{suspended}} weight limitation is 360 lb. The parachute is deployed using either a 15 or 20 ft static line, allowing the parachutist to be delivered by either C-130 or C-17 aircraft. The T-10D main parachute is a parabolic-shape and has a nominal diameter of 35 ft with 30 suspension lines. The entire assembly weighs 31 lb. Paratroopers can be dropped from an aircraft at a maximum speed of 173 mph, at a minimum of 500 ft. Maximum jump wind speed is 15 mph. The T-10D <b>Parachute</b> <b>assembly</b> consists of five components: pack tray, troop harness, deployment bag, risers, and canopy. The parachute has a combined service life of 16.5 years; service life is 12 years and shelf life is 4.5 years. The T-10D Parachute must be repacked every 120 days. The T-10D Parachute is made of nylon materials commonly used in the manufacturing of parachutes.|$|E

The mock Orion parachute compartment is dropped from an altitude of 25,000 feet from a C-130. Testing began in 2007. Drogue chutes deploy around 20,000 and 15,000 feet. Testing of the reefing staged parachutes includes partial failure instances including partial opening and complete failure of one of the three main parachutes. With only two chutes deployed the DTA lands at 33 feet per second, the maximum touchdown speed for Orion's design. Other related test vehicles include the now-defunct Orion Parachute Test Vehicle (PTV) and its replacement the Generation II Parachute Test Vehicle (PTV2). The drop test program has had several failures in 2007, 2008, and 2010. The new PTV was successfully tested February 29, 2012 deploying from a C-17. Ten drag chutes will drag the mockup's pallet from the aircraft for the drop at 25,000 feet. The landing parachute set of eight is known as the Capsule <b>Parachute</b> <b>Assembly</b> System (CPAS). The test examined air flow disturbance behind the mimicked full size vehicle and its effects on the parachute system. The PTV landed on the desert floor at 17 mph.

In this work, the effect of these factors on seam strength was studied using both Taguchi's design of experiment (TDOE) as well as an artificial neural network (ANN). In TDOE, two levels were chosen for the factors mentioned above. An L 8 design was adopted and an orthogonal array was generated. The contribution of each factor to seam strength was analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) and signal to noise ratio methods. From the analysis {{it was found that the}} fabric width, folding length of joint and interaction between the folding length of joint and the seam design affected seam strength significantly. Further, using TDOE, an optimal configuration of levels of factors was found. In order to contrast and compare the results from TDOE, an ANN was also used to predict seam strength using the above mentioned factors as inputs. The prediction from TDOE and ANN methodologies were compared with physical seam strength.

With the intention to gain more independency from the North American market and the inherent procurement and ITAR regulations problems, the European Space Agency (ESA) has taken initiative to contract industry for the development and built-up of a new European Recovery System (ERS) in 2006. For the design, manufacturing and qualification task sharing, a cooperation of DLR Moraba and the Kayser-Threde GmbH has been initialized. The ERS is designed to recover payloads of up to 450 kg mass and 17 inch (438 mm) diameter by a two-stage subsonic parachute system. It features a separating ogive nose tip with a forward deploying recovery <b>parachute.</b> The <b>assembly</b> incorporates a 3 : 1 fineness ratio ogive which forward portion is ejected exo-atmospherically to permit subsequent parachute recovery system operation.

The parachute system activation is controlled by barometric switches on the descent trajectory at a nominal altitude of 15 kft (4. 6 km) in the combination of an electronic timing activation unit (ignition unit). Together with the heat shield ejection the drogue parachute is deployed and the payload is mainly stabilized from flat spin and decelerated.

For the finite mass inflation of CPAS Main parachutes, the cluster is assumed to inflate nominally through the nominal fill time, at which point the skipping parachute continues inflating.

Cluster inflations are now simulated by modeling each parachute individually to better represent different inflation times and non-synchronous disreefing. The reconstruction procedure is tailored to either infinite mass or finite mass events based on measurable characteristics from the test data. Inflation parameters are determined from an automated optimization routine to reduce subjectivity.

This allows for capturing high-quality still photographs of the reefed skirt, suspension line, and canopy geometry. The over-inflation angles are synchronized with measured loads data in order to compute the tension force in the reefing line. The traditional reefing tension equation assumes radial symmetry, but cluster effects cause the reefed skirt of each parachute to elongate to a more elliptical shape. This effect was considered in evaluating multiple parachutes to estimate the semi-major and semi-minor axes.

All four CPAS parachute types were evaluated: Forward Bay Cover Parachutes (FBCPs), Drogues, Pilots, and Mains. Many tests used the missile-shaped Parachute Compartment Drop Test Vehicle (PCDTV) to obtain data at high airspeeds. Other tests used the Orion "boilerplate" Parachute Test Vehicle (PTV) to evaluate parachute performance in a representative heatshield wake. Drag data from both vehicles are normalized to a "capsule" forebody equivalent for Orion simulations. A separate database of PCDTV-specific performance is maintained to accurately predict flight tests.

The Engineering Development Unit (EDU) system deploys Drogue and Pilot parachutes via mortar, where an important metric is the muzzle velocity. This can be estimated using a high speed camera pointed along the mortar trajectory. The distance to the camera is computed from the apparent size of features of known dimension. This method was validated with a ground test and compares favorably with simulations. The second major photogrammetric product is measuring the geometry of the Main parachute cluster during steady-state descent using onboard cameras. This is challenging as the current test vehicles are suspended by a single-point attachment unlike earlier stable platforms suspended under a confluence fitting. The mathematical modeling of fly-out angles and projected areas has undergone significant revision.
