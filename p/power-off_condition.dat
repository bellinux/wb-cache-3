40|$|This thesis {{has three}} main purposes: 1. To {{establish}} an engineering computation procedure for predicting C[subscript M](c. g.) {{as a function}} of C[subscript L] and power conditions for a multi-engine monoplane of conventional configuration with tractor propellers mounted on and forward of the wing from a given curve of C[subscript M] {{as a function of}} C[subscript L] for the <b>power-off</b> <b>condition.</b> 2. To recommend aircraft configurations which will minimize destabilizing effect of power. 3. To provide a physical explanation of the effect of power on stability. Calculated C[subscript M] vs. C[subscript L] curves are compared with "matched-power" wind tunnel model test results. The agreement is good for all-right-hand rotation of propellers but unsatisfactory for other rotation modes. ...|$|E
40|$|An {{analysis}} of the static longitudinal and maneuvering stability and lateral controllability characteristics of the Pilatus "Heli-Porter" Model PC- 6 / 350 -H-l Airplane was conducted during the months of February, March, and April of 1966. This analysis was conducted at the Forrestal Airport, Princeton, New Jersey by graduate students of the Department of Aerospace and Mechanical Sciences of Princeton University. The "Heli-Porter" was tested at 8, 000 feet in the cruise and approach configurations both for power-on and <b>power-off</b> <b>conditions</b> to determine its stick fixed and stick free static stability characteristics. The maneuvering stability and stick forces per "g" gradient of the aircraft were evaluated for the power-on cruise condition; while its lateral performance was determined for the power-on cruise and approach configurations. From these evaluations, the "Heli-Porter" {{was found to have}} adequate stick fixed and stick free stability in the cruise and approach configurations both for the power-on and the <b>power-off</b> <b>conditions.</b> The aircraft also has excellent roll performance and a high level of maneuvering stability. However, its stick force per "g" and control forces in general are considered to be excessive if prolonged periods of maneuvering flight are anticipated. It was found that the c. g. limits set by the manufacturer were well forward of any neutral and maneuver points determined during this test. An analytical study was also conducted and showed very close agreement with flight test results. [URL] United States Nav...|$|R
40|$|The Ares I ascent {{aerodynamics}} {{database for}} Design Cycle 3 (DAC- 3) was built from wind-tunnel test results and CFD solutions. The wind tunnel results {{were used to}} build the baseline response surfaces for wind-tunnel Reynolds numbers at <b>power-off</b> <b>conditions.</b> The CFD solutions were used to build increments to account for Reynolds number effects. We calculate the validation errors for the primary CFD code results at wind tunnel Reynolds number <b>power-off</b> <b>conditions</b> {{and would like to}} be able to use those errors to predict the validation errors for the CFD increments. However, the validation errors are large compared to the increments. We suggest a way forward that is consistent with common practice in wind tunnel testing which is to assume that systematic errors in the measurement process and/or the environment will subtract out when increments are calculated, thus making increments more reliable with smaller uncertainty than absolute values of the aerodynamic coefficients. A similar practice has arisen for the use of CFD to generate aerodynamic database increments. The basis of this practice is the assumption of strong correlation of the systematic errors inherent in each of the results used to generate an increment. The assumption of strong correlation is the inferential link between the observed validation uncertainties at wind-tunnel Reynolds numbers and the uncertainties to be predicted for flight. In this paper, we suggest a way to estimate the correlation coefficient and demonstrate the approach using code-to-code differences that were obtained for quality control purposes during the Ares I CFD campaign. Finally, since we can expect the increments to be relatively small compared to the baseline response surface and to be typically of the order of the baseline uncertainty, we find that it is necessary to be able to show that the correlation coefficients are close to unity to avoid overinflating the overall database uncertainty with the addition of the increments...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} was to design a remotely piloted vehicle which is capable of gathering in-flight pressure distribution data on a lifting test specimen, and then test the design by constructing a subscale demonstrator, to prove the flight worthiness of the concept. The technology demonstrator was scheduled for takeoff at approximately, 7 : 20 AM on Thursday April 27 th. There was a light wind from the southeast. The plane was hand-launched and made an initial dip, most likely due to the poor trim conditions at launch. It then began to climb and bank into a left turn. The aircraft climbed to an altitude of approximately 150 ft and circled. The plane flew for several minutes and at times appeared to bump around, which was due to thermal activity disrupting the flight of the aircraft. The aircraft was brought slowly down in a <b>power-off</b> <b>condition</b> and glided in for a belly landing and landed without incident. Results of the flight test proved the general capability of the design to maintain flight stability throughout the take off, cruise, turning, and landing flight regimes. We {{were not able to}} demonstrate stability with the test specimen in place as the control surfaces designed to counteract the instabilities induced in the static system, winglets and ailerons, were not included...|$|E
40|$|A wind-tunnel {{investigation}} {{has been carried}} out to determine the static longitudinal stability ad trim characteristics of a sweptback-wtig jet-transport model equipped with an external-flow ~et-au-ted flap. The investigation included tests of the mdel {{to determine the effects of}} wing position, vertical position of the horizontal tail, and size of the horizontal *il. The results of the investigation indicated that static longitudinal stability and trim could be achieved up to a lift coefficient of about 6 with a horizontal tail having an area of about 25 percent of the wing area. In order to achieve this result, it was necessary to locate the horizontal tail well above the chord plane of the wing and to incorporate both variable incidence and an elevator. For the flap-down, <b>power-off</b> <b>condition,</b> the downwash factor was found to be relatively large (0. 8 to 0. 9). The downwash factor decreased with increasing nmmentum coeffi-cient, the greatest reduction occurring for the low tail position. In order to obtain a given amunt of stability, larger tail areas were there-fore required for the low tail position than for the high tail position. Results of calculations comparing the relative merits of various trim devices for use on airplanes equipped with jet-augmented flaps indicated thst a fixed. cansrd surface utilizing Jet augmentation would provide longitudinal trim and stability at a given lift coefficient for less overall jet thrust than a conventional tail, a free-floating canard sur-face, or a trim-~et arrangement.

40|$|At {{the request}} of the Air Materiel Command, Army Air Forces, an {{investigation}} of the low-speed, power-off, stability and control characteristics of the McDonnell XP- 85 airplane has been conducted in the Langley free-flight tunnel. The results of the portion of the investigation consisting of tests of a 1 / 10 -scale model to study the stability of the XP- 85 when attached to the trapeze and during retraction into the B- 36 bomb bay are presented herein. In the <b>power-off</b> <b>condition</b> the stability was satisfactory with all oscillations well damped and the nose-restraining collar could be placed in position without difficulty. In a simulated power-on condition the model had a constant-amplitude rolling and sidewise motion and when the collar was layered, a violent motion resulted if the collar struck the model but failed to hold it in the proper manner. Folding of the wings and retraction into the bomb bay offered no problem once the airplane was properly held by the collar. It is recommended that the power be cut immediately after hooking on and that a restricting mechanism be incorporated {{in the center of the}} trapeze to eliminate the sidewise motion. It also appears desirable to have the retracting procedure controlled by the XP- 85 pilot or an observer in the mother ship to insure that the parasite is in proper position after hooking up before bringing the collar down...|$|E

[ACCESS RESTRICTED TO THE UNIVERSITY OF MISSOURI AT AUTHOR'S REQUEST. ] Bistable compliant micro-structures offer a tremendous advantage in the industry today, as these structures have an ability to maintain their shape even in <b>power-off</b> <b>condition.</b> Bistable mechanisms implemented in MEMS devices are categorized as electrostatically and mechanically bistable elements. Electrostatically bistable devices exhibit pull-in behavior whereas mechanically bistable devices utilize snap-through phenomenon. A general approach is presented to develop a pin-jointed bistable compliant mechanism utilizing snap-through behavior. Exploiting the snap-through and the pull-in characteristics, the device operating voltages can be reduced drastically since the required switch-over voltage in MEMS devices is often too high. We also investigate the effect of non-critical forces on the structure which might lead to an operational failure of such mechanisms. The most general bistable mechanism consists of two constrained micro flexures (arch). These structures have a tendency to undergo large displacements/ rotations without exceeding the structural elastic limit. MATLAB based Finite Element Analysis package GESA is used to simulate the static and transient behavior of the micro structure as it completely accounts for the geometric nonlinearities. A fully nonlinear beam element is used in the analysis and the results are compared to a beam element with Von-Karman nonlinearity. The study also includes stability and bifurcation analysis and therefore buckling and post-buckling characteristics of the arch are studied thoroughly...|$|E
40|$|It is {{estimated}} that there are 85, 000 serious wheelchair accidents annually, of which 80 % are attributable to tips and falls. Despite the increasing trend in wheelchair accidents every year, there is little literature on the cause and prevention of these accidents. Test dummies provide an ethical and practical alternative to subjects when assessing the risks and prevention mechanisms of tips and falls in controlled studies. However, design criteria for anthropomorphic test devices (ATDs) {{were based on the}} response and tolerance data acquired from cadaver studies and human volunteers. Such cadavers are typically of advanced age, and have anthropometrics reflecting a healthy, unimpaired population. For that reason, use of ATDs in relatively low speed wheelchair studies may under estimate the risk of injury. The {{purpose of this study was}} to develop and validate a low speed, low impact test dummy for use in the study of the prevention of tips and falls from wheelchairs. A kinematic analysis comparing the trunk bending of a Hybrid III test dummy (HTD) to that of a wheelchair user during various braking trials served for validation. In addition, a dynamic model was used to determine underlying causes of the motion. Statistical differences were not found (p>. 05) in the peak trunk angular range of motion, velocity, and acceleration measures of a modified HTD over a range of wheelchair speeds and decelerations. This is promising evidence that the test dummy is a suitable surrogate for a wheelchair user in low speed dynamic studies. However, the HTD underestimated the motion of a wheelchair test pilot during the fast speed and <b>power-off</b> braking <b>condition.</b> A dynamic model consisting of a cart with an inverted pendulum was used to provide additional insight into the differences in motion. Although the model produced consistent values for damping and stiffness coefficients, evidence indicates that the functional form of the model may be incorrect. The model likely estimated properties for a wheelchair/rider system rather than only the rider. Further analysis showed an impingement occurring between the pelvis and thighs of the HTD. Removing the impingement will further increase the similarities between the HTD and test pilot...|$|R
