5|$|As critic Richard Roeper has stated, <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the strongest}} {{indicators}} {{of the influence of}} Sesame Street has been the enduring rumors and urban legends surrounding the show and its characters, especially those concerning Bert and Ernie.|$|E
5|$|Electronic devices {{make use}} of the transistor, <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most {{important}} inventions of the twentieth century, and a fundamental building block of all modern circuitry. A modern integrated circuit may contain several billion miniaturised transistors in a region only a few centimetres square.|$|E
5|$|In {{spite of}} their rivalry, the two sides {{previously}} contemplated ground-sharing {{as part of the}} SFA's unsuccessful bid to host Euro 2008. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> their most notable meetings was in the 1980 Scottish League Cup Final played at Dens Park when United won 3–0 to claim their second League Cup in successive seasons.|$|E

5|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Zobel's most {{fascinating}} inventions is the lattice filter section. This section is both constant resistance and flat response zero attenuation across the band, {{yet it is}} constructed out of inductors and capacitors. The only signal parameter it modifies is the phase of the signal at different frequencies.|$|E
5|$|During the 19th century, despite setbacks, financially tight {{times and}} the American Civil War, the College {{continued}} to expand. Seton Hall opened a military science department (forerunner to the ROTC program) {{during the summer of}} 1893, but this program was ultimately disbanded during the Spanish–American War. <b>Perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most pivotal events in the history of Seton Hall came in 1897 when Seton Hall's preparatory (high school) and college (undergraduate) divisions were permanently separated. By 1937, Seton Hall established a University College. This marked the first matriculation of women at Seton Hall. Seton Hall became fully coeducational in 1968. In 1948, Seton Hall was given a license by the FCC for WSOU-FM.|$|E
5|$|For a brief period, the Romans were in {{complete}} disarray. Their best armies in the peninsula were destroyed, the few remnants severely demoralized, {{and the only}} remaining consul (Varro) completely discredited. As the story goes, Rome declared a national day of mourning as {{there was not a}} single person who was not either related to or acquainted with a person who had died. The Romans became so desperate that they resorted to human sacrifice, twice burying people alive at the Forum of Rome and abandoning an oversized baby in the Adriatic Sea (<b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the last instances of human sacrifices by the Romans, apart from public executions of defeated enemies dedicated to Mars).|$|E

5|$|Symbolic {{behavior}} is, <b>perhaps,</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the most}} difficult aspects of modern human behavior to distinguish archaeologically. When searching for evidence of symbolic behavior in the MSA, there are three lines of evidence that can be considered: direct evidence reflecting concrete examples of symbols; indirect evidence reflecting behaviors {{that would have been}} used to convey symbolic thought; and technological evidence reflecting the tools and skills that would have been used to produce art. Direct evidence is difficult to find beyond 40ka, and indirect evidence is essentially intangible, thus technological evidence is the most fruitful of the three.|$|E
5|$|The news of Raj's {{possible}} arrest {{provoked a}} heightened {{attack on the}} North Indians in the industrial town of Nashik in Maharashtra, Raj's political stronghold. North Indians left the city by buses, trains and private vehicles. Railway officials at Nashik station {{said that this was}} the largest crowd using the railroad since the Sinhasta Kumbha Mela in 2003–2004. It was <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the largest exoduses from a single district in the country ever. Chhagan Bhujbal, Nashik's guardian minister, reported that 15,000migrant workers had left the city {{in the aftermath of the}} violence against North Indians.|$|E
25|$|A {{memorial}} cross for Lord Kitchener {{was unveiled}} at St Botolph's church in 1916 (near Liverpool Street station), <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the first memorials of the First World War in England.|$|E
60|$|Major Thomson glanced thoughtfully at {{a little}} pile of {{documents}} by his side. Then he looked coldly towards his visitor and provided him, <b>perhaps,</b> with <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most complete surprises of his life.|$|R
60|$|The remark {{was evidently}} overheard, as <b>perhaps</b> Kinnaird intended. <b>One</b> <b>of</b> the others laughed.|$|R
6000|$|And Mr. Kennan: [...] "It's not that. He {{must have}} a screw loose somewhere. <b>Perhaps</b> he's <b>one</b> <b>of</b> those creatures who've slipped the ratchet off the motion cog. Maybe he can't stop running till he runs down." ...|$|R
25|$|<b>Perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the most}} {{striking}} applications of systoles is {{in the context of}} the Schottky problem, by P.Buser and P.Sarnak, who distinguished the Jacobians of Riemann surfaces among principally polarized abelian varieties, laying the foundation for systolic arithmetic.|$|E
25|$|The large Jaina temple, {{among the}} many temples at Lakkundi, also near Gadag, is <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the {{earliest}} examples of temples in this area built {{of a kind of}} fine-textured chloritic schist as distinct from the hitherto-used sandstone of this region.|$|E
25|$|Abu Bakr {{was fully}} aware of Umar's power and ability to succeed him. Succession of Umar was thus not as {{troublesome}} {{as any of the}} others. His was <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the smoothest transitions of power from one authority to another in the Muslim lands.|$|E
5000|$|In 792 {{she married}} Æthelred I of Northumbria at Catterick. Here she is {{described}} as [...] "queen", which has suggested to some historians {{that she had been}} previously married, and to a king, <b>perhaps</b> to <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Æthelred's predecessors.|$|R
6000|$|... 'That's the {{prejudice}} {{of what you}} are pleased to call the Anglican Church. Mr Melmotte is a convert to our faith. He is a great man, and will <b>perhaps</b> be <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the greatest known {{on the face of the}} globe.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'They {{were only}} fakirs. They will {{no more than}} take a little grain, <b>perhaps,</b> from <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the trucks. There are many up the line. The State will never miss the dole. I came here seeking for my partner, Lutuf Ullah.' ...|$|R
25|$|Apart {{from the}} several {{theological}} discourses, Gregory {{was also one}} of the most important early Christian men of letters, a very accomplished orator, <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the greatest of his time. Gregory was also a very prolific poet who wrote theological, moral and biographical poems.|$|E
25|$|The {{granting}} of citizenship to allies and the conquered was a vital {{step in the}} process of Romanization. This step {{was one of the most}} effective political tools and (at that point in history) original political ideas (<b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most important reasons for the success of Rome).|$|E
25|$|It detects {{ionizing}} radiation such as alpha particles, beta particles and gamma rays using the ionization effect produced in a Geiger–Müller tube; which gives {{its name to}} the instrument. In wide and prominent use as a hand-held radiation survey instrument, it is <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the world's best-known radiation detection instruments.|$|E
50|$|Warumungu Sign Language {{is a sign}} {{language}} used by the Warumungu, an Aboriginal community in the central desert region of Australia. Along with Warlpiri Sign Language, it is (or <b>perhaps</b> was) <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most elaborate of all Australian Aboriginal {{sign language}}s.|$|R
5000|$|Clue Little Detective (1992) <b>Perhaps</b> in <b>one</b> <b>of</b> {{the biggest}} departures from the {{standard}} game, the object of this game {{is to be the}} first to reach the front gate from the attic after hearing a scary noise. Not officially a Clue Jr game.|$|R
6000|$|... "The charming widow, Mrs. Norman, is, we hear, {{among the}} {{distinguished}} guests staying at Buck's Hotel.

25|$|Johns Hopkins {{offers a}} number of degrees {{including}} BA and BS for undergraduate student and MA, MS and Ph.D. Because Hopkins offers both undergraduate and graduate areas of study, many disciplines have multiple degrees available. Biomedical engineering, <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> Hopkins' best-known programs, offers Bachelor's, Master's, Graduate and Ph.D degrees.|$|E
25|$|Monarchs {{share the}} defense of noxious taste with the similar-appearing viceroy {{butterfly}} in what is <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most well-known examples of mimicry. Though long purported to {{be an example of}} Batesian mimicry, the viceroy is actually reportedly more unpalatable than the monarch, making this a case of Müllerian mimicry.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of the Protestant Reformation, Martin Luther articulated a doctrine of the two kingdoms. According to James Madison, <b>perhaps</b> <b>one</b> <b>of</b> the most important modern proponents of {{the separation of church and}} state, Luther's doctrine of the two kingdoms marked {{the beginning}} of the modern conception of separation of church and state.|$|E
6000|$|And indeed {{she rose}} {{out of the sea}} of colours so {{beautiful}} and happy a vision that the priest felt his suspicion shaken and shifted.
