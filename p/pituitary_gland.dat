5|$|The {{arcuate nucleus}} and the periventricular {{nucleus of the}} {{hypothalamus}} have dopamine neurons that form an important projection—the tuberoinfundibular pathway which goes to the <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland,</b> where it influences the secretion of the hormone prolactin. Dopamine is the primary neuroendocrine inhibitor of the secretion of prolactin from the anterior <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland.</b> Dopamine produced by neurons in the arcuate nucleus is secreted into the hypophyseal portal system of the median eminence, which supplies the <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland.</b> The prolactin cells that produce prolactin, {{in the absence of}} dopamine, secrete prolactin continuously; dopamine inhibits this secretion. In the context of regulating prolactin secretion, dopamine is occasionally called prolactin-inhibiting factor, prolactin-inhibiting hormone, or prolactostatin.|$|E

5|$|The {{decision}} on whether to surgically decompress the <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland</b> is complex and mainly dependent on the severity of visual loss and visual field defects. If visual acuity is severely reduced, there are large or worsening visual field defects, or the level of consciousness falls consistently, professional guidelines recommend that surgery is performed. Most commonly, operations on the <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland</b> are performed through transsphenoidal surgery. In this procedure, surgical instruments are passed through the nose towards the sphenoid bone, which is opened to give access to the cavity that contains the <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland.</b> Surgery is most likely to improve vision if there was some remaining vision before surgery, and if surgery is undertaken within a week of the onset of symptoms.|$|E
40|$|The <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands</b> from mice {{rendered}} obese by gold thioglucose {{treatment and}} by dietary manipulation, and <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands</b> from lean mice after a high food intake or a glucose load, {{were shown to}} stimulate insulin secretion from isolated pancreatic islets. The insulin releasing activity of <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands</b> from obese (ob/ob) mice was reduced by fasting for 24 and 48 h. Results obtained with <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands</b> from ob/ob and from lean ob / + and + /+ mice suggest that the insulin releasing property manifests a gene dosage effect. <b>Pituitary</b> <b>glands</b> from 3 -week-old (young) ob/ob mice stimulated insulin secretion {{to the same extent}} as <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands</b> from 3 -month-old (adult) ob/ob mice. The pancreatic islets of young ob/ob mice were shown to be somewhat more responsive to stimulation by the pituitary factor than were lean ob / + or + / + islets from this age group. The concept that high insulin level, partly under pituitary control, and high caloric intake may be interlinked and may, in combination, be a major factor in producing obesity is discussed. Furthermore, it is suggested that the pituitary insulin releasing factor {{may play a role in}} the early develop-ment of obesity in the animal models studied...|$|R
25|$|In {{the late}} 1950s, Maurice Raben {{purified}} enough GH from human <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands</b> to successfully treat a GH-deficient boy. A few endocrinologists began {{to help parents}} of severely GH-deficient children to make arrangements with local pathologists to collect human <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands</b> after removal at autopsy. Parents would then contract with a biochemist to purify enough growth hormone to treat their child. Few families could manage such a complicated undertaking.|$|R

5|$|Hormonal {{output from}} the thyroid is {{regulated}} by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) secreted from the anterior <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland,</b> which itself is regulated by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH) {{produced by the}} hypothalamus.|$|E
5|$|Hypothyroidism {{is caused}} by {{inadequate}} function of the gland itself (primary hypothyroidism), inadequate stimulation by thyroid-stimulating hormone from the <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland</b> (secondary hypothyroidism), or inadequate release of thyrotropin-releasing hormone from the brain's hypothalamus (tertiary hypothyroidism). Primary hypothyroidism is about a thousandfold more common than central hypothyroidism.|$|E
5|$|It is {{recommended}} that magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan of the <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland</b> is performed if the diagnosis is suspected; this has a sensitivity of over 90% for detecting pituitary apoplexy; it may demonstrate infarction (tissue damage due to a decreased blood supply) or hemorrhage. Different MRI sequences {{can be used to}} establish when the apoplexy occurred, and the predominant form of damage (hemorrhage or infarction). If MRI is not suitable (e.g. due to claustrophobia or the presence of metal-containing implants), a computed tomography (CT) scan may demonstrate abnormalities in the <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland,</b> although it is less reliable. Many pituitary tumors (25%) are found to have areas of hemorrhagic infarction on MRI scans, but apoplexy is not said to exist unless it is accompanied by symptoms.|$|E
40|$|Insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I) is {{produced}} in the liver and other peripheral tissues in response to growth hormone (GH) stimuli. IGF-I regulates diverse physiological functions in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner. IGF-I and IGF-I receptor (type-I receptor) are expressed in human and rat <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands.</b> However, the cell types of IGF-I-expressing cells and target cells of IGF-I in the <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands</b> are not known. The present study was aimed to identify the cell types of IGF-I-expressing cells and of its type-I receptor-expressing cells in mouse <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands.</b> In the mouse <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands,</b> IGF-I mRNA and IGF-I receptor mRNA were detected by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). IGF-I-expressing cells and its receptor-expressing cells were detected by non-radioisotopic in situ hybridization using mouse IGF-I cDNA and IGF-I receptor cDNA probes, and their cell types were immunocytochemically determined using antibodies raised against pituitary hormones. We found that somatotrophs expressed both IGF-I and IGF-I receptors, and some of corticotrophs expressed IGF-I receptors. Co-localization of IGF-I and GH in the same cultured pituitary cells was observed by dual-labelling immunocytochemistry. The present study demonstrated that pituitary IGF-I produced in somatotrophs regulated functions of somatotrophs and corticotrophs in an autocrine and/or paracrine manner...|$|R

40|$|The {{comparative}} immunohistochemical localization of {{adrenocorticotropic hormone}} (ACTH) and beta-endorphin-like immunoreactivity (referred to as beta-endorphin) was studied in 16 human anterior <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands</b> from 6 normal adults, 4 normal fetuses, 1 stillborn infant, 2 anencephalic infants, 1 adult with Crooke's hyaline degeneration, and 2 patients with pituitary adenomas associated with Cushing's syndrome. Mirror sections {{were used in}} order to enable precise comparison of the same cells on the two consecutive tissue sections. In these normal and pathologic human anterior <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands,</b> ACTH and beta-endorphin were mostly localized in the same cells. In the normal adult <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands,</b> however, some ACTH cells were negative for beta-endorphin; {{and in one of}} the pituitary adenomas, some tumor cells were positive for only one hormone (beta-endorphin). These data suggest concomitant production of ACTH and beta-endorphin in the same cells and support the production of precursor molecules for these two hormones. The significance of ACTH-positive, beta-endorphin-negative normal cells and beta-endorphin-positive, ACTH-negative tumor cells is also discussed...|$|R
5|$|In vertebrates, {{the part}} of the brain that plays the {{greatest}} role is the hypothalamus, a small region at the base of the forebrain whose size does not reflect its complexity or the importance of its function. The hypothalamus is a collection of small nuclei, most of which are involved in basic biological functions. Some of these functions relate to arousal or to social interactions such as sexuality, aggression, or maternal behaviors; but many of them relate to homeostasis. Several hypothalamic nuclei receive input from sensors located in the lining of blood vessels, conveying information about temperature, sodium level, glucose level, blood oxygen level, and other parameters. These hypothalamic nuclei send output signals to motor areas that can generate actions to rectify deficiencies. Some of the outputs also go to the <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland,</b> a tiny gland attached to the brain directly underneath the hypothalamus. The <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland</b> secretes hormones into the bloodstream, where they circulate throughout the body and induce changes in cellular activity.|$|E
5|$|TPP is {{distinguished}} from {{other forms of}} periodic paralysis (especially hypokalemic periodic paralysis) with thyroid function tests on the blood. These are normal in the other forms, and in thyrotoxicosis the levels of thyroxine and triiodothyronine are elevated, with resultant suppression of TSH production by the <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland.</b> Various other investigations are usually performed to separate the different causes of hyperthyroidism.|$|E
5|$|The {{cerebrum}} {{contains the}} ventricles where the cerebrospinal fluid is produced and circulated. Below the corpus callosum is the septum pellucidum, a membrane {{that separates the}} lateral ventricles. Beneath the lateral ventricles is the thalamus and {{to the front and}} below this is the hypothalamus. The hypothalamus leads on to the <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland.</b> At the back of the thalamus is the brainstem.|$|E

40|$|<b>Pituitary</b> and adrenal <b>glands</b> {{removed from}} {{male and female}} spontaneously {{hypertensive}} (SH) rat donors {{with high blood pressure}} were implanted in normotensive, Sprague-Dawley (S-D) recipients which had been hypophysectomized or adrenalectomized. The transplants were accepted readily and after 90 days the animals were necropsied. Maintenance of organs and body weights suggested that the <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands</b> of SH rats have an adequate content of growth hormone but there may be an intrinsic deficiency of gonadotrophic hormones in this strain. The blood pressure of the hypophysectomized and adrenalectomized recipients was well maintained, particularly by the Sh-rat adrenal transplants, but the blood pressure of the recipients did not become abnormally elevated. SH-rat <b>pituitary</b> and adrenal <b>glands</b> caused fatty infiltration of the liver and hyperlipidaemia indicative of a lipotrophic factor in the SH rat strain. The histopathological changes in the transplanted <b>pituitary</b> and adrenal <b>glands,</b> and in intact <b>pituitary</b> and adrenal <b>glands</b> of the recipients, suggested that SH-rat <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands</b> secrete extra quantities of ACTH, that the pituitary-adrenal axis of this strain is extra sensitive to stressful stimuli, and that the spectrum of adrenal steroids secreted by this strain may be different from that of most normotensive strains...|$|R
50|$|The <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland's</b> {{anterior}} lobe (adenohypophysis) {{is a true}} gland {{which produces}} and secretes six different hormones: thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH), follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), luteinizing hormone (LH), growth hormone (GH), and prolactin (PRL).|$|R

5|$|In {{secondary}} adrenal insufficiency, a dysfunction of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis {{leads to}} decreased {{stimulation of the}} adrenal cortex. Apart from suppression of the axis by glucocorticoid therapy, {{the most common cause}} of secondary adrenal insufficiency are tumors that affect the production of adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) by the <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland.</b> This type of adrenal insufficiency usually does not affect the production of mineralocorticoids, which are under regulation of the renin-angiotensin system instead.|$|E
5|$|The hypothalamic–pituitary–thyroid axis plays a {{key role}} in {{maintaining}} thyroid hormone levels within normal limits. Production of TSH by the anterior <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland</b> is stimulated in turn by thyrotropin-releasing hormone (TRH), released from the hypothalamus. Production of TSH and TRH is decreased by thyroxine by a negative feedback process. Not enough TRH, which is uncommon, can lead to not enough TSH and thereby to not enough thyroid hormone production.|$|E
5|$|The <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland</b> {{is located}} {{at the base of the}} brain, and intimately {{connected}} with the hypothalamus. It consists of two lobes: the posterior pituitary, which consists of nervous tissue branching out of the hypothalamus, and the anterior pituitary, which consists of hormone-producing epithelium. The posterior pituitary secretes antidiuretic hormone, which regulates osmolarity of the blood, and oxytocin, which causes contractions of the uterus in childbirth and participates in breastfeeding.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. It is {{rare for}} {{systemic}} non-Hodgkin's lymphoma (NHL) to metastasize to the hypothalamus and <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands.</b> The present study describes two patients with NHL and diabetes insipidus (DI) and 17 patients from the litera-ture {{in order to}} analyze the clinical features of patients with NHL metastasizing to the <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands.</b> Diffuse large B cell lymphoma (DLBCL) was observed {{to be the most}} common type of NHL involving the hypothalamus-pituitary axis. A total of 11 patients (57. 9 %) had been diagnosed with DI (post-pituitary involvement), five (26. 3 %) with anterior hypopituitarism and three (15. 8 %) with posterior and ante-rior hypopituitarism. Only two cases exhibited simultaneous endocrine and lymphoma manifestations; the majority of cases (68. 4 %) exhibited lymphoma manifestations first. To make an etiological diagnosis of NHL with metastases to the <b>pituitary</b> <b>glands,</b> it is necessary to find that NHL exists in other regions of patient's body. Biopsy of the sellar may have significant meaning, but this examination may difficult to perform. Chemotherapy for NHL relieves pituitary impair-ment symptoms and improves the overall examination results. Additionally, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the pitu-itary gland has a certain differential diagnostic value as the T 1 - and T 2 -weighted imaging (WI) signals from patients with systemic NHL with pituitary involvement are low...|$|R

5|$|The {{production}} of thyroxine and triiodothyronine is primarily regulated by thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), {{released by the}} anterior <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland.</b> TSH release in turn is stimulated by thyrotropin releasing hormone (TRH), released in a pulsatile manner from the hypothalamus. The thyroid hormones provide negative feedback to the thyrotropes TSH and TRH: when the thyroid hormones are high, TSH production is suppressed. This negative feedback also occurs when levels of TSH are high, causing TRH production to be suppressed.|$|E
5|$|Ovulation is {{the second}} phase of the ovarian cycle in which a mature egg is {{released}} from the ovarian follicles into the oviduct. During the follicular phase, estradiol suppresses release of luteinizing hormone (LH) from the anterior <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland.</b> When the egg has nearly matured, levels of estradiol reach a threshold above which this effect is reversed and estrogen stimulates the production of a large amount of LH. This process, known as the LH surge, starts around day12 of the average cycle and may last 48 hours.|$|E
5|$|Pituitary {{apoplexy}} or pituitary tumor apoplexy is bleeding into or impaired {{blood supply}} of the <b>pituitary</b> <b>gland</b> {{at the base of}} the brain. This usually occurs in the presence of a tumor of the pituitary, although in 80% of cases this has not been diagnosed previously. The most common initial symptom is a sudden headache, often associated with a rapidly worsening visual field defect or double vision caused by compression of nerves surrounding the gland. This is followed in many cases by acute symptoms caused by lack of secretion of essential hormones, predominantly adrenal insufficiency.|$|E
