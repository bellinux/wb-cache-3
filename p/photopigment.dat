25|$|Transduction is {{the process}} through which energy from {{environmental}} stimuli is converted to neural activity for the brain to understand and process. The back of the eye contains three different cell layers: photoreceptor layer, bipolar cell layer and ganglion cell layer. The photoreceptor layer {{is at the very}} back and contains rod photoreceptors and cone photoreceptors. Cones are responsible for color perception. There are three different cones: red, green and blue. Rods, are responsible for the perception of objects in low light. Photoreceptors contain within them a special chemical called a <b>photopigment,</b> which are embedded in the membrane of the lamellae; a single human rod contains approximately 10 million of them. The <b>photopigment</b> molecules consist of two parts: an opsin (a protein) and retinal (a lipid). There are 3 specific photopigments (each with their own color) that respond to specific wavelengths of light. When the appropriate wavelength of light hits the photoreceptor, its <b>photopigment</b> splits into two, which sends a message to the bipolar cell layer, which in turn sends a message to the ganglion cells, which then send the information through the optic nerve to the brain. If the appropriate <b>photopigment</b> is not in the proper photoreceptor (for example, a green <b>photopigment</b> inside a red cone), a condition called color vision deficiency will occur.|$|E
25|$|In mammals, light {{controls}} {{the sense of}} sight and the circadian clock by activating light-sensitive proteins in photoreceptor cells in the eye's retina. In the case of vision, light is detected by rhodopsin in rod and cone cells. In {{the case of the}} circadian clock, a different <b>photopigment,</b> melanopsin, is responsible for detecting light in intrinsically photosensitive retinal ganglion cells.|$|E
25|$|Light {{restriction}} in the evening, {{sometimes called}} darkness therapy or scototherapy, is another treatment strategy. Just as bright light upon awakening should advance one's sleep phase, bright {{light in the}} evening and night delays it (see the PRC). It is suspected that DSPD patients may be overly sensitive to evening light. Thus, one might be advised to keep lights and computer screens dim for the last hours before bedtime and even wear amber-colored (blue-blocking) goggles. The <b>photopigment</b> of the retinal photosensitive ganglion cells, melanopsin, is excited by light mainly in the blue portion of the visible spectrum (absorption peaks at ~480 nanometers).|$|E
50|$|Less common {{forms of}} dichromacy include protoanopia (lack of L-cones), and tritanopia (lack of S-cones). If a person lacks {{two types of}} <b>photopigments,</b> they are {{considered}} monochromats. People lacking {{the three types of}} <b>photopigments</b> are said to have complete color blindness or achromatopsia. Color blindness can also result from damages to the visual cortex in the brain.|$|R
50|$|A photoisomerase is {{a protein}} {{in the eye}} that is {{responsible}} for isomerizing <b>photopigments.</b>|$|R
40|$|Starting from known {{spectral}} {{properties of}} visual <b>photopigments</b> and photoreceptors, a mathematical construction of neural response functions to visual stimuli is obtained. Included {{in this is}} a somewhat general derivation of the univariance principle. Temporal dependence of response on stimulus {{is included in the}} formulation. Special attention is given to the case of flash stimuli and their resulting spectral sensitivities. This formulation is applied to certain physiological spectral sensitivity measurements that are at variance with known spectrophometric results. An analysis of the data in these cases suggests that they correspond to "pseudo-pigments" arising from the neural interaction of several <b>photopigments.</b> The method of analysis is constructive and identifies the gamma-max's of the interacting <b>photopigments.</b> These are found to be in good agreement with existing spectrophotometric measurements...|$|R
25|$|Vertebrate {{animals such as}} {{tropical}} {{fish and}} birds sometimes have more complex color vision systems than humans; thus the many subtle colors they exhibit generally serve as direct signals for other fish or birds, and not to signal mammals. In bird vision, tetrachromacy is achieved through up to four cone types, depending on species. Each single cone contains {{one of the four}} main types of vertebrate cone <b>photopigment</b> (LWS/ MWS, RH2, SWS2 and SWS1) and has a colored oil droplet in its inner segment. Brightly colored oil droplets inside the cones shift or narrow the spectral sensitivity of the cell. It has been suggested that it is likely that pigeons are pentachromats.|$|E
50|$|The {{behavior}} of the rhodopsin <b>photopigment</b> explains why the human eye cannot resolve lights with different spectral power distributions under low light. The reaction of this single <b>photopigment</b> will give the same quanta for 400 nm light and 700 nm light. Therefore, this <b>photopigment</b> only maps the rate of absorption and does not encode information about the relative spectral composition of the light.|$|E
50|$|The <b>photopigment</b> {{rhodopsin}} intercepts {{light as}} {{the first step in the}} perception of light.|$|E
5000|$|After {{moving from}} a high {{luminescence}} setting to a low luminescence setting each eye must adjust before being {{they are able to}} achieve maximal retinal sensitivity. [...] Upon exposure to light <b>photopigments</b> in both rod and cone photoreceptor cells undergo a structural change. [...] It is through this chemical reaction known as light adaptation that light energy is converted to electrical impulses sent to the brain. [...] During light adaptation the <b>photopigments</b> are decomposed thereby reducing retinal sensitivity in low luminescence settings. [...] This is known as photoreceptor bleaching and is proportional to the quantum catch of the pigment. [...] The regeneration of the <b>photopigments</b> occurs during dark adaptation albeit at markedly different rates. [...] Rod cells are much slower to adapt to the dark and it is believed to take days for these cells to reach full dark adaptation.|$|R
40|$|Interactions {{between the}} light-harvesting {{subunits}} and the non-covalently bound <b>photopigments</b> attribute considerably to the spectral properties of photosynthetic bacteria light-harvesting complexes. In our previous studies, we have constructed a novel Rhodobacter sphaeroides expression system. In the present study, {{we focus on}} the spectral properties of LH 2 when heterologously express LH 2 with β -subunit- GFP fusion protein in Rb. sphaeroides. Near infra-red spectrum of LH 2 remained nearly unchanged as measured by spectroscopy. Fluorescence spectrum suggested that the LH 2 with β -subunit-GFP fusion protein complexes still possessed normal activity in energy transfer. However, <b>photopigments</b> contents were significantly decreased to a very low lev el in the LH 2 with β -subunit-GFP fusion protein complexes compared to that of LH 2. FT-IR spectra indicated that interactions between <b>photopigments</b> and LH 2 α / β - subunits appeared not to be changed. It was concluded that the LH 2 spectral properties exhibited very similar even when heterologously expressed LH 2 b -subunit fusion protein in Rb. sphaeroides. Our present study may supply a new insight into better understand the interactions between light-harvesting subunits and <b>photopigments</b> and bacterial photosynthesis and promote the development of the novel Rb. sphaeroides expression system. </p...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{impacts of}} light beyond vision, i. e. non-visual {{functions}} of light, signify {{the need to}} better understand light detection (or photoreception) systems in vertebrates. <b>Photopigments,</b> which comprise light-absorbing chromophores bound {{to a variety of}} G-protein coupled receptor opsins, are responsible for visual and non-visual photoreception. Non-visual opsin <b>photopigments</b> in the retina of mammals and extra-retinal tissues of non-mammals {{play an important role in}} non-image-forming functions of light, e. g. biological rhythms and seasonal reproduction. This review highlights the role of opsin photoreceptors in the deep brain, which could involve conserved neurochemical systems that control different time- and light-dependent physiologies in in non-mammalian vertebrates including teleost fish...|$|R

50|$|In contrast, platyrrhines {{have only}} a single, {{polymorphic}} X chromosome M/L opsin gene locus. Therefore, every male platyrrhine is dichromatic because it can only receive either the M or L <b>photopigment</b> on its single X chromosome {{in addition to its}} S <b>photopigment.</b> However, the X chromosome gene locus is polymorphic for M and L alleles, rendering heterozygous platyrrhine females with trichromatic vision, and homozygous females with dichromatic vision.|$|E
50|$|Activation of <b>photopigments</b> {{by light}} sends a signal by hyperpolarizing the rod cell, {{leading to the}} rod cell not sending its neurotransmitter, {{which leads to the}} bipolar cell then {{releasing}} its transmitter at the bipolar-ganglion synapse and exciting the synapse.|$|R
40|$|In an {{investigation}} of extracted <b>photopigments</b> {{from a number of}} vertebrates, KSttgen and Abelsdorff (1896) discovered that the material from freshwater fish retinae was more violet in color (and hence absorbed at longer wavelengths) than that from some terrestrial birds, mammals, and adult amphibians. No results were reported for marine fishes. Forty years later (in 1936), however, Wald was able to demonstrate hat at least four species of marine fishes differed from freshwater fishes in that their <b>photopigments</b> were very similar to those of terrestrial vertebrates (Wald, 1936 a, 1938).

40|$|ABSTRACT The deep-sea squid, Todarodes pac~'cus, {{possesses}} well-developed parolfactory vesicles as extraocular photoreceptors {{connected with}} the brain. The ventral set of vesicles forms a thread- 3 mm long and looks orange owing to <b>photopigments.</b> The vesicle mainly consists of receptor cells, {{each of which is}} similar in structure to the visual cell, carrying rhabdomeres in the distal process and lamellated myeloid bodies in the proximal part. Recently we noticed that a crude extract of the vesicles is capable of isomerizing retinal from all-tram to the 1 l-cis form in the light, and confirmed that the vesicles in fact contained retinochrome in addition to rhodopsin. This {{is the first time that}} retinochrome has been detected in any place other than ocular tissues.

5000|$|Hattar {{is known}} for his work in the area of chronobiology. He is {{credited}} with discovering that the <b>photopigment</b> melanopsin and associated ipRGCs {{play an important role in}} the entrainment of circadian rhythms [...] Before Hattar's work, it was assumed that organisms entrained to daily light-dark cycles through the same mechanisms that are responsible for vision. However, case studies reported that some who were completely blind could still entrain to these cycles. This observation, coupled with the discovery of melanopsin by Ignacio Provencio, led Hattar to hypothesize that this <b>photopigment</b> might be responsible for photoentrainment.|$|E
50|$|The {{xanthophyll}} cycle takes place, {{along with}} other <b>photopigment</b> reactions, in the membranes of thylakoids within chloroplasts. Antheraxanthin provides more heat and light stability (via NPQ) to the thylakoid membranes than violaxanthin, but less than zeaxanthin.|$|E
50|$|Since the {{complete}} loss of <b>photopigments</b> clearly distinguishes the leukoplastidious cryptophytes from Cryptomonas, {{the incorporation of}} “Chilomonas” with Cryptomonas has been highly debatable.

50|$|In medical terminology, {{the term}} <b>photopigment</b> {{is applied to}} opsin-type {{photoreceptor}} proteins, specifically rhodopsin and photopsins, the photoreceptor proteins in the retinal rods and cones of vertebrates {{that are responsible for}} visual perception, but also melanopsin and others.|$|E

50|$|Gene {{therapy for}} color {{blindness}} is an experimental gene therapy aiming to convert congenitally colorblind individuals to trichromats by introducing a <b>photopigment</b> gene that they lack. Though partial color blindness is considered only a mild disability and is controversial {{whether it is}} even a disorder, it is a condition that affects many people, particularly males. Complete color blindness, or achromatopsia, is very rare but more severe.

50|$|Further {{complexity}} {{arises from}} the various interconnections among bipolar cells, horizontal cells, and amacrine cells in the retina.

50|$|The eye is able {{to detect}} a visual {{stimulus}} when the photons (light packets) cause a <b>photopigment</b> molecule, primarily rhodopsin, to come apart. Rhodopsin, which is usually pink, becomes bleached in the process. At high levels of light, photopigments are broken apart faster than can be regenerated. Because a low number of photopigments have been regenerated, the eyes are not sensitive to light. When entering a dark room after being in a well lit area, the eyes require time for a good quantity of rhodopsin to regenerate. As more time passes, there is a higher chance that the photons will split an unbleached <b>photopigment</b> because the rate of regeneration will have surpassed the rate of bleaching. This is called adaptation.|$|E

40|$|Many {{physiological}} and behavioural responses {{to changes in}} environmental lighting conditions are mediated by extraocular photoreceptors. Here we investigate encephalic photoreception in Phreatichthys andruzzii, a typical cave-dwelling fish showing an extreme phenotype with complete anophthalmy {{and a reduction in}} size of associated brain structures. We firstly identified two P. andruzzii <b>photopigments,</b> orthologues of rod opsin and exo-rod opsin. In vitro, both opsins serve as light-absorbing <b>photopigments</b> with max around 500 nm when reconstituted with an A 1 chromophore. When corrected for the summed absorption from the skin and skull, the spectral sensitivity profiles shifted to longer wavelengths (rod opsin: 521 nm; exo-rod opsin: 520 nm). We next explored the involvement of both opsins in the negative phototaxis reported for this species. A comparison of the spectral sensitivity of the photophobic response with the putative A 2 absorbance spectra corrected for skin/skull absorbance indicates that the A 2 versions of either or both of these pigments could explain the observed behavioural spectral sensitivity...|$|R
