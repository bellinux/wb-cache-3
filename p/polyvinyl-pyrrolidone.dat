30|$|There {{are several}} types of {{colloidal}} metal stabilizers which depend {{on the type of}} metal, method of preparation, and the application of the resultant metallic nanoparticles. For example, polymers having functional groups such as -NH 2, -COOH, and -OH have high affinity for metal atoms; however, the use of stabilizers is not desirable for some applications such as catalysis. For example, activities of supported metal nanoparticle catalysts by coordination capture method are higher than those of <b>polyvinyl-pyrrolidone</b> (PVP)-stabilized metal colloidal catalysts [33, 34]. Due to functional groups namely C[*]=[*]O and N, and long polymer chains, PVP can associate with the metal nanoparticles [35, 36]. The functional groups containing lone pairs of electrons help in the stabilization of metal nanoparticles at their surfaces by covalent interaction, whereas the polymer chain restricts aggregation of metal nanoparticles by steric hindrance. For example, the long chains of PVP stretch out around nickel atom {{on the surface of the}} crystal, causing a steric hindrance effect and thus prevent particle growth effectively [37]. Apart from this, PVP is a biocompatible polymer. Hence, nanoparticles synthesized in PVP can be used in biological applications.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{rotation}} of magnetic nanorods in a soft hydrogel matrix induced by a homogeneous magnetic field is investigated. Magnetic nanorods of ≈ 151. 2 nm length and ≈ 17. 7 nm diameter are synthesized via current-pulsed electrodeposition of nickel into porous aluminum oxide-templates. The nanorods are processed towards a stable colloidal dispersion by dissolution of the alumina template in aqueous NaOH to which PVP (<b>polyvinyl-pyrrolidone)</b> is added as surfactant. These suspensions are used to prepare gelatine-based ferrogels of different shear modulus with either isotropic or uniaxial orientation-distribution of the nanorods. While magnetization measurements of rigid ferrogels mainly reflect the magnetic properties of the nickel nanorods, the magnetization behavior of soft ferrogels is significantly influenced by a field-induced rotation of the nickel nanorods in the low compliant matrix. A particular analysis of magnetization measurements on uniaxial ferrogels enables to quantify the rotation angle of the nanorods {{with respect to their}} initial orientation under the influence of a transversal homogeneous magnetic field. The analysis of the field-dependent rotation also allows to estimate the local shear modulus of the matrix which is demonstrated by an investigation of room temperature ageing process of the ferrogel...|$|E

By use of two assays for actin, a DNase I inhibition assay and a gel scanning assay, we identified several factors that increased actin yield. ATP {{is required for the}} actin in crude pea root extracts to bind to immobilized DNase I. Low amounts of ATP are hydrolyzed rapidly by an endogenous ATPase in the extract, and the actin then irreversibly loses the ability to bind to DNase I. High ATP concentrations (5 - 10 mm) or inhibition of the ATPase (with 10 mm pyrophosphate) are required for pea actin to retain DNase I binding ability. When adequate amounts of ATP are present, actin binding from the extract is further enhanced by basic pH, formamide, and soluble <b>polyvinyl-pyrrolidone.</b> Once actin is bound to the DNase I-agarose and washed free of extract, high ATP concentrations are not required to keep actin bound.

The atrophy of the heart which is known to take place after hypopliysectomy 3 ' 4 (the loss of cardiac weight is proportionately greater than the loss of body weight) was considered to be due to an adaptation of the heart to the lower demands.

On the other side, a laser beam is focused into the gel to excite the fluorescence of the nanoprobes, which is continuously monitored to reveal possible structural changes of the stressed gel. Using fluorescence correlation spectroscopy we measure correlation functions of the nanoprobes at various times following the contact of the gel with the hydrating or dehydrating solution, and determine changes of both the average concentration and the apparent diffusion time of the nanoprobes as the gel is shrinking or swelling.

The {{purpose of this study}} was to investigate whether polymeric hydrogels, either implanted or injected adjacent to the outer scleral surface, slow ocular elongation. White Leghorn (Gallus gallus domesticus) chicks were used at 2 weeks of age. Chicks had either (1) a strip of poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) (pHEMA) implanted monocularly against the outer sclera at the posterior pole, or (2) an in situ polymerizing gel [main ingredient: <b>poly(vinyl-pyrrolidone)</b> (PVP) ] injected monocularly at the same location. Some of the eyes injected with the polymer were fitted with a diffuser or a - 10 D lens. In each experiment, ocular lengths were measured at regular intervals by high frequency A-scan ultrasonography, and chicks were sacrificed for histology at staged intervals. No in vivo signs of either orbital or ocular inflammation were observed. The pHEMA implant significantly increased scleral thickness by the third week, and the implant became encapsulated with fibrous tissue. The PVP-injected eyes left otherwise untreated, showed a significant increase in scleral thickness, due to increased chondrocyte proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition. However, there was no effect of the PVP injection on ocular elongation. In eyes wearing optical devices, there was no effect on either scleral thickness or ocular elongation. These results represent 2 ̆ 2 proof of principle 2 ̆ 2 that scleral growth can be manipulated without adverse inflammatory responses.

40|$|Myopia {{prevalence}} {{has steadily}} climbed worldwide {{in recent decades}} with the most dramatic impact in East Asian countries. Treatments such as eyeglasses, contact lenses, and laser surgery for the refractive error are widely available, but none cures the underlying cause. In progressive high myopia, invasive surgical procedures using a scleral buckle for mechanical support are performed since the patient is at risk of becoming blind. The treatment outcome is highly dependent on the surgeon's skills and the patient's myopia progression rate, with limited choices in buckling materials. This dissertation, in four main studies, represents efforts made to control high myopia progression through the exploration and development of biomaterials that influence scleral growth. First, mRNA expression levels of the chick scleral matrix metalloproteinases, tissue-inhibitor of matrix metalloproteinases, and transforming growth factor-beta 2 were assessed for temporal and defocus power effects. The first study elucidated the roles that these factors play in scleral growth regulation and suggested potential motifs that can be incorporated in future biomaterials design. Second, <b>poly(vinyl-pyrrolidone)</b> as injectable gels and poly(2 -hydroxyethyl methacrylate) as solid strips were implanted in chicks to demonstrate the concept of posterior pole scleral reinforcements. This second study found that placing appropriate biomaterials at the posterior pole of the eye could directly influence scleral remodeling by interacting with the host cells. Both studies advanced the idea that scleral tissue remodeling could be potentially controlled by well-designed biomaterials. These findings led to the exploration of biomimetic hydrogels comprising enzymatically-degradable semi-interpenetrating polymer networks (edsIPNs) to determine their biocompatibility and effects on the chick posterior eye wall. This third study demonstrated the feasibility of stimulating scleral growth by applying biomimetic injectable materials. Fourth, the muscarinic antagonist drug, atropine, was encapsulated within the edsIPNs and delivered to the chick eye posterior pole to evaluate the local effect of atropine release. This fourth study offered an alternative method of ocular drug delivery for treatment of myopia, {{with the potential to}} elucidate the actual location of the inhibitive effect of atropine on myopia progression. In summary, this dissertation contributes to the design and use of biomaterials specific to myopia therapy and adds novel insights to scleral tissue engineering...|$|E

Die Auswahl der untersuchten Verbindungen erfolgte unter Berücksichtigung ihres Produktionsvolumens und der Neuheit auf dem Tensidmarkt. Sie umfasste die Waschmittelinhaltsstoffe lineare Alkylbenzol-sulfonate (LAS), welches das Tensid mit der höchsten Produktionsmenge darstellte, die beiden nichtionischen Tenside Alkylglucamide (AG) und Alkylpolyglucoside (APG), ebenso wie das amphotere Tensid Cocamidopropylbetain (CAPB). Außerdem wurde der polymere Farbübertragungsinhibitor Polyvinylpyrrolidon (PVP) untersucht. The principal {{tasks of}} the present work were 1) to develop and validate sensitive substance-specific methods for the quantitative determination of anionic, non-ionic and amphoteric surfactants and their biochemical degradation intermediates in aqueous environmental samples. These methods were based on advanced hyphenated mass spectrometric techniques. 2) to generate aerobic polar biodegradation products of surfactants in a laboratory-scale fixed-bed bioreactor (FBBR), which was run with a surface water-borne biocoenosis to simulate real environmental conditions. 3) to identify and characterize novel metabolites, generated in 2), by various mass spectrometric methods in order to deduce the surfactant degradation pathway in principle {{as well as to}} monitor primary and further biodegradation steps. 4) to gather data on the input and fate of surfactants in the aquatic environment under distinct hydrological and climatic conditions by analyzing the parent compounds and their metabolites in wastewaters and surface waters, in part polluted by untreated waste discharges. 5) to pursue the behavior of persistent surfactant metabolites in waterworks preparing drinking water from surface waters and to determine their residues in tap water. 6) to assess deleterious effects of discovered metabolites employing ecotoxicological bioassays. 7) to compare the results obtained from field studies with those from laboratory experiments in order to confirm the environmental relevance of the latter. The selection of target analytes was made taking into account output and novelty on the surfactant market. The substances comprised the detergent ingredients anionic linear alkylbenzene sulfonates (LAS) as the single surfactant with the highest production volume known to yield highly polar metabolites, the two non-ionics alkyl glucamides (AG) and alkyl polyglucosides (APG), as well as the amphoteric surfactant cocamidopropyl betaine (CAPB). In addition, the polymeric dye transfer inhibitor <b>poly(vinyl-pyrrolidone)</b> (PVP) was examined...|$|E
