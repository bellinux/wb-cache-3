I'm very happy here. ... It's taken me long enough to get to Hull so I'm not going to walk out after a few months, or whatever." [...] In the following six weeks he made only two brief substitute appearances– in five months with the club he played 18 games in the Championship without scoring – and the strength of Hull's squad was such that he could not be guaranteed regular first-team football.|$|E

Nobody is saying he hasn't got talent, but what he did was so disgusting. Of course he is not worth the money, but he is good at his job. However, I don't think he should be rewarded so soon after what happened. It is like <b>people</b> <b>are</b> <b>saying,</b> 'Let's forget all about it and see what we can give him.' It is wrong and bad timing to give or even put up this guy for recognition when he has done such a terrible thing. It was unforgivable, really. I'm not angry, I just don't believe it." ...|$|E
