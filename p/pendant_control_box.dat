5000|$|The Cobalt Flux dance {{platform}} itself {{connects to}} a [...] "control box", which contains {{the start and}} select buttons for the dance controller. The connection to the <b>control</b> <b>box</b> uses a 15-pin serial connector which hangs {{out of the top}} of the pad as a dongle. This <b>control</b> <b>box</b> also handles the wiring needed for different gaming console connectors, which lead off of the <b>control</b> <b>box.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>box</b> is removable.|$|R
50|$|Unlike earlier systems, {{none of the}} AN/ARC-5 <b>control</b> <b>boxes</b> have audio jacks for the microphone, headphone, or key. A {{separate}} {{jack box}} is used instead. AN/ARC-5 transmitter <b>control</b> <b>boxes</b> contain no Morse key.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} <b>control</b> <b>box</b> shipped with Cobalt Flux pads {{was designed}} to work only with the PlayStation 2; many home players {{wanted to use the}} pad with an Xbox or PC, but running this <b>control</b> <b>box</b> through converters for standard PS2 controllers usually caused an unacceptable amount of latency during play. Cobalt Flux has since released a new <b>control</b> <b>box</b> with built-in connectivity for PS2, Xbox, and the PC.|$|R
50|$|It is possible, with {{knowledge}} of the dance platform's pinout, to build your own <b>control</b> <b>box.</b> This is especially popular for the Xbox, as a <b>control</b> <b>box</b> built with the electronics from a soft dance pad will be properly recognized as a dance pad, not a controller.|$|R

50|$|The missile {{is carried}} in a {{rectangular}} launcher box, which is connected to a <b>control</b> <b>box</b> by a 20-meter cable, allowing for a degree of separation from the operator.

The transporter/launcher box is pointed toward the expected direction of the enemy and the <b>control</b> <b>box</b> is attached to it using the cable. The manual command to line of sight (MCLOS) <b>control</b> <b>box</b> consists of an optical sighting device and a joystick, which transmits commands to the missile via two thin cables that are trailed behind the missile.|$|R

50|$|Because {{of these}} characteristics, AN/ARC-5 close {{equivalents}} to the <b>control</b> <b>boxes</b> of the ARA/ATA and SCR-274-N are rare or never existed. The most common AN/ARC-5 receiver remote <b>control</b> <b>box</b> is the C-38/ARC-5, which allows control only of audio {{volume of the}} VHF and MF/HF receivers. No power, mode, or frequency controls are present. The C-38 also has controls for the R-4A homing receiver. A common AN/ARC-5 transmitter <b>control</b> <b>box</b> C-30A/ARC-5 has <b>controls</b> for selecting the MF/HF transmitter or the VHF transmitter, and a switch to select the channel for both the VHF transmitter and receiver. Mode controls are normally set for voice and covered.|$|R
50|$|The {{system is}} {{controlled}} during operation by two small <b>control</b> <b>boxes.</b> One {{of them is}} an electrical <b>control</b> <b>box,</b> with a speed adjustment knob, attached to the main box by an electrical cable. The other is a pneumatic <b>control</b> <b>box,</b> linked by a rubber tube to the diaphragm chamber, and has two push-buttons, one to add air to the system, {{and the other to}} remove air from the system. The final adjustment possible is an internal adjustment {{that can be used to}} change the amplitude of the pumping motion, but this is not available in operation, as adjusting it requires the main box of the machine to be dismantled and reassembled.|$|R

40|$|This report {{describes}} {{the construction and}} development of a <b>control</b> <b>box,</b> which is a tool for testing and verifying a certain model of Rapidâ€™s built in staplers (model A 6102). Basically {{the function of the}} <b>control</b> <b>box</b> is to interpret any errors that may occur in the stapler and to make it possible to test fire the stapler. The <b>control</b> <b>box</b> should be able to communicate with the stapler using a specialized communication protocol. The different data such as errors, firmware etc. from the stapler is presented in plain language on a display. Additional functions worth mentioning is the possibility to choose between several different firing modes and strengths of the stapler using two multiswitches. Our ambition with the <b>control</b> <b>box</b> was to create a construction that was suitable to build in small series, provide a good documentation and to write a program that would be easy to modify in case someone would like to add new functions in the future. Since we focused on making the box as easy as possible to assemble we have not prioritised to find the cheapest possible solution using cheap components. Instead we have chosen multifunctional components that individually can do as much of the work as possible such as the display and the microprocessor...|$|R

The objective of the analysis was to develop an operational plan to take advantage of the target spacecraft's maneuvering ability by making it responsible for a portion of the maneuvers necessary to achieve rendezvous. This work resulted in {{the development of a}} region in space relative to the Shuttle, called the <b>control</b> <b>box,</b> into which the target vehicle maneuvers. Furthermore, a mission operations plan was developed to implement the <b>control</b> <b>box</b> technique...|$|R
50|$|Usually, {{computerized}} sets {{cannot be}} connected end-to-end. However, some newer sets contain special miniature plugs - a female jack {{is located at}} the end of the set, and a male plug is located between the <b>control</b> <b>box</b> and the beginning of the actual lights. By disconnecting the <b>control</b> <b>box</b> from one set, it can now be plugged into the end of an identical chasing set to produce a longer strand of chasing lights. These plugs generally have a twist-on locking feature similar to that found on garden hoses.|$|R

30|$|The output {{signals from}} the {{electrical}} <b>control</b> <b>box</b> used for the serial injection testing {{can be described as}} the following: Output 1, current controlled of either 1.5 or 3.0 Â mA for 20 Â s; Output 2, 10 intermittent pulsing events between 0 and + 7 Â V for 20 Â ms (2 Â ms period); Output 3, 5 Â s interval of + 1.5 Â V. In addition to these actions, the electrical <b>control</b> <b>box</b> also operates the stepper motor attached to the superior end of the injection device. It should be noted, Outputs 2 and 3 occur when the lances are inserted into the cells.|$|R
50|$|Inline process {{refractometer}}s are {{a type of}} refractometer {{designed for}} the continuous measurement of a fluid flowing through a pipe or inside a tank. First patented by Carl A. Vossberg Jr. US2807976A - Refractometer US2549402A, these refractometers typically consist of a sensor, placed inline with the fluid flow, coupled to a <b>control</b> <b>box.</b> The <b>control</b> <b>box</b> usually provides a digital readout as well as 4-20 mA analog outputs and relay outputs for controlling pumps and valves. Instead of placing the sensor inline of the process, it can {{be placed in a}} bypass, attached by a thin tube.|$|R
5000|$|A typical {{installation}} of ARA/ATA or SCR-274-N sets {{would consist of}} a 3.0 to 6.0 MHz, a [...]19 to [...]55 MHz, and a 6.0 to 9.1 MHz receiver in a three-unit rack. Any two transmitters covering the desired frequency ranges {{would be in the}} transmitter rack. The two transmitters would be fixed-tuned before take-off, with the pilot able to select the desired transmitter and control the mode (Voice, MCW, CW) at the transmitter <b>control</b> <b>box.</b> The receivers were tuned at the pilot's <b>control</b> <b>box</b> by electrical cables and long mechanical tuning shafts, allowing remote control of power, mode, frequency, and volume.|$|R
