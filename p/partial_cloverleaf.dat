The highway travels southeast into Lake Forest Park, where SR104 ends at SR522 {{on the north}} shore of Lake Washington.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{intersection}} with Oak Hill Road, Route4 transitions from a divided arterial highway into a four-lane limited-access freeway. The freeway passes {{to the west}} of Belleville Pond and begins to parallel the alignment of Route102 (Ten Rod Road) near the community of Lafayette. Route4 passes over Amtrak's Northeast Corridor railroad before entering the business district of Wickford Junction. The freeway interchanges with Routes2 and102 at exit5, a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange. After the interchange, Route4 bends to the northeast, beginning a parallel alignment with Route2 that continues to its northern terminus. Route4 crosses into the town of East Greenwich, passing under South Road before interchanging with Route2 at exit6, a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange.|$|E
5|$|In West Friendship, {{northbound}} MD32 {{would have}} {{half of a}} <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with MD144. Access between MD144 and southbound MD32 would be via a right-in/right-out interchange with a frontage road. MD144's intersections with the frontage road and the ramps to and from northbound MD32 will be roundabouts.|$|E
5|$|MD32 {{begins at}} a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> {{interchange}} with I-97 and MD3 (Robert Crain Highway) in Millersville. MD32 starts {{as a pair}} of two-lane flyover ramps that split west from northbound I-97 and join southbound I-97; the MD32 ramps head northwest while I-97 curves to the northeast and settles into the wide median of the northern end of MD3. After passing through its interchange with MD3, MD32 heads northwest as the Patuxent Freeway, a four-lane freeway that passes {{to the north of the}} community of Gambrills. The state highway's first interchange is with Sappington Station Road, a spur from the westbound ramps of MD32 that is unsigned MD32AA. The eastbound ramps connect with county-maintained Burns Crossing Road. MD32 continues northwest along the northern edge of Odenton, where the freeway gradually curves to the southwest, has a diamond interchange with MD170 (Telegraph Road) and a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with MD175 (Annapolis Road), and crosses over the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and MARC's Penn Line between the interchanges.|$|E
5|$|East of Montrose Road, {{the highway}} is a four lane roadway divided by a raised paved median, and passes north {{of a forest}} as it {{approaches}} an interchange with the QEW. As well as a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange that provides almost all directional movements, this four-level stack interchange features two flyovers that arc from south to east {{as well as a}} four lane mainline that curves from north to east, directing most westbound Highway420 traffic onto the Toronto-bound QEW.|$|E
5|$|In Perth, a {{roundabout}} {{was constructed}} at the north-western end of Albany Highway, {{to improve the}} flow of traffic onto and off The Causeway. It opened in 1952, with guides on the usage of the roundabout published in newspapers. In 1973 construction began to upgrade the intersection to a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange at {{the eastern end of}} The Causeway. The $1.3 million interchange opened on 8 March 1974.|$|E
5|$|In the 1950s, roundabouts were {{constructed}} {{at each end}} of The Causeway, to improve the flow of traffic on the bridges and the distribution of traffic back into the road network. The roundabout at the eastern end, connecting with Great Eastern Highway, opened in 1952. In 1973 construction began on upgrading that intersection to a grade-separated <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange. The interchange opened on 8 March 1974, having cost AUS$1.3 million.|$|E
5|$|SR163 {{begins as}} Pearl Street at a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> {{interchange}} with the SR16 freeway in Tacoma north of Tacoma Community College. Pearl Street travels north, serving Woodrow Wilson High School and Truman Middle School, before leaving Tacoma and entering Ruston and serving Point Defiance Elementary School. The highway re-enters Tacoma at Point Defiance Park and passes the Science and Math Institute before traveling onto the Point Defianceâ€“Tahlequah Ferry.|$|E
5|$|SR410 {{begins as}} a freeway at an {{interchange}} with SR167 near Downtown Sumner. The highway travels southeast across suburban areas, crossing the Stuck River and passing a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with Linden Drive, also named Traffic Avenue. After a second <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with Thompson Avenue, SR410 goes under a railroad trestle owned by BNSF Railway and used by Amtrak's Cascades rail service, near the northern bank of the Puyallup River. After turning northeast, SR410 encounters the western terminus of SR162 {{by way of a}} diamond interchange. SR162 travels north into Downtown Sumner as Valley Avenue and south over the Puyallup River towards Orting. The freeway section near the interchange was the busiest recorded part of SR410 in 2008 with a daily average of 59,000motorists using the freeway. Continuing northeast, SR410 connects to 166th Avenue and turns southeast as an undivided highway into the community of Bonney Lake. East of Bonney Lake, the roadway heads east, passing two shopping centers before entering Buckley and intersecting SR165. In Buckley, the street travels northeast through Downtown and turns north to cross the White River and enter King County.|$|E
5|$|The highway veers {{northeast}} and crosses both the Amtrak Northeast Corridor and CSX's Philadelphia Subdivision before Exit 13 with US 40 (Pulaski Highway) and MD 151 (Erdman Avenue); the entrance ramp {{extends from the}} US 40MD 151 <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange immediately {{to the north and}} west. After crossing Herring Run, I-895 meets Moravia Road at Exit 14, a five-ramp <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange that lacks an exit from northbound I-895, which is accessed via Exit 13 and a loop ramp to the northwest. This interchange complements Exit 60 off I-95, where the eastern terminus of Moravia Road meets the planned western terminus of the Windlass Freeway. A branch of the I-95 Express Toll Lanes begin within the interchange with Moravia Road, and there is a ramp from northbound I-895 to the northbound toll lanes. The highway crosses Moores Run before reaching its northern terminus at Exit 62 of I-95 (John F. Kennedy Memorial Highway), a pair of flyover ramps from I-895 to northbound I-95 and from southbound I-95 to I-895 on the boundary between the city of Baltimore and the Baltimore County community of Rosedale.|$|E
5|$|The next {{portion of}} I-97 {{predecessor}} highway was built as the four-lane Glen Burnie Bypass from Robert Crain Highway and New Cut Road {{north to the}} Baltimore Beltway. Construction on the four-lane freeway began in August 1954 with construction of several bridges over or for the highway; these bridges were completed in 1955 and 1956. The dual roadways and interchange ramps from {{the southern end of}} the bypass to MD 648 were constructed starting in March 1955; the concrete-surfaced highway was completed in February 1957. The northernmost portion of the bypass, including the adjacent portion of the Baltimore Beltway, was constructed between December 1955 and September 1957. US 301 was moved onto the bypass and the adjacent portion of the Beltway when the projects were completed in 1957. The small portion of I-97 north of the Beltway was added to the Baltimore Harbor Tunnel project as a direct connection between the Glen Burnie Bypass and the Harbor Tunnel Thruway's southern approach from MD 2 in 1955. This segment was completed and opened with the tunnel and its approach highways in November 1957. The Glen Burnie Bypass was constructed with five interchanges: a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange at MD 3 Business and New Cut Road; a tighter four-ramp <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange at MD 174; a diamond interchange at MD 176; the current four-ramp <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange at MD 648; and a half-cloverleaf interchange at I-695 allowing full access between the Glen Burnie Bypass and Beltway but no access between the Beltway and the Harbor Tunnel Thruway.|$|E
5|$|I-195 curves {{southeast}} and passes under the BWI Trail {{ahead of its}} <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with MD 170 (Aviation Boulevard), {{also known as the}} Airport Loop. The Airport Loop provides access to long-term parking lots, the consolidated rental car facility, hotels, cargo and general aviation facilities, and the BWI Rail Station. The circumferential highway also provides indirect access to I-97 for traffic heading to Annapolis or the Chesapeake Bay Bridge. At this interchange, I-195 ends and the roadway continues as MD 995A towards the entrance to BWI Airport.|$|E
5|$|I-97 {{temporarily}} gains {{two extra}} lanes {{in each direction}} between MD 100 and its <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with MD 176 (Dorsey Road). Access from the southbound Interstate to MD 176 is via MD 162 (Aviation Boulevard), which forms part of the Airport Loop surrounding Baltimoreâ€“Washington International Airport. I-97 continues through Ferndale, where it crosses over the Glen Burnie branch of the Baltimore Light Rail immediately before the highway's four-ramp <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with MD 648 (Baltimoreâ€“Annapolis Boulevard), which provides access to the transit line's terminal station, Cromwell Station / Glen Burnie. I-97's final interchange is with I-695 (Baltimore Beltway). The Interstate crosses the Cabin Branch of Curtis Creek within the interchange, which includes a flyover ramp from I-97 to westbound I-695; that ramp and the one from eastbound I-695 to I-97 merge {{on the inside of}} the two carriageways of the Beltway. The Interstate drops to four lanes and reaches its northern terminus just north of the loop ramp from westbound I-695 to I-97 in Brooklyn Park. The highway continues as I-895A, a pair of ramps that merge with the spur from I-895 (Harbor Tunnel Thruway) to MD 2 (Governor Ritchie Highway). The continuation from I-97 includes a ramp to westbound I-695 that allows access to the Beltway's interchange with MD 648.|$|E
5|$|Roundabouts were {{constructed}} {{at each end}} of The Causeway, to improve the flow of traffic on the bridges and the distribution of traffic back into the road network. The eastern roundabout opened in 1952, while the western one did not open until December 1954. Guides on the usage of the roundabouts were published in newspapers. In 1973 construction began on a grade-separated <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange at the eastern end of the Causeway. The $1.3 million interchange opened on 8 March 1974.|$|E
5|$|Route 147 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with U.S. Route 9 in the Burleigh section of Middle Township, {{heading to the}} east along North Wildwood Boulevard, a two-lane undivided road. The road continues {{to the west of}} U.S. Route 9 as County Route 618 (Indian Trail Road) to Route 47. The road passes residences and businesses to the north and woodland to the south before coming to a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with the Garden State Parkway that has access to and from the northbound direction of the parkway.|$|E
5|$|Route 183 {{begins at}} a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> {{interchange}} with U.S. Route 206 and Interstate 80 {{in the community}} of Roxbury, New Jersey. The route heads northward, intersecting with local dead-end streets deep in the forests of rural Morris County. Route 183 passes a nearby factory and intersects U.S. Route 46. The route continues northward, crossing over a creek and entering downtown Netcong. Downtown Netcong is highly developed, and Route 183 serves as the main street through the community. The highway intersects with Allen Street (Morris County Route 631) before running along the shores of Lake Musconetcong and into Sussex County.|$|E
5|$|SR11, named Chuckanut Drive for its whole route, {{begins at}} a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> {{interchange}} with I-5 north of Burlington. From the interchange, the highway travels northwest through farmland, closely paralleling a BNSF Railway route from Mount Vernon to Bellingham, also {{used by the}} Amtrak Cascades service. The road turns north to intersect Bow Hill Road, formerly SR237 until 1991, east of Edison. SR11 continues north to Blanchard, where it begins to traverse a narrow strip of land between the Chuckanut Mountains and Samish Bay. Midway between Blanchard and the Skagitâ€“Whatcom county line, the highway travels through a hairpin turn at Oyster Creek.|$|E
5|$|In the 1953 New Jersey {{state highway}} renumbering, the state {{highways}} running concurrent with US 1/9 were removed, while Route 25T became US 1/9 Truck and Route 25 between the Tonnele Circle and the Holland Tunnel became US 1/9 Business (now Route 139). In 1964, the US 1/9 {{approaches to the}} George Washington Bridge, which were shared with US 46 on the New Jersey side, were rebuilt into a freeway that {{became a part of}} I-95. Between February 2006 and November 2008, the cloverleaf interchange with Route 35 in Woodbridge Township, which was the first cloverleaf interchange in the United States built in 1929 when this portion of US 1/9 was a part of Route 25, was replaced with a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange, costing $34 million.|$|E
5|$|NY93 {{begins at}} an {{intersection}} with NY18F (Main Street; co-designated but not signed as County Route907 or CR907) {{in the center}} of the village of Youngstown. The route proceeds eastward through the village as a two-lane road named Lockport Street, serving two blocks of commercial areas before bending to the northeast and passing into the residential eastern portion of Youngstown. At the eastern village limits, NY93 briefly widens to four lanes as it enters a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with the Niagara Scenic Parkway. Past the junction, the highway reverts to a two-lane road and changes names to YoungstownLockport Road as it runs across the town of Porter. The residential surroundings continue to the hamlet of Towers Corners, where NY93 connects to NY18 (Creek Road).|$|E
5|$|Near {{the east}} end of the {{commercial}} area on either side of I-95, SR40 becomes a five-lane road with center turn lane. SR40 gains a median again at its intersection with Kings Bay Road, one of several highways that lead to Naval Submarine Base Kings Bay. Another main highway to the naval base is St. Marys Road, which the highway meets at a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange on the boundary between the cities of Kingsland and St. Marys. SR40 intersects a branch of the railroad that heads into the naval base and crosses Dark Entry Creek before meeting the southern end of SR40 Spur (Charlie Smith, Sr., Highway), which heads north along {{the western edge of the}} naval base on its way to Crooked River State Park.|$|E
5|$|Simultaneously, work progressed on the Mosholu Parkway Extension, and Mosholu Avenue {{within the}} park was being {{modified}} {{so that it would}} be bisected by Henry Hudson Parkway. A bridge was constructed over the railroad in 1940, and a road linking the avenue and the new Mosholu Parkway was opened the next year. Mosholu Parkway was then extended to the Henry Hudson Parkway via a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange built near the park's sole freshwater marsh. When biology teachers who used the marsh for their classes raised concerns about construction, an assistant to Moses said that the marsh would get a landscaping so that it looked like a series of lagoons surrounded by shrubbery.|$|E
5|$|US 1 and US 9 {{begin their}} {{concurrency}} at a directional interchange in Woodbridge Township, Middlesex County. US 1 {{comes from the}} southwest, where it serves the city of New Brunswick and Edison Township, while US 9 comes from the south, a short distance {{to the north of}} an interchange with the New Jersey Turnpike (I-95) and the Garden State Parkway. The combined US 1/9 runs northeast through business areas as a six-lane divided highway, coming to a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with Route 35 a short distance after the merge. From this interchange, the road continues as a surface road with some jughandles, passing over New Jersey Transitâ€™s North Jersey Coast Line.|$|E
5|$|After exit6, Route4 {{passes the}} Rhode Island Army National Guard base {{to the east}} and to the Hunt River to the west. Route4 {{northbound}} interchanges with Route403 at exit7; Route403, or the Quonset Freeway, is a four-lane, limited access freeway and spur route of Route4 that serves the Quonset Business Park and the village of Davisville. Heading southbound, exit7 is split into exit7B, which serves the Quonset Freeway, and exit7A, which serves Route402 (Frenchtown Road), another spur route connecting the highway to US1 and Route2. After exit7, Route4 continues northward as a six-lane expressway, passing farmlands to the west and entering a suburban region of East Greenwich. The highway crosses under an overpass at Middle Road before interchanging with Route401, the freeway's final spur, at another <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange. Exit8 is also used to access Route2 and I-95 south, which has no direct freeway connection with Route4 north. Shortly after exit8, the Route4 designation ends and the mainline of the highway defaults onto I-95 north.|$|E
5|$|After passing exit 42, {{the turnpike}} curves away from US-81, turning {{northeast}} toward El Dorado and Emporia. It crosses the Arkansas River between Exits 42 and 45. Exit 45 (Wichita, K-15)) is a trumpet connection to K-15 in southern Wichita. It opened in 1956 {{as one of}} the original interchanges. As the highway continues northeast through Wichita, it comes to Exit 50 (East Wichita), a double-trumpet connection to the parallel Kellogg Avenue, which carries US-54 and US-400. It is one of the original 1956 interchanges. Exit 53, the final Wichita exit, is a trumpet connection to the K-96 freeway. The connector road junctions K-96 at a four-ramp <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange and ends at 127th Street East. The interchange opened c. 1994 along with the nearby piece of K-96.|$|E
5|$|At the {{northern}} edge of the park, the Meadowbrook enters exitM6, a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with several flyover ramps connecting to the Southern State Parkway. After the Southern State interchange, the Meadowbrook continues north through a narrow park known as Barnum Woods, which separates the heavily developed neighborhoods of Uniondale to the west and East Meadow to the east. The highway passes over NY102 (Front Street) with no connection before leaving Barnum Woods and bending northward near exitM5 and the northbound half of exitM4, which serve NY24 (Hempstead Turnpike) and several other local streets by way of a series of service roads in the vicinity of Eisenhower Park, Nassau Coliseum, and Mitchel Field. After another mile (1.6km), the Meadowbrook makes a turn to the west and enters exitM4 southbound and exitM3, which connect to Stewart Avenue (unsigned CR177) via Merchants Concourse. ExitM3 also serves Nassau Community College, located just southwest of the Meadowbrook Parkway.|$|E
5|$|Continuing west, the Meadowbrook State Parkway enters exitM2, a {{cloverleaf}} interchange with Zeckendorf Boulevard (unsigned CR260) {{adjacent to}} nearby Roosevelt Field Mall. Both directions of Zeckendorf Boulevard are accessible southbound, with exitM2E using part of Dibblee Drive; the northbound {{direction of the}} parkway has only one exit, exitM2W for Zeckendorf Boulevard westbound. Past the cloverleaf, the parkway winds back to the northwest as it approaches exitM1, a <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with Old Country Road (unsigned CR25) {{on the border between}} the towns of Hempstead and North Hempstead. The Meadowbrook Parkway continues northwest across Old Country Road into North Hempstead, passing under the Long Island Rail Road's Main Line as it traverses the village of Carle Place. Just north of the community, the Meadowbrook reaches exit31A of the Northern State Parkway, a semi-directional T interchange that serves as {{the north end of the}} Meadowbrook State Parkway.|$|E
5|$|MD 198 curves {{northeast}} and meets {{the northern end}} of MD 197 (Laurel Bowie Road) before crossing the Patuxent River, where the route leaves the city of Laurel and enters Anne Arundel County. The highway, now named Laurel Fort Meade Road, passes one of the main entrances to Laurel Park Racecourse and passes through Maryland City. MD 198 drops to four lanes at its <b>partial</b> <b>cloverleaf</b> interchange with the BaltimoreWashington Parkway (unsigned MD 295) and then becomes a two-lane road a short distance east of the interchange. The state highway crosses the Little Patuxent River, then curves southeast and expands to a four-lane divided highway as it parallels MD 32 (Patuxent Freeway). At the entrance to Tipton Airport, MD 198 curves north and meets MD 32 at a dumbbell interchange. The highway passes through an S-curve then reaches its northern terminus at an entrance to Fort Meade. The road continues into the military installation as Mapes Road.|$|E
