40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{technical}} aspects of innovative hydrogen production concepts based on coal gasification with CO 2 capture. More specifically, it focuses on the technical evaluation and the assessment of performance of a number of plant configurations based on standard entrained flow gasification processes (dry feed and slurry feed types) producing hydrogen at pipeline pressure, which incorporate improvements for increasing hydrogen purity and pressure. Also, different CO 2 capture methods (physical vs. chemical solvents) are assessed. The dry feed type of entrained flow gasifier is currently considered to be the most efficient means of producing hydrogen from coal. The main shortcomings are relatively low hydrogen purity due to the need of using nitrogen as a transport gas for the coal and a <b>pressure</b> <b>limitation</b> of this type of design. The purity issue can be solved by using captured CO 2 or syngas to transport the coal in the gasifier. The <b>pressure</b> <b>limitation</b> can be overcome by using in-plant compression of the raw syngas.

40|$|This paper employs an {{analytic}} reconnection {{model to}} investigate {{the conditions under which}} Hall currents can influence reconnection and Ohmic dissipation rates. It is first noted that time dependent magnetohydrodynamic systems can be analyzed by decomposing the magnetic and velocity fields into guide field and reconnecting field components. A formally exact solution shows that Hall currents can speed up or slow down the reconnection rate depending on the strength and orientation of the axial guide field. In particular, merging solutions are developed in which the axial guide field is the dominant driver of the reconnection. The extent to which Hall currents can alleviate the buildup of back pressures in flux pile-up reconnection models is also examined.

40|$|Background: With {{adaptive}} support ventilation, respiratory {{rate and}} tidal volume (V(T)) are {{a function of}} the Otis least work of breathing formula. We hypothesized that adaptive support ventilation in an open lung ventilator strategy would deliver higher V(T) s to patients with acute lung injury. Methods: Patients with acute lung injury were ventilated according to a local guideline advising the use of lower V(T) (6 - 8 ml/kg predicted body weight), high concentrations of positive end-expiratory pressure, and recruitment maneuvers. Ventilation parameters were recorded when the ventilator was switched to adaptive support ventilation, and after recruitment maneuvers. If V(T) increased more than 8 ml/kg predicted body weight, airway pressure was limited to correct for the rise of V(T). Results: Ten patients with a mean (+/- SD) PaO(2) /FIO(2) of 171 +/- 86 mmHg were included. After a switch from pressure-controlled ventilation to adaptive support ventilation, respiratory rate declined (from 31 +/- 5 to 21 +/- 6 breaths/min; difference = 10 breaths/min, 95 % CI 3 - 17 breaths/min, P = 0. 008) and V(T) increased (from 6. 5 +/- 0. 8 to 9. 0 +/- 1. 6 ml/kg predicted body weight; difference = 2. 5 ml, 95 % CI 0. 4 - 4. 6 ml/kg predicted body weight, P = 0. 02). <b>Pressure</b> <b>limitation</b> corrected for the rise of V(T), but minute ventilation declined, forcing the user to switch back to pressure-controlled ventilation.
