40|$|Base selectivity, <b>proofreading,</b> and postreplication {{mismatch}} repair {{are important for}} replication fidelity. Because <b>proofreading</b> {{plays an important role}} in error correction, we have investigated factors that influence its impact in the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We have utilized a sensitive mutation detection system based on homonucleotide runs of 4 to 14 bases to examine the impact of DNA polymerase delta <b>proofreading</b> on mutation avoidance. The contribution of DNA polymerase delta <b>proofreading</b> on error avoidance was found to be similar to that of DNA polymerase epsilon <b>proofreading</b> in short homonucleotide runs (A 4 and A 5) but much greater than the contribution of DNA polymerase epsilon <b>proofreading</b> in longer runs. We have identified an intraprotein interaction affecting mutation prevention that results from mutations in the replication and the <b>proofreading</b> regions, resulting in an antimutator phenotype relative to a <b>proofreading</b> defect. Finally, a diploid strain with a defect in DNA polymerase delta <b>proofreading</b> exhibits a higher mutation rate than a haploid strain. We suggest that in the diploid population of <b>proofreading</b> defective cells there exists a transiently hypermutable fraction that would be inviable if cells were haploids...|$|R
40|$|The phenomenal {{accuracy}} of biological discrimination {{is due in}} many cases to specific <b>proofreading</b> mechanisms. We have previously developed a macroscopic theory of such mechanisms and applied it {{to the case of}} single-stage <b>proofreading.</b> In this article we apply the theory to systems with multiple stages of <b>proofreading.</b> A specific relationship between improved accuracy due to <b>proofreading</b> and the associated energy cost is given. This is a macroscopic relationship that must be satisfied regardless of the details of the underlying mechanisms. Five factors in the design of such systems are shown to influence their overall accuracy: (1) initial discrimination, (2) number of <b>proofreading</b> stages, (3) <b>proofreading</b> discrimination of each stage, (4) distribution of <b>proofreading</b> effort among the stages, and (5) total energy expended for <b>proofreading.</b> We show that there is an optimal distribution of <b>proofreading</b> effort that, for a given degree of accuracy, minimizes the energy cost of <b>proofreading.</b> We also provide a simple physical interpretation of this minimum condition. These results are used to examine <b>proofreading</b> in two experimental systems for which there is appropriate data available in the literature: the valyl-tRNA synthetase catalyzed misacylation of tRNAVal with threonine and the isoleucyl-tRNA synthetase catalyzed misacylation of tRNAIle with valine. The correlation between the magnitude of a discrimination factor {{and the size of the}} corresponding enzymatic cavity is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Accuracy of {{biological}} discrimination {{at the molecular}} level is known in some systems to involve kinetic <b>proofreading</b> mechanisms. Hopfield and Ninio were the first to propose simple specific kinetic mechanisms for such <b>proofreading</b> and to demonstrate that an energy cost accompanies their improvement in accuracy. Savageau and Freter subsequently derived the explicit cost-accuracy relationship for a broad class of <b>proofreading</b> mechanisms, including the conventional Hopfield-Ninio mechanism just referred to. In other systems, the presence of <b>proofreading</b> mechanisms is in question because the diagnostic features of conventional kinetic <b>proofreading</b> are absent. However, Hopfield has recently proposed an alternative "energy-relay" mechanism, which lacks the characteristic features of conventional <b>proofreading</b> and yet is capable of improving accuracy. In this paper, I use the general cost-accuracy relationship that we have previously derived to examine the energy cost and accuracy of <b>proofreading</b> mechanisms involving an energy relay. The principal findings are the following. First, such mechanisms improve accuracy with a zero cost of <b>proofreading,</b> when "proofreading cost," defined as the cost due specifically to <b>proofreading,</b> is separated from the costs of putting material through the system. Second, the basic energy-relay mechanism discussed by Hopfield has only a modest improvement in accuracy, but a comparable improvement by a conventional <b>proofreading</b> mechanism would have a cost of about 0 [middle dot] 0352 (moles ATP per mole of total product output). Third, accuracy can be increased somewhat if multiple stages of conventional kinetic <b>proofreading</b> precede the energy-relay mechanism. The cost for this improvement is zero while a comparable increase in accuracy achieved by conventional <b>proofreading</b> alone has a cost of about 0 [middle dot] 0385. Finally, I propose an alternative arrangement of energy-relay mechanisms that is capable of increasing accuracy still further. The maximum accuracy achieved by this scheme at zero energy cost is comparable to that achieved by an infinite expenditure of energy in a single stage of conventional <b>proofreading...</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{selected}} {{project was}} a spin-off {{that was being}} developed by an inexperienced team under director Kazuhiro Aoyama. The spin-off was originally intended to introduce a new character {{who would have to}} escape from an infected Raccoon City. However, after the promotion, Capcom decided that Resident Evil protagonist Jill Valentine would be the main character and Raccoon City would be destroyed. Unlike the majority of the early scripts in the series, the scenario of the game was not created by Capcom's Flagship studio but by internal Capcom writer Yasuhisa Kawamura, who had very little experience with the Resident Evil series at the time. Kawamura noted that he had to play the original game to familiarize himself with the series' fictional universe immediately. Nevertheless, the story was <b>proofread</b> and sanctioned by Flagship to avoid continuity errors with other installments in the series, an issue that was also given attention in monthly meetings between all directors and producers.|$|E

Only two analogues, gamma-hydroxyleucine and homocysteine are activated and transferred to tRNALeu where a post-transfer <b>proofreading</b> occurs.

40|$|Organisms require {{faithful}} DNA replication {{to avoid}} deleterious mutations. In yeast, replicative leading- and lagging-strand DNA polymerases (Pols ε and δ, respectively) have intrinsic <b>proofreading</b> exonucleases that cooperate {{with each other}} and mismatch repair to limit spontaneous mutation to less than 1 per genome per cell division. The relationship of these pathways in mammals and their functions in vivo are unknown. Here we show that mouse Pol ε and δ <b>proofreading</b> suppress discrete mutator and cancer phenotypes. We found that inactivation of Pol ε <b>proofreading</b> elevates base-substitution mutations and accelerates a unique spectrum of spontaneous cancers; the types of tumors are entirely different from those triggered by loss of Pol δ <b>proofreading.</b> Intercrosses of Pol ε-, Pol δ-, and mismatch repair-mutant mice show that Pol ε and δ <b>proofreading</b> act in parallel pathways to prevent spontaneous mutation and cancer.

40|$|Abstract: Algorithmic self-assembly, a {{generalization}} of crystal growth, {{has been proposed}} as a mechanism for bottom-up fabrication of complex nanostructures and autonomous DNA computation. In principle, growth can be programmed by designing a set of molecular tiles with binding interactions that enforce assembly rules. In practice, however, errors during assembly cause undesired products, drastically reducing yields. Here we provide experimental evidence that assembly can be made more robust to errors by adding redundant tiles that “proofread ” assembly. We construct DNA tile sets for two methods, uniform and snaked <b>proofreading.</b> While both tile sets are predicted to reduce errors during growth, the snaked <b>proofreading</b> tile set is also designed to reduce nucleation errors on crystal facets. Using atomic force microscopy to image growth of <b>proofreading</b> tiles on ribbon-like crystals presenting long facets, we show that under the physical conditions we studied, the rate of facet nucleation is four-fold smaller for snaked <b>proofreading</b> tile sets than for uniform <b>proofreading</b> tile sets...|$|R

25|$|Mitochondrial DNA is {{susceptible}} to damage from free oxygen radicals from mistakes that occur during the production of ATP through the electron transport chain. These mistakes {{can be caused by}} genetic disorders, cancer, and temperature variations. These radicals can damage mtDNA molecules or change them, making it hard for mitochondrial polymerase to replicate them. Both cases can lead to deletions, rearrangements, and other mutations. Recent evidence has suggested that mitochondria have enzymes that <b>proofread</b> mtDNA and fix mutations that may occur due to free radicals. It is believed that a DNA recombinase found in mammalian cells is also involved in a repairing recombination process. Deletions and mutations due to free radicals have been associated with the aging process. It is believed that radicals cause mutations which lead to mutant proteins, which in turn led to more radicals. This process takes many years and is associated with some aging processes involved in oxygen-dependent tissues such as brain, heart, muscle, and kidney. Auto-enhancing processes such as these are possible causes of degenerative diseases including Parkinson's, Alzheimer's, and coronary artery disease.|$|E
