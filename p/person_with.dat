5|$|Based on Kinsey's scale where 0 {{represents}} a <b>person</b> <b>with</b> an exclusively heterosexual response and 6 {{represents a}} <b>person</b> <b>with</b> an exclusively homosexual one, and numbers in between represent a gradient of responses with both sexes, 6% {{of those interviewed}} ranked as a 6: exclusively homosexual.

However, the Kinsey Report remarked that the ranking described a period in a person's life, and that a person's orientation may change. Among the criticisms the Kinsey Report received, a particular one addressed the Institute for Sex Research's tendency to use statistical sampling, which facilitated an over-representation of same-sex relationships by other researchers who did not adhere to Kinsey's qualifications of data.|$|E

If eating becomes problematic, food will need to be prepared in smaller pieces or even pureed. When swallowing difficulties arise, the use of feeding tubes may be required. In such cases, the medical efficacy and ethics of continuing feeding is an important consideration of the caregivers and family members.

The thoughts, words and bodily activities of each of these six travellers are different based on their mental dispositions and are respectively illustrative of the six leśyās. At one extreme, the <b>person</b> <b>with</b> the black leśyā, having evil disposition, thinks of uprooting the whole tree even though he wants to eat only one fruit. At the other extreme, the <b>person</b> <b>with</b> the white leśyā, having a pure disposition, thinks of picking up the fallen fruit, in order to spare the tree.|$|E
