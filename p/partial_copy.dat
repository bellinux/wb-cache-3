25|$|Turner {{syndrome}} {{is caused by}} the absence of one complete or <b>partial</b> <b>copy</b> of the X chromosome in some or all the cells. The abnormal cells may have only one X (monosomy) (45,X) or they may be affected by one of several types of partial monosomy like a deletion of the short p arm of one X chromosome (46,X,del(Xp)) or the presence of an isochromosome with two q arms (46,X,i(Xq)) Turner syndrome has distinct features {{due to the lack of}} pseudoautosomal regions, which are typically spared from X-inactivation. In mosaic individuals, cells with X monosomy (45,X) may occur along with cells that are normal (46,XX), cells that have partial monosomies, or cells that have a Y chromosome (46,XY). The presence of mosaicism is estimated to be relatively common in affected individuals (67–90%).|$|E
25|$|The first printed version, also in German, {{dates to}} 1725 and was printed in Cologne by Peter Hammer. A <b>partial</b> <b>copy</b> in Hebrew {{is found in}} the Bodleian Library in Oxford, and dates from around 1740. A {{manuscript}} copy existed in French in the Bibliothèque de l'Arsenal in Paris, an institution founded in 1797. The French copy has since disappeared, but is available on microfilm. Another 17th-century manuscript in Italian exists in the 'Legato Martinengo' of the Queriniana Library in Brescia, Italy. It was part of the collection of the Count and Qabbalist Leopardo Martinengo of Barco and Pallavicina. The manuscript, unknown for centuries to international researchers until 2009, has been found by academic researcher Maria Elena Loda in the esoteric section. At the moment, it is the only known manuscript translation in Italian language of the Abramelin grimoire.|$|E

Davison would publish this as Nineteen Eighty-Four: The Facsimile of the Extant Manuscript by Houghton Mifflin Harcourt in May 1984, [...]) In addition, Orwell produced several pieces while working at the BBC as a correspondent. Some were written by him and others were merely recited for radio broadcast. For years, these went uncollected until the anthologies Orwell: The War Broadcasts (Marboro Books, June 1985 and in the United States, as Orwell: The Lost Writings by Arbor House, September 1985) and Orwell: The War Commentaries (Gerald Duckworth & Company Ltd., London, 1 January 1985) were edited by W. J. West. Orwell was responsible for producing The Indian Section of BBC Eastern Service and his program notes from 1 February and 7 December 1942, have survived (they are reproduced in War Broadcasts). He was also asked to provide an essay about British cooking along with recipes for The British Council. Orwell kept a diary which has been published by his widow—Sonia Brownell—and academic Peter Davison, in addition to his private correspondence.|$|E

Since <b>partial</b> <b>copies</b> and similar copies are always applied in plagiarisms of line drawings, we propose combining the technique of object detection and image retrieval to detect similar <b>partial</b> <b>copies</b> from suspicious images: first, detecting regions of interest (ROIs) by a cascade classifier; then, locate the corresponding source parts from copyrighted images using a feature matching method.

500|$|Upon {{arriving}} in England in June 1858, Morphy promptly challenged Staunton to a match. At first, Staunton declined Morphy's offer {{saying that the}} challenge came too late. Morphy did not give up negotiations and urging Staunton to play. In early July Staunton agreed provided he was given {{time to get back}} into practice on openings and endgames, and provided that he could manage all this without breaking the publication contract for his Shakespearean work. In early August, Morphy wrote asking Staunton when the match could occur, and Staunton asked again for a delay of some weeks. Staunton competed in a tournament that started in on 22 August in Birmingham, but this was a knock-out tournament and he was eliminated in the second round by Johann Löwenthal, after playing a total of four games. This was to be Staunton's last public chess competition. H. J. R. Murray wrote that Staunton had overexerted himself and damaged his health by trying both to get ahead of schedule on the Shakespeare project and to play some competitive chess. Just before Staunton left London for Birmingham, his old enemy George Walker published an article accusing him of trying to delay the match indefinitely, and Staunton received another letter from Morphy pressing him to name a date for the match. Staunton and Morphy met socially in Birmingham and, after a tense discussion, Staunton agreed to play in early November. Just after the tournament a letter signed by [...] "Anti-book" [...] appeared in Staunton's column in The Illustrated London News, alleging that Morphy did not actually have the money for his share of the stakes. This letter is widely thought to have been written by Staunton himself; if so, he must have written it immediately after reading Walker's article and Morphy's letter and immediately before leaving for Birmingham. Around this time Morphy wrote to friends in the US asking them to obtain the stake money for the Staunton match. Morphy's family refused to contribute as they [...] "should not allow him to play a money match either with his own money or anyone else's", but the New Orleans Chess Club sent £500. Meanwhile, Morphy went to Paris to play against continental masters. In September The Illustrated London News printed both a complimentary full-page article about Morphy and a complimentary mention of him in its chess column. On 6 October 1858, while in Paris Morphy wrote Staunton an open letter which was also circulated to several publications, in which Morphy complained about Staunton's conduct. Staunton replied on 9 October, re-stating the difficulties he faced, but now giving them as reasons to cancel the match. On 23 October, Staunton published his entire reply along with a <b>partial</b> <b>copy</b> of Morphy's open letter, omitting the reference to the [...] "Anti-book" [...] letter. Various chess columns then printed anonymous and acrimonious letters. Morphy took no part in any of this, but wrote to Lord Lyttelton, the president of the British Chess Association, explaining his own efforts to bring about the match, accusing Staunton of avoiding the match by all means short of admitting he did not wish to play, complaining about Staunton's representation of the facts in The Illustrated London News, and demanding [...] "that you shall declare to the world it is through no fault of mine that this match has not taken place." [...] Lyttelton replied that it was reasonable for Staunton to decline the match, but that in his opinion Staunton should have done so plainly in his first letter to America, but had instead often given the impression that he would soon be ready to start the match.|$|E

2500|$|The lost The Justice of Trajan and Herkinbald, which survived {{until the}} end of the 17th century, {{consisted}} of four large panels representing the Justice of Trajan and Justice of Herkenbald. These were commissioned by the City of Brussels for the Gulden Camere (Golden Chamber) of the Brussels Town Hall. The first and third panels were signed, and the first dated 1439. All four were finished before 1450. They were destroyed in the French Bombardment of Brussels in 1695, but are known from many surviving descriptions, from a free <b>partial</b> <b>copy</b> in tapestry (Bern, Historisches Museum) and from other free and partial copies in drawing and painting. The paintings probably measured about 4.5m each, which was an enormous scale for a painting on panel at that time. They served as 'examples of justice' for the aldermen of the city who had to speak justice in this room. [...] The paintings were praised or described by a series of commentators until their destruction, including Dürer (1520), Vasari (1568), Molanus (c. 1570–1580), and Baldinucci (1688).|$|E

40|$|The genome of Salmonella enterica subsp. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain LT 2 was {{analyzed}} for direct repeats, and 54 sequences containing variable-number tandem repeat loci were identified. Ten primer pairs that anneal {{upstream and downstream}} of each selected locus were designed and used to amplify PCR targets in isolates of S. enterica serovars Typhimurium and Newport. Four of the 10 loci did not show polymorphism in the length of products. Six loci were selected for analysis. Isolates of S. enterica serovars Typhimurium and Newport that were related to specific outbreaks and showed identical pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns were indistinguishable by {{the length of the}} six variable-number tandem repeats. Isolates that differed in their pulsed-field gel electrophoresis patterns showed polymorphism in variable-number tandem repeat profiles. Length of the products was confirmed by DNA sequence analysis.

Named the neuronal apoptosis inhibitor protein (NAIP) gene, it is believed to inhibit the normal process of apoptosis [...] the disintegration of single cells that results from programmed cell death [...] in motor neurons. The researchers who found the NAIP gene also discovered that healthy people carry one complete copy of the gene along with many other <b>partial</b> <b>copies.</b> Many children with SMA have the <b>partial</b> <b>copies</b> but not the complete gene.

40|$|A highly error {{resilient}} mode of {{the newly}} standardized 3 GPP EVS speech codec is described. Compared to the AMR-WB codec and other conversational codecs, the EVS channel aware mode offers significantly improved error resilience in voice communication over packet-switched networks such as Voiceover- IP (VoIP) and Voice-over-LTE (VoLTE). The error resilience is achieved using a form of in-band forward error correction. Source-controlled coding techniques are used to identify candidate speech frames for bitrate reduction, leaving spare bits for transmission of <b>partial</b> <b>copies</b> of prior frames such that a constant bit rate is maintained.

Search engines are highly interested in detecting copies of entire web documents to avoid displaying the same content multiple times in the result. Document fingerprinting is an efficient technique for the accurate detection of full and <b>partial</b> <b>copies</b> between documents.
