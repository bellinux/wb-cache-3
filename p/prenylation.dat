25|$|The MK-4 form {{of vitamin}} K2 is {{produced}} by conversion of vitamin K1 in the testes, pancreas, and arterial walls. While major questions still surround the biochemical pathway for this transformation, the conversion is not dependent on gut bacteria, as it occurs in germ-free rats and in parenterally-administered K1 in rats. In fact, tissues that accumulate high amounts of MK-4 have a remarkable capacity to convert up to 90% of the available K1 into MK-4. There {{is evidence that the}} conversion proceeds by removal of the phytyl tail of K1 to produce menadione as an intermediate, which is then condensed with an activated geranylgeranyl moiety (see also <b>prenylation)</b> to produce vitamin K2 in the MK-4 (menatetrione) form.|$|E
25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, MAPKs typically form multi-tiered pathways, receiving input {{several levels}} above the actual MAP kinase. In {{contrast to the}} relatively simple, phosphorylation-dependent activation mechanism of MAPKs and MAP2Ks, MAP3Ks have stunningly complex regulation. Many of the better-known MAP3Ks, such as c-Raf, MEKK4 or MLK3 require multiple steps for their activation. These are typically allosterically-controlled enzymes, tighly locked into an inactive state by multiple mechanisms. The first step en route to their activation consist of relieving their autoinhibition by a smaller ligand (such as Ras for c-Raf, GADD45 for MEKK4 or Cdc42 for MLK3). This commonly (but not always) happens at the cell membrane, where most of their activators are bound (note that small G-proteins are constitutively membrane-associated due to <b>prenylation).</b> That step is followed by side-to-side homo- and heterodimerisation of their now accessible kinase domains. Recently determined complex structures reveal that the dimers are formed in an orientation that leaves both their substrate-binding regions free. Importantly, this dimerisation event also forces the MAP3 kinase domains to adopt a partially active conformation. Full activity is only achieved once these dimers transphosphorylate each other on their activation loops. The latter step can also be achieved or aided by auxiliary protein kinases (MAP4 kinases, members of the Ste20 family). Once a MAP3 kinase is fully active, it may phosphorylate its substrate MAP2 kinases, which in turn will phosphorylate their MAP kinase substrates.|$|E
2500|$|A special form of {{glycosylation}} is {{the formation}} of a GPI anchor. In this kind of glycosylation a protein is attached to a lipid anchor, via a glycan chain. (See also <b>prenylation.)</b> ...|$|E
2500|$|Ras is {{attached}} to the cell membrane owing to its <b>prenylation</b> and palmitoylation (HRAS and NRAS) or the combination of <b>prenylation</b> and a polybasic sequence adjacent to the <b>prenylation</b> site (KRAS). The C-terminal CaaX box of Ras first gets farnesylated at its Cys residue in the cytosol, allowing Ras to loosely insert into the membrane of the endoplasmatic reticulum and other cellular membranes. The Tripeptide (aaX) is then cleaved from the C-terminus by a specific prenyl-protein specific endoprotease and the new C-terminus is methylated by a methyltransferase. KRas processing is completed at this stage. [...] Dynamic electrostatic interactions between its positively charged basic sequence with negative charges at the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane account for its predominant localization at the cell surface at steady-state. NRAS and HRAS are further processed {{on the surface of the}} Golgi apparatus by palmitoylation of one or two Cys residues, respectively, adjacent to the CaaX box. The proteins thereby become stably membrane anchored (lipid-rafts) and are transported to the plasma membrane on vesicles of the secretory pathway. Depalmitoylation eventually releases the proteins from the membrane, allowing them to enter another cycle of palmitoylation and depalmitoylation. This cycle is believed to prevent the leakage of NRAS and HRAS to other membranes over time and to maintain their steady-state localization along the Golgi apparatus, secretory pathway, plasma membrane and inter-linked endocytosis pathway.|$|E
2500|$|Disruption of the HMG CoA-reductase pathway at {{the level}} of FPPS {{prevents}} the formation of two metabolites (farnesol and geranylgeraniol) that are essential for connecting some small proteins to the cell membrane. This phenomenon is known as <b>prenylation,</b> and is important for proper sub-cellular protein trafficking (see [...] "lipid-anchored protein" [...] for the principles of this phenomenon).|$|E
2500|$|While {{inhibition}} of protein <b>prenylation</b> may affect many proteins {{found in an}} osteoclast, disruption to the lipid modification of Ras, Rho, Rac proteins has been speculated to underlie the effects of bisphosphonates. These proteins can affect both osteoclastogenesis, cell survival, and cytoskeletal dynamics. In particular, the cytoskeleton is vital for maintaining the [...] "ruffled border" [...] that is required for contact between a resorbing osteoclast and a bone surface.|$|E
2500|$|Aside {{from its}} {{oxidation}} to cystine, cysteine participates in numerous posttranslational modifications. [...] The nucleophilic thiol group allows cysteine to conjugate to other groups, e.g., in <b>prenylation.</b> Ubiquitin ligases transfer ubiquitin to its pendant, proteins, and caspases, which engage in proteolysis in the apoptotic cycle. [...] Inteins often function {{with the help}} of a catalytic cysteine. [...] These roles are typically limited to the intracellular milieu, where the environment is reducing, and cysteine is not oxidized to cystine.|$|E
2500|$|Lipid {{anchored}} proteins are covalently {{attached to}} different fatty acid acyl chains on the cytoplasmic {{side of the}} cell membrane via palmitoylation, myristoylation, or <b>prenylation.</b> At the cell surface, {{on the opposite side}} of the cell membrane lipid anchored proteins are covalently attached to the lipids glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) and cholesterol. Protein association with membranes through the use of acylated residues is a reversible process, as the acyl chain can be buried in a protein's hydrophobic binding pocket after dissociation from the membrane. This process occurs within the beta-subunits of G-proteins [...] Perhaps because of this additional need for structural flexibility, lipid anchors are usually bound to the highly flexible segments of proteins tertiary structure that are not well resolved by protein crystallographic studies.|$|E
50|$|Small {{molecules}} {{can also}} undergo <b>prenylation,</b> {{such as in}} the case of prenylflavonoids. Recently it was described <b>prenylation</b> of a vitamin B2 derivative (flavin mononucleotide).|$|E
50|$|Proteins that undergo <b>prenylation</b> include Ras, {{which plays}} {{a central role}} in the {{development}} of cancer. This suggests that inhibitors of <b>prenylation</b> enzymes (e.g., farnesyltransferase) may influence tumor growth. In the case of the K- and N-Ras forms of Ras, when cells are treated with FTIs, these forms of Ras can undergo alternate <b>prenylation</b> in the form of geranylgeranylation. Recent work has shown that farnesyltransferase inhibitors (FTIs) also inhibit Rab geranylgeranyltransferase and that the success of such inhibitors in clinical trials may be as much due to effects on Rab <b>prenylation</b> as on Ras <b>prenylation.</b> It should be noted that inhibitors of prenyltransferase enzymes display different specificity for the prenyltransferases, dependent upon the specific compound being utilized.|$|E
50|$|One form of C-terminal {{modification}} is <b>prenylation.</b> During <b>prenylation,</b> a farnesyl- or geranylgeranyl-isoprenoid membrane anchor {{is added}} to a cysteine residue near the C-terminus. Small, membrane-bound G proteins are often modified this way.|$|E
50|$|Protein <b>prenylation</b> {{involves}} {{the transfer of}} either a farnesyl or a geranyl-geranyl moiety to C-terminal cysteine(s) of the target protein. There are three enzymes that carry out <b>prenylation</b> in the cell, farnesyl transferase, Caax protease and geranylgeranyl transferase I.|$|E
5000|$|... #Subtitle level 3: Decreasing of {{specific}} protein <b>prenylation</b> ...|$|E
5000|$|A 2012 {{study found}} that statin {{treatment}} increases lifespan and improves cardiac health in Drosophila by decreasing specific protein <b>prenylation.</b> The study concluded, [...] "These data are the most direct evidence to date that decreased protein <b>prenylation</b> can increase cardiac health and lifespan in any metazoan species, and may explain the pleiotropic (non-cholesterol related) health effects of statins." ...|$|E
5000|$|Geranylgeranylation {{is a form}} of <b>prenylation,</b> {{which is}} a post-translational {{modification}} of proteins that involves the attachment of one or two 20-carbon lipophilic geranylgeranyl isoprene units from geranylgeranyl diphosphate to one or two cysteine residue(s) at the C-terminus of specific proteins. <b>Prenylation</b> (including geranylgeranylation) is thought to function, at least in part, as a membrane anchor for proteins.|$|E
5000|$|... isoprenylation or <b>prenylation,</b> the {{addition}} of an isoprenoid group (e.g. farnesol and geranylgeraniol) ...|$|E
5000|$|As {{the name}} suggests, prenylated {{proteins}} are proteins with covalently attached hydrophobic isoprene polymers (i.e. branched five-carbon hydrocarbon) at cysteine residues of the protein. More specifically, these isoprenoid groups, usually farnesyl (15-carbon) and geranylgeranyl (20-carbon) {{are attached to}} the protein via thioether linkages at cysteine residues near the C terminal of the protein. This <b>prenylation</b> of lipid chains to proteins facilitate their interaction with the cell membrane. [...] The <b>prenylation</b> motif “CAAX box” is the most common <b>prenylation</b> site in proteins, that is, the site where farnesyl or geranylgeranyl covalently attach. In the CAAX box sequence, the C represents the cysteine that is prenylated, the A’s represent any aliphatic amino acid and the X determines the type of <b>prenylation</b> that will occur. If the X is an Ala, Met, Ser or Gln the protein will be farnesylated via the farnesyltransferase enzyme and if the X is a Leu then the protein will be geranylgeranylated via the geranylgeranyltransferase I enzyme. Both of these enzymes are similar with each containing two subunits.|$|E
50|$|After 2-succinylbenzoic acid {{has been}} produced, a cyclization, a <b>prenylation,</b> a methylation, and an {{oxidation}} occur which yields a napthoquinone.|$|E
50|$|The {{complete}} gene {{of human}} CERK contains 4459bp, {{which consists of}} a 123bp-5’-untranslated region, a 2772bp 3’-non-coding, and a 1611bp open reading frame. Sequence analysis of CERK putatively suggests that the following post-translational modification sites exist: 4 N-glycosylation sites, 15 phosphorylation sites, 5 <b>prenylation</b> sites, and 2 amidation sites. The complete gene of mouse CERK differed slightly, containing a 1593bp open reading frame. The decreased length of the open reading frame results {{in the loss of}} 2 <b>prenylation</b> sites and 1 amidation site.|$|E
50|$|Humulone can be {{synthesized}} by the acylation of 1,2,3,5-benzenetetrol with isovaleryl chloride to give 2,3,4,6-tetrahydroxyisovalerophenone. This step {{is followed}} by <b>prenylation</b> with 1-bromo-3-methyl-2-butene to give humulone.|$|E
50|$|Note that, in the HMG-CoA reductase/mevalonate pathway, the {{precursors}} already contain a pyrophosphate group, and isoprenoids are produced with a pyrophosphate group. There is no known enzyme activity that can {{carry out the}} <b>prenylation</b> reaction with the isoprenoid alcohol. However, enzymatic activity for isoprenoid kinases capable converting isoprenoid alcohols to isoprenoid pyrophosphates have been shown. In accordance with this, farnesol and geranylgeraniol {{have been shown to}} be able to rescue effects caused by statins or nitrogenous bisphosphonates, further supporting that alcohols can be involved in <b>prenylation,</b> likely via phosphorylation to the corresponding isoprenoid pyrophosphate.|$|E
50|$|Oxysterols are {{oxidized}} derivatives of cholesterol, {{which may}} be important in many biological processes, including cholesterol homeostasis, atherosclerosis, sphingolipid metabolism, platelet aggregation, apoptosis, and protein <b>prenylation,</b> though their roles are poorly understood.|$|E
5000|$|A special form of {{glycosylation}} is {{the formation}} of a GPI anchor. In this kind of glycosylation a protein is attached to a lipid anchor, via a glycan chain. (See also <b>prenylation.)</b> ...|$|E
50|$|Farnesylation {{is a type}} of <b>prenylation,</b> a post-translational {{modification}} of proteins by which an isoprenyl group is added to a cysteine residue. It is an important process to mediate protein-protein interactions and protein-membrane interactions.|$|E
50|$|It is {{not known}} how mevalonate kinase {{mutations}} cause the febrile episodes, although it is presumed that other products of the cholesterol biosynthesis pathyway, the <b>prenylation</b> chains (geranylgeraniol and farnesol) might play a role.|$|E
50|$|No conserved glycolation {{sites are}} {{predicted}} within the mature DEPDC1B protein product. No signal peptide or transmembrane domains are predicted within human or any ortholog protein. No <b>prenylation</b> sites are predicted in any DEPDC1B orthologs.|$|E
5000|$|Mutations {{that prevent}} the {{expression}} of Rab27 ('knock out' mutations) cause the hypopigmentation and immunodefficiency disorder known as type II Griscelli syndrome, while a decrease in Rab27 <b>prenylation</b> {{is thought to be}} involved in choroideremia.|$|E
50|$|Post-translational {{modification}} of proteins can include: acetylation, acylation (myristoylation, palmitoylation), alkylation, arginylation, ADP-Ribosylation, biotinylation, formylation, geranylgeranylation, glutamylation, glycosylation, glycylation, hydroxylation, isoprenylation, lipoylation, methylation, nitroalkylation, phosphopantetheinylation, phosphorylation, <b>prenylation,</b> selenation, S-nitrosylation, succinylation, sulfation, transglutamination and ubiquitination (sumoylation, neddylation).|$|E
50|$|FAM63A {{contains}} 25 phosphorylation sties in humans, including 12 serine, 10 threonine, and 3 tyrosine. Additionally, {{there are}} 5 N-myristoylation sites, {{and there is}} 1 <b>prenylation</b> site. FAM63A contains no glycosylation sites, transmembrane domains, or signal peptides.|$|E
50|$|A 2012 {{clinical}} trial explored {{the approach of}} inhibiting protein <b>prenylation</b> {{with some degree of}} success in the treatment of Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome, a multisystem disorder which causes failure to thrive and accelerated atherosclerosis leading to early death.|$|E
5000|$|PDE6β is {{the only}} protein that {{undergoes}} {{the two types of}} post-translational modification, <b>prenylation</b> and carboxymethylation. [...] The geranylgeranyl group of PDE6B is the result of these modifications, which are responsible for the rod PDE6's interaction with membrane.|$|E
50|$|Three PRL genes were {{described}} in mammals (PRL-1, PRL-2 and PRL-3). They share a high sequence identity and possess an N-terminal <b>prenylation</b> sequence (CAAX box). Despite their up-regulation in colorectal cancer, {{the role and}} substrate specificity of PRLs is poorly known.|$|E
50|$|In signal {{transduction}} via G protein, palmitoylation of the α subunit, <b>prenylation</b> of the γ subunit, and myristoylation {{is involved in}} tethering the G protein to the inner surface of the plasma membrane so that the G protein can interact with its receptor.|$|E
50|$|Some {{important}} <b>prenylation</b> chains {{that are}} involved in the HMG-CoA reductase metabolic pathway are geranylgeraniol, farnesol and dolichol. These isoprene polymers (e.g. geranyl pyrophosphate and farnesyl pyrophosphate) are involved in the condensations via enzymes such as prenyltransferase that eventually cyclizes to form cholesterol.|$|E
50|$|Prenylated {{proteins}} {{are particularly}} important for eukaryotic cell growth, differentiation and morphology. Furthermore, protein <b>prenylation</b> is a reversible post-translational modification to the cell membrane. This dynamic interaction of prenylated proteins with the cell membrane is important for their signalling functions and is often deregulated in disease processes such as cancer. More specifically, Ras is the protein that undergoes <b>prenylation</b> via farnesyltransferase {{and when it is}} switched on it can turn on genes involved in cell growth and differentiation. Thus overactiving Ras signalling can lead to cancer. An understanding of these prenylated proteins and their mechanisms have been important for the drug development efforts in combating cancer. Other prenylated proteins include members of the Rab and Rho families as well as lamins.|$|E
50|$|Statins, by {{inhibiting}} the HMG CoA reductase pathway, simultaneously {{inhibit the}} production of both cholesterol and specific prenylated proteins (see diagram).This inhibitory effect on protein <b>prenylation</b> may be involved, at least partially, in the improvement of endothelial function, modulation of immune function, and other pleiotropic cardiovascular benefits of statins, {{as well as in}} the fact that a number of other drugs that lower LDL have not shown the same cardiovascular risk benefits in studies as statins, and may also account for certain of the benefits seen in cancer reduction with statins. In addition, the inhibitory effect on protein <b>prenylation</b> may also be involved in a number of unwanted side effects associated with statins, including muscle pain (myopathy) and elevated blood sugar (diabetes).|$|E
