5|$|Following {{the end of}} the Cold War, the Army began {{a process}} of {{downsizing}} its forces. The Army reactivated the 29th Infantry Division and began reorganizing its forces and further consolidating them. As a result, the Army decided to downsize the 26th Infantry Division into a brigade, and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>under</b> the command of the 29th Infantry Division. On 1 September 1993, the division was inactivated, and the 26th Infantry Brigade designated in its place, based in Springfield. The 3rd and 43rd brigades, 26th Infantry Division were inactivated, and the 86th Infantry Brigade was put under the command of the 42nd Infantry Division. On 1 October 1995, the division was formally designated the 26th Brigade, 29th Infantry Division. In 2004, the 26th Brigade transitioned into the 26th (Yankee) Infantry Brigade Combat Team.|$|E

Morelos and his men held out for 58 days when {{reinforcement}} arrived, breaking the siege. This {{was one of the}} early vital wins for the insurgent movement. Morelos would eventually be captured by royalists and executed in 1815, but the memory of this battle would lead to the future state being named after him.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, in Mexico City, {{the actions}} of the Audiencia {{attracted}} the attention of Juan de Zumárraga, bishop of Mexico, who <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>under</b> an ecclesiastical interdiction on March 7, 1530. The immediate cause of the interdiction was a case of violation of sanctuary. The Audiencia had violently taken from the convent of San Francisco a servant of Cortés accused of grave crimes, and two religious, Cristóbal de Angulo and García de Llerena.|$|E
25|$|Marshal Duras, Vauban, and 30,000 men – {{all under}} the nominal command of the Dauphin – besieged the Elector of Trier's {{fortress}} of Philippsburg on 27 September 1688; after a vigorous defence it fell on 30 October. Louis XIV's army proceeded to take Mannheim, which capitulated on 11 November, shortly followed by Frankenthal. Other towns fell without resistance, including Oppenheim, Worms, Bingen, Kaiserslautern, Heidelberg, Speyer and, above all, the key fortress of Mainz.

At Olomouc the Office of Faculty Directors was established in 1752: the Directors were directly answerable to the Queen. In 1754 there were 10 professors of theology giving lectures to 241 students, 5 professors of philosophy giving lectures to 389 students and 3 professors of law giving lectures to 40 students. The number of students reached its peak in 1772, when there were altogether 1859 of them.|$|E
25|$|After the Second World War, the {{railroad}} industry's downturn and dwindling profits caused the PRR to stop subsidizing the LIRR, and the LIRR went into receivership in 1949. The State of New York, realizing how important {{the railroad}} was to Long Island's future, began to subsidize the railroad in the 1950s and 1960s. In 1966, New York State bought the railroad's controlling stock from the PRR and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>under</b> the newly formed Metropolitan Commuter Transportation Authority (renamed Metropolitan Transportation Authority in 1968). With MTA subsidies the LIRR modernized further, continuing to be the busiest commuter railroad in the United States.|$|E
25|$|Panic and consternation reigned in Charleston at {{the news}} of the fall of the fort. A truce of six months was agreed to during which peace {{attempts}} failed. After a difficult winter for the Cherokee due to the loss of the Lower Towns' harvest and shortage of ammunition for hunting, as well as disease, Cherokee morale still remained high. In a goodwill gesture, the Cherokee allowed Fort Prince George to receive a limited amount of supplies and even though it was almost as vulnerable as Fort Loudoun had been the Cherokee did ot <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>under</b> close siege.|$|E

25|$|The Bavarians {{soon came}} under the {{dominion}} of the Franks, probably without a serious struggle. The Franks regarded this border area as a buffer zone against peoples to the east, such as the Avars and the Slavs, and {{as a source of}} manpower for the army. Sometime around 550 AD they <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>under</b> the administration of a duke - possibly Frankish or possibly chosen from amongst the local leading families - who was supposed to act as a regional governor for the Frankish king. The first duke known was Garibald I, a member of the powerful Agilolfing family. This {{was the beginning of a}} series of Agilolfing dukes that was to last until 788 AD.|$|E
25|$|A castle {{was built}} by the English to protect and {{dominate}} this position. It was located at what is now Castle Place, where several roads meet {{at the top of}} High Street. The castle was attacked, recovered, destroyed and rebuilt many times. It was first destroyed in 1315 by Edward le Bruce, who came to Ireland on the invitation of O'Neill and other Irish chieftains. The replacement building was dismantled in 1503 by Gerald, Earl of Kildare, rebuilt by the Irish and subsequently destroyed by the same Earl of Kildare in 1512. In 1552 Lord Deputy James Croft fortified the castle and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>under</b> the command of Hugh Mac Neil Oge, who swore allegiance to the English crown. When Mac Neil Oge was killed by Scottish attackers in 1555, the castle was committed to the custody of Englishman Randolphus Lane. The old Belfast Castle was eventually destroyed by fire on 25 April 1708.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Selkirk set {{out from}} Montreal with around 140 {{discharged}} soldiers from the De Meuron and De Watteville regiments, his sergeant's detachment of the 37th Regiment and around 150 HBC servants {{with a number of}} artillery and even an oven for heating cannonballs. His plan was to travel the Great Lakes route but to avoid Fort William by taking the Fond-du-lac / Rainy Lake route to the Red River. On March 20, Colin Robertson’s men captured Fort Pembina, arrested several NWC employees and Métis and confiscated the fort’s arms and ammunition. Around this time, Governor Semple built the armed schooner named “Cuthullin” to deny NWC access to Lake Winnipeg and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>under</b> the command of Lieutenant Holte. He also erected a battery on the shore of the Red River to prevent NWC boats from passing. In his spare time, Colin Robertson tested the readiness of the HBC blockade by floating an old, empty boat down river, unbeknown to the blockaders. Upon seeing it, the men rushed out and began firing at it without orders.|$|E

The Radical deputy Felice Cavallotti ridiculed the conspiracy of Crispi, poking fun at [...] "the famous treaty between the Emperor of Russia, the President of the French Republic, and Mr De Felice". The so-called [...] "Treaty of Bisacquino" [...] was so named not because it was signed in the Sicilian town, but because it had been invented by the Director of Public Safety of Bisacquino, the Neapolitan Sessi.|$|E
500|$|Toward music {{more adventurous}} than Wagner's, {{especially}} that of Richard Strauss and later Claude Debussy, Rimsky-Korsakov's mind remained closed. He would fume for days afterwards {{when he heard}} pianist Felix Blumenfeld play Debussy's Estampes and write in his diary about them, [...] "Poor and skimpy to the nth degree; there is no technique, even less imagination." [...] This {{was part of an}} increasing musical conservatism on his part (his [...] "musical conscience," [...] as he <b>put</b> <b>it),</b> <b>under</b> which he now scrutinized his music and that of others as well. Compositions by his former compatriots in The Five were not immune. While working on his first revision of Mussorgsky's Boris Godunov, in 1895 he would tell his amanuensis, Vasily Yastrebtsev, [...] "It's incredible that I ever could have liked this music and yet it seems there was such a time." [...] By 1901 he would write of growing [...] "indignant at all [...] blunders of the ear"—this about the same music which caught his attention in 1889.|$|E
500|$|Earl Sigurd {{had a hard}} {{battle against}} Kerthialfad, and Kerthialfad came on so fast that he laid low all {{who were in the}} front rank, and he broke the array of Earl Sigurd right up to his banner, and slew the banner-bearer. Then he got another man to bear the banner, and there was again a hard fight. Kerthialfad smote this man too his death blow at once, and so on one after the other all who stood near him. Then Earl Sigurd called on Thorstein the son of Hall of Sida, to bear the banner, and Thorstein was just about to lift the banner, but then Asmund the White said, [...] "Don't bear the banner! For all they who bear it get their death." [...] "Hrafn the Red!" [...] called out Earl Sigurd, [...] "bear thou the banner." [...] "Bear thine own devil thyself," [...] {{answered}} Hrafn. Then the earl said, [...] "`Tis fittest that the beggar should bear the bag;'" [...] and with that he took the banner from the staff and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>under</b> his cloak.

500|$|Financial {{problems}} compounded the VNQDD's difficulties. Money {{was needed}} {{to set up a}} commercial enterprise, a cover for the revolutionaries to meet and plot, and for raising funds. For this purpose, a hotel-restaurant named the Vietnam Hotel was opened in September 1928. The French colonial authorities were aware of the real purpose of the business, and <b>put</b> <b>it</b> <b>under</b> surveillance without taking further preliminary action. The first notable reorganisation of the VNQDD was in December, when Nguyen Khac Nhu replaced Hoc as chairman. Three proto-governmental organs were created, to form the legislative, executive and judicial arms of government. The records of the French secret service estimated that by early 1929, the VNQDD consisted of approximately 1,500 members in 120 cells, mostly in areas around the Red River Delta. The intelligence reported that most members were students, minor merchants or low-level bureaucrats in the French administration. The report stated that there were landlords and wealthy peasants among the members, but that few were of scholar-gentry (mandarin) rank. According to the historian Cecil B. Currey, [...] "The VNQDD's lower-class origins made it, in many ways, closer to the labouring poor than were the Communists, many of whom… from established middle-class families." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{workload}} of the Registrar {{has increased}} {{over time as}} the university has increased in size and complexity. In 1914, the Registry had a staff of five; there were eight staff members in 1930 and forty in 1958. Typewriters were rare before 1925 and there was, until then, no diary of recurring dates, with everything depending (in {{the words of a}} later Registrar, Sir Douglas Veale, appointed in 1930) [...] "on someonegenerally the registrar's secretaryhappening to remember." [...] A commission headed by the former prime minister H. H. Asquith recommended in 1922 that Oxford should improve its administration and that the Registrar should become a more significant figure; Veale's appointment was a recognition of this need. In addition, external pressures from the requirements of the University Grants Committee and other governmental funding mechanisms also required more work from the Registrar and staff. As the historian Brian Harrison <b>put</b> <b>it,</b> <b>under</b> Veale (Registrar 1930–1958), Oxford's administration was [...] "edging ...slowly from decentralized amateurism towards centralized professionalism." [...] However, Veale's successor Sir Folliott Sandford was [...] "appalled at the amount of paper", which was [...] "quite beyond [...] conception as a civil servant." [...] The growth in Oxford's administration led to a move in 1968 to purpose-built accommodation in Wellington Square: until that time, the administration had been housed in the Clarendon Building in the centre of Oxford next to the Bodleian Library. , there are 16 administrative sections for the university, and the heads of 12 of these report to the Registrar. In 2006, about 4,000 of the university's staff of approximately 8,000 were reported as being under the Registrar's control.|$|E
