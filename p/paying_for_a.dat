Faced {{with the prospect of}} <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> paramilitary force which could only sit on its hands, the owners agreed to disband it. The deputies, which Gen. Brooks had dispatched via rail to Colorado Springs, began dispersing on June 11. The Waite agreement became operative the same day, and the miners returned to work.|$|E
5|$|It is {{announced}} {{that there will}} be an Itchy & Scratchy Movie and in anticipation, Bart buys himself a ticket. Later on, Bart is left to babysit Maggie and he neglects to watch her as he is distracted by the history of Itchy & Scratchy, leaving her to take Homer's car for a joyride and crash into the wall of Springfield Prison, releasing the prisoners. Therefore, Homer angrily blames Bart and punishes him by banning him from ever seeing The Itchy & Scratchy Movie. He tears up Bart's ticket to prove that he means business. Bart begs to be given another punishment, but Homer refuses. After the film's release, Bart becomes angry and sad that he is the only kid in Springfield who has not seen it. Two months later, the film is still being shown in theaters as Marge and Lisa beg Homer to change his mind, with Marge claiming Bart has been punished enough. However, Homer still denies this and makes the punishment stick. Bart attempts to secretly watch the film by <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> ticket, but learns that Homer went to the theater and instructed the employees to not sell tickets to him. Eventually, the film is removed from theaters and Bart tells Homer he won, to which Homer replies by saying they both won because by using his punishment Bart is in no doubt headed for a better life.|$|E

25|$|Record {{economic}} growth {{starting in the}} mid-1980s mostly erased the problem of finances preventing service. As a secondary measure, starting in 1990, <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> mission became easier on those called to work in industrialized nations. Missionaries began paying into a church-wide general missionary fund instead of paying on their own. This amount paid (about $425 per month currently) {{is used by the}} church to pay for the costs of all missionaries, wherever they go. This enabled those going to Bolivia, whose average cost of living is about $100 per month, to help pay for those going to Japan, whose cost tops out at around $900 per month.|$|E
25|$|Most service {{stations}} allow the customer to pump the fuel before paying; {{this is particularly}} {{the case in the}} smaller towns and cities in New Zealand. In recent years some {{service stations}} have required customers to purchase their fuel first. It is quite common for customers to hand the cash to the attendant on the forecourt if they are <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> set amount of fuel and have no change. Some supermarkets have their own forecourts which are unmanned and payment is pay at the pump only. Customers at the supermarket will receive a discount voucher which offers discounted fuel at their forecourt. The amount of discount varies depending on the amount spent on groceries at the supermarket, but normally starts at 4 cents a liter.|$|E
25|$|In the {{era when}} long {{distance}} trips took several days, sleeping accommodations were {{an essential part}} of transportation. (On land, the lodging involved was often part of the infrastructure: the inn or ryokan, which did not move, sheltered travellers. People also slept on ships at sea.) Today, most airlines, inter-city trains and coaches offer reclining seats and many provide pillows and blankets for overnight travellers. Better sleeping arrangements are commonly offered for a premium fare and include sleeping cars on overnight trains, larger private cabins on ships and aircraft seats that convert into beds. Budget-conscious tourists sometimes plan their trips using overnight train or bus journeys in lieu of <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> hotel.

40|$|Abstract: This survey {{investigated}} {{the willingness to}} <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> improved water quality and reliability in Chobe ward in Maun. On average, 54 % of the households are willing to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> improved water quality. It is therefore apparent that Chobe Ward, Maun residents in general regard water as an economic good as {{they are willing to}} <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> its provision. Those with a higher income were willing to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> improved water quality and reliability of supply. This finding corroborates the environmental economic theory which assumes that the demand <b>for</b> <b>an</b> improved environmental quality increases with income. The older the person the more they are willing to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> improved water quality and reliability. Larger families are not willing to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> <b>an</b> improved provision of water services. Also, educated people are lesser willing to <b>pay</b> <b>for</b> improved water quality and reliability...|$|R

Initially <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> Chapel of Ease for the three local parishes of East Grinstead, Forest Row and Hartfield, in 1873, he provided for a village school for 100 children; in 1875 for the Vicarage; in 1880 for St Stephen's Church, Hammerwood (to the design of E. P. Loftus Brock) {{at the cost of}} £7,431, the first vicar being Rev. Clement Colby Woodland of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge; in 1892 for the rebuilding of St Peter's Church, Holtye in memory of his late wife (Rose Sophia Vansittart, 1832–1892); in 1893 for the rebuilding of the Countess of Thanet's Almshouses on Holtye Common, {{and at the end of}} the 19th century for a new building for the Queen Victoria Hospital in East Grinstead. Additionally, much of the village of Hammerwood which exists today (the population of which reached a peak of 438 in 1891), and some of the houses to the east of the village of Ashurst Wood, were built during Smith's tenure as tied cottages for estate workers.|$|E

500|$|On 16 March 1756, Johnson {{was arrested}} for an {{outstanding}} debt of £5 18s. Unable to contact anyone else, he wrote to the writer and publisher Samuel Richardson. Richardson, who had previously lent Johnson money, sent him six guineas to show his good will, and the two became friends. Soon after, Johnson met and befriended the painter Joshua Reynolds, who so impressed Johnson that he declared him [...] "almost the only man whom I call a friend". Reynolds' younger sister Frances observed during their time together [...] "that men, women and children gathered around him [...] ", laughing at his gestures and gesticulations. In addition to Reynolds, Johnson was close to Bennet Langton and Arthur Murphy. Langton was a scholar and an admirer of Johnson who persuaded his way into a meeting with Johnson {{which led to a}} long friendship. Johnson met Murphy during the summer of 1754 after Murphy came to Johnson about the accidental republishing of the Rambler No. 190, and the two became friends. Around this time, Anna Williams began boarding with Johnson. She was a minor poet who was poor and becoming blind, two conditions that Johnson attempted to change by providing room for her and <b>paying</b> <b>for</b> <b>a</b> failed cataract surgery. Williams, in turn, became Johnson's housekeeper.|$|E
