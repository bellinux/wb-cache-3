5|$|Although {{she was a}} <b>previously</b> <b>published</b> {{novelist and}} had a {{successful}} Broadway play, Rand had difficulty finding a publisher for The Fountainhead.

When Rand was only a quarter done with the manuscript by October 1940, Knopf canceled her contract. Several other publishers rejected the book.
