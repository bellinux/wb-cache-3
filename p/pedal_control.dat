25|$|Metheny {{then again}} delved into adventurous solo and band projects, {{and four years}} went by before {{the release of the}} next record for the next Pat Metheny Group. This was a live set {{recorded}} in Europe entitled The Road to You, and it featured tracks from the two Geffen studio albums alongside new tunes. By this stage, the group had integrated new instrumentation and technologies into its sound, including Mays' addition of midi-controlled synthesized sounds to acoustic piano solos, accomplished via a <b>pedal</b> <b>control.</b>|$|E

50|$|A pair of Autoloc levers {{move over}} the top of the {{steering}} wheel. They operate the throttle and ignition. A <b>pedal</b> <b>controls</b> the engine braking system. Road tests as late as 1911 noted how Rover cars lacked accelerator pedals.|$|R
50|$|The Dolce Campana pedal pianoforte c. 1850, {{built by}} Boardman and Gray, New York, {{demonstrated}} yet another creative way of modifying the piano's sound. A <b>pedal</b> <b>controlled</b> {{a series of}} hammers or weights attached to the soundboard that would fall onto {{an equal number of}} screws, and created the sound of bells or the harp.|$|R
50|$|Another system, {{known as}} VACMA, oversees the driver's alertness. It {{consists}} of a foot <b>pedal</b> <b>control</b> that the driver needs to hold down for the TGV to move. This pedal must be released then re-pressed once every 60 seconds if no other activity takes place. There is one period of time before a buzzer sounds, and another period {{of time before the}} automatic emergency brakes come on. The control can be released for {{a very short period of}} time before a buzzer sounds, and another very short period of time before the automatic emergency brakes come on.|$|E
50|$|The KT4 was {{originally}} designed to demands set out by {{the needs of the}} GDR, who found bogie cars too expensive and needed a solution to their aging fleet of two-axle vehicles. The first steps into the KT4s design were made when ČKD Tatra modified a six-axle K2 tramcar, to a four-axle suspended articulation formation which later presented itself in the KT4. The KT4 has identical <b>pedal</b> <b>control</b> systems and bogies to the Tatra T3 bogie tramcar. As production continued, the design was improved, noted particularly in 1983 with the addition of thyristor control type TV3. The type is called KT4t.|$|E
50|$|A {{gasoline}} engine is fed by either a carburetor with a butterfly valve or an air receiver with a throttle valve and fuel injectors. In {{both cases the}} operated valves (in case of car - the gas <b>pedal),</b> <b>control</b> the volume of air-fuel mixture taken into the engine and control engine speed. Finally the combustion cycle requires an ignition system in form of an electric spark, that is circuited to a switch (in case of car - the ignition key). Thus in the rare case of throttle linkage rupture, {{it is very easy}} to bring a runaway petrol engine to a stop by switching off the ignition.|$|E
5000|$|During Wong’s live performances, {{he creates}} {{intricate}} pieces based on cyclical guitar loops. His live setup {{is built around}} a loop pedal, combined with octave and distortion pedals to change the textures and colors of the guitar, plus a delay pedal to determine the tempo and pattern. [...] He manipulates the <b>pedal</b> <b>controls</b> while performing.|$|R
50|$|Later {{cars from}} about 1939 had a larger 250 cc engine, a three speed gearbox and normal <b>pedal</b> <b>controls.</b> Top speed was 40 mph (65 km/h). Two seats were now fitted along with {{electric}} lights. A commercial version, the Scootatruck was also made and for publicity some were styled {{to look like}} Vauxhall and Chrysler models.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: In the Ford Model T, the <b>pedals</b> <b>control</b> the two forward gears (left pedal), reverse (center pedal), and {{the brake}} (right pedal). The steering-column levers control {{ignition}} timing (left) and the throttle (right). The large hand-levers set the rear-wheel parking brake {{and put the}} transmission in neutral (left) and control an after-market 2-speed transmission adapter (right).|$|R
50|$|A racing {{wheel is}} a method of control for use in racing video games, racing simulators, and driving simulators. They are usually {{packaged}} with a large paddle styled as a steering wheel, along {{with a set of}} pedals for gas, brake, and sometimes clutch actuation, as well as various shifter controls. An analog wheel and pedal set such as this allows the user to accurately manipulate steering angle and <b>pedal</b> <b>control</b> that is required to properly manage a simulated car, as opposed to digital control such as a keyboard. The relatively large range of motion further allows the user to more accurately apply the controls. Racing wheels have been developed for use with arcade games, game consoles, personal computers, and also for professional driving simulators for race drivers.|$|E
5000|$|For live {{performances}} - since {{the departure of}} synthesizer player & vocalist Alex Pennie in 2007, Frost inherited performance duties of the Alesis Micron - which during the recording and performance of debut album Not Accepted Anywhere was one of 3 synthesizer keyboards used, later on This Is a Fix it was also used {{as well as the}} Paul Mullen controlled microKORG. The sounds created on the Alesis Andromeda and Roland Juno-106 for Not Accepted Anywhere since Pennies departure are recreated live on the microKORG and Alesis Micron, to control some tracks whilst playing guitar, Frost uses a Boss RC-50 Loop Station, which enables partial foot <b>pedal</b> <b>control</b> of the sounds available on the Alesis Micron. Frost uses band-mate Rob Hawkins Fender USA Jazz Bass live when performing [...] "High Time".|$|E
50|$|Many popular {{electric}} guitar effects, such as wah, vibrato and swell, use a variable <b>pedal</b> <b>control</b> {{similar to a}} keyboard expression pedal. Historically, these have been built into dedicated pedals for each effect, but modern digital amplifiers and processors allow many different effects to be built into a single, small floor or rack mount unit. Special built-in or plug-in expression pedals {{can be used with}} these devices to allow control of multiple effects with a single expression pedal. Using the expression pedal, the musician can not only emulate dedicated effects such as wah, but also have real time control of almost any variable such as volume, tone, echo repeats, effect speed, and so on. Some guitar expression pedals include integrated toe switches similar to those for some electric organs. The switches provide even more control, allowing the musician to turn effects on and off, and switch between different amplifiers.|$|E
5000|$|Woods {{was asked}} to {{replicate}} the position she took to cause that accident. Seated at a desk, she reached far back over her left shoulder for a telephone as her foot applied pressure to the <b>pedal</b> <b>controlling</b> the transcription machine. Her posture during the demonstration, dubbed the [...] "Rose Mary Stretch", resulted in many political commentators questioning {{the validity of the}} explanation.|$|R

5000|$|Mustang Challenge: Speed Kills: In what isn't so much {{an actual}} {{challenge}} {{as a demonstration}} of the effect that even a small amount of excess speed can have, the drivers are each given the task of performing a mini Swerve-and-Avoid course in the Mustang (which has been successfully repaired after the damage Krystal caused in the previous episode), where they're asked to steer around a foam moose at 50 km/h, 60 km/h and 70 km/h. All of the drivers accomplish the task at 50 km/h, but only a couple of them do it at 60 km/h, and all of them hit the moose at 70 km/h. Krystal has difficulty performing the demonstration, driving at 70 km/h on her first run due to her poor <b>pedal</b> <b>control,</b> which requires Andrew to give her a lesson on how to properly use the accelerator. After this she manages to carry out the demonstration correctly, but still claims that it's okay to speed in certain situations, much to Andrew's annoyance. Meanwhile, Daniella is also given a lesson in highway driving by Tim on the Lincoln M. Alexander Parkway in an attempt to calm her nerves.|$|E
30|$|Motor {{skills in}} driving, such as <b>pedal</b> <b>control</b> and steel wheel control are {{psychomotor}} skills {{developed as a}} result of constant practice, so individuals need little thought to perform them but require input from both the physical and the mental attributes, and coordinate in order to achieve a certain goal. Age-related motor skill declines can be found as balance and gait deficits, coordination deficits, movement slowing [23], and alterations in cognitive-motor processes [23]. Motor execution of the older adults may require more psychomotor ability and rely on cognitive control [24].|$|E
40|$|Abstract: The design {{modification}} proposed is that {{of integrating}} acceleration and clutch mechanism under a single <b>pedal</b> <b>control.</b> By this modification the major out turn is that the vehicle accelerates as and when the Clutch Acceleration Pedal is released, instead of acceleration by pedal pressing {{as in the case}} of conventional cars. In this design the clutch mechanism is operated when the Clutch Acceleration pedal pressed to the maximum. At the end of pedal by having mechanical linkage, acceleration mechanism is neutralized and a further force extends the rod which operates the clutch. This way we bring two mechanisms under a single pedal...|$|E
50|$|The {{aircraft}} carriage {{is built}} from powder coated welded 6061-T6 aluminum tubing {{and is a}} highly simplified design compared to other powered parachutes. In flight steering is accomplished via foot pedals that actuate the canopy brakes, creating roll and yaw. On the ground the same foot <b>pedals</b> <b>control</b> the nosewheel steering. The main landing gear incorporates fiberglass spring rod suspension. Standard equipment factory provided included a large canopy-stowage bag, electric engine starting, flight instruments and a four-point pilot harness.|$|R
50|$|There are {{hardware}} and “at home” software {{versions of the}} samchillian. The hardware unit features indicator lights based on the last 3 digits in binary of the MIDI note number, a knob {{that serves as a}} pitch wheel, the ability to plug in an expression <b>pedal</b> (<b>controlling</b> parameters of vibrato, wah, etc.,) and an 8-bit 11 kHz sine wave to allow the instrument to be used in a standalone mode without the need for an external sound source to be triggered.|$|R
50|$|Although the oscillators, {{filters and}} {{amplifiers}} themselves are voltage controlled, the overall {{control of the}} synthesizer channels is entirely in software. The embedded computer generates thirty-two Attack Decay Release envelopes (two per channel, one with delay) and sixteen Low Frequency Oscillator sweep signals in software. Signals from the levers, <b>pedals,</b> <b>control</b> panel or the keyboard are all encoded digitally, processed by the computer, {{and sent to the}} synthesizer channels on the voice cards via several multiplexed analog control lines and a number of digital control registers.|$|R
40|$|In laparoscopic surgery, tiny incisions {{are made}} in the patient's body and a {{laparoscope}} (an optical tube with a camera at the end) is inserted. The camera's image is projected onto two video screens, whose views guide the surgeon through the procedure. AESOP, a medical robot developed by Computer Motion, Inc. with NASA assistance, eliminates the need for a human assistant to operate the camera. The surgeon uses a foot <b>pedal</b> <b>control</b> to move the device, allowing him to use both hands during the surgery. Miscommunication is avoided; AESOP's movement is smooth and steady, and the memory vision is invaluable. Operations can be completed more quickly, and the patient spends less time under anesthesia. AESOP has been approved by the FDA...|$|E
40|$|Numerous {{governmental}} {{studies have}} {{established that the}} primary cause of nearly all sudden acceleration incidents is pedal misapplication. Additional scientific work has further examined the role of <b>pedal</b> <b>control,</b> vehicle design, and other various human factors associated with incidents of this type. As an extension of previous research, we examined various factors that could contribute to these incidents using recent data from the North Carolina Accident Reporting System. While vehicle class was not predictive of a pedal error that led to a sudden acceleration event, the age of the driver was statistically related to the more significant pedal error types. Specifically, we found that over half of accidents involving older drivers occurred while parking and involved them completely missing the brake. Also, young and elderly women were over-represented for these miss-type pedal errors while parking. These data underscore the role of human factors in understanding causes and factors involved in pedal misapplications and sudden acceleration events...|$|E
40|$|Abstract- Unmanned Aerial Vehicle {{become popular}} and very useful today. Unmanned Aerial Vehicle types have fixed wing UAV and rotary wing UAV. Among rotary wing UAV, {{helicopter}} type is chosen {{to implement the}} mathematical model for UAH. Since these helicopter mathematical model is very complex and inflexible, simple model “minimum-complexity helicopter simulation math model ” (MCHSMM) is used to develop a non-linear mathematical model R- 50 helicopter for this work. This modeling consists of three blocks: (1) Rigid body dynamics, (2) Force and torque dynamics, and (3) Flapping and thrust dynamics. Each of these are implemented in MATALB SIMULINK. There are four control inputs: ulat (lateral control input), ulong (longitudinal control input), ucol (collective control input) and uped (<b>pedal</b> <b>control</b> input). By alternating positive, negative, and zero to four control inputs, the resultant responses of positions, Euler angles, translatory velocities, angular velocities and flapping angles are simulated. The stability analysis for UAH are also analyzed and simulation results provides the real world approaches for UAH system...|$|E
50|$|Rudder <b>pedals</b> <b>control</b> {{rotation}} of the plane about the yaw axis. There are two pedals that pivot so that when one is pressed forward the other moves backward, and vice versa. The pilot presses on the right rudder pedal to make the plane yaw to the right, and pushes on the left pedal to make it yaw to the left. The rudder is used mainly to balance the plane in turns, or to compensate for winds or other effects that tend to turn the plane about the yaw axis.|$|R
