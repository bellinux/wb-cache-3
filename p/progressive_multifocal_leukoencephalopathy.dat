Alemtuzumab, daclizumab and CD20 monoclonal antibodies such as rituximab, ocrelizumab and ofatumumab have all shown some benefit and are under study as potential treatments for MS. Nevertheless, their use has also been accompanied {{by the appearance of}} potentially dangerous adverse effects, most importantly opportunistic infections. Related to these investigations is the recent development of a test against JC virus antibodies which might help to predict what patients are at a greater risk of developing <b>progressive</b> <b>multifocal</b> <b>leukoencephalopathy</b> when taking natalizumab. While monoclonal antibodies are probably going to have some role in the treatment of the disease in the future, it is believed that it will be small due to the risks associated to them.|$|E
5|$|The disease-modifying {{treatments}} {{have several}} adverse effects. One {{of the most}} common is irritation at the injection site for glatiramer acetate and the interferons (up to 90% with subcutaneous injections and 33% with intramuscular injections). Over time, a visible dent at the injection site, due to the local destruction of fat tissue, known as lipoatrophy, may develop. Interferons may produce flu-like symptoms; some people taking glatiramer experience a post-injection reaction with flushing, chest tightness, heart palpitations, and anxiety, which usually lasts less than thirty minutes. More dangerous but much less common are liver damage from interferons, systolic dysfunction (12%), infertility, and acute myeloid leukemia (0.8%) from mitoxantrone, and <b>progressive</b> <b>multifocal</b> <b>leukoencephalopathy</b> occurring with natalizumab (occurring in 1 in 600 people treated).|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES—To {{evaluate}} {{the role of}} proton MR spectroscopy (1 H-MRS) in detecting metabolic changes in diffuse or focal lesions in the brain of patients infected with HIV.  METHODS—Sixty HIV seropositive patients (25 with HIV related encephalopathies, 20 with toxoplasmosis, eight with <b>progressive</b> <b>multifocal</b> <b>leukoencephalopathies</b> (PMLs), and seven with lymphomas) and 22 HIV seronegative neurological controls were examined with a combined MRI and 1 H-MRS technique using a Siemens 1. 5 Tesla Magnetom. Spectra (Spin Echo sequence, TE 135 ms) were acquired by single voxel, localised on focal lesions in toxoplasmosis, PML, lymphomas, and HIV encephalopathies and on the centrum semiovale of neurological controls. Choline (Cho), creatine (Cr), N-acetyl aspartate (NAA), lactate, and lipids were evaluated in each spectrum and NAA/Cr, NAA/Cho, and Cho/Cr ratios were calculated.  RESULTS—A significant decrease in NAA/Cr and NAA/Cho ratios were found in all HIV diagnostic groups in comparison with neurological controls (p< 0. 003), suggesting neuronal or axonal damage independent of brain lesion aetiology. However, the NAA/Cr ratio was significantly lower in PML and lymphomas than in HIV encephalopathies (p< 0. 02) and toxoplasmosis (p< 0. 05). HIV encephalopathies, lymphomas, and toxoplasmosis showed {{a significant increase in}} the Cho/Cr ratio in comparison with neurological controls (p< 0. 03) without between group differences. The presence of a lipid signal was more frequent in lymphomas (71 %) than in other HIV groups (Fisher's test, p= 0. 00003). The presence of mobile lipid resonance together with a high Cho/Cr ratio in lymphomas may be related to an increased membrane synthesis and turnover in tumour cells. A lactate signal (marker of inflammatory reaction), was found in all but one patient with PML lesions (75 %), but had a lower incidence in the other HIV diagnostic groups (Fisher's test, p= 0. 00024).  CONCLUSION— 1 H-MRS shows a high sensitivity in detecting brain involvement in HIV related diseases, but a poor specificity in differential diagnosis of HIV brain lesions. Nevertheless, the homogeneous metabolic pattern that characterises PML suggests the usefulness of 1 H-MRS as an adjunct to MRI in differentiating CNS white matter lesions, such as HIV encephalopathies, from PML. ...|$|R

30|$|Nowadays, {{although}} there are already several kinds of solid <b>progressive</b> <b>multifocal</b> lens or <b>progressive</b> addition lens in the market, the method to realize <b>progressive</b> <b>multifocal</b> adjustment mechanism is still under research. <b>Progressive</b> <b>multifocal</b> lens can distributes {{the power of the}} three important zones namely far view zone, near view zone and intermediate zone progressively and smoothly [1].

Moreover, a multioptical-axis mathematical model based on the human eye in the different observation orientations was developed to design the freeform <b>progressive</b> <b>multifocal</b> lens through theoretical and experimental investigations [5].|$|R

PML is an opportunistic infection with neurological progressive symptoms caused by the replication of the JC virus in the glial cells of the brain. All 3 initial cases were taking natalizumab in combination with interferon beta-1a. After a safety review the drug was returned to the market in 2006 as a monotherapy for MS under a special prescription program.

While none of them had taken the drug in combination with other disease-modifying treatments, previous use of MS treatments increases the risk of PML between 3 and 4-fold. The estimated prevalence of PML is 1.5 cases per thousand natalizumab users. Around 20% of MS patients with PML die, while most of the remaining are importantly disabled.|$|E

Zamora visited his family in Miami before {{returning}} to San Francisco to live with Sasser. On a speaking tour, he complained of constant headaches. When Winick, Zamora, Murphy, and Ling met again that August for a reunion party, Zamora's health and appearance had worsened and, having previously been talkative, he was often silent for long periods, finding it difficult to follow conversations or remember locations of places he had known for years. When Zamora was in New York for an ultimately canceled interview with CBS's CBS This Morning, his contacts at MTV convinced him to see a doctor, but {{when he arrived at the}} MTV offices, he did not know where he was. On August 17, Zamora checked into St. Vincent's Hospital and was diagnosed with toxoplasmosis, a condition which causes brain lesions, fatigue, headaches and confusion. While medication alleviated the toxoplasmosis, further tests, including a biopsy, revealed he had <b>progressive</b> <b>multifocal</b> <b>leukoencephalopathy</b> (PML), a rare and usually fatal viral inflammation of the brain that breaks down the electrical impulses of the nervous system. More serious symptoms of the illness can include paralysis or aphasia. Although only 1% of AIDS patients contract PML, it usually dissipates on its own in patients with T-cell counts higher than 300-400. At the time, Zamora's T-cell count was 32. The inflammation was attacking the frontal lobe of his brain, causing him short-term memory loss. Zamora was given three to four months to live.|$|E

40|$|Luca Prosperini, Simona Pontecorvo Department of Neurology and Psychiatry, Sapienza University, Rome, Italy Abstract: Delayed-release {{dimethyl}} fumarate (DMF), {{also known}} as gastroresistant DMF, is the most recently approved oral disease-modifying treatment (DMT) for relapsing multiple sclerosis. Two randomized clinical trials (Determination of the Efficacy and Safety of Oral Fumarate in Relapsing–Remitting MS [DEFINE] and Comparator and an Oral Fumarate in Relapsing-Remitting Multiple Sclerosis [CONFIRM]) demonstrated significant efficacy in reducing relapse rate and radiological signs of disease activity, as seen on magnetic resonance imaging. The DEFINE study also indicated a significant effect of DMF on disability worsening, while the low incidence of confirmed disability worsening in the CONFIRM trial rendered an insignificant reduction among the DMF-treated groups when compared to placebo. DMF also demonstrated a good safety profile and acceptable tolerability, since the most common side effects (gastrointestinal events and flushing reactions) are usually transient and mild to moderate in severity. Here, we discuss the place in therapy of DMF for individuals with relapsing multiple sclerosis, providing a tentative therapeutic algorithm to manage newly diagnosed patients {{and those who do}} not adequately respond to self-injectable DMTs. Literature data supporting the potential role of DMF as a first-line therapy are presented. The possibility of using DMF as switching treatment or even as an add-on strategy in patients with breakthrough disease despite self-injectable DMTs will also be discussed. Lastly, we argue about the role of DMF as an exit strategy from natalizumab-treated patients who are considered at risk for developing <b>multifocal</b> <b>progressive</b> <b>leukoencephalopathy.</b> Keywords: multiple sclerosis, dimethyl fumarate, oral drugs, therapeutic algorithm ...|$|R
