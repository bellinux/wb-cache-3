25|$|Theologians and {{philosophers}} have attributed to God such characteristics as omniscience, omnipotence, omnipresence, perfect goodness, divine simplicity, and eternal and necessary existence. God {{has been described}} as incorporeal, a <b>personal</b> <b>being,</b> the source of all moral obligation, and the greatest conceivable being existent. These attributes were all claimed to varying degrees by the early Jewish, Christian and Muslim scholars, including Maimonides, St Augustine, and Al-Ghazali.|$|E
25|$|Craig {{examines}} arguments {{aimed at}} showing either that God is timeless or omnitemporal. He defends the coherence of a timeless and <b>personal</b> <b>being,</b> but {{says that the}} arguments for divine timelessness are unsound or inconclusive. By contrast, he gives two {{arguments in favor of}} divine temporality. First, he says that if a temporal world exists, then in virtue of his real relations to that world, God cannot remain untouched by its temporality. Craig says that given God's changing relations with the world he must change at least extrinsically, which is sufficient for his existing temporally. Second, Craig says that if a temporal world exists, then in virtue of his omniscience, God must know tensed facts about the world, such as what is happening now, which Craig argues is sufficient for his being temporally located. Craig argues that, since a temporal world does exist, it follows that God exists in time.|$|E
25|$|According to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, Spinoza's God is an “infinite intellect” (Ethics 2p11c) — all knowing (2p3), {{and capable}} of loving both himself—and us, insofar as {{we are part of}} his {{perfection}} (5p35c). And if the mark of a <b>personal</b> <b>being</b> is that it is one towards which we can entertain personal attitudes, then we should note too that Spinoza recommends amor intellectualis dei (the intellectual love of God) as the supreme good for man (5p33). However, the matter is complex. Spinoza's God does not have free will (1p32c1), he does not have purposes or intentions (1 appendix), and Spinoza insists that “neither intellect nor will pertain to the nature of God” (1p17s1). Moreover, while we may love God, we need to remember that God is really not the kind of being who could ever love us back. “He who loves God cannot strive that God should love him in return,” says Spinoza (5p19).|$|E

25|$|These {{principles}} of reason, cause and substance, given thus psychologically, {{enable us to}} pass {{beyond the limits of}} the relative and subjective to objective and absolute reality, they enable us, in a word, to pass from psychology, or the science of knowledge, to ontology or the science of being. These laws are inextricably mixed in consciousness with the data of volition and sensation, with free activity and fatal action or impression, and they guide us in rising to a <b>personal</b> <b>being,</b> a self or free cause, and to an impersonal reality, a not-me—nature, the world of force—lying out of us, and modifying us. As I refer to myself the act of attention and volition, so I cannot but refer the sensation to some cause, necessarily other than myself, that is, to an external cause, whose existence is as certain for me as my own existence, since the phenomenon which suggests it to me is as certain as the phenomenon which had suggested my reality, and both are given in each other. I thus reach an objective impersonal world of forces which corresponds to the variety of my sensations. The relation of these forces or causes to each other is the order of the universe.|$|E

2500|$|Hermann Cohen {{rejected}} Spinoza's {{idea that}} God {{can be found}} in nature, but agreed that God was not a <b>personal</b> <b>being.</b> Rather, he saw God as an ideal, an archetype of morality. Not only can God not be identified with nature, but God is also incomparable to anything in the world. This is because God is “One,” unique and unlike anything else. One loves and worships God through living ethically and obeying His moral law: “love of God is love of morality.” ...|$|E
2500|$|According to the Frankforts, [...] "ancient Egyptians and Mesopotamians"—the Frankforts' area of expertise—"lived in {{a wholly}} mythopoeic world".

[...] This immanence and {{multiplicity}} {{of the divine}} {{is a direct result}} of mythopoeic thought: hence, the first step in the loss of mythopoeic thought was the loss of this view of the divine. The ancient Hebrews took this first step through their doctrine of a single, transcendent God: ...|$|E

2500|$|In modern Western societies, the {{concepts}} of God typically entail a monotheistic, supreme, ultimate, and <b>personal</b> <b>being,</b> as found in the Islamic, Christian and Jewish traditions. In monotheistic religions outside the Abrahamic traditions, the existence of God is discussed in similar terms. In these traditions, God is also identified as the author (either directly or by inspiration) of certain texts, or that certain texts describe specific historical events caused by or communications from (whether in direct speech or dreams or omens) the God in question. [...] Some traditions also believe that God is the entity which is currently answering prayers for intervention or information or opinions.|$|E
2500|$|Mythopoeic {{thought is}} a {{hypothetical}} stage of human thought preceding modern thought, proposed by Henri Frankfort {{and his wife}} Henriette Antonia Frankfort in the 1940s. According to this proposal, there was a [...] "mythopoeic" [...] stage, in which humanity did not {{think in terms of}} generalizations and impersonal laws: instead, humans saw each event as an act of will {{on the part of some}} <b>personal</b> <b>being.</b> This way of thinking supposedly explains the ancients' tendency to create myths, which portray events as acts of gods and spirits. A physiological motivation for this was suggested by Julian Jaynes in 1976 in the form of bicameralism.|$|E
2500|$|Ethan Kleinberg writes that, {{more than}} Husserl, it was Martin Heidegger who appealed to Sartre's sense of radical individualism. He says, [...] "for Sartre, the {{question}} of being was always and only a question of <b>personal</b> <b>being.</b> The dilemma of the individual confronting the overwhelming problem of understanding the relationship of consciousness to things, of being to things, is the central focus" [...] of Nausea. Eventually, [...] "in his reworking of Husserl, Sartre found himself {{coming back to the}} themes he had absorbed from Heidegger's Was ist Metaphysik?" [...] Nausea was a prelude to Sartre's sustained attempt to follow Heidegger's Sein und Zeit by analyzing human experience as various ontological modes, or ways of being in the world.|$|E

2500|$|Though {{the primary}} {{location}} is an abbey, and a church of St. Ninian's makes appearances, {{there has been}} only little mention of a creator or godlike deity. This occurs throughout the series, {{such as in the}} book Redwall where Basil Stag Hare comments saying, [...] "Good Lord," [...] once throughout the story. In The Legend of Luke, it is said that [...] "St. Ninian's" [...] is a misnomer from a sign that originally read [...] "This ain't Ninian's!," [...] after a mouse named Ninian refused to help his wife build a house; some of the lettering later wore off, leaving ironically the words [...] "s ain't Ninian's", although the church is mentioned as having a lady chapel. There is occasional reference to a 'Spirit of the Seasons', but whether this is a <b>personal</b> <b>being</b> or an abstract poetic device is not elaborated. [...] However, there have been at least three mentions of the devil, Hell and other demons. Cluny the Scourge, after sending one of his minions to death, roars [...] "Tell the devil Cluny sent you!"
