25|$|<b>Photosensitive</b> <b>glass</b> is a {{clear glass}} in which {{microscopic}} metallic particles can be formed into a picture or image by exposure to short wave radiations such as ultraviolet light. <b>Photosensitive</b> <b>glass</b> was invented in November 1937 by S. Donald Stookey of Corning Glass Works.|$|E
5000|$|The {{photograph}} is developed by heating the <b>photosensitive</b> <b>glass</b> around 1000 °F {{for several hours}} after exposure. The glass itself is photosensitive and produces a three-dimensional image. Particles that are invisible {{to the naked eye}} (i.e. gold or silver) are in the glass. These microscopic particles move and grow when heated to form the photographic image itself. The process is similar to camera film, however a [...] "negative" [...] is placed on top of the <b>photosensitive</b> <b>glass</b> and then exposed to ‘’’ultraviolet’’’ light. Camera film, of course, would be exposed to ordinary visible light. Then there is a special process for the exposed <b>photosensitive</b> <b>glass.</b> The glass is reheated then in a kiln and postbaked for several hours. The image then [...] "appears" [...] within the special exposed glass as if by magic. The heated piece of <b>photosensitive</b> <b>glass</b> is then allowed to cool down and the process is done. The positive images produced within <b>photosensitive</b> <b>glass</b> comes in a variety of colors.|$|E
50|$|<b>Photosensitive</b> <b>glass</b> {{is used in}} {{printing}} and reproducing processes. <b>Photosensitive</b> <b>glass</b> is like traditional camera film except that it reacts to ultraviolet (UV) light, where camera film responds to visible light. The ideal wavelength to use for exposure should be between 300 and 350 nm, with 320 nm being optimum.|$|E

The purpose of this work is to prepare gels and silica glasses from alkoxides with small additions of silver and to study its incorporation in the structure and the changes which take place during the thermal densifying treatment, {{as a starting point}} for the later development of photochromic glasses and non-linear optical materials...|$|R

5000|$|As {{stated above}} {{radiation}} produces some {{direct and indirect}} measurable changes in the glasses. In some cases, the effect is readily observable immediately upon irradiation. In other cases, thermal treatment is required {{to bring about the}} observed changes. On the whole, the result of the mentioned reactions will be atomic silvers and/or silver clusters which act as nucleant for precipitation of lithium-meta-silicate during post heat-treatment of irradiated glass and Similar to other glass-ceramic systems, the more nucleation sites leads to more reduction of crystallization temperature and finer crystalline size. Therefore, to attain the above-mentioned condition, various energetic radiation such as UVand laser beam and x γ and proton and radiations have been used for different <b>photosensitive</b> <b>glasses</b> until now.Imanieh et al. [...] investigated the effect of X-ray irradiation on solarization of photosensitive lithium silicate based glasses containing cerium, antimony, tin and silver elements. They have shown that there is a possibility to use X-ray in <b>photosensitive</b> <b>glasses.</b> This will open new doors for nano machining of glasses in near future.|$|R

To simplify waveguide fabrication, ion-exchange techniques {{appear to be}} an important option in <b>photosensitive</b> <b>glasses.</b> Optimum OADM performance depends on how accurately the waveguide fabrication process and tilted Bragg grating operation are understood and modeled. Results from fabrication and comprehensive modeling are compared for ion-exchange processes that use different angles of the tilted grating. The transmission and reflection spectra for the fabricated and simulated OADMs show excellent agreement. The OADM’s performance is evaluated in terms of the measured characteristics of the Y branches and tilted gratings...|$|R

50|$|Since {{the image}} is inside and {{actually}} {{a part of the}} glass itself, <b>photosensitive</b> <b>glass</b> is the most durable photographic medium known. It is claimed that a photo image within <b>photosensitive</b> <b>glass</b> is the most durable form of photography and will last as long as the glass itself. The photographic image is not {{on the surface of the}} glass, but internally.|$|E
5000|$|One of {{the reasons}} for the delay between the {{invention}} of <b>photosensitive</b> <b>glass</b> and its public announcement approximately ten years later was its potential use in military applications. It is possible to burn images and words that are hidden in <b>photosensitive</b> <b>glass</b> until heated at a high temperature. [...] The [...] military used this fact during World War II to send secret messages to allied troops in pieces of what looked like [...] "ordinary glass." [...] At the other hand, the person who received the [...] "ordinary glass" [...] just had to heat it up to read the hidden message. Because of this application <b>photosensitive</b> <b>glass</b> was kept secret until the end of World War II.|$|E

40|$|Direct UV {{writing is}} a dynamic planar {{lightwave}} circuit fabrication technique offering great potential {{as a means of}} rapid prototyping and small/medium batch fabrication. The technique is based on the refractive index increase of <b>photosensitive</b> <b>glasses</b> through exposure to ultraviolet light. In this case, a beam is tightly focused to create a writing spot in the order of microns and is translated relative to the sample. It is this translation over a 2 -d plane that defines the channel waveguide structures; {{there is no need for}} a photolithographic mask or subsequent processing.

The method allows {{to transform the}} periodic multidimensional interference patterns into periodic modulation of dielectric properties of the material, and is therefore potentially suitable for the photonic crystal fabrication in materials like photoresists, <b>photosensitive</b> <b>glasses,</b> and others. We have fabricated one, two, and three-dimensional photonic crystals with different lattices and sub-micrometer periods. The fabricated structures have high structural quality, as evidenced by confocal and scanning electron microscopies.

It is observed that three distinct morphologies of lines are produced depending on the scanning velocity. Lines written in low velocity level (40 − 100 µm/s) and high velocity level (1000 − 1800 µm/s) are uniform and regular, while those written in moderate velocity level (150 − 600 µm/s) are rough. The influence of scanning velocity is explained based on different pulses overlapping or cumulative dose of laser exposure in irradiated area.

40|$|International audienceVarious photo-induced silver {{luminescent}} centres {{were obtained}} in photosensitive zinc and phosphate glasses containing silver ions after exposure to gamma or ultraviolet nanosecond pulsed-laser radiation.

For the highest irradiation doses silver clusters are obtained. Under ultraviolet nanosecond pulsed-laser exposure similar species are generated along the beam propagation direction as proven by the analogous optical and luminescence signatures. In this case for high irradiation doses few silver clusters are created. The evolution of the luminescence spectra {{with respect to the}} temperature and to the duration of the heat treatment after ultraviolet nanosecond pulsed-laser irradiation evidences the presence of potential barriers determining the stability limits of some species such as the Ag 2 + hole-trapped centres or the Agmx+ clusters composed of silver ions and silver atoms.

40|$|The optical {{performance}} of refractive index structures induced in <b>photosensitive</b> (PS) <b>glasses</b> ultimately {{depends on the}} index modulation depth attainable. In germanosilicate materials, the photosensitive response {{is linked to the}} presence of oxygen-deficient germanium point defect centers. Prior efforts to increase PS in these materials, e. g., hydrogen loading, rely on a chemical reduction of the glass structure to enhance the population of oxygen deficient centers and thus increase the saturated refractive index change. We have previously reported the development of highly <b>photosensitive,</b> as-deposited germanosilicate <b>glass</b> films through reactive atmosphere (O{sub 2 }/Ar) sputtering from a Ge/Si alloy target. The present work details our investigation of the effect of substrate temperature during deposition on the material structure and propensity for photosensitivity. Using optical absorption/bleaching, Raman, electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) and selective charge injection techniques we show that the predominate defect states responsible for the PS response can be varied through substrate temperature control. We find that two regimes of photosensitive behavior can be accessed which exhibit dramatically different uv-bleaching characteristics. Thus, the corresponding dispersion of the refractive index change as well as its magnitude can be controlled using our synthesis technique.
