The 2016 annual NFL poll found significant difference of opinion based upon age and race. Older respondents are opposed to a name change, but those between 18 and 29 are strongly (70%) in favor of a change. While 77% of all white fans believe the name should not be changed, only 38% of African-American and 33% of Latino fans agree, which is a change since the 2014 poll in which there was little difference between white and non-white opinion.|$|E

40|$|Background: Surgeons are at {{risk for}} {{developing}} work-related musculoskeletal symptoms (WMS). The present study aims to examine the physical factors and their association with WMS among pediatric laparoscopic surgeons. Methods: A questionnaire consisting of 21 questions was created and mailed to 25 pediatric laparoscopic surgeons (LG). 23 / 25 surgeons (92 %) completed the survey. The questionnaire was analyzed and then split into 2 groups. Group 1 (LG 1) included surgeons with greater laparoscopic experience, and group 2 (LG 2) included surgeons with less important laparoscopic experience. In addition, we constructed and sent to the same surgeons a similar questionnaire focused on WMS after an open procedure (OG) with the aim to compare results of LG with OG. Results: The prevalence rate of WMS with shoulder symptoms was 78. 2 % in surgeons that performed laparoscopy for more than 10 years, with 60. 8 % also reporting other pain. In 66. 6 % this pain is evident only after a long-lasting procedure. Forty-four percent of these surgeons require painkillers at least twice a week. Fifty percent of these surgeons also suffer at home. Fifty-five and one half percent of surgeons indicate that this pain is related to their laparoscopic activity. Forty-three and a half <b>percent</b> <b>think</b> that laparoscopy is beneficial only for the patient but has a bad ergonomic effect for surgeons. Sixty-five and two-tenths <b>percent</b> <b>think</b> that robotic surgery can be helpful to improve ergonomics. Comparing the groups, WMS occur more frequently in LG (78. 2 %) than in OG (56. 5 %), but this difference was not statistically significant (χ 2 = 0. 05). In addition, WMS occur more frequently in LG 1 (84. 6 %) than in LG 2 (70 %), but this difference was not statistically significant (χ 2 = 0. 05). Conclusions: These results confirmed a strong association between WMS and the number of laparoscopic procedures performed. Skilled laparoscopic surgeons have more pain than less skilled laparoscopic surgeons. WMS in the same group of surgeons are more frequent after laparoscopy than after open procedures. The majority of surgeons refer to shoulder symptoms...|$|E
