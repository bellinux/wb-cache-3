While inspecting the Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, the Queen, the Duke of Edinburgh and President Nkrumah <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> bed. Since he {{had a picture of}} his parents displayed on his bedside table, the Duke of Edinburgh, who had visited Kumasi previously and had met Peggy Appiah, turned back, as he was leaving, to send his regards. President Nkrumah's reported anger at being embarrassed in this way -this was the husband of a foreign head of state sending a greeting to the wife of a man Nkrumah had in political detention â€“ was reportedly {{one of the reasons that}} Kwame Appiah's doctor was deported.|$|R

60|$|What Mr. Elton {{had learned}} from the ostler on the subject, being the {{accumulation}} of the ostler's own knowledge, and {{the knowledge of the}} servants at Randalls, was, that a messenger had come over from Richmond soon after the return of the party from Box Hill--which messenger, however, had been no more than was expected; and that Mr. Churchill had sent his nephew a few lines, containing, upon the whole, a tolerable account of Mrs. Churchill, and only wishing him not to delay coming back beyond the next morning early; but that Mr. Frank Churchill having resolved to go home directly, without waiting at all, and his horse seeming to have got a cold, Tom had been sent off immediately for the Crown chaise, and the ostler had stood out and seen it <b>pass</b> <b>by,</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> going a good pace, and driving very steady.|$|R
50|$|In Zambia the Luvale people {{hold the}} 'Makishi festival' {{to mark the}} end of the 'kumukanda' (or 'initiation'). Every 5 years or so, <b>boys</b> from <b>the</b> same age group (young teenagers) are taken into the bush for 1-2 months where they undergo several rites of passage into manhood. These involve {{learning}} certain survival skills, learning about women and how to be a good husband, learning about fatherhood, and also they are circumcised. The Luvale consider uncircumcised men to be dirty or unhygienic. It is said that in some very rural areas where the kumukanda is maintained in its strictest traditional sense that if a woman is to <b>pass</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> <b>boy's</b> 'bushcamp' whilst they are undergoing kumukanda then she must be punished.To celebrate the boys' completion of the kumukanda the Makishi festival welcomes them back to the village as men. The masks represent specific characters: Pwebo (a female character... 'pwebo' meaning 'woman' in Luvale) and Chizaluke amongst others.|$|R

60|$|The convoy had now {{reached the}} village, and a halt was ordered, and <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> alighting, walked forward {{to see that}} their unwelcome attendants quitted them.

6000|$|That black kitten, or Chet, as it {{was usually}} styled, was {{accustomed}} to be strangled {{the greater part of}} <b>the</b> morning <b>by</b> <b>the</b> baby.

A bad memory seemed to be that kitten's chief blessing. A horror of any kind was no sooner past than it was straightway forgotten, and the facetious animal would advance with arched back and glaring eyes in defiance of an incursive hen, or twirl in mad hopeless career after its own miserable tail! ...|$|R
6000|$|GREAT-HEART. It is the King's {{highway that}} we are in, and in His way it is that thou hast placed thy lions; but these women and these children, though weak, shall hold on their way in spite of thy lions. And with that he gave him again a downright blow, and brought him upon his knees. With this blow he also broke his helmet, and with the next he cut off an arm. Then did the giant roar so hideously, that his voice frighted the women, and yet they were {{glad to see him}} lie {{sprawling}} upon the ground. Now the lions were chained, and so of themselves could do nothing.[125] Wherefore, when old Grim, that intended to back them, was dead, Mr. Great-heart said to the Pilgrims, Come now, and follow me, and no hurt shall happen to you from the lions. They therefore went on, but the women trembled as they <b>passed</b> <b>by</b> them; <b>the</b> <b>boys</b> also looked as if they would die, but they all got by without further hurt.[126] Now then they were within sight of the Porter's Lodge, and they soon came up unto it; but they made the more haste after this to go thither, because it is dangerous travelling there in the night. So when they were come to the gate, the guide knocked, and the Porter cried, Who is there? But as soon as the guide had said, It is I, he knew his voice, and came down (for the guide had oft before that, come thither, as a conductor of pilgrims). When he was come down, he opened the gate, and seeing the guide standing just before it (for he saw not the women, for they were behind him), he said unto him, How now, Mr. Great-heart, what is your business here so late tonight? I have brought, said he, some pilgrims hither, where, by my Lord's commandment, they must lodge; I had been here some time ago, had I not been opposed <b>by</b> <b>the</b> giant that did use to back the lions; but I, after a long and tedious combat with him, have cut him off, and have brought the Pilgrims hither in safety.[127] ...|$|R
5000|$|According to his {{testimony}} at trial, while Garnier {{was in the}} forest hunting one night trying to find food {{for himself and his}} wife, a spectre appeared to him offering to ease his troubles and gave him an ointment that would allow him to change into the form of a wolf, making it easier to hunt. Garnier confessed to have stalked and murdered at least four {{children between the ages of}} 9 and 12. In October 1572, his first victim was a 10-year-old girl whom he dragged into a vineyard outside of Dole. He strangled her, removed her clothes, and ate the flesh from her thighs and arms. When he had finished he removed some flesh and took it home to his wife. Weeks later Garnier savagely attacked another girl, biting and clawing her, but was interrupted by passersby and fled. The girl succumbed to her injuries a few days later. In November, Garnier killed a 10-year-old boy, again cannibalising him by eating from his thighs and belly and tearing off a leg to save for later. He strangled another boy but was interrupted for <b>the</b> second time <b>by</b> a group of passersby. He had to abandon his prey before he could eat from it. In 1572, he attacked brutally an unknown boy who was <b>passing</b> <b>by</b> and cut <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> into half <b>by</b> biting at tearing his belly. In 1573, he strangled a girl, ate her flesh, he tore away her left leg and took it to his wife.|$|R
6000|$|As far as I {{can make}} out, he had far more fears than hopes; and perhaps every boy has. It {{was in the}} Smith house {{that he began to}} be afraid of ghosts, though he never saw one, or {{anything}} like one. He never saw even the good genius who came down the chimney and filled the children's stockings at Christmas. He wished to see him; but he understood that St. Nicholas was a shy spirit, and was apt to <b>pass</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> stockings of <b>boys</b> who lay in wait for him. His mother had told him how the Peltsnickel used to come with a bundle of rods for the bad children when the Chriskingle brought the presents of the good ones, among his grandmother's Pennsylvania German kindred; and he had got them all somehow mixed up together. Then St. Nicholas, though he was so pleasant and friendly in the poem about the night before Christmas, was known to some of <b>the</b> neighbor <b>boys</b> as Santa Claus; they called it Centre Claws, and my boy imagined him with large talons radiating from the pit of his stomach. But this was all nothing to the notion of Dowd's spectacles, which his father sometimes joked him about, and which were represented by a pair of hollow, glassless iron rims which he had found in the street. They {{may or may not have}} belonged to Dowd, and Dowd may have been an Irishman in the neighborhood, or he may not; he may have died, or he may not; but there was something in the mere gruesome mention of his spectacles which related itself to all <b>the</b> <b>boy</b> had conceived of the ghostly and ghastly, and all that was alarming in the supernatural; he could never say in the least how or why. I fancy no child can ever explain just why it is affected in this way or that way <b>by</b> <b>the</b> things that are or are not in the world about it; it is not easy to do this for one's self in after-life. At any rate, it is certain that my boy dwelt most of his time amid shadows that were, perhaps, projected over his narrow outlook from some former state of being, or from the gloomy minds of long-dead ancestors. His home was cheerful and most happy, but he peopled all its nooks and corners with shapes of doom and horror. <b>The</b> other <b>boys</b> were not slow to find this out, and their invention supplied with ready suggestion of officers and prisons any little lack of misery his spectres and goblins left. He often narrowly escaped arrest, or thought so, when they built a fire in the street at night, and suddenly kicked it to pieces, and shouted, [...] "Run, run! The constable will catch you!" [...] Nothing but flight saved my boy, in these cases, when he was small. He grew bolder, after a while, concerning constables, but never concerning ghosts; they shivered in the autumnal evenings among the tall stalks of the corn-field that stretched, a vast wilderness, behind the house to the next street, and they walked the night everywhere.|$|R
