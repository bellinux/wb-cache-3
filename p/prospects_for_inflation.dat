40|$|The {{growth of}} the UK economy {{continues}} at a brisk rate. Manufacturing output is especially buoyant. The absence of evidence suggesting a moderation in output growth reflects the continuing strong rate of growth in domestic demand. There is little hard evidence to date of a slow-down in consumer demand. Domestic demand growth continues to outstrip both output growth and the supply capacity of the economy. This is despite the current 'boom' in investment. The deficit on current account therefore continues to deteriorate. The underlying trade position is precarious and is symptomatic of high domestic demand and inflationary pressure. With many indicators pointing in an upward direction, the <b>prospects</b> <b>for</b> <b>inflation</b> are therefore the most immediate cause for concern...|$|E

40|$|In the inflation-deflation debate, deflationists view credit as {{the most}} {{important}} factor affecting prices. As far as they are concerned, the credit contraction of 2008 caused prices-in-general to fall, and prices will continue to fall unless bank lending resumes. But are these opinions based on a sound understanding of economics? The first part of this article examines the causes of price inflation and deflation from a theoretical perspective. The analysis is firmly in the Austrian tradition. The theory is then applied to recent historical data to show that the general price deflation that began {{in the wake of the}} financial crisis was not the direct result of a contraction of credit. The article concludes with a discussion of the <b>prospects</b> <b>for</b> price <b>inflation</b> and deflation in the future...|$|R
40|$|Product of {{workshop}} No. 5 at the 10 th MRM 2009 Monetary {{policy in the}} Middle East and North African (MENA) countries remains an understudied area; this book fills an important gap by examining monetary policy frameworks and monetary policy strategies in the region. Building on the editors’ earlier book, Monetary Policy and Central Banking in the Middle East and North Africa, which focused on central bank independence issues and on exchange rate regimes, this book emphasises monetary policy strategies. Part I contains {{an overview of the}} financial markets and institutions which condition the choice of monetary policy strategy in the countries of the region, followed by single-country studies on aspects of the monetary policy frameworks of Lebanon, Egypt, Jordan, the Palestinian Territory and Turkey. Part II includes analyses of the <b>prospects</b> <b>for</b> <b>inflation</b> targeting in Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia, of the monetary transmission mechanism in the Gulf Cooperation Council countries, of the relative advantages of inflation targeting and exchange rate fixity with reference to Egypt, of the problem of fiscal dominance in Egypt, and of the inflationary implications of exchange rate fixity for Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. The contributors are experts from universities inside and outside the MENA region, from central banks in the region and from outside institutions such as the European Central Bank and the International Monetary Fund.

40|$|Abstract. This article gives a brief {{overview}} of some of the theory behind the inflationary cosmology, and discusses <b>prospects</b> <b>for</b> constraining <b>inflation</b> using observations. Particular care is given to the question of falsifiability of inflation or of subsets of inflationary models. ‡ This being the first talk/article of the conference, I begin with a brief reminder of what we are currently trying to achieve in cosmology. Personally, I’m interested in the following overall goals: • To obtain a physical description of the Universe, including its global dynamics and matter content. • To measure the cosmological parameters describing the Universe, and to develop a fundamental understanding of as many of those parameters as possible. • To understand the origin and evolution of cosmic structures. • To understand the physical processes which took place during the extreme heat and density of the early Universe. Over recent years, much progress has been made on all of these topics, to the exten...|$|R
40|$|We {{discuss the}} {{constraints}} on the inhomogeneous reheating scenario. In particular, we discuss the <b>prospects</b> <b>for</b> low scale <b>inflation</b> with a Hubble constant {{of the order of}} the gravitino mass, and the possibility that an MSSM flat direction is responsible for the density fluctuations. Thermal effects are generically fatal for the scenario, and can only be avoided for small enough mass and couplings of the flat direction field, excluding MSSM flat directions. Prompt decay at the end of inflation bypasses thermal constraints, and is compatible with both low scale inflation and MSSM flat directions. However, the level of non-Gaussianity is acceptably small only for a small window of inflaton mass and couplings. The upshot is that tuning of parameters is needed for the inhomogeneous reheating scenario to work. Comment: 33 pages, 1 figur...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} a reputational equilibrium <b>for</b> <b>inflation</b> {{under the}} generic assumption that monetary policy reflects proximate preferences <b>for</b> low expected <b>inflation</b> and positive unexpected inflation. The paper stresses the qualitative implication {{that in a}} reputational equilibrium the policymaker behaves {{as if it is}} concerned about controlling inflation, even though it does not have a direct preference for a low actual inflation rate. The analysis also shows how the sovereign's <b>prospects</b> <b>for</b> survival and the private agents' memory process play critical roles in determining whether the reputational equilibrium approximates a hypothetical equilibrium with binding commitments. ...|$|R
40|$|Mr. President. I wish {{to thank}} you and the Economic, Promotion and Development Commission of the Honorable Chamber of Representatives for {{inviting}} me to speak about how our monetary policy decisions affect the country’s financial and lending conditions. The global economy is enduring terribly uncertain times, which have implications on our country’s <b>prospects</b> <b>for</b> growth and <b>inflation.</b> Thus, we share your preoccupation for evaluating how monetary policy actions – {{one of the main}} stabilizing tools we have available as a country – ultimately affect the cost of borrowing faced by households and firms. Monetary policy, {{in the context of an}} inflation target and a floating exchange rate like the one operating in Chile since 1999, is an important mechanism for smoothing out the business cycle. Periods of weak output and demand performance, which reduce the medium-term inflation outlook, lend themselves to countercyclical monetary policy actions that cushion the negative effects on consumption, investment and employment. This is what the Central Bank of Chile is presently doing, acting resolutely to moderate the effects that the global crisis – the worst we have seen in decades – is having in Chile. The transmission of monetary polic...|$|R
40|$|Inflation {{provides}} a unified paradigm {{for understanding the}} isotropy of {{the cosmic microwave background}} (CMB), the flatness problem, and the origin of large-scale structure. Although the physics responsible <b>for</b> <b>inflation</b> is not yet well understood, slow-roll inflation generically makes several predictions: a flat Universe, primordial adiabatic density perturbations, and a stochastic gravity-wave background. Inflation further predicts specific relations between the amplitudes and shapes of the spectrum of density perturbations and gravity waves. There are now excellent <b>prospects</b> <b>for</b> testing precisely these predictions with forthcoming CMB temperature and polarization maps. Here I discuss these new CMB tests of inflation. 1...|$|R
40|$|This essay {{argues that}} central bank {{independence}} {{is more important}} today {{than at any time}} in history. Because fiscal incentives <b>for</b> <b>inflation</b> grow as government debt grows, and in view of the huge run-up in government debt in the 1980 s, with <b>prospects</b> <b>for</b> continued growth in the 1990 s, we believe that the principal mission of our nation's central bank is at risk. Our aim is to provide a convincing case for the view that the power to spend money and the power to print money must be separate and independent powers within the government.
