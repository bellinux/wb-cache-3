5|$|The {{operator}} interface {{provides a means}} for an operator to start and stop the motor and adjust the operating speed. Additional operator control functions might include reversing, and switching between manual speed adjustment and automatic control from an external <b>process</b> <b>control</b> signal. The {{operator interface}} often includes an alphanumeric display and/or indication lights and meters {{to provide information about}} the operation of the drive. An operator interface keypad and display unit is often provided {{on the front of the}} VFD controller as shown in the photograph above. The keypad display can often be cable-connected and mounted a short distance from the VFD controller. Most are also provided with input and output (I/O) terminals for connecting push buttons, switches, and other operator interface devices or control signals. A serial communications port is also often available to allow the VFD to be configured, adjusted, monitored, and controlled using a computer.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{relationship}} between subsidiaries' local linkages and headquarters' use of <b>process</b> <b>controls.</b> Making use of both agency and network theories, we conceptualize subsidiaries as agents within multinational networks, as well as instruments seeking resources from external networks. In accordance with agency theory, we predict that subsidiaries' use of local linkages {{will result in a}} decrease in the use of <b>process</b> <b>controls</b> by headquarters. Empirical results from 407 Taiwanese firms confirm this hypothesis, suggesting that headquarters employing <b>process</b> <b>controls</b> to monitor subsidiaries' linkages with local actors (i. e., local firms) is too costly. Headquarters' use of <b>process</b> <b>controls</b> decreases when a subsidiary is a joint venture, and as the firm accumulates experience in a host market. (C) 2006 Elsevier Inc.

Recently scholars have suggested that firms can use alliance commitment and <b>process</b> <b>controls</b> to improve alliance performance.

In this paper we examine the mediating role of <b>process</b> <b>controls</b> {{on the relationship between}} alliance commitment and alliance performance.

25|$|Computers {{can perform}} both {{sequential}} control and feedback control, and typically a single computer will do both {{in an industrial}} application. Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are a type of special purpose microprocessor that replaced many hardware components such as timers and drum sequencers used in relay logic type systems. General purpose <b>process</b> <b>control</b> computers have increasingly replaced stand alone controllers, with a single computer able to perform the operations of hundreds of controllers. <b>Process</b> <b>control</b> computers can process data from a network of PLCs, instruments and controllers in order to implement typical (such as PID) control of many individual variables or, in some cases, to implement complex control algorithms using multiple inputs and mathematical manipulations. They can also analyze data and create real time graphical displays for operators and run reports for operators, engineers and management.|$|E

40|$|If it is {{possible}} to regulate program execution speed, we can control program execution speed arbitrarily regardless of hardware performance to improve convenience of service. We proposed mechanism to regulate program execution speed. The proposed mechanism can <b>control</b> only one <b>process,</b> but canâ€™t <b>control</b> multiple <b>processes.</b> However, since in most cases one service consists of multiple processes, it is necessary to establish multiple <b>processes</b> <b>control</b> mechanism for regulating program execution speed. There are numerous combinations of processes when multiple <b>processes</b> are <b>controlled.</b> Therefore the execution speed of all processes need to be regulated smoothly in all combinations.
