5|$|As dawn broke next morning, 15 May 1943, a torpedo hit Irish Oak at 8:19am (12:19 German Summer Time). Two torpedoes were launched, one missed, {{the other}} struck her <b>port</b> <b>side</b> and exploded.|$|E
5|$|Ballard's {{survey found}} no {{underwater}} penetrations of the ship's fully armoured citadel. Eight holes {{were found in}} the hull, one on the starboard side and seven on the <b>port</b> <b>side,</b> all above the waterline. One of the holes is in the deck, on the bow's starboard side. The angle and shape indicates the shell that created the hole was fired from Bismarcks <b>port</b> <b>side</b> and struck the starboard anchor chain. The anchor chain has disappeared down this hole. Six holes are amidships, three shell fragments pierced the upper splinter belt, and one made a hole in the main armour belt. Further aft a huge hole is visible, parallel to the aircraft catapult, on the deck. The submersibles recorded no sign of a shell penetration through the main or side armour here, and {{it is likely that the}} shell penetrated the deck armour only. Huge dents showed that many of the 14inch shells fired by King George V bounced off the German belt armour.|$|E
5|$|The XB-70's {{maiden flight}} was on 21 September 1964. In {{the first flight}} test, between Palmdale and Edwards AFB, one engine had {{to be shut down}} shortly after take-off, and an {{undercarriage}} malfunction warning meant that the flight was flown with the undercarriage down as a precaution, limiting speed to 390mph - about half that planned. During landing, the rear wheels of the <b>port</b> <b>side</b> main gear locked, the tires ruptured, and a fire started.|$|E
50|$|In round 3 2009 Thompson {{made his}} AFL debut for Port Adelaide against Melbourne, {{becoming}} one of six Indigenous Australians in <b>Port's</b> <b>side,</b> equaling {{the record for the}} most Indigenous players in a single AFL team.|$|R
50|$|Cotton {{made his}} senior AFL debut against Carlton at Football Park in round 10 1997 and kicked two goals. He made three further {{appearances}} that season {{but was unable}} to break into <b>Port's</b> <b>side</b> in 1998 and was delisted {{at the end of the}} year.|$|R
50|$|Beginning his AFL {{career with}} the inaugural <b>Port</b> Adelaide <b>side</b> to enter the AFL, Burgoyne became well {{regarded}} for his performance as an attacking midfielder. He was selected from the <b>Port</b> Adelaide <b>side</b> in the South Australian National Football League (SANFL) in their changeover from the SANFL to the AFL.|$|R
5|$|The {{forward section}} lies on its <b>port</b> <b>side,</b> with the {{amidships}} section keel up. The stern section {{rises from the}} seabed at an angle. This position shows the rudder locked into a 20° port turn, confirming that orders had been given (just prior to the aft magazines detonating) to change the ship's heading and bring the aft turrets 'X' and 'Y' {{to bear on the}} German ships.|$|E
5|$|The four British ships fired {{more than}} 2,800 shells at Bismarck, and scored more than 400 hits, but {{were unable to}} sink Bismarck by gunfire. At around 10:20, running low on fuel, Tovey ordered the cruiser Dorsetshire to sink Bismarck with torpedoes and sent his battleships back to port. Dorsetshire fired a pair of torpedoes into Bismarcks {{starboard}} side, one of which hit. Dorsetshire then moved around to her <b>port</b> <b>side</b> and fired another torpedo, which also hit. By the time these torpedo attacks took place, the ship was already listing so badly that the deck was partly awash. It appears that the final torpedo may have detonated against Bismarcks <b>port</b> <b>side</b> superstructure, which was by then already underwater. Around 10:35, Bismarck capsized to port and slowly sank by the stern, disappearing from the surface at 10:40. Some survivors reported they saw Captain Lindemann standing at attention at the stem of the ship as she sank.|$|E
5|$|The maindeck of Chesapeake {{was almost}} deserted, having been swept by Shannons gunfire; the {{surviving}} gun crews had either {{responded to the}} call for boarders or had taken refuge below. Two American officers, Lieutenant Cox (who had returned from carrying Captain Lawrence down to the surgeon) and Midshipman Russell saw that the aftmost 18-pounders on the <b>port</b> <b>side,</b> still bore on Shannon and working between them managed to fire both.|$|E

5|$|The only damage {{she took}} that year {{occurred}} 30 April 1943, {{while she was}} changing stations on formation, Milwaukee struck Omahas starboard bow. The collision destroyed one of her paravanes and rupturing some plating, which caused some flooding. Omahas damage control party shored up one hole with two mattresses {{and were able to}} stop the leak. One compartment was completely flooded with another compartment requiring pumping out every two hours. On Milwaukee, the 6-inch guns and torpedo tubes on her <b>port</b> <b>side</b> were unserviceable. Several holes had opened up along her <b>port</b> <b>side</b> that were above the main deck, along with some leaks under the waterline from damage to plates and rivets. Milwaukee also lost her No.3 main circulation pump. The damage was determined not to be serious enough to halt their mission and the two cruisers, after completing their patrol, put into Rio de Janeiro for the needed repairs at the Brazilian Navy Yard.|$|E
5|$|The tender Daisy 2, skippered by John Gatt, {{had been}} tied {{up for the}} night to Royal Oaks <b>port</b> <b>side.</b> As the sinking {{battleship}} began to list to starboard, Gatt ordered Daisy 2 to be cut loose, his vessel becoming briefly caught on Royal Oaks rising anti-torpedo bulge and lifted from the sea before freeing herself.|$|E
5|$|During World War I, {{a pair of}} 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns on high-angle mounts were fitted as {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns, one gun at the bow and {{the other}} on top of 'X' turret. In 1925 the number of 50-caliber 76-millimeter guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. Two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were also fitted. In 1926 the rangefinders were upgraded and a fixed aircraft catapult was mounted on the <b>port</b> <b>side</b> of the forecastle for a Macchi M.18 seaplane.|$|E
50|$|Boyd {{was a key}} {{member of}} the strong <b>Port</b> Adelaide <b>side</b> of the 1950s, playing in seven premiership sides.|$|R
5000|$|The {{standard}} armament {{consists of}} two 12.7 mm heavy machine guns. This is supplemented by the two Stanflex modulary mission payload slots (one on the foredeck, the other aft of the superstructure), which can be fitted with a multi-purpose gun, surface-to-air missiles, or ASW torpedoes, along with other non-weapon payloads. Another two container positions are [...] "prepared for" [...] but not installed on the starboard and <b>port</b> <b>sides</b> of the heli deck.|$|R
50|$|The rear {{compartment}} is for 10 {{troops who}} sit on benches {{back to back}} so they can fire their personal weapons through <b>side</b> <b>ports</b> (3 either <b>side)</b> and they depart the vehicle via two doors set in the rear.|$|R
5|$|In 1977, British Airways and Singapore Airlines {{shared a}} Concorde for flights between London and Singapore International Airport at Paya Lebar via Bahrain. The aircraft, BA's Concorde G-BOAD, was painted in Singapore Airlines livery on the <b>port</b> <b>side</b> and British Airways livery on the {{starboard}} side. The service was discontinued after three return flights because of noise complaints from the Malaysian government; {{it could only}} be reinstated on a new route bypassing Malaysian airspace in 1979. A dispute with India prevented Concorde from reaching supersonic speeds in Indian airspace, so the route was eventually declared not viable and discontinued in 1980.|$|E
5|$|Losing {{power and}} speed, Roma {{began to fall}} out of the battle group. Around 16:02, another Fritz X slammed into the {{starboard}} side of Romas deck, between frames 123 and 136. It most likely detonated in the forward engine room, sparking flames, and causing heavy flooding in the magazines of main battery turret number two and the fore <b>port</b> <b>side</b> secondary battery turret, and putting even more pressure upon the previously stressed hull girder. Seconds after the initial blast, the number two 15-inch turret was blown over the side by a massive explosion, this time from the detonation of that turret's magazines.|$|E
5|$|On U.S. Navy vessels, even-numbered {{compartments}} {{are found}} on the <b>port</b> <b>side,</b> but zero is reserved for compartments that intersect the centerline. That is, the numbers read 6-4-2-0-1-3-5 from port to starboard. In the game of roulette, the number 0 does not count as even or odd, giving the casino an advantage on such bets. Similarly, the parity of zero can affect payoffs in prop bets when the outcome depends on whether some randomized number is odd or even, {{and it turns out}} to be zero.|$|E

5000|$|Three- and four-way have an L- or T-shaped {{hole through}} the middle. The {{different}} combinations of flow are shown in the figure. It {{is easy to see}} that a T valve can connect any pair of ports, or all three, together, but the 45 degree position which might disconnect all three leaves no margin for error. The L valve can connect the center <b>port</b> to either <b>side</b> <b>port,</b> or disconnect all three, but it cannot connect the <b>side</b> <b>ports</b> together.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a four-legged mast, which was moved forward of the funnels, the rangefinders were upgraded, and the ship was equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret. Around that same time she was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on the <b>port</b> <b>side</b> of the forecastle.|$|E
5|$|The second torpedo struck Bismarck in her stern on the <b>port</b> <b>side,</b> {{near the}} port rudder shaft. The {{coupling}} {{on the port}} rudder assembly was badly damaged and the rudder became locked in a 12° turn to port. The explosion also caused much shock damage. The crew eventually managed to repair the starboard rudder but the port rudder remained jammed. A suggestion to sever the port rudder with explosives was dismissed by Lütjens, as damage to the screws would have left the battleship helpless. At 21:15, Lütjens reported that the ship was unmanoeuvrable.|$|E
5|$|With {{the weather}} worsening, Lütjens {{attempted}} to detach Prinz Eugen at 16:40. The squall was not heavy {{enough to cover}} her withdrawal from Wake-Walker's cruisers, which continued to maintain radar contact. Prinz Eugen was therefore recalled temporarily. The cruiser was successfully detached at 18:14. Bismarck turned around to face Wake-Walker's formation, forcing Suffolk to turn away at high speed. Prince of Wales fired twelve salvos at Bismarck, which responded with nine salvos, none of which hit. The action diverted British attention and permitted Prinz Eugen to slip away. After Bismarck resumed her previous heading, Wake-Walker's three ships took up station on Bismarcks <b>port</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
2500|$|LST-464 was {{converted}} into a [...] "first aid ship" [...] at Sydney, Australia, in 1943. These modifications included the installation in the tank deck bulkhead of a watertight door to allow access to the forward troop compartment from both the starboard and <b>port</b> <b>sides</b> of the ship. Spaces were also converted to receiving, sterilizer, and operating rooms. On the tank deck, 78 hospital beds, refrigerators, lockers, toilets and wash basins were installed. LST-464s medical staff was increased to six doctors, one dentist {{and a number of}} corpsmen.|$|R
50|$|It {{is likely}} that the K-200 sported a weapon fit similar to the H8K. This would have {{consisted}} of a Type 99 20mm cannon in a tail turret and in a turret {{on the top of the}} fuselage, forward of the wings. Blisters on the forward <b>port</b> <b>sides</b> of the hull would have carried either the Type 99 or the Type 92 7.7mm machine-gun. Another cannon was located in the nose. The K-200 may have also been capable of carrying torpedoes, depth charges, or bombs.|$|R

5|$|Another {{effort to}} raise Monitors {{propeller}} was successful on 8 June 1998, although {{the amount of}} effort required {{to work in the}} difficult conditions off Cape Hatteras was underestimated and the fewer than 30 divers used were nearly overwhelmed. The 1999 dive season was mostly research oriented as divers investigated the wreck in detail, planning how to recover the engine and determining if they could stabilize the hull so that it would not collapse onto the turret. In 2000 the divers shored up the <b>port</b> <b>side</b> of the hull with bags of grout, installed the engine recovery system, an external framework to which the engine would be attached, in preparation for the next season, and made over five times as many dives as they had the previous season.|$|E
5|$|Armidale {{undertook}} evasive action, manoeuvring frantically {{to avoid}} the aerial attack. However, at 15:15, the vessel was struck by two air-launched torpedoes, one hitting her <b>port</b> <b>side</b> and the other colliding with the engineering spaces, before a bomb exploded aft. Armidale listed sharply to port at this stage, and the order was given to abandon ship. As the crew leapt into the sea, they were strafed by the attacking aircraft. Sheean—after assisting to free a life-raft—was hit by two bullets {{from one of the}} aircraft, wounding him in the chest and back. Scrambling across the deck, he strapped himself into the aft Oerlikon 20mm cannon and began shooting at the fighters in an effort to protect some of the sailors already in the sea. Subject to the fire from Sheean's Oerlikon, the Japanese aircraft were kept at bay and were unable to effectively strafe those in the water.|$|E
5|$|At 14:30 on 6 November, UB-45 was departing Varna, Bulgaria, under escort by the Bulgarian {{torpedo boat}} Strogi that had cleared {{a path through}} Russian mines. At what {{was thought to be}} the edge of the minefield, UB-45 swung around Strogis <b>port</b> <b>side</b> {{directly}} into a second minefield that had been laid by Russian forces the night before. A Hertz horn mine exploded between UB-45s control room and engine room with enough force to break the boat in half. UB-45 sank so rapidly that the only survivors were three men on the conning tower and two on deck, all of whom were injured; the other fifteen men on board perished in the attack. One of the survivors died from the severity of his wounds the following day.|$|E

30|$|The 25 -gauge vitrectomy system {{provides}} surgical instruments which {{are suitable for}} the manipulation through <b>side</b> <b>ports</b> at the corneal limbus. A 25 -gauge vitreous cutter is inserted from one <b>side</b> <b>port</b> and a 25 -gauge infusion cannula is held at another <b>side</b> <b>port</b> to maintain the anterior chamber with continuous irrigation. Anterior circular capsulectomy, similar to continuous curvilinear capsulorrhexis, is easily accomplished with a vitreous cutter. The lens cortex in the capsular bag is then aspirated with a vitreous cutter in a cutter-off mode. Bimanual irrigation and aspiration system for cataract surgery can be used instead of the 25 -gauge vitrectomy system. After the intraocular lens is implanted in the capsular bag from the corneoscleral incision on the superior side, a 25 -gauge trocar is inserted directly and perpendicularly from the scleral surface under the irrigation to maintain the intraocular pressure with a 25 -gauge cannula from the limbal <b>side</b> <b>port.</b> Only one trocar at the pars plicata to pars plana {{is enough to make}} posterior capsulotomy and anterior vitrectomy with the aid of irrigation from the limbal <b>side</b> <b>port.</b>|$|R
