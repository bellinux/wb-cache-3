40|$|Purpose: Analytical {{determination}} of impact velocity for different combination of target and projectile materials is {{the objective of}} this paper. Design/methodology/approach: The <b>penetration</b> <b>efficiency</b> is maximum when the interaction between the projectile and target is hydrodynamic. Considering zero strength for target and projectile the hydrodynamic impact velocities are predicted using hydrodynamic equation of state. Findings: The hydrodynamic equation being an indeterminate equation is solved using interface theory (briefed in the appendix). The indeterminate Johnson-Cook (JC) model and Steinberg-Guinian (SG) model are also solved using interface theory to predict the influence of static strength of projectile and thermal softening effects. It is inferred that the <b>penetration</b> <b>efficiency</b> decreases with increasing static strength of target and also due to thermal softening of the projectile. In the process the plastic strain, the strain rate and the increase in temperature during impact are theoretically predicted. The segmented projectiles have less/more <b>penetration</b> <b>efficiency</b> than the monolithic impactors and hence require higher/lower impact velocities nearing to hydrodynamic state. Research limitations/implications: The analytical results obtained are in fair agreement with experimental results obtained in the reviewed literatures. Some contrasts are also observed.

These DMAs include the TSI nanoDMA, the Caltech radial DMA (RDMA) and nanoRDMA, the Grimm nanoDMA, and the Karlsruhe-Vienna DMA. Measurements were done using tetra-alkyl ammonium ion standards with mobility diameters of 1. 16, 1. 47, and 1. 70 nm. These monomobile ions were generated by electrospray followed by high resolution mobility classification. Measurements were focused at an aerosol-to-sheath flow ratio of 0. 1.

40|$|Skin is {{a complex}} {{structured}} system primarily involved in Transdermal Drug Delivery (TDD). The outer stratum corneum represents the main barrier {{to the entrance of}} external molecules. Nowadays, none of the recognized methods, used for the investigation of penetration processes, is able to give a complete overview of the transport mechanisms involved. Standard protocols are based on the use of human or animal skin samples, which are difficult and expensive to obtain. Here, we present a novel experimental setup to investigate TDD by using Confocal Laser Scanning Microscopy and image analysis. The methodology is based on diffusion experiments of fluorescent-labelled fluids (water, oil, and oil-in-water emulsions), in a model matrix. Using an agarose gel as model for a proof of concept, different <b>penetration</b> <b>efficiencies</b> were observed, suggesting an important role of both chemical composition and fluid microstructure on the transport mechanism. An adequate model system should be used to better mimic the stratum corneum morphology and properties. To this aim, several bicontinuous emulsion gels, obtained from an emulsification process, were preliminary formulated and suggested as model systems to mimic the stratum corneum.

The less efficient penetration of MAbs because of their large size and {{the complexity of the}} tumor microenvironment has impelled the development of small-molecule biologics with superior <b>penetration</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> Complex structures of PD-L 1 with a PD-L 1 targeting nanobody and non-peptide small inhibitors have been reported (Zak et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2017). This enabled us to compare the binding properties of these small-molecule inhibitors with durvalumab to investigate the hot spots on PD-L 1 for future development of biologics for a better anti-tumor efficacy. The results revealed that the binding of anti-PD-L 1 nanobody (KN 035) shows more similarity to that of VH domain of durvalumab (Fig.  2 D). Similarly, the second PD-L 1 molecule induced by the binding of non-pepitde anti-PD-L 1 inhibitors, the BMS- 202 and BMS- 8, which is believed to be responsible for the blockade of PD- 1 /PD-L 1 interaction, resembles the binding of VH domain of durvalumab (Fig.  2 D). On the other hand, the binding of VL does not overlap with that of the nanobody and small-molecule inhibitors. These results indicate that the binding sites of the VH domain of durvalumab may serve as hot spots for small inhibitory biologics development.|$|R

40|$|The {{emission}} of unipolar air ions {{in the vicinity}} of a filtering facepiece respirator has been recently shown to considerably enhance its respiratory protection efficiency. The effect is driven by the electric repelling forces that develop between the unipolarly charged mask and the aerosol particles, thus creating a shield for the incoming particles and consequently decreasing the <b>penetration</b> <b>efficiency</b> through the filter. The manikin-based preliminary evaluation of this concept has been performed with a very limited number of variables. In this study, four types of half-mask facepiece filtering devices (N 95, R 95, and dust-mist respirators, as well as surgical masks), operating at two different breathing flow rates, were tested with unipolar air ion emitters exhibiting different emission rates and polarities. The particle <b>penetration</b> <b>efficiency</b> through the facepiece filter was determined in a room-size indoor test chamber by a real-time particle size selective aerosol monitoring performed inside and outside of the mask, which was face-sealed onto a manikin. Three commercially available ionic air purifiers were utilized as air ion emitters. For the targeted particle size range of ~ 0. 04 – 1. 3 µm, a 12 - minute air ionization {{in the vicinity of}} a manikin enhanced the respiratory mask performance by a factor ranging from 1. 61 to 3, 250, depending on the respirator type, breathing flo...|$|E

40|$|Glycoprotein IV (gIV) of bovine {{herpesvirus}} 1 (BHV- 1), a homolog of {{herpes simplex}} virus glycoprotein D, represents {{a major component of}} the viral envelope and a dominant immunogen. To analyze the functional role of gIV during BHV- 1 replication, cell line BUIV 3 - 7, which constitutively expresses gIV, was constructed and used for the isolation of gIV- BHV- 1 mutant 80 - 221, in which the gIV gene was replaced by a lacZ expression cassette. On complementing gIV-expressing cells, the gIV- BHV- 1 replicated normally but was unable to form plaques and infectious progeny on noncomplementing cells. Further analysis showed that gIV is essential for BHV- 1 entry into target cells, whereas viral gene expression, DNA replication, and envelopment appear unchanged in both noncomplementing and complementing cells infected with phenotypically complemented gIV- BHV- 1. The block in entry could be overcome by polyethylene glycol-induced membrane fusion. After passaging of gIV- BHV- 1 on complementing cells, a rescued variant, BHV- 1 res, was isolated and shown to underexpress gIV in comparison with its wild-type parent. Comparison of the penetration kinetics of BHV- 1 wild type, phenotypically complemented gIV- BHV- 1, and BHV- 1 res indicated that <b>penetration</b> <b>efficiency</b> correlated with the amount of gIV present in virus particles. In conclusion, we show that gIV of BHV- 1 is an essential component of the virion involved in virus entry and that the amount of gIV in the viral envelope modulates the <b>penetration</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the virus...|$|E
40|$|Dermal {{exposure}} to sensitizing metals {{is a serious}} occupational and public health problem. The usual approach to dermal exposure assessment is to process samples by chemical methods that use reactants to digest the metal particles and quantify the mass. In the case of dermal exposure assessment, these reactants are not representative of the skin surface film liquids and hence, may overestimate bioaccessibility. We hypothesize that the amount and form of sensitizer on a sample that leaches in a biological fluid, as can be estimated using artificial sweat, {{may be a more}} relevant metric for assessing health risks. Beryllium metal (Be), nickel metal (Ni), and chromium carbide (Cr 3 C 2) particles were characterized and masses of sensitizing ions were measured using established reactant-assisted digestion procedures and extraction in artificial sweat under physiologically relevant conditions. Chromium ions released into artificial sweat were speciated to understand valence states. The ratios of the fraction of metal dissolved in artificial sweat relative to that dissolved by chemical-specific reactants were 1 / 2 (Be), 1 / 108 (Ni), and 1 / 2500 (Cr). The divalent Be and Ni cations were stable in artificial sweat over time (did not precipitate) whereas hexavalent chromium [Cr(VI) ] ions decayed over time. Further analysis using speciated isotope dilution mass spectrometry revealed that the decay of Cr(VI) was accompanied by the formation of Cr(III) in the sweat model. Use of reactant-assisted analytical chemistry to quantify amounts of metal sensitizers on samples could overestimate biologically relevant exposure. In addition to mass, the valence state also influences penetration through the outer stratum corneum of the skin and is an important consideration when assessing {{exposure to}} complex sensitizers such as Cr which have multiple valence states with differing <b>penetration</b> <b>efficiencies.</b> CC 999999 /Intramural CDC HHS/United States 2015 - 08 - 24 T 00 : 00 : 00 Z 24448251 PMC 454782...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the facing-the-wind sampling efficiency of three personal aerosol samplers as a function of particle phase (solid versus liquid). Samplers examined were the IOM, Button, and a prototype personal high-flow inhalable sampler head (PHISH). The prototype PHISH was designed to interface with the 37 -mm closed-face cassette and provide an inhalable sample at 10 l min(- 1) of flow. Increased flow rate increases the amount of mass collected during a typical work shift and helps to ensure that limits of detection are met, particularly for well-controlled but highly toxic species. Two PHISH prototypes were tested: one with a screened inlet and one with a single-pore open-face inlet. Personal aerosol samplers were tested on a bluff-body disc that was rotated along the facing-the-wind axis to reduce spatiotemporal variability associated with sampling supermicron aerosol in low-velocity wind tunnels. When compared to published data for facing-wind aspiration efficiency for a mouth-breathing mannequin, the IOM oversampled relative to mannequin facing-the-wind aspiration efficiency for all sizes and particle types (solid and liquid). The sampling efficiency of the Button sampler was closer to the mannequin facing-the-wind aspiration efficiency than the IOM for solid particles, but the screened inlet removed most liquid particles, resulting in a large underestimation compared to the mannequin facing-the-wind aspiration efficiency. The open-face PHISH results showed overestimation for solid particles and underestimation for liquid particles when compared to the mannequin facing-the-wind aspiration efficiency. Substantial (and statistically significant) differences in sampling efficiency were observed between liquid and solid particles, particularly for the Button and screened-PHISH, with a majority of aerosol mass depositing on the screened inlets of these samplers. Our results suggest that large droplets have low <b>penetration</b> <b>efficiencies</b> through screened inlets and that particle bounce, for solid particles, is an important determinant of aspiration and sampling efficiencies for samplers with screened inlets.

40|$|Reported herein are {{the results}} of an {{experimental}} wind tunnel investigation of a circular supersonic jet (Mj = 3. 47) injected at a 10 degree angle into a supersonic freestream. Measurements were made for nominal freestream Mach numbers of 1. 6, 2. 0, 2. 5 and 3. 0. Three jet total pressures were run at each freestream Mach number, resulting in twelve separate operating conditions. The measurements indicate the presence of two pairs of contra-rotating vortices. One pair follows the jet trajectory and tends to split the jet into two streams. A smaller pair, rotating in an opposite sense, develops in the near wall region. Reported results include Mach number and volume fraction distributions in the cross plane, as well as jet <b>penetration</b> and mixing <b>efficiency...</b>|$|R
