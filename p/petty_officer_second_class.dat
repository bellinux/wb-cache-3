Sea Cadet STCs are commanded by a CIC officer of the rank of Commander. Most employ staff cadets at the ranks of <b>Petty</b> <b>Officer</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Class</b> through Chief Petty Officer First Class, with a CPO1 being appointed as Cadet Cox'n. Additionally, some employ staff cadets at the rank of Leading Cadet for support positions. Staff cadets are paid at a percentage of a CF Naval Cadet's (officer trainee) basic pay.|$|E

50|$|Before the {{creation}} of the CIC, Cadet Service of Canada Officers that led Army Cadets were trained through a seven-week modified Reserve Force Infantry Officers Course during July and August. Air Cadet Squadron Officers had a similar training system. With integration, those programs ceased. In 1969, the Army Cadet program that was accustomed to sending new entries for training, established an internal training program. They conducted two-week summer courses at the Citadelle in Quebec City, for groups of officers from the three elements. A school for Cadet Instructors was established in Eastern Region in 1971. From 1972 on, CIL officers were required to take courses at what was first called the Cadet Instructor School, and later became the RCIS (Regional Cadet Instructor School). Passing these courses was not yet a prerequisite for promotion. During the first few years, officers of all ranks were taking part in the basic courses. Following the example of Eastern Region, other regions opened schools during the mid-1970s and, in 1976, Ottawa finally gave them official blessing by providing training programs and standards to meet. Since then, taking courses has been required for promotion. Former Officers of the Regular Force or Primary Reserve who component transfer to the Cadet Organization and Training Service maintain their commission and Non Commissioned Members may retain their rank or choose to be commissioned into the CIC Branch. Sergeants/Petty <b>Officers</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Class</b> are commissioned as Second Lieutenants/Acting Sub Lieutenants, former Warrant Officers/Petty Officers First Class are commissioned as Lieutenants/Sub Lieutenants and former Master Warrant Officers/Chief <b>Petty</b> <b>Officers</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Class</b> and Chief Warrant Officers/Chief <b>Petty</b> <b>Officers</b> First Class are commissioned as Captains/Lieutenants (Navy).|$|R
25|$|In October 1941, BuNav {{authorized}} {{a school}} to be established on Treasure Island, {{the site of the}} 1939-1940 Golden Gate International Exposition. The curriculum basically replicated that existing at RMS-Bellevue, but with a much larger student body. When the ETP was formed the following January, this became the ARM Treasure Island, and for a brief period included a Primary School. Commander Harry F. Breckel was the first Commanding Officer (he was promoted to the rank of Captain in early 1944). The first class of 566 students was about 25 percent Hams, entering as Radioman <b>Petty</b> <b>Officer</b> <b>Second</b> <b>Class.</b> Special placement examinations divided the class into different levels, allowing the first graduation in only a few months; many of the early graduates immediately became instructors. The radar laboratories were on close by, highly secure Yerba Buena Island, and ARM Treasure Island had the lead in developing sonar lectures and laboratories. This school graduated about 10,000 technicians under the wartime curriculum, the last in June 1946. It remained a peacetime Navy advanced electronics “C” School until 1996.|$|E

500|$|Crean's initial naval {{apprenticeship}} was {{aboard the}} training ship [...] Impregnable at Devonport. In November 1894, he {{was transferred to}} Devastation. By his 18th birthday, in 1895, Crean was serving in Royal Arthur, and rated ordinary seaman. Less than a year later, he was in Wild Swan as an able seaman, and later joined the Navy's torpedo school ship, Defiance. By 1899, Crean had advanced to the rate of <b>petty</b> <b>officer,</b> <b>second</b> <b>class</b> and was serving in Vivid. In February 1900, Crean was posted to the torpedo vessel Ringarooma, {{which was part of}} the Royal Navy's New Zealand Squadron based in the South Island. On 18 December 1901, he was demoted from petty officer to able seaman for an unspecified misdemeanour. In December 1901, the Ringarooma was ordered to assist Robert Falcon Scott's ship Discovery when it was docked at Lyttelton Harbour awaiting to departure to Antarctica. When an able seaman of Scott's ship deserted after striking a petty officer, a replacement was required; Crean volunteered, and was accepted.|$|E

The insert point was roughly one and one half miles from the nearest Named Area of Interest. The team members were team leader Navy Lieutenant Michael P.

After moving to a pre-determined, covered overwatch position, from which the SEALs could observe the Named Areas of Interest, the team was discovered by local goat herders. Determining that they were civilians, not combatants, Lieutenant Murphy released them, according to rules of engagement.|$|E
