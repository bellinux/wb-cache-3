The method is based on a suitably adapted free-discontinuity problem. Its main features are the use of phase-field functions to describe the defects to be reconstructed and the use of perimeter-like <b>penalizations</b> to regularize the ill-posed problem. The numerical implementation is based on the solution of the corre-sponding optimality system by a gradient method. Numerical simulations are presented to show the validity of the method...|$|R
40|$|A model {{selection}} criterion {{based on a}} divergence or discrepancy measure is generally comprised of a goodness-of-fit term and a penalty term. The penalty term, which reflects model complexity, serves as an estimate of a quantity known as the expected optimism. Classical approaches to approximating the expected optimism often lead to simplistic <b>penalizations.</b> However, such approaches usually involve stringent assump-tions that may fail to hold in practical applications. Modern computational statistical methods facilitate the development of improved estimators of the expected optimism. Selection criteria based on such penalty terms often provide more realistic measures of predictive efficacy than their classical counterparts, thereby resulting in superior model determinations. To survey this methodology, we outline the general framework for discrepancy-based model selection criteria, and review computationally intensive approaches for evalu-ating complexity <b>penalizations...</b>|$|R

Recently, efforts have been made to propose alternative treatments of amblyopia that do allow for the improvement of binocular sight, for example using binasal occlusion or partially frosted spectacles in place of any eye patch, using alternating occlusion goggles or using methods of perceptual learning based on video games or virtual reality games for enhancing binocular vision.|$|E
25|$|Johnstone {{supported}} the Rockingham faction, which {{was opposed to}} North's policies in American affairs. He was particularly skilled at denunciations and obstructing legislation, attacking the 1773 Tea Act as ‘criminally absurd’, and argued that the Boston Port Bill would unite Americans against Britain. He also opposed the altering of the charter of Massachusetts and the 1774 Quebec Act. Other matters he spoke on in Parliament included {{his opposition to the}} <b>penalization</b> of Irish Catholics, imprisonment for debt, and of impressment in the navy. He also opposed the slave trade, calling it ‘a commerce of the most barbarous and cruel kind that ever disgraced the transactions of any civilised people’. He tended towards pragmatism on other affairs, believing that while taxing Americans was legal, it was inexpedient, and that sending troops to America would be ultimately fruitless and to maintain order would require the garrisoning of forces in the colonies at great expense. Instead he urged conciliation to redress colonial grievances. His temper occasionally got the better of him, leading to difficult situations, and on one occasion a duel with Lord George Germain.|$|E
40|$|We {{consider}} {{the problem of}} unveiling the implicit network structure of user interactions in a social network, based only on high-frequency timestamps. Our inference {{is based on the}} minimization of the least-squares loss associated with a multivariate Hawkes model, penalized by ℓ_ 1 and trace norms. We provide a first theoretical analysis of the generalization error for this problem, that includes sparsity and low-rank inducing priors. This result involves a new data-driven concentration inequality for matrix martingales in continuous time with observable variance, which is a result of independent interest. A consequence of our analysis is the construction of sharply tuned ℓ_ 1 and trace-norm <b>penalizations,</b> that leads to a data-driven scaling of the variability of information available for each users.

2500|$|The committee's {{proposed}} legislation was {{introduced into the}} House on July 21 as the USA PATRIOT and Terrorism Prevention Reauthorization Act of 2005. It repealed the sunset date for surveillance provisions of the Patriot Act [...] in other words, {{it would have made}} those sections permanent. A number of amendments were also proposed and passed. Several of the amendments were to surveillance provisions and included an amendment that added to the list of terrorist crimes {{that could be used for}} obtaining electronic surveillance, the requirement that the Director of the FBI must personally approve any library or bookstore requests by the FBI under section 215, making law enforcement report back to a court within 15 days of using the a roving wiretap and the narrowing of the scope for [...] "sneak-and-peek" [...] delayed notification search warrants. Several other amendments were related to NSLs, including allowing those in receipt of an NSL the ability to consult a lawyer and challenge it in court and preventing the <b>penalization</b> of NSL recipients who are mentally incompetent, under undue stress, under threat of bodily harm, or under a threat of being fired if they disclose they have been served an NSL. Other amendments included standardizing penalties for terrorist attacks and other violence against railroad carriers and mass transportation systems on land, water, or in the air and clarifying the definition of terrorism in forfeiture laws. Congressman Howard Berman proposed an amendment that required a report to Congress on the development and use of data mining technology by departments and agencies of the Federal government. Other amendments were proposed to other areas not covered by the USA PATRIOT Act, for instance one amendment defined a new crime of [...] "narco-terrorism," [...] while another addressed crime and terrorism at U.S. seaports. The bill was passed 257-171 however when it was introduced into the Senate it was replaced by a bill proposed by Arlen Specter, S.1389. The Senate then requested a conference with the House.|$|E

60|$|On {{their way}} back to Becket, after the visit to Tryst, Felix and Nedda dropped Derek half-way on the road to Joyfields. They found that the Becket {{household}} already knew of the arrest. Woven into a dirge on the subject of 'the Land,' the last town doings, and adventures on golf courses, it formed the genial topic of the dinner-table; for the Bulgarian with his carbohydrates was already a wonder of the past. The Bigwigs of this week-end were quite a different lot from those of three weeks ago, and comparatively homogeneous, having only three different plans for settling the land question, none of which, fortunately, involved any more real disturbance of the existing state of things than the potato, brown-bread plan, for all were based on the belief held by the respectable press, and constructive portions of the community, that omelette can be made without breaking eggs. On one thing alone, the whole house party was agreed--the importance of the question. Indeed, a sincere conviction on this point was like the card one produces before one is admitted to certain functions. No one came to Becket without it; or, if he did, he begged, borrowed, or stole it the moment he smelled Clara's special pot-pourri in the hall; and, though he sometimes threw it out of the railway-carriage window in returning to town, there was nothing remarkable about that. The conversational debauch of the first night's dinner--and, alas! there were only two even at Becket during a week-end--had undoubtedly revealed the feeling, which had set in of late, that there was nothing really wrong with the condition of the agricultural laborer, the only trouble being that the unreasonable fellow did not stay on the land. It was believed that Henry Wiltram, in conjunction with Colonel Martlett, was on the point of promoting a policy for imposing penalties on those who attempted to leave it without good reason, such reason to be left to the discretion of impartial district boards, composed each of one laborer, one farmer, and one landowner, decision going by favor of majority. And though opinion was rather freely expressed that, since the voting would always be two to one against, this might trench on the liberty of the subject, many thought that the interests of the country were so much above this consideration that something of the sort would be found, after all, to be the best arrangement. The cruder early notions of resettling the land by fostering peasant proprietorship, with habitable houses and security of tenure, were already under a cloud, since it was more than suspected that they would interfere unduly with the game laws and other soundly vested interests. Mere <b>penalization</b> of those who (or whose fathers before them) had at great pains planted so much covert, enclosed so much common, and laid so much country down in grass was hardly a policy for statesmen. A section of the guests, and that perhaps strongest because most silent, distinctly favored this new departure of Henry Wiltram's. Coupled with his swinging corn tax, it was indubitably a stout platform.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Penalization</b> {{has several}} effects on inference, {{relative}} to a regular GLM.

The 4 rst contributors {{have introduced}} separable <b>penalizations</b> for line spectra (LS) recovering, whereas the latter have proposed circular Gibbs–Markov functions for smooth spectra (SS) restoration, and combined both contributions for estimation of “mixed” spectra (MS), i. e., frequency peaks superimposed on a homogeneous background (Ciuciu et al., 2001). Sacchi et al. resorted to the iteratively reweighted least squares (IRLS) algorithm for the minimization stage. Here, {{we show that}} IRLS is a block-coordinate descent (BCD) method performing the minimization of a half-quadratic (HQ) energy. The latter, derived from the Geman and Reynolds construction, has the same minimizer as the initial criterion but depends on more variables. After proving that such a construction is not available for Gibbs–Markov <b>penalizations,</b> we extend the pioneering work ofGeman and Yang (IEEE Trans. Image Process. 4 (7) (1995) 932) {{that leads to a}} suitable HQ energy for any kind ofpenalization encountered in Ciuciu et al. (2001). The BCD algorithm used for minimizing such HQ criteria is actually an original residual steepest descent (RSD) procedure (IEEE Trans. Acoust. Speech Signal Process.
