[...] This stand, like the terrace it replaced, is known for housing the club's most vocal supporters. [...] The Gordon Road Stand, which seats 2,600, was opened in 1997 and is opposite the Medway Stand. [...] Due to planning requirements, the stand had a height restriction placed upon it, making it significantly lower than the other three sides of the ground, and due to the road layout behind it is narrower at one end than the other.

40|$|Aims Several {{case reports}} have {{demonstrated}} negative interactions between various physiotherapy modalities and cardiac rhythm devices (CRD).

40|$|Objective: To describe, {{based on}} the {{perceptions}} of disabled workers and on the analyses of working activities, the requirements related to the work organization in ceramic industries and its association {{with the development of}} musculoskeletal disorders. Methods: An exploratory and qualitative study held in two distinct locations, a public <b>Physiotherapy</b> <b>facility</b> and a small size industry, both in Pedreira. Nine disabled workers diagnosed with Work Related Musculoskeletal Disorders (WRMD) participated in semi-structured interviews, which followed a guide question: “How is your work?”. The work activities from three active workers were analyzed based on ergonomics, following an observation guide. Results: The results highlighted the presence of factors that indicate that the model of work organization adopted by these industries is associated with WRMD. In the obtained reports, requirements of commitment with objectives and production goals, and fast work pace arouse in different moments. Conclusion: Fast work pace, production requirements, extended working hours and aspects related to the social work environment do not allow workers to adopt strategies to cope with risks, leading to the development of musculoskeletal disorders...|$|R

40|$|Back pain {{is one of}} {{the most}} common health {{problems}} in the world. The main focus of this thesis is specific exercises and treatment techniques to treat back pain. The first part describes the musculoskeletal system, muscle function, treatment techniques and exercises to treat back pain with the help of physiotherapy. Three <b>physiotherapy</b> and rehabilitation <b>facilities</b> in Jihlava, together with their clients with back pain, were chosen for this research. The main focus was the joint range mobility measurements, treating muscle dysbalances and providing clients specific exercises to stretch, to relax and improve their physical mobility in specific areas. The mobility measurements were done in two phases: during entrance and exit visits and the task was to identify how the specific exercises and treatment techniques relieve muscle dysbalances and back pain...|$|R
40|$|AbstractEvidence-based {{reasons for}} {{segregation}} of patients colonized with Pseudomonas aerugionsa in the outpatient setting are unclear. To clarify local decisions, Pseudomonas genotyping {{of the local}} environment, patients and patient contacts was undertaken in 1993. The hospital environment was re-swabbed in 1997. Pseudomonas genotyping {{of old and new}} patients attending the North Staffordshire cystic fibrosis clinic has subsequently been undertaken and more recently been repeated on an annual basis to assess whether the same Pseudomonas genotypes can be found in both the environment and in patients, and whether the same Pseudomonas genotype can be transferred from one patient to another. NoPseudomonas genotype found in the local environment in 1993 or in 1997 has been found in any of our patients. Nine children attending the same special school for many years and sharing the same <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>facilities</b> showed no evidence of cross-infectivity. Except for siblings living in the same household our cross-infectivity rate is very low and where cross-infection has potentially occurred the level of contact between these patients has been minimal. This study does not support the suggestion that patients with cystic fibrosis attending the North Staffordshire clinic and colonized with Pseudomonas aeruginosa should be segregated from non-colonized patients...|$|E
40|$|Background. Knowledge {{of stroke}} risk factors is {{expected}} to {{reduce the incidence of}} stroke—whether first-ever or recurrent. This study examined knowledge of stroke risk factors and its determinants among stroke survivors. Methods. A cross-sectional survey of consenting stroke survivors at two <b>physiotherapy</b> <b>facilities</b> in Nigeria was carried out. Sociodemographic and clinical data were obtained and knowledge of stroke risk factors (defined as the ability to mention at least one correct risk factor) was assessed using open-ended questionnaire. Data were treated with descriptive statistics and logistic regression analysis. Results. Sixty-nine stroke survivors (male = 72. 5 %; mean ± SD age = 49. 7 ± 10. 6 years) participated in the study. Thirty-four (49. 4 %) participants had knowledge of stroke risk factors. Only educational level was significantly associated with knowledge and participants with tertiary educational qualification were about 48 times (odds ratio = 48. 5; CI = 7. 6 – 309. 8; P< 0. 0001) more likely to be knowledgeable than those with no education. Conclusion. Less than half of the participants had knowledge of stroke risk factors. Participants with tertiary education were significantly more knowledgeable than those with lower educational qualifications. Effective means of educating stroke survivors on stroke risk factors should be identified and adopted...|$|E

40|$|At present, {{there is}} no {{validated}} patient-reported outcome measure (PROM) for patients with medial tibial stress syndrome (MTSS). Our aim was to select and validate previously generated items and create a valid, reliable and responsive PROM for patients with MTSS: the MTSS score. A prospective cohort study was performed in multiple sports medicine, <b>physiotherapy</b> and military <b>facilities</b> in the Netherlands. Participants with MTSS filled out the previously generated items for the MTSS score on 3 occasions. From previously generated items, we selected the best items. We assessed the MTSS score for its validity, reliability and responsiveness. The MTSS score was filled out by 133 participants with MTSS. Factor analysis showed the MTSS score to exhibit a single-factor structure with acceptable internal consistency (α= 0. 58) and good test-retest reliability (intraclass correlation coefficient= 0. 81). The MTSS score ranges from 0 to 10 points. The smallest detectable change in our sample was 0. 69 at the group level and 4. 80 at the individual level. Construct validity analysis showed significant moderate-to-large correlations (r= 0. 34 - 0. 52, p < 0. 01). Responsiveness of the MTSS score was confirmed by a significant relation with the global perceived effect scale (β=- 0. 288, R(2) = 0. 21, p < 0. 001). The MTSS score is a valid, reliable and responsive PROM to measure the severity of MTSS. It is designed to evaluate treatment outcomes in clinical studie...|$|R
