5000|$|The {{workpiece}} travels down {{a conveyor}} belt towards a paint booth, or paint tank, where it is sprayed with, or dipped into, electrostatically charged paint particles. Integrated into a <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> booth is a powder recovery unit, which recovers between 95% and 100% of the paint over-spray coatings. After the workpiece is coated, it continues on the conveyor belt to an oven, where the paint is cured. The benefits {{to the process of}} electrostatic coating is the ability to recover the little over-spray and having the process automated which will cut costs. The reason for the little over spray is the paint particles that do not hit the piece will turn in the air {{and go back to the}} piece. There are also some drawbacks to the process: everything in the area of the coating must be grounded to prevent static buildup and can easily arc, damaging the hanging devices and/or the locations where the hanging devices rest on the conveyor. All hangers, conveyors, etc. must be cleaned often to ensure a good ground and prevent anyone in the area from getting a severe shock. In an airborne system, any recesses on the piece that is being coated can be missed because the electrostatic paint is more attracted to corners and sharp edges; this means that another process for coating can be a better option if the piece has recesses. In the dipping process, air entrapment can occur in blind holes and deep recesses, so the positioning of the part as it enters the paint tank is critical in removing any trapped air that will restrict paint coverage.|$|E

40|$|Both color keyed {{and color}} {{specific}} liquid primers {{have been used}} successfully in automotive paint application, reducing the use of costly topcoat materials.

Application of color <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> primer would provide for additional cost savings, more environment-friendly manufacturing, and higher customer satisfaction. Recent technology breakthroughs have led to the technical feasibility of applying multicolor <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> with full reclaim and therefore 100 % material utilization. The field feasibility of applying multicolor <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> in an automotive manufacturing facility is being assessed and validated by GM. More specifically, GM has developed the GM Canister <b>Powder</b> <b>Paint</b> Delivery System to meet the challenges of color <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> application. In anticipation of multicolor <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> application, GM is completing its Manufacturing Systems Qualification (MSQ) Process for the Canister System. Due to the newness of the enabling technology, GM is investigating all aspects of materials, process designs, facilities, operations, and people, for the implementation of color keyed/color specific <b>powder</b> <b>paint</b> primer into new GM paint shops. Similar to GM's MSQ Process, qualification requirements in the pharmaceutical and medical device industry attest to the importance of validation in the implementation of new manufacturing technology. Beyond its technical purposes, validation can serve as a bridge between development and operation. During development, formal and relational contracts with(cont.) suppliers should be established to provide incentives for the supplier to perform throughout validation and commissioning. Involving the plant in validation along with suppliers is one means of education and thus empowerment, a key phase of organizational change as described by Professor Shoji Shiba. Leadership can use several change management techniques to help prepare the plant organization for operation of the new manufacturing technology. by Bevin Barberich. Thesis (S. M.)
