40|$|Summary. The {{increasing}} {{adoption of}} process-aware information systems (PAISs) {{has resulted in}} large process model collections. To support users having di↵erent perspectives on complex processes and related data, a PAIS should enable personalized process views, i. e., personalized abstractions of process models. Despite the abstraction achieved through views of the graphical process models, many end users still struggle with understanding these graphical models and their details. For selected user groups, therefore, a PAIS should provide verbalized <b>process</b> <b>descriptions</b> describing {{their role in the}} process. Existing PAISs neither provide mechanisms for managing process views nor verbalized <b>process</b> <b>descriptions.</b> While <b>process</b> views have been used as visual abstractions for large process models, so far no work exists on how to provide both personalized and verbalized <b>process</b> <b>descriptions</b> based on respective views. Hence, this paper presents an approach for creating personalized and verbalized <b>process</b> <b>descriptions</b> based on <b>process</b> views. Furthermore, textual changes of such a personalized and verbalized <b>process</b> <b>descriptions</b> are correctly mapped to corresponding updates of the underlying process model. In this context, all other views and <b>process</b> <b>descriptions</b> related to this process model are migrated to the new version of the process model as well. Overall, our approach enables end users to understand and evolve large process models based on personalized and verbalized <b>process</b> <b>descriptions.</b> Key words: <b>process</b> model abstraction, updatable process view, process change, natural language, process visualization, human-centered processe...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: Due to today’s {{increasingly}} complex processes {{in planning and}} design, knowledge management (KM) is becoming a crucial factor of success in the engineering sector. In a participatory design project we created a prototype for a process oriented KM system (CoLinK), which allows engineers to jointly model projects with generic <b>process</b> <b>descriptions,</b> creating a virtual engineering community within the enterprise and beyond. During every project these <b>process</b> <b>descriptions</b> will be augmented with knowledge annotations. The CoLinK system includes a document as well as contact management module and lets users semantically link the corresponding information in the process context. With any finished project engineers can utilize the acquired knowledge to cooperatively {{improve the quality of}} the generic <b>process</b> <b>descriptions...</b>|$|R

40|$|It is {{commonly}} known that software or system development processes {{are very important}} for getting a high-quality product. Such processes {{can be described in}} many different ways, from textual documents to existing modeling notations. Before dealing with the overall goal of improving the <b>description</b> of development <b>processes,</b> this paper evaluates the current state of practice regarding <b>process</b> <b>descriptions</b> and reasons for that. A major focus is on the degree of formality. Based on an interview guideline, a series of 12 interviews was conducted in German companies of different sizes. The results were analyzed {{to come up with the}} current usage of and need for software <b>process</b> models or <b>descriptions.</b> In general, our results confirm the literature statement that in industrial practice the majority of <b>processes</b> <b>descriptions</b> are detailed but rather focus on informal descriptions than formal notations or models. Nevertheless, they use semiformal <b>process</b> <b>descriptions</b> containing different graphical, table-based, or structured-text elements for representation. It is interesting that even if companies do not want to use formal models; they would like to have their advantages and even often have the detailed information necessary for formal models. Overall, our findings provide evidence on the state of practice regarding usage of <b>process</b> <b>descriptions</b> and models and show the need for future work in this area...|$|R

Very often, e. g. in {{the context}} of inter-organizational Workflow or web services, it is {{necessary}} to merge existing business <b>process</b> <b>descriptions.</b> It is clear that correctness criteria valid for the single <b>process</b> <b>descriptions</b> should remain valid also for the combined model.

In this paper various composition alternatives are summarized and their ability to preserve relaxed soundness (in contrast to soundness) is investigated. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Process {{models are}} often used to support the {{understanding}} and analysis of complex systems. The accuracy of such process models usually requires that various stakeholders review, evaluate, correct, and propose improvements to these models. Some stakeholders, however, {{may not have the}} skills to understand the process models except at a relatively superficial level. To address this issue, we have developed an approach for automatically generating natural-language <b>process</b> <b>descriptions</b> based on formal process models. Unlike existing electronic process guides, these <b>process</b> <b>descriptions</b> are generated completely automatically and can de-scribe complex process features, such as exception handling, concurrency, and non-deterministic choice. The generated <b>process</b> <b>descriptions</b> have been well-received by domain experts from several fields and have also proven useful to process programmers. We describe our template-based approach, the resulting hypertext representation, and report on a user study that compares the understandability of the generated textual de-scription and a diagrammatic process representation...|$|R

For this, workflow definitions as executable derivates of business <b>process</b> <b>descriptions</b> must be formulated {{in a formal}} specification language. For both- the less formal <b>descriptions</b> of business <b>processes</b> and the work-flow definitions- Petri net based approaches are widely used and well understood. In this paper, we study the process of deriving workflow definitions from less formal busi-ness <b>process</b> <b>descriptions</b> and even fragments of such descriptions and how to satisfy the correctness of these models among each other. ...|$|R
