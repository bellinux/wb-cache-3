The Human Development Index (HDI) is a composite index that measures the achievement of countries in three basic dimensions of human development-a long and healthy life, knowledge, and a decent standard of living. Uganda received a value of 0.446. The closer the number is to one, the better the country is in regards to human development. Norway is ranked at number one with a HDI of 0.943. The next variable that was taken into consideration is life expectancy at birth in years. Uganda's life expectancy is 54.1 years. The mean number of years in school is the average number of years of education received by people ages 25 and older. In Uganda the mean is only 4.7. Expected years of schooling is the number of years of schooling that a child of school entrance can expect to receive if prevailing patterns of age-specific enrollment rates persist throughout the child's life.

40|$|In Guadeloupe, Aedes aegypti {{mosquitoes}} are {{the only}} vectors of dengue and chikungunya viruses. For both diseases, vector control is the only tool for preventing epidemics since no vaccine or specific treatment is available. However, to efficiently implement control of mosquitoes vectors, a reliable estimation of the transmission risks is necessary. To become infective an Ae. aegypti female must ingest the virus during a blood meal {{and will not be}} able to transmit the virus during another blood-meal until the extrinsic incubation period is completed. Consequently the aged females will carry more infectious risks. The objectives of the present study were to estimate under controlled conditions the expectation of infective life for females and thus the transmission risks in relation with their reproductive cycle and parity status. Larvae of Ae. aegypti were collected in central Guadeloupe and breed under laboratory conditions until adult emergence. The experiments were performed at constant temperatures (Â± 1. 5 Â°C) of 24 Â°C, 27 Â°C and 30 Â°C on adults females from first generation (F 1). Females were kept and fed individually and records of blood-feeding, egg-laying and survival were done daily. Some females were dissected at different physiological stages to observe the ovaries development. The data were analyzed to follow the evolution of <b>parity</b> <b>rates,</b> the number of gonotrophic cycles, the fecundity and to study the mean expectation of life and the mean expectation of infective life for Ae. aegypti females according to temperatures. The expectation of life varies with the <b>parity</b> <b>rates</b> and according to the temperatures, with durations from about 10 days at low <b>parity</b> <b>rates</b> at the higher temperature to an optimal duration of about 35 days when 70 % of females are parous at 27 Â°C.

In spite of this situation, little recent entomological data are available from the main localities where the disease occurs, even though they are crucial for development of an effective vector control strategy. A longitudinal entomological survey was carried out from March 2000 -February 2002 in three Amerindian villages, namely TwenkÃ©, TaluÃ¨ne and CayodÃ©, located in the Amazonian forest of the Upper-Maroni area, to assess anopheline mosquitoes and malaria transmission dynamics. Anopheles darlingi (Diptera: Culicidae) was the most abundant mosquito species caught during the study. This efficient American malaria vector was active the entire year, but showed an evident peak of abundance during the main rainfall season, from April-June, with an average human biting rate of 255. 5 bites per person per night. <b>Parity</b> <b>rates</b> were homogeneous all year, indicating no significant seasonal variability in female survival rates. Estimated vectorial capacity indices were higher during the rainy season, even though the risk of transmission was present throughout the year (VCI > 1). A total of 14 An. darlingi were found infected with Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax or Plasmodium malariae. The annual circumsporozoite indices were 0. 15, 0. 14 and 0. 05, and the entomological inoculation rates were 22. 8, 27. 4 and 14. 4 infected bites per person per year in TwenkÃ©, TaluÃ¨ne and CayodÃ©, respectively.

In each sampling unit, plants were randomly selected for aspiration of mosquitoes. Only Aedes mcintoshi and Ae. ochraceus were dissected to determine <b>parity</b> <b>rates</b> while all mosquito species {{were used to assess}} plant resting preference. RESULTS : Overall, 1124 (79 %, 95 % CI = 76. 8 â€“ 81. 1 %) mosquitoes were parous. There {{was no significant difference in}} the number of parous Ae. mcintoshi and Ae. ochraceus. Parity was higher in the rainy season than in the dry season. Daily survival rate was estimated to be 0. 93 and 0. 92 among Ae. ochraceus and Ae. mcintoshi, respectively. Duosperma kilimandscharicum was the most preferred plant species with the highest average capture of primary (3. 64) and secondary (5. 83) vectors per plant, while Gisekia africana was least preferred. CONCLUSION : Survival rate of each of the two primary vectors of RVF reported in this study may provide an indication that these mosquitoes can potentially play important roles in the circulation of diseases in northern Kenya.

Anopheles punctipennis was the dominant species in landing collections conducted for 20 consecutive nights in August and September 1990. The mean <b>parity</b> <b>rate</b> of An. punctipennis was 0. 82. The gonotrophic cycle was estimated to last three days based on time series analysis of the number of nulliparous and parous mosquitoes collected each day. Survivorship was estimated to be 0. 79 per gonotrophic cycle and 0. 92 per day. Ovarian dilatation data indicated that some females had completed eight gonotrophic cycles prior to being collected and 45 % of the females completed two or more cycles. The high prevalence of multiparous individuals, high <b>parity</b> <b>rate,</b> long survivorship and a short three-day gonotrophic cycle estimate indicates that this population is long lived and has a capacity to be an efficient vector of malaria.
