Glanville was only the third <b>person</b> <b>employed</b> by the Department of Scientific and Industrial Research to undertake research work at the underfunded station which was established in April 1921. Glanville's first investigation at the Building Research Station (BRS) was to study how the water permeability of concrete varied and, with Duff Abrams, {{was one of the}} first to attribute this primarily to the water-cement ratio and not to the type and proportions of aggregate used. He also found that concrete became much more impermeable when cured by immersion in water, compared with the more popular air curing method. In 1925 the BRS moved to Garston near Watford.|$|E

500|$|The judge heard out the owners; after expressing initial reluctance, he {{took the}} job for seven years at a salary of $50,000, on {{condition}} he could remain on the federal bench. During Landis's time serving as both judge and commissioner, he allowed a $7,500 reduction in his salary as commissioner, to reflect his pay as judge. The appointment of Landis was met with acclaim in the press. [...] A tentative agreement was signed by the parties a month later—an agreement which itemized Landis's powers over baseball, and which was drafted by the judge. [...] The owners were {{still reeling from the}} perception that baseball was crooked, and accepted the agreement virtually without dissent. [...] Under the terms of the contract, Landis could not be dismissed by the team owners, have his pay reduced, or even be criticized by them in public. He also had nearly unlimited authority over every <b>person</b> <b>employed</b> in the major or minor leagues, from owners to batboys. [...] The owners waived any recourse to the courts to contest Landis's will. Humorist Will Rogers stated, [...] "on't kid yourself that that old judicial bird isn't going to make those baseball birds walk the chalkline". [...] Player and manager Leo Durocher later stated, [...] "The legend has been spread that the owners hired the Judge off the federal bench. Don't you believe it. They got him right out of Dickens." ...|$|E

2500|$|According to a 2015 Washington Free Beacon study, Clinton's senatorial office paid women 28 {{percent less}} than men {{who worked in the}} office on average {{throughout}} her time as a senator. Analysis was done using salaries paid to senatorial office staff from fiscal years 2002 to 2008. The study did not control for the level of jobs involved or any part-time or flexible work arrangements. Rejecting the Free Beacon analysis, in 2015 pro-Clinton forces gave to FactCheck.org what that organization called [...] "a list of the names, titles and annual salaries of every full-time <b>person</b> <b>employed</b> in Clinton’s Senate office between 2002 and 2008. Those data show the median salary for men and women to be the same at $40,000. The data also show Clinton hired roughly twice as many women as men." [...] The fact check concluded that both the Free Beacon and Clinton datasets and conclusions had some merit.|$|E

2500|$|A {{classic example}} of a single-blind test is the Pepsi Challenge. A tester, often a {{marketing}} person, prepares two sets of cups of cola labeled [...] "A" [...] and [...] "B". One set of cups is filled with Pepsi, while the other is filled with Coca-Cola. The tester knows which soda is in which cup but {{is not supposed to}} reveal that information to the subjects. Volunteer subjects are encouraged to try the two cups of soda and polled for which ones they prefer. One of the problems with a single-blind test like this is that the tester can unintentionally give subconscious cues which influence the subjects. In addition, it is possible the tester could intentionally introduce bias by preparing the separate sodas differently (e.g., by putting more ice in one cup or by pushing one cup closer to the subject). If the tester is a marketing <b>person</b> <b>employed</b> by the company which is producing the challenge, there's always the possibility of a conflict of interest where the marketing person is aware that future income will be {{based on the results of}} the test.|$|E
2500|$|In June 1835 Airy was {{appointed}} Astronomer Royal {{in succession to}} John Pond, and began his long career at the national observatory which constitutes his chief title to fame. The condition of the observatory {{at the time of}} his appointment was such that Lord Auckland, the first Lord of the Admiralty, considered that [...] "it ought to be cleared out," [...] while Airy admitted that [...] "it was in a queer state." [...] With his usual energy he set to work at once to reorganise the whole management. He remodelled the volumes of observations, put the library on a proper footing, mounted the new (Sheepshanks) equatorial and organised a new magnetic observatory. In 1847 an altazimuth was erected, designed by Airy to enable observations of the moon to be made not only on the meridian, but whenever it might be visible. In 1848 Airy invented the reflex zenith tube to replace the zenith sector previously employed. At the end of 1850 the great transit circle of 203mm (8inch) aperture and 3.5m (11ft 6in) focal length was erected, and is still the principal instrument of its class at the observatory. The mounting in 1859 of an equatorial of 330mm (13inch) aperture evoked the comment in his journal for that year, [...] "There is not now a single <b>person</b> <b>employed</b> or instrument used in the observatory which was there in Mr Pond's time"; and the transformation was completed by the inauguration of spectroscopic work in 1868 and of the photographic registration of sunspots in 1873.|$|E
