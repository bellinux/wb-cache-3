40|$|Arthrogryposis, Renal dysfunction, and Cholestasis (ARC) {{syndrome}} is a multisystem disorder associated with abnormal localisation of some <b>polarised</b> <b>membrane</b> transporter proteins. Distinct apical and basolateral poles {{are essential for}} epithelial function and organ development but the molecular pathways determining the biogenesis of <b>polarised</b> <b>membranes</b> are not fully characterised. Mutations in VPS 33 B, a Sec 1 -Munc 18 protein, account for 75 % of ARC patients. Reduced expression of VPS 33 B at both the RNA and protein level was demonstrated in all ARC syndrome patients, even if mutations were not identified in VPS 33 B. A novel protein POLARIN (PLRN) was identified that interacts with VPS 33 B, and is crucial for VPS 33 B function. Pathogenic mutations in PLRN occur in ARC patients without VPS 33 B mutations. Decreased Polarin and Vps 33 b expression in mouse renal collecting duct cells led to abnormal localisation of specific apical membrane proteins and to disordered apical junction complex formation. In an in vivo model, knockdown of polarin in zebrafish resulted in defects in biliary tract development. These findings establish that a VPS 33 B-POLARINRab 11 a intracellular trafficking pathway is functionally distinct from another VPS 33 -related pathway (VPS 33 A/VPS 16) and is required for (a) normal epithelial polarisation and apical junction complex formation, and (b) normal liver and kidney development and function.

40|$|The present work studied {{low-cost}} carbon {{sources for}} carotenoid and lipid production using the yeast Rhodosporidum toruloides NCYC 921. Carob pulp syrup and sugarcane molasses at different concentrations {{were used as}} low-cost carbon sources in R. toruloides batch cultivations. Carob pulp syrup containing a total sugar concentration of 75 g L 1 induced the highest total fatty acid productivity (1. 90 g L 1 h 1) and the highest carotenoid productivity (9. 79 lg L 1 h 1). Flow cytometric analysis revealed {{that most of the}} yeast cells (> 60 %) grown on carob pulp syrup displayed intact <b>polarised</b> <b>membranes,</b> conversely to the cells grown on sugarcane molasses, wherein a large proportion (> 45 %) displayed permeabilised cytoplasmic membranes...|$|R

Transport processes across the <b>polarised</b> <b>membrane</b> interfaces are of major importance in the functioning of the established mycorrhizal association as the symbiotic relation is based on a 'fair-trade' between fungus and host plant. Uptake and exchanges of nutrient and/or metabolites, at biotrophic interfaces are controlled by membrane transporters and their regulation patterns are essential in determining the outcome of plant fungal interactions and in adapting to changes in soil nutrient quantity and/or quality.

40|$|Abstract Background Cycloheximide is {{a protein}} {{synthesis}} inhibitor that acts {{specifically on the}} 60 S subunit of eukaryotic ribosomes. It has previously been shown that a short incubation of Dictyostelium discoideum amoebae in cycloheximide eliminates fluid phase endocytosis. Results We found that treatment with cycloheximide also causes the amoebae to retract their pseudopodia, round up and cease movement. Furthermore, fluid phase endocytosis, phagocytosis and capping cease {{in the presence of}} 2 mM cycloheximide, although membrane uptake, as measured using FM 1 - 43, is unaffected. In the presence of cycloheximide, aggregation-competent amoebae sensitive to cAMP, although round, can still localise CRAC, ABP 120, PI 3 K and actin polymerisation in response to a micropipette filled with cAMP. The behaviour of wild-type amoebae in the presence of cycloheximide is surprisingly similar to that of amoebae having a temperature-sensitive version of NSF at the restrictive temperature. Conclusion Our results may suggest that, upon cycloheximide treatment, either a labile protein required for <b>polarised</b> <b>membrane</b> recycling is lost, or a control mechanism linking protein synthesis to membrane recycling is activated. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{well known}} type of synapse between a {{presynaptic}} process containing vesicles and a "clear" postsynaptic {{process can be}} commonly observed in the various lobes of the brain of Octopus. The presynaptic vesicles are aggregated near regions of the synaptic membranes which show specialisation and asymmetric "thickening" indicating functional polarisation, and here chemical transmission is presumed to take place. In addition, in the vertical lobe a very interesting serial arrangement of synaptic contacts occurs. Presynaptic bags, formed from varicosities of fibres from the superior frontal lobe, contact the trunks of amacrine cells in the manner just described. The trunks, however, although apparently postsynaptic are themselves packed with synaptic vesicles. The trunks, in turn, make "presynaptic" contacts with clear spinous processes of other neurons of yet undetermined origin. Typical <b>polarised</b> <b>membrane</b> specialisations occur at the contact regions. The trunk vesicles aggregated closest to the contact regions have a shell of particles round their walls. At present, {{there is no way}} of telling whether the membrane conductance to the various ions is differently affected at either of the transmission sites, and, if an inhibitory mechanism is involved, whether it is of the presynaptic or postsynaptic variety...|$|R
40|$|AbstractHuntington's {{disease is}} characterised {{by the death}} of {{cortical}} and striatal neurons, and is the result of an expanded polyglutamine tract in the Huntingtin protein [1]. Huntingtin is present on both endocytic and secretory membrane organelles but its function is unclear [2, 3]. Rab GTPases regulate both of these transport pathways [4]. We have previously shown that Rab 8 controls <b>polarised</b> <b>membrane</b> transport by modulating cell morphogenesis [5]. To understand Rab 8 -mediated processes, we searched for Rab 8 -interacting proteins by the yeast two-hybrid system. Here, we report that Huntingtin is linked to the Rab 8 protein through FIP- 2, a tumour necrosis factor-α (TNF-α) -inducible coiled-coil protein related to the NEMO protein [6, 7]. The activated form of Rab 8 interacted with the amino-terminal region of FIP- 2, whereas dominant-negative Rab 8 did not. Huntingtin bound to the carboxy-terminal region of FIP- 2. Coexpressed FIP- 2 and Huntingtin enhanced the recruitment of Huntingtin to Rab 8 -positive vesicular structures, and FIP- 2 promoted cell polarisation in a similar way to Rab 8. We propose a model in which Huntingtin, together with FIP- 2 and Rab 8, are part of a protein network that regulates membrane trafficking and cellular morphogenesis...|$|R
40|$|The surface {{behaviour}} {{of swimming}} amoebae was followed in cells bearing a cAR 1 -paGFP (cyclic AMP receptor fused to a photoactivatable-GFP) construct. Sensitized amoebae {{were placed in}} a buoyant medium where they could swim toward a chemoattractant cAMP source. paGFP, activated at the cell's front, remained fairly stationary in the cell's frame as the cell advanced; the label was not swept rearwards. Similar experiments with chemotaxing cells attached to a substratum gave the same result. Furthermore, if the region around a lateral projection near a crawling cell's front is marked, the projection and the labelled cAR 1 behave differently. The label spreads by diffusion but otherwise remains stationary in the cell's frame; the lateral projection moves rearwards on the cell (remaining stationary {{with respect to the}} substrate), so that it ends up outside the labelled region. Furthermore, as cAR 1 -GFP cells move, they occasionally do so in a remarkably straight line; this suggests they do not need to snake to move on a substratum. Previously, we suggested that the surface membrane of a moving amoeba flows from front to rear as part of a <b>polarised</b> <b>membrane</b> trafficking cycle. This could explain how swimming amoebae are able to exert a force against the medium. Our present results indicate that, in amoebae, the suggested surface flow does not exist: this implies that they swim by shape changes...|$|R

40|$|This work {{discusses}} optimisation of the cryopreservation of Bacillus licheniformis cell banks, used as inoculum for α-amylase producing 5 L batch fermentations. The {{effect of}} the presence of various cryopreservants including glycerol, Tween 80 and dimethyl sulphoxide on final fermentation performance measured by biomass and α-amylase concentration was investigated using optical density, dry cell weight, colony forming units, and multi-parameter flow cytometry. The application of multi-parameter flow cytometry using the fluorophores DiBac_ 4 (3) and PI allowed real time viability measurements of individual microbial cells to be monitored before and after cryopreservation and during the fermentation process; viability here being defined as a cell having an intact and fully <b>polarised</b> cytoplasmic <b>membrane.</b> It was found that the concentration and type of cryopreservant used had a significant effect on microbial cell physiology and population heterogeneity during resuscitation recovery immediately after thawing. Cell banks prepared with Tween 80 were fastest to recover after freezing in comparison to cell banks prepared with dimethyl sulphoxide which showed the slowest growth rates. Interestingly cells preserved in glycerol recovered at a similar rate to cells frozen without cryopreservant. Despite different responses to the freezing process when each cell bank was used as inoculum for 5 L batch fermentations very little difference was noticed in overall process performance with respect to α-amylase production, growth rate and final biomass concentration.

40|$|Background: The {{differentiation}} of an extracellular matrix (ECM) at the apical side of epithelial cells implies massive <b>polarised</b> secretion and <b>membrane</b> trafficking. An epithelial cell is hence engaged in coordinating secretion and cell polarity for a correct and efficient ECM formation. Principal Findings: We {{are studying the}} molecular mechanisms that Drosophila tracheal and epidermal cells deploy to form their specific apical ECM during differentiation. In this work we demonstrate that the two genetically identified factors haunted and ghost are essential for polarity maintenance, membrane topology {{as well as for}} secretion of the tracheal luminal matrix and the cuticle. We show that they code for the Drosophila COPII vesicle-coating components Sec 23 and Sec 24, respectively, that organise vesicle transport from the ER to the Golgi apparatus. Conclusion: Taken together, epithelial differentiation during Drosophila embryogenesis is a concerted action of ECM formation, plasma membrane remodelling and maintenance of cell polarity that all three rely mainly, if not absolutely, on the canonical secretory pathway from the ER over the Golgi apparatus to the plasma membrane.
