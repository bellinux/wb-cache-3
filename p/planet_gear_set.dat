40|$|Comparing with {{fixed shaft}} gearbox, {{vibration}} properties {{of planetary gearbox}} are much more complicated. In a planetary gearbox, there are multiple vibration sources as several pairs of sun-planet gears and several pairs of ring-planet gears mesh simultaneously. In addition, the signal transmission path changes due to {{the rotation of the}} carrier. To facilitate fault detection of a planetary gearbox and avoid catastrophic consequences caused by gear failures, it is essential to understand the vibration properties of a planetary gearbox. This paper aims to simulate vibration signals and investigate vibration properties of a planetary <b>gear</b> <b>set</b> when there is a cracked tooth in a <b>planet</b> <b>gear.</b> Displacement signals of the sun <b>gear</b> and the <b>planet</b> <b>gear,</b> and resultant acceleration signals of the whole planetary <b>gear</b> <b>set</b> will be simulated and investigated.

Their compact and co-axial design and gear ratio make them {{preferable}} to counter-shaft gear drives. Planetary <b>gear</b> <b>sets</b> are complex, multi-mesh systems formed by multiple stages of <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> {{that are in}} mesh with a sun gear and a ring gear and they are held by a common carrier through needle bearings and planet pins.

40|$|Although {{planetary}} gears {{used in an}} industrial region have load equalizing mechanisms in order to equalize distributed loads on <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> each other, those mechanisms may be uneffective dynamically in some cases. In this report, the face bearing patterns, the load distributions on <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> and the dynamic loads on a sun gear in some types of {{planetary gears}} have been measured by strain gages {{in order to obtain}} an easy method of improving the dynamic characteristics of planetary gears.

40|$|A {{planetary}} gearbox {{is widely used}} in various rotating systems {{because it can be}} used as a speed reducer or increaser without change in direction of shaft while transferring great driving power. Despite many attempts it is still challenging to diagnose potential faults of the {{planetary gearbox}} because of multiple contacts and axis rotation of <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> resulting in complex vibration characteristics.

First, an in-depth study on the vibration characteristics of <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> is presented using the autocorrelation function of the vibration signal.

50|$|Torque {{multipliers}} typically employ an {{epicyclic gear}} train having {{one or more}} stages. Each stage of gearing multiplies the torque applied. In epicyclic gear systems, torque {{is applied to the}} input gear or ‘sun’ gear. A number of <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> are arranged around and engaged with this sun gear, and therefore rotate. The outside casing of the multiplier is also engaged with the <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> teeth, but is prevented from rotating by means of a reaction arm, causing the <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> to orbit around the sun <b>gear.</b> The <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> are held in a ‘planet carrier' which also holds the output drive shaft. As the <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> orbit around the sun gear, the carrier and the output shaft rotate together. Without the reaction arm to prevent rotation of the outer casing, the output shaft cannot apply torque.|$|R

40|$|Vibration {{monitoring}} {{is widely}} {{used to determine the}} condition of various mechanical systems. Traditionally a transducer is attached to the structure under investigation and the vibration signal recorded. This signal is then processed and the required information extracted from the signal. With epicyclic gearboxes this traditional approach is not advisable. This is in part {{due to the fact that}} the <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> rotate internally on a planet carrier. Special techniques are therefore required to extract a viable data signal from the measured vibration signal. These techniques require an additional post-processing step in which a compiled data signal is extracted from the measured data signal. This work investigates the possibility of mounting transducers internally on the rotating planet carrier. Mounting transducers at this location removes the relative motion seen in traditional measurement techniques. An epicyclic gearbox is modified to facilitate the internal mounting of the accelerometers. A number of implementation problems are highlighted and solutions to these problems are discussed. A large portion of the work is dedicated to implementing and qualifying the epicyclic time synchronous averaging technique which is traditionally used to evaluate epicyclic gearboxes. As this technique forms the basis to evaluate the data obtained from internal measurements, it is of fundamental importance that the technique is implemented correctly. It is shown that vibration data can be reliably measured internally, by means of accelerometers mounted on the planet carrier. The internally measured data is compared to data obtained by traditional techniques and shown to be equally adept in detecting deterioration of a <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> tooth. Simple condition indicators were used to compare the vibration data of the two techniques. It was seen that the data obtained from the internally mounted accelerometers was equally, and in certain cases, slightly more sensitive to <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> damage. This implies that the technique can be used successfully to evaluate epicyclic gearbox damage. There are a number of practical implementation problems that will limit the use of this technique. As the technology becomes available to transmit measured vibration signals wirelessly, the application of the internal measurement technique will become more viable. A preliminary investigation was also launched into the relationship between a planetary gearbox with a single <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> and one with multiple <b>planet</b> <b>gears.</b> It is illustrated that vibration data, measured from a gearbox containing a single <b>planet</b> <b>gear,</b> shows an increased sensitivity to <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> damage. Although a special test rig might be required, the increased sensitivity to damage can provide a method to test <b>planet</b> <b>gears</b> in critical applications such as aircraft gearboxes.

40|$|Results are {{presented}} {{from a new}} algorithm developed for separating the vibration signals from a planetary gear system into separate signals attributable to each <b>planet</b> <b>gear.</b> From the separate signals, time synchronous average signals are produced for each <b>planet</b> <b>gear</b> and for the sun gear meshing with each <b>planet</b> <b>gear.</b> Assessments of the individual <b>planet</b> and sun <b>gears</b> {{can be made from}} these new vibration signals. These new separated signals match very well with noise-free synthetic data with and without characteristics indicative of faults. In a 3 -planet system, distortions planted in synthetic signals are easily distinguished over a wide range of signal-to-noise (S/N) values. In an 8 -planet system, distortions are easily detected for high S/N with degradation at low S/N. Spectra from separated signals from vibration measurements made in flight on the transmissions of OH- 58 C and AH 1 S helicopters are consistent with what would be expected based upon the transmission geometries.
