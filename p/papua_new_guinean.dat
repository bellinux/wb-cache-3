40|$|<b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guineans</b> {{and mining}} have {{become synonymous with}} civil {{conflict}} and turmoil. Numerous works, mainly from the anthropological perspective, have documented the conflict-ridden industry and offered explanations {{for the development of}} community antagonism (see, eg, Filer 1990; Connell and Howitt 1991; Rumsey and Weiner 2001). However, the existing literature on mining is somewhat sparse {{when it comes to the}} participation of <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guineans</b> as employees in the mines. The major aim of this paper is to discuss local employment in <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> Guinea mines. It does so by examining some of the challenges and conflicts that <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guineans</b> have confronted since their first con-tact with mining in the late 1800 s as adventurers and assistants to their participation as full-fledged paid workers in the current period. A central theme of this paper is that, although they first embraced mining as an adventure, the inevitable imposition of a capitalistic mode of mining operation compelled them to render their labor for a wage. Like miners everywhere, this paper argues, many <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guineans</b> now view mining employment as “the only way ” rather than as one of many ways of making a living. Labor, Conflict, and Mining in Premodern <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> Guinea <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guineans</b> have had contact with the international mining industry since the late 1800 s. Colonial officials, planters, soldiers, and missionaries provided other major avenues of contact with westerners (West 1958; Waiko 1993, 34). However, early engagement of locals with independent expatriate miners took the form of casual laboring in iso-lated alluvial goldfields around the country. From about the late 1870 s...|$|R

The main discussion within the study is whether <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guineans</b> see education as a cargo cult, an investment or as an item for consumption? Some years ago European missionaries and settlers used to say that <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guineans</b> sought education simply as a ‘cargo cult’, but the study indicates reasons for modifying this view. The histories of education and higher education in <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> Guinea are briefly described, paying particular attention to the role of Goroka Teachers College in the area of secondary teacher education. The unequal distribution of resources between the constituent parts of the University of <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> Guinea is also discussed.

25|$|Analysis of genomes {{of modern}} humans {{show that they}} mated {{with at least two}} groups of Archaic humans: Neanderthals (more similar to those found in the Caucasus than those from the Altai region) and Denisovans. Approximately 4% of the DNA of non-African modern humans is shared with Neanderthals, {{suggesting}} interbreeding. Tests comparing the Denisova hominin genome with those of six modern humans – a ǃKung from South Africa, a Nigerian, a Frenchman, a <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinean,</b> a Bougainville Islander and a Han Chinese – showed that between 4% and 6% of the genome of Melanesians (represented by the <b>Papua</b> <b>New</b> <b>Guinean</b> and Bougainville Islander) derives from a Denisovan population; a later study puts the amount at 1.11% (with an additional contribution from some different and yet unknown ancestor). This DNA was possibly introduced during the early migration to Melanesia. These findings are in concordance with the results of other comparison tests which show a relative increase in allele sharing between the Denisovan and the Aboriginal Australian genome, compared to other Eurasians and African populations; however, it has been observed that Papuans, the population of Papua New Guinea, have more allele sharing than Aboriginal Australians.|$|E
