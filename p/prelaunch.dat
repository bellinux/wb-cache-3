25|$|Each {{propellant}} tank has a vent and relief valve at its forward end. This dual-function valve can be opened by {{ground support equipment}} for the vent function during <b>prelaunch</b> and can open during flight when the ullage (empty space) pressure of the liquid hydrogen tank reaches 38 psig (262 kPa) or the ullage pressure of the liquid oxygen tank reaches 25 psig (172 kPa).|$|E
25|$|The ET {{has five}} {{propellant}} umbilical valves that interface with orbiter umbilicals: {{two for the}} liquid oxygen tank and three for the liquid hydrogen tank. One of the liquid oxygen tank umbilical valves is for liquid oxygen, the other for gaseous oxygen. The liquid hydrogen tank umbilical has two valves for liquid and one for gas. The intermediate-diameter liquid hydrogen umbilical is a recirculation umbilical used only during the liquid hydrogen chill-down sequence during <b>prelaunch.</b>|$|E
25|$|Autonetics was the {{associate}} contractor for the Minuteman (MM) guidance system, {{which included the}} flight and <b>prelaunch</b> software. This software was programmed in assembly language into a D17 disk computer. TRW provided the guidance equations that Autonetics programmed and was also responsible for the verification of the flight software. When MM I became operational, the flight computer was the only digital computer in the system. The targeting was done at Strategic Air Command (SAC) Headquarters by the Operational Targeting Program developed by TRW to execute on an IBM 709 mainframe computer.|$|E

40|$|The {{success of}} the CD has (partly) been {{attributed}} {{to the ability of}} Sony, Philips and Matsushita to cooperate {{in the run-up to the}} DAD conference in 1981, where the technological standard was set. We model the situation leading up to the conference in a simple game with technological progress and the possibility of <b>prelaunching</b> a technology. We identify players' tradeos between <b>prelaunching</b> (which ends technological progress) and continued development (which involves the risk of being pre-empted). Contrasting outcomes with complete and incomplete information, we nd that there appeared to be considerable uncertainty about rivals' technological progress. ...|$|R
500|$|Before its planned February 21, 1967, launch, the Command Module {{interior}} {{caught fire}} and burned on January 27, 1967, during a pre-launch test on Launch Pad 34 at Cape Kennedy. All three men were asphyxiated. The fire's ignition source was never determined, but their deaths {{were attributed to}} a wide range of lethal hazards in the early [...] (CSM) design and conditions of the test, including: a pressurized 100% oxygen <b>prelaunch</b> atmosphere, many wiring and plumbing flaws, flammable materials used in the cockpit and in the astronauts' flight suits, and an inward-opening hatch which could not be opened quickly in an emergency, and could not be opened at all with full internal pressure.|$|E
500|$|Apollo {{ran from}} 1961 to 1972, {{with the first}} manned flight in 1968. It {{achieved}} its goal of manned lunar landing, despite the major setback of a 1967 Apollo 1 cabin fire that killed the entire crew during a <b>prelaunch</b> test. After the first landing, sufficient flight hardware remained for nine follow-on landings with a plan for extended lunar geological and astrophysical exploration. Budget cuts forced the cancellation of three of these. Five of the remaining six missions achieved successful landings, but the Apollo 13 landing was prevented by an oxygen tank explosion in transit to the Moon, which damaged the CSM's propulsion and life support. The crew returned to Earth safely by using the Lunar Module as a [...] "lifeboat" [...] for these functions. Apollo used Saturn family rockets as launch vehicles, which were also used for an Apollo Applications Program, which consisted of Skylab, a space station that supported three manned missions in 1973–74, and the Apollo–Soyuz Test Project, a joint Earth orbit mission with the Soviet Union in 1975.|$|E
2500|$|After STS-4, {{several hundred}} pounds were {{eliminated}} by deleting the anti-geyser line. This line paralleled the oxygen feed line, providing a circulation path for liquid oxygen. This reduces accumulation of gaseous {{oxygen in the}} feed line during <b>prelaunch</b> tanking (loading of the LOX). After propellant loading data from ground tests and the first few space shuttle missions were assessed, the anti-geyser line was removed for subsequent missions. The total length and diameter of the ET remain unchanged. The last SWT, flown on STS-7, weighed approximately [...] inert.|$|E

50|$|Although the <b>prelaunched</b> {{fuel for}} the ramjet negates one {{advantage}} of the Bussard design (collection of fuel as it moves through the interstellar medium) it retains the advantage of not having to accelerate {{the mass of the}} fuel and the mass of the rocket at the same time.|$|R
40|$|To be {{economically}} viable, the operations cost of launch vehicles must {{be reduced by}} {{an order of magnitude}} as compared to the Space Transportation System (STS). A summary of propulsion-related operations cost drivers derived from a two-year study of Shuttle ground operations is presented. Examples are given of the inordinate time and cost of launch operations caused by propulsion systems designs that did not adequately consider impacts on <b>prelaunching</b> processing. Typical of these cost drivers are those caused by central hydraulic systems, storable propellants, gimballed engines, multiple propellants, He and N 2 systems and purges, hard starts, high maintenance turbopumps, accessibility problems, and most significantly, the use of multiple, nonintegrated RCS, OMS, and main propulsion systems. Recovery and refurbishment of SRBs have resulted in expensive crash and salvage operations. Vehicle system designers are encouraged to be acutely aware of these cost drivers and to incorporate solutions (beginning with the design concepts) to avoid business as usual and costs as usual...|$|R

2500|$|The General Electric Company {{provides}} an Automatic Target Recognition Unit (ATRU) for the SLAM-ER that processes <b>prelaunch</b> and postlaunch targeting data, allows high speed video comparison (DSMAC), and enables the SLAM-ER {{to be used}} in a true [...] "fire and forget" [...] manner. It also includes a [...] "man-in-the-loop" [...] mode, where the pilot or weapons system officer can designate the point of impact precisely, even if the target has no distinguishing infrared signature. It can be launched and controlled by a variety of aircraft including the F/A-18 Hornet, F/A-18 Super Hornet, and P-3C Orion, {{as well as by the}} U.S. Air Force's F-15E Strike Eagle. Before the retirement of the S-3B Viking, it was also able to launch and control the SLAM-ER. The South Korean air force's version of the F-15E Strike Eagle, the F-15K Slam Eagle, has been capable of launching and controlling the SLAM-ER since 2006 in test exercises.|$|E

40|$|As {{mobile apps}} become more closely {{integrated}} into our everyday lives, mobile app interactions {{ought to be}} rapid and responsive. Unfortunately, even the basic primitive of launching a mobile app is sorrowfully sluggish: 20 seconds of delay is not uncommon even for very popular apps. We have designed and built FALCON to remedy slow app launch. FALCON uses contexts such as user location and temporal access patterns to predict app launches before they occur. FALCON then provides systems support for effective app-specific <b>prelaunching,</b> which can dramatically reduce perceived delay. FALCON uses novel features derived through extensive data analysis, and a novel cost-benefit learning algorithm that has strong predictive performance and low runtime overhead. Trace-based analysis shows that an average user saves around 6 secondsperappstartuptimewithdailyenergycost {{of no more than}} 2 % battery life, and on average gets content that is only 3 minutes old at launch without needing to wait for content to update. FALCON is implemented as an OS modification to the Windows Phone OS.
