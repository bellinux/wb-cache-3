He was also head of the Romanian delegation at the <b>Peace</b> <b>preliminaries</b> of Buftea, in 1918. The talks resulted in the Treaty of Bucharest of May, which consecrated Romania's defeat by the Central Powers. His actions at the time were later the subject of an epigram by Cincinat Pavelescu (Pavelescu expressed his belief that the treaty and Argetoianu's views on fiscal policies were to be the subject of scorn for future generations).|$|E
500|$|For Marlborough, though, {{time had}} run out. His {{strategic}} gains in 1711 made it virtually {{certain that the}} Allies would march on Paris the following year, but Harley {{had no intention of}} letting the war progress that far and risk jeopardising the favourable terms secured from the secret Anglo-French talks (based on the idea that PhilipV would remain on the Spanish throne) that had proceeded throughout the year. Marlborough had long had doubts about the Whig policy of [...] "No Peace without Spain", but he was reluctant to abandon his allies (including the Elector of Hanover, Anne's heir presumptive), and sided with the Whigs in opposing the <b>peace</b> <b>preliminaries.</b> Personal entreaties from the Queen (who had long tired of the war), failed to persuade the Duke. The Elector {{made it clear that he}} too was against the proposals, and publicly sided with the Whigs. Nevertheless, Anne remained resolute, and on 7 December 1711 (O.S.) she was able to announce that – [...] "notwithstanding those who delight in the arts of war" [...] – a sneer towards Marlborough – [...] "both time and place are appointed for opening the treaty of a general peace".|$|E

He was also present at the Battle of Wilhelmsthal in June 1762, and captured the castle of Waldeck the following month. After <b>peace</b> <b>preliminaries</b> were signed at Fontainebleau in November, he supervised the embarkation of British troops from Europe, returning to England in March.|$|E
5000|$|Many of {{the great}} Spanish realist writers of the 19th century worked at times in the costumbrista mode, {{especially}} {{at the start of}} their careers. Fernán Caballero (pen name of Cecilia Francisca Josefa Böhl de Faber) (1796-1877), for example, in the prose portions of her Cuentos y poesías populares andaluzas ("Popular Andalusian stories and poems", collected in 1859 from prior publication in magazines), writes within the genre, particularly in [...] "Una paz hecha sin preliminares, sin conferencias y sin notas diplomáticas" [...] ("A <b>peace</b> made without <b>preliminaries,</b> without conferences, and without diplomatic notes"), with its very specific setting in Chiclana de la Frontera. Pedro Antonio de Alarcón (1833-1891) issued a collection Cosas que fueron, bringing together 16 costumbrista articles.Andrés Soria sees José María de Pereda (1833-1906) as the most successful fusion of costumbrista scenes into proper novels, especially his portrayals of La Montaña, the mountainous regions of Cantabria. His Escenas montañesas (1864) is particularly in the costumbrista mode, with its mixture of urban, rural and seafaring scenes, and sections offering sketches of various milieus. Poet and novelist Antonio de Trueba (1819 or 1821-89) wrote squarely within the genre with Madrid por fuera and De flor en flor. Gustavo Adolfo Bécquer (1836-1870) portrayed Madrid, Seville, and Toledo. José María Gabriel y Galán (1870-1905), best known as a poet, also wrote costumbrista pieces about Salamanca. Armando Palacio Valdés (1853-1938) also essayed the genre in newspaper articles, collected in Aguas fuertes ("Strong waters", 1884). The writer and diplomat Ángel Ganivet (1865-98), seen by some as a precursor to the Generation of '98, wrote costumbrista scenes of Granada.|$|R
2500|$|Eugene took command on the Rhine in April 1734, but vastly outnumbered he {{was forced}} onto the defensive. In June Eugene set out to relieve Philippsburg, yet his former drive and energy was now gone. Accompanying Eugene was a young Frederick the Great, sent by his father to learn the art of war. Frederick gained {{considerable}} knowledge from Eugene, recalling in later life his great debt to his Austrian mentor, but the Prussian prince was aghast at Eugene's condition, writing later, [...] "his body was still there but his soul had gone." [...] Eugene conducted another cautious campaign in 1735, once again pursuing a sensible defensive strategy on limited resources; but his short-term memory was by now practically non-existent, and his political influence disappeared completely—Gundaker Starhemberg and Johann Christoph von Bartenstein now dominated the conference in his place. However, fortunately for Charles VI Fleury was determined to limit {{the scope of the}} war, and in October 1735 he granted generous <b>peace</b> <b>preliminaries</b> to the Emperor.|$|E
50|$|Four {{days later}} the sloop Flor de Mayo reached New Providence with {{a message from the}} {{governor}} of Cuba Luis de Unzaga, saying that <b>peace</b> <b>preliminaries</b> had been signed back in Europe and that the Bahamas were to be restored to British rule in exchange for East Florida.|$|E

50|$|Bertie entered Parliament as MP for Oxford in 1774 on the {{interest}} of his brother, the 4th Earl of Abingdon. A Tory {{like the rest of}} the family, he was noted in 1780 as an opposition member who rarely attended Parliament. Lord Abingdon was a supporter of the Shelburne Ministry, and made sure that Bertie was on hand to vote in support of the <b>peace</b> <b>preliminaries</b> to end the American Revolutionary War in February 1783. Bertie also went to sea again for the first time in almost twenty years: he briefly commanded HMS Fortitude in early 1783.|$|E
50|$|He was {{expert in}} public finance and spoke {{frequently}} in parliament {{in opposition to}} the war in America. Although a liberal on American policy, Hartley was a long-time friend of Lord Northand strongly disliked the Prime Minister, Shelburne. He supported the Coalition by voting against Shelburne's <b>peace</b> <b>preliminaries.</b> It was probably owing to his friendship with Benjamin Franklin, and to his consistent support of Lord Rockingham, that he was selected by the government to act as plenipotentiary in Paris, where, on 3 September 1783, he and Franklin drew up and signed the definitive treaty of peace between Great Britain and the United States.|$|E
50|$|He was {{ambassador}} at The Hague and Madrid, {{and distinguished}} himself by {{his opposition to}} Guizot. Drouyn de Lhuys served as Minister of Foreign Affairs from 1848 to 1849 in the first government of Odilon Barrot. In Barrot's second government, he was replaced by Alexis de Tocqueville, and was appointed ambassador to London. He returned briefly as foreign minister {{for a few days}} in January 1851, and then returned permanently in the summer of 1852, becoming the first foreign minister of the Second Empire. He resigned his post in 1855, during the Crimean War, when the <b>peace</b> <b>preliminaries</b> he had agreed to in consultation with the British and Austrians at Vienna were rejected by Napoleon III.|$|E
50|$|Ancram had {{followed}} his old commander Cumberland into politics, {{and with him}} supported Pitt and {{his opposition to the}} negotiations for the Treaty of Paris. While Ancram's political position was undermined in 1762 when his brother-in-law, Lord Holderness, sold off his interest in the borough of Richmond, Fox and Lord Shelburne were still at pains to persuade him to leave the House of Commons before the vote on the <b>peace</b> <b>preliminaries</b> without the interference of Cumberland. Ancram voted against the preliminaries on 9 December, having missed a message from Cumberland directing him not to do so; ultimately, he took the Chiltern Hundreds in 1763, having accepted, according to the Duke of Newcastle, £4,000 to do so.|$|E

50|$|Leclerc {{started his}} {{military}} career in 1791 during the French Revolution {{as one of}} the army volunteers of Seine-et-Oise and passed through the ranks of sous-lieutenant in the 12th Cavalry, then aide-de-camp to general Lapoype. He was made a captain and divisional chief of staff during the siege of Toulon, at which he first allied himself to Napoleon Bonaparte. Following the revolutionary success there, he campaigned along the Rhine. He began serving under Napoleon Bonaparte in the Alpine and Italian campaigns, fighting at Castiglione della Pescaia and Rivoli and rising to général de brigade in 1797. He was then charged with announcing to the French Directory the signature of the <b>peace</b> <b>preliminaries</b> at Leoben. Pauline Bonaparte was at this time receiving a large number of suitors, thus pressing her brother Napoleon Bonaparte to have her married off. On Leclerc's return, he accepted Bonaparte's offer of Pauline's hand in marriage and they married in 1797, having one child, Dermide, and occupying the Château de Montgobert.|$|E

5000|$|He was {{admitted}} to the Privy Council when the death of the Lord Chancellor's death left the post vacant with no candidate. Appointed one of the three commissioners of the Great Seal of England he was favourite for the post and, later allowed as Lord High Chancellor in January 1771; he was on the occasion raised to the peerage as Baron Apsley, in the County of Sussex. He was roundly abused in rhyme and doggerel by satirical writings of Whigs Lord Brougham and Lord Lyndhurst. The best they could say about him was that he was [...] "not disagreeable", but ridiculed his ability at the bar, and mocked a Tory as incompetent. In January 1774 he was instrumental in writing the Intolerable Acts which he supported in parliament and the courts, most notably the Boston Port Act which gave rise to the Boston Tea Party and revolution. The judge was not a war-monger nor had he any experience of soldiering; but perception was political. In 1777 after the American Frigates had defeated once or twice, Bathurst worried that Great Britain might lose her control of the coast line urged <b>peace</b> <b>preliminaries</b> in order to save the colonies in the West Indies. He was a personal friend of Admiral William Howe, who was known to him since boyhood. Having succeeded his father as second Earl Bathurst in September 1775, he resigned his office somewhat unwillingly in July 1778 to enable Lord Thurlow to join the cabinet of Lord North. In November 1779 he was appointed Lord President of the Council, and left office with North in March 1782.|$|E
