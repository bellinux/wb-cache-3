5|$|In 1936, local {{businessman}} Leonard P. Thompson {{threatened to}} lead a breakaway from the amateur club to create an entirely separate professional club, Ipswich United. John Murray Cobbold, the club <b>President,</b> <b>called</b> together rival factions for {{a meeting at the}} Town Hall on 1 May 1936, at which it was agreed that Ipswich Town should turn professional. The club was unanimously elected to the Southern League for the 1936–37 season and former Irish international footballer Mick O'Brien was appointed as the club's first professional manager.|$|E

25|$|Disappointed {{with the}} court's conclusions, Schley appealed {{his case to}} President Theodore Roosevelt. The <b>president</b> <b>called</b> {{for an end to}} all public disputes. Tensions died down temporarily, but arose after the {{publication}} of Secretary Long’s personal memoir, in which the former secretary of the navy credited Sampson fully and believed that Schley contributed little to the battle's outcome. Sampson died in 1902 and Schley in 1911, but the controversy left an internecine struggle within the Navy that, in some ways, tarnished the Navy’s image after what had otherwise seemed a glorious naval victory.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} main Confederate army was marching through Pennsylvania, Lincoln {{was unable to}} give Meade more firepower. The vast {{majority}} of the 700,000 Federal soldiers (except for Grant's 70,000 near Vicksburg) were noncombatants, held static defensive posts that Lincoln feared to uncover, or like Rosecrans at Nashville, they were afraid to move. Urgently the <b>President</b> <b>called</b> for 100,000 civilian militiamen to turn out for the emergency; being unorganized, untrained, unequipped and poorly led, they were more trouble than they were worth. When the battle began they broke and ran away.|$|E
25|$|Yeltsin's December 1992 {{compromise}} with the seventh Congress of the People's Deputies temporarily backfired. Early 1993 saw increasing tension between Yeltsin and the parliament over {{the language of the}} referendum and power sharing. In a series of collisions over policy, the congress whittled away the president's extraordinary powers, which it had granted him in late 1991. The legislature, marshaled by Speaker Ruslan Khasbulatov, began to sense that it could block and even defeat the president. The tactic that it adopted was gradually to erode presidential control over the government. In response, the <b>president</b> <b>called</b> a referendum on a constitution for April11.|$|E

25|$|By {{the evening}} of 18 December, most of Goa had been overrun by {{advancing}} Indian forces, and a large party {{of more than two}} thousand Portuguese soldiers had taken position at the military base at Alparqueiros {{at the entrance to the}} port town of Vasco da Gama. Per the Portuguese strategy code named Plano Sentinela the defending forces were to make their last stand at the harbour, holding out against the Indians until Portuguese naval reinforcements could arrive. Orders delivered from the Portuguese <b>President</b> <b>called</b> for a scorched earth policy—that Goa was to be destroyed before it was given up to the Indians.|$|E
25|$|The 1991 {{death of}} John McNalley {{at the station}} {{triggered}} an investigation into whether {{it could have been}} prevented. McNalley, in his 50s, had been reported as having difficulties as the train passed the Burnside Avenue station, six stops south. The train continued north; transit police were notified of the situation at Fordham Road. By the time paramedics were able to reach McNalley he had died from cardiac arrest. Transit police officers claimed that their calls to the Metropolitan Transportation Authority command center urging the train to be stopped were ignored. Their union <b>president</b> <b>called</b> for police to be given the authority to order a train stopped in an emergency.|$|E
25|$|Wilson's {{remarriage}} rejuvenated {{his personal}} aspirations for re-election. Edith Wilson enjoyed, as Ellen never had, {{the crowds and}} the power as a close collaborator with her husband. Executive decisions {{just prior to the}} campaign also enabled Wilson to bolster his political mastery. He was presented with a vacancy on the Supreme Court, which he succeeded in filling with a controversial nominee, Louis Brandeis, the first Jewish member of the court. Also, in the summer of 1916 the nation's economy was endangered by a railroad strike. The <b>president</b> <b>called</b> the parties to a White House summit in August—after two days and no results, Wilson proceeded to settle the issue, using the maximum eight-hour work day as the linchpin. Once the Congress passed the Adamson bill incorporating the president's proposal, the strike was cancelled. Wilson was praised for averting a national economic disaster, though the law was received with howls from conservatives denouncing a sellout to the unions and a surrender by Congress to an imperious president.|$|E

500|$|The {{dismissal}} of General Douglas MacArthur {{was among the}} least politically popular decisions in presidential history. Truman's approval ratings plummeted, and he faced calls for his impeachment from, among others, Senator Robert A. Taft. Fierce criticism from virtually all quarters accused Truman of refusing to shoulder the blame for a war gone sour and blaming his generals instead. Others, including Eleanor Roosevelt, supported and applauded Truman's decision. MacArthur meanwhile returned to the U.S. to a hero's welcome, and addressed {{a joint session of}} Congress, a speech the <b>President</b> <b>called</b> [...] "a bunch of damn bullshit." ...|$|E

Saban [...] "possesses the sort of personality and character that is of great value in work with young men", the president said. Saban was 28 {{years old at the}} time, and the appointment {{made him one of the}} youngest college head coaches in the country.

500|$|In January 1906, Morton, as league <b>president,</b> <b>called</b> {{a meeting}} of the Ohio–Pennsylvania League. [...] According to Sporting Life, representatives of the clubs were {{scheduled}} to meet at Zanesville's Hotel Rogge on January 16. [...] "Assurances have been received that representatives from Akron, Youngstown, Zanesville, Newark, Lancaster, Mansfield, New Castle, East Liverpool, Steubenville and Erie, Pa., will be present", the paper reported, [...] "and from there an eight or ten club circuit will probably be formed, with McKeesport, Butler and Ashtabula as applicants also". [...] (The league eventually formed an eight-team circuit that included teams from Akron, Lancaster, Mansfield, Newark, New Castle, Sharon, Youngstown and Zanesville.) [...] The paper also noted that William J. Maloney, the center fielder for the Ohio Works club during the previous season, would sign a contract and serve as team captain. [...] Among others, Hogan announced the [...] "engagement" [...] of Utah-born pitcher Roy Castleton. [...] The Ohio Works team opened the 1906 season with 16 players, three of whom {{had been part of the}} club during the 1905 season. [...] According to Sporting Life, Hogan predicted the club would win the pennant at the close of the upcoming season. [...] He expressed confidence in a lineup that included Maloney of Bradford, Kentucky; Will M. Thomas of Morristown, Pennsylvania; Tommy Thomas of Piqua, Ohio; Fohl of Allegheny, Pennsylvania; Schettler of Pittsburgh; [...] "Dotty" [...] Freck of Columbus, Ohio; A. C. McClintock of Columbus; Castleton of Salt Lake City; Lewis Groh of Rochester, New York; John Kennedy of Youngstown, Charles Crouse of Detroit; Roy Chase of Andover, Ohio; Forrester J. Dressner of Garrettsville, Pennsylvania; Schwartz of Cleveland; and Roy Gould of Middlesex, Pennsylvania. [...] Indeed, in 1906, the Ohio Works team took the league championship once again, with an 8453 record, while new player Roy Castleton gained national recognition by pitching a perfect game against a rival club in Akron. [...] On October 1, 1906, Hogan and members of the Ohio Works team were honored at a banquet held at the Elks' Club in downtown Youngstown. [...] Sporting Life reported that the keynote address was delivered by Father M. T. Kinkead, [...] "who declared himself a fan of Sunday baseball playing". [...] The article added that Hogan [...] "was presented with a ring and each player was given a pair of gold cuff link inscribed 'O. & P. Champs 1906'". [...] On October 6, 1906, Sporting Life summarized the league's most recent season, reporting that the Ohio Works team had [...] "held the lead continually after the first months of the season and at one time threatened a walkover".|$|E
