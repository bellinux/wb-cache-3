40|$|In today 2 ̆ 7 s {{computer}} paper printing, {{cross and}} edge perforations are done only by mechanical perforators. The mechanical perforation process works fine since {{the width of}} the bridges and the length of the holes to be perforated remain large. Concerned with improvements in quality, printers have introduced microperforations. The holes and bridges of the <b>perforation</b> <b>pattern</b> are so small that after the user has torn off the sheet of computer paper along the <b>perforation</b> <b>pattern,</b> the edges of the document are very smooth and clean. Unfortunately, microperforations are reaching the limits of what can be achieved by the mechanical perforators. Because of the physical contact between the perforating tool and the paper, the <b>perforation</b> <b>pattern</b> is damaged. The tensile strength of the microperforation pattern decreases significantly and the paper often jams in the computer printers. Mechanical perforator dies wear and may even break. Therefore, holes are incompletely perforated or missing, so that the document is likely to be damaged when it is torn off along the <b>perforation</b> <b>pattern</b> by the user. Incomplete or missing perforations increases the tensile strength of the <b>perforation</b> <b>pattern.</b> Therefore, the printer can increase the quality of a <b>perforation</b> <b>pattern</b> by reducing its variability in tensile strength. This thesis studies the perforation of computer paper by laser beam. It is demonstrated through a microscopic study that laser perforations are free of all the defects which are inherent to the mechanical perforation process. It has been found that laser perforated holes remain open while mechanically perforated holes close back just after being perforated. The tests which have been carried out show that using a laser instead of a mechanical perforator to do microperforations reduces the variability in the tensile strength from 0. 694 kilograms to 0. 0751 kilograms. This improvement is significant. However, using a laser instead of a mechanical perforator to do large-size perforations reduces the variability in tensile strength only from 0. 0421 kilograms to 0. 0338 kilograms. This improvement is not significant. A mathematical model expressing the relationship between the tensile strength of a <b>perforation</b> <b>pattern,</b> {{the width of the}} bridges, and the number of bridges per inch has been established. The correlation found between the model and the experimental values is high (r = 0. 98). This mathematical model is a simple method which allows the printer to adjust the tensile strength of a laser <b>perforation</b> <b>pattern</b> to the desired value. This model requires only simple calculations, and the knowledge of one basic characteristic - the tensile strength of the paper. As a conclusion, the laser beam is a very valuable tool which can achieve very high quality microperforations on computer paper. However, it seems not worth using a laser to do large-size perforations on computer paper since the decrease in tensile strength variability over the mechanical perforation process is not significant. The fact that laser perforated holes remain wide open could improve high speed folding and piling in the press deliveries by allowing the air trapped between the sheets of computer paper to escape through the perforated holes. This property has also already found an interesting application for cigarette filter paper...|$|E

It is a displacement-based device in which energy is dissipated through plastic shear deformation of its perforated diaphragm plate.

40|$|A general {{wellbore}} flow model, which incorporates {{not only}} frictional, accelerational and gravitational pressure drops, {{but also the}} pressure drop caused by inflow, is presented in this report. The new wellbore model is readily applicable to any wellbore <b>perforation</b> <b>patterns</b> and well completions, and can be easily incorporated in reservoir simulators or analytical reservoir inflow models. Three dimensionless numbers, the accelerational to frictional pressure gradient ratio R{sub af}, the gravitational to frictional pressure gradient ratio R{sub gf}, and the inflow-directional to accelerational pressure gradient ratio R{sub da}, have been introduced to quantitatively describe {{the relative importance of}} different pressure gradient components. For fluid flow in a production well, it is expected that there may exist up to three different regions of the wellbore: the laminar flow region, the partially-developed turbulent flow region, and the fully-developed turbulent flow region. The laminar flow region is located near the well toe, the partially-turbulent flow region lies {{in the middle of the}} wellbore, while the fully-developed turbulent flow region is at the downstream end or the heel of the wellbore. Length of each region depends on fluid properties, wellbore geometry and flow rate. As the distance from the well toe increases, flow rate in the wellbore increases and the ratios R{sub af} and R{sub da} decrease. Consequently accelerational and inflow-directional pressure drops have the greatest impact in the toe region of the wellbore. Near the well heel the local wellbore flow rate becomes large and close to the total well production rate, here R{sub af} and R{sub da} are small, therefore, both the accelerational and inflow-directional pressure drops can be neglected...|$|R

Basically, sand production must be {{the results of a}} change in strength of the formation rock due to drilling, perforation and production operation and drag forces of the produced fluids. Therefore, during designing and developing stages, parameters related to sand production need to be examined carefully. This paper presents an experimental study of the effects of wellbore geometry and flow rate to sand production and total oil recovery; to minimize sand production as well as optimize production. The experimental works include of static and dynamic sand production tests, which were carried out on wellbore models with different wellbore angle, perforation shot density; and <b>perforation</b> <b>pattern</b> and flow rate using Servo Control Compression Testing Machine (SCCTM). The results show that oil production is reduced as sand production increases and most of produced sand are large size indicating the dominant effects of the breakage of cementing materials. Sand production increase significantly after effective stress reaches 35 - 60 % of rock compressive strength and followed by the reduction of total oil recovery to 55 - 73 %.

Therefore, in order to optimize production, sand production must be minized by reducing wellbore angle (< 10 o); shot density, flow rate (< 1600 cc/h), perforated with spiral pattern and pore pressure should be controlled so that effective stress around a wellbore is not more than 35 % of rock compressive strength...|$|E

40|$|Perforated {{tubes are}} widely used in {{industry}} for various applications. A special application arises when there is fluid injection into the perforated tube. Such cases arise when perforated tubes are used for horizontal oil well drilling and French drains. The behaviour of the flow under these conditions {{has led to the}} development of correlations, which consider the effects of the perforations and injection process. However, there are few friction factor correlations in literature, which consider the increased kinetic energy at the perforated tube outlet caused by fluid injection and acceleration. The current study reports experimental correlations for determining the friction factor of perforated tubes when the additional kinetic energy from the injection process is considered. The friction factor measurements were conducted in copper tubes with an internal diameter of 20. 8 mm and a wall thickness of 1 mm at three nondimensional pitches of 0. 375, 0. 75 and 1. 5. A perforated length-to-diameter ratio of 40 : 1 was used for the perforated tubes. A perforation row contained seven small perforation holes with a diameter of 1. 5 mm spaced evenly around the perimeter of the tube. These perforation rows were staggered row to row, resulting in triangular <b>perforation</b> <b>patterns.</b> Water was used as a test medium with Reynolds numbers at the tube outlet ranging from 20 000 to 60 000.

SSP ribbon material, which has grain sizes between 10 and 200 #mu#m, {{has been used for}} ribbon solar cell processing resulting in conversion efficiencies of up to 5. 4 %. LBIC measurements show a strong lateral inhomogeneity of the material quality. An additional surface melting step prior to solar cell processing improved the efficiency to 9. 1 %. This improvement can be explained with a slightly increased grain size combined with a reduction of the dislocation density. A further increasing of the grain size has been realised using one of our crystalline silicon thin film (CSiTF) solar cell concepts. This includes a perforated SiO_ 2 intermediate layer with a silicon layer on top which has been recrystallized by large area melting. The resulting grain structure reveals grains with up to several mm in size depending on the distance between the holes in the SiO_ 2 layer. This thin silicon layer acts as seeding layer for the following epitaxial growth of the active silicon layer. An additional advantage of using an SiO_ 2 intermediate layer is to reduce the diffusion of impurities into the active silicon layer if a low purity substrate is used. On low purity substrates CSiTF solar cells with a perforated SiO_ 2 intermediate layer and a recrystallized silicon seeding layer reached conversion efficiencies of up to 8. 6 %. Several solar cells with different <b>perforation</b> <b>patterns</b> of the intermediate SiO_ 2 layer have been manufactured on different kinds of high purity substrates (CZ, mc-Si, SSP).

40|$|Aluminium plates {{containing}} a single hole or multiple holes {{in a row}} are recently becoming very popular among architects and consultant engineers in many constructional applications, due to their reduced weight, as well as facilitating ventilation and light penetration of the buildings. However, there are still uncertainties concerning their structural behaviour, preventing them from wider utilization. In the present paper, local buckling phenomenon of perforated aluminium plates has been studied using the finite element method. For {{the purposes of the}} research work, plates with simply supported edges in the out-of-plane direction and subjected to uniaxial compression are examined. In view of perforations, circular cut-outs and the total cut-out size has been varied between 5 and 40 % of the total plate area. Moreover, different <b>perforation</b> <b>patterns</b> have been investigated, from a single, central cut-out to a more refined pattern consisting of up to 25 holes equally distributed over the plate. Regarding the material characteristics, several aluminium alloys are considered and compared to steel grade A 36 on plates of different slenderness. For each case the critical (Euler) buckling load and the ultimate resistance has been determined. A study into the boundary conditions of the plate showed that the restrictions at the edges parallel to the load direction have a large influence on the critical buckling load. Restraining the top or bottom edge does not significantly influence the resistance of the plate. The results showed that the ultimate resistance of aluminium plates containing multiple holes occurs at considerably larger out-of-plane displacement as that of full plates. For very large total cut-out, a plate {{containing a}} central hole has a larger resistance than a plate with equal cut-out percentage but with multiple holes.

In those events when sand production is a certainty, it is necessary to evaluate the performance of sand control methods to be used. A finite difference flow model was used to calculate the additional pressure drop from the well boundary to the sand control screen. The Forchheimer equation was used in place of the more conservative Darcy equation so that the effect of high-velocity flow to the well performance could be considered. The result of several sample runs indicated firm relationship between total additional pressure drop and the flow rate imposed, where a larger flow rate will cause greater pressure loss. Also, the well productivity showed improvement with more shots per foot. The result suggested that the majority of well pressure drop was caused by the casing-cement tunnel...|$|E
40|$|N wide spread beams with {{hexagonal}} openings, {{the stress}} concentration level is rather high. Aiming {{to reduce the}} stress level by means of rounding corner openings brings to introduction of beams with sinusoidal perforation (BSP). However, the studies of stress level in such beams depending on perforation parameters are not known. Development of empirical relation for estimation of stress level in castellated beams with sinusoidal perforation was fulfilled {{on the base of}} analysis of the results of BSP calculation by the finite element method. Results of study have allowed to establish the empirical relation for estimation of distribution regularities of equivalent stresses on Mises in castellated beams with sinusoidal perforation useful for engineering calculations. The established relation differentiates the role of every force factor: transverse force V and constant bending moment M. Calculation of hinged beams are performed under action of one pointed load applied in the mid-span and also under simple bending. The developed relation allows to determine the level of stress build-up in perforated double-tee beams with sinusoidal openings under constant transverse force V and constant bending moment M. Application of established relation to calculation of stresses in beams with the same <b>perforation</b> <b>pattern</b> was verified when varying the height of openings. The value of rounding corner radius remained unchanged. FEM calculations have shown that under constant transverse force and lineally changing bending moment, the maximum values of equivalent stresses on Mises near the contour of openings along the beam length are also changing lineally. The obtained empirical relation, in spite of its simplicity, allows to estimate the level and stress buildup in the openings zone under constant transverse force and simple bending depending on parameters of beam perforation...|$|E
40|$|During {{the second}} half of the 20 th century, {{numerous}} land drainage systems using new materials for the drain channels that often function inadequately due to biochemical and mechanical clogging, were developed. The design of drainpipes and envelope materials used for these land drainage systems was based on both theoretical and experimental investigations. This contribution reviews the simultaneous development of theory and practical experience in Europe and North America. The results of the effect of <b>perforation</b> shape and <b>pattern</b> in drainpipes and of envelope materials on drainage performance are summarized and the latest design criteria of granular materials and synthetic envelopes presented. Theoretical investigations are associated with field data on the performance of drainage materials. A thorough knowledge, not only of the flow conditions, but also of the physical soil properties in the vicinity of the drains is imperative for a correct interpretation of field data. This contribution represents the main features on drainpipes and envelope materials, and the physical soil processes that occur in the vicinity of the drain. It gives an overview of the research work done referring to numerous publications where relevant and detailed information can be found...|$|R
40|$|Sandwich-based {{structures}} play a {{major role}} in several transport applications due to their high stiffness and strength-to-weight ratios. Some properties of cork agglomerates suggest that this natural material may represent an excellent candidate when implemented as the core of sandwich components such as the ones typically adopted in aircraft interiors. However, one major drawback still resides in their higher density values in comparison to other lightweight benchmark materials. In order to address this issue, a perforated structural concept is herein presented for the cork agglomerate core as part of a weight minimization strategy. The aim of this investigation consists in assessing the influence of several core design variables, including the cells&# 039; geometry, <b>perforation</b> ratio and <b>pattern,</b> with regard to the impact on the components&# 039; overall mechanical stiffness and damping performance. The design process was supported by numerical simulations carried out with the ABAQUS® FEM tool and validated via experimental testing characterization. Results showed that distinct optimized cellular topologies can be derived with improved properties tailored for the functional requirements of specific components, thus confirming the validity of such cork-based composites in aircraft structural applications...|$|R
40|$|Since 1991, {{excavations}} at Blombos Cave {{have yielded}} a well-preserved sample of faunal and cultural material in Middle Stone Age (MSA) levels. The uppermost MSA phase, M 1, is dated to c. 75 ka by {{optically stimulated luminescence}} (OSL) and thermoluminescence, and the middle M 2 phase to a provisional c. 78 ka. Artefacts unusual in a MSA context from these phases include bifacial points, bone tools, engraved ochre and engraved bone. In this paper, we describe forty-one marine tick shell beads recovered from these MSA phases and tick shell beads from Later Stone Age (LSA) levels at Blombos Cave and the Die Kelders site. Thirty-nine shell beads come from the upper M 1 phase and two from M 2. Morphometric, taphonomic and microscopic analysis of modern assemblages of living and dead tick shell demonstrate {{that the presence of}} perforated Nassarius kraussianus shells in the Blombos MSA levels cannot be due to natural processes or accidental transport by humans. The types of perforation seen on the MSA shells are absent on modern accumulations of dead shells and not attributable to post-depositional damage. Their location, size, and microscopic features are similar to those obtained experimentally by piercing the shell wall, through the aperture, with a sharp bone point. Use-wear, recorded on the perforation edge, the outer lip, and the parietal wall of the aperture indicates the shells having being strung and worn. MSA shell beads differ significantly in size, <b>perforation</b> type, wear <b>pattern</b> and shade compared to LSA beads and this eliminates the possibility of mixing across respectiv...|$|R
