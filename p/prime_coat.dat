5000|$|Apply {{investment}} materials: The ceramic mould, {{known as}} the investment, is produced by repeating a series of steps—coating, stuccoing, and hardening—until a desired thickness is achieved. Coating involves dipping a pattern cluster into a slurry of fine refractory material and then draining to create a uniform surface coating. Fine materials are used in this first step, also called a <b>prime</b> <b>coat,</b> to preserve fine details from the mould. Stuccoing applies coarse ceramic particles by dipping patterns into a fluidised bed, placing it in a rainfall-sander, or by applying materials by hand. Hardening allows coatings to cure. These steps are repeated until the investment reaches its required thickness—usually 5 to 15 mm. Investment moulds are left to dry completely, which can take 16 to 48 hours. Drying can be accelerated by applying a vacuum or minimizing environmental humidity. Investment moulds can also be created by placing the pattern clusters into a flask and then pouring liquid investment material from above. The flask is then vibrated to allow entrapped air to escape and help the investment material fill any small voids. [...] Common refractory materials used to create the investments are: silica, zircon, various aluminium silicates, and alumina. Silica is usually used in the fused silica form, but sometimes quartz is used because it is less expensive. Aluminium silicates are a mixture of alumina and silica, where commonly used mixtures have an alumina content from 42 to 72%; at 72% alumina the compound is known as mullite. During the primary coat(s), zircon-based refractories are commonly used, because zirconium {{is less likely to}} react with the molten metal. Prior to silica, a mixture of plaster and ground up old molds (chamotte) was used. The binders used to hold the refractory material in place include: ethyl silicate (alcohol-based and chemically set), colloidal silica (water-based, also known as silica sol, set by drying), sodium silicate, and a hybrid of these controlled for pH and viscosity.|$|E

40|$|At present German policy envisages {{interim storage}} of all {{radioactive}} waste (for approximately 30 years) until a final repository is available. This therefore leads to higher standards for storage containers. Silicone elastomers (polysiloxanes), materials {{on the basis}} of silicon and oxygen with organic substituents, have various physical and chemical properties and seem to be suitable for the long-term storage of low- and intermediate-level radioactive waste. The aim of the present work is the qualification of a new coating material for storage containers. The use of polysiloxanes in other applications was also investigated. An important criterion for the coating is the simplicity of its application. Moreover, it should also have a high adhesion on steel as well as providing protection against corrosion. These properties were investigated for different polysiloxanes. The spraying tests showed that polysiloxane material with a viscosity of up to 45000 mPas could be applied by the airless spraying method. An elastic coating was produced which could ensure protection against mechanical impacts. In the framework of water vapour experiments, a very high diffusion constant was determined. The corrosion test confirmed that the polysiloxane coating provided only insufficient corrosion protection if the sample was in contact with water and water vapour at the same time. This problem was solved by using an additional <b>priming</b> <b>coat</b> of 60 micrometer zinc paint. The adhesion test showed that polysiloxanes have different levels of adhesion. The best adhesion was determined for condensation-cured silicones.

40|$|Seed {{enhancements}} may {{be defined}} as post-harvest treatments that improve germination or seedling growth, or facilitate the delivery of seeds and other materials required {{at the time of}} sowing. This definition includes three general areas of enhancements: pre-sowing hydration treatments (<b>priming),</b> <b>coating</b> technologies and seed conditioning. Pre-sowing hydration treatments include non-controlled water uptake systems (methods in which water is freely available and not restricted by the environment) and controlled systems (methods that regulate seed moisture content preventing the completion of germination). Three techniques are used for controlled water uptake: priming with solutions or with solid particulate systems or by controlled hydration with water. These priming techniques will be discussed in this paper with reference to methodology, protocol optimization, drying and storage. Coating technologies include pelleting and film coating, and coatings may serve as delivery systems. Seed conditioning equipment upgrades seed quality by physical criteria. Integration of these methods can be performed, and a system is described to upgrade seed quality in Brassica that combines hydration, coating and conditioning. Upgrading is achieved by detecting sinapine leakage from nonviable seeds in a coating material surrounding the seeds. Seed-coat permeability directly influences leakage rate, and seeds of many species have a semipermeable layer. The semipermeable layer restricts solute diffusion through the seed coat, while water movement is not impeded. Opportunities for future seed enhancement research and development are highlighte...|$|R

Additionally, we studied the relationship between intraocular pressure and lower leg muscle compartment pressure. Edema during and following cardiac surgery is due to hemodynamic, osmotic and inflammatory changes, according to Starling's Law. We attempted to influence the osmotic balance and reduce the inflammatory response in order to reduce the edema. METHODS: Thirty-six patients who underwent cardiac surgery were randomly allocated into four groups. Group A received albumin and mannitol into the pump prime. Group B had an, heparin-coated perfusion system, Group C had a leukocyte-depletion arterial line filter and Group D was the control group, where intraocular pressure was also measured. RESULTS: Lower leg muscle compartment pressure increased significantly during and after cardiac surgery in all groups, but this increase was significantly less in Group A than in the control group 24 h after surgery. No correlation was found between muscular compartment pressure and intraocular pressure. The intraocular pressure profile is different from the muscular compartment pressure and recovers much faster.

MethodsA total of 75 consecutive coronary artery bypass grafting procedures were performed using 1 of the following 3 cardiopulmonary bypass circuits under identical conditions of <b>priming</b> volumes, heparin <b>coating,</b> and protocols of anticoagulation and transfusion, as follows: a circuit with an open venous reservoir and cardiotomy suction (open group, n =  25), a circuit with an open venous reservoir without cardiotomy suction (nonsuction group, n =  25), or a circuit without either (closed group, n =  25). Blood samples were collected at 8 points up to the first postoperative morning. ResultsThe thrombin-antithrombin III complex, fibrinogen degeneration products, D-dimer, plasmin-α 2 plasmin inhibitor complex, and plasminogen activator inhibitor- 1 levels were significantly greater in the open group than those in the other 2 groups (P < . 0001, for all markers).

MethodsA total of 120 consecutive patients undergoing thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm repair with femoro-femoral distal perfusion from 2005 to 2008 were included in this retrospective study. Perfusion was accomplished with either a mini-circuit (centrifugal pump, low <b>priming</b> volume, heparin <b>coating)</b> and nonocclusive femoral cannulation (N =  48, group A) or conventional roller pump and occlusive cannulation (N =  72, group B). Parameters representing tissue damage or ischemia (lactate dehydrogenase, creatine kinase, myoglobin, creatinine, glomerular filtration rate) were monitored intraoperatively and postoperatively and compared. ResultsOne patient from each group required renal dialysis postoperatively. Myoglobin values were similar in both groups. Creatine kinase was significantly higher in group B (P < . 001). Hemolysis represented from lactate dehydrogenase was higher in group B (P = . 005). Both the traditional setup and the mini-circuit achieved a return to preoperative glomerular filtration rate by postoperative day 10 with a significantly higher decrease of glomerular filtration rate within 10 days in group B. ConclusionsThe use of mini-circuits for thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm surgery is safe. Compared with patients undergoing suprarenal clamping for abdominal aortic aneurysm, distal and organ perfusion in thoracoabdominal aortic aneurysm surgery maintain renal function independently of the technical setup. An initial decay of glomerular filtration rate on postoperative days 1 to 4, however, seems {{to be related to}} intraoperative leg ischemia and hemolysis caused by occlusive cannulation of the femoral vessels and the roller pump.

40|$|Cardiopulmonary bypass (CPB) is a {{technique}} that makes open heart surgery possible. When CPB is used the heart can be stopped while the blood circulation, oxygen delivery and carbon dioxide removal are guaranteed. In the last decades CPB has become much safer but still causes a systemic inflammation reaction (SIRS). SIRS may cause morbidity and, when severe, even mortality. SIRS reaction is worse in neonates and infants due to the immaturity of organs and the unfavourable ratio of CPB prime volume to patient circulating volume. This thesis focuses on different techniques {{that have been developed}} to decrease the deleterious effects of CPB in pediatric cardiac surgery. We compared in a retrospective way 2 groups of 99 patients each, in one group we used MUF and in the other group ultrafiltration was not used. We concluded that modified ultrafiltration decreases blood transfusion requirements and chest drain loss after pediatric cardiac surgery. The ratio between CPB prime solution and circulating blood volume is highest in the neonatal patient. It has been reported that neonates have a poor antioxidative and iron binding capacity. During CPB, prooxidative substances, such as nonprotein-bound iron, are released while the plasma antioxidant capacity decreases, resulting in excess accumulation of Radical Oxygen Species. Contact of blood with the non-biological surfaces of the CPB system has been designated as the main cause of complement activation. Improving the biocompatibility of CPB systems by means of decreasing the contact activation of blood elements and thereby attenuating the inflammatory response is evidently desired, and for this reason several coatings have been developed. Information is lacking about the interaction of medication and the CPB <b>prime</b> or the <b>coating</b> of a CPB system.
