Like estuaries, mangrove swamps are extremely important breeding grounds for many fish, with species such as snappers, halfbeaks, and tarpon spawning or maturing among them. Besides fish, numerous other animals use mangroves, including such species as the saltwater crocodile, American crocodile, proboscis monkey, diamondback terrapin, and the crab-eating frog, Fejervarya cancrivora (formerly Rana cancrivora). Mangroves represent important nesting site for numerous birds groups such as herons, storks, spoonbills, ibises, kingfishers, shorebirds and seabirds.|$|E
50|$|Ctenoid (toothed) {{scales are}} like cycloid scales, with small teeth along their outer edges. They are usually found on fishes with spiny fin rays, {{such as the}} <b>perch-like</b> <b>fishes.</b> The scales have a rough texture with a toothed outer or {{posterior}} edge featuring tiny teeth called ctenii. These scales contain almost no bone, being composed of a surface layer containing hydroxyapatite and calcium carbonate and a deeper layer composed mostly of collagen. The enamel of the other scale types is reduced to superficial ridges and ctenii.|$|R
50|$|Arripis is a genus {{of marine}} fishes from Australia and New Zealand, known as Australian salmon, kahawai and Australian herring. They {{are the only}} {{members of the family}} Arripidae. Despite the common name, Australian salmon are not related to the salmon family Salmonidae of the Northern Hemisphere, just as Australian herring are not related to herring of the Northern Hemisphere, but belong to the order Perciformes of <b>perch-like</b> <b>fishes.</b> Australian salmon were named so by early European {{settlers}} after their superficial resemblance to the salmoniform fishes.|$|R
40|$|The {{tessellated}} darters of {{the genus}} Boleosoma were first described by Rafinesque who,in 1820,named the Johnny darter Etheostoma nigrum. The type specimen was from the Green River of Kentucky. The species {{was transferred to the}} new genus Boleosoma by De Kay in 1842,and thus became Boleosoma nigrum. This and related genera have been grouped together by some taxonomists into the family Etheostomidae,though they are now usually included with other <b>perch-like</b> <b>fishes</b> in the family Percidae. The Johnny darter belongs to a group of fish which is apparently prone to speciation. A glance at the taxonomic history of the darters will clearly show that,with the passage of time,a greater number of species and subspecies are being recognized. Since the purpose or the writer's work is to demonstrate that in Quebec the Johnny darter 1 s represented by three races or populations that are separable on the basis of squamation and the number of rays in the soft dorsal fin, it would perhaps be advisable to describe the species nigrum and a few of its subspecies.

40|$|Most {{vertebrate}} {{species have}} more than one form of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) in their brains, {{but it is not clear}} whether each form has a distinct function. We report that sea bream (Sparus aurata) brains have three forms of GnRH, one of which is described herein and is called sea bream GnRH (sbGnRH). The primary structures of two forms were determined by Edman degradation and mass spectral analysis. The amino acid sequence of sbGnRH is pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-Tyr-Gly-Len-Ser-Pro-Gly-NH 2. The second peptide is identical to a form originally isolated from chicken brains (cGnRH-II) : pGlu-His-Trp-Ser-His-Gly-Trp-Tyr-Pro-Gly-NH 2. cGnRH-II is the most ancient form of GnRH identified to date in jawed fish and the most prevalent form throughout the vertebrates. The third form of GnRH has previously been identified as salmon GnRH by cDNA studies and is confirmed here by chromatographic and immunological studies. Phylogenetic distribution of GnRH peptides suggests sbGnRH arose in the <b>perch-like</b> <b>fish</b> as a gene duplication of the existing cGnRH-II or salmon GnRH genes. All three identified GnRH peptides were synthesized and shown to release gonadotropin in vivo in the sea bream. The dominant form of GnRH stored in the pituitary was sbGnRH. Not only was the content of sbGnRH 500 -fold greater than that of salmon GnRH but also cGnRH-II was not detected in the pituitary. The latter evidence suggests that sbGnRH is the endogenous releaser of gonadotropin II...|$|E
40|$|The Regional History Project {{conducted}} {{a series of}} interviews with Kenneth S. Norris, UCSC Professor of Natural History Emeritus, {{in the spring and summer}} of 1998. Halfway through the interviews, Norris, who had been in poor health, was hospitalized unexpectedly and died on August 16, 1998. Rather than publish an incomplete set of his edited interviews, the project was reconceived. We interviewed a group of his colleagues and former students who could discuss many of the topics the interviewer had not had an opportunity to discuss with him. These additional interviews include recollections of Norris’s myriad research interests (desert biology, herpetology, marine mammalogy) and his scientific legacy; his teaching philosophy and how it was so creatively manifested for almost two decades in the celebrated Natural History Field Quarter class; and his founding role in the creation in 1965 of UC’s Natural Reserve System. On October 24, 1998, at the Norris Memorial, held at UCSC, celebrating his life and work, many of his far-flung students and colleagues gathered together from around the country. During that weekend project interviewer Irene Reti, conducted interviews with Stephen R. Gliessman, Donald J. Usner, and Shannon M. Brownlee, for their recollections of the Natural History Field Quarter. Randall Jarrell conducted interviews with Robert M. Norris, William N. McFarland, William F. Perrin, and later, with Roger J. Samuelsen, and Lawrence D. Ford, who discussed the genesis of the NRS and Norris as scientist and naturalist. Norris was born August 11, 1924 in Los Angeles when Southern California was still a rural place with easy access to wild things. His mother and father relished the outdoors and were unusually encouraging of their boys’ naturalist interests. They took Ken and his older brother Robert on many family camping trips and hiking in the mountains and by the time he was about ten, Ken’s taste for natural history and collecting was already well developed. Norris graduated from Van Nuys High School in 1942 and entered UCLA. He served in the U. S. Navy from 1944 until 1948, when he returned to UCLA, and earned his bachelor’s degree in biology in 1948, after having almost completed his degree in geology. When he was a senior he met up with Raymond B. Cowles, who had a transformative influence on the direction of his life. Norris earned a master’s degree in desert zoogeography at UCLA in 1951, with Ray Cowles as his major professor when he wrote his thesis, “The Evolution of the Iguanid, genus Uma. ” He moved from the desert to the sea when he began work towards his Ph. D. under the legendary Carl L. Hubbs, at the Scripps Institution of Oceanography in La Jolla. Two years into his doctoral work Norris was hired as the founding curator at the country’s second oceanarium, Marineland of the Pacific in Palos Verdes, California, where he began his pioneering work with marine mammals during the period 1953 to 1960. He continued working on his dissertation on the opaleye, named after its lovely bluegreen eyes, a <b>perch-like</b> <b>fish</b> of the sea chub family Kyphosidae, in which he investigated the effect of water temperatures on this intertidal fish. For the groundbreaking ecological approach he developed in this dissertation, “The Functions of Temperature in the Percoid Fish, Girella nigricans (Ayres),” he received the Mercer Award of the Ecological Society of America for the best study by a young scholar in 1963. He received his Ph. D. from Scripps in 1959 and in the same year Norris returned to UCLA where he was hired as Ray Cowles’s successor and taught biology and herpetology and continued his research on desert reptiles. He was at UCLA until 1972, where he advanced to full professor of Natural History (the only professor of natural history in the UC system). In 1965, due to his efforts, UC’s Natural Reserve System was established under UC President Clark Kerr. While continuing at UCLA on a part-time basis, he became the founding director of the Oceanic Institute in Hawaii, from 1968 until 1971. In 1972, he moved north when he was appointed at UCSC and founded Long Marine Laboratory and the Institute of Marine Sciences. He was Professor of Natural History until he retired in 1990 after eighteen years at UC Santa Cruz. In these interviews Norris and his colleagues discussed the unusually varied range of his scientific discoveries and conservation activities. At UCLA his work as a desert herpetologist and ecologist led to his discoveries of the function of color changes in amphibians and reptiles and of circadian rhythms in snakes. His pioneering investigations in marine mammalogy confirmed dolphin echolocation skills in a series of elegant experiments. Much of what is now known about whales and dolphins, specifically their social and familial interactions is due to his work. His expertise in marine mammalogy also resulted in his strong influence on public policy in the crafting of the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972. His leadership and research were also instrumental in the national campaign to reduce the dolphin kill in tuna fishing. Norris was the author of over a hundred scientific papers and several books on dolphins and porpoises...|$|E
40|$|Delineation of {{the fish}} family Percichthyidae (Percomorphaceae) has a long and {{convoluted}} history, with recent morphological-based studies restricting species members to South American and Australian freshwater and catadromous temperate perches. Four recent nuclear gene-based phylogenetic studies, however, found that the Percichthyidae was not monophyletic and was nested within a newly discovered inter-familial clade of Percomorphaceae, the Centrarchiformes, which comprises the Centrarchidae and 12 other families. Here, we reexamined the systematics of the Percichthyidae and Centrarchiformes based on new mitogenomic information. Our mitogenomic results are globally congruent with the recent nuclear gene-based studies although the overall amount of phylogenetic signal of the mitogenome is lower. They {{do not support the}} monophyly of the Percichthyidae, because the catadromous genus Percalates is not exclusively related to the freshwater percichthyids. The Percichthyidae (minus Percalates) and Percalates belong to a larger clade, equivalent to the Centrarchiformes, but their respective sister groups are unresolved. Because all recent analyses recover a monophyletic Centrarchiformes but with substantially different intra-relationships, we performed a simultaneous analysis for a character set combining the mitogenome and 19 nuclear genes previously published, for 22 centrarchiform taxa. This analysis furthermore indicates that the Centrarchiformes are divided into three lineages and the superfamily Cirrhitoidea is monophyletic as well as the temperate and freshwater centrarchiform <b>perch-like</b> <b>fishes.</b> It also clarifies some of the relationships within the freshwater Percichthyidae...|$|R
