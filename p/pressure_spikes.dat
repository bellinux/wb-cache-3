25|$|The {{temperature}} of corium {{can be as}} high as 2400°C (4,352 °F) in the first hours after the meltdown, potentially reaching over 2800°C (5,072 °F). A large amount of heat can be released by reaction of metals (particularly zirconium) in corium with water. Flooding of the corium mass with water, or the drop of molten corium mass into a water pool, may result in a temperature spike and production of large amounts of hydrogen, which can result in a pressure spike in the containment vessel. The steam explosion resulting from such sudden corium-water contact can disperse the materials and form projectiles that may damage the containment vessel by impact.

An experimental platform {{was built by}} using data acquisition, a set of signal collectors, and a blower wired with driver circuit. The related signals were all acquired and processed by a program written with the optimized controller in LabVIEW. Then, the comparative experiments were conducted in this paper. Specifically, in the experiments, the conventional PID controller led to the obvious <b>pressure</b> <b>spike</b> which was 2 cmH 2 O higher than inspiratory pressure, whereas the proposed controller can decrease the pressure quickly without the <b>pressure</b> <b>spike</b> when switching to the expiration state. Also, the Pressure-Volume Loop indicated that the area from the optimized controller was smaller than the conventional PID controller.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} predict and {{optimise}} highly loaded contact performance, accurate lubricant data is crucial. The lubricant's high-pressure rheological behaviour {{is by far}} the least known parameter. However, this is the key factor to realistic modeling of non-Newtonian Elasto-Hydrodynamic lubrication. In this paper a new approach is described to extract such data from optical interferometric film thickness measurements of EHL contacts. The approach is relatively straightforward and cheap compared to "out of contact" rheological experiments using specialized equipment. A measured high-resolution film thickness distribution was positioned using a computed film thickness distribution as a reference. The reference is computed using the same operating conditions as the measurement. Subsequently, from the computed film thickness difference, a pressure difference file is obtained by deconvolution. Adding this pressure difference to the computed pressure file associated with the computed reference film thickness, provides a corrected pressure distribution, as it has appeared in the experimental contact. In this paper results are presented for the <b>pressure</b> <b>spike</b> region of the contact, in which significant shear stresses occur. The basic approach and its difficulties are described as well as some "tricks", such as the reduction of (local) noise resulting from the ill-posedness of the deconvolution. It is shown that simple averaging over a circle segment in the <b>pressure</b> <b>spike</b> zone, results in significant noise reduction and a very good 'measured' <b>pressure</b> <b>spike...</b>|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to use experimental, {{analytical}} and computational (Computational Fluid Dynamic - CFD) methodologies to investigate so-called highly transient axi-symmetric squeeze flows. These flows occur between two co-axial and parallel discs which are subjected to an impact, arising from a falling mass, which induces a constant energy squeezing system, as distinct from the traditionally investigated constant force or constant velocity squeezing systems. Experiments were conducted using a test cell comprising two parallel discs of diameter 120 mm with a flexible bladder used to contain fluid. This test cell was bolted onto {{the base of a}} drop-weight tester used to induce constant energy squeeze flows. Glycerine was used as the working fluid, the temperature of which was appropriately monitored. Disc separation, together with pressures (at three radial positions), were measured throughout the experimental stroke (typically less than 10 ms duration). Two additional pressure transducers (at the same radial position as the outermost transducer) were also used to monitor (and subsequently correct for) minor non-axi-symmetries that arose in the system. Approximately 150 tests were conducted, embracing combinations of drop height from 0. 1 to 1 m, drop mass from 10 to 55 kg and initial disc separation from 3 to 10 mm. Three elementary features were typically observed: a distinct preliminary <b>pressure</b> <b>spike</b> (1) immediately after impact corresponding to very large accelerations (exceeding over 6 km/s 2 in some experiments), a secondary major <b>pressure</b> <b>spike</b> (2) towards the termination of the stroke corresponding to diminishing disc separations and a bridging region (3) joining the two spikes corresponding to somewhat reduced pressures. While pressure distributions were observed to be closely parabolic during the major <b>pressure</b> <b>spike,</b> some uncertainty was present during the preliminary <b>pressure</b> <b>spike,</b> ascribed to sensitivities to deviations from axi-symmetry, and the likelihood of inertially generated pressures {{at the edge of the}} disc. By applying newly defined parameters of inertial composition 1 ̆ 00538 (which characterizes the ratio of temporal to spatial inertia effects) and dynamic Reynolds number 1 ̆ 007341 ̆ 007411 ̆ 00 bd 71 ̆ 00 bec 1 ̆ 00 be 1 (which represents the instantaneous ratio of inertial to viscous effects), it was established that the preliminary <b>pressure</b> <b>spike</b> is dominated by temporal inertia whereas the major <b>pressure</b> <b>spike</b> is viscous dominant. The former feature appears not to have been reported on in the formal literature. iii Four analytical models were considered, invoking the parallel flow assumption in conjunction with the Navier Stokes equations: an inviscid/inertial model, a viscous model (the lubrication approximation), a quasi-steady linear (QSL) model and a quasi-steady corrected linear (QSCL) model. The first two of these models, on incorporation of measured disc separations, and the derived velocities and accelerations, achieved acceptable correlations with pressure measurements (largely within uncertainty bounds) during the initial impact and towards the end of the stroke, respectively. The QSL model agreed satisfactorily with measurements throughout the entire duration of the experiment, while the QSCL model, by incorporating non-linear effects in an approximate linear way, yielded somewhat better correlations. By invoking the parallel flow assumption, all four models predict a parabolic radial pressure distribution. Utilizing a hypothetical case in which variations of disc separation, velocity and acceleration were considered (employing similar magnitudes and timescales to those that were measured), outputs of the QSL model yielded results that correlated closely with CFD predictions, while the QSCL data were somewhat better. On the basis of the CFD data it was also inferred that, within practical uncertainty bounds, the parallel flow assumption was valid for the range of disc separation to radius ratios embraced in the current investigation...|$|R
50|$|Hydraulic {{telescopic}} cylinders {{are often}} {{limited to a}} maximum hydraulic pressure of 2000-3000 psi. This is because the outward forces produced by internal hydraulic pressure tends to expand the steel sleeve sections. Too much pressure will cause the nested sleeves to balloon outward, bind the mechanism and stop moving. The danger exists that a permanent deformation of the outer diameter of a sleeve could occur, thus ruining a telescopic actuator.

50|$|However details {{regarding}} the redesign are available.

50|$|As well as {{allowing}} a greater mass of air {{to be admitted}} to an engine, intercoolers have a key role in controlling the internal temperatures in a turbocharged engine. When fitted with a turbo (as with any form of supercharging), the engine's specific power is increased, leading to higher combustion and exhaust temperatures. The exhaust gases passing through the turbine section of the turbocharger are usually around 450 °C (840 °F), but can be as high as 1000 °C (1830 °F) under extreme conditions. This heat passes through the turbocharger unit and contributes to the heating of the air being compressed in the compressor section of the turbo. If left uncooled, this hot air enters the engine, further increasing internal temperatures. This leads to a build-up of heat that will eventually stabilise, but this may be at temperatures in excess of the engine's design limits- 'hot spots' at the piston crown or exhaust valve can cause warping or cracking of these components. High air charge temperatures will also increase the possibility of pre-ignition or detonation. Detonation causes damaging <b>pressure</b> <b>spikes</b> in the engine's cylinders, which can quickly damage an engine. These effects are especially found in modified or tuned engines running at very high specific power outputs. An efficient intercooler removes heat from the air in the induction system, preventing the cyclic heat build-up via the turbocharger, allowing higher power outputs to be achieved without damage.|$|E
50|$|The heat {{transfer}} rate of smokeless propellants increases with pressure; so the rate of gas generation from a given grain surface area increases at higher pressures.

Conversely, propellants designed for a minimum {{heat transfer}} pressure may cease decomposition into gaseous reactants if bullet movement decreases pressure before a slow burning propellant has been consumed.

The combustion model includes erosive burning and unsteady, dynamic burning corresponding to transient energy storage in the heated surface layer of the propellant. The integrated internal ballistics code (Rocballist) is used to investigate the role of these two burning rate augmenting mechanisms in solid rocket motor performance. Two tactical motors are used as test cases. Results indicate that dynamic burning can be the dominant factor in producing a short-duration ignition <b>pressure</b> <b>spike</b> in low-L???? motors, particularly if the L=D ratio is not too large and the port cross section is nonrestrictive (e. g., center perforated grain). However, when L=D is large and the port cross section is noncircular in the aft section (aft fins/slots), erosive burning can take over in dominating the burning rate {{to the extent that}} an otherwise progressive pressure-time trace becomes regressive/neutral. That is, erosive burning can effectively prolong the initial <b>pressure</b> <b>spike</b> in some star-aft motors. The results also show that with sufficiently accurate models of dynamic burning and erosive burning, it is reasonable to expect reliable internal ballistics predictions with suitable simplified flowfield models, thereby realizing significant reductions in computation time compared with 3 -D, multiphase reacting flow simulations. published or submitted for publicationis peer reviewe...|$|R

While it was originally considered that the skull remained static upon contact with the primary wave front, clinically significant skull flexure has been documented in vivo with rats exposed to blast waves and with model human heads exposed to blast conditions. In contact with a blast wave, the skull becomes elastic due to its deformable foundation - the external environment, the cerebrospinal fluid of the dura, and the brain itself. During a blast, the brain collides with the dynamic skull and rebounds in accordance with localized cranial <b>pressure</b> <b>spikes.</b> This trauma may account for the localized axonal injuries that characterize bTBI.
