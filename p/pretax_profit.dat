40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{a new approach}} to estimating the existence and magnitude of taxmotivated income shifting within multinational corporations. Existing studies of income shifting use changes in corporate tax rates as a source of identification. In contrast, this paper exploits exogenous earnings shocks at the parent firm and investigates how these shocks propagate across low-tax and high-tax multinational subsidiaries. This approach is implemented using a large panel of European multinational affiliates over the period 1995 - 2005. The central result is that parents' positive earnings shocks are associated with a significantly positive increase in <b>pretax</b> <b>profits</b> at low-tax affiliates, relative to the effect on the <b>pretax</b> <b>profits</b> of high-tax affiliates. The result is robust to controlling for various other differences between low-tax and high-tax affiliates and for country-pair-year fixed effects. Additional tests suggest that the estimated effect is attributable primarily to the strategic use of debt across affiliates. The magnitude of income shifting estimated using this approach is substantial, but somewhat smaller than that found in the previous literature. [...] ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} new {{estimates of}} the taxes paid on nonfinancial corporate capital, on the pretax rate of return to capital, and on the effective tax rate. The basic time series show that both the pretax rate of return and the effective tax rate have varied substantially in the past quarter century. An explicit analysis indicates that, after adjusting for {{different aspects of the}} business cycle, pretax profitability was between one and 1. 5 percentage points lower in the 1970 's than in the 1960 's. The rate of profitability in the 1960 's was also about one-half of a percentage point greater than the profitability in the 7 years of the 1950 's after the Korean war. Changes in productivity growth, in inflation, in relative unit labor costs, and in other variables are all associated with changes in profitability. None of these variables, however, can explain the differences in profitability between the 1950 Ts, 1960 's and 1970 's. Looking at broad decade averages, the effective tax rate and the pretax rate of return move in opposite directions, higher <b>pretax</b> <b>profits</b> occurring when the tax rate is high. There thus appears to have been no tendency for <b>pretax</b> <b>profits</b> to vary in a way that offsets differences in effective tax rates. ...|$|R

40|$|Why have {{state-owned}} firms been so common? One explanation, {{proposed in}} the past, is that if state firms can be induced to maximize <b>pretax</b> <b>profits,</b> then state ownership may be less inefficient than private ownership when corporate tax rates are high. If this argument were right, the capital intensity of state-owned firms should fall with privatization. The data instead show that firms lay off workers when they are privatized. Why? This Paper argues {{that the government can}} use cheap loans from state-owned banks to maintain the capital stock of privately owned firms at an efficient level, in spite of a high corporate tax rate. State-owned firms should then have the same capital intensity as equivalent privately owned firms. The Paper then argues that many other distortions to a private firm's incentives, e. g. the minimum wage, result in their employing too few low-skilled workers. State-owned firms, in contrast, can be induced to hire the desired number of such workers. This gain must be weighted against the presumed loss in productivity more generally from state ownership. corporate taxes; privatization...|$|R

40|$|Although {{states and}} localities collect a {{substantial}} amount of revenue from corporate profits taxes and property taxes on corporate capital, these taxes have been inadequately reflected in previous calculations of the effective corporate tax rate and the pretax rate of return to corporate capital. The present study focuses on non-financial corporations and begins by estimating the profits taxes and property taxes which these corporations pay to state and local governments. These estimates are then used to calculate the pretax rate of return on non-financial corporate capital; the results suggest that the conventional omission of state-local property taxes leads to an understatement of this rate of return by about one percentage point. The effective tax rate on non-financial corporate profits is also computed, taking account of state-local taxes. These taxes amount to approximately sixteen percent of the <b>pretax</b> <b>profits</b> of non-financial corporations. The total effective tax rate on these corporations is shown to have risen substantially during the past two decades; it averaged more than seventy percent in the most recent five-year period. The series for the rate of return and effective tax rate are used to compute the real after-tax rate of return on non-financial corporate capital. The calculations show that this number has declined recently, reaching 2. 3 percent in 1979. This is to be contrasted with after-tax returns of over five percent which prevailed during the mid- 1960 s. ...|$|R
40|$|In its {{specific}} {{focus on the}} partnerships between nonprofit organizations and corporations {{from the perspective of}} the nonprofit organization, this paper adds to the conceptual and theoretical work on the interacting cross-level understanding of social embeddedness. Trust, legitimacy and reciprocity are three important concepts that inform these interorganizational relationships. Hagedoorn’s (2006) three levels of embeddedness: environmental embeddedness, interorganizational embeddedness and dyadic embeddedness provide the theoretical lens through which trust, legitimacy and reciprocity provide prediction regarding the level of support that corporations might offer to nonprofit organizations. Estimated at $ 241 billion, or two percent of gross domestic product of the United States, philanthropy is big business (Daw, 2006; Gardberg & Fombrun, 2006). Although corporate support represents a relatively small share of total donations (5. 6 % in the US and 16 % in Canada), it remains an important contribution (Daw, 2006). In Canada, 43 % of the companies traded on the Toronto Stock Exchange donate between. 1 to 2. 7 % of their <b>pretax</b> <b>profits</b> (Jantzi Research Associates, 2006). Non-profit organizations, the recipients of these monies and other inkind contributions, play an important role in the economy (Statistics Canada, 2006 b); a role that is growing as the sector continues to outpace the economy as a whole (Gardberg & Fombrun, 2006; Statistics Canada, 2006 b).
