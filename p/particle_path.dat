50|$|The {{shape of}} the {{generated}} electrical pulse varies with the <b>particle</b> <b>path</b> through the aperture. Shoulders and other artifacts can occur because the electric field density varies across {{the diameter of the}} aperture. This variance is a result of both the physical constriction of the electric field and also the fact that the liquid velocity varies as a function of radial location in the aperture. In the flow cell format, this effect is minimized since sheath flow ensures each particle travels an almost identical path through the flow cell. In the aperture format, signal processing algorithms can be used to correct for artifacts resulting from <b>particle</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E
50|$|Liouville's Theorem states that, for Hamiltonian systems, {{the local}} density of microstates {{following}} a <b>particle</b> <b>path</b> through phase space is constant as viewed by an observer {{moving with the}} ensemble (i.e., the convective time derivative is zero). Thus, if the microstates are uniformly distributed in phase space initially, they will remain so at all times. But Liouville's theorem {{does not imply that}} the ergodic hypothesis holds for all Hamiltonian systems.|$|E
50|$|Electrons {{produced}} in nuclear decay are called beta particles. Because of their low mass relative to atoms, they are strongly scattered by nuclei (Coulomb or Rutherford scattering), {{much more so}} than heavier particles. Beta particle tracks are therefore crooked. In addition to producing secondary electrons (delta rays) while ionizing atoms, they also produce bremsstrahlung photons. A maximum range of beta radiation can be defined experimentally which is smaller than the range that would be measured along the <b>particle</b> <b>path.</b>|$|E

50|$|While {{the first}} synchrotrons and storage rings like the Cosmotron and ADA {{strictly}} used the toroid shape, the strong focusing principle independently discovered by Ernest Courant et al. and Nicholas Christofilos allowed the complete {{separation of the}} accelerator into components with specialized functions along the <b>particle</b> <b>path,</b> shaping the path into a round-cornered polygon. Some important components are given by radio frequency cavities for direct acceleration, dipole magnets (bending magnets) for deflection of particles (to close the path), and quadrupole / sextupole magnets for beam focusing.|$|E
50|$|Unlike in a cyclotron, synchrotrons {{are unable}} to {{accelerate}} particles from zero kinetic energy; one of the obvious reasons {{for this is that}} its closed <b>particle</b> <b>path</b> would be cut by a device that emits particles. Thus, schemes were developed to inject pre-accelerated particle beams into a synchrotron. The pre-acceleration can be realized by a chain of other accelerator structures like a linac, a microtron or another synchrotron; all of these in turn need to be fed by a particle source comprising a simple high voltage power supply, typically a Cockcroft-Walton generator.|$|E
50|$|The {{maximum energy}} that a cyclic {{accelerator}} can impart is typically {{limited by the}} maximum strength of the magnetic fields and the minimum radius (maximum curvature) of the <b>particle</b> <b>path.</b> Thus one method for increasing the energy limit is to use superconducting magnets, these not being limited by magnetic saturation. Electron/positron accelerators may also be limited by the emission of synchrotron radiation, resulting in a partial loss of the particle beam's kinetic energy. The limiting beam energy is reached when the energy lost to the lateral acceleration required to maintain the beam path in a circle equals the energy added each cycle.|$|E

30|$|Applications to real field {{examples}} require frequent updates for the streamlines, {{using the}} sweep geometry {{resulting from the}} earlier streamlines as input for the shifted streamlines due to transient flow to account for any wells added and compliant with any actual changes in the flood management schedule (Thiele et al. 2002). Although we use steady well rates in our present analysis, well rates can be time-dependent and prescribed by any decline function to study transient flow. Wells can be switched on at different times with any patterns of decline rate as showcased in a different application of source flows to explain the shapes of terrestrial gravity flows (Weijermars et al. 2014). The resulting <b>particle</b> <b>paths</b> can all be tracked by our method, {{with the realization that}} <b>particle</b> <b>paths</b> and instantaneous streamlines will differ in such transient flow cases and both can be accurately accounted for in our model. We can track shifting <b>particle</b> <b>paths</b> for any transient flow in the reservoir with our analytical simulator.|$|R

50|$|Lorentz force: If a {{positive}} electric charge moves across {{a magnetic field}} it experiences a force according to the right-hand rule. If the curl of your right fingers represents a rotation from the direction the charge is moving to {{the direction of the}} magnetic field then the force is in the direction of your right thumb. Because the charge is moving, the force causes the <b>particle</b> <b>path</b> to bend. The bending force is computed by the vector cross product. This means that the bending force increases with the velocity of the particle and the strength of the magnetic field. The force is maximum when the particle direction and magnetic fields are at right angles, is less at any other angle and is zero when the particle moves parallel to the field.|$|E

40|$|<b>Particle</b> <b>path</b> based image {{velocimetry}} {{has been}} developed for 3 D volumetric velocity measurement of fluid flows. The proposed method is basically based on the tomographic reconstruction of 3 D particle paths by using multiple camera views of long exposure particle images. <b>Particle</b> <b>path</b> based image velocimetry was popular {{in the early days}} of 2 D PIV but went out of use rapidly because of its inherent issues like intersection of particle paths and directional ambiguity. But in the present work, this technique is further exploited by using new techniques based on the tomographic reconstruction of 3 D particle paths. The velocity recovery results of this new approach are compared to those of the conventional 3 D tomographic particle tracking velocimetry using two instantaneous particle images at different instants...|$|E
