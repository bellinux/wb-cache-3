5|$|As in Puerto Rico and Hispaniola, {{the severe}} drought during the El Niño of 1997 {{exacerbated}} the flood's disruption to crops in eastern Cuba. The heavy rainfall from Georges damaged the crops greatly, {{despite the effort}} to harvest them prior to its arrival. Up to 70% of the <b>plantain</b> crop, a chief food in the country's diet, was destroyed. The sugarcane crop fared badly as well, limiting one of the country's important export crops. The coffee and cocoa plantations also suffered from the hurricane, further damaging the country's food supply. A total of 15,758 hectares of croplands as well as 36,040 tons of fruit were destroyed by Hurricane Georges. Agricultural losses from the storm were estimated at $15million.|$|E
5|$|On {{exposed parts}} of the coast, the muds and sands are scoured by the tides, and have no {{vegetation}} except possibly algae or eelgrass, but where the shoreline is more protected, internationally important salt marshes can form, with several uncommon species. The salt marsh contains glassworts and annual seablite in the most exposed regions, with a succession of plants following on as the marsh becomes more established: first sea aster, then mainly sea lavender, with sea purslane in the creeks and smaller areas of sea <b>plantain</b> and other common marsh plants. Scrubby sea-blite and matted sea lavender are characteristic plants of the drier upper salt marsh here, although they are uncommon in the UK away from the Norfolk coast.|$|E

5|$|Impacts {{throughout}} the Windward Islands were substantial, but most heavily concentrated in St. Lucia. There, gusts reached 69mph (110km/h), toppling trees and power lines. Torrential rainfall up to 26.3in (668mm) created mudslides and landslides that {{damaged or destroyed}} numerous structures, bridges, and vehicles. Most of the island's <b>plantain</b> and banana crops were destroyed. Up to 14 people were killed. Farther west in Curaçao, Tomas led to the most prolific rain event in four decades. An elderly man was killed after suffering {{a heart attack and}} drowning in his flooded vehicle, while a rescue worker died after a hospital wall collapsed. In Haiti, already ravaged by a catastrophic 7.0 MW earthquake less than a year prior, heavy rainfall flooded a refugee camp and triggered mudslides that destroyed homes and roads. Up to 35 people were killed there, though it was feared many more could die as Tomas exacerbated an already-deadly cholera outbreak.|$|E
5|$|On October5, a {{national}} disaster was declared for Jamaica {{due to the}} effects of Nicole. In response, the USAID's Office of Foreign Disaster Assistance provided US$50,000 for the purchase and delivery of relief supplies and fuel for emergency vehicles. About J$4million (US$46,800) was donated by the Ministry of Agriculture and Fisheries to the Greenhouse Growers Association for the repair of greenhouses. In conjunction with the Food and Agriculture Organization, an estimated J$12million (US$140,400) was made available to initiate the planting of about 50,000 crop seedlings. The Veterinary Division provided financial assistance to livestock farmers and dispatched animal technicians with prophylactic medication and vitamins to avert foot rot disease in small ruminants, including goats and sheep. The cost of the medications was estimated at J$2million (US$23,400). The Banana Board's Catastrophe Fund, which at the time comprised J$50million (US$585,000), delivered both monetary support and human resources to local banana and <b>plantain</b> farmers.|$|E

5000|$|The term [...] "plantain" [...] is loosely {{applied to}} any banana {{cultivar}} that is eaten when cooked. However, {{there is no}} formal botanical distinction between bananas and <b>plantains.</b> Cooking is also a matter of custom, rather than necessity. Ripe <b>plantains</b> can be eaten raw, since the starches are converted to sugars as they ripen. In some countries, {{there may be a}} clear distinction between <b>plantains</b> and bananas, but in other countries, where many more cultivars are consumed, the distinction is not made in the common names used. In more formal usage, the term [...] "plantain" [...] is used only for [...] "true" [...] <b>plantains,</b> while other starchy cultivars also used for cooking are called [...] "cooking bananas".|$|R

5|$|The Gangavadi region {{consisted}} of the malnad region, the plains (Bayaluseemae) and the semi-malnad with lower elevation and rolling hills. The main crops of the malnad region were paddy, betel leaves, cardamom and pepper and the semi-malnad region with its lower altitude produced rice, millets such as ragi and corn, pulses, oilseeds {{and it was also}} the base for cattle farming. The plains to the east were the flat lands fed by Kaveri, Tungabhadra and Vedavati rivers where cultivations of sugarcane, paddy, coconut, areca nut (adeka totta), betel leaves, <b>plantain</b> and flowers (vara vana) were common. Sources of irrigation were excavated tanks, wells, natural ponds and water bodies in the catchment area of dams (Katta). Inscriptions attesting to irrigation of previously uncultivated lands seem to indicate an expanding agrarian community.|$|E
5|$|The {{implications}} of crop diversity are at {{both local and}} world levels. Global organizations that aim to support diversity include Bioversity International (formerly known as International Plant Genetic Resources Institute), the International Institute of Tropical Agriculture, the Borlaug Global Rust Initiative, and the International Network for Improvement of Banana and <b>Plantain.</b> Members of the United Nations, at the World Summit on Sustainable Development 2002 at Johannesburg, said that crop diversity {{is in danger of}} being lost if measures are not taken. One such step taken in the action against the loss of biodiversity among crops is gene banking. There are a number of organizations that enlist teams of local farmers to grow native varieties, particularly those that are threatened by extinction due to lack of modern-day use. There are also local, national and international efforts to preserve agricultural genetic resources through off-site methods such as seed and sperm banks for further research and crop breeding.|$|E

50|$|Statistics on the {{production}} and export of bananas and <b>plantains</b> {{are available from the}} Food and Agriculture Organization. Some countries produce statistics which distinguish between bananas and <b>plantains,</b> but two of the top three producers (India and China) do not, so comparisons can only be made using the total for bananas and <b>plantains</b> combined. The 2012 statistics (see Table 1) show that India led the world in banana production, producing around 18% of the worldwide crop of 139 million metric tonnes. Philippines was the next largest producer with around 7% of the worldwide crop. Its national data does distinguish between bananas and <b>plantains,</b> and shows that the latter made up over 95% of production. Ten countries produced around two thirds of the total world production.|$|R
5|$|The {{variety of}} fruits and {{vegetables}} that Bengal has to offer is incredible. A host of gourds, roots and tubers, leafy greens, succulent stalks, lemons and limes, green and purple eggplants, red onions, <b>plantain,</b> broad beans, okra, banana tree stems and flowers, green jackfruit, and red pumpkins {{are to be found in}} the markets popularly known as anaj bazaar. Panta bhat (rice soaked overnight in water) with onion and green chili is a traditional dish consumed in rural areas. Common spices found in a Bengali kitchen are cumin, ajmoda (radhuni), bay leaf, mustard, ginger, green chillies, and turmeric. People of erstwhile East Bengal use a lot of ajmoda, coriander leaves, tamarind, coconut, and mustard in their cooking while those aboriginally from West Bengal use a lot of sugar, garam masala, and red chilli powder. Vegetarian dishes are mostly prepared without onion and garlic.|$|E
5|$|Apart {{from the}} land related taxes, there were other taxes, such as Garden tax from {{compounds}} where, among others, <b>plantain,</b> coconut and arecanut palms were grown and irrigated by water from the well. Tree tax on trees such as palmyrah, margosa and iluppai and Poll tax equivalent to a personal tax from each. Professional tax was collected from members of each caste or guild and commercial taxes consisting of, among others, stamp duty on clothes (clothes could not be sold privately and had to have official stamp), Taraku or levy on items of food, and Port and customs duties. Columbuthurai, which connected the Peninsula with the mainland at Poonakari with its boat services, {{was one of the}} chief port, and there were customs check posts at the sand passes of Pachilaippalai. Elephants from the southern Sinhalese kingdoms and the Vanni region were brought to Jaffna to be sold to foreign buyers. They were shipped abroad from a bay called Urukathurai, which is now called Kayts—a shortened form of Portuguese Caes dos elephantess (Bay of Elephants). Perhaps a peculiarity of Jaffna was the levy of license fee for the cremation of the dead.|$|E
