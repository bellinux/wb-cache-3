5|$|The {{irreducible}} infinite-dimensional unitary representations {{may have}} indirect relevance to <b>physical</b> <b>reality</b> in speculative modern theories since the (generalized) Lorentz group appears {{as the little}} group of the Poincare group of spacelike vectors in higher spacetime dimension. The corresponding infinite-dimensional unitary representations of the (generalized) Poincaré group are the so-called tachyonic representations. Tachyons appear in the spectrum of bosonic strings and are associated with instability of the vacuum. Even though tachyons may not be realized in nature, these representations must be mathematically understood {{in order to understand}} string theory. This is so since tachyon states turn out to appear in superstring theories too in attempts to create realistic models.|$|E

5|$|Twentieth-century Reformed theologian Karl Barth did {{not follow}} the Reformed belief that sacraments are used by God as means of grace. Instead, he saw the Lord's Supper as purely {{symbolic}} and functioning to proclaim God's promises. His position has been called symbolic memorialism because he saw the sacraments function as memorializing Christ's death. Another twentieth-century Reformed theologian, Donald Baillie, took a position {{similar to that of}} John Calvin. Baillie argued that though God is omnipresent, he is present in a special way in the Lord's Supper because he is present by virtue of the believer's faith. Christ's presence is even more real to the believer in the sacrament than is <b>physical</b> <b>reality.</b>|$|E

25|$|In 1935 Einstein, Boris Podolsky and Nathan Rosen {{developed}} an argument, {{published in the}} magazine Physical Review with the title Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of <b>Physical</b> <b>Reality</b> Be Considered Complete?, based on an entangled state of two systems.

25|$|Nothing within {{quantum theory}} itself {{requires}} each possibility within a wave function to complement a mental state. As {{all physical states}} (i.e. brain states) are quantum states, their associated mental states should be also. Nonetheless, {{it is not what}} we experience within <b>physical</b> <b>reality.</b> Albert and Loewer argue that the mind must be intrinsically different than the <b>physical</b> <b>reality</b> as described by quantum theory. Thereby, they reject type-identity physicalism in favour of a non-reductive stance. However, Lockwood saves materialism through the notion of supervenience of the mental on the physical.|$|E

25|$|Incompatibilism {{requires}} {{a distinction between}} the mental and the physical, being a commentary on the incompatibility of (determined) <b>physical</b> <b>reality</b> and one's presumably distinct experience of will. Secondarily, metaphysical libertarian free will must assert influence on <b>physical</b> <b>reality,</b> and where mind is responsible for such influence (as opposed to ordinary system randomness), it must be distinct from body to accomplish this. Both substance and property dualism offer such a distinction, and those particular models thereof that are not causally inert with respect to the physical world provide a basis for illustrating incompatibilist free will (i.e. interactionalist dualism and non-reductive physicalism).|$|E
25|$|One {{argument}} against Dualism is {{with regard to}} causal interaction. If consciousness (the mind) can exist independently of <b>physical</b> <b>reality</b> (the brain), one must explain how physical memories are created concerning consciousness. Dualism must therefore explain how consciousness affects <b>physical</b> <b>reality.</b> One of the main objections to dualistic interactionism is lack of explanation of how the material and immaterial are able to interact. Varieties of dualism according to which an immaterial mind causally affects the material body and vice versa have come under strenuous attack from different quarters, especially in the 20th century. Critics of dualism have often asked how something totally immaterial can affect something totally material—this is the basic problem of causal interaction.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{examines}} the semiosic development {{of energy to}} information within a dyadic reality that operates within the contradictions of both classical and quantum physics. These two realities are examined within the three Peircean modal categories of Firstness, Secondness and Thirdness. The paper concludes that our world cannot operate within {{either of the two}} <b>physical</b> <b>realities</b> but instead filiates the two to permit a semiosis or information-generation of complex systems...|$|R
40|$|This is a {{story of}} two spatial designers: The Mathematician and the Architect. In the four {{dimensional}} space of a Mathematician, most <b>physical</b> <b>realities</b> must be ignored in order for the space to remain pure. The visual, {{one of the most powerful}} tools of the Architect, can coexist within the Mathematician's four dimensional world without affecting its purity. However, the Architect must ignore his/her <b>physical</b> <b>realities,</b> such as gravity, mass, and human scale. The Mathematician establishes the rules within which the Architect must operate. The Architect manipulates form through a structure that is defined by the Mathematician. The Architect explores spatial qualities through the tools that the Mathematician gives him/her. The Architect tries to understand the meaning of the form that both of them have created. He/she pushes the form in order for it to achieve spatial qualities. Together, the Mathematician and the Architect try to understand the meaning of such spatial qualifiers as: big/small, wide/narrow, inside/outside, and light/dark. The Architect starts to understand why spaces achieve these qualities in his/her physical world...|$|R

25|$|The books {{discuss the}} idea that the {{physical}} environment is constructed and maintained by the inner selves of the individual occupants (including the animals).

25|$|After the EPR paper, quantum {{mechanics}} {{was in an}} unsatisfactory position: either it was incomplete, {{in the sense that}} it failed to account for some elements of <b>physical</b> <b>reality,</b> or it violated the principle of a finite propagation speed of physical effects. In a modified version of the EPR thought experiment, two hypothetical observers, now commonly referred to as Alice and Bob, perform independent measurements of spin on a pair of electrons, prepared at a source in a special state called a spin singlet state. It is the conclusion of EPR that once Alice measures spin in one direction (e.g. on the x axis), Bob's measurement in that direction is determined with certainty, as being the opposite outcome to that of Alice, whereas immediately before Alice's measurement Bob's outcome was only statistically determined (i.e., was only a probability, not a certainty); thus, either the spin in each direction is an element of <b>physical</b> <b>reality,</b> or the effects travel from Alice to Bob instantly.|$|E
