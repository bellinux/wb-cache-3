40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} {{the effects of}} varying numbers of layers of <b>plaster</b> of Paris <b>bandages</b> on the mechanical properties of specimens used {{on the construction of}} orthopedic splints. METHODS: Rectangular plate-shaped and cylinder-shaped specimens were constructed and assigned to two groups simulating plaster slabs and cast and further divided into six subgroups according to the number of layers used: 3, 6, 8, 10, 12 and 14 layers. The specimens were subjected to either a three-point bending test (plates/slab) or compressive strength test (cylinders/cast). The following mechanical properties were evaluated: maximum load, elastic limit load and stiffness. Specimen weight was also calculated. Data was analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and the least significant difference (LSD) tests. RESULTS: Pairwise comparisons of the subgroups 10 x 12 and 10 x 14 revealed significant differences for all mechanical properties (p< 0. 05). The {{results of this study suggest}} that when the goal is to construct appliances with high mechanical strength, regardless of weight, such as serial plaster slabs splints for stimulating tissue growth through the application of gradual load, splints made with <b>plaster</b> of Paris <b>bandages</b> with 12 or 14 layers should be preferred. For orthotic devices such as positioning orthotics, the use of 10 layers <b>plaster</b> <b>bandages</b> slab <b>splints</b> is advisable as they were found to have better correlation between mechanical strength and weight in comparison to those made wtih 6 or 8 layers. CONCLUSION: Based on the findings of this study, we suggest the use of 10 layers of plaster of Paris for the construction of orthopedic splints...|$|R

40|$|Previous work {{carried out}} by the authors (Wytch et al., 1988 a) has shown that {{airborne}} dust generated during removal of orthopaedic casts with a power saw could represent a respiratory hazard. Further work has been carried out on all types of <b>splinting</b> <b>bandage</b> currently available in the United Kingdom to assess the potential dust hazard when sawing these materials. It has been shown that although <b>plaster</b> of Paris <b>bandage</b> produces significant concentrations of airborne dust, most of the polyurethane-impregnated fabric bandages generate extremely low levels of dust {{and in the case of}} the non-glass fabrics, the level is insignificant. However, it has been found that all types of <b>splinting</b> <b>bandages</b> generate particles small enough to reach the final divisions of the lungs.

40|$|STUDY OBJECTIVE [...] Comparison of four layer bandage {{system with}} {{traditional}} adhesive <b>plaster</b> <b>bandaging</b> {{in terms of}} (a) compression achieved and (b) healing of venous ulcers. DESIGN [...] Part of larger randomised trial of five different dressings. SETTING [...] Outpatient venous ulcer clinic in university hospital. PATIENTS [...] (a) Pressure exerted by both bandage systems was measured in the same 20 patients. (b) Healing with the four layer bandage was assessed in 148 legs in 126 consecutive patients (mean age 71 (SE 2); range 30 - 96) with chronic venous ulcers that had resisted treatment with traditional bandaging for a mean of 27. 2 (SE 8) months. INTERVENTIONS [...] (a) Four layer bandage system or traditional adhesive <b>plaster</b> <b>bandaging</b> for pressure studies; (b) four layer bandaging applied weekly for studies of healing. END POINTS [...] (a) Comparison of pressures achieved at the ankle for up to one week; (b) complete healing within 12 weeks. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS [...] (a) Four layer bandage produced higher initial pressures at the ankle of 42. 5 (SE 1) mm Hg compared with 29. 8 (1. 8) for the adhesive plaster (p less than 0. 001; 95 % confidence interval 18. 5 to 6. 9). Pressure was maintained for one week with the four layer bandage but fell to 10. 4 (3. 5) mm Hg at 24 hours with adhesive <b>plaster</b> <b>bandaging.</b> (b) After weekly bandaging with the four layer bandage 110 of 48 venous ulcers had healed completely within 12 (mean 6. 3 (0. 4)) weeks. CONCLUSION [...] Sustained compression of over 40 mm Hg achieved with a multilayer bandage results in rapid healing of chronic venous ulcers that have failed to heal in many months of compression at lower pressures with more conventional bandages...|$|R

50|$|Plaster of Paris {{can be used}} to {{impregnate}} gauze bandages to make a sculpting material called <b>plaster</b> <b>bandages.</b> It is used similarly to clay, as it is easily shaped when wet, yet sets into a resilient and lightweight structure. This is the material that was (and sometimes still is) used to make classic plaster orthopedic casts to protect limbs with broken bones, the artistic use having been partly inspired by the medical use (see orthopedic cast). Set Modroc is an early example of a composite material. The hydration of plaster of Paris relies on the reaction of water with the dehydrated or partially hydrated calcium sulfate present in the plaster.|$|R

50|$|A {{variety of}} {{materials}} {{can be used for}} both the molding and casting stages of the lifecasting process. For molding, alginate, and <b>plaster</b> <b>bandages</b> are the most popular materials. Less common mold materials are silicones, waxes, gelatins, and plaster. Plaster and gypsum cement are the most commonly used casting materials, but various clays, concretes, plastics and metals are also in common use.

Since the weight of material deforms the body, if only slightly, this new technique may enable even more perfect work, but will not give the skin texture the above-listed materials do.|$|R

Afterwards this area was uniformly covered with several layers of wet <b>plaster</b> <b>bandages.</b> The covered area included base of the tail, ischeal tuberosities, lower backbone and lower back. The hipbones were not included. The bandages reached approximately 15 cm down the animal’s side. A blow-dryer was used to fasten the drying, before the plaster cast (length: 0.56 m, width: 0.55 m, height: 0.16 - 0.22 m) was lifted of the cow.|$|R
5000|$|Although Segal {{started his}} art {{career as a}} painter, his best known works are cast life-size figures and the [...] the figures inhabited. In place of {{traditional}} casting techniques, Segal pioneered the use of <b>plaster</b> <b>bandages</b> (plaster-impregnated gauze strips designed for making orthopedic casts) as a sculptural medium. In this process, he first wrapped a model with bandages in sections, then removed the hardened forms {{and put them back}} together with more plaster to form a hollow shell. These forms were not used as molds; the shell itself became the final sculpture, including the rough texture of the bandages. Initially, Segal kept the sculptures stark white, but a few years later he began painting them, usually in bright monochrome colors. Eventually he started having the final forms cast in bronze, sometimes patinated white to resemble the original plaster.|$|R

40|$|The {{classical}} <b>plaster</b> <b>bandage</b> was devised {{in the mid}} 19 th century. Until recently, osteoarticular trauma {{has been}} treated mostly by plaster cast immobilisation using plaster of Paris. Synthetic materials have been introduced on the market place in the seventies, {{but they have not}} superseded the traditional plaster of Paris. The more recent thermoplastic materials are used to make splints and orthoses, particularly at the wrist and hand. The present review of the literature confirms that synthetic materials present better physical and mechanical properties than the traditional plaster of Paris. In addition, they are lighter, they are more resistant to humidity, they are more radiotransparent and they generate less dust when removed. However, they are less malleable and cause higher pressure in case of limb edema. Plaster of Paris therefore remains indicated in the acute posttraumatic or postoperative period. This material is also cheaper, but the pecuniary benefit is limited for several reasons, particularly because plaster of Paris is associated with a higher rate of cast replacement.
