40|$|Proceedings of the 2013 Georgia Water Resources Conference, April 10 - 11, 2013, Athens, Georgia. This {{paper will}} chronicle {{the efforts of}} the Gwinnett County Department of Water Resources (DWR) to reduce non-revenue water (NRW) and {{increase}} our understanding of our system. In 2011 the Georgia Environmental Protection Division began requiring submittal of water audits by all municipalities serving a population over 3, 300. The audits are required to be performed using the AWWA Free Water Audit Software. As DWR began filling out the audit and formally tracking NRW, a team was formed to address non-revenue water across every aspect of the audit. The team included members from finance, customer service, field operations, water production, asset management and operations technical services. The team was action-oriented and included the staff that would actually be implementing the work. The team started by brainstorming possible ways to reduce NRW. This included looking for cross-connections to other municipalities, researching parcels in GIS with structures but without a meter, re-establishing breached pressure zones, lowering pressures, replacing inaccurate large meters, performing leak detection and many other initiatives. Over time, action items were aligned with the water audit categories and a formal action plan developed. Like all journeys, some surprising discoveries were made along the way. We had to go through the process of ruling out possibilities before we could see that, even though our system is relatively young, a significant portion of our NRW is real losses. And it’s no wonder. We have over 3, 600 miles of water mains and nearly 239, 000 connections. We also found that our production meters that we thought were over 98 % accurate, were not. This was significantly affecting our NRW calculation. Perhaps the most meaningful result is the number of programs we initiated or improved to ensure we are properly maintaining our system, which in turn will reduce NRW along the way. Some of these programs include <b>production</b> <b>meter</b> testing and calibration, small and large water meter replacement, leak detection, pressure management, district metered areas, valve inspection and financial reporting and auditing. There were also unexpected benefits to our NRW reduction efforts. Simply having a multi-discipline team meeting monthly allowed us {{to learn more about the}} many functions of DWR, and how we can help each other make the Department as a whole more efficient.

40|$|Condensed {{molasses}} solubles (CMS) is the syrupy residue {{left after}} fermentation of molasses for ethanol production. Although it visually looks similar to molasses, it differs in nutrient composition. Condensed molasses solubles has less energy, a higher ash content especially in sulphur (S) and potassium, {{has a higher}} protein and lower dry matter content than molasses. When CMS {{was used as a}} replacement for molasses at an inclusion rate of above 5 %- 10 % to ruminant diets, voluntary feed intake and weight gain decreased while feed conversion ratios increased. It was suggested that a possible reason for the poor performance of animals on CMS containing diets is the high level of S in CMS that could reduce (Se) and copper (Cu) absorption, or could lead to the excess production of H 2 S in the rumen. Another possibility was the lower energy value of CMS leading to inaccurate feed formulations. The goal of this paper was to investigate possible reasons why ruminants consuming diets containing CMS, perform poorly in comparison with ruminants on diets containing molasses. Two trials were conducted to identify reason for lower performance of CMS diets. Criteria associated with production performance of CMS diets were measured on an in vitro and in vivo basis while diets were balanced in protein, energy and moisture. An in vitro trial was conducted to determine the fermentability of diets and gas composition of typical feedlot diets containing different levels of CMS. Four dietary treatments containing 0 %, 5 %, 10 % or 15 % CMS were formulated to be iso-nitrogenous and iso-energetic as well as to have similar dry matter values. Diets with different CMS inclusions were used to measure total gas production, using an automatic gas <b>production</b> <b>meter</b> that regulates gas pressure, temperature and simulates rumen motility. Gas production was measured automatically every five minutes over 42 hours. During this period gas production did not differ (P> 0. 05) at any point of fermentation, and total gas production ranged from 138 mL to 155 mL. The composition of the gas produced supported an effective degradation and indicated no significant difference between treatments. Results indicated that {{there was no significant difference}} in hydrogen sulphide gas (H 2 S), methane or carbon dioxide concentrations in the gas. The similar H 2 S gas production between treatments indicates that, although S was higher in CMS containing diets, H 2 S production by sulphur-reducing bacteria was low when pH was regulated above a pH level of 6. Analysis of the four treatment diets indicated that the TMR s contain the same ash content, especially that of S, as in the feed formulation. The variation in composition highlighted the need to establish consistent nutrient parameters for CMS composition in order to formulate diets accurately. From the in vitro trial it was concluded that there was no difference in gas production, and therefore fermentability, between diets containing CMS or molasses. An in vivo trial was conducted to determine the effect of CMS inclusion at 0 %, 5 %, 10 % or 15 % in feedlot diets of newly weaned bull calves from a mixture of beef breeds. The diets were formulated to be iso-energetic, iso-nitrogenous with a constant dry matter content. One hundred weaners were allocated to the four treatments, and each treatment consisted of five replicates with five bulls per replicate. The weaners were fed for a period of 112 days during which feed intake was measured every week and body weight every second week. Biweekly body weight and feed intake were measured to calculate feed conversion ratio (FCR). There were no significant differences in the body weight, feed intake or FCR of the treatments at any point during the feeding period. The results indicated a high FCR compared to standard feedlot diets, suggesting that the experimental diets contained lower energy content than standard feedlot diets. The results indicated that when diets containing CMS were corrected and balanced for energy and protein, CMS have the potential to replace molasses in feedlot total mixed rations. However, high moisture content diluted nutrients, causing a higher FCR, thus reduced the efficiency of nutrient utilization in the diet. Liver samples of all 100 bulls were collected to determine the effect of S of diets containing CMS on the hepatic Se and Cu concentrations in the cattle. The analysis of trial diets indicated that dietary S did not increase as expected, and therefore results were expected that there was no significant difference in liver Se and Cu concentrations between the treatments, and both Se and Cu concentrations indicated adequate intake of these elements. The in vivo and in vitro trials indicated that CMS has potential to replace molasses, but more research is necessary, especially in composition variation and to decrease FCR in more practical feedlot conditions.

In the last decade, increasing applications of information technology (IT) within power industry has become a signifi-cant reality. As distributed power networks are gaining importance and renewables are getting a bigger ratio within en-ergy production, Smart Grid applications have become essential, especially due to the intermittent nature of renewable energy resources. Smart Grid is a sustainable energy system that measures, checks, and controls the generation, trans-mission, and consumption of electrical energy in grids on all voltage levels. Smart Grid experts are driving forward the development of effective communication and information technologies for the build-up of intelligent power supply networks.
