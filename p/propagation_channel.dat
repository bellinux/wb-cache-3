Tjhung It is explained that a correlated {{tapped delay line}} model needs to be assumed for transmission performance estimation using Rake combining, even though the <b>propagation</b> <b>channel</b> itself can be characterised as a wide sense stationary uncorrelated scattering channel. Fading correlation between different tap gains can be computed by taking into account the transmit and receive chip pulse shaping filters. A simple example, showing how correlation affects performance estimation in Rake combining, is presented, assuming a two-path Rayleigh fading <b>propagation</b> <b>channel.</b> Problem: In mobile wireless communications, owing to reflection by obstacles such as buildings, there are many propagation paths between a transmitter and a receiver. If the time delays of multipaths cannot be neglected, the <b>propagation</b> <b>channel</b> is called a frequency selective channel. Assuming a wide sense stationary uncorrelated scattering (WSSUS) channel, the equivalent lowpass impulse response of the <b>propagation</b> <b>channel</b> at time t, owing to an excitation at time t – τ, can be expressed as [1] where Ω(τ) = Σ m= 0 E[|ξc,m(t) | 2]δ(τ – τc,m) is the power delay profile of the <b>propagation</b> <b>channel</b> (seen when the measurement bandwidth is infinite).
