However, recent amygdala research suggests that BDNF is required for consolidation (but not reconsolidation) whereas the transcription factor and immediate early gene Zif268 is required for reconsolidation but not consolidation. [...] A similar double dissociation between Zif268 for reconsolidation and BDNF for consolidation {{was found in the}} hippocampus for fear conditioning. However, not all memory tasks show this double dissociation, such as object recognition memory.|$|E

After Flora had received a call by the European University Institute (EUI) in Florence (Italy) in 1979, {{the expansion of the}} West European welfare states after World War II moved to the foreground of a large comparative research project titled: Growth to Limits: The Western European Welfare States Since World War II. When consciously reversing the title of the famous book Limits to Growth by Donella H. Meadows and Dennis L. Meadows, published in 1972, not only a gimmick in order to create publicity was found, but the central hypothesis of the project was formulated as well: with the extension of the catalogue of life risks secured by the welfare state, and the comprehensive inclusion of almost all population groups in the welfare state programs, the welfare state has attained its limit of extension and ends in a <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation.</b> Among Flora's most important collaborators in this project, carried through in Florence with numerous doctoral candidates from the member states of the European Union, was mainly Jens Alber, who had already collaborated with him in the HIWED project.|$|E

With these launches {{he became the}} first western publisher of periodical magazines behind the then still existing “Iron Curtain”. The big success as well as the positive perspectives after the political change made Jürg Marquard invest dynamically in Central European markets and expand his activities - including the acquisition of daily newspapers in Hungary and Poland, as well as launching new magazines. In 1999, during the process of a strategic re-orientation, Jürg Marquard focused his activities on the premium magazine segment and therefore streamlined his portfolio: The youth and music titles were sold to Axel Springer, the Hungarian newspapers to Ringier and the Polish printing house to Baring Private Equity Partners. Following this <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> Marquard Media again expanded by launching various new magazines as well as taking over and integrating VIPress (PLAYBOY und VOYAGE) in Poland.

40|$|The {{mechanisms}} underlying cannabinoid {{impairment of}} fear memory is not clear. This {{study investigated the}} effects of the synthetic cannabinoid HU 210 and the endocannabinoid hydrolysis inhibitor JZL 195 on fear memory following contextual fear conditioning (CFC; an animal model of fear). The long-term depression (LTD) -blocking peptide Tat-GluR 2 was utilized to investigate whether the expression of cannabinoid-induced LTD (CB-LTD) is required for the cannabinoid impairment <b>of</b> acquisition and <b>consolidation</b> <b>of</b> contextual fear memory. HU 210 reduced freezing throughout the test <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> the acquisition protocol, which was not affected by pre-administration of Tat-GluR 2.

HU 210 did not affect freezing during the test <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> the retrieval protocol. Thus, these results suggest that HU 210 impairs acquisition and consolidation, but not retrieval of contextual fear memory, and that in vivo CB-LTD expression is required for HU 210 impairment <b>of</b> the <b>consolidation,</b> but not acquisition, of contextual fear memory. We also observed that HU 210 and JZL 195 do not facilitate the acquisition of contextual fear memory extinction...|$|R

40|$|The {{size and}} shape of bulk solid {{particles}} is an important factor which affects its flow and consolidation behaviour. In this thesis, the properties of sorbitol size fractions ranging from 80 to 500 µm were studied by using helium pycnometry, optical microscopy and changes in the volume of the powder bed during the initial <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation.</b> A significant influence (p ≤ 0. 01) of the sample drying on the density of solid sorbitol was detected. Porosity of sorbitol size fractions ranged from 56. 6 to 62. 3 %; with the increasing in the particle size the porosity decreased. For the consolidation of the powder bed, the first 10 taps were critical when the volume decreased most dramatically. This is particularly evident for the size fraction of 100 µm and 158 µm...|$|E

This appeals to the control theoretic literature, and permits the specification of ‘master trajectories’ of key variables over time like output, debt, dividend and capital. Two trajectories (for cheap debt, and cheap equity, respectively) illustrate this type of analysis, showing how financial structure can vary over time, involving <b>phases</b> <b>of</b> growth, <b>consolidation</b> and stationarity. From this perspective, six papers on small firm dynamics and finance are reviewed. Issues addressed include: credit constraints (funding shortages), wealth as collateral, financial structure, target income modelling of start-up, and bank lending during financial liberalisation...|$|R
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{recurring}} political, economic, and environmental crises require questioning and re-evaluating dominant pathways of human development. However, {{political and economic}} frameworks seem to encompass deeply rooted resistance to fundamental changes (e. g., global financial crisis, climate change negotiations). In an effort to repair the system as fast as possible, those paradigms, mechanisms, and structures that led into the crisis are perpetuated. Instead of preserving conventional patterns and focusing on continuity, crises {{could be used as}} an opportunity for learning, adapting, and entering onto more sustainable pathways. However, there are different ways not only of arguing for sustainable pathways of development but also of conceptualizing continuity and change. By focusing on institutions, we illustrate the tension between the concepts of continuity and change, how they interact, and how they build or degrade institutional resilience. The analysis draws on empirical research in South Africa and Uzbekistan, which were locked in persistent regimes over decades. Faced with the challenge to transform, Uzbekistan chose a pathway of institutional continuity, while South Africa opted for comprehensive reforms and a high level of change. Based on these case studies, we illustrate {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} institutional continuity and change. Elements of institutional continuity during times of transformation include preserving key institutions, which define how the rules are made; maintaining social memory; providing transparency of reform processes and allowing them time to take effect. Elements of institutional change required during <b>phases</b> <b>of</b> <b>consolidation</b> include flexible legislation; regular reviews; and adaptation of legislation during and after implementation...|$|R
40|$|The most {{significant}} {{development in the}} whole field of labor law {{during the past decade}} was the growing willingness of the courts to modify the traditional doctrine of employment-at-will. Applying either tort or contract theory, or both, judges in some thirty jurisdictions declared their readiness to blunt the worst rigors of the rule that an employment contract of indefinite duration can be terminated by either party at any time for any reason.

Economic growth remained sluggish throughout the period, but the recession expected by many as a consequence of restrictive fiscal policies did not occur. This is due to a number of reasons: the favourable development of the world economy constituted the most important factor of growth during the <b>phase</b> <b>of</b> fiscal <b>consolidation.</b> Some countries, which were pursuing particularly restrictive policies, devalued their currencies by a significant margin and were thus able to compensate declining domestic demand through rising exports. Given the substantial drop of the saving ratio, the reduction of household disposable income did not result in a corresponding decline of consumption. The lowering of interest rates in the period of transition to European Monetary Union considerably eased the burden of interest payments on government debt for a number of countries.
