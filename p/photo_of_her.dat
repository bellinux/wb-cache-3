5|$|On 23 June 2013, Shakira {{released}} a teaser {{of the commercial}} for the fragrance along with a <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> posing with two cheetahs. A full version of the commercial was released later. It begins with Shakira, dressed in a dark burgundy gown, coming across a pair of cheetahs in an arid desert region. The two animals, alarmed, commence running towards her {{in an effort to}} attack her. Shakira responds by raising her hand, which prompts the cheetahs to abruptly stop in their tracks. They are later seen prowling around her while she is standing atop a rock and a bottle of Wild Elixir is then shown placed on a log of wood. The official website of the perfume also features a game made to promote the fragrance and Shakira's Barefoot Foundation.|$|E
5|$|Ono {{released}} her first solo album, Yoko Ono/Plastic Ono Band, in 1970 as a companion piece to Lennon's better-known John Lennon/Plastic Ono Band. The two albums also had companion covers: Ono's featured a <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> leaning on Lennon, and Lennon's {{a photo of}} him leaning on Ono. Her album included raw, harsh vocals, which bore a similarity with sounds in nature (especially those made by animals) and free jazz techniques used by wind and brass players. Performers included Ornette Coleman, other renowned free jazz performers, and Ringo Starr. Some songs on the album consisted of wordless vocalizations, in a style that would influence Meredith Monk and other musical artists who have used screams and vocal noise in lieu of words. The album reached No. 182 on the US charts.|$|E

Gilly stands on a ladder outside and begs her to come out, however she tells him she's ready to die and walks back into the flames. Gilly deals with his grief by becoming angry that Steph has 'left' him. After Rhys tries to comfort him, Gilly goes into Steph's room and trashes it after seeing that she has still kept her <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> and Max Cunningham (Matt Littler) on their wedding day, placed on a table. Gilly argues with Steph's family as they blame him for not saving her and disagree on the funeral arrangements. Frankie then tells him that Steph had never loved him and that Max would have done anything to save Steph from the fire, making him further deeply upset and angry.

5|$|The video {{progresses}} as Carey, now on {{the streets}} of New York, is walking towards the hotel. As she begins to notice the bellhop, dressed in the sweats, pursuing her, she turns around in haste and begins jolting back to the hotel while holding several shopping bags. Additionally, scenes of the stalker's home are shown again, this time more elaborately, with his walls covered with portraits of the singer, as well as album covers and lights around a large <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>her.</b> As the video comes to an end, she waits for her limousine to arrive at the hotel. However, before she gets inside, she notices the stalker attempting to take a picture of her. She then looks directly into his camera and gives a smile. The video then shows him again, still attempting to take a picture, right before a bus hits him. Carey gasps in shock after witnessing the incident. The remix video for the song features the same story-line and footage, only showing inter-cut scenes of Carey dressed in a white ensemble, while laying on a vintage wooden table.

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{sitting on a}} couch in an apartment's living room, holding a {{heart-shaped}} locket in her hand. The next scene shows Clarkson in the bathroom where she fixes {{her face in the}} mirror, she opens the medicine cabinet and tossing all the pills in the medicine cabinet over her shoulder and messing all the bathroom items on the floor, squirting the toothpaste into the sink. When she gets to a container of birth control pills, she turns on the water in the sink, snaps the pills out, and drops them down the drain. Clarkson then starts to take other items; she throws a container of makeup powder spray in the air and smears a container of facial mud mask on the wall. During the chorus, Clarkson and her band perform the song for a dancing crowd in a club. After the first chorus, Clarkson walks into a room full of closets. She cuts up dresses, rifling through the closets and pulling out clothes, destroying them and singing in a pile of them. After the second chorus, she walks into a bedroom and begins to tear the pillow on the bed, filling the room with feathers. The scenes of Clarkson singing with her band then alternate with a montage of her destroying the apartment, breaks the glass window from the door, breaks the vase, television, clock, fridge, lights, microwave, phone, furniture and the chair. Later, Clarkson takes a framed <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> ex-boyfriend with another girl in the living room, before pushing a tall CD rack over. She then smashes the framed photo through a glass table, breaking it in half. Having decimated the apartment, Clarkson walks out the door and down the hallway with a hat on her head, just as her ex-boyfriend appears with his girlfriend, walking arm in arm. Clarkson hides her face as she walks away from them. The final scene shows the couple seeing their damaged apartment in shock and the scene of the locket swinging.|$|E

5|$|The {{music video}} begins with Clarkson {{standing}} in a room wearing a white wedding dress. Holding a bouquet of red rose, she is surrounded by her bridesmaids as they prepare for her wedding. She sits down on a sofa and sees a wedding <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fiancé with another woman as a storm begins to form outside. The bridesmaids try to close the windows but fail so they {{run out of the}} room leaving Clarkson alone, who is seen dropping the bouquet of rose as well as the wedding photo from her hands onto the floor. The next scene shows Clarkson walking down the aisle in a church wearing a black dress. She sees a bride standing at the altar with her fiancé, getting married. When she draws the veil of the bride, she realizes that the bride is the woman from the photo. Clarkson, who is now wearing a white wedding dress, runs out of the church and into a dark swamp. A montage of Clarkson singing with her band in a dark swamp is shown alternately with scenes of Clarkson running in the forest and laying on the ground. Clarkson is also seen standing inside an abandoned house, wearing a voluminous black dress. As the rain starts to fall, Clarkson finally collapsed, kneeling on the ground while looking at and being comforted by her other self who is singing with the band. The scene shifts to a present day, where Clarkson is standing at the altar, exchanging vows with her fiancé. Before he puts the ring on her finger, she looks at the guests and notices that the woman from the photo is among the audience. She sees her fiancé exchanging a smile with the woman as the woman blows him a kiss. Clarkson then reaches for the ring and throws it at her fiancé, before running away from the altar. She throws her wedding bouquet into the lap of the woman and shoves her way past the wedding guests who are trying to stop her from leaving. The video ends with Clarkson stepping out the doors into the bright sunlight.|$|E

25|$|The {{recording}} {{sessions for}} McKay's debut album Get Away from Me {{took place in}} August 2003 with Geoff Emerick as producer.

25|$|The {{album cover}} {{contributed to the}} image of Jones as a stylish beret-wearing beatnik. Jones had said the {{inspiration}} of it was from a <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> father (an aspiring musician and waiter) in a similar pose, lighting a cigarette while sitting on a beach towel at a Chicago beach along Lake Michigan, near where the family lived. Although Donna Summer had already been wearing berets and singer-songwriter Joni Mitchell wore one for the album cover of her 1976 album Hejira, it was Jones Parisian-boho jazz sensibility that finally popularized it, propelling as a mainstay of hipster chic and (perhaps unintentionally) branding her image in the process. Despite Jones' beautiful looks and street gamine wildness, she would recall that people seemed to only recognize her in public when she was wearing the beret. The album cover photography and design was by Norman Seeff.|$|E
25|$|In October 2002, Myskina had {{a series}} of photos taken for GQ {{magazine}} by the photographer Mark Seliger for a spread in the October 2002 edition of GQ, in which one approved <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> fully clothed was published. After she won the French Open in 2004, some photographs from the shoot, in which she appeared topless, were published in the Russian magazine Medved (Bear). In August 2004, she filed an US$8 million lawsuit against GQ for allowing her topless photographs to appear in Medved without her consent. On 19 June 2005, U.S. District Judge Michael Mukasey, later United States Attorney General, ruled that Myskina could not stop the distribution of the topless photos, because she had signed a release. Myskina had claimed that she did not understand the photo release form and that she was not fluent in English at the time.|$|E
25|$|Islamic fundamentalists {{spoke out}} against {{the idea of a}} woman leader, {{claiming}} that it was un-Islamic. Their propaganda foregrounded what they presented as her un-Islamic behaviour, including a <b>photo</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> dancing in a Parisian nightclub. Zia loyalists and Islamic fundamentalists united to form a new political party, Islami Jamhoori Ittehad (IJI), which was funded by the Inter-Services Intelligence (ISI). The ISI also engaged in vote rigging in an attempt to secure an IJI victory. Despite these attempts, Bhutto led the PPP to victory in the election, taking 93 of the 205 contested seats. The IJI took only 54 seats. This meant that the PPP had the largest number of seats, although not a clear majority. Both the PPP and IJI courted independent MPs hoping to woo them to their side, and unsuccessful attempts were also made by the country's right-wing forces to convince some of the elected PPP parliamentarians to switch allegiance to the IJI.|$|E
