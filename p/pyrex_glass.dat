25|$|The {{successful}} photochemical {{synthesis of}} krypton difluoride was first reported by Lucia V. Streng in 1963. It was next reported in 1975 by J. Slivnik. The photochemical {{process for the}} production of KrF2 involves the use of UV light and can produce under ideal circumstances 1.22g/h. The ideal wavelengths to use are in the range of 303–313nm. Harder UV radiation is detrimental to the production of KrF2. Using <b>Pyrex</b> <b>glass</b> or Vycor or quartz will significantly increase yield because they all block harder UV light. In a series of experiments performed by S. A Kinkead et al., it was shown that a quartz insert (UV cut off of 170nm) produced on average 158mg/h, Vycor 7913 (UV cut off of 210nm) produced on average 204mg/h and Pyrex 7740 (UV cut off of 280nm) produced on average 507mg/h. It is clear from these results that higher-energy ultraviolet light reduces the yield significantly. The ideal circumstances for the production KrF2 by a photochemical process appear to occur when krypton is a solid and fluorine is a liquid, which occur at 77K. The biggest problem with this method is that it requires the handling of liquid F2 and the potential of it being released if it becomes overpressurized.|$|E

40|$|The {{development}} of a new sealant for molten carbonate fuel cells (MCFC) requires a study of the attack of molten carbonates on selected materials. Silica and <b>Pyrex</b> <b>glasses</b> have better corrosion resistance against molten carbonates than other glasses, but they have unsuitable thermal expansion coefficients. Comparisons have also been made between borosilicate glasses of suitable thermal expansion for sealants for MCFC and silica and <b>Pyrex</b> <b>glasses.</b> The corrosion kinetics in molten carbonates follows two limiting relations and involves two corrosion mechanisms. The weight loss varied linearly with time, indicating a dissolution of the glass network at short times.

The data obtained are of sufficient quality that they can be used to test the distributions of borate and borosilicate superstructural units predicted by the thermodynamics-based Model of Associated Solutions. The model predicts the dominant boron-containing chemical groupings in <b>Pyrex</b> (R) <b>glass</b> to be those associated with B(2) O(3) and sodium tetraborate (with smaller amounts of sodium triborate, sodium diborate, sodium pentaborate, danburite and reedmergnerite). Excellent agreement is found between model and experiment provided the (11) B peaks with isotropic chemical shifts of - 1. 4 ppm and 0. 5 ppm are assigned to B 4 species from borosilicate units ([B(OSi) (4) ] and [B(OSi) (3) (OB) ]) and borate superstructural units (mainly triborate rings with some pentaborate and diborate) respectively. The peaks with isotropic shifts of 14 ppm and 18. 1 ppm are then assigned to B 3 in borate superstructural units (mainly triborate and pentaborate along with connecting B 3) and boroxol rings respectively. The assignments of the DOR NMR peaks, are supported by the presence of cross-peaks in (11) B spin-diffusion DOR NMR spectra which can be used to develop a structural model in which B(2) O(3) -like regions are linked, via borate and borosilicate superstructural units, to the majority silica network.
