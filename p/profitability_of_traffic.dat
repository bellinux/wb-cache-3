Laws regarding commercial sex influence the <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> <b>trafficking.</b> Using cross country data we show that <b>trafficking</b> <b>of</b> persons for commercial sexual exploitation is least prevalent in countries where prostitution is illegal, most prevalent in countries where prostitution is legalized, and in between in those countries where prostitution is legal but procuring illegal.

40|$|International {{trafficking}} in humans for sexual exploitation is an eco- nomic activity driven by profit motives. Laws regarding commercial sex influence the <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> <b>trafficking</b> and may thus affect the inflow <b>of</b> <b>trafficking</b> to a country. Using two recent sources of European cross country data {{we show that}} <b>trafficking</b> <b>of</b> persons for commercial sexual exploitation (as proxied by the data sets we are using) is least prevalent in countries where prostitution is illegal, most prevalent in countries where prostitution is legalized, and in between in those countries where prostitution is legal but procuring illegal. Case studies of two countries (Norway and Sweden) that have criminalized buying sex support {{the possibility of a}} causal link from harsher prostitution laws to reduced trafficking. Although the data do not allow us to infer robust causal inference, the results suggest that criminalizing procuring, or going further and criminalizing buying and/ or selling sex, may reduce the amount <b>of</b> <b>trafficking</b> to a country...|$|R
25|$|Organized criminals can {{generate}} {{up to several}} thousand dollars per day from one trafficked girl, and the Internet has further increased <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> sex <b>trafficking</b> and child trafficking. With faster access to a wider clientele, more sexual encounters can be scheduled. Victims and clients, according to a New York City report on sex trafficking in minors, increasingly use the Internet to meet customers. Because of protests, Craigslist has since closed its adult services section. According to authorities, Backpage is now the main source for advertising trafficking victims. Investigators also frequently browse online classified ads to identify potential underage girls who are trafficked.|$|R
40|$|Wheel {{reprofiling}} {{costs for}} freight vehicles {{are a major}} issue in Sweden, reducing the <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> freight <b>traffic</b> operations and therefore hindering the modal shift needed for achieving reduced emissions. In order to understand the damage modes in freight vehicles, uniform wear prediction with Archard's wear law has been studied in a two-axle timber transport wagon, and simulation results have been compared to measurements. Challenges of wheel wear prediction in freight wagons are discussed, including the influence of block brakes and switches and crossings. The latter have a major influence on the profile evolution of this case study, so specific simulations are performed and a thorough discussion is carried out. QC 20140617 </p...|$|R

40|$|Although much {{attention}} {{has been focused on}} the growth <b>of</b> intermodal <b>traffic</b> over the past decade, manifest freight or carload traffic is a major revenue generator for railroads. In 2004, the top four commodity categories in terms of revenue per carload averaged $ 2, 971 per carload compared to an average of $ 770 for intermodal carloads. The high potential <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> carload <b>traffic</b> suggests that railroads should try to further grow this segment <b>of</b> <b>traffic,</b> especially in an era of limited railway capacity. To do this, they must meet the increasing logistical needs of their customers by providing more consistent, reliable service than has previously been the case for carload traffic. The classification terminal is a key determinant in the service reliability of manifest freight. Terminal performance also impacts network efficiency. A regression analysis for six Class I railroads showed a statistically significant relationship between average system-wide terminal dwell and average manifest train speed. As average dwell time increased, average manifest train speed decreased. The R 2 values ranged from 20. 7 % to 34. 7 %. With demand for rail transportation service expected to continue to grow, increasing network efficiency will be vital to reliably handle the traffic...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} internal and external factors on the <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> all full-fledged Islamic banks in Malaysia. Additionally, this study examines the robustness of results by using the financial crisis of 2008 - 2009 as a control variable. The study uses regression analysis to examine the data from 16 Islamic banks in Malaysia for the period from 2008 to 2012. The results suggest that a high equity-to-asset ratio significantly increases the <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> Islamic banks, while negatively affecting the return on equities. Simultaneously, an increase in total expenses leads to high returns on assets and return on equities. However, an increase in deposit-to-asset and loan-to-asset ratios does not significantly affect the <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> Islamic banks. The taxes imposed on banks significantly decrease their profits. Additionally, the results indicate a positive and significant relationship between the concentration and the <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> the banks. Moreover, {{an increase in the}} inflation rate negatively affects the <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> Islamic banks.

The objectives of the study were, to ascertain whether the use of internal equity (retained profits) was positively or negatively related to the size, age and <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> the firm. Furthermore the study examined if the use of external equity (capital from owners) was negatively or positively related to the age, size and <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> the firm. Finally the study wanted to establish if the use of debt was positively or negatively related to the size, age and <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> the firm. To achieve these objectives, the study hypothesised that age, size and profitability amongst other factors were determinants of capital structure. The study further hypothesised {{that the use of}} retained profits by SMEs was negatively related with age, size and <b>profitability</b> <b>of</b> the firm.
