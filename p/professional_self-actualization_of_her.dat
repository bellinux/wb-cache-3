40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (pages 73 - 84) This {{study was}} undertaken {{to determine if}} the degree of dogmatism or authoritarianism of a coach was related to the change in <b>self-actualization</b> <b>of</b> <b>her</b> female intercollegiate players. The coaches and varsity players of the five universities in Conference I of the Southern California Women's Intercollegiate Tennis League served as subjects. All subjects were administered the Personal Orientation Inventory early in the tennis season. At {{the end of the season}} the Personal Orientation Inventory was again administered to the players and the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale was administered to the coaches. The players' Personal Orientation Inventory scores were grouped on the basis of their coach???s score on the Rokeach Dogmatism Scale. The Mann-Whitney U test was used to determine the relationship between the degree of dogmatism of a coach and the change toward self -actualization <b>of</b> <b>her</b> players. There was a small, but statistically significant difference between the degrees of authoritarianism of the five coaches. The analysis of the data indicated that the mean change toward self-actualization tended to be greater for the players of a less dogmatic coach. Other significant findings indicated that there was a high correlation between the degree of dogmatism and the level <b>of</b> <b>self-actualization</b> <b>of</b> the coaches. Based on the findings and within the limitations of this research, the following conclusion was drawn: the female intercollegiate tennis players of the less authoritarian coaches tended to have a greater change toward self-actualization. Although the relationship was statistically significant, this relationship must be considered only as a possible tendency at this time due to the small differences in the scores, the small number of subjects, and the lack of additional research in this area. Furthermore, because this study examined only one segment of the entire coach-player relationship, it was felt that additional research in this area is needed before any far-reaching conclusions can be made...|$|R

40|$|The article {{highlights}} {{the problem of}} the role of professional identity in self-realization of psychologists- teachers. Within the frame of a system-defined approach the research identifies and describes the individual- typological features of the phenomena interesting to us. The works that focus on the study of self-realization are subjected to the analysis, as the result it is noted that in this field there are still gaps in the understanding of this issue. Thus, the study {{from the perspective of the}} influence of professional identity on the successful self-realization of the personality is recognized as relevant. In the framework of this study the following assumptions are put forward: there is a relationship between the professional identity and successful self- realization of the personality; the level of formation of professional identity has an impact on the success of personality self-realization; the professional identity not fully formed acts as a barrier for creativity, activity, internality and constructive self- realization; fully formed professional identity provides a high success rate of self-realization. The purpose of this study was to investigate the features of self- realization and professional identity of psychologists-teachers. For the study, we used “Multidimensional questionnaire of personality self-realization” (MQPS) by S. I. Kudinov, for the study of professional identity the following methods were used: “Professional identity-marginalism” questionnaire by E. P. Ermolaeva and Methods of measuring professional identity (MMPI) by L. B. Schneider. The results obtained were subjected to quantitative analysis.

40|$|Purpose. Mechanization and {{computerization}} {{of modern}} society causes {{dramatic changes in}} the forms and methods of teaching. Their uniqueness lies in bringing computer technology and the Internet for education, causing formation of extreme polar social assessments of their impact on the harmonious development of children and adolescents, on possibility <b>of</b> <b>self-actualization</b> <b>of</b> natural potentials of teenagers whose minds are often on the brink of real and virtual worlds. Methodology is caused by interdisciplinary approach, involving not only the use of scientific methods such as analysis, synthesis and generalization, but also the methods of comparative analysis and analogies which were used to solve specific research problems related to the study of influence of computer technology and created through it virtual reality on <b>self-actualization</b> <b>of</b> teenagers. Originality lays in the explication of conceptual philosophical core to study the impact of virtual reality on <b>self-actualization</b> <b>of</b> teenagers and to prove possibility of differentiation of such concepts as "actualization" and "self-actualization" for the study of specific features of teenagers’ development. Such the approach provides a theoretical justification of major conflicts of personality development in adolescence and clearly demonstrates the threats that virtual reality brings to the process of person formation and development of mankind. Conclusions. Due to high levels of emotional stress in teenagers’ worldview, {{there is no evidence to}} suggest that they are at the level <b>of</b> <b>self-actualization.</b> The latter is possible only in the case of organic inclusion of adolescents in real socio-cultural processes, while their simulation in the virtual world can lead to inhibition of personality development...|$|R
40|$|The article {{considers}} {{the issues of}} a personality’s self-realization and self-actualization under current educational standards required {{in the time of}} impetuous development in informative technologies. The practical aspect of the article describes self-realization and <b>self-actualization</b> <b>of</b> a person as their social and useful activity, interdiscipline approach, it is characterised by interdependence of an individual and their social environment apart with the self-realization of a personality in educational process. Evidently, being a substantial ca-tegory of vital «self-assertion», it should be thought over in categories <b>of</b> <b>self-actualization</b> and self-realization. So, self-realization {{is considered to be a}} social process which continues all conscientious life.

40|$|One {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between the <b>self-actualization</b> <b>of</b> certain selected teachers and their concern for their students as perceived by the students. A second purpose was to examine the relationship of age and years of teaching experience of the teachers and their levels <b>of</b> <b>self-actualization.</b> A third purpose was to determine whether the teachers being studied differed significantly in their self-actualizing levels from other adult groups. The subjects in the study were fifty-six volunteer teachers of grades three through six from one school district in central Indiana. The intact classes of the participating teachers comprised the student sample of 1, 234 grades three through six from one school district in central Indiana. For the purpose <b>of</b> measuring <b>self-actualization</b> <b>of</b> teachers the Personal Orientation Inventory (POI), consisting of two major scales, Time Competence and Inner Direction, and ten sub-scales, was selected. Only the major scales were used in this study. Student perception of teacher concern was measured by the Student Estimate of Teacher Concern (SETC), Form B. This instrument consists of twenty-eight items designed to measure three major components of concern: recognition of need, understanding of need, and help given to the student. Teachers completed the POI in the Spring, 1975, and their classes were administered the SETC in January, 1976. The SETC was administered orally by the investigator as students recorded their answers. Data about age and years of teaching experience of the teachers were obtained from the teachers themselves. Analyses of the data were carried out by three correlational statistical procedures: multiple regression, canonical correlation, and multivariate analysis of variance, using the Hotelling T 2 statistic. According to the levels set for determining concerned teachers in the study, all the teachers were perceived as concerned by their students except one. Out of fifty-six teachers studied, twenty-one met the criteria set for self-actualized teachers, having Time Competence raw scores above 18 and Inner Direction raw scores above 87, and having standard scores above 50. Thirty-five teachers had scores below these criteria, yet all except one received scores on the SETC above 15 in raw scores and above 50 on the standard score. No significant relationship was found between levels <b>of</b> <b>self-actualization</b> <b>of</b> the teachers in this study and their students' perception of their concern. These results indicate that it is not appropriate to use teachers' levels <b>of</b> <b>self-actualization</b> to predict student perception of teacher concern in this study. Approximately 37 ½ % of the teachers were self-actualizing, according to the levels set in this study. Some of the youngest people in this study were the most highly actualized, as measured by the POI, and some of the oldest teachers in this study were the least actualized. No significant relationship was found between the age and years of teaching experience of the teachers in this study and their levels <b>of</b> <b>self-actualization.</b> These results indicate that age and years of teaching experience should not be used to predict the self-actualizing levels of the teachers in this study. An older teacher may not be assumed to be more highly actualized merely because of age. Neither may a younger teacher be presumed to be low in self-actualization. It appears to this writer that other factors not measured in this study are in operation. According to this study, the profession of teaching did not make any significant difference in the <b>self-actualization</b> levels <b>of</b> the teachers, as determined by the POI. There is no reason to suppose that these teachers are different from any other adults in their self-actualization, as measured by the POI. No significant difference was found between the teachers in this study and the adults in the norming population of the POI. These results show that the teachers in this study are typical adults, and that the altruistic nature of their profession does not notably affect their self-actualization, as measured in this study. Self-actualization, according to this study, does not exist more among teachers than in other adult groups. According to the findings of this study, the SETC measure failed to discriminate among teachers on the construct of teacher concern. Sex of teachers and age and sex of students may have been factors, since the SETC was previously used primarily by female junior and senior high school students to rate female home economics teachers. This study was the first to use the SETC with students in elementary school. Based on the findings of this study, it is recommended that <b>self-actualization</b> <b>of</b> teachers be further studied with relationship to the age of the teachers, using larger samples than in the present study. It is further recommended that the construct <b>of</b> <b>self-actualization</b> or psychological health be considered an important criterion of future selection of prospective teachers. A third recommendation is that evaluations of teachers be based on peer evaluation, student evaluation, self-evaluation, and administrative evaluation. Thesis (D. Ed. ...|$|R
