40|$|Launched in October 2010, Instagram {{has become}} one of the popular mobile based photo-sharing platforms. Hashtags on Instagram are {{normally}} used for classifying <b>post</b> <b>category,</b> adding detailed information, building social connection and expressing feeling or experiences. Based on the limited study on hashtag usage and expanding existing online gender behavior literature, this study applied uses and gratification theory to investigate gender difference in hashtag use on Instagram. It also classifies hashtags into informative and emotional, as well as positive and negative hashtags. The population of the study was photo posts on Instagram with #Malaysianfood. Using content analysis technique methods, photos posted using #Malaysianfood were selected as the sample of this study. The results showed a significant difference between male and female in informative and emotional hashtags selection. Compared to female, male uses more informative hashtags in their post. Besides, this study found that compared to male, female uses more positive hashtag in the post. This study found a strong and positive relationship between number of hashtags and number of followers, as well as number of hashtag and number of ‘likes’. Academically, this study adds to the limited literature on Instagram and application of hashtags. This study also suggests a new method to measure satisfaction using hashtags from users. From industry perspective, findings of this study could assist the restaurant operators for better understanding of customers’ needs and promotional activitie...|$|E

During this time, Coffee Party Facebook page administrators posted 872 parent posts that received 152, 762 comments from group members. Utilizing our previously established method (Mascaro 2 ̆ 6 Goggins, 2011) for extracting and analyzing electronic trace data, we constructed a weighted social network from the parent posts and associated comments. We measured network centralization and total post activity for the entire network and identified individuals with high betweenness centrality across three dimensions: 1) Time, 2) Parent <b>Post</b> <b>Category</b> and 3) Specific Parent Posts. We report three key findings. First, the structure, centralization and leadership within the network differ in four key time periods: the time preceding the midterm election, {{the week of the}} midterm election, the time immediately following the midterm election and the time period when the new Congress was sworn in. Second, the Coffee Party Administrators act as agenda setters with the parent posts, but show significant variation in their comment participation over time. Third, participants in the discourse alter their discourse role according to specific parent post and category.

40|$|Abstract {{copyright}} ADRN {{and data}} collection copyright owner. The Teachers in Scotland Census is an annual dataset collection of teachers in all publicly funded schools in Scotland, including primary, secondary and special Schools. The main purpose of the Census is to obtain accurate data on staff and staffing levels {{which can be used}} for monitoring and to support evidence-based policy-making. The Scottish Government hold electronic records of the Teachers in Scotland Census since it started in 2003. Numbers on teachers in Scotland prior to 2003 was collected using a separate School Census. The Teachers in Scotland Census data are captured in the month of September each year from schools management information systems. Data are then transferred from local authorities securely to ScotXed for validation and checking before it can be used for statistical purposes. Each census contains approximately 60, 000 teacher records. The data are collected as at the week commencing Census Date in September of each year, and they are then available from December in the same year (previously in March of the following year). A wide variety of information is collected on each teacher and includes their General Teaching Council (GTC) number, gender, ethnicity, nationality, date of birth, class contact time, whether {{they are part of a}} head teacher programme, grade, status, entry to <b>post</b> <b>category,</b> and reasons for leaving last post. The Teachers in Scotland Census provides records on all teachers in all publicly funded schools, including primary, secondary and special needs. It does not include pre-school teachers. Data on teachers in independent schools in Scotland are collected separately by the Scottish Government using their annual Independent Schools Census. Foreign teachers on exchange in Scottish Schools are not included but details of teachers abroad on foreign exchange may be included in the Census. Data from the Teachers in Scotland Census are pulled directly from individual school information management systems. The information on these systems has originally been collected from the teachers and so is of a high standard. Data from the 2003 Census may not be of as high standard as subsequent years as this was the first year of the Census and there was a change in data collection method. The Scottish Government collects a wide variety of educational data covering pupils, preschool children, teachers, schools, and free school meal eligibility. Further information is available on the Scottish Government Education website. Research Usage and Linkage Whilst there have been some independent surveys and studies of teachers in Scotland there would appear to be little academic research using the Teachers in Scotland Census. Therefore the data could potentially be used to research a wide variety of topics covering subjects, classroom time (now only collected for promoted posts), or used to build more generic profiles of Teachers in Scotland over time. As the General Teaching Council (GTC) number is recorded in the Census, in theory it can also be linked to the datasets collected by the General Teaching Council. It cannot be linked to the Higher Education Statistics Agency Staff datasets. A separate and unique identifier is used for these purposes. </div...|$|E
