50|$|A <b>protective</b> <b>tunnel</b> {{formed with}} row cover is {{sometimes}} called a cloche, although a cloche, or bell jar, commonly refers to a distinct type of protective covering, made of glass or plastic, usually placed over individual plants. No longer in general use, a type of cloche employed in Europe involved panes of glass attached with wire to form continuous tunnels to protect rows of crops.|$|E
50|$|All {{through the}} night, the young {{soldiers}} {{searched for the}} <b>protective</b> <b>tunnels</b> dug by the Turks, but to no avail. They tried digging trenches in the rocky ground, but were unsuccessful, and so, they started heaping up stones {{in order to make}} protective mounds in advance of the immanent counter-attack. Furthermore, they faced superior Arab fire supporting the enemy from the hill across the valley, at a distance of only several hundred meters.|$|R
5000|$|The Liverool {{class was}} based on the 35 ft Self-righting motor {{introduced}} in 1929, but had greater beam (10 ft rather than 8 ft) and much shallower endboxes. The shelter was extended forward to cover the engine compartment, which was watertight and allowed the engine to continue to operate as long as the air intake was not submerged. The single propeller was protected by the keel. The twin-engined variant was visually very similar but had 8 in more beam and the twin propellers were in <b>protective</b> <b>tunnels.</b> In the mid 1960s the petrol engines in the first ten boats were replaced by [...] Parsons Penguin diesels (as were a couple of the Ferry engined boats). Only one single-engined boat, ON 832, was re-engined with a diesel engine, a Parsons Porbeagle of 47 hp.|$|R
40|$|Silk {{production}} has independently evolved in numerous arthropod lineages, such as Lepidoptera, the moths and butterflies. Lepidopteran larvae (caterpillars) synthesize silk proteins in modified salivary glands and spin silk fibers into <b>protective</b> <b>tunnels,</b> escape lines, and pupation cocoons. Molecular sequence data for these proteins {{are necessary to}} determine critical features of their function and evolution. To this end, we constructed an expression library from the silk glands of the ghost moth, Hepialus californicus, and characterized light chain fibroin and heavy chain fibroin gene transcripts. The predicted H. californicus silk fibroins share many elements with other lepidopteran and trichopteran fibroins, such as conserved placements of cysteine, aromatic, and polar amino acid residues. Further comparative analyses were performed to determine site-specific signatures of selection and to assess whether fibroin genes are informative as phylogenetic markers. We found that purifying selection has constrained mutation within the fibroins and that light chain fibroin is a promising molecular marker. Thus, by characterizing the H. californicus fibroins, we identified key functional amino acids and gained insight into the evolutionary processes that have shaped these adaptive molecules...|$|R
