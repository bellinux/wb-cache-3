5|$|In {{terms of}} public policy she favoured pragmatism in dealing with {{religious}} matters. The question of her legitimacy was a key concern: although she was technically illegitimate under both <b>Protestant</b> <b>and</b> <b>Catholic</b> law, her retroactively declared illegitimacy under the English church was not a serious bar compared to having never been legitimate as the Catholics claimed she was. For this reason alone, it was never in serious doubt that Elizabeth would embrace Protestantism.|$|E
5|$|One form of art {{particularly}} apt for Baroque purposes was the theater. Various theatrical {{shows were}} most often staged {{in conjunction with}} religious occasions and moralizing, and commonly utilized folk stylization. School theaters had become common among both the <b>Protestant</b> <b>and</b> <b>Catholic</b> secondary schools. A permanent court theater with an orchestra was established by Władysław IV at the Royal Castle in Warsaw in 1637; the actor troupe, dominated by Italians, performed primarily Italian opera and ballet repertoire.|$|E
5|$|Education was {{overwhelmingly}} {{controlled by}} <b>Protestant</b> <b>and</b> <b>Catholic</b> missions, which were {{also responsible for}} providing limited medical and welfare support to the rural Congolese. Food remained unrationed during the war, with only the sales of tires and automobiles restricted by the government. One {{of the consequences of}} the Congo's economic mobilisation during the war, particularly for the black population, was significant urbanisation. Just 9% of the indigenous population lived in cities in 1938; by 1950, the figure stood at close to 20%. The colonial authorities arrested enemy aliens in the Congo and confiscated their property in 1940.|$|E

5|$|In 1548 Charles {{declared}} an interreligio imperialis (also {{known as the}} Augsburg Interim) through which he sought to find some common ground for religious peace. This effort alienated both <b>Protestant</b> <b>and</b> <b>Catholic</b> princes and the papacy; even Charles, whose decree it was, was unhappy with the political and diplomatic dimensions of what amounted to half of a religious settlement. The 1551–52 sessions convened by Pope Julius III at the supposedly ecumenical Council of Trent solved none of the larger religious issues but simply restated Catholic teaching and condemned Protestant teaching as heresies.|$|E
5|$|Under James the Plantation of Ulster by English and Scots Protestants began, and the English {{colonisation}} of North America {{started its}} {{course with the}} foundation of Jamestown, Virginia, in 1607, and Cuper's Cove, Newfoundland, in 1610. During the next 150 years, England would fight with Spain, the Netherlands, and France {{for control of the}} continent, while religious division in Ireland between <b>Protestant</b> <b>and</b> <b>Catholic</b> has lasted for 400 years. By actively pursuing more than just a personal union of his realms, he helped lay the foundations for a unitary British state.|$|E
5|$|Aston's {{return to}} England in late 1626, {{along with all}} the Catholic settlers, failed to deter Baltimore, who finally sailed for Newfoundland in 1627, {{arriving}} on 23 July and staying only two months before returning to England. He had taken both <b>Protestant</b> <b>and</b> <b>Catholic</b> settlers with him, as well as two secular priests, Thomas Longville and Anthony Pole (also known as Smith), the latter remaining behind in the colony when Baltimore departed for England. The land Baltimore had seen was by no means the paradise described by some early settlers, being only marginally productive; as the summer climate was deceptively mild, his brief visit gave Baltimore no reason to alter his plans for the colony.|$|E

5|$|The Historia Ecclesiastica {{has given}} Bede a high reputation, but his {{concerns}} {{were different from}} those of a modern writer of history. His focus {{on the history of the}} organisation of the English church, and on heresies and the efforts made to root them out, led him to exclude the secular history of kings and kingdoms except where a moral lesson could be drawn or where they illuminated events in the church. Besides the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle, the medieval writers William of Malmesbury, Henry of Huntingdon, and Geoffrey of Monmouth used his works as sources and inspirations. Early modern writers, such as Polydore Vergil and Matthew Parker, the Elizabethan Archbishop of Canterbury, also utilised the Historia, and his works were used by both <b>Protestant</b> <b>and</b> <b>Catholic</b> sides in the Wars of Religion.|$|E
5|$|The ideological {{war between}} the <b>Protestant</b> <b>and</b> <b>Catholic</b> camps at first enriched the {{intellectual}} life of the Commonwealth. The Catholic Church responded to the challenges with internal reform, following the directions of the Council of Trent, officially accepted by the Polish Church in 1577, but implemented not until after 1589 and throughout the 17th century. There were earlier efforts of reform, originating from the lower clergy, and from about 1551 by Bishop Stanislaus Hosius (Stanisław Hozjusz) of Warmia, a lone at that time among the Church hierarchy, but ardent reformer. At {{the turn of the}} 17th century, a number of Rome educated bishops took over the Church administration at the diocese level, clergy discipline was implemented and rapid intensification of Counter-Reformation activities took place.|$|E
5|$|The Bastille was {{involved}} in the numerous wars of religion fought between <b>Protestant</b> <b>and</b> <b>Catholic</b> factions with support from foreign allies {{during the second half of}} the 16th century. Religious and political tensions in Paris initially exploded in the Day of the Barricades on 12 May 1588, when hard-line Catholics rose up in revolt against the relatively moderate Henry III. After a day's fighting had occurred across the capital, Henry III fled and the Bastille surrendered to Henry, the Duke of Guise and leader of the Catholic League, who appointed Bussy-Leclerc as his new captain. Henry III responded by having the Duke and his brother murdered later that year, whereupon Bussy-Leclerc used the Bastille as a base to mount a raid on the Parlement de Paris, arresting the president and other magistrates, whom he suspected of having royalist sympathies, and detaining them in the Bastille. They were not released until the intervention of Charles, the Duke of Mayenne, and the payment of substantial ransoms. Bussy-Leclerc remained in control of the Bastille until December 1592, when, following further political instability, he was forced to surrender the castle to Charles and flee the city.|$|E

25|$|The 16th century {{also saw}} the height of witch-hunts in Europe, and Switzerland was no exception.
