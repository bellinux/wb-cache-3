2500|$|In 1999 the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency began {{investigating}} perfluorinated chemicals {{after receiving}} {{data on the}} global distribution and toxicity of perfluorooctanesulfonic acid (PFOS). 3M, the former primary producer of PFOS from the U.S., announced the phase-out of PFOS, perfluorooctanoic acid, and PFOS-related product production in May 2000. Perfluorinated compounds produced by 3M were used in non-stick cookware and stain-resistant fabrics. The Cottage Grove facility manufactured PFCs from the 1940s to 2002. In response to PFC contamination of the Mississippi River and surrounding area, 3M stated the area will be [...] "cleaned {{through a combination of}} groundwater <b>pump-out</b> wells and soil sediment excavation". The restoration plan was based on an analysis of the company property and surrounding lands. The on-site water treatment facility that handled the plant's post-production water was not capable of removing the PFCs, which were released into the nearby Mississippi River. The clean-up cost estimate was $50 to $56 million, funded from a $147 million environmental reserve set aside in 2006.|$|E

40|$|South East Water Limited is a {{state-owned}} company providing {{water and sewerage services}} to 1. 3 million {{customers in the}} south east region of Melbourne. One of the key management issues for South East Water was the control of blockages and spills due to build-up of fats and grease in the sewer system. In 1995 it was estimated that approximately 30 % of sewer blockages were caused by fats and grease, and that 80 % of these fats came from commercial businesses (that is, restaurants, fast food outlets, etc.). In order to reduce sewer blockages, South East Water implemented a three phase Greasy Waste Program in late 1995. The first phase involved putting all commercial premises on Trade Waste Consents. Over 4, 100 such consents were issued. The second phase was to ensure all commercial customers had an appropriately sized grease interceptor. Over 1, 650 new grease interceptors were installed. The third and final phase was to ensure that all grease interceptors were pumped out regularly. South East Water developed and implemented its Wastelog system in consultation with the Victorian Waste Management Association to monitor and enforce <b>pump-outs.</b> By 2001, the Greasy Waste Program had contributed to a 50 % reduction in sewer blockages caused by fats...|$|R

50|$|Flow {{through the}} main is by gravity under the driving head of the service {{reservoirs}} at the source WTWs. By virtue of its depth, the pipeline is under some pressure; however, the hydraulic grade line rarely exceeds ground level, and, to enter, supply water must be pumped up into the distribution zones at the <b>pump-out</b> shafts. In some respects, therefore, the main {{can be considered as}} a minor reservoir, from which supply is drawn as required. An indication of this dynamic variation in demand is that the minimum hydraulic level moves between the Battersea and Park Lane <b>pump-out</b> shafts. The loop is closed to provide the redundancy that allows any segment on the ring to be isolated and drained for maintenance without interrupting the supply to any shaft, not for hydraulic reasons.|$|E
50|$|Bayview {{occupies}} about 575 ft {{along the}} Detroit River. Its facilities include two harbors with over 100 wells for vessels of varying length and beam.

5000|$|Burlington Northern {{signed an}} {{administrative}} order on consent with the U.S. EPA and the Minnesota Pollution Control Agency (MPCA) in 1985. Prior to that time, wastewater and liquid creosote {{had been removed}} from a lagoon and transported to a wastewater treatment plant and additional creosote was reused by an on-site plant. The remedy selected by EPA included on-site treatment and capping of remaining contaminated soils and sludges, and a groundwater gradient control system to address contaminated groundwater by using groundwater <b>pump-out</b> wells.|$|E
50|$|In late 2007 {{a scheme}} to develop the {{existing}} marina {{was presented to the}} community by the Marina's CEO, Michael Sparks.

Additionally, any applications for new or upgraded marinas must include the provision of a 24-hour sewerage <b>pump-out</b> facility.|$|E
50|$|The first purely {{experimental}} Model A started {{operation in}} 1953 and proved the basic layout. Larger models followed, but these demonstrated poor performance, {{suffering from a}} problem known as <b>pump-out</b> that caused them to lose plasma at rates far worse than theoretical predictions. By the early 1960s, any hope of quickly producing a commercial machine faded, and attention turned to studying the fundamental theory of high-energy plasmas. The release {{of information on the}} USSR's tokamak design in 1969 led to the Model C stellarator being converted to the Symmetrical Tokamak, as a much higher-performance concept. Large-scale work on the stellarator concept ended.|$|E

50|$|The Municipal Harbor was formalized in 1956 {{with the}} {{creation}} of a Harbor Commission. In 1958, an 11-foot high, 350-foot long, concrete, breakwater wall was constructed in the sound by the T.L. James Company. There are only two such concrete harbor walls in the world, with the other in Japan. Almost 1000 linear feet of public fishing is permitted on the two breakwalls. The harbor consists of seven piers, four assigned for pleasure craft and three for commercial vessels. Before it was destroyed by waves from Hurricane Katrina there were 346 slips ranging in berth sizes from 31-feet to 84-feet, in addition to a skiff-pier providing 20 tie-ups. Water, electricity, showers, restrooms, and a bait and fuel station and a vessel <b>pump-out</b> station were available, all overseen from the two-story Harbor Master office.|$|E

5000|$|The main lies mostly within London Clay with {{sections}} {{within the}} overlying alluvium and underlying Lambeth Group and Thanet Sand. The predominance of the London Clay lengths is by design, as being easily excavated, largely impermeable and somewhat self-supporting {{for short periods}} it is a near-ideal tunnelling material. Where the hydraulics have required entry into the Lambeth Group and Thanet Sand, tunnelling was considerably more difficult. In particular, the Thanet Sand requires a high boring torque, is highly abrasive and, most challengingly, sufficiently permeable to contain a water table continuous with the underlying Chalk and measured at pressures up to [...] An unexpected entry into the Thanet Sand while excavating near Tooting Bec Common led to the flooding of the tunnel and the temporary abandonment of a Tunnel Boring Machine (TBM). A further consideration of Thanet Sand {{is the presence of}} glauconite, which oxidises on contact with air. The resulting de-oxygenated air resulted in two fatalities during the excavation of a <b>pump-out</b> shaft.|$|E

40|$|A {{modified}} <b>pump-out</b> technique, {{incorporating a}} novel <b>pump-out</b> hole sealing process, {{has been developed}} that enables {{a high level of}} vacuum to be achieved between the panes of a vacuum glazing. The modified <b>pump-out</b> method provides several potential opportunities for the fabrication of a vacuum glazing with improved thermal performance. In particular, improved flexibility for production {{of a wide range of}} glazing sizes may allow a lower cost of manufacture to be achieved by avoiding the expense of a high vacuum oven which would otherwise be required for commercial production of high performance, large-scale vacuum glazings. The thermal performance of the vacuum glazing fabricated using the <b>pump-out</b> technique was characterized using a guarded hotbox calorimeter and theoretically analyzed using a finite volume model. The excellent experimentally determined thermal performance of the fabricated vacuum glazing was in good agreement with that predicted theoretically. (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|At {{the request}} of the Congressional Task Force on the Salton Sea and the Salton Sea Authority, the authors {{examined}} various technologies that have been proposed to reduce the decline in the Salton Sea. The primary focus of the technologies was to reduce the salinity of the Salton Sea, with secondary objectives of maintaining the present shoreline and to have a minimum cost. The authors found that two technologies, <b>pump-out</b> and diking, could provide the required salinity reduction. The <b>pump-out</b> option would result in a smaller Sea while to diking option would create a high salinity impoundment area in the Sea. The costs for the two options were similar. Desalination and pump-in; <b>pump-out</b> options were rejected because of high costs and because they did not provide a sufficient reduction in the salinity of the Salton Sea.

40|$|Type-I ELMy H-mode {{is planned}} to be the {{reference}} inductive operational scenario for ITER. However, unmitigated type-I ELMs would cause unacceptable damage to ITER’s divertor, so a way of mitigating their effect must be found. This thesis focuses on the ergodization of the plasma edge using RMPs {{as a means of}} ELM control, and on related topics relevant to ergodic magnetic fields in MAST. Chapter 1 provides an introduction to nuclear fusion and chapter 2 provides an overview of ELMs. In chapter 3, the effect of ergodic fields on L-mode temperature profiles is calculated. It is found that no flattening of the temperature profile should be expected in MAST plasmas, which is in agreement with experimental results. In chapter 4, various metrics characterizing the degree of ergodicity in both L- and H-mode plasmas are calculated using vacuum modelling and compared with the amount of density <b>pump-out</b> observed experimentally in the those plasmas during the application of RMPs. The only parameter to show a correlation with the amount of density <b>pump-out</b> is the width of the laminar region. However, plasma response modelling provides a robust criterion for the occurrence of density <b>pump-out</b> that applies both to L- and H-mode plasmas. In chapter 5, the results of lower single-null H-mode ELM mitigation experiments using n= 4 and n= 6 RMPs are presented. ELM mitigation is achieved and refuelling of plasmas that had begun to undergo <b>pump-out</b> is successfully demonstrated. Both ELM frequency and density <b>pump-out</b> are found to increase with ELM coil current above a certain threshold. An analysis of an ergodic magnetic field formed by a current sheet on a rational surface is presented in chapter 6. Various properties of this ergodic field are calculated and compared with experimental effects observed in the plasma. Some agreement is found between the experimental data and the modelling.

40|$|The {{resonant}} magnetic perturbation (RMP) fields, {{including the}} plasma response, are computed within a linear, full toroidal, single-fluid resistive magnetohydrodynamic (MHD) model, and under realistic plasma conditions for MAST and ITER. The response field {{is found to}} be considerably reduced, compared with the vacuum field produced by the magnetic perturbation coils. This field reduction relies strongly on the screening effect from the toroidal plasma rotation. Computations also quantify three-dimensional (3 D) distortions of the plasma surface, caused by RMP fields. A correlation is found between the computed mode structures, the plasma surface displacement and the observed density <b>pump-out</b> effect in MAST experiments. Generally, the density <b>pump-out</b> tends to occur when the surface displacement peaks near the X-points...|$|E
40|$|Condensed/adsorbed gases {{can enhance}} field {{emission}} in superconducting cavities and deteriorate the input coupler {{performance in a}} superconducting RF system.
