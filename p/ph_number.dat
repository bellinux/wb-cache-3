The MEPS variables, such as sample volume, <b>pH,</b> <b>number</b> of extraction cycles (draw-eject), and desorption conditions (solvent and solvent volume of elution) influenced the MEPS/LC efficiency significantly. Important factors in the optimization of MEPS efficiency, as well as washing steps and carryover effect are discussed. The analyses were carried out using small sample volumes (400 mu L.), and {{in a short time}} period (3 min for the entire sample preparation step). The MEPS/LC-UV method was shown to be linear at concentrations ranging from the limit of quantification (LOQ) to 1000 ng mL(- 1). The LOQ values ranged from 10 to 25 ng mL(- 1). The inter-day precision of the method presented coefficient of the variation ranging from 1. 3 % to 8. 7 %.

25|$|The pH {{level of}} a wine is the {{measurement}} {{of the amount of}} free (H+) hydrogen ions. It is related to the titratable acidity {{level of a}} wine but differs in significant ways. Low <b>pH</b> <b>numbers</b> indicate a high concentration of acids in a solution. While pure water is neutral with a pH of 7, wine tends to be more acidic with a pH between 3 and 4. As the acid levels in ripening grapes fall, the concentration of acids are lessening which means the pH level is rising. Yeasts, bacteria, phenolic compounds such as anthocyanins which influence color all have varying tolerance to wines with high pH levels. In general, wines with high pH value tend to have duller colors and less developed flavors and be more prone to wine faults caused by spoilage organisms which makes monitoring the pH levels of grapes during ripening a priority for viticulturists and winemakers.|$|R

40|$|A {{simple and}} {{accurate}} low-blank method {{has been developed}} {{for the analysis of}} total dissolved copper, cadmium, lead, and iron in a small volume (1. 3 – 1. 5 mL per element) of seawater. Pre-concentration and salt-separation of a stable isotope spiked sample are achieved by single batch extraction onto nitrilotriacetate (NTA) -type Superflow® chelating resin beads (100 – 2400 beads depending on the element). Metals are released into 0. 1 – 0. 5 M HNO[subscript 3], and trace metal isotope ratios are determined by ICPMS. The benefit of this method compared to our previous Mg(OH) 2 coprecipitation method is that the final matrix is very dilute so cone-clogging and matrix sensitivity suppression are minimal, while still retaining the high accuracy of the isotope dilution technique. Recovery efficiencies are sensitive to sample <b>pH,</b> <b>number</b> of resin beads added, and the length of time allowed for sample–resin binding and elution; these factors are optimized for each element to yield the highest recovery. The method has a low procedural blank and high sensitivity sufficient for the analysis of pM–nM open-ocean trace metal concentrations. Application of this method to samples from the Bermuda Atlantic Time-Series Study station provides oceanographically consistent Cu, Cd, Pb, and Fe profiles that are in good agreement with other reliable data for this site. In addition, the method can potentially be modified for the simultaneous analysis of multiple elements, which will be beneficial for the analysis of large number of samples.

The chromatographic resolution of LTG and chloramphenicol, used as internal standard (IS), was accomplished in less than 5 min on a C 18 column, at 35 °C, using an isocratic elution with acetonitrile (13 %), methanol (13 %) and water-triethylamine (99. 7 : 0. 3, v/v; pH 6. 0) pumped at a flow rate of 1 mL/min. Detection was performed at 215 nm. Calibration curves were linear over the range of 0. 1 - 20 μg/mL (r 2 ≥ 0. 9947) for LTG in both rat plasma and brain homogenate samples. The intra and interday imprecision did not exceed 8. 6 % and the intra and interday inaccuracy ranged from - 8. 1 to 13. 5 %.

The inflection points of the Gompertz and Logistic models were calculated and the goodness of fit was quantified using the adjusted coefficient of determination, Akaike information criterion, standard deviation of residuals, mean absolute deviation, mean absolute percentage error, and mean prediction error. Differences were observed between the Gompertz and Logistic models and between the experimental periods in the parameter estimate for all morphological traits measured. Satisfactory growth curve fittings were achieved for plant height, number of leaves, and stem diameter in both models using the evaluation criteria: coefficient of determination (R²), Akaike information criterion (AIC), standard deviation of residuals (SDR), mean absolute deviation (MAD), mean absolute percentage error (MAPE), and mean prediction error (MPE) ...|$|E
30|$|In addition, {{stainless}} steel {{was found to}} induce specific changes in the oral environment such as decreased pH, increased plaque accumulation [1, 5, 6], and elevated Streptococcus mutans and Lactobacillus acidophilus colonization [7 – 10]. Among several pathogenic organisms that accumulate and colonize {{in the form of}} plaque, lactobacilli do not play a major part in initiation but are important in progression of the lesion. With established low <b>pH,</b> the <b>number</b> of lactobacilli increases and the number of S. mutans decreases; this contributes to demineralization of the teeth once lesions are established. Preventing these lesions is an important concern for the orthodontist, because the lesions are unaesthetic, unhealthy, and potentially irreversible.|$|R
40|$|How ocean {{acidification}} affects marine {{life is a}} major concern for science and society. However, its impacts on encrusting biofouling communities, that are both the initial colonizers of hard substrata and of great economic importance, are almost unknown. We showed that community composition changed significantly, from 92 % spirorbids, 3 % ascidians and 4 % sponges initially to 47 % spirorbids, 23 % ascidians and 29 % sponges after 100 days in acidified conditions (pH 7. 7). In low <b>pH,</b> <b>numbers</b> of the spirorbid Neodexiospira pseudocorrugata were reduced × 5 compared to controls. The two ascidians present behaved differently with Aplidium sp. decreasing × 10 in pH 7. 7, whereas Molgula sp. numbers were × 4 higher in low pH than controls. Calcareous sponge (Leucosolenia sp.) numbers increased × 2. 5 in pH 7. 7 over controls. The diatom and filamentous algal community was also more poorly developed in the low pH treatments compared to controls. Colonization of new surfaces likewise showed large decreases in spirorbid numbers, but numbers of sponges and Molgula sp. increased. Spirorbid losses appeared due to both recruitment failure and loss of existing tubes. Spirorbid tubes are comprised of a loose prismatic fabric of calcite crystals. Loss of tube materials appeared due to changes in the binding matrix and not crystal dissolution, as SEM analyses showed crystal surfaces were not pitted or dissolved in low pH conditions. Biofouling communities face dramatic future changes with reductions in groups with hard exposed exoskeletons and domination by soft-bodied ascidians and sponges...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} {{to determine the effects of}} dietary cation-anion difference (DCAD) on acidity of ration, blood, vaginal mucous, and urine, number of fetus, number of offspring, and offspring sex ratio. The treatments were rations with DCAD - 28, - 18, 0, + 14, and + 32 meq which were offered to 15 ewes. This research used randomized complete block design. There were three groups, (I) ewes previously had twin female offsprings; (II) ewes previously had twin male offsprings; and (III) ewes previously had twin male and female offsprings. Results of this study showed that there were no differences observed for blood 2 ̆ 7 s pH, vaginal liquid 2 ̆ 7 s <b>pH,</b> offspring <b>number,</b> and offspring sex ratio. Increasing DCAD affected ration 2 ̆ 7 s pH, urine 2 ̆ 7 s <b>pH,</b> and <b>number</b> of fetus for each ewe. Blood 2 ̆ 7 s acidity was not affected by DCAD, but DCAD - 28 meq reduced acid of blood, metabolic acidosis, and urine; the number of fetus and offspring. DCAD - 28 meq might be anions excessive in the ration. DCAD 0 meq was relatively the best of ration because gave the normality of blood, metabolic, and urine, also relatively the highest of fetus and offspring. The offspring sex ratio related to vaginal mucose pH when artificial insemination was applied (r= 0. 75) and ration 2 ̆ 7 s pH (r= 0. 47). Ewes previously had twin female lambs gave the number of fetus and offspring sex ratio were 2. 00 + 0. 71 and 0...|$|R
