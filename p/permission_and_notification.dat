One or two of these were modern and no vessel was allowed to leave port at night without official <b>permission</b> <b>and</b> a <b>notification</b> to the commandant. If the steamer were seen, refusal to stop would be followed by the roar of a gun. But Grahame did not mean to stop so long as she was not struck.|$|R
