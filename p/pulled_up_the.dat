5|$|The next day, McNish, McCarthy and Vincent {{were picked}} up. They {{were unable to}} {{recognise}} Worsley, freshly shaven, when he stepped ashore. The James Caird, which had been <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> beach and turned over {{to serve as a}} shelter, was also retrieved.|$|E
5|$|American {{football}} {{in the early}} 1900s had become increasingly violent; with no forward pass, the ball carrier would be typically pushed and <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> field by his own players in massive formations that often resulted in serious injuries. In 1905, 18 deaths, three at the college level, were attributed to football; 159 serious injuries were also reported, 88 at the college level.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the episode}} itself was penned by Jeremy Carver, the writing staff contributed their {{ideas to the}} storyline. Within five minutes of brainstorming, they envisioned three scenes they had to do: the teaser, where a {{grandfather}} pretending to be Santa is <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> chimney and slaughtered; a boy witnessing the Santa-dressed villain brutally killing his father and then eating one of the cookies for Santa; and the Winchesters killing someone with a Christmas tree.|$|E

50|$|The {{original}} GravityLight used a strap for <b>pulling</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> weight. The improved GL02 used a plastic-bead chain on {{a pulley}} system. The pulley system requires less strength to <b>pull</b> <b>up.</b>|$|R

5|$|Roope, who drowned when {{he could}} no longer hang on to a rope whilst being <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> side of the cruiser, was posthumously awarded the Victoria Cross, thus {{becoming}} the first VC recipient of the Second World War. The award was justified, in part, by the recommendation of Heye, who wrote to the British authorities via the Red Cross, giving a statement of the valiant courage Roope had shown when engaging a much superior ship in close battle. Ramsay was also awarded the DSO. Both awards were made {{after the end of the}} war.|$|E
5|$|The {{hospital}} ship , {{which had been}} sent out to rescue survivors from the sunken boats, was seized by the British for violating the Hague Convention rules {{on the use of}} {{hospital ship}}s. The loss of a squadron of German torpedo boats led to a drastic change in tactics in the English Channel and along the coast of Flanders. There were fewer sorties into the Channel and the torpedo boat force was relegated to coastal patrol and rescuing aircrew. The British received a bonus on 30 November, when a trawler <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> sealed chest thrown off S119 by Captain Thiele. The chest contained a German codebook used by the German light forces stationed on the coast, allowing the British to read German wireless communication for long afterwards.|$|E
5|$|For the Ladder match, the Intercontinental belts {{belonging}} to Razor Ramon and Shawn Michaels were both hanging above the ring, {{and the first}} wrestler to use the ladder to reach both belts would be declared the winner. Ramon began the match by chokeslamming Michaels. Michaels recovered, however, and performed a neckbreaker on Ramon. Michaels then threw Ramon out to the ringside, where Michaels' bodyguard Diesel clotheslined Ramon. Referee Earl Hebner responded by ordering Diesel {{to return to the}} dressing rooms. Ramon <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> padding from the concrete floor, but he was later thrown onto it after Michaels reversed Ramon's attempt to perform the Razor's Edge. While Ramon was lying on the floor, Michaels brought the ladder to the ring and used it to hit Ramon in the stomach, chest and back. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts, but Ramon stopped him from climbing the ladder. Michaels then set the ladder up {{in the corner of the}} ring and performed a splash onto Ramon. Ramon recovered and Irish whipped Michaels into the ladder. He then hit Michaels with the ladder several times before both men tried to climb up to get the belts. Ramon suplexed Michaels off the ladder and tried to reach the belts. Michaels dropkicked the ladder, which caused Ramon to fall off. Michaels performed a superkick and a piledriver on Ramon and then propped the ladder up in the corner of the ring. Michaels climbed the turnbuckles, jumped onto the ladder, and used his weight to push it down across Ramon's chest. Michaels tried to retrieve the belts again, but Ramon pushed him off. Michaels fell into the ropes and got tangled up, allowing Ramon to get the belts and win the undisputed Intercontinental championship.|$|E

25|$|Older {{children}} were given more manual jobs. Tubs were pulled up slopes {{above and below}} ground by balance weights, a balancer was usually a boy who operated the balance system.

These were dangerous jobs and many {{children were}} seriously injured or lost limbs.|$|E
25|$|Israeli {{soldiers}} on the ground, alerted {{by the sound of}} the approaching Spitfires and fearing another Egyptian air attack, opened fire with machine guns. One Spitfire was shot down by a tank-mounted machine gun, while the other was lightly damaged and rapidly <b>pulled</b> <b>up.</b> <b>The</b> remaining three Spitfires were then attacked by patrolling IAF Spitfires flown by Slick Goodlin and John McElroy, volunteers from the United States and Canada respectively. All three Spitfires were shot down, and one pilot was killed.|$|E
25|$|As the Australians {{began their}} innings, {{it was clear}} that not enough time {{remained}} for them to make up the 341 runs by which they trailed. Almost immediately they were offered the light; and having accepted it, both teams had to return to the dressing rooms to wait for a formal finish. The situation became somewhat farcical. With the match effectively over, the crowd were eager for the Ashes to be presented to England, and the celebrations to begin. After a period of some uncertainty and confusion, at 18:17 BST umpires Koertzen and Bowden removed the bails and <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> stumps to signal the end of the match. With no result in this fifth and final Test, England took the series 2–1, regaining the Ashes {{for the first time since}} 1987.|$|E

25|$|Lieutenant Greble {{refused to}} pull back until the last, {{continuing}} to work his remaining gun, for {{he did not have}} enough able men left to man them both. This effort cost him his life as the Confederate artillery concentrated on his position and he was struck {{in the back of the}} head by a cannonball while finally winding up his work. When they received word of Greble's death, Lieutenant Colonel Warren, Captain Wilson and five of their men rushed back to recover Greble's body before they left the field. Greble was the first graduate of West Point and first U.S. Regular Army officer killed in the war. After littering the road back to Fort Monroe with coats and equipment on a very hot afternoon, the Union troops arrived back at Fort Monroe about 5:00p.m. that afternoon. About 100 Confederate cavalry pursued the Union force but could not mount an attack and pulled back as they approached Hampton because the Union force had <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> New Market Bridge over the southern branch of the Back River to thwart the Confederate pursuit.|$|E
500|$|General Gates, {{who oversaw}} the {{northern}} defenses, was aware that Mount Defiance threatened the fort. [...] John Trumbull had pointed this out as early as 1776, when a shot fired from the fort was able to reach Defiance's summit, and several officers inspecting the hill noted that there were approaches to its summit where gun carriages could be <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> sides. [...] As the garrison {{was too small to}} properly defend all the existing works in area, Mount Defiance was left undefended. [...] Anthony Wayne left Ticonderoga in April 1777 to join Washington's army; he reported to Washington that [...] "all was well", and that the fort [...] "can never be carried, without much loss of blood".|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} haul portaledges and other gear such as ropes, food, and water up a rock face, the gear {{is put in}} a bag ("haul bag" [...] or [...] "pig") and <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> to <b>the</b> next belay station. There are many {{different}} mechanically advantageous systems, such as counterweighting, that are utilized to make <b>pulling</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> [...] "haul bag" [...] easier than simply dragging it <b>up</b> <b>the</b> face.|$|R

500|$|In the end, the 1968 {{merger with}} the Chicago and North Western (C) sealed the Winston Tunnel's fate. The Great Western's main line through {{northern}} Illinois closely paralleled the North Western's own line, but through less densely populated and less commercially active areas. The steep grades {{of the line}} and the obvious financial burden of the Winston Tunnel also {{played a role in the}} decision to completely abandon the Great Western's trackage in the area. The C operated its last train through the tunnel in 1971. Scrappers <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> tracks the following year. Upon abandonment, the C placed chain-link fences over each bore of the tunnel to keep squatters and other trespassers out. [...] A 1973 attempt to turn the right-of-way through Jo Daviess County, including the Winston Tunnel, into a rail trail, failed when ownership of the land reverted to nearby property owners.|$|E
500|$|Three more routes {{started from}} Edmonton, Alberta; {{these were not}} much better – barely trails at all – despite being advertised as [...] "the inside track" [...] and the [...] "back door to the Klondike". One, the [...] "overland route", headed north-west from Edmonton, {{ultimately}} meeting the Peace River and then continuing on overland to the Klondike, crossing the Liard River en route. To encourage travel via Edmonton, the government hired T.W. Chalmers to build a trail, which {{became known as the}} Klondike Trail or Chalmers Trail. The other two trails, known as the [...] "water routes", involved more river travel. One went by boat along rivers and overland to the Yukon River system at Pelly River and from there to Dawson. Another went north of Dawson by the Mackenzie River to Fort McPherson, before entering Alaska and meeting the Yukon River at Fort Yukon, downstream to the Klondike. From here, the boat and equipment had to be <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> Yukon about [...] An estimated 1,660 travellers took these three routes, of whom only 685 arrived, some taking up to 18 months to make the journey.|$|E
500|$|As {{the episode}} opens, a man visits his {{grandson}} for Christmas in Seattle, Washington.

The discovery of a bloody tooth in the fireplace leads Sam to suspect that an evil version of Santamany world lores tell of those who punish the wicked during Christmasis at work. As the brothers search the town and debate about whether to celebrate Christmas that yearDean insists while Sam refusesanother man is taken by a Santa-dressed being. Upon investigation the following day, Sam notices that both families have the same wreath over their fireplaces. The wreath {{is found to be}} made of meadowsweet, an herb often used in pagan rituals to lure gods to a human sacrifice, which leads Sam to believe that they are dealing with Hold Nickar, the god of the winter solstice. Dean later admits that he wants to celebrate Christmas since it will be his last chance tohis demonic pact with a demon in [...] "All Hell Breaks Loose, Part Two" [...] only left him with one year to live. Sam responds that he cannot sit around celebrating and pretending that everything is okay while knowing that Dean will not be alive the next Christmas.|$|E

2500|$|The unusual {{feature of}} the canal was the six {{inclined}} planes. The tub boats had wheels, and on the inclined planes they were <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> slopes with the wheels running in channel rails (like a squat letter [...] "U" [...] in section). There were two sets of rails, one for each direction, {{but it does not}} appear that a counterbalancing system was used (in which a boat coming down would balance one being pulled up).|$|E
2500|$|The streetcars {{were used}} in {{conjunction}} with four of Cincinnati's inclined railways, the Mount Adams Incline, Mount Auburn Incline, Bellevue Incline, and Fairview Incline. [...] Except for the Fairview Incline, these originally conveyed horsecars, but were later equipped to carry electric streetcars. [...] The cars would be driven onto the incline platform, which was level and was equipped with rails and (in most cases) overhead trolley wires. The platform, riding on its own rails, would then be <b>pulled</b> <b>up</b> <b>the</b> hill by the cable, carrying the streetcar. Once reaching the top, the streetcar could simply be driven off of the platform, onto the fixed-in-place track along city streets. [...] The 1872-opened Mount Adams Incline began carrying horsecars in 1877, and it was later strengthened for use by electric streetcars, which were much heavier.|$|E
