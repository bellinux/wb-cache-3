5|$|Throughout the poem, Gawain {{encounters}} numerous trials testing {{his devotion}} {{and faith in}} Christianity. When Gawain sets out on his journey to find the Green Chapel, he finds himself lost, and only after <b>praying</b> <b>to</b> the Virgin Mary does he find his way. As he continues his journey, Gawain once again faces anguish regarding his inevitable encounter with the Green Knight. Instead of <b>praying</b> <b>to</b> Mary, as before, Gawain places his faith in the girdle {{given to him by}} Bertilak's wife. From the Christian perspective, this leads to disastrous and embarrassing consequences for Gawain as he is forced to reevaluate his faith when the Green Knight points out his betrayal. Another interpretation sees the work in terms of the perfection of virtue, with the pentangle representing the moral perfection of the connected virtues, the Green Knight as Christ exhibiting perfect fortitude, and Gawain as slightly imperfect in fortitude by virtue of flinching when under the threat of death.|$|E

Then he discussed whether we should <b>pray</b> <b>to</b> angels or not. Unlike Morgan - who thought we should <b>pray</b> <b>to</b> both God and angels - Chubb thought we probably should not <b>pray</b> <b>to</b> angels. He said even though they are “ministering spirits,” we cannot be sure they hear our prayers, and they might not be at liberty to help us without God’s direct guidance. He finally spent ten pages wondering whether we should <b>pray</b> <b>to</b> Jesus or just to God the Father. He concluded that we should <b>pray</b> <b>to</b> God the Father “in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ.” ...|$|R

Forty days after he ceased <b>praying</b> <b>to</b> God and washing his face, the man should go to some level ground, before he drew a circle on the ground and sat in its centre.

In the region of Semberija, northeast Bosnia, а zduhać could pass his supernatural power on to his son.|$|E

5|$|Redeemed Warrior - The Redeemed Warrior, also {{referred}} to as the champion, is the unnamed protagonist of the graphic novel Rise of the Warrior who becomes the player's multiplayer character in Ascension. In Rise of the Warrior, it is shown that he was a native of Kirra whose father was killed by a general. Before dying, the warrior swore to his father that he would bring no harm to his family. The warrior then gathered soldiers of the village and sought after the general, also recruiting the witch Circe. Finding the general, he discovered that the general was actually his uncle and Circe's lover. After negotiations, the warrior tricked his uncle into drinking poisonous Cerberus blood, killing his uncle. Circe was aghast and fled. Because he killed his uncle, it broke his oath to his father. The Giver appeared, revealing himself to be Orkos, and imprisoned the warrior in the Prison of the Damned. In Ascension during Kratos' pursuit of Megaera, Kratos encountered the warrior, who was rejoiced to see an opportunity for freedom from his prison. Before being attacked by an arm of the Hecatonchires, the warrior vanished in a beam of light upon <b>praying</b> <b>to</b> the gods. This transported him to the Rotunda of Olympus.
