5|$|Around 300men from Cheadle Hulme {{served in}} the First World War, and {{it was decided that}} those who died should be commemorated. Various ideas, {{including}} a library and clock tower, were suggested and in the end a cenotaph was built on the corner of Ravenoak Road and Manor Road in 1921. Additions for later wars have been made, and due to the busy traffic around that particular <b>place</b> <b>there</b> have been suggestions for moving it to a quieter area.|$|E
60|$|In some <b>places</b> <b>there</b> is a {{small scrap}} of pebbly beach {{at the base of}} those {{perpendicular}} cliffs; in most <b>places</b> <b>there</b> is none--the cliffs presenting to the sea almost a dead wall, where neither ship nor boat could find refuge from the storm.|$|R

5|$|Brown {{opened his}} {{campaign}} in Bowling Green on August 26. Because {{of his age}} and ill health, he made {{no more than one}} speech per week. Nevertheless, he toured the Commonwealth, questioning the sincerity of Goebel's Free Silver views. He continued to attack the Music Hall Convention, asking whether past great Democrats such as John C. Breckinridge and Lazarus W. Powell would have supported the events that took <b>place</b> <b>there.</b> He also derided the Goebel Election Law as creating an oligarchy. Brown's limited appearances were supplemented by speeches from his supporters.|$|E
5|$|Fearing similar {{damage to}} Aitutaki, a pre-emptive state of {{emergency}} was issued for Rarotonga. This was soon lifted as Pat ultimately spared Rarotonga and little damage took <b>place</b> <b>there.</b> Gale-force winds and heavy rains impacted Rarotonga and Palmerston islands. Large swells affected the uninhabited Penrhyn atoll, interfering with a study of marine turtles.|$|E
5|$|In 1982 Ruby Garrett, {{the last}} madam of the Dumas, {{was convicted of}} federal tax evasion and served six months in prison.

5|$|Jesus {{grew up in}} Galilee {{and much}} of his {{ministry}} took <b>place</b> <b>there.</b> The languages spoken in Galilee and Judea during the 1st century AD include Jewish Palestinian Aramaic, Hebrew, and Greek, with Aramaic being predominant. There is substantial consensus that Jesus gave most of his teachings in Aramaic.|$|E
5|$|The exact {{location}} of the Vijithapura fortress is uncertain. A village with the same name near the ancient Kalawewa reservoir {{may have been the}} place where the battle took <b>place.</b> <b>There</b> is an ancient temple here as well as a granite stone that locals believe to have been used by Dutthagamani's soldiers to sharpen their swords However, other historians and archaeologists believe that the location is close to Kaduruwela near Polonnaruwa, where the ruins of an ancient fortress have been found.|$|E
5|$|The {{scattered}} {{nature of}} the airborne landings caused some confusion among the German high command. At the LXII Corps headquarters, several reports of the landings exaggerated their strength, causing the Germans to believe they were faced with a far greater force. Also, 600 dummy paratroops that had landed {{to the north and}} west of Toulon, as part of the Allied deception plan, convinced the Germans another landing had taken <b>place</b> <b>there.</b>|$|E

5|$|In 2003 Trump {{tried to}} move the Sybase Classic, a LPGA tournament, from Wykagyl Country Club to Trump's club for 2007; the Wykagyl lease would run out in that year. Briarcliff Manor's mayor Peter Chatsky was opposed to the plan; Trump {{attempted}} to persuade the mayor {{to talk to his}} wife, Jean Chatzky, about the financial benefit of hosting the tournament, adding that village residents would be hired for the event. A Trump Organization vice president suggested donating some proceeds to the Briarcliff Manor Public Library's then-proposed expansion or toward improving a village baseball field. The club's special-use permit with the village restricted the course to 300 people and banned large-scale tournaments from taking <b>place</b> <b>there.</b> The discussion between the Trump Organization and village government stopped that year, however in 2004, Trump submitted a new request to bring a LPGA or PGA tournament to the club.|$|E
5|$|In 2009, {{a number}} of {{activities}} were proposed to commemorate the 250th anniversary of the Battle of the Plains of Abraham. A plan to hold a reenactment of the battle itself (as well as a reenactment of the subsequent French victory of 1760 at the Battle of Sainte-Foy) was cancelled due to threats of public disorder. Leaders of separatist parties described the event as {{a slap in the}} face for Quebecers of French ancestry and as an insult for the francophone majority. Some sovereigntist groups threatened or made indirect threats by stating that if the event took <b>place,</b> <b>there</b> could be violence. The movement against re-enactment and these threats of violence led the National Battlefields Commission to cancel the event.|$|E
5|$|It was objected yesterday, {{that there}} was no {{provision}} for a jury from the vicinage. If it could have been done with safety, {{it would not have been}} opposed. It might so happen that a trial would be impracticable in the county. Suppose a rebellion in a whole district, would it not be impossible to get a jury? The trial by jury is held as sacred in England as in America. There are deviations of it in England: yet greater deviations have happened here since we established our independence, than have taken <b>place</b> <b>there</b> for a long time, though it be left to the legislative discretion. It is a misfortune in any case that this trial should be departed from, yet in some cases it is necessary. It must be therefore left to the discretion of the legislature to modify it according to circumstances. This is a complete and satisfactory answer.|$|E

5|$|John Ebers, a bookseller, {{took over}} the {{management}} of the theatre in 1821, and seven more London premieres of Rossini operas (La gazza ladra, Il turco in Italia, Mosè in Egitto, Otello, La donna del lago, Matilde di Shabran and Ricciardo e Zoraide) took <b>place</b> <b>there</b> in the following three years. Ebers sublet the theatre to Giambattista Benelli in 1824, and Rossini was invited to conduct, remaining for a five-month season, with his wife Isabella Colbran performing. Two more of his operas, Zelmira and Semiramide, received their British premieres during the season, but the theatre sustained huge losses and Benelli absconded without paying either the composer or the artists. Ebers engaged Giuditta Pasta for the 1825 season, but he became involved in lawsuits which, combined with a large increase in the rent of the theatre, forced him into bankruptcy, after which he returned to his bookselling business.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the area}} is now Green Belt, placing {{restrictions}} on the kinds of developments that can take <b>place.</b> <b>There</b> are areas of commercial peat extraction, but Salford City Council is seeking to return at least some back to wet mossland. Planning permission for peat extraction expired {{at the end of}} 2010. At a meeting held on 30 June 2011 Salford Council decided not to renew the permission, and on 1 August obtained a court order prohibiting any further extraction pending an appeal by the companies involved. A public inquiry concluded in 2012 supported the council's decision, and commercial peat extraction on Chat Moss ceased.|$|E
5|$|Rudolf Vrba (11 September 1924– 27 March 2006) was a Slovak-Jewish {{biochemist}} who, as {{a teenager}} in 1942, was deported to the Auschwitz concentration camp in German-occupied Poland. He became known for having escaped from the camp in April 1944, {{at the height of the}} Holocaust, and for co-writing a detailed report about the mass murder that was taking <b>place</b> <b>there.</b> Distribution of the report is credited with having halted the mass deportation of Hungary's Jews to Auschwitz in July 1944, saving over 200,000 lives. After the war Vrba became a noted biochemist in England and Canada.|$|E

5|$|The Tunnel of Light is {{an artistic}} display {{of color and}} sound {{surrounding}} the escalator at the station. 1800 fluorescent lamps and 44 speakers are installed behind a layer of glass along the corridor, steadily changing color and mood. The theme is based on different experiences of travel in time and <b>place.</b> <b>There</b> are light and sound combinations for all seasons and all phases of life. The project was initiated by Kristin Jarmund. The light system was developed by Per Åge Lyså at Intravision System, and the software that mixes sound and color was developed by Yngve Sandboe. The music was composed by Bjarne Kvinnsland, mainly based on recorded samples. Among these are text written and performed by Beate Grimsrud.|$|E
5|$|The {{memorial}} {{was opened}} on November 30, 2001, 60 {{years after the}} start of the deportations. The event was opened by the former president of Latvia Vaira Vīķe-Freiberga who in her speech noted the importance of raising people's awareness about the events that took <b>place</b> <b>there.</b> The event was well attended, including former Latvian Prime Minister Andris Bērziņš, Latvian chief rabbi Natans Barkans, officials and ambassadors from various countries, former ghetto and concentration camp inmates, and relatives of the victims from Lithuania, Estonia, Germany, Israel, Austria, and Russia. Several research, education, and remembrance events were held after the opening ceremony. The opening and the following events received local and foreign media coverage. The opening ceremony ended with a Jewish prayer Kaddish by Riga Jewish community cantor Vlad Shulman.|$|E
5|$|Always in {{the thick}} of the action during this campaign, on 24 February, Nansouty was present near the city of Troyes. Negotiations for an {{armistice}} were ongoing in a village nearby and, despite formal orders to continue the fighting, the two armies had ceased the combat. Nansouty then took his men and attacked enemy troops, charging into the streets of the village where the negotiations were taking place. The French envoy to the armistice talks, Monsieur de Flahaut saw this development and found Nansouty, bitterly protesting against the latter's action. Nansouty responded that the Emperor was doubtlessly aware that negotiations were indeed taking <b>place</b> <b>there,</b> but that he had orders to capture the position without further delay. On 27 February, the Emperor again moved against Blücher's Prussians, leaving a part of his forces near Troyes to observe the movement of Prince of Schwarzenberg's Austrian army. Nansouty, with the Guard cavalry, accompanied the Emperor, ensuring his protection and clearing his way after a bloody cavalry skirmish at Château-Thierry on 3 March. Another cavalry skirmish occurred on 5 March, with Nansouty repulsing a numerous enemy cavalry, 3,000-4,000 troopers, and capturing the bridge of Berry-au-Bac, over the Aisne, despite the enemy cannonade. Once across the Aisne with a few Polish lancer platoons, Nansouty launched a heroic pursuit, capturing enemy cannons and munitions, and taking a significant number of prisoners, among whom was the teenage Russian Prince Gagarin.|$|E
