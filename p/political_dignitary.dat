50|$|Luis de Figueroa {{was born}} in Seville. He was ordained a priest in the Order of Saint Jerome where he served as the prior of the convent of Mejorada del Campo. In April 1516, he was elected as the {{commissioner}} of the Indies and tasked by Francisco Jiménez de Cisneros, regent of Spain, with stopping the abuses committed by the encomenderos as urgently documented by father Bartolomé de las Casas. On November 11, 2015, he left with two other Hieronimyte friars, Bernardino de Manzanedo (prior of the convent of Santa Marta) and Alonso de Santo Domingo (prior of the monastery of San Juan de Ortega) for the New World where they ruled for several years. They consolidated the Indian population into villages {{in order to better}} monitor their treatment as well as to facilitate evangelization; however, a smallpox epidemic devastated the population and efforts to prevent abuses by the encomenderos proved futile. The three Hieronimytes returned to Spain defeated. Adviser to the King and treasurer of Spain, Miguel de Pasamonte proposed Figueroa for bishop of the Diocese of Santo Domingo and President of Santo Domingo, which would have made him the highest religious and <b>political</b> <b>dignitary</b> in the Indies. The request was officially granted by Pope Clement VII in 1524 although Luis de Figueroa had already died on March 23, 1523 at the convent of Mejorada. Sebastián Ramírez de Fuenleal was appointed bishop of Santo Domingo in his place.|$|E

5000|$|Efforts to {{preserve}} the Cut-Off began almost immediately upon the route's closing. In November 1979, Amtrak operated an inspection train between Hoboken and Scranton to investigate intercity rail service between the two cities. Dubbed the [...] "Pocono Mountain Special", the train left Hoboken and ran west on the Morristown Line on November 13, 1979, reaching Port Morris shortly after 9 a.m. With the main line severed at Port Morris Junction, the special train detoured through Port Morris Yard, ran over Port Morris Wye, and then rolled onto the Cut-Off. The train ran to Scranton, where it was met {{by a group of}} <b>political</b> <b>dignitaries.</b> It was the last passenger train in the twentieth century — and the only Amtrak train — to operate over the entire route.

50|$|Following {{the death}} of the Kunkhyen Pema Karpo in 1592, two {{candidates}} were claimed as his reincarnation: Pagsam Wangpo (b. 1593), the natural son of the prince of Chongye, and Ngawang Namgyal (b.1594), the son of Mipham Chögyal, 17th prince-abbot of Ralung. The arbitrage between the parties of the two candidates was long and complex, involving most of the principal religious and <b>political</b> <b>dignitaries</b> of Tibet at that time. Lhatsewa Ngawang Zangpo (lha rtse ba ngag dbang bzang po, 1546-1615), an influential follower of Gyalwang Drukpa Padma Karpo, and most of the monks of Tashi Thongmon and Druk Sangag Chöling monasteries, favoured Lhatsewa's nephew, Pagsam Wangpo; while the Gya clan of Ralung Monastery, the traditional seat of the Drukpa school, and their supporters laid claim on behalf of Ngawang Namgyal. The long dispute ultimately led to a decision by the strongman of Tibet, Karma Phuntsok Namgyal, who chose the Chonggye candidate Pagsam Wangpo. This cemented the split of the central branch of the Drukpa school into Northern and Southern branches, and the flight of the opposing candidate to the south of the Himalayas where he established an independent Drukpa state now known as Bhutan.|$|R

Its internal sources report that the breakthrough came in 1997, when the group started offering free Kabbalah courses through the Internet and radio (television followed in 2007), and eventually moved its headquarters from Bnei Brak to Petah Tikva. Through the Internet, Bnei Baruch started gathering followers throughout the world. Today, it is present in 107 countries, with some 150,000 regular students, of whom 50,000 are in Israel: the number two million, mentioned by the movement itself, refers to those who access its web sites annually. Conferences are organized yearly in Tel Aviv with some 6,000 attendees, including local cultural and <b>political</b> <b>dignitaries.</b> For example, three cabinet members from the Likud party attended the 2016 conference. In 2011, at a time of internal turmoil in Israel parallel to the Arab Spring, Bnei Baruch established the Arvut ("Mutual Responsibility"), a non-political social movement. Students of Bnei Baruch also established a political party, Beyachad ("Together"), which participated in the 2013 municipal elections in Petah Tikva, where it emerged as the most voted party.|$|R
