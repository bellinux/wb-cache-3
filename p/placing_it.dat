5|$|In 1996, Kevin Thiele and Pauline Ladiges {{published}} a new arrangement for the genus, after cladistic analyses yielded a cladogram {{significantly different from}} George's arrangement. Thiele and Ladiges' arrangement retained B.spinulosa in series Spicigerae, <b>placing</b> <b>it</b> alone in B.subser. Spinulosae. This arrangement stood until 1999, when George effectively reverted to his 1981 arrangement in his monograph for the Flora of Australia series.|$|E
