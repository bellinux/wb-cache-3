40|$|The team {{behavior}} {{literature is}} ambiguous about {{the relations between}} members’ interpersonal processes—task debate and task conflict—and team performance. From a social influence perspective, we show why members’ interpersonal processes determine team performance over time in small groups. Together, over time, dissenting in-group minorities who share information (via debate) with majorities, who selectively engage with them to consider their alternative proposals (via conflict), can improve their team performance (via innovation). The context/comparison model of social influence and its leniency contract extension to the special case of in-group minorities suggest a pattern of members’ interpersonal <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> <b>unfolds</b> over time to reconcile factions with the same social identity who hold different approaches to shared projects. Conditional on typical levels of task debate, we predict that (a) in early episodes, task conflict increases the relation between task debate and team performance; (b) in middle episodes, task conflict decreases the relation; and (c) in late episodes, task conflict increases the relation again. We explore our thesis using a longitudinal design {{with a sample of}} 60 student teams (360 individuals) working together for course credit over 5 months (21 weeks) to write a first business plan for a new venture. We use a multilevel structural equation modeling approach with Bayesian estimation. We found support for our theory expressed in informative hypotheses using Bayesian model selection.

Unfortunately, longitudinal studies that explicitly assess change over time is generally lacking in organizational research and virtually absent in cross-cultural organizational research. The large majority {{of the literature on}} cross-cultural measurement in organization research is focused exclusively on cross-sectional data, addressing cross-cultural differences in measurement and constructs without examining the temporal dimension of measurement and constructs.

40|$|The {{competitiveness}} of firms and regions is increasingly {{dependent on their}} capabilities to organise knowledge <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> <b>unfold</b> between different knowledge providers. In this article {{it is argued that}} this knowledge management in networks is a cognitive <b>process</b> <b>that</b> uses different dimensions of proximity. As much of the knowledge required is 'tacit' in character, 'embedded' social interaction becomes crucial. There are, however, conflicts of interest in business networks. The organisation of knowledge processes thus becomes a complex governance task that depends to a large extent on the characteristics of the learning processes of the sectors involved. This paper offers some empirical evidence from the service sector with the case of M&A activities and from the manufacturing sector with the case of automobile design...|$|R
30|$|Both {{academics}} and practitioners stress {{the crucial role}} played by PMI {{in the success of}} M&A (Zollo and Meier 2008). The PMI process typically comes up against obstacles related to capturing synergy, client disruption, structural integration, employee retention, loss of identity and/or independence, customer retention, emotional trauma, loss of status, and learning challenges. These are so diverse in nature and magnitude that they have given rise to multiple definitions of PMI (see discussion in Graebner et al. 2016). Here, we define post-merger integration as the <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>unfolds</b> {{in the aftermath of the}} deal closure to reconfigure merging firms by redeploying, adding, or divesting resources, lines of products or entire businesses, in order to achieve the expected combination benefits.|$|R

In order to accomplish this task, human resources management will be analyzed as a process which relies in exerting four main functions: ensuring, developing, motivating and maintaining the human resources, which are conditioned by external factors that must be taken into consideration, such as: legislative framework, labor force, unions, cultural context (here one includes management practices and philosophy), and economic circumstances. All these factors are considered to have a significant impact on the management of human resources...|$|R

This conception of emergence as a relation of supervenience, I will argue, is unable {{to make sense of}} the kinds of emergence that are widespread in self-organizing and nonlinear dynamical systems, including distributed cognitive systems. In these dynamical systems, an emergent property is ontological (i. e., the causal capacities of P, where P is an emergent feature, are not reducible to causal capacities of the parts, and may exert a top-down causal influence on the parts of the system) and diachronic (i. e., the relata of emergence are temporally extended, and P emerges as a result of some dynamical lower-level <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> <b>unfold</b> in real time) ...|$|R

Information is encoded in the spatial electromagnetic reflectivity function of virtual point reflectors, and decoded with a conventional range radar receiver. Transmitter diversity and the use of pulse compression radar waveforms are exploited for both increased reliability and increased data rate.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to provide an {{alternative}} antitrust model to the mainstream model that is used in competition policy. I call it the Institutional-Evolutionary Antitrust Model. In order to construct an antitrust model one needs both empirical knowledge and considerations of how to adequately deal with norms. The analysis of competition as an evolutionary <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>unfolds</b> within legal rules provides the empirical foundation for the model. The development of the normative dimension involves the elaboration of a comparative approach. Building on those foundations the main features of the Institutional-Evolutionary Model are sketched out and it is shown that its use leads to systematically different outcomes and conclusions than the dominant antitrust ideals.

40|$|Summary In this {{research}} note, we address {{the role of}} employee emotions during organizational change processes. While prior studies have examined emotions during a single change, such research analyzes emotions and change as snapshot events. In addition, we lack sufficient knowledge {{of the role of}} employee emotions during repeated changes, despite the evidence that organizations increasingly need to adapt to dynamic environments. We address these shortcomings and offer a research agenda on emotions during change, which incorporates the so far neglected view of emotions as <b>processes</b> <b>that</b> <b>unfold</b> during and across organizational changes. Specifically, we illustrate the role of employee emotions during sequential and simultaneous changes and offer six suggestions for future research on emotions in such contexts.

This is done using a differential game theory model to analyse a situation in which support for a party depends on the amount spent on marketing relative to the expenditure of the other party. One of the main results is that, even when voters are not myopic, the logic of the competition forces parties to accelerate expenditure on campaigning during the period between elections.

30|$|In {{a recent}} article, Montello proposes that certain {{elements}} of environments, such as landmarks, are exaggerated in their value for guiding wayfinding decisions and behavior (Montello, 2017). A central tenet of this proposal {{is that when}} empirical research and theory focus {{on the importance of}} a specific environmental element, it overly simplifies and undervalues other important processes such as decision-making, reasoning, and developing and updating spatial representations. The present research suggests that wayfinding research sometimes oversimplifies and undervalues the importance of a dynamic decision-making <b>process</b> <b>that</b> <b>unfolds</b> during wayfinding. While intersections may prompt a decision, and elicit overt behavior that reflects a decision, the process of arriving at a spatial decision often occurs before arriving in the intersection. This finding reveals complex spatial decision dynamics during pedestrian wayfinding and also provides a data foundation for developing future adaptive navigation guidance systems.|$|R
