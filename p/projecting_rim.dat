25|$|From {{pictorial}} sources, it {{is probable}} that the Hypaspists, elite members of the infantry, including the Agema of the King's personal foot guard, employed a shield of larger dimensions, the traditional Greek hoplite shield called the hoplon or aspis (ἀσπίς), it is also referred to as the 'Argive shield'. This shield, also circular, was larger than the phalangite shield, it had sheet-bronze facing over a wooden base; it was held with the left forearm passing through a central armband with a hand-grip set just inside the rim. This shield was more much convex than the phalangite shield and had a <b>projecting</b> <b>rim,</b> both features precluding its use with a double handed pike. The style of shield used by cavalry, if any, is less clear; the heavy cavalry of Alexander's time did not employ shields.|$|E
60|$|True to form, Tarzan at once {{dropped to}} {{his hands and knees}} and searched beneath the bed for the lost gold piece. Strange as it might appear, he had never before looked beneath the bed. He found the gold piece, and {{something}} else he found, too--a small wooden box with a loose cover. Bringing them both out he returned the sovereign to its bag and the bag to its shelf within the cupboard; then he investigated the box. It contained a quantity of cylindrical bits of metal, cone-shaped at one end and flat at the other, with a <b>projecting</b> <b>rim.</b> They were all quite green and dull, coated with years of verdigris.|$|E
60|$|Lying there thus, idly, {{as though}} in a half-sleep, I felt Tommy licking my face, and {{throwing}} my arm about the poor little frightened beast, I watched the great world-balance as it retreated on its eternal journey. At one time its vast <b>projecting</b> <b>rim</b> had overshadowed us and almost seemed to touch the cliff of rock against which we leant. I remember {{that the effect of}} that shining arch a thousand feet or so above our heads was wonderful. It reminded me of a canopy of blackest thunder clouds supported upon a framework of wheeling rainbows, while beneath it all the children of the devil shouted together in joy. I noted this effect only a few seconds before Yva spoke to me and leapt into the path of the flash.|$|E

50|$|Cliona delitrix is a {{burrowing}} sponge {{that is also}} encrusting. It usually {{grows on}} a massive coral, not only covering its surface but also burrowing into its interior, but is sometimes found on some other calcareous substrate such as a shell or a limestone rock. It does not normally grow on branching corals. It can grow to a diameter of up to a metre (yard) and has several large openings called osculi, 10 to 30 mm wide, surrounded by <b>projecting</b> <b>rims</b> and many small raised papillae 2 to 5 mm wide. The colour is usually red or dark orange.|$|R
60|$|Description.--The {{capitulum}} is {{not much}} compressed, a horizontal section giving an oval figure; it is placed obliquely on the peduncle, the scuta descending lower than the terga and carina. There are eight valves, of which the scuta, terga, and carina are large; the rostrum {{and a pair of}} latera are very small and often rudimentary. These three latter valves are essentially distinguished from the scales of the peduncle, the upper ones of which they sometimes hardly exceed in size, by not being moulted at each period of exuviation. The latera overlie the carinal half of the terga; I presume that they are homologous with the carinal latera in Scalpellum. Each successive layer of shell forming the valves is thick, and extends over nearly the whole inner surface; hence the carina and terga, and to a certain extent the scuta, either actually do project freely much beyond the sack, or would have done so, had not their upper ends been removed; for the upper and old layers of shell, in most of the species, either scale off or disintegrate and wear away. A rectangularly <b>projecting</b> <b>rim,</b> serrated by small teeth, is formed at the bottom of each fresh layer of growth, along the external surfaces of each valve (see upper part of fig. 1 b´ Pl. VIII.) This structure, {{as well as that of}} the crenated scales on the peduncle, is important, for by this means the animal, as we shall presently see, forms and enlarges the cavity in the rock or shell in which it is imbedded.|$|E

60|$|Valves white, thin, translucent; {{teeth on}} the <b>projecting</b> <b>rims</b> small, narrow, {{standing}} further apart {{than their own}} width. The upper layers have undergone but little disintegration or scaling off, and consequently the carina and terga project freely. The valves, where not rubbed, are covered by bright yellow membrane, which is thickly clothed with rows of spines; these are small on the exterior surfaces, but are very large and hooked in certain parts, as near the tergal margins of the scuta, and on the carinal margins of the terga, and especially on the inner face of the upper free part of the carina. Here the hooked spines (fig. 4 d) are trifid or quadrifid, and are very conspicuous.|$|R
5000|$|The drums {{are played}} {{near the edge}} of the head, like timpani, these areas are often called [...] "zones". This allows for the optimum {{resonance}} and fundamental tone of the drum to <b>project.</b> <b>Rim</b> shots are not needed to be hit hard depending on the choice of sticks; hard hits can warp aluminum sticks. The player's sticks can move across the main four drums in a pattern that forms a straight line from drum-to-drum, or the closest part of the drum to the player's body. This reduces the amount of space the player must travel to execute some of the more complex movement patterns. It also allows for less upper arm motion from side-to-side, which streamlines movement to play patterns, and also makes it easier to balance the weight of the drums while marching, or even running, with the drums on.|$|R

[...] Disregarding the furious yells of the crowd, he sent arrow after arrow among the men using the sledges and axes. Many of them had steel caps with <b>projecting</b> <b>rims</b> which {{sheltered}} the neck, but as they raised their weapons with both hands over their heads they exposed their chests to the marksman above, and not an arrow that was shot failed to bring down a man. When six had fallen no fresh volunteers came forward to take their places, although another horseman made {{his way up to}} them and endeavoured by persuasions and threats to induce them to continue the work. This man was clad in armour, and wore a steel cap in the place of the knightly helmet.|$|R
5000|$|The Martello {{tower is}} 7.6 m, with a base {{diameter}} of 12 m and 1.2 m thick walls. It has an unusual <b>projecting</b> <b>rim</b> around the parapet. Similar to English towers {{the entrance to}} the fort was through a doorway on the first floor but unlike others the Hambantota tower has a number of loopholes. The ground floor contained a storeroom and magazine. The tower's armaments included two 6-pounder-, three 3-pounder, and a number of 2 and 1-pounder guns. In 1813 a 5-1/2 inch howitzer replaced most of the small guns, and in 1814 two 18-pounder guns were added.|$|E
5000|$|On a [...] "rimless" [...] case, the rim {{has almost}} or {{exactly the same}} {{diameter}} as {{the base of the}} case; the recess formed between the rim and the body of the cartridge is known as an extractor groove, since it forms a lip which can be grasped by an extractor to extract the empty case after being fired. Since there is no rim projecting past the edge of the case, the cartridge must headspace on the case mouth, for a straight walled case, or on the case's shoulder for a bottlenecked case (although a bottlenecked case can headspace on the case mouth, depending on the cartridge); the extractor groove serves only for extraction. The lack of a <b>projecting</b> <b>rim</b> makes rimless cases feed very smoothly from box magazines, and they are primarily used in firearms that feed from a box magazine, although they also work well in belt, drum and tube-fed weapons. Rimless cases are not well suited to break-open and revolver actions, though they can be used with appropriate modifications, such as a spring-loaded extractor or, in a revolver, a moon clip (for example, the Colt or Smith & Wesson M1917 revolvers in [...]45ACP).|$|E
5000|$|The Macedonian phalangite shield, also {{termed the}} 'Telamon shield', was {{circular}} and displayed a slight convexity; its outer surface was faced {{by a thin}} bronze sheet. The inner face of the shield was of wood or a multilayered leather construction, with a band for the forearm fixed to {{the centre of the}} shield. Plutarch noted that the phalangites (phalanx soldiers) carried a small shield on their shoulder. This probably meant that, as both hands were needed to hold the sarissa, the shield was worn suspended by a shoulder strap and steadied by the left forearm passing through the armband. The left hand would project beyond the rim of the shield to grip the sarissa. Recent reconstructions of the sarissa and phalangite shield showed that the shoulder strap supporting the shield effectively helps to transfer some of the weight of the sarissa from the left arm to the shoulders when the sarissa is held horizontally in its fighting position. The Macedonian phalangite shield is described by Asclepiodotus (Tactica, 5) as being eight palms wide (equivalent to 62 cm or 24 inches) and [...] "not too hollow".From pictorial sources, it is probable that the Hypaspists, elite members of the infantry, including the Agema of the King's personal foot guard, employed a shield of larger dimensions, the traditional Greek hoplite shield called the hoplon or aspis (ἀσπίς), it is also referred to as the 'Argive shield'. This shield, also circular, was larger than the phalangite shield, it had sheet-bronze facing over a wooden base; it was held with the left forearm passing through a central armband with a hand-grip set just inside the rim. This shield was more much convex than the phalangite shield and had a <b>projecting</b> <b>rim,</b> both features precluding its use with a double handed pike. The style of shield used by cavalry, if any, is less clear; the heavy cavalry of Alexander's time did not employ shields.|$|E
50|$|Anapithecus weighed {{approximately}} 15 kg, {{about the}} same size as large adult gibbon. Similar to other pliopithecoids Anapithecus had a relatively short face, broad orbits with <b>projecting</b> <b>rims,</b> low cheekbones, and a globular skull. Although similar in size to a gibbon, the jaw bone of Anapithecus is much deeper and more robust. Anapithecus is defined by a series of unique dental characteristics. Most notable among these is the distinctive system of crests found on the first lower molar. The crests form a Y shape between the cusps of the teeth (although this is {{not to be confused with}} Y-5 pattern found on the lower molars of apes). Less is known about postcranial morphology of Anapithecus, as the majority of fossils consist of teeth. Still, analyses have determined that Anapithecus was most likely a suspensory arboreal primate, which swung below from tree branch to tree branch, akin to an ape. This stands in contrast to the smaller pliopithecoids which were thought to walk atop the branches of trees, more similar to monkey.|$|R

40|$|Medical {{implants}} used in {{oral and}} orthopaedic surgery are mainly produced from titanium. Their biological behaviour, e. g. osseointegration, essentially depends {{on both the}} chemical composition and the morphology of the surface. Modifications achieved by excimer laser irradiation of titanium samples were investigated {{in order to improve}} their surface characteristics so as to facilitate biointegration. To enlarge the effective interfacial area of bone-implant contact, holes were ablated by laser pulses of ns or sub-ps length. During ns ablation, crown-like <b>projecting</b> <b>rims</b> formed around the borders of the holes. Ultra-short (0. 5 ps) KrF excimer laser pulses were successfully applied to avoid these undesirable formations. Since a smooth dental implant surface is necessary to maintain a healthy connection with the soft tissues, laser polishing of samples was investigated, too. Irradiation with a series of ns laser pulses resulted in effective smoothing, as measured with atomic force microscope. X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy analysis of the laser-polished titanium surface revealed that laser treatment led to a decrease of the surface contamination and in thickening of the oxide layer. X-ray diffraction measurements demonstrated that the original alpha-titanium crystal structure was preserved. (C) 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
