50|$|Liquid trifluoroacetyl {{chloride}} {{can cause}} frostbite {{if it comes}} in contact with unprotected skin. <b>If</b> <b>inhaled,</b> the compound in its gaseous state will irritate the eyes, skin, and mucous membranes. Absorbing trifluoroacetyl chloride through skin, inhaling it, or ingesting it can cause death. When the compound burns, it produces toxic gases. It also corrodes the respiratory tract. The compound is also a lacrimator. It can cause dyspnea <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> by mice, rats, or guinea pigs. A concentration of 35.3 parts per million of trifluoroacetyl chloride is enough to usually kill a rat in six hours.|$|R
50|$|Aluminum {{chloride}} is a neurotoxin. Anhydrous AlCl3 reacts vigorously with bases, so suitable precautions are required. It {{can cause}} irritation to the eyes, skin, and the respiratory system <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> or on contact.|$|R

50|$|Large {{amounts of}} holmium salts can cause severe damage <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> {{consumed}} orally, or injected. The biological effects of holmium {{over a long}} period of time are not known. Holmium has a low level of acute toxicity.|$|R
50|$|Diglycidyl ether is a {{chemical}} compound {{used as a}} reactive diluent for epoxy resin. Other uses include treating textiles and stabilizing chlorinated organic compounds. It is extremely toxic, and can prove fatal or cause permanent damage <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> or consumed orally.|$|R
50|$|Toxic gases are {{produced}} as an off-gassing from the astronauts, non-metallic materials e.g. surface coatings, adhesives, elastomers, solvents, cleaning agents, heat exchanger liquids etc. The gases <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> above specific concentrations {{could affect the}} ability of the crew to carry out their duties effectively.|$|R
5000|$|Magnesium {{chromate}} hydrate {{should be}} stored at room temperature, {{and there is}} no current therapeutic use. [...] It is a suspected carcinogen, and can cause acute and dermititis, and possibly kidney and liver damage <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> so it should be treated as a hazardous waste.|$|R
5000|$|Methacryloyloxyethyl {{isocyanate}} is {{an extremely}} poisonous liquid which can be fatal <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> absorbed through skin, or consumed orally. To a lesser extent it can burn eyes and skin on contact. [...] It {{is used as a}} cross-linker in the production of synthetic resins.|$|R
5000|$|Do not use {{power to}} {{suppress}} opinions you think <b>pernicious,</b> for <b>if</b> {{you do the}} opinions will suppress you.|$|R
25|$|Water {{has several}} {{systematic}} names, including oxidane (the IUPAC name), hydrogen oxide, and dihydrogen monoxide (DHMO). The latter {{was the basis}} of the dihydrogen monoxide hoax, a document that was circulated warning readers of the dangers of the chemical (for example, it is fatal <b>if</b> <b>inhaled).</b>|$|R
2500|$|Fe(CO)5 is toxic, {{which is}} of concern because of its {{volatility}} (vapour pressure: [...] at 20°C). [...] <b>If</b> <b>inhaled,</b> iron pentacarbonyl may cause lung irritation, toxic pneumonitis, or pulmonary edema. [...] Like other metal carbonyls, Fe(CO)5 is flammable. It is, however, considerably less toxic than nickel tetracarbonyl.|$|R

2500|$|Sour gas, {{as it is}} known, in {{its natural}} state is laced with {{hydrogen}} sulfide (H2S), which can be lethal <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> in even tiny concentrations. (The more general term acid gas refers to natural gas with any acidic gas in it - carbon dioxide (CO2), for example.) ...|$|R
50|$|Ethyl bromoacetate is the {{chemical}} compound with the formula CH2BrCO2C2H5. It is the ethyl ester of bromoacetic acid and is prepared in two steps from acetic acid. It is a lachrymator {{and has a}} fruity, pungent odor. It is also a highly toxic alkylating agent and may be fatal <b>if</b> <b>inhaled.</b>|$|R
50|$|Fluorinert may {{be harmful}} <b>if</b> <b>inhaled,</b> and {{care should be}} taken to avoid contact with eyes and skin. No health effects are {{expected}} by ingestion of Fluorinert, however.Use should be constrained to closed systems and reduced volumes, as fluorinated oils have a very high global-warming potential and a long atmospheric lifetime.|$|R
50|$|MAPP is colorless in both {{liquid and}} gas form. The gas has a {{pronounced}} acetylene-like or fishy odor at concentrations above 100 ppm, {{due to the}} addition of substituted amines as a polymerization inhibitor. Low molecular weight alkynes have strong odors. MAPP gas is toxic <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> at high concentrations.|$|R
5000|$|The cobalt based HIC {{producers}} {{says that}} if a humidity indicator is considered {{an article in the}} EC definition and therefore has no labeling requirements if the content of cobalt(II) chloride by weight is <0.25%. The T (toxic) and R49 (may cause cancer <b>if</b> <b>inhaled)</b> is not applicable because a humidity indicator cannot be inhaled.|$|R
5000|$|Tuberculosis {{is one of}} {{many other}} infections that occurs in the lower {{respiratory}} tract. You can contract this infection from airborne droplets, and <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> you are at risk of this disease. This is a bacterial infection which deteriorates the lung tissue resulting in coughing up blood. This infection is deadly if not treated.|$|R
5|$|Like other rare-earth metals, {{lutetium}} {{is regarded}} as having a low degree of toxicity, but its compounds should be handled with care nonetheless: for example, lutetium fluoride inhalation is dangerous and the compound irritates skin. Lutetium nitrate may be dangerous as it may explode and burn once heated. Lutetium oxide powder is toxic as well <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> or ingested.|$|R
50|$|Cycloheptane is a {{cycloalkane}} {{with the}} molecular formula C7H14. Cycloheptane {{is used as}} a nonpolar solvent for the chemical industry and as an intermediate in the manufacture of chemicals and pharmaceutical drugs.

50|$|Acetyl cyanide's {{toxicological}} properties {{have not}} been thoroughly investigated. However, {{it is known that}} the molecule is toxic <b>if</b> <b>inhaled</b> and would cause a respiratory tract irritation. Also the chemical may cause skin irritation if absorbed through the skin. The compound's toxic affects would target the peripheral nervous system, central nervous system, and the blood stream.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, acute {{exposure}} to Raney nickel may cause irritation of the respiratory tract and nasal cavities, and causes pulmonary fibrosis <b>if</b> <b>inhaled.</b> Ingestion {{may lead to}} convulsions and intestinal disorders.
