50|$|Membrane <b>proteins</b> are <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> {{interact}} with, or {{are part}} of, biological membranes. They include integral membrane <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> are permanently anchored {{or part of}} the membrane and peripheral membrane <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> are only temporarily attached to the lipid bilayer or to other integral proteins. The integral membrane proteins are classified as transmembrane <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> span across the membrane and integral monotopic <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> are attached to only one side of the membrane. Membrane proteins are a common type of proteins along with soluble globular proteins, fibrous proteins, and disordered proteins. They are targets of over 50% of all modern medicinal drugs. It is estimated that 20-30% of all genes in most genomes encode membrane proteins.|$|R
50|$|An overlay assay is a {{biological}} technique {{used to find}} <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> bind to a protein of interest. It begins with <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> are dispersed but fixed (e.g. a tissue slice or run on a membrane by gel electrophoresis) and then incubated in the labelled protein of interest. The label will indicate the location of <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> bind to the protein of interest.|$|R
50|$|<b>Proteins</b> <b>that</b> are ubiquitinated are {{delivered}} to the JUNQ, where they are processed for degradation by the proteasome. Misfolded <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> are not ubiquitinated and terminally aggregated are sequestered to the IPOD.|$|R
5|$|Troponin I, cardiac {{muscle is}} a <b>protein</b> <b>that</b> in humans is encoded by the TNNI3 gene.|$|E
5|$|Another {{model for}} the {{evolution}} of circular permutations is the fission and fusion model. The process starts with two partial proteins. These may represent two independent polypeptides (such as two parts of a heterodimer), or may have originally been halves of a single <b>protein</b> <b>that</b> underwent a fission event to become two polypeptides.|$|E
5|$|Being a {{transcription}} factor, a <b>protein</b> <b>that</b> binds {{to specific}} DNA sites and thereby regulates {{the activity of}} specific genes, Tbr1 is localized in the nucleus where the cellâ€™s DNA is located. Tbr1 is expressed in glutamergic neurons rather than GABAergic neurons.|$|E
40|$|Bronchopulmonary {{dysplasia}} (BPD) is {{the most}} common, serious sequela of premature birth. Inflammation is {{a major contributor to}} the pathogenesis of BPD. Often initiated by a pulmonary fetal inflammatory response, lung inflammation is exacerbated by mechanical ventilation and exposure to supplemental oxygen. In response to these initiators of injury, a complex interaction occurs between <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> attract inflammatory cells (ie, chemokines), <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> facilitate the transendothelial migration of inflammatory cells from blood vessels (ie, adhesion molecules), <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> promote tissue damage (ie, pro-inflammatory cytokines and proteases), and <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> modulate the process (eg, anti-inflammatory cytokines, binding proteins and receptor antagonists).

5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{are composed}} of several protein domains, i.e. segments of a <b>protein</b> <b>that</b> fold into distinct structural units. Domains usually also have specific functions, such as enzymatic activities (e.g. kinase) or they serve as binding modules (e.g. the SH3 domain binds to proline-rich sequences in other proteins).|$|E
5|$|Toxins of type I {{systems are}} small, {{hydrophobic}} <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> confer toxicity by damaging cell membranes.

5000|$|Humanin was {{independently}} {{found by}} three different labs looking at different parameters. The first to publish, in 2001, was the Nishimoto lab, which found humanin while looking for possible <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> could protect cells from amyloid beta, {{a major component}} of Alzheimer's disease. [...] The Reed lab found humanin when screening for <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> could interact with Bcl-2-associated X protein (Bax), a major protein involved in apoptosis.

40|$|Aberrations in <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> control {{apoptosis}} {{and cell}} survival {{are common in}} cancer. These aberrations often reside in signalling <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> control the activation of the apoptotic machinery or in the Bcl- 2 family of <b>proteins</b> <b>that</b> control caspase activation. Recent evidence suggests that caspase 2, {{one of the most}} evolutionarily conserved caspases, may have multiple roles in the DNA damage response, cell cycle regulation and tumour suppression. These findings are unexpected and have important implications for our understanding of tumorigenesis and the treatment of cancer. Sharad Kuma...|$|R
5|$|When applied through cut {{petioles}} in Petunia, HypSys did not {{induce the}} production of protease inhibitors, but instead increased expression of defensin, a gene which produces a <b>protein</b> <b>that</b> inserts into microbial membranes, forming a pore. Defensin expression is also induced by AtPEP1.|$|E
5|$|Antibodies can {{continue}} {{to be an effective}} defence mechanism even after viruses have managed to gain entry to the host cell. A <b>protein</b> <b>that</b> is in cells, called TRIM21, can attach to the antibodies {{on the surface of the}} virus particle.

5|$|Apo{{lipoprotein}} B, in its ApoB100 form, is {{the main}} apolipoprotein, or protein part of the lipoprotein particle. Its gene {{is located on the}} second chromosome (2p24-p23) and is between 21.08 and 21.12Mb long. FH is often associated with the mutation of R3500Q, which causes replacement of arginine by glutamine at position 3500. The mutation is located on a part of the <b>protein</b> <b>that</b> normally binds with the LDL receptor, and binding is reduced {{as a result of the}} mutation. Like LDLR, the number of abnormal copies determines the severity of the hypercholesterolemia.|$|E
