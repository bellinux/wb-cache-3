5|$|Trees are {{the source}} of many of the world's best known fleshy fruits. Apples, pears, plums, {{cherries}} and citrus are all grown commercially in temperate climates and a wide range of edible fruits are found in the tropics. Other commercially important fruit include dates, figs and olives. Palm oil is obtained from the fruits of the oil palm (Elaeis guineensis). The fruits of the cocoa tree (Theobroma cacao) are used to make cocoa and chocolate and the berries of coffee trees, Coffea arabica and Coffea canephora, are processed to extract the coffee beans. In many rural areas of the world, fruit is gathered from forest trees for consumption. Many trees bear edible nuts which can loosely be described as being large, oily kernels found inside a hard shell. These include coconuts (Cocos nucifera), Brazil nuts (Bertholletia excelsa), pecans (Carya illinoinensis), hazel nuts (Corylus), almonds (Prunus dulcis), walnuts (Juglans regia), <b>pistachios</b> (<b>Pistacia</b> <b>vera)</b> and many others. They are high in nutritive value and contain high-quality protein, vitamins and minerals as well as dietary fibre. Walnuts are particularly beneficial to health and contain a higher level of antioxidants than do other nuts. A variety of nut oils are extracted by pressing for culinary use; some such as walnut, pistachio and hazelnut oils are prized for their distinctive flavours, but they tend to spoil quickly.|$|E

Trace amounts of undeclared pistachio allergens can pose serious health risks for food-allergic consumers, including severe anaphylactic reactions. A highly sensitive analytical method, sandwich-type enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) is applied as a critical tool for food manufacturers and food scientists to detect minute amounts of allergenic food residues in processed foods. The aim {{of the study was to}} develop an ELISA for the detection and quantification of pistachio residues in processed foods. California raw pistachios and a mixture of Californian, Iranian, and Turkish roasted pistachios were used as immunogens to immunize one sheep, one goat, and three rabbits. Both raw and roasted pistachio ELISAs were developed by using pooled sheep antisera as the capture reagent and pooled rabbit antisera as the detector reagent. Binding of antigen-antibody complex was visualized through a colorimetric reaction involving goat anti-rabbit IgG antibody (labeled with alkaline phosphatase) and substrate (p-nitrophenyl phosphate). A total of 102 food ingredients were evaluated using the developed pistachio ELISA for potential cross-reactivity. Vanilla ice cream and sugar cookies with known amounts of pistachio were prepared as manufactured model foods. The sensitivity, specificity, and robustness of the assay were determined by the percent of recovery from both of the model foods. The optimized ELISA had a limit of quantification (LOQ) of 3 ̆c 1 ppm 3 ̆e(1 μg/g). Minor cross-reactivity was observed with cashew at a level equivalent to 4 ppm of roasted pistachio. The performance of the ELISA was not affected in the presence of the ice cream and cookie matrices. The mean percent recovery of pistachio from the vanilla ice cream, cookie dough, and baked sugar cookie are 115 ± 3. 0, 131 ± 20. 8, and 53. 9 ± 3. 0 respectively. The pistachio-ELISA developed in this study is sufficiently specific and sensitive to be used to help food manufacturers in complying with the FDA labeling guidelines and to safeguard allergic consumers from undeclared pistachio residues...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT. <b>Pistachio</b> (<b>Pistacia</b> <b>vera)</b> nuts with {{shell and}} kernel defects detract from {{consumer}} acceptance and, in some cases, {{may be more}} prone to insect damage, mold decay, and/or aflatoxin contamination.

Imaging algorithms were developed to distinguish normal nuts from those nuts with oily stains, dark stains, and adhering hull as well as nuts having kernel defects. Image algorithm testing on a validation data set showed that nuts having oily stain, dark stain, or adhering hull could be distinguished from normal nuts with an accuracy of 98 %. Removing nuts with oily stain, dark stain, and adhering hull will also remove 89. 7 % of nuts with kernel decay, 93. 8 % of nuts with Aspergillus molds present, and 98. 7 % of NOW positive nuts...|$|R

The efficiency of phenol removal from synthetic solutions was assessed with the use of kinetic and equilibrium experiments. The experimental results show that the KOH-modified biochar exhibited the highest phenol removal efficiency. Hydrophobic sorption on its surface is the main phenol removal mechanism.

Results showed the total polyphenol content of increased with the roasting treatment; however, not all phenolic compounds demonstrated this behavior. With regard to the aroma and aroma-active compounds, the results indicated that roasting process results in the development of characteristics and pleasant aroma of pistachio samples due to the Maillard reaction.

Although adult pistachio trees are well known to be drought tolerant, the studies on physiological adaptation of pistachio cultivars to drought are limited. Therefore, three pistachio cultivars, i. e., Akbari, Kaleghochi, and Ohadi were subjected to three osmotic drought stress treatments: control (- 0. 1 MPa), moderate (- 0. 75 MPa) and severe drought (- 1. 5 MPa) stress using PEG 6000 for a 14 -day period. All drought stress treatments decreased net photosynthesis (Pn), stomatal conductance (gs), intercellular CO 2 concentration (Ci), and transpiration rate (E), but Ohadi maintained better its photosynthetic capacity compared to Akbari and Kaleghochi. Maximum quantum yield of PSII photochemistry (Fv/Fm), effective PSII quantum yield (UPSII) and photochemical quenching (qP) were also reduced. The chlorophyll fluorescence parameters indicated that Akbari was more susceptible to the applied drought stress. Drought stress levels decreased chlorophyll pigments, fresh weight, stem elongation, leaf nitrogen content (N), leaf water potential and increased water use efficiency (WUE). Proline increased strongly under drought stress for Akbari. After 2 weeks of stress a recovery of 2 weeks was applied.
