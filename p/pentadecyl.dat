40|$|Seven new chromone-containing polyketides, termed cystochromones A-G, were {{isolated}} from the myxobacterial strain Cystobacter sp. MCy 9104. Their structures were elucidated using comprehensive NMR spectroscopy and HR-MS/MS. Cystochromones bear a <b>pentadecyl</b> moiety unusually attached at C- 5 of the chromone ring. Moreover, isotope-labeled substrate feeding experiments and NMR analysis suggested a hybrid iso-fatty acid and polyketide synthase biosynthetic pathway for these secondary metabolites...|$|E
40|$|Three novel {{series of}} non-isoprenoidal dialkyl {{glycerol}} diethers with an inferred sn- 1, 2 stereochemistry were tentatively identified in carbonate crusts precipitated from methane-rich bottom-waters and pore-waters associated with Mediterranean mud volcanoes. In the first series of diethers, an 11, 12 -methylenehexadecyl moiety is ether-bound at the sn- 2 {{position of the}} glycerol group, and in diethers from the second series, an anteiso <b>pentadecyl</b> group is ether-bound at the sn- 2 position. In the third and minor series a <b>pentadecyl</b> moiety is ether-bound at the sn- 2 position. In all series, ether-bound C 14 C 17 alkyl units (either n-alkyl, branched alkyl, alkylcyclohexyl or methylenealkyl) occur at the sn- 1 position. The two major series are also distinguished by their 13 C values, which differ by 15  30  at the sites studied. Only the minor series has been previously reported in sediments. Members of {{the second and third}} series are similar to diethers containing C 16 C 18 iso, anteiso, and n-alkyl units present in the thermophilic bacteria Thermodesulfobacterium commune, Ammonifex degensii and Aquifex pyrophilus. The first series is unique, in that diethers possessing alkyl chains that contain a cyclopropane ring have never been reported...|$|E

40|$|Supramolecular {{hierarchical}} conducting nanostructures {{are obtained}} by complexing amphiphilic oligomers with block copolymers. Nominally each pyridine group of poly(styrene) -block-poly(4 -vinyl pyridine), i. e. (PS-block-P 4 VP), is first protonated by {{methane sulphonic acid}} (MSA) to yield PS-block-P 4 VP(MSA) (1. 0). It is further hydrogen bonded with stoichiometric amount of <b>pentadecyl</b> phenol (PDP) to form PS-block-P 4 VP(MSA) (1. 0) (PDP) (1. 0). The polyelectrolytic domains are subject to reversible phase transitions from "semi Id" slabs to 2 d lamellae and further to Id cylinders upon heating. The transitions manifest in the thermally activated conductivity. Extension to conjugated polymers is discussed to achieve temperature controlled switching based on electronic conductivity...|$|E
40|$|A {{characteristic}} intermediate segregation type {{chain length}} {{dependence of the}} long period D of the lamellar microdomain structure of a class of comb-coil supramolecules is reported. The supramolecular comb-coil diblock copolymers studied consist of a polystyrene (PS) “coil” block and a “comb” block of poly(4 -vinylpyridine) (P 4 VP) either hydrogen bonded to <b>pentadecyl</b> phenol (PDP) (i. e., P 4 VP(PDP) -b-PS) or first protonated with methanesulfonic acid (MSA) and then hydrogen bonded to PDP (i. e., P 4 VP(MSA) (PDP) -b-PS). In both cases we find a scaling D ~ Ntotδ, δ ≈ 0. 8, where Ntot denotes {{the total number of}} monomers of the P 4 VP-b-PS backbone. In the case of diblock copolymers this would correspond to a characteristic intermediate segregation regime behavior. Pure PS-b-P 4 VP, on the other hand, shows the expected strong segregation behavior D ~ Ntotδ, δ ≈ 0. 7. ...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2000 This {{dissertation}} contains solid-state NMR {{studies of}} the structure and dynamics of the biomineralization protein, salivary statherin, adsorbed onto its relevant biomineral surface, hydroxyapatite. The structure of statherin and the N-terminal 15 residue peptide were studied using both homonculear and heteronuclear dipolar recoupling techniques. 13 C- 13 C DRAWS experiments were employed to determine the backbone torsion angle ϕ for samples isotopically labeled at the backbone carbonyl positions at the following residues: pS 2 pS 3, F 7 L 8 and I 11 G 12, in both the peptide and the full protein. These measurements indicate that the peptide is disordered at the pS 2 pS 3, region with the remaining residues adopting a helical conformation. In contrast, the full protein, studied under hydrated conditions, was found to adopt a well-defined helix {{throughout most of the}} <b>pentadecyl</b> domain. The heteronuclear recoupling technique, REDOR, was used to confirm the helical content by measuring the distance between the backbone 13 C=O and H 15 N participating in the hydrogen bond of the alpha-helix. The peptide was labeled at L 8 G 12 and was found to be helical {{both on and off the}} surface. The full protein was labeled throughout the <b>pentadecyl</b> region at pS 3 F 7 and L 8 G 12, and agreed with the DRAWS results, supporting a largely helical N-terminus. The dynamics of the peptide and protein under hydrated conditions were studied using T 1 rho relaxation measurements and line shape analysis. In both cases the pS 2 pS 3, region was found to be very immobile, thus interacting very strongly with the hydroxyapatite surface. The F 7 L 8 region was slightly more mobile in the peptide and even more so in the protein. The I 11 G 12 region experienced a great deal of high frequency and large amplitude motion in the peptide, but had more constrained mobility in the protein. These findings indicate that the highly charged region of the N-terminus is strongly interacting with the surface of hydroxyapatite, indicating the importance of the N-terminal pentapeptide in the binding of statherin, while the remainder of the domain is only weakly interacting with the surface...|$|E
40|$|Reversible {{acetylation}} of nucleosomal histones and nonhistone proteins play pivotal {{roles in}} the regulation of all the DNA templated phenomenon. Dysfunction of the enzymes involved in the acetylation/deacetylation leads to several diseases. Therefore, these enzymes are the targets for new generation therapeutics. Here, we report the synthesis of trifluoromethyl phenyl benzamides and their effect on histone acetyltransferase (HAT) activity of p 300. One of these benzamides, CTPB (N-(4 -chloro- 3 -trifluoromethyl-phenyl) - 2 -ethoxy- 6 -pentadecyl-benzamide), was discovered as a potent activator of the p 300 HAT activity. We have found that <b>pentadecyl</b> hydrocarbon chain of CTPB is required to activate the HAT only under certain context. Furthermore, our {{results show that the}} relative position of -CF 3 and -Cl in CTB (N-(4 -chloro- 3 -trifluoromethyl-phenyl) - 2 -ethoxy-benzamide) is also very critical for the activation. Surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS) of p 300 and the HAT activator complexes evidently suggest that the activation of HAT activity is achieved by the alteration of p 300 structure. Therefore, apart from elucidating the chemical basis for small molecule mediated activation of p 300, this report also describes, for the first time, Raman spectroscopic analysis of the complexes of histone-modifying enzymes and their modulators, which may be highly useful for therapeutic applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{major factors}} {{determining}} the potential-driven phase {{changes of the}} films of 4 -pyridyl terminated water-insoluble neutral surfactants on a Au(111) electrode were described using the results of dc and ac voltammetric measurements. In total six surfactants were used to elucidate the effects of electronic property of the 4 -pyridyl head group, hydrogen bonding ability between amide groups, direction of the amide bond, and bulkiness around the head group upon the potential dependent reorientation and adsorption-desorption processes. Comparison {{of the behavior of}} <b>pentadecyl</b> 4 -pyridyl ether (C 15 -O-Py) and 1 -pyridin- 4 -yl-hexadecan- 1 -one (C 15 -(C=O) -Py), possessing respectively, the highest and lowest excess electronic charge on the pyridyl nitrogen among the six surfactants, revealed that the latter exhibits more distinct reorientation of pyridyl group corresponding to phase transition between condensed and loose-packed states and narrower potential region of the compact film formation. Introduction of amide group in the alkyl chains of the surfactants reduced the packing of the adsorbed film in the potential region of the compact film formation,as evidenced by an increase of the differential capacitance. It was found that the existence of amide group facilitates the potential-driven phase transition of closely packed film from a condensed state to a loosely packed state, whereas it suppresses the transition of loosely packed film. The concomitant steric effect was also discussed...|$|E
40|$|Earlier {{reported}} {{results on}} the adsorption/desorption behaviors of single surfactant as well as mixtures of surfactant of tetradecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (TTAC) and <b>pentadecyl</b> ethoxylated nonyl phenol (NP- 15) indicated that the phenomena in mixed surfactant systems are more complex than those in single surfactant systems. To better understand the mechanisms involved in adsorption and desorption processes of mixed surfactant system, changes in the ratios of TTAC:NP- 15 mixtures after adsorption both at the alumina-water interface and in the bulk are discussed in this report. It {{was found that the}} initial mixing ratios of TTAC:NP- 15 changed significantly after adsorption over the concentration ranges studied. The adsorption behavior is directly related to these changes of mixing ratios. The possible structure of the adsorbed layer is also discussed for dfferent mixing ratios. In the low concentration range, electrostatic attraction between the cationic surfactant, TTAC, and the negatively charged alumina surface is dominant and the adsorption of TTAC,is higher than that of NP- 15. With an increase in total surfactant concentration pre-adsorbed TTAC molecules function as anchors and induce the adsorption of NP- 15. Strong synergism between the two surfactants is observed over this concentration range. Adsorbed pentadecylethoxylated nonyl phenol (NP- 15) provides a steric barrier to further adsorption of tetradecyl trimethyl ammonium chloride (TTAC), and the adsorption of TTAC is suppressed. To develop a model that can predict adsorption of both components as a function of their activity in the mixed surfactant system, the monomer concentrations of TTAC and NP- 15 in mixtures of different ratios were measured using ultrafiltration. Interestingly, the monomer concentrations measured by ultrafiltration method were different from the predictions of the regular solution theory...|$|E
40|$|Sorghum bicolor is {{considered}} to be an allelopathic crop species, producing phytotoxins such as the lipid benzoquinone sorgoleone, which likely accounts for many of the allelopathic properties of Sorghum spp. Current evidence suggests that sorgoleone biosynthesis occurs exclusively in root hair cells and involves the production of an alkylresorcinolic intermediate (5 -[(Z,Z) - 82 ̆ 7, 112 ̆ 7, 142 ̆ 7 -pentadecatrienyl]resorcinol) derived from an unusual 16 : 3 D 9, 12, 15 fatty acyl-CoA starter unit. This led to the suggestion of the involvement of one or more alkylresorcinol synthases (ARSs), type III polyketide synthases (PKSs) that produce 5 -alkylresorcinols using medium to long-chain fatty acyl-CoA starter units via iterative condensations with malonyl-CoA. In an effort to characterize the enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of the <b>pentadecyl</b> resorcinol intermediate, a previously described expressed sequence tag database prepared from isolated S. bicolor (genotype BTx 623) root hairs was first mined for all PKS-like sequences. Quantitative real-time RT-PCR analyses revealed that three of these sequences were preferentially expressed in root hairs, two of which (designated ARS 1 and ARS 2) were found to encode ARS enzymes capable of accepting a variety of fatty acyl-CoA starter units in recombinant enzyme studies. Furthermore, RNA interference experiments directed against ARS 1 and ARS 2 resulted in the generation of multiple independent transformant events exhibiting dramatically reduced sorgoleone levels. Thus, both ARS 1 and ARS 2 are likely to participate in the biosynthesis of sorgoleone in planta. The sequences of ARS 1 and ARS 2 were also used to identify several rice (Oryza sativa) genes encoding ARSs, which are likely involved in the production of defense-related alkylresorcinols...|$|E
