These clearings are not peculiar to Africa. In all tropical countries, natives use the same methods of <b>preparing</b> <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>cultivation.</b> They fell trees and burn them and set fire to those left standing. After one or two crops, they abandon the exhausted soil. A low, dense growth of shrubs, small trees, and creepers, termed secondary scrub, rapidly invades the cleared space. It consists of species {{different from those of the}} original forest. The natives meanwhile start clearing further tracts of forest where the humus and soil, enriched by wood ash from burnt vegetation, will provide adequate crops.|$|E
40|$|Sir : I {{have the}} honor to {{transmit}} herewith for publication a bulletin [...] containing some suggestions to pioneer farmers in Alaska, prepared [...] by Prof. C. C. Georgeson, {{special agent in}} charge of Alaska investigations. [...] The bulletin is devoted mainly to a discussion of the preliminary [...] operations of selecting and <b>preparing</b> <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>cultivation</b> [...] under Alaska conditions, indicating briefly the kinds of crops which [...] have been found to succeed in Alaska and the methods of manuring [...] which may be used with advantage in certain cases. The advice given [...] is based upon the results of investigations carried on in the Territory [...] since 1893, and it is believed that it will prove timely and useful to [...] the increasing number of persons who are undertaking the home [...] production of some of the necessities of life in Alaska. [...] Very respectfully, [...] A. C. True, [...] Director. A study of the agricultural resources and capabilities of Alaska [...] was begun under authority of Congress in 1898. Results of the earlier [...] preliminary surveys seemed to justify the continuation and extension [...] of the work and its establishment on a more definite and permanent [...] basis. This has been carried out by the organization of a system of [...] stations for observation and experiment at different points in the [...] Territory which seem best adapted to the purposes in view. Stations [...] have now been established at Sitka (the headquarters), Kenai, and [...] Rampart on the Yukon. Five reports giving the results of the agricultural [...] investigations in Alaska have been issued as Congressional [...] documents and bulletins of the Office of Experiment Stations, U. S. [...] Department of Agriculture. [...] Those who have received these reports and who have noted the [...] letters which are published in them from settlers in nearly all parts [...] of the territory south of the Arctic Circle can doubt no longer that [...] Alaska has agricultural possibilities. These letters bear testimony [...] that hardy vegetables have been grown with marked success almost [...] everywhere in Alaska where they have been tried, and that, likewise, [...] early maturing grains have been grown successfully in many places [...] (Pls. I and II). Potatoes, cauliflower, cabbage, kale, peas, lettuce, [...] turnips, ruta-bagas, and radishes have been grown at nearly every [...] white settlement in the coast region and in many places in the interior [...] (Pls. Ill and IV). Early maturing varieties of barley, oats, and spring [...] wheat have yielded well at Dawson, in the Yukon territory, and at [...] Eagle, Alaska, near the Canadian boundary. At Rampart, on the sixty-fifth [...] parallel, a station was established by the Department of Agriculture [...] in the summer of 1900. Winter rye seeded there in August of that [...] year lived through the winter under a good covering of snow; although [...] the temperature fell to 70 degrees below zero, it came out in the [...] spring in perfect condition and matured grain by the 1 st of August, [...] 1901. Barley seeded at this station in May was ripe by the middle [...] of August. At the headquarters station, at Sitka, spring wheat has [...] matured with good results for three years past, and barley and oats [...] have been grown there for four years. These grains have likewise [...] been grown successfully at the experiment station at Kenai, on Kenai [...] Peninsula. Barley, oats, and wheat have prospered well at Copper [...] Center, in the Copper River country, and oats have been grown to [...] maturity on Steele Creek, a tributary of the Fortymile, in latitude [...] 64 Â°. Oats and barley have been matured at Skagway; Killisnoo, on [...] the coast, and at Selkirk, on the Upper Yukon. [...] The reports referred to give data from many other parts of the [...] Territory which are proof that it is possible to farm successfully in [...] Alaska if one understands the conditions and proceeds in his methods [...] of work in accordance with the teachings of experience in Alaska. [...] The pioneer who comes to Alaska to farm often finds that it is not [...] safe to follow the customs with which he is familiar in regions farther [...] south. The season is shorter than it is in the States and he must, in [...] order to insure success, select early maturing varieties of both vegetables [...] and grains. In the coast region the climate is wet and the soil [...] is often water-logged, making drainage necessary in many places; [...] Again, the pioneer soon learns that new soil, which contains more [...] or less vegetable matter, does not yield satisfactory crops until it has [...] been cultivated for two or three years. When he sows good seed on [...] what appears to be rich soil, and the crop makes only an indifferent [...] growth, he is apt to blame the climate for the result, when, as a matter [...] of fact, the partial failure is due, in most cases, to the condition of the [...] soil and not to the climate. These peculiarities in Alaska should be [...] well understood at the outset, and it is chiefly to point out the causes [...] of failure to those who have had little or no experience in Alaska, and [...] to call attention to practical methods of doing the work, that these [...] suggestions are offered...|$|E

40|$|This thesis has {{explored}} {{the diffusion of}} tile drainage in Delaware County, Indiana. The study discussed some of the deterrents that hampered agricultural development in the county. These obstacles included the presence of thick forests, vast areas of swampy lands, poor transportation facilities {{and the absence of}} local markets. Methods of overcoming some of these problems were then discussed. These included the clearing of forests to <b>prepare</b> <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>cultivation,</b> and the use of open ditches and clay tiles to drain the marshes. In addition, the introduction of new drainage techniques such as the laser beam, plow drain, and plastic tile were also discussed. The rate of adoption of plastic tile was then tested statistically to find out if it followed any pattern of distribution. Data obtained through interviews with selected farmers revealed that such an innovation will tend to approximate a growth or "S"-curve in about 1980. The study concluded that the majority of Delaware County farmers are still using clay or concrete tiles. Thesis (M. A. ...|$|R

40|$|An {{investigation}} {{of the relationship between}} the physical, pedological and anthropogenic influences on landslide occurrence on the midslopes within and outside Mt Elgon National Park was carried out. One of the landslides occurred in a protected pristine forest environment within the Park while the other two were located at sites deforested <b>for</b> <b>cultivation</b> within and outside the National Park. Field based surveys, GIS techniques and laboratory tests were used to collect and analyze the data. A household survey was undertaken to establish the main community livelihood strategies, the drivers of land use change and implications <b>for</b> <b>land</b> degradation on the mid slopes of Mt Elgon. Aerial photographs taken in 1960 and orthophoto maps formed the benchmark for the analysis of the respective land use changes between 1995 and 2006, using 30 m Landsat TM and 20 m SPOT MS images in IDRISI Andes GIS environment. Landslide sites were mapped using a Magellan Professional MobileMapperTMCX and terrain parameters were derived using a 15 M Digital Elevation Model. A hybrid supervised/unsupervised classification approach was employed to generate land cover maps from which the areal extent of three land cover classes (agricultural fields, woodlands and forests) was calculated. Particle size distribution and atterberg limits were used to test the hypothesis that soils at the landslide sites are inherently âproblem soilsâ where slope failure can occur even without human intervention. Shear strength parameters (internal of friction and cohesion) were used calculate the slope factor of safety to ascertain slope stability at pristine and disturbed landslide sites. Results from the socio-economic survey revealed that smallholder subsistence agriculture and encroachment on the National Park resources are the main sources of livelihoods for the communities surrounding the Park. The communities also have a strong socio-cultural attachment to the National Park, as it is the source of items used during traditional rituals like circumcision. Encroachment is driven by the high population pressure and the prevalent political climate. Farmers mainly use slash and burn technique to <b>prepare</b> <b>land</b> <b>for</b> <b>cultivation</b> and those close to the National Park are reluctant to adopt appropriate farming and soil conservation practices due to the uncertainties surrounding their future on such plots. Slash and burn iii techniques were observed to accelerate various forms of erosion including rills, gullies and sheet. Soil and water conservation techniques were mainly practiced on privately owned farms. The period 1960 and 1995 was characterized by minimal land use changes and no encroachment into the designated Mount Elgon National Park. Conversely, the period 1995 â 2006 marked a significant loss of woodlands and forest cover particularly on steep concave slopes (36 Âº â 58 Âº) within the National Park. The land use change trends were attributed to the prevalent land politics and exponential population growth in the region. The encroachment onto the critical slopes was noted to have induced a series of shallow and deep landslides in the area. Deforestation on Mt Elgon was reported to have both onsite and offsite climate variability and implications in the form of drought, heat waves, flash floods, economic dislocation, crop failure and associated malnutrition in surrounding low lying areas. The soils on pristine and disturbed slopes contain high amount of clay (> 10 percent), are fine textured (> 50 percent of the material passing the 0. 075 mm sieve) and highly plastic. These soil attributes imply low permeability, excessive water retention and high susceptibility to expansion and sliding. The vertic nature of soils at Nametsi was confirmed by the extremely high plasticity indices (averaging 33 percent), while, high liquid limits at Buwabwala (53 percent) and Kitati (59 percent) qualified the soils as vertisols which are associated with landslides. The results point to the fact that soils at landslide sites are inherently âproblem soilsâ where slope failure can occur even without human intervention. Therefore, the hypothesis that soils at three landslide sites are inherently âproblem soilsâ where slope failure can occur even without human intervention is accepted. Notwithstanding the fact that the study was focussed on mid-altitude slopes of Mt Elgon, the results are in tandem with investigations carried out earlier on the lower densely populated slopes, thus confirming the widespread nature of problem soils on Mt Elgon. There is an urgent need to control human population growth and restore forest cover on the heavily deforested steep slopes particularly within the National Park, and restrain communities from encroaching on the pristine slopes of Mt Elgon. This will be achieved if the politicians, Park Authorities and local communities jointly participate in the design and implementation of CFMs. Future research could focus on climate change implications of deforestation of Mt Elgon environments and quantification of carbon loss related to deforestation and soil degradation in the mountain environment...|$|R
