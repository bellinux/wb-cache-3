If insects are not present, pugnose minnows {{can be found}} eating the eggs from other fish or small aquatic crustaceans like brine shrimp.|$|E
50|$|Opsopoeodus emiliae (common name <b>pugnose</b> <b>minnow)</b> is {{a species}} of cyprinid fish found in the eastern North America. There are two {{recognized}} subspecies with the subspecies from Florida recognized as race peninsularis.|$|E
5000|$|The <b>pugnose</b> <b>minnow</b> {{is a small}} silver {{fish with}} an average length of 1-2 inches with some {{reaching}} 2.5 inches in length; the minnow has a forked tail, short pectoral fins,and a small rounded snout. The distinctive characteristic is the lateral line running from the tail {{all the way to}} the mouth. The <b>pugnose</b> <b>minnow</b> has a greatly superior mouth, indicating that they feed above them in the water column. The dorsal fin has 9 dorsal spines and is translucent, as well as the caudal fin. The base of the caudal fin has a black spot that becomes pronounced in males when they are ready to mate; breeding males can also have tubercles that are used for fighting to show dominance and to be accepted by a female.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Pugnose</b> <b>minnows</b> {{reproduce}} in {{late spring}} to early summer under debris {{that can be found}} in their habitat, especially under rocks or logs. Males will clear out the area under the rock and defend it from other males by using the tubercles found on their snout. The female has to be led to the potential male's site and will investigate it as the male nudges her repeatedly with his dorsal fin to stimulate egg spawning. Female <b>pugnose</b> <b>minnows</b> lay adhesive eggs that will stick to the underside of the rock; the eggs will be laid either individually or in strings, with approximately 120 eggs per clutch. Males and females will repeat this process over the next 6 or 7 days. After all the eggs have been laid, the female has nothing else to do with the offspring; the males will guard the eggs until they hatch, which is around 6 days, depending on the weather.|$|R
5000|$|Bluntnose minnow (Pimephales notatus): The bluntnose minnow is {{a primary}} bait fish for Northern America (more {{specifically}} Ohio) and has a very high tolerance for variable water qualities, which helps its distribution throughout many regions. The snout of the bluntnose minnow overhangs the mouth, giving it the bluntnose. There is a dark lateral line which stretches from the opercle {{to the base of}} the tail, where a large black spot is located. The average size of the adult is approximately 5 cm (2 in). 'PimephalesCommon shiner (Notropis cornutus): These fish are one of the most common type of bait fish and are almost exclusively stream dwellers. The common shiner can be identified by the nine rays on its anal fin and terminal mouth. This minnow is typically bluish silver on the sides and greenish blue on the back., save for breeding season in which case the male gains a rose colored tail and anal fin. The shiner grows about 5-10 cm (2-4 in) within one year and reach a size of 13 cm (5 in) at adulthood. Another common [...] "shiner" [...] bait fish is the young version of the European chub (Leuciscus cephalus or Squalius cephaloides) which is quite easy to catch. Notropis potteri is known as the chub shiner.Common emerald shiner (Notropis atherinoides atherinoides): Common shiners are most abundant in the Great Lakes of North America, primarily Lake Erie. The name of the emerald shiner comes from the greenish emerald band that expands from the back of the gill cover to the tail. This type of minnow has a short, rounded snout, the only difference between the common emerald shiner and the silver shiner is that the silver shiner has a longer snout and a larger eye. These fish grow to an average length of about 6 cm. This is one of the most common bait fish used in the Lake Erie region of Ohio and many fisherman hold it over all other bait.* Cheat minnow, a species in the genus Pararhinichthys* Cutlips minnow, a species in the genus Exoglossum* Desert minnows, fishes in the genus Dionda* Eurasian minnows, fishes in the genus Phoxinus* Fathead minnow (rosy-red minnow), a species in the genus Pimephales* Loach minnow, a species of the genus Rhinichthys* Short levered minnow, a species of the genus Minnellinus* Pikeminnows, fishes in the genus Ptychocheilus* <b>Pugnose</b> <b>minnows,</b> fishes in the genus Opsopoeodus* Silverjaw minnow, a species in the genus Notropis* Longjaw minnow, a species in the genus Ericymba* Silvery minnows, fishes in the genus Hybognathus* Suckermouth minnows, fishes in the genus Phenacobius* Vietnamese cardinal minnow, a species in the genus Tanichthys* White Cloud Mountain minnow, a species in the genus Tanichthys ...|$|R

5000|$|The <b>pugnose</b> <b>minnow</b> is a {{freshwater}} fish that {{is native to}} Canada and the United States, mostly along the Eastern sides of these countries. It {{can be found in}} clear waters but also slow, turbid waters with plenty of debris to hide under. In the United States it is found in many different types of water, some stay in the clear water in which they were hatched but some may swim further from where they hatched to an environment with much more silt and clay.|$|E
5000|$|The {{pugnose shiner}} {{is a type}} of minnow that can live for up to 3 years and is able to reach sizes between 20-60mm, {{although}} it is about 47mm on average. It has a lateral dark stripe on the side of its body that runs from the tip of the caudal fin, through the eye, and to the nose tip. It has a small, terminal mouth angled upwards, giving it the pug-nose appearance. The abdominal region is yellow, and it has a clear-colored tail fin. Each fish has about 34-37 round, silver cycloid scales covering its body which has a [...] shape to help the pugose shiner swim against the constant stream currents. The pelvic fins are in the abdominal position. Because it is a ray-finned species, the fin rays are used as elements to support the skeletal features. The pugnose shiner has an 8-rayed dorsal fin on top of the dusky-colored back, a feature separating it from the <b>pugnose</b> <b>minnow.</b> This fish is also the only Minnesota Notropis species that has a darkly pigmented peritoneum.|$|E
