50|$|An {{engine is}} {{described}} as undersquare or long-stroke if its cylinders have a smaller bore (width, diameter) than its stroke (length of <b>piston</b> <b>travel)</b> - giving a ratio value of less than 1:1.|$|E
50|$|Increased stroke {{makes the}} <b>piston</b> <b>travel</b> further up and down. Since {{the amount of}} time allowed for this {{movement}} is not increased, the piston speed increases with a stroked crank (piston must move a further distance in the same amount of time). This can sometimes cause pistons to wear more quickly.|$|E
50|$|Opposed piston:Two-stroke engines, {{typically}} compression ignition/Diesel, with {{a single}} bank of cylinders driving two crankshafts where the <b>pistons</b> <b>travel</b> towards each other forming single combustion chambers, (e.g. Jumo 207).|$|R
50|$|Nitro engines for {{models can}} turn {{in excess of}} 50,000 RPM. Typical {{operating}} rpm for sport model aircraft engines is 10,000-14,000 rpm. For radio control (RC) boats and ducted fan aircraft engines, 20,000-25,000 is the usual range, and for cars rpm {{in the range of}} 25,000-37,000 is common. With this much movement, a lot of frictional heat is generated and the fuel used for these engines usually contains between 12-20% oil content depending on the nitromethane and methanol percentage, the engine type and application. Most engines in RC cars today are 2 stroke engines, which means that it takes 2 strokes of the piston (one revolution) to complete the engine cycle. On the first stroke as the <b>piston</b> <b>travels</b> upward, a mixture of fuel and air is sucked into the crankcase, from the carburetor. When the <b>piston</b> <b>travels</b> downward the new fuel air mixture travels into the induction port and finally into the combustion chamber. As the <b>piston</b> <b>travels</b> upward the mixture is compressed which causes the fuel/air mixture to ignite, producing hot gas under pressure to force the piston down. As the <b>piston</b> <b>travels</b> downward the spent exhaust gases escape out of the combustion chamber through the exhaust port, and the cycle starts over by the fuel mixture being again pushed into the induction port.|$|R
50|$|The {{stroke length}} is {{determined}} by the cranks on the crankshaft. Stroke can also refer to the distance the <b>piston</b> <b>travels.</b> Engine displacement is dependent on both the diameter of the cylinder, known as its bore, and the stroke of the Piston.|$|R
50|$|A {{piston rod}} is {{attached}} to the piston and links it to the crosshead, which is a large casting sliding in crosshead guides (UK: slidebar), allowing it only to move {{in the same direction as}} the <b>piston</b> <b>travel.</b> The crosshead also houses the gudgeon pin on which the small end of the connecting rod pivots. In this way, the transverse forces are applied only to the crosshead and its bearings, not to the piston itself.|$|E
50|$|In the Miller-cycle engine, {{the piston}} begins to {{compress}} the fuel-air mixture {{only after the}} intake valve closes; and the intake valve closes after the piston has traveled a certain distance above its bottom-most position: around 20 to 30% of the total <b>piston</b> <b>travel</b> of this upward stroke. So in the Miller cycle engine, the piston actually compresses the fuel-air mixture only during the latter 70% to 80% of the compression stroke. During the initial part of the compression stroke, the piston pushes part of the fuel-air mixture through the still-open intake valve, {{and back into the}} intake manifold.|$|E
50|$|The {{expansion}} stroke of the steam engine covers <b>piston</b> <b>travel</b> from {{top dead center}} to bottom dead center. When the piston reverses to return to top dead center, an exhaust valve needs to open so that the expanded steam from the previous stroke can be released from the cylinder. The WHE engine has an exhaust valve in each piston actuated by a protrusion on the connecting rod (see figure to right). On the exhaust stroke {{the angle of the}} connecting rod causes it to open the piston valve, allowing expanded steam to exhaust into the crankcase.|$|E
5000|$|As the <b>piston</b> <b>travels</b> {{upward in}} the cylinder, it creates low {{pressure}} area in the crankcase; this draws fresh air and atomized fuel from the carburetor {{through a hole in}} the cylinder wall or directly into the crankcase. As the <b>piston</b> continues <b>travelling</b> upward, transfer ports and the exhaust ports are closed off, thus trapping the combustible mixture in the combustion chamber. As the piston reaches the top of the cylinder, the mixture in the cylinder is compressed to the point of ignition.|$|R
50|$|A stroke is {{the action}} of a <b>piston</b> <b>travelling</b> {{the full length of}} its cylinder. In a {{two-stroke}} engine, one of the two strokes combines the intake stroke and the compression stroke, while the other stroke combines the combustion stroke and the exhaust stroke.|$|R
50|$|The Bore or {{cylinder}} bore {{is a part}} of a piston engine. The bore also represents the size, in terms of diameter, of the cylinder in which a <b>piston</b> <b>travels.</b> The value of a cylinders bore, and stroke, is used to establish the displacement of an engine.|$|R
50|$|The {{reciprocating}} sleeve valves were open-ended, {{rather than}} sealing in a junk head. The open end uncovered the exhaust ports {{high in the}} cylinder wall {{at the bottom of}} the sleeves' stroke, leaving the ports cut into the sleeve to handle the incoming charge only. The sleeves had a stroke of 30% of the <b>piston</b> <b>travel</b> at 1.950 in (49.5 mm) and operated 15 degrees in advance of the crankshaft.

5000|$|At {{the end of}} Mallards record run, {{the middle}} big end (part of the motion for the inside cylinder) {{was found to have}} run hot (indicated by the {{bursting}} of a heat-sensitive [...] "stink bomb" [...] placed in the bearing for warning purposes), the bearing metal having melted, which meant that the locomotive had to stop at Peterborough rather than continue on to London. Deficiencies in the alignment of the Gresley-Holcroft derived motion meant that the inside cylinder of the A4 did more work at high speed than the two outside cylinders - indeed on at least one occasion this led to the middle big end wearing {{to such an extent that}} the increased <b>piston</b> <b>travel</b> knocked the ends off the middle cylinder - and this overloading was mostly responsible for the failure.|$|E
5000|$|The Commer TS3 3-cylinder truck engines (originally {{designed}} by Tilling-Stevens) {{have a single}} crankshaft beneath {{the centre of the}} cylinders with both pistons connected by levers. This type of engine configuration dates at least back as far as 1914, as a 2-stroke petrol engine referred to as the [...] "Simpson's balanced two-stroke" [...] was described in the Motor Cycle magazine of this date. This design used crankcase compression, and used one piston to uncover the transfer port, and another to open the exhaust port allowing the fresh charge to flow {{from one end of the}} cylinder to the other, thereby avoiding the need for deflector crowns for pistons used in most 2-strokes at that time. The levers operating the pistons allowed for a large <b>piston</b> <b>travel</b> with smaller crank throw.|$|E
50|$|A cylinder's displacement, or swept volume, can be {{calculated}} by multiplying its cross-sectional area (the square of half the bore by pi) by the distance the <b>piston</b> <b>travels</b> within the cylinder (the stroke). The engine displacement can {{be calculated}} by multiplying the swept volume of one cylinder {{by the number of}} cylinders.|$|R
50|$|At a given engine speed, {{a longer}} stroke {{increases}} engine friction (since the <b>piston</b> <b>travels</b> a greater distance per stroke) and increases {{stress on the}} crankshaft due to the higher peak piston acceleration. The smaller bore also reduces the area available for valves in the cylinder head, requiring them to be smaller or fewer in number. Because these factors favor lower engine speeds, undersquare engines are most often tuned to develop peak torque at relatively low speeds.|$|R
5000|$|A {{cylinder}} is {{the central}} working part of a reciprocating engine or pump, the space in which a <b>piston</b> <b>travels.</b> Multiple cylinders are commonly arranged {{side by side in}} a bank, or engine block, which is typically cast from aluminum or cast iron before receiving precision machine work. Cylinders may be sleeved (lined with a harder metal) or sleeveless (with a wear-resistant coating such as Nikasil). A sleeveless engine may also be referred to as a [...] "parent-bore engine".|$|R
50|$|Torsion bar {{suspensions}} {{are used}} on combat vehicles and tanks like the T-72, Leopard 1, Leopard 2, M26 Pershing, M18 Hellcat, and the M1 Abrams (many tanks from World War II used this suspension), and on modern trucks and SUVs from Ford, Chrysler, GM, Mitsubishi, Mazda, Nissan, Isuzu and Toyota. Manufacturers change the torsion bar or key {{to adjust the}} ride height, usually to compensate for engine weight. While the ride height may be adjusted by turning the adjuster bolts on the stock torsion key, rotating the stock key too far can bend the adjusting bolt and place the shock piston outside its standard travel. Over-rotating the torsion bars can also cause the suspension to hit the bump-stop prematurely, causing a harsh ride. Aftermarket forged-metal torsion key kits use relocked adjuster keys to prevent over-rotation, and shock brackets to keep the <b>piston</b> <b>travel</b> in the stock range.|$|E
5000|$|First, {{and most}} important, the crankshaft's rod {{journals}} are physically {{farther from the}} main journals than on the original equipment. A given extension in {{the distance between the}} rod and main journals results in twice that distance in increase of <b>piston</b> <b>travel.</b> For example, in a Chrysler LA (1971-1992) 360 cubic inch (5.9 l) V8, the rod journal centerline is 1.79 in (4.55 cm) from the main journal centerline. The piston travels 3.58 in (9.1 cm) in this configuration. When this engine is modified with a 402 cubic inch (6.6 l) stroker kit, the distance between the main journal centerline and the rod journal centerline is increased to 2.00 in (5.08 cm), which results in the piston travelling 4.00 in (10.16 cm). So, the modified crankshaft with 0.21 in (0.53 cm) further distance between the main and rod journals results in 42 cubic inches (.7 [...] ) of displacement greater than the engine had before.|$|E
5000|$|Longevity, as {{demonstrated}} in early automotive applications of the Knight engine. Prior to the advent of leaded gasolines, poppet-valve engines typically required grinding of the valves and valve seats after 20,000 to 30,000 miles (32,000 to 48,000 km) of service. Sleeve valves did not suffer from the wear and recession caused by the repetitive impact of the poppet valve against its seat. Sleeve valves were also subjected to less intense heat build-up than poppet valves, owing to their greater area of contact with other metal surfaces. In the Knight engine, carbon build-up actually helped to improve the sealing of the sleeves, the engines being said to [...] "improve with use", in contrast to poppet valve engines, which lose compression and power as valves, valve stems and guides wear. Due to the continuous motion of the sleeve (Burt-McCollum type), the high wear points linked to poor lubrication in the TDC/BDC (bottom dead centre) of <b>piston</b> <b>travel</b> within the cylinder are suppressed, so rings and cylinders lasted much longer.|$|E
50|$|Power Tower is {{a thrill}} ride located at two Cedar Fair {{parks in the}} U.S.A, Cedar Point and Valleyfair. The attractions are powered by air in large {{cylinders}} in which an aircraft steel cable, connected to the internal <b>piston,</b> <b>travels</b> and is also connected to the external rider car. Hydraulic cylinders {{at the base of}} the tower provide an extra measure of safety in case of a ride malfunction. Both rides were designed and manufactured by S&S Worldwide of Logan, Utah.|$|R
5000|$|A {{large number}} of small {{two-stroke}} engines use a sealed crankcase as a compression chamber for their mixture. These are hugely common as petrol or gasoline small engines for motorcycles, generator sets and garden equipment. Both sides of the piston are used as working surfaces: the upper side is the power piston, the lower side acts as a scavenging pump. As the piston rises, it pushes out exhaust gases and produces a partial vacuum in the crankcase, which draws in fuel and air. As the <b>piston</b> <b>travels</b> downward, the compressed fuel/air charge is pushed from the crankcase into the cylinder.|$|R
50|$|Unlike later {{mechanical}} shutters {{such as the}} Compur {{which use}} a clockwork mechanism, shutter timing is achieved by releasing air from a small cylinder typically mounted horizontally {{at the top of}} the shutter through a small aperture. A cam turned by the shutter speed dial positions a piston in the cylinder to provide the correct exposure. When the shutter release is pressed the shutter opens and air in the cylinder is gradually released, letting the piston move; it closes the shutter when it reaches the end of its <b>travel.</b> The <b>piston</b> <b>travels</b> for a very short distance at the higher speeds, making their accuracy very sensitive to the precise manufacturing of the cam; lower speeds are more reliably accurate.|$|R
50|$|The 2GR-FSE is a 3.5L engine {{used in the}} Lexus IS, GS 350, Mark X and Crown and {{incorporates}} Toyota's latest D-4S twin injection fuel system. This system combines {{direct injection}} (949cc/min injectors) with traditional port injection (298cc/min injectors). Direct injection lowers the tendency to knock (detonation) and increases performance by reducing the charge intake temperature. Traditionally, direct injection engines require an in-engine mechanism such as swirl ports or specific piston crown shapes to increase air turbulence in the engine. These are in place to help achieve a homogeneous air-fuel mixture inside the cylinder at low RPM and high load, but these mechanisms inhibit performance at higher engine speeds. In the 2GR-FSE, port injection is used considerably to achieve the correct mixture without having in-engine restrictions, meaning the engine achieves specific power {{near the top of}} all naturally aspirated production gasoline engines in the world (67 kW/L, 235 kW in the Mark X). Toyota also developed a new type of injector for this engine. The dual fan spray pattern of the direct injectors is perpendicular to the <b>piston</b> <b>travel</b> with wide dispersion in the cylinder, which aids air and fuel mixture and therefore increases power and efficiency. The port injectors not only help improve the power and efficiency but they also help improve emissions, especially in the first 20 seconds after start-up (when the catalytic converter is in its warm-up stage). Compression ratio is 11.8:1.|$|E
50|$|Sometimes {{referred}} to as electromagnetic viscometer or EMV viscometer, was invented at Cambridge Viscosity (Formally Cambridge Applied Systems) in 1986. The sensor (see figure below) comprises a measurement chamber and magnetically influenced piston. Measurements are taken whereby a sample is first introduced into the thermally controlled measurement chamber where the piston resides. Electronics drive the piston into oscillatory motion within the measurement chamber with a controlled magnetic field. A shear stress is imposed on the liquid (or gas) due to the <b>piston</b> <b>travel</b> and the viscosity is determined by measuring the travel time of the piston. The construction parameters for the annular spacing between the piston and measurement chamber, {{the strength of the}} electromagnetic field, and the travel distance of the piston are used to calculate the viscosity according to Newton’s Law of Viscosity.The oscillating piston viscometer technology has been adapted for small sample viscosity and micro-sample viscosity testing in laboratory applications. It has also been adapted to measure high pressure viscosity and high temperature viscosity measurements in both laboratory and process environments. The viscosity sensors have been scaled {{for a wide range of}} industrial applications such as small size viscometers for use in compressors and engines, flow-through viscometers for dip coating processes, in-line viscometers for use in refineries, and hundreds of other applications. Improvements in sensitivity from modern electronics, is stimulating a growth in oscillating piston viscometer popularity with academic laboratories exploring gas viscosity.|$|E
5000|$|A {{reservoir}} above each {{master cylinder}} supplies the master cylinder with enough brake fluid to avoid air {{from entering the}} master cylinder (even the typical clutch uses brake fluid, {{but it may also}} be referred to as [...] "clutch fluid" [...] in a clutch applr). Each piston in a master cylinder operates a brake circuit, and for modern light trucks and passenger cars, usually a brake circuit leads to a brake caliper or shoe on only two of the vehicle's wheels, and the other brake circuit provides brake-pressure to slow down and stop the other two wheels. This is done in a diagonally split hydraulic system. If there is a hydraulic failure in the brake lines served by the master cylinder's secondary piston both pistons will move forward when the brakes are applied, but there is nothing to resist <b>piston</b> <b>travel</b> except the secondary piston spring. This lets the primary piston build up only a small amount of pressure until the secondary piston bottoms in the cylinder bore. Then the primary piston will build enough hydraulic pressure to operate the brakes served by this half of the system. In case of a hydraulic failure in the brake system served by the primary piston, the primary piston will move forward when the brakes are applied but will not build up hydraulic pressure. In this case very little force is transferred to the secondary piston through the primary piston spring until the piston extension screw comes in contact with the secondary piston. Then, pushrod force is transmitted directly to the secondary piston and enough pressure is built up to operate its brakes. Usually the 2 systems are split into left front and right rear comprising one system and right front and left rear comprising the other system. For safety, this is done so that usually only two wheels lose their braking ability {{at the same time and}} that both sides of the car have at least one braking system working and both ends of the car have at least one system working. With only 1 system working there is longer stopping distances and repairs should be done before driving again.|$|E
25|$|Formula One cars use {{short stroke}} engines. These engines {{are common in}} racing {{motorcycles}} and streetbikes. The bore is {{the diameter of the}} cylinder in the engine block, and the stroke is the distance the <b>piston</b> <b>travels</b> from top dead-centre (TDC) to bottom dead-centre (BDC) inside the cylinder. To operate at high engine speeds the stroke must be relatively short to prevent catastrophic failure; this is usually connecting rod failure as the rod is under very large stresses at these speeds. Having a short stroke means that a relatively large bore is required to make the 1.6 litre engine displacement. This results in a less efficient combustion stroke, especially at lower rpm. The stroke of a Formula One engine is approximately , less than half the bore diameter , what is known as an over-square configuration.|$|R
50|$|In {{the case}} of the {{normally}} aspirated engine, {{at the start of the}} compression stroke the cylinder air / fuel volume is very high, this translates into a low starting pressure. As the <b>piston</b> <b>travels</b> upward, abnormally high cylinder pressures may result in the mixture auto-igniting or detonating, which is why conservative compression ratios are used in consumer vehicles. In a forced induction engine where at the start of the compression stroke the cylinder pressure is already raised (having a greater volume of air/fuel) Exp. 202kPa (29.4Psi) the starting pressure or air / fuel volume would be 2 times that of the normally aspirated engine. This would translate into an effective compression ratio of 20:1 vs. 10:1 for the normally aspirated. This is why many forced induction engines have compression ratios in the 8:1 range.|$|R
25|$|Consider {{that the}} driver has {{adjusted}} the reversing lever such that the die block is at mid-gear. In this position the secondary motion is eliminated and the <b>piston</b> valve <b>travel</b> is shortest, giving minimal injection and exhaust of steam. The <b>travel</b> of the <b>piston</b> valve is twice the total of lap plus lead.|$|R
