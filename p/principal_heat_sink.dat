40|$|The Antarctic region {{comprises}} {{the continent and}} surrounding sea south of the Antarctic Convergence, where cold Antarctic upper water sinks and mixes with warmer sub-Antarctic water. The continent, nearly centered on the South Geographic Pole, is isolated by the Southern Ocean from other land masses. The continent's mean elevation is about 2, 000 m and 98 % of the surface is mantled by 2, 000 m or more of glacial ice which flows toward coastal outlets to the sea. The ice sheet is pierced by mountain summits, some approaching altitudes near 5, 000 m. The continental shelf mean width is 30 km. On its seaward edge the shelf is at depths of 400 to over 600 m. The total area of ice and snow surface presented by the region is doubled by the maximum extent of sea ice each year. The Antarctic Continent is the <b>principal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> of the world weather machine. Upwelling areas of the Southern Ocean recycle nutrients and stimulate the marine ecosystem, and seasonal changes in extent of sea ice contribute {{to one of the}} greatest annual pulses in marine organic production. The fish fauna has only 120 species but these belong to 29 families. The zooplankton is rich in several endemic crustacea, notably the Antarctic krill. The only vertebrates on land come from the sea onto shore areas and fast ice, including colonies of breeding penguins and associated birds as well as seals. Closed communities of vascular plants and cryptogams occur on sub-Antarctic islands and the Antarctic Peninsula, but in the entire continental Antarctic the vegetation is desert-like, composed of scattered mosses, lichens, and terrestrial algae. Exposed surfaces of crystalline rocks harbor "endolithic microbial life," and a few species of invertebrates dwell on favorably exposed soil and under rocks. The ice Plateau is as nearly abiotic or sterile as any area on the earth's surface. The physical and biotic features of Antarctica represent extreme conditions. The continent was untouched by man until the past two centuries and remains nearly pristine. It yields key information about cold environments and global environmental systems including evidences of change, and deserves protection from unnecessary disturbance...|$|E
40|$|Power {{generation}} and water consumption are inextricably linked. Because {{of this relationship}} DOE/NETL has funded a competitive research and development initiative to address this relationship. This report {{is part of that}} initiative and is in response to DOE/NETL solicitation DE-PS 26 - 03 NT 41719 - 0. Thermal electric power generation requires large volumes of water to cool spent steam {{at the end of the}} turbine cycle. The required volumes are such that new plant siting is increasingly dependent on the availability of cooling circuit water. Even in the eastern U. S., large rivers such as the Monongahela may no longer be able to support additional, large power stations due to subscription of flow to existing plants, industrial, municipal and navigational requirements. Earlier studies conducted by West Virginia University (WV 132, WV 173 phase I, WV 173 Phase II, WV 173 Phase III, and WV 173 Phase IV in review) have identified that a large potential water resource resides in flooded, abandoned coal mines in the Pittsburgh Coal Basin, and likely elsewhere in the region and nation. This study evaluates the technical and economic potential of the Pittsburgh Coal Basin water source to supply new power plants with cooling water. Two approaches for supplying new power plants were evaluated. Type A employs mine water in conventional, evaporative cooling towers. Type B utilizes earth-coupled cooling with flooded underground mines as the <b>principal</b> <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> for the power plant reject heat load. Existing mine discharges in the Pittsburgh Coal Basin were evaluated for flow and water quality. Based on this analysis, eight sites were identified where mine water could supply cooling water to a power plant. Three of these sites were employed for pre-engineering design and cost analysis of a Type A water supply system, including mine water collection, treatment, and delivery. This method was also applied to a ''base case'' river-source power plant, for comparison. Mine-water system cost estimates were then compared to the base-case river source estimate. We found that the use of net-alkaline mine water would under current economic conditions be competitive with a river-source in a comparable-size water cooling system. On the other hand, utilization of net acidic water would be higher in operating cost than the river system by 12 percent. This does not account for any environmental benefits that would accrue due to the treatment of acid mine drainage, in many locations an existing public liability. We also found it likely that widespread adoption of mine-water utilization for power plant cooling will require resolution of potential liability and mine-water ownership issues. In summary, Type A mine-water utilization for power plant cooling is considered a strong option for meeting water needs of new plant in selected areas. Analysis of the thermal and water handling requirements for a 600 megawatt power plant indicated that Type B earth coupled cooling would not be feasible for a power plant of this size. It was determined that Type B cooling would be possible, under the right conditions, for power plants of 200 megawatts or less. Based on this finding the feasibility of a 200 megawatt facility was evaluated. A series of mines were identified where a Type B earth-coupled 200 megawatt power plant cooling system might be feasible. Two water handling scenarios were designed to distribute heated power-plant water throughout the mines. Costs were developed for two different pumping scenarios employing a once-through power-plant cooling circuit. Thermal and groundwater flow simulation models were used to simulate the effect of hot water injection into the mine under both pumping strategies and to calculate the return-water temperature over the design life of a plant. Based on these models, staged increases in required mine-water pumping rates are projected to be part of the design, due to gradual heating and loss of heat-sink efficiency of the rock sequence above the mines. Utilizing pumping strategy No. 1 (two mines) capital costs were 25 percent lower and operating cost 19 percent higher than a conventional river-water cooling water scheme. Utilizing pumping strategy No. 2 (three mines), capital costs were 20 percent lower and operating costs 192 percent higher. Major capital cost advantages are obtained by using earth-coupled cooling, due in large part to elimination of need for cooling towers. In addition, the lack of cooling towers and of thermal-pollution considerations may be positive factors in power plant permitting. However, application of Type B earth-coupled cooling will be technically feasible limited at a much smaller number of sites than Type A systems due to requirements involving mine size, geometry, and hydraulic conditions. Innovations such as directional drilling may be required to create mine interconnections across barriers where none presently exist...|$|E

As a result, the swaged- and extruded-type <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> released 71 % and 64 % of the heat incoming to the <b>heat</b> <b>sink,</b> respectively. The other incoming heat were naturally convected and radiated to the ambient. In spite of 40 % decrease in number of fins, the heat release performance of the extruded-type <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> was lowered only 7 % than that of the swaged-type. We believe that, this shows the increment of effective heat transfer area by the laterally waved surface of fins and the better heat transfer property of the extruded-type <b>heat</b> <b>sink...</b>|$|R

Thermal performances of optimized plate-fin and pin-fin <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> with vertical base plate were compared in natural convection. Comparison is performed under the same base plate dimensions and fin height condition. A Nusselt number correlation for plate-fin array was adopted to optimize plate-fin <b>heat</b> <b>sinks.</b> For pin-fin <b>heat</b> <b>sinks,</b> a new correlation of heat transfer coefficient was developed. With the new correlation, diameter, horizontal spacing, and vertical spacing of pin-fin array are optimized. Optimized plate-fin and pin-fin <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> are compared analytically. They were compared for various base plate dimensions, fin heights, temperature differences. In most regions, plate-fin <b>heat</b> <b>sinks</b> show better performance than pin-fin <b>heat</b> <b>sinks.</b> dc 201...|$|R

A new simulation model for the Intel P 4 CPU <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> is proposed and analyzed. A resonant frequency of 2. 6 GHz with a reflection coefficient of 8. 3 dB was found for the CPU <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> This is close to the IEEE and Bluetooth wireless communication system's operating frequency of 2. 4 GHz. An optimal design of the CPU <b>heat</b> <b>sink</b> design should be performed in order to minimize the radiated emission from the CPU <b>heat</b> <b>sink.</b> Griffith Sciences, Griffith School of EngineeringFull Tex...|$|R
