40|$|<b>Patents</b> <b>fuel</b> {{innovation}} and are becoming an ever-more important form of protection in this technological age. Society {{also has a}} vested interest in only valid patents being issued and enforced. Patents are presumed valid once they are issued and also currently enjoy the application of a heavy burden of proof—clear and convincing evidence—to overcome that presumption when their validity is questioned at trial. This burden has started to be questioned as the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office becomes more taxed by the increasing influx of patent applications. Current precedent conflicts with past precedent and with general principles of administrative law. This Note argues that the application of a clear and convincing burden of proof should be revisited and ultimately lowered to a preponderance of the evidence standard in order to only enforce valid patents...|$|R

The ship escaped the German invasion of Norway on 9 April 1940, having arrived in Methil on 3 April, and continued in service {{in and around the}} United Kingdom. On the morning of 27 January 1942, the ship was en route from Newport to Fowey with a cargo of <b>patent</b> <b>fuel,</b> and had joined a convoy. However, due to bad weather the ship lost its convoy in the evening the same day, and in the afternoon the next day it was suddenly attacked and sunk by German aircraft outside of Falmouth, England. The ship being hit by five bombs, she sank in half a minute. Most of its crew perished, including Esbensen. His date of death was given as 29 February. Only the first mate, a stoker and a gunner survived.|$|R

500|$|Goods carried {{were mainly}} coal and culm, but also {{included}} timber, iron ore, sand, slag and copper ore, with smaller amounts of foodstuffs and general merchandise. Establishment of industries at Port Tennant, which included Charles Lambert's copper{{works in the}} 1850s and a <b>patent</b> <b>fuel</b> works in the 1860s, resulted in increased traffic of coal, from both Glan-y-wern and Tir-isaf collieries. Tir-isaf was served by a [...] branch built in 1863 by the Earl of Jersey, but leased to the Tennants. Traffic figures reached 225,304 tons in 1866, and then gradually declined after that, but this provided a steady revenue until 1895. The river lock at Red Jacket had a chequered history. Once the line to Aberdulais basin had been opened, it was barely used, and Tennant thought about removing it in 1832. However, {{it was back in}} use some time later, and was unused again in the 1880s, only to be rebuilt in 1898.|$|R
50|$|Ethyl has {{established}} {{the marketing of}} the <b>patented</b> <b>fuel</b> in vast amounts on a nationwide scale through the 11,000 jobbers and, at the same time, by the leverage of its licensing contracts resting on the fulcrum of its patents, it has built up a combination capable of use, and actually used, {{as a means of}} controlling jobbers' prices and suppressing competition among them. It seems plain that this attempted regulation of prices and market practices of the jobbers with respect to the fuel purchased, for which Ethyl could not lawfully contract, cannot be lawfully achieved by entering into contracts or combinations through the manipulation of which the same results are reached by the exercise of the power which they give to control the action of the purchasers. Such contracts or combinations, which are used to obstruct the free and natural flow in the channels of interstate commerce of trade even in a patented article, after it is sold by the patentee or his licensee, are a violation of the Sherman Act.|$|R

50|$|Ynysmeudwy Upper and Lower Locks {{are below}} the bridge. By 1878, the lower lock was crossed by a railway {{connecting}} the Cwm-nant-du Collieries to a <b>Patent</b> <b>Fuel</b> Works, by the lock, and continuing {{over the river}} to join the railway line. The collieries were disused by 1898, and only a short section of the railway line remained, as the link over the lock and river had been removed. Next came a branch from the main line of the canal {{to the side of}} the river, with a dock at the end. A tramway connected the dock to the Waun-y-coed Colliery on the south bank of the river, and there were tramway connections to the Cwm-nant-llwyd Colliery to the south and another to the north-east. The branch is clearly visible from the bridge where the A road crosses, but there are no structures visible any longer of the dock itself and it is difficult to walk to this section due to the growth of brambles etc. The canal is navigable from Ynysmeudwy Lower Lock to Pontardawe, where further progress is blocked by Ynysgylennen Bridge, which has been lowered. The canal continues a little further, passing under Herbert Street Bridge and over Upper Clydach Aqueduct, before disappearing into a culvert.|$|R

40|$|The {{development}} of an energy device with abundant energy generation, ultra-high specific power density, high stability and long life is critical for enabling longer missions and for reducing mission costs. Of all different types of fuel cells, the solid oxide fuel cells (SOFC) is a promising high temperature device that can generate electricity as a byproduct of a chemical reaction in a clean way and produce high quality heat {{that can be used}} for other purposes. For aerospace applications, a power-to-weight of (is) greater than 1. 0 kW/kg is required. NASA has a <b>patented</b> <b>fuel</b> cell technology under development, capable of achieving the 1. 0 kW/kg figure of merit. The first step toward achieving these goals is increasing anode durability. The catalyst plays an important role in the fuel cells for power generation, stability, efficiency and long life. Not only the anode composition, but its preparation and reduction are key to achieving better cell performance. In this research, multi-layer anodes were prepared varying the chemistry of each layer to optimize the performance of the cells. Microstructure analyses were done to the new anodes before and after fuel cell operation. The cells' durability and performance were evaluated in 200 hrs life tests in hydrogen at 850 C. The chemistry of the standard nickel anode was modified successfully reducing the anode degradation from 40 % to 8. 4 % in 1000 hrs and retaining its microstructure...|$|R

40|$|This paper studies {{innovation}} {{dynamics in}} efficiency improving electricity generation technologies {{as an important}} means of mitigating climate change impacts. Relevant patents are identified and used {{as an indicator of}} innovation. We find that patenting in efficiency improving technologies has mostly been stable over time, with a recent decreasing trend. We also find that majority of patents are first filed in OECD countries and only then in non-OECD or BRIC countries. Conversely, non-OECD and BRIC countries apply for patents that are mostly marketed domestically. This result shows that there is significant technology transfer in the field of efficiency improving technologies for electricity production. This flow of know-how is likely to contribute to mitigation of greenhouse gases emissions in emerging economies in the long run.
