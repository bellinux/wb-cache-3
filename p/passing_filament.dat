50|$|Before Einthoven's time, it {{was known}} that the beating of the heart {{produced}} electrical currents, but the instruments of the time could not accurately measure this phenomenon without placing electrodes directly on the heart. Beginning in 1901, Einthoven completed a series of prototypes of a string galvanometer. This device used a very thin filament of conductive wire passing between very strong magnets. When a current <b>passed</b> through the <b>filament,</b> the magnetic field created by the current would cause the string to move. A light shining on the string would cast a shadow on a moving roll of photographic paper, thus forming a continuous curve showing {{the movement of the}} string. The original machine required water cooling for the powerful electromagnets, required 5 people to operate it and weighed some 270 kilograms. This device increased the sensitivity of the standard galvanometer so that the electrical activity of the heart could be measured despite the insulation of flesh and bones.|$|R
40|$|We {{search for}} highly–ionized gas near three AGN host galaxies using the Chandra low–energy {{transmission}} grating spectrograph. Strong absorption lines from such gas are seen at z = 0, most likely {{from one or}} more of the following components: (1) a Galactic corona, (2) the Local Group medium, and (3) an extended warm–hot intergalactic medium (WHIM) <b>filament</b> <b>passing</b> through our local overdensity. Since AGNs reside within host galaxies that are also expected to sit within cosmically overdense regions, similar absorption resulting from these three components should appear at the AGN redshifts as well. However, no such absorption is seen. The lack of strong absorption lines is likely a result of the gas in these host galaxies and surrounding galaxy clusters being much hotter, and hence more highly ionized, than the gas in the Local Group+Galaxy system.

40|$|By {{electron}} microscopy, the ultrastructure of the M {{line was}} investigated in fibers from frog nonglycerinated semitendinosus muscles at body length and at different degrees of shortening and stretch. The M line appeared as a line of high electron opacity {{in the middle of}} the A band.

In the shortened fiber the M line remained distinct. At high degrees of stretch, the M line became fainter or indiscernible.

40|$|Balloon-borne {{frost point}} {{hygrometers}} measured three high-resolution profiles of stratospheric water vapour above Ny-Ålesund, Spitsbergen during winter 2002 / 2003. The profiles obtained on 12 December 2002 and on 17 January 2003 provide {{an insight into}} the vertical distribution of water vapour {{in the core of}} the polar vortex. The water vapour sounding on 11 February 2003 was obtained within the vortex edge region of the lower stratosphere. Here, a significant reduction of water vapour mixing ratio was observed between 16 and 19 km. The stratospheric temperatures indicate that this dehydration was not caused by the presence of polar stratospheric clouds or earlier PSC particle sedimentation. Ozone observations on this day indicate a large scale movement of the polar vortex and show laminae in the same altitude range as the water vapour profile. The link between the observed water vapour reduction and filaments in the vortex edge region is indicated in the results of the semi-lagrangian advection model MIMOSA, which show that adjacent filaments of polar and mid latitude air can be identified above the Spitsbergen region. A vertical cross-section produced by the MIMOSA model reveals that the water vapour sonde flew through polar air in the lowest part of the stratosphere below 425 K, then <b>passed</b> through <b>filaments</b> of mid latitude air with lower water vapour concentrations, before it finally entered the polar vortex above 450 K. These results indicate that on 11 February 2003 the frost point hygrometer measured different water vapour concentrations as the sonde detected air with different origins.

50|$|The typical hunting mode {{for most}} sheet-building Agelenidae {{is similar to}} that of most other {{families}} of spiders that build sheet webs in the open, typically on grass or in scrubland as opposed to under bark, rocks, and the like. They await the arrival of prey such as grasshoppers that fall onto the horizontal web. Although the web is not sticky, it is full of entangling filaments that the spider continually lays down when <b>passing</b> over. The <b>filaments</b> catch in the least projections on a prey insect's body or limbs. The web also is springy, and whether perching on the sheet or awaiting prey in its retreat, the spider reacts immediately to vibrations, whether from a courting male, the threatening struggles of dangerous invaders, or the weaker struggles of potential meals. They attack promising prey by rushing out at high speed and dealing a paralysing venomous bite. Once the prey has been disabled, the spider generally drags it back into the retreat and begins to feed. This method of attack is consistent with the high speeds at which Agelenidae run. Other sheet web hunters such as some Pisauridae also are very fast runners.|$|R

The aims of our research are to find the dependence of the cable resistance on the design parameters.

40|$|An {{electron}} microscopical {{study of}} the epidermal-dermal junction in the axolotl and adult Rana pipiens has been carried out. This shows that filaments of about 12 nm in diameter, known as anchoring <b>filaments,</b> <b>pass</b> from the hemidesmosomes {{at the base of}} the epidermal cells across the basal lamina to the dermis. There they may unite to form broader fibres, known as anchoring fibrils, or may simply form bundles. In the axolotl, particularly, the anchoring fibrils or bundles of anchoring filaments, enmesh with the collagen fibres of the dermis. Removal of epidermal cells with EDTA results in separation along a plane in the lamina rara of the basal lamina, i. e. between the plasma membrane of the cells and the lamina densa. The anchor-ing filaments remain inserted into the lamina densa. Hemidesmosomal plaques are no longer visible in regions of the plasma membrane that have been separated from the basal lamina by EDTA, and no evidence was found that plaques are engulfed by the cells. It is proposed that the hemidesmosome-anchoring filament system provides a structural link between the collagenous filament system of the dermis and the intracellular cytokeratin filament system of the epidermis, which, in turn, is linked between cells by desmosomes...|$|R
40|$|An {{infection}} of pearl oysters, Pinctada maxima, {{attributed to a}} Haplosporidium sp. by Hine and Thorne (1998) has been detected on 3 occasions and is considered to represent a serious concern to the pearling industry in Australia. The spore ornamentation of the parasite was determined by scanning electron microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Spores of the parasite were pleomorphic, or elongated 3. 5 - 4 mcm x 2. 5 - 3. 0 mcm in size. Two filaments were wound around the spore and originated from 2 'knob-like' posterior thickenings.

40|$|The {{interaction}} of Bacterionema matruchotii with strains of Streptococcus sanguis produces a structure which morphologically resembles a corncob. To determine the specific bacterial surface receptors {{involved in the}} interaction, we developed a quantitative assay. The assay consisted of mixing saline suspensions of [CH 3 - 3 H]thymidine-labeled streptococci and B. matruchotii, incubating at 37 °C for 2 h, and filtering the mixture through a 5 -μm polycarbonate membrane filter. The free cocci and <b>filaments</b> <b>passed</b> through the filter, but the corncobs were retained. Estimates {{of the number of}} corncobs formed were obtained by quantitating the radioactivity retained on the membranes relative to that of controls of streptococci alone. Although saturation of the Bacterionema occurred at a ratio of streptococci to Bacterionema of 10 : 1 (Klett units), a 2 : 1 ratio was chosen because of the increased sensitivity of the assay at this ratio. The percentage of streptococci binding at this ratio was 18. 6 ± 8. 1 (standard deviation). All five Bacterionema strains tested formed corncobs; in contrast, only three strains of S. sanguis were positive. These were serotype 1 strains which had localized surface “fuzz. ” Although scanning electron microscopic observations revealed an almost random distribution of cocci along the filament surface, transmission electron microscopy revealed that the streptococci were attached to the Bacterionema by the surface fuzz. No differences in corncob formation were observed in sodium phosphate buffer, pH 6 to 8, at phosphate concentrations ranging from 0. 005 to 0. 05 M. Concentrations of NaCl or KCl up to 0. 25 M did not affect corncob formation, and low concentrations of CaCl 2 increased corncob formation slightly, whereas MgCl 2, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, and citrate buffers reduced the number of streptococci binding to the filaments.

The debate having been managed a good while, by variety of arguments on both sides, I (who {{had been used to}} suspect, that the greatest part of disputes were more about the signification of words than a real difference in the conception of things) desired, that, before they went any further on in this dispute, they would first examine and establish amongst them, what the word LIQUOR signified.

However, they were pleased to comply with my motion; and upon examination found that the signification of that word was not so settled or certain as they had all imagined; but that each of them made it a sign of a different complex idea. This made them perceive that the main of their dispute was about the signification of that term; and that they differed very little in their opinions concerning SOME fluid and subtle matter, passing through the conduits of the nerves; though it was not so easy to agree whether it was to be called LIQUOR or no, a thing, which, when considered, they thought it not worth the contending about.|$|R
40|$|On 21 January 2005, one of {{the fastest}} interplanetary coronal mass ejections (ICME) of solar cycle 23, {{containing}} exceptionally dense plasma directly behind the sheath, hit the magnetosphere. We show from charge‐state analysis that this material was a piece of the erupting solar filament and further, based on comparisons to the simulation of a fast CME, that the unusual location of the filament material was a consequence of three processes. As the ICME decelerated, the momentum of the dense filament material caused it to push through the flux rope toward the nose. Diverging nonradial flows in front of the filament moved magnetic flux to the sides of the ICME. At the same time, reconnection between {{the leading edge of the}} ICME and the sheath magnetic fields worked to peel away the outer layers of the flux rope creating a remnant flux rope and a trailing region of newly opened magnetic field lines. These processes combined to move the filament material into direct contact with the ICME sheath region. Within 1 h after impact and under northward interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) conditions, a cold dense plasma sheet formed within the magnetosphere from the filament material. Dense plasma sheet material continued to move through the magnetosphere for more than 6 h as the <b>filament</b> <b>passed</b> by the Earth. Densities were high enough to produce strong diamagnetic stretching of the magnetotail despite the northward IMF conditions and low levels of magnetic activity. The disruptions from the filament collision are linked to an array of unusual features throughout the magnetosphere, ionosphere, and atmosphere. These results raise questions about whether rare collisions with solar filaments may, under the right conditions, be a factor in producing even more extreme events.

40|$|Females of Mermis nigrescens, a {{nematode}} parasitic on grasshoppers, climb through terrestrial vegetation {{where they}} lay their eggs. The 100 -mm-long body of these nematodes bridges gaps in this three-dimensional substratum, and crawls efficiently over planar surfaces. The nematodes {{do not use}} the classical undulant pattern of nematode locomotion as one coordinated unit; instead they propel themselves in several independent, locally controlled zones that propagate posteriorly. A repeated motion of their anterior end laces the body around fixed objects at which force may be applied. Propulsive {{force is applied to}} objects as the body glides past the contact site. Intermediate loops are elevated above the surface where they cannot contribute to propulsion. These loops rise and fall with time due to varying differences in propulsive forces between the contact sites. Forces are applied to the objects by internally generated bending couples that are propagated along the trunk, propelling the body in a cam-follower mechanism. Bending couples are generated by the contraction of ventral or dorsal longitudinal muscle bands that apply compressive force to the cuticle. The muscle bands, consisting of a single layer of obliquely striated muscle cells, are closely applied to the cuticle and are separated from it only by a fibrous basal lamina and a thin extension of a hypodermal cell. The myofilaments of each sarcomere are parallel to the body axis and attached perpendicularly via dense bodies (z-line equivalents) to the basal lamina, which in turn is fixed to the cuticle via <b>filaments</b> <b>passing</b> through the hypodermal cytoplasm, Consequently, forces are transmitted laterally to the cuticle over {{the entire length of the}} muscle, compressing it parallel to the surface without need for attachment to the terminal ends of the muscle cells. Thus the muscles are engineered for local control of bending and avoidance of buckling. There is evidence that the motor nervous system of Mermis may not be as simple as in classical nematode examples, which may explain why Mermis is capable of a much more localized control of locomotory motion. © 1994 Wiley-Liss, Inc...|$|R
40|$|A novel {{flow cell}} has been {{developed}} to study the mechanisms of steady state, cocurrent, multiphase flow through porous media on a microscopic level. It consists of a rectangular capillary tube packed with a bilayer of monodisperse glass beads 109 microns in diameter. The pore sizes in the model are {{of the order of}} magnitude of those in actual petroleum reservoirs. An enhanced video microscopy and digital image processing system was used to record and analyze the flow data. Several pre-equilibrated fluid systems covering a wide range of interfacial tensions were studied using a syringe pump capable of producing superficial velocities of 0. 1 to 2, 000 ft/day. With this combination the capillary number Ca was studied from 10 - 7 to 1. 0. Displacement experiments were performed to investigate the qualitative behavior of flow in the novel micromodel. Nonwetting oleic phase was trapped at low Ca (< 10 - 3), and improved recovery was observed as Ca was increased. Complete recovery of nonwetting phase was obtained with both liquid crystalline and middle phase microemulsion/excess oil systems at high Ca = 0. 01. For the steady cocurrent flow experiments a volumetric injection ratio of 1 : 1 was primarily used, but experiments with various ratios up to 10 : 1 were performed, with no basic change in observed flow mechanism. At low capillary numbers, the expected stable continuous tortuous paths are observed. At a capillary number of about 0. 001 these continuous paths break down and the nonwetting phase starts flowing freely in large regions 10 - 20 pore diameters in length in the direction of flow. A steady state equilibrium mobile ganglion size is observed at a given capillary number. As the capillary number is increased, these regions become smaller until finally single pore size ganglia are flowing freely at a Ca of about 0. 01. If the capillary number is increased above this value, the size of the nonwetting phase ganglia continues to decrease, even falling below the pore throat diameter. Eventually the small drops stretch out into a filament type flow where viscous forces predominate and several <b>filaments</b> <b>pass</b> through a pore throat simultaneously...|$|R

Doppler measurements of peak velocities for vascular applications provide {{an indication of the}} degree of the stenosis which will ultimately assist in deciding how a patient is managed. It is imperative that Doppler systems are capable of accurately measuring blood flow velocities to ensure correct diagnosis and appropriate patient treatment; therefore such systems should be evaluated regularly as part of a Quality Assurance program. Although a range of Doppler test phantoms have been developed for quality control (QC) purposes to establish the measurement accuracy and stability of Doppler systems {{only a limited number of}} such test phantoms are commercially available, the easiest of these devices to operate is the String Phantom. Currently, only one string Doppler phantom is commercially available, namely the CIRS Model 043. In this study an evaluation of the performance of this test device was carried out as a number of problems currently exist with it such as the filament type, the fact that the <b>filament</b> <b>passes</b> through a water–air interface and vibrations from the motor. This study has established that the braided-silk filament, provided with the phantom, should not be used as it introduces errors of as much as 24 % for the mean velocity accuracy and 20 % for the intrinsic spectral broadening (ISB) depending on the soak time of the filament. Rather, to avoid such errors it is advised that the phantom be retrofitted with a filament made from an O-ring rubber. While this eliminates the temporal changes in backscatter seen with the braided-silk filament, further discrepancies were observed, even with an O-ring filament, when the filament velocity was set in the range 26 – 44 cm/s, where a resonance effect significantly increased the variability of the maximum velocity accuracy and ISB measurements. This was most likely as a result of the imposed vibrations from the motor, which is mounted directly onto the tank wall; hence, it would prove practical to avoid taking measurements in this velocity range where resonance effects are observed...|$|R
40|$|The {{results are}} {{presented}} of {{an investigation of the}} production of ultra-short undamped electromagnetic waves by using the method of H. Barkhausen and K. Kurz. Method of working diagrams. Normal waves and dwarf waves. A method is developed for the graphic representation of the work of generators of ultra-short waves. This method is based on the construction of special "working diagrams. " These diagrams define the location of "regions of oscillations," which show the values of the natural periods of the oscillating circuits and the values of the grid potentials at which oscillations are generated. Vacuum tubes can generate two kinds of ultra-short waves. The first kind have a wave-length approximating that computed by Barkhausen's formula λ^ 2 Eg=da^ 210 ^ 6. Their period is nearly equal to the time required for the electrons to move from the filament to the plate and back (normal waves). The second kind of waves are considerably shorter (dwarf waves). Both kinds of waves satisfy the equation λ^ 2 Eg=const. for points on the working diagram where the plate current (the amplitude of the oscillations) has its maximum value. Complex working diagrams. Dwarf waves of higher orders. Vacuum tubes can have complex working diagrams with a large number of regions of oscillations. In such a case the tube generates different dwarf waves. Their length is two, three and four times shorter than that of the normal waves. Dwarf waves are accordingly divided into waves of the 1 st, 2 nd, 3 rd, etc. orders. The shortest dwarf waves of the 4 th order, generated by tubes of the type R 5, had a wave-length λ= 9. 4 cm. The presence of dwarf waves of higher orders shows that vacuum tubes can generate oscillations of a frequency considerably greater than the frequency of the electronic oscillations. Both the normal and dwarf waves belong to the same type of GM-oscillations. Limits were determined within which Barkhausen's formula is applicable. It is shown that the difference in the number of regions of oscillations on the working diagrams depends on the difference in the time required for the electrons to pass in different directions within the tube. The latter depends on the asymmetry in the arrangement of the electrodes. The nature of dwarf waves. Dwarf waves are oscillations of the circuits within the tube or coupled with the tube which are excited in such a manner that during the time τ it takes for the electrons to <b>pass</b> from the <b>filament</b> to the plate and back, the circuits perform two complete oscillations (dwarf waves of the 1 st order), three complete oscillations (dwarf waves of the 2 nd order) etc. Thus the wave-lengths are equal to: λ 0 =c 0 τ (normal waves), λ 1 =c 0 τ/ 2 (dwarf waves of the 1 st order), λ 2 =c 0 τ/ 3 (dwarf waves of the 2 nd order), λ 3 =c 0 τ/ 4 (dwarf waves of the 3 rt order), etc. Dwarf waves 9. 5 - 18. 5 cm long originate in oscillating circuits, which are inside the tube. The advantages of dwarf waves of higher orders are shown, owing to the possibility of using lower grid potentials, which leads to a greater steadiness in the operation of the tube...|$|R
