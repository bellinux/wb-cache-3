50|$|A study {{demonstrated}} that standard automotive 3-point restraints fitted with pyrotechnic or electric <b>pretensioners</b> {{were not able}} to eliminate all interior passenger compartment head strikes in rollover test conditions. Electric <b>pretensioners</b> are often incorporated on vehicles equipped with precrash systems; they are designed to reduce seat belt slack in a potential collision and assist in placing the occupants in a more optimal seating position. The electric <b>pretensioners</b> also can operate on a repeated or sustained basis, providing better protection {{in the event of an}} extended rollover or a multiple collision accident.|$|R

50|$|In May 2014, Holden {{recalled}} nearly 42,000 VF and WN Caprice models after {{a potential}} problem with the front seatbelts was identified. It {{was found that the}} <b>pretensioner</b> wiring harness for the seatbelts could make contact with part of the buckle assembly, leading to premature wearing of the wiring harness which could disable the <b>pretensioner</b> system {{in the event of an}} accident. The VF was recalled again a month later, when it was found that the drive gear for the windscreen wiper motor could fail. LPG models were recalled in July after it was identified that the feed hose could develop a slow leak at the end of the vehicle's lifetime, creating a low risk of fire.|$|E

50|$|For {{export markets}} (and also the Iranian market), IKCO {{is using the}} Peugot TU5JP4 engine for Samand. This is because the TU5 is a low {{consumption}} and powerful engine {{and because of the}} ease of finding its parts all over the Europe, since the TU5 has been used for the Peugeot 206, Peugeot 307 and Peugeot 207.The TU5 version of Samand comes with three new options: driver airbag, <b>pretensioner</b> seat-belts, headlight height adjuster and active antenna.|$|E
5000|$|Pretensioners preemptively {{tighten the}} belt {{to prevent the}} {{occupant}} from jerking forward in a crash. Mercedes-Benz first introduced pretensioners on the 1981 S-Class. In {{the event of a}} crash, a <b>pretensioner</b> will tighten the belt almost instantaneously. This reduces the motion of the occupant in a violent crash. Like airbags, pretensioners are triggered by sensors in the car's body, and many pretensioners have used explosively expanding gas to drive a piston that retracts the belt. Pretensioners also lower the risk of [...] "submarining", which occurs when a passenger slides forward under a loosely fitted seat belt.|$|E
5000|$|Safety {{was a key}} {{focus of}} the Megane I, Renault's first car {{reflecting}} their new focus of selling on safety. It featured a pillar-mounted three-point seatbelt for the middle-rear occupant (replacing the common 'lap strap'), standard front belt pre-tensioners and load limiters, driver's airbag (passenger airbag from 1996) and an impressive safety structure - a specification ahead of most rivals in 1995. Some features, such as the three-point middle belt, had debuted on the Renault 19 safety concept vehicle (and this feature entered production on the Renault Laguna before the Megane). The car also benefited from Renault's first [...] "System for Restraint and Protection" [...] (SRP), essentially a system of careful optimisation of occupant restraint by interaction of the seat, seatbelt, <b>pretensioner,</b> load limiter and airbag. The Megane I achieved a best-in-class 4-star crash test rating in the 1998 round of testing by Euro NCAP.|$|E

5000|$|Some systems also pre-emptively {{tighten the}} belt during fast {{accelerations}} and strong decelerations, {{even if no}} crash has happened. This has the advantage that it may help prevent the driver from sliding out of position during violent evasive maneuvers, which could cause loss of control of the vehicle. These pre-emptive safety systems may prevent some collisions from happening, as well as reducing injury in the event an actual collision occurs. [...] Pre-emptive systems generally use electric <b>pretensioners</b> which can operate repeatedly and for a sustained period, rather than pyrotechnic <b>pretensioners,</b> which can only operate a single time.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This study {{presents}} the practical design modification {{to improve the}} retracting performance of the pyro-typed high power <b>pretensioner.</b> 3 components of the <b>pretensioner</b> are redesigned and {{the usefulness of the}} design modification is verified by the experiment. During the pretensioning process, the gas blast generated from the gunpowder is transferred to the rack-pinion gear through the manifold. The rack-pinion gear is connected with the spool where the webbing is rolled up. According to the rotation of the pinion, the spool is turned and the webbing is winded. To help the gas blast flow well, the shape of the inner cross section of the manifold is changed. The spur gear design program is developed and used to find the best combination of the rack-pinion gear pair to increase the power transmission efficiency. The pinion guide is installed on the spool to prevent the vibration of the pinion. As a result of the experiment, the amount of the web retraction length is increased when every single design modification is applied. Therefore, the retracting performance of the <b>pretensioner</b> is considered to be improved if the presented design modifications are applied.

40|$|Objective: The {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to investigate the effects by crash related car parameters on head and chest injury measures for 3 - and 12 -year-old children in near side impacts. Methods: The evaluation was made by using a model of a complete passenger car which was impacted laterally by a barrier. The car model was validated in two crash conditions: the IIHS and the USNCAP side impact tests. The SID-IIs and the HBM 3 (THUMS 3 -yo) finite element models were used for the parametric investigation (HBM 3 on a booster). The car parameters were: vehicle mass, side impact structure stiffness, a head airbag, a thorax-pelvis airbag, and a seat belt with <b>pretensioner.</b> The studied dependent variables were: resultant head linear acceleration, resultant head rotational acceleration, chest viscous criterion, rib deflection, and relative velocity at head impact. The chest measurements were only considered for the SID-IIs. Results: The head airbag had the greatest effect on the head measurements for both of the occupant models. On average, it reduced the peak head linear acceleration by 54 g for the HBM 3 and 78 g for the SID-IIs. The seat belt had the second greatest effect on the head measurements; the peak head linear accelerations were reduced on average by 39 g (HBM 3) and 44 g (SID-IIs). The high stiffness side structure increased the SID-IIs head acceleration, while it had marginal effect on the HBM 3. The vehicle mass had marginal effect on SID-IIs head accelerations, while the lower vehicle mass caused 18 g higher head acceleration for HBM 3 and the greatest rotational acceleration. The thorax-pelvis airbag, the vehicle mass and the seat belt <b>pretensioner</b> affected the chest measurements the most. The presence of a thorax-pelvis airbag, high vehicle mass and a seat belt <b>pretensioner</b> all reduced the chest VC and peak rib deflection in the SID-IIs. Conclusions: The head and thorax-pelvis airbags have the potential to reduce injury measurements for both the SID-IIs and the HBM 3, provided that the airbag properties are designed to consider these occupant sizes also. The seat belt <b>pretensioner</b> is also effective, provided that the lateral translation of the torso is managed by other features. The importance of lateral movement management is greater the smaller the occupant is. Light vehicles require interior restraint systems of higher performance than heavy vehicles do to achieve the same level of injury measures for a given side structure...|$|E
40|$|In a rollover, the lap {{part of the}} 3 -point belt {{certainly}} restrains {{the occupant}} from being fully ejected out of the vehicle, however the upper torso of the far side occupant may slip out of the shoulder belt. In this study the combination of reversed 3 -point belt geometry (seat integrated), inboard torso side-support and buckle <b>pretensioner</b> were evaluated regarding the ability to better restrain the upper torso to the seat to prevent head-to-interior impacts. The method of evaluation, proposed and used in this paper, was a new sled test method simulating full-scale tripped rollovers along the longitudinal axis during the initial phase of tripping, the airborne phase and the first ground impact. The roof was assumed in the tests {{to be able to}} withstand the ground impact. Since car occupants normally are seated with a certain kyfosis and may straighten and elongate their spine, standard HIII ATDs were modified with 3 D-flexible lumbar spines and used in both front seat positions. As a result, the rollover sled test method worked properly with good repeatability. While the head of the non-leading side (far-side) dummy impacted the inner roof in the standard 3 -point belt configuration, the seat integrated 3 -point belt with reversed geometry and buckle <b>pretensioner</b> showed ability to restrain the torso from moving inboard and towards the roof during the rollover tests...|$|E
40|$|Objective: Investigate the {{combined}} effects of belt geometry, seat substructure, and seat belt <b>pretensioners</b> and load limiters on rear seat occupant injury risk. Methods: An instrumented Hybrid III 5 th percentile adult female dummy {{was subjected to}} simulated frontal impacts (Δv = 45. 8 km/h, peak acceleration = 27. 1 g). Testing was conducted on a rear seat of a typical family sedan with modifications allowing for adjustment in upper anchorage position, mounting of an antisubmarining seat pan, {{and the use of}} seat belt <b>pretensioners</b> with load limiters. Results: Dummy seated posture had the strongest effect on submarining. Seat belt <b>pretensioners</b> with load limiters reduced head and femur excursion and decreased chest injury measurements but did not prevent submarining. The antisubmarining seat pan, on the other hand, prevented submarining in one case but could not prevent submarining with the dummy in a slouched posture. Upper anchorage position resulting in poor belt geometry was shown to increase both chest injury measures and submarining. Conclusions: The results from this study demonstrate the importance of an upright seated posture and the potential benefits of including adjustable upper anchorages to allow good sash belt fit, antisubmarining seat pans, belt buckles positioned near the seat bight, and seat belts with <b>pretensioners</b> and load limiters for rear seat occupants. These data can be used to inform the design of a system of restraints to reduce injuries to rear seat occupants. © 2014 Copyright Taylor & Francis Group, LLC...|$|R

40|$|Objective: The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to validate a mathematical simulation model of the Q 3 ATD in an integrated forward-facing booster-type restraint in the rear seat and to evaluate restraint parameters to further develop design guidelines for this type of restraint system for forward facing children corresponding {{to the size of the}} Q 3. Only frontal impact was considered. Methods: The software MADYMO was used to create and run the model of the restraint system and model of the child. The restraint system consisted of a seat and a safety belt. The child dummy model was the Q 3. The complete model was validated to sled tests on 12 response signals: displacements of the dummy model, safety belt forces, and dummy model accelerations. The method used in the evaluation of the restraint parameters was a factorial design of experiments (DOE). The study included a total of 9 parameters: 6 related to the safety belt, such as <b>pretensioner,</b> load limiter, and belt anchor positions; two parameters related to the seat (stiffness and pitch angle); and one related to the foot support. The parameters were evaluated based on their effect on a number of dummy model responses. Results: The validation study showed that the mathematical model predicted the ATD's kinematics and measurements. Furthermore, the parameters that had the greatest effect on the dummy model responses were the lap belt angle, the D-ring x and y positions (upper belt anchor), the retractor <b>pretensioner,</b> and the retractor load limiter. The lap belt angle had the greatest effects of all parameters. The resulting head x displacement was 7. 8 cm shorter with a lap belt angle of 24 degrees to the horizontal, compared to a 73 degrees to the horizontal lap belt angle; it also resulted in a reduction of the head resultant acceleration by 9. 8 g. Conclusions: In order to decrease the Q 3 ATD head, chest and pelvis accelerations and to limit the Q 3 ATD head displacement, the following practices are recommended: first, position the D-ring rearward of the ATD so that the belt encloses the ATD's shoulder; second, position the lap belt anchors to make the lap belt angle 24 degrees to the horizontal, but make sure submarining is not induced; and finally, use a safety belt with <b>pretensioner</b> and load limiter functions. However, these recommendations need to be balanced with the recommendations for other occupant sizes, and any specific settings have to be evaluated further before introduction into vehicles. </p...|$|E

A general description of the car setup, the driver remote control system, data acquisition, dummies and barrier test layout and general overview of the test outcomes are described. The tests investigate the performance of barriers used on Victorian state roads in Australia, particularly in relation to how severe a roadside barrier crash is to the front seated occupants in a small car. Another objective was to determine for which barriers and test configurations the on-board crashworthiness systems such as the airbags would fire. Results indicate clearly that barriers need to be ductile and absorb energy, {{and need to be}} installed properly, if they are to provide adequate protection for vehicle occupants. Results also indicate vehicle manufacturers must consider impacts into such systems when tuning <b>pretensioner</b> and airbag occupant protection systems...|$|E
