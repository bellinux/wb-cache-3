40|$|Illegal filesharing on the {{internet}} leads to considerable financial losses for artists and copyright owners as well as producers and sellers of music. Thus far, measures to contain this phenomenon have been rather restrictive. However, {{there are still a}} considerable number of illegal systems, and users are able to decide quite freely between legal and illegal downloads because the latter are still difficult to sanction. Recent economic approaches account for the improved bargaining position of users. They are based on the idea of revenue-splitting between <b>professional</b> <b>sellers</b> and peers. In order to test such an innovative business model, the study reported in this article carried out an experiment with 100 undergraduate students, forming five small peer-to-peer networks. The networks were confronted with different economic conditions. The results indicate that even experienced filesharers hold favourable attitudes towards revenue-splitting. They seem to be willing to adjust their behaviour to different economic conditions. ...|$|R
40|$|The broad aim of {{this paper}} is to gain some insight into the {{quantitative}} importance of reputation in e-commerce. We use an exhaustive data set from one of France’s largest e-commerce platforms, PriceMinister. com, to estimate a statistical causal effect of a seller’s reputation (and size) on transaction prices for a uniquely large range of product categories (books, CDs, video games or DVDs), product conditions (used or new) and seller types (individual or <b>professional</b> <b>sellers).</b> We go beyond the results currently available in the empirical literature by tackling the issue of seller unobserved heterogeneity and the weak exogeneity of reputation (and size) in price equations. Our results show large-scale empirical evidence of a significant, positive and strong effect of seller reputation on prices Special thanks to Sebastien Mitraille who helped us start this project.

40|$|Floating-priced {{convertible}}s, {{known as}} "death spirals," are privately held convertible securities with a conversion price {{set at a}} discount from the average of past stock prices in a look-back period. The issuance of floating-priced convertibles is followed by significant negative abnormal returns. Two alternative hypotheses are explored. The "faulty contract hypothesis" argues that the contract design encourages short-selling by the convertible holders and other <b>professional</b> short <b>sellers.</b> The selling pressure and the conversion below fair value triggers a permanent decrease in the share price that generates a "death spiral. " The "lastresort financing hypothesis" argues that the stock price declines because the stock is overvalued {{at the time of}} the issue. Consistent with the faulty contract design hypothesis, the conversion discount is the most important predictor of long-term performance. Consistent with the last-resort financing hypothesis, issuers experience a significant decline in post-issue operating profitability relative to benchmark firms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This thesis {{contains}} three independent essays: Chapter 1 is a co-authored {{paper with}} my PhD colleague Yibai Yang. In Chapter 1, we analyze decisions of firms on outsourcing of intermediate goods and R&D investment. If firms choose in-house production, a high profit discount is incurred {{due to the}} inefficiency of producing the intermediate goods, whereas if firms search for and outsource to specialists, the production costs decrease, but an imitation risk arises by specialists, who may become competitors in the final-good market. Accordingly, patents are used to mitigate this possibility, which are costly. We show that in outsourcing, all firms outsource to the same specialist to minimize the possibility of successful imitation in equilibrium. Moreover, an interior equilibrium shows that firms still invest in R&D activities and outsource their intermediate goods with some patent protection, even though the selected specialist put effort into imitation. In Chapter 2, a repeated-purchase model with sequential search has been constructed, where agents have one-period memory. The contribution of the chapter is twofold: (1) the chapter extends the standard Diamond Paradox to a repeated setting and found two classes of symmetric equilibria, while one is replicating the diamond paradox in every period, the other is with a price that ensures visited consumers to return in the next period. (2) the chapter provides the first modeling study that, equilibrium price dispersion can be generated with homogeneous agents due to the choice of whether to have a repeated relationship. It is found that such equilibria with price dispersion can be supported only if the market is not perfectly stable (in the model, only after {{the introduction of a}} probability that a repeated relationship will break down with a certain exogenous probability, equilibrium price dispersion can be generated). In Chapter 3, behavioral observations are made from a self-collected ebay auctions dataset. The dataset offers two distinctive features differ from existing literature. Firstly, the dataset contains nine different electronic products valuing range from approximately 30 to 650 dollars, which allows the author to investigate sellers' behaviors across different price ranges. The data shows that, when the book value of products changes, sellers choose different reserve prices (in percentage terms) and differ in the usage of secret reserves. The author thus suggests that a number of results from previous field experiment literature (of auctioning a single homogeneous product) may not be robust to a change in product value. Secondly, in the dataset, <b>professional</b> <b>sellers</b> are distinguished from nonprofessional <b>sellers.</b> When <b>professional</b> and nonprofessional <b>sellers</b> run auctions in a competing environment, the data shows that they frequently follow different strategies. The differences in strategies are reported in this chapter, which offers insights into the competing auction literature. Access is restricted to staff and students of the University of Sydney.

40|$|Abstract—Over the years, the Internet {{has become}} more and more present in {{commerce}} and industry. During this time, many sectors of the industry embraced the Web and <b>professional</b> buyers, <b>sellers</b> and brokers started using new tools to conduct their business. This endorsement {{led to the creation of}} communities relying on a Web hub to communicate, as well as to exchange goods, services and critical business information-hence the emergence of electronic networks. Various business models were introduced to serve these industries and build these networks. Their respective communities of users, along with technology providers, carved these networks. As a result, many forms of business models emerged. Some of them evolved into mature markets while others were being created. During the process, several challenges were faced. Amongst them: Creating a critical mass of users, operating the networks, getting to know the targeted industries, all the while maintaining a strong, reliable and competitive technology framework. Mediagrif is celebrating a decade of Electronic Commerce enablement and has acquired a unique experience in this field. This paper presents an overview of some of these business models, through case studies, and attempts to shed some light on the challenges that were encountered. I...|$|R
40|$|The general {{decline of}} {{manufacturing}} in the United States {{has had a}} major impact on North Carolina and its furniture cluster, which employed 90, 000 people in the 1980 s but today employs only 47, 000. Since 2001, more than 200 furniture companies in North Carolina have closed. Presently, unemployment rates in the counties where the cluster is centered range from 13 - 15 %. We conducted over twenty interviews with North Carolina industry participants and policy-makers, few of whom sounded optimistic about the current trajectory of the cluster. Our research revealed that firms are focusing on short-term profits instead of building long-run sustainable competitive advantage through investments in automation, productivity, design and innovation. However, the cluster has many of the essential ingredients for success: highly trained workers, proximity to high quality timber, access to major ports, a location central to 60 % of the US market, a strong network of specialized industries (e. g. logistics, warehousing, software, factoring) that support the cluster, and the High Point Market, which connects over 85, 000 <b>professional</b> buyers and <b>sellers.</b> Reinvigorating the cluster will require action from firms, government, and Institutions for Collaboration to improve competitiveness. We present policy recommendations to address the broad issues we have identified as impacting the United States, North Carolina, and the cluster...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT Innovative {{structured}} {{products have}} proved particularly popular for potential high returns. Retail clients are generally {{lack of knowledge}} and expertise in structured products. The complexity of structured products arise wide concerns. Even sellers find structured products difficult to explain. There is a risk that customers may not really understand what they are buying. Assuring control standards and accurate representation are important for risk protection. Hong Kong is one of most active structured products markets in Asia. There is no limit to how complex a structured product can be {{if it is to}} be offered to Hong Kong retail market. More unsophisticated retail clients in that market are taking risky investments. This study is to find out whether the sales control of banks in Hong Kong on retail structured products are conformed to global standards, that is, the hypothesis being tested. A two-phase research composed of a questionnaire survey and an on-site examination program are conducted. The research findings show that the control standards of banks in Hong Kong on retail sales of structured products did not meet with global standards. Besides, the study finds that banks in Hong Kong in general tend to profit-oriented and do not put much emphasis on risk controls. Also, the following key issues are identified: (i) one fourth of sellers handling the complex structured products have less than one year's sales experience in structured products; (ii) the respondents of the survey reveal that incentive compensation programs of banks do result in unsuitable recommendations to clients; (iii) the role and obligation of banks and product owner have not been properly disclosed; (iv) the information of clients disclosed have not been properly documented; and (iv) the existence of gap between the knowledge and competence of staff and their behavioral performance at works towards sales control. Based on these findings, some suggestions are proposed: firstly, banks may need to secure both entry standards and continuing <b>professional</b> development to <b>sellers</b> to reduce risk of mis-representation; secondly, the disclosures of role and obligation of bank and product owner should become compulsory; lastly, it should be mandatory for sellers to assess retail clients' risk bearing ability before the selling. Whatever an excellent control policy is, it must be acted upon by staff, otherwise, it is meaningless to clients. Banks should closely monitor the behavioral performance and attitude of staff in sales control. Putting guidelines into practices is important...|$|R
