5|$|George's grandfather, King George II, {{disliked the}} <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales, and took little {{interest}} in his grandchildren. However, in 1751 the <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales died unexpectedly from a lung injury, and George became heir apparent to the throne. He inherited one of his father's titles and became the Duke of Edinburgh. Now more interested in his grandson, three weeks later the King created George <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales (the title is not automatically acquired).|$|E

5|$|In addition, Aragorn created Faramir <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Ithilien and {{appointed}} Beregond Captain of Faramir's guard, the White Company. Faramir, as <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Ithilien, {{together with the}} <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Dol Amroth became King Elessar's chief commanders. In a draft letter to a reader of The Lord of the Rings, J. R. R. Tolkien writes that as <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Ithilien, Faramir's duties also included acting as resident march-warden of Gondor's main eastward outpost, rehabilitating the lost territories, as well as clearing it of outlaws and Orcs and cleansing Minas Morgul (an old Gondorian city, once named Minas Ithil, that Sauron had taken) of evil remnants. Faramir also fulfilled the traditional role of Steward, acting as the King’s chief counsellor and ruling Gondor in his absence.|$|E

5|$|In the reconvened Parliament, Fox and Pitt wrangled {{over the}} terms of a regency during the King's incapacity. While both agreed that it would be most {{reasonable}} for George III's eldest son and heir apparent, the <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales, to act as regent, to Pitt’s consternation Fox suggested that it was the <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales's absolute right to act on his ill father's behalf with full powers. Pitt, fearing he would be removed from office if the <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales were empowered, argued that it was for Parliament to nominate a regent, and wanted to restrict the regent's authority. In February 1789, the Regency Bill, authorising the <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales to act as regent, was introduced and passed in the House of Commons, but before the House of Lords could pass the bill, George III recovered.|$|E
5|$|On 1 January 1794, Thomson {{spoke with}} a ship that was sailing for Botany Bay. The ship had {{encountered}} a French privateer, of 14 guns, which the British ship managed to drive off after an engagement that lasted almost two hours. Reportedly, <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales went on to recapture a British brig that a French 74-gun ship of the line had captured. <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales sent the brig into Oporto.

50|$|In 1641, {{again by}} marriage, Anholt was {{acquired}} by the <b>princes</b> <b>of</b> Salm, and passed to the Salm-Salm division of Salm. When Salm-Salm was annexed by France in 1793, Anholt became the seat and main possession <b>of</b> the <b>princes</b> <b>of</b> Salm-Salm. In 1802, the <b>princes</b> <b>of</b> Salm-Salm, together with their relatives, the <b>princes</b> <b>of</b> Salm-Kyrburg, received the newly created Principality of Salm as a compensation for their losses from the Empire; this much larger new Principality was adjacent to Anholt and eventually incorporated it.|$|R
5|$|<b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales and Repulse {{were the}} first capital ships to be sunk solely by naval air power on the open sea (albeit by {{land-based}} rather than carrier-based aircraft), a harbinger of the diminishing role this class of ships was to play in naval warfare thereafter. It is often pointed out, however, that contributing factors to the sinking of <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales were her surface-scanning radars being inoperable, depriving Force Z {{of one of its}} most potent early-warning devices and the critical early damage she sustained from the first torpedo. Another factor which led to <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Waless demise was the loss of dynamos, depriving <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales of many of her electric pumps. Further electrical failures left parts of the ship in total darkness, and added to the difficulties of her damage repair parties as they attempted to counter the flooding.|$|E
5|$|The North Staffordshire Regiment (<b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales's) {{was a line}} {{infantry}} regiment of the British Army, {{which was}} in existence between 1881 and 1959.

In 1881, under the Childers Reforms, the 64th Regiment of Foot was merged with the 98th (<b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales's) Regiment of Foot (originally raised in 1824) to form the <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales's (North Staffordshire Regiment).

5|$|Bismarck then shifted fire to <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales. The British {{battleship}} {{scored a}} hit on Bismarck with her sixth salvo, but the German ship found her mark with her first salvo. One of the shells struck the bridge on <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales, though it did not explode and instead exited the other side, killing everyone in the ship's command centre, save Captain John Leach, the ship's commanding officer, and one other. The two German ships continued to fire upon <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales, causing serious damage. Guns malfunctioned on the recently commissioned British ship, which still had civilian technicians aboard. Despite the technical faults in the main battery, <b>Prince</b> <b>of</b> Wales scored three hits on Bismarck in the engagement. The first struck her in the forecastle above the waterline but low enough to allow the crashing waves to enter the hull. The second shell struck below the armoured belt and exploded on contact with the torpedo bulkhead completely flooding a turbo-generator room and partially flooding an adjacent boiler room.

Albert and Victoria were horrified by their son's indiscretion, and feared blackmail, scandal or pregnancy.
