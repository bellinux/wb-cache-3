5|$|In 1999, Chancellor Gerhard Schröder's {{government}} {{defined a}} new basis for German foreign policy by {{taking part in}} the NATO decisions surrounding the Kosovo War and by sending German troops into combat {{for the first time since}} 1945.

5|$|In November 1982, Daley {{announced}} his first campaign for mayor. The {{candidates in the}} three-way Democratic primary, which included incumbent Mayor Jane Byrne, a former protegée of his father, and Congressman Harold Washington, {{held a series of}} four televised debates. Daley finished third. Many of Richard J.'s <b>political</b> <b>allies</b> blamed Richard M. for splitting the white vote, enabling Washington to become Chicago's first black mayor.|$|E

5|$|Sejanus {{was born}} in 20 BC at Volsinii, Etruria, into the family of Lucius Seius Strabo. The Seii were Romans of the equestrian class (or knights), the lower of the two upper social classes of the Roman Republic and the early Roman Empire. Sejanus' {{grandfather}} maintained relations with senatorial families through his marriage with Terentia, a sister of the wife of Gaius Maecenas, {{who was one of}} Emperor Augustus' most powerful <b>political</b> <b>allies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Though Stanley and Black won the {{election}}, {{they never}} became <b>political</b> <b>allies.</b> At {{the time of}} their election and service, the Kentucky Constitution prescribed that the lieutenant governor would act as governor any time the governor left the state. Consequently, Stanley refused to travel out of state on vacation because he feared he would not approve of anyone Black would appoint to any unfilled governmental offices while he was gone.|$|E
5|$|Daley {{received}} criticism when family, personal friends, and <b>political</b> <b>allies</b> {{seemed to}} disproportionately benefit from city contracting. He {{took office in}} a city with regular annual budget surpluses and left the city with massive structural deficits. His budgets ran up the largest deficits in Chicago history. Prior to serving as mayor, Daley served in the Illinois Senate and then as the Cook County State's Attorney. Police use of force was an issue in Daley's tenures as state's attorney and mayor.|$|E

5|$|However, controversies over {{domestic}} reforms, Poland's 1999 {{entry into}} NATO, and the accession process to the European Union, combined with AWS fights with its <b>political</b> <b>allies</b> (the Freedom Union—Unia Wolności) and infighting within AWS itself, {{as well as}} corruption, eventually resulted {{in the loss of}} much public support. AWS leader Marian Krzaklewski lost the 2000 presidential election, and in the 2001 parliamentary elections AWS failed to elect a single deputy to the parliament. After this debacle, Krzaklewski was replaced by Janusz Śniadek (in 2002) but the union decided to distance itself from politics.|$|E
5|$|In this context, Tătărescu {{chose to}} back the regime, as the PNL, like the National Peasants' Party, {{remained}} active in nominal clandestinity (as the law banning {{it had never been}} enforced any further). Having personally signed the document banning opposition parties, he was expelled from the PNL in April 1938, and contested the legitimacy of the action for the following years. Allegedly, his ousting was recommended by Iuliu Maniu, leader of the National Peasants' Party's and, for the following years, the closest of Dinu Brătianu's <b>political</b> <b>allies.</b>|$|E
5|$|Napoleon had {{calculated}} that Kutuzov, expecting reinforcements from Russia {{to defend its}} <b>political</b> <b>allies,</b> would withdraw toward Vienna; he envisioned that his and Kutuzov's armies would engage in a great battle at Vienna, and that this battle would decide the war. Consequently, Napoleon drew divisions from four of the other seven corps of the Grande Armée {{to create a new}} VIII Corps. This corps was to secure the north shore of the Danube, block any of the Austrian or Russian groups from reinforcing one another and, more importantly, prevent Kutuzov from crossing the river and escaping to Russia.|$|E

5|$|The Mothers of the Plaza de Mayo {{held their}} final {{demonstration}} in 2006, believing that Kirchner, unlike previous presidents, {{was not their}} enemy. They became <b>political</b> <b>allies</b> of Kirchner, who placed them in prominent locations during his speeches, and the group became a powerful NGO. He further underscored civilian control over the military by appointing Nilda Garré — {{who had been a}} political prisoner during the Dirty War — the country's first woman Minister of Defense. As a result of his policies and approach, relations between the civilian authorities and the military remained tense throughout Kirchner's presidency.|$|E
5|$|Theramenes {{remained}} a controversial figure after his death; Lysias vigorously denounced him while prosecuting {{several of his}} former <b>political</b> <b>allies,</b> but others defended his actions. Modern historical assessments have shifted over time; in the 19th century, Theramenes's part in the coup of 411 BC and his use of Arginusae were widely condemned, but newly discovered ancient texts and 20th-century scholarship supported more positive assessments. Some historians have found in Theramenes a selfish opportunist, others a principled moderate. The details of his actions, his motivations, and his character continue to be debated down to the present day.|$|E
5|$|Wilson is also {{recognized}} {{for being a}} political pioneer in techniques for determining public opinion while he held office. In the 20th century, the straw poll and scientific public opinion polls by companies including Gallup became standard parts of political campaigns and media coverage of elections. During his Senate career, Wilson pioneered straw polling by sampling the views of Massachusetts voters through in person conversations and unscientific written surveys before making his own views known. These efforts were credited with helping Wilson build coalitions, win elections, make <b>political</b> <b>allies,</b> and determine {{the best time to}} act in the Senate on issues of importance.|$|E

5|$|A {{newcomer}} to the Carter administration and to national politics, Goldschmidt traded not only on his experience in transportation planning, but on his political acumen as well; following Carter's unsuccessful bid for re-election, Goldschmidt expressed doubts about the Democratic Party's future if it couldn't learn to cultivate <b>political</b> <b>allies</b> more effectively. Goldschmidt's time in Washington, DC, informed his own understanding of politics, as well. He remained in office through {{the remainder of the}} Carter administration. In late 1979, Republican presidential hopeful John B. Anderson called for Goldschmidt's resignation, and members of the United States Senate Banking Committee later chastised him, for having suggested that he would withhold transportation funds from municipalities, such as Chicago and Philadelphia, whose mayors supported Ted Kennedy in his primary election bid against Carter. Goldschmidt resigned at the conclusion of Carter's term on January 20, 1981.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{its initial}} {{focus on the}} elites, the Union was {{successful}} in raising funds from across French society. Schoolchildren and ordinary citizens gave, as did 181French municipalities. Laboulaye's <b>political</b> <b>allies</b> supported the call, as did descendants of the French contingent in the American Revolutionary War. Less idealistically, contributions came from those who hoped for American support in the French attempt to build the Panama Canal. The copper {{may have come from}} multiple sources and some of it is said to have come from a mine in Visnes, Norway, though this has not been conclusively determined after testing samples. According to Cara Sutherland in her book on the statue for the Museum of the City of New York, 90,800 kilos (200,000 pounds) was needed to build the statue, and the French copper industrialist Eugène Secrétan donated 58,100 kilos (128,000 pounds) of copper.|$|E
5|$|During {{the course}} of the Peloponnesian War, Alcibiades changed his {{political}} allegiance several times. In his native Athens in the early 410s BC, he advocated an aggressive foreign policy and was a prominent proponent of the Sicilian Expedition, but he fled to Sparta after his political enemies brought charges of sacrilege against him. In Sparta, he served as a strategic adviser, proposing or supervising several major campaigns against Athens. In Sparta too, however, Alcibiades soon made powerful enemies and felt forced to defect to Persia. There he served as an adviser to the satrap Tissaphernes until his Athenian <b>political</b> <b>allies</b> brought about his recall. He then served as an Athenian general (Strategos) for several years, but his enemies eventually succeeded in exiling him a second time.|$|E

5|$|Edward {{had shown}} {{independence}} in political matters {{as early as}} 1255, when he sided with the Soler family in Gascony, in the ongoing conflict between the Soler and Colomb families. This ran contrary to his father's policy of mediation between the local factions. In May 1258, a group of magnates drew up a document for reform of the King’s government – the so-called Provisions of Oxford – largely directed against the Lusignans. Edward stood by his <b>political</b> <b>allies</b> and strongly opposed the Provisions. The reform movement succeeded in limiting the Lusignan influence, however, and gradually Edward's attitude started to change. In March 1259, he entered into a formal alliance {{with one of the}} main reformers, Richard de Clare, Earl of Gloucester. Then, on 15October 1259, he announced that he supported the barons' goals, and their leader, Simon de Montfort.|$|E
5|$|Fighting soon erupted between {{elements}} of the Pathet Lao and the Royal Lao Army. Although tentative negotiations resumed between the factions, matters took {{a turn for the}} worse when neutralist Prime Minister Prince Souvanna Phouma was arrested during a right-wing coup attempt. U.S. Ambassador Leonard Unger then notified the generals that the U.S. government would continue to support Souvanna. This turn of events had a profound effect on Laotian politics: First, it affirmed American support for Souvannah, only a few years after the U.S. had denounced him as a tool of the leftists; It also caused the neutralists to shift <b>political</b> <b>allies</b> from the left to the right; Finally, in May 1964, Souvannah announced the political union of the rightists and neutralists against the left.|$|E
5|$|In 1839, Melbourne {{resigned}} after Radicals and Tories (both of whom Victoria detested) {{voted against}} {{a bill to}} suspend the constitution of Jamaica. The bill removed political power from plantation owners who were resisting measures associated with the abolition of slavery. The Queen commissioned a Tory, Sir Robert Peel, {{to form a new}} ministry. At the time, it was customary for the prime minister to appoint members of the Royal Household, who were usually his <b>political</b> <b>allies</b> and their spouses. Many of the Queen's ladies of the bedchamber were wives of Whigs, and Peel expected to replace them with wives of Tories. In {{what became known as the}} bedchamber crisis, Victoria, advised by Melbourne, objected to their removal. Peel refused to govern under the restrictions imposed by the Queen, and consequently resigned his commission, allowing Melbourne to return to office.|$|E
