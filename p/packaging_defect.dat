40|$|The Rab 27 GTPase {{subfamily}} {{consists of}} two closely related homologs, Rab 27 a and Rab 27 b. Rab 27 a has been shown previously to regulate organelle movement and regulated exocytosis {{in a wide variety}} of secretory cells. However, the role of the more restrictedly expressed Rab 27 b remains unclear. Here we describe the creation of Rab 27 b knockout (KO) strain that was subsequently crossed with the naturally occurring Rab 27 a KO line, ashen, to produce double KO (Rab 27 aash/ash Rab 27 b−/−) mice. Rab 27 b KO (and double KO) exhibit significant hemorrhagic disease in contrast to ashen mice. In vitro assays demonstrated impaired aggregation with collagen and U 46619 and reduced secretion of dense granules in both Rab 27 b and double KO strains. Additionally, we detected a 50 % reduction in the number of dense granules per platelet and diminished platelet serotonin content, possibly due to a dense granule <b>packaging</b> <b>defect</b> into proplatelets during megakaryocyte maturation. The presence of Rab 27 a partially compensated for the secretory defect but not the reduced granule number. The morphology and function of platelet α-granules were unaffected. Our data suggest that Rab 27 b is a key regulator of dense granule secretion in platelets and thus a candidate gene for δ-storage pool deficiency in humans...|$|E
40|$|AbstractTerminase, the DNA {{packaging}} enzyme of bacteriophage λ, is a heteromultimer {{composed of}} gpNu 1 (181 aa) and gpA (641 aa) subunits, encoded by the λ Nu 1 and A genes, respectively. Similarity between the deduced amino acid sequences of gpNu 1 and gpA and the nucleotide binding site consensus sequence suggests that each terminase subunit has an ATP reactive center. Terminase {{has been shown}} to have two distinct ATPase activities. The gpNu 1 subunit has a low-affinity ATPase stimulated by nonspecific DNA and gpA has a high-affinity ATPase. In previous work, a mutant terminase, gpNu 1 K 35 A holoterminase, had a mild defect in interactions with DNA, such that twofold increased DNA concentrations were required both for full stimulation of the low-affinity ATPase and for saturation of the cos cleavage reaction. In addition, the gpNu 1 K 35 A terminase exhibited a post-cleavage defect in DNA packaging that accounted for the lethality of the Nu 1 K 35 A mutation [Y. Hwang and M. Feiss (1997) Virology 231, 218 – 230]. In the work reported here, a mutation in the turn of the putative helix-turn-helix DNA binding domain has been isolated as a suppressor of the gpNu 1 K 35 A change. This suppressor mutation causes the change A 14 V in gpNu 1. A 14 V reverses the DNA-binding defects of gpNu 1 K 35 A terminase, both for stimulation of the low-affinity ATPase and for saturation of the cos cleavage defect.

40|$|Studies on the {{herpes simplex}} virus type 1 UL 25 null mutant KUL 25 NS {{have shown that the}} capsid-associated UL 25 protein is {{required}} at a late stage in the encapsidation of viral DNA. Our previous work on UL 25 using the UL 25 temperature sensitive (ts) mutant, ts 1204, also implicated UL 25 in a role at very early times in the virus growth cycle, possibly at the stage of penetration of the host cell. We have re-examined this mutant and discovered that it had an additional ts mutation elsewhere in the genome. The ts 1204 UL 25 mutation was transferred into wild type virus DNA and the UL 25 mutant ts 1249 was isolated and characterized to clarify the function of UL 25 at the initial stages of virus infection. Indirect immunofluorescence assays and in situ hybridization analysis of virus-infected cells revealed that the mutant ts 1249 was not impaired in penetration of the host cell but had an uncoating defect at the non-permissive temperature. When ts 1249 -infected cells were incubated initially at the permissive temperature to allow uncoating of the viral genome and subsequently transferred to the restrictive temperature, a DNA <b>packaging</b> <b>defect</b> was evident. The results suggested that ts 1249, like KUL 25 NS, had a block at a late stage of DNA packaging and that the packaged genome was shorter than full length.

40|$|A novel mutant of bovine viral {{diarrhea}} virus (BVDV) {{was found}} with a virion assembly phenotype attributable to an insertion into the NS 5 B polymerase locus. This mutant, termed 5 B- 741, was engineered by reverse genetics to express NS 5 B with a C-terminal peptide tag of 22 amino acids. Electroporation of bovine cells with genomic RNA from this mutant showed levels RNA synthesis which were regarded as sufficient for infectivity, yet infectious virions were not produced. Pseudorevertants of mutant 5 B- 741 that released infectious virions and formed plaques revealed a single nucleotide change (T 12369 C). This change resulted in a leucine-to-proline substitution within the NS 5 B tag (L 726 P). Genetic analysis revealed that indeed a single nucleotide change encoding proline at NS 5 B position 726 in the pseudorevertant polyprotein mediated recovery of virion assembly function without improving genomic RNA accumulation levels. A subgenomic BVDV reporter replicon (rNS 3 - 5 B) was {{used to analyze the}} consequences of alterations of the genomic region encoding the NS 5 B C terminus on replication and assembly. Interestingly, rNS 3 - 5 B-L 726 P (revertant) replicated with the same efficiency as the rNS 3 - 5 B- 741 mutant but produced 10 times more virions in a trans-packaging assay. These results indicated that impairment of assembly function in 5 B- 741 was independent of RNA accumulation levels and agreed with the observations from the full-length mutant and revertant genomes. Finally, we recapitulated the <b>packaging</b> <b>defect</b> of 5 B- 741 with a vaccinia virus expression system to eliminate possible unwanted interactions between the helper virus and the packaged replicon.

All three mutants exhibited a wild-type phenotype in directing the production and release of virus particles from transfected HeLa cells. In infectivity assays, HIV- 1 U 5 / 206 del was usually indistinguishable from wild-type virus whereas HIV- 1 U%/ 603 del was unable to infect human peripheral blood mononuclear cells or MT 4 and CEM cells. Investigations of HIV- 1 U 5 / 603 del particles revealed a <b>packaging</b> <b>defect</b> resulting in a 10 -fold reduction of encapsidated genomic RNA. The HIV- 1 U 5 / 604 del mutant either was noninfectious or exhibited delayed infection kinetics, depending on the cell type and multiplicity of infection. Quantitative competitive PCR indicated that HIV- 1 U 5 / 604 del synthesized normal amounts of viral DNA in newly infected cells. During the course of a long-term infectivity assay, a revertant of the HIV- 1 U 5 / 604 del mutant that displayed rapid infection kinetics emerged. Nucleotide sequence analysis indicated that the original 26 -nucleotide deletion present in HIV- 1 U 5 / 604 del had been extended an additional 19 nucleotides in the revertant virus. Characterization of the HIV- 1 U 5 / 604 del mutant LTR in in vitro integration reactions revealed defective 3 ' processing and strand transfer activities that were partially restored when the revertant LTR substrate was used, suggesting that the reversion corrected a similar defect in the mutant virus...|$|E

To {{understand the nature}} of the <b>packaging</b> <b>defect,</b> the interaction of the cohesive end site (cos) specific for phage 21 (cos phi 21) with phage lambda terminase has been investigated. The ability of lambda terminase to cleave cos phi 21 was studied in vitro; lambda terminase cleaved cos phi 21 only 1 % as well as it cleaved the phage lambda cohesive end site (cos lambda). In vitro packaging experiments showed that the lambda and 21 packaging specificities observed in vivo are also found in vitro. The cos cleavage reaction was modified so that competition experiments could be performed; these experiments showed that cos phi 21 was unable to bind lambda terminase, thus identifying the nature of the defect. Previous work [Feiss, M., Fisher, R. A., Siegele, D. A., Nichols, B. P. & Donelson, J. E. (1979) Virology 92, 56 [...] 67] has shown that the base pairs giving lambda or 21 packaging specificity are at the left end of the chromosome, outside the 22 -base-pair symmetry region that includes the annealed cohesive ends. Therefore, terminase binding to cos requires interactions with base pairs to the Nu 1 side of the cohesive end symmetry segment. The evidence supports the proposition that cos consists of adjacent sites for binding of terminase and for nicking by terminase. Because cos phi 21 can be cut by lambda terminase to terminate DNA packaging, it is proposed that the terminase that binds and nicks at the initial cos site is brought into contact with the terminal cos site by the packaging process. Terminase recognizes and nicks the cohesive end sequence of the terminal cos without requiring the binding site...|$|E
40|$|The Chromatin Accessibility Complex (CHRAC) {{consists}} of the ATPase ISWI, the large ACF 1 subunit {{and a pair of}} small histone-like proteins, CHRAC- 14 / 16. CHRAC is a prototypical nucleosome sliding factor that mobilizes nucleosomes to improve the regularity and integrity of the chromatin fiber. This may facilitate the formation of repressive chromatin. Expression of the signature subunit ACF 1 is restricted during embryonic development, but remains high in primordial germ cells. Therefore, we explored roles for ACF 1 during Drosophila oogenesis. ACF 1 is expressed in somatic and germline cells, with notable enrichment in germline stem cells and oocytes. The asymmetrical localization of ACF 1 to these cells depends on the transport of the Acf 1 mRNA by the Bicaudal-D/Egalitarian complex. Loss of ACF 1 function in the novel Acf 1 (7) allele leads to defective egg chambers and their elimination through apoptosis. In addition, we find a variety of unusual 16 -cell cyst packaging phenotypes in the previously known Acf 1 (1) allele, with a striking prevalence of egg chambers with two functional oocytes at opposite poles. Surprisingly, we found that the Acf 1 (1) deletion - despite disruption of the Acf 1 reading frame - expresses low levels of a PHD-bromodomain module from the C-terminus of ACF 1 that becomes enriched in oocytes. Expression of this module from the Acf 1 genomic locus leads to <b>packaging</b> <b>defects</b> in the absence of functional ACF 1, suggesting competitive interactions with unknown target molecules. Remarkably, a two-fold overexpression of CHRAC (ACF 1 and CHRAC- 16) leads to increased apoptosis and <b>packaging</b> <b>defects.</b> Evidently, finely tuned CHRAC levels are required for proper oogenesis...|$|R

40|$|The RNA {{packaging}} process for retroviruses involves a recognition {{event of the}} genome-length viral RNA by the viral Gag polyprotein precursor (PrGag), {{an important step in}} particle morphogenesis. The mechanism underlying this genome recognition event for most retroviruses is thought to involve an interaction between the nucleocapsid (NC) domain of PrGag and stable RNA secondary structures that form the RNA packaging signal. Presently, there is limited information regarding PrGag-RNA interactions involved in RNA packaging for the deltaretroviruses, which include bovine leukemia virus (BLV) and human T-cell leukemia virus types 1 and 2 (HTLV- 1 and - 2, respectively). To address this, alanine-scanning mutagenesis of BLV PrGag was done with a virus-like particle (VLP) system. As predicted, mutagenesis of conserved basic residues as well as residues of the zinc finger domains in the BLV NC domain of PrGag revealed residues that led to a reduction in viral RNA packaging. Interestingly, when conserved basic residues in the BLV MA domain of PrGag were mutated to alanine or glycine, but not when mutated to another basic residue, reductions in viral RNA packaging were also observed. The ability of PrGag to be targeted to the cell membrane was not affected by these mutations in MA, indicating that PrGag membrane targeting was not associated with the reduction in RNA packaging. These observations indicate that these basic residues in the MA domain of PrGag influence RNA packaging, without influencing Gag membrane localization. It was further observed that (i) a MA/NC double mutant had a more severe RNA <b>packaging</b> <b>defect</b> than either mutant alone, and (ii) RNA packaging was not found to be associated with transient localization of Gag in the nucleus. In summary, this report provides the first direct evidence for the involvement of both the BLV MA and NC domains of PrGag in viral RNA packaging...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{cellular}} cytidine deaminase APOBEC 3 G (A 3 G), when {{incorporated into}} the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1), renders viral particles non-infectious. We previously observed that mutation of a single cysteine residue of A 3 G (C 100 S) inhibited A 3 G packaging. In addition, several recent studies showed that mutation of tryptophan 127 (W 127) and tyrosine 124 (Y 124) inhibited A 3 G encapsidation suggesting that the N-terminal CDA constitutes a viral packaging signal in A 3 G. It was also reported that W 127 and Y 124 affect A 3 G oligomerization. Results Here we studied the mechanistic basis of the <b>packaging</b> <b>defect</b> of A 3 G W 127 A and Y 124 A mutants. Interestingly, cell fractionation studies revealed {{a strong correlation between}} encapsidation, lipid raft association, and genomic RNA binding of A 3 G. Surprisingly, the presence of a C-terminal epitope tag affected lipid raft association and encapsidation of the A 3 G W 127 A mutant but had no effect on wt A 3 G encapsidation, lipid raft association, and interaction with viral genomic RNA. Mutation of Y 124 abolished A 3 G encapsidation irrespective of {{the presence or absence of}} an epitope tag. Contrasting a recent report, our co-immunoprecipitation studies failed to reveal a correlation between A 3 G oligomerization and A 3 G encapsidation. In fact, our W 127 A and Y 124 A mutants both retained the ability to oligomerize. Conclusion Our results confirm that W 127 and Y 124 residues in A 3 G are important for encapsidation into HIV- 1 virions and our data establish a novel correlation between genomic RNA binding, lipid raft association, and viral packaging of A 3 G. In contrast, we were unable to confirm a role of W 127 and Y 124 in A 3 G oligomerization and we thus failed to confirm a correlation between A 3 G oligomerization and virus encapsidation. </p...|$|E
40|$|The linear {{double-stranded}} DNA {{molecules in}} lambda virions are generated by nicking of concatemeric intracellular DNA by terminase, the lambda DNA packaging enzyme. Staggered nicks are introduced at cosN {{to generate the}} cohesive ends of virion DNA. After nicking, the cohesive ends are separated by terminase; terminase bound to the left end of the DNA to be packaged then binds the empty protein shell, i. e., the prohead, and translocation of DNA into the prohead occurs. cosB, a site adjacent to cosN, is a terminase binding site. cosB facilitates the rate and fidelity of the cosN cleavage reaction by serving as an anchoring point for gpNu 1, the small subunit of terminase. cosB is also crucial {{for the formation of}} a stable terminase-DNA complex, called complex I, formed after cosN cleavage. The role of complex I is to bind the prohead. Mutations in cosB affect both cosB functions, causing mild defects in cosN cleavage and severe packaging defects.

40|$|The adeno-associated viruses (AAV) are {{promising}} therapeutic gene delivery vectors and {{better understanding of}} their capsid assembly and genome packaging mechanism is needed for improved vector production. Empty AAV capsids assemble in the nucleus prior to genome packaging by virally encoded Rep proteins. To elucidate the capsid determinants of this process, structural differences between wild-type (wt) AAV 2 and a packaging deficient variant, AAV 2 -R 432 A, were examined using cryo-electron microscopy and three-dimensional image reconstruction both at an similar to 5. 0 -angstrom resolution (medium) and also at 3. 8 - and resolutions (high), respectively. The high resolution structures showed that removal of the arginine side chain in AAV 2 -R 432 A eliminated hydrogen bonding interactions, resulting in altered intramolecular and intermolecular interactions propagated from under the 3 -fold axis toward the 5 -fold channel. Consistent with these observations, differential scanning calorimetry showed an similar to 10 degrees C decrease in thermal stability for AAV 2 -R 432 A compared to wt-AAV 2. In addition, the medium resolution structures revealed differences in the juxtaposition of the less ordered, N-terminal region of their capsid proteins, VP 1 / 2 / 3. A structural rearrangement in AAV 2 -R 432 A repositioned the beta A strand region under the icosahedral 2 -fold axis rather than antiparallel to the beta B strand, eliminating many intramolecular interactions. Thus, a single amino acid substitution can significantly alter the AAV capsid integrity {{to the extent of}} reducing its stability and possibly rendering it unable to tolerate the stress of genome packaging. Furthermore, the data show that the 2 -, 3 -, and 5 -fold regions of the capsid contributed to producing the <b>packaging</b> <b>defect</b> and highlight a tight connection between the entire capsid in maintaining packaging efficiency. IMPORTANCE The mechanism of AAV genome packaging is still poorly understood, particularly with respect to the capsid determinants of the required capsid-Rep interaction. Understanding this mechanism may aid in the improvement of AAV packaging efficiency, which is currently similar to 1 : 10 (10 %) genome packaged to empty capsid in vector preparations. This report identifies regions of the AAV capsid that play roles in genome packaging and that may be important for Rep recognition. It also demonstrates the need to maintain capsid stability for the success of this process. This information is important for efforts to improve AAV genome packaging and will also inform the engineering of AAV capsid variants for improved tropism, specific tissue targeting, and host antibody escape by defining amino acids that cannot be altered without detriment to infectious vector production...|$|E

Moreover, hardness measured as Durofel- 25 units is closely related to rebound distance. Softness thresholds have been addressed for both hardness parameters with devoted logistic models, permitting correct segregation (with 95 % of well-classified individuals) of all soft olives (over-ripe and fish eye) using the rebound drum...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{interaction}} between brome mosaic virus (BMV) coat protein (CP) and viral RNA is a carefully orchestrated process {{resulting in the}} formation of homogeneous population of infectious virions with T= 3 symmetry. Expression in vivo of either wild type or mutant BMV CP through homologous replication never results in the assembly of aberrant particles. In this study, we report that deletion of amino acid residues 41 – 47 from the N-proximal region of BMV CP resulted in the assembly of polymorphic virions in vivo. Purified virions from symptomatic leaves remain non-infectious and Northern blot analysis of virion RNA displayed <b>packaging</b> <b>defects.</b> Biochemical characterization of variant CP by circular dichroism and MALDI-TOF, respectively, revealed that the engineered deletion affected the protein structure and capsid dynamics. Most significantly, CP subunits dissociated from polymorphic virions are incompetent for in vitro reassembly. Based on these observations, we propose a chaperon-mediated mechanism for the assembly of variant CP in vivo and also hypothesize that 41 KAIKAIA 47 N-proximal peptide functions as a molecular switch in regulating T= 3 virion symmetry...|$|R
40|$|The {{probability}} of a particle penetrating a <b>defect</b> in a <b>package</b> {{is a function of}} the particle and defect size as well as the flow rate through the defect. Equations describing particle motion in an air stream are used to estimate the {{probability of}} particles penetrating a <b>package</b> <b>defect,</b> and these results are compared with experimental data. The range of pressure differentials experienced during the shipment of sterile devices is examined and the overall significance of pinholes in sterile packaging is discussed. Background Information Over the last 20 years many studies have been performed to determine the effect of pinholes on the microbial barrier characteristics of various package designs. These studies have been prompted by the proliferation of prepared packaged foods and the increased awareness of the threat of microbial contamination of medical instruments. These tests have been performed using a wide range of protocols and the results have been contradictory. Some laboratory tests have shown that sub-micron holes will allow contamination, while studies of commercial packages with holes larger than 10 µm wer...|$|R
40|$|The bachelor?s thesis {{topic is}} ?Possibilties {{of the use}} of an {{automated}} warehouse in a chosen food processing company?. It focuses on the present functioning of the automated warehouse in Budějovický Budvar, n. p. The solution of the problem of 5 % rejected products into the automated warehouse due to <b>packaging</b> <b>defects</b> was proposed on the basis of discovered facts. The proposed system of the solution succeeded to eliminate the problem of 5 % of rejected products into the automated warehouse. The most suitable alternative was chosen on the ground of the cost analysis of the particular solutions. It is necessary to ensure the possibly highest quality of the performed work in the phase of packaging due to increasing wage costs and the need of the company to effectively handle the costs in the future. Only adequate controlling can ensure it. Currently, the packaging quality control is set to the moment of receiving the products into the automated warehouse. In this way, the defect cannot be eliminated on time, it can only be notified. The solution informs {{about the possibility of a}} defect in time when it can be eliminated easily and without additional costs right by its origin. The shift of the control to the packaging phase depends only on time and on the amount of additional cost for the control launch compared to the costs of the repeated packaging...|$|R
40|$|Wafer level polymer {{packaging}} for MEMS is {{a cost-effective}} {{approach that is}} also compatible with microelectronic packaging technologies. However, polymer packages are not hermetic and cannot be used for MEMS devices, which usually demand vacuum or low moisture environment inside the packages. This problem can be solved by applying atomic layer deposition (ALD) of nano-scaled Al 2 O 3 or other inorganic materials over the polymer <b>packages.</b> <b>Defects</b> and mechanical cracks in ALD coatings are major concerns for hermetic/vacuum sealing. Several techniques {{have been developed to}} inspect such defects and cracks. Assisted by the electroplating copper technique, we have reduced the defect density by 1000 times for an ultra-thin, 2 -nm ALD Al 2 O 3 film. Such an ultra-thin coating is essential to enhance coating’s mechanical toughness. The toughness is usually determined by monitoring coating’s crack initiation and growth in a bending test. A real-time, non-destructive inspection technique has been developed for in-situ characterization of an ALD film coated on a surface or buried in a multilayer structure. With the knowledge and technology established, we have successfully demonstrated a wafer-level polymer packaging process for MEMS using a Pirani gauge as the vacuum sensor. The leak rate through the polymer package has been reduced by 100 times by the ALD Al 2 O 3 coating. More importantly, we have developed models and identified issues that are critical to ALD-enabled wafer level polymer packaging for MEMS...|$|R
40|$|In {{mouse and}} man Y {{chromosome}} deletions are frequently associated with spermatogenic defects. Mice with extensive deletions of non-pairing Y chromosome long arm (NPYq) are infertile and produce sperm with grossly misshapen heads, abnormal chromatin packaging and DNA damage. The NPYq-encoded multi-copy gene Sly controls {{the expression of}} sex chromosome genes after meiosis and Sly deficiency results in a remarkable upregulation of sex chromosome genes. Sly deficiency {{has been shown to}} be the underlying cause of the sperm head anomalies and infertility associated with NPYq gene loss, but it was not known whether it recapitulates sperm DNA damage phenotype. We produced and examined mice with transgenically (RNAi) silenced Sly and demonstrated that these mice have increased incidence of sperm with DNA damage and poorly condensed and insufficiently protaminated chromatin. We also investigated the contribution of each of the two Sly-encoded transcript variants and noted that the phenotype was only observed when both variants were knocked down, and that the phenotype was intermediate in severity compared with mice with severe NPYq deficiency. Our data demonstrate that Sly deficiency is responsible for the sperm DNA damage/chromatin <b>packaging</b> <b>defects</b> observed in mice with NPYq deletions and point to SLY proteins involvement in chromatin reprogramming during spermiogenesis, probably through their effect on the post-meiotic expression of spermiogenic genes. Considering the importance of the sperm epigenome for embryonic and fetal development and the possibility of its inter-generational transmission, our results are important for future investigations of the molecular mechanisms of this biologically and clinically important process...|$|R

40|$|For polyomaviruses, calcium ions {{are known}} to be {{essential}} for virion integrity and for the assembly of capsid structures. To define the role of calcium ions in the life cycle of the virus, we analyzed simian virus 40 (SV 40) mutants in which structurally deduced calcium-binding amino acids of Vp 1 were mutated singly and in combination. Our study provides evidence that calcium ions mediate not only virion assembly but also the initial infection processes of cell entry and nuclear entry. Mutations at Glu 48, Glu 157, Glu 160, Glu 216, and/or Glu 330 are correlated with different extents of <b>packaging</b> <b>defects.</b> The low <b>packaging</b> ability of mutant E 216 R suggests the need to position the Glu 216 side chain for proper virion formation. All other mutants selected for further analysis produced virus-like particles (VLPs) but were poorly infectious. The VLPs of mutant E 330 K could not attach to or enter the cell, and mutant E 157 A-E 160 A and E 216 K VLPs entered the cell but failed to enter the nucleus, apparently as a result of premature VLP dissociation. Our results show that five of the seven acidic side chains at the two calcium-binding sites—Glu 48 and Glu 330 (site 1), Glu 157 and Glu 160 (site 2), and Glu 216 (both sites) —are important for SV 40 infection. We propose that calcium coordination imparts not only stability but also structural flexibility to the virion, allowing the acquisition or loss of the ion at the two sites to control virion formation in the nucleus, as well as virion structural alterations at the cell surface and in the cytoplasm early during infection...|$|R
30|$|Martensitic transformations are {{the ones}} that most {{significantly}} affect the diffusion properties of interstitials and substitution atoms since during their course in the initial phase of metastable alloys, the dislocation density increases considerably and additional subboundaries are formed. These changes and the formation of a specific structural state of an alloy are able to increase significantly (by orders) the diffusion mobility of atoms at temperatures below 0.5 of melting point. In iron-nickel alloys, γ-α-γ transformations are obtained with face-centered cubic (f.c.c.)-body-centered cubic (b.c.c.)-f.c.c. structure rebuilding, whereas in ferromanganese alloys one gets γ-ϵ-γ and γ-ϵ′-γ transformations with f.c.c.-hexagonal close-packed (h.c.p.)-f.c.c. and f.c.c.- 18 -layer rhombic (18 R)-f.c.c. structure rebuilding[15], respectively. In our study, dislocation density in the reverted austenite increased by more than three orders as the result of multiple γ-α-γ transformations. After γ-ϵ-γ transformations dislocation density increased not more than by one order, and after γ-ϵ′-γ transformations, it remained practically unchanged. We associate this regularity with different volume effects of direct martensitic transformation. Such γ-α, γ-ϵ, and γ-ϵ′ transformations are accompanied by a specific volume increase, namely, by 3.4 %, 1.75 %, and 0.5 %, respectively. In the ferromanganese-reverted austenite, multiple γ-ϵ-γ transformations caused the accumulation of random packing defects, and γ-ϵ′-γ transformations remained at practically same numbers. In the case of multiple γ-α-γ transformations, under the generation of new dislocations during subsequent cycles and their accumulation and interaction, additional subboundaries arose, for example, through forming the walls of one-sign dislocations. Due to this process, highly dispersed disoriented fragments of reverted austenite were formed. The accumulation of <b>packaging</b> <b>defects</b> in ferromanganese alloys does not lead to the forming of additional subboundaries and fragmented structural elements. For these reasons, the greatest influence on diffusion characteristics of alloying elements among different types of martensitic transformations in alloys based on iron was the γ-α-γ transformations generating significant numbers of dislocations in the initial phase.|$|R
40|$|Human {{immunodeficiency}} type 1 (HIV- 1) {{bearing the}} nucleocapsid (NC) mutation R 10 A/K 11 A is replication defective. After serial {{passage of the}} mutant virus in tissue culture, we isolated a revertant that retained the original mutation. It had acquired, in addition, a new mutation (E 21 K) that was formally demonstrated to be sufficient for restoration of viral replication. Detailed analysis of the replication defect of R 10 A/K 11 A revealed a threefold reduction in virion yield and a fivefold reduction in packaging of viral genomic RNA. Real-time PCR was then used to quantitate viral DNA synthesis following infection of Jurkat T cells. After adjustment for the assembly and <b>packaging</b> <b>defects,</b> a minor (twofold) reduction in synthesis of either strong-stop, full-length linear DNA or 2 -LTR circles was observed with R 10 A/K 11 A virions, indicating that reverse transcription and nuclear transport of the viral genome were largely intact. However, after adjustment for the amounts of full-length or 2 -LTR circles produced, R 10 A/K 11 A virions were at least 10 -fold less infectious than wild type, indicating that viral DNA produced by the R 10 A/K 11 A mutant failed to integrate. Each of the above-mentioned defects was corrected by introduction of the second-site compensatory mutation E 21 K. These results demonstrate that the replication defect of mutant R 10 A/K 11 A {{can be explained by}} impairment at multiple steps in the viral life cycle, most important among them being integration and RNA packaging. The E 21 K mutation is predicted to restore positive charge to the face of the R 10 A/K 11 A mutant NC protein that interacts with the HIV- 1 SL 3 RNA stem-loop, emphasizing the importance of NC basic residues for HIV- 1 replication...|$|R
