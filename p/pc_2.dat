40|$|Methylmercury (MeHg) -resistant sublines of rat {{pheochromocytoma}} (<b>PC</b> 1 <b>2)</b> {{cells were}} isolated by repeated exposure to stepwise increased concentrations of MeHg. One of the sublines (<b>PC</b> 1 <b>2</b> /TM) showed an 8 - to 1 0 -fold increase in resistance to MeHg compared with parent <b>PC</b> 1 <b>2</b> cells {{on the basis}} of the concentration required for 50 % inhibition (IC 50) of growth. PC 12 /TM cells accumulated smaller amounts of MeHg than parent PC 12 cells. This reduction in MeHg accumulation in <b>PC</b> 1 <b>2</b> /TM cells resulted from slow uptake and rapid efflux. The intracellular glutathione (GSH) level in <b>PC</b> 1 <b>2</b> /TM cells was four times higher than that of <b>PC</b> 1 <b>2</b> cells. Pretreatment of <b>PC</b> 1 <b>2</b> /TM cells with buthionine sulfoximine, which decreased the GSH level to that of the parent <b>PC</b> 1 <b>2</b> cells, increased the sensitivity of <b>PC</b> 1 <b>2</b> /TM cells to MeHg. A close correlation between the MeHg accumulation and MeHg sensitivity was found among seven sublines of <b>PC</b> 1 <b>2</b> cells and parent <b>PC</b> 1 <b>2</b> cell line.

40|$|During {{screening}} of ethylmethane sulphonate-mutagenized pea (Pisum sativum L.) seedlings under far-red light a mutant line, AF 130, was isolated which showed {{a reduction in}} both red and far-red light-induced de-etiolation responses. The photomorphogenic phenotype of AF 130 results from a single recessive mutation which is not allelic with the previously described phytochrome chromophore biosynthesis mutant pcd 1. This new mutant has been designated <b>pcd</b> <b>2,</b> for phytochrome chromophore deficient <b>2.</b> Like <b>pcd</b> 1, etiolated <b>pcd</b> <b>2</b> seedlings are severely deficient in spectrally active phytochrome and contain wild-type levels of phytochrome A apoprotein which is not substantially depleted by red light treatment. Etioplast preparations from <b>pcd</b> <b>2</b> seedlings can metabolize heme to biliverdin (BV) IX?, but are unable to convert BV IX? to the phytochrome chromophore, phytochromobilin. The PCD 1 and PCD 2 genes therefore control consecutive steps in phytochromobilin synthesis. Despite a similarly severe impairment of photomorphogenic responses, <b>pcd</b> <b>2</b> mutant seedlings do not display the strongly chlorotic phenotype of pcd 1, suggesting that this characteristic of pcd 1 does not result from phytochrome deficiency per se, but is a specific effect of the pcd 1 mutation. A double mutant between pcd 1 and <b>pcd</b> <b>2</b> was constructed. This mutant is paler than pcd 1 and less responsive to red light than either single mutant, but retains a strong response to blue light. <br/...|$|R

By a combi- nation of electronic absorption spectra, Raman spectra at five excitation wave- lengths (532, 633, 647, 785 and 830 nm) and excitation profiles of H <b>2</b> <b>Pc</b> Raman spectral bands, the constitution of the three prepared hybrid sysems has been es- tablished in the following manner: Hybrid system I comprises probably a bilayer of H <b>2</b> <b>Pc</b> molecules, system VI approximately a monolayer of H <b>2</b> <b>Pc,</b> and system X a slightly reorganized monolayer of H <b>2</b> <b>Pc</b> molecules. Micro-Raman spectral map- ping of all three hybrid systems yielded H <b>2</b> <b>Pc</b> spectral bands (together with the SLG spectral bands) at all five excitation wavelengths. By contrast, for all three HOPG/H <b>2</b> <b>Pc</b> reference systems (HOPG = highly oriented pyrolytic graphite), prepared by the same procedure as the corresponding samples, H <b>2</b> <b>Pc</b> signal was detected only at 633 and 647 nm excitations.

40|$|There is {{considerable}} evidence linking the N <b>2</b> <b>pc</b> event-related lateralized response with processing of lateral visual targets, usually {{presented in the}} presence of visual distractors.

We present new evidence that is difficult to reconcile both with the distractor-suppression account of the N <b>2</b> <b>pc</b> (which predicts an increase in the amplitude of N <b>2</b> <b>pc</b> {{in the presence of}} distractors) and with the finding that N <b>2</b> <b>pc</b> is modulated by the distance between competing stimuli (N <b>2</b> <b>pc</b> is reduced as distance is reduced).

Attentional selection {{of an integrated}} percept and an actual singleton were examined.

Of note, the singleton N <b>2</b> <b>pc</b> developed and subsided earlier than the integration N <b>2</b> <b>pc.</b> The singleton P 3 seemed to develop in a single deflection, while the integration P 3 showed two more distinct deflections. Physical stimulus differences could not explain these results.
