40|$|In the new {{communication}} era, signal will be {{transmit to}} the receiver via wireless. However, the signal might be loss during the transmission. Therefore, the signal received at the receiver are totally not originally from the transmitter. In {{some cases the}} signal must be amplified. This project will focuses. {{on the concept of}} wireless optical in receiver communication system. The objectives of this project is to design a receiver amplifier using hybrid bandwidth enhancement in the approximately of Giga hertz range. The project involve developing a prototype of the designed receiver amplifier in PCB and to simulate the receiver amplifier using any existing electronic Software such as Micro-Cap, P-Spice and etc. The configuration of this design receiver is by using combination of bootstrapping and cascode technique. Bootstrapping technique offers the reduction on the photodetector capacitances which is the main limiting factor for the bandwidth of optical wireless front-end receiver. While, the cascode technique is used to arrange the electrical components such as transistor. The cascode is a two-stage amplifier composed of a transconductance amplifier followed by a current buffer. Compared to a single amplifier stage, this combination may have {{one or more of the}} following advantages: higher input-output isolation, higher input impedance, higher output impedance, higher gain or higher bandwidth. The achievement of this project, is using Bootstrap Amplifier with Double <b>Peaking</b> <b>Coil</b> has been designed and fabricated. The cut-off fiequency for this circuit is 400 MHz...|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} is presented which permits an enhanced frequency response for optical wireless receivers. A cascade bootstrap {{approach has been}} employed which has been combined with <b>coil</b> <b>peaking</b> to deliver a bandwidth improvement of around 7. 2 times in comparison with a conventional high impedance front end. A PIN photodiode {{has been used as}} the detector, and the technique improve on the limitations normally incurred because of device capacitance, stray capacitance, and also transit time effects. As an example of the application of the method. an initial 236 MHz bandwidth high impedance front-end configuration is shown to be capable of a bandwidth of 1. 7 GHz with the same gain. The noise penalty is compatible with the change in bandwidth. and not degraded by the bandwidth cubed factor which equalisation tends to produce for the same bandwidth extension...|$|R
