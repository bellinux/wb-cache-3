5|$|Neurolinguistics {{is closely}} related to the field of <b>psycholinguistics,</b> which seeks to {{elucidate}} the cognitive mechanisms of language by employing the traditional techniques of experimental psychology; today, psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic theories often inform one another, and there is much collaboration between the two fields.|$|E
5|$|The {{study on}} how {{language}} is represented, processed, and {{acquired by the}} brain is called neurolinguistics, which is a large multidisciplinary field drawing from cognitive neuroscience, cognitive linguistics, and <b>psycholinguistics.</b>|$|E
5|$|In his popular books, he {{has argued}} that the human faculty for {{language}} is an instinct, an innate behavior shaped by natural selection and adapted to our communication needs. He is the author of seven books for a general audience. Five of these, The Language Instinct (1994), How the Mind Works (1997), Words and Rules (2000), The Blank Slate (2002), and The Stuff of Thought (2007), describe aspects of the field of <b>psycholinguistics</b> and cognitive science, and include accounts of his own research. In the sixth book, The Better Angels of Our Nature (2011), Pinker makes the case that violence in human societies has, in general, steadily declined with time, and identifies six major causes of this decline. His seventh book, The Sense of Style (2014), is intended as a general style guide that is informed by modern science and psychology, offering advice on how to produce more comprehensible and unambiguous writing in nonfiction contexts and explaining why so much of today's academic and popular writing is difficult for readers to understand.|$|E

25|$|The tip of {{the tongue}} {{phenomenon}} has implications for research in <b>psycholinguistics,</b> memory, and metacognition.|$|E
25|$|Subdivisions in <b>psycholinguistics</b> {{are also}} made {{based on the}} {{different}} components that make up human language.|$|E
25|$|Phonetics and {{phonology}} {{are concerned}} with the study of speech sounds. Within <b>psycholinguistics,</b> research focuses on how the brain processes and understands these sounds.|$|E
25|$|The Max Planck Institute for <b>Psycholinguistics</b> (German: Max-Planck-Institut für Psycholinguistik; Dutch: Max Planck Instituut voor Psycholinguïstiek) is a {{research}} institute situated {{on the campus of}} Radboud University Nijmegen located in Nijmegen, Gelderland, the Netherlands. Founded in 1980, it is the only institution in the world entirely dedicated to <b>psycholinguistics,</b> and is also one of only three among a total of 90 within the Max Planck Society to be located outside Germany. The Nijmegen-based institute currently occupies 5th position in the Ranking Web of World Research Centers among all Max Planck institutes (7th by size, 4th by visibility). It currently employs about 135 people.|$|E
25|$|Two {{other major}} subfields of <b>psycholinguistics</b> {{investigate}} first language acquisition, {{the process by}} which infants acquire language, and second language acquisition. In addition, it is much more difficult for adults to acquire second languages than it is for infants to learn their first language (bilingual infants are able to learn both of their native languages easily). Thus, sensitive periods may exist during which language can be learned readily. A great deal of research in <b>psycholinguistics</b> focuses on how this ability develops and diminishes over time. It also {{seems to be the case}} that the more languages one knows, the easier it is to learn more.|$|E
25|$|<b>Psycholinguistics</b> views TOT {{states as}} a failure of {{retrieval}} from lexical memory (see Cohort Model) being cued by semantic memory (facts). Since there is an observed increase {{in the frequency of}} TOT states with age, there are two mechanisms within <b>psycholinguistics</b> that could account for the TOT phenomenon. The first is the degradation of lexical networks with age, where degrading connections between the priming of knowledge and vocabulary increases difficulty of successfully retrieving a word from memory. The second suggests that the culmination of knowledge, experience, and vocabulary with age results in a similar situation where many connections between a diverse vocabulary and diverse knowledge also increases the difficulty of successful retrieval of a word from memory.|$|E
25|$|There are {{a number}} of {{unanswered}} questions in <b>psycholinguistics,</b> such as whether the human ability to use syntax is based on innate mental structures or emerges from interaction with other humans, and whether some animals can be taught the syntax of human language.|$|E
25|$|<b>Psycholinguistics</b> is {{concerned}} with the nature of the computations and processes that the brain undergoes to comprehend and produce language. For example, the cohort model seeks to describe how words are retrieved from the mental lexicon when an individual hears or sees linguistic input.|$|E
25|$|In {{his work}} in <b>psycholinguistics,</b> Noam Chomsky {{describes}} an unvarying pattern of language acquisition in children and termed it the language acquisition device. He refers to 'universals' and a distinction is drawn between 'formal' and 'substantive' universals similar to that between archetype as such (structure) and archetypal image.|$|E
25|$|Neurolinguistics is {{the study}} of the {{structures}} in the human brain that underlie grammar and communication. Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in <b>psycholinguistics</b> and theoretical linguistics, and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and <b>psycholinguistics</b> propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language. Neurolinguists study the physiological mechanisms by which the brain processes information related to language, and evaluate linguistic and psycholinguistic theories, using aphasiology, brain imaging, electrophysiology, and computer modelling. Amongst the structures of the brain involved in the mechanisms of neurolinguistics, the cerebellum which contains the highest numbers of neurons has a major role in terms of predictions required to produce language.|$|E
25|$|<b>Psycholinguistics</b> or {{psychology}} of language {{is the study}} of the psychological and neurobiological factors that enable humans to acquire, use, comprehend and produce language. The discipline is mainly concerned with the mechanisms in which languages are processed and represented in the brain. Initial forays into <b>psycholinguistics</b> were largely philosophical or educational schools of thought, due mainly to their location in departments other than applied sciences (e.g., cohesive data on how the human brain functioned). Modern research makes use of biology, neuroscience, cognitive science, linguistics, and information science to study how the brain processes language, and less so the known processes of social sciences, human development, communication theories and infant development, among others. There are a number of subdisciplines with non-invasive techniques for studying the neurological workings of the brain; for example, neurolinguistics has become a field in its own right.|$|E
25|$|Newer, {{non-invasive}} techniques {{now include}} brain imaging by {{positron emission tomography}} (PET); {{functional magnetic resonance imaging}} (fMRI); event-related potentials (ERPs) in electroencephalography (EEG) and magnetoencephalography (MEG); and transcranial magnetic stimulation (TMS). Brain imaging techniques vary in their spatial and temporal resolutions (fMRI has a resolution of a few thousand neurons per pixel, and ERP has millisecond accuracy). Each type of methodology presents a set of advantages and disadvantages for studying a particular problem in <b>psycholinguistics.</b>|$|E
25|$|James Paul Gee {{was born}} in San José, California. He {{received}} his B.A. in philosophy from the University of California at Santa Barbara and both his M.A. and Ph.D in linguistics from Stanford University. He started his career in theoretical linguistics, working in syntactic and semantic theory, and taught initially at Stanford University {{and later in the}} School of Language and Communication at Hampshire College in Amherst, Massachusetts. After doing some research in <b>psycholinguistics</b> at Northeastern University in Boston and at the Max Planck Institute for <b>Psycholinguistics</b> in the Netherlands, Prof. Gee's research focus switched to studies on discourse analysis, sociolinguistics, and applications of linguistics to literacy and education. He went on to teach in the School of Education at Boston University, where he was the chair of the Department of Developmental Studies and Counseling, and later in the Linguistics Department at the University of Southern California. At Boston University he established new graduate programs centered around an integrated approach to language and literacy, combining programs in reading, writing, bilingual education, ESL, and applied linguistics. From 1993 to 1997 he held the Jacob Hiatt Chair in Education in the Hiatt Center for Urban Education at Clark University in Massachusetts. From 1997 until 2007, he held the Tashia Morgridge Professor of Reading at the University of Wisconsin–Madison.|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to being entertaining stories or important myths {{about the nature of}} the world, narratives also convey the importance of aboriginal environmental management knowledge such as fish spawning cycles in local rivers or the disappearance of grizzly bears from Oregon. Hymes believes that all narratives in the world are organized around implicit principles of form which convey important knowledge and ways of thinking and of viewing the world. He argues that understanding narratives will lead to a fuller understanding of the language itself and those fields informed by storytelling, in which he includes ethnopoetics, sociolinguistics, <b>psycholinguistics,</b> rhetoric, semiotics, pragmatics, narrative inquiry and literary criticism.|$|E
25|$|The {{institute}} {{specializes in}} language comprehension, language production, language acquisition, language and genetics, and {{the relation between}} language and cognition. Its mission is to undertake basic research into the psychological,social and biological foundations of language. The goal is to understand how human minds and brains process language, how language interacts with other aspects of mind, and how to learn languages of quite different types. The MPI for <b>Psycholinguistics</b> is a globally recognized center of linguistics and presents with its international archive of endangered languages {{a significant contribution to}} the preservation of the common heritage of mankind. This archive is sponsored since 2000 by the Volkswagen Foundation and offers on the internet about 50 projects.|$|E
25|$|Stylistics also {{involves}} {{the study of}} written, signed, or spoken discourse through varying speech communities, genres, and editorial or narrative formats in the mass media. In the 1960s, Jacques Derrida, for instance, further distinguished between speech and writing, by proposing that written language be studied as a linguistic medium of communication in itself. Palaeography is therefore the discipline that studies the evolution of written scripts (as signs and symbols) in language. The formal study of language also led {{to the growth of}} fields like <b>psycholinguistics,</b> which explores the representation and function of language in the mind; neurolinguistics, which studies language processing in the brain; biolinguistics, which studies the biology and evolution of language; and language acquisition, which investigates how children and adults acquire the knowledge of one or more languages.|$|E
25|$|Ten {{departments}} {{of the campus}} contain programs that award a Bachelor of Arts degree. The department of Anthropology offers interdisciplinary programs in health studies and {{on the subject of}} humanity. At the Department of Arts, Culture and Media, courses in visual and performing arts, new media, and journalism are taught. It {{is also one of the}} only two universities in Ontario that grants an undergraduate degree in arts management. The department of English provides study on English literature and film studies. Centre for Critical Development Studies offers both arts and science degree on international development issues. French and Linguistics offers courses in non-English languages, linguistics, and <b>psycholinguistics.</b> Department of Historical and Cultural Studies teaches African studies, classical studies, global Asia studies, history, religion, and women's studies. The department of Human Geography oversees programs in city studies, diaspora studies, physical and human geography. The department of philosophy offer programs in philosophy. Department of Political Science includes programs in political science and public policy. Department of Sociology offers courses in sociology and social science.|$|E
500|$|Neurolinguistics is {{the study}} of the neural {{mechanisms}} in the human brain that control the comprehension, production, and acquisition of language. As an interdisciplinary field, neurolinguistics draws methods and theories from fields such as neuroscience, linguistics, cognitive science, neurobiology, communication disorders, neuropsychology, and computer science. [...] Researchers are drawn to the field from a variety of backgrounds, bringing along a variety of experimental techniques as well as widely varying theoretical perspectives. Much work in neurolinguistics is informed by models in <b>psycholinguistics</b> and theoretical linguistics, and is focused on investigating how the brain can implement the processes that theoretical and <b>psycholinguistics</b> propose are necessary in producing and comprehending language.

500|$|In 1996 Penny Lee's reappraisal of Whorf's {{writings}} was published, reinstating Whorf as {{a serious}} and capable thinker. Lee argued that previous explorations of the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis had largely ignored Whorf's actual writings, and consequently asked questions very unlike those Whorf had asked. Also in that year a volume, [...] "Rethinking Linguistic Relativity" [...] edited by John J. Gumperz and Stephen C. Levinson gathered a range of researchers working in <b>psycholinguistics,</b> sociolinguistics and linguistic anthropology to bring renewed attention {{to the issue of}} how Whorf's theories could be updated, and a subsequent review of the new direction of the linguistic relativity paradigm cemented the development. Since then considerable empirical research into linguistic relativity has been carried out, especially at the Max Planck Institute for <b>Psycholinguistics</b> with scholarship motivating two edited volumes of linguistic relativity studies, and in American Institutions by scholars such as Lera Boroditsky and Dedre Gentner.|$|E
500|$|In <b>psycholinguistics,</b> Pinker {{became known}} {{early in his}} career for {{promoting}} computational learning theory as a way to understand language acquisition in children. He wrote a tutorial review of the field followed by two books that advanced his own theory of language acquisition, and a series of experiments on how children acquire the passive, dative, and locative constructions. These books were ...|$|E
500|$|Miller {{started his}} {{education}} focusing on speech and language and published papers on these topics, focusing on mathematical, computational and psychological {{aspects of the}} field. He started his career {{at a time when}} the reigning theory in psychology was behaviorism, which eschewed any attempt to study mental processes and focused only on observable behavior. Working mostly at Harvard University, MIT and Princeton University, Miller introduced experimental techniques to study the psychology of mental processes. [...] He went on to be one of the founders of <b>psycholinguistics</b> and was then one of the key figures in founding the broader new field of cognitive science, circa 1978. He collaborated and co-authored work with other figures in cognitive science and <b>psycholinguistics,</b> such as Noam Chomsky. For moving psychology into the realm of mental processes and for aligning that move with information theory, computation theory, and linguistics, Miller is considered one of the great twentieth-century psychologists. A Review of General Psychology survey, published in 2002, ranked Miller as the 20th most cited psychologist of that era.|$|E
500|$|According to Little, Rosenberg's {{early work}} with {{children}} with learning disabilities shows his interest in <b>psycholinguistics</b> and the power of language, as well as his emphasis on collaboration. In its initial development, the NVC model re-structured the pupil-teacher relationship to give students greater responsibility for, and decision-making related to, their own learning. The model has evolved over the years to incorporate institutional power relationships (i.e., police-citizen, boss-employee) and informal ones (i.e. man-woman, rich-poor, adult-youth, parent-child). The ultimate aim is to develop societal relationships based on a restorative, [...] "partnership" [...] paradigm and mutual respect, rather than a retributive, fear-based, [...] "domination" [...] paradigm.|$|E
500|$|In {{the late}} 20th century, {{interest}} in Whorf's ideas experienced a resurgence, {{and a new}} generation of scholars began reading Whorf's works, arguing that previous critiques had only engaged superficially with Whorf's actual ideas, or had attributed to him ideas he had never expressed. The field of linguistic relativity studies remains an active focus of research in <b>psycholinguistics</b> and linguistic anthropology, and continues to generate debate and controversy between proponents of relativism and proponents of universalism. By comparison, Whorf's other work in linguistics, the development of such concepts as the allophone and the cryptotype, and the formulation of [...] "Whorf's law" [...] in Uto-Aztecan historical linguistics, have met with broad acceptance.|$|E
500|$|George Armitage Miller (February 3, 1920 – July 22, 2012) was an American {{psychologist}} {{who was one}} of the founders of the cognitive psychology field. He also contributed to the birth of <b>psycholinguistics</b> and cognitive science in general. Miller wrote several books and directed the development of WordNet, an online word-linkage database usable by computer programs. He authored the paper, [...] "The Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two," [...] in which he insightfully observed that many different experimental findings considered together reveal the presence of an average limit of seven for human short-term memory capacity. This paper is frequently cited in both psychology and the wider culture. He also won awards, such as the National Medal of Science.|$|E
500|$|In <b>psycholinguistics</b> and neurolinguistics, priming {{refers to}} the {{phenomenon}} whereby a subject can recognize a word more quickly {{if he or she}} has recently been presented with a word that is similar in meaning or morphological makeup (i.e., composed of similar parts). If a subject is presented with a [...] "prime" [...] word such as doctor and then a [...] "target" [...] word such as nurse, if the subject has a faster-than-usual response time to nurse then the experimenter may assume that word nurse in the brain had already been accessed when the word doctor was accessed. Priming is used to investigate a wide variety of questions about how words are stored and retrieved in the brain and how structurally complex sentences are processed.|$|E
500|$|Pinker's {{academic}} specializations are visual cognition and <b>psycholinguistics.</b> His experimental subjects include mental imagery, shape recognition, visual attention, children's language development, {{regular and}} irregular phenomena in language, the neural bases {{of words and}} grammar, and the psychology of cooperation and communication, including euphemism, innuendo, emotional expression, and common knowledge. He has written two technical books that proposed a general theory of language acquisition and applied it to children's learning of verbs. In particular, his work with Alan Prince published in 1989 critiqued the connectionist model of how children acquire the past tense of English verbs, arguing instead that children use default rules such as adding [...] "-ed" [...] to make regular forms, sometimes in error, but are obliged to learn irregular forms one by one.|$|E
500|$|Empirical {{testing of}} the Whorfian {{hypothesis}} declined in the 1960s to 1980s as Noam Chomsky began to redefine linguistics and much of psychology in formal universalist terms. Several studies from that period refuted Whorf's hypothesis, demonstrating that linguistic diversity is a surface veneer that masks underlying universal cognitive principles. Many studies were highly critical and disparaging in their language, ridiculing Whorf's analyses and examples or his lack of an academic degree. Throughout the 1980s most mentions of Whorf or of the Sapir-Whorf hypotheses continued to be disparaging, {{and led to a}} widespread view that Whorf's ideas had been proven wrong. Because Whorf was treated so severely in the scholarship during those decades, he has been described as [...] "one of the prime whipping boys of introductory texts to linguistics". In the late 1980s, with the advent of cognitive linguistics and <b>psycholinguistics</b> some linguists sought to rehabilitate Whorf's reputation, as scholarship began to question whether earlier critiques of Whorf were justified.|$|E
500|$|Miller is {{considered}} one of the founders of <b>psycholinguistics,</b> which links language and cognition in psychology, to analyze how people use and create language. His 1951 book Language and Communication {{is considered}} seminal in the field. His later book, The Science of Words (1991) also focused on language psychology. He published papers along with Noam Chomsky on the mathematics and computational aspects of language and its syntax, two new areas of study. Miller also researched how people understood words and sentences, the same problem faced by artificial speech-recognition technology. [...] The book Plans and the Structure of Behavior (1960), written with Eugene Galanter and Karl H. Pribram, explored how humans plan and act, trying to extrapolate this to how a robot could be programmed to plan and do things. Miller is also known for coining Miller's Law: [...] "In order to understand what another person is saying, you must assume it is true and try to imagine what it could be true of".|$|E
500|$|The LSA holds a four-week {{biennial}} Linguistic Institute in {{the summer}} which includes talks and coursework on various aspects of linguistics. Considered by the membership {{to be one of}} the most important services of the LSA, the Institute has helped influence the development of the field through promotion of new directions such as <b>psycholinguistics</b> and sociolinguistics. Each Institute features a number of endowed Chairs named after prominent linguists: [...] the Sapir chair in general linguistics, [...] the Collitz Chair in historical linguistics, and since 2005, the Ken Hale chair in linguistic fieldwork and the preservation of endangered languages. The newest endowed professorship is named after the late LSA President Charles Fillmore. The LSA also endows a series of student fellowships, named after prominent linguists and family members. These include fellowships named for Ken Hale, James McCawley, Ivan Sag, and Julia Bloch. The Bloch fellow also serves a simultaneous appointment to the LSA's Executive Committee and as the Chair of its Student Committee. As of 2017, the LSA is planning for two additional fellowships, the first named after Charles Fillmore, and the second named after Yuki Koroda.|$|E
