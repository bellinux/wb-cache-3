The paper first reviews the context in which <b>proactive</b> <b>policies</b> that assist claimants to make paid employment the chosen route off benefit have grown in importance. Then, with reference to research on benefit dynamics conducted in Britain and elsewhere, the paper identifies the constraints which inhibit people from rapidly moving off benefit and {{that need to be addressed}} by active labour market policies. Focusing on recent policy developments in Britain, a range of proactive strategies are then considered before concluding that the dynamics of the labour market can be further exploited so as to enhance the targeting and effectiveness of welfare policies...|$|R

5000|$|Zavalishin became fearful the {{treaties}} made in 1824 and 1825 that delineated Russian America's borders would restrict the Empire from a <b>proactive</b> <b>policy</b> in North America.

Eventually Tsar Alexander echoed Nesselrode's position and refused to send Zavalishin back to California. The political upheaval of Alexander I's death and the subsequent Decembrist Uprising halted the considerations for an extensive commercial colonisation of California by the RAC. In 1853 Governor General N. N.

50|$|Often {{described}} in corporate governance or management theory as an agency problem, a corporation's managers {{are likely to}} overpay themselves because, directly or indirectly, {{they are allowed to}} pay themselves as a matter of general management power. Directors are elected to a board that has a fiduciary duty to protect the interests of the corporation. In large listed companies, executive compensation will usually be determined by a compensation committee composed of board members. Proponents argue that “say on pay” reforms strengthen the relationship between the board of directors and shareholders, ensuring that board members fulfill their fiduciary duty. http://millstein.som.yale.edu/Davis_Say_on_Pay_Policy_Briefing.pdf Critics of the policy believe that “say on pay” does not effectively or comprehensibly monitor compensation, and consider it to be reactionary policy rather than <b>proactive</b> <b>policy,</b> because it does not immediately affect the Board of Directors. Some argue it is counter-productive because it diminishes the authority of the Board of Directors. http://www.cfo.com/article.cfm/11485334/2/c_2984789 The effect of ‘say on pay’ measures can be binding or non-binding, depending on regulatory requirements or internal corporate policy as determined by proxy votes.|$|E

This research was conducted first by establishing a baseline as to what was U.

What was found was that there was a recommendation for a change of policy towards a more proactive approach to counter-terrorism. Then through looking at how the idea of a <b>proactive</b> <b>policy</b> shaped the new laws and bills, and reactions to terrorist incidents during the Reagan administration.

40|$|Just how {{influential}} is rainfall on {{agricultural production}} in the Sudan-Sahel of Africa? And, is there evidence that support for small-scale farming can reduce the vulnerability of crop yields to rainfall in these sensitive agro-ecological zones? These questions are explored based on a case study from Cameroon&# 8217;s Sudan-Sahel region. Climate data for 20 years and crop production data for six major food crops for the same years are used to find patterns of correlation over this time period. Results show a distinction of three periods of climatic influence of agriculture: one period before 1989, another between 1990 and 1999 and the last from 2000 to 2004. The analysis reveals that, while important in setting the enabling biophysical environment for food crop cultivation, the influence of rainfall in agriculture can be diluted by <b>proactive</b> <b>policies</b> that support food production. <b>Proactive</b> <b>policies</b> also reduce the impact of agriculturally relevant climatic shocks, such as droughts on food crop yields over the time-series. These findings emphasize the extent of vulnerability of food crop production to rainfall variations among small-holder farmers in these agro-ecological zones and reinforce the call for the proactive engagement of relevant institutions and support services in assisting the efforts of small-scale food producers in Africa&# 8217;s Sudan-Sahel.
