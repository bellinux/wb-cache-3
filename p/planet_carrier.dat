50|$|Shutting off {{the engine}} caused the {{transmission}} oil pressure to rapidly dissipate. If the selector lever was in reverse or moved to reverse after the engine stopped, two mechanical parts combined to provide a parking brake. The reverse unit ring gear was held stationary by the reverse anchor. The drive shaft could still turn causing the reverse unit sun gear and attached rear unit ring gear to rotate {{at a very high}} speed, {{were it not for the}} fact that the rear unit ring gear band was now applied by a heavy spring. Usually, bands are applied by a servo and released by spring pressure, but in this case, the band was held off by the servo and applied by spring pressure (actually, when the engine was running, the band was applied by a combination of spring pressure assisted by oil pressure). With the engine off, this brake band acting on the rear unit ring gear had a tremendous mechanical advantage. Since the rear unit ring gear with its attached reverse unit sun gear and the reverse unit ring gear were both locked to the transmission case, the <b>planet</b> <b>carriers</b> and driveshaft could not turn. As such, it provided an effective driveshaft mounted parking brake to be used alone or supplementing the hand brake.|$|R

Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Part K, Journal of Multi-body Dynamics, 231 (3), pp. 504 - 518. Copyright © 2017 Institution of Mechanical Engineers. Reprinted by permission of SAGE Publications. A planetary gearbox model comprising five spur gears (sun, ring and three <b>planets)</b> and the <b>carrier</b> has been developed and analysed. The influence of gear teeth backlash and friction during mixed regime of lubrication has been taken into consideration. Greenwood and Tripp model is employed, while viscous friction is calculated analytically using the functions of Evans and Johnson. A combined tribodynamics modeling approach has been implemented and modal analysis is performed in order to predict the coupled mechanism of tribological and dynamic behavior, subjected to backlash and excited at the gear meshing frequency. The software used for the simulations is ADAMS MSc (Student Edition), where the model variables (concerning gear geometry and forcing functions) have been added in a parametric way. The results showed that small variations of the dynamic transmission error affect notably the viscous friction through changing the contact load between the engaged teeth pairs. Also, higher values of the Stribeck oil parameter due to higher film thickness or lower surface roughness in the mixed lubrication regime lead to reduction of the boundary friction, whereas a reduction of the total generated friction occurs when increasing the angular velocity of the input gear body (due to higher film thickness and smaller asperity interactions). The above lead to reduced power loss of the mechanism. Finally, a characterization of the system dynamics is presented using the calculated eigenvalues and eigenmodes of the corresponding linearized system. Potential interactions with the gear meshing frequency of the system are also examined...|$|R
40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{describes the}} development of a methodology and modelling approach to lower the mechanical noise of the drive train of a modern wind turbine with a strong focus on the wind turbine gearbox. Although this mechanical noise is not the main noise source from a wind turbine, it could - especially when it contains audible tonal components - result in non-conformity to local noise regulations. This becomes more stringent when wind turbines are installed closer to urbanised areas. This research is motivated by inefficiencies in a cost and time consuming reactive trial and error approach to reduce or remove audible mechanical tonalities from the wind turbine noise. This dissertation focusses on the mechanical tonalities linked with the wind turbine gearbox. This mechanical noise originates from the interaction between the gears inside the gearbox, and then propagates directly airborne through the air or indirectly structure-born through the other wind turbine components to the outside. Two fundamental approaches exist to reduce or to remove a mechanical tonality. The first approach attempts to reduce the noise source by optimising the gears for low-noise. The second approach modifies the propagation path, also called transfer path from the source to the listener, such that the noise originating from the noise source is not amplified or even attenuated when it reaches the listener. The methodology proposed in this dissertation focusses on the second approach: using virtual prototyping models to assess and to optimise these transfer paths. The development of this methodology consists of 3 main parts: firstly individual components of the wind turbine gearbox are investigated in detail and if necessary experimentally validated. Secondly these individual components are assembled into a wind turbine gearbox model. The impact of these individual components on the global eigenmodes of the gearbox are investigated, and the model of the complete gearbox is experimentally validated by performing an experimental modal analysis. Lastly a model of two gearboxes on the end-of-line test rig is generated, investigated and also experimentally validated. This step-by-step approach, including the numerous experimental validation cases, resulted in a significant increase in both insight and confidence in the dynamic behaviour predicted by these virtual prototyping models. This dissertation demonstrates this methodology and modelling approach by performing two optimisation cases. The first optimisation case focusses on the impact of the bearings on the resulting vibrations. The second optimisation case modifies the flexible gearbox housing, which is considered the most dominant component, to shift an important eigenmode out of the operating range of the wind turbine. Both these optimisation cases clearly illustrate the potential of pro-actively using virtual simulation models to optimise the noise and vibration behaviour of the wind turbine gearbox during its design.

40|$|The topic {{addressed}} in this PhD thesis {{is the development of}} a rotational Lumped Parameter model to analyze the dynamic behavior of planetary gearbox. This model allows the study of the gearbox torsional vibrations. In particular, the study carried out in this thesis has focused on simple planetary trains, with three planets and an the outer fix ring. Therefore the following five rotational degree of freedom have been taken into account: the sun rotation, the rotation of the three <b>planets</b> and the <b>carrier</b> rotation. In {{the first part of the}} work, the attention has been focused on a correct description of the gearbox geometry (especially on the toothed wheels geometry) and on the operating characteristics, such as pressure angles and center to center distance. The definition of the geometry was then used for the development of a complex finite element model that, combined with an analytical formulation, allows to obtain the meshing stiffness, depending on the operating conditions of the gearbox. This meshing stiffness was used in the lumped parameter model to define the meshing forces, formed from an elastic component and from a viscous damping component. In addition to the meshing forces, the lumped parameter model considers the inertial actions and the external actions given by the driving torque and the resistant torque. From the simulation results it is possible to analyze the instantaneous angular velocity, the instantaneous angular acceleration of all wheels in different operating conditions, the variation of the meshing stiffness and the forces variations during the gearbox operations. The model is ready for an extension to the translational degrees of freedom, for which the formulation has already been developed. After having developed the entire model, some experimental tests were carried out in order to acquire the torsional vibratory signals of the gearbox unit studied. The tests were performed at different rotational speeds and with different torques applied. The experimental signals obtained have been used to validate the theoretical model. Overall, the research activity is scientifically relevant because it allows, through the development of a lumped parameter model, the study of torsional vibrations of planetary gear units. The model includes the most relevant dynamic phenomena involved in the gearbox, thus allowing the evaluation of the forces that mainly determine the vibrational signature of the studied gearbox. For this reason, the model can be considered a useful tool to support the design and prototyping, as it allows to identify the causes of undesirable dynamic effects and allows to evaluate the effect of any design changes on the dynamic behavior of the gearbox...|$|R

50|$|From 1939-1950, {{the reverse}} anchor {{was used to}} lock the reverse unit ring gear from turning by {{engaging}} external teeth machined into that ring gear.

This worked better as the anchor would not grind on the external teeth if that ring gear were turning (that is, unless the engine stalled as reverse was engaged). Reverse was obtained by applying torque from the front unit (band on, in reduction) through the fluid coupling to the rear unit sun gear. The <b>planet</b> <b>carrier</b> of this gearset was splined to the <b>planet</b> <b>carrier</b> of the reverse unit. The rear unit ring gear hub had a small gear machined on its end which served as the reverse unit sun gear. Because the rear unit band was not applied for reverse, the rear unit and reverse unit compounded causing the combined planet carriers to rotate opposite to the input torque and at a further reduced speed. The output shaft was machined onto the rear unit and reverse unit planet carriers.|$|E

50|$|Many {{cordless}} drills incorporate {{this type}} of torque limiter in a planetary gearset. It may {{be a part of}} an assembly of multiple gearsets used to primarily reduce speed and multiply torque as well as perform ratio changes. The torque limiter is typically the last gearset in the transmission. It uses the <b>planet</b> <b>carrier</b> as the input with the sun gear as the output, and the annulus normally locked. A series of ball detents act on the annulus to lock it, allowing power to be transmitted from the <b>planet</b> <b>carrier</b> to the sun gear. When the torque transmitted through the gearset reaches a determinate amount, the torque acting on the annulus causes it to unlock from its ball detents and freely rotate, causing power to be diverted from the load on the sun gear to the annulus and thereby stalling the output until torque is reduced to an amount where the ball detents can lock the annulus again. This system equally limits torque in both directions of rotation and also works with the sun gear as the input. The compression of the ball detents (and therefore the amount of torque at which the limiter is utilized) is typically adjusted by means of a rotating collar accessible to the user which is indexed and held in place with its own separate ball detents.|$|E

Depending on the implementation, the transmission in front of the epicyclic system may be greatly simplified, or eliminated completely.

The reasonable structure of a <b>planet</b> <b>carrier</b> should have some advantages including sufficient strength and rigidity, light weight, easy to machining and assembly, etc. The <b>planet</b> <b>carrier</b> can be of three common type double arm integral, one-arm assembly and one-arm.
