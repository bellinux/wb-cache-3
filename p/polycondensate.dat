40|$|Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania 15235, USA Titanium alkoxides {{hydrolyse}} vigorously {{with water}} producing <b>polycondensates</b> whose equivalent oxide content varies from ~ 70 % to over 90 %. This variation reflects the average molecular {{size and the}} nature of the terminal bonds. Hydrolysis conditions also affect the molecular and particle morphologies modifying the crystallization and sintering behaviour of oxide materials derived from <b>polycondensates.</b> It is also possible to form clear polymer solutions under excess water hydrolysis with the addition of certain acids. Investigations show that there is a window in the acid concentration which provides long-term solution stability. The gels formed from these clear solutions shrink in their liquor under certain conditions and the introduction of hydrogen peroxide into the liquor (surrounding the gel) causes vigorous gel shrinkage. 1. In t roduct ion The synthesis, chemistry and structure of metal alkoxides have been systematically investigated by chemists [1 - 4]. These compounds react vigorously with water, producing metal hydroxides or hydrated oxides. The reaction is often represented by the equation: M(OR), + I-I 20 ~ M(OH) n + nR(OH) (1) In reality, hydrolysis of titanium alkoxides is very complex.

40|$|For {{more than}} 30 years thin {{polyimide}} foils are produced at IRMM by in-situ polymerisation. The procedure {{consists of three}} steps, all performed under ambient conditions: preparation of a <b>polycondensate</b> solution used for foil forming by spreading on a glass plate, removal of the solvent by thermal treatment for four hours at 100 °C and final polymerisation at high temperature (350 °C). Recently modifications of this procedure including preparation in an argon atmosphere and elimination of the time-consuming solvent removal were applied. The influence of those modifications {{on the quality of}} the foils was studied by testing the mechanical and thermal properties and the lifetime of the foil under a charged projectile beam. The influence of the modifications on the characteristics an don the level of impurities in the foils is presented as well. The comparative studies of parameters were performed for foils with an areal density between 20 µg·cm- 2 and 80 µg·cm- 2. This work showed that the foils prepared by the new fast preparation way in a dry atmosphere have the best properties for nuclear physics applications. JRC. D. 2 -Reference material...|$|E
40|$|Lacquered metal wires have {{electrically}} insulating lacquer coat(s), {{at least one}} of which consists of an organically modified silica (hetero) <b>polycondensate</b> (I). (I) is obtained by (partial) hydrolytic condensation of compound(s) of silicon (Si) and optionally other element(s) selected from boron (B), aluminium (Al), phosphorus (P), tin (Sn), lead (Pb) and transition, lanthanide and actinide metals and/or precondensates derived from these compounds. Condensation is carried out with water and moisture, optionally {{in the presence of a}} catalyst and/or solvent. Also claimed is a method of producing the lacquered wires. USE - The lacquered wires are used for making coils or windings e. g. in electric motors or clocks (all claimed). ADVANTAGE - Lacquers based on polyimides and polyamides cannot always withstand the mechanical stress occurring especially in coil winding. Satisfactory flexibility is required, together with Increased adhesion and resistance to scratching, scraping and abrasion, e ven at relatively high temperatures, and there should be no harmful emissions on heating. Other requirements are fast cure and the use of no or non-toxic, non-corrosive solvent. The present lacquer cures rapidly, whilst its mechanical, thermal and electrical properties are better than usual. The required properties can be optimised for all or special applications...|$|E
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} fluorescent materials with a matrix based on silicic acid (hetero) polycondensates, with Er-> 3 + ions {{embedded in the}} matrix and, if necessary, other additives. Moreover, the invention relates {{to the production of}} these materials and their usage. The amount of Er-> 3 + ions is between 1 and 50 % by weight and the Er-> 3 + ions are fixed to nanoscale particles and/or complexed with one or several organic compounds which have at least one electron pair donor group. The nanoscale particles have diameters of <= 20 nm and the portion of nanoscale particles lies between 0 and 40 % by volume. The silicic acid (hetero) <b>polycondensate</b> is a hydrolytic (pre-) condensate of one or several hydrolytically condensatable compounds of silicon and, if necessary, of other elements from the group comprising B, Al, Ge, P, As, Sb, Sn, Pb of the transition metals, lanthanides and actinides, and/or of the above mentioned compounds of derived precondensates. 5 to 100 mole percent of the hydrol ytically (pre-) condensed compounds based on monomer compounds are derived from silanes of the general formula I, SiR<-a X<-b, in which residues R and X are equal or dissimilar and have the following meaning: R = alkyl, alkenyl, aryl, alkylaryl or arylalkyl, whereby these residues can be interrupted by oxygen or sulfur atoms or NH groups and/or spiro, oxiran, cyclical [...] ...|$|E
40|$|Molecular design, microstructure, and {{physical}} properties of polymers are {{strongly related to}} each other. A better understanding of their interdependence will give the polymer chemist useful ideas for the synthesis of new macromolecules. The present paper aims to compare the thermal behavior of aryl <b>polycondensates</b> based on ether, sulfone, and ketone links. Ultimately {{the objective is to}} design a new polymer combining, for example, the glass transition (T(g)) of poly(ether sulfone) s and the crystallinity of poly(ether ether ketone) s. By the use of a new concept the percentage of rigid chain length, it is demonstrated that one can predict T(g) and T(m) of poly(aryl ether ketone) s and T(g) of poly(aryl ether sulfone) s. The feasibility of crystalline poly(aryl ether sulfone) s is also discussed {{on the basis of the}} same principle. status: publishe...|$|R
