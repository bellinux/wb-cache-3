5000|$|Hopson v. Mayor and City Council of Baltimore (2005). In this widely cited 2005 opinion, Judge Grimm {{outlined}} a stop-gap formula that offered parties {{protection against the}} voluntary waiver of attorney-client privilege or attorney work <b>product</b> <b>protections</b> due to inadvertent production of ESI in the discovery process. In so doing, however, he highlighted the unmet need for a definitive legal rule that could provide more certain, uniform guidance on the waiver of those protections. Grimm’s opinion in Hopson played a direct role in the subsequent enactment in 2008 of the new Federal Rule of Evidence (FRE) 502, {{which was designed to}} bring more certainty and uniformity to the law of voluntary waivers of the attorney-client privilege or work <b>product</b> <b>protections</b> in both federal and state courts. (When outlining the purposes of the new rule in the notes to FRE 502, the Judicial Conference Advisory Committee on Evidence Rules explicitly cited the Hopson opinion and Judge Grimm’s concerns.) ...|$|R

30|$|As yet, {{far less}} data for {{biocides}} {{in the environment}} are available in comparison with plant <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> and pharmaceuticals. New data can create pressure on policy makers for {{a level playing field}} in, e.g., regulating biocides and plant <b>protection</b> <b>products</b> with equivalent <b>protection</b> goals. The Directive 2009 / 128 /EC on the “sustainable use of pesticides” [75] adopts an overarching approach to reduce the overall risks and impacts of pesticides on environment and health. The German Environment Ministry emphasized that new monitoring data for biocides can help to achieve a protection level comparable to the sustainable use law for plant <b>protection</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R

The box contains breeding substrate as well as populations of hosts and parasitoids and is placed directly in the storage site. A special outlet prevents hosts from leaving the box while freshly emerged parasitoids are released continuously over several months. A repeated shipment of wasps has thereby become obsolete...|$|R

50|$|There {{are also}} other devices, which can offer some helpful separation. These devices {{are known as}} Gloveboxes. Gloveboxes do not offer the separative control {{provisions}} of an isolator or RABS. Gloveboxes were originally designed for non-sterile product applications, such as weighing or manipulating a toxic drug and have a long track record for such non-sterile applications. Such gloveboxes can be very effective in preventing exposure of an operator to a toxic drug. In limited cases, {{they can also be}} used to protect a sterile product, when supplied with ISO 5 unidirectional air. However, in some notable cases, gloveboxes used for aseptic processing have provided no more sterile <b>product</b> <b>protection</b> than the traditional laminar air flow hood (LAF) design of the 1960s. In these cases, the glove boxes were problematic due to inappropriate design or controls (e.g., insufficient disinfection, transfer of contaminated materials, ingress of lower quality air into glovebox, poor design/integrity, poor transfers). However, if gloveboxes are very meticulously designed, thoroughly disinfected (e.g., using a sporadic) and carefully operated by well-trained aseptic processing personnel to prevent introduction of microbial contamination, it is possible to obtain some degree of increased sterile <b>product</b> <b>protection</b> versus the simple traditional LAF hood.|$|E
50|$|Corrugated {{boxes are}} used {{frequently}} as shipping containers. Boxes need {{to contain the}} product from manufacturing through distribution to sale and sometimes end-use. Boxes provide some measure of <b>product</b> <b>protection</b> by themselves but often require inner components such as cushioning, bracing and blocking to help protect fragile contents. The shipping hazards depend largely upon the particular logistics system being employed. For example, boxes unitized into a unit load on a pallet do not encounter individual handling while boxes sorted and shipped through part of their distribution cycle as mixed loads or express carriers can receive severe shocks, kicks, etc...|$|E
