40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the present study}} was to determine if the neurotropin receptors trkC and trkA are involved in embryonic testis development. These receptors bind neurotropin 3 and nerve growth factor, respectively. The hypothesis tested was that the absence of trkC or trkA receptors will have detrimental ef-fects on testis development and morphology. The trkA and trkC homozygote knockout (KO) mice generally die either at or shortly after birth. Therefore, heterozygote mice were mated to obtain homozygote gene KO mice at Embryonic Day (E) 13, E 14, E 17, and E 19 of gestation, with E 0 being the <b>plug</b> <b>date.</b> Gonads from approximately 80 embryos were collected and fixed, an...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} investigates the {{hypothesis}} that retinoids {{have a role in}} embryonic testis development. The action of retinoids on testis development and the expression of retinoic acid receptors (RAR�, RAR�, RAR�) were examined. In embryonic day 13 (E 13; <b>plug</b> <b>date</b> � E 0) testis organ cultures an RAR-selective agonist and alltrans retinoic acid completely inhibited seminiferous cord formation. In contrast, an RAR�-selective antagonist had no effect. RT-PCR demonstrated that RAR � messenger RNA (mRNA) was expressed at all developmental time points evaluated, which included embryonic day 14 (E 14) through postnatal day 30 (P 30). Expression of RAR� mRNA was present at E 15 through P 2, whereas RAR � mRNA was expressed at E 18 through P 2. Cellular localization of receptors by immunohistochemistry indicated that RAR � was localized to the interstitium at E 18 and to the seminiferous cords by P 0. RAR � an...|$|E
40|$|Morphological male sex {{determination}} {{is dependent on}} migration of endothelial and preperitubular cells from the adjacent mesonephros into the developing testis. Our hypothesis is that VEGFA and its receptor KDR are necessary for both testicular cord formation and neovascularization. The Vegfa gene has 8 exons with many splice variants. Vegfa 120, Vegfa 164, and Vegfa 188 mRNA isoforms were detected on Embryonic Day (E) 13. 5 (<b>plug</b> <b>date</b> = E 0) in the rat. Vegfa 120, Vegfa 144, Vegfa 164, Vegfa 188, and Vegfa 205 mRNA were detected at E 18 and Postnatal Day 3 (P 3). Kdr mRNA was present on E 13. 5, whereas Fms-like tyrosine kinase 1 receptor (Flt 1) mRNA was not detected until E 18. VEGFA protein was localized to Sertoli cells at cord formation and KDR to germ and interstitial cells. The VEGFA signaling inhibitors SU 1498 (40 μM) and VEGFR-TKI (8 μM) inhibited cord formation in E 13 testis cultures with 90...|$|E

40|$|The {{current study}} investigates the {{hypothesis}} that retinoids {{have a role in}} embryonic testis development. The action of retinoids on testis development and the expression of retinoic acid receptors (RARα, RARβ, RARγ) were examined. In embryonic day 13 (E 13; <b>plug</b> <b>date</b> 5 E 0) testis organ cultures an RAR-selective agonist and alltrans retinoic acid completely inhibited seminiferous cord formation. In contrast, an RARα-selective antagonist had no effect. RT-PCR demonstrated that RARα messenger RNA (mRNA) was expressed at all developmental time points evaluated, which included embryonic day 14 (E 14) through postnatal day 30 (P 30). Expression of RARβ mRNA was present at E 15 through P 2, whereas RARγ mRNA was expressed at E 18 through P 2. Cellular localization of receptors by immunohistochemistry indicated that RARα was localized to the interstitium at E 18 and to the seminiferous cords by P 0. RARβ and RARγ were detected in both interstitium and cords at E 16 and by E 18 were mainly expressed in the cords. At P 0 RARβ and RARγ were localized to the germ cell populations. To examine retinoid actions, the growth of P 0 testis cultures were investigated. Interestingly, retinol and retinoic acid did not inhibit growth of P 0 testis cultures but did inhibit the action of growth stimulators. Retinoic acid inhibited FSH, EGF, and 10 % calf serum stimulated growth in P 0 testis cultures. The hypothesis tested was that the inhibitory effects of retinoids on P 0 testis growth may be mediated through the growth inhibitor, transforming growth factor-b (TGFβ). The action of retinoids on TGFβ mRNA expression was examined in P 0 testis cultures. Retinoic acid stimulated TGFβ 3 mRNA expression within 24 h and increased expression of TGFβ 1 and TGFβ 2 after 72 h. Retinol increased expression of TGFβ 1 and TGFβ 2 but not TGFβ 3 after 72 h of treatment. These observations indicate that retinoic acid can influence seminiferous cord formation and testis growth. The inhibitory actions of retinoids may in part be mediated through increased expression of TGFβ isoforms...|$|E

Therefore, heterozygote mice were mated to obtain homozygote gene KO mice at Embryonic Day (E) 13, E 14, E 17, and E 19 of gestation, with E 0 being the <b>plug</b> <b>date.</b> Gonads from approximately 80 embryos were collected and fixed, and each embryo was genotyped. To determine gonadal characteristics for each genotype, the number of germ cells, number of seminiferous cords, seminiferous cord area, and interstitial area were calculated at each developmental age. Germ cell numbers varied in trkA gene KO mice from those of wild-type mice at each age evaluated. In trkC gene KO mice, differences were detected in germ cell numbers when compared to wild-type mice at E 17 and E 19. At E 19, germ cell numbers were reduced in both trkA and trkC gene KO mice when compared to wildtype animals. Apoptosis was evaluated in testes of wild-type, trkC gene KO, and trkA gene KO mice to determine if the alteration in germ cell numbers at each developmental age was influenced by different patterns of germ cell survival or apoptosis. No differences were found in germ cell apoptosis during embryonic testis development. Interestingly, trkA gene KO mice that survived to Postnatal Day 19 had a 10 -fold increase in germ cell apoptosis when compared to germ cells in wild-type mice. Evaluation of other morphological testis parameters demonstrated that trkC KO testes had reduced interstitial area at E 13, reduced number of seminiferous cords at E 14, and reduced seminiferous cord area at E 19. The trkA gene KO testes had a reduction in the number of seminiferous cords at E 14. Histology of both trkA and trkC gene KO testes demonstrated that these gonads appear to be developmentally delayed when compared to their wild-type testis counterparts at E 13 during testis development. The current study demonstrates that both trkA and trkC neurotropin receptors influence germ cell numbers during testis development and events such as seminiferous cord formation...|$|E
40|$|The {{current study}} was {{designed}} {{to examine the effects of}} a transient embryonic exposure to the pesticide methoxychlor, an endocrine disruptor, on in vivo rat testis development and function. Gestating female rats were transiently administered methoxychlor (MXC) from embryonic day 7 (E 7; EO = <b>plug</b> <b>date)</b> through E 15. Embryonic testes were collected at E 16 and postnatal (PO = day of birth) testes at P 4, P 10, P 17 – 20, and P 60. Seminiferous cords formed in testes from MXC exposed males. However, at E 16, there was a decrease in the area of cords and an increase in interstitial area in MXC exposed testes when compared with controls. At all postnatal ages collected, there did not appear to be differences in seminiferous cord/tubule area, interstitial area, or number of seminiferous cords/tubules between untreated controls and males exposed to MXC. Exposure to the endocrine disruptor also had no effect on the postnatal organ weights of a variety of different organs, nor were testosterone levels altered. Interestingly, there were reductions in the number of germ cells in testes from MXC-exposed males at P 17 –P 20 when compared with untreated controls. Furthermore, there was a twofold increase in apoptotic cells in tubules from pubertal P 17 –P 20 –MXC exposed males when compared with untreated controls. Testes were collected from adult P 60 males to determine if early embryonic and postnatal alterations in germ cell numbers or testis cellular composition had compromised spermatogenesis. In adult P 60 MXC exposed testes there were no gross morphological changes in testis structure or cellular composition over that of controls. However, there was an increase in apoptotic cell number in elongating spermatids in MXC exposed testes. Four P 60 males that were exposed to MXC during gestation and 4 control males were bred with unexposed females to determine their ability to produce offspring. All MXC exposed males were capable of impregnating females and had normal litter size and pup weights. Combined observations demonstrated that exposure to MXC during gestation at a critical stage of testis development (ie, sex determination) affects embryonic testis cellular composition, germ cell numbers, and germ cell survival. While alterations in these parameters does not affect the ability of males to produce offspring, there appears to be a reduced spermatogenic capacity associated with MXC treatment. Therefore, transient embryonic exposure to an endocrine disruptor (methoxychlor) during gestation can influence the germline and fertility in adult males...|$|E

50|$|However, {{a wealth}} of {{unreleased}} Plug material still existed, which would slowly find its way out in subsequent years.

30|$|Given that {{an effect}} {{is also found}} for {{relatively}} younger contracts, we worried {{that the effects of}} anticipation on the conversion rates of eligible workers could be found later than Period IV, which also does not include the beginning of a month. In extending the time period, there is a trade-off between the likelihood that the parallel trend assumptions still hold and the possibility that substitution effects take place later in time. We tried to balance the two by adding four subsequent periods of 16 -days, hence <b>plugging</b> in <b>dates</b> until January 21 st. The results are reassuring (see Additional file 1). Although the estimates for the interaction term with the last two periods is negative, these are due to different seasonal trends as they are also present in the falsification over 2011, with very similar magnitude and standard errors. Indeed, if we remove them by running a triple-difference regression, {{there is no evidence of}} an additional effect of the policy in any of the groups. Similar results hold with a “closed” sample of contracts signed before the policy was announced. These results on the following period are also important to address another concern: that the positive results in Period III may be explained by the progressive selection of the best-performing firms during the ongoing economic crisis. If this was true, we should find positive effects also in December 2012 and early January 2013.|$|R
25|$|Exposed {{within the}} {{interior}} of the Richat Structure are a variety of intrusive and extrusive igneous rocks. They include rhyolitic volcanic rocks, gabbros, carbonatites and kimberlites. The rhyolitic rocks consist of lava flows and hydrothermally altered tuffaceous rocks that are part of two distinct eruptive centers, which are interpreted to be the eroded remains of two maars. According to field mapping and aeromagnetic data, the gabbroic rocks form two concentric ring dikes. The inner ring dike is about 20m in width and lies about 3km from the center of Richat Structure. The outer ring dike is about 50m in width and lies about 7 to 8km from the center of this structure. Thirty-two carbonatite dikes and sills have been mapped within the Richat Structure. The dikes are generally about 300m long and typically 1 to 4m wide. They consist of massive carbonatites that are mostly devoid of vesicles. The carbonatite rocks have been dated as having cooled between 94 and 104million years ago. A kimberlitic plug and several sills have been found within {{the northern part of the}} Richat Structure. The kimberlite <b>plug</b> has been <b>dated</b> to around 99million years old. These intrusive igneous rocks are interpreted as indicating the presence of a large alkaline igneous intrusion that currently underlies the Richat Structure and created it by uplifting the overlying rock.|$|R

40|$|The Siuna terrane, defined {{here for}} the first time, is {{composed}} of slices of limey sedimentary strata, intermediate volcanic rock, serpentinite, and ultramafic cumulates, thrust together in the lower Upper Cretaceous. The terrane is intruded by intermediate dikes, <b>plugs</b> and plutons <b>dated</b> from 75 to 60 Ma, and is cut by Tertiary normal and strike-slip faults. The Siuna terrane volcanic and sedimentary strata probably formed in a Lower Cretaceous volcanic arc and associated back-arc or inter-arc basin. They host a Zn-Cu-Au volcanogenic massive sulfide occurrence and a Au-Cu skarn (the Siuna Mine), as well as several Au prospects. The serpentinite bodies host podiform chromite and disseminated Au occurrences. The Siuna terrane is distinct from the Chortis block to the north, and may have formed far from it. Evidence to date indicates that the low grade metamorphic "continental" basement of the Chortis block does not extend beneath the Siuna area. Isotopic evidence, as well as the presence of fragments of oceanic crust (serpentinite and ultramafic cumulates), indicate that the Siuna belt represents a fragment underlain by oceanic crust, appended to the Chortis block in the Upper Cretaceous; it may originally have been part of Greater Antilles Arc. The interpretation of the Siuna terrane presented here constitutes a significant departure from previous interpretations of the geology and tectonics history of the area...|$|R
