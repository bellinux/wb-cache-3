40|$|Meat lipid {{oxidation}} causes negative quality effects, {{especially in}} further processed products. Butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA), butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), and rosemary extract (RM) are common antioxidants, but plant-based tannin compounds {{have been shown}} to be effective antioxidants. The objective was to evaluate antioxidant effectiveness, pH, color, and sensory effects of several tannin sources. In study 1, 19 percent fat ground beef was mixed with no treatment (control), BHA/BHT (0. 02 percent), RM (0. 2 percent), or 0. 25 percent or 0. 5 percent powders of Chardonnay grapeseed (CG), Norton grapeseed (NG), CitruSmart (CS), or dried cherry (CP). Raw and cooked <b>patties</b> were aerobically stored for 0 to 5 days at 4 degrees C. Cooked <b>patties</b> were analyzed using the TBARS (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances) method. Raw <b>patties</b> were analyzed for pH, instrumental color, subjective color, and ingredient specks. Study 2 was similar, except the treatments were 0. 25 percent and 0. 5 percent powders of CG, chestnut (CN), mimosa (M), and quebracho (Q) tannins, as well as 0. 5 percent NG, 0. 02 percent BHA/BHT, 0. 2 percent RM, and a control. In study 1, only the NG and CG pre-cooked <b>patties</b> had similar or lower TBARS values compared to RM and BHA/BHT <b>patties.</b> All tannin treatments, except 0. 25 percent CG and 0. 25 percent CS, lowered pH compared to the control. <b>Patties</b> with NG and 0. 5 percent CG were darker, and tannin-treated <b>patties</b> were not redder than the control. <b>Patties</b> with CG and 0. 5 percent NG were less yellow. Subjectively, tannin-treated <b>patties</b> did not have less discoloration during storage, and the CG and NG <b>patties</b> had numerous visible ingredient specks. In study 2, CN, M, Q, and 0. 5 percent CG treated <b>patties</b> had low TBARS during storage. pH was slightly lower in CG and CN <b>patties</b> than the control. All tannin-treated <b>patties</b> were darker than the control <b>patties,</b> except <b>patties</b> containing 0. 25 percent CG and Q, and control <b>patties</b> had the highest red values. Tannin-treatments <b>patties,</b> except CN and Q <b>patties,</b> were less yellow. Subjectively, only 0. 25 percent M <b>patties</b> had less discoloration than control <b>patties,</b> while 0. 5 percent CN <b>patties</b> were more discolored. Norton and Chardonnay grapeseed flour and chesnut, mimosa, and quebracho powders would be recommended for pre-cooked ground beef <b>patties</b> based on their antioxidant effectiveness in these studies...|$|R
40|$|Due to the {{character}} of the original source materials and the nature of batch digitization, quality control issues may be present in this document. Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Properties of all-beef <b>patties</b> containing 20 % fat and low-fat (10 %) beef <b>patties</b> containing water, carrageenan, encapsulated salt, and hydrolyzed vegetable protein with no additional additives (control) or with sodium tripolyphosphate (STPP), sodium ascorbate (SA), sodium lactate (SL), STPP and SA, or SL and SA were compared. Control low-fat <b>patties</b> had lower cooking yields than high- fat <b>patties.</b> STPP and SL improved cooking yields. The control low-fat <b>patties</b> were harder and springier than the high-fat <b>patties</b> and the additional additives did not have significant effects (p> 0. 05) on the texture of low-fat <b>patties.</b> Precooked, oxygen-permeable polyvinylchloride (PVC) -wrapped low-fat control <b>patties</b> and high-fat control <b>patties</b> had similar values of 2 -thiobarbituric acid(TBA) -reactive substances after 6 days of refrigerated storage, but the low-fat control <b>patties</b> had better flavor than high-fat <b>patties</b> when either freshly cooked or stored. STPP was an effective antioxidant and was synergistic with SA as measured by TBA values on either a fat weight or sample weight basis and by sensory scores. SA alone reduced TBA values on either a fat weight or sample weight basis, but did not significantly improve flavor. SL reduced TBA values on a sample weight basis in refrigerated <b>patties,</b> regardless of packaging method, and in frozen, vacuum-packaged <b>patties,</b> but increased the values on a fat weight basis in frozen, PVC-wrapped <b>patties.</b> SL had no effect on TBA values on a sample weight basis of precooked, PVC-wrapped frozen <b>patties</b> or on TBA values on a fat weight basis of precooked, vacuum-packaged frozen <b>patties</b> or of precooked, PVC-wrapped refrigerated <b>patties.</b> SL did not improve flavor, but the combination of SA and SL improved sensory scores of stored <b>patties.</b> Control low-fat <b>patties</b> and high-fat <b>patties</b> did not have significantly different aerobic microbial plate counts. SL and SA both had antimicrobial effects, but STPP did not affect aerobic microbial counts. There was an increase in nonheme iron during refrigerated storage which was most pronounced in control low-fat <b>patties.</b> However, nonheme iron did not increase upon frozen storage...|$|R

In 200 g pork <b>patties</b> 0, 0. 5, 1 or 1. 5 % lemongrass was added and a reference control was prepared with 200 mg "-tocopherol acetate in 200 g pork <b>patties.</b> Results showed that raw pork <b>patties</b> with lemongrass had lower TBARS values {{than the control}} or "-tocopherol treated pork <b>patties.</b> Raw pork <b>patties</b> treated with any level of lemongrass had lower TBARS values than their cooked counterparts. Addition of 1. 5 % lemongrass was effective in reducing lipid oxidation in raw <b>patties</b> under refrigeration. Lemongrass can conveniently replace synthetic antioxidant such as BHA, BHT and TBHQ that consumers have worry for due to their health safety...|$|R

40|$|Bottom rounds {{were shipped}} to the Rosenthal Meat Science and Technology Center, ground and {{enhanced}} {{with one of the}} following predetermined treatments: control; 0. 4 % sodium phosphates and 0. 3 % salt; 0. 25 % sorghum bran; 2. 0 % sorghum bran; 0. 25 % sorghum bran, 0. 4 % sodium phosphates and 0. 3 % salt; and 2. 0 % sorghum bran, 0. 4 % sodium phosphates, and 0. 3 % salt. The ground beef was formed into 226 g ground beef <b>patties,</b> packaged in an 80 % O 2 and 20 % CO 2 gaseous environment, and stored under retail display at 4 degrees for 0, 3, 6, or 9 d. Measurements to determine rate and extent of oxidation, rate of discoloration, and sensory characteristics were taken {{to evaluate the effectiveness of}} sorghum bran. <b>Patties</b> containing the highest amount of sorghum bran had the lowest TBARS values over 9 days of storage, lower a* values, greater amounts of discoloration, darker lean color, and less cook loss (P< 0. 05) than control <b>patties.</b> <b>Patties</b> enhanced with the highest level of sorghum bran had lower beefy/brothy and bloody flavor aromatics, higher sorghum flavor, more bitter and burnt aftertaste, and more sandy/gritty textures (P< 0. 05) when compared to control <b>patties.</b> <b>Patties</b> containing the low amount of sorghum had lower TBARS values (P< 0. 05), but similar amounts of cook loss as the control <b>patties.</b> <b>Patties</b> containing a low sorghum level, 0. 4 % sodium phosphates (SP) and 0. 3 % salt (S) had lower (P< 0. 05) amounts of cook loss when compared to control <b>patties.</b> <b>Patties</b> containing low amounts of sorghum were similar to control <b>patties</b> in terms of redness while the addition of low sorghum, SP, and S decreased (P< 0. 05) the degree of redness. <b>Patties</b> containing low amounts of sorghum bran had similar amounts of discoloration compared to control (CONT) <b>patties.</b> Also, these had less bloody flavor aromatics (P< 0. 05), but were similar in sorghum flavor aromatics and bitter taste when compared to control <b>patties.</b> The addition of sorghum bran at low levels can retard oxidative rancidity in ground beef <b>patties</b> without causing detrimental color changes and negatively affecting sensory attributes, while <b>patties</b> enhanced with 2 % sorghum bran have extensive discoloration and undesirable sensory attributes...|$|R
