40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a routing problem variant which {{considers}} Customers to simultaneously require delivery and <b>pick-up</b> <b>services.</b> The examined problem {{is referred to as}} the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pick-ups and Deliveries (VRPSPD). VRPSPD is an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem, practical large-scale instances of which cannot be solved by exact solution methodologies within acceptable computational times. Our interest was therefore focused on metaheuristic solution approaches. In specific, we introduce an Adaptive Memory (AM) algorithmic framework which collects and combines promising solution features to generate high-quality solutions. The proposed strategy employs an innovative memory mechanism to systematically maximize the amount of routing information extracted from the AM, in order to drive the search towards diverse regions of the solution space. Our metaheuristic development was tested on numerous VRPSPD instances involving from 50 to 400 customers. It proved to be rather effective and efficient, as it produced high-quality solutions, requiring limited computational effort. Furthermore, it managed to produce several new best solutions.

Finally, comparing with genetic algorithm (GA) and particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm, the MCPSO algorithm performs best for solving this problem...|$|E

30|$|In reverse {{logistics}} networks, products (e.g., bottles or containers) {{have to be}} transported from a depot to customer locations and, after use, from customer locations back to the depot. In order to operate economically beneficial, companies prefer a simultaneous delivery and <b>pick-up</b> <b>service.</b> The resulting Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Delivery and Pick-up (VRPSDP) is an operational problem, which has to be solved daily by many companies. We present two mixed-integer linear model formulations for the VRPSDP, namely a vehicle-flow and a commodity-flow model. In order to strengthen the models, domain-reducing preprocessing techniques, and effective cutting planes are outlined. Symmetric benchmark instances known from the literature {{as well as new}} asymmetric instances derived from real-world problems are solved to optimality using CPLEX 12.1.|$|E

30|$|Flexibility in the {{transport}} {{of a variety of}} commodities will be necessary, if and when the White Paper Low and High scenarios are realised. The forecasted changes, in terms of projected cargo types in rail freight transport, total freight transport demand and the corresponding development of service, will influence customer service expectations. They will also directly impact on the flexibility and ability of rail operations and their integration with other transport modes (e.g. <b>pick-up</b> <b>service</b> at origins and delivery service at destinations) to meet customer demands and expectations. The flexible ability to offer such door-to-door, as well as terminal-to-terminal, services will influence rail transport in general, and rail infrastructure in particular, at a national and a European level. It is important that the rail industry and governments maintain a policy of development and investment, if the EU Transport White Paper targets are to be achieved.|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Vehicle routing problem (VRP) is a Nondeterministic Polynomial Hard {{combinatorial}} optimization problem {{to serve the}} consumers from central depots and returned back to the originated depots with given vehicles. Furthermore, {{two of the most}} important extensions of the VRPs are the open vehicle routing problem (OVRP) and VRP with simultaneous pickup and delivery (VRPSPD). In OVRP, the vehicles have not return to the depot after last visit and in VRPSPD, customers require simultaneous delivery and <b>pick-up</b> <b>service.</b> The aim {{of this paper is to}} present a combined effective ant colony optimization (CEACO) which includes sweep and several local search algorithms which is different with common ant colony optimization (ACO). An extensive numerical experiment is performed on benchmark problem instances addressed in the literature. The computational result shows that suggested CEACO approach not only presented a very satisfying scalability, but also was competitive with other meta-heuristic algorithms in the literature for solving VRP, OVRP and VRPSPD problems...|$|E
