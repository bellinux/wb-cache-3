40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} various sorts of environmental <b>pressure</b> <b>groups</b> and policy makers. It is argued that environmental <b>pressure</b> <b>groups</b> prefer various sorts of political activity, such as protest marches and blockades to manifesting their preferences through standard demand curves. It is also argued that this is in fact efficient for the environmental <b>pressure</b> <b>groups,</b> since {{it allows them to}} manifest their valuation of a good with lesser strain on their consumption of other goods. A model of the interaction between two environmental <b>pressure</b> <b>groups</b> with conflicting interests and a regulator is discussed. 1...|$|R

5|$|George William Odlum (24 June 1934 – 28 September 2003) was a Saint Lucian left-wing {{politician}} {{who served as}} Deputy Prime Minister and Foreign Minister. Born in Castries, Odlum studied at Bristol University and Oxford University in the United Kingdom before returning to Saint Lucia as Permanent Secretary to the Ministry of Trade. After working for the Commonwealth Secretariat and the West Indies Associated States, he formed the Saint Lucia Forum, a left-wing <b>pressure</b> <b>group.</b> This group merged with the Saint Lucia Labour Party {{in time for the}} 1974 elections; although the Party did not win, the progress they made allowed them to take power in 1979, with Odlum as Deputy Prime Minister.|$|E
5|$|Immediately {{after the}} election, the Referendum Party renamed itself the Referendum Movement. Goldsmith had been {{suffering}} from pancreatic cancer, and had been warned that competing the election would shorten his life. Goldsmith died in Benahavis, Spain on 18 July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly after. Some of its members transformed into the Democracy Movement, a <b>pressure</b> <b>group</b> {{closely associated with the}} former Conservative supporter and multi-millionaire businessman Paul Sykes. The Eurosceptic cause was weakened, however; with Blair's firmly pro-EU government in power, by 1998 the possibility of a referendum on the UK's membership of the EU was considered as distant as it had been in 1995.|$|E
5|$|Living in Brighton, Valiente took up {{employment}} in {{a branch of}} the Boots pharmacist. In 1971 she appeared on the BBC documentary, Power of the Witch, which was devoted to Wicca and also featured the prominent Wiccan Alex Sanders. That same year, she was involved in the founding of the Pagan Front, a British <b>pressure</b> <b>group</b> that campaigned for the religious rights of Wiccans and other Pagans. In November 1970 she developed a full moon inauguration ritual for local branches of the Front to use and on May Day 1971 she chaired its first national meeting, held at Chiswick, West London. It was she who developed the three principles that came to be central to the Pagan Front's interpretation of their religion: adherence to the Wiccan Rede, a belief in reincarnation, and a sense of kinship with nature.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{develops}} a common agency problem using a two stages menu auction game {{to show how}} <b>pressure</b> <b>groups</b> can aid in deciding how much public good should be provided. By sorting people into different <b>pressure</b> <b>groups</b> that represent the individuals’ preferences for the public good, the interaction among the <b>pressure</b> <b>groups</b> is an important element that could improve the provision of public goods. This paper sketches a very simple mechanism to provide a general contribution to finance a public good. In this model, the presence of <b>pressure</b> <b>groups</b> improves the undersupply of public goods typical in voluntary contribution models, while avoiding the distortionary effects of non-lump-sum transfers of the involuntary contributions models.

5|$|Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, {{demand for}} a Scottish Parliament grew, {{in part because the}} {{government}} of the United Kingdom was controlled by the Conservative Party, while Scotland itself elected relatively few Conservative MPs. In the aftermath of the 1979 referendum defeat, the Campaign for a Scottish Assembly was initiated as a <b>pressure</b> <b>group,</b> leading to the 1989 Scottish Constitutional Convention with various organisations such as Scottish churches, political parties and representatives of industry taking part. Publishing its blueprint for devolution in 1995, the Convention provided much of the basis for the structure of the Parliament.|$|E
5|$|In {{response}} the Liberal Party launched Women's Liberal Associations {{which allowed}} women {{more freedom to}} allocate a role and voice for themselves and were not a mere subsidiary of the national party. The organisation {{of women in the}} Liberal Party in Wales began around 1890 supported by prominent members Gwyneth Vaughan, Nora Phillips and Sybil Thomas. In 1891 an Aberdare branch of the Women's Liberal Foundation was founded and it quickly began advocating votes for women and began leafleting in both English and Welsh. By 1893 there were said to be 7,000 members of the Welsh Union of Women's Liberal Associations which had raised to 9,000 by 1895. At a meeting of the North Wales Liberal Foundation in 1895 it was decided that Women's Liberal Federation would merge with Cymru Fydd, a political <b>pressure</b> <b>group</b> for home rule, to form a new Welsh Liberal Federation and equal rights for women were written into the objects of the organisation. Despite some early successes Liberal organisation floundered as they headed into the new century and apart from the Cardiff branch which achieved some successes, many of the branches had closed by 1907.|$|E
5|$|In the {{build-up}} to the 1997 general election, the Referendum Party {{spent more}} on press advertising {{than either the}} incumbent Conservatives or their main rival, the Labour Party. It stood candidates in 547 constituencies, more than any minor party had ever fielded in a UK election. Ultimately, it gained 811,827 votes, representing 2.6% of the national total. Support was strongest in southern and eastern England, and weakest in inner London, northern England, and Scotland. The party failed to win any seats in the House of Commons. Following the election, psephologists argued {{that the impact of}} the Referendum Party deprived Conservative candidates of victory in somewhere between four and sixteen parliamentary seats. In the months following the election, the party renamed itself the Referendum Movement. Goldsmith died in July 1997, and the party disbanded shortly after. Some of its members reformed as a Eurosceptic <b>pressure</b> <b>group</b> called the Democracy Movement, and many others joined Eurosceptic political parties like the UK Independence Party and the Democratic Party.|$|E

5|$|The {{proposal}} {{to build a}} wind farm, in {{a joint venture between}} United Utilities and Peel Holdings, was announced in 2003. Shortly afterwards a <b>pressure</b> <b>group,</b> The Friends of Scout and Knowle Moor, was formed, and on 9 September 2003 representatives of the group attended a meeting of the Metropolitan Borough of Bury's, Ramsbottom and Tottington Area Board to oppose the plans. At the meeting, the spokesperson for the group said that, although they supported the use of alternative energy, they felt that this was the wrong area. Among the objections were that the scheme was contrary to the Unitary Development Plan and the Green Belt, and would adversely affect common land, open countryside and areas of ecological importance and special landscape value. The group also considered that the proposed development would be out of scale with the landscape, adversely affecting peat, water courses and wildlife, and would have a seriously detrimental visual impact, as well as causing a noise nuisance.|$|E
5|$|Under the Gleichschaltung process, Hitler {{attempted}} {{to create a}} unified Protestant Reich Church from Germany's 28 existing Protestant state churches, with {{the ultimate goal of}} eradication of the churches in Germany. Pro-Nazi Ludwig Müller was installed as Reich Bishop and the pro-Nazi <b>pressure</b> <b>group</b> German Christians gained control of the new church. They objected to the Old Testament because of its Jewish origins and demanded that converted Jews be barred from their church. Pastor Martin Niemöller responded with the formation of the Confessing Church, from which some clergymen opposed the Nazi regime. When in 1935 the Confessing Church synod protested the Nazi policy on religion, 700 of their pastors were arrested. Müller resigned and Hitler appointed Hanns Kerrl as Minister for Church Affairs to continue efforts to control Protestantism. In 1936, a Confessing Church envoy protested to Hitler against the religious persecutions and human rights abuses. Hundreds more pastors were arrested. The church continued to resist and by early 1937 Hitler abandoned his hope of uniting the Protestant churches. The Confessing Church was banned on 1 July 1937 and Niemöller was arrested and confined, first in Sachsenhausen concentration camp and then at Dachau. Theological universities were closed and more pastors and theologians were arrested.|$|E
5|$|The 1996–97 season saw Oxford finish seventeenth, and {{included}} {{the sale of}} Scottish international defender Matt Elliott to Leicester City. Despite Smith's departure to West Bromwich Albion in December 1997, United finished twelfth the following season under his successor, and former captain, Malcolm Shotton. Shotton was previously the assistant manager of the Barnsley side that gained promotion to the Premier League. During October 1998, the backroom staff at the club went unpaid, due to United's financial situation with the new stadium, {{and the threat of}} administration caused a group of fans to set up a <b>pressure</b> <b>group</b> called Fighting for Oxford United's Life (FOUL). The group began to publicise the club's plight through a series of meetings and events, including a 'Scarf of Unity', which was a collection of scarfs from various clubs which was long enough to stretch {{around the perimeter of the}} pitch. Chairman Robin Herd stepped down to concentrate on his engineering projects, and in April 1999 Firoz Kassam bought Herd's 89.9% controlling interest in Oxford United for £1, with which he also inherited the club's estimated £15 million debt. Kassam reduced the £9 million of the debt to just £900,000, by virtue of a Company Voluntary Arrangement, by which unsecured creditors who were owed over £1,000 were reimbursed with 10p for every pound they were owed. Secured creditors were paid off when Kassam sold the Manor to another of his companies, for £6 million. Kassam set about completing the unfinished stadium, gaining planning permission for a bowling alley, multiplex cinema and hotel next to the stadium, following a series of legal battles which were eventually all settled. The season ended with relegation back to the Second Division.|$|E

40|$|Abstract__ In the 2000 s, {{the largest}} ports in the Hamburg - Le-Havre range {{encountered}} public resistance from nature preservation and environmental <b>pressure</b> <b>groups</b> during port expansion, resulting in conflicts and, moreover, delays. Eventually, {{in the case}} of Rotterdam the conflicts were settled, resulting in the broad acceptation of the port expansion and even support of the <b>pressure</b> <b>groups.</b> The main question is why. Using the discourse coalition approach it is shown, that there were three preconditions for the rise of support. Firstly, only through covenants and specific (compensation) projects local stakeholders could be persuaded to support port development. Secondly, politicians and civil servants had {{to accept the fact that}} the role of the <b>pressure</b> <b>groups</b> had changed. For example, most of the delays were caused by the resistance of politicians against the new role of the <b>pressure</b> <b>groups.</b> Thirdly, in general this case shows that only through conflicts with stakeholder such as <b>pressure</b> <b>groups</b> and local citizens, innovative new strategies can be applied. Only then politicians and civil servants are willing to change their stance towards them. In other words, a comforting thought is that actually the conflict is the key to a structural solution...|$|R
