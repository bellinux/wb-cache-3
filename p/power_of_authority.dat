2500|$|Haiti has {{consistently}} {{ranked among the}} most corrupt {{countries in the world}} on the Corruption Perceptions Index. It is estimated that President [...] "Baby Doc" [...] Duvalier, his wife Michelle, and their agents stole US $504 million from the country's treasury between 1971 and 1986. Similarly, after the Haitian Army folded in 1995, the Haitian National Police (HNP) gained sole <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> on the Haitian citizens. Many Haitians as well as observers of the Haitian society believe that this monopolized power could have given way to a corrupt police force.|$|E
2500|$|Issuance of a writ is an {{exercise}} of an extraordinary jurisdiction of the superior courts in Pakistan. A writ of habeas corpus may be issued by any High Court of a province in Pakistan. Article 199 of the 1973 Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan, specifically provides for the issuance of a writ of habeas corpus, empowering the courts to exercise this prerogative. Subject to the Article 199 of the Constitution, [...] "A High Court may, if it is satisfied that no other adequate remedy is provided by law, on the application of any person, make an order that a person in custody within the territorial jurisdiction of the Court be brought before {{it so that the}} Court may satisfy itself that he is not being held in custody without a lawful authority or in an unlawful manner". The hallmark of extraordinary constitutional jurisdiction is to keep various functionaries of State within the ambit of their authority. Once a High Court has assumed jurisdiction to adjudicate the matter before it, justiciability of the issue raised before it is beyond question. The Supreme Court of Pakistan has stated clearly that the use of words [...] "in an unlawful manner" [...] implies that the court may examine, if a statute has allowed such detention, whether it was a colorable exercise of the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority.</b> Thus, the court can examine the malafides of the action taken.|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of “Slippery Slope Framework” has attracted many researchers who examined the effect <b>of</b> trust in <b>authorities</b> and <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> on tax compliance using both the real taxpayer and student subjects. However, these researchers have neglected {{the use of}} cross country data to examine these effects. In line with prior empirical evidences that confirm the effect <b>of</b> trust and <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> on tax compliance, this study hypothesizes that both trust and power have association with tax compliance across countries. It further hypothesizes that trust has more association with tax compliance than power. This study is based on 49 Sub-Saharan African countries as the population, out of which 37 countries were selected using multi-stage random sampling. The empirical results from these countries reveal {{that there is an}} association between both trust in <b>authorities</b> and <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> and tax compliance across the 37 Sub-Saharan African countries, but the association between <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> and tax compliance is stronger than that <b>of</b> trust in <b>authorities</b> and tax compliance. Further, the result does not find any causing effect of both trust and power on tax compliance in the countries that constituted the study sample...|$|R

60|$|And in {{the parable}} of the Prodigal Son may be read the history of what are known as the Protestant nations. What happens logically when the {{individual}} is suddenly freed from the restraint of external authority occurred when Martin Luther released the vital spark of Christianity, which he got from Paul, and from Christ himself--the revelation of individual responsibility, that God the Spirit would dwell, by grace, in the individual soul. Ah, we had paid a terrible yet necessary price for freedom. We had wandered far from the Father, we had been reduced to the very husks of individualism, become as swine. We beheld around us, to-day, selfishness, ruthless competition, as great contrasts between misery and luxury as {{in the days of the}} Roman Empire. But should we, for that reason, return to the leading-strings of authority? Could we if we would? A little thought ought to convince us that the liberation of the individual could not be revoked, that it had forever destroyed the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> to carry conviction. To go back to the Middle Ages would be to deteriorate and degenerate. No, we must go on....|$|E

Under Farrington, the Hawaiians were exempted from the 1920 Politics by the Haole-Hawaiian Alliance. But after the Massie Affair, doubts arose over entrusting the <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> to the Hawaiians. Under Alliance, Hawaiians were able to receive government jobs which had included police officers and prison guards. But, after examining these positions, U.S. Attorney General Seth Richardson found an incompetent police force and sympathetic prison guards. The Hawaiians had betrayed {{the trust of the}} white leadership to carry out their demands, were regarded as a liability and phased out by whites.

40|$|We {{investigate}} the impact <b>of</b> trust in <b>authorities</b> on tax compliance within a controlled laboratory setting. Embedded in two hypothetical tax systems with {{high and low}} <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> respectively, we gradually increase trust in <b>authorities</b> in form <b>of</b> tax knowledge about public expenditures and by allowing taxpayers to decide on what public goods they want their tax dollars to be spend for. To clearly disentangle any effects from factors that are known to influence tax compliance from previous studies, we control for tax commitment, risk attitude, income and effort exerted to earn the income which the taxpayers report truthfully or underreport to the tax authority. Non-parametric statistical analyses as well as multivariate regressions provide clear evidence that tax compliance is higher in tax systems with low <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>authorities</b> when providing complete transparency on public expenditures and when taxpayers are given the possibility {{to decide on the}} use of their taxes. With a powerful tax authority in place which is reflected in high audit rates, compliance does not change when increasing trust in authorities. Our results have important policy implications as the mere hypothetical possibility to express preferences on budget spending influences tax compliance...|$|R

5000|$|Grand Burgher male or Grand Burgheress female (from German: Großbürger male, Großbürgerin female) is a {{specific}} conferred or inherited title of medieval German origin and legally defined preeminent status granting exclusive constitutional privileges and legal rights (German: Großbürgerrecht), who were magnates and subordinate only to the Emperor, independent of feudalism and territorial nobility or lords paramount. A member class within the patrician ruling elite, the Grand Burgher was a type of urban citizen and social order of highest rank, a formally defined upper social class of affluent individuals and elite burgher families in medieval German-speaking city-states and towns under the Holy Roman Empire, who usually were of a wealthy business or significant mercantile background and estate. This hereditary title and influential constitutional status, privy to very few individuals and families across Central Europe, formally existed well into the late 19th century and {{early part of the}} 20th century. In autonomous German-speaking cities and towns of Central Europe that held a municipal charter, town privileges (German town law) or were a free imperial city such as Hamburg, Augsburg, Cologne and Bern that held imperial immediacy, where nobility had no <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> or supremacy, the Grand Burghers (Großbürger) or patricians ("Patrizier") constituted the ruling class.|$|E

40|$|This paper covers {{power and}} {{authority}} in adult education, focusing on the modern definitions <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and <b>authority</b> in the educational context, then moving into past precedents of the use <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and <b>authority</b> <b>of</b> classrooms. Finally, the optimal types <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and <b>authority</b> to apply to adult education are examined. Power defines a relationship between two parties where one follows the directives <b>of</b> the other. <b>Authority</b> is a legitimizing <b>of</b> the <b>power,</b> essentially the why one party should follow the other. What is concluded is that adults have different needs than younger students, and so power-sharing in the classroom with loose authority is likely {{the best way to}} approach an education situation {{due to the fact that}} adults are already autonomous in their everyday lives, have fully-developed brain physiology, and are more capable of communicating their concerns in a way that does not require heavy-handed, interventionist types <b>of</b> <b>power</b> and <b>authority.</b> Keywords:, power, authority, and adult education 1...|$|R
50|$|The Soviet Control Commission (Sowjetische Kontrollkommission) was a Soviet {{monitoring}} and management committee overseeing {{the leadership of the}} German Democratic Republic and was active between 10 October 1949 to 28 May 1953. Their legitimacy was justified in agreements that had been made by the victorious powers at the Potsdam Conference (17 July to 2 August 1945). After that, the military government transferred its functions for a transitional period to formally fine German administrative organs. It replaced the Soviet Military Administration in Germany, which had previously exercised the sole administrative authority in the Soviet zone of occupation. With the founding of the German Democratic Republic on 7 October 1949, the Commission was given the requirements to replace the military government. This meant, however, that the East German government could operate independently of the West. The Soviet Control Commission could always overrule the decisions of the commission in East Germany if the decision of the East German commission were considered at odds with the official Soviet policies. Local officials had little power to make decisions or revise the decisions made. They controlled both the government of the GDR and the state governments. It was considered the ultimate <b>power</b> <b>of</b> <b>authority</b> both in the Soviet zone and in the former GDR.|$|E
