40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{reports the}} development of a new multi-band multi-output synthesizer, 1 / 2 dual-injection locked divider, 1 / 3 injection-locked divider with phase-tuning, and 1 / 3 injection-locked divider with self-injection using 0. 18 -micrometer CMOS technology. The synthesizer is used for a multi-band multi-polarization radar system operating in the K- and Ka-band. The synthesizer is a fully integrated concurrent tri-band, tri-output phase-locked loop (PLL) with divide-by- 3 injection locked frequency divider (ILFD). A new locking mechanism for the ILFD based on the gain control of the feedback amplifier is utilized to enable tunable and enhanced locking range which facilitates the attainment of stable locking states. The PLL has three concurrent multiband outputs: 3. 47 - 4. 313 GHz, 6. 94 - 8. 626 GHz and 19. 44 - 21. 42 -GHz. High second-order harmonic suppression of 62. 2 dBc is achieved without using a filter through optimization of the balance between the differential outputs. The proposed technique enables the use of an integer-N architecture for multi-band and microwave systems, while maintaining the benefit of the integer-N architecture; an optimal performance in area and power consumption. The 1 / 2 dual-ILFD with wide locking range and low-power consumption is analyzed and designed together with a divide-by- 2 current mode logic (CML) divider. The 1 / 2 dual-ILFD enhances the locking range with low-power consumption through optimized load quality factor (QL) and output current amplitude (iOSC) simultaneously. The 1 / 2 dual-ILFD achieves a locking range of 692 MHz between 7. 512 and 8. 204 GHz. The new 1 / 2 dual-ILFD is especially attractive for microwave phase-locked loops and frequency synthesizers requiring low power and wide locking range. The 3. 5 -GHz divide-by- 3 (1 / 3) ILFD consists of an internal 10. 5 -GHz Voltage Controlled Oscillator (VCO) functioning as an injection source, 1 / 3 ILFD core, and output inverter buffer. A <b>phase</b> <b>tuner</b> implemented on an asymmetric inductor is proposed to increase the locking range. The other divide-by- 3 ILFD utilizes self-injection technique. The self-injection technique substantially enhances the locking range and phase noise, and reduces the minimum power of the injection signal needed for the 1 / 3 ILFD. The locking range is increased by 47. 8 % and the phase noise is reduced by 14. 77 dBc/Hz at 1 -MHz offset...|$|E

40|$|Optical beam {{steering}} can find applications in several domains such as laser scanning, LiDAR (Light Detection And Ranging), wireless data transfer and optical switches and interconnects. As present {{beam steering}} approaches use mechanical motion such as moving mirrors or MEMS (Micro Electro Mechanical Systems) or molecular movement using liquid crystals, {{they are usually}} limited in speed and/or performance. Therefore we have studied the possibilities of the integrated silicon photonics platform in beam steering applications. In this paper, we have investigated a 16 element one-dimensional optical phased array on silicon-on-insulator with a field-of-view of 23.

The phased array {{was composed of}} silicon-on-insulator waveguide surface gratings integrated with thermo-optic <b>phase</b> <b>tuners</b> and was operated both using a control algorithm together with automated real-time far field image analysis to target and shape the beam, and using a lookup table without real-time feedback. The device exhibited 1. 6 × 0. 6 beam width and 10 dB background suppression in the far field across a 20 × 14 field of view. We show that by increasing the waveguide width from 1 m to 3 m we can suppress the side-lobe peaks {{by a factor of}} 2.

40|$|A new Tuner type for "Harmonic Tuning" is presented. It generates high VSWR at 2 fo and 3 fo as {{required}} for harmonic load pull. The new tuners can be precalibrated and appropriate interpolation routines ensure high-resolution coverage of 360 ° of harmonic reflection <b>phase.</b> The harmonic <b>tuners</b> use a proprietary resonant cavity as a variable probe, which covers instantaneous bandwidth of = 10 % {{in the frequency}} range from 400 MHz to over 60 GHz. The new tuners can be built as "stand-alone two-harmonic frequency " units or they can be "combined with fundamental tuners". A new concept for tuner calibration allows us to fully characterize the harmonic and the "combo " tuners in about 4 to 8 minutes per frequency point (including fo, 2 fo, 3 fo). The new tuners permit to search and optimize the harmonic load and source impedance independently on fundamental tuning and provide test data for substantial design improvements in terms of Gain, PAE and Intermod...|$|R
