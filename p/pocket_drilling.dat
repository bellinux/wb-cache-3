40|$|Maize and {{climbing}} beans as associated crops {{prevail in the}} highlands of L. A. in traditional systems with low populations and manual planting (in rows and <b>pocket</b> <b>drilling).</b> Two trials were establislied to compare the systems, testing bean densities from 4 - 12 plants/m(2) and 3 - 12 plants/m(2), with the same maize population and simultaneous planting. Five bean genotypes with different aggressiveness for climbing were tested with one maize genotype (Suwan- 1). Row planting was superior in both trials for both crop yields, but the difference was siginificant with a bean density of 8 plants/m(2). This density was considered optimum when the yields of both crops were taken into account. Both the planting system and bean var. had an important effect on the lodging of maize. There was less lodging for <b>pocket</b> <b>drilling</b> than in rows and at a greater bean density due to the better anchoring of the roots. The effect of bean var. on maize yields was {{closely related to the}} lodging of the stem caused by bean aggressiveness: max effect with the most aggressive beans (type IV b) and min effect with the weaker climbing beans (type III b). Therefore, maize genotypes for association should have strong stems to resist lodging. (AS...|$|E

40|$|Different assays on {{climbing}} {{beans in}} relay cropping or associated with maize, N fixation and Rhizobium inoculation, and bush beans in monoculture are reported. These {{were conducted in}} La Selva, Antioquia (Colombia), through a collaborative project between the Instituto Colombiano Agropecuario (ICA) and CIAT. A total of 56 materials were selected from 723 from Spain, Portugal, Peru, Ecuador, and Colombia for productivity and disease- resistance, especially to anthracnose (Colletotrichum lindemuthianum). In a previous study, 9 large-grained var. were selected (greater than 40 g/ 100 seeds) with higher yields in relay cropping (greater than 1937 kg/ha) than Cargamanto, and among these, var. E 1056 (No. CIAT G 12488) is specially recommended for Colombia. Best planting densities for maize and beans in association are 30 - 40, 000 maize plants/ha and 20 - 40, 000 bean plants/ha <b>pocket</b> <b>drilled</b> in a 90 - 100 cm x 90 - 100 cm square planting. In trials with advanced lines up to F 4 and F 6, 12 were selected from an original lot of 32, 680 plants yielding greater than 1631 kg/ha, the majority with black- or brown-colored seed. Four red-seeded var. (V 7916, V 7918, V 79115, and V 79116) were selected for productivity, early maturation, and resistance to major diseases. In trials of N fixation 3 strains of Rhizobium, that allowed yields similar to those obtained when treated with N fertilizer, were identified. The soil application of PCNB reduced root rot and the toxicity of Rhizobium by the fungicide decreased when the inoculum was applied in granules below the seed. (AS-CIAT...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{shows the}} effect of process damping—caused by the {{interference}} between the cutter and the previously cut surface—on the stability of drillstrings. The method of including process damping in the calculation of the stability diagram is outlined. Previously published stability diagrams of drillstrings equipped with drag bits showed decreased stability at low cutting speeds, and that {{the addition of a}} shock absorber decreased the size of stability pockets. In this paper, we show that the introduction of process damping confirms field observations of increased stability at low speeds. We also show that a properly designed shock absorber produces large stability <b>pockets</b> where <b>drilling</b> is most effective. Background The cause of vibrations in drillstrings {{has been the subject of}} extensive research. Based on the type of cutter used, dif-ferent mechanisms for the source of vibrations were proposed. In this paper we restrict our discussion to drillstrings equipped with drag bits containing polycrystalline diamond compac...|$|R
40|$|Includes bibliographical {{references}} (leaves 133 - 134) The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to integrate machining features used in CAM directly into a CAD software package using the Visual Basic API. The background for this idea of integrating the software features is from a graduate class offered at California State University, Northridge which is Computer Aided Design of Machine Elements, where students learn how to apply VBA in SolidWorks {{and were able to}} integrate and change parameters such as diameters of a gear mechanism in MS Excel and pass these values into SolidWorks for static and dynamic analysis. The normal procedure for creating numerical code that can be used by CNC machines is (1) generate a solid model in a CAD program, (2) export the solid model to the CAM program, (3) generate the necessary chains and machining operations, (4) post process and create the numerical code. Here, this entire process is simplified by using the Visual Basic API to create a "pipeline" linking the CAD and CAM programs together. A series of macros were created and attached to buttons on a menu bar to simplify the work flow. The macros contain objects, methods, and properties which create the chains, machining operations, tools, and ultimately the numerical code without the direct use of the CAM package. This streamlines the entire process and eliminates the need to learn the CAM package interface. To understand the VBA object model several test programs were executed from the Visual Basic editor for different simple parts created on SolidWorks having various features to perform operations such as facing, contouring, <b>pocketing,</b> <b>drilling</b> etc. Numerous subroutines were created in order to perform various operations and thus giving an idea how to integrate Esprit into SolidWorks and generate the NC code to run the operation on the CNC machine. It {{is important to note that}} global coordinate system with properly aligned location as well as X, Y, and Z axes were created in SolidWorks prior to saving part in the ParaSolid file format, which was then used to get the profiles from ESPRIT in order to generate the tool path for machining. Any simple features on the block can be machined using this procedure. The ESPRIT working interface is also emulated in SolidWorks where you can assign the speeds, feeds, tool numbers and other parameters which are needed, can be assigned. It can be concluded that VBA is a powerful tool which is user friendly and compatible with most of the existing software running on Microsoft windows operating system applications. Thus, the ESPRIT software interface can be controlled from within SolidWorks without having to import the part in order to generate the NC code...|$|R

These contain pages of drill charts, which often either give a picture or list {{coordinates}} that band members use to find 'pages' or 'sets' on the field. Coordinates are normally listed in 8-to-5 steps off the front sideline and front and back hashes, along with the number of 8-5 steps off of the yardline listed on each page. Some bands are even using small plastic pouches that hang about their neck on an adjustable strap, which has a zipper <b>pocket</b> for holding <b>drill,</b> flags to mark sets, and a pencil. There is also a clear plastic window in front to display the current part of drill being worked on at that point in time.|$|R
40|$|Evidences {{of highly}} {{localized}} methane fluxes are reported from the Arctic shelf, hot spots of methane emissions in thermokarst lakes, and {{are believed to}} evolve to features like Yamal crater on land. The origin of large methane outbursts is problematic. Here we show, that the biogenic methane (13 C ≤ − 71 ‰) which formed before and during soil freezing is presently held in the permafrost. Field and experimental observations show that methane tends to accumulate at the permafrost table or in the coarse-grained lithological pockets surrounded by the sediments less-permeable for gas. Our field observations, radiocarbon dating, laboratory tests and theory all suggest that depending on the soil structure and freezing dynamics, this methane may have been displaced downwards tens of meters during freezing and has accumulated in the lithological pockets. The initial flux of methane from the one <b>pocket</b> disclosed by <b>drilling</b> was {{at a rate of}} more than 2. 5 kg C(CH 4) m− 2 h− 1. The age of the methane was 8 – 18 thousand years younger than the age of the sediments, suggesting that it was displaced tens of meters during freezing. The theoretical background provided the insight on the cryogenic displacement of methane in support of the field and experimental data. Upon freezing of sediments, methane follows water migration and either dissipates in the freezing soils or concentrates at certain places controlled by the freezing rate, initial methane distribution and soil structure...|$|R
5000|$|... Barely {{seven years}} after Edwin L. Drake drilled the world's first oil well in 1859 at Titusville, Pennsylvania, USA, history {{registered}} another exploration of the black liquid gold, in the largest continent. More than a century ago, history was made in a remote corner of Assam {{in the midst of}} the dense and malaria infested jungles, by a band of intrepid pioneers searching for black gold. In 1867 Italian Engineers, commissioned by the Assam Railways and Trading Company, to build a railway line from Dibrugarh to Margherita (Headquarters of Assam Railways and Trading Company) accidentally discovered oil at Digboi around 10 miles from Margherita.‘Dig boy, dig’, shouted the English engineer, Mr W L Lake, at his men as they watched elephants emerging out of the dense forest with oil stains on their feet".This is possibly the most distilled - though fanciful - version of the legend explaining the siting and naming of Digboi. Two events separated by seven years have become fused, but although neither is likely to be provable, such evidence that does exist appears sufficiently detailed to be credible. Various web sites offer variations on the elephant’s foot story, a consensus of which would be that engineers extending the Dibru-Sadiya railway line to Ledo for the Assam Railways and Trading Company (AR&TC) in 1882 were using elephants for haulage and noticed that the mud on one pachyderm’s feet smelled of oil. Retracing the trail of footprints, they found oil seeping to the surface. One of the engineers, the Englishman Willie Leova Lake, was an ‘oil enthusiast’ and persuaded the company to drill a well. Oil India Ltd makes no reference to elephants’ feet in its company history, although on its previous web site the company noted that Lake had noticed [...] "the oil seepages around Borbhil". Once the project had been approved, Lake assembled equipment, boilers, and local labour, and engaged elephants to haul the machinery to the site. The first well was started in September 1889, but an encouraging first strike at 178 ft turned out to be a small <b>pocket,</b> and <b>drilling</b> recommenced. This continued until November 1890 when the well was completed at a total depth of 662 ft, and it was during this extended period of drilling that Oil India's old web site placed the legend of Lake exhorting one or more of his labourers to [...] "Dig, boy!" ...|$|R
