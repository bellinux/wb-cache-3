25|$|The committal {{hearing to}} {{determine}} if there was sufficient evidence for Einem to stand trial for murder began on 20 February 1984. Faced with irrefutable evidence from prosecutors that Kelvin had been in his company, Einem suddenly changed his story to answer that evidence and admitted that he had been in contact with Richard Kelvin on the night of 5 June 1983. Einem said that he was driving along O'Connell Street in North Adelaide looking for a parking spot in order to buy some dinner. While looking for a parking spot in a side street, Einem said that he had nearly run over Kelvin as he jogged in from his side. Einem stated he thought Kelvin had bisexual tendencies and said {{that the two of them}} then had a conversation about problems Kelvin had been having at school, and Kelvin willingly got into the car and they drove to Einem's home. This answered the question of how fibres from Einem's carpet had got onto Kelvin's clothes. To answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's bed had come to be on Kelvin's clothes, Einem stated that the two of them had sat on his bed and played with the large harp which he kept in his bedroom. Police previously did see this harp in his room when they seized the drugs. Finally, to answer evidence about how fibres from Einem's cardigan had got onto Kelvin, Einem stated that he had <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> Kelvin and hugged him because Kelvin was upset about how his peers had been bullying him at school. With all the fibres being accounted for with his new story, Einem concluded his statement by saying that Kelvin had stayed for two hours before Einem dropped him off in the Adelaide CBD near the Royal Adelaide Hospital and gave Kelvin $20 to pay for a taxi home.|$|E
500|$|Robinson did, however, receive {{significant}} {{encouragement from}} several major league players. Robinson named Lee [...] "Jeep" [...] Handley, {{who played for}} the Phillies at the time, as the first opposing player to wish him well. Dodgers teammate Pee Wee Reese once came to Robinson's defense with the famous line, [...] "You can hate a man for many reasons. Color {{is not one of}} them." [...] In 1948, Reese <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> Robinson in response to fans who shouted racial slurs at Robinson before a game in Cincinnati. A statue by sculptor William Behrends, unveiled at KeySpan Park on November 1, 2005, commemorates this event by representing Reese with his arm around Robinson. Jewish baseball star Hank Greenberg, who had to deal with racial epithets during his career, also encouraged Robinson. Following an incident where Greenberg collided with Robinson at first base, he [...] "whispered a few words into Robinson's ear", which Robinson later characterized as [...] "words of encouragement." [...] Greenberg had advised him to overcome his critics by defeating them in games. Robinson also talked frequently with Larry Doby, who endured his own hardships since becoming the first black player in the American League with the Cleveland Indians, as the two spoke to one another via telephone throughout the season.|$|E
500|$|Two {{young female}} millworkers in 1873 Maine visit the town's {{carousel}} after work. One of them, Julie Jordan, attracts {{the attention of}} the barker, Billy Bigelow ("The Carousel Waltz"). [...] When Julie lets Billy <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her during the ride, Mrs. Mullin, the widowed owner of the carousel, tells Julie never to return. Julie and her friend, Carrie Pipperidge, argue with Mrs. Mullin. [...] Billy arrives and, seeing that Mrs. Mullin is jealous, mocks her; he is fired from his job. Billy, unconcerned, invites Julie to join him for a drink. As he goes to get his belongings, Carrie presses Julie about her feelings toward him, but Julie is evasive ("You're a Queer One, Julie Jordan"). Carrie has a beau too, fisherman Enoch Snow ("(When I Marry) Mister Snow"), to whom she is newly engaged. [...] Billy returns for Julie as the departing Carrie warns that staying out late means the loss of Julie's job. Mr. Bascombe, owner of the mill, happens by along with a policeman, and offers to escort Julie to her home, but she refuses and is fired. Left alone, she and Billy talk about what life might be like if they were in love, but neither quite confesses to the growing attraction they feel for each other ("If I Loved You").|$|E

500|$|Peel, having {{concluded}} that the suspension would end his Yorkshire career, signed a contract to play for Accrington Cricket Club. He told a newspaper that he regarded his suspension as unfair, {{that he had been}} given no opportunity to explain, and that he had taken the appointment with Accrington to provide for himself and his family. In 1900, he told Cricket magazine that, before his suspension, he had been bedridden for three weeks {{as a result of an}} injury he suffered while batting, that he played against Middlesex with some success and was then suspended without any explanation. He later said of the incident: [...] " [...] <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> me and escorted me off the field and out of Yorkshire cricket. What a gentleman". The journalist Harry Pearson suggests that this was [...] "either very gracious, or exceedingly sarcastic." [...] Hawke later described Peel's sacking as [...] "the most decisive action of my whole career... It had to be done for the sake of discipline and the good of cricket. Nothing ever gave me so much pain." [...] At the time, Hawke believed these events cost Yorkshire the County Championship, but the team had only two more games to play in that season's competition, and it was mathematically impossible for them to win. Hirst told Thompson that Hawke was always sorry that Peel had to be sacked, and that whenever the pair met afterwards, they remained friends and that neither bore the other any animosity. Although Peel considered himself indispensable, the following year he was replaced by Wilfred Rhodes, who remained in the team until 1930 and took 4,184 first-class wickets. Peel remained popular with the people of Morley in the aftermath of his dismissal, and they supported him rather than believing the reports.|$|E
2500|$|His {{interest}} in music kept him on friendly terms with female musicians including pianist Moura Lympany. When Heath was Prime Minister she {{was approached by}} the Conservative MP Tufton Beamish, who said: [...] "Moura, Ted must get married. Will you marry him?" [...] She said she would have done but {{was in love with}} someone else. She later said the most intimate thing Heath had done was to <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her shoulder.|$|E
2500|$|He infamously {{identified}} {{a picture of}} a heavily muddied jockey as John Reid, only to be mortified when told it was the Princess Anne. Later in the same series, she came on the programme, made it clear she was not remotely offended by the misidentification, and was put on his team. Hughes caused a minor national debate when he defied protocol and <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> her. [...] He called her [...] "ma'am" [...] throughout. Hughes later joined her team for the much-criticised It's a Royal Knockout project, the brainchild of her brother the Prince Edward.|$|E

2500|$|Rumsfeld {{discusses}} the longtime problems of his son, Nick, with drug addiction. He recalls {{when his son}} checked into a rehab clinic shortly after 9/11, and Rumsfeld, overcome with emotion, breaks down {{in a meeting with}} Bush in the Oval Office. He writes, [...] "I had not imagined I might choke up... at that moment George W Bush wasn't just the president. He was a compassionate human being who had a sense of what Joyce and I were going through." [...] Rumsfeld states that Bush rose from the Presidential desk to <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> him in understanding.|$|E
2500|$|The accuser's mother, Janet Arvizo, {{testified that}} on a flight from Miami to Los Angeles, she [...] "saw Michael licking Gavin's head" [...] while he was asleep. Before she testified about it, {{she turned to the}} jury and said, [...] "please don't judge me." [...] Jackson {{allegedly}} had an arm around the boy and licked his hair [...] "over and over" [...] while everyone else on the plane was asleep. Janet said she didn't tell any one what she'd seen, and she continued to let her children stay at Neverland, and she later testified that at a point weeks after that incident, she still didn't have [...] "any concerns about Mr. Jackson at all". Star contradicted his mother when he testified that he had been awake to also witness Jackson lick Gavin's head on the plane; he didn't say anyone was asleep, just that the accuser was not feeling well and had leaned against Jackson's chest. Cynthia Bell, a flight attendant on that flight, said she had not seen Jackson [...] "cuddling" [...] with Arvizo during the flight, but testified that she had seen Jackson <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> the accuser while he was listening to music.|$|E
2500|$|On D-Day, June 6, 1944, Schroeder was a 25-year-old {{captain in}} command of the 219men of Company F of the 2nd Battalion, 8th Infantry Regiment, 4th Infantry Division. The 8th Infantry Regiment was ordered to make the initial D-Day landing on Utah Beach as part of the invasion. [...] As they sailed to France from England on the night of June5 aboard the navy's USS Barnett on the rough English channel, they heard Supreme Allied Commander General Dwight D. Eisenhower's exhortation to the troops over the radio, [...] "Together, we shall achieve victory". Afterwards, the company commanders were summoned by the 2nd Battalion commander, Lieutenant Colonel Carlton MacNeely, to Brigadier General Theodore Roosevelt, Jr.'s {{quarters}} for a final briefing before the invasion. When the meeting ended near midnight, Schroeder later recounted, the officers [...] "wished each other well and shook hands", and MacNeely <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> Schroeder's shoulders. Addressing the young captain by his nickname, [...] "Moose", MacNeely said, [...] "Well, Moose, this is it. Give 'em hell!" [...] Schroeder said they both [...] "choked up" [...] and he replied, [...] "Well, colonel, I'll see you on the beach!" [...] Roosevelt said, [...] "Moose, take me in your boat when you go ashore". At 2:30a.m. on June 6, Schroeder's company left the Barnett to board their LCVP landing craft. Before departing the Barnett to face the enemy, Schroeder wrote a letter to his wife: [...] "I told her where I was, what I was about to do, and how much I loved her".|$|E

2500|$|In 1996, the Los Angeles Lakers {{acquired}} the draft rights {{to high school}} player Kobe Bryant from the Charlotte Hornets by trading established center Vlade Divac. No NBA team had previously drafted a guard straight from high school. After freeing up salary by parting with other veteran players, they signed free agent All-Star center Shaquille O'Neal later that year. The two sparred in their first three seasons playing together from 1996–1999. [...] Bryant kept his teammates at a distance, answering non-basketball questions with one- or two-word responses. O'Neal told the Lakers when Bryant arrived, [...] "I'm not gonna be babysitting." [...] Bryant had extreme confidence in his ability, which was unusual for an 18-year-old. Some teammates interpreted Bryant's confidence as arrogance. O'Neal was wary of Bryant, as a rookie, boasting that he would lead the Lakers in scoring and be {{the best player in}} the league. Lakers general manager Jerry West criticized O'Neal's leadership for hazing Bryant that season. While O'Neal's personality was good-humored, Bryant's demeanor was all-business and was interpreted by some teammates as selfishness. O'Neal began calling Bryant showboat because of his flashy offensive moves. In an overtime playoff loss to the Utah Jazz that eliminated the Lakers, O'Neal fouled out with two minutes remaining in regulation. Lakers coach Del Harris had designed the Laker offense around the rookie Bryant, who went on to shoot four air balls. Harris explained that Bryant's one-on-one skills made him the best choice. After the game, O'Neal <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> Bryant and told him there would be other opportunities. West said the team's shortcoming made O'Neal angry since he was going to be judged by the team's success.|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the {{majority}} of the Doctor's companions are young, attractive females, the production team for the 1963–89 series maintained a long-standing taboo against any overt romantic involvement in the TARDIS: for example, Peter Davison, as the Fifth Doctor, was not allowed to <b>put</b> <b>his</b> <b>arm</b> <b>around</b> either Sarah Sutton (Nyssa) or Janet Fielding (Tegan Jovanka). However, that has not prevented fans from speculating about possible romantic involvements, most notably between the Fourth Doctor and the Time Lady Romana (whose actors, Tom Baker and Lalla Ward, shared a romance and brief marriage). The taboo was controversially broken in the 1996 television movie when the Eighth Doctor was shown kissing companion Grace Holloway. The 2005 series played with this idea by having various characters think that the Ninth Doctor and Rose Tyler were a couple, which they vehemently denied. Since the series revival, the Doctor has kissed many of his companions, including Rose and Jack, although each instance was not necessarily in a romantic context (see also [...] "The Doctor and romance"). Donna Noble vehemently denied a sexual interest in the Doctor when he invited her to join him and explained, [...] "I just want a mate," [...] which she misheard as [...] "I just want to mate." [...] Rose and Martha each developed romantic feelings toward the Doctor. On the opposite side of the same coin, Amy reacted to the stress of her adventures by very aggressively trying to seduce the Doctor on the eve of her own wedding, despite being in love with her fiancé Rory; the Doctor forcibly pushed her off of himself, though she did not immediately cease her pursuit. The Eleventh Doctor romantically kissed Amy and Rory's daughter, sporadic companion River Song, jokingly proposed marriage to her, and soon married her.|$|E
