50|$|Since ACE {{introduced}} its valve many companies have engineered their own versions. Though {{many of the}} products available vary in features and applicability, the fundamental design is the same. When the pressure inside the container drops below a set point, a valve opens and allows the blanketing gas to enter. Once the pressure reaches the set point, the valve closes. As a safety feature, many systems include a <b>pressure</b> <b>vent</b> that opens when the pressure inside exceeds a maximum pressure set point. This helps to prevent the container from rupturing due to high pressure. Since most blanketing gas sources will provide gas {{at a much higher}} than desired pressure, a blanketing system will also use a pressure reducing valve to decrease the inlet pressure to the tank.|$|E

Aim: to evaluate tinnitus after one month use of BTE hearing aids with open molds and <b>pressure</b> <b>vent</b> molds in patients with symmetric sensorineural hearing loss. Methods: 50 patients seen at our Tinnitus Clinic who presented bilateral tinnitus and hearing loss underwent a randomized blind crossover clinical trial: 26 first used BTE hearing aids with open molds, and the remaining 24 first used <b>pressure</b> <b>vent</b> molds. After 30 days using the first mold and a wash-out period, the type of earmold was changed and was applied for another 30 -day-period. Tinnitus evaluation was done qualitatively (improved, unchanged and worsened) and quantitatively (variation on a numeric scale from 0 to 10). Results: 82 % of the cases reported improvement of tinnitus {{with at least one}} type of earmold; {{there was no significant difference}} in the reduction of discomfort due to tinnitus in the quantitative and qualitative evaluations. Although similar tinnitus control was obtained with both methods, 66 % of the patients preferred the open mold. Conclusion: In a short-term evaluation improvement of tinnitus by the use of hearing aids does not depend on earmold ventilation...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of RETIMET metal foam as a flame arrester on explosion-proof enclosures was {{investigated by the}} U. S. Bureau of Mines both in laboratory tests and at the U. S.

The objective {{of this research was}} to develop a permissible <b>pressure</b> <b>vent</b> for use on lightweight, vented, explosion- proof enclosures. In laboratory tests, four grades of RETIMET, a stainless steel foam material, were evaluated: (1) 45 NC- 7, (2) 45 NC- 13, (3) 80 NC- 7, and (4) 80 NC- 13. Explosive gas mixtures were prepared by a dynamic flow system. Ignition was by a low-voltage arc. Each grade of RETIMET metal foam successfully arrested the flame front in all methane-air tests. To evaluate RETIMET metal foam on large, commercial size enclosures, a multicompartmented enclosure was designed and tested in MSHA's explosion gallery in Triadelphia, WV. Extensive explosion testing revealed that a minimum vent-area-to-enclosure-volume ratio of 11. 33 in 2 /ft 3 is required to keep internal pressure rises below 3 psig. The RETIMET metal foam functioned satisfactorily in all tests as evidenced by the absence of external ignitions...|$|E
40|$|In {{recent years}} {{interest}} {{has grown in}} the use of composite components within the automotive industry. Fibre reinforced plastic (FRP) components are of particular interest to the industry, since lower tooling costs and part consolidation can be utilised, whilst lighter, stiffer components can be produced. Several methods are available to produce FRP components at high volumes, including compression moulding (using dough and sheet moulding compounds), reinforced reaction injection moulding (RRIM) and liquid moulding processes (resin transfer moulding (RTM) and structural reaction injection moulding (SRIM)). RTM is a closed mould process, which is widely used to produce components economically in low volumes using matched moulds to produce two good surfaces. The absence of a high volume manufacturing technology, however, has impeded the acceptance and advance of RTM within the automotive industry. A research programme was established at the University of Nottingham to address the problems {{associated with the use of}} RTM for high volume manufacture. This programme has considered the topics of process technology, processing characteristics of polyester resin systems and fibre preforms, fibre wet-out and interfacial bonding, mould design, microwave pre-heating of reactive resin systems and process modelling. This thesis concerns the research which was undertaken to identify the causes of void formation during the impregnation and polymerisation stages of RTM, and methods of reducing the final void content within the component. The impregnation phase of the RTM process was identified as being the stage where the majority of voids were formed. A study of oil impregnation (having a similar viscosity to that of resin) into reinforcement was undertaken to determine the reasons for uneven flow and air entrapment. The dry reinforcements were studied to assess the microstructure of the preforms in order to determine reasons for obstruction of the resin flow. Fabric stitching, thermoplastic binder and size deposits were identified as potential causes of flow impediment. Fibre orientation and preform stacking were also assumed to assist in the development of uneven flow, leading to air entrapment. A major factor determining the formation of microvoids within fibre bundles was identified as the transverse impregnation of resin into high Tex fibre bundles. The major moulding process variables of injection <b>pressure,</b> <b>vent</b> pressure, fibre volume fraction, mould temperature and resin pre-heating have been assessed, to determine their effect on the void content within unidirectional and CFRM reinforced polyester laminates. It was observed that vacuum assistance during impregnation reduced void formation, although higher exotherm pressures and the possibility of monomer boiling arise from its use. A simple impregnation model was developed to assess the microscopic impregnation rates between fibre bundles, in the capillary between fibres and transversely into fibre bundles. The results from this model were compared with actual moulding histories. The findings of the overall work are discussed and suggestions proposed for the reduction of void content in RTM automotive components...|$|E

40|$|Ventilation {{might seem}} like a minor consideration, but when {{properly}} installed, it can {{extend the life of}} the attic and roof structure of residential buildings saving huge dollar amounts in repair costs. The objectives of this study were to measure the wind effect on different kind of vents as the problem is vents are subjected to high wind loads during hurricane events and often fail causing water penetration and damage of interior contents. Wind-induced failure of rooftop vents during a hurricane may result in large openings in the roof that will allow water to penetrate into the building, a puncturing of the roof membrane, again allowing water infiltration, and detached rooftop vents can pose considerable threats as windborne debris. The study found that water infiltration through a vent system is dependent upon the differential pressure as well as the vent mechanism.

40|$|Automated water-level data {{collected}} using <b>vented</b> <b>pressure</b> transducers deployed in Hanford Site Central Plateau wells commonly display more variability than manual tape measurements {{in response to}} barometric pressure fluctuations. To explain this difference, {{it was hypothesized that}} <b>vented</b> <b>pressure</b> transducers installed in some wells are subject to barometric pressure effects that reduce water-level measurement accuracy. <b>Vented</b> <b>pressure</b> transducers use a vent tube, which is open to the atmosphere at land surface, to supply air pressure to the transducer housing for barometric compensation so the transducer measurements will represent only the water <b>pressure.</b> When using <b>vented</b> transducers, the assumption is made that the air pressure between land surface and the well bore is in equilibrium. By comparison, absolute pressure transducers directly measure the air pressure within the wellbore. Barometric compensation is achieved by subtracting the well bore air pressure measurement from the total pressure measured by a second transducer submerged in the water. Thus, no assumption of air pressure equilibrium is needed. In this study, water-level measurements were collected from the same Central Plateau wells using both <b>vented</b> and absolute <b>pressure</b> transducers to evaluate the different methods of barometric compensation. Manual tape measurements were also collected to evaluate the transducers. Measurements collected during this study demonstrated that the <b>vented</b> <b>pressure</b> transducers over-responded to barometric pressure fluctuations due to a pressure disequilibrium between the air within the wellbores and the atmosphere at land surface. The disequilibrium is thought to be caused by the relatively long time required for barometric pressure changes to equilibrate between land surface and the deep vadose zone and may be exacerbated by the restriction of air flow between the well bore and the atmosphere due to the presence of sample pump landing plates and well caps. The disequilibrium is likely limited to wells screened across the water table (i. e., open to the deep vadose zone) where the depth to water is large or a low-permeability layer occurs in the vadose zone. Such wells are a pathway for air movement between the deep vadose zone and land surface and this sustains the pressure disequilibrium between the well bore and the atmosphere for longer time periods. Barometric over-response was not observed with the absolute pressure transducers because barometric compensation was achieved by directly measuring the air pressure within the well. Users of <b>vented</b> <b>pressure</b> transducers {{should be aware of the}} over-response issue in certain Hanford Site wells and ascertain if it will affect the use of the data. Pressure disequilibrium between the well and the atmosphere can be identified by substantial air movement through the wellbore. In wells exhibiting pressure disequilibrium, it is recommended that absolute pressure transducers be used rather than vented transducers for applications that require precise automated determinations of well water-level changes in response to barometric pressure fluctuations...|$|R
