5|$|As Finland was {{negotiating}} with the Soviet Union for peace, the Oberkommando des Heeres <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Narva front, using every means to convince the Finnish Defence Command that their defence was going to hold. The German command informed their Finnish colleagues in detail about the events on the Narva front while a delegation of the Finnish Defence Command visited Narva in spring 1944. Besides being a narrow corridor well suited for defence, the terrain {{in the area of}} Narva was dominated by forests and swamps. Directly behind the Narva River lay the city itself, ideally positioned as a bastion from which defending forces could influence combat to both the north and south of the city along the river valley.|$|E
5|$|In 1795, Rebecca and {{he moved}} back to Kentucky, living in present Nicholas County on land owned by their son Daniel Morgan Boone. The next year, Boone applied to Isaac Shelby, the first {{governor}} of the new state of Kentucky, for a contract to widen the Wilderness Road into a wagon route, but the contract was awarded to someone else. Meanwhile, lawsuits over conflicting land claims continued {{to make their way}} through the Kentucky courts. Boone's remaining land claims were sold off to pay legal fees and taxes, but he no longer <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> process. In 1798, a warrant was issued for Boone's arrest after he ignored a summons to testify in a court case, although the sheriff never found him. That same year, the Kentucky assembly named Boone County in his honor.|$|E

5|$|In the 680s, Justinian II (685–695 and 705–711) <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> {{needs of}} the navy, {{strengthening}} it by the resettlement of over 18,500 Mardaites along the southern coasts of the Empire, where they were employed as marines and rowers. Nevertheless, the Arab naval threat intensified as they gradually took control of North Africa in the 680s and 690s. The last Byzantine stronghold, Carthage, fell in 698, although a Byzantine naval expedition managed to briefly retake it. The Arab governor Musa bin Nusair built a new city and naval base at Tunis, and 1,000 Coptic shipwrights were brought to construct a new fleet, which would challenge Byzantine control of the western Mediterranean. Thus, from the early 8th century on, Muslim raids unfolded unceasingly against Byzantine holdings in the Western Mediterranean, especially Sicily. In addition, the new fleet would allow the Muslims to complete their conquest of the Maghreb and to successfully invade and capture most of the Visigoth-controlled Iberian Peninsula.|$|E
5|$|Annoyed {{that none}} of his {{co-workers}} <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fire safety seminar he gave last week, Dwight (Rainn Wilson) tries another approach by sealing the office exits shut, cutting the phone lines and starting a fire in a trash can. Dwight calmly explains the proper safety procedures as the panicked employees try to flee, smashing windows, crawling through air ducts and destroying office equipment. Dwight eventually reveals {{it was just a}} drill, but Stanley (Leslie David Baker) suffers a heart attack and collapses in the commotion. Dwight is subsequently censured by Dunder Mifflin CFO David Wallace (Andy Buckley), and Michael (Steve Carell) strips him of his position as safety officer. After Stanley is released from the hospital, his doctors warn him to keep his stress levels under control to avoid further damaging his health. Michael arranges for a CPR training session for the employees, but they are too easily distracted and the lesson proves fruitless. The session ends badly when Dwight destroys the expensive CPR dummy, earning another rebuke from David Wallace. Dwight is ordered to apologize to his co-workers and get signatures acknowledging that they forgive him, but after he openly declares that his apology is insincere and denies that he is responsible for Stanley's heart attack, they refuse to sign.|$|E

His stay amidst the African wildlife also further stimulated his interest in zoos.

25|$|Among early 20th-century English {{artists who}} have more {{specially}} <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> devising of bookplates, may be mentioned C. W. Sherborn, G. W. Eve, Robert Anning Bell, J. D. Batten, Erat Harrison, J. Forbes Nixon, Charles Ricketts, John Vinycomb, John Leighton and Warrington Hogg and Frank C. Papé. The development in various directions of process work, by facilitating and cheapening the reproduction of beautiful and elaborate designs, has no doubt helped much to popularize the bookplate—a thing which in older days was almost invariably restricted to ancestral libraries or to collections otherwise important. Thus {{the great majority of}} plates of the period 1880–1920 plates were reproduced by process. Some artists continued to work with the graver. Some of the work they produce challenges comparison with the finest productions of bygone engravers. Of these the best-known are C. W. Sherborn (see Plate) and G. W. Eve in England, and in America J. W. Spenceley of Boston, Mass., K. W. F. Hopson of New Haven, Conn., and E. D. French of New York City.|$|E

Following this experience, Ogboh <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> interaction of sounds in Lagos as compositions rather than individual voices. Ogboh compared the soundscapes to orchestra symphonies, with layered voices rather than strictly chaotic noise. He also appreciated the soundscape's ability to [...] "transport the listener" [...] and found the sound medium most engaging.|$|E
500|$|According to author Malcolm Gladwell, [...] "Sesame Street {{was built}} around a single, {{breakthrough}} insight: {{that if you can}} hold the attention of children, you can educate them". [...] Gerald S. Lesser, the first chair of the advisory board of the Children's Television Workshop (the CTW, or [...] "the Workshop"), the organization that oversaw the show's production, stated that to be effective as an educational tool, television needed to capture, focus, and sustain children's attention. [...] Sesame Street was the first children's show that <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> structure of each episode and made [...] "small but critical adjustments" [...] to each segment to capture children's attention.|$|E
500|$|Because of Bach's liturgical designation, the {{performance}} can be precisely dated to 2 December 1714. As , director of {{music of the}} main churches of Leipzig, Bach performed the cantata again on 28 November 1723, beginning the first liturgical year in the new position. Bach <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> exceptional occasion at beginning of the liturgical year, also when he composed later the chorale cantata Nun komm, der Heiden Heiland, BWV 62 (1724), and Schwingt freudig euch empor, BWV 36 (1731), which are all inspired by Luther's hymn. Bach also began his [...] by a setting of the same tune. In Leipzig, the first Sunday in Advent was the last chance to hear cantata music before Christmas, because tempus clausum was observed during Advent.|$|E

500|$|According to Zwingli, the {{cornerstone}} of theology is the Bible. Zwingli appealed to scripture constantly in his writings. He placed its authority above other sources such as the ecumenical councils or the Church Fathers, {{although he did not}} hesitate to use other sources to support his arguments. The principles that guide Zwingli's interpretations are derived from his rationalist humanist education and his Reformed understanding of the Bible. He rejected literalist interpretations of a passage, such as those of the Anabaptists, and used synecdoche [...] and analogies, methods he describes in A Friendly Exegesis (1527). Two analogies that he used quite effectively were between baptism and circumcision and between the eucharist and Passover. He also <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> immediate context and attempted to understand the purpose behind it, comparing passages of scripture with each other.|$|E

In a [...] "Live TV"(Russian: [...] "Прямой Эфир") show aired on September 30, 2013, by Rossiya 1 TV channel, Maria Alyokhina pledged to do no more shows at churches. [...] "We've <b>paid</b> <b>attention</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fact that, as it turns out, since 2013 this has been a criminal offense, and we've repeatedly heard opinions from people whom we take seriously. This is basically the reason why we wouldn't go to the Cathedral of Christ the Savior again – or, unquestionably, to any other church for that matter," [...] Alyokhina said.|$|E
500|$|When he was 12 years old, Brodeur briefly {{intended}} to stop playing hockey, {{after he had}} been removed from his team's lineup for not showing up at a game.

While playing with the Saint-Hyacinthe Laser, Brodeur made the QMJHL All-Rookie team in 1989–90 and the QMJHL 2nd All-Star Team in 1991–92.
