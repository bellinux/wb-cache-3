50|$|Nylon 66 (aka nylon 6-6, nylon 6/6 or nylon 6,6) {{is a type}} of <b>polyamide</b> <b>or</b> <b>nylon.</b> There {{are many}} types of nylon: the two most common for textile and {{plastics}} industries are nylon 6 and nylon 66. Nylon 66 is made of two monomers each containing 6 carbon atoms, hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid, which give nylon 66 its name.|$|E
5000|$|Nylon 1,6 (aka {{polyamide}} 1,6) {{is a type}} of <b>polyamide</b> <b>or</b> <b>nylon.</b> Unlike {{most other}} nylons, nylon 1,6 is not a condensation polymer, but instead is formed by an acid-catalyzed synthesis from adiponitrile, formaldehyde, and water. The material was produced and studied by researchers at DuPont in the 1950s. [...] Synthesis can be performed at room temperature in open beakers.|$|E
5000|$|Nylon 46 {{is a type}} of <b>polyamide</b> <b>or</b> <b>nylon.</b> DSM is {{the only}} {{commercial}} supplier of this resin, under the brand [...] "Stanyl". It has a higher melting point than nylon 6 or nylon 66 so is useful in applications which must withstand high temperatures even for a short while. The diamine monomer (putrescine) can be readily obtained from biomass.|$|E

40|$|<b>Polyamides,</b> <b>or</b> <b>nylon,</b> {{are widely}} used in fiber and {{engineering}} plastic materials, due to their good mechanical and thermal properties. Synthesis of oligomers from nylon- 4, 10, nylon- 6, 10, and nylon- 8, 10 were performed via polycondensation of diamines (1, 4 -butanediamine, 1, 6 -hexanediamine, and 1, 8 -diaminooctane) and diester (diethyl sebacate). These reactions were catalyzed by immobilized cutinase from Fusarium solani pisi on Lewatit beads, cutinase {{in the form of}} cross-linked enzyme aggregates (CLEA), or by immobilized Lipase B from Candida antarctica (N 435). The highest maximal degree of polymerization (DPmax), up to 16, can be achieved in the synthesis of nylon- 8, 10 catalyzed by CLEA cutinase in diphenyl ether at 70 °C. By performing a reaction at cutinase optimal temperature (70 °C), CLEA cutinase in the synthesis of nylons shows good catalytic activity, like N 435. ...|$|R
5000|$|A {{molecule}} {{can have}} more than one acyl halide functional group. For example, [...] "adipoyl dichloride", usually simply called adipoyl chloride, has two acyl chloride functional groups; see the structure at right. It is the dichloride (i.e., double chloride) of the 6-carbon dicarboxylic acid adipic acid. An important use of adipoyl chloride is polymerization with an organic di-amino compound to form a <b>polyamide</b> called <b>nylon</b> <b>or</b> polymerization with certain other organic compounds to form polyesters.|$|R
40|$|The first Engineering Plastics are <b>Polyamides</b> <b>or</b> <b>nylons</b> {{and still}} {{represent}} {{the biggest and}} most significant class of these types of material. Nylon- 6 and nylon- 6, 6 are the first two commercial polyamides and are still the most important polyamides with respect to their production volumes. Modeling Nylon 6 polymerization process from first principle constitutes serious computational challenges due to the non-linear nature of the process. This work therefore developed simplified model for the process using time series modeling techniques. The steady state simulation was done using ASPEN polymer plus to measure the effect of the input variable on the outputs. The input variable was the temperature of water feed and the output variable were Caprolactam conversion, mass fraction of nylon produced in the product stream and mass flow rate of nylon 6. The steady state flow sheet was then exported to ASPEN dynamics to generate dynamic data needed for the process identification generated. The data generated from ASPEN dynamics were exported into the MATLAB environment in order to identify the process model. The two time series modeling techniques used are Nonlinear Auto Regressive with exogenous input (NARX) model and Hammerstein and Weiner model. The models developed using NARX model of the structure (10, 7, 1) for conversion gave a best fit of 71. 78 % while the one for mass flow rate of Nylon produced using structure (2, 2, 1) gave a best fit of 88. 36 % and that of produced Nylon 6 mass fraction using the structure (5, 5, 1) gave a best fit of 75. 33 %. The models developed using Hammerstein and Weiner for the Nylon mass fraction in the product stream using input nonlinear estimator o...|$|R
30|$|The {{continuous}} {{advances in}} organic chemistry, {{especially with the}} apparition of polymer chemistry discipline, enable the fabrication of synthetic fibers which are made from polymers or small molecules, being the petroleum {{as the most important}} raw material. Among the high amount of different types of synthetic fibers, the most known are polyamide, polyester, acrylic, and polyolefin. Within these four types, the polyamide (especially PA 6, known as <b>polyamide</b> 6 <b>or</b> <b>nylon)</b> and polyesters (especially PET, known as polyethylene terephthalate) are the most used in the textile industry. This section is focused on the development of functionalized synthetic fibers, concretely polyamide and polyester fabrics. In general, these fabrics show poor wettability properties and hydrophobicity in nature which can affect the polymer processability and also fiber dyebility [7]. With the development of the nanotechnology, different types of nanoparticles (mostly inorganic or metal oxide) have been successfully incorporated into synthetic fibers in order to obtain functionalized fibers with special properties [8 – 11]. The major effects such as flame retardancy, antibacterial activity, or superhydrophobicity are presented in detail using different deposition techniques. In addition, special emphasis is oriented to the surface modification fabrics in order to improve the adhesion of the nanoparticles and obtain functionalized synthetic fibers with the desired properties. Finally, it also discussed the importance of controlling particles size as well as their corresponding shape because both phenomena are of vital importance to the final and desired function imparted to the fibers.|$|R
40|$|Two {{hundred and}} thirty three {{patients}} with major laparotomy wounds, either midline or transverse, were randomly allocated to mass closure using No 1 (BPC) <b>polyamide</b> (<b>Nylon)</b> <b>or</b> polydioxanone suture (PDS). Wounds were assessed during the hospital stay and postoperatively in outpatients, at six weeks and six months, for evidence of wound failure or wound infection. Two wound failures occurred in the PDS group (one burst abdomen and one incisional hernia) although neither was directly attributable to suture failure. The overall wound infection rate was 13. 3 %; 2. 9 % being major infections and the majority (two thirds) occurring in the PDS group. There were no reported wound sinuses or wound pain in either group at six months. Polydioxanone suture may be an alternative to polyamide for laparotomy closure but {{is associated with a}} higher, though not statistically significant, incidence of wound failure and infection...|$|R
40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in producing polymers from bio-based resources as alternatives for fossil resources. One {{of the most common}} engineering plastics, polyamides, can be produced from monomers of fossil or renewable origin, such as renewable oils and fats The major drawbacks of polyamides include low molecular weight and poor water stability. The aim of this thesis was to synthesize and characterize long aliphatic segment polyamides by using long chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids as monomers.. A further objective was to synthesize and characterize novel sulphur-containing polyamides. The monomer of sulfur-containing polyamide was prepared from 10 -undecenoic acid via thiol-ene addition reaction. All polyamides were synthesised via polycondenzation. All long aliphatic polyamides were synthesized successfully with high molecular weight ranges from 37 000 - 54 000 g/mol. Crucial factors necessary for obtaining high-molecular weight polyamides were identified. The water stabilities of novel polyamides were superior to commercial counterparts, while the presence of sulphur within the polyamide chain enhanced chemical resistance measured as reduced solubility in a range of solvents. All prepared polyamides were fully characterized (NMR, DSC, DMA, Tensile Test, and TGA) and the results of these investigations will be discussed within this thesis. The thermal analyses of these polyamides revealed melting points in the range from 128 to 207 oC which are rather low compared to the commercial <b>polyamides,</b> <b>Nylon</b> 6 <b>or</b> <b>Nylon</b> 6 / 6, while the thermal degradation temperature was enhanced...|$|R
