40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{an analysis of}} five long vowel sounds of Sinhala language, carried out using non-linear techniques. The vowel sounds recorded at 8 kHz sampling rate with 16 -bit resolution from {{both male and female}} speakers were analyzed by reconstructing the <b>phase</b> <b>portraits</b> using the SVD embedding technique. The required embedding dimension was determined using the false nearest neighbour method. The reconstructed <b>phase</b> <b>portraits</b> were compared with the position of these vowels in the International Phonetic Association (IPA) formant charts. In addition, in order to check the presence of chaos, the Lyapunov exponents of the recorded sounds were calculated. The results indicate that the speech production system can be modeled using just three dimensions and that the five vowels analyzed can be identified by their geometries in the embedded <b>phase</b> <b>portraits.</b> A correlation exists between their geometry and the position in the IPA formant charts. A comparison of <b>phase</b> <b>portraits</b> with frequency spectra showed the existence of bifurcations. Both positive and negative Lyapunov exponents were found, indicating the presence of chaos...|$|R

The approach uses an analysis of <b>phase</b> <b>portraits.</b> The so-called <b>phase</b> <b>portraits</b> are graphical representations of a system dynamics in two-dimensional space of a value and its time derivative. Variations in quantity and stability of steady state points (where the derivative is zero) can easily produce different <b>phase</b> <b>portraits</b> that may be interpreted and analyzed in terms of dynamics of learning of an individual. With the help of the analysis six basic types of individuals have been defined and described: «all and now», degradation, non-learning, self-learning, threshold, culture norm. Possible implications of the analysis for research of learning are discussed...|$|R

40|$|In the {{qualitative}} theory of ordinary differential equations, {{we can find}} many papers whose objective is the classification of all the possible topological <b>phase</b> <b>portraits</b> of a given family of differential system. Most of the studies rely on systems with real parameters and the study consists of outlining their <b>phase</b> <b>portraits</b> by finding out some conditions on the parameters. Here, we studied a susceptible-infected-susceptible (SIS) model described by the differential system ẋ=-bxy-mx+cy+mk, ẏ=bxy-(m+c) y, where b, c, k, m are real parameters with b ≠ 0, m ≠ 0 (see Brauer (2002). Such system describes an infectious disease from which infected people recover with immunity against reinfection.

40|$|Polarimetric {{studies of}} pulsar radio {{emission}} traditionally concentrate {{on how the}} Stokes vector (I, Q, U, V) varies with pulse longitude, with special emphasis on the position angle (PA) swing of the linearly polarized component. The interpretation of the PA swing {{in terms of the}} rotating vector model is limited by the assumption of an axisymmetric magnetic field and the degeneracy of the output with respect to the orientation and magnetic geometry of the pulsar; different combinations of the latter two properties can produce similar PA swings. This paper introduces Stokes <b>phase</b> <b>portraits</b> as a supplementary diagnostic tool with which the orientation and magnetic geometry can be inferred more accurately. The Stokes <b>phase</b> <b>portraits</b> feature unique patterns in the I-Q, I-U, and Q-U planes, whose shapes depend sensitively on the magnetic geometry, inclination angle, beam and polarization patterns, and emission altitude. We construct look-up tables of Stokes <b>phase</b> <b>portraits</b> and PA swings for pure and current-modified dipole fields, filled core and hollow cone beams, and two empirical linear polarization models, L/I = cosθ_ 0 and L/I = sinθ_ 0, where θ_ 0 is the colatitude of the emission point. We compare our look-up tables to the measured <b>phase</b> <b>portraits</b> of 24 pulsars in the European Pulsar Network online database. We find evidence in 60...|$|R
