50|$|When Sarmanian {{launched}} the company, most computer and electronics manufacturers were fabricating their own boards. Independent suppliers, however, became increasingly efficient and were proving a more cost-effective solution {{for a broad}} range of <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> applications. Likewise, computer and electronics manufacturers became more comfortable using suppliers for key electronic components, including <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards.</b> Reductions in time to market, engineering/prototyping costs, and manufacturing ramp-up costs were being demonstrated by these suppliers to win business. In 1979, 40% of all rigid <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> fabrication was being outsourced to suppliers like PCC. By 1989, that figure was about 60%, and by 1995, 80%. By 2001, 98% of all <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> production was going to external suppliers.

Owing to the diversity of materials and components, the separation process is difficult, which results in complex and expensive recovery of precious materials and electronic components from waste <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards.</b> To cope with this problem, we proposed an innovative approach integrating Theory of Inventive Problem Solving (TRIZ) evolution theory and technology maturity mapping system to forecast the evolution trends of desoldering technology of waste <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards.</b> This approach can be applied to analyse the technology evolution, as well as desoldering technology evolution, then research and development strategy and evolution laws can be recommended.

There are m different <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards</b> to be processed. As an automated manipulator embeds electronic parts in a <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>board</b> from above, n identical pins from underneath protect it against overbending.

A single grasp-and-delivery robot transfers the pins one by one to arrange them from a configuration to another one. Given an initial configuration of pins and a permutable set of m required configurations, our repetitive routing problem asks to find a configuration sequence, i. e., a processing order of m <b>printed</b> <b>circuit</b> <b>boards,</b> and a transfer route of the grasp-and-delivery robot so that the route length over all m transitions is minimized.
