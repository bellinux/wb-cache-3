5000|$|Carriers that {{participate}} in airline alliances such as Star Alliance, SkyTeam or oneworld, almost always have interline agreements with each other. However even direct competitors {{can benefit from}} interline agreements. When a ticket is issued for an interline itinerary, one of the airlines in that itinerary will be selected by the ticketing agent as the issuing airline, {{commonly referred to as}} the [...] "plating carrier". The <b>plating</b> <b>carrier</b> collects the entire fare from the customer, either via own sales channels (e.g., web site or ticket office), or via travel agents. Travel agent remit collected fare and taxes to the <b>plating</b> <b>carrier</b> via Airlines Reporting Corporation (ARC) in the US, or Billing and Settlement Plan (BSP) in rest of the world. The airline which actually carried the passenger (the operating airline) will send an invoice to the issuing/plating carrier, normally via IATA Clearing House, to collect its portion of fare and taxes. The operating airline is responsible for remitting passenger taxes to the various government and airports. Some taxes are sales based (US taxes), and shall be remitted by the issuing airline.|$|R

Other gear worn or carried by the operators included a variety of <b>plate</b> <b>carriers,</b> Ops Core FAST Maritime ballistic helmets, chemlights, hand grenades, breaching tools, and night-vision goggles. The particular night vision device used by the SEALs, the GPNVG-18, was unlike any standard night vision goggle offered to servicemen, and featured four-tubes for a much better field of view.|$|R
50|$|Variant {{originally}} {{adopted by}} the U.S. Air Force. This was the first M16 adopted operationally, originally by the U.S. AirForce. This variant had triangular handguards, butt stocks without a compartment for the storage of a cleaning kit, a three-pronged flash suppressor, full auto, and no forward assist. Bolt carriers were originally chrome plated and slick-sided, lacking forward assist notches. Later, the chrome <b>plated</b> <b>carriers</b> were dropped in favor of Army issued notched and parkerized carriers though the interior portion of the bolt carrier is still chrome-lined. The Air Force continued to operate these weapons until around 2001, at which time the Air Force converted all of its M16s to the M16A2 configuration.|$|R
5000|$|This vest {{was unique}} in its quick release system, {{allowing}} the Marine to ditch the entire vest very quickly {{in case of}} emergency. This quick release feature, also used with newer modular <b>plate</b> <b>carriers</b> such as the Paraclete Releasable Assault Vest, was developed {{in response to a}} 9 December 1999 CH-46E Sea Knight helicopter crash over the Pacific. Several members of 5th Platoon, 1st Force Reconnaissance Company drowned [...] because they could not eject their heavy armor in time to swim away. [...] Only one Marine was able to successfully ditch his equipment and survive.

40|$|Planetary {{gear train}} plays a {{significant}} role in a helicopter operation and its health is of great importance for the flight safety of the helicopter. This paper investigates the effects of a planet <b>carrier</b> <b>plate</b> crack on the dynamic characteristics of a planetary gear train, and thus finds an effective method to diagnose crack fault. A dynamic model is developed to analyze the torsional vibration of a planetary gear train with a cracked planet <b>carrier</b> <b>plate.</b> The model takes into consideration nonlinear factors such as the time-varying meshing stiffness, gear backlash and viscous damping. Investigation of the deformation of the cracked <b>carrier</b> <b>plate</b> under static stress is performed in order to simulate the dynamic effects of the planet carrier crack on the angular displacement of carrier posts. Validation shows good accuracy of the developed dynamic model in predicting dynamic characteristics of a planetary gear train. Fault features extracted from predictions of the model reveal the correspondence between vibration characteristic and the conditions (length and position) of a planet carrier crack clearly...|$|R

50|$|In July 2013, the Marines {{announced}} it will buy 3,800 Improved Modular Tactical Vests. The IMTV is made for smaller stature Marines who cannot wear the full-sized MTV comfortably.

Most Marines use the Scalable <b>Plate</b> <b>Carrier</b> in the field, so {{it is hoped that}} the additional sizes will encourage Marines to wear the IMTV in combat. The Corps does not want to design female-specific body armor, and has found that the issue was different statures related to the length of the torso.

40|$|Abstract The {{modularization}} {{accomplished a}} big contribution in cost down and assembly-time shortening {{and the quality}} increase.
