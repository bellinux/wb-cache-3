25|$|Some {{loudspeaker}} designs use {{a combination}} of passive and active crossover filtering, such as a <b>passive</b> <b>crossover</b> between the mid- and high-frequency drivers and an active crossover between the low-frequency driver and the combined mid- and high frequencies.|$|E
25|$|They {{generally}} are limited at {{the extremes of}} the hearing spectrum (e.g. below 20Hz and above 16kHz) and require a better seal than other types of drivers to deliver their full potential. Higher-end models may employ multiple armature drivers, dividing the frequency ranges between them using a <b>passive</b> <b>crossover</b> network. A few combine an armature driver with a small moving-coil driver for increased bass output.|$|E
25|$|The load that {{a driver}} {{presents}} to an amplifier {{consists of a}} complex electrical impedanceâ€”a combination of resistance and both capacitive and inductive reactance, which combines properties of the driver, its mechanical motion, the effects of crossover components (if any are in the signal path between amplifier and driver), {{and the effects of}} air loading on the driver as modified by the enclosure and its environment. Most amplifiers' output specifications are given at a specific power into an ideal resistive load; however, a loudspeaker does not have a constant impedance across its frequency range. Instead, the voice coil is inductive, the driver has mechanical resonances, the enclosure changes the driver's electrical and mechanical characteristics, and a <b>passive</b> <b>crossover</b> between the drivers and the amplifier contributes its own variations. The result is a load impedance that varies widely with frequency, and usually a varying phase relationship between voltage and current as well, also changing with frequency. Some amplifiers can cope with the variation better than others can.|$|E
5000|$|Inexpensive {{consumer}} electronics products, such as budget-priced Home theater {{in a box}} packages and low-cost boom boxes use lower quality <b>passive</b> <b>crossovers.</b> Expensive hi-fi speaker systems and receivers use higher quality <b>passive</b> <b>crossovers,</b> to obtain improved sound quality and lower distortion. The same price/quality approach is used with sound reinforcement system equipment and musical instrument amplifiers and speaker cabinets; a low-priced stage monitor, PA speaker or bass amplifier speaker cabinet will typically use lower quality, lower priced <b>passive</b> <b>crossovers,</b> whereas high-priced, high quality cabinets will use better quality <b>crossovers.</b> <b>Passive</b> <b>crossovers</b> may use capacitors made from polypropylene, metalized polyester foil, paper and electrolytic capacitors technology. Inductors may have air cores, powdered metal cores, ferrite cores, or laminated silicon steel cores, and most are wound with enamelled copper wire.|$|R
25|$|<b>Passive</b> <b>crossovers</b> are {{commonly}} installed inside speaker boxes and {{are by far}} the most usual type of crossover for home and low-power use. In car audio systems, <b>passive</b> <b>crossovers</b> may be in a separate box, necessary to accommodate the size of the components used. <b>Passive</b> <b>crossovers</b> may be simple for low-order filtering, or complex to allow steep slopes such as 18 or 24dB per octave. <b>Passive</b> <b>crossovers</b> can also be designed to compensate for undesired characteristics of driver, horn, or enclosure resonances, and can be tricky to implement, due to component interaction. <b>Passive</b> <b>crossovers,</b> like the driver units that they feed, have power handling limits, have insertion losses (10% is often claimed), and change the load seen by the amplifier. The changes are matters of concern for many in the hi-fi world. When high output levels are required, active crossovers may be preferable. Active crossovers may be simple circuits that emulate the response of a passive network, or may be more complex, allowing extensive audio adjustments. Some active crossovers, usually digital loudspeaker management systems, may include electronics and controls for precise alignment of phase and time between frequency bands, equalization, dynamic range compression and limiting) control.|$|R

2500|$|Crossovers can be passive or active. A <b>passive</b> <b>crossover</b> is an {{electronic}} circuit {{that uses a}} combination {{of one or more}} resistors, inductors, or non-polar capacitors. These components are combined to form a filter network and are most often placed between the full frequency-range power amplifier and the loudspeaker drivers to divide the amplifier's signal into the necessary frequency bands before being delivered to the individual drivers. <b>Passive</b> <b>crossover</b> circuits need no external power beyond the audio signal itself, but have some disadvantages: they may require larger inductors and capacitors due to power handling requirements (being driven by the amplifier), limited component availability to optimize the crossover's characteristics at such power levels, etc. Unlike active crossovers which include a built-in amplifier, passive crossovers have an inherent attenuation within the passband, typically leading to a reduction in damping factor before the voice coil [...] An active crossover is {{an electronic}} filter circuit that divides the signal into individual frequency bands before power amplification, thus requiring at least one power amplifier for each bandpass. Passive filtering may also be used in this way before power amplification, but it is an uncommon solution, being less flexible than active filtering. Any technique that uses crossover filtering followed by amplification is commonly known as bi-amping, tri-amping, quad-amping, and so on, depending on the minimum number of amplifier channels.|$|E

50|$|Bi-wiring {{should not}} be {{confused}} with the hi-fi practice of bi-amping: the use of a separate amplifier for each driver, which brings improved separation of signal frequencies and removes the need for <b>passive</b> <b>crossovers</b> and the degraded efficiency, linearity, and cost that comes with them.|$|R

5000|$|Second-order filters have a 40 dB/decade (or 12 dB/octave) slope. Second-order filters {{can have}} a Bessel, Linkwitz-Riley or Butterworth {{characteristic}} depending on design choices and the components used. This order is commonly used in <b>passive</b> <b>crossovers</b> as it offers a reasonable balance between complexity, response, and higher frequency driver protection. When designed with time aligned physical placement, these crossovers have a symmetrical polar response, as do all even order crossovers.|$|R
50|$|Some passive {{networks}} include {{devices such}} as fuses, PTC devices, bulbs or circuit breakers to protect the loudspeaker drivers from accidental overpowering (e.g., from sudden surges or spikes). Modern <b>passive</b> <b>crossovers</b> increasingly incorporate equalization networks (e.g., Zobel networks) that compensate for the changes in impedance with frequency inherent in virtually all loudspeakers. The issue is complex, {{as part of the}} change in impedance is due to acoustic loading changes across a driver's passband.|$|R

5000|$|On the {{negative}} side, passive networks may be bulky and cause power loss. They {{are not only}} frequency specific, but also impedance specific. This prevents interchangeability with speaker systems of different impedances. Ideal crossover filters, including impedance compensation and equalization networks, can {{be very difficult to}} design, as the components interact in complex ways. Crossover design expert Siegfried Linkwitz said of them that [...] "the only excuse for <b>passive</b> <b>crossovers</b> is their low cost. Their behavior changes with the signal level dependent dynamics of the drivers. They block the power amplifier from taking maximum control over the voice coil motion. They are a waste of time, if accuracy of reproduction is the goal." [...] Alternatively, passive components can be utilised to construct filter circuits before the amplifier. This is called <b>passive</b> line-level <b>crossover.</b>|$|R
50|$|An active {{crossover}} contains active components in its filters. In recent years, {{the most commonly}} used active device is an op-amp; {{active crossover}}s are operated at levels suited to power amplifier inputs in contrast to <b>passive</b> <b>crossovers</b> which operate after the power amplifier's output, at high current and in some cases high voltage. On the other hand, all circuits with gain introduce noise, and such noise has a deleterious effect when introduced prior to the signal being amplified by the power amplifiers.|$|R
500|$|... 'Passive {{subwoofer}}s' have a subwoofer {{driver and}} enclosure, {{but they do}} not include an amplifier. They sometimes incorporate internal <b>passive</b> <b>crossovers,</b> with the filter frequency determined at the factory. These are generally used with third-party power amplifiers, taking their inputs from active crossovers earlier in the signal chain. Inexpensive Home Theatre in a Box packages often come with a passive subwoofer cabinet that is amplified by the multi-channel amplifier. While few high-end home-theater systems use passive subwoofers, this format is still popular in the professional sound industry.|$|R
50|$|Most audible {{differences}} are subtle. If at all noticeable, benefits of bi-amping cannot be realized if <b>passive</b> <b>crossover</b> networks of a speaker system are not removed. Benefits include transients {{are less likely}} to cause amplifier overload (clipping) and/or speaker damage, and reduced intermodulation distortion, elimination of errors introduced by low frequency <b>passive</b> <b>crossover,</b> reduction of load to the load presented to the power amplifier, better matching of power amplifier and speaker driver and others.|$|E

50|$|A high {{damping factor}} {{indicates}} that an amplifier will have {{greater control over}} {{the movement of the}} speaker cone, particularly in the bass region near the resonant frequency of the driver's mechanical resonance. However, the damping factor at any particular frequency will vary, since driver voice coils are complex impedances whose values vary with frequency. In addition, the electrical characteristics of every voice coil will change with temperature; high power levels will increase coil temperature, and thus resistance. And finally, <b>passive</b> <b>crossovers</b> (made of relatively large inductors, capacitors, and resistors) are between the amplifier and speaker drivers and also affect the damping factor, again in a way that varies with frequency.|$|R
25|$|Capacitors and {{inductors}} {{are applied}} together in tuned circuits to select information in particular frequency bands. For example, radio receivers rely on variable capacitors to tune the station frequency. Speakers use <b>passive</b> analog <b>crossovers,</b> and analog equalizers use capacitors to select different audio bands.|$|R
50|$|Hybrid active designs exist such {{as having}} three drivers powered by two {{internal}} amplifiers. In this case, an active two-way crossover splits the audio signal, usually into low frequencies and mid-high frequencies. The low-frequency driver is driven by its own amplifier channel while the mid- and high-frequency drivers share an amplifier channel the output of which is split by a <b>passive</b> two-way <b>crossover.</b>|$|R

50|$|Monitor {{amplifiers}} are heavy-duty amplifiers, typically 200 watts per channel or more. If {{the monitor}} speakers are using <b>passive</b> <b>crossovers,</b> then each channel {{is connected to}} one or more monitor speakers. In simple monitor configurations, a single monitor mix might drive both channels of the amplifier so that the single mix can be heard by most of the band by using multiple speakers. In more complex monitor configurations where each performer has a separate mix, then each mix will drive a separate channel on the amplifier. If the monitors are bi-amped, then two or more amplifier channels are needed for each speaker. This may be a single channel of two different amplifiers, a high-power amp for the woofer and a medium-power amp for the high-frequency driver, or it may be two channels of a high-power amp. A key criteria of a monitor amp is reliability. They must be able to survive the abuse of their output being shorted or speakers being plugged and un-plugged while the amp is turned on. They must continue to function while being overloaded for extended periods of time.|$|R
50|$|Powered {{speakers}} {{are available}} with <b>passive</b> or active <b>crossovers</b> built into them. In the 2000s, active speakers with internal active crossovers are widely seen in sound reinforcement applications and in studio monitors. Home theater and add-on domestic/automotive subwoofers have used active powered speaker technology since the late 1980s.|$|R
50|$|Active {{speakers}} comprise two {{or three}} speakers per channel, each fitted with its own amplifier, and preceded by an electronic crossover filter to separate the low-level audio signal into the frequency bands to be handled by each speaker. This approach enables complex active filters to be used on the low level signal, without the need to use <b>passive</b> <b>crossovers</b> of high power handling capability but limited rolloff and with large and expensive inductors and capacitors. An additional advantage is that peak power handling is greater if the signal has simultaneous peaks in two different frequency bands. A single amplifier has to handle the peak power when both signal voltages are at their crest; as power {{is proportional to the}} square of voltage, the peak power when both signals are at the same peak voltage is proportional to the square of the sum of the voltages. If separate amplifiers are used, each must handle the square of the peak voltage in its own band. For example, if bass and midrange each has a signal corresponding to 10 W of output, a single amplifier capable of handling a 40 W peak would be needed, but a bass and a treble amplifier each capable of handling 10 W would be sufficient. This is relevant when peaks of comparable amplitude occur in different frequency bands, as with wideband percussion and high-amplitude bass notes.|$|R
