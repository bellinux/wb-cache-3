President Barack Obama announced his intention to nominate Berry {{as director of the}} Office of Personnel Management on March 3, 2009, and did so on March 4. The nomination hearing before the Senate Homeland Security Committee on March 26, 2009, led to expectation of easy confirmation for Berry, despite opposition from conservative activists based on Berry's homosexuality. In the hearing Berry stated he supported any effective employee compensation system, but that the federal government had the obligation to give employees with comparable job performances similar pay and treatment. He pledged to preserve veterans preference and supplement it with training programs to prepare veterans for federal jobs, and promised reviews of proposals to improve the security clearance and hiring processes. Berry emphasized the importance for agencies to use all recruitment tools, citing relocation benefits that could keep agencies competitive with the private sector, and stated he would create a strategic plan and set <b>performance</b> <b>goals</b> for the Office of Personnel Management. Berry had stated support for benefits for same-sex partners of federal employees and a repeal of the Defense of Marriage Act.|$|E

They were intended {{to be used in}} the parade, but bad weather forced the cancellation of their flypast. Two of them were assigned to participate in the state acceptance trials while others were used as testbeds for various programs. The trials were concluded in June and the MiG-9 generally met the <b>performance</b> <b>goals</b> set by the Council of People's Commissars. The test pilots found the fighter easy and simple to fly. Defects noted during testing were that the engines flamed out when firing the cannon at high altitudes due to gun gas ingestion, no ejection seat was fitted, nor were air brakes or a fire suppression system. The fuel tanks were not self-sealing and no armor was provided for the pilot. Despite these drawbacks, the MiG-9 was ordered into production at Factory No. 1 before the acceptance tests were completed as the Soviet leadership believed that its shortcomings could be rectified during production. A batch of 50 aircraft, 40 single-seat fighters and 10 two-seat trainers, were ordered in late 1946 to participate in the 1947 May Day parade. In recognition of their accomplishment Artem Mikoyan and Mikhail Gurevich were awarded the Stalin Prize in 1947.|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Hypervigilance {{and fear}} of pain can cause pain {{patients}} to avoid certain activities. Those activities include activities {{that might lead to}} recovery. The aim {{of this study was to}} find out whether implementation intentions that strengthen the mental connection between pain and a <b>performance</b> <b>goal</b> on a painful finger pressing task can reduce avoidance of a painful task in healthy participants. Method: 75 participants ranging from 17 - 27 years old were randomly assigned to 3 different groups. 1 group formed implementation intentions that strengthened the mental connection between pain and a <b>performance</b> <b>goal,</b> 1 group formed implementation intentions that created a mental connection between a neutral stimulus and a <b>performance</b> <b>goal</b> and 1 group formed goal intentions. The participants had to press a button 5 times per second, which resulted in a painful sensation in the arm of participants. To measure avoidance of the painful task, the time spended on the task and the number of presses were registered. The hypothesis was that implementation intentions that strengthened the mental connection between pain and a <b>performance</b> <b>goal</b> would lead to a greater reduction of avoidance compared implementation intentions that created a connection between a neutral stimulus and a <b>performance</b> <b>goal</b> and compared to goal intentions. Also it was expected that implementation intentions that created a mental connection between a neutral stimulus and a <b>performance</b> <b>goal</b> would lead to a greater reduction of avoidance than goal intentions. Results: Implementation intentions that strengthened the mental connection between pain and a <b>performance</b> <b>goal</b> led to a greater reduction of avoidance than goal intentions, but not than implementation intentions that created a connection between a neutral stimulus and a <b>performance</b> <b>goal.</b> Implementation intentions that created a mental connection between a neutral stimulus and a <b>performance</b> <b>goal</b> did not lead to a greater reduction of avoidance than goal intentions. Discussion: The findings of the current study suggest that implementation intentions that strengthen the mental connection between pain and a <b>performance</b> <b>goal</b> could be a useful instrument in reducing avoidance of painful activities in pain patients...|$|R

40|$|<b>Performance</b> <b>goal</b> {{practices}} {{have been linked}} to negative behavioral and emotional outcomes in students. Despite this, little research has been done to understand what leads teachers to use these practices. Additionally, while there is significant research on individual characteristics of students based on their placement in classrooms with high or low <b>performance</b> <b>goal</b> practices, {{there is a lack of}} research on how these practices affect their social relationships. These questions were examined in this two journal article dissertation. In the first study, 461 elementary teachers were surveyed on their use of <b>performance</b> <b>goal</b> practices, as well as their years of teaching experience. They were also asked to determine the number of students who drained their energy, a measure of teacher perceived stress. Finally, students from these classrooms were surveyed using peer nominations to determine the number of aggressive students in each classroom, a measure of stress exposure. Multiple regression analyses were used to evaluate what elements of teacher stress might predict the use of <b>performance</b> <b>goal</b> practices in elementary classrooms. In the second study, 576 elementary teachers were surveyed on use their <b>performance</b> <b>goal</b> practices. Students were assessed on their ability in reading and math, and peer nominations were used to determine to what degree each student was accepted by their peers. Hierarchical linear modeling was used to determine whether the use of <b>performance</b> <b>goal</b> practices moderated the relationship between academic achievement and peer acceptance. Results from the first study indicate that teacher perceived stress and years of experience are predictors of the use of <b>performance</b> <b>goal</b> practices. Results from the second study indicate that in lower elementary classrooms only, the relationship between math achievement and peer acceptance was stronger in classrooms where the teachers reported a higher use of <b>performance</b> <b>goal</b> practices. Overall, these studies suggest that teachers who perceive more stress are more likely to use classroom practices that do not lead to optimal outcomes for their students. Results also demonstrate that for younger elementary students, these practices inform their decisions about classmates' likeability, which could be harmful to the social status of lower achieving students...|$|R

A learning goal orientation {{is associated with the}} belief that ability can be developed.
