50|$|The {{presentation}} of the logo has evolved over time. Before the war, it was rendered in yellow on a blue background. After the war, the chevrons became more subtle herringbones, usually on a white background. With the company searching for a new image during the 1980s, the logo became white on red to give an impression of dynamism, emphasized by <b>publicity</b> <b>slogan.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Under the {{promotion}} of Bonython and his company Speedway Pty Ltd, Rowley Park Speedway began attracting crowds every Friday night upwards of 15,000. This era was aptly named [...] "The golden era of speedway" [...] in Australia with large crowds attending meetings in other cities around Australia such as Sydney (Sydney Showground), Brisbane (Ekka) and Perth (Claremont Speedway). [...] "Friday night is Speedway night" [...] was the <b>publicity</b> <b>slogan</b> Bonython used for Rowley Park, as was a cartoon, with the words [...] "Almost everybody goes to Rowley Park on Friday nights", which showed everyone from a grandmother to ambulance drivers (complete with a bandaged patient on a stretcher), and a jockey all making {{their way into the}} speedway. In January 1963 a reported crowd of 20,000 [...] "Pie Eaters" [...] (Bonython's nickname for the regular speedway crowd) packed into the speedway to see Australia's first Demolition Derby. The Police were called in to handle traffic and hundreds of fans were turned away as the 'House Full' signs went up. The derby itself had 100 entrants and lasted for over 75 minutes.|$|E

Spectators are expected to bring money, which the streakers grab from their hands as they run by. The activity {{has been known to}} catch bystanders unawares, despite heavy <b>publicity</b> featuring the <b>slogan,</b> [...] "Bring money, or you're a pervert." ...|$|R
5000|$|During {{the early}} years of her career Schmidt joined the Society of Independent Artists and the Salons of America as well as the Whitney Studio Club and these {{connections}} suggest a liberal, or as it was then termed, radical attitude toward art and artists. Wishing to further the careers of young American artists, these organizations aimed to counter the conservative practices of the National Academy of Arts and Sciences by holding exhibitions free of juries and prizes and offering works for sale without commission. They engaged the New York public with advertising and with <b>publicity</b> campaigns having <b>slogans</b> such as [...] "what is home without a modern picture?" [...] In joining them Schmidt placed herself among the progressive and independent artists of the time.|$|R
40|$|The {{contemporary}} {{crisis in}} city life {{is seen in}} the incapacity of urban planning and city design with regard to the landscape, which is basically overwhelmed by the scarcity of ideas in the “architecture as a show business” which now reigns. An empty formalism, as scarce consideration of social relationships and an ignorance of the syntactic rules of urbanistics are transforming architecture into a <b>publicity</b> <b>slogan</b> and urban spaces into a place of changeability and the ephemeral. The lesson which comes from the semiotics of the arts in relation to architecture has been completely forgotten if not altered into a production of “architectonic sculptures” monologuing with themselves, incapable of building continuity in the urban space/time contex...|$|E
