Advance Water Treatment plants can also {{be referred to as}} Advanced Wastewater Purification (AWP) systems. They are most commonly found on ships that sail in Alaskan waters and sometimes work in parallel with an onboard Marine Sanitation Device. Royal Caribbean International, for example, have installed AWP systems on their ships which treat wastewater using advanced technology. Royal Caribbean AWP systems include three types of water purification systems, Scanship, Hydroxyl/Headworks and Navalis. Scanship and Hydroxyl use biological treatment while the Navalis system primarily uses advanced oxidation and filtration methods. Scanship and Hydroxyl systems use bacterial to consume the waste while also utilizing a chemical in order to break down and remove solids. Scanship and Hydroxyl systems are very similar to water treatment plants based on shore. This involves a simple five stage process. The first stage involves a <b>prefilter</b> where screens removes heavy and noticeable solids from the waste influent. Then the wastewater is passed through a biological reactor which uses beneficial bacteria to further break down any solids. Next the influent is pumped through a flotation unit which removes floatable waste. Afterwards, the clean water is passed through polishing filters which make the water even cleaner. The last and final stage involves an ultraviolet light reactor which disinfects the water.
