This Article is a critical account of how, {{in search of a}} remedy, the Court rediscovered state copyright and rode roughshod over the concept of publication in copyright law. The 2 ̆ 2 tape pirate 2 ̆ 2 takes and sells two separable sets of interests. One is the rights in the musical composition. These are usually embraced by the compulsory licensing scheme that {{has been part of the}} federal statute since 1909. The composer and publisher may have enforcement problems, but they have clear enough rights against the pirate. The second set of interests is the rights in the performance or rendition. The sharing of these interests between the actual artists and the <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> is in dispute; however our present concern is with the existence and extent of such interests...|$|R

50|$|The Act recognizes {{two main}} types of rights of authors in Sections 5 and 6 as Economic {{rights and the}} Moral rights of the authors respectively. The Economic rights {{can be broken down}} into {{reproduction}} rights, transformation rights., public performance, broadcasting and communication of the work to the public rights, distribution rights, and commercial rental rights while the moral rights of the author are basically the right to be named as the author of the work and the right to seek relief where the author's work has been used without his permission. In some instances the economic rights may be vested in an employer or a person who commissions the work done {{in the course of the}} author's employment or commission per Section 7 of the Act. Section 8 of the Act recognizes certain works that moral rights and economics rights would not vest in any person and that those works are held in trust for the public except those authored by private media. Copyright can also be transferred either in whole or part by assignment, testamentary disposition or operation of law as identified in Section 9 of the Act. The moral rights of the author cannot be transferred.Section 10 and 11 of the Act also provides for the obligations that <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> <b>recordings</b> or audio visuals have which copyright protection do not depend on and notice of the protection of the rights <b>of</b> <b>producers</b> respectively.|$|R
40|$|Since the 1970 s, the {{practice}} of deejaying has been integrated into music-making and musical performance in hip hop, dance music, and other cultures. Disc jockeys have also become recognized as <b>producers</b> and authors <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> <b>recordings.</b> I examine how changes in the technological, legal and commercial environment of disc jockeys in the 1990 s are articulated in the styles and methods of deejaying. I argue that the conspicuous and covert styles of sampling articulate different forms of authorship, economic interests, and notions of originality. While the covert style has been crucial {{to the emergence of}} the DJ-as-author and deejaying as a legitimate art, the conspicuous style of copying on the edges of DJ culture troubles the tenuous links between the new DJ-stars and their works...|$|R

A private copying levy was introduced on blank audio tapes used for private copying and exclusive book distributors were granted protection in Canada.

40|$|The {{subject of}} my thesis is The Rights <b>of</b> <b>Producers</b> <b>of</b> Phonograms (<b>Sound</b> <b>Recordings)</b> and Films. I have chosen this topic {{because of my}} fondness for music and for media that carry such recordings. The Rights <b>of</b> <b>Producers</b> are {{denominated}} as rights related (to Copyright) because {{of the absence of}} creativity and individuality. The term neighbouring rights is exactly equivalent. In the first chapter I provide reader with basic terms and a concept of continental copyright law as well as a comparison with common law copyright system. These two law systems are essentially important to comprehend the rights <b>of</b> <b>producers</b> in general and to have basic overview on their role in global society and economy. Both authors' rights and related rights are copyrights in the sense of common law. The second chapter analyses international law on this subject. I describe the relationship between czech national law and international law. Although the majority of international agreements is phrased generally, mentioned agreements have impact on legislations of contracting parties. They form a part of czech law since their ratification and publication in Collection of Laws. The important agreements on the subject are Rome Convention, Geneva Convention, TRIPS Agreement and WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty. In addition, I [...] ...|$|R

40|$|Presented at the First International Forum on the Content Industry: Legal and Policy Framework for the Digital Content Industry collaboratively {{held by the}} East China University of Political Science and Law ([URL] and the Queensland University of Technology ([URL] in Shanghai, People’s Republic of China, May 2007. This {{publication}} is an {{output of}} the ARC Centre of Excellence for Creative Industries and Innovation ([URL] Queensland University of Technology. While China has not joined the World Intellectual Property Organisation (WIPO) Copyright Treaty (WCT) or the WIPO Performances and Phonograms Treaty (WPPT), China amended its Copyright Law in 2001 in accordance with Article 8 of the WCT and Articles 10 and 14 of the WPPT. As a result, a new exclusive right of communication through the information network (hereafter {{referred to as the}} ‘right of network communication’) was introduced into the Copyright Law 1990 (amended 2001) for the benefit of copyright owners and performers and <b>producers</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> and video <b>recordings.</b> The adoption of the right of network communication has raised the level of copyright protection as required by Article 8 of the WCT and Articles 10 and 14 of the WPPT. Consequently, uploading a work or recording onto a website for unauthorised distribution through the Internet will infringe the copyright owner, producer and performer’s (if the recording embodies the performance) right of network communication, unless the distribution constitutes fair use. However, since the provision on the right of network communication in the Copyright Law has a liberal application, {{more needs to be done}} to properly apply this right in complicated cases. In addition, the new technologies and business models appearing in China bring new challenges which call for clarification on the meaning of the network communication right, and either creating or improving provisions in the Copyright Law. For example, when a website provides hyperlinks to infringing MP 3 files, or ‘pirated’ sites containing a number of infringing files, will the website operator be directly responsible for infringing the right of network communication, or for indirectly contributing to the infringing act done by the linked sites? Moreover, if the copyright owner sues the website providing the hyperlinks, but does not give a written notice warning it of the infringing nature of the linked files or sites in advance, can the court determine that the website has actual knowledge of the infringing act occurring on the linked site? There are no clear answers to these questions in the Copyright Law. To deal with these new challenges the State Council drated the Regulation on the Protection of the Right of Communication through the Information Network (‘Communication Right Regulation’), 1 and the Supreme Court is trying to give interpretations on the right of network communication in specific cases. Nevertheless there are still disputes over the application of this new right. The competing interest groups, which include major record labels and the Internet industry, have opposing views, which makes it difficult for new legislation and judicial interpretation. This paper explores the nature of the new right of network communication in China and discusses its relationship with other exclusive rights, in particular the right of reproduction and the right of distribution. This paper also identifies the hotly debated questions in relation to applying the right of network communication and attempts to provide answers. In addition, the paper provides a proposal to introduce specific provisions of indirect copyright infringement and insights on the judicial test that should be applied by the courts in determining an act of indirect infringement...|$|R
