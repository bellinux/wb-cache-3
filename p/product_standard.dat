50|$|The main {{objective}} of the CPR is the removal of technical barriers to trade in order to guarantee the free movement of construction products within the common internal market due to differing product and test standards, approval processes and conformity documents in the various member states. Key element to this, are the Harmonized <b>Product</b> <b>Standard</b> and the European Technical Approval. Harmonized standards are established by the European standardizations bodies CEN (European Committee for Standardization) and Cenelec (European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization) with the involvement of stakeholders. Where a manufacturer would like to declare the characteristics for a construction product not yet covered by a harmonized <b>product</b> <b>standard,</b> he may use the procedure to establish a European technical assessment.|$|E

This trade reducing effect is driven by developing countries and by refusals without any product sample analysis, in particular during the Subprime Crisis and its aftermath. We also provide evidence that given <b>product</b> <b>standards</b> have been enforced more strictly during the crisis.

In this setting, changes in one country's demand for dirty inputs can feed back to affect the quality of intermediate goods offered for sale in international markets. We provide conditions under which tightening <b>product</b> <b>standards</b> in one country can raise both the profits of and exports from that country's final good producers. Greening <b>product</b> <b>standards</b> can have perverse environmental impacts: tightening rules governing emissions arising from the use of dirty inputs may raise rather than reduce local pollution. ...|$|R

Certified products may not contain listed chemicals as intentionally added ingredients above 1000 ppm.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} involves two set of papers. The {{first chapter}} contains a brief {{introduction of the}} issues covered in this thesis. In {{the first set of}} papers (chapters 2 and 3) I investigate the use of <b>product</b> <b>standards</b> in international trade. <b>Product</b> <b>standards</b> relate to restrictions on the attributes of a product that must be satisfied before the product becomes eligible to be sold in a particular market. The World Trade Organization ruling on <b>product</b> <b>standards</b> requires member countries to apply equal standards on the home produced good and the imported good. This is called the national treatment rule. In {{the first part of the}} dissertation (Chapters 2 and 3) I analyze the role of national treatment rule in the case of <b>product</b> <b>standards.</b> Chapter 4 evaluates the growth experience of Mauritius in the light of the explanations put forward in the empirical growth literature. As an African country Mauritius stands out as an exception, not only having a much higher growth rate than an average African country but also maintaining growth as a sustained phenomenon. I demonstrate that this exceptional growth performance of Mauritius has occurred because of some unique institutional features of Mauritius, making it different from the rest of Africa...|$|R

To focus on restrictive <b>product</b> <b>standards</b> only, we use a new database compiling the list of measures that have been raised as concerns in dedicated committees of the WTO. We restrict our analysis to the subset of Sanitary and Phyto-Sanitary (SPS) regulatory measures and analyse the effects of <b>product</b> <b>standards</b> on three variables: (i) probability to export and to exit the export market (firm-product extensive margins), (ii) value exported (firm-product intensive margin) and (iii) export prices. In particular we study whether firms size, market shares and export orientation modify the effect of SPS measures. We find that SPS measures discourage exports. We also find a negative effect of SPS imposition on the intensive margins of trade. Finally, the negative effects of SPS measures on the extensive and intensive margins of trade are attenuated for big firms...|$|R
