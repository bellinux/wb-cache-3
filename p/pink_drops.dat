50|$|A pear drop is a British boiled sweet {{made from}} sugar and flavourings. The classic pear drop is a {{combination}} of half pink and half yellow in a pear-shaped drop {{about the size of a}} thumbnail, although they are more commonly found in packets containing separate yellow drops and <b>pink</b> <b>drops</b> in roughly equal proportions. The artificial flavours isoamyl acetate and ethyl acetate are responsible for the characteristic flavour of pear drops: the former confers a banana flavour, the latter a pear flavour. Both esters are used in many pear and banana flavoured sweets. However, a natural pear-derived product from pear juice concentrate is sometimes used.|$|E

50|$|The Finale {{began by}} announcing that Roger won over Mark in the fans voting by around 100,000 votes from the {{millions}} of votes cast, granting him a slot in the final three, joining Kelly and Ali, and eliminating Mark. This makes Mark the first ever contestant to have been eliminated twice before the Finale. Next they showed {{each of the three}} finalists (as well as Mark) as they reunited with their families. Afterwards, they introduced the 16 eliminated players (Paul did not attend) and their newly transformed bodies. After that, they changed into their Biggest Loser uniforms, and {{it was time for the}} weigh in for the $100,000 consolation prize. Jenni (Green) lost 54 lbs and Lynn shed 80 lbs. Mallory (Brown) shed 65 lbs and Curtis dropped 150 lbs, meaning he could qualify for health insurance. Amanda (White) shed 64 lbs and Neill lost 88 lbs. Bette-Sue (<b>Pink)</b> <b>dropped</b> 75 lbs. Jenn (Purple) lost 64 lbs and Maggie dropped 70 lbs. Jackie (Orange) lost 89 lbs and Dan shed 136 lbs, taking the lead from Curtis. Trent (Gray) went next and dropped 135 lbs. Bernie (Blue) lost 130 lbs and took the lead from Dan. Jay (Black) dropped 103 lbs and Mark, the last eliminated contestant at the season, dropped 129 lbs, one pound short of beating out Bernie. Bernie was declared the winner in the end and took home the $100,000 consolation cash prize.|$|R
50|$|Baron Grod was a four-piece post-metal/experimental {{rock band}} from Austin, Texas. The band {{was made up}} of Lance Schibi, Ryoko Minowa, David Finner and Cody Schibi.

60|$|When {{he went to}} {{his room}} to change for dinner he saw in a glass of water a large clove carnation. Who had put it there? Who could have put it there--but she? It had the same scent as the {{mountain}} <b>pinks</b> she had <b>dropped</b> over him, but deeper, richer--a scent moving, dark, and sweet. He put his lips to it before he pinned it into his coat.|$|R
5000|$|The video {{begins with}} a {{close-up}} shot of a worm inching through grass. A <b>pink</b> ball is <b>dropped</b> next to the worm and a young girl picks it up, throwing it to her identical sister nearby. The scene cuts inside the dining room/kitchen of a suburban house, with Albarn {{and the rest of}} the band sitting down at a table. A woman, assumed to be the mother, sets out dishes on the table with the help of the girls, including a quiche, carrots, broccoli, soup, rolls, and meatballs.|$|R
50|$|This {{record was}} not {{noted by the}} indie rock scene until 2005, when Stephen McBean's other band, Black Mountain, {{released}} their debut record (also on Jagjaguwar). Stephen McBean supposedly wrote the material when Jerk With a Bomb (who turned into the previously mentioned band) were on tour, and hastily recorded it in three weeks once back in Vancouver. The tracks have a strong sexual imagery, bearing names like Sweet '69 and I (Fuck) Mountains. McBean claimed the <b>Pink</b> Mountaintops would <b>drop</b> the sexual sound for their next LP. The track 'Can You Do That Dance' {{was used in the}} UK TV advertisement for Beck's Vier lager (May 2007).|$|R
500|$|Hydnellum ferrugineum, {{commonly}} known as the mealy tooth or the reddish-brown corky spine fungus, is a species of tooth fungus in the family Bankeraceae. A widely distributed species, it is found in north Africa, Asia, Europe, and North America. The fungus fruits on the ground singly or in clusters in conifer forest, usually in poor (low nutrient) or sandy soil. Fruit bodies are somewhat top-shaped, measuring [...] in diameter. Their velvety surfaces, initially white to <b>pink,</b> sometimes exude <b>drops</b> of red liquid. The lower surface of the fruit body features white to reddish-brown spines up to 6mm long. Mature fruit bodies become dark reddish brown in color, and are then difficult to distinguish from other similar Hydnellum species. H.ferrugineum forms a mat of mycelia in the humus and upper soil where it grows. The presence of the fungus changes the characteristics of the soil, making it more podzolized.|$|R
5000|$|According to Stevers, the Frijid Pink {{recording}} of [...] "House of the Rising Sun" [...] was done impromptu {{when there was}} time left over at a recording session booked for the group at the Tera Shirma Recording Studios. Stevers later played snippets from that session's tracks for Paul Cannon, the music director of Detroit's premier rock radio station, WKNR; the two knew each other, as Cannon {{was the father of}} Stevers's girlfriend. Stevers recalled, [...] "we went through the whole thing and Cannon didn't say much. Then 'House the Rising Sun' started up and I immediately turned it off because it wasn't anything I really wanted him to hear." [...] However, Cannon was intrigued and had Stevers play the complete track for him, then advising Stevers, [...] "Tell Parrot <b>Pink's</b> label to <b>drop</b> God Gave Me You group's current single and go with this one." ...|$|R

25|$|When {{ownership}} of VCRs first became {{widespread in the}} early 1980s, adult videos made their appearance, and quickly became highly popular. As early as 1982 the AVs had already attained an approximately equal share of the adult entertainment market with theatrical erotic films. In 1984, new government censorship policies and an agreement between Eirin (the Japanese film-rating board) and the pink-film companies added to Nikkatsu's difficulties by putting drastic new restrictions on theatrical films. Theatrical <b>pink</b> movie profits <b>dropped</b> 36% within a month of the new ruling. Eirin dealt a serious blow to the pink film industry in 1988 by introducing stricter requirements for sex-related theatrical films. Nikkatsu responded by discontinuing their Roman Porno line. Bed Partner (1988) was the final film of the venerable 17-year-old Roman Porno series. Nikkatsu continued to distribute films under the name Ropponica, and pink films through Excess Films, however these were not nearly as popular or critically respected as the Roman Porno series had been in its heyday. By {{the end of the}} 1980s, adult videos had become the main form of adult cinematic entertainment in Japan.|$|R
500|$|The video {{opens with}} Stan {{and some of}} her male back-up dancers being {{presented}} in a dark white room. Subsequently, the room becomes enlightened and Stan is seen wearing transparent sunglasses, a white sweatband and a silver jacket. Following this, she retrieves a tennis racket from one of her background dancers and holds it {{in front of her face}} before returning the racket to a nearby dancer. Next, Stan performs the pre-refrain of the song, while two female performers clutch a hair dryer in their hands. For the refrain, she and ten other female background dancers are performing synchronized dances, with them having wigs on, and dressing white clothing and red accessories. Following this, Stan is presented standing on a yellow plate which is kept in the air by two threads. She wears a silver leotard and a multicolored wig. Next, Stan is shown walking into a tennis field, whereon she plays a tennis match against herself. For the breakdown of [...] "Cherry Pop", the video gets introduced into a dark-lighted room. There, [...] her previously shown male background dancers are presented; the video continues with Stan dancing accompanied by her dancers.

40|$|Satellite {{networking}} {{is known}} to suffer from specific network performance issues, such as high latency and low throughput stability; this derives mainly from the high propagation delay, in particular with GEO satellites. This characteristic poses limitations on the benefits that general AQM solutions could introduce; in fact, reducing congestion and mitigating queueing delay is a vital feature that could boost the performance of satellite networks. This paper investigates PINK (Passive INverse feedbacK), a queue management algorithm designed to indirectly impose an individual resource allocation policy in order to mitigate the bufferbloat effect and the network congestion while exploiting the channel throughput and guaranteeing optimal flow fairness without forcing any packet <b>drop.</b> <b>PINK</b> modifies the TCP Acknowledgements (ACKs) segments passing through the Satellite access gateway. The modification consists in replacing the advertised Receive Windows field (RCV. WNDs) with custom values, in order to enforce a particular bandwidth utilization upper bound. To compute new RCV. WND values, PINK needs only the number of active connections, the flows RTT and the transmission channel bandwidth. The design characteristics of this new AQM let it works efficiently in satellite networks, and we validate this statement through several simulations performed with the ns- 3 network simulator...|$|R

500|$|Summed up by James Dinh of MTV News, [...] " [...] 'Party' takes viewers {{back to an}} old-school {{backyard}} celebration full {{of colorful}} bikinis, freestyle dancing and a few familiar faces. Throughout the video, [...] lets loose, playing a sort of party host. If she is not lounging in beach chairs, she is dancing among her friends or mowing the lawn." [...] The clip is centered around a trailer park hood and a subsequent soiree. It starts with a dog barking behind a fencing, followed by multiple intercut scenery, which includes two men engaged in a conversation, a woman leaning against a car, a little girl riding a bicycle and a saucepan caught in fire. Then, Beyoncé appears, dressed in bright colored as well as flashy garments, sporting neon-colored oval shaped nails, and bright-colored lipstick. She is cooking in a skillet while one of her neighbors drinks from a hose. As she sings, looking into the camera, she highlights and plays with her hair. The action shifts from the double wide to a sunny summer backyard barbecue, where Beyoncé and her friends dance as Solange is deejaying. This is followed by scenes of Beyoncé, floating in an above ground pool while singing and entertaining her guests. She is wearing a <b>pink</b> one-piece swimsuit, <b>dropping</b> earrings and her hair looks crimped. Other girls bask {{in the sun and}} splash in the pool as Solange works the turntables.|$|R
