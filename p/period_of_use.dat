5|$|There is a {{small stone}} chapel in the grounds, {{believed}} to date to about 1450 and built by the Hungerford family for use by themselves and their servants. It has an east window with Perpendicular tracery. After a long <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> as stables, it was restored in the twentieth century. There is also a brick-built storehouse mounted on staddle stones to prevent incursion by rats.|$|E
5|$|The castle was {{expanded}} in the 1680s by Sir Bernard de Gomme and, {{after a period}} of neglect in the 18th century, was redesigned again in 1814 during the Napoleonic Wars. After a brief <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> as a military prison in the 1840s, the fortification {{was expanded}} in the 1850s and 1860s with additional gun batteries on the east and west sides. The defences were upgraded throughout the century due to the fears of a French invasion and formed part of the plan for defending Portsmouth during the First World War. In the interwar years some of the fortifications were stood down, but the castle saw service again in the Second World War, when it was involved in Operation Grasp, the seizure of French naval vessels in Portsmouth harbour. In 1960, Southsea Castle, by now obsolete, was sold to Portsmouth City Council. It was restored to its pre-1850 appearance and opened as a tourist attraction, receiving over 90,000 visitors from 2011–12.|$|E

25|$|This {{number is}} {{confirmed}} by the archaeological evidence.

25|$|The Roundhouse {{was built}} in 1846 as a {{turntable}} engine shed (or roundhouse) for the London and Birmingham Railway, and {{was known as the}} Great Circular Engine House, or the Luggage Engine House. The original building was built by Branson & Gwyther, using designs by architects Robert B. Dockray and Robert Stephenson. Within ten years locomotives became too long for the building to accommodate, and the Roundhouse was used for various other purposes. The longest <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> (50 years, beginning in 1871) was as a bonded warehouse for Gin distillers W & A Gilbey Ltd.|$|E

Under the rule of King Barom Reachea I (reigned 1566–1576), who temporarily succeeded in driving back the Thai, the royal court was briefly returned to Angkor. Inscriptions from the 17th century testify to Japanese settlements alongside those of the remaining Khmer. The best-known inscription tells of Ukondayu Kazufusa, who celebrated the Khmer New Year there in 1632. However, in following decades the Japanese community was absorbed into the local Khmer community, owing {{to the lack of}} new Japanese arrivals and very little possibility of renewing their community.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to analyze and compare {{scanning}} electron microscopy (SEM) observations of ball attachments that had been worn by patients during three <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> clinical <b>use.</b> One hundred forty-four specimens of ball anchor attachments (gold alloy matrix and titanium patrix) were studied by SEM after <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> approximately 1, 3. 5, and 8 years <b>of</b> clinical <b>use.</b> Twenty new attachment components were examined as controls. SEM images revealed signs of mechanical wear for the ball attachments studied. The surfaces of the titanium patrix were associated primarily with roughening after short-term <b>use,</b> whereas surfaces <b>of</b> the gold alloy matrix showed wear, roughening, and loss of microscopic material in the form of flakes. Severe mechanical wear on both surfaces was noted after longer <b>periods</b> <b>of</b> <b>use.</b> The mechanical changes were not correlated with patient-mediated observations regarding the time-dependent retentive efficacy of the attachments. One year of clinical wear appeared to have limited effect on the ball attachment tested.

25|$|After 1542 the barony was {{returned}} to the Earls of Angus, the keepership of the Carmichaels of Meadowflat {{coming to an end}} in 1595. In 1633 the 11th earl was created Marquess of Douglas, and the castle was probably rebuilt after this date. The castle then passed to the Duke of Hamilton, before being sold to Sir George Colebrooke in the 18th century. After a <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> as a farmhouse, the building was abandoned {{at the end of the}} 18th century, and much of the stone reused to build the present Crawford Castle Farm. Four stone tablets bearing coats of arms, one with the date 1648, are built into the west and south walls of the Castle Crawford House.|$|E
25|$|Estimates of Gabilondo Ruby {{production}} {{are between}} 250,000 and 300,000 pistols in total. While most Gabilondo produced pistols were of good quality, others were less well made. French officials quickly {{became aware that}} few of the Spanish Ruby-types had interchangeable magazines, and insisted the manufacturers mark the base of all magazines. This was to prevent the possibly fatal consequence at {{the front line of}} either not being able to insert a new magazine, or having a loaded magazine detach from the gun in action. Many Ruby-types were plagued by poor finish and incorrectly hardened steel parts which after a short <b>period</b> <b>of</b> <b>use</b> wore so badly that pistols fired on full-auto. On other pistols, the safety mechanism wore out. The good quality Rubies were reliable and accurate, although some users were disconcerted by the lack of a visible hammer. About 710,000 Ruby types were accepted by the French from all sources and by 1920, about 580,000 were still serviceable and in French army stores. Many other allied nations, and some of the new nations created after the War such as Finland and Yugoslavia also used Ruby-type pistols. Gabilondo ceased production in 1919 and switched to more advanced models, but other firms continued to produce the Ruby-type until the Great Depression wiped out many arms producers.|$|E

500|$|Arguably, the cadre most historically-associated {{with this}} method of {{execution}} were the foreign-occupiers and subordinate collaborators prosecuting the British-occupation of India.

500|$|During the First World War, Calshot Castle was {{primarily}} {{used as a}} base for seaplanes, deployed on anti-submarine patrols in the English Channel; its guns were removed {{before the end of the}} war, probably for use in France. The air base, by then called RAF Calshot, grew in size during the inter-war years, hosting the Schneider Trophy air races. With the outbreak of the Second World War, Calshot was re-armed in the face of a possible German invasion. The station continued in use after the war, but as military seaplanes became obsolete, it was finally closed in 1961.
