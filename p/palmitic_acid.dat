5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{undergo a}} range of posttranslational modifications, when additional chemical groups {{are attached to the}} amino acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic lipoproteins, or hydrophilic glycoproteins. These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid <b>palmitic</b> <b>acid</b> to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then detach from cell membranes.|$|E

40|$|A gas chromatography-mass {{spectrometry}} {{assay method}} {{for the analysis}} of lauric, myristic, and <b>palmitic</b> <b>acids</b> and their omega and omega- 1 hydroxylated metabolites from in vitro incubations of cytochrome P 450 CYP 4 A 1, involving solid-phase extraction and trimethysityl derivatization, was developed. The assay was linear, precise, and accurate over the range 0. 5 to 50 muM for all the analytes. It has the advantages of a more rapid analysis time, an improved sensitivity, and a wider range of analytes compared with other methods. An artificial membrane system was optimized for application to purified CYP 4 A 1 enzyme by investigating the molar ratios of cytochrome b(5) and cytochrome P 450 reductase present in the incubation mixture. Using this method, the kinetics of omega and omega(- 1) oxidation of lauric, myristic, and <b>palmitic</b> <b>acids</b> by CYP 4 A enzymes were measured and compared in rat liver microsomes and an artificial membrane system.

5000|$|Anaerobic {{bacteria}} dominate {{within a}} body following death, which promote the anaerobic degradation of fatty acids by hydrogenation. [...] The process of hydrogenation transforms unsaturated bonds (double and triple bonds) into single bonds. This essentially increases {{the amounts of}} saturated fatty acids, while decreasing the proportion of unsaturated fatty acids. Therefore, hydrogenation of oleic and palmitoleic acids, for example, will yield stearic, and <b>palmitic</b> <b>acids,</b> respectively.|$|R
40|$|Five major fatty <b>acids,</b> <b>palmitic</b> (16 : 0), stearic (18 : 0), oleic (18 : 1), {{linoleic}} (18 : 2), and linolenic (18 : 3), {{were identified}} in polar lipid extracts from pulvini of Samanea saman and Phaseolus coccineus. In P. coccineus their distribution varied quantitatively in the laminar pulvinus, petiolar pulvinus, petiole, stem, leaf and root. Short pulses of red light did not greatly affect the relative quantities of fatty acids in dark grown P. coccineus, but a 30 -minute exposure of red light generally increased the degree of unsaturation by increasing linolenic acid and decreasing linoleic and <b>palmitic</b> <b>acids...</b>|$|R

Diacylglycerols can also have many other combinations of fatty acids attached at either the C-1 and C-2 positions or the C-1 and C-3 positions of the glycerol molecule. 1,2 disubstituted glycerols are always chiral, 1,3 disubstituted glycerols are chiral if the substituents are different from each other.|$|E
25|$|The lipids {{found in}} green coffee include: {{linoleic}} acid, <b>palmitic</b> <b>acid,</b> oleic acid, stearic acid, arachidic acid, diterpenes, triglycerides, unsaturated long-chain fatty acids, esters, and amides. The total content of lipids in dried green coffee is between 11.7 and 14 g/100 g. Lipids are {{present on the}} surface and in the interior matrix of green coffee beans. On the surface, they include derivatives of carboxylic acid-5-hydroxytryptamides with an amide bond to fatty acids (unsaturated C6 to C24) making up to 3% of total lipid content or 1200 to 1400 microgram/g dried green coffee bean. Such compounds form a wax-like cover {{on the surface of the}} coffee bean (200 to 300mg lipids/100g dried green coffee bean) protecting the interior matrix against oxidation and insects. Further, such molecules have antioxidative activity due to their chemical structure. Lipids of the interior tissue are triglycerides, linoleic acid (46% of total free lipids), <b>palmitic</b> <b>acid</b> (30% to 35% of total free lipids), and esters. Arabica beans have a higher content of lipids (13.5 to 17.4g lipids/100g dried green coffee beans) than robustas (9.8 to 10.7g lipids/100g dried green coffee beans). The content of diterpenes is about 20% of the lipid fraction. The diterpenes found in green coffee include cafestol, kahweol and 16-O-methylcafestol. Some of these diterpenes have been shown in in vitro experiments to protect liver tissue against chemical oxidation. In coffee oil from green coffee beans the diterpenes are esterified with saturated long chain fatty acids.|$|E
25|$|Those {{plastids}} {{that contain}} chlorophyll can carry out photosynthesis. Plastids can also store products like starch and can synthesize fatty acids and terpenes, {{which can be}} used for producing energy and as raw material for the synthesis of other molecules. For example, the components of the plant cuticle and its epicuticular wax are synthesized by the epidermal cells from <b>palmitic</b> <b>acid,</b> which is synthesized in the chloroplasts of the mesophyll tissue. All plastids are derived from proplastids, which are present in the meristematic regions of the plant. Proplastids and young chloroplasts commonly divide by binary fission, but more mature chloroplasts also have this capacity.|$|E
