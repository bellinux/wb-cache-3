5|$|According to {{contemporary}} accounts in the Annales Piacentines the College of Cardinals {{was divided into}} adherents of Charles d'Anjou (pars Caroli) and the Imperial party (pars Imperii), but the exact reconstruction of these parties is very difficult. It is almost certain that this account is inaccurate when it claims that pars Caroli had six (or seven, in another <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> account) members, including Giovanni Gaetano Orsini and Ottobono Fieschi, while pars Imperii had eleven (or ten) members, Riccardo Annibaldi, Ottaviano Ubaldini and Uberto Coconati among them. Certainly five cardinals, namely Ottobono Fieschi, Guillame de Bray, Anchero Pantaleone, Simon Monpitie de Brie and Odo of Châteauroux belonged to the Angevin faction. But if Giovanni Gaetano Orsini was really one of their leaders, then his relatives Matteo Orsini Rosso and Giacomo Savelli should also be added here, and since Henry of Segusio {{is also likely to}} have belonged to this faction, its true size would have amounted to nine cardinals. Imperial party, on the contrary, could not have had more than ten members, including two who had died during sede vacante.|$|E
5|$|Djibouti had two athletes {{qualify for}} the 1500 m run with a {{qualification}} time better than 3:36.20. Ayanleh Souleiman {{finished third in the}} first heat with a time 3:39.25, which qualified him for the semifinals. He finished in 2nd <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> heat with a time of 3:39.46, which qualified him for the finals. In the finals, Souleiman finished in fourth place with a time of 3:50.29. He was 0.05 seconds away from the bronze medal, and 0.29 seconds away from the gold. The other Djiboutian that qualified for the 1500 m run, Abdi Waiss Mouhyadin, did not finish the race. On the final lap, he tripped and required help to leave the track. Waiss was also the flagbearer for Djibouti in the opening ceremony.|$|E
5|$|When {{the general}} {{elections}} {{were held in}} July 2008, FUNCINPEC won 2 seats in the National Assembly {{as most of the}} party's supporters voted for the CPP, which won the elections and secured 90 seats in the National Assembly. As a result of its losses incurred in the general election, the CPP took over ministerial positions which were formerly held by FUNCINPEC MPs since 2004, although it still allowed Nhek Bun Chhay to remain in his position as Deputy Prime Minister, while 32 senior party members were appointed as secretary-of-state and undersecretary-of-state positions. In the next few months after the elections, the Phnom Penh Post reported that at least 10 percent of its members defected to the CPP, including its former ministers Pou Sothirak and Sun Chhanthol. In February 2009, FUNCINPEC signed an agreement with the NRP to cooperate for the commune council elections that was slated to take place in May 2009. When the elections took <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> month, the FUNCINPEC-NRP alliance only secured less than 0.1% of all votes cast for the provincial, municipal and district-level seats.|$|E

5|$|The film's premiere {{happened}} at the Grand Rex in Paris, on April 14, 2013, with Robert Downey, Jr. and Gwyneth Paltrow in attendance. While the UK premiere of the film was originally set for April 17, the funeral of former British Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher taking <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> date made the event be pushed to the following day. Downey, Ben Kingsley and Rebecca Hall were present for the advance screening at London's Odeon Leicester Square. The El Capitan Theatre in Los Angeles hosted the United States premiere of Iron Man 3 on April 24. The film opened in 46 countries through April 22–24, with the United States release, in 4,253 screens, happening one week later. Regal Cinemas, AMC Theatres and Carmike Cinemas put presale tickets on hold, {{two weeks before the}} US premiere. The cinemas were in a contract dispute with Disney, who wished to receive more of the ticket sale profit than they currently did, largely based on the projected premiere-weekend intake Iron Man 3 was expected to have. Carmike was the first {{to come to terms with}} Disney. It was later reported that Cinemark Theatres had also stopped selling presale tickets, and Regal Cinemas had removed all marketing material for the film from its locations. On April 25, 2013, Regal, AMC and Disney ended their dispute, which allowed Regal and AMC to proceed with selling presale tickets again.|$|E

25|$|Most {{scholars}} {{take these}} observations {{as a strong}} clue to the literary relationship among the synoptics and Mark's special <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> relationship.

A leading alternative hypothesis is Marcan posteriority, that Mark was formed primarily by extracting what Matthew and Luke shared in common.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, {{recognition}} came slow {{after his}} death. It was not before 1866 {{that a real}} breakthrough in the reception of his role in Slovene culture took <b>place.</b> <b>In</b> <b>that</b> year, Josip Jurčič and Josip Stritar published a new edition of Prešeren's collection of poems. In the preface, Stritar published an essay which is still {{considered one of the}} most influential essays in Slovene history. In it, he showed the aesthetic value of Prešeren's work by placing him in the wider European context. From then on, his reputation as the greatest poet in Slovene language was never endangered.|$|E

The local YMCA was the first to introduce the sport to the country, while Iraklis BC won the first ever Greek championship. From 1982 to 1993 Aris BC dominated the league, regularly finishing in first <b>place.</b> <b>In</b> <b>that</b> period Aris won a total of 9 championships, 7 cups and one European Cup Winners' Cup. The city also hosted the 2003 FIBA Under-19 World Championship in which Greece came third. In volleyball, Iraklis has emerged since 2000 as one of the most successful teams in Greece and Europe – see 2005–06 CEV Champions League. In October 2007, Thessaloniki also played host to the first Southeastern European Games.|$|E

During the years in Turin, he was the mentor of the young writer and translator Fernanda Pivano, his former student at the Liceo D'Azeglio. Pavese gave her the American edition of Spoon River Anthology, which came out in Pivano's Italian translation in 1943.|$|E

25|$|Details of the {{proposed}} offering are disclosed to potential purchasers {{in the form of}} a lengthy document known as a prospectus. Most companies undertake an IPO with the assistance of an investment banking firm acting in the capacity of an underwriter. Underwriters provide several services, including help with correctly assessing the value of shares (share price) and establishing a public market for shares (initial sale). Alternative methods such as the dutch auction have also been explored. In terms of size and public participation, the two most notable examples of this method is the Google IPO and Snapchat's parent company Snap Inc. China has recently emerged as a major IPO market, with several of the largest IPOs taking <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> country.|$|E
25|$|After the {{interval}} act is over, {{when all the}} points have been calculated, the presenter(s) of the show call upon each voting country in turn to invite them to announce {{the results of their}} vote. Prior to 1994 the announcements were made over telephone lines; with the audio being piped into the auditorium for the audience to hear, and over the television transmission. However, since and including 1994 the announcements have been presented visually. Often the opportunity is taken by each country to show their spokesperson {{standing in front of a}} backdrop which includes a famous <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> country. For example, the French spokesperson might be seen standing in front of the Eiffel Tower or an Italian presenter might be seen with the Colosseum in the background.|$|E

25|$|The climbers' {{jersey is}} {{worn by the}} rider who, {{at the start of}} each stage, has the largest amount of {{climbing}} points. If a rider leads two or more of the categories, the climbers' jersey is worn by the rider in second, or third, <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> contest. At the end of the Giro, the rider holding the most climbing points wins the classification. In fact, some riders, particularly those who are neither sprinters nor particularly good at time-trialing, may attempt only to win this particular competition within the race. The Giro has four categories of mountains. They range from category 4, the easiest, to category 1, the hardest. There is also the Cima Coppi, the highest point reached in a particular Giro, which is worth more points than the race's other first-category climbs. Gino Bartali has won the mountains classification a record seven times.|$|E
25|$|The {{classification}} awarded no {{jersey to}} the leader until the 1975 Tour de France, when the organizers decided to award a distinctive white jersey with red dots {{to the leader}}. The climbers' jersey is worn by the rider who, {{at the start of}} each stage, has the largest number of climbing points. If a rider leads two or more of classifications, the climbers' jersey is worn by the rider in second, or third, <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> contest. At the end of the Tour, the rider holding the most climbing points wins the classification. Some riders may race with the aim of winning this particular competition, while others who gain points early on may shift their focus to the classification during the race. The Tour has five categories for ranking the mountains the race covers. The scale ranges from category 4, the easiest, to hors catégorie, the hardest. During his career Richard Virenque won the mountains classification a record seven times.|$|E
25|$|At B5, Taylor {{sang and}} played guitar and bass {{on his first}} solo album, Feelings Are Good (And Other Lies), working with {{collaborator}} Steve Jones of the Sex Pistols. The home-grown album was marketed by mail order, and sold its CDs directly via the website. The music and vocals were generally rough and raw, much more akin to grunge and punk music than to Duran Duran, while the lyrics reflected Taylor's chaotic personal life and his ongoing divorce from de Cadenet. He participated in writing an album for the reunited Power Station in late 1996, but his personal problems forced him {{to withdraw from the}} project, which went on to record with Bernard Edwards on bass and toured with a hired bass player. Increasing creative differences within Duran Duran, his move to Los Angeles and a desire to focus on his solo work also led Taylor to reconsider his <b>place</b> <b>in</b> <b>that</b> band. In January 1997 he announced at a Duran Duran fan convention that he was leaving the band.|$|E
