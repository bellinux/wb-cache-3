5|$|Euston was poorly {{served by}} the early London Underground network. The nearest station on the Metropolitan line was Gower Street, around five minutes' walk away. A <b>permanent</b> <b>connection</b> did not appear until 12 May 1907, when the City & South London Railway opened an {{extension}} north from Angel. The Charing Cross, Euston & Hampstead Railway opened an adjacent station on 22 June in the same year; these two stations {{are now part of}} the Northern line. Gower Street station was quickly renamed Euston Square in response. A connection to the Victoria line opened on 1 December 1968.|$|E
5|$|From April 1939 to October 1940, the Queens Boulevard Line {{served the}} 1939 New York World's Fair via the World's Fair Railroad. The World's Fair line ran via a {{connection}} through the Jamaica Yard and through Flushing Meadows–Corona Park along the current right-of-way of the Van Wyck Expressway. After calls from public officials such as Queens Borough President George Harvey {{to make the}} line a <b>permanent</b> <b>connection</b> to Flushing and northern Queens, the line was demolished in 1941.|$|E
5|$|Under an 1898 {{agreement}} between the Estates Company and the Ship Canal Company, the latter committed to carry freight on their dock railway between the docks and the park and {{to the construction of}} a <b>permanent</b> <b>connection</b> between the two railway networks. The West Manchester Light Railway Company was set up the following year to take over the operations of the tramway and to lay additional track. In 1904 responsibility for all of the parks roads and railways passed to the Trafford Park Company, {{as a result of the}} Trafford Park Act of that year. The railway network could subsequently be extended as required, without the need to seek additional permissions from Parliament. The network was also connected to the Manchester, South Junction and Altrincham Railway near Cornbrook. At its peak, the estate's railway network covered 26route miles (42km), handling about 2.5 million tons of cargo in 1940. Like the rest of the park, it fell into decline during the 1960s, exacerbated by the increasing use of road transport, and it was closed in 1998.|$|E

25|$|In its {{planning}} stages in 1937, it was discussed by the City Board of Estimate {{to make the}} line a <b>permanent</b> <b>connection</b> to Flushing Meadows Park {{following the end of}} the fair, with the possibility of intermediate stations along the line to serve the local area (today's Kew Gardens Hills and Flushing). The upgrades to make the line permanent would have cost around $6 million. However, it was determined to be impractical due to the absence of permanent attractions in the park (Citi Field, USTA) that are present today.|$|E
25|$|Bridgend {{developed}} at a ford on the River Ogmore, {{which was on}} the main route {{between east and west}} Wales. Just north of the town is the confluence of three rivers, the Ogmore, the Llynfi, and the Garw. South of Bridgend, the River Ewenny merges with the River Ogmore and flows into the Bristol Channel. In the 15th century, a stone bridge was built as a <b>permanent</b> <b>connection</b> between {{the two sides of the}} Ogmore (and was later rebuilt). Originally, this bridge had four arches, but in the 18th century, a massive flood washed two of them away. The rest of the bridge still stands and remains a focal point of the town: aesthetic restoration took place in 2006.|$|E

5000|$|Early {{automatic}} washing machines were usually {{connected to a}} water supply via temporary slip-on connectors to sink taps.

25|$|To {{achieve a}} loose patch clamp {{on a cell}} membrane, the pipette is moved slowly towards the cell, until the {{electrical}} resistance of the contact between the cell and the pipette increases to a few times greater resistance {{than that of the}} electrode alone. The closer the pipette gets to the membrane, the greater the resistance of the pipette tip becomes, but if too close a seal is formed, and it could become difficult to remove the pipette without damaging the cell. For the loose patch technique, the pipette does not get close enough to the membrane to form a gigaseal or a <b>permanent</b> <b>connection,</b> nor to pierce the cell membrane. The cell membrane stays intact, and the lack of a tight seal creates a small gap through which ions can pass outside the cell without entering the pipette.|$|E
25|$|Capacitors, {{including}} film types, {{designed for}} continuous operation at low-frequency (50 or 60nbsp&Hz) mains voltage, typically between line and neutral or line and ground for interference suppression, {{are required to}} meet standard safety ratings; e.g., X2 is designed to operate between line and neutral at 200-240nbsp&VAC, and Y2 between line and ground. These types are designed for reliability, and, in case of failure, to fail safely (open-, rather than short-circuit). A non-catastrophic failure mode in this application {{is due to the}} corona effect: the air enclosed in the winding element becomes ionized and consequently more conductive, allowing partial discharges on the metallized surface of the film, which causes local vaporization of the metallization. This occurs repeatedly, and can cause significant loss of capacitance (C-decay) over one or two years. International standard IEC60384-14 specifies a limit of 10% C-decay per 1,000 test hours (41 days of <b>permanent</b> <b>connection).</b> Some capacitors are designed to minimise this effect. One method, at the expense of increased size and cost, is for a capacitor operating at 200-240VAC to consist internally of two parts in series, each at a voltage of 100-120VAC, insufficient to cause ionisation. Manufacturers also adopt cheaper and smaller construction intended to avoid corona effect without series-connected sections, for example minimising enclosed air.|$|E
500|$|The {{second is}} the Mackinac Bridge that connects Michigan's two peninsulas at the Straits of Mackinac. A {{structure}} was first proposed in 1888 {{by one of the}} directors of the Grand Hotel on Mackinac Island. Car ferry service was started in 1923 to cross the straits, and a bridge authority was first created in 1934 to investigate the possibility of building a <b>permanent</b> <b>connection</b> across the straits. This early authority started with a 1921 proposal for a series of bridges that would have connected Cheboygan to St. Ignace by way of Bois Blanc, Round, and Mackinac islands. The federal Public Works Administration rejected loan and grant requests for that project. A second, direct crossing was then proposed based on designs used for the Tacoma Narrows Bridge. The collapse of that bridge and World War II delayed any further work on a structure beyond tests of the lake bottom and the construction of the [...] causeway on the St. Ignace side; the first bridge authority was abolished in 1947. The current agency was created on June 6, 1950.|$|E

2500|$|Being {{able to join}} {{optical fibers}} with low loss is {{important}} in fiber optic communication. This {{is more complex than}} joining electrical wire or cable and involves careful cleaving of the fibers, precise alignment of the fiber cores, and the coupling of these aligned cores. For applications that demand a <b>permanent</b> <b>connection</b> a fusion splice is common. In this technique, an electric arc is used to [...] melt the ends of the fibers together. Another common technique is a mechanical splice, where the ends of the fibers are held in contact by mechanical force. Temporary or semi-permanent connections are made by means of specialized optical fiber connectors.|$|E
2500|$|William Hepburn was in County Donegal, Ireland in 1753. He {{migrated}} to the Thirteen Colonies in 1773 or 1774. Hepburn lived in the Sunbury area {{for a short time}} before moving up the West Branch Susquehanna River to what is now Duboistown where he worked for Andrew Culbertson in digging the race for Culbertson's Mill. Hepburn also joined the local militia. During the American Revolution, the West Branch Valley came under attack from Loyalist and Indian forces. These attacks were known as the Big Runaway in 1778 and the later Little Runaway in 1779. Hepburn rose to the position of colonel and was the commanding officer at Fort Muncy, Samuel Wallis' fortified home in Muncy Township. Hepburn, reportedly, gave the orders to Robert Covenhoven and Rachel Silverthorn to spread the word of the impending attacks. Following the Big Runaway, Hepburn kept a <b>permanent</b> <b>connection</b> with the Covenhoven family by marrying, Crecy Covenhoven, the sister of Robert. Hepburn also bought [...] of land, to the west of Ross' holdings. His land, known as [...] "Deer Park", combined with Ross' [...] "Virginia" [...] would eventually become Williamsport.|$|E

2500|$|Robert Umfraville {{had a close}} {{relationship}} with his nephew Gilbert, the son of Robert's elder brother Thomas, who had died in 1391. Through Gilbert, Robert also had a <b>permanent</b> <b>connection</b> to Ralph, Earl of Westmorland, as Gilbert married Ralph's daughter Anne. Robert was probably responsible for Gilbert's martial training, as the two spent the years of the late 1400s on the border; in 1408 they jointly-led a raid into Teviotdale: Hardynge describes how, Robert was like an [...] "olde dogge [...] hath grete joy to bayte his whelpe." [...] The raids continued, with another soon after on Jedburgh. Robert's service for the king was not confined to the northern border, and neither was it confined to fighting on land. In 1410, he was appointed lieutenant to Sir Thomas Beaufort, the Admiral of the seas. In this capacity, following the burning of Roxburgh, Umfraville commanded a force of ten ships and 600 men and destroyed Scottish ships sheltered in the Firth of Forth, capturing thirteen or fourteen of them. This may well have been the documented occasion on which Umfraville utilised fire ships against them. As a result of his successes, he was appointed Captain of Roxburgh in place of John Neville, the Earl of Westmorland's son. Umfraville was owed £666 for his naval expedition, and two years later, Bishop Langley paid Umfraville 100 marks to repair the walls of Berwick Castle, by this time in some disrepair.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Distributed {{computing}} often {{needs to}} cope with information integration challenges. Up to now, several models have been proposed for information integration in heterogeneous, distributed and (loosely) dynamic environments. Nevertheless, in network environments where actors and their information sources are characterized by high dynamism and non <b>permanent</b> <b>connections,</b> traditional approaches are not adequate. In such a context, {{we believe that the}} recent Peer-to-Peer (P 2 P) distributed computing approach is an ideal solution. Despite several P 2 P applications/protocols have been realized, they are not able to exchange complex information and {{to cope with}} heterogeneity and information integration problems. In particular, for what concerns distributiveness this means to deal also with users that do not own sophisticated (hardware and software) platforms and <b>permanent</b> network <b>connections.</b> Namely, autonomous network users often use simple systems (i. e., personal computers, laptops, wireless devices, etc.) and their network accesses are characterized by variable connectivity.

60|$|July 30th.--We left Newby Bridge, all of us, on Saturday, {{at twelve}} o'clock, and steamed up {{the lake to}} Ambleside; a pretty good day as to weather, but with a little {{tendency}} to shower. There was nothing new on the lake, and no new impressions, as far as I can remember. At Ambleside, S----- and nurse went shopping, after which we took a carriage for Grasmere, and established ourselves at Brown's Hotel. I find that my impressions from our previous sight of all these scenes do not change on revision. They are very beautiful; but, if I must say it, I am a little weary of them. We soon tire of things which we visit merely by way of spectacle, and with which we have no real and <b>permanent</b> <b>connection.</b> In such cases we very quickly wish the spectacle to be taken away, and another substituted; at all events I do not care about seeing anything more of the English lakes {{for at least a}} year.|$|E

As he got {{near to the}} place, and passed along the dikes, and looked {{to the right and}} left down the droves, and trotted at last over the Folking bridge across the Middle Wash, the country did not seem to him to be so unattractive as of yore; and when he {{recognised}} the faces of the neighbours, when one of the tenants spoke to him kindly, and the girls dropped a curtsey as he passed, certain soft regrets began to crop up in his mind. After all, there is a comfort in the feeling of property--not simply its money comfort, but in the stability and reputation of a recognised home. Six months ago there had seemed to him to be something ridiculous in the idea of a <b>permanent</b> <b>connection</b> between the names of Caldigate and Folking. It was absurd that, with so wild and beautiful a world around him, he should be called upon to live in a washy fen because his father and grandfather had been unfortunate enough to do so. And then, at that time, all sympathy with bricks and mortar, any affection for special trees or well-known home-haunts, was absurd in his eyes. And as his father had been harsh to him, and did not like him, would it not be better that they should be far apart? It was thus that he had reasoned. But now all that was changed. An unwonted tenderness had come upon his spirit. The very sallows by the brook seemed to appeal to him. As he saw the house chimneys through the trees, he remembered that they had carried smoke from the hearths of many generations of Caldigates. He remembered, too, that his father would soon be old, and would be alone. It seemed to himself that his very mind and spirit were altered.|$|E
