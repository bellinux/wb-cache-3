40|$|Background: There is no {{information}} about cranio-facial asymmetry among school children {{and the influence of}} this pathology on the quality of life. Material and methods: The study presents a descriptive analysis of 3923 children ages 7 to 18 years. In this scientific work were involved three types ofschools: 421 children from schools with severe neurological disorders; 2157 children from auxiliary schools with special educational needs; and 1345 children from <b>pre-university</b> <b>schools.</b> Buccal examination included the dento-maxillary analysis in three planes (sagittal, vertical, and horizontal) andcranial anatomical shape was examined for all children. Results: In total 3923 children were examined, of which 632 (16 %) were determined with cranial asymmetry. Among 2157 children from auxiliaryschools for children with special educational needs 18 % were detected with cranial deformities. In schools for children with neurological disabilitiescranial asymmetries were detected in 44. 18 %, and in pre-unuversity schools 4. 76 % were found with cranial deformities.

5000|$|March 16, 2016 - Oregon {{announced}} that the NCAA had awarded senior Chris Boucher an extra year of eligibility.

The NCAA initially treated the end of his final year of high school as his graduation date and his prep school year as his first year of college competition. Oregon applied for a waiver from the NCAA, citing serious family hardship during Boucher's high school years, the abbreviated nature of his prep school basketball season, and his satisfactory academic progress at Oregon.|$|E

30|$|The Canada-Jamaica {{program was}} {{discontinued}} in late 2011. There is no publicly-available independent {{evaluation of the}} causes of this closure. Reid (2012) reports that of the 156 students who had completed training by May 2011, only 30 had departed for Canada. NorQuest canceled its contract with the <b>Pre-University</b> <b>School</b> in 2011. Even students who did not migrate were required to pay up front J$ 270, 000 tuition, C$ 1, 500 to Marmicmon and C$ 300 to NorQuest. A central problem was that many of the students were unable to complete practical portions of their training in Jamaica—required for licensing in Canada—because the <b>Pre-University</b> <b>School</b> had accepted students unable to enter practical training for technical reasons (Reid 2011). There also appear to have been unexpected delays in placing even fully qualified graduates with employers in Canada, disagreements over cost sharing between Canadian and Jamaican partner institutions, and a lack of employer participation in training finance to diminish students’ risk exposure.|$|E

40|$|There is {{a popular}} {{movement}} within Swedish universities and university colleges towards delivery of courses and degree programmes {{through the medium of}} English. This is particularly true in natural science, engineering and medicine where such teaching has been commonplace for some time. However, the rationale for using English as the language of instruction appears to be more a pragmatic response to outside pressures rather than a conscious educational decision. This situation has recently been challenged with the publication of the report of the Parliamentary Committee for the Swedish Language, Mål i Mun, which discusses the effects of so called domain losses to English.   This paper gives an overview of the continuing debate surrounding teaching through the medium of English, and examines some of the research carried out in this area. In contrast to the wealth of studies carried out in the <b>pre-university</b> <b>school</b> world, very few studies have been identified at university level. One conclusion is that little appears to be known about what goes on when Swedish university students are taught in English by Swedish lecturers.
