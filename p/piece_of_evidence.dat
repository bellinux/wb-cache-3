5|$|The {{appeal is}} based upon fresh {{evidence}} that was not available at the original trial, it is hoped the conviction will be quashed and a retrial ordered... Upon his conviction, Mr Park's family and friends launched a campaign to clear his name, claiming there was no single <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> that pointed indisputably to him.|$|E
5|$|The strongest <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> {{presented}} by the prosecution were details revealed in a secretly recorded telephone conversation between the defendant and her sister, Naima, in which LMme M'Barek discussed £100,000 (€150,000) blood money paid to her brother. She additionally recounted precisely how {{she was going to}} blame her brother for her husband's death.|$|E
5|$|A {{particularly}} damning <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> {{came from}} a bonnetmaker named Maria Durden who told the court that Webster had visited her {{a week before the}} murder and had said {{that she was going to}} Birmingham to sell some property, jewellery and a house that her aunt had left her. The jury interpreted this as a sign that Webster had premeditated the murder and convicted her after deliberating for about an hour and a quarter.|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> evaluation, where the {{probability}} <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> given a certain hypothesis is considered, different <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> are often combined in a naive way by assuming conditional independence. In this paper {{we present a}} number of results {{that can be used}} to assess both the importance of a reliable likelihood-ratio estimate and the impact of neglecting dependencies among <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> for the purpose <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> evaluation. We analytically study the effect of changes in dependencies between <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> on the likelihood ratio, and provide both theoretical and empirical bounds on the error in likelihood occasioned by assuming independences that do not hold in practice. In addition, a simple measure of influence strength between <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> is proposed...|$|R
40|$|The article investigates an {{evidence-based}} semantics for epistemic logics {{in which}} <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> are interpreted as equivalence relations on the epistemic worlds. It is {{shown that the}} properties of knowledge obtained from potentially infinitely many <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> are described by modal logic S 5. At the same time, the properties of knowledge obtained from only a finite number <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> are described by modal logic S 4. The main technical result is a sound and complete bi-modal logical system that describes properties of these two modalities and their interplay...|$|R
5|$|Apollo and {{his mentor}} Kristoph Gavin, {{an old friend}} of Phoenix's, are called to {{represent}} him against charges of murdering one of his customers in a rigged game of poker. In the middle of his testimony, Phoenix inadvertently names Kristoph as a witness, {{and with the help of}} a falsified <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> provided by Trucy, exposes him as the real murderer. Impressed by Apollo's performance, he invites him to start his own practice out of Trucy's talent agency.|$|E
5|$|Did Siletzia pivot {{about its}} {{northern}} end or southern end? This question has attracted considerable attention, {{with the evidence}} now favoring a northern pivot. A key <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> is that the Crescent Formation is laid over sediments (the Blue Mountain unit) derived from the continent, including boulders of quartz diorite some 65 million years old; this requires the Crescent Formation to have formed close to the continent.|$|E
5|$|In the {{courtroom}} trials, the player aims {{to prove their}} clients' innocence. In order to do so, they cross-examine witnesses; during these cross-examinations, the player aims to find lies and inconsistencies in the witnesses' testimonies. They are {{able to go back}} and forth between the different statements in the testimony, and can press the witness for more details on a statement. When the player finds an inconsistency, they can present a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> that contradicts the statement. In the Nintendo DS version, the player can choose to press and present by using vocal commands, and in the Wii version, players have the option to present evidence by swinging the Wii Remote. At certain points, the player has to answer questions from the judge, the witnesses, or the prosecutor through a multiple-choice answer selection, or by presenting evidence that supports Phoenix's claims. On the screen, a number of exclamation marks are shown; if the player presents an incorrect <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> one of the exclamation marks disappear. If all disappear, the client is found guilty and the player must restart. When the player solves a case, they unlock a new one to play.|$|E

5|$|Most {{of these}} eleven fossils include {{impressions}} of feathers. Because these feathers are of an advanced form (flight feathers), these fossils are {{evidence that the}} evolution of feathers began before the Late Jurassic. The type specimen of Archaeopteryx was discovered just two years after Charles Darwin published On the Origin of Species. Archaeopteryx seemed to confirm Darwin's theories and has since become a key <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> for the origin of birds, the transitional fossils debate, and confirmation of evolution.|$|E
5|$|One <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> {{for such}} a past {{resonance}} is Miranda's unusually high orbital inclination (4.34°) for a body {{so close to the}} planet. The largest Uranian moons may be internally differentiated, with rocky cores at their centers surrounded by ice mantles. Titania and Oberon may harbor liquid water oceans at the core/mantle boundary. The major moons of Uranus are airless bodies. For instance, Titania was shown to possess no atmosphere at a pressure larger than 10–20nanobar.|$|E
5|$|Several months later, Miles is {{put under}} hypnosis.

40|$|Expert systems {{applications}} that involve uncertain inference {{can be represented}} by a multidimensional contingency table. These tables offer a general approach to inferring with uncertain evidence, because they can embody any form of association between any number <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> and conclusions. (Simpler models may be required, however, if the number <b>of</b> <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> bearing on a conclusion is large.) This paper presents a method of using these tables to make uncertain inferences without assumptions of conditional independence among <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> or heuristic combining rules. As evidence is accumulated, new joint probabilities are calculated so as to maintain any dependencies among the <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> that {{are found in the}} contingency table. The new conditional probability of the conclusion is then calculated directly from these new joint probabilities and the conditional probabilities in the contingency table.

5|$|Because it {{displays}} features {{common to}} both birds and non-avian dinosaurs, Archaeopteryx {{has often been}} considered a link between them. In the 1970s, John Ostrom, following Thomas Henry Huxley's lead in 1868, argued that birds evolved within theropod dinosaurs and Archaeopteryx was a critical <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> for this argument; it had several avian features, such as a wishbone, flight feathers, wings, and a partially reversed first toe along with dinosaur and theropod features. For instance, it has a long ascending process of the ankle bone, interdental plates, an obturator process of the ischium, and long chevrons in the tail. In particular, Ostrom found that Archaeopteryx was remarkably similar to the theropod family Dromaeosauridae.|$|E
5|$|In {{the weeks}} and months after {{conclusion}} of the Inquiry one possible explanation of the crash began to circulate among employees of ANA. This possibility began with one <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> uncovered by the Inquiry during cross-examination of ANA's ground staff. It was reported that after sunrise the morning after the crash the one-gallon container used to check Amana's fuel filters was found empty and lying on its side on the apron a short distance from where Amana had been parked. The Inquiry attached no significance to this evidence and did not explore it further.|$|E
5|$|Like other {{forensic}} fields, forensic anthropologists {{are held}} to {{a high level of}} ethical standards due to their work in the legal system. Individuals who purposefully misrepresent themselves or any <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> can be sanctioned, fined, or imprisoned by the appropriate authorities depending on the severity of the violation. Individuals who fail to disclose any conflict of interests or who fail to report all of their findings, regardless of what they may be, can face disciplinary actions. It is important that forensic anthropologists remain impartial during the course of an investigation. Any perceived bias during an investigation could hamper efforts in court to bring the responsible parties to justice.|$|E

5|$|On February 2, 1425, Bartolomeo Valori and Cosimo de' Medici {{requested}} 400 of the 800florins {{that had}} been deposited with the Calimala, likely for work already completed. This deposit was insurance in case the executors left the tomb unfinished and the Calimala was forced to pay for its completion, {{as it had been}} obliged to with the finger reliquary. This request is also the most direct <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> for Cosimo's involvement with the commissioning. Despite this document, Vasari's claim in his Vite of 1550 that Cosimo was responsible for the handling of the commission has been questioned.|$|E
5|$|Several {{lines of}} {{evidence}} point to ongoing volcanic activity on Venus. During the Soviet Venera program, the Venera 9 orbiter obtained spectroscopic evidence of lightning on Venus, and the Venera 12 descent probe obtained additional evidence of lightning and thunder. The European Space Agency's Venus Express in 2007 detected whistler waves further confirming {{the occurrence of}} lightning on Venus. One possibility is that ash from a volcanic eruption was generating the lightning. Another <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> comes from measurements of sulfur dioxide concentrations in the atmosphere, which dropped {{by a factor of}} 10 between 1978 and 1986, jumped in 2006, and again declined 10-fold. This may mean that levels had been boosted several times by large volcanic eruptions.|$|E
5|$|These events {{led to a}} {{conflict}} with Ivan Sratsimir, who was in turn given the rule of Vidin, probably as a compensation.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the role <b>of</b> coherence <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> in what I call the non-dynamic model of confirmation. It appears that {{other things being}} equal, a higher degree <b>of</b> coherence among <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> raises to a higher degree the probability of the proposition they support. I argue against this view {{on the basis of}} three related observations. First, {{we should be able to}} assess the impact of coherence on any hypothesis <b>of</b> interest the <b>evidence</b> supports. Second, the impact of coherence among the <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> can be different on different hypotheses of interest they support. Third, when we assess the impact of coherence on a hypothesis of interest, other conditions that should be held equal for a fair assessment include the degrees of individual support which the propositions directly supported by the respective <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> provide for the hypothesis. Once we take these points into consideration, the impression that coherence <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> plays a positive role in confirmation dissipates. In some cases it can be shown that other things being equal, a higher degree of coherence among the <b>pieces</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> reduces the degree of confirmation for the hypothesis they support...|$|R
5|$|This {{approach}} was first {{applied to the}} hydrolysis reaction catalysed by chymotrypsin. Often, the detection of an intermediate is a vital <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> in investigations of what mechanism an enzyme follows. For example, in the ping–pong mechanisms that are shown above, rapid kinetic measurements can follow the release of product P and measure {{the formation of the}} modified enzyme intermediate E*. In the case of chymotrypsin, this intermediate is formed by an attack on the substrate by the nucleophilic serine in the active site and the formation of the acyl-enzyme intermediate.|$|E
5|$|When {{trying to}} explain past phenomena, paleontologists and other {{historical}} scientists often construct a set of hypotheses about the causes and then look for a smoking gun, a <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> that indicates that one hypothesis is a better explanation than others. Sometimes the smoking gun is discovered by a fortunate accident during other research. For example, the discovery by Luis Alvarez and Walter Alvarez of an iridium-rich layer at the Cretaceous–Tertiary boundary made asteroid impact and volcanism the most favored explanations for the Cretaceous–Paleogene extinction event.|$|E
5|$|During the {{courtroom}} sections, the player defends their client and cross-examines the witnesses. They can {{move back and}} forth between the statements in each testimony; if they find a contradiction between a statement and the evidence, they can point out the contradiction by presenting a relevant <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>evidence</b> or character profile. The player can also choose to question a statement, which sometimes leads to changes in the testimony. A life bar, representing the judge's patience, is shown in the upper right corner of the screen. If the player presents incorrect evidence or profiles, the bar will decrease; if it reaches zero, the player loses and their client is declared guilty. The bar will also decrease if the player makes mistakes while trying to break psyche-locks; however, the player can not lose while trying to break psyche-locks. 50% of the life bar gets restored when the player manages to break a psyche-lock, and it gets fully restored when the player completes an episode.|$|E
