5|$|A {{wide range}} of birds were eaten, {{including}} swans, <b>peafowl,</b> quail, partridge, storks, cranes, larks, linnets and other songbirds that could be trapped in nets, and just about any other wild bird that could be hunted. Swans and <b>peafowl</b> were domesticated to some extent, but were only eaten by the social elite, and more praised for their fine appearance as stunning entertainment dishes, entremets, than for their meat. As today, geese and ducks had been domesticated but were not as popular as the chicken, the fowl equivalent of the pig. Curiously enough the barnacle goose was believed to reproduce not by laying eggs like other birds, but by growing in barnacles, and was hence considered acceptable food for fast and Lent. But at the Fourth Council of the Lateran (1215), Pope Innocent III explicitly prohibited the eating of barnacle geese during Lent, arguing that they lived and fed like ducks and so were of the same nature as other birds.|$|E

This study was performed to determine the seroprevalence of T. gondii infection in <b>peafowls</b> in Yunnan Province, southwestern China.

5|$|In Siberia, {{the main}} prey species are Manchurian wapiti and wild boar (the two species {{comprising}} nearly 80% of the prey selected) followed by sika deer, moose, roe deer, and musk deer.

In Sumatra, prey include sambar deer, muntjac, wild boar, Malayan tapir and orangutan. In the former Caspian tiger's range, prey included saiga antelope, camels, Caucasian wisent, yak, and wild horses.

25|$|In {{recent years}} {{controversy}} also involved the peacock tail, {{the most famous}} symbol {{of the principle of}} sexual selection. A seven-year Japanese study of free-ranging <b>peafowl</b> {{came to the conclusion that}} female <b>peafowl</b> do not select mates merely on the basis of their trains. Mariko Takahashi found no evidence that peahens expressed any preference for peacocks with more elaborate trains, such as trains having more ocelli, a more symmetrical arrangement or a greater length. Takahashi determined that the peacock's train was not the universal target of female mate choice, showed little variance across male populations, and, based on physiological data collected from this group of <b>peafowl,</b> do not correlate to male physical conditions. Adeline Loyau and her colleagues responded to Takahashi's study by voicing concern that alternative explanations for these results had been overlooked and that these might be essential for the understanding of the complexity of mate choice. They concluded that female choice might indeed vary in different ecological conditions. Jordania suggested that peacock's display of colourful and oversize train with plenty of eyespots, together with their extremely loud call and fearless behaviour has been formed by the forces of natural selection (not sexual selection), and served as a warning (aposematic) display to intimidate predators and rivals.|$|E
