5|$|Ambulances {{often have}} two manufacturers. The first is {{frequently}} {{a manufacturer of}} light trucks or full-size vans (or previously, cars) such as Mercedes-Benz, Nissan, Toyota, or Ford. The second manufacturer (known as second stage manufacturer) purchases the vehicle (which is sometimes purchased incomplete, having no body or interior behind the driver's seat) and turns it into an ambulance by adding bodywork, emergency vehicle equipment, and interior fittings. This is done by one of two methods – either coachbuilding, where the modifications are started from scratch and built on to the vehicle, or using a modular system, where a <b>pre-built</b> 'box' is put on to the empty chassis of the ambulance, and then finished off.|$|E
5|$|About {{the time}} of the first landing in 1969, it was decided to use an {{existing}} Saturn V to launch the Skylab orbital laboratory <b>pre-built</b> on the ground, replacing the original plan to construct it in orbit from several Saturn IB launches; this eliminated Apollo 20. NASA's yearly budget also began to shrink in light of the successful landing, and NASA also had to make funds available for the development of the upcoming Space Shuttle. By 1971, the decision was made to also cancel missions 18 and 19. The two unused Saturn Vs became museum exhibits at the John F. Kennedy Space Center on Merritt Island, Florida, George C. Marshall Space Center in Huntsville, Alabama, Michoud Assembly Facility in New Orleans, Louisiana, and Lyndon B. Johnson Space Center in Houston, Texas.|$|E
5|$|Flight Unlimited II is {{a flight}} {{simulator}} video game: its gameplay is a simulation of piloting real-world planes. Players may control the Piper PA-28R-200, de Havilland Canada DHC-2 Beaver, Beechcraft Baron 58, North American P-51D Mustang or Cessna 172. The interactive cockpit of each plane {{is based on}} its real-world counterpart, and it contains simulated flight instruments such as an airspeed indicator, a heading indicator and a VOR indicator, among others. The player begins by engaging in a Quick Flight or by using the fixed-base operator (FBO) interface. In a Quick Flight, the player selects a plane and the flying conditions before taking off; the FBO interface features additional options, such as lessons, flight plans and adventures. The game's six lessons detail such maneuvers as takeoffs and taxiing. Adventures are <b>pre-built</b> missions, with objectives such as landing on an aircraft carrier, helping a prisoner to escape from Alcatraz Island or dropping turkeys into Candlestick Park. There are 25 adventures in total.|$|E
5|$|Random dungeons {{were created}} for each {{floor of the}} dungeon by {{selecting}} ten to twenty rooms from a <b>pre-built</b> library of 200 layouts, adding in the monsters, items, and other features, and then including fixed rooms that would be found on each floor, such as a boss room and treasure room. In expanding the gameplay, McMillen used the structure of Zeldas dungeons to design how the player would progress through the game. In a typical Zelda dungeon, according to McMillen, the player acquires a new item that helps them to progress farther in the game; he took the same inspiration to assure that each level in Isaac included at least one item and one bonus item on defeating the boss that would boost the character's attributes. McMillen also wanted to encourage players to experiment to learn how things work within Isaac, mirroring how Miyamoto had done with the original Zelda game. He designed the level progression to become more difficult with the player's progression in the game, as well as additional content that became available after beating the game as to make it feel like the game was long. McMillen designed four of the selectable characters based on the main classes of Dungeons & Dragons—fighter, thief, cleric and wizard.|$|E
25|$|The {{player can}} choose between playing a pre-made {{inhabited}} lot, moving a household into an unoccupied <b>pre-built</b> lot, or constructing a building {{on an empty}} lot. One novelty from The Sims is foundations.|$|E
25|$|Players {{control a}} <b>pre-built</b> or custom {{sovereign}} and {{belong to a}} faction; each has characteristics affecting gameplay. Influence over land and resources is gained by founding cities, introducing the ability to train characters and research spells and technologies. Cities can be improved to provide additional space or generate money, resources or prestige (a factor in population growth).|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{dangerous}} and expensive nature of training on heavy equipment, simulation {{has become a}} common solution across many industries. Types of simulated equipment include cranes, mining reclaimers and construction equipment, among many others. Often the simulation units will include <b>pre-built</b> scenarios by which to teach trainees, {{as well as the}} ability to customize new scenarios. Such equipment simulators are intended to create a safe and cost effective alternative to training on live equipment.|$|E
25|$|The game {{revolves}} around the player's control of a small character, known as a Sackboy or Sackgirl — or gender-neutral Sackperson — owing to their appearance, {{in a variety of}} platforming scenarios. Though the game features a set of <b>pre-built</b> levels for the player to explore, the game's customisable nature is equally important, from altering the player's character and personal space, to building entirely new objects and levels, and then sharing and playing them online with other players as part of the LittleBigPlanet community.|$|E
25|$|The {{encounter}} between the 274th VC Main Force Regiment and the US 11th Armored Cavalry {{shown in the}} diagram above illustrates several facets of the contending forces. The ambush took place on Highway 1, a vital road artery close to Saigon. There {{seems to have been}} careful preparation by Communist forces, including <b>pre-built</b> bunkers to shelter troops from US firepower along the line of retreat. A number of vehicles were destroyed but US airpower broke up the VC concentrations. A follow-up sweep by US forces killed a small number of additional VC but the bulk of them escaped.|$|E
25|$|The Play {{section of}} LittleBigPlanet {{consists}} {{of a number of}} levels that have been created by Media Molecule, and are based around different themes that draw inspiration from real-world locations, such as Japanese gardens, dry Mexican deserts, New York City streets, icy Russian stages, and other places. By completing the levels available to them (by reaching the scoreboard), the player may then advance the story and play further unlocked levels. The story mode comprises eight themed areas, with each area containing three or four main levels, and some of these levels in turn contain collectable keys to unlock bonus mini-levels. The main story mode comprises more than 50 <b>pre-built</b> levels in total.|$|E
25|$|The {{game has}} the same concept as its predecessor: players control their Sims in various {{activities}} and form relationships {{in a manner similar}} to real life. The Sims 2, like its predecessor, does not have a defined final goal; gameplay is open-ended. Sims have life goals, wants and fears, the fulfillment of which can produce both positive or negative outcomes. All Sims age, and can live to 90 sim days depending on the degree to which their aspirations are fulfilled. The Sims 2 builds on its predecessor by allowing Sims to age through six stages of life and incorporating a 3D graphics engine. Although gameplay is not linear, storylines exist in the game's <b>pre-built</b> neighborhoods. Pleasantview is based 25 years after the town in the original The Sims. Strangetown's storyline is based on the supernatural, and is loosely connected with Pleasantview. Veronaville's characters are based on Shakespearean characters.|$|E
25|$|In some {{circumstances}} Front fortifications {{did not follow}} the layout scheme described above. Bunkers and fighting holes were scattered more widely to delay attackers, and create the psychological impression that they were surrounded on all sides. Lookout posts were often positioned on key trails, routes and likely US helicopter landing zones. To enhance their mobility during a defensive battle, numerous air-raid shelters, bunkers and trenches were <b>pre-built</b> in advance around an area of operations. This involved {{an enormous amount of}} labor but proved their value in maneuvering under ARVN/US attacks. Foxholes dug by VC troops during the victorious Battle of Ap Bac are testimony to the insurgents almost religious dedication to field fortifications. The holes were dug so deep that a man could stand inside. Excavation of dirt was from the rear, hiding telltale traces of the digging. Only a direct hit by an artillery shell or bomb could kill troops inside such holes. Behind the line of foxholes, the Viet Cong utilized and improved an irrigation ditch, allowing them concealed movement, communication and transmission of supplies on foot or by sampan. Most of these fighting positions were invisible from the air.|$|E

The deck may also have up to a fifteen card sideboard, which allows players to modify their deck. Normally {{the first player to}} win two games is the winner of the match.|$|E
500|$|Over time, PHP interpreters became {{available}} on most existing 32-bit and 64-bit operating systems, either by building {{them from the}} PHP source code, or by using <b>pre-built</b> binaries. [...] For the PHP versions 5.3 and 5.4, the only available Microsoft Windows binary distributions were 32-bit x86 builds, requiring Windows 32-bit compatibility mode while using Internet Information Services (IIS) on a 64-bit Windows platform. [...] PHP version 5.5 made the 64-bit x86-64 builds available for Microsoft Windows.|$|E
500|$|Players {{assume the}} role of either one of several <b>pre-built</b> or {{custom-built}} minifigures and compete against other minifigure characters in races set across different tracks in the Legoland universe, using a variety of cars built out of Lego. At the beginning of each race, the player can perform a [...] "Turbo Start", which allows the player to start the race at full speed. Throughout races, the player can also perform power slides and [...] "Super Slides", which allow the player's car to turn around corners more sharply.|$|E
500|$|Director Leonard Boyarsky {{considered}} the animation system {{important in the}} team's choice of the Source engine. The integrated [...] "faceposer" [...] tool allowed Troika to customize facial animations, expressions, gestures and lip-synching, eliminating the need to explain what a character was doing. Every non-player character required a voiceover, which helped Troika define its characters more quickly. The engine had a physics system permitting new features, such as monsters hurling corpses at the player or dying characters realistically crumbling into pieces, instead of requiring <b>pre-built</b> animations. Although Troika had ignored first-person engines due to technical limitations, such as a low polygon count and limited texture memory, as the technology improved, it thought it could create a real-time action game without sacrificing the immersion and story of a role-playing game.|$|E

500|$|McMillen {{worked on}} level design and artwork, while Refenes coded the game; it was tested {{primarily}} by the pair and their families. McMillen and Refenes lived {{on opposite sides of}} the United States, and met only a few times in person while working on the game. They developed the control scheme by iterating through several designs, trying to find one that felt fluid and logical. Rather than use a <b>pre-built</b> game engine, Refenes programmed an original one. The game was initially set to include around 100 levels, and to have co-operative and competitive multiplayer modes. During development, however, the multiplayer option was dropped and the number of levels was greatly increased. The pair designed the game to be deliberately [...] "retro", imitating the aesthetics of traditional platform games, but with a modern sensibility regarding difficulty. They wanted the game to be rewarding and challenging, rather than frustrating; to this end they included infinite lives, quick restarts of levels, obvious goals, and short levels. They felt the replay feature transformed death into a form of reward.|$|E
500|$|The {{game was}} {{criticized by the}} South China Morning Post for lacking documentation, making it more {{difficult}} to learn how to play the game. They also predicted that players would be unhappy with the game's speed, as time {{plays an important role in}} earning money from tenants. Before the player can purchase new facilities, a long period of time must pass before income is earned from tenants. The newspaper was also unhappy with complaints from tenants; specific reasons for their dissatisfaction are never given. The Age was disappointed by the lack of <b>pre-built</b> towers and scenarios, suggesting that one along the lines of The Towering Infernos plot could have been included. Game Informer referred to SimTower as a [...] "lesser-known" [...] simulation game, and described it as [...] "fun and addictive". Writing for the San Diego Union-Tribune, Matt Miller felt that, when compared to SimCity 2000 (1993), gameplay in SimTower moved slowly. He also disliked the moments when he had to wait several minutes to pass by before he could make enough money to purchase new additions for his building. Dragon magazine's reviewers Jay and Dee praised the visuals and gameplay. However, the two commented that the game can feel slow because it lacks gameplay elements and options present in other strategy games. In 1995, the Software and Information Industry Association listed SimTower as the [...] "Best Simulation Program" [...] in the Consumer software category of their annual CODiE awards.|$|E
500|$|Sharma was {{recommended}} {{for the part}} of AJ by Nitin Ganatra (Masood) after the character was described to him, because producers wanted AJ and Masood to be funny together. The two actors had previously performed in comedy together in short film The Drop, Channel 4's Meet the Magoons and a programme called To Eat with Your Fingers, so Ganatra thought Sharma would be perfect for the role {{and he was the}} first person he thought of. Ganatra and the producers went through ideas of how a brother would affect Masood and what their relationship would be. Ganatra explained that he thought Masood only had one brother until he was told about AJ. When Sharma and Ganatra performed a scene together at Sharma's audition, the dialogue came so naturally to them that producers thought they were improvising, but, as Ganatra explained, they [...] "know each other's style [...] have all these shortcuts. It's like having a real brother." [...] Sharma was offered the part immediately after his interview. Sharma added in March 2013: [...] "I've known Nitin for years and he really lobbied for me to get the role of AJ, and as soon as I finished my audition the producers offered me the part and asked if I wanted a cup of tea, to which I replied, 'Yes please, I've waited 20 years for that cup of tea', but it's been really nice to just jump onto a set with someone I've already bonded with—it's like having a <b>pre-built</b> family to bounce off." [...] He had also previously worked with his co-stars Nina Wadia (Zainab) and Marc Elliott (Syed Masood), so felt it was [...] "cool" [...] and [...] "familiar" [...] to work with them. Sharma revealed in an interview with Inside Soap that his own mother always thought he should play Masood's brother after watching EastEnders for many years. The first scene Sharma filmed was with Ganatra on the set outside The Queen Victoria public house, and he found it [...] "really surreal".|$|E

2500|$|As {{computing}} {{and graphics}} power increased, so too did {{the size of}} development teams, as larger staffs were needed to address the ever-increasing technical and design complexities. The larger teams consist of programmers, artists, game designers, and producers. Their salaries can range anywhere from $50,000 to $120,000 generating large labor costs for firms producing videogames which can often take between one and three years to develop. Now budgets typically reach millions of dollars despite {{the growing popularity of}} middleware and <b>pre-built</b> game engines. [...] In addition to growing development costs, marketing budgets have grown dramatically, sometimes consisting of two to three times of the cost of development.|$|E
2500|$|These Liberty {{ships were}} {{completed}} in two-thirds {{the amount of}} time and at a quarter {{of the cost of the}} average of all other shipyards. The Liberty ship [...] was assembled in less than five days as a part of a special competition among shipyards; but by 1944 it was only taking the astonishingly brief time of a little over two weeks to assemble a Liberty ship by standard methods. They pre-assembled major parts of the ship including the hull sections at various locations in the shipyard and then, when needed, moved them with heavy lift cranes to the shipyard launching site, where they welded the <b>pre-built</b> sections together. After the ships were launched they were finished to their final configuration while afloat, and the launchway was available to start building another ship.|$|E
2500|$|The {{personal}} {{spaces for}} users, also called [...] "apartments", {{play an important}} role in the game. Users are able to buy and customize apartments for vPoints and/or vBux. There are nine apartments for sale, an additional one is still existing and accessible but not for sale anymore. Every vSider starts with a free basic apartment, the NV255 Loft. Every apartment is focussed on a unique type of vSider with unique needs. All apartments except the Islands are <b>pre-built.</b> The themes and purposes of the vSide apartments go from a Club ("Club Rage") to an empty building space ("The Islands") for creative users who want to build their own apartments. According to Josh Michaels, the idea of apartment slots (before apartment ownership was introduced) was borrowed from an IRC chat room. As of vSide Beta 2 the games was slowly going to apartment ownership as customizing rooms was enabled.|$|E

Those, along with objects that have been {{constructed}} out of simple shapes can be given specific materials, which act in a manner physically similar to those they represent. Examples include soft sponge, gripping rubber, and tough wood. Objects that are built with mechanical components, such as motors, pistons, jets, wires and springs also act appropriately. Along with these objects, levels contain dangers that the player must avoid. Examples include objects or platforms that have been set on fire, and explosives that can damage the player's Sackboy if he strays too close. [...] Explosives {{can also be used}} to blow up sections of the level. The player's Sackboy can also be crushed to death if trapped under or between heavy items and drown in water. As the player progresses through the level, he encounters checkpoints - points from which the player can resume upon death.|$|E
2500|$|Structural {{violence}} is a term devised by Johan Galtung and liberation theologians during the 1960s to describe economic, political, legal, religious, and cultural social structures that harm and inhibit individuals, groups, and societies from reaching their full potential. Structural {{violence is}} structural because the causes of misery are [...] "embedded {{in the political and}} economic organization of our social world; they are violent because they cause injury to people." [...] Structural violence is different from personal or behavioral violence because it exclusively refers to preventable harm done to people by no one clear individual, but arises from unequal distribution of power and resources, <b>pre-built</b> into social structure. Structural violence broadly includes all kinds of violations of human dignity: absolute and relative poverty, social inequalities like gender inequality and racism, and outright displays of human rights violations. The idea of structural {{violence is a}}s old as the study of conflict and violence, [...] and so it can also be understood as related to social injustice and oppression.|$|E

2500|$|Communist forces {{deployed}} several countermeasures {{against the}} American tactics. Avoidance and concealment was a primary method- sometimes made more difficult by the [...] "sniffer" [...] technology. But chemical detection {{was not always}} reliable- and could be thrown off {{by the use of}} animal decoys, urine bucket diversions, or was affected by wind, rain and other factors. VC/NVA units also built their fortifications in the high brush along canal banks and streams- providing a route of easier escape from the American attack. These locations could be a double-edged sword: they gave clear fields of fire against American infantry but the adjacent rice paddies sometimes created convenient enemy landing zones, and the water escape routes could become bottlenecks. <b>Pre-built</b> fortifications and trenches helped shield the communist forces from annihilation as the ring closed in, and previously prepared ground, laced with booby-traps also delayed enemy forces. If there was enough advance warning, VC/NVA forces would prepare kill zones near or in likely landing spots. Trees could also make effective defensive positions. Booby traps were laid on trails and rice paddy dikes, and in jungle growth in a random pattern, and often caused multiple casualties to American troops.|$|E
2500|$|The game can {{be played}} {{in one of three}} modes; [...] "Single Player: Scenario", [...] "Multiplayer" [...] (via a LAN or online), or [...] "Campaign". In Scenario and Multiplayer modes, the player can choose from either a {{randomly}} generated or <b>pre-built</b> map, and then refine the game in various ways, such as adjusting the amount of raw materials available to each player {{at the start of the}} game. The player can also select the type of game to be played, choosing from [...] "Map Defaults" [...] (the game is played with predetermined settings, based on the specific map), [...] "Teams" [...] (the player can select any combination of teams and players allowing for up to twenty players) or [...] "No Teams" [...] (the player can choose from [...] "League", in which players receive points at the end of the game for ranking on Blue Byte's online league table; [...] "Free-for-All", in which each player/race competes against one another; [...] "Free Alliance", in which players/races can ally with one another; or [...] "Play Alone", in which there is only one player/race).

Players can also restrict access to certain packs and tools in the Toybox, including the Magic Wand. The Toy Shop replaces the Toy Spinner from the first game. Items that can be used in Toybox mode can be unlocked through Playset mode. In an attempt to make Toybox building easier, the game will feature improved and enhanced Toybox editor tools (including in-game [...] "brushes", that will automatically create scenery for players, including cities, dungeons and race tracks). Templates, <b>pre-built</b> mini-games when placed into a world or [...] "Auto Creators" [...] are also present in the game. Templates range from Cliff-side beat 'em up Battle Arenas (similar to Super Smash Bros.) to obstacle courses. Players can then tweak and change Templates to their liking. In order to add some Templates into the Toybox, players must decide the length, width and height of a box, that will house and generate the desired structure. A Challenge Maker has also be implemented into the game, allowing players to create structured games. Result screens were also added for competitive play Toyboxes. A new feature introduced in Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes is the Text Creator, which allows players to write their own text bubbles in the Toybox. All text, however, must be filter and moderated through a safe chat server. The game also introduces the Toy Box Game Maker, a tool that can restrict access to certain actions, including the use of the Magic Wand. An undo button has also been implemented into the game. Objects from the first game can be unlocked in Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes by placing a Disney Infinity Playset piece on the Disney Infinity: Marvel Super Heroes base. will also feature automated builders, that can be dropped into the Toybox and generate worlds for players. Automated builders include Eve from WALL-E and Sultan from Aladdin. In the Toybox mode players will also be able to create interior areas, a feature absent from the first game. Interior areas (styled in-game as INteriors) can also be themed to certain characters. More than twenty rooms can be added inside an INteriors.
