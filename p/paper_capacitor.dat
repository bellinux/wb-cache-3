25|$|One of {{the great}} {{advantages}} of plastic films for capacitor fabrication is that plastic films have considerably fewer defects than paper sheets used in <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors.</b> This allows the manufacture of plastic film capacitors with only a single layer of plastic film, whereas <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors</b> need a double layer of <b>paper.</b> Plastic film <b>capacitors</b> were significantly smaller in physical size (better volumetric efficiency), with the same capacitance value and the same dielectric strength as comparable <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors.</b> Then-new plastic materials also showed further advantages compared with paper. Plastic is much less hygroscopic than paper, reducing the deleterious effects of imperfect sealing. Additionally, most plastics are subject to fewer chemical changes over long periods, providing long-term stability of their electrical parameters. Since around 1980, paper and metallized <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors</b> (MP capacitors) have almost completely been replaced by PET film capacitors for most low-power DC electronic applications. Paper is now used only in RFI suppression or motor run capacitors, or as a mixed dielectric combined with polypropylene films in large AC and DC capacitors for high-power applications.|$|R

40|$|Oils {{extracted}} from Cucumeropsis edulis, Hevea brasiliensis (Para rubber), Hura crepitans (Sound box tree), Jatropha curcas (Physic nut), Khaya ivorensis (Lagos Mahogany) and Citrus sinensis (sweet orange) were assessed for such characteristic physical properties as colour, flavour (odour and taste), specific gravity, viscosity, dielectric constant, surface tension and refractive index. Specific gravity measurement varied between 0. 9004 - 0. 9113 at 80 �C and 0. 9125 - 0. 9207 at 30 �C. Viscosity measurement, in centipoises, ranged between 7. 35 - 9. 41 at 80 �C and 38. 44 - 60. 34 at 30 �C. Dielectric constant values varied between 1. 63 - 3. 88 within the temperature range of 26 - 80 �C. Surface tension values at 28. 5 �C were between 0. 03492 - 0. 03616 m - 1 and refractive index values at 28 �C lied between 1. 46469 and 1. 47072.

40|$|Partial {{discharge}} (PD) diagnostics are utilised {{to examine}} the aging process of mineral oil-impregnated-high density kraft <b>paper</b> <b>capacitor</b> bushing models, subjected to repetitive voltage switching surges. It is demonstrated that the PD measurements of cumulative apparent charge transfer and discharge inception stress constitute an effective means for assessing aging and its reversibility due to gas evolution and re-absorption or solubility of a mineral oil-impregnated-paper insulation system in the presence and absence of switching surges. While the experimental results indicate that electrically overstressed solid-liquid insulation can recover in part its initial electrical properties following an electrical stress-free period, long term stability is only effectively achieved by {{a reduction in the}} switching surge overstress through an increase in the overall insulation thickness. The electrical stress levels, employed in the experiments, are found to be not sufficiently elevated to lead to any detectable partial discharge formation within the oil phase itself; the observed discharge behavior is rather characteristic of the type that is normally associated with macroscopic cavities occluded within the oil-paper insulation systems...|$|E

25|$|Most EMI/RFI {{suppression}} film capacitors are metallized {{polypropylene film}} capacitors. However, {{some types of}} metallized <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors</b> (MP) are still used for this application, because they still have some advantages in flame resistance.|$|R
25|$|Film power {{capacitors}} mostly use {{polypropylene film}} as the dielectric. Other types include metallized <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors</b> (MP capacitors) and mixed dielectric film capacitors with polypropylene dielectrics. MP capacitors serve for cost applications and as field-free carrier electrodes (soggy foil capacitors) for high AC or high current pulse loads.

40|$|PFC del programa Erasmus EPS elaborat a International Faculty of Engineering LodzThis project aims to {{investigate}} possible energy savings that nanotechnology {{can bring to}} a conventional house, and build and test a capacitor constructed with bucky paper in the laboratory. To accomplish the first objective, we will focus on four main areas and we will study how to improve it with nanotechnology: 1. Generation: How to improve solar panels, fuel cells and wind turbines. These devices allow us to generate energy through natural sources, like the sun and wind and reduce the use of energy sources, traditional finite and polluting, such as crude oil. 2. Conversion: How to improve lighting and appliances to avoid a significant loss of energy when converting electricity into light or running appliances. Also to use the organic matter and convert waste into biogas. 3. Insulation: How to increase the isolation of a house using nanomaterials {{to help keep the}} house warm in winter and cool in summer, therefore saving on heating and air conditioning expenses. 4. Storage: How to improve batteries and capacitors to increase energy storage capacity {{so that it can be}} accessed when needed. To complete the second goal, in the laboratory we will build a bucky <b>paper</b> <b>capacitor</b> and also compare it with standard and super capacitors...|$|E
2500|$|Historically, {{the first}} “film” type <b>capacitors</b> were <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors</b> of film/foil configuration. They were fairly bulky, and not {{particularly}} reliable.

5000|$|Type - the {{dielectric}} {{used in the}} capacitor. Polyester and polypropylene are most common, with ceramic capacitors also being popular, especially in lower-end instruments. Reissues of vintage instruments often use reproductions of vintage <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors,</b> which are also popular aftermarket replacements. Finally, audiophile-grade polypropylene film and foil capacitors are sometimes used in custom instruments, although their size can prove problematic as they're designed for use in audio amplifiers and consequently have working voltages in excess of 500 V, far higher than anything encountered inside an electric guitar.|$|R
25|$|Capacitors, {{especially}} ceramic capacitors, {{and older}} designs such as <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors,</b> can absorb sound waves {{resulting in a}} microphonic effect. Vibration moves the plates, causing the capacitance to vary, in turn inducing AC current. Some dielectrics also generate piezoelectricity. The resulting interference is especially problematic in audio applications, potentially causing feedback or unintended recording. In the reverse microphonic effect, the varying electric field between the capacitor plates exerts a physical force, moving them as a speaker. This can generate audible sound, but drains energy and stresses the dielectric and the electrolyte, if any.|$|R

5000|$|The hazard was {{eliminated}} from later sets {{by the use}} of an internal ground bus connected to the chassis by an isolation network. Underwriters Laboratories required the adoption of the floating chassis, as isolation from the mains (the exact circuit and component values were not specified although the leakage current allowed was specified) to limit the shock to a [...] "safe" [...] current level. The chassis was maintained at RF ground (for shielding) by a bypass capacitor (typically 0.05 µF to 0.2 µF) usually with a resistor connected across it (typically 220 kΩ to 470 kΩ, although values as small as 22 kΩ were sometimes used or the resistor was simply omitted). Over the years, these <b>paper</b> <b>capacitors</b> often become leaky, and could allow sufficient current flow to give the user a shock.|$|R
40|$|Electronic {{capacitors}} {{were constructed}} via hand-printing on paper using pencil graphite. Graphite traces {{were used to}} draw conductive connections and capacitor plates on opposing sides of a sheet of standard notebook paper. The paper served as the dielectric separating the plates. Capacitance of the devices was generally < 1000 [*]pF and scaled with surface area of the plate electrodes. By combining a pencil-drawn capacitor with an additional resistive pencil trace, an RC low-pass filter was demonstrated. Further utility of the pencil-on-paper devices was demonstrated through description of a capacitive force transducer and reversible chemical sensing. The latter was achieved for water vapor when the hygroscopic cellulose matrix of the <b>paper</b> <b>capacitor’s</b> dielectric adsorbed water. The construction and demonstration of pencil-on-paper capacitive elements broadens the scope of paper-based electronic circuits while allowing new opportunities in the rapidly expanding field of paper-based sensors...|$|R
