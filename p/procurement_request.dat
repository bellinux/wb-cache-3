Promises of faster deployment and evolu-tionary capability, delighted customers and users, and fewer late-occurring acquisition problems are irresistible to the resource-strapped, schedule-limited, and continu-ously harried program managers and acquisition executives. However, where can the agile benefit really accrue? Primarily associated with software development, does the concept play into the large systems development that is typical of the defense environment? How does agility apply to the critical sys-tems engineering processes? While research is needed to fully answer these questions, we can begin to identify touch points that on the surface seem ripe for agile approaches. This article presents some thoughts on agility and systems engineering – how sys-tems engineering can be more agile and how it can support agility in other disci-plines. It is a concept discussion, not a spe-cific how-to article. However, looking at systems engineering through the agile lens can extend the dialogue that began between agile and plan-driven software proponents into the systems engineering world [1]. First of all, why should we care about agility within systems engineering? Table 1 identifies some of the changes in the envi-ronment facing systems and software developers. The rapid change in threats, requirements, and programmatic parame-ters has pushed traditional approaches to the limits of their capabilities. As a result, there is a growing zeitgeist that somewhat unfairly casts traditional systems engineer-ing as a holdover from the 1950 ’s and 1960 ’s and {{as a part of the}} systems acqui-sition and development problem.

The reported evaluation is based on a review of various documents associated with the procurement project and interviews with key individuals involved in the procurement. This includes individuals from the Michigan Department of Transportation (MDOT), the Michigan Department of Information Technology (MDIT), the Michigan Department of Management and Budget (DMB), Kimley-Horn of Michigan, which was commissioned under a separate contract to draft user needs and requirements for the procurement, and consulting firms responding to the <b>procurement’s</b> <b>Request</b> for Proposal (RFP). Positive experiences from the procurement include involvement of the entity that would be ultimately be responsible for ongoing system support; use of vendor demonstrations prior to drafting the RFP to help build a better understanding of what was available and feasible; use of technical requirements to steer submitted solutions towards what exactly was being sought; appropriate consideration of the State’s long-term needs; use of an evaluation committee covering various fields of expertise; and use of an external consulting firm to draft the system requirements. Negative experiences include the late involvement of MDIT; a potential loss of impetus due to the long interval between the draft and final RFP; a lack of continuity caused by the fact that few people were continuous throughout the project; a lack of involvement of operational staff; too much reliance on an external firm to draft the system needs, and the need to devote significant time to answer and review the high number of requirements attached to the RFP. Many of these negative experiences can directly be linked to the delays that resulted from transferring the project lead to MDIT and establishing for the first time an effective collaboration between these two agencies.

40|$|Since {{the rise}} of the Internet {{electronic}} markets have become an important component of e-procurement by bringing together demand and supply. E-markets are meeting venues for component suppliers and purchasers, who use exchange mechanisms to electronically support the procurement process. Exchange mechanisms can be conceived as market institutions providing sets of rules, which determine the functioning of the market and the permissible actions such as bidding deadlines, non-disclosure rules or bid-revocation constraints. In nowadays procurement landscape, mechanisms vary from electronic <b>procurement</b> catalogues, where <b>requests</b> and offers are publicly announced, to e-negotiationswhere the participants bargain over the conditions of a trade using electronic message exchange and / or decision support platforms, to auctions, where one or two sides automate the process during which participants from the other side compete against each other (Kersten, Neumann, Vahidov, & Chen, 2006). The variety of procurement solutions already suggests that there is no single best solution for all imaginable sourcing activities. Instead, some mechanisms like e. g. an auction might be advantageous in certain situations while others are not (and vice versa). In this paper we present a knowledge-based system (KMS) aimed at supporting procurement staff in their decision making on which mechanism to choose best for a specific sourcing scenario...|$|R
5000|$|Louise is {{mentioned}} in the poem [...] "A Satyr on Charles II", a poetical lampoon at the King's expense, written by John Wilmot, Earl of Rochester- in which she is referred to with her last name contrarily spelled Carwell; the work which was completed by the Earl {{near the end of}} Jan. 1673. At that time Charles II himself happened to <b>request</b> <b>procurement</b> of a specific piece by Wilmot which, upon delivery, he discerned that he had delivered directly {{into the hands of the}} King the impudent satire aimed at his person in the sought after text's stead- this led to Wilmot's abrupt flight from Court. Despite this incident there appears to be evidence of the absence of any malice felt by the King toward him- as he acquired posts in two coveted offices of the court of King Charles. Regardless of such a relief following such a scare, in the year 1675 after two years thus back among the Court, Rochester was again guilty of a slight against King Charles- this time by demolishing an elaborate sundial belonging to the king when he and a few companions stumbled upon it in the Privy Garden while in the midst of an alcohol induced revelry. Yet he did not finally meet with a prolonged banishment from Court until later near the end of summer of that same year, it was then that he was condemned by the Duchess of Portsmouth, the King's mistress- Louise herself. Despite his own declarations of ignorance as to his manner of offence, he would remain in banishment for the remaining five years before his death, which would come just five years prior to de Kerouaille's retirement from England's royal court and relocation to France.|$|R
40|$|A {{dissertation}} {{interim report}} {{submitted to the}} Faculty of Engineering and the Built Environment, University of Witwatersrand, in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science in Building. Public Private Partnerships (PPP) are a unique model for countries that wish to deliver infrastructure services to the communities they serve. This unique form of procurement combines the efforts of {{both the public and}} private sectors. PPP procurement allows governments with resource constraints to access private sector funds to implement their infrastructure and services delivery programmes. South Africa has taken a decision to adopt PPP’s {{as an alternative to the}} traditional form of infrastructure delivery. PPP’s are however a fairly new way of procurement for government departments. The delivery of PPP’s has therefore come with its own unique challenges that need to be addressed in order to make this type of procurement effective. South Africa has adopted world-class PPP procurement guidelines which are on par with those of established PPP markets. The PPP procurement process is outlined in the National Treasury’s PPP Manual and Standardised PPP Provisions. The PPP Manual provides guidelines for the implementation of the full project life-cycle of a PPP. PPP procurement forms an important part of the project lifecycle, and ensures that the outcomes of a PPP are met, being affordability, value for money, and equitable risk transfer for the contracting parties. The aim of this research was two-fold. Firstly, this research aims to investigate the time performance of the procurement process for PPP projects in South Africa. Secondly, the research aims to determine the factors that influence the time performance of the procurement process for these projects. The case study research strategy was identified as the most suitable method of addressing the research aims. The justification of the use of the case study strategy was based on the type of research questions posed, the extent of control the researcher had over behavioural events, and the ability of case studies to address the contemporary as opposed to historical events. In addition, the case study strategy was considered advantageous because it follows a rigorous methodical path that protects against threats of construct, internal and external validity. To this end, four cases were selected for the research. The cases selected were as follows:  Maropeng and Sterkfontein PPP Project;  Department of Statistics South Africa (DSSA) New Head Office Accommodation PPP Project;  Department of Foreign Affairs (DFA) New Head Office Accommodation PPP Project; and  Department of Rural Development and Land Reform (DRDLR) New Head Office Accommodation PPP Project. The cases were initially analysed individually, and thereafter a cross-case analysis was conducted. The cross-case analysis was used to identify trends and associations across cases, together with any differences worth highlighting. Analytical procedures were used to analyse the time performance of the PPP <b>procurement</b> process from <b>Request</b> for Qualification (RFQ) to Financial Close. Planned and actual procurement timelines were collected from the PPP procurement documentation (i. e. RFQ and RFP documentation) and the interview respondents respectively. Semi-structured interviews were used to collect qualitative information on the factors that the respondents deemed to have influenced the time performance of the procurement process for the selected cases. The interview questions were based on insights gained from the literature review related to the factors that influence the time performance of the PPP procurement process. It is envisaged that the insights gained from the research will go a long way to improving the time performance of the procurement process for PPP projects in South Africa. An improved time performance of the procurement process can lead to quicker delivery of PPP projects to marginalised communities where the need for infrastructure services is the highest.
