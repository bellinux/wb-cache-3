5|$|On 9 October 1941, President Roosevelt {{approved}} the atomic program after he convened {{a meeting with}} Vannevar Bush and Vice President Henry A. Wallace. To control the program, he created a Top <b>Policy</b> <b>Group</b> consisting of himself—although he never attended a meeting—Wallace, Bush, Conant, Secretary of War Henry L. Stimson, and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George C. Marshall. Roosevelt chose the Army to run the project rather than the Navy, because the Army had more experience with management of large-scale construction projects. He also agreed to coordinate the effort {{with that of the}} British, and on 11 October he sent a message to Prime Minister Winston Churchill, suggesting that they correspond on atomic matters.|$|E
5|$|Bush {{met with}} Roosevelt and Vice President Henry A. Wallace on October 9, 1941, {{to discuss the}} project. He briefed Roosevelt on Tube Alloys, the British atomic bomb project and its Maud Committee, which had {{concluded}} that an atomic bomb was feasible, and on the German nuclear energy project, about which little was known. Roosevelt approved and expedited the atomic program. To control it, he created a Top <b>Policy</b> <b>Group</b> consisting of himself—although he never attended a meeting—Wallace, Bush, Conant, Stimson and the Chief of Staff of the Army, General George Marshall. On Bush's advice, Roosevelt chose the army to run the project rather than the navy, although the navy had shown far more interest in the field, and was already conducting research into atomic energy for powering ships. Bush's negative experiences with the Navy had convinced him {{that it would not}} listen to his advice, and could not handle large-scale construction projects.|$|E

5|$|Bush {{soon became}} {{dissatisfied}} with the dilatory way the project was run, with its indecisiveness over the selection of sites for the pilot plants. He was particularly disturbed at the allocation of an AA-3 priority, which would delay completion of the pilot plants by three months. Bush complained about these problems to Bundy and Under Secretary of War Robert P. Patterson. Major General Brehon B. Somervell, {{the commander of the}} army's Services of Supply, appointed Brigadier General Leslie R. Groves as project director in September. Within days of taking over, Groves approved the proposed site at Oak Ridge, Tennessee, and obtained a AAA priority. At a meeting in Stimson's office on September 23 attended by Bundy, Bush, Conant, Groves, Marshall Somervell and Stimson, Bush put forward his proposal for steering the project by a small committee answerable to the Top <b>Policy</b> <b>Group.</b> The meeting agreed with Bush, and created a Military Policy Committee chaired by him, with Somervell's chief of staff, Brigadier General Wilhelm D. Styer, representing the army, and Rear Admiral William R. Purnell representing the navy.|$|E

The second effort succeeded; Miers announced her resignation January 4, 2007 and left January 31, 2007.

500|$|Meanwhile, {{there were}} two lines of {{research}} into nuclear reactor technology, with Harold Urey continuing research into heavy water at Columbia, while Arthur Compton brought the scientists working under his supervision from Columbia, California and Princeton University to join his team at the University of Chicago, where he organized the Metallurgical Laboratory in early 1942 to study plutonium and reactors using graphite as a neutron moderator. Briggs, Compton, Lawrence, Murphree, and Urey met on 23 May 1942 to finalize the S-1 Committee recommendations, which called for all five technologies to be pursued. This was approved by Bush, Conant, and Brigadier General Wilhelm D. Styer, {{the chief of staff}} of Major General Brehon B. Somervell's Services of Supply, who had been designated the Army's representative on nuclear matters. Bush and Conant then took the recommendation to the Top <b>Policy</b> <b>Group</b> with a budget proposal for $54million for construction by the United States Army Corps of Engineers, $31million for research and development by OSRD and $5million for contingencies in fiscal year 1943.

In January 1942, he assisted George and Walker in presenting an organizational plan to the War Department for maintaining the Air Corps {{as part of the}} Army during World War II, while dividing the Army into three autonomous branches, a reorganization adopted on March 9, 1942, with the creation of the Army Air Forces, Army Ground Forces and Services of Supply.

Groves' orders placed him directly under Somervell rather than Reybold, with Colonel Marshall now answerable to Groves. Groves established his headquarters in Washington, D.C., on the fifth floor of the New War Department Building, where Colonel Marshall had his liaison office. He assumed command of the Manhattan Project on 23 September. Later that day, he attended a meeting called by Stimson, which established a Military Policy Committee, responsible to the Top <b>Policy</b> <b>Group,</b> consisting of Bush (with Conant as an alternate), Styer and Rear Admiral William R.

500|$|Goldsmith, {{a member}} of the {{prominent}} Goldschmidt family, grew up in Ham, London. His early career was spent working in think-tanks and for The Ecologist magazine, of which he was editor from 2000 until 2006. He left The Ecologist in 2006 when he became deputy chairman of the Conservative Party's Quality of Life <b>Policy</b> <b>Group,</b> and he was elected as Conservative MP for Richmond Park at the 2010 general election. As a social and economic liberal, Goldsmith has campaigned for a small state with direct democracy. Goldsmith, having made his name editing an environmentalist magazine, opposed expansion of Heathrow and vowed to continue investment in public transport. He stated that he was in favour of [...] "right-to-buy" [...] schemes for buying homes, and wanted to expand housing stock through high-density, low-rise construction. Goldsmith announced his support for the UK leaving the European Union, reflecting his eurosceptic position. Goldsmith's aristocratic background was commented on, particularly in contrast to Khan's working-class roots, though some suggested this could have given Goldsmith an advantage.|$|E
500|$|Asked in a 2003 {{interview}} about his most enduring achievement {{as president of}} the FIA, Mosley replied: [...] "I think using Formula One to push ENCAP Crash-Testing." [...] The European New Car Assessment Programme (Euro NCAP) is a European car safety performance assessment programme that originated with work done by the Transport Research Laboratory for the UK Department for Transport. The FIA became involved in the programme in 1996, taking a lead in promoting it, and Mosley chaired the body from its launch as Euro NCAP in 1997 to 2004. Despite what NCAP describes as a [...] "strong negative response" [...] from car manufacturers at first, the initiative has expanded, and NCAP says {{that there has been a}} clear increase in the safety of modern cars as a result. The EU commission in 2000 stated that [...] "EuroNCAP had become the single most important mechanism for achieving advances in vehicle safety" [...] and [...] "the most cost effective road safety action available to the EU." [...] Mosley has continued to promote the matter through his membership of initiatives such as CARS 21, the European Commission’s <b>policy</b> <b>group</b> aimed at improving the worldwide competitiveness of the European automotive industry.|$|E
