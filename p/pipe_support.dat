40|$|Master's thesis in Structural engineeringStructural and piping stress {{analyses}} are generally conducted separately {{in most of}} the situations. A pipe stress analysis is performed based on loads caused by pressure, temperature variations, weight of the pipe (with contents) and blast. The pipes are analysed for several load cases separated into different design types like sustained, expansion and occasional. Established practice in piping design and calculation does not specifically account for structural flexibility. It is assumed that flexibility in the structure is minimal and that the structure is stiff relative to the piping load and in comparison with the piping itself. The objective of this thesis is to evaluate the conservatism of the established practice. Run different types of sensitivity analysis regarding stiffness of pipe versus stiffness of the supporting structure, i. e pipe-structure interaction. Limitations for this thesis I have chosen to look at a 20 inch pipe in a simplified system and is supported in ten equally spaced locations of 5 m. Three pipe thicknesses are chosen, 4. 73 mm, 12. 70 mm and 20. 62 mm. For calculations of piping stress and restraint support loads Caesar II has been used. Four pipe supports has been modeled using the structural analysis program STAAD. Pro. <b>Pipe</b> <b>support</b> in node 70 and 90 (Caesar ref.) is set as fixed to a concrete deck and <b>pipe</b> <b>support</b> in node 110 and 130 (Caesar ref.) is set as sliding restraints fixed to a steel beam deck. For design loads the vertical load is the weight of the operating pipe span carried by the supports, the horizontal load will be assumed equal to the friction force. The pipe line and the <b>pipe</b> <b>support</b> are also to be calculated to withstand explosion loads directed from 6 locations. This model for pipeline and supports will be tested in four cases. The first case: The established practice where structural and piping stress {{analyses are}} run separately. The second case: Structural and piping stress analyses will be runned combined by implementing the deck deflection calculated in the first case for <b>pipe</b> <b>support</b> in node 110 and 130. The supports for node 70 and 90 are fixed to concrete deck and are assumed to have zero deflection. The third case: Structural and piping stress analyses will be runned combined by implementing the max acceptable deck deflection (L/ 200) for <b>pipe</b> <b>support</b> in node 110 and node 130. The fourth case: In this case the <b>pipe</b> <b>support</b> for node 110 and 130 are set to fail, which means that these two pipe supports will not take any loads from the pipe, only direct blast loads. These four cases will be compared with respect to changes in pipeline restraint forces, utilization of pipe line stress, pipe line deflection, structural deck deflection, utilization of support beam, displacements in the <b>pipe</b> <b>support.</b> Figure 1 Model for piping and structural As a conclusion on the results from this thesis it can be stated that pipe lines with large stiffness can have a very big impact on the pipe supports when included the variation in deck deflection. On the other hand deflection did not seem to have any large impact on the pipe stress other than expansion in this thesis. A flexible pipe line seems to be more beneficial for a <b>pipe</b> <b>support</b> considering the restraint loads, thus leading to a higher utilization and deflection in pipe stress analysis. As I experienced in performing this thesis, interacting piping and structural is very time consuming and as current engineering schedule often means that structural deflection are not available at the time of pipe stress analysis, it will result in additional analysis, where the results might not give a result that makes any significance in the end. As a guide it is important to take in to consideration possible large deck deflections that can occur and have an impact on piping as vell as structural...|$|E

40|$|Inspection of {{corrosion}} at <b>pipe</b> <b>support</b> locations {{is difficult}} because of accessibility limitations. Recently a screening technique has been developed called Multi-Skip ultrasonics. The method utilizes a pitch-catch set-up. Shear waves are transmitted that reflect multiple times in the pipe wall, from which integral wall thickness information is obtained. The method {{turns out to be}} very sensitive in detecting the presence of wall loss, but {{it turns out to be}} difficult to determine the extent of the wall loss. If the extent is not known, only a conservative estimate of depth can be derived from the Multi-Skip signals, because of the accumulative nature of the change in arrival time due to wall loss. Multi-Skip tomography appears to be a promising method in addition to Multi-Skip screening as a follow-up inspection technique. It uses full wave field inversion to determine a wall thickness profile at a particular location of the pipe on the support. As with the Multi-Skip screening method, Multi-Skip tomography is applied with the transmitter and receiver on both sides of the <b>pipe</b> <b>support</b> location and waves traveling in the axial pipe direction. The wave field inversion consists of a forward modeling step that predicts the measured wave field after which an iterative comparison process with the actually measured wave field results in an estimate of the wall thickness profile under the support...|$|E

40|$|The {{inspection}} of wall loss corrosion is difficult at <b>pipe</b> <b>support</b> locations due to limited accessibility. However, the recently developed ultrasonic Multi-Skip screening technique {{is suitable for}} this problem. The method employs ultrasonic transducers in a pitch-catch geometry positioned {{on opposite sides of}} the <b>pipe</b> <b>support.</b> Shear waves are transmitted in the axial direction within the pipe wall, reflecting multiple times between the inner and outer surfaces before reaching the receivers. Along this path, the signals accumulate information on the integral wall thickness (e. g., via variations in travel time). The method is very sensitive in detecting the presence of wall loss, but it is difficult to quantify both the extent and depth of the loss. If the extent is unknown, then only a conservative estimate of the depth can be made due to the cumulative nature of the travel time variations. Multi- Skip tomography is an extension of Multi-Skip screening and has shown promise as a complimentary follow-up inspection technique. In recent work, we have developed the technique and demonstrated its use for reconstructing high-resolution estimates of pipe wall thickness profiles. The method operates via a model-based full wave field inversion; this consists of a forward model for predicting the measured wave field and an iterative process that compares the predicted and measured wave fields and minimizes the differences with respect to the model parameters (i. e., the wall thickness profile). This paper presents our recent developments in Multi-Skip tomographic inversion, focusing on the initial localization of corrosion regions for efficient parameterization of the surface profile model and utilization of the signal phase information for improving resolution...|$|E
