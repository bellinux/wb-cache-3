5|$|Most often, of course, the {{predicate}} {{consists of}} a verb. However, there are several types of nominal predicative constructions, {{with or without a}} copula. Auxiliaries that express direction and aktionsart (among other meanings) can with the assistance of a linking converb occupy the immediate postverbal position, e.g. uuž orhison drink- leave- 'drank up'. The next position is filled by converb suffixes in connection with the auxiliary, baj- 'to be', e.g. ter güjž bajna s/he run- be- 'she is running'. Suffixes occupying this position express grammatical aspect, e.g., progressive and resultative. In the next position, participles followed by baj- may follow, e.g., ter irsen bajna s/he come- be- 'he has come'. Here, an explicit perfect and habituality can be marked, which is aspectual in meaning as well. This position may be occupied by multiple suffixes in a single <b>predication,</b> and it can still be followed by a converbal Progressive. The last position is occupied by suffixes that express tense, evidentiality, modality, and aspect.|$|E
25|$|In this example, the v, what {{normally}} binds the pronoun, has all phi features {{bound to}} {{itself from the}} start. Kratzer describes <b>predication</b> as the subject pronoun that eventually becomes a relative pronoun. <b>Predication,</b> in (24) adopts the phi features from v. Kratzer predicts that the merging of DPs to a specifier position would only happen when the DPs are without phi features. In the event that a DP adopts phi features from v from <b>predication,</b> then {{there should be a}} clear distinction.|$|E
40|$|This work {{deals with}} verbonominal <b>predications.</b> It compares the {{frameworks}} {{of the phenomenon}} in English and in Czech. Furthermore, it examines the types and distribution of Czech counterparts to English verbonominal <b>predications.</b> The comparative analyses {{are based on the}} excerpts from authentic literary texts of both English and Czech origins and their respective translations. The results confirmed the wider usage of verbonominal <b>predications</b> in English and revealed the most frequent types of Czech counterparts. Moreover, they pointed to the interference of English verbonominal <b>predications</b> in Czech structures. The distinct distribution of verbonominal <b>predications</b> in English and in Czech supports the English nominal tendencies against the more verbal character of Czech...|$|R
40|$|The {{aim of this}} corpus {{study is}} to provide an {{adequate}} description of negation strategies in existential <b>predications</b> in Swedish. In Swedish, existential <b>predications</b> may be negated by a standard negative marker. Another possibility to negate existence is by using a negative indefinite pronoun. In negation of existential <b>predications</b> in Swedish, the choice between standard negation and indefinite pronouns, whether negative or not, has not been previously described in any descriptive or theoretical work. It is therefore {{the purpose of the}} current study to describe what factors determine the choice of negative marker in existential <b>predications.</b> The results of this study show that there is a strong preference to negate existential <b>predications</b> with a negative indefinite pronoun. Further, it is shown that the negative indefinite pronoun is frequently used as a modifier to the pivot, and thus states an unconditional absence. ...|$|R
40|$|Biomedical {{knowledge}} {{claims are}} often expressed as hypotheses, speculations, or opinions, rather than explicit facts (propositions). Much biomedical text mining {{has focused on}} extracting propositions from biomedical literature. One such system is SemRep, which extracts propositional content {{in the form of}} subject-predicate-object triples called <b>predications.</b> In this study, we investigated the feasibility of assessing the factuality level of SemRep <b>predications</b> to provide more nuanced distinctions between <b>predications</b> for downstream applications. We annotated semantic <b>predications</b> extracted from 500 PubMed abstracts with seven factuality values (fact, probable, possible, doubtful, counterfact, uncommitted, and conditional). We extended a rule-based, compositional approach that uses lexical and syntactic information to predict factuality levels. We compared this approach to a supervised machine learning method that uses a rich feature set based on the annotated corpus. Our results indicate that the compositional approach is more effective than the machine learning method in recognizing the factuality values of <b>predications.</b> The annotated corpus as well as the source code and binaries for factuality assignment are publicly available. We will also incorporate the results of the better performing compositional approach into SemMedDB, a PubMed-scale repository of semantic <b>predications</b> extracted using SemRep...|$|R

25|$|Almost every ARM {{instruction}} has a conditional execution feature called <b>predication,</b> {{which is}} implemented with a 4-bit condition code selector (the predicate).

25|$|In such a scenario, Jains {{argue that}} the {{material}} cause of a living soul with cetana (conscious entity) is always the soul itself and cause of dead inert matter (non-cetana i.e. without any consciousness) is always the matter itself. If God is indeed the creator, then this is an impossible <b>predication</b> as the same cause {{will be responsible for}} two contradictory effects of cetana (life) and acetana (matter).

25|$|Some {{years later}} (in 1490), the ruined church was {{repaired}} and {{converted into a}} mosque. A minaret was erected between 1566 and 1574, under Selim II, by Hassam Pasha, a supplier of the Ottoman navy. Afterwards the mosque was often named after him. Between 1573 and 1578, during his sojourn in Istanbul, the German preacher Stephan Gerlach visited the mosque, identifying it with the church of Hagia Theodosia. During that century the mosque saw the <b>predication</b> of the local holy man Gül Baba, which was allegedly buried in the building. It {{is also possible that}} the mosque was named after him.|$|E
25|$|MIPS IV added several {{features}} to improve instruction-level parallelism. To alleviate the bottleneck {{caused by a}} single condition bit, seven condition code bits {{were added to the}} floating-point control and status register, bringing the total to eight. FP comparison and branch instructions were redefined so they could specify which condition bit was written or read (respectively); and the delay slot in between an FP branch that read the condition bit written to by a prior FP comparison was removed. Support for partial <b>predication</b> was added in the form of conditional move instructions for both GPRs and FPRs; and an implementation could choose between having precise or imprecise exceptions for IEEE 754 traps.|$|E

500|$|According to Charitrapragya, in Jain context syadvada {{does not}} mean a {{doctrine}} of doubt or skepticism, rather it means [...] "multiplicity or multiple possibilities". Syat in Jainism connotes something different from what the term means in Buddhism and Hinduism. In Jainism, it does not connote an answer that is [...] "neither yes nor no", but it connotes a [...] "many sidedness" [...] to any proposition with a seven fold <b>predication.</b>|$|E
500|$|The Anekantavada {{premises}} of the Jains is ancient, {{as evidenced by}} its mention in Buddhist texts such as the Samaññaphala Sutta. The Jain Agamas suggest that Mahavira's approach to answering all metaphysical philosophical questions was a [...] "qualified yes" [...] (syāt). These texts identify Anekantavada doctrine {{to be one of}} the key differences between the teachings of the Mahavira and those of the Buddha. The Buddha taught the Middle Way, rejecting extremes of the answer [...] "it is" [...] or [...] "it is not" [...] to metaphysical questions. The Mahavira, in contrast, taught his followers to accept both [...] "it is" [...] and [...] "it is not", with [...] "perhaps" [...] qualification and with reconciliation to understand the Absolute Reality. Syādvāda (<b>predication</b> logic) and Nayavāda (perspective epistemology) of Jainism expand on the concept of anekāntavāda. Syādvāda recommends the expression of anekānta by prefixing the epithet syād to every phrase or expression describing the nature of existence.|$|E
500|$|Syādvāda (...) is {{the theory}} of {{conditioned}} <b>predication,</b> {{the first part of}} which is derived from the Sanskrit word syāt (...) , which is the third person singular of the optative tense of the Sanskrit verb as (...) , 'to be', and which becomes syād when followed by a vowel or a voiced consonant, in accordance with sandhi. The optative tense in Sanskrit (formerly known as the 'potential') has the same meaning as the present tense of the subjunctive mood in most Indo-European languages, including Hindi, Latin, Russian, French, etc. [...] It is used when there is uncertainty in a statement; not 'it is', but 'it may be', 'one might', etc. [...] The subjunctive is very commonly used in Hindi, for example, in 'kya kahun?', 'what to say?'. [...] The subjunctive is also commonly used in conditional constructions; for example, one of the few English locutions in the subjunctive which remains more or less current is 'were it ०, then ०', or, more commonly, 'if it were..', where 'were' is in the past tense of the subjunctive.|$|E

40|$|Document {{retrieval}} {{has been}} an important research problem over many years in the information retrieval community. State-of-the-art techniques utilize various methods in matching documents to a given document including keywords, phrases, and annotations.

We represent documents as sets of <b>predications.</b> We measure the similarity between <b>predications</b> to compute the similarity between documents. Our approach utilizes the hierarchical information available in ontologies in computing concept-concept similarity, making the approach flexible. Predication-based document similarity is more precise and forms the basis for a semantically aware document retrieval system. We show that the approach is competitive with an existing state-of-the-art related document retrieval technique in the biomedical domain...|$|R
500|$|Anekantavada is the {{principle}} of relativity of truth or the doctrine of multiple aspects. Jains hold that truth is multifaceted and has multiple sides that cannot be completely comprehended by anyone. Anekantavada describes {{the world as a}} multifaceted, ever-changing reality with an infinity of viewpoints relative to the time, place, nature and state of one who is the viewer and that which is viewed. What is true from one point of view is open to question from another. Absolute truth cannot be grasped from any particular viewpoint alone, because absolute truth is the sum total of all different viewpoints that make up the universe. Because it is rooted in these doctrines, Jainism cannot exclusively uphold the views of any individual, community, nation, or species. [...] It recognises inherently that other views are valid for other peoples, and for other life-forms. [...] This perception leads to the doctrine of syadvada or sevenfold <b>predication</b> stating the truth from different viewpoints. Anekantvada is the doctrine and Syadvada is its expression. [...] According to Jaina philosophers all important philosophical statements should be expressed in this sevenfold way in order to remove the danger of dogmatism (ekanta) in philosophy.|$|E
