5|$|Since 5 May 1995, Norwegian law has {{required}} all Norwegian activity in Antarctica, including <b>Peter</b> <b>I</b> Island, to follow international environmental law for Antarctica. All Norwegian citizens who plan activities on <b>Peter</b> <b>I</b> Island must therefore {{report to the}} Norwegian Polar Institute, who may deny any non-conforming activity. All people visiting the island must follow laws regarding protection of nature, treatment of waste, pollution and insurance for search and rescue operations.|$|E
5|$|<b>Peter</b> <b>I</b> Island {{is one of}} Norway's two {{territorial}} {{claims in}} Antarctica, the other being Queen Maud Land. <b>Peter</b> <b>I</b> Island is the only claim within 90°W and 150°W and is also the only claim {{which is not a}} sector. Being south of 60°S, the island is subject to the Antarctic Treaty. The treaty ensures free access to the island for any scientific investigation, and states that it can only be used for peaceful purposes. Norway, Australia, France, New Zealand and the United Kingdom have all mutually recognized each other's claims in Antarctica.|$|E
5|$|He was {{succeeded by}} his son <b>Peter</b> <b>I,</b> with George Sursubul, the new emperor's {{maternal}} uncle, initially acting as a regent. As part of the peace treaty signed in October 927 and reinforced by Peter's marriage to Maria (Eirene), Romanos' granddaughter, the existing borders were confirmed, as were the Bulgarian ruler's imperial dignity {{and the head of}} the Bulgarian Church's patriarchal status.|$|E

5|$|In the 17th century, {{the castle}} {{was no longer}} used as a {{defensive}} building by the Swedes who now ruled the Swedish Estonian Province. In {{the course of the}} Great Northern War in 1710, Estonia fell under Russian rule and the walls were partially demolished at the command of the <b>Peter</b> <b>I</b> of Russia, turning the castle in effect into ruins.|$|E
5|$|The {{succession}} to the throne, {{similarly to}} Wallachia, was {{governed by the}} hereditary-elective principle. Thus either a legitimate or an illegitimate member of the Muşatin family could be proclaimed prince by an assembly of the boyars. In 1387 <b>Peter</b> <b>I</b> Muşat recognized Władysław II Jagiełło of Poland as his suzerain, but Hungary also maintained its claim of suzerainty over the principality.|$|E
5|$|According to some sources, Serbian king <b>Peter</b> <b>I</b> wanted Tatiana as a bride for {{his younger}} son, Prince Alexander. In January 1914, the Serbian prime {{minister}} Nikola Pašić delivered {{a letter to}} Tsar Nicholas in which King Peter expressed a desire for his son to marry one of the Grand Duchesses. Nicholas replied that he would allow his daughters to decide whom to marry, but {{he noticed that the}} Serbian prince Alexander often gazed upon Tatiana during a family dinner. Marriage negotiations ended due to the outbreak of World War I. Tatiana exchanged letters with Alexander during World War I and Alexander was distraught when he learned of her death.|$|E

5|$|After having {{received}} this information while at Rawicz, Charles struck camp on August 8 and marched closer to Warsaw {{in order to}} fully protect the city until the coronation of Leszczyński was completed. He left General Carl Gustaf Rehnskiöld with 10,000 men at Poznań to guard against the main Saxon army under Schulenburg which threatened to enter Poland. On September 15, <b>Peter</b> <b>I</b> seized the town of Mitau in Courland. However, the allied successes were limited as the coronation of Leszczyński as Stanisław I of Poland was completed on October 4.|$|E
5|$|In 1700 Sweden was {{attacked}} {{by a coalition of}} Saxony, Russia, and Denmark–Norway. Saxony, under Augustus II, invaded Swedish oversea dominions in Livonia and quickly attacked the city of Riga. Meanwhile, Frederick IV of Denmark attacked the Swedish allied duchies of Holstein and Gottorp in order to secure his rear, before commencing with the planned invasion of Scania, which had been previously annexed by Sweden in the Treaty of Roskilde in 1658. A short time later, Russia under <b>Peter</b> <b>I</b> swept into Swedish Ingria and besieged the strategic city of Narva. Unprepared for these developments, the Swedes were forced into a war on three fronts.|$|E
5|$|In 1702, Swedish forces {{invaded the}} Commonwealth {{as part of}} the Great Northern War, which had begun in 1700 between the Swedish Empire and the Tsardom of Russia. Augustus II, king of Poland and Elector of Saxony, was an ally of the Russian tsar <b>Peter</b> <b>I.</b> Augustus's forces were defeated, and the king himself was forced back to Saxony. He was {{replaced}} by Charles with Stanisław Leszczyński, a Polish nobleman and count of the Holy Roman Empire. Poniatowski, serving as a negotiator between the Wielkopolska Confederation and Charles XII, took the side of Leszczyński and distanced himself from the Sapiehas, formerly his patrons.|$|E
25|$|Despite this {{diplomatic}} {{success and}} the end of the 14-year-long conflict, the beginning of <b>Peter</b> <b>I's</b> reign was plagued by internal instability. The young monarch faced two consecutive revolts by his brothers Ivan and Michael. The Serbian prince Časlav took advantage <b>Peter</b> <b>I's</b> internal problems. In 928 or 931 he managed to escape from Preslav and to assert Serbia's independence from Bulgaria under Byzantine overlordship. With Byzantine financial and diplomatic support he managed to repopulate and reorganize the country.|$|R

5|$|In 1858, {{the rival}} Obrenović dynasty seized {{power in the}} country and forced Prince Alexander Karađorđević into exile. Ljotić's father was forced out of the country in 1868 after being implicated in a {{conspiracy}} against the Obrenović dynasty and its head, Prince Milan. He did not return to Serbia until Milan's abdication on 6 March 1889. Apart from being a close friend of Serbia's future king, <b>Peter</b> <b>I,</b> Ljotić's father was also the first person to translate The Communist Manifesto into Serbian. Ljotić's maternal great-grandfather, knez Stanoje, was an outlaw who was killed in the Slaughter of the Knezes in January 1804.|$|E
5|$|In Moldavia, {{agriculture}} and animal raising remained the principal economic activities. Similarly to Wallachia, wooden plow remained the main agricultural tool throughout the Middle Ages. The constant clearing of land shows that finding new land was still preferred to crop rotation. The {{establishment of the}} principality enhanced the security of travel, thus Moldavia could also profit from the transit trade between Poland and the Black Sea ports. The first local coins were minted in 1377, under <b>Peter</b> <b>I</b> Muşat (c.13751391).|$|E
5|$|Minor Crusading efforts lingered {{into the}} 14thcentury, and several Crusades were {{launched}} during the 14th and 15th centuries {{to counter the}} expansion of the Ottoman conquest of the Balkans. In 1309 as many as 30,000 peasants gathered from England, north-eastern France, and Germany proceeded as far as Avignon but disbanded there. <b>Peter</b> <b>I</b> of Cyprus captured and sacked Alexandria in 1365 in {{what became known as the}} Alexandrian Crusade; his motivation was as much commercial as religious. LouisII led the 1390 Barbary Crusade against Muslim pirates in North Africa; after a ten-week siege, the Crusaders signed a ten-year truce.|$|E

5|$|Norwegian Hjalmar Riiser-Larsen was {{the first}} person known to have set foot in the {{territory}}, in 1930. On 14 January 1939, the territory was claimed by Norway. From 1939 until 1945, Nazi Germany claimed New Swabia, which consisted of part of Queen Maud Land. On 23 June 1961, Queen Maud Land became part of the Antarctic Treaty System, making it a demilitarised zone. It is one of two Antarctic claims made by Norway, the other being <b>Peter</b> <b>I</b> Island. They are administrated by the Polar Affairs Department of the Norwegian Ministry of Justice and Public Security in Oslo.|$|E
5|$|The Saxon–Russian {{plans were}} put into action in early July as Sheremetyev began his march towards Lewenhaupt in Courland. The two armies met on July 26, {{at the battle of}} Gemauerthof where the Russians were defeated. Despite the outcome Lewenhaupt chose to {{withdraw}} back to Riga having suffered notable losses himself, leaving Courland open for <b>Peter</b> <b>I</b> to occupy with freshly arrived reinforcements. This worked in favor of the allies as the rear of Ogilvy's army which was marching towards Grodno was now secured accordingly.|$|E
5|$|The next landing {{occurred}} on 10 February 1948 by Larsen's ship Brategg. Biological, geological and hydrographic surveys underwent for three days, before the pack ice forced the expedition to leave. The expedition built a hut {{and placed a}} copy of the document of occupation from 1929 inside. On 23 June 1961, <b>Peter</b> <b>I</b> Island became subject to the Antarctic Treaty, after Norway's signing of the treaty in 1959. Since then, there have been several landings on the island by various nations for scientific investigations, as well as a limited number of ships that have successfully landed tourists on the island.|$|E

5|$|Despite their {{significant}} military advantage {{the allied}} armies encountered immediate setbacks. Denmark–Norway was quickly {{knocked out of}} the war by a bold Swedish landing on Humlebæk resulting in the Peace of Travendal. After this development, the Swedish army under Charles XII was free to sail east across the Baltic sea to tackle the remaining opponents, Russia and Saxony. In response to this threat, Augustus lifted the siege of Riga and marched back across the Düna river in order to observe the Swedish movements. Charles then decided to march against <b>Peter</b> <b>I</b> of Russia, who was besieging Narva, with the aim of saving the city. Shortly later the two armies met in the battle of Narva. This ended in a decisive Swedish victory which greatly crippled the Russian army, forcing them to abandon their campaign in Swedish territory and withdraw to Russia.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, the Bulgarian envoys {{received}} {{a warm welcome}} by al-Mahdi. The Fatimid caliph accepted the Bulgarian terms and sent his own emissaries to Simeon I. However, {{on the way back}} their ship was captured by the Byzantines, who managed to outbid the Bulgarians and distract a Fatimid attack. The Bulgarians remained in control of most of the Balkans, annexing Byzantium's ally Serbia in 924, but without naval support were unable to launch a decisive attack on Constantinople. The war continued until the death of Simeon I in 927, when his son <b>Peter</b> <b>I</b> (r. 927–969) concluded a peace treaty with the Byzantines, who recognized the imperial title of the Bulgarian monarchs and the complete independence of the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as an autocephalous Patriarchate in return for most of Simeon I's conquests in Thrace after 917.|$|E
5|$|It {{was a clear}} {{declaration}} of war, but Nikephoros' forces were largely preoccupied in the East. Thus the emperor turned to the traditional Byzantine expedient of turning one of the peoples living further north, in modern-day Ukraine, against Bulgaria. He sent an ambassador, the patrikios Kalokyros, to Sviatoslav, ruler of the Rus' with whom the Byzantines had maintained close relations. Sviatoslav enthusiastically responded, and invaded Bulgaria in 967 or 968 in a devastating raid, before returning home to defend his capital against a Pecheneg attack. This forced the Bulgarian tsar, <b>Peter</b> <b>I,</b> to the negotiating table, agreeing to terms favourable to Byzantium. However, this brief sojourn also awakened in Sviatoslav the desire to conquer Bulgaria and establish his own realm there. He returned in force in July or August 969 and conquered the country within a few months.|$|E
