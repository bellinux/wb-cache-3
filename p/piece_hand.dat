50|$|The {{elephant}} and {{the hawk}} {{are introduced to}} {{the game in the}} following way: whenever the player moves a piece (king, queen, knight, bishop or rook) from its starting position (that hasn't already been moved), one of the <b>pieces</b> in <b>hand</b> may be placed immediately on the square just vacated. One cannot use the placing of an elephant or hawk to block check. If the player moves all his pieces from the first rank without placing one or both in <b>hand</b> <b>pieces,</b> he forfeits the right to do so. After castling, the player may put one of the <b>pieces</b> in <b>hand</b> on either the king's or the rook's square, but he may not place both <b>pieces</b> in <b>hand</b> in the same turn. Pawns may promote to a hawk or an elephant in this game (in addition to the normal chess pieces).|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The <b>piece</b> in <b>hand</b> (PH) is {{a general}} scheme which is {{applicable}} to any reasonable type of multivariate public key cryptosystems {{for the purpose of}} enhancing their security. In this paper, we propose a new class PH method called NLPHPV (NonLinear <b>Piece</b> in <b>Hand</b> Perturbation Vector) method. Although our NLPHPV uses similar perturbation vectors as is used for the previously known internal perturbation method, this new method can avoid redundant repetitions in decryption process. With properly chosen parameter sizes, NLPHPV achieves an observable gain in security from the original multivariate public key cryptosystem. We demonstrate these by both theoretical analyses and computer simulations against major known attacks and provides the concrete sizes of security parameters, with which we even expect the grater security against potential quantum attacks.

50|$|Captured {{pieces are}} {{retained}} {{in hand and}} can be brought back into play under the capturing player's control. The Japanese term for <b>piece(s)</b> in <b>hand</b> is either 持ち駒 mochigoma or 手駒 tegoma. On any turn, instead of moving a piece on the board, a player may select a <b>piece</b> in <b>hand</b> and place it - unpromoted side up and facing the opposing side - on any empty square. The piece is then one of that player's active pieces {{on the board and}} can be moved accordingly. This is called dropping the piece, or simply, a drop. A drop counts as a complete move.|$|R
30|$|Before {{disconnecting}} the <b>hand</b> <b>piece</b> {{from the}} unit of phacoemulsification machine, the <b>hand</b> <b>piece’s</b> ports, tips, and tubing should be flushed. By flushing the <b>hand</b> <b>piece,</b> we can prevent build-up of material (which is difficult to remove) by cleaning inside the <b>hand</b> <b>piece,</b> thus preventing its occlusion. If the tips of <b>hand</b> <b>pieces</b> become occluded, several centers consider that a potential cause of toxic anterior segment syndrome (TASS) (Swaddiwudhipong et al. 1995). Many bacterial species including Pseudomonas species {{have the ability to}} form biofilms in different environments as a defense against predation. A biofilm comprises microorganisms multicellular communities in which cells stick to each other and also to a surface. These cells are embedded in an extracellular slimy matrix. The biofilm bacteria are sheltered from harmful factors in the environment, such as antibiotics, and a host body’s immune system. Biofilms may form on living or non-living surfaces, such as implants and tubing. Biofilm formation is an obstacle concerning the uses and design of ocular devices, such as contact lenses, conjunctival plugs, intraocular lenses, scleral buckles, lacrimal intubation devices, phacoemulsifier internal tubing, and orbital implants (Bispo et al. 2015).|$|R
