40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} work was to acquire and classify different <b>colour</b> <b>scales</b> resulted by serial dilutions of a specific colour. Through the serial dilutions, different <b>colour</b> <b>scales</b> were obtained and analyzed for a dialysis purpose. Visible (VIS) light spectrometer was proposed to measure the colour absorption through the integration with Spectrasuite software which respects to absorption. Spectrasuite is able to display spectral patterns corresponding to the absorption. Each <b>colour</b> <b>scale</b> indicates a different concentration. Thus, spectrometer was proved to distinguish different <b>colour</b> <b>scales</b> and it must even overcome cross-sensitivity issue. The application was validated through a correlation {{with the use of}} International Commission on Illumination (CIE) spectral measurement system. Every <b>colour</b> <b>scale</b> was successfully classified by a standard colour code. Thus, the spectrometer is applicable for the colour measurement analysis by absorption method besides contributing benefits to various applications...|$|R
40|$|Original {{scientific}} paper Screening dot is {{the basic}} printing element to reproduce continuous image and to form the printing image. Printing quality depends on the transfer quality of the screening dot. It is important to control the dot gain, sharpening, deformation, doubling and slur. In practice, some specific quality control techniques are used to monitor the screening dot variation. For dot gain control technique, multi-colour scales are often used to investigate dot gain or tone change. This article aims to investigate the secondary colour dot gain in electrostatic digital printing, by considering dot gain of the <b>colour</b> <b>scales,</b> Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, Blue, Red and Green. The relations between secondary colour dot gain and primary colour dot gain are studied. Three primary <b>colour</b> <b>scales,</b> Cyan, Magenta, Yellow, and three secondary <b>colour</b> <b>scales,</b> Blue, Red and Green, are designed from 2 % to 90 %. The <b>colour</b> <b>scales</b> are output by electrostatic colour press and measured by spectrophotometer. The dot gain of the secondary <b>colour</b> <b>scales</b> is modelled according to the dot gain rules of the primary <b>colour</b> <b>scales</b> using multiple linear regression method. The results illustrate that the dot gain of secondary colour changes with the dot gain o...|$|R

This article is focused on the perception of <b>colour</b> <b>scales</b> in relation to character of data. For experiment, a new questionnaire was created on the basis of <b>colour</b> <b>scales</b> classification. This questionnaire was posed to the students of years 1 and 2 of high school in order to find out how they perceive the <b>colour</b> <b>scales.</b> The study analyzes three main questions; whether students differentiate qualitative and quantitative datasets and corresponding <b>colour</b> <b>scales,</b> whether they prefer representing of features by context colours or by the colour they like more and whether they are familiar with principles of diverging <b>colour</b> <b>scales.</b> When processing it, the correlation between certain agents and the answers was established...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{evaluate}} the Haemoglobin <b>Colour</b> <b>Scale</b> developed by WHO for estimating haemoglobin concentration and {{to compare the}} results obtained using it and the HemoCue assay with those determined using a reference method, the Technicon H 3 analyser. METHODS: The <b>Colour</b> <b>Scale</b> and HemoCue assay were used to test 408 blood samples. Subsequently, Bland-Altman plots were determined and {{the proximity of the}} test results to those obtained using the reference method was determined. FINDINGS: The mean difference between the Haemoglobin <b>Colour</b> <b>Scale</b> and the reference method was 0. 19 g/dl (95 % confidence interval: 3. 50 g/dl below to 3. 11 g/dl above); the corresponding value for the HemoCue assay was 0. 50 g/dl (1. 16 g/dl below to 0. 16 g/dl above). Only 46. 08 % of the results obtained by means of the <b>Colour</b> <b>Scale</b> were within 1. 0 g/dl of the reference method, whereas 95. 34 % of the HemoCue results fell within this limit; 22. 79 % of the <b>Colour</b> <b>Scale</b> results but none of the HemoCue results lay more than 2. 0 g/dl from the reference method. CONCLUSION: The Haemoglobin <b>Colour</b> <b>Scale</b> test is too inaccurate for general use, particularly if devices such as the HemoCue are available...|$|R
40|$|Anaemia in {{pregnancy}} {{is a common}} and severe problem in many developing countries. Because of lack of resources and staff motivation, screening for anaemia is often solely by clinical examination of the conjunctiva or is not carried out at all. A new <b>colour</b> <b>scale</b> for the estimation of haemoglobin concentration has been developed by WHO. The present study compares the results obtained using the new <b>colour</b> <b>scale</b> on 729 women visiting rural antenatal clinics in Malawi with those obtained by HemoCue haemoglobinometer and electronic Coulter Counter and with the assessment of anaemia by clinical examination of the conjunctiva. Sensitivity using the <b>colour</b> <b>scale</b> was consistently better than for conjunctival inspection alone and interobserver agreement and agreement with Coulter Counter measurements was good. The Haemoglobin <b>Colour</b> <b>Scale</b> is simple to use, well accepted, cheap and gives immediate results.

40|$|The pectoralis profundus {{muscles of}} 200 {{selected}} beef carcasses were measured {{to develop a}} standard <b>colour</b> <b>scale</b> for evaluating beef carcasses {{at the time of}} classification (approximately 60 min post mortem). Five lightness (L*) values were chosen ranging from 22 to 42 with intervals of five L* units. Corresponding a* and b* values were calculated. Based on regressions between the actual reflection spectra and the L*, a* and b* values, spectra of the five chosen colours for the <b>colour</b> <b>scale</b> were predicted. The L*, a* and b* values accurately predicted the reflection spectra. A paint company imitated the five reflection spectra. Spectra could not be matched exactly, without metamerism occuring. Therefore, the <b>colour</b> <b>scale</b> should be used with specific light sources.

40|$|Before {{introducing}} a new measurement tool {{it is necessary}} to evaluate its performance. Several statistical methods have been developed, or used, to evaluate {{the reliability and validity of}} a new assessment method in such circumstances. In this paper we review some commonly used methods. Data from a study that was conducted to evaluate the usefulness of a specific measurement tool (the WHO <b>Colour</b> <b>Scale)</b> is then used to illustrate the application of these methods. The WHO <b>Colour</b> <b>Scale</b> was developed under the auspices of the WHO to provide a simple portable and reliable method of detecting anaemia. This <b>Colour</b> <b>Scale</b> is a discrete interval scale, whereas the actual haemoglobin values it is used to estimate are on a continuous interval scale and can be measured accurately using electrical laboratory equipment. The methods we consider are: linear regression, correlation coefficients, paired t-tests plotting differences against mean values and deriving limits of agreement; kappa and weighted kappa statistics, sensitivity and specificity, an intraclass correlation coefficient and the repeatability coefficient. We note that although the definition and properties of each of these methods is well established inappropriate methods continue to be used in medical literature for assessing reliability and validity, as evidenced in the context of the evaluation of the WHO <b>Colour</b> <b>Scale.</b> Copyright (C) 2004 John Wiley Sons, Ltd...|$|R
40|$|AIM: To {{describe}} a new inexpensive method (the WHO <b>Colour</b> <b>Scale)</b> for estimating haemoglobin concentration from {{a drop of}} blood by means of a <b>colour</b> <b>scale,</b> and to compare its reliability with a standard laboratory method of measuring haemoglobin, and its clinical usefulness in field trials. METHODS: The new <b>colour</b> <b>scale</b> method was used to measure haemoglobin concentration in 1213 random venous blood samples from routine work in four laboratories (one each in the UK, South Africa, Thailand, and Switzerland). Limited field trials of the method for assessing clinical usefulness were done in a rural hospital (in South Africa) staffed by nurses, at two blood donor sessions (one each in South Africa and Thailand), and by nonlaboratory personnel in malaria clinics (in Thailand), following training and a short practice session. RESULTS: In the laboratory based comparability study the presence of anaemia was reliably detected using the new method with 91 % sensitivity and 86 % specificity. Clinically relevant levels of anaemia (mild to moderate, pronounced, and severe) were graded and serious anaemia (< 8 g/dl) was identified with an efficiency of 89 %. The clinical trials showed the ease and reliability with which the <b>colour</b> <b>scale</b> could be used by non-laboratory persons after brief training. The blood donor trials showed it to be at least as reliable as the copper sulphate method with the advantage of being more convenient. CONCLUSIONS: The preliminary {{studies have shown that the}} WHO <b>Colour</b> <b>Scale</b> is a reliable screening method for detecting anaemia, especially for diagnosing serious anaemia. Following a brief training session health workers found it simple to use and, at a cost of about 1 / 10 th that for traditional photometric analysis, it should be of value in "countries in need" for primary health centres, obstetrical management, paediatric clinics, tropical disease control programmes, blood transfusion donor selection, as well as for industrial health checks and epidemiological studies...|$|R

40|$|Abstract — Spatializations {{represent}} non-spatial data using {{a spatial}} layout {{similar to a}} map. We present an experiment comparing different visual representations of spatialized data, to determine which representations are best for a non-trivial search and point estimation task. Primarily, we compare point-based displays to 2 D and 3 D information landscapes. We also compare a <b>colour</b> (hue) <b>scale</b> to a grey (lightness) scale. For the task we studied, point-based spatializations were far superior to landscapes, and 2 D landscapes were superior to 3 D landscapes. Little or no benefit was found for redundantly encoding data using colour or greyscale combined with landscape height. 3 D landscapes with no <b>colour</b> <b>scale</b> (height-only) were particularly slow and inaccurate. A <b>colour</b> <b>scale</b> {{was found to be}} better than a greyscale for all display types, but a greyscale was helpful compared to height-only. These results suggest that point-based spatializations should be chosen over landscape representations, at least for tasks involving only point data itself rather than derived information about the data space...|$|R
