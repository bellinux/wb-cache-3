25|$|On February 28, 1935, Gerard Berchet, {{under the}} {{direction}} of Carothers, produced a half-ounce of polymer from hexamethylenediamine and adipic acid, creating <b>polyamide</b> 6-6, the substance that would {{come to be known as}} Nylon. It was difficult to work with because of its high melting point, but Bolton chose this <b>polyamide</b> as the one to develop commercially. He selected Dr. George Graves to work with Carothers on the project. Eventually Graves supplanted Carothers as the leader of the <b>polyamide</b> project. In addition, dozens of chemists and engineers worked on refining <b>polyamide</b> 6-6 into a viable commercial product.|$|E

40|$|Pyrrole-imidazole <b>polyamides</b> bind DNA with affinities {{comparable}} to those of transcriptional regulatory proteins and inhibit the DNA binding activities of components of the transcription apparatus. If <b>polyamides</b> are to be useful for the regulation of gene expression in cell culture experiments, one pivotal issue is accessibility of specific sites in nuclear chromatin. We first determined the kinetics of uptake and subcellular distribution of <b>polyamides</b> in lymphoid and myeloid cells using fluorescent polyamide-bodipy conjugates and deconvolution microscopy. Then cells were incubated with a polyamide-chlorambucil conjugate, and the sites of specific DNA cleavage in the nuclear chromatin were assayed by ligation-mediated PCR. In addition, DNA microarray analysis revealed that two different <b>polyamides</b> generated distinct transcription profiles. Remarkably, the <b>polyamides</b> affected {{only a limited number of}} genes...|$|R

Six <b>polyamides</b> containing three to eight rings bind DNA sites 5 - 10 bp in length, respectively. Quantitative DNase I footprint titration experiments demonstrate that affinity maximizes and is similar at ring sizes of five, six, and seven.

25|$|In 1934, Carothers {{turned his}} {{attention}} to fibers again. Now the team substituted diamines for glycols to produce a type of polymer called a <b>polyamide.</b> These substances were much more stable than the polyesters formed by using the glycols. The ability of polyamides to form crystalline domains through hydrogen bonding gives them increased mechanical properties. Therefore, they might produce a synthetic silk that would be practical for everyday use. His research resulted in the invention of a number of new polyamides. The lab work for this project was conducted by Dr. W. R. Peterson and Dr. Donald Coffman. In 1935 Dr. Gerard Berchet was assigned to this <b>polyamide</b> research.|$|E
25|$|The {{plastics}} {{industry was}} revolutionized in the 1930s with {{the announcement of}} <b>polyamide</b> (PA), far better known by its trade name nylon. Nylon was the first purely synthetic fiber, introduced by DuPont Corporation at the 1939 World's Fair in New York City.|$|E
25|$|Nylon 12 has a {{broad range}} of {{applications}} as <b>polyamide</b> additives.

30|$|<b>Polyamides,</b> {{the most}} {{versatile}} class of engineering polymers, display {{a wide range of}} properties. Aliphatic <b>polyamides</b> (nylons) find many industrial and textile applications due to their high mechanical strength and durability. Many studies on nylon-based clay nanocomposites have been reported previously [15 – 20]. Aromatic <b>polyamides</b> (aramids) are being used in industry because of their outstanding properties. However, poor solubility in common organic solvents and high melting temperatures are the limiting factors for the processing of these materials. A lot of {{attempts have been made to}} solubilize these polymers in order to prepare their composites using different techniques [21 – 25]. Aliphatic–aromatic <b>polyamides</b> (glass clear nylons) offer a wide range of properties including transparency, thermal stability, good barrier, and solvent resistant properties. These commercial <b>polyamides</b> have been reinforced with various ceramic phases [26 – 29]. There are numerous references to <b>polyamides</b> from aliphatic diamines and aromatic diacids and a far lesser number to <b>polyamides</b> from aromatic diamines and aliphatic diacids [30 – 38]. Probably the reason that aliphatic–aromatic <b>polyamides</b> have been studied in greater detail than the aromatic–aliphatic is that many of the former group can be made by melt and plasticized melt methods [32, 33, 39] or by standard interfacial procedures [35, 37, 40]. The aromatic–aliphatic <b>polyamides,</b> on the other hand are difficult to prepare by interfacial and solution methods [30, 41] and when prepared by melt methods, frequently are discolored and may have branched or network structures. Recently, excellent nanocomposites obtained from pectin–ZnO and ethylene vinylacetate–carbon nanofiber have been reported [42, 43]. Metal nanoparticle embedded conducting polymer–polyoxometalate composites and ionic liquid assisted polyaniline–gold nanocomposites for biocatalytic application have also been investigated [44, 45].|$|R
40|$|DNA is nature’s blueprint, holding {{within it}} {{the genetic code}} that defines the {{structure}} and function of an organism. A complex network of DNA-binding proteins called transcription factors can largely control {{the flow of information}} from DNA, so modulating the function of transcription factors is a promising approach for treating many diseases. Pyrrole-imidazole (Py-Im) <b>polyamides</b> are a class of DNA-binding oligomers, which can be synthetically programmed to bind a target sequence of DNA. Due to their unique shape complementarity and a series of favorable hydrogen bonding interactions that occur upon DNA-binding, Py-Im <b>polyamides</b> can bind to the minor groove of DNA with affinities comparable to transcription factors. Previous studies have demonstrated that these cell-permeable small molecules can enter cell nuclei and disrupt the transcription factor-DNA interface, thereby repressing transcription. As the use of Py-Im <b>polyamides</b> has significant potential as a type of modular therapeutic platform, the need for <b>polyamides</b> with extremely favorable biological properties and high potency will be essential. Described herein, a variety of studies have been performed aimed at improving the biological activity of Py-Im <b>polyamides.</b> To improve the biological potency and cellular uptake of these compounds, we have developed a next-generation class of <b>polyamides</b> bearing aryl-turn moieties, a simple structural modification that allows significant improvements in cellular uptake. This strategy was also applied to a panel of high-affinity cyclic Py-Im <b>polyamides,</b> again demonstrating the remarkable effect minor structural changes can have on biological activity. The solubility properties of Py-Im <b>polyamides</b> and use of formulating reagents with their treatment have also been examined.

25|$|Red {{phosphorus}} {{can be used}} as a {{very effective}} flame retardant, especially in thermoplastics (e.g. <b>polyamide)</b> and thermosets (e.g. epoxy resins or polyurethanes). The flame retarding effect is based on the formation of polyphosphoric acid. Together with the organic polymer material, this acid creates a char which prevents the propagation of the flames. The safety risks associated with phosphine generation and friction sensitivity of red phosphorus can be effectively reduced by stabilization and micro-encapsulation. For easier handling, red phosphorus is often used in form of dispersions or masterbatches in various carrier systems.|$|E

Shapes that are hard or impossible to create by hand can often be realized by 3D printing. Popular materials to print include <b>Polyamide,</b> steel and wax (latter for further processing).

The primary reason for considering new film materials for capacitors is the relative low permittivity of commonly used materials. With a higher permittivity, film capacitors could be made even smaller, an advantage in the market for more-compact portable electronic devices.|$|E

40|$|Regulation of the {{processing}} of genes into nucleic acids and proteins is a substantial goal in medicine. Small molecules that could enter cells, localize to the nucleus, and bind chromosomal DNA sequence-specifically and with high affinity would be important tools for gene regulation. Pyrrole-imidazole <b>polyamides</b> are small molecules that bind the minor groove of DNA in a sequence-specific fashion according {{to a set of}} pairing rules, and with affinities rivaling natural transcription factors. Several in vitro experiments have shown that by directly competing with transcription factors for binding sites in gene promoter regions, <b>polyamides</b> can act to inhibit transcription of those genes. <b>Polyamides</b> bearing transcription activation domains can bind to promoter regions, recruit the transcriptional machinery to the gene, and activate transcription in vitro. Attempts to reproduce these results in vivo were largely unsuccessful, perhaps due to poor cellular trafficking properties of <b>polyamides</b> and polyamide-peptide conjugates. It was found that <b>polyamides</b> bearing the Bodipy fluorophore localize primarily to the cytoplasm of cells, or were excluded from cells altogether. In attempts to overcome this quality, peptides shown to improve cellular trafficking were appended to the <b>polyamides.</b> These peptides were generally not successful at inducing uptake, and were in many cases toxic to the cells. Small molecules were also appended to <b>polyamides,</b> likewise to improve uptake properties, but met with limited success. Surprisingly, the addition of a fluorescein or fluorescein-like fluorophore to <b>polyamides</b> permit them to localize to the nuclei of all cell lines tested, in a molecular content- and shape-dependent manner.
