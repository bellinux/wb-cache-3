60|$|Mrs. Martha Garland, as {{a respectable}} widow, {{occupied}} a twilight rank between the benighted villagers and the well-informed gentry, and kindly made herself {{useful to the}} former as letter-writer and reader, and general translator from the <b>printing</b> <b>tongue.</b> It was not without satisfaction that she stood at her door of an evening, newspaper in hand, {{with three or four}} cottagers standing round, and poured down their open throats any paragraph that she might choose to select from the stirring ones of the period. When she had done with the sheet Mrs. Garland passed it on to the miller, the miller to the grinder, and the grinder to the grinder's boy, in whose hands it became subdivided into half pages, quarter pages, and irregular triangles, and ended its career as a paper cap, a flagon bung, or a wrapper for his bread and cheese.|$|R
40|$|Biometrics are {{the unique}} {{characteristics}} of the individual that differentiate him or her from any other person. Down and Sands explained that the physiological characteristics refer to the inherited traits that are shaped in the early embryonic stages of the human development. Physical biometrics include, among other things, DNA, fingerprints, hand geometry, vein patterns, face structure, skin luminescence, palm prints, iris patterns, periocular features, retina patterns, ear shape, lip <b>prints,</b> heartbeats, <b>tongue</b> <b>prints,</b> and body odor/scent. Behavioral characteristics are not inherited but acquired and learned throughout {{the life of the}} individual. These include, but also are not limited to, signature, handwriting, vocal prints, keystroke dynamics, and gait–body motion. As a result, the biometrics of a person cannot be stolen, forgotten, or forged. It is what we are...|$|R
5000|$|Preserved in the {{isolated}} Blackmore Vale, {{use of the}} dialect began to decline from the mid-nineteenth century when it was exposed to other English variations. The arrival of the railways, around this time, brought an influx of tourists to Dorset, while land enclosure and {{the repeal of the}} Corn Laws, caused mass unemployment in the mainly rural county, forcing farmers to seek work {{in other parts of the}} country.Attempts to standardise English began as early as the 16th century and by the mid-nineteenth century had also had a profound affect on local dialects, particularly in the south-west. Dialect was actively discouraged in schools at this time and the introduction of compulsory education for young children hastened its decline. Thomas Hardy noted in 1883 that,"Having attended the National School they children would mix the <b>printed</b> <b>tongue</b> as taught therein with the unwritten, dying, Wessex English they had learnt of their parents, the result of this transitional state of affairs being a composite language without rule or harmony".|$|R
40|$|International audienceStatic palatography {{has been}} widely used to {{investigate}} consonant articulation. The method {{is based on the}} observation of the <b>tongue</b> <b>print</b> (a black paste is spread on the tongue before the production) either directly onto the palate (direct palatography) or onto a pseudo palate (indirect palatography). This study has two main objectives. The first one is to provide an automatic analysis of the <b>tongue</b> <b>print</b> characteristic (size, shape, position onto the palate, [...] .) in order to allow an objective description of the linguopalatal contact. The second one concerns the shape of the palate. Indeed, a simple picture (2 D) analysis {{does not take into account}} the shape (3 D) of the palate vault. To alleviate this 2 D limitation, we propose a method based on the use of structured light which enables the computation of the palate shape...|$|R

40|$|Biometrics {{authentication}} system promises {{to deliver a}} level of uniqueness to identification applications that uses <b>Tongue</b> <b>print,</b> fingerprint or facial scans and iris or voice recognition to identify users. The tongue is a unique organ in {{that it can be}} stuck out of mouth for inspection, in this act offering a proof of life, and yet it is otherwise well protected in the mouth and is difficult to forge. The tongue also presents both geometric shape information and physiological texture information which are potentially useful in identity verification applications. Tongue biometric can function as an extremely reliable means for personal identification and act as a general biometric in all applications. This paper demonstrates two phases. First, find out spots on the tongue with the help of histogram and second phase to extract image tongue and recognize from the tongue-image database...|$|R

He {{was ordained}} 1815 {{and moved to}} Kerala in 1816 where he founded a mission station in Kottayam, [...] and in 1821 {{established}} a printing press.

In the Hindu paper (May 29, 2016) Graham Shaw says:" [...] Exactly 300 years ago, on May 12, 1716, a small edition of an English schoolbook rolled off the press at Tharangambadi. This was Thomas Dyche’s A guide to the English <b>tongue,</b> <b>printed</b> {{for use in the}} charity school for poor Protestant children, established in Chennai in 1715 by East India Company’s chaplain, William Stevenson.

The study aimed to confirm {{of the presence of}} saliva crystallization in female Bornean orangutans (Pongo pygmaeus), to evaluate the quality of samples which were collected from animals and processed by keepers, and to test preliminarily if the saliva crystallization could be connected with menstrual cycle and could serve as a cheap, quick and simple method for the basic monitoring of their reproductive status. The research was carried out from September 2014 to January 2015. Sampling of saliva was done in three female orangutans from three zoological gardens (Dvur Kralove, Usti nad Labem, Bojnice) daily, mostly by <b>tongue</b> <b>prints</b> on glass slides with ground edges or by sampling directly from the mouth using plastic spoons from which the saliva was transferred onto glass slides. Samples were evaluated by light microscopy with × 400 magnification. The quality of the sample and type of crystallization was assessed for two different approaches. In total, 246 samples were evaluated. We confirmed the presence of saliva crystallization in orangutans. The quality of samples was variable however acceptable. Unfortunately, it was impossible to detect exact fertile period in two females. However in one orangutan female, when the crystallization was evaluated by the approach typically used in humans, we discovered that saliva crystallization during the fertile period significantly differed from saliva crystallization in the non-fertile period. This points out the possibility of using saliva crystallization for detection of the fertile period in orangutans. However, further research was recommended...|$|R
