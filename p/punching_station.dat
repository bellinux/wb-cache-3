5000|$|Cards with error notches were re-punched (using an 024 or 026) {{usually by}} [...] "duplicating" [...] {{up to the}} column in error, then {{entering}} the correct data. The duplicating function was accomplished by feeding the card through the punch station without punching it. At the next station sensing pins read the holes present in the original card and transferred the data to the <b>punching</b> <b>station</b> and onto a blank card. Columns with errors were corrected instead of being duplicated. The corrected card was then verified to check the data again and be [...] "OK notched".|$|E

5000|$|While the Bull punch {{was used}} with the UNIVAC Solid State 80 for 80 column cards the UNIVAC Solid State 90 used the Univac {{manufactured}} [...] "Tower Punch" [...] for 90 column cards. The Tower Punch operating at 150 cards per minute used mechanical pin sensing in the pre punch read and the post <b>punch</b> read <b>stations</b> giving {{the ability to read}} a card, punch additional information into the card, and check read the results in the post <b>punch</b> <b>station.</b>|$|R
50|$|Initial {{versions}} supported 40 program steps, {{and this}} was soon expanded to 60. Processing was still locked to the reader/punch cycle time, thus program execution had to complete within the time between a punched card leaving the read station and entering the <b>punch</b> <b>station.</b>|$|R

5000|$|Thanks to {{its use of}} {{electronic}} memory, the 129 {{did not have a}} separate [...] "read station" [...] with a pin-sense unit to enable duplication of data from one card to the next. Instead, duplication was based on the stored image of the previous card. Cards could also be [...] "read-in" [...] through an optical read unit integrated into the <b>punch</b> <b>station.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 533 could punch 100 cards {{per minute}} {{and had a}} set of read brushes {{downstream}} from the <b>punch</b> <b>station</b> {{that were used to}} verify proper punching. The card reader was similar to that on the IBM 402 accounting machine and could read 200 cards per minute. The 533 was controlled by a plugboard control panel, typical of IBM unit record equipment of the time. p. 19 ff ...|$|R
50|$|Assembler source {{starts with}} column 21 of the card, not column one. In systems without a disk drive, the {{assembler}} would punch code into {{the start of}} the card just read (the card reader was actually a reader-punch, with the <b>punch</b> <b>station</b> after the read station) and then read the next card. To handle forward branches and the like, the assembler's second pass literally involved a second pass of the cards through the reader/punch. If source changes were needed the programmer would duplicate the cards to obtain a deck with columns 1-20 blank ready for the next run through the assembler.|$|R
50|$|Wiring a {{unit record}} control panel {{required}} {{knowledge of the}} machine's components and their timing constraints. The components of most unit record machines were synchronized to a rotating shaft. One rotation represented a single machine cycle, during which punched cards would advance from one station to the next, a line might be printed, a total might be printed and so on. The cycles were divided into points according to when the rows on a punched card would appear under a read or <b>punch</b> <b>station.</b> On most machines, cards were fed face down, 9-edge (bottom edge) first. Thus the first point in a card cycle would 9-time, the second 8 time and so on to 0-time. The times from 9 to 0 were known as digits. These would be followed by 11 time and 12 time, also known as zones.|$|R
2500|$|Word {{processors}} are {{descended from}} the Friden Flexowriter, which had two <b>punched</b> tape <b>stations</b> and permitted switching {{from one to the}} other (thus enabling what was called the [...] "chain" [...] or [...] "form letter", one tape containing names and addresses, and the other the body of the letter to be sent). It did not wrap words, which was begun by IBM's Magnetic Tape Selectric Typewriter (later, Magnetic Card Selectric Typewriter).|$|R
5000|$|The {{card punch}} had a maximum rate of 150 cards per minute. Timing was quite {{critical}} throughout {{the operation of}} the card punch, the card reader and the printer, all being based on electromechanical principles. The basic card punch mechanism was manufactured by Bull, a French company which owned patents on 80 column punch card machines. The machine came in two versions, the P147 and the P67, the main difference being electromagnetic clutch or a solenoid operated mechanical [...] "dog" [...] clutch to initiate a punch cycle. Since many gears, electrical contact cams were affixed to the main shaft with taper pins, the P 67 with its severe stopping dog clutch would cause timing loss more frequently than the P 147. Most emergency maintenance time was spent replacing worn and damaged taper pins and retiming the machine. The card punch had a preread <b>station,</b> a <b>punch</b> <b>station</b> and a checkread station. The machine could be quite difficult to maintain and required much skill to troubleshoot and maintain. The machine cycle was oddly divided into 420 [...] "points" [...] or [...] "Bull degrees".|$|R

5000|$|A similar device, the 2770, {{announced}} in 1969, [...] "was said to surpass all other IBM terminals in {{the variety of}} available input-output devices." [...] The 2770 could attach the 2213 Printer, 2502 Card Reader, 545 Card <b>Punch,</b> 2265 Display <b>Station,</b> 1017 Paper Tape Reader, 1018 Paper Tape Punch, the 50 Magnetic Data Inscriber, and the 1255 Magnetic Character Reader. The printer and devices for any two other media could be attached to one 2772 Control Unit. [...] The 2770 {{was developed by the}} IBM General Products Division (GPD) in Rochester, MN. [...] An SNA successor, the 3770, a Data Processing Division (DPD) product, appeared in 1974.|$|R
5000|$|Gimarc {{continued}} innovation with Radio Sass (Short Attention Span System), a new {{protocol for}} music radio allowing a broadcaster {{to play up}} to twice as much music in an hour as was previously possible, by cutting out parts of the song, time-compressing the music and other electronic [...] "slice and dice" [...] techniques. Gimarc is so proud of this new form of [...] "radio formatics" [...] that he has successfully received a pair of U.S. Patents on the technique, the first to ever apply to a radio format. Gimarc promotes the method as [...] "groundbreaking in its approach to streamlining radio for modern listeners", despite the contention of his critics that what Gimarc calls [...] "streamlining" [...] is really [...] "butchering" [...] and [...] "dumbing down". At this time, there is great enthusiasm among corporate radio interests and conglomerates {{that this may be}} the future path for Top 40 and CHR formats. Gimarc was pleasantly surprised to find that listeners in research groups did not detect the edits, although very familiar with the music. He says that the shortening parallels what listeners already do by <b>punching</b> from <b>station</b> to station, a behavior even found with iPods and personal devices. This protocol is now in use under the name 'Quick Hitz." [...] http://quickhitz.com/ ...|$|R
25|$|In 1884, London {{hosted the}} International Health Exhibition. This {{exhibition}} placed {{much emphasis on}} highlighting Victorian developments in sanitation and public health, and allowed the nation to display its advanced public health outreach, compared to other countries at the time. Francis Galton took advantage of this opportunity to set up his anthropometric laboratory. He stated {{that the purpose of}} this laboratory was to “show the public the simplicity of the instruments and methods by which the chief physical characteristics of man may be measured and recorded.” The laboratory was an interactive walk-through in which physical characteristics such as height, weight, and eyesight, would be measured for each subject after payment of an admission fee. Upon entering the laboratory, a subject would visit the following stations in order. First, they would fill out a form with personal and family history (age, birthplace, marital status, residence, and occupation), then visit stations that recorded hair and eye color, followed by the keenness, color-sense, and depth perception of sight. Next, they would examine the keenness, or relative acuteness, of hearing and highest audible note of their hearing followed by an examination of their sense of touch. However, because the surrounding area was noisy, the apparatus intended to measure hearing was rendered ineffective by the noise and echoes in the building. Their breathing capacity would also be measured, as well as their ability to throw a <b>punch.</b> The next <b>stations</b> would examine strength of both pulling and squeezing with both hands. Lastly, subjects' heights in various positions (sitting, standing, etc.) as well as arm span and weight would be measured. One excluded characteristic of interest was the size of the head. Galton notes in his analysis that this omission was mostly for practical reasons. For instance, it would not be very accurate and additionally it would require much time for women to disassemble and reassemble their hair and bonnets. The patrons would then be given a souvenir containing all their biological data, while Galton would also keep a copy for future statistical research.|$|R
