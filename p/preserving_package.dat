50|$|The Dakin {{oxidation}} is {{most commonly}} used to synthesize benzenediols and alkoxyphenols. Catechol, for example, is synthesized from o-hydroxy and o-alkoxy phenyl aldehydes and ketones, and is used as the starting material for synthesis of several compounds, including the catecholamines, catecholamine derivatives, and 4-tert-butylcatechol, a common antioxidant and polymerization inhibitor. Other synthetically useful products of the Dakin oxidation include guaiacol, a precursor of several flavorants; hydroquinone, a common photograph-developing agent; and 2-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole and 3-tert-butyl-4-hydroxyanisole, two antioxidants commonly used to <b>preserve</b> <b>packaged</b> food.

40|$|In this work, {{adhesion}} between electrolessly deposited {{copper and}} dielectric materials {{for use in}} microelectronic devices is investigated. The microelectronics industry requires continuous advances due to ever-evolving technology and the corresponding need for higher density substrates with smaller features. At the same time, adhesion must be maintained in order to <b>preserve</b> <b>package</b> reliability and mechanical performance. In order to meet these requirements two approaches were taken: smoothing the surface of traditional epoxy dielectric materials while maintaining adhesion, and increasing adhesion on advanced dielectric materials through chemical bonding and mechanical anchoring. It was found that NH 3 plasma treatments can be effective for increasing both catalyst adsorption and adhesion {{across a range of}} materials. This adhesion is achieved through increased nitrogen content on the polymer surface, specifically N=C. This nitrogen interacts with the palladium catalyst particles to form chemical anchors between the polymer surface and the electroless copper layer without the need for roughness. Chemical bonding alone, however, did not enable sufficient adhesion but needed to be supplemented with mechanical anchoring. Traditional epoxy materials were treated with a swell and etch process to roughen the surface and create mechanical anchoring. This same process was found to be ineffective when used on advanced dielectric materials. In order to create controlled roughness on these surfaces a novel method was developed that utilized blends of traditional epoxy with the advanced materials. Finally, combined treatments of surface roughening followed by plasma treatments were utilized to create optimum interfaces between traditional or advanced dielectric materials and electroless copper. In these systems adhesion was measured over 0. 5 N/mm with root-mean-square surface roughness as low as 15 nm. In addition, the individual contributions of chemical bonding and mechanical anchoring were identified. The plasma treatment conditions used in these experiments contributed up to 0. 25 N/mm to adhesion through purely chemical bonding with minimal roughness generation. Mechanical anchoring accounted for the remainder of adhesion, 0. 2 - 0. 8 N/mm depending on the level of roughness created on the surface. Thus, optimized surfaces with very low surface roughness and adequate adhesion were achieved by sequential combination of roughness formation and chemical modifications. Ph. D.

40|$|From John Glenn's {{mission to}} orbit Earth to the International Space Station program, space food {{research}} has met {{the challenge of}} providing food that tastes good and travels well in space. Early food dehydration was achieved by cutting meat, fish, and certain fruits into thin strips and drying them in sunlight. Rubbing food with salt or,soaking it in salt water, an early form of curing food, also helped preserve it. Later techniques were developed for cooking, processing, preserving, and storing food in sealed containers. With the developments of pasteurization and canning, a much larger variety of foods could be stored and carried on long journeys.

To this aim POs usually support also new production techniques like “Integrated Pest Management” (IPM) and “Integrated Production” (IP) by offering technical assistance to farmers. The main objective of IP schemes is to reduce the use of pesticides and therefore to reduce costs and to increase the environmental sustainability. However, differently from the case of organic products, in the case of IP no EU regulation exists. The absence of this common standard has allowed regional authorities to introduce different definitions of IP. Moreover large retail chains often apply chain-specific requirements, based on the “idea” of IP and often also on regional IP scheme but always with quite important differences. The actual result is that farmers producing vegetables and fruits must often apply, for the same product grown on the same farm, different technologies in order to obtain different certifications all based on the IP scheme but with quite different interpretations. At the farm level, these different schemes imply a relevant increase in costs of production and commercialization, without generating any positive economic effect, on one side, and with a large degree of uncertainty in terms of impact on environmental sustainability of these production technologies. Starting from the case of fruit production in Emilia-Romagna region, this paper discusses these negative implications together with the possibility for large retail chains to exercise some oligopsony power with respect to POs also using IP schemes. Few implications are drawn with respect to the potential benefits of a common IP scheme defined by EU regulation, and about the main characteristics that this certification should have...|$|R
40|$|Streams in {{semiarid}} settings {{have undergone}} cycles of arroyo cutting and filling over the Holocene {{in response to}} climatic forcing. Many have specifically cited variability {{in the frequency of}} large floods as a causal factor. Reconstructions of the changing grade of these streams are usually based on alluvial records found in broad alluvial valleys. In contrast, paleoflood hydrologists reconstruct paleoflood records by studying deposits preserved in constricted bedrock canyons, typically assuming a constant stream grade over millennial timescales. These contrasting stream behaviors must be reconciled in order to test the hypothesis that paleofloods are associated with arroyo cutting and to determine what characteristics determine what type of alluvial record is preserved in a given stream reach. This OSL/radiocarbon-based chronostratigraphic investigation has the goal of linking these two alluvial record types in Buckskin Wash, a major tributary of the Paria River, south-central Utah, where a broad alluvial reach drains into a severely constricted slot canyon. We are testing the hypothesis that the same floods that cut arroyos in the alluvial reach are <b>preserved</b> as depositional <b>packages</b> in the constricted reach downstream. Geochronology is not yet complete, but it appears that the temporal relationship is not so simple. The most recent alluviation in the broad valleys of the plateau occurred between 1300 and 1880 AD. The bulk of the deposits in the slot canyon were deposited {{in the latter half of}} that period. Older deposits in the slot canyon have been identified, separated from the younger alluvium by a significant hiatus in paleoflood deposition. Observations from the modern wash suggest that the grade of the constricted reach is more variable than is typically assumed by paleoflood hydrologists.

40|$|Over 81 % of all {{streams in}} the {{southwest}} United States are ephemeral or intermittent. Given the delicate balance between sediment supply and discharge, these streams are sensitive monitors of landscape response to past and future climate change. At {{the turn of the}} 20 th century (AD ~ 1880), many streams in the SW suddenly incised up to 30 m into their floodplains forming steep-walled arroyos entrenched into cohesive fine-grained valley-fill alluvium. Settlements in the semi-arid SW are dependent on water availability and during historic arroyo entrenchment, widespread channel incision and floodplain abandonment caused communities to become disconnected from water resources and led to abandonment of some towns. Importantly, climate models predict greater temperature extremes and more frequent floods and droughts in the SW US. Investigating geomorphic response to past climate change enables us to better understand how the landscape might respond to future climate change. Chronostratigraphic reconstructions indicate that during the mid-late Holocene these systems underwent multiple periods of rapid episodic entrenchment followed by slow re-aggradation. This research investigates the role of allogenic forcing (climate change) and autogenic processes on cut-fill dynamics. A stream channel maintains a dynamic equilibrium in which the channel bed adjusts its slope and geomorphic form in response to changes in discharge and sediment supply. This study tests if temporal or spatial disparities in sediment supply have influenced the timing and location of arroyo aggradation and entrenchment. We measured in-situ 10 -Be in quartz from alluvial and colluvial sediment in Kanab Creek and Johnson Wash to quantify catchment-average erosion rates. Samples were collected from modern channels throughout the watershed and from dated alluvial <b>packages</b> <b>preserved</b> in arroyo walls. Results quantify spatial and temporal variability in sediment supply throughout the two watersheds as a function of lithology, slope, elevation, contribution of sediment stored in valley-fill, and time. Moreover, 10 -Be results from dated Holocene alluvium will be used to evaluate if climate change has influenced sediment supply and arroyo cut-fill dynamics...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} of the mechanisms of edge wicking in retortable paperboard. Retortable board is used for <b>packaging</b> <b>preserved</b> food, a process which requires that the package and its contents be sterilised by exposure to high temperature steam for up to three hours. The board used must thus have higher water repellence than traditional liquid packaging. Water vapour that condenses on the cut edges {{on the outside of the}} board causes particular concern. The paperboards studied were made from refined and unrefined bleached softwood kraft pulp and from refined unbleached softwood kraft pulp in one or two plies with different sizing levels and structures. Samples of each of the boards were immersed in a water bath at 95 °C. Other samples from the same boards were exposed to a combination of saturated steam at 130 °C and condensed steam in a special apparatus developed for this purpose. The board samples were placed on a cooling plate to simulate the temperature gradient when a container of cold food is sterilised with heated steam. Still other samples were exposed to heated steam in the absence of condensation by hanging them freely in the apparatus. The extent of edge wicking in the boards was determined by gravimetric measurements and also by near-infrared (NIR) spectroscopy, a technique that yields more information about the moisture content profiles and the mechanisms of liquid sorption. The moisture content profiles of boards exposed to saturated steam in the absence of condensation show more uniform water uptake. This phenomenon can be explained by rapid vapour phase transport throughout the pore structure, followed by slower water uptake in the fibres. By contrast, in samples exposed to both heated steam and condensed steam, there was both liquid sorption in the fibre network and rapid vapour phase transport of the steam. The moisture content in those samples was much higher close to the edge and lower behind the liquid frontier. The edge wicking of high temperature water was greatest in board that was not fully sized, in low density board, and in board made from unrefined pulp. The greater edge wicking in board made from unbleached pulp can be accounted for in terms of its greater swelling potential. In the low density board and the board made from unrefined pulp, the lumens at the unsized edge and the weaker bonding strength are suggested to affect the results. Capillary sorption takes place in lumens and delaminated bonds at the edge and then any further propagation takes place entirely by fibre diffusion. Capillary sorption may also be important in damaged areas where broken fibre-fibre bonds are exposed to liquid. The weaker bonded area in low density board therefore also contributes to water sorption. Edge wicking in the boards placed on the cooling plate and exposed to a combination of saturated and condensed steam was of a different nature. For these samples, density was not an important factor. The difference is due to the different mechanism at work in this case, where the relative area of the edge exposed to condensed steam was larger in the high density boards than in the low density boards. In the high density boards, condensed steam was sorbed in the structure by diffusion in the fibre structure, whereas in low density boards, the dominant effect was vapour phase transport in the void spaces followed by water uptake in the fibres.
