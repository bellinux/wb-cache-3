50|$|The railway block {{signalling}} bell code {{is a system}} of bell rings used in Great Britain to communicate between manually operated Signal Boxes (the system is not used in modern power signal boxes, unless it is a fringe box to an older signalbox). Each signal box would have a bell circuit to the box {{on either side of}} it along the line. The equipment would consist of a plunger or tapper (rather like a Morse key) which if <b>pressed,</b> <b>rings</b> the bell in the neighbouring box. The neighbouring box would have a key for communicating back, therefore each box has a key which rings the bell in the other box. Where a signal box communicates with more than one other box (in either direction along the line, and possibly along a branch line too), each bell would have a different tone, so that the signalman could tell them apart by ear.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Ceramic Raschig {{rings are}} used as fillers in the columns for {{wastewater}} treatment to immobilise heavy metals in polluted waters. Their effectiveness is determined by properties such as porosity and specific surface area. Therefore, microstructural control during processing is necessary to assure uniform performance of random packed columns filled with Raschig rings. In this work, Weibull statistics of the stress to fracture of rings placed under diametrical compression loading is proposed as a method to compare reliability of the rings. Three green processing methods, uniaxial pressing, extrusion and slip casting, {{have been used to}} obtain rings using industrial and urban wastes as raw materials (diatoms from beer industry, sludges from paper industry and animal bones). Significant differences between the Weibull parameters for the three series of the same material were found indicating that the most reliable processing route was extrusion. The same analysis was done for uniaxially <b>pressed</b> <b>rings</b> containing hydroxyapatite as single-phase. In spite of differences between the actual strength values, Weibull parameters were coincident for both uniaxially pressed series...|$|R

Residual ceramic coating was gently machined off followed by dimensional and density measurements.

40|$|Today's {{electrical}} energy conversion devices, such as motors, transformers, inductors and generators, {{are based on}} laminated magnetic cores for reduction of eddy current losses, imposing a two-dimensional magnetic flux distribution. Using a three-dimensional magnetic flux distribution while maintaining low magnetic losses requires new approaches to magnetic core materials. Soft Magnetic Composites, SMC's, are compounds consisting of magnetic iron particles coated with a thin and electrically insulating layer. Compacting and shaping such particles without reducing {{the effectiveness of the}} electrical insulation layer, while maintaining the magnetic characteristics, presents a major challenge. Furthermore, new motor designs taking into account the new possibilities of SMC's have been investigated only sparingly. The state-of-the-art SMC material today does not meet current requirements. Additional efforts are needed in the following three areas: CVD powder coating processes (for electrical insulation), bulk material characterisation methods (evaluation of magnetic, structural and mechanical bulk properties) and compaction/tooling processes (for bulk material/application production). The goals for the research study included an extensive literature research, the task to design and build a fluidising bed reactor CVD (FBRCVD) system and an exploration of the possibilities to deposit standard qualities of iron powder with various metal oxide films. In the literature research, it was concluded that the amount of published work pertaining to FBRCVD was rather scarce. It was shown that an FBRCVD apparatus could be designed and built.

We tend to transition from a smartphone to a notebook when arriving in the office, and when we return home, we often switch to a tablet. In between, we might use large wall-mounted displays, car navigation systems, selfcheckout kiosks at retail stores, and home security or smart home controls. Many of these devices—even if only used in the home—have multiple users. Over the next decade, this range of devices will likely increase, and our time with any single device will grow shorter. We argue that it’s time for touchbased personal tokens that let devices unobtrusively identify who is interacting with the device at any given time. This would let devices tailor services to users and apply authentication to control access to sensitive information and online services. Consider, for example, that a child reportedly spent more than $ 1, 000 on in-app purchases while playing games on his mother’s iPhone. 1 Devices that know their users could limit such spending from unauthorized users and serve age-appropriate content and media.

40|$|This {{report is}} the result of a thesis work in mechanichal {{engineering}} performed at Volvo GroupTrucks Operations, Powertrain productions in Köping by the student Christoffer Jansson. Thework of 15 ECTS credits is conducted over a 20 week period at half speed equivalent to 400 working hours. The background to the work is the desire to improve a workstation where the transmissions tothe IPS 2 / 3 and IPS 15 are assembled. The problem on the workstation is that the workers areperforming non value-added activities (NVAA) and it is of interest that one would examine thepossibility of how to squeeze two bearing rings in the same sequence. The aim is thus todevelop a suggestion of improvement for the bearing pressing method on the assembly line. The issue the thesis work is based on is: How does one manage to press together two bearingrings in the same sequence into a particular component? & How can one improve theergonomic circumstances on the workstation?To be able to perform this work, a case study based on the product development processaccording to Ulrich and Eppinger (2012) has been made. Product development tools are used tofacilitate the work of the student. Including Gantt chart, Pugh's analysis and functional analysis. The result of the work is a modification of the existing working table where the bearing ringsare pressed into the middle gear housing. The solution consists of a steel plate that rests on fivesprings which dampen the weight of the middle gear housing. The middle gear housing is thecomponent in which the bearing <b>rings</b> are <b>pressed</b> in. There are 5 guiding rods that are mountedon the steel plate, one for each spring, which has the function to keep the steel plate stablewhen the middle gear housing is set on top. These guiding rods are in turn controlled bybushings which serve to reduce friction. The bushings are standard components that aremounted into a component called the bushing holder, which is a component that is screwed intothe table. The new working process the solution provides eliminates the previous NVAA that has been onthe station before and allows the worker to <b>press</b> two bearing <b>rings</b> into the middle gearinghouse in the same sequence. The ergonomic circumstances have also been improved due to theelimination of the worker having to rotate the heavy middle gearing house 180 degrees.
