25|$|MIMO can be sub-divided {{into three}} main categories: <b>precoding,</b> spatial {{multiplexing}} (SM), and diversity coding.|$|E
25|$|<b>Precoding</b> is multi-stream beamforming, in {{the narrowest}} definition. In more general terms, it is {{considered}} to be all spatial processing that occurs at the transmitter. In (single-stream) beamforming, the same signal is emitted from each of the transmit antennas with appropriate phase and gain weighting such that the signal power is maximized at the receiver input. The benefits of beamforming are to increase the received signal gain – by making signals emitted from different antennas add up constructively – and to reduce the multipath fading effect. In line-of-sight propagation, beamforming results in a well-defined directional pattern. However, conventional beams are not a good analogy in cellular networks, which are mainly characterized by multipath propagation. When the receiver has multiple antennas, the transmit beamforming cannot simultaneously maximize the signal level at all of the receive antennas, and <b>precoding</b> with multiple streams is often beneficial. Note that <b>precoding</b> requires knowledge of channel state information (CSI) at the transmitter and the receiver.|$|E
25|$|The {{purpose of}} radio {{resource}} management is {{to satisfy the}} data rates that are requested by the users of a cellular network. The main resources are time intervals, frequency blocks, and transmit powers. Each user has its own objective function that, for example, can represent some combination of the data rate, latency, and energy efficiency. These objectives are conflicting since the frequency resources are very scarce, thus {{there is a need}} for tight spatial frequency reuse which causes immense inter-user interference if not properly controlled. Multi-user MIMO techniques are nowadays used to reduce the interference by adaptive <b>precoding.</b> The network operator would like to both bring great coverage and high data rates, thus the operator would like to find a Pareto optimal solution that balance the total network data throughput and the user fairness in an appropriate subjective manner.|$|E
40|$|In Orthogonal Frequency Division {{multiplexing}} (OFDM) one of {{the main}} drawbacks is High peak to Average Power Ratio. So Reducing the PAPR will reduce the Complexity of Converters (such as Analog to Digital & Digital to Analog Converters) and also increases the efficiency of RF High power Amplifier (HPA). In this paper analysis of various <b>Precoded</b> OFDM Systems for M-QAM (where M= 16, 32, 64, 256). We compare the Computer simulation results of <b>precoded</b> Systems to find better PAPR Reduction Method. Analysis is done on Discrete Hartley Transform(DHT) <b>precoded</b> OFDM system, Walsh Hadamard Transform(WHT) <b>precoded</b> OFDM system, Selected Mapping(SLM), Discrete Fourier (DFT) <b>precoded</b> OFDM system using M-QAM. Simulation results show that the PAPR of DHT <b>precoded</b> OFDM system is lower than WHT <b>precoded</b> OFDM system, SLM-OFDM system and OFDM conventional and DFT <b>precoded</b> OFDM system has almost zero PAPR...|$|R

25|$|Spatial {{multiplexing}} requires MIMO antenna configuration. In spatial multiplexing, a high-rate {{signal is}} split into multiple lower-rate streams and each stream {{is transmitted from}} a different transmit antenna in the same frequency channel. If these signals arrive at the receiver antenna array with sufficiently different spatial signatures and the receiver has accurate CSI, it can separate these streams into (almost) parallel channels. Spatial multiplexing {{is a very powerful}} technique for increasing channel capacity at higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The maximum number of spatial streams is limited by the lesser of the number of antennas at the transmitter or receiver. Spatial multiplexing can be used without CSI at the transmitter, but can be combined with <b>precoding</b> if CSI is available. Spatial multiplexing can also be used for simultaneous transmission to multiple receivers, known as space-division multiple access or multi-user MIMO, in which case CSI is required at the transmitter. The scheduling of receivers with different spatial signatures allows good separability.|$|E

50|$|In {{multi-user}} MIMO, a multi-antenna transmitter communicates {{simultaneously with}} multiple receivers (each having one or multiple antennas). This {{is known as}} space-division multiple access (SDMA). From an implementation perspective, <b>precoding</b> algorithms for SDMA systems can be sub-divided into linear and nonlinear <b>precoding</b> types. The capacity achieving algorithms are nonlinear, but linear <b>precoding</b> approaches usually achieve reasonable performance with much lower complexity. Linear <b>precoding</b> strategies include maximum ratio transmission (MRT), zero-forcing (ZF) <b>precoding,</b> and transmit Wiener <b>precoding</b> There are also <b>precoding</b> strategies tailored for low-rate feedback of channel state information, for example random beamforming. Nonlinear <b>precoding</b> is designed based {{on the concept of}} dirty paper coding (DPC), which shows that any known interference at the transmitter can be subtracted without the penalty of radio resources if the optimal <b>precoding</b> scheme can be applied on the transmit signal.|$|E
40|$|Streaming of <b>precoded</b> video, {{which is}} both source and channel coded, over {{wireless}} networks faces challenges of time-varying packet loss rate and fluctuating bandwidth. Rate shaping has been proposed in [1] to "shape" the <b>precoded</b> video {{to adapt to the}} real-time bandwidth requirement and the packet loss rate. In this paper, we propose a novel "fine-grained rate shaping (FGRS) " scheme to allow for bandwidth adaptation over a wide range of bandwidth and packet loss rate. The video is <b>precoded</b> with fine granularity scalability (FGS) followed by forward error correction (FEC) coding with erasure codes. Utilizing the fine granularity property of FGS and FEC, FGRS selectively drops part of the <b>precoded</b> video and still yields decodable bitstream at the decoder. A new two-stage rate-distortion (R-D) optimization, with model-based hyper-plane and hill-climbing based refinement, is proposed to select part of the <b>precoded</b> video to drop. Promising results of FGRS are shown...|$|R

50|$|This {{suboptimal}} approach cannot {{achieve the}} weighted sum rate, {{but it can}} still maximize the weighted sum performance (or some other metric of achievable rates under linear <b>precoding).</b> The optimal linear <b>precoding</b> {{does not have any}} closed-form expression, but it {{takes the form of a}} weighted MMSE <b>precoding</b> for single-antenna receivers. The <b>precoding</b> weights for a given user are selected to maximize a ratio between the signal gain at this user and the interference generated at other users (with some weights) plus noise. Thus, <b>precoding</b> can be interpreted as finding the optimal balance between achieving strong signal gain and limiting inter-user interference.|$|E
5000|$|New beam-forming: linear beam-forming such as MF, ZF and MMSE and {{non-linear}} beam-forming (<b>precoding)</b> such as Tomlinson-Harashima <b>precoding</b> (THP), vector perturbation (VP), and Dirty paper coding (DPC).|$|E
50|$|The <b>precoding</b> {{strategies}} {{described above}} {{was based on}} having perfect channel state information at the transmitter. However, in real systems, receivers can only feed back quantized information that is described by {{a limited number of}} bits. If the same <b>precoding</b> strategies are applied, but now based on inaccurate channel information, additional interference appears. This is an example on limited feedback <b>precoding.</b>|$|E

This is possible as the actual choice of the sorting order of THP at the d th subcarrier influences the <b>precoded</b> signal only at this position.|$|R
50|$|Instances {{of dirty}} paper coding include Costa <b>precoding</b> (1983). Suboptimal approximations of dirty paper coding include Tomlinson-Harashima <b>precoding</b> (THP) {{published}} in 1971 and the vector perturbation technique of Hochwald et al. (2005).|$|E

This important relationship between downlink <b>precoding</b> and uplink receive filtering is known as the uplink-downlink duality. As the downlink <b>precoding</b> problem usually is more difficult to solve, it often useful to first solve the corresponding uplink problem.|$|E

40|$|Most {{existing}} techniques for space time block coding (STBC) systems have assumed full decorrelated radio channels {{which may not}} be the case in practice. In this paper a subspace based approach of semi-blind channel estimation is proposed for <b>precoded</b> STBC systems, in which multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels are partially correlated. By carefully designing the transceiver of the <b>precoded</b> STBC systems, correlated MIMO channels (where correlation is due to antenna geometry) can be converted to full independent MIMO channels. Then a conventional subspace based channel estimation method is applied to such <b>precoded</b> STBC systems. Simulation results demonstrate the performance of the proposed algorithm...|$|R

The correlation properties of radio channel are made use of in order to derive novel feedback compression schemes.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} {{research on}} the design {{and implementation of the}} unequal error protection (UEP) mechanism for the RaptorQ forward error correction (FEC) scheme. As part of this research, existing UEP mechanisms for various fountain codes were evaluated. Two new UEP methods were proposed for the RaptorQ coding scheme, and these methods were designed with the assumption that all of the symbols in a source block have the same priority. The first method, known as priority based overhead number (PBON), was based on the priority encoding transmission model, wherein the error-correction capability was altered by making the number of overhead symbols proportional to the priority of the information symbols. This method was extended to the RaptorQ codes with some changes and evaluated for failure probability and performance. The second method, known as priority based <b>precode</b> ratio (PBPR), was designed by changing the <b>precode</b> properties of the RaptorQ codes. The ratio of <b>precode</b> symbols to Luby-Transform symbols in the RaptorQ codes was changed to achieve different error correction capabilities for each priority group. The scheme with the higher number of <b>precode</b> symbols provided superior error-correction capabilities compared to those with fewer <b>precode</b> symbols. Both methods were empirically verified through simulation in the C++ programming language. The results demonstrated that the higher-importance class depicted a better error-correction capability than the lower-importance class...|$|R

5000|$|... === Vectoring === Performance in G.fast {{systems is}} limited to a large extent by {{crosstalk}} between multiple wire pairs in a single cable. Self-FEXT (far-end crosstalk) cancellation, also called vectoring, is mandatory in G.fast. Vectoring technology for VDSL2 was previously specified by the ITU-T in G.993.5, also called G.vector. The first version of G.fast will support an improved version of the linear <b>precoding</b> scheme found in G.vector, with non-linear <b>precoding</b> planned for a future amendment. Testing by Huawei and Alcatel shows that non-linear <b>precoding</b> algorithms can provide an approximate data rate gain of 25% compared to linear <b>precoding</b> in very high frequencies; however, the increased complexity leads to implementation difficulties, higher power consumption, and greater costs. Since all current G.fast implementations are limited to 106 MHz, non-linear <b>precoding</b> yields little performance gain. Instead, current efforts to deliver a gigabit are focusing on bonding, power and more bits per hertz.|$|E

40|$|Dedicated {{short range}} {{communication}} (DSRC) relies on secure distribution to vehicles of a certificate revocation list (CRL) for enabling security protocols. CRL distribution utilizing vehicle-to-vehicle (V 2 V) communications is preferred to an infrastructure-only approach. One approach to V 2 V CRL distribution, using rateless coding at the source and forwarding at vehicle relays is vulnerable to a pollution attack in which a few malicious vehicles forward incorrect packets which then spread through the network leading to denial-of-service. This paper develops a new scheme called Precode-and-Hash that enables efficient packet verification before forwarding thereby preventing the pollution attack. In contrast to rateless codes, it utilizes a fixed low-rate <b>precode</b> and random selection of packets from the set of <b>precoded</b> packets. The fixed <b>precode</b> admits efficient hash verification of all encoded packets. Specifically, hashes are computed for all <b>precoded</b> packets and sent securely using signatures. We analyze {{the performance of the}} Precode-and-Hash scheme for a multi-hop line network and provide simulation results for several schemes in a more realistic vehicular model...|$|R
