40|$|This study {{addresses}} {{a very significant}} policy issue not previously examined at a disaggregated level for Australia by identifying on which day(s) petrol is more expensive and in which locations discount days are non-existent. After conducting a time series analysis of {{the day of the}} week effect in retail prices of unleaded petrol in 114 locations across Australia (Jan 2005 to Apr 2012), it is observed that prices mostly peak on Thursday/Friday and then decline until they hit their cyclical trough mainly on Sunday/Tuesday. However, these daily differences are only statistically significant in capital cities or large regional centres. A cross-sectional analysis of the mean prices during the period Nov 2007 to Feb 2012 shows that (a) in remote and less populous locations, where sales are presumably limited and overhead <b>costs</b> are high, <b>petrol</b> is more expensive; (b) <b>petrol</b> generally <b>costs</b> more <b>in</b> places which exhibit less price variability. The disaggregated and location-specific results can increase our understanding of Australia's retail petrol market and can be beneficial to motorists as well as various government and non-government organisations such as the ACCC (Australian Competition and Consumer Commission), AAA (Australian Automobile Association) and FuelWatch...|$|R

40|$|This report {{outlines}} work {{carried out}} to assess the factors that, in the medium and long term, may influence motorists' mode choice in the Greater Nottingham area. This work was based on four Stated Preference (SP) experiments that examined the choice between car and ordinary bus, car and bus-based park and ride, car and express bus and between departure times for car users. Just over 6, 000 self completion questionnatres were distributed at random to residents in 28 wards. Over 1. 700 usable responses were returned. representing {{a response rate of}} 29 %. Despite a number of problems, a series of four strategic forecasting models were developed. These incoporated some important findings including that motorists value delay highly, value parking costs more highly than <b>petrol</b> <b>costs</b> and value adjusting their departure time less highly than in-vehicle time. The four forecasting models were then used to examine five scenarios; the introduction of park and ride, the effect of projected 2001 road traffic speeds, the effect of <b>petrol</b> <b>cost</b> increases, the effect of parking cost increases and the effect of decreasing bus in-vehicle time. Although {{there were a number of}} technical difficulties. our forecasts suggest that decreases <b>in</b> speeds, parking <b>costs</b> and <b>petrol</b> <b>costs</b> will not halt the growth in road traffic but will slow it down. Where possible motorists are more likely to change the time of theirjourney than theirmode. For dramatic changes in mode split both a big stick and big carrot are probably required. The big stick might be provided by some of parking control or road pricing, whilst the carrot might be some form of a high quality, fast bus network (or indeed other forms of public transport with a segregated right of way). The role of park and ride is likely to be relatively marginal but may be worth pursuing if part of an overall traffic management policy. There was little evidence from our models of there being any critical "thresholds" or "trigger points". However, many of the processes we have examined seem to have cumulative impacts and our forecasts identified the doubling of car journey times as being a possible "catalyst" which is likely to be achieved in the early part of the next centur...|$|R

40|$|Plug-in {{electric}} vehicles (PEVs) are growing in popularity {{in developed countries}} {{in an attempt to}} overcome the problems of pollution, depleting natural oil and fossil fuel reserves and rising <b>petrol</b> <b>costs.</b> <b>In</b> addition, automotive industries are facing increasing community pressure and governmental regulations to reduce emissions and adopt cleaner, more sustainable technologies such as PEVs. However, accepting this new technology depends primarily on the economic aspects for individuals and the development of adequate PEV technologies. The reliability and dependability of the new vehicles (PEVs) are considered the main public concerns due to range anxiety. The limited driving range of PEVs makes public charging a requirement for long-distance trips, and therefore, the availability of convenient and fast charging infrastructure is a crucial factor in bolstering the adoption of PEVs. The goal of the work presented in this thesis was to address the challenges associated with implementing electric vehicle fast charging stations (FCSs) in distribution system. Installing electric vehicle charging infrastructure without planning (free entry) can cause some complications that affect the FCS network performance negatively. First, the number of charging stations with the free entry can be less or more than the required charging facilities, which leads to either waste resources by overestimating the number of PEVs or disturb the driversâ€™ convenience by underestimate the number of PEVs. In addition, it is likely that high traffic areas are selected to locate charging stations; accordingly, other areas could have a lack of charging facilities, which will {{have a negative impact on}} the ability of PEVs to travel in the whole transportation network. Moreover, concentrating charging stations in specific areas can increase both the risk of local overloads and the business competition from technical and economic perspectives respectively. Technically, electrical utilities require that the extra load of adopting PEV demand on the power system be managed. Utilities strive for the implementation of FCSs to follow existing electrical standards in order to maintain a reliable and robust electrical system. Economically, the low PEV penetration level at the early adoption stage makes high competition market less attractive for investors; however, regulated market can manage the distance between charging stations in order to enhance the potential profit of the market. As a means of facilitating the deployment of FCSs, this thesis presents a comprehensive planning model for implementing plug-in electric vehicle charging infrastructure. The plan consists of four main steps: estimating number of PEVs as well as the number of required charging facilities in the network; selecting the strategic points in transportation network to be FCS target locations; investigating the maximum capability of distribution system current structure to accommodate PEV loads; and developing an economical staging model for installing PEV charging stations. The development of the comprehensive planning begins with estimating the PEV market share. This objective is achieved using a forecasting model for PEV market sales that includes the parameters influencing PEV market sales. After estimating the PEV market size, a new charging station allocation approach is developed based on a Trip Success Ratio (TSR) to enhance PEV driversâ€™ convenience. The proposed allocation approach improves PEV driversâ€™ accessibility to charging stations by choosing target locations in transportation network that increase the possibility of completing PEVs trips successfully. This model takes into consideration variations in driving behaviors, battery capacities, States of Charge (SOC), and trip classes. The estimation of PEV penetration level and the target locations of charging stations obtained from the previous two steps are utilized to investigate the capability of existing distribution systems to serve PEV demand. The Optimal Power Flow (OPF) model is utilized to determine the maximum PEV penetration level that the existing electrical system can serve with minimum system enhancement, which makes it suitable for practical implementation even at the early adoption rates. After that, the determination of charging station size, number of chargers and charger installation time are addressed in order to meet the forecasted public PEV demand with the minimum associated cost. This part of the work led to the development of an optimization methodology for determining the optimal economical staging plan for installing FCSs. The proposed staging plan utilizes the forecasted PEV sales to produce the public PEV charging demand by considering the traffic flow in the transportation network, and the public PEV charging demand is distributed between the FCSs based on the traffic flow ratio considering distribution system margins of PEV penetration level. Then, the least-cost fast chargers that satisfy the quality of service requirements in terms of waiting and processing times are selected to match the public PEV demand. The proposed planning model is capable to provide an extensive economic assessment of FCS projects by including PEV demand, price markup, and different market structure models. The presented staging plan model is also capable to give investors the opportunity to make a proper trade-off between overall annual cost and the convenience of PEV charging, as well as the proper pricing for public charging services. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{comparison}} {{in total}} life cycle costs and energy consumption for one high speed ship design {{with three different}} structural materials have been performed. The investigation considers a high speed ferry with a steel hull and an aluminium superstructure, an all aluminium concept and a ship built in sandwich material with carbon fibre faces. The different materials will affect several cost elements during the design, the production and {{the operation of the}} ship until and including its disposal. Furthermore, the material selection has an impact on the energy consumption within all stages of the ships life cycle. The assessment is made in a comparative manner. Hence, identical out fitting components, e. g. interior, instrumentation, and ventilation are left out. It is shown that the steel version causes the highest costs and energy consumption. The sandwich construction has the lowest life cycle costs while the aluminium version has the lowest energy consumption. The break-even point between the steel and the composite versions appears after 4 years (only 2 years of operation!), the break-even point between the aluminium and the composite ferry is after 12 years (10 years of operation). A sensitivity analysis with different possible scenarios, e. g. change <b>in</b> interest, <b>petrol</b> <b>cost,</b> maintenance cost, has been performed.
