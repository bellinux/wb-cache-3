5|$|While {{remaining}} upright may be {{the primary}} goal of beginning riders, a bike must lean in order to maintain balance in a turn: the higher the speed or smaller the turn radius, the more lean is required. This balances the roll torque about the wheel contact patches generated by centrifugal force due to the turn with that of the gravitational force. This lean is usually produced by a momentary steering in the opposite direction, called countersteering. Countersteering skill is usually acquired by motor learning and executed via <b>procedural</b> <b>memory</b> rather than by conscious thought. Unlike other wheeled vehicles, the primary control input on bikes is steering torque, not position.|$|E
25|$|Scientists {{demonstrated}} {{in various ways}} that sleep enhances memory. Apparently <b>procedural</b> <b>memory</b> benefits from late, REM-rich sleep, whereas declarative memory benefits from early, slow wave-rich sleep.|$|E
25|$|In {{most cases}} of {{anterograde}} amnesia, patients lose declarative memory, or the recollection of facts, but they retain nondeclarative memory, often called <b>procedural</b> <b>memory.</b> For instance, {{they are able}} to remember and in some cases learn how to do things such as talking on the phone or riding a bicycle, but they may not remember what they had eaten earlier that day for lunch. One extensively studied anterograde amnesiac patient, codenamed H.M., demonstrated that despite his amnesia preventing him from learning new declarative information, <b>procedural</b> <b>memory</b> consolidation was still possible, albeit severely reduced in power. He, along with other patients with anterograde amnesia, were given the same maze to complete day after day. Despite having no memory of having completed the maze the day before, unconscious practice of completing the same maze over and over reduced the amount of time needed to complete it in subsequent trials. From these results, Corkin et al. concluded despite having no declarative memory (i.e. no conscious memory of completing the maze exists), the patients still had a working <b>procedural</b> <b>memory</b> (learning done unconsciously through practice). This supports the notion that declarative and <b>procedural</b> <b>memory</b> are consolidated in different areas of the brain. In addition, patients have a diminished ability to remember the temporal context in which objects were presented. Certain authors claim the deficit in temporal context memory is more significant than the deficit in semantic learning ability (described below).|$|E
2500|$|Stabilization of {{a memory}} is the {{anchoring}} a memory in place, a weak connection is established. [...] Stabilization of <b>procedural</b> <b>memories</b> can even occur during waking hours, suggesting that specific non-declarative tasks are enhanced {{in the absence}} of sleep.|$|R
50|$|<b>Procedural</b> <b>memories</b> are {{a form of}} nondeclarative memory, so {{they would}} most benefit from the fast-wave REM sleep. In a study, <b>procedural</b> <b>memories</b> {{have been shown to}} benefit from sleep (Walker et al., 2002, as cited in Walker, 2009). Subjects were tested using a tapping task, where they used their fingers to tap a {{specific}} sequence of numbers on a keyboard, and their performances were measured by accuracy and speed. This finger-tapping task was used to simulate learning a motor skill. The first group was tested, retested 12 hours later while awake, and finally tested another 12 hours later with sleep in between. The other group was tested, retested 12 hours later with sleep in between, and then retested 12 hours later while awake. The results showed that in both groups, there was only a slight improvement after a 12-hour wake session, but a significant increase in performance after each group slept. This study gives evidence that REM sleep is a significant factor in consolidating motor skill <b>procedural</b> <b>memories,</b> therefore sleep deprivation can impair performance on a motor learning task. This memory decrement results specifically from the loss of stage 2, REM sleep.|$|R
25|$|The {{formation}} of new episodic memories requires the medial temporal lobe, {{a structure that}} includes the hippocampus. Without the medial temporal lobe, one is able to form new <b>procedural</b> <b>memories</b> (such as playing the piano) but cannot remember the events during which they happened (See the hippocampus and memory).|$|R
25|$|In contrast, implicit, or <b>procedural</b> <b>memory,</b> {{typically}} {{shows no}} decline with age. Other types of short-term memory show little decline, and semantic knowledge (e.g. vocabulary) actually improves with age. In addition, the enhancement seen in memory for emotional events is also maintained with age.|$|E
25|$|The habit–goal {{interface}} or {{interaction is}} {{constrained by the}} particular manner in which habits are learned and represented in memory. Specifically, the associative learning underlying habits {{is characterized by the}} slow, incremental accrual of information over time in <b>procedural</b> <b>memory.</b> Habits can either benefit or hurt the goals a person sets for themselves.|$|E
25|$|Non-declarative {{memory is}} memory gained from {{previous}} experiences that is unconsciously applied to everyday scenarios. Non-declarative memory {{is essential for}} the performance of learned skills and habits, for example, running or cooking a favourite meal. There are three types of non-declarative memories: implicit memory (unconscious memory, priming), instrumental memory (classical conditioning), and <b>procedural</b> <b>memory</b> (automatic skill memory).|$|E

40|$|Recent {{research}} in cognitive science {{has demonstrated that}} there are different types of memory processes. While declarative memory refers to memories for facts or events which can be recalled, <b>procedural</b> <b>memories</b> underlie skills yet encode information which cannot be recalled. This paper extends this distinction {{to the nature of}} emotions and emotional memories. Its implications for psychoanalytic theory are then examined, yielding fresh views of transference, defense, and treatment. Infantile amnesia is found to result partially from the immaturity of the declarative <b>memory</b> system, yet <b>procedural</b> <b>memories</b> encode transference expectations and provide continuity in emotional functioning from early childhood onward. In this light, psychoanalytic treatment is conceptualized as the modification of emotional procedures. Two general methods for modifying procedures are then described, which provide a new model, grounded in current memory research, for understanding therapeutic change through insight and thrugh a new emotional experience with the psychoanalyst...|$|R
50|$|Motor skills, {{also known}} as <b>procedural</b> <b>memories,</b> are {{distinct}} from declarative memories, which involve memories of events, people, places, etc. Both types of memories are, however, subject to a consolidation period, though the neural mechanisms appear to differ. Some of the earliest evidence pointing to a distinction between <b>procedural</b> and declarative <b>memories</b> came from the famous neurology patient HM. As a treatment for severe epilepsy, portions of HM's temporal lobes, including both hippocampi, were removed. This left him unable to form new declarative memories (anterograde amnesia), while his ability to learn novel motor tasks remained intact.|$|R
25|$|Combining Hobson's {{activation}} synthesis hypothesis with Solms' findings, the continual-activation {{theory of}} dreaming presented by Jie Zhang proposes that dreaming {{is a result}} of brain activation and synthesis; at the same time, dreaming and REM sleep are controlled by different brain mechanisms. Zhang hypothesizes that the function of sleep is to process, encode, and transfer the data from the temporary memory store to the long-term memory store. During NREM sleep the conscious-related memory (declarative memory) is processed, and during REM sleep the unconscious related memory (<b>procedural</b> <b>memory)</b> is processed.|$|E
25|$|Many {{different}} types of memory {{have been identified in}} humans, such as declarative memory (including episodic memory and semantic memory), working memory, spatial memory, and <b>procedural</b> <b>memory.</b> Studies done, have found that memory functions, more specifically those associated with the medial temporal lobe are especially vulnerable to age-related decline. A number of studies utilizing a variety of methods such as histological, structural imaging, functional imaging, and receptor binding have supplied converging evidence that the frontal lobes and frontal-striatal dopaminergic pathways are especially affected by age-related processes resulting in memory changes.|$|E
25|$|An {{important}} {{finding in}} amnesic patients with MTL damage is the impairment of memory in all sensory modalities – sound, touch, smell, taste, and sight. This {{reflects the fact}} that the MTL is a processor for all of the sensory modalities, and helps store these kind of thoughts into memory. In addition, subjects can often remember how to perform relatively simple tasks immediately (on the order of 10 seconds), but when the task becomes more difficult, even on the same time scale, subjects tend to forget. This demonstrates the difficulty of separating <b>procedural</b> <b>memory</b> tasks from declarative memory; some elements of declarative memory may be used in learning procedural tasks.|$|E
50|$|Wearing {{can learn}} new {{practices}} {{and even a}} very few facts—not from episodic memory or encoding, but by acquiring new <b>procedural</b> <b>memories</b> through repetition. For example, having watched a certain video recording multiple times on successive days, he never had any memory of ever seeing the video or knowing the contents, but {{he was able to}} anticipate certain parts of the content without remembering how he learned them.|$|R
50|$|Whether a {{skill is}} learned {{explicitly}} (with attention) or implicitly, each {{plays a role}} in the offline consolidation effect. Research suggests that explicit awareness and understanding of the skill being learned during the acquisition process greatly improves the consolidation of <b>procedural</b> <b>memories</b> during sleep. This finding is not surprising, as it is widely accepted that intention and awareness at time of learning enhances the acquisition of most forms of memory.|$|R
40|$|Although {{our ability}} to store {{semantic}} declarative information can nowadays be readily surpassed by that of simple personal computers, {{our ability to}} learn and express <b>procedural</b> <b>memories</b> still outperforms that of supercomputers controlling the most advanced robots. To a large extent, our <b>procedural</b> <b>memories</b> are formed in the cerebellum, which embodies {{more than two-thirds of}} all neurons in our brain. In this review, we will focus on the emerging view that different modules of the cerebellum use different encoding schemes to form and express their respective memories. More specifically, zebrin-positive zones in the cerebellum, such as those controlling adaptation of the vestibulo-ocular reflex, appear to predominantly form their memories by potentiation mechanisms and express their memories via rate coding, whereas zebrin-negative zones, such as those controlling eyeblink conditioning, appear to predominantly form their memories by suppression mechanisms and express their memories in part by temporal coding using rebound bursting. Together, the different types of modules offer a rich repertoire to acquire and control sensorimotor processes with specific challenges in the spatiotemporal domain...|$|R
25|$|Sleep {{in general}} aids memory. REM sleep may favor the {{preservation}} of certain types of memories: specifically, <b>procedural</b> <b>memory,</b> spatial memory, and emotional memory. In rats, REM sleep increases following intensive learning, especially several hours after, and sometimes for multiple nights. Experimental REM sleep deprivation has sometimes inhibited memory consolidation, especially regarding complex processes (e.g., how to escape from an elaborate maze). In humans, the best evidence for REM's improvement of memory pertains to learning of procedures—new ways of moving the body (such as trampoline jumping), and new techniques of problem solving. REM deprivation seemed to impair declarative (i.e., factual) memory only in more complex cases, such as memories of longer stories. REM sleep apparently counteracts attempts to suppress certain thoughts.|$|E
25|$|Some {{retrograde}} and anterograde amnesics {{are capable}} of non-declarative memory, including implicit learning and procedural learning. For example, some patients show improvement on the pseudorandom sequences experiment as healthy people do. Therefore, procedural learning can proceed independently of the brain system required for declarative memory. According to fMRI studies, the acquisition of procedural memories activates the basal ganglia, the premotor cortex and the supplementary motor area, regions which are not normally associated {{with the formation of}} declarative memories. This type of dissociation between declarative and <b>procedural</b> <b>memory</b> can also be found in patients with diencephalic amnesia such as Korsakoff's syndrome. Another example demonstrated by some patients, such as K.C. and H.M, who have medial temporal damage and anterograde amnesia, still have perceptual priming. Those patients did well in the word fragment completion test.|$|E
25|$|Psychogenic amnesia {{is defined}} by the {{presence}} of retrograde amnesia (the inability to retrieve stored memories leading up to the onset of amnesia), and an absence of anterograde amnesia (the inability to form new long term memories). Access to episodic memory can be impeded, while the degree of impairment to short term memory, semantic memory and <b>procedural</b> <b>memory</b> is thought to vary among cases. If other memory processes are affected, they are usually much less severely affected than retrograde autobiographical memory, which is taken as the hallmark of psychogenic amnesia. However the wide variability of memory impairment among cases of psychogenic amnesia raises questions as to its true neuropsychological criteria, as despite intense study {{of a wide range of}} cases there is little consensus of which memory deficits are specific to psychogenic amnesia.|$|E
30|$|Damage to {{this area}} could have {{significant}} and long-lasting effects on short- and long-term memory as evidenced by its {{critical role in the}} pathogenesis of Alzheimer’s disease. The implications of damage {{to this area}} of the brain are best underscored by the case of H.M., a patient who underwent medial temporal lobe resection for epilepsy in 1953. He lost virtually all of his entorhinal cortex, and as a result he suffered severe anterograde amnesia whereas his working and <b>procedural</b> <b>memories</b> remained intact [26].|$|R
40|$|Effective {{management}} of learned knowledge {{is a challenge}} when modeling human-level behavior within complex, temporally extended tasks. This paper evaluates one approach to this problem: forgetting knowledge {{that is not in}} active use (as determined by base-level activation) and can likely be reconstructed if it becomes relevant. We apply this model for selective retention of learned knowledge to the working and <b>procedural</b> <b>memories</b> of Soar. When evaluated in simulated, robotic exploration and a competitive, multi-player game, these policies improve model reactivity and scaling while maintaining reasoning competence...|$|R
40|$|Working {{memory is}} often {{described}} as a system for simultaneous storage and processing. Much research - and most measures of working-memory capacity - focus on the storage component only, that is, peoplÃ©s ability to recall or recognize items after short retention intervals. The mechanisms of processing information are studied in a separate research tradition, concerned with the selection and control of actions in simple choice situations, dual-task constellations, or task-switching setups. Both research traditions investigate performance based on representations that are temporarily maintained in an active, highly accessible state, and constrained by capacity limits. In this article an integrated theoretical framework of declarative and <b>procedural</b> working <b>memory</b> is presented that relates the two domains of research to each other. Declarative working memory is proposed to hold representations available for processing (including recall and recognition), whereas <b>procedural</b> working <b>memory</b> holds representations that control processing (i. e., task sets, stimulus-response mappings, and executive control settings). The framework motivates two hypotheses: Declarative and <b>procedural</b> working <b>memory</b> have separate capacity limits, and they operate by analogous principles. The framework also suggests a new characterization of executive functions as the subset of processes governed by <b>procedural</b> working <b>memory</b> that has as its output a change in the conditions of operation of the working-memory system...|$|R
500|$|Cognitive {{abilities}} are progressively impaired. [...] Especially affected are executive functions, which include planning, cognitive flexibility, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, initiation of appropriate actions, and inhibition of inappropriate actions. As the disease progresses, memory deficits tend to appear. Reported impairments range from short-term memory deficits to long-term memory difficulties, including deficits in episodic (memory of one's life), <b>procedural</b> (<b>memory</b> {{of the body}} of how to perform an activity) and working memory. Cognitive problems tend to worsen over time, ultimately leading to dementia. This pattern of deficits has been called a subcortical dementia syndrome to distinguish it from the typical effects of cortical dementias e.g. Alzheimer's disease.|$|E
500|$|Damage to the {{hippocampus}} {{does not affect}} some types of memory, {{such as the ability}} to learn new skills (playing a musical instrument or solving certain types of puzzles, for example). [...] This fact suggests that such abilities depend on different types of memory (<b>procedural</b> <b>memory)</b> and different brain regions. Furthermore, amnesic patients frequently show [...] "implicit" [...] memory for experiences {{even in the absence of}} conscious knowledge. For example, patients asked to guess which of two faces they have seen most recently may give the correct answer most of the time in spite of stating that they have never seen either of the faces before. Some researchers distinguish between conscious recollection, which depends on {{the hippocampus}}, and familiarity, which depends on portions of the medial temporal lobe.|$|E
2500|$|Most {{of the eye}} {{movements}} in “rapid eye movement” sleep are in fact less rapid than those normally exhibited by waking humans. They are also shorter in duration {{and more likely to}} loop back to their starting point. About seven of such loops take place over one minute of REM sleep. In slow-wave sleep the eyes can drift apart; however, the eyes of the paradoxical sleeper move in tandem. These eye movements follow the ponto-geniculo-occipital waves originating in the brain stem. The eye movements themselves may relate to the sense of vision experienced in the dream, but a direct relationship remains to be clearly established. Congenitally blind people, who do not typically have visual imagery in their dreams, [...] still move their eyes in REM sleep. An alternative explanation suggests that the functional purpose of REM sleep is for <b>procedural</b> <b>memory</b> processing, and the rapid eye movement is only a side effect of the brain processing the eye-related <b>procedural</b> <b>memory.</b>|$|E
40|$|Sleep after {{learning}} {{has been shown}} to foster the consolidation of new memories. However, fundamental questions on the best timing of learning before night-time sleep persist. We tested the hypothesis that learning directly prior to night-time sleep compared to 7. 5 hrs prior to night-time sleep provides better conditions for the consolidation of declarative and <b>procedural</b> <b>memories.</b> Fifty healthy female adolescents (aged 16 - 17 years) were trained on a declarative word-pair and a procedural finger-tapping task at 3 pm (afternoon group, n = 25) or at 9 pm (evening group, n = 25), followed by a sleep laboratory night. Retrieval was assessed 24 hours and 7 days after initial training. Subjects trained in the afternoon showed a significantly elevated retention rate of word-pairs compared to subjects trained in the evening after 24 hours, but not after 7 days. In contrast, off-line gains in finger-tapping performance were significantly higher in subjects trained in the evening compared to those trained in the afternoon after both retention intervals. The observed enhanced consolidation of <b>procedural</b> <b>memories</b> after training in the evening fits to current models of sleep-related memory consolidation. In contrast, the higher retention of declarative memories after encoding in the afternoon is surprising, appeared to be less robust and needs further investigation...|$|R

40|$|Sleep {{benefits}} memory consolidation. Previous theoretical accounts {{have proposed}} a differential role of slow-wave sleep (SWS), rapid-eye-movement (REM) sleep, and stage N 2 sleep for different types of memories. For example the dual process hypothesis proposes that SWS is beneficial for declarative memories, whereas REM sleep is important for consolidation of non-declarative, <b>procedural</b> and emotional <b>memories.</b> In fact, numerous recent studies do provide further support for the crucial role of SWS (or non-REM sleep) in declarative memory consolidation. However, recent evidence {{for the benefit of}} REM sleep for non-declarative memories is rather scarce. In contrast, several recent studies have related consolidation of <b>procedural</b> <b>memories</b> (and some also emotional memories) to SWS (or non-REM sleep) -dependent consolidation processes. We will review this recent evidence, and propose future research questions to advance our understanding of the role of different sleep stages for memory consolidation...|$|R
2500|$|Wearing's case {{reinforces}} {{the theory that}} episodic memory fundamentally differs from procedural or semantic memory. Sacks suggests that while Wearing is completely unable to recall events or episodes, musical performance (and the muscle memory involved) are a form of <b>procedural</b> <b>memory</b> that is not typically hindered in amnesia cases [...] Indeed, {{there is evidence that}} while episodic memory is reliant on the hippocampal formation, amnesiacs with damage to this area can show a loss of episodic memory accompanied by (partially) intact semantic memory.|$|E
2500|$|A {{similar case}} {{involved}} Clive Wearing, an accomplished musicologist who contracted a cold sore virus that attacked his brain, causing herpes simplex encephalitis. As a result, Wearing developed both anterograde and retrograde amnesia, {{so he has}} little memory of what happened before the virus struck him in 1985, and cannot learn new declarative knowledge after the virus struck him either. As a result of anterograde amnesia, Wearing repeatedly [...] "wakes up" [...] every day usually in 30-second intervals. [...] He {{has a history of}} repeatedly recording these moments of waking up in his journal (e.g., On Sept 2, 2013 I woke up, etc. etc.) and crossing out prior entries, as if the other moments of waking up were not real. [...] His episodic memory is nonfunctional (so he does not consciously recall having woken up 30 seconds prior). [...] Clive is often elated to see his wife, as if he has not seen her for a while. [...] Despite this, however, Wearing maintained his ability to play the piano and conduct choirs. This case is significant because it demonstrates declarative and <b>procedural</b> <b>memory</b> are separate. Therefore, despite anterograde amnesia preventing Wearing from learning new bits of information that can be explained in words (declarative memory), and also preventing him from storing new memories of events or episodes (also part of declarative memory), he has little trouble in retaining his musical abilities (<b>procedural</b> <b>memory),</b> though he has no conscious memory of having learned music.|$|E
2500|$|Anterograde amnesia is the {{inability}} to create new memories due to brain damage, while long-term memories from before the event remain intact.

The two brain regions related with this condition are medial temporal lobe and medial diencephalon. Anterograde amnesia cannot be treated with pharmacological methods due to neuronal loss. However, treatment exists in educating patients to define their daily routines and after several steps they begin to benefit from their <b>procedural</b> <b>memory.</b> Likewise, social and emotional support is critical to improving quality of life for anterograde amnesia sufferers.|$|E
25|$|While its storage {{capacity}} {{is too low}} {{to make it the}} sole mechanism for storage, nonsynaptic plasticity could contribute to synaptic storage methods. It has been shown that the modulation of ion channels can occur in regions as small as specific dendrites. This specificity makes the {{storage capacity}} of nonsynaptic plasticity larger than if it were taken to be whole neuron modulation. <b>Procedural</b> <b>memories</b> are a good fit for this type of storage system because they do not require the high specificity that declarative memories do. Generalization of motor tasks and conditioned stimuli could be an efficient way to store this information.|$|R
50|$|While {{the precise}} neural basis for motor skill {{consolidation}} {{is not fully}} understood, many of the structures necessary for the process have been identified. As {{the process of learning}} a motor skill requires both initial execution of the skill, as well as long storage of the consolidated memory, a complex network of brain areas are involved, including the primary motor cortex, the cerebellum, the prefrontal cortex, and the basal ganglia. Given that motor skill consolidation is a distributed process, the ability to form new <b>procedural</b> <b>memories</b> is susceptible to the effects of a number of processes and pathologies.|$|R
