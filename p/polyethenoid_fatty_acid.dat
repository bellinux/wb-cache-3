Tween-fatty acid esters carrying specific <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were synthesized and applied to various organs of plants growing axenically in glass jars. Treated plants incorporated large amounts of exogenous <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> into all acylated membrane lipids detected. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were taken up by both roots and leaves. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acids</b> applied to roots were found in leaves, while <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> applied to leaves appeared in both leaves higher on the plant and in roots, indicating translocation (probably in the phloem). Foliar application was most effective; up to 20 % of membrane <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> of leaves above the treated leaf and up to 40 % of root membrane <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were exogenously derived. Plants which took up exogenous <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> changed their patterns of <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis such that ratios of saturated to unsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> remained essentially unaltered. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acid</b> uptake was most extensively studied in soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merr.), but was also observed in other species, including maize (Zea mays L.), mung beans (Vigna radiata L.), peas (Pisum sativum L.), petunia (Petunia hybrida L.) and tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.).

The enhanced AMPK signalling occurred {{in the absence of}} detectable changes in free AMP and glycogen content. The activity of the upstream kinase LKB 1 was decreased by <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> treatment indicating that AMPK activation was not a consequence of LKB 1 activation. Instead, <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> enhanced LKB 1 phosphorylation of AMPK. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acids</b> did not alter LKB 1 activity when either synthetic peptide or AMPK α(1 – 312) catalytic fragment was used as substrate indicating that the βγ subunits were required for the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> activation. Infection of cells with a dominant-negative AMPK adenovirus reduced basal <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> oxidation and inhibited the stimulatory effects of <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> pretreatment on <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> oxidation. These results indicate that increasing <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> availability increases AMPK activity independent of changes in the cellular energy charge and support the view that <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> may modulate AMPK allosterically, making it a better substrate for LKB 1...|$|R
40|$|Present study {{consists}} the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> {{composition of}} five samples of Site 4 B surface sediment from the Pearl River Mouth Basin in the South China Sea. Total <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> (TFA) {{content of the}} ranged from 5. 14 mu g/g to 8. 99 mu g/g (mu g FA/g dry sediment), and the carbon number ranged from C- 12 to C- 32. The <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> detected in the five surface samples include the normal saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> branched-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> and isoprenoid <b>acids.</b> Short-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> in the normal saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were mainly from the marine microorganisms, whereas the long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> were from terrigenous higher plants. The higher concentration of short-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> relative to the long-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> indicates that the input from marine microorganisms in the surface sediment is far greater than that from terrigenous higher plants. The branched-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> i/a 15 : 0, i/a 17 : 0, and 1 Ome 16 : 0 and the monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> 18 : 1 (09 and 16 : 10) 9 were mainly synthesized by sulfate-reducing bacteria, whereas 16 : 1 omega 7 was from the sulfur-oxidizing bacteria. Relative content of the different <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> indicate that the surface sediment is dominated by a reductive environment. In addition, eight isoprenoid acids including phytanic acid, 17 beta(H), 21 beta(H) - 32 -bi-homohopanoic acid, and pristane acid were detected in the surface sediment, and they mainly originated from chlorophyll a and bacteria...|$|R
40|$|<b>Fatty</b> <b>acids</b> {{produced}} by 22 strains of 10 {{species of the}} genus Bacillus were analyzed on a very efficient and selective gas-liquid chromatographic column. All of the 10 species, alvei, brevis, cereus, circulans, licheniformis, macerans, megaterium, polymyxa, pumilus, and subtilis, produced eight <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> six branched (anteiso-C 15, anteiso-C 17, iso-C 14, iso-C 15, iso-C 16, and iso-C 17) and two normal (n-C 14 and n-C 16). In all cases, the six branched-chain <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> made up over 60 % of the total <b>fatty</b> <b>acids.</b> In addition to the eight <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> B. cereus produced four extra <b>fatty</b> <b>acids,</b> three branched (anteiso-C 13, iso-C 12, and iso-C 13) and one monoenoic-n-C 16. Furthermore, there were distinct differences in the relative amounts of <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> produced between B. cereus and the remaining nine species. B. cereus produced iso-C 15 <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> in the largest amount on a glucose-yeast extract medium {{as well as on}} Pennassay Broth. On the other hand, for the remaining nine species, anteiso-C 15 <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> was the major <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> from the glucose-yeast extract medium, whereas the amount of iso-C 15 <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> from Penassay Broth became comparable to that of anteiso-C 15 <b>fatty</b> <b>acid.</b> Mechanisms and various factors affecting the <b>fatty</b> <b>acid</b> distribution pattern in the 10 Bacillus species are discussed...|$|R

50|$|<b>Fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are {{long-chained}} molecules {{having an}} alkyl group {{at one end}} and a carboxylic acid group at the other end. <b>Fatty</b> <b>acid</b> viscosity (thickness) and melting temperature increases with decreasing number of double bonds; therefore, monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> have a higher melting point than polyunsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (more double bonds) and a lower melting point than saturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> (no double bonds). Monounsaturated <b>fatty</b> <b>acids</b> are liquids at room temperature and semisolid or solid when refrigerated.|$|R
