The original 10/30 side-valve engine was improved, becoming by 1923 the overhead valve Alvis 12/50, a highly successful sports car that was produced until 1932. Around 700 of the 12/50 models and 120 of the later Alvis 12/60 models survive today.|$|E
25|$|The 1904 models had 2470cc, four-cylinder, water-cooled, overhead-valve engines {{featuring}} <b>pressure</b> <b>lubrication,</b> {{very unusual}} at the time, {{and were now}} mounted with the epicyclic gearbox between the front seats rather than centrally resulting a design with the driver sitting well forwards and no bonnet. Six-cylinder models joined the line up in 1906. The specification started to become more conventional with wheel steering as an option from 1908, becoming standard {{from the end of}} 1911, and pedals and gear lever replacing the original two-lever system of gear changing. George Lanchester was now in charge, Frederick having resigned in 1913, and the engine moved further forward to a conventional position in the sporting, side-valve, 5.5-litre six-cylinder Forty but very few were made before the outbreak of World War I. A distinctive feature of the engine's valves was their use of leaf springs, rather than coil springs. Frank Lanchester ran the London sales office.|$|E

40|$|The {{heat flow}} paradox {{provides}} {{evidence that a}} dynamic weakening mechanism may be important in understanding fault friction and rupture. We present here a specific model for dynamic velocity weakening that uses the mechanics of well-studied industrial bearings to explain fault zone processes. An elevated fluid pressure is generated in a thin film of viscous fluid that is sheared between nearly parallel surface. This <b>lubrication</b> <b>pressure</b> supports part of the load, therefore reducing the normal stress and associated friction across the gap. The pressure also elastically deforms the wall rock. The model is parameterized using the Sommerfeld number, which {{is a measure of}} the <b>lubrication</b> <b>pressure</b> normalized by the lithostatic load. For typical values of the material properties, slip distance and velocity, the Sommerfeld number suggests that lubrication is an important process. If the lubrication length scales as the slip distance in an earthquake, the frictional stress during dynamically lubricated large earthquakes is 30 % less than the friction with only hydrostatic pore <b>pressure.</b> Elastohydrodynamic <b>lubrication</b> also predicts a decrease in high-frequency (> 1 Hz) radiation above a critical slip distance of a few meters. This prediction is well matched by the strong motion data from the 1999 Taiwan earthquake. The observed 2 orders of magnitude variation in scaled radiated energy between small (M_w 6) is also predicted by the lubrication model...|$|R

50|$|Also {{unlike the}} Chevrolet inline 6, Ford {{products}} used high oil <b>pressure</b> for <b>lubrication</b> {{for the main}} and rod bearings, as do all modern vehicle combustion engines.

40|$|Most {{air conditioners}} utilize vapor {{compression}} refrigeration cycle in their operation.

Due to their remarkable properties in the thermo-physical and heat transfer capabilities, nanoparticles have prospect to be applied in the refrigeration and air conditioning system. The reliability and solubility nanoparticle of TiO 2 in refrigeration systems have been investigated by several by several researchers. By introducing TiO 2 nanoparticle in the lubricant, the friction coefficient and input power of the compressor can be decreased. An air conditioner with cooling capacity of 2. 5 kW is utilized in the experiment. Five different concentrations of nanoparticle in the lubricant, viz. : 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 4, 0. 5 and 0. 6 gram of TiO 2 in one liter of lubricant were mixed using a magnetic stirrer. After 10 days, TiO 2 nanoparticles in the lubricant were observed its solubility. Furthermore, based on their solubility, TiO 2 nanoparticle with concentration of 0. 2 g/L was selected in the experiments. The {{results show that the}} air conditioner using R 290 with TiO 2 nanoparticle in the lubricants works normally and the input power of the air conditioner decreases about 3. 1 % and the cooling capacity and the COP increase about 5. 1 % and 8. 4 %, respectively, compared to the system without nanoparticle in the lubricant...|$|R
40|$|The {{influence}} of the lubricant magnesium stearate (MgSt) on the powder and tablet properties of chitin-Mg silicate coprecipitate was examined and compared with lubricated Avicel (R) 200 and Avicel-Mg silicate coprecipitate.

Lubrication of chitin-Mg silicate with MgSt does not enhance particle agglomeration, whereas the opposite is the case for Avicel (R) 200; the foregoing was ascertained by measurements of the fixed bulk density, constant powder porosity using Kawakita analysis and by the absence of variation in particle size distribution in the presence of up to 5 % (w/w) MgSt. In the case of chitin-Mg silicate tablets the ejection force was greatly reduced at a compression speed of 150, 000 tablet/h at a MgSt concentration of 0. 5 % (w/w). The physical properties and drug dissolution profile of ibuprofen tablets were found to be unaffected when chitin-Mg silicate was lubricated up to 5 % (w/w) with MgSt. Optimal drug dissolution was attained for gemfibrozil tablets using 3 % (w/w) MgSt when compared to a reference (Lopid tablets) ...|$|R
