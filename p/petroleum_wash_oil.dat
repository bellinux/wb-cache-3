40|$|Fast {{screening}} of <b>wash</b> <b>oils</b> is demonstrated using comprehensive two-dimensional gas chromatography (GC×GC). <b>Wash</b> <b>oils</b> {{are used in}} ethylene production plants to minimize compressor fouling. The composition of a <b>wash</b> <b>oil</b> determines its effectiveness in solubilizing heavy hydrocarbons. In particular, the relative amount of 1 - and 2 -ring aromatics is important. The presence of oxygenates is undesirable because of adverse effects to the process. It is shown that GC×GC is well suited for this application. Species in <b>wash</b> <b>oils</b> are separated and grouped into three bands: a nonpolar aliphatics band, 1 - and 2 -ring aromatics band, and polyaromatics band. For a given polar secondary column, the spacing between bands in the second dimension can be adjusted in a broad range by selecting a primary column and an oven-temperature-programming rate. Integration of GC×GC peaks is evaluated using a standard GC integration program and a new GC×GC integration program. Consistent results are obtained using both programs for well-separated GC×GC peaks with relative differences for individual peak ranging from 0. 04 % to 1. 6 %. Peak responses are integrated by the GC×GC software, and the relative amounts of aromatics content and aliphatics content are estimated by peak response percent with relative standard deviations ranging from 0. 15 % to 2. 8 % (n = 3) ...|$|R

The influence of the IBIL structure was explored. The extraction efficiency and the distribution coefficient of indole were used as the indexes to evaluate the IBIL extraction ability. The key experimental parameters, such as the initial indole concentration, extraction time, extraction temperature, and volume ratio of IBIL-to-model <b>wash</b> <b>oil,</b> were investigated to obtain the optimum conditions. The separation mechanism was studied by analyzing the chemical bonds using spectrographic analysis and molecular simulations. The IBILs were recycled by back-extraction and they exhibited good recycling properties with no obvious reduction and a high extraction efficiency.

40|$|Few {{publications}} on oil bodies or oleosomes seem {{concerned about}} their quality (chemical and physical) ex-vivo. This work attempts to identify the main factors (processing and pre-processing) that affect the quality/integrity of sunflower seed oil bodies recovered through a wet-milling process. The physical state of seeds during wet milling {{had a significant impact}} on the quality of the oil body suspension. Pre-soaking for 6 hours before wet milling and multiple washing with alkaline buffer (0. 1 M sodium bicarbonate) was performed to isolate high quality oil body suspensions. It was evident from different physical measurements such as particle size, ζ-potential and light microscopy that pre-soaking had a positive influence on the quality of oil body suspensions with no significant signs of aggregation or coalescence. It was also observed that the resultant <b>washed</b> <b>oil</b> body suspensions were highly surface charged (- 28. 4 ± 1. 2 mV) indicating very stable suspension phase behavior. <b>Washing</b> <b>oil</b> bodies not only removes non-integral, extraneous proteins (derived from the seed matrix) but enriches the lipid content including Tocopherol (α-tocopherol: 491. 6 mg/kg of <b>washed</b> <b>oil</b> bodies compared with 252. 6 mg/kg crude oil bodies). Changes in the composition of <b>oil</b> bodies after <b>washing</b> have been observed before, but this research also monitored the size of <b>oil</b> bodies after <b>washing,</b> and our results indicate that certain factors can shift the distribution of droplet size. It is believed that any change in average size of droplets indicate the presence of disrupted oil bodies whose surface chemistry has changed enough to compromise their integrity on washing. The retention of droplet size on washing may, therefore, be diagnostic for the recovery of intact oil bodies. An assessment of the integrity of oil bodies recovered from sunflower seeds after accelerated aging (5 months) was carried out. Free fatty acid was more pronounced in oil rather than oil bodies, this could be due to the elimination of some of the free acid bound to <b>oil</b> body during <b>washing.</b> Although some minor variation was observed during seed aging, however, the oil bodies remained stable in the final suspension. The results indicate that oil body membrane was extremely robust under extreme conditions and the integrity of oil bodies was preserved. In addition, oil bodies obtained in this study were resistant to oxidation due to the presence of naturally occurring antioxidants (including vitamin E) associated with them [...] The results indicate that the physical barrier of surface membrane protein (oelosin) protect oil bodies against pro-oxidants...|$|R

Fishes exposed to the mixtures of grease and engine <b>wash</b> <b>oil</b> showed various behavioral patterns depending on the amount of doses and exposure time. The test fishes showed different behavioral signs like restlessness, continuous discomfort in swimming, jumping, jerky movement, frequent surfacing, opening and closing operculum, mouth and loss of equilibrium at the final stage. The changes in the mortality of Pangasius sutchi was observed at various exposure periods, i. e., 24, 48, 72 and 96 hrs respectively. The higher exposure period revealed higher percentage of mortality and it was further intensified at higher concentrations. At the concentrations of 3. 0 ml/L, 3. 5 ml/L, 4. 0 ml/L and 4. 5 ml/L, the mortality rate found for this fish for 24 h and 48 h were 0 %, 0 %, 10 %, 20 % and 0 %, 20 %, 30 %, 40 % respectively, while at the same concentrations the mortality rate of 72 and 96 h were 10 %, 30 %, 50 %, 60 % and 20 %, 50 %, 70 %, 90 % respectively.

40|$|Abstract The major {{objective}} {{of this study is}} to report physico-chemical properties of sunflower oil samples collected from different stages of the technological process for sunflower oil refining for food industry. The samples of oil were crude <b>oil,</b> <b>washed</b> <b>oil,</b> bleached oil and deodorized oil. The physico-chemical properties of sunflower oil experimentally determined were density, saponification value (SV), iodine value (IV), and acid value (AV). It was found that the density of sunflower oil remains approximately constant over the different stages of the manufacturing flow of cooking oil, except the crude oil. The acid value significantly decreases from crude oil (2. 588) to deodorized oil (0. 366). The iodine value and saponification value of the different samples of the sunflower oil corresponding to different stages of oil processing varies slightly. The capacity of different models to accurately correlate and/or predict the density of vegetable oil was tested. The density of sunflower oil can be accurately estimated from its SV and IV or with an empirical equation, when density data are available...|$|R
