5000|$|Yarn is {{composed}} of twisted strands of fiber, which are known as plies when grouped together. These strands of yarn are twisted together (plied) {{in the opposite direction}} to make a thicker yarn. Depending on the direction of this final twist, the yarn will have either s&#8209;twist (the threads appear to go [...] "up" [...] to the left) or z&#8209;twist (to the right). For a single <b>ply</b> <b>yarn,</b> the direction of the final twist is the same as its original twist. The twist direction of yarn can affect the final properties of the fabric, and combined use of the two twist directions can nullify skewing in knitted fabric.|$|E

When winding the spun yarn on to the arms it usually is put over and under the arms on the spindle. Even though it turns much more slowly than winding onto a regular spindle it creates a center pull ball of yarn.|$|E

The Globe Factory in Florence, Alabama was burned by troops from the 10th Missouri Volunteer Cavalry in 1863 and rebuilt as the Cypress Mill. After the Cypress Mill closed in 1886, some of its machinery and employees became part of the Mountain Mills operations. The steam-powered mill commenced operations in 1886 under the ownership of W.

50|$|While {{this method}} {{works very well}} with plied yarns, singles don't have bumps to count. One way to {{determine}} the tpi for a single is to add a contrasting color fibre when spinning it, and then {{count the number of}} times the contrasting fibre has wrapped around the yarn. Another method is to measure an inch of yarn and untwist it, counting how many full revolutions it takes until there is no twist left. This can be done by inserting two paper-clips into the yarn, at an inch apart, thus making it easier to count a full revolution. A less precise method is to allow the single to ply against itself: the resulting two <b>ply</b> <b>yarn</b> is about half the number of twists per inch of the single. Thus one can roughly find the number of twists per inch for the single, or one can use the doubled back yarn as a measure.|$|E
40|$|The {{mechanical}} properties of <b>ply</b> <b>yarn</b> depend {{on both the}} {{mechanical properties}} of the single yarns making up the <b>ply</b> <b>yarn</b> {{and the structure of}} the <b>ply</b> <b>yarn,</b> that is, how the single yarns are assembled to create the <b>ply</b> <b>yarn.</b> Similarly, the mechanical properties of the single yarns depend on the mechanical properties of the fibers that constitute the single yarns and the structure of the single yarns.
