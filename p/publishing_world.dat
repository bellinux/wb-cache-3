5|$|Other promotional campaigns {{included}} introducing bound {{versions of}} {{the first chapter of}} the novel, across city bookstores. Tripathi felt that a celebrity name associated with the book would do wonders for its promotion. Hence he sent the book to various known faces in the <b>publishing</b> <b>world</b> like Anil Dharker and Prahlad Kakkar. Ultimately, when Tripathi's agent Tiwari decided to publish around 5,000 copies of the book himself, they already had the celebrity preview attached to it, and it helped in promotion. The UK publication rights of the Shiva trilogy, including The Immortals of Meluha was purchased by Jo Fletcher Books, with the deal being made by Claire Roberts at Trident Media Group, acting on behalf of the author and Bahri from Red Ink Literary Agency. The book would be released in the United States in summer 2013. In 2013, a music album called Vayuputras, an original soundtrack based on the Shiva Trilogy books, was released. The album is an extension of The Immortals of Meluha and The Secret of the Nagas with special tracks inspired by important junctures like Shiva's dance and the war speech in the books. Artists like Sonu Nigam, Taufiq Qureshi, Palash Sen, Bickram Ghosh worked on the album. This was the first time ever that an original soundtrack was made for a book series.|$|E

25|$|Though Rushmore thought {{himself a}} hero for exposing Confidential, {{he became a}} pariah in the <b>publishing</b> <b>world.</b> He {{was no longer an}} editor at the Police Gazette, though he would stop by to {{scrounge}} up work. By 1957, he was reduced to writing occasional articles on hunting for outdoors magazines. His last known assignments were for True War magazine. In December 1957, Rushmore chased his wife and teenaged step-daughter Lynn out of their Manhattan home with a shotgun. Two days before Christmas, Frances and her daughter left their home on the advice of her psychiatrist and stayed with Frances' eldest daughter, 20-year-old Jean Dobbins of Greenwich Village. Mother and daughter later took over a friend's apartment. While Frances was under psychiatric care since the East River incident, Howard himself was now under psychiatric care.|$|E
25|$|Peter Pek {{began his}} career in the <b>publishing</b> <b>world</b> as a {{columnist}} for Sydney-based Livewire Magazine in 1987. In the 90s, Peter became well known for designing launch publications, having worked on the launch editions of Microsoft magazine and SkyPlus magazine (now known as Sky Magazine) for Sky TV. In 1995, he was appointed designer to The Voice, Europe's largest African-Caribbean newspaper. The following year, he was hired to design the launch edition of New Nation newspaper, a British tabloid from a company of Elisabeth Murdoch. In the late 90s, Peter worked with The Guardian and The Observer newspapers. He was also the creative director of Galazee magazine for the Indian satellite station, Zee TV. He had a stint at the Australian Financial Review before being appointed in 1999 as Editor-in-Chief of Manila-based Food & Beverage Magazine.|$|E
25|$|Historians are {{uncertain}} {{as to whether}} Lane's mother was a naturally skilled novelist who never discovered her talents until her sixties – with Lane's only contribution to Wilder's success being her encouragement and her established connections in the <b>publishing</b> <b>world</b> – or if Lane essentially took Wilder's raw manuscripts in hand and completely ghostwrote the series of books known today. Researchers believe the truth is somewhere between these two positions. The writing career of Wilder as a rural journalist and a credible essayist began {{more than two decades}} before the Little House series, and Lane's formidable editing and ghostwriting skills are well-documented. The existing written evidence includes ongoing correspondence between Lane and her mother concerning the development of the multi-volume series along with Lane's extensive personal diaries detailing the time she spent working on the manuscripts, and Wilder's own initial draft manuscripts. All of this reveals an ongoing mutual collaboration that involved Lane more extensively in the earlier books, and to a much lesser extent by the time the series ended, as Wilder's confidence in her own writing ability increased. Lane insisted to the end that her role was little more than that of her mother's adviser, despite documentation to the contrary.|$|E

500|$|Several {{other writers}} have been {{associated}} with the Boom. [...] Juan Rulfo, the author of two books, only one of them a novel, was the acknowledged master incorporated a posteriori; a writer who balances social concern, verbal experimentation and unique style. [...] Augusto Roa Bastos of Paraguay wrote Hijo de hombre, considered by some to be the first novel of the Boom. [...] His highly experimental I, the Supreme has been compared to Joyce's Ulysses and is [...] "one of the most highly regarded works of fictional history to ever come out of South America." [...] Manuel Puig, an Argentine, is a central figure, along with Vargas Llosa, of the Seix-Barral <b>publishing</b> <b>world.</b> The Cuban novelist José Lezama Lima, though not widely known in the English-language <b>publishing</b> <b>world,</b> can also be regarded as a major figure {{on the basis of his}} major novel, Paradiso (1966). José Donoso is a Chilean writer of both the Boom and the post-Boom. In his book, Historia Personal del [...] "Boom", [...] Donoso also mentions other writers associated with the movement. Examples are Jorge Amado (although he began writing novels back in the 1930s) of Brazil, Salvador Garmendia and Adriano González León of Venezuela, Gastón Suárez and Marcelo Quiroga Santa Cruz of Bolivia and David Viñas of Argentina, among many others.|$|E
500|$|In the mid-1950s, Leo Margulies, a {{well-known}} {{figure in the}} magazine <b>publishing</b> <b>world,</b> launched a new company, Renown Publications, with plans to publish several titles. [...] He acquired the rights to both Weird Tales and Short Stories, and hoped to bring both magazines back. [...] He abandoned a plan to restart Weird Tales in 1962, using reprints from the original magazine, after being advised by Sam Moskowitz {{that there was little}} market for weird and horror fiction at the time. [...] Instead Margulies mined the Weird Tales backfile for four anthologies which appeared in the early 1960s: The Unexpected, The Ghoul-Keepers, Weird Tales, and Worlds of Weird. [...] The latter two were ghost-edited by Moskowitz, who proposed to Margulies that when the time was right to start the magazine up again, it should include reprints from obscure sources that Moskowitz had found, rather than just stories reprinted from the first incarnation of Weird Tales. [...] These stories would be as good as new for most readers, and the money saved could be used for an occasional new story.|$|E
