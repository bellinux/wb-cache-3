40|$|The {{production}} of ethanol {{as a substitute}} for liquid petroleum fuel sources has been considered since internal combustion engines were developed. Alcohol fuel can be produced in small-scale systems using locally grown and lower quality fermentation products, such as damaged corn. The traditional high investment costs for controlling the <b>alcohol</b> <b>distillation</b> system to improve efficiency and reduce labor cannot be justified in small scale systems. However, other approaches to controlling the small scale distillation system using a control/benefit analysis may be implemented at far lower costs. ^ A steady-state computer simulation model was developed to characterize the performance of a small-scale, sieve tray ethanol distillation system using direct steam injection. The model was used to characterize the potential benefits of controlling specific distillation system parameters with the objective of reducing operating costs. ^ The model predictions were compared to the actual performance of the 68 kg (25 gallon) per hour distillation system under various control strategies. The agreement between model predictions and actual data was accurate to (+OR-) 6. 0 percent. ^ Results from both the model predictions and field tests indicated that as much as 20 percent of the energy required for distillation could be saved by reducing the reflux ratio as much as possible and by increasing the beer feed concentration and the beer pre-heat temperature. The specific strategies included were for control of: steam line pressure, condenser water temperature, and reflux rate. Energy savings with steam pressure control were as high as 23 percent while reflux control was ineffective and caused unstable system performance. Control of condenser water temperature reduced operator adjustment time considerably but was not important in terms of energy savings. ^ The computer simulation model developed may be used interactively for a variety of <b>alcohol</b> <b>distillation</b> systems using direct steam injection to predict the performance of different operating and control strategies. ...|$|R

Once there are doubts about {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} direct and indirect heating, the aim of this work was to compare three <b>alcohol</b> <b>distillation</b> column projects, using direct steam injection, partial and total reboiler to heat the column. Results based on the case studied showed it is possible to have a stillage quantity reduction of almost 17 % and 1. 8 % of the steam with the use of partial or total reboiler. Based on the quantity of steam decrease observed, it was possible to estimate the payback time of approximately two years for both types of reboilers. Therefore, the partial reboiler proved to be more viable than the total one, since it promotes a separation stage, which can increase the column efficiency and also there is a lower cost than the total reboiler in areas larger than 11, 118. 57 ft.

40|$|The {{large volume}} of sugar cane vinasse {{generated}} by <b>alcohol</b> <b>distillation</b> motivated current treatment to reduce vinasse volume by a concentration process and to eliminate pollutants in the wastewater. The vinasse concentration by the coagulation/flocculation process favored {{the use of the}} thickened sludge either for fertilizing purposes or for biogas production. The photocatalysis treatment of the clarified vinasse mineralized pollutants and reduced toxicity, with subsequent water reuse. The first series of coagulation/flocculation experiments were carried out in a jar-test apparatus at room temperature with samples of 200 mL and several coagulant concentrations. In the second series of experiments, photocatalysis tests were performed on the clarified vinasse obtained by coagulation/flocculation under conditions optimized in the first series of experiments. The photocatalysis tests were performed for five consecutive days with UV irradiation, using TiO 2 -P 25 as photocatalyst. Significant reduction of toxicity, consistent with the reduction in chemical oxygen demand (COD), was found when the photocatalysis treatment subsequent to coagulation/flocculation process was employed.

30|$|A major {{difference}} between {{the old and the}} new device was the improvement of the power of the steam generation (old device: 1600  W, new device: 2200  W), which led to a robust and complete <b>alcohol</b> <b>distillation</b> that now is almost independent of the steam power setting. These results confirm our previous finding using a steam distillation device of another manufacturer (2200  W), which showed a similar improvement in distillation behaviour (Lachenmeier et al. 2006). The setting of 70  % steam power for our further experiments was chosen to avoid a very rapid distillation at the beginning of the distillation, which could potentially exceed the capacity of the condenser leading to a warmer distillate and potential losses (especially for high-strength beverages). Using the old device, we had always recommended to fill an amount of water in the receiver to avoid evaporation at the beginning of the distillation, when the liquid was comparably warm with high concentrations of ethanol. With the new device, we have upheld this protocol to fill water into the receiver, so that the distillation outlet tube is immersed in the water. Experiments (data not shown) have found that the water in the receiver is not absolutely necessary due to the improved condenser, but we have decided to still follow the old protocol to be on the safest possible side and to allow the switching between devices without changes in the standard operating procedure that may lead to operator errors.|$|R

Finally, a third scenario is exergetically evaluated in which sugar, electricity, biogas and alcohol are produced, but this last one from juices and molasses of the sugar process.

40|$|Background: A {{modified}} laboratory-scale upflow anaerobic {{sludge blanket}} (UASB) reactor {{was used to}} obtain methane by treating hydrous ethanol vinasse. Vinasses or stillage are waste materials with high organic loads, and a complex composition resulting from the process of <b>alcohol</b> <b>distillation.</b> They must initially be treated with anaerobic processes due to their high organic loads.

The aim {{of this study was to}} determine the optimum organic loading rate for operating a modified UASB reactor to treat vinasse generated in the production of hydrous ethanol from sugar cane molasses. Results: The study showed that chemical oxygen demand (COD) removal efficiency was 69 % at an optimum organic loading rate (OLR) of 17. 05 kg COD/m 3 -day, achieving a methane yield of 0. 263 m 3 /kg CODadded and a biogas methane content of 84 %. During this stage, effluent characterization presented lower values than the vinasse, except for potassium, sulfide and ammonia nitrogen. On the other hand, primers used to amplify the 16 S-rDNA genes for the domains Archaea and Bacteria showed the presence of microorganisms which favor methane production at the optimum organic loading rate.
