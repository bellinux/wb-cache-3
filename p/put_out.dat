When people ask me which E.T. they should look at, I always tell them to look at the original 1982 E.T. If you notice, when we did <b>put</b> <b>out</b> E.T. we <b>put</b> <b>out</b> two E.T.s. We <b>put</b> <b>out</b> the digitally enhanced version with the additional scenes and for no extra money, in the same package, we <b>put</b> <b>out</b> the original '82 version.

5|$|Most {{judgment}} calls made by {{the official}} scorer under this rule occur in three situations: when an infielder, pitcher, or catcher attempts to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> an unforced preceding runner who is attempting to advance one base, when any fielder attempts and fails to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> a forced preceding runner, and when any fielder attempts and fails to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> an unforced preceding runner who returns to their original base. In these situations, the official scorer is required {{to determine whether the}} batter-runner would have safely reached first base if the defense made an ordinary effort to put him out. If the defense could not be reasonably expected to make the play, the batter is credited with a hit, otherwise he is ruled to have reached by fielder's choice. If an error is made on the attempt to <b>put</b> <b>out</b> a preceding runner, that has no impact on this decision. It is instead noted to have occurred in addition to the hit or fielder's choice.|$|E

Boeing arranged to finance the purchase provided a guarantee was given by the Bangladesh government. After bureaucratic delays and a perceived lack of commitment from the government, Boeing lost interest and the plans were cancelled.
