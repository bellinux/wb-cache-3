He and Załuska kept 25 clean sheets combined, Forster racking up 21 of them. In December 2011, Hearts were awarded a controversial penalty {{in the final minute}} of a league match at Parkhead, with Celtic leading 1–0. Forster, however, <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> an excellent save from Eggert Jonsson's penalty kick to secure three important points for Celtic. In total, he kept 26 clean sheets from 47 matches that season.|$|E
5|$|In {{addition}} to Hanna-Barbera's Speed Buggy (1973) and Wonder Wheels (1977–78), the three series were commonly grouped together {{due to the}} similarities in plot and characters. Reception-wise, several critics reacted negatively to the violence and portrayal of motorcycles in the series, prompting viewers to write letters to NBC in hopes that the show would be <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> the air. Wheelie and the Chopper Bunch had a total of 13 episodes, each consisting of 3 segments, or a total of 39 segments. It has since been released on DVD as part of Warner Bros.' Archive Collection on a three disc set.|$|E
5|$|Spinks {{had moved}} to Chicago by 1896, and was {{perfecting}} his billiard chalk with Hoskins. That year he was noted for besting McLaughlin at 14.2 by a comfortable 2500–2300 margin (with averages of 11 vs. 10) in a five-evening 14.2 match for $250 (approx. $$, in modern dollars), December 8–12, in Slosson's New York City billiard hall. At one point he had trailed rather badly, 1500–1880, after McLaughlin <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> a stunning run of 140 (Spinks's highest recorded run of the match was 69).|$|E

5|$|To Sukarno, {{this sort}} of {{operation}} {{had a number of}} merits. Starting a military operation against 'imperialists' would help to bind together the antagonistic forces of the army and the Communist Party (PKI) in supporting him, while not creating a fully escalated conflagration would prevent the militarily superior British and their Commonwealth allies from using their full force. Indonesia had also <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> a successful operation using similar techniques in the West Irian campaign against the Dutch a decade previous, a raiding campaign into Western New Guinea had ended with the Dutch ceding that territory to prevent Indonesia from 'falling' to Communism.|$|E
5|$|A seventeen-year-old girl, Lisa Donovan (Alice Kremelberg), is {{declared}} brain dead at {{a hospital}} and is <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> life support. While the doctors remove her organs for donation, she suddenly comes {{back from the dead}} and yells highly classified naval missile codes. Fringe Division arrives to investigate, along with a naval officer; he tells them the codes are tied to a missing sailor called Andrew Rusk (Chazz Menendez). Lisa is unaware of the numbers or Rusk, but suddenly starts speaking Russian while Olivia (Anna Torv), Peter (Joshua Jackson), and Walter (John Noble) question her. The naval officer informs them that Rusk is fluent in the language.|$|E
5|$|After their {{fitting-out}} stage, the {{two ships}} were put through sea trials {{to ensure they}} met their contracted specifications. The first attempt at putting Michigan through a trial was conducted at the navy's traditional testing grounds off Rockland, Maine beginning on 9 June 1909. Although the ship completed its standardization run, other tests were disrupted when it ran aground on a sand bar. Although Michigan was <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> without incident, the navy soon discovered that both propellers required repair, delaying {{the completion of the}} trials until 20–24 June. The battleship was commissioned several months later on 4 January 1910—making the United States the third country to have a dreadnought in commission, behind the United Kingdom and Germany, but just ahead of Brazil's —and its shakedown cruise lasted until 7 June.|$|E

5|$|Anderson {{scored the}} first penalty in sudden death. Kalou then sent Van der Sar {{the wrong way}} to make it 5–5. Giggs was next up and he was also successful. Van der Sar then <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> the crucial save for United; he pointed to his left to {{indicate}} to Nicolas Anelka that he thought he would kick to that side, as had the six players who had kicked before him, only to correctly dive to his right to deny Anelka, whose kick was at a good height to be saved, securing European football's top prize for United {{for the third time in}} their history.|$|E
5|$|As 1997 {{turned to}} 1998, an {{inspirational}} performance from Giggs helped a modest United side labour for a hard-earned three points and still maintain {{their desire for}} a fifth title in six seasons. A trip to the Dell to play Southampton – where United were undone last season repeated itself, this time by a solitary Kevin Davies goal in the third minute. The Saints <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> a valiant performance, most notably from goalkeeper Paul Jones, who denied Solskjær from scoring right at {{the death of the}} second half. Things went from bad to worse in January as Tony Cottee popped in to stun Old Trafford and score the winner for Leicester in what proved a wretched season for the striker. This was the Foxes first win in the league since November and United's first home defeat of the season and fifth altogether.|$|E
5|$|Auriemma <b>pulled</b> <b>off</b> one of {{his biggest}} and most {{important}} early recruiting successes in 1987 when he convinced an All American from New Hampshire, Kerry Bascom, to come to UConn. Bascom had an immediate impact on the UConn program: in 1989 she won the Big East Player of the Year award as a sophomore (she also won the award in her junior and senior years) and led UConn to its first Big East regular season and Tournament title, along with its first-ever NCAA tournament appearance; the tournament ended in a first round loss. With Bascom and teammates Laura Lishness, Megan Pattyson, Wendy Davis and Debbie Baer, UConn reached the NCAA Tournament again in 1990, losing 61–59 to Clemson in the second round after a first-round bye.|$|E
