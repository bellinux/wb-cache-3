Bamboo samples of Gigantochloa atroviolacea and Phyllostachys pubescens and wood samples of Fagus sylvatica and Pinus sylvestris were inoculated with the brown-rot fungus Coniophora puteana and the white-rot fungus Schizophyllum commune. The fungi were cultured on vermiculite containing different amounts of tap water or malt extract solution. Mass loss of the bamboos after 32 weeks was low and did not show a remarkable influence of moisture content and nutrient addition. However, considerable degradation of Pinus sylvestris sapwood occurred by C. puteana whereby moisture and nutrients influenced aggressiveness...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{research}} {{was to determine the}} effect of environmental conditions (biofortification with Mg) and technological processes (freezing, <b>preserving</b> in <b>jars</b> and drying) on the content of nitrates (III) in carrot. Besides this, the amount of human intake of nitrates (III) found in the carrot products analysed was assayed. The effect on environment resulting from the changes in carrot growing technology was not so unambiguous as for nitrates (V) since most NO 2 ¯ was contained in, for example, processed foods from non-biofortified Mg material. The consumption of products was not hazardous to the consumer since it did not exceed Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) NO 2 ¯. Most nitrates (III) are consumed with dried carrot and least - with carrot <b>preserved</b> in <b>jars.</b> For this reason, one should run a thorough monitoring of the contents of nitrates (III), toxic to humans since new products based on dried carrot material, such as crisps, are launched in the consumer market...|$|R

5000|$|Danzig trams figure {{extensively}} {{in the early stages}} of Günter Grass's Die Blechtrommel (The Tin Drum). In the last chapter the novel's hero Oskar Matzerath and his friend Gottfried von Vittlar steal a tram late at night from outside Unterrath depot on the northern edge of Düsseldorf. In a surreal journey, von Vittlar drives the tram through the night, south to Flingern and Haniel and then east to the suburb of Gerresheim. Meanwhile, inside, Matzerath tries to rescue the half-blind Victor Weluhn (who had escaped from the siege of the Polish post office in Danzig at the beginning of the book and of the war) from his two green-hatted would-be executioners. Mazerath deposits his briefcase, which contains Sister Dorotea's severed ring finger in a <b>preserving</b> <b>jar,</b> on the dashboard [...] "where professional motorman put their lunchboxes". They leave the tram at the terminus and the executioners tie Weluhn to a tree in von Vittlar's mother's garden and prepare to machine-gun him. But Matzerath drums, Weluhn sings, and together they conjure up the Polish cavalry, who spirit both victim and executioners away. Matzerath asks von Vittlar to take his briefcase in the tram to the police HQ in the Fürstenwall, which he does. The latter part of this route is today served by tram route 703 terminating at Gerresheim Stadtbahn station ("by the glassworks" [...] as Grass notes, referring to the famous glass factory).|$|R
50|$|Besides public lectures, public autopsies {{have been}} {{important}} in promoting knowledge of medicine.

Public autoposies have sometimes verged on entertainment: American showman P. T. Barnum held a public autopsy of Joice Heth after her death. Heth was a woman whom Barnum had been featuring as being over 160 years old. Barnum charged 50 cents admission. The autopsy demonstrated that she had in fact been between 76 and 80 years old.|$|R
