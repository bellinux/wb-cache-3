However, {{it is not clear}} to what extent this was due to an influx of Han settlers, who were predominantly displaced young men from Zhangzhou and Quanzhou in Fujian province, or from a variety of other factors, including: frequent intermarriage between Han and aborigines, the replacement of aboriginal marriage and abortion taboos, and the widespread adoption of the Han agricultural lifestyle due to the depletion of traditional game stocks, which may have led to increased birth rates and population growth. Moreover, the acculturation of aborigines in increased numbers may have intensified the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> swell in the number of Han.|$|E
5|$|Italian folk {{styles are}} very diverse, and include monophonic, polyphonic, and responsorial song, choral, {{instrumental}} and vocal music, and other styles. Choral singing and polyphonic song forms are primarily found in northern Italy, while south of Naples, solo singing is more common, and groups usually use unison singing {{in two or}} three parts carried by a single performer. Northern ballad-singing is syllabic, with a strict tempo and intelligible lyrics, while southern styles use a rubato tempo, and a strained, tense vocal style. Folk musicians use the dialect of their own regional tradition; this rejection of the standard Italian language in folk song is nearly universal. There is little <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> common Italian folk tradition, and the country's folk music never became a national symbol.|$|E
5|$|The escape {{response}} in gastropods—the perception of stimuli (for example, {{the presence of}} a predator nearby) and a subsequent escape motion—is a frequent target of behavioural studies. In gastropods, the perception of environmental chemical stimuli originating, for example, from food or other organisms is possibly mediated by sensory organs such as the osphradium. In the case of L.canarium, the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> predator can occur through chemoreception or vision (a well-developed sense in strombid gastropods). The presence of a predator can significantly alter the movement pattern of L.canarium, inducing an increase in the frequency of leaps.|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{examined}} the relationship between dance-related perfectionism and <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> motivational climate in dance over time. In doing so, three possibilities were tested: (<b>a)</b> perfectionism affects <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the motivational climate, (b) <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> the motivational climate affect perfectionism, and (c) the relationship is reciprocal. Two hundred seventy-one young dancers (M = 14. 21 years old, SD = 1. 96) from UK Centres for Advanced Training completed questionnaires twice, approximately 6 months apart. Cross-lagged analysis indicated that perfectionistic concerns led to increased <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>an</b> ego-involving climate and decreased <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> task-involving climate over time. In addition, <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> task-involving climate led to increased perfectionistic strivings over time. The findings suggest that perfectionistic concerns may color <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> training/performing environments so that mistakes are deemed unacceptable and only superior performance is valued. They also suggest that <b>perceptions</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> task-involving climate in training/performing environments may encourage striving for excellence and perfection without promoting excessive concerns regarding their attainment...|$|R

25|$|The {{country has}} several subdivisions, mostly used for {{administrative}} or statistical purposes. Politically, Singapore {{is divided into}} five administrative districts, these are then further subdivided into town councils which usually consists {{of one or more}} political constituencies. However, unlike other countries where local government subdivisions are used to cite locations, the same practice is often uncommon in Singapore. Political boundaries fluctuate with every general election and thus, the areas they cover do not necessarily correspond to the local <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> place. Most geographical regions, districts and neighbourhoods within the city-state are usually overlapping and can sometimes be arbitrarily defined. Planning and census boundaries, called planning areas, have been used by the Urban Redevelopment Authority to define certain districts and neighbourhoods, although these boundaries may not necessarily correspond with the common <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> certain place. While boundaries for new towns do exist, there have been instances where certain neighbourhoods can be identified separately from the town it is located in. Tiong Bahru for example, is often identified separately from the HDB town it is a part of, Bukit Merah.|$|E

25|$|The {{ganzfeld}} {{was originally}} introduced into experimental psychology {{due to the}} experiments of the German psychologist Wolfgang Metzger (1899–1979) on the <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> homogenous visual field. In the early 1970s, Charles Honorton had been investigating ESP and dreams at the Maimonides Medical Center and began using the ganzfeld technique to achieve a state of sensory deprivation in which he hypothesised that psi could work. Honorton believed that by reducing the ordinary sensory input, psi conductive states may be enhanced and psi-mediated information could be transmitted.|$|E
25|$|Perceived pitch {{typically}} {{depends on}} the fundamental frequency, though the dependence could be mediated solely {{by the presence of}} harmonics corresponding to that fundamental frequency. The <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> pitch without the corresponding fundamental frequency in the physical stimulus is called the pitch of the missing fundamental. Neurons lateral to A1 in marmoset monkeys were found to be sensitive specifically to the fundamental frequency of a complex tone, suggesting that pitch constancy may be enabled by such a neural mechanism.|$|E

25|$|Gustav Fechner began {{conducting}} psychophysics {{research in}} Leipzig in the 1830s, articulating {{the principle that}} human <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> stimulus varies logarithmically according to its intensity. Fechner's 1860 Elements of Psychophysics challenged Kant's stricture against quantitative study of the mind. In Heidelberg, Hermann von Helmholtz conducted parallel research on sensory perception, and trained physiologist Wilhelm Wundt. Wundt, in turn, came to Leipzig University, establishing the psychological laboratory which brought experimental psychology to the world. Wundt focused on breaking down mental processes into the most basic components, motivated in part by an analogy to recent advances in chemistry, and its successful investigation of the elements and structure of material. Paul Flechsig and Emil Kraepelin soon created another influential psychology laboratory at Leipzig, this one focused on more on experimental psychiatry.|$|E
25|$|Extended {{consciousness}} is an animal's autobiographical self-perception. It {{is thought to}} arise in the brains of animals which have a substantial capacity for memory and reason. It does not necessarily require language. The <b>perception</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> historic and future self arises from a stream of information from the immediate environment and from neural structures related to memory. The concept was popularised by Antonio Damasio and is used in biological psychology. Extended {{consciousness is}} said to arise in structures in the human brain described as image spaces and dispositional spaces. Image spaces imply areas where sensory impressions of all types are processed, including the focused awareness of the core consciousness. Dispositional spaces include convergence zones, which are networks in the brain where memories are processed and recalled, and where knowledge is merged with immediate experience.|$|E
