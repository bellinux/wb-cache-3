40|$|The US Army`s Aberdeen Proving Ground {{has been}} a test site {{for a variety of}} munitions, {{including}} chemical warfare agents (CWA). The Pilot Plant Complex (PPC) at Aberdeen was the site of development, manufacture, storage, and disposal of CWA. Deterioration of the buildings and violations of environmental laws led to closure of the complex in 1986. Since that time, all equipment, <b>piping,</b> <b>and</b> <b>conduit</b> in the buildings have been removed. The buildings have been declared free of surface CWA contamination as a result of air sampling using the military system. However, no air sampling has been done to determine if other hazardous volatile organic compounds are present in the PPC, although a wide range of toxic and/or hazardous materials other than CWA was used in the PPC. The assumption has been that the air in the PPC is not hazardous. The purpose of this air-monitoring study was to screen the indoor air in the PPC to confirm the assumption that the air does not contain volatile organic contaminants at levels that would endanger persons in the buildings. A secondary purpose was to identify any potential sources of volatile organic contaminants that need to be monitored in subsequent sampling efforts...|$|E
40|$|Fluor Fernald, Inc. {{has been}} {{progressively}} improving Decontamination and Dismantlement (D&D) at the Department of Energy's Fernald Environmental Management Project by applying {{new technologies and}} better methodologies to the work. Demolition issues existed {{in the past that}} necessitated new or improved solutions to maintain worker safety, protect the environment and accomplish the work in a cost effective manner. Lessons learned from D&D of 80 structures has led to a systematic approach, which can be implemented in various D&D arenas. When facility production was halted, hold-up material and process residues remained in the process piping and components. Over 500, 000 pounds of material was removed by workers who completed the tasks two years ahead of schedule, $ 7 million under budget and with an excellent safety record. This success was the result of detailed planning and irdision of lessons learned as work progressed from facility to facility. Work sequences were developed that reduced airborne contamination. Demolition of structures has been performed at Fernald by carefully selected and qualified subcontractors. Asbestos and lead abatement, equipment, <b>piping</b> <b>and</b> <b>conduit</b> removal, and structural demolition have been completed to progressively higher performance specifications developed by Fluor Fernald based on lessons learned during execution. Safety continues to be the primary consideration in performing potentially hazardous work. Technologies such as hydraulic shears have been developed and used to keep workers away from danger. A new technology, ''Cool Suits,'' has been demonstrated to help prevent heat stress when anti-contamination clothing is required in elevated temperature working conditions. For tall structures, implosion technologies have been employed with progressively improved results, Several other new technologies have been evaluated by Fluor Fernald and applied by subcontractors. The improved technologies included the oxy-gas torch, which uses gasoline instead of acetylene gas, and a vacuum system for asbestos removal of wall insulation. These new methods proved effective and beneficial. Fluor Fernald has integrated demolition activities with waste disposal requirements to enhance overall efficiency. The relatively straight steel configurations required for recycling, and waste acceptance criteria that dictate waste sizes are typically included in the subcontract specifications The progressive improvements by Fluor Fernald have led to cost savings and schedule acceleration without increased risk to workers or the environment. When Fluor Fernald came to the site in 1992, the remediation baseline reflected a completion schedule of 2020 and a cost of $ 7. 2 billion. The current projection is 2008 and $ 4. 2 billion...|$|E

50|$|Dan Ladd is a Northampton, Massachusetts based American {{artist who}} works with trees and gourds. He began experimenting with glass, china, and metal {{inclusions}} in trees in 1977 in Vermont and started planting trees for Extreme Nature in 1978. He became inspired by inosculation he noticed in nature and by the growth of tree trunks around man-made objects such as fences and idle farm equipment. He shapes and grafts trees, including their fruits and their roots, into architectural and geometric forms. Ladd calls human-initiated inosculation 'pleaching' and calls his own work 'tree sculpture'. Ladd binds a variety of objects to trees, for live wood to grow around and be incorporated, including teacups, bicycle wheels, headstones, steel spheres, water <b>piping,</b> <b>and</b> electrical <b>conduit.</b> He guides roots into shapes, such as stairs, using above-ground wooden and concrete forms and even shapes woody, hard-shelled Lagenaria gourds {{by allowing them to}} grow into detailed molds. A current project at the DeCordova and Dana Museum and Sculpture Park in Lincoln, Massachusetts incorporates eleven American Liberty Elm trees grafted next to each other to form a long hillside stair banister. Another of his installations, Three Arches, consists of three pairs of 14-foot sycamore trees, which he grafted into arches to frame different city views, at Frank Curto Park in Pittsburgh.|$|R

40|$|Idaho National Laboratory (INL) Reactor Technology Complex (RTC) buried <b>piping</b> <b>and</b> {{components}} are being characterized {{to determine if}} they should be managed as hazardous waste and subject to the Hazardous Waste Management Act /Resource Conservation and Recovery Act (RCRA). RTC buried <b>piping</b> <b>and</b> components involve both active <b>piping</b> <b>and</b> components from currently operating nuclear facilities, such as the Advanced Test Reactor (ATR), and inactive lines from facilities undergoing D&D activities. The issue exists as to the proper methods to analyze and control hazards associated with D&D activities on facilities collocated with existing operating nuclear facilities, or future collocated facilities being considered with the resurgent nuclear industry. During initial characterization activities, it was determined that residual radioactive material in several inactive RTC lines and components could potentially exceed hazard category (HC) 3 thresholds. In addition, concerns were raised as to how to properly isolate active nuclear facility <b>piping</b> <b>and</b> components from those inactive lines undergoing RCRA actions, and whether the operating facility safety basis could be impacted. Work was stopped, and a potential inadequacy in the safety analysis (PISA) was declared, even though no clear safety basis existed for the inactive, abandoned lines and equipment. An unreviewed safety question (USQ) and an occurrence report resulted. A HC 3 or greater Nuclear Facility/Activity for the buried <b>piping</b> <b>and</b> components was also declared in the occurrence report. A qualitative hazard assessment was developed to evaluate the potential hazards associated with characterization activities, and any potential effects on the safety basis of the collocated RTC operating nuclear facilities. The hazard assessment clearly demonstrated the low hazards associated with the activities based on form and dispersiblity of the radioactive material in the <b>piping</b> <b>and</b> components.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{displacements}} {{of nuclear}} island buildings occur because of earthquake, thermal expansion, creep shrinkage etc. Because there are penetrations and some supports that {{connect to the}} wall of reactor building, the displacement loads must be considered when the <b>piping</b> <b>and</b> the supports are verified, the displacement loads have great effect on the <b>piping</b> <b>and</b> supports stress analysis. Studying the effect and looking for that how to reduce this effect are helpful {{to find a way to}} reduce the <b>piping</b> stress <b>and</b> the loads on the supports, and it is also helpful to make the plant safe. In this paper some piping calculation units of EPR project are showed as examples, the calculation units are done with a new software ANASYS PIPE, and finite element method is used. there are penetrations and supports that connects {{to the wall of}} reactor building in the calculation units, the building displacements due to earthquake, thermal expansion and creep shrinkage are considered, and the effect of displacement loads and the combinations of all kinds of loads under different category conditions on the <b>piping</b> <b>and</b> supports are studied, the result shows that the stress of <b>piping</b> <b>and</b> the loads on the supports caused by building displacement loads are prominent, but the <b>piping</b> <b>and</b> the supports can meet the requirement by optimizing the support concept.

40|$|Virtually all {{engineering}} applications {{involve the}} use of <b>piping,</b> <b>conduits</b> <b>and</b> channels. In the petroleum industry, piping systems are extensively employed in upstream and downstream processes. These piping systems often carry fluids that are corrosive, which leads to wear, cavitation and cracking. The replacement of damaged piping systems can be quite expensive, {{both in terms of}} capital costs, as well as in operational downtime. This motivates the present research on noninvasive healing of cracked piping systems. In this investigation, we propose to develop computational models for characterizing noninvasive repair strategies involving electromagnetically guided particles. The objective is to heal industrial-piping systems noninvasively, from the exterior of the system, during operation, resulting in no downtime, with minimal relative cost. The particle accumulation at a target location is controlled by external electro-magneto-mechanical means. There are two primary effects that play a role for guiding the particles to the solid-fluid interface/wall: mechanical shear due to the fluid flow, and an electrical or magnetic force. In this work we develop and study a relationship that characterizes contributions of both, and ascertain how this relationship scales with characteristic physical parameters. Characteristic non-dimensional parameters that describe system behavior are derived and their role in design is illustrated. A detailed, fully 3 -dimensional discrete element simulation framework is presented, and illustrated using a model problem of magnetically guided particles. The detailed particle behavior is considered to be regulated by three effects: (1) the field strength (2) the mass flow rate and (3) the wall interactions...|$|R
