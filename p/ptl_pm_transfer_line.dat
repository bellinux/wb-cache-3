The performance assessment includes the life estimation of the <b>transfer</b> <b>lines</b> {{that are used to}} transport waste between tanks both within a facility (''intra-area'' transfer) and to other facilities (''inter-area'' <b>transfers).</b> The <b>transfer</b> <b>line</b> materials of construction will initially provide a barrier to contaminant escape. However, the materials will degrade over time, most likely due to corrosion, and will no longer provide a barrier to contaminant escape. The life estimation considered the corrosion of the core pipe under exposure to soil, estimated the thickness loss due to general corrosion, and the percentage of wall area breached due to localized corrosion mechanisms. There are three types of <b>transfer</b> <b>lines</b> that are to be addressed within the performance assessment: Type I, Type II/IIA and Type III. The life of the <b>transfer</b> <b>lines</b> were estimated as exposed to soil. Localized and general corrosion of the <b>transfer</b> <b>lines</b> exposed to soil was estimated to provide input to the fate and transport modeling of the performance assessment. Pitting corrosion was found to be the controlling mechanism for the degradation of the <b>transfer</b> <b>lines</b> and their consequent ability to maintain confinement of contaminants. It is assumed that 75 % of the <b>transfer</b> <b>line</b> is needed intact to provide this confinement function, i. e. once 25 % of the line wall is breached, the lines are considered incapable of confining contaminants.

40|$|ABSTRACT: <b>Transfer</b> <b>lines</b> {{are more}} and more {{dedicated}} to producing a variety of similar products allowing some flexibility to this important class of manufacturing systems. For many decades, an important work has been done to evaluate the performance and specifically the capacity of <b>transfer</b> <b>lines.</b> However, most of these works are so far limited to the mono-product and homogeneous <b>transfer</b> <b>lines.</b> This paper analyses the performance of <b>transfer</b> <b>lines</b> composed of several machines with a serial configuration and dedicated to producing a variety of products in a batch production environment. The products are manufactured according to the real stochastic and dynamic demand characterized by random product arrivals and random lot sizing. The considered <b>transfer</b> <b>lines</b> have no intermediate buffers between adjacent machines. Machines have different deterministic processing times and are subject to random operationdependent failures.

Bench scale testing focused on the effect the <b>transfer</b> <b>line</b> has on the rheological property of the grout as it was processed through the <b>transfer</b> <b>line.</b> Rheological and other physical properties of grout samples were obtained prior to and after pumping through a <b>transfer</b> <b>line.</b> The Bench Scale Mixing Rig (BSMR) consisted of two mixing tanks, grout feed tank, transfer pump and transfer hose. The mixing tanks were used to batch the grout which was then transferred into the grout feed tank. The contents of the feed tank were then pumped through the <b>transfer</b> <b>line</b> (hose) using a progressive cavity pump. The grout flow rate and pump discharge pressure were monitored. Four sampling stations were located {{along the length of}} the <b>transfer</b> <b>line</b> at the 5, 105 and 205 feet past the transfer pump and at 305 feet, the discharge of the hose. Scaling between the full scale piping at Saltstone to bench scale testing at SRNL was performed by maintaining the same shear rate and total shear at the wall of the <b>transfer</b> <b>line.</b> The results of scaling down resulted in a shorter <b>transfer</b> <b>line,</b> a lower average velocity, the same transfer time and similar pressure drops. The condition of flow in the bench scale <b>transfer</b> <b>line</b> is laminar. The flow in the full scale pipe is in the transition region, but is more laminar than turbulent. The resulting plug in laminar flow in the bench scale results in a region of no-mixing. Hence mixing, or shearing, at the bench scale should be less than that observed in the full scale, where this plug is non existent due to the turbulent flow. The bench scale tests should be considered to be conservative due to the highly laminar condition of flow that exists. Two BSMR runs were performed. In both cases, wall shearing was shown to reduce the rheological properties of the grout as it was processed through the <b>transfer</b> <b>line.</b> Samples taken at the static feed tank showed that gelling impacted the rheological properties of the grout before it was fed into the pump and <b>transfer</b> <b>line.</b> A comparison of the rheological properties of samples taken at the feed tank and <b>transfer</b> <b>line</b> discharge indicated shearing of the grout was occurring in the <b>transfer</b> <b>line.</b> Bench scale testing of different mixing methods with three different salt solutions showed that method of mixing influences the rheological properties of the grouts. The paddle blade mixing method of the salt solution used for the BMSR testing provided comparable rheological properties of the grout prepared in the BMSR after 14 minutes of processing, B 3. The paddle blade mixing method can be used to represent BMSR results and mixing time can be adjusted to represent larger scale mixing...|$|R

40|$|Serial {{production}} lines {{are widely used}} in production systems. Balancing the capacities {{of a group of}} machines and connecting them by a common transfer mechanism constitutes a <b>transfer</b> <b>line.</b> Generally, the term <b>transfer</b> <b>line</b> represents a synchronized serial production line where the output from each production stage is equal to the output of the line. Because the stages are tightly linked together, loss of production due to breakdowns or defective items at any stage can temporarily stop the entire <b>line.</b> Consequently, <b>transfer</b> <b>lines</b> often have low efficiences. However, efficiency can be increased by adding safety inventories to decouple the stages. This paper presents a model and procedures for determining the safety inventories needed at each stage to assure that a prespecified <b>transfer</b> <b>line</b> efficiency is met and that the minimum amount of safety inventory is used.

40|$|The chilldown {{of fluid}} <b>transfer</b> <b>lines</b> is an {{important}} part of using cryogenic systems such as those found in both ground and space based applications. The chilldown process is a complex combination of both thermal and fluid transient phenomena. A cryogenic liquid flows through a <b>transfer</b> <b>line</b> that is initially at a much higher temperature than the cryogen. Transient heat transfer processes between the liquid and <b>transfer</b> <b>line</b> cause vaporization of the liquid, and this phase change can cause transient pressure and flow surges in the liquid. As the <b>transfer</b> <b>line</b> is cooled, these effects diminish until the liquid reaches a steady flow condition in the chilled <b>transfer</b> <b>line.</b> If these transient phenomena are not properly accounted for in the design process of a cryogenic system, it can lead to damage or failure of system components during operation. For such cases, analytical modeling is desirable for ensuring that a cryogenic system <b>transfer</b> <b>line</b> design is adequate for handling the effects of a chilldown process. The purpose of this paper is to present the results of a numerical model developed using Generalized Fluid System Simulation Program (GFSSP) 's new fluid transient capability in combination with its previously developed thermal transient capability to predict pressure and flow surge in cryogenic <b>transfer</b> <b>lines</b> during a chilldown process.
