2500|$|The {{mathematics}} examination in the PSLE {{is often}} {{one of its}} most distinctive elements due to its format and style in contrast to most other examinations in other countries. The examination is 2 hours and 30 minutes long, and is divided into three booklets. Paper 1 includes Booklet A and Booklet B (50 minutes) while Paper 2 (1 hour and 40 minutes) is in one whole booklet itself. Booklet A is multiple choice and consists of fifteen questions, the first ten being one point each in score value, and the other five being two points, and account for 20% of the examination score in total. Booklet B requires open-ended input, and comprises 15 questions, the first ten questions are worth one point and the other five questions are worth two points. They usually require little effort from the students and are meant to test individual knowledge components of the student. Paper 2 is worth a total of 60 points, and consists of several questions. The first five are worth 2 points and the following 13 questions are worth 3-5 points each.

2500|$|Although Shanghai and Hong Kong {{regularly}} perform highly {{in international}} assessments, Chinese education has both native and international detractors; common areas of criticism include its rigor; {{its emphasis on}} memorization and standardized testing; and the gap in quality of education between students of rural and urban areas. Jonathan Kaiman of The Guardian writes that Chinese <b>parents</b> <b>and</b> <b>educators</b> [...] "see their own system as corrupt, dehumanising, pressurised and unfair"; {{he went on to}} discuss the country's college admission exam (called the gaokao), writing that [...] "many parents consider the gruelling nine-hour test a sorting mechanism that will determine the trajectory of their children's lives." [...] In The New York Times, Helen Gao called China's educational system [...] "cutthroat" [...] and wrote that its positive reputation among admirers is largely built on a myth: While China has phenomenally expanded basic education for its people, quadrupling its output of college graduates in the past decade, it has also created a system that discriminates against its less wealthy and well-connected citizens, thwarting social mobility at every step with bureaucratic and financial barriers. A huge gap in educational opportunities between students from rural areas and those from cities {{is one of the main}} culprits. Some 60 million students in rural schools are 'left-behind' children, cared for by their grandparents as their parents seek work in faraway cities. While many of their urban peers attend schools equipped with state-of-the-art facilities and well-trained teachers, rural students often huddle in decrepit school buildings and struggle to grasp advanced subjects such as English and chemistry amid a dearth of qualified instructors. 'Rural students stand virtually no chance when competing academically with their urban counterparts,' Jiang Nengjie, a friend and independent filmmaker who made a documentary on the left-behind children, told me. In The Chronicle of Higher Education, Lara Farrar argued that the disabled are [...] "shortchanged" [...] in Chinese schools, with very little chance of acceptance into higher educational institutions.|$|E
