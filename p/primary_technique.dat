6000|$|Speaking for myself, {{with the}} immodesty {{required}} {{of one who}} hazards an introduction to his own work, I was writing fiction for five years before I could master even its <b>primary</b> <b>technique,</b> much less achieve that union of seer with thing seen, which perhaps begins to show itself a little in this volume--binding up the scanty harvests of 1899, 1900, and 1901--especially in the tales: [...] "A Knight," [...] and [...] "Salvation of a Forsyte." [...] Men, women, trees, and works of fiction--very tiny are the seeds from which they spring. I used really to see the [...] "Knight"--in 1896, was it?--sitting in the [...] "Place" [...] {{in front of the}} Casino at Monte Carlo; and because his dried-up elegance, his burnt straw hat, quiet courtesy of attitude, and big dog, used to fascinate and intrigue me, I began to imagine his life so as to answer my own questions and to satisfy, I suppose, the mood I was in. I never spoke to him, I never saw him again. His real story, no doubt, was as different from that which I wove around his figure as night from day.|$|E

50|$|The <b>primary</b> <b>technique</b> of beatrhyming {{is singing}} or {{speaking}} rhyming lyrics while simultaneously,imitating drum beats {{with the voice}} and lips. It can also involve techniques such as vocal scratching the spoken or sung lyrics, making vocal sound effects relevant to the lyrics, and instrument mimicry. It can be improvised, pre-written, or covering a popular song.|$|E
50|$|Chigiri-e (ちぎり絵) is a Japanese {{art form}} in which the <b>primary</b> <b>technique</b> uses {{coloured}} paper that is torn to create images, and may resemble a water colour painting.

50|$|The filial {{imprinting}} {{of birds}} was a <b>primary</b> <b>technique</b> {{used to create}} the movie Winged Migration (Le Peuple Migrateur), which contains {{a great deal of}} footage of migratory birds in flight. The birds imprinted on handlers, who wore yellow jackets and honked horns constantly. The birds were then trained to fly along with a variety of aircraft, primarily ultralights.|$|E
50|$|The {{most common}} NMR {{techniques}} used when discriminating chiral compounds are 1H-NMR, 19F-NMR and 13C-NMR. 1H-NMR is the <b>primary</b> <b>technique</b> {{used to assign}} absolute configuration. 19F-NMR is almost exclusive applied to optical purity studies, and 13C-NMR is primarily used to characterize substrates {{that do not have}} protons that are directly bonded to an asymmetrical carbon atom.|$|E
50|$|For {{hydrocarbon}} exploration, MT {{is mainly}} {{used as a}} complement to the <b>primary</b> <b>technique</b> of reflection seismology exploration. While seismic imaging is able to image subsurface structure, it cannot detect the changes in resistivity associated with hydrocarbons and hydrocarbon-bearing formations. MT does detect resistivity variations in subsurface structures, which can differentiate between structures bearing hydrocarbons {{and those that do}} not.|$|E
5000|$|Any {{combination}} of layers, in any color, {{is possible to}} achieve whatever ends the printer desires.There are two <b>primary</b> <b>techniques</b> used in carbon printing: single transfer and double transfer.

50|$|Because of the {{extremely}} low temperatures, diagnosing the chemical status {{is a major}} issue when studying low temperature physics and chemistry. The <b>primary</b> <b>techniques</b> in use today are optical - many types of spectroscopy are available, but these require special apparatus with vacuum windows that provide room temperature access to cryogenic processes.|$|R
50|$|A {{growing trend}} {{in the world of}} {{elemental}} analysis has revolved around the speciation, or determination of oxidation state of certain metals such as chromium and arsenic. One of the <b>primary</b> <b>techniques</b> to achieve this is to separate the chemical species with high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) or field flow fractionation (FFF) and then measure the concentrations with ICP-MS.|$|R

5000|$|Restoration is the [...] "returning of the {{existing}} fabric of a place to a known earlier state by removing accretions or by reassembling existing components without {{the introduction of new}} material." [...] The biggest difficulty in this technique is the lack of introducing new material.

50|$|The Blaschkas' <b>primary</b> <b>technique</b> was lampworking, {{in which}} glass is melted over a flame fed by air from a foot-powered bellows, then shaped using tools to pinch, pull or cut; forms were blown as well.

30|$|This {{assessment}} {{shows that}} covert euthanasia by individual doctors {{is quite different}} — in terms of available methods for reducing outrage — to the Nazi T 4 programme. The <b>primary</b> <b>techniques</b> available to individual doctors are cover-up and reinterpretation. Without the backing of a powerful institution, such as the Nazi state, other methods of reducing outrage are unavailable or of limited assistance.|$|R
30|$|Different {{techniques}} have been employed {{to solve problems}} relating to facility location. The p-median problem is typically formulated as an integer program (IP). Enumeration and heuristics methods were the <b>primary</b> <b>techniques</b> which are proposed to solve this problem.
