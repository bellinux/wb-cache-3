25|$|Business <b>Process</b> <b>Reengineering</b> (BPR) {{began as}} a private sector {{technique}} to help organizations fundamentally rethink how they do their work in order to dramatically improve customer service, cut operational costs, and become world-class competitors. A key stimulus for re-engineering has been the continuing development and deployment of sophisticated information systems and networks. Leading organizations are becoming bolder in using this technology to support innovative business processes, rather than refining current ways of doing work.|$|E
25|$|Re-engineering {{recognizes that}} an organization's {{business}} processes are usually fragmented into sub-processes and {{tasks that are}} carried out by several specialized functional areas within the organization. Often, no one {{is responsible for the}} overall performance of the entire <b>process.</b> <b>Reengineering</b> maintains that optimizing the performance of sub-processes can result in some benefits, but cannot yield dramatic improvements if the process itself is fundamentally inefficient and outmoded. For that reason, re-engineering focuses on re-designing the process as a whole in order to achieve the greatest possible benefits to the organization and their customers. This drive for realizing dramatic improvements by fundamentally re-thinking how the organization's work should be done distinguishes the re-engineering from process improvement efforts that focus on functional or incremental improvement.|$|E
25|$|Flourishing in {{the late}} 19th and early 20th century, {{scientific}} management built on earlier pursuits of economic efficiency. While it was prefigured in the folk wisdom of , it favored empirical methods to determine efficient procedures rather than perpetuating established traditions. Thus {{it was followed by}} a profusion of successors in applied science, including time and motion study, the Efficiency Movement (which was a broader cultural echo of scientific management's impact on business managers specifically), Fordism, operations management, operations research, industrial engineering, management science, manufacturing engineering, logistics, business process management, business <b>process</b> <b>reengineering,</b> lean manufacturing, and Six Sigma. There is a fluid continuum linking scientific management with the later fields, and the different approaches often display a high degree of compatibility.|$|E

This thesis examines the reengineering {{of the travel}} management system {{and implementation of the}} Defense Travel System at the Naval Postgraduate School. A review of the <b>reengineering</b> <b>process</b> with different goals and principles is provided as background for understanding the <b>reengineering</b> <b>process.</b> Also, the <b>reengineering</b> <b>process</b> and private sector travel systems are reviewed. Eight steps for reengineering the travel system and a model for the travel system are then proposed. This is followed by a historical overview of the travel <b>reengineering</b> <b>process</b> at the Naval Postgraduate School, a Defense Travel System test site, for designing a new travel system.

2500|$|Business <b>process</b> <b>reengineering</b> (BPR) is the {{practice}} of rethinking and redesigning the way work is done to better support an organization's mission and reduce costs. Reengineering starts with a high-level assessment of the organization's mission, strategic goals, and customer needs. Basic questions are asked, such as [...] "Does our mission need to be redefined? Are our strategic goals aligned with our mission? Who are our customers?" [...] An organization may find that it is operating on questionable assumptions, particularly {{in terms of the}} wants and needs of its customers. Only after the organization rethinks what it should be doing, does it go on to decide how best to do it.|$|E
2500|$|Many {{unsuccessful}} BPR attempts {{may have}} been due to the confusion surrounding BPR, and how it should be performed. [...] Organizations were well aware that changes needed to be made, but did not know which areas to change or how to change them. [...] As a result, <b>process</b> <b>reengineering</b> is a management concept that has been formed by trial and error or, in other words, practical experience. As more and more businesses reengineer their processes, knowledge of what caused the successes or failures is becoming apparent. [...] To reap lasting benefits, companies must be willing to examine how strategy and reengineering complement each other by learning to quantify strategy in terms of cost, milestones, and timetables, by accepting ownership of the strategy throughout the organization, by assessing the organization’s current capabilities and process realistically, and by linking strategy to the budgeting process. [...] Otherwise, BPR is only a short-term efficiency exercise.|$|E
