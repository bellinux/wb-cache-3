MEMS devices are often inherently sensitive to stress induced by their packages and often need {{direct access to}} the environment. Therefor, understanding the influence of packaging on MEMS is critical to a successful coupled package-device co-design. Here, an automated package-device interaction simulator has been developed. The simulator uses Finite Element Method models for both the package and the device analysis and ties the results of the simulations together through parametric models. This so called Compact Model Extraction is an efficient way to solve complex problems. Several examples illustrate the use of this technique...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of evolutionary algorithms (EAs) requires {{as a basic}} design decision {{the choice of a}} suitable representation of the variable space and appro-priate genetic operators.

In this connection it attracts attention that hardly any formal requirements on the genetic operators are stated. In this article we rst formalize the representation problem and then pro-pose a <b>package</b> of <b>requirements</b> to guide the design of genetic operators. By the denition of distance measures on the geno- and phenotype space it is pos-sible to integrate problem-specic knowledge into the genetic operators.

40|$|Optocoupler is a {{semiconductor}} device that allows signal {{to be transferred}} between circuits, while keeping the circuits electrically isolated from each other. The demand of surface mount Optocoupler packaging has progressed from a conventional Dual-in-line packaging (DIP) to Small outline packaging (SOP) to miniflat packaging (MFP) and to Ball Grid Array Packaging (BGA) for Optocoupler. This innovative design employs the use of premolded lead frame technology offering thinner and smaller package structure. The need to maintain a consistent interconnect dispense material at die attach is very critical to attain a reliable adhesion of the epoxy to the die and to the substrate. Stamping or pin transfer approach was qualified as a die attach dispense system.
