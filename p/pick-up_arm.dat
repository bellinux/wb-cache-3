5000|$|In 1959 Alastair Robertson-Aikman, the Company's founder, {{required}} a <b>pick-up</b> <b>arm</b> {{for his own}} use and an experimental model was built. It received such an enthusiastic reception from friends in the sound industry that {{it was decided to}} produce it commercially and the first SME precision <b>pick-up</b> <b>arm</b> appeared in September 1959. Production was 25 units per week composed entirely of individually machined components. At this time a new factory situated in Mill Road, Steyning was opened and the Company's name was changed to SME Limited, a less committal title to suit its new activities.new company MD july 2016 ...|$|E
5000|$|With vinyl records, {{there will}} be some loss in {{fidelity}} on each playing of the disc. This is due to the wear of the stylus in contact with the record surface. A good quality stylus, matched with a correctly set up <b>pick-up</b> <b>arm,</b> should cause minimal surface wear. Magnetic tapes, both analog and digital, wear from friction between the tape and the heads, guides, {{and other parts of the}} tape transport as the tape slides over them. The brown residue deposited on swabs during cleaning of a tape machine's tape path is actually particles of magnetic coating shed from tapes. Tapes can also suffer creasing, stretching, and frilling of the edges of the plastic tape base, particularly from low-quality or out-of-alignment tape decks. When a CD is played, there is no physical contact involved, and the data is read optically using a laser beam. Therefore, no such media deterioration takes place, and the CD will, with proper care, sound exactly the same every time it is played (discounting aging of the player and CD itself); however, this is a benefit of the optical system, not of digital recording, and the Laserdisc format enjoys the same non-contact benefit with analog optical signals. Recordable CDs slowly degrade with time, called disc rot, even if they are not played, and are stored properly. [...] A new compact disc was released called M-DISC which is said to last 1000 years. These discs are recordable and have a layer developed from stone. They come in CD, DVD and Blu-ray formats and various storage sizes. They can be used for music movies and data for computers etc.|$|E

5000|$|The Club at {{that stage}} was also selling mini hi-fi systems which ranged in price from $355 to $608. These were {{assembled}} for them in Australia by Bang and Olufsen, a Danish company. The quality components used included Labcraft turntables, B&O <b>pick-up</b> <b>arms,</b> B&O amplifiers and Beovox speakers.|$|R
5000|$|The Decca International tone arm: The Decca International tone {{arms were}} fluid-damped unipivot designs. They were {{designed}} to complement the Decca phono cartridges. They would enjoy a brief renaissance {{in the 21st century}} as they were almost a drop-in replacement for the <b>pick-up</b> <b>arms</b> of Lenco GL75 record turntables from the 1970s. The arm damping was via a viscous silicone fluid held in a well, and magnetic repelling force supported the arm, and provided anti-skate (bias compensation). New Old Stock arms rapidly sold out by 2008 as vintage hifi enthusiasts sought them for refurbishment projects.|$|R
5000|$|In 1969 {{this system}} was {{decommissioned}} {{and replaced by}} a machine {{that looked like a}} record player with three <b>pick-up</b> <b>arms.</b> The speaking clock was now much more accurate, telling the time at 10 second intervals followed by a beep, indicating the precise moment. The text was spoken by actress Willie Brill and had the following format: [...] "Bij de volgende toon is het [...]. uur, [...]. minuten en [...]. seconden" [...] (at the following tone, it is [...]. hour, [...]. minutes and [...]. seconds). The service was now called over 130 million times a year.|$|R
50|$|On June 8, a U.S. F-15E {{aircraft}} {{shot down}} a drone while other U.S. aircraft destroyed two <b>armed</b> <b>pick-up</b> trucks belonging to pro-government forced that moved near U.S. backed fighters at Al-Tanf.|$|R
50|$|On 7 July, state-controlled {{news agency}} SANA {{reported}} that regime forces clashed with a rebel {{group in the}} al-Sheik Yassin neighborhood, inflicting heavy losses on the rebels. Among the killed were Omar al-To'ma and Qusai Abdul-Majd al-Ani. Four <b>armed</b> <b>pick-up</b> trucks belonging to the rebels were also destroyed during the clash.|$|R
5000|$|Lise's {{role was}} to be a courier and liaison officer on the SCIENTIST network, {{communicating}} with the Prosper - PHYSICIAN network under Francis Suttill and the BRICKLAYER network under France Antelme, with the mission [...] "to form a new circuit and to provide a centre where agents could go with complete security for material help and information on local details" [...] and to organise the <b>pick-up</b> of <b>arms</b> drops from the UK to assist the French resistance. She was effectively reproducing in Poitiers what Virginia Hall had created in Lyons. Lise used a number of code names (including [...] "Odile", [...] "Irene", [...] "Marguerite" [...] and [...] "Adele"). Her cover story was that she was a poor widow from Paris, Madame Irene Brisse, seeking refuge from the tension of life in the capital and to avoid the food shortages of the capital. She moved into an apartment on a busy street near the Gestapo HQ, and became acquainted with the Gestapo chief, Herr Grabowski.|$|R
50|$|The {{following}} day, the French military launched Opération Serval, {{intervening in}} the conflict. According to analysts, the French {{were forced to}} act sooner than planned because {{of the importance of}} Sévaré military airport, located 60 km south of Konna, for further operations. The operation included the use of Gazelle helicopters from the Special forces, which stopped an Islamist column advancing to Mopti, and the use of four Mirage 2000-D jets of the Armée de l'Air operating from a base in Chad. 12 targets were hit by the Mirages during the night between the 11th and the 12th. The French chief of army staff, Édouard Guillaud, announced that the Islamists had withdrawn from Konna and retreated several dozen of kilometres into the north. The air strikes reportedly destroyed half a dozen Islamist <b>armed</b> <b>pick-up</b> trucks and a rebel command center. One French pilot, Lieutenant Damien Boiteux, was killed after his attack helicopter was downed by ground fire during the operation.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to develop an {{original}} friction loaded ergometer allowing measurement of the resisting torque (Mb) and the angular velocity (omega) by means of a force transducer and an optical <b>pick-up</b> during all-out <b>arm</b> cranking exercises. Taking into account the kinetic energy variations of the flywheel, the peak power developed at the crank (P(c) peak) and the peak angular velocity (omegapeak) were determined in 6 male and 6 female able-bodied subjects during 6 - 8 bouts of 3 s duration, performed at maximal velocity, with Mb varying from 0. 07 to 0. 87 Nm x kg(- 1). In each subject, the Mb increase was related to a decrease of omegapeak. This relationship was expressed through a negative linear regression (0. 92 < R 2 < 0. 99) for omegapeak between 13 and 28 rad x s(- 1) for the males and 10 and 24 rad x s(- 1) for the females. The relationship between P(c) peak and Mb did not fit well for all subjects (0. 01 < R 2 < 0. 93) with a parabolic equation, indicating that for upper limb testing, the maximal power should be defined as the highest power measured during several bouts performed with appropriate resisting torque. The present study also demonstrated the importance of taking into account the inertia of the moving flywheel during the acceleration phase of an all-out arm crank exercise, when determining the peak power output...|$|R
50|$|The Islamists' {{capture of}} Konna and {{offensive}} in Southern Mali triggered {{the framework of}} a French military intervention in Mali in support of the Malian government. The rebels were reported to have no viable interest in the town of Konna besides blocking the path of the Malian Army to the cities of Sévaré and Mopti. Therefore, 500 Islamists were reported to have reinforced the rebel force occupying Konna to prepare for the offensive. The Malian army holding up in Sévaré also prepared for the worst, during the day receiving 300 red-beret soldiers of the 33 Paratrooper-Regiment supported by 20 light-armored vehicles. On 11 January, French Aérospatiale Gazelle helicopters armed with 20 mm cannons from the Special forces (4th Special Forces Helicopter Regiment?) stopped the Islamist column advancing to Mopti. Four Mirage 2000-D jets operating from a base in Chad also conducted airstrikes. 12 targets were hit by the Mirages during the night between the 11th and the 12th. The French chief of army staff, Admiral Guillaud, announced that the Islamists had withdrawn from Konna and retreated several dozen kilometres to the north. The air strikes reportedly destroyed half a dozen Islamist <b>armed</b> <b>pick-up</b> trucks and a rebel command centre. One French co-pilot, Lieutenant Damien Boiteux, was killed after his attack helicopter was hit by ground fire during the operation. The pilot managed to fly the Gazelle helicopter back to base where it was later written off as lost, due to the damaged it sustained.|$|R
