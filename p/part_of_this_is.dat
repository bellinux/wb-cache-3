5|$|A {{number of}} health and medical {{research}} advocates, such as the Society for Women's Health Research in the United States, support this broader definition, rather than merely issues specific to human female anatomy to include areas where biological sex differences {{between women and men}} exist. Women also need health care more and access the health care system more than do men. While <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> due to their reproductive and sexual health needs, they also have more chronic non-reproductive health issues such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, mental illness, diabetes and osteoporosis. Another important perspective is realising that events across the entire life cycle (or life-course), from in utero to aging effect the growth, development and health of women. The life-course perspective {{is one of the key}} strategies of the World Health Organization.|$|E

25|$|It is {{believed}} that during his rule, Banda accumulated at least US$320million in personal assets, thought to be invested in everything from agriculture to mining interests in South Africa. The most controversial <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the suspicion that his two grandchildren, who currently reside in the US and South Africa, are the heirs to the Banda fortune. One of the grandchildren graduated from law school and left for the US, while the other remains in South Africa.|$|E
25|$|For much of {{the colonial}} period, the state (then an intendencia or province) was {{relatively}} isolated with few roads {{and other forms of}} communication. Most politics and social issues were strictly on the local level. Despite Spanish domination, the indigenous peoples of Oaxaca have maintained {{much of the}}ir culture and identity, more so than most other places in Mexico. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> due to the geography of the land, making many communities isolated.|$|E

In Bogota, Colombia, this could take place at weights around 1000g, with oxygen cylinders for home use; the reason was that overcrowding in their hospital meant that three babies in an incubator would result in potentially lethal cross-infections. An essential <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that there is close follow-up, and access to daily visits.|$|E

25|$|Excavations {{revealed}} that the area was used as farmland in the Medieval times. Archaeological excavations at the City Park Gate site revealed soil {{that had been used}} on farms.

25|$|Another early poetry collection/genre is the Chu Ci (dated to the Warring States period about 475–221 BCE), {{which is}} typified by various line lengths and the imagery and {{influence}} of the vernacular associated {{with the state of}} Chu, in southern China. One important <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the Li Sao, attributed to Qu Yuan. These poems from the State of Chu are among the most important of all Classical Chinese poetry, however, these poems and their style seem to have had less impact on Classical Chinese poetry, at least at first, than did the Shijing collection and style.|$|E
25|$|Despite a {{rough terrain}} and a harsh climate, Sonora, {{like the rest}} of the {{northern}} Mexico, is rich in mineral resources. This has led to a history of self-reliance, and many see themselves as the heirs to a pioneering tradition. A large <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> linked to the vaquero or cowboy tradition, as much of the state’s economy has traditionally been linked to livestock. Sonorans and other norteños (northerners) have a reputation for being hard working and frugal, and being more individualistic and straightforward than other Mexicans. Although most people in the state are employed in industry and tourism, the trappings of the cowboy, jeans, cowboy hats and pickup trucks, are still very popular.|$|E

25|$|The {{main road}} in Embrun is Notre-Dame Street (County Road 3). This busy street travels east–west across Embrun, linking its neighbourhoods together. At its western end it connects to Castor Street in {{neighbouring}} Russell, while its eastern end {{travels to the}} nearby village of Casselman, located 12km to the east. As Embrun grows, the street has experienced significant congestion. <b>Part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> aggravated by the fact that, {{with the exception of}} a 1km section in western Embrun which has a centre turning lane, the street is still a conventional two lane street. The municipality has studied the possibility of widening the entire stretch of the street to two lanes in each direction with a centre turning lane, however the cost of this is seen as prohibitive, so instead, the municipality has focused on projects to make traffic flow more efficient. This included the upgrading of intersections, including the installation of new left-turn signals at two intersections (completed in 2011) and the replacement of another intersection with a roundabout (completed in 2012).|$|E
25|$|The Prime Minister nominates the Cabinet, {{traditionally}} {{drawn from}} members of the same political party or parties in the Storting, making up the government. The PM organises the executive government and exercises its power as vested by the Constitution. Reflecting its monarchical past, Norway was established under the Lutheran Church of Norway, and was the state church until 2012. Formerly, the PM had to have more than half the members of Cabinet be members of the Church of Norway, meaning at least ten out of the 19 ministries. This rule was however removed in 2012. The issue of {{separation of church and state}} in Norway has been increasingly controversial, as many people believe it is time to change this, to reflect the growing diversity in the population. A <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> the evolution of the public school subject Christianity, a required subject since 1739. Even the state's loss in a battle at the European Court of Human Rights at Strasbourg in 2007 did not settle the matter. As of 1 January 2017, the Church of Norway is a separate legal entity, and no longer a branch of the civil service.|$|E
25|$|The team {{wanted to}} capture the aspect of BioShock where not every non-player {{character}} would immediately be aggressive towards you; Levine discusses a situation in Infinite where the player character walks into a crowded bar and cannot immediately tell the disposition of the non-player characters towards the player. Levine compared this {{to the introduction of}} the Big Daddy in BioShock, giving the player several opportunities to view but not engage the characters so they would understand that there are several possible outcomes depending on what approach they used when they did have the ability to engage one. As Infinite contains numerous groups in internal conflict with each other, the player will {{be given the opportunity to}} learn how to utilize different non-player character agents to progress in the game. Irrational wanted to make sure consequences of the player's actions were reflected in the game; <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> through the strain on Elizabeth when using her powers, but through altering the suspended city, they are able to change the environment in response to the player's choice and force the player to consider different tactics.|$|E

The impoverished state provides ample recruits for the communist insurgents, who argue that they are fighting on behalf of the landless poor that see few benefits from the resource extractions. As the federal government holds a monopoly on sub-surface resources in the state, the tribal population is prevented from staking any claim on the resources extracted from their land. In response, the insurgents have recently begun a campaign of targeting infrastructure related to the extraction of resources vital for Indian energy needs, such as coal.|$|E
2500|$|On May 15, 1939, Antonina Pirozhkova {{was awakened}} by four NKVD agents {{pounding}} upon the door of their Moscow apartment.

According to Pirozhkova: [...] "In the car, {{one of the men}} sat in back with Babel and me while the other one sat in front with the driver. 'The worst <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> that my mother won't be getting my letters', and then he was silent for a long time. I could not say a single word. Babel asked the secret policeman sitting next to him, 'So I guess you don't get too much sleep, do you?' And he even laughed. As we approached Moscow, I said to Babel, 'I'll be waiting for you, it will be as if you've gone to Odessa... only there won't be any letters....' He answered, 'I ask you to see that the child not be made miserable.' [...] "But I don't know what my destiny will be." [...] At this point, the man sitting beside Babel said to me, [...] "We have no claims whatsoever against you." [...] We drove to the Lubyanka Prison and through the gates.
