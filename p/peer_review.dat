The six types of aerodrome are described, in size order, as: regional airports (e.g. East Midlands); major GA airports (e.g. Oxford); developed GA airfields (e.g. Andrewsfield); basic GA airfields (e.g. Rufforth); developed airstrips (e.g. Tilstock); and basic airstrips (e.g. Chilbolton in Hampshire). The actual criteria used to categorise aerodromes were complex, using 28 different parameters, backed up with a <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> by experienced GA pilots.|$|E

The first <b>Peer</b> <b>Review</b> Congress met in 1989. Over time, the fraction of papers devoted to <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> has steadily declined, suggesting that as a field of sociological study, it has been replaced by more systematic studies of bias and errors. In parallel with 'common experience' definitions based on the study of <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> as a 'pre-constructed process', some social scientists have looked at <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> without considering it as pre-constructed. Hirschauer proposed that journal <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> can be understood as reciprocal accountability of judgements among peers. Gaudet proposed that journal <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> could be understood as a social form of boundary judgement - determining what can be considered as scientific (or not) set against an overarching knowledge system, and following predecessor forms of inquisition and censorship.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a specially developed online peer-review system, the Peer Portal, {{and the first}} results of its use for quality enhancement of bachelor’s and master’s thesis manuscripts. The peer-review system is completely student driven and therefore saves time for supervisors and creates a direct interaction between students without interference from supervisors. The purpose is to improve thesis manuscript quality, and thereby use supervisor time more efficiently, since <b>peers</b> <b>review</b> basic aspects of the manuscripts and give constructive suggestions for improvements. The process was initiated in 2012, and, in total, 260 <b>peer</b> <b>reviews</b> were completed between 1 st January and 15 th May, 2012. All <b>peer</b> <b>reviews</b> for this period have been analyzed {{with the help of}} content analysis. The purpose of analysis is to assess the quality of the students work. The results are categorized in four groups: 1) excellent (18. 1 %), 2) good (22. 7 %), 3) fragmented (18. 5 %), and 4) poor (40. 7 %). The overall result shows that almost 40 % of the students produced excellent or good <b>peer</b> <b>reviews</b> and almost as many produced poor <b>peer</b> <b>reviews.</b> The result shows that the quality varies considerably. Explanations of these quality variations need further study. However, alternative hypotheses followed by some strategic suggestions are discussed in this study. Finally, a way forward in terms of improving <b>peer</b> <b>reviews</b> is outlined: 1) development of a peer wizard system and 2) rating of received <b>peer</b> <b>reviews</b> based on the quality categories created in this study. A Peer Portal version 2. 0 is suggested, which will eliminate the fragmented and poor quality <b>peer</b> <b>reviews,</b> but still keep this review system student driven and ensure autonomous learning...|$|R

25|$|Scholarly <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> (also {{known as}} refereeing) {{is the process}} of {{subjecting}} an author's scholarly work, research, or ideas to the scrutiny of others who are experts in the same field, before a paper describing this work is published in a journal or as a book. The <b>peer</b> <b>review</b> helps the publisher (that is, the editor-in-chief or the editorial board) decide whether the work should be accepted, considered acceptable with revisions, or rejected. <b>Peer</b> <b>review</b> requires a community of experts in a given (and often narrowly defined) field, who are qualified and able to perform reasonably impartial review. Impartial review, especially of work in less narrowly defined or inter-disciplinary fields, may be difficult to accomplish, and the significance (good or bad) of an idea may never be widely appreciated among its contemporaries. <b>Peer</b> <b>review</b> is generally considered necessary to academic quality and is used in most major scientific journals, but it does by no means prevent publication of all invalid research.
