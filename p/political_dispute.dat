5|$|Founded in 681 as a pagan state, Bulgaria was {{formally}} Christianised by Byzantine clergy in the 860s, under Prince Boris (r. 852–889).

5|$|Griffin {{designed}} the lake with many geometric motifs, {{so that the}} axes of his design lined up with natural geographical landmarks in the area. However, government authorities changed his original plans and no substantial work was completed before he left Australia in 1920. His scheme remained unfulfilled as the Great Depression and World War II intervened, {{and it was not}} until the 1950s that planning resumed. After much <b>political</b> <b>dispute</b> over several proposed variations, excavation work began in 1960 with the energetic backing of Prime Minister Robert Menzies. After the completion of the bridges and dams, the dams were locked in September 1963. However, a drought meant that the target water level was not reached until April 1964.

5|$|In 1517, Martin Luther, an Augustinian friar in Germany, {{sent his}} Ninety-Five Theses to several bishops. His theses protested key points of Catholic {{doctrine}} {{as well as}} the sale of indulgences. In Switzerland, Huldrych Zwingli, John Calvin and other Protestant Reformers further criticised Catholic teachings. These challenges developed into the European movement called the Protestant Reformation, which gave birth to a variety of Christian denominations known today collectively as Protestantism. The English Reformation during the reign of Henry VIII began as a <b>political</b> <b>dispute.</b> When the pope denied Henry's petition for a declaration of nullity of his marriage to Catherine of Aragon, he had the Acts of Supremacy passed, making him head of Church of England, forming Protestant Anglicanism.|$|E

Benjamin More, a justice of the peace in the District of Columbia, argued that the repeal of statutory provisions authorizing compensation for his office violated the salary-protection guarantees for federal judges in Article Three of the United States Constitution. Below, a divided panel of the United States Circuit Court of the District of Columbia had sided with More, interpreted the repeal act prospectively, and sustained his demurrer to the criminal indictment for the common law crime of exacting illegal fees under color of office.|$|E
40|$|This paper aims {{to examine}} the {{economic}} and <b>political</b> <b>disputes</b> between the United States and the European Community between 1969 and 1974. Utilising the documentary research approach, the paper will first explore the main economic disputes which were manifested in two rounds of the United States-European Community Consultation in 1970 and 1972. Then, it will investigate the divergence between the United States and the European Community in their policy stances on energy and the 1973 Arab-Israeli War which together constituted the major <b>political</b> <b>disputes</b> between the two sides. With these economic and <b>political</b> <b>disputes,</b> the years 1969 - 1974 witnessed a difficult phase of the United States-the European Community relations...|$|R
