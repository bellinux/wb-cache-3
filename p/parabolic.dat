5|$|A <b>parabolic</b> trough {{consists}} of a linear <b>parabolic</b> reflector that concentrates light onto a receiver positioned along the reflector's focal line. The receiver is a tube positioned right above {{the middle of the}} <b>parabolic</b> mirror and is filled with a working fluid. The reflector is made to follow the sun during daylight hours by tracking along a single axis. <b>Parabolic</b> trough systems provide the best land-use factor of any solar technology. The SEGS plants in California and Acciona's Nevada Solar One near Boulder City, Nevada are representatives of this technology.|$|E
5|$|A <b>parabolic</b> recurving track. Storms recurving affect eastern Philippines, eastern China, Taiwan, Korea, Japan, and the Russian Far East.|$|E
5|$|Archimedes {{may have}} used mirrors acting collectively as a <b>parabolic</b> {{reflector}} to burn ships attacking Syracuse.|$|E
5|$|Compact Linear Fresnel Reflectors are CSP-plants {{which use}} many thin mirror strips instead of <b>parabolic</b> mirrors to {{concentrate}} sunlight onto two tubes with working fluid. This {{has the advantage}} that flat mirrors can be used which are much cheaper than <b>parabolic</b> mirrors, and that more reflectors can {{be placed in the}} same amount of space, allowing more of the available sunlight to be used. Concentrating linear fresnel reflectors can be used in either large or more compact plants.|$|E
5|$|Here a <b>parabolic</b> shear in {{the outer}} {{velocity}} is introduced.|$|E
5|$|<b>Parabolic</b> dish systems {{give the}} highest {{efficiency}} among CSP technologies. The 50kW Big Dish in Canberra, Australia {{is an example}} of this technology.|$|E
5|$|Hilbert spaces {{allow for}} many {{elliptic}} partial differential equations to be formulated {{in a similar}} way, and the Lax–Milgram theorem is then a basic tool in their analysis. With suitable modifications, similar techniques {{can be applied to}} <b>parabolic</b> partial differential equations and certain hyperbolic partial differential equations.|$|E
5|$|Isaac Newton, in his Principia Mathematica of 1687, {{proved that}} an object moving under the {{influence}} of gravity must trace out an orbit shaped like one of the conic sections, and he demonstrated how to fit a comet's path through the sky to a <b>parabolic</b> orbit, using the comet of 1680 as an example.|$|E
5|$|Strombolian eruptions eject {{volcanic}} {{bombs and}} lapilli fragments that travel in <b>parabolic</b> paths before landing around their source vent. The steady accumulation of small fragments builds cinder cones composed completely of basaltic pyroclasts. This form of accumulation tends {{to result in}} well-ordered rings of tephra.|$|E
5|$|The Stirling {{solar dish}} {{combines}} a <b>parabolic</b> concentrating dish with a Stirling engine which normally drives an electric generator. The advantages of Stirling solar over photovoltaic cells are higher efficiency of converting sunlight into electricity and longer lifetime.|$|E
5|$|This {{proposition}} {{is based}} on Galileo’s analysis of a body following a <b>parabolic</b> trajectory under the action of a constant acceleration. In Proposition 10, he describes it as Galileo’s Theorem, and mentions Galileo several other times in relation {{to it in the}} Principia. Combining it with Kepler's Second Law gives the simple and elegant method.|$|E
5|$|A {{wide range}} of concentrating {{technologies}} exists: among the best known are the <b>parabolic</b> trough, the compact linear Fresnel reflector, the Stirling dish and the solar power tower. Various techniques are used to track the sun and focus light. In all of these systems a working fluid is heated by the concentrated sunlight, and is then used for power generation or energy storage. Thermal storage efficiently allows up to 24-hour electricity generation.|$|E
5|$|These approximations {{are used}} {{in a variety of}} {{practical}} flow problems of scientific and engineering interest. The above analysis is for any instantaneous laminar or turbulent boundary layer, but is used mainly in laminar flow studies since the mean flow is also the instantaneous flow because there are no velocity fluctuations present. This simplified equation is a <b>parabolic</b> PDE and can be solved using a similarity solution {{often referred to as the}} Blasius boundary layer.|$|E
25|$|A <b>parabolic</b> antenna is {{an antenna}} {{that uses a}} <b>parabolic</b> reflector, a curved surface with the {{cross-sectional}} shape of a parabola, to direct the radio waves. The most common form is shaped like a dish and is popularly called a dish antenna or <b>parabolic</b> dish. The main advantage of a <b>parabolic</b> antenna {{is that it has}} high directivity. It functions similarly to a searchlight or flashlight reflector to direct the radio waves in a narrow beam, or receive radio waves from one particular direction only. <b>Parabolic</b> antennas have some of the highest gains, meaning that they can produce the narrowest beamwidths, of any antenna type. In order to achieve narrow beamwidths, the <b>parabolic</b> reflector must be much larger than the wavelength of the radio waves used, so <b>parabolic</b> antennas are used in the high frequency part of the radio spectrum, at UHF and microwave (SHF) frequencies, at which the wavelengths are small enough that conveniently-sized reflectors can be used.|$|E
25|$|A <b>parabolic</b> {{microphone}} uses a <b>parabolic</b> reflector {{to collect}} and focus sound waves onto a microphone receiver, {{in much the same}} way that a <b>parabolic</b> antenna (e.g. satellite dish) does with radio waves. Typical uses of this microphone, which has unusually focused front sensitivity and can pick up sounds from many meters away, include nature recording, outdoor sporting events, eavesdropping, law enforcement, and even espionage. <b>Parabolic</b> microphones are not typically used for standard recording applications, because they tend to have poor low-frequency response as a side effect of their design.|$|E
25|$|If g is a semisimple Lie algebra with <b>parabolic</b> subalgebra p (i.e., p {{contains}} a maximal solvable subalgebra of g) and G and P are associated Lie groups, then a Cartan connection modelled on (G,P,g,p) {{is called a}} <b>parabolic</b> Cartan geometry, or simply a <b>parabolic</b> geometry. A distinguishing feature of <b>parabolic</b> geometries is a Lie algebra structure on its cotangent spaces: this arises because the perpendicular subspace p⊥ of p in g {{with respect to the}} Killing form of g is a subalgebra of p, and the Killing form induces a natural duality between p⊥ and g/p. Thus the bundle associated to p⊥ is isomorphic to the cotangent bundle.|$|E
25|$|The bridge's design uses a <b>parabolic</b> arch.|$|E
25|$|The {{length of}} the church is divided into bays by the exposed <b>parabolic</b> arches. A {{scaled-down}} arch within the arch closest to the sanctuary provides the framework for a lower arched ceiling, lined with plasterboard. The gap between the inner and outer arches is glazed with frosted glass. The lower ceiling stops short of touching the southern sanctuary wall, allowing views of the main roof structure. Throughout the nave, the underside of the <b>parabolic</b> roof is lined with timber, while the tops of the <b>parabolic</b> arches are concealed from view by a high, plasterboard-clad cove.|$|E
25|$|In 2011, the Canadian Space Agency {{invited him}} to {{participate}} in a series of <b>parabolic</b> flights aboard the Falcon 20 in Ottawa to support a combustion experiment. In 2016, he participates as Visiting Professor in the Space Studies Programme (SSP-16) of the International Space University (ISU) taking place at the Technion in Haifa, Israël. He takes part in a series of <b>parabolic</b> flights on board a Grob G103a Twin II glider organized by ISU’s Space Sciences Department, performing several experiments proposed by ISU students, conducting therefore the first scientific <b>parabolic</b> flights in the Middle-East.|$|E
25|$|To {{demonstrate}} the Coriolis effect, a <b>parabolic</b> turntable can be used.|$|E
25|$|Applied {{similarly}} to the <b>parabolic</b> reflector, the slotted waveguide is moved mechanically to scan and is particularly suitable for non-tracking surface scan systems, where the vertical pattern may remain constant. Owing to its lower cost and less wind exposure, shipboard, airport surface, and harbour surveillance radars now use this approach in preference to a <b>parabolic</b> antenna.|$|E
25|$|When completed, the <b>parabolic</b> {{roof was}} clad in flat {{aluminium}} sheeting, folded over angled timber fillets which ran horizontally {{along the length}} of the roof. Panels of translucent corrugated fibreglass sheeting ran along the apex and in six vertical strips at the southern end. By 1968, problems with leaking led to the roof sheeting being replaced with corrugated aluminium. Repairs and changes have been made since and all of the original translucent sections of the <b>parabolic</b> roof have been replaced with opaque sheeting. Thus, internal features such as the side-lighting of the sanctuary wall and indirect light along the apex of the <b>parabolic</b> ceiling have been lost.|$|E
25|$|The heat {{equation}} is the prototypical {{example of a}} <b>parabolic</b> partial differential equation.|$|E
25|$|A beam {{projector}} is a lensless instrument {{with very}} little beam spread. It uses two reflectors. The primary reflector is a <b>parabolic</b> reflector and the secondary reflector is a spherical reflector. The <b>parabolic</b> reflector directs the light into nearly parallel beams, and the spherical reflector is {{placed in front of}} the lamp to reflect light from the lamp back to the <b>parabolic</b> reflector, which reduces spill. The result is an intense shaft of light that cannot be easily controlled or modified. The beam projector no longer is used {{to the extent that it}} once was, as newer fixtures and PAR lamps have created easier ways to produce the effect.|$|E
25|$|The {{other large}} use of <b>parabolic</b> antennas is for radar antennas, {{in which there}} is a need to {{transmit}} a narrow beam of radio waves to locate objects like ships, airplanes, and guided missiles, and often for weather detection. With the advent of home satellite television receivers, <b>parabolic</b> antennas have become a common feature of the landscapes of modern countries.|$|E
25|$|Equivalently, all quadric {{surfaces}} contain circles except <b>parabolic</b> and hyperbolic cylinders and hyperbolic paraboloids.|$|E
25|$|The {{dominant}} {{element of the}} church's design is the <b>parabolic</b> arched roof over the nave and sanctuary. Clad in metal roof sheeting, the <b>parabolic</b> form is created by a reinforced concrete arch at the front, regularly spaced laminated timber arches throughout the interior and a brick end wall at the rear. A raised strip of roofing along the apex is clad in opaque sheeting.|$|E
25|$|Profile: the {{vertical}} alignment of a road, {{expressed as a}} series of grades, connected by <b>parabolic</b> curves.|$|E
25|$|The 64MW Nevada Solar One uses <b>parabolic</b> trough {{technology}} {{in one of}} the largest solar plants in the world.|$|E
25|$|From 1985 till early 2016, Pletser is {{responsible}} of ESA aircraft <b>parabolic</b> flight campaigns for short duration microgravity experiments.|$|E
25|$|The {{catenary}} curve has a U-like shape, superficially similar in appearance to a <b>parabolic</b> arch, {{but it is}} not a parabola.|$|E
25|$|The <b>parabolic</b> arch {{has been}} {{associated}} with church architecture since at least the 1880s. German architect Dominikus Bohm (1880-1955) exploited the possibilities of the <b>parabolic</b> arch in several 1920s church designs, demonstrating that the kind of atmosphere commonly associated with Gothic architecture could be obtained with a minimum of historical allusion. Though it remained an uncommon architectural form in the early 20th century, it featured in several Modernist churches, most notably the Church of St Francis of Assisi (completed 1943) in Pampulha, Brazil, designed by Brazilian architect Oscar Niemeyer (1907-2012). Constructed from cast in-situ concrete, the nave of the church was a free-standing <b>parabolic</b> vault. Highly controversial at the time, Niemeyer's bold design was extremely influential among architects around the world (including Australia), with photographs and plans of the church published in architectural journals.|$|E
25|$|Spherical concave and convex mirrors do {{not focus}} {{parallel}} rays {{to a single}} point due to spherical aberration. However, the ideal of focusing to a point is a commonly used approximation. <b>Parabolic</b> reflectors resolve this, allowing incoming parallel rays (for example, light from a distant star) to be focused to a small spot; almost an ideal point. <b>Parabolic</b> reflectors are not suitable for imaging nearby objects because the light rays are not parallel.|$|E
25|$|Full-scale <b>parabolic</b> trough systems {{consist of}} many such troughs {{laid out in}} {{parallel}} over a large area of land. Since 1985 a solar thermal system using this principle has been in full operation in California in the United States. It is called the Solar Energy Generating Systems (SEGS) system. Other CSP designs lack this kind of long experience and therefore it can currently {{be said that the}} <b>parabolic</b> trough design is the most thoroughly proven CSP technology.|$|E
25|$|A <b>parabolic</b> dome is {{a unique}} {{structure}} in which bending stress due to the uniformly distributed load of its dead load is zero. Hence it was widely used in buildings in ancient times, {{before the advent of}} composite structures. However, if a point load is applied on the apex of a <b>parabolic</b> dome, the bending stress becomes infinite. Hence it is found in most ancient structures, the apex of the dome is stiffened or the shape modified to avoid the infinite stress.|$|E
25|$|This {{eye type}} {{functions}} by refracting light, then using a <b>parabolic</b> mirror {{to focus the}} image; it combines features of superposition and apposition eyes.|$|E
