40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{determine}} teachers’ self-efficacy <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> professional commitment levels; to examine the relationship between their self-efficacy <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> professional commitment levels and to determine whether their self-efficacy <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> professional commitment levels change according to various variables. This study was conducted with 349 teachers working at the districts of Van province. As data collection tools, "Teachers’ Self-efficacy Scale" consisting of 32 items and developed by Senemoğlu (2006), and "Teachers’ Professional Commitment Scale" consisting of 20 items and developed by Kozikoğlu (2016) were used in this study. In data analysis; descriptive statistics, t-test, ANOVA and Pearson Correlation Coefficient was used. As a result of the study, teachers’ self-efficacy <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> professional commitment levels were found as high. It was found that teachers’ self-efficacy <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> professional commitment don’t change significantly according to gender and branch. Furthermore; a positive, moderate level and significant relationship was found between teachers’ self-efficacy <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> professional commitment. This shows that as teachers’ self-efficacy perceptions increase, so does their commitment...|$|R
40|$|The <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> {{sentiments of}} {{business}} respondents are considered important for statistical bureaus. As <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> sentiments {{are related to}} the behavior of the people expressing them, gaining insights into the <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> sentiments of business respondents is of interest to understand business survey response. In this article we present an exploratory analysis of expressions in the social media regarding Statistics Netherlands. In recent years, social media have become an important infrastructure for communication flows and thus an essential network in our social structure. Within that network participants are actively involved in expressing sentiments <b>and</b> <b>perceptions.</b> The results of our analysis provide insights into the <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> sentiments that business respondents have of this national statistical institute and specifically its business surveys. They point towards the specific causes that have led to a positive or a negative sentiment. Based on these results, recommendations aimed at influencing the <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> sentiments will be discussed, with the ultimate goal of stimulating survey participation. We also suggest recommendations regarding social media studies on sentiments <b>and</b> <b>perceptions</b> of survey respondents...|$|R

In this sense, it can be argued that all observation is theory-laden.|$|E

The present study explored <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> attitudes of local people towards forest conservation and developmental interventions by external agents, identifying sources of conflicts, and proposing solutions in future management and policy decisions {{in the context of}} WWF. An attempt was made to explain <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> attitudes of the local people that possibly influence engagement in the co-management scheme of the WWF through the PFM approach. This is because <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> attitudes are understood to be important antecedents of people’s behavior in relation to natural resources management or conservation (Jotte 1997). Thus, many contemporary studies considered <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> attitudes of local people as a major topic, mostly, in relation to conservation projects or in the context of wildlife and nature reserve management (e.g., Badola 1998; Gillingham and Lee 1999; Kideghesho et al. 2007; Lee et al. 2009; Mehta and Heinen 2001; Mehta and Kellert 1998; Tesfaye et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to compare two {{engagement}} constructs (work engagement and personal role engagement) with regards to their relationship with training <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> work role performance behaviours. It was hypothesised that personal role engagement would show incremental validity above that of work engagement at predicting work role performance behaviours and be a stronger mediator of the relationships between training <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> such behaviours. Questionnaire data was gathered from 304 full-time working adults in the UK. As predicted, personal role engagement was found to explain additional variance above that of work engagement for task proficiency, task adaptability, and task proactivity behaviours. Moreover, personal role engagement was a stronger mediator of the relationship between training <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> task proficiency as well as between training <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> task adaptability. Both work engagement and personal role engagement mediated the relationship between training <b>perceptions</b> <b>and</b> task proactivity to a similar degree. The findings suggest that personal role engagement has better practical utility to the HRD domain than work engagement, and indicates that future research may benefit from adopting the personal role engagement construct...|$|R

Bowie received a serious injury at school in 1962 when his friend George Underwood punched him in the left eye during a fight over a girl.

5|$|Cognitive {{disturbances}} {{can occur}} {{in the early stages}} of the disease and sometimes prior to diagnosis, and increase in prevalence with duration of the disease. The most common cognitive deficit in PD is executive dysfunction, which can include problems with planning, cognitive flexibility, abstract thinking, rule acquisition, inhibiting inappropriate actions, initiating appropriate actions, working memory, and control of attention. Other cognitive difficulties include slowed cognitive processing speed, impaired recall and impaired <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> estimation of time. Nevertheless, improvement appears when recall is aided by cues. Visuospatial difficulties are also part of the disease, seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests of facial recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines. A person with PD has two to six times the risk of dementia compared to the general population.|$|E

5|$|Most {{forms of}} {{camouflage}} are made ineffective by movement: a deer or grasshopper may be highly cryptic when motionless, but instantly seen when it moves.

Motion dazzle may degrade predators' ability {{to estimate the}} prey's speed and direction accurately, giving the prey an improved chance of escape. Motion dazzle distorts speed <b>perception</b> <b>and</b> is most effective at high speeds; stripes can also distort perception of size (and so, perceived range to the target). As of 2011, motion dazzle had been proposed for military vehicles, but never applied. Since motion dazzle patterns would make animals more difficult to locate accurately when moving, but easier to see when stationary, {{there would be an}} evolutionary trade-off between motion dazzle and crypsis.|$|E
