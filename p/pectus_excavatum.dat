5|$|Roughly 20% of {{patients}} with SCSFLS exhibit features of Marfan syndrome, including tall stature, hollowed chest (<b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum),</b> joint hypermobility and arched palate. However these patients do not exhibit any other Marfan syndrome presentations.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> is a {{relatively}} common symptom of Noonan syndrome, Marfan syndrome and Loeys-Dietz syndrome and sometimes is found in other connective tissue disorders such as Ehlersâ€“Danlos Syndrome. Many children with spinal muscular atrophy develop <b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> due to their diaphragmatic breathing. <b>Pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> also occurs in about 1% of persons diagnosed with celiac disease for unknown reasons.|$|E

25|$|<b>Pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> is {{differentiated}} {{from other}} disorders {{by a series}} of elimination of signs and symptoms. Pectus carinatum is excluded by the simple observation of a collapsing of the sternum rather than a protrusion.

25|$|The implant allows <b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> to {{be treated}} from a purely {{morphological}} perspective. Today it {{is used as a}} benchmark procedure as it is simple, reliable, and minimally intrusive while offering aesthetically-pleasing results. This procedure does not, however, claim to correct existing cardiac and respiratory problems which, in very rare cases, can be triggered by the <b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> condition. For female sufferers, the potential resulting breast asymmetry can be partially or completely corrected by this procedure.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> is {{sometimes}} {{considered to be}} cosmetic, but depending on the severity, it can impair cardiac and respiratory function and cause pain {{in the chest and}} back.|$|E
25|$|American Olympic swimmer Cody Miller (born 1992) {{opted not}} to have {{treatment}} for <b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum,</b> even though it limited his lung capacity. He earned {{a gold medal in}} 2016.|$|E
25|$|Brazilian orthopedist Sydney Haje {{developed}} a non-surgical protocol for treating pectus carinatum {{as well as}} <b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum.</b> The method involves wearing a compressive orthosis and adhering to an exercise protocol.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> {{occurs in}} an {{estimated}} 1 in 150 to 1 in 1000 births, with male predominance (male-to-female ratio of 3:1). In 35% to 45% of cases {{family members are}} affected.|$|E
25|$|There {{has been}} {{controversy}} {{as to the}} best surgical approach for correction of <b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum.</b> It {{is important for the}} surgeon to select the appropriate operative approach based on each individual's characteristics.|$|E
25|$|The {{chest wall}} is elastic, {{gradually}} stiffening over age. Non-surgical treatments {{have been developed}} that aim at gradually alleviating the <b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> condition, making use of the elasticity of the chest wall, including the costal cartilages, in particular in young cases.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> is a {{congenital}} deformity of the anterior thoracic wall {{in which the}} sternum and rib cage grow abnormally. This produces a caved-in or sunken appearance of the chest. It can either be present at birth or not develop until puberty.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> is {{initially}} suspected from visual {{examination of the}} anterior chest. Auscultation of the chest can reveal displaced heart beat and valve prolapse. There can be a heart murmur occurring during systole caused by proximity between the sternum and the pulmonary artery.|$|E
25|$|Physiologically, {{increased}} pressure in utero, rickets and increased traction on the sternum due to abnormalities of the diaphragm have been postulated as specific mechanisms. Because {{the heart is}} located behind the sternum, and because individuals with <b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> {{have been shown to}} have visible deformities of the heart seen both on radiological imaging and after autopsies, it has been hypothesized that there is impairment of function of the cardiovascular system in individuals with <b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum.</b> While some studies have demonstrated decreased cardiovascular function, no consensus has been reached based on newer physiological tests such as echocardiography of the presence or degree of impairment in cardiovascular function. Similarly, there is no consensus on the degree of functional improvement after corrective surgery; A 2013 meta-analysis yielded conflicting results.|$|E
25|$|The {{hallmark}} of the condition is a sunken appearance of the sternum. The most common form is a cup-shaped concavity, involving {{the lower end of}} the sternum; also a broader concavity involving the upper costal cartilages is possible. The lower-most ribs may protrude ("flared ribs"). <b>Pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> defects may be symmetric or asymmetric.|$|E
25|$|<b>Pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> is {{also known}} to occur in animals, e.g. the Munchkin breed of cat. Some {{procedures}} used to treat the condition in animals have not been used in human treatments, {{such as the use}} of a cast with sutures wrapped around the sternum and the use of internal and external splints. These techniques are generally used in immature animals with flexible cartilage.|$|E
25|$|Chest x-rays {{are also}} {{useful in the}} diagnosis. The chest x-ray in <b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> can show an opacity in the right lung area that can be mistaken for an {{infiltrate}} (such as that seen with pneumonia). Some studies also suggest that the Haller index can be calculated based on chest x-ray as opposed to CT scanning in individuals who have no limitation in their function.|$|E
25|$|The {{magnetic}} mini-mover procedure (3MP) is {{a technique}} used to correct <b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> by using two magnets to realign the sternum {{with the rest of}} the chest and ribcage. One magnet is inserted 1cm into the patient's body on the lower end of the sternum, the other is placed externally onto a custom fitted brace. These two magnets generate around 0.04tesla (T) in order to slowly move the sternum outwards over a number of years. The maximum magnetic field that can be applied to the body safely is around 4T, making this technique safe from a magnetic viewpoint. The 3MP technique's main advantages are that it is more cost-effective than major surgical approaches such as the Nuss procedure and it is considerably less painful postoperatively.|$|E
2500|$|Researchers {{are unsure}} of the cause of <b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> but assume {{that there is a}} genetic {{component}} for {{at least some of the}} cases as 37% of individuals have an affected first degree family member.

2500|$|Surgical {{correction}} of the <b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> {{has been shown}} to significantly improve cardiovascular function; there is inconclusive evidence so far as to whether it might also improve pulmonary function. One of the most popular techniques for repair of <b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> today is the minimally invasive operation, also known as MIRPE or Nuss technique.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> is from Latin meaning {{hollowed}} chest. [...] It {{is sometimes}} referred to as sunken chest syndrome, cobbler's chest or funnel chest.|$|E
2500|$|... in 1987, Donald Nuss, {{based at}} Children's Hospital of The King's Daughters in Norfolk, Virginia, {{performed}} the first minimally invasive repair of <b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> (MIRPE) [...] and presented it much later {{at a conference}} in 1997.|$|E
2500|$|Physical {{exercise}} [...] has {{an important}} role in conservative <b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> treatment though is not seen as a means to resolve the condition on its own.

2500|$|The size of [...] hands {{may have}} been a manifestation of Marfan's syndrome, their size and {{slenderness}} typical of arachnodactyly. However, Rachmaninov did not clearly exhibit any of the other clinical characteristics typical of Marfan's, such as scoliosis, <b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum,</b> and eye or cardiac complications. Nor did he express any of the clinical effects of a Marfan-related syndrome, such as Beal's syndrome (congenital contractural arachnodactyly), Ehlers-Danlos syndrome, homocystinuria, Stickler syndrome, or Sphrintzen-Goldberg syndrome. There is no indication that his immediate family had similar hand spans, ruling out familial arachnodactyly. Rachmaninov did not display any signs of digital clubbing or any obvious hypertrophic skin changes associated with pachydermoperiostitis.|$|E
2500|$|Noonan {{syndrome}} (NS) is {{a relatively}} common autosomal dominant congenital disorder [...] and is named after Jacqueline Noonan, a pediatric cardiologist. It {{is referred to as}} the male version of Turner's syndrome; however, the genetic causes of Noonan syndrome and Turner syndrome are distinct and both males and females are affected. The principal features include congenital heart defect (typicall pulmonary valve stenosis with dysplastic pulmonary valve also atrial septal defect and hypertrophic cardiomyopathy), short stature, learning problems, <b>pectus</b> <b>excavatum,</b> impaired blood clotting, and a characteristic configuration of facial features including a webbed neck and a flat nose bridge. [...] NS is a RASopathy, and is one of several disorders that are caused by a disruption of RAS-MAPK signaling pathway.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Pectus</b> <b>excavatum</b> {{requires}} no corrective procedures in mild cases. [...] Treatment of severe cases can involve either invasive or non-invasive techniques {{or a combination}} of both. Before an operation proceeds several tests are usually to be performed. These include, but are not limited to, a CT scan, pulmonary function tests, and cardiology exams (such as auscultation and ECGs). [...] After a CT scan is taken, the Haller index is measured. The patient's Haller is calculated by obtaining the ratio of the transverse diameter (the horizontal distance of the inside of the ribcage) and the anteroposterior diameter (the shortest distance between the vertebrae and sternum). A Haller Index of greater than 3.25 is generally considered severe, while normal chest has an index of 2.5. The cardiopulmonary tests are used to determine the lung capacity and to check for heart murmurs.|$|E
