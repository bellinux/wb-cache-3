50|$|Error Location Analysis {{became a}} {{cornerstone}} technique for diagnosing problems with digital communications {{by identifying the}} precise location of bit-errors during a bit error rate testing session. Fundamental bit error rate testing is accomplished by comparing a communicated bit-stream with a reference (correct) bit-stream. The correct bits may be stored in a memory device or synthesized in real-time as reception of the communicated bit-stream occurs. It is common for these bit-streams to contain <b>pseudo-random</b> <b>binary</b> <b>sequence</b> (PRBS) patterns that permit easy synchronization {{with just a few}} correctly received consecutive bits. This self-synchronizing feature of PRBS patterns make them ideal for BERT testing. Traditional BERT devices possess generators that produce test bit-streams for output, and detectors that receive test bit-streams and count the number of bits being received and the number of mis-matches between the received and the reference bit-streams. Using the simple formula, BER = Number-of-Errors / Number-of-Bits-Transmitted,the BER is calculated. Error location analysis extends these fundamental features by employing a hardware memory device that effectively stores the value of the received bit counter whenever a mismatching error is detected. This produces a stream of error locations that are processed in real-time, and/or stored for post-processing. Many types of statistical processing algorithms were developed by SyntheSys Research, producing a comprehensive set of error location analysis tools.|$|E

The CDSK modulation scheme transmits the sum of a chaotic reference signal with its delayed modulated version.
