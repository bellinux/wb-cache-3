5|$|The Boston Globe and the Boston Herald {{are two of}} the city's major daily newspapers. The city is {{also served}} by other {{publications}} such as Boston magazine, The Improper Bostonian, DigBoston, and the Boston edition of Metro. The Christian Science Monitor, headquartered in Boston, was formerly a worldwide daily newspaper but ended publication of daily print editions in 2009, switching to continuous online and weekly magazine format publications. The Boston Globe also releases a teen publication to the city's public high schools, called Teens in <b>Print</b> <b>or</b> T.i.P., which is written by the city's teens and delivered quarterly within the school year.|$|E
5|$|The Croatian Parliament publishes all its {{decisions}} in Narodne Novine, the official gazette of the Republic of Croatia. Article 90 {{of the constitution}} requires publication of all acts and other regulations in the gazette before they are legally binding. Narodne Novine is available through a paid subscription as <b>print,</b> <b>or</b> for free online. Parliamentary debates and other proceedings {{are the subject of}} news coverage by media of Croatia, and Saborska televizija was set up in 2007 in addition as an IPTV channel broadcasting all plenary sessions of the parliament. Finally, the Parliament's Public Relations Department publishes a news bulletin available to all institutions and citizens of Croatia through a print paid subscription, and online for free.|$|E
5|$|The MIT {{library system}} {{consists}} of five subject libraries: Barker (Engineering), Dewey (Economics), Hayden (Humanities and Science), Lewis (Music), and Rotch (Arts and Architecture). There are also various specialized libraries and archives. The libraries contain more than 2.9 million printed volumes, 2.4 million microforms, 49,000 <b>print</b> <b>or</b> electronic journal subscriptions, and 670 reference databases. The {{past decade has}} seen a trend of increased focus on digital over print resources in the libraries. Notable collections include the Lewis Music Library {{with an emphasis on}} 20th and 21st-century music and electronic music, the List Visual Arts Center's rotating exhibitions of contemporary art, and the Compton Gallery's cross-disciplinary exhibitions. MIT allocates a percentage of the budget for all new construction and renovation to commission and support its extensive public art and outdoor sculpture collection.|$|E

25|$|Defamation means {{tarnishing}} {{the reputation}} of someone. It {{is divided into two}} parts, slander and libel. Slander is spoken defamation and libel is defaming somebody through <b>print</b> (<b>or</b> broadcasting). Both share the same features. To defame someone, you must (a) make a factual assertion (b) for which you cannot provide evidence of its truth. Defamation does not affect the voicing of opinions, but comes into the same fields as rights to free speech in the European Convention's Article 10.|$|E
25|$|Medical {{transcription}} {{encompasses the}} MT, performing document typing and formatting functions {{according to an}} established criterion or format, transcribing the spoken word of the patient's care information into a written, easily readable form. MT requires correct spelling of all terms and words, (occasionally) correcting medical terminology or dictation errors. MTs also edit the transcribed documents, <b>print</b> <b>or</b> return the completed documents in a timely fashion. All transcription reports must comply with medico-legal concerns, policies and procedures, and laws under patient confidentiality.|$|E
25|$|The job of {{individual}} identification took many weeks, and was largely done by teams of pathologists, dentists, and police. The mortuary team {{was led by}} Inspector Jim Morgan, who collated and edited {{a report on the}} recovery operation. Record keeping had to be meticulous because of the number and fragmented state of the human remains that had to be identified to the satisfaction of the coroner. From a purely technical point of view the exercise was both innovative and highly successful, with 83% of the deceased eventually being identified, sometimes from evidence such as a finger capable of yielding a <b>print,</b> <b>or</b> keys in a pocket.|$|E

25|$|Roth's work became {{increasingly}} varied throughout the 1970s. He exhibited manufacturing instructions - the Order Form Exhibitions - {{for the first}} show, any buyer could take the directions to a printer of their choice, and create their own <b>print</b> <b>or</b> multiple; second time around, the instructions {{had to be taken}} to a baker to create the collector's own baked goods. The same attitude applied to collectors; his most important collector, the German dentist Hanns Sohm, made his own Literature Sausages to Roth's instructions, including Georg Wilhelm Friedrih Hegel’s Work in 20 Volumes. He published the magazine Zeitschrift für Alles (Review for Everything) 1975–1987, promised to publish anything that anyone sent to Roth, the only editorial constraint being the limit of 4 (later 5) pages. By the time Roth announced its demise, the journal had grown to 1396 pages long. The mid seventies also saw a comprehensive attempt to republish all of Roth's bookworks. Instigated by Hansjörg Mayer, a publisher Roth had met in 1963, the Gesammelte Werke (Collected Works) would run to 26 volumes, many of which are still easily available across Europe and America.|$|E

500|$|The {{arrival of}} sound in South Indian cinema, {{with the release}} of Kalidas, {{triggered}} a migration of theatre artists into cinema. Kalidas was the only Tamil film to be produced and released in 1931. No <b>print</b> <b>or</b> gramophone record of the film is known to survive, making it a lost film. The Indian Express stated in 2014 that the film had [...] "turned to dust" [...] long before the National Film Archive of India was established in 1964. The only remaining artefacts include a few stills, advertisements, and an image of the cover of the songbook. As of December 2002, Film News Anandan had preserved several photographs related to the film.|$|E
500|$|For most of {{the nineteenth}} and twentieth centuries, Mary Shelley {{was known as the}} author of Frankenstein and the wife of famous Romantic poet Percy Bysshe Shelley. It was not until the 1970s, with the rise of feminist {{literary}} criticism, that scholars began to pay attention to her other works. In fact, with the exception of Frankenstein and The Last Man, until the 1990s almost all of Mary Shelley's writings had gone out of <b>print</b> <b>or</b> only been available in expensive, scholarly editions. It was not until the publication of scholarship by Mary Poovey and Anne K.

500|$|In either 1740 or 1741, Boydell saw a {{print of}} Hawarden Castle by William Henry Toms {{and was so}} delighted with it that he {{immediately}} set out again for London to learn printmaking and Lloyd promised to wait for him. Boydell apprenticed himself to Toms and enrolled in St Martin's Lane Academy to learn drawing. [...] Each day he worked about fourteen hours for Toms and then attended drawing classes at night. After six years, Boydell's diligence allowed him to buy out {{the last year of}} his apprenticeship, and in 1746 he set up an independent shop on the Strand that specialised in topographical prints that cost six pence for a cheap <b>print</b> <b>or</b> one shilling for an expensive print.|$|E
500|$|The lines by Pope, though {{referring}} to Theobald, {{the hero of}} The Dunciad, are a characterisation of a Grub Street hack, a stereotype popular in the 1730s denoting a man of limited writing ability who lived in poverty but nevertheless determinedly pursued a career in literature;, Therefore, the particular scribbler depicted in the painting {{would be one of}} this fraternity of [...] "witlings" [...] who banded together to protest Pope's poem. In this context it would make sense, therefore, for the poet to have the scabrous anti-Pope <b>print,</b> <b>or</b> an emblem of Pope's fight with the hack writers' patron, above him. Just as Moll Hackabout has a picture of [...] Macheath on her wall in A Harlot's Progress, this aspiring and witless poet would have a picture of his hero, Edmund Curll, and an anti-Pope print. The emblem, in other words, identifies the poet's [...] "side" [...] in the battle between dunces and men of wit.|$|E
500|$|Shortly before Christmas of 2011, Christopher Nolan invited several {{prominent}} directors, including Edgar Wright, Michael Bay, Bryan Singer, Jon Favreau, Eli Roth, Duncan Jones and Stephen Daldry, to Universal CityWalk's IMAX theatre {{for a private}} screening of the first six minutes of The Dark Knight Rises, which had been shot on IMAX film and edited from the original camera negative. Nolan, feeling {{that the use of}} film stock in cinema is currently being phased out due to the introduction of digital cinematography and projection, used this screening to make a case for the continued use of film, which he asserts still offers superior image quality to any digital format, and warned the filmmakers that unless they continued to assert their choice to use film in their productions, they may eventually lose it as an option. Nolan explained; [...] "I wanted to {{give them a chance to}} see the potential, because I think IMAX is the best film format that was ever invented. It's the gold standard and what any other technology has to match up to, but none have, in my opinion. The message I wanted to put out there was that no one is taking anyone's digital cameras away. But if we want film to continue as an option, and someone is working on a big studio movie with the resources and the power to insist [...] film, they should say so. I felt as if I didn't say anything, and then we started to lose that option, it would be a shame. When I look at a digitally acquired and projected image, it looks inferior against an original negative anamorphic <b>print</b> <b>or</b> an IMAX one." ...|$|E
