Through a <b>pragmatic</b> <b>study</b> of the societal changes of this time period, Nesbit attempts to understand the break towards abstraction, best characterized by artists Pablo Picasso and George Braque with the rise of Cubism, in which Nesbit interprets the Cubist line as an [...] "embrace of the language of industry". She asserts that it was the introduction of rationalized methods of drawing into the French school curriculum by arts administrators Jean-Baptiste Claude Eugène Guillaume and Antonin Proust in 1881 that led to the break between representational and abstract art.|$|E

5000|$|An {{example of}} the note method is Joseph Birds 1861 Vocal Music Reader and Benjamin Jepsons three book series using [...] "note" [...] methodology. The Elementary Music Reader was {{published}} in 1871 by the Barnes Company, one year after Luther Masons The National Music Course. Benjamin Jepson was a military man turned music teacher in New Haven after an injury in the war. His music textbooks had exercises and songs presented systematically for the goal of music reading and sight-singing. Jepson later published two revisions of his series under the names The Standard Music Reader in 1888, and in 1904 The New Standard Music Reader. [...] Following in Jepsons footsteps of note methodology were Hosea Edson Holt and John Wheeler Tufts, who wrote The Normal Music Course published in 1883 (twelve years after Jepsons The Elementary Music Reader). Click here to read the Normal Music Course. This series had five books all geared toward sight-singing and reading music. A few other note methodology textbook were presented to show the seriousness of music reading as a scientific and <b>pragmatic</b> <b>study.</b> These other note methodology books included: The Graded School Singer by Blackman and Whittemore-1873, and the Cincinnati Schools The Young Singer-1860, The Young Singers Manual-1866, and the Cincinnati Music Reader-1893 (p. 207). The culmination of the scientific method and note methodology advances was presented in Thomas Tappers and Frederick Ripleys The National Music Course published in 1895. The book focused on a no-nonsense systematic approach to music literacy to develop beauty in singing. It emphasized the systematic and pragmatic delivery of materials.|$|E

However, inviting all patients who receive prescriptions for ≥ 2 triptans each month to have an evaluation consultation with their general practitioner (GP), produces insufficient effect on headache outcomes and costs. However, it remains important to stay alert on patients who are candidate for preventive treatment. When discussing the possibility of preventive treatment, GPs should keep in mind possible barriers in patients. Also, GPs have to ask themselves if they do not deny patients a possibly effective treatment because of their own negative ideas towards preventive medication. Also, we learned that when designing <b>pragmatic</b> <b>studies</b> in primary care, there are methodological issues that make it harder to prove the effectiveness of an intervention.

Methods: Critical discussion among 2 key study team members and 2 outside reviewers analyzed the study protocol for accordance with pragmatic vs. explanatory characteristics developed in the PRECIS tool by Thorpe et al.
