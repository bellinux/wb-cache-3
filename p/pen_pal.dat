5|$|Sometime {{prior to}} 1894 Eberhardt began {{corresponding}} with Eugène Letord, a French officer {{stationed in the}} Sahara who had placed a newspaper advertisement for a <b>pen</b> <b>pal.</b> Eberhardt asked him for every detail he could give her {{about life in the}} Sahara, also informing him of her dreams of escaping Geneva alongside her favourite sibling, Augustin. Letord encouraged the two of them to relocate to Bône, Algeria, where he could assist them in establishing a new life. In a series of circumstances that remain unclear though involved financial debts and ties to Russian revolutionist groups with which he was affiliated, Augustin fled Geneva in 1894. Eberhardt probably assisted him initially but was unable to keep track of his whereabouts despite making constant inquiries. In November 1894 Eberhardt was informed by a letter that Augustin had joined the French Foreign Legion and was assigned to Algeria. While at first furious with Augustin's decision, Eberhardt's anger did not last; she asked him to send her a detailed diary of what he saw in North Africa.|$|E

25|$|There {{have been}} several notable {{challenges}} to prison corresponding services. The Missouri Department of Corrections (DOC) stated that effective June 1, 2007, inmates would be prohibited from using <b>pen</b> <b>pal</b> websites, citing concerns that inmates were using them to solicit money and defraud the public. Service providers such as WriteAPrisoner.com, together with the ACLU, plan to challenge the ban in Federal Court. Similar bans on an inmate's rights or a website's right to post such information has been ruled unconstitutional in other courts, citing First Amendment freedoms. Some faith-based initiatives promote {{the positive effects of}} correspondence on inmates, and some have made efforts to help ex-offenders reintegrate into society through job placement assistance. Inmates' ability to mail letters to other inmates has been limited by the courts. Inmate correspondence with members of society is typically encouraged because of the positive impact it can have on inmates, albeit under the guidelines of each institution and availability of letter writers.|$|E

As a result, Berdella became increasingly withdrawn, and further immersed himself in the solitary activities he had participated in since childhood such as painting, collecting coins and stamps, and writing to foreign <b>pen</b> <b>pals.</b> Berdella would later claim that his hobby of writing to <b>pen</b> <b>pals</b> in countries such as Vietnam and Burma and the fact these <b>pen</b> <b>pals</b> would send him stamps for his collection, and photographs of mythical and historical icons, ancient cultures, and architecture would lead to his developing an avid interest in primitive art, photographs, and antiques.

500|$|On {{stage in}} 2009, Hoffman played Iago in Peter Sellars' futuristic {{production}} of Othello (with {{the title role}} by John Ortiz), which received mixed reviews. Ben Brantley, theatre critic of The New York Times, {{found it to be}} [...] "exasperatingly misconceived", remarking that even when Hoffman is attempting to [...] "manipulate others into self-destruction, he comes close to spoiling everything by erupting into genuine, volcanic fury". Hoffman also did his first vocal performance for the claymation film Mary and Max, although the film did not initially have an American release. He played the male title character, a depressed New Yorker with Asperger syndrome, while Toni Collette voiced Mary– the Australian girl who becomes his <b>pen</b> <b>pal.</b> Continuing with animation, Hoffman then worked on an episode of the children's show Arthur and received a Daytime Emmy Award nomination for Outstanding Performer In An Animated Program. Later in the year, he played a brash American disc jockey opposite Bill Nighy and Rhys Ifans in Richard Curtis's British comedy The Boat That Rocked (also known as Pirate Radio)– a character based on Emperor Rosko, a host of Radio Caroline in 1966. He also had a cameo role as a bartender in Ricky Gervais's The Invention of Lying.|$|E
500|$|Woo {{is a fan}} of jazz {{music and}} wanted this style for the soundtrack of Hard Boiled. Woo had also {{previously}} wanted a singer to perform a jazz song and have Chow Yun Fat's character play saxophone in his previous film The Killer. The producer for The Killer, Tsui Hark, rejected this idea for The Killer, feeling that Hong Kong audiences didn't enjoy and understand jazz music. The score heard in Hard Boiled was created by jazz musician Michael Gibbs. During promotional screenings, the score for the film was different and was described as [...] "very haunting music" [...] by film scholar Bey Logan. This score could not be used as the production crew could not get the rights to the music. Other songs featured in the film, include [...] "Hello" [...] by Lionel Richie and the traditional song [...] "Mona Lisa". Woo chose these songs specifically for their lyrics to suggest that Tony was a sort of <b>pen</b> <b>pal</b> to Teresa. All the characters in Hard Boiled had their voices dubbed by their own actors in order to save money. Woo stated this was convenient as {{he did not have to}} worry about setting up boom mics and other sound elements.|$|E
