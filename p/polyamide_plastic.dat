40|$|There {{the study}} objects are the {{structural}} materials under {{the conditions of}} gas-abrasive wear. The purpose is to obtain the new information about the mechanism of gas-abrasive wear with regard to influence of cryogenic temperatures. The original experimental plant, which operates according to the gasodynamical principle of acceleration of abrasive particles and allows to bring the abrasive particles of 50 - 600 mu m up to 10 - 150 m/s over 300 - 80 K range of temperatures. The modes and the variables of operation of plant have been grounded by theory in view to achievement of necessary speeds of collision. The criterion of wear resistance {{as the product of}} ultimate strength of steel into the reduction of area has been ascertained. The comparative tests for wear of materials in use to make the blades of turbo-expanders have been executed. The PA- 66 KS <b>polyamide</b> <b>plastic</b> has been introduced to produce the turbo-expander blades of air turbine refrigerating machines.

40|$|Oxidation of {{cyclohexane}} in {{the liquid}} phase {{is an important}} step in production of caprolactam, subsequently converted into <b>polyamide</b> <b>plastics</b> (Nylon 6, Nylon 66). One of the processes commercially employed to oxidize cyclohexane is the Polish CYCLOPOL process. In order to keep pace with other leading companies, the owners of the CYCLOPOL process continue to carry on research and development work, aimed at increasing productivity and selectivity of the process. A model of the process of the catalytic cyclohexane oxidation in the liquid phase, including both reaction kinetics and mass transfer, is presented. The reaction rate constant as well as the activation energies were determined {{on the basis of the}} experimental results obtained in a laboratory reactor. The model of the hydrodynamics of gas bubbling through a liquid layer is also presented. This model has been verified experimentally for different organic liquids and columns of different scale. The model has been subsequently used to establish a theoretically based correlation for the bubble diameter by means of a numerical experiment using “virtual liquids”. The two models (of chemical kinetics on the system hydrodynamics) have been integrated to give a comprehensive model of the whole process of cyclohexane oxidation in industrial reactors. Numerical simulation of industrial rectors gave good agreement with the operating data. 2. Keywords: process modelling, cyclohexane oxidation, chemical kinetics, hydrodynamics of gas bubblin...|$|R

50|$|Plastic casings are {{generally}} made from polymers such as polyamide, polypropylene, or polyethylene. <b>Polyamide</b> (Nylon) <b>plastic</b> casings {{are the most}} commonly used in production of cooked sausages and hams such as luncheon meat and bologna. Polyamide casings come in two main varieties: Oriented and non-oriented. The oriented polyamide are shrinkable casings and will shrink during the cooking process thereby reducing the water loss. Non-oriented polyamide casings remain the same diameter during the cooking process and thereby allow for expansion of the meat during cooking. The use of polyamide casings has expanded recently with the advent of various varieties and structures of casings such as multilayer casings.|$|R

40|$|For {{measuring}} {{the migration from}} polymers a rapid solvent extraction method {{based on the principle}} of swelling the polymeric matrix has been developed. The method uses a solvent (ethanol or isooctane) of the same polarity as the polymer that is to be extracted. The applicability of this "rapid solvent extraction method" which has already been proven suitable for overall migration from polyolefins - using isooctane as a swelling agent in this case - was further evaluated for <b>polyamide</b> <b>plastics.</b> Migration kinetics with isooctane and ethanol were measured. Kinetic results showed that ethanol is swelling polyamide and leads to maximum total migration values after a few hours at 40 °C. Kinetics with isooctane showed that even after 10 days at 40 °C, migration values far below the ethanol values. This indicates that the determination of the migrant concentration in the polyamide polymer using rapid ethanol-extraction can be used as an alternative quick approach for otherwise time-consuming (specific) migration testing. The obtained results show that the "rapid solvent extraction method" is also working with the polyamide polymer. Examples will be given for overall migration values and also for migration of specific compounds from polyamide materials. The data also support the application of the so called "QM/SML-Concept" which reduces the amount of actual testing which is necessary to ensure the conformity of polymeric food packaging materials with specific migration limits (SML) laid down by legislation. The principle of this concept is to measure the quantity of a specific migrant in the polymer (QM) by an appropriate extraction method and to calculate its specific migration value using a scientifically acknowledged mathematical model...|$|R

40|$|The plasticizer, n-butylbenzenesulfonamide (NBBS), is {{reported}} to be neurotoxic when inoculated intracistemally or intraperitoneally into rabbits. Because NBBS is commonly used in the production of <b>polyamide</b> (nylon) <b>plastics</b> and is soluble in water, the disposal of NBBS-containing plastics in landfill sites could result in NBBS appearing in the leachate. Further, NBBS could also be leached from packaging into their contents. To allow us to examine the risks posed by NBBS in the environment, we have developed a quantitative assay for this compound. The assay employs a one-step extraction into dichloromethane followed by gas chromatography with accurate mass selected ion recording. The assay incorporates [t 3 C 6]NBBS as an internal standard to allow precise quantitation, and four separate ion chromatograms are recorded. NBBS was found in some Australian domestic solid-waste landfill leachate (from less than 0. 3 to 94. 6 ng/mL), but ground water in the vicinity of a landfill had only trace quantities of NBBS. NBBS was also quantitated in some bottled and cask wines, and levels varied from not detected to 2. 17 ng/mL (n = 14). Additional studies are required to assess the public health risks {{associated with the use of}} NBBS as a plasticizer...|$|R

30|$|Gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA), a {{building}} block of the biodegradable <b>plastic</b> <b>polyamide</b> 4, is synthesized from glucose by Corynebacterium glutamicum that expresses Escherichia coli glutamate decarboxylase (GAD) B encoded by gadB. This strain was engineered to produce GABA more efficiently from biomass-derived sugars. To enhance GABA production further {{by increasing the}} intracellular concentration of its precursor glutamate, we focused on engineering pknG (encoding serine/threonine protein kinase G), which controls the activity of 2 -oxoglutarate dehydrogenase (Odh) in the tricarboxylic acid cycle branch point leading to glutamate synthesis. We succeeded in expressing GadB in a C. glutamicum strain harboring a deletion of pknG. C. glutamicum strains GAD and GAD ∆pknG were cultured in GP 2 medium containing 100  g L− 1 glucose and 0.1  mM pyridoxal 5 ′-phosphate. Strain GAD∆pknG produced 31.1 [*]±[*] 0.41  g L− 1 (0.259  g L− 1  h− 1) of GABA in 120  hours, representing a 2.29 -fold higher level compared with GAD.

40|$|There {{has been}} a growing {{interest}} in producing polymers from bio-based resources as alternatives for fossil resources. One {{of the most common}} engineering <b>plastics,</b> <b>polyamides,</b> can be produced from monomers of fossil or renewable origin, such as renewable oils and fats The major drawbacks of polyamides include low molecular weight and poor water stability. The aim of this thesis was to synthesize and characterize long aliphatic segment polyamides by using long chain aliphatic dicarboxylic acids as monomers.. A further objective was to synthesize and characterize novel sulphur-containing polyamides. The monomer of sulfur-containing polyamide was prepared from 10 -undecenoic acid via thiol-ene addition reaction. All polyamides were synthesised via polycondenzation. All long aliphatic polyamides were synthesized successfully with high molecular weight ranges from 37 000 - 54 000 g/mol. Crucial factors necessary for obtaining high-molecular weight polyamides were identified. The water stabilities of novel polyamides were superior to commercial counterparts, while the presence of sulphur within the polyamide chain enhanced chemical resistance measured as reduced solubility in a range of solvents. All prepared polyamides were fully characterized (NMR, DSC, DMA, Tensile Test, and TGA) and the results of these investigations will be discussed within this thesis. The thermal analyses of these polyamides revealed melting points in the range from 128 to 207 oC which are rather low compared to the commercial polyamides, Nylon 6 or Nylon 6 / 6, while the thermal degradation temperature was enhanced...|$|R
50|$|The {{concentration}} of {{efforts in the}} 50’s of XX c. {{on the development of}} fertilising track did not mean one-sided modernisation of the factory. In that period, the preparations for further development were started, aiming to broaden the range of products and implement modern and highly refined products. In 1952-1953 the installation for methanol synthesis was built and launched on the basis of experiences from the half-technological installation existing in the Research Laboratory since 1934. The produced methanol was the material for formalin and methenamine in the newly constructed and launched installations in that period. In 1953 the first organic product was started to produce on the technological scale - formalin, with capability of 4500 tons per year. Both ammonia intensification as well as the formalin installation were the investments designed and performed independently. The next milestone to change in the productive profile of the company was the start of the construction of the installation of the caprolactam, a half-product to <b>polyamide</b> fibre and <b>plastic</b> production. Year 1957, the anniversary and thirtieth year in the history of “Mościce” was called “the year of great launches”. In addition to the launch of the caprolactam plant, a new mercury salt electrolysis with capacity of 18000 tons per year was commissioned. The intensification of production and construction of new installations caused the increase in demand of the plants for steam and electric power, which could not be obtained by the intensification of the existing heat and power plant (EC I). The decision on construction of a new heat and power plant with capacity of 50 MW with possibility of further development was made. The new heat and power plan (so-called EC II) was built in years 1954-1958. The first stage of the EC II construction was the installation of three steam boilers and two bleeding-condensing turbines.|$|R
