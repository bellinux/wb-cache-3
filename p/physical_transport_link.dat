5000|$|BICC {{signaling}} {{messages are}} {{nearly identical to}} those in ISDN User Part (ISUP); the main difference being that the narrowband circuit identification code (CIC) has been modified. The BICC architecture consists of interconnected serving nodes that provide the call service function and the bearer control function. The call service function uses BICC signaling for call setup and may also interwork with ISUP. The bearer control function receives directives from the call service function via BICC Bearer Control Protocol (ITU-T recommendation Q.1950) and is responsible for setup and teardown of bearer paths {{on a set of}} <b>physical</b> <b>transport</b> <b>links.</b> <b>Transport</b> <b>links</b> are most commonly Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) or Internet Protocol (IP).|$|R
