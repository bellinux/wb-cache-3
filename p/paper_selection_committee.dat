40|$|Rethinking Comprehensive Design = the 19 th International Conference on Computer-Aided Architectural Design Research in Asia (CAADRIA 2014) - emphasises a cross-disciplinary {{context to}} {{challenge}} the mainstream culture of computational design in architecture. It aims to (re) explore the potential of computational design methods and technologies in architecture from a holistic perspective. The conference provides an international forum where academics and practitioners share their novel research development and reflection for defining the future of computation in architectural design. Hosted by the Department of Design, Engineering and Management at the Kyoto Institute of Technology, CAADRIA 2014 presents 88 peer-reviewed full papers {{from all over the}} world. These high-quality research papers are complimented by 34 short work-in-progress papers submitted for the poster session of the conference. The conference proceedings were produced by a motivated team of volunteers from the CAADRIA community through an extensive collaboration. The 88 full papers rigorously double-blind reviewed by the dedicated International Review Committee (consisting of 74 experts), testify to CAADRIA's highly respectable international standing. Call for abstracts sent out in July 2013 attracted 298 submissions. They were initially reviewed by the <b>Paper</b> <b>Selection</b> <b>Committee</b> who accepted 198 abstracts for further development. Of these, 118 full papers were eventually submitted in the final stage. Each submitted paper was then assessed by at least two members of the International Review Committee. Following the reviewers' recommendations, 91 papers were accepted by the conference, of which 88 are included in this volume and for presentation in CAADRIA 2014. Collectively, these 88 papers define Rethinking Comprehensive Design in terms of the following research streams: Shape Studies; User Participation in Design; Human-Computer Interaction; Digital Fabrication and Construction; Computational Design Analysis; New Digital Design Concepts and Strategies; Practice-Based and Interdisciplinary Computational Design Research; Collaborative and Collective Design; Generative, Parametric and Evolutionary Design; Design Cognition and Creativity; Virtual / Augmented Reality and Interactive Environments; Computational Design Research and Education; and Theory, Philosophy and Methodology of Computational Design Research. In the following pages, you will find a wide range of scholarly papers organised under these streams that truly capture the quintessence of the research concepts. This volume will certainly inspire you and facilitate your journey in Rethinking Comprehensive Design...|$|E
