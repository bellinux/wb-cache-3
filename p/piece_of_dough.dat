2500|$|The Rabbis, {{seeking to}} {{preserve}} the commandment of separating a portion of bread (challah) for the priests in [...] created a symbolic observance under which {{a small portion of}} each batch of dough is to be twisted off and burned in an open flame.

2500|$|For the Shabbat Mevarchim {{preceding}} Rosh Chodesh Iyar—i.e., first Shabbat {{after the}} end of the Jewish holiday of Passover—there is a custom of baking schlissel challah ("key challah") as a segula (propitious sign) for parnassa (livelihood). Some make an impression of a key on top of the challah before baking, some place a key-shaped <b>piece</b> <b>of</b> <b>dough</b> on top of the challah before baking, and some bake an actual key inside the challah. The earliest written source for this custom is the sefer Ohev Yisrael by Rabbi Avraham Yehoshua Heshel, the Apter Rav, written in the 1800s. He calls schlissel challah [...] "an ancient custom," [...] and offers several kabbalistic interpretations. He [...] writes that after spending forty years in the desert, the Israelites continued to eat the manna until they brought the Omer offering on the second day of Passover. From that day on, they no longer ate manna, but food that had grown in the Land of Israel. Since they now had to start worrying about their sustenance rather than having it handed to them each morning, the key on the challah is a form of prayer to God to open up the gates of livelihood.|$|E
