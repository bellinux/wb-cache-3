The new engine includes other features, {{but not all of}} them are accessible by Vocaloid 2 and Vocaloid 3 vocals.

Cross-synthesis was also added, allowing the user to switch between two of a character's vocals built for the same language smoothly using a time-varying parameter. This feature is accessible when using Vocaloid 3 and Vocaloid 4 vocals, but not Vocaloid 2. Cross-synthesis only works with vocals from the same character, making use with packages like VY1v4 possible, but not packages such as Anon and Kanon.

Finally, real-time input has been included in this version and is another feature which all vocals can use.

We propose a novel method for decomposing <b>pitch</b> <b>curves,</b> {{based on the}} assumption that accent curves can be described by combining skewed normal distributions and sigmoid functions. In contrast to an earlier pitch decomposition algorithm (“PRISM”), this allows for simple joint optimization of phrase and accent curve parameters, using fewer parameters. The proposed method was evaluated on three speech corpora containing: (1) synthetically generated <b>pitch</b> <b>curves,</b> (2) all-sonorant utterances, and (3) utterances containing both sonorant and non-sonorant speech sounds.

40|$|Conventional {{rotary engine}} designs {{are based on}} an epitrochoidal housing bore that is found by {{the path of the}} point at the rotor profile's apex. To seal the engine, the rotor apexes are {{replaced}} by spring-loaded apex seals that slide along the housing bore during rotation. The conventional designs are limited to the point-based epitrochoid housing profiles and cannot incorporate the profile of the apex seal. This dissertation presents the complete theory and algorithm of the deviation function (DF) method of rotary engine design. This method is based on conjugate pair design and generates new engine profiles from generating curves. The DF method of rotary engine design by apex seal profile is introduced and developed for generating new profile designs in which the housing profile conforms to the apex seal profile, for better sealing. The DF method of design by geometric parameters is developed to select profiles using the standard rotary engine geometry. Maximum theoretical compression ratio and swept area are two criteria that have a range of possible DF-designed profile solutions. For the apex seal design and selection process, a sealing index is defined and a multi-apex-sealing grid is developed to further improve apex sealing. The DF method of rotary engine design is extended to noncircular <b>pitch</b> <b>curves,</b> for generating more new profiles that incorporate a variable speed ratio between the rotor and main shaft. By using the DF method, a larger variety of engine profiles is available to meet multiple design criteria and allow more flexibility in the design process. Some example deviation functions are provided for process illustration and design development. Engine profile designs and methods using circular <b>pitch</b> <b>curves</b> are developed using both arc-based and nonarc-based apex seal profiles. Engine profile designs with noncircular <b>pitch</b> <b>curves</b> are developed using the arc-based seal profile...|$|R

30|$|This {{paper has}} {{proposed}} an SVM-based regression model for estimating the {{blade pitch angle}} curve. The estimated SVR <b>pitch</b> <b>curve</b> follows the standard variations, though {{due to the lack}} of data points in above rated wind speed, its accuracy suffers. This highlights how the quality and quantity of data points significantly affects the SVR model prediction accuracy. SVR is then compared with the conventional approach based on a binned <b>pitch</b> <b>curve</b> together with individual bin probability distributions to identify operational anomalies. This comparative study yielded significant results. The SVR blade <b>pitch</b> <b>curve</b> closely follows the binned <b>pitch</b> <b>curve,</b> but above rated wind speed, there are fewer SCADA data values available and, as a result, the SVR curve is less well determined with some mismatch with the binned <b>pitch</b> <b>curve.</b> The major issue associated with wind turbine condition monitoring is to detect a fault or failure as soon as possible and with limited computational time and processing power so that catastrophic damage due to failure can be prevented with a cost-effective approach. The comparative analysis illustrates the strengths and weaknesses of these techniques in context to anomaly detection and model uncertainty. This should support a wind farm operator in selecting the best method for wind turbine condition monitoring.|$|E

30|$|The {{unexpected}} {{failure of}} wind turbine components leads to significant downtime {{and loss of}} revenue. To prevent this, supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) based condition monitoring is considered as a cost-effective approach. In several studies, the wind turbine power curve {{has been used as}} a critical indicator for power performance assessment. In contrast, the application of the blade pitch angle curve has hardly been explored for wind turbine condition monitoring purposes. The blade pitch angle curve describes the nonlinear relationship between pitch angle and hub height wind speed and can be used for the detection of faults. A support vector machine (SVM) is an improved version of an artificial neural networks (ANN) and is widely used for classification- and regression-related problems. Support vector regression is a data-driven approach based on statistical learning theory and a structural risk minimization principle which provides useful nonlinear system modeling. In this paper, a support vector regression (a nonparametric machine learning approach)-based <b>pitch</b> <b>curve</b> is presented and its application to anomaly detection explored for wind turbine condition monitoring. A radial basis function (RBF) was used as the kernel function for effective SVR blade <b>pitch</b> <b>curve</b> modeling.

Parameter ɛ controls the width of the ɛ-insensitive zone, used to fit the training data sets.

In short, both C and ɛ affect SVR model performance and hence it is necessary to find optimal values for these parameters using appropriate optimization techniques. The calculation of ɛ and C is based on the nature of input datasets and choice of kernel.

The 13.349 is a rescaling factor (that quantifies the statistical dispersion in a set of numerical data) that reflects the change from interquartile range to standard deviation.

In this paper, an optimal active power control method is proposed to maximize the energy production of wind farms by considering the wake effect and the lifetime of wind turbine. It starts with the analysis of the <b>pitch</b> angle <b>curve</b> and active power curve seen from the Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) of individual wind turbines.

Afterwards, considering the lifetime of wind turbines, a comparison is offered between the MPPT method and the MPG method for energy production using a simplified two-turbine wind farm as an example. Due to the small range of the effective wake area, it is found that the energy production is almost the same. Finally, the <b>pitch</b> angle <b>curve</b> and active power curve are optimized according to the Maximum Energy Production (MEP) of a wind farm.
