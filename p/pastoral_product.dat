40|$|Abstract: For {{the purpose}} of {{contributing}} {{to the establishment of}} optimized eco-productive paradigm, a new layout of land use of the Loess Plateau was carried out and the associated forage potential was estimated. Results indicated that the percentages of the area of grassland, woodland, basic farmland and orchard to the total productive land area were 44 %, 22 %, 20 % and 14 % respectively according to this new land use scenario. Based on the datasets of 197 counties in the Loess Plateau, the estimated forage potential would amount to 104 881 028 ton/a (hay), which can raise 104 881 028 productivity sheep unit/ a. According to the unchanged price in 1999, pastoral gross product value would amount to 52 440. 51 million yuan RMB/a, which is as much as 5. 3 times of that in 1999 and exceeds the agricultural gross product in 1999 by 14 %. In addition, there are ca. 59 % of counties whose mean <b>pastoral</b> <b>product</b> value per person would be more than 1 000 yuan RMB/a, while ca. 41 % of counties whose mean <b>pastoral</b> <b>product</b> value per person would be less than 1 000 yuan RMB/a. On the other hand, the estimated agricultural gross product on the Loess Plateau would amount to 11 472 2. 34 million yuan RMB/a and ca. 46 % of the total would come from pastoral industry, 27 % from orchid industry, 14 % from forestry and 13 % from farmland. From the perspective both ecologically and economically, this paper holds that the herbi-vore-based pas-toral industry is a promising industry bolstering the ecological improvement and economical developmen...|$|E
50|$|The {{residents}} of Sukhnah {{were linked to}} the different tribes in the region through various hierarchical economic ties. They paid the levy on their grain harvest to the Sba'a, who in return protected their trade. They also consigned their sheep flocks to the 'Umur and the Hadidiyin. To all these tribes, al-Sukhnah's residents supplied grain, cloth, clothing, and various household items and foodstuffs, while purchasing from them <b>pastoral</b> <b>products</b> for resale to Syria's large cities. Today, al-Sukhnah has become a minor industrial center for natural gas.|$|R
50|$|The rite was a reaffirmation of the {{alliance}} {{among members of the}} Latin League, and a truce was honored throughout the festival. Each Latin city sent a representative and offerings such as sheep, cheese, or other <b>pastoral</b> <b>products.</b> The presiding Roman consul offered a libation of milk, and conducted the sacrifice of a pure white heifer that had never been yoked. The flesh was consumed as part of a communal meal as a sacrament. As part of the festivities, the figurines called oscilla were hung from trees.|$|R
50|$|The Hanns {{arrived with}} their stock at Bluff Downs in February 1863 after an epic {{overland}} journey of six months. During {{the next two}} years they were occupied with establishing their stations. Despite their venture into beef, wool production was still a priority so Joseph began replacing cattle with sheep at the earliest opportunity. The decision to restock with sheep was probably a sound one, made for practical reasons. Unlike other <b>pastoral</b> <b>products</b> wool could be stored without spoiling and was relatively light to transport, while meat, the principal product of cattle could not be stored.|$|R
50|$|Near the coast, {{the region}} {{receives}} relatively high rainfall and mild temperatures, and its 150 km of coastline {{is a significant}} tourist area. In contrast, the eastern fringe is very arid, and is mainly used for pastoral farming of sheep. Mining of gold, nickel and iron ore also occurs. The remainder of the region is highly suited to agriculture, and {{is the source of}} nearly two thirds of the state's wheat production, half of its wool production, and the majority of its lamb and mutton, oranges, honey, cut flowers and a range of other agricultural and <b>pastoral</b> <b>products.</b>|$|R
30|$|Another {{important}} {{obstacle to}} diversification into the dairy trade is market exclusion, {{for which there}} are two reasons. Firstly, the main potential for pastoral dairying is an informal market serving high urban demand; however, pastoralists in remote areas simply {{do not have access}} to this market. Secondly, the entire trade in <b>pastoral</b> dairy <b>products</b> faces stiff competition from imported powdered milk and intensive, peri-urban dairy farms. This competition tends to reduce demand for <b>pastoral</b> dairy <b>products</b> that are viewed as unhygienic in comparison. The lack of demand is a very important constraint to market access as well as to any prospects for its improvement. Demand for <b>pastoral</b> dairy <b>products</b> has been identified as the limiting factor to market participation and as an important pre-requisite for interventions designed to increase market access for pastoralists, e.g. establishment of milk collection centres and improved road network (Michael [1987]; Little [1989]). Since income from the pastoral dairy trade is controlled by women, this also has serious implications for gender empowerment and household economics.|$|R

Before a suitable site could be secured, the first Townsville Show was held in 1880 with agricultural and <b>pastoral</b> <b>products</b> displayed in the Botanical Gardens reserve and industrial and horticultural exhibits at the School of Arts.|$|R

5000|$|After {{long periods}} of {{stagnation}} under Ottoman rule, Homs started to flourish again in the 20th century.

30|$|To {{measure the}} extent to which <b>pastoral</b> <b>products</b> are {{available}} for consumption or sale within this population, we developed a survey technique called Herd Distribution Mapping. This technique quantitatively maps changes in herd composition and distribution for study households within each of the group ranches.

Each participating family was visited once a month where possible (either at the homestead where herds were directly observed and counted or at their dry season camp) and interviewed about the age, sex, and species composition of their complete herd, both those located at the permanent homestead and those out with affines or at dry season grazing zones.|$|R
50|$|Signed in 1839, the RAC-HBC Agreement {{created an}} {{understanding}} between the Russian-American Company and the Hudson's Bay Company.

The lease was renewed until the end of Russian America. This lease was later brought up by the Province of British Columbia as bearing upon its own territorial interests in the region, but was ignored by Ottawa and London.|$|R
40|$|The paper {{addresses}} the major {{premise of the}} arid and semi-arid lands (ASAL) program in Kenya which states that increased crop production in the semi-arid areas {{will lead to a}} reduction in livestock numbers since dependence on livestock for subsistence needs will be reduced. Theoretical support for this position derives from a "school of thought" in pastoral studies which posits that indigenous livestock production systems in Eastern Africa are maintained mainly for the purpose of supplying a steady source of food (i. e., <b>pastoral</b> <b>products)</b> for the <b>pastoral</b> population. Evidence from Njemps Location, Baringo District suggests that while increased crop production has substituted grain for <b>pastoral</b> <b>products</b> in the diet, it has not undermined the role of livestock as a form of investment. It is further argued that a focus on "statistical" averages in livestock holdings, rather than the range and variation in property ownership, informs development planners little about which group or groups of livestock owners will respond to increased opportunities for agriculture. Capital and labour requirements for irrigated agriculture in Njemps are such that the wealthier livestock owners are the individuals which are most capable of taking advantage of crop production opportunities. The dilemma in Njemps Location arises {{due to the fact that}} groups of livestock owners are responding to irrigated agriculture for different reasons: the rich pastoralists are investing in agriculture as a mechanism for supporting their livestock holdings, while the poorer families are being forced into agriculture out of necessity to meet subsistence needs and these latter households have only a minimal impact on the livestock sector. Because of this second group of households it is argued that crop production, especially low cost methods of dry land farming, should be encouraged in Njemps Location, but should not be perceived as a mechanism for supporting range management programs...|$|R
30|$|Baxter (1954) {{reports that}} the Waso pastoralists recall moments of {{prosperity}} when a few individuals ‘even became too foolish’ and forgot that living in a risky environment required personal moderation. 10 Like other pastoralists in the NFD, the Waso Borana {{had to deal with}} a highly variable environment, characterised by a ‘boom’ in production during wet years, when there was a surplus of <b>pastoral</b> <b>products,</b> and a ‘slump’ during drought years, when production declined. A common view among the herd owners we interviewed was that in the pre-shifta period, the gap between {{the rich and the poor}} was minimal because of the high livestock holdings per household that created self-sufficiency. However, this state of pastoral well-being changed during and after the shifta war. We interrogated the communities' perceptions.|$|R
50|$|Beginning in {{the late}} Mamluk period in the 15th-century, Aleppo {{developed}} links with the surrounding countryside through the Bab al-Nairab area. It served as the initial destination point for agricultural and <b>pastoral</b> <b>products</b> from the surrounding villages before being transported to the city's markets. During the Ottoman era, local peasants and Bedouins settled Bab al-Nairab, which had developed into a quarter. Many of the peasants had been uprooted from the countryside, while the Bedouin were semi-sedentary nomads {{who lived in the}} district during winter. Although Bab al-Nairab's generally poor population was Muslim, it was also ethnically diverse, including Arabs, Kurds and Turkmen. Along with Banqusa, Bab al-Nairab {{became one of the most}} powerful quarters of Aleppo, where the countryside immigrants and the merchants of the caravan trade held sway and could influence the public order as well as the urban tax system.|$|R
50|$|The Australian Estates {{building}} represents {{two important}} {{stages in the}} development of Rockhampton as a prosperous commercial centre. The Canoona gold rush of 1858 helped establish Rockhampton as the major port in the region which later handled the mineral and <b>pastoral</b> <b>products</b> that came increasingly from the western settlements. Quay Street was one of the earliest parts of Rockhampton to be settled and it developed in a commercial capacity to serve the passing trade at the wharves which once stood across the road from the buildings. Quay Street developed rapidly from 1858-1882, with the construction in 1867 of the Central Western railway westward from Rockhampton increasing the flow of goods passing through the port. Very few buildings survive from this pre-1882 period and the former Australian Estates building is an example of early commercial development in Quay Street and Rockhampton.|$|R
40|$|Abstract: We provide annual {{estimates}} of agricultural output for England {{over the period}} 1250 – 1450. The data are extracted largely from manorial accounts but checked against tithe records for the non-demesne sector where possible. We provide separate estimates for the output of individual arable and <b>pastoral</b> <b>products,</b> and combine them into an aggregate agricultural output series. This is combined with {{estimates of}} population and the agricultural labour force to {{provide an overview of}} the path of agricultural labour productivity. Estimates from the output side are cross-checked against estimates from the income side and per capita consumption of calories. English agriculture responded positively to the crises of the fourteenth century, with agricultural labour productivity increasing substantially across the Black Death, in line with an increase in agricultural real wages. With rising living standards, the share of pastoral farming increased at the expense of arable farming...|$|R
50|$|In 1516 Homs was {{incorporated}} into the Ottoman Empire and consequently suffered a greater political eclipse, but it continued to thrive as an economic center, processing the agricultural and <b>pastoral</b> <b>products</b> that flowed to it from surrounding districts. Homs was particularly well known for silk and wool weaving, especially the alaja, which was mottled muslin run through with gold threads and used in feminine apparel. This silk was exported {{as far as the}} Ottoman capital Istanbul. In addition to weaving industries, there were olive oil presses and water mills for wheat and sesame, while grapes and rice, grown in the surrounding marshlands from the 16th century, were found in abundance in the city's markets. Moreover, the markets of Homs were the center of a trade in livestock, where flocks of sheep and goats coming from Aleppo met camels and cattle moving north from Damascus.|$|R
40|$|Europeans {{restricted}} their fertility {{long before}} {{other parts of}} the world did so. By raising the marriage age of women, and ensuring that a substantial proportion remained celibate, the "European Marriage Pattern" (EMP) reduced childbirths by up to 40 %. We analyze the rise of this first socio-economic institution in history that limited fertility through delayed marriage. Our model emphasizes changes in agricultural production following the Black Death. The production of meat, wool, and dairy (<b>pastoral</b> <b>products)</b> increased, while grain production declined. Women had a comparative advantage producing pastoral goods. They often worked as servants in husbandry, where they remained unmarried long after they had left the parental household. In a Malthusian world, this translated into lower population pressure, raising average wages by up to a quarter. The Black Death thus set into motion a virtuous circle of higher wages and fertility decline that underpinned Europe’s high per capita incomes. We demonstrate the importance of this effect in a calibration of our model...|$|R
40|$|Europeans {{restricted}} their fertility {{long before}} the Demographic Transition. By raising the marriage age of women and ensuring that a substantial proportion remained celibate, the "European Marriage Pattern" (EMP) reduced childbirths by up to one third between the 14 th and 18 th century. In a Malthusian environment, this translated into lower population pressure, raising average wages significantly, which in turn facilitated industrialization. We analyze the rise of this first socio-economic institution in history that limited fertility through delayed marriage. Our model emphasizes changes in agricultural production following the Black Death in 1348 - 50. The land-intensive production of <b>pastoral</b> <b>products</b> increased in relative importance. Using detailed data from England after 1290, we show that women had a comparative advantage in livestock farming. They often worked as servants in husbandry, where they remained unmarried until their mid-twenties. Where pastoral agriculture dominated, marriage occurred markedly later. Overall, we estimate that pastoral farming raised female age at first marriage by more than 4 years. ...|$|R
30|$|As such, we {{hypothesize that}} some <b>pastoral</b> <b>products</b> {{are used for}} {{subsistence}} and others for sale in a local or regional market. We predict that weekly or bi-monthly regional markets {{are the most common}} source of market engagement. Pastoral actors bring their local products to market (milk, skins, whole animals) seeking to sell them for cash rather than exchange via trade. We predict this cash is then used to purchase much needed food items, basic needs, and health care. Sellers in effect should act as currency exchangers for rural producers who have no access to banking, allowing them to convert their <b>products</b> of <b>pastoral</b> production into cash to purchase non-pastoral goods. Since livestock sellers in theory gain cash in the local market and then use it to purchase goods from regional sellers, these pastoral actors effectively take currency out of rotation in their own local community and redistribute it back to urban centres, thereby tethering pastoral actors to agricultural and urban actors to generate capital for basic needs.|$|R
25|$|In 1890, the Government in Saint Petersburg {{concluded}} Anglo-Russian {{relations in}} the Pacific to have become important enough to appoint a career diplomat to represent Russian interests in the Australian Colonies.

30|$|The authors {{describe}} {{in great detail}} the sources of income, access to livestock, sources of cash, expenditures and marketing of <b>pastoral</b> <b>products</b> and thus provide great insight into the different livelihood strategies that pastoral households pursue in search of economic security. One of the main findings {{is that there is}} considerable inequality, even though there are no major differences in terms of the livelihood diversification between poorer and wealthier households. The main difference between the poor and wealthy is that the latter get much greater returns from the same activities. As a result, households with more cash can spend more on education and healthcare, which increases the value of their human capital and further increases inequality within these rural communities. The findings suggest that the economy of scale may play a role and {{that there may be a}} threshold effect, which means that households with fewer livestock and less cash income are unlikely to overcome poverty. The question is whether households in the “moving from” group, some of which are under this threshold, will be able to achieve sustainable livelihoods using a combination of cash and pastoral income.|$|R

The HBC spent several years pressuring the British government to secure indemnities from the RAC on Russia for damages relating to the seizure and actions contrary to the treaty of 1825, Baron von Wrangel was forced out of office in disgrace because of the great cost in both money and prestige to the Empire. A treaty signed in 1839, known as the RAC-HBC Agreement, established the privilege for the HBC to build and maintain posts at the mouths of the Taku and Stikine as well as established a lease of the mainland and adjoining islands - the lisière from Cross Sound south to 54 degrees 40 minutes north. In return for this lease, the HBC would supply so many furs per annum to the RAC and supply the Russian American settlements with equipment, agricultural and <b>pastoral</b> <b>products.</b> Creating the subsidiary Puget Sound Agricultural Company to met these provisions, HBC stations such as Forts Vancouver, Langley, Nisqually and Cowlitz were critical for manufacturing the produce required by the Russians.|$|R
40|$|Current {{intensified}} {{livestock production}} threatens global biodiversity and food security. Increasing {{the use of}} semi-natural, species-rich grasslands for grazing and hay-making {{could serve as a}} way to bridge biodiversity conservation and livestock production but we know little about the nutritional composition of native grasslands. To determine the effect of grassland biodiversity on forage quality and the potential benefits and limitations of using conservation grasslands for agriculture, I conducted ecological and ethnobotanical research at 30 grassland sites in Oxfordshire, England. Species-richness and composition increased forage dry matter, sugar, and Phosphorus (P) content. Forage from species-rich grasslands contained up to 27 % more protein, 56 % more Phosphorus (P), 106 % more Potassium (K), and 183 % more Calcium (Ca) than cereals and conventional hay and met the nutritional requirements of beef cattle, sheep, and horses. Farmers and graziers valued species-rich grasslands were (1) the medicinal effect of specific grassland plants on livestock, (2) affordability, (3) the resilience of species-rich grasslands to drought and flooding, (4) conservation, and (5) marketability of <b>pastoral</b> <b>products.</b> The main factors inhibiting the (continued or increased) agricultural use of species-rich grasslands were restrictions on time of grazing, restrictions on time of hay-cut, and reduced grassland yield and forage quality due to recent increases in invasive plants. More flexible agro-environmental guidelines around species-rich grassland use are necessary to balance the agricultural as well as ecological value of these landscapes...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: In {{many regions}} {{around the world}} the {{pastoral}} economy shifted from subsistence-oriented to a market-oriented production. Pastoral goods acquired monetary value and became a market commodity that entailed changes in the production system and in the attitude towards livestock. O n the Tibetan plateau this shift did not follow a linear way. Until the 1950 s, most consumption requirements could be satisfied with animal products. Economic exchange relations were essential to provide grain requirements, at least for those households who relied exclusively on animal husbandry. During the Mao era, animal husbandry {{was carried out in}} line with state targets and the produce was delivered according to central planning. In the late 1970 s the transition towards a market-oriented production began. This paper discusses the recent reactions of pastoralists to the new realities in one specific area on the eastern Tibetan plateau. This shift from <b>pastoral</b> <b>products</b> to market commodities, the commercial network established as well as the market places for pastoral produce, are examined in this paper. These facts show that the pastoralists in question successfully market their produce. The research area, Dzoge county, is located on the eastern border area of the Tibetan plateau, where different ethnic groups live in proximity to each other. Grassland predominates the landscape, used by nomads as pastures for livestock breeding (yak, sheep and horses). Mobile animal husbandry and the marketing of the livestock products are decisive to guarantee the livelihood {{of the majority of the}} population...|$|R
5000|$|The {{agreement}} was continuously renewed, although with several modifications {{made over the}} years which followed. A different version was agreed by both companies and came into force on 3 April 1849. This commercial agreement saw the termination of the PSAC, providing agricultural and <b>pastoral</b> <b>products</b> to New Archangel. Encroachment by American settlers on company property after the Oregon Treaty, combined with the California Gold Rush, left Fort Cowlitz and Fort Nisqually understaffed and greatly reduced operational abilities. Despite Fort Langley and Fort Victoria producing much of the wheat quota for Russian America after 1846, the British could not meet the Russians' need for food. The RAC board of directors found the HBC stance {{for an end to}} supplying the Russian posts to be [...] "based on quite valid reasons." [...] Additionally, the Russian authorities claimed exclusive rights to the timber, fisheries, and ice within the portion of the Alaska Panhandle occupied by the HBC, to allow further agreements with other companies for exploitation of resources. After the Fraser Gold Rush, numerous small merchants began operating within the HBC concession, undercutting the British fur trading efforts. During the 1860s the Labouchere operated within the leased area. In 1862 the HBC governing board complained to their Russian counterparts that they did not [...] "afford us any protection and the whole Territory is just as free to Petty Traders who pay no rent..." [...] Despite this economic competition and declining profits, the HBC signed the renewed protocols.|$|R

30|$|This rural {{economy will}} be {{discussed}} using the conventional tripartite division of an economic system: production, distribution and consumption (see Gudeman [2001]). However, the concept of economic system in Soqotra is problematic given {{the absence of a}} market mechanism to integrate the internal articulation between these three constitutive components. Soqotra's economy can be divided into two spatially delimited domains of economic activity with minimal overlapping spheres: the first domain, the rural economy, encompasses the subsistence activities in the hinterland, which is the geographically preponderant part of the island where needs satisfaction is the dominant value orientation, and is characterized by the absence of market-oriented production. The second domain, the urban economy, encompasses the coastal strips of the island - especially the north where the only market place (i.e., Hadiboh town) is located - and constitutes the only domain where market-dependent economic activity takes place (e.g., fishing) and where the exchange of commodities for a profit is the dominant value orientation. The discussion below is concerned primarily with the traditional or rural sector of Soqotra's economy, which represents the livelihood infrastructure of a significant proportion, if not a majority, of Soqotrans and that has persisted - although in successively modified form - under the different political regimes and their economic policies as summarized in the introduction. This rural economic sector is descriptively analysed in terms of three dimensions: (a) production, which entails an artisanal `mode of use' of local resources; (b) distribution, which is underpinned by a subsistence ethic that constrains production for market exchange and thus restrains the market supply of <b>pastoral</b> <b>products,</b> and (c) consumption, which is characterized by a frugality that is tantamount to a situation of chronic nutritional insufficiency. Noteworthy is that the production-distribution-consumption nexus encompasses the three key phases in the social reproduction cycle of any livelihood system, and their vagaries provide a barometer of the sustainability of pastoralism in Soqotra in the long-term.|$|R
30|$|The {{semi-nomadic}} pastoral {{system and}} mixed arable-livestock farming (mainly of sheep and goats) were possibly predominant {{in almost all}} of ancient Greece. Although ancient settlements have been discovered at high altitudes on the Pindus mountains, whether large scale nomadic movements took place is disputed by some modern scholars (Papanastasis et al. 2010). Long-distance transhumance was absent since it required well-developed lowland agriculture, high demand for <b>pastoral</b> <b>products</b> and a politically unified territory, which did not exist at that time (Papanastasis et al. 2010). However, the ancient Graeco-Roman world contained a large variety of landscapes and socio-political conditions, such as forms of land ownership, which would support many different agro-pastoral systems. The Athenian city state was originally founded (twelfth century B.C.) by a tribal society composed of herdsmen, who practised communal livestock holding and pasturage, together with warriors who settled over a comparatively small territorial community. The manorial type of family, together {{with the concept of}} wealth, developed gradually and finally shaped social structure so that just before the fifth century B.C., all the land belonged to great landowners, such as the 'Attican Eupatrids' (Metaxas 1955). In Athens, the land ownership crisis was resolved with the arrival of Solon the 'lawgiver' (594 B.C.), who introduced legislation intended to help the peasants (Hammond 1961). Similarly, the reforms of Lycurgus of Sparta led also to a drastic redistribution of the Spartan land, while elsewhere, tyrants also undertook redistributions of land seized from wealthy political enemies. From the fourth century B.C. onwards, property started again to become concentrated among a few land owners, for example, according to Aristotle (384 to 322 B.C.), in Sparta, 'the land has passed into the hands of a few' (Politics, II, 1270 a). Nevertheless, the aristocratic estates in Greece never achieved the scope of the great Roman latifundia (White 1967). Xenophon's Economy (fourth century B.C.) provides information on agricultural issues at the time.|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{provides}} an overview of the social and entrepreneurial careers and strategies of merchants during the first modern “commercial” era, 1830 - 75. It examines merchants as migratory entrepreneurs during the integration of peripheral regions into the transatlantic economy via commerce, technology transfer, and ideology. Merchants organized, operated and expanded overseas commerce, importing textiles and exporting <b>pastoral</b> <b>products.</b> They used a variety of strategies and firm structures to discover and exploit niches in a competitive, developing market. They also influenced the process of economic development and state building as capitalists and risk-bearers, financing both production and politics. Based on archival material from diverse collections in both the United Kingdom and South America, the research offers a qualitative account of the entrepreneurial activities of the British merchant elite in Uruguay. It uses case studies of British immigrant entrepreneurs, whose privileged access to capital and technology allowed them to expand the market for imported products and to exploit upstream opportunities in modernizing export production. Uruguay’s distinctive institutional and geographical characteristics allowed merchants to access markets, maximize their social and political connections, and to hedge political and market risks. British merchants used Montevideo as an alternative regional port to Buenos Aires, and the implications of this opportunity have been underexplored in the literature. In establishing and expanding their operations in Uruguay, merchants gained region-specific capital in the form of geographically fixed upstream investments, market knowledge, and positions in elite networks. The social connections of Anglo-Uruguayan merchants were essential in providing resources and influence for their entrepreneurial activities, but were also their point of entry into the contest over the economy and polity of the River Plate region. British merchants’ incentives changed towards engagement in the political and ideological struggles of the Uruguayan civil war, the guerra grande of 1839 - 51, as they contested political outcomes by acting as suppliers, financiers, and lobbyists. This involvement created an AngloUruguayan subset of River Plate merchants, who went on in subsequent decades to reshape the economy through investment and entrepreneurship...|$|R
40|$|The {{subject of}} this thesis {{is the study of}} a {{pastoral}} community in its regional context. The research was undertaken in 1979 - 1980 in the peasant community of Tomas in the central highlands of Peru. It focussed on four main areas: the domestic economy, levels of cash income and expenditure, the historical context and the networks involved in the wool economy. The body of theory which has been used in the present work concerns peasant economy and its relationship with capitalist development. The concepts of economic activity fields and linkage analysis have been employed to form a framework for the analysis of the economic role of the household and its relationship with the peasant community and the regional economy. The research was undertaken by means of general participant observation and open-ended interviews with members of the community. In addition, a detailed study of the economies of 20 households was made through the medium of questionnaires on domestic production and consumption. Wider economic networks were followed up in order to investigate the relationships which all households have with the regional economy. Finally, historical depth was given to the research through the collection of personal life histories and case studies, {{as well as by the}} investigation of local, regional and national archives. The main conclusions of the thesis concern the recent orientation of domestic economy in Tomas. The commoditisation of <b>pastoral</b> <b>products</b> over many years has meant that almost all households have had long-term involvement in the cash economy. Lately, too, the diversification of the domestic economy in the face of communal and ecological constraints on pastoralism has led, for a growing number of households, to a decreasing reliance on communally controlled resources and a greater involvement in the wider regional economy. These tendencies indicate that, despite their physical isolation, the pastoralists of Tomas are fully integrated into the national economy of Peru...|$|R

Livestock herding in Inner Mongolia {{was incorporated into}} pastoral communes {{through the process of}} collectivization. Individual herdsmen were transferred into members of the people’s commune who own the grassland, herds, and other production tools (Da and Zheng 2010). <b>Pastoral</b> and agricultural <b>products</b> were produced at low costs, and a gradual modernization of animal husbandry took place. During this period, there were frequent reciprocal socioeconomic interactions between Inner Mongolia and inland China.|$|R
