25|$|In {{contrast}} to other controlled radical polymerizations (for example ATRP), a RAFT polymerization does not achieve controlled evolution of molecular weight and low <b>polydispersity</b> by reducing bi-radical termination events (although in some systems, these events {{may indeed be}} reduced somewhat, as outlined above), but rather, by ensuring that most polymer chains start growing at approximately {{the same time and}} experience equal growth during polymerization.|$|E
25|$|Reversible addition-fragmentation chain {{transfer}} or RAFT polymerization {{is one of}} several kinds of reversible-deactivation radical polymerization. It makes use of a {{chain transfer}} agent {{in the form of a}} thiocarbonylthio compound (or similar, from here on referred to as a RAFT agent, see Figure 1) to afford control over the generated molecular weight and <b>polydispersity</b> during a free-radical polymerization. Discovered at the Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation (CSIRO) of Australia in 1998, RAFT polymerization {{is one of several}} living or controlled radical polymerization techniques, others being atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP) and nitroxide-mediated polymerization (NMP), etc. RAFT polymerization uses thiocarbonylthio compounds, such as dithioesters, thiocarbamates, and xanthates, to mediate the polymerization via a reversible chain-transfer process. As with other controlled radical polymerization techniques, RAFT polymerizations can be performed with conditions to favor low dispersity (molecular weight distribution) and a pre-chosen molecular weight. RAFT polymerization can be used to design polymers of complex architectures, such as linear block copolymers, comb-like, star, brush polymers, dendrimers and cross-linked networks.|$|E
25|$|A {{variety of}} lab {{techniques}} {{are used to}} determine the properties of polymers. Techniques such as wide angle X-ray scattering, small angle X-ray scattering, and small angle neutron scattering are {{used to determine the}} crystalline structure of polymers. Gel permeation chromatography is used to determine the number average molecular weight, weight average molecular weight, and <b>polydispersity.</b> FTIR, Raman and NMR can be used to determine composition. Thermal properties such as the glass transition temperature and melting point can be determined by differential scanning calorimetry and dynamic mechanical analysis. Pyrolysis followed by analysis of the fragments is one more technique for determining the possible structure of the polymer. Thermogravimetry is a useful technique to evaluate the thermal stability of the polymer. Detailed analysis of TG curves also allow us to know a bit of the phase segregation in polymers. Rheological properties are also commonly used to help determine molecular architecture (molecular weight, molecular weight distribution and branching) as well as to understand how the polymer will process, through measurements of the polymer in the melt phase. Another polymer characterization technique is Automatic Continuous Online Monitoring of Polymerization Reactions (ACOMP) which provides real-time characterization of polymerization reactions. It can be used as an analytical method in R, as a tool for reaction optimization at the bench and pilot plant level and, eventually, for feedback control of full-scale reactors. ACOMP measures in a model-independent fashion the evolution of average molar mass and intrinsic viscosity, monomer conversion kinetics and, in the case of copolymers, also the average composition drift and distribution. It is applicable in the areas of free radical and controlled radical homo- and copolymerization, polyelectrolyte synthesis, heterogeneous phase reactions, including emulsion polymerization, adaptation to batch and continuous reactors, and modifications of polymers.|$|E

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{there have been}} many reports of methods for {{inferring}} the molecular weight distribution (MWD) of linear polymers from either viscosity data or dynamic data. This subject is of great interest in the polymer industry, since MWD affects the processing and final properties of polymers, and gel permeation chromatography (GPC), normally used for determining MWD, has several limitations. There are two main types of method for inferring the MWD from rheological data. The first one involves empirical transformations that lead directly to a MWD, whereas the second type involves the inversion of an integral that gives the relaxation modulus G(t) of a polydisperse polymer in terms of its MWD. A comparison of the reliabilities of these methods for use with samples having a wide variety of <b>polydispersities</b> is lacking, especially for materials with high <b>polydispersities.</b> This study presents a comparison of the MWD predictions of four of these techniques in terms of their performance with groups of HDPEs, LLDPEs and polypropylenes having <b>polydispersities</b> from two to six and various molecular weights. It was found that the viscosity transform (as modified by Wood-Adams) and a modified time-dependent diffusion reptation model proposed by des Cloizeaux (TDD-DR model) are, to a certain extent, satisfactory methods for use with polymers having moderate to high <b>polydispersities,</b> whereas the modulus transform is reliable only for narrow distributions...|$|R

Incorporation of acrylic acid into styrene was done by random copolymerization of acrylic acid (directly and in its protected form as tert-butyl acrylate) with styrene. Styrene/tert-butyl acrylate (S/t-BuA) as well as styrene/acrylic acid (S/AA) mixtures were copolymerized to form tapered or gradient copolymers. Using an alkoxyamine unimolecular initiator, 2 -[N- tert-butyl- 2, 2 -(dimethylpropyl) aminooxy] propionic acid (BlocBuilder RTM), along with additional free nitroxide (SG 1), the effect of acid protection on polymerization kinetics and copolymer composition was determined.

40|$|Biocompatible {{polymers}} {{based on}} 2 -methacryloyloxyethyl phosphorylcholine (MPC) have delivered clinically proven benefits in various biomedical applications. In a recent communication [Lobb, E. J.; et al. J. Am. Chem. Soc. 2001, 123, 7913 − 7914], we reported that MPC can be polymerized to high conversions in both water and methanol {{at ambient temperature}} via atom transfer radical polymerization (ATRP). Low <b>polydispersities</b> were obtained, but the living character of this polymerization was not thoroughly explored. In the present paper we report a more detailed optimization study of the ATRP of MPC. Excellent yields, first-order monomer kinetics, linear Mn vs conversion plots, and relatively narrow <b>polydispersities</b> (Mw/Mn = 1. 15 − 1. 35) were obtained in both aqueous and alcoholic media at 20 °C. However, slower polymerizations and narrower <b>polydispersities</b> were always obtained in alcoholic solution, and chain extension experiments indicated significantly greater living character (i. e., greater self-blocking efficiency) under these conditions. The rate of ATRP was significantly slower in 2 -propanol (IPA) than methanol due to the reduced polarity of the former solvent. However, acceptable rates of polymerization and reasonable control were obtained at elevated temperature in IPA. Alternatively, {{the addition of a}} relatively small amount of water to the IPA led to a significantly faster polymerization at ambient temperature. The effect of varying the ligand type and target DPn was also investigated. The best results were obtained using 2, 2 ‘-bipyridine for target DPn's of 20 − 200, with two alternative ligands giving either inferior control or slower rates of polymerization. Higher target DPn's resulted in significantly higher <b>polydispersities</b> even when using the 2, 2 ‘-bipyridine ligand. The spent ATRP catalyst was conveniently removed by treating aqueous solutions of MPC homopolymer with silica. This produced residual catalyst levels of less than 2 ppm, as measured by inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectrometry, which may be sufficiently low for some biomedical applications.

40|$|Shifts in the {{relative}} intensities of oligomer ions are found to accompany changes in the cone potential in the electrospray ion source, which introduce uncertainties into average molecular weight determinations for polymer distributions. Similar shifts with changes in cone potential have long been recognized in the multiple-charge distributions of proteins and other biomolecules, In the case of multiple-charge distributions of a single, or small number of, species there are no major consequences for calculation of molecular weight; however, mass distributions and the averages thereof, are of major concern with synthetic polymers and understanding the shifts in relative intensities becomes critically important, We report here {{an evaluation of the}} effects of cone potentials on the molecular weight distributions of synthetic polymers, which we compare with the ejects on charge-state distributions of peptides, The effects of cone potential have been modeled mathematically, from which we conclude that cone potentials exert a focusing effect dependent on the mass-to-charge ratios of ions. It is largely this focusing effect that determines the dependence of oligomer ion intensities upon cane potential in the ESI mass spectra of polymers. The influence of cone potential on molecular weight determinations of polymers of varying <b>polydispersities</b> (P-o) is compared and discussed. For polymers with low <b>polydispersities</b> (e. g., narrow molecular weight poly(ethyleneglycol) standards with P-o < 1. 5), the variation in molecular weight determinations tends to be small (typical < 5 %), whereas with synthetic polymers with <b>polydispersities</b> greater than 2, variations in cone potential can influence molecular weight determinations significantly (by 100 % or even more) ...|$|R
