5000|$|Michael Williams {{wrote in}} The Irish Times that the Court of Appeal was no {{substitute}} for a more fundamental reform of the Irish judicial system, which he said was unlikely as it would challenge the vested interests of lawyers. Mattie McGrath expressed a similar viewpoint {{and called for a}} No-vote. While Williams favours removing the one-judgment rule, he criticised the joining of that with the Court of Appeal in a single amendment requiring a single referendum. Seth Barrett Tillman, a lecturer in law at National University of Ireland, Maynooth, considered that, since the Court of Criminal Appeal had been created without a constitutional amendment, the same ought to be possible for a Civil Court of Appeal. Lawyer Paul Anthony McDermott suggested the delays in hearing cases were caused by too many litigants rather than too few judges or courts. Diarmuid Rossa Phelan, a prominent Irish barrister and law professor at the School of Law at Trinity College, Dublin, suggested that giving the Supreme Court absolute discretion to select which cases to hear was dangerous and would need to be monitored for mission creep. The Master of the High Court, Edmund Honohan, described the proposal as a [...] "crude device" [...] that would lead to an increase in litigation and in interlocutory appeals, and claimed the Supreme Court's backlog could be cleared by addressing [...] "case management, time management, <b>paper</b> <b>management,</b> submissions and so forth".|$|E

40|$|Abstract—Due to the {{increasing}} number of undergraduates, the management of academic papers, an important part of undergraduate education, is faced with more and more difficulties. First, previous academic papers fail to be assorted into valid data for reference, thus resulting in low management efficiency. Second, there are no strict standards for paper title selection and setting. Third, it is hard for supervisors to learn the research progress of every student, so supervisors give effective and immediate guidance and supervision. Against the backdrop, this paper puts forward a solution plan targeted at the defects existing in the modern <b>paper</b> <b>management,</b> namely the SSH comprehensive graduation <b>paper</b> <b>management</b> platform based on Java Web. The system employs the MySQL database and the user interface employs the ExtJs, JQuery and other multiple techniques.
