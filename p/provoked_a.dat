5|$|Again, the Swiss {{raided the}} Klettgau and the Hegau and pillaged several {{fortified}} smaller Swabian {{cities such as}} Tiengen or Stühlingen before retreating again. This whole war was characterized by many such smaller raids and plundering expeditions of both sides between a few larger battles. On the eastern front, a new Habsburg attack on the Rhine valley <b>provoked</b> <b>a</b> counterstrike of the Eidgenossen, who remained victorious {{in the battle of}} Frastanz near Feldkirch on April 20, 1499.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the issues}} the Dutch {{designers}} were having with a propulsion system were discussed, the delegation {{came away from}} Italy entirely uninspired by the Italians' efforts in that area. On the other hand, the visit <b>provoked</b> <b>a</b> drastic reworking of the internal subdivision of the proposed battlecruisers. The designers {{got rid of the}} previously required central longitudinal bulkhead and attempted to raise the double bottom to provide greater protection against magnetic torpedoes. However, due to the requirement for a shallow draft, this modification had to be abandoned.|$|E
5|$|As {{a student}} at State Junior High School 1 in Surabaya, Estianty took up {{modelling}}; in 1990 she won the Yess Modelling Competition for Teenagers, which <b>provoked</b> <b>a</b> number of modelling offers. She also began working part-time at a radio station and learned {{how to be a}} disc jockey. At a birthday party while in junior high school, a friend introduced her to Ahmad Dhani; Estianty and Dhani began writing songs for the piano together. Having received good marks in elementary school and junior high school, while in senior high school she began dating, first with a classmate then with Dhani, and her scores dropped drastically.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} August 2006, Striker {{left the}} Raw brand to join ECW, making his debut on August 23. He {{continued}} his Classroom segment on ECW, which <b>provoked</b> <b>a</b> feud with The Sandman after Striker insulted him. Striker made his in-ring debut for the brand on the September 19, 2006 episode of ECW, when his team of Mike Knox and Test were defeated by Tommy Dreamer, Sabu, and The Sandman when Test was disqualified for pushing the referee. Striker continued his feud with The Sandman until the October 17 episode of ECW, when The Sandman defeated him in a Singapore Cane on a Pole match.|$|E

5|$|By the 4th century BC, the {{military}} formations the Romans had {{inherited from the}} Etruscans were still in use. Though their efficiency was doubtful, they proved effective against Rome's largely local adversaries. When Gauls invaded Etruria in 390 BC, the inhabitants requested help from Rome. The small contingent Rome sent to repel the Gallic invaders <b>provoked</b> <b>a</b> full-scale attack on Rome and the entire Roman army was destroyed at the Battle of the Allia.|$|E
5|$|Criticism over artistic {{matters in}} The Pall Mall Gazette <b>provoked</b> <b>a</b> letter in self-defence, and soon Wilde was a {{contributor}} to that and other journals during 1885–87. He enjoyed reviewing and journalism; the form suited his style. He could organise and share his views on art, literature and life, yet in a format less tedious than lecturing. Buoyed up, his reviews were largely chatty and positive. Wilde, like his parents before him, also supported the cause of Irish Nationalism. When Charles Stewart Parnell was falsely accused of inciting murder Wilde wrote a series of astute columns defending him in the Daily Chronicle.|$|E
5|$|Defections by {{units of}} the Greek Navy to the Venizelist factions <b>provoked</b> <b>a</b> Royalist purge of Venizelist {{officers}} and men from the Greek Navy. French Admiral Fournet, the Commander in Chief of the Allied Squadron, perceived the Greek fleet as a menace to the Entente powers in the Aegean. He delivered an ultimatum to the Greeks to sequester the small ships and disable the large ones. On 19 October 1916, the breech blocks, munitions, and torpedoes were removed from Limnos and Kilkis. At the same time, the crews were reduced to one-third of normal size.|$|E

5|$|Historian Sandra Mass {{considers}} the Rommel myth a hero cult, {{a synthesis of}} old and new hero cults and traditions culled primarily from Germany's largely imaginary colonial past, in particular the proletarian hero cult originally represented by Carl Peters and the bourgeois one represented by Paul von Lettow-Vorbeck. Rommel, as portrayed by this hero cult, was both chivalrous and ruthless, young and old, harsh and gentle, strong and righteous. Calder, Duffy and Ricci opine that Rommel's military brilliance <b>provoked</b> <b>a</b> masochistic tendency to romanticise a worthy opponent, that because he was skilled at his profession, he must have been an anti-Nazi hero.|$|E
5|$|In Colonel Redl, Brandauer plays Alfred Redl, {{counter-intelligence}} {{chief of}} the Austro-Hungarian Empire who was blackmailed into espionage for the Russians {{in order to prevent}} the revelation of his homosexuality. The film won top awards in Germany and the UK, but <b>provoked</b> <b>a</b> scandal in Austria, where several periodicals accused the film of bringing the country into disrepute. In Hanussen, Brandauer plays the real life clairvoyant performer Erik Jan Hanussen, whose growing fame brings him into increasingly close—and dangerous—contact with the Nazis.|$|E

Type-0 HD, together with , <b>provoked</b> <b>a</b> rise in sales for the PS4 while other console sales remained consistent, but it ultimately performed poorly, selling through only 59.59% of its shipment. It had sold over 128,000 units in Japan by August 2015, being the 26th best-selling video game during that period.|$|E

5|$|Jackson's successor, President Martin Van Buren, viewed Texas {{annexation}} as {{an immense}} political liability that would empower the anti-slavery northern Whig opposition – especially if annexation <b>provoked</b> <b>a</b> war with Mexico. Presented with a formal annexation proposal from Texas minister Memucan Hunt, Jr. in August 1837, Van Buren summarily rejected it. Annexation resolutions presented separately in each house of Congress were either soundly defeated or tabled through filibuster. After {{the election of}} 1838, new Texas president Mirabeau B. Lamar withdrew his republic's offer of annexation due to these failures. Texans were at an annexation impasse when John Tyler entered the White House in 1841.|$|E
5|$|Lumumba's speech, {{broadcast}} {{live on the}} radio across the world, denounced colonialism and was interpreted as an affront to Belgium and Baudouin personally. While it was well-received within the Congo, it was widely condemned internationally as unnecessarily confrontational and for showing ingratitude {{at a time when}} Belgium had granted independence to the state. The speech nearly <b>provoked</b> <b>a</b> diplomatic incident between the Congo and Belgium and Lumumba later gave further speeches attempting to adopt a more conciliatory tone.|$|E
5|$|On March 17, Campbell {{appeared}} at the Montreal Forum for the Canadiens' first game after Richard's suspension. His presence <b>provoked</b> <b>a</b> riot at the Forum that spilled into the streets. The riot caused an estimated $100,000 in property damage, thirty-seven injuries, and 100 arrests. Tensions eased after Richard made a personal plea accepting his punishment and promising to return the following year to help the team win the Stanley Cup. The incident likely cost Richard the 1954–55 scoring title (an honour Richard never achieved in his NHL career) and {{played a role in}} the off-season departure of longtime Canadiens head coach Dick Irvin.|$|E

5|$|The Age of Reason <b>provoked</b> <b>a</b> hostile {{reaction}} from most readers and critics, although {{the intensity of}} that hostility varied by locality. There were four major factors for this animosity: Paine denied that the Bible was a sacred, inspired text; he argued that Christianity was a human invention; his ability to command a large readership frightened those in power; and his irreverent and satirical style of writing about Christianity and the Bible offended many believers.|$|E
5|$|The French {{officers}} {{recruited by}} Pigneau {{were used to}} train Nguyễn Ánh's armed forces and introduce their technological expertise to the war effort. Olivier de Puymanel {{was responsible for the}} construction of fortifications. One of Nguyễn Ánh's first actions was to ask the French officers to design and oversee the construction of a modern European-style citadel in Saigon. The citadel was designed by Theodore Lebrun and de Puymanel and 30,000 people were used to construct it in 1790. The townfolk and their mandarins were heavily taxed for the work, and the labourers were worked {{to the extent that it}} <b>provoked</b> <b>a</b> revolt.|$|E
5|$|The {{majority}} international {{reaction was}} extremely critical of Lumumba. Lumumba's attack on colonialism was especially {{interpreted as an}} attack on Belgium itself and nearly <b>provoked</b> <b>a</b> diplomatic incident between the two countries. International observers though the speech unwise, ungrateful and tactless. The confrontational attitude taken by Lumumba appeared to confirm Belgian and American suspicions that Lumumba was a dangerous radical. Between September 1960 and January 1961, partly at the instigation of the two countries, Lumumba was deposed from power, arrested and executed with the complicity of both the Congolese and Katangese governments.|$|E
