5|$|The series {{depicts the}} {{everyday}} lives of office {{employees in the}} Scranton, Pennsylvania branch of the fictional Dunder Mifflin Paper Company. In the episode, Michael Scott (Steve Carell) and Dwight Schrute (Rainn Wilson) leave the office to buy a condo. Meanwhile, Jim Halpert (John Krasinski), along with Pam Beesly (Jenna Fischer), organizes office games and gets his co-workers to <b>play</b> <b>them.</b>|$|E
5|$|Political {{and social}} trends {{of the late}} 1970s shifted away from the early 1970s hippie attitudes that had led to the genre's {{development}} and popularity. The rise in punk cynicism made the utopian ideals expressed in progressive rock lyrics unfashionable. Virtuosity was rejected, as the expense of purchasing quality instruments and the time investment of learning to <b>play</b> <b>them</b> were seen as barriers to rock's energy and immediacy. There were also changes in the music industry, as record companies disappeared and merged into large media conglomerates. Promoting and developing experimental music {{was not part of}} the marketing strategy for these large corporations, who focused their attention on identifying and targeting profitable market niches.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{of the new}} contacts was Busoni. The great pianist and composer became Szigeti's mentor during these formative years, and the two would remain close friends until Busoni's death in 1924. By Szigeti's own admission, before meeting Busoni his life was characterized by a certain laziness and indifference {{brought on by the}} then-typical life of a young prodigy violinist. He had grown accustomed to playing crowd-pleasing salon miniatures and dazzling virtuosic encores without much thought. He knew little of the works of the great masters; he could <b>play</b> <b>them,</b> but not fully understand them. As Szigeti put it, Busoni—particularly through their careful study of Bach's Chaconne—"shook me once and for all out of my adolescent complacency".|$|E

5|$|As a teenager, she {{attended}} Southport State High School. At {{the age of}} 15, Coulter had a serious knee injury which required reconstructive surgery. She was told she would never play netball again. Several months later, Coulter's ability to sing was discovered by her mother who overheard her in her bedroom, which led to her performing at gigs in the Gold Coast and Brisbane areas with live bands. Coulter had also secured lead roles in high school productions such as, Hair, Jesus Christ Superstar, Les Misérables, Miss Saigon, Cats, Rent, The Boy Friend, Phantom of the Opera, Grease and The Rocky Horror Show. Aside from singing, she also learned how to play several instruments, including the tenor saxophone, flute and trumpet, and would often <b>play</b> <b>them</b> in school concerts and in the school stage band. During high school, Coulter excelled in music and sport. After completing high school in 2002, she decided to focus on her music career, and began writing her own songs with her good friend Xy Latu.|$|E
5|$|Nintendo GameCube memory cards, {{on which}} saved games are kept, can be {{inserted}} into these arcade units. A memory card {{is required for}} players {{a chance to win}} the AX-exclusive pilots, their vehicles, and tracks for use in GX. Players can store up to four machines from GX on a memory card, then <b>play</b> <b>them</b> in AX. If a memory card is used with a magnetic stripe card, players have additional options; they can enter stored GX machines into the F-Zero AX Internet ranking system, and transfer custom AX machine parts to GX. F-Zero AX content is also unlockable by progressing through GXs tougher challenges. It was discovered in early 2013 that the arcade version is playable within the GameCube version by the use of a cheat cartridge.|$|E
5|$|The musicians at the {{sessions}} were recruited by Shambhu Das, who had assisted in Harrison's sitar tuition on his previous visit to Bombay, in 1966, and Vijay Dubey, {{the head of}} A for HMV Records in India. The line-up on the track was Aashish Khan (sarod), Mahapurush Misra (pakhavaj), Hanuman Jadev (shehnai), Hariprasad Chaurasia (bansuri) and Rijram Desad (harmonium). In Lavezzoli's estimation, although these instruments are more commonly associated with the Hindustani discipline, the performers <b>play</b> <b>them</b> in a South Indian style, which adds to the Carnatic identity of the song. The recording features tabla tarang over the quiet, vocal interludes. Author Simon Leng refutes {{the presence of the}} oboe-like shehnai, however, saying that this part was played on an esraj, a bow-played string instrument. As with the Wonderwall selections recorded at HMV, Harrison directed the musicians but did not perform on the instrumental track.|$|E

5|$|The run starts by {{introducing}} two main antagonists, an aging politician, who {{is using a}} strange portal to enter other people's minds and commit crimes, and Mako, a cannibalistic mage who devours other magicians {{in order to obtain}} their power. Constantine's attempt to <b>play</b> <b>them</b> off one another only succeeds in making them join forces in a further plot. Constantine then traps them both with considerable ease, and questions how this has been so easy. It then becomes apparent that he has been manipulated by the 'Golden Child', his twin who did not survive childbirth, and has been manipulating events for the whole of the series, including his battle with cancer and many other events. He declines his twin's offer to merge souls, suspicious that his twin has been weakening his will in past years to make him accept this offer, choosing instead to take control of his own destiny.|$|E
5|$|Tristano {{encouraged}} {{his students}} to learn the melodies of jazz standards by singing them, then playing them, before working on playing them in all keys. He also often had his students learn to sing and play the improvised solos {{of some of the}} best-known names in jazz, including Parker and Young. Some students first sang solos from a recording slowed to half the normal speed; eventually they learned to sing and <b>play</b> <b>them</b> at normal speed. Tristano stressed that the student was not learning to imitate the artist, but should use the experience to gain insight into the musical feeling conveyed. Such activities stressed the value of ear training, and the idea of feeling being fundamental to musical expression. All of this preceded having the opportunity to improvise during lessons.|$|E
5|$|Mother {{begins with}} the story of a young, married, American couple who mysteriously vanish from their small, rural town. Two years later, the husband, George, {{returned}} as mysteriously as he vanished, and began a strange study in complete seclusion. His wife, Maria, was never heard from again. Years later, in the late 1980s (dated specifically as 1988 in the Famicom version, but kept ambiguous in later releases), a young American boy named Ninten is attacked at home in a paranormal event. His father explains that Ninten's great-grandfather studied psychic powers, and asks Ninten to investigate a crisis occurring across the world, later revealed to be the work of an invading alien race. After finishing a few tasks, Ninten is warped to the world of Magicant, where the land's ruler, Queen Mary, asks Ninten to find her song, the Eight Melodies, and <b>play</b> <b>them</b> for her. Ninten returns to Earth and befriends a young boy, Lloyd, who is being teased at an elementary school. The two travel to the town of Snowman to deliver a lost hat to Ana, a young girl with psychic powers. Ana tells Ninten she saw him in a dream, and joins the party in hopes of finding her missing mother.|$|E

500|$|The band {{began work}} on the album two years before {{entering}} the studio to record on April 1, 2000.

[...] The album was recorded at Studio 880 in Oakland. Cool noted of the band's work ethic in the studio, [...] "We're not really sprinting. We're working at the same pace, but it's a pretty fast pace for recording. We're faster than every other band, pretty much. That's what I've been told." [...] With the record, the band aimed to construct a solid list of tracks where [...] "each song could be its own album". The group also made sure to make each song [...] "well thought out and well placed" [...] with regard to the album's track listing.|$|R
