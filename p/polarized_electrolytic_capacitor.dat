2500|$|Aluminum <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> are <b>polarized</b> <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> whose anode {{electrode}} (+) {{is made of}} a pure {{aluminum foil}} with an etched surface. The aluminum forms a very thin insulating layer of [...] aluminium oxide by anodization that acts as the dielectric of the capacitor. A non-solid electrolyte covers the rough surface of the oxide layer, serving in principle as the second electrode (cathode) (-) of the capacitor. A second aluminum foil called “cathode foil” contacts the electrolyte and serves as the electrical connection to the negative terminal of the capacitor.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. For {{detecting}} the defects of the vertical <b>polarized</b> <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> {{in the process}} of production, an online machine vision detection method based on DSP is proposed in this paper. The hardware framework is designed emphatically with DM 642 as the core processor, which has the advantages of small size, fast processing speed, low cost and low power consumption. The software workflow of the capacitors defects detection is introduced. To meet the requirement of high production and real-time detection of capacitors, a rapid appearance detection algorithm is introduced by using a few number of feature points instead of the whole. The experimental results show that the proposed method can achieve many types of defects detection of the capacitors...|$|R
2500|$|The early {{style of}} the ceramic disc {{capacitor}} could be more cheaply produced than the common ceramic tube capacitors in the 1950s and 1970s. An American company {{in the midst of}} the Apollo program, launched in 1961, pioneered the stacking of multiple discs to create a monolithic block. This [...] "multi-layer ceramic capacitor" [...] (MLCC) was compact and offered high-capacitance capacitors. The production of these capacitors using the tape casting and ceramic-electrode cofiring processes was a great manufacturing challenge. MLCCs expanded the range of applications to those requiring larger capacitance values in smaller cases. These ceramic chip capacitors were the driving force behind the conversion of electronic devices from through-hole mounting to surface-mount technology in the 1980s. <b>Polarized</b> <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitors</b> could be replaced by non-polarized ceramic capacitors, simplifying the mounting.|$|R
50|$|Because the {{potential}} (voltage) across capacitor C1 may reverse direction every cycle, a non-polarized capacitor should be used. However, a <b>polarized</b> tantalum or <b>electrolytic</b> <b>capacitor</b> {{may be used}} in some cases, because {{the potential}} (voltage) across capacitor C1 will not change unless the switch is closed long enough for a half cycle of resonance with inductor L2, and by this time the current in inductor L1 could be quite large.|$|R
