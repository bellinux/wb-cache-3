5000|$|OrganismsLarge {{plants are}} only part of the organisms that play a role in soil formation. For example, fungi are closely {{associated}} with the roots of many vascular plants by making available nutrients like nitrogen and phosphorus in a way that their host plants can utilize, and play an important role in returning organic matter to the soil by decomposing leaf litter. The list of organisms that interact with, and affect, soil is extensive, and it is these interactions that allow for the presence of paleosols to be inferred. Not only can particular organisms be interpreted from paleosols, but also ancient ecosystems. The soil interaction of plants is different from community to community. They each have distinct patterns of root traces, soil structure, and overall <b>profile</b> <b>form.</b> Identifying these features is useful for providing an overall assessment of the influence past organisms had on any particular paleosol. However, qualifying these general effects of organism activity can be difficult because the level of their expression is as related to their nature as it is to the amount of time available for soil formation. Even when fossils that are found in paleosols are understood, much more can be learned regarding their preservation, ecology, and evolution by studying the paleosols they inhabited. [...] A fossilized footprint, burrow, or coprolite (fossil feces), are examples of trace fossils (ichnofossils). These trace fossils do not represent any physical part of an organism, but rather evidence of an organism's activity within its environment. Whereas a bone, leaf, or stem might provide enough information to positively identify a particular species, trace fossils rarely allow for such a precise identification. However, unlike fossilized body parts which can be affected by many variables, trace fossils are not often transported away and are usually found in the place where the organism lived. This advantage makes trace fossils in paleosols especially important because they allow for interpretation of the animal's behavior in its natural environment. A great example of this is the simple shallow fossilized burrows of solitary bees that make their homes in soil. Just as fossilized footprints, burrows, and coprolites represent trace fossils or organisms, paleosols can be considered trace fossils of an ancient ecosystem. Much like the small percentage of species that are fossilized, very few species within an ecosystem leave any discernible trace in paleosols. However, their more general effects within a paleosol may be preserved. A good example of this is root traces. Analyzing the pattern of root traces, the sequence of soil horizons, and other features can help identify the type of vegetation that was present during the formation of the soil. General features such as stature and spacing determine what botanists call a 'plant formation.' Distinct from a community or association, plant formation is not defined by any particular species. Examples of plant formation include forests, woodlands, and grasslands. Because it may not be possible to determine whether a particular plant was an oak, eucalyptus, or other species, plant formations in paleosols make it possible to identify an ancient woodland ecosystem from an ancient grassland ecosystem.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.), Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering, Washington State UniversitySuccessful {{continuous}} or semi-continuous <b>profile</b> <b>forming</b> of wood-strand composites requires {{development of}} the underpinning science, including a suitable binding system, forming defect management, and process-property relationships. A hybrid resin to stabilize the wood-strand preforms for subsequent <b>profile</b> <b>forming</b> and curing was devised using a mixture of poly(vinyl acetate) (PVAc) and phenol formaldehyde (PF) resins. This study examined the influence of PVAc on the cure kinetics of PF with differential scanning calorimetry. Results show that the cure kinetics of PF blended with PVAc does not differ significantly from neat PF resin for blend ratios of 1 or lower. The nth-order Borchardt Daniels model provided good prediction for the curing of adhesive system with a PVAc/PF ratio lower than 1 and neat PF resin. This blended resin system can potentially be used for continuous or semi-continuous <b>profile</b> <b>forming</b> of wood-strand composites. To gain an initial understanding, the complex state of deformations in wood-strand preforms during <b>profiling</b> <b>forming</b> was studied using single-curvature bending. Three failure types were identified based on the primary failure mechanisms in bending, buckling and shear slip. The initial failure in bending was predicted with a strength-based model {{with the goal of}} minimizing defects, such as buckling. A relationship between preform conditions, forming defects and thickness recovery was established. Profile-formed wood-strand composites showed much better shape conformance than profiled veneer-based composites. Slow closing rate and relatively high moisture content caused flat and peak-at-core vertical density profiles (VDP). Lower moisture content resulted in more uniform VDP. The internal stress state in the bend of the profile-formed V-specimens was determined with elastic curved beam theory. Delamination, dominated by radial stress, was the initial failure mode. The Chang-Springer failure criterion was used to determine the initiation of delamination failure within the bend of the V-specimens on roller support. V-specimens tested on pin support yielded greater bending strength than those on roller support. These support conditions provide lower and upper bounds for stresses in the bend of the specimen for some applications. This study adds to the limited knowledge base of <b>profile</b> <b>forming</b> of wood-strand composites and provides an insight into process-property relationships.

We show that, if the cosmolog-ical density field are seeded by random gaussian fluctuations, {{as in the}} standard cold dark matter model, galaxies with steep central profiles have simultaneously extended en-velopes of shallow profiles in the outskirts, whereas galaxies with shallow central profiles are accompanied by steep density profiles in the outskirts. These properties are in ac-cord {{with those of the}} Sersic profile family. Moreover, galaxies with steep central <b>profiles</b> <b>form</b> their central regions in smaller denser subunits that possibly merge subsequently, which naturally leads to formation of bulges.
