40|$|Climate {{change is}} {{altering}} regional temperatures, forcing species {{to respond to}} new environmental challenges. Current research suggests that temperature affects population dynamics of species, altering the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> species abundance. However, {{little is known about}} the combined effects of temperature and interspecific competition. In this study, we examined how temperature and competition with the competitor Vorticella sp. affected the population dynamics of the common zooplankton, Daphnia magna. We examined how temperature and Vorticella both affect D. magna’s maximum population size, the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> population growth, and the final population size. Overall, our results suggest that high temperature and Vorticella presence, in combination, can impact the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> population growth, as well as alter life history characteristics, for D. magna. These results suggest that Vorticella delay D. magna’s population growth only when temperatures are high, and that Daphnia respond to high temperatures morphologically through reduction in size. Temperature and Vorticella presences did not significantly impact the final population sizes, indicating that although the initial population dynamics are affected by these stressors, final population size was not changed. Because climate change can alter <b>phenological</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> plant and animal species, further insight into the effect of temperature change on population dynamics of zooplankton will benefit scientific understanding as to how key trophic species, such as primary consumers, respond to increased temperature in freshwater aquatic ecosystems...|$|R
40|$|Most {{chickpea}} cultivars {{grown in}} regions where temperatures fall below 10 °C continue to flower but fail to set pods. Research {{was conducted in}} Hisar, a subtropical location in northern India, to characterize cold stress and examine genetic variation in pod and seed set at low temperatures. Lines of various maturity groups were used so that <b>phenological</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> stress differed with line. Flowering was therefore synchronized with a cold spell to evaluate tolerance. A substantial variation was found both in field and controlled environments. Two early maturing advanced breeding lines, ICCVs (ICCV = ICRISAT Chickpea Variety) 88502 and 88503, showed good pod set in cold spells, but seed growth in them was limited. Evaluation of the parents indicated possible contribution of a germplasm from the former Soviet Union, K 1189 (ICRISAT chickpea germplasm collection No ICC 8923), to cold tolerance. Experiments in controlled environments indicated that pod set can occur at night temperatures of 0 - 5 °C if daytime temperatures exceed 20 °C. Seed development required a higher threshold temperature than pod set.

40|$|BACKGROUND AND AIMS: Smoke {{exposure}} of grapevines {{and development of}} smoke taint in wine are issues of increasing incidence and severity. There is limited understanding {{of the effect of}} phenological stage at the time of smoke exposure on taint development. The aim {{of this study was to}} demonstrate the variation in smoke uptake and taint development between and within seasons. METHODS AND RESULTS: Smoke was applied to field-grown Merlot grapevines at 12 stages of vine development over three growing seasons. Key periods of vine sensitivity to smoke taint in wine were (i) from shoots at 10 cm to full bloom (low levels of smoke taint); (ii) from berries at pea size to the onset of veraison (variable levels of smoke taint); and (iii) between 7 days post-veraison and harvest (high levels of smoke taint). CONCLUSIONS: The severity of taint in wine varied depending on the <b>phenological</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> grapevine smoke exposure. Taint was elevated when exposure occurred between 7 days post-veraison and harvest. The carry-over of smoke constituents the following season was not detectable in wine but yields were reduced. SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY: This is the first study to demonstrate the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> smoke exposure to critically affect wine chemical and sensory characters. These effects were consistent and reproducible over three seasons. K. R. Kennison, K. L. Wilkinson, A. P. Pollnitz, H. G. Williams and M. R. Gibber...|$|R

We present here a 40 -y-long time series on 10, 425 dates that were systemat- ically {{collected in a}} single Russian locality for 97 plant, 78 bird, 10 herptile, 19 insect, and 9 fungal phenological events, {{as well as for}} 77 climatic events related to temperature, precipitation, snow,ice, and frost. Weshow that species are shifting their phenologies at dissimilar rates, partly because they respond to different climatic factors, which in turn are shifting at dissimilar rates. Plants have advanced their spring phenology even faster than average tem- perature has increased, whereas migratory birds have shown more divergent responses and shifted, on average, less than plants. Phenological events of birds and insects were mainly trig- geredby climate cues (variation in temperature and snowand ice cover) occurring over the course of short periods, whereas many plants, herptiles, and fungi were affected by long-term climatic averages. Year-to-year variation in plants, herptiles, and insects showed a high degree of synchrony, whereas the <b>phenological</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> fungi did not correlate with anyother taxonomicgroup.

Prescribe fire also consumes standing litter thereby improving forage quality and palatability. Consequently, prescribed fire is commonly considered an effective tool for manipulating livestock distribution on rangelands. Efficacy of this tool on mesic sage-brush steppe, however, has received little research attention. Beginning in 2001, resource selection by beef cows under a mid-summer (July) grazing regime was evaluated using global positioning system (GPS) collars for 2 years prior to and for up to 5 years after a fall prescribed fire was conducted on mesic sagebrush steppe in the Owyhee Mountains of southwestern Idaho, USA. Cattle selected for burned areas during the first, second, and fifth postfire years. Cattle had exhibited neutral selectivity towards these areas, during one of the two prefire years. Burning in the uplands reduced cattle use of near-stream habitats but only during the second postfire year.

Despite several studies have shown the effects of fertilization on primary production of alpine plants, only few studies have considered the influences of nutrients on reproduction. Here, we investigated the effects of nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) amendments on cover, number of ramets, flowering effort and <b>phenological</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> Gnaphalium supinum, an arctic-alpine widespread snowbed species. We set up an experimental design with four fertilization treatments (low N, P without addi-tional N, low N + P, and high N + P) and an unfertilized control for three years (2003 – 2005), within a late snowbed located in the Italian Alps (Gavia Pass, 2700 m a. s. l.). The cover of Gnaphalium supinum was recorded {{at the peak of}} the aboveground biomass development in the three years, while the temporal dynamic of ramet density and reproductive phenophases were monitored during the 2005 growing sea-son. The clonal growth of G. supinum resulted to be co-limited by N and P, while the flowering effort was stimulated by P. Flowering date was advanced by P supply, while N alone did not show any significant effect on phenology. In a warming scenario, with a predicted increase in N and P availability by nutrient mineralization and atmospheric deposition, this species should probably experience some benefits forits growth and reproduction if not limited by other factors such as the length of the growing season or interspecific competition...|$|R

Although such effects are well described for insect herbivory, research on the impacts of browsing by mammalian herbivores on leaf litter dynamics and nutrient cycling has been more limited, particularly {{at the level of}} the individual plant. Clipping treatments (66 % shoot removal twice, plus unclipped) were applied to analyse the effect of browsing on the phenology (start date and pattern of leaf shedding) and leaf litter quality (nitrogen (N), soluble sugars, starch and total non-structural carbohydrate concentrations, plus C: N ratios) of Betula pubescens Ehrh. and Quercus petraea [Matt. ] Liebl. saplings. Clipping decreased leaf litter biomass and delayed leaf senescence and shedding, but did not change the <b>phenological</b> <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> litterfall between senescence and shedding. The quality of leaf litter of both species was increased by simulated browsing, through an increase in N and carbohydrate concentrations (mainly soluble sugars) and a decreased C: N ratio. This is the first evidence we are aware of that browsing may cause changes in leaf shedding phenology, delaying the process without altering its pattern. Our results also indicate that simulated browsing increases the quality of leaf litter. However, the potential positive effect of browsing on N cycling through litter quality may be offset by its negative impact on the amount of N shed per tree. © 2013 The Author.

This study provides an initial examination <b>of</b> climatic and <b>phenological</b> (<b>timing</b> <b>of</b> key biological events) trends in an effort to understand how montane plants may be affected by climatic changes. To explore the consequences of increased temperatures and decreased snow cover, we conducted an experiment in a montane meadow where snow removal and passive heating were used to mimic the effects of predicted environmental changes. We manipulated soil temperature using open-sided passive warming chambers, and soil moisture by manually removing snow in the spring of 2010 and 2011. Our treatments included control, snow removal, passive warming, and snow removal + passive warming. We measured soil temperature at the surface and soil moisture at a 25 cm depth to confirm that open-sided passive warming chambers and manual snow removal had the intended effects on temperature and moisture. In 2011, we recorded plant phenological response dates for emergence (green-up), budding, flowering, and senescence in three common perennial plants (Arrowleaf Balsamroot (Balsamorhiza sagitatta), Wild Buckwheat (Eriogonum umbellatum), and Western Groundsel (Senecio integerrimus)) in each of the treatments. Frost damage was recorded in Arrowleaf Balsamroot (Balsamorhiza sagitatta) in 2011. We concluded that open-sided passive warming chambers significantly increased soil minimum nighttime temperatures at a 25 cm depth but had no impact on maximum daily temperatures. The range between the 25 cm soil maximum daily temperature and the minimum daily was significantly increased due to the increase in minimum temperatures. Soil moisture at 25 cm depth was decreased throughout the season in the snow removal treatment when compared to the control in 2011 but not 2010, when there was less snow to remove. Soil moisture was not significantly different in 2010 or 2011 when any of the other treatments were compared. Plant responses to the treatments differed between the three species measured. Time to emergence was significantly increased in B. sagitatta in the snow removal and passive warming treatments but not when snow removal and passive warming were combined. Budding time was also advanced in B. sagitatta in the snow removal and snow removal + passive warming treatments but not the passive warming only treatments.

Limited field-based and remote-sensing observations have suggested complex spatial patterns related to geographic features that influence climate.

Recognizing these limitations, we used nonlinear inverse modeling of medium-resolution remote sensing data, organized by day of year, to {{explore the influence of}} climate-related landscape factors on the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> spring and autumn leaf-area trajectories in mid-Atlantic, USA forests. We also examined the extent to which declining summer greenness (greendown) degrades the precision and accuracy of observations of autumn offset of greenness. Of the dominant drivers of landscape phenology, elevation was the strongest, explaining up to 70 % of the spatial variation in the onset of greenness.

40|$|Summary Timing of bud {{burst and}} frost damage risk for leaves of Betula spp. in {{response}} to climatic warming in Fin-land was examined with two models. In the first model, onto-genetic development in spring was triggered by an accumula-tion of chilling temperatures. The second model assumed an additional signal from the light climate. The two models gave radically different estimates of frost damage risk {{in response to}} climate warming. The chilling-triggered model forecast a sig-nificant and increasing risk with increased warming, whereas the light-climate-triggered model predicted little or no risk. The chilling-triggered model is widely applied in pheno-logical research; however, there is increasing experimental ev-idence that light conditions {{play a role in}} the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> spring phenology. Although it is not clear if the light response mech-anisms are appropriately represented in our model, the results imply that reliance on a light signal for spring development would afford a degree of protection against possible frost dam-age under climate warming that would not be present if chill-ing were the sole determinant.

The phenological stages studied exhibited a 30 to 51 day variation between the earliest and latest years for red cultivars and 29 to 49 day variation for white cultivars. The beginning of flowering exhibited the least, while harvest showed the highest inter-annual variation.

The beginning of flowering to the beginning of veraison interval showed the smallest and budburst to harvest interval the greatest year-toyear variability. The beginning of budburst to harvest period for the cultivars examined averaged 165 days for red and 156 days for white cultivars, with the mean interval range of 58 days for red and 55 days for white cultivars.

These seasonal patterns can vary among years, which {{can alter the}} <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the seasonal life-history events, or phenologies, of species (e. g., emergence from dormancy, migration, reproduction). Species, and individuals within species, oftentimes differ in their phenological responses to year-specific conditions, which could alter the stage at which species interact. We {{do not have a}} good understanding of how these shifts in the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> species interactions affect the outcome of those interactions, but determining the consequences is critical for understanding the dynamics of natural communities. Here, I use a series of experiments with communities of pond-dwelling insects and amphibians to determine how shifts in <b>phenological</b> <b>timing</b> affect intra- and interspecific interactions and whether these effects scale up to alter demographic rates, community structure, and ecosystem functioning. Specifically, I manipulated the mean hatching time (i. e., time of arrival to the habitat) for one species relative to another and/or the amount of variation in arrival time by individuals of a species around a mean date (i. e., degree of synchrony). First, I manipulated differences in mean arrival time for two species that interact as intraguild predators and found that the changes in relative size mediated by shifts in arrival time had strong effects on interactions. Specifically when arrival differences were small, the two species coexisted in similar abundances, but when arrival differences were large, the early arriver excluded the late arriver through predation. Second, I manipulated mean arrival time of one species relative to a predator and a competitor to determine how phenological shifts affected predator-prey and competitive interactions. I found that shifts in the arrival time of a single species within a community can affect the outcome of both interaction types strongly enough to alter community structure, and these changes to community structure scaled up to affect one of three ecosystem-level processes measured. Third, I manipulated variation in the synchrony of arrival, as well as initial density, of a species to determine the consequences for intraspecific competition. I found that variation in synchrony altered several demographic rates of the species, and these effects were density dependent. Finally, I used a factorial manipulation of the mean and synchrony of arrival by a prey species {{in the presence of a}} predator to determine how this variation affected predator-prey interactions. I found that the effects of variation in these two aspects of phenology on prey survival were additive, with survival declining with later arrival and lower arrival synchrony. Taken together, these results clearly demonstrate that shifts in <b>phenological</b> <b>timing</b> can have strong effects on intra- and interspecific interactions. These effects of phenological shifts on species interactions frequently scaled up to alter the structure of communities, and were even capable of affecting ecosystem-level processes.

40|$|Tropical savannas are key {{components}} of the global carbon and water cycles and understanding their functioning is critical to understanding ecosystem feedbacks to global climate. By observing broad scale vegetation responses to climatic variability, remote sensing offers powerful insights into the patterns and processes underlying savanna behaviour. However, savannas are highly complex, multi-layer and heterogenous ecosystems composed of C 3 (herbaceous) and C 4 (woodland) components with asynchronous phenological responses to environmental controls. There are concerns about optimizing the detection of savanna functioning {{as well as in}} understanding their environmental controls with remote-sensing data due to their coarse resolution. Furthermore, seasonalphenologic variations in satellite observations need to be sufficiently accurate to ensure confidence in interpreting vegetation responses to interannual climatic variation and to aid in constraining models of carbon and water fluxes. In this study, we analysed several years of high temporal frequency MODIS and TRMM satellite data sets of vegetation dynamics and rainfall, respectively, to seasonal and interannual responses of savanna multifunctional components to climate variability across a tropical savanna aridity gradient (1760 to 580 mm annual rainfall) in northern Australia. We compared our results with a series of eddy covariance (EC) tower flux data of gross primary production and analyzed a wide set of ecosystem processes including photosynthesis, net primary productivity, <b>phenological</b> metrics in <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> the growing season, and rain use efficiencies. We found MODIS satellite measurements to yield highly accurate spatial and temporal variability in ecosystem functioning and able to replicate interannual patterns and responses to rainfall observed with the EC tower data. Although these results appear promising for regional extensions of satelliteflux tower relationships at the landscape level, we also observed various issues with footprint matching and hysteresis effects that potentially may limit the utility of remote sensing in scaling fluxes of carbon and water to the regional scales...|$|R
40|$|<b>Phenological</b> <b>timing</b> [...] i. e. {{the course}} of {{annually}} recurring development stages in nature [...] {{is of particular interest}} since it can be understood as a proxy for the climate at a specific region; moreover changes in the so called phenological phases can be a direct consequence of climate change. We analyze records of botanical phenology and study their fluctuations which we find to depend on the seasons. In contrast to previous studies, where typically trends in the phenology of individual species are estimated, we consider the ensemble of all available phases and propose a phenological index that characterizes the influence of climate on the multitude of botanical species.

40|$|Damage by {{late spring}} frost {{is a risk}} {{deciduous}} trees {{have to cope with}} in order to optimize the length of their growing season. The <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> spring <b>phenological</b> development plays a crucial role, not only at the species level, but also at the population and individual level, since fresh new leaves are especially vulnerable. For the pronounced late spring frost in May 2011 in Germany, we studied the individual leaf development of 35 deciduous trees (mainly European beech Fagus sylvatica L.) at a mountainous forest site in the Bayerischer Wald National Park using repeated digital photographs. Analyses of the time series of greenness by a novel Bayesian multiple change point approach mostly revealed five change points which almost perfectly matched the expected break points in leaf development: i) start of the first greening between DOY (day of the year) 108 to 119 (mean 113), ii) end of greening and iii) visible frost damage after the frost on the night of May 3 rd/ 4 th (DOY 123, 124), iv) re-sprouting 19 to 38 days after the frost, and v) full maturity around DOY 178 (166 to 184) when all beech crowns had fully recovered. Since frost damage was nearly 100 %, individual susceptibility did not depend on the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> first spring leaf unfolding. However, we could identify significant patterns in fitness linked to an earlier start of leaf unfolding. Those individuals that had an earlier start of greening during the first flushing period had a shorter period of recovery and started the second greening earlier. Thus, <b>phenological</b> <b>timing</b> triggered the speed of recovery from such an extreme event. The maximum greenness achieved, however, did not vary with leaf unfolding dates. Two mountain ashes (Sorbus aucuparia L.) were not affected by the low temperatures of − 5 °C. Time series analysis of webcam pictures can thus improve process-based knowledge and provide valuable insights into the link between phenological variation, late spring frost damage and recovery within one stand...|$|R
40|$|Snowmelt timing {{has been}} proven {{critical}} to the phenology in subarctic and alpine ecosystems. Nevertheless, its impacts on the phenology of dwarf-shrub-dominated vegetation on high-latitudinal Fennoscandian fells are not yet sufficiently studied. This project focusses on the divergences in <b>phenological</b> <b>timings</b> and reproductive success caused by naturally different snowmelt timings in this area. The study site was on fell Saana in northwest Finland. The data was collected from a site covering three snowmelt timings located in two aspects (fully factorial, 4 replicates) from 20 th of May to 4 th of September, 2015, totalling 108 days. The phenological events (e. g. leaf unfolding, anthesis, and leaf colouring) of 12 species of three growth forms (dwarf shrub, forb, and graminoid) were recorded. The statistical analyses show that different snowmelt timings result in {{significant differences in the}} time points (expressed in day of year, DOY) of peak flowering and shoot elongation, as well as the green-leaved durations (days); however, flowering duration is rather constant across snowmelt timings. Significant differences are also found in the reproductive success of several species. The results suggest that in subarctic-alpine vegetation, an earlier snowmelt timing 1) elongates the duration of vegetative growth, 2) advances the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> peak flowering while the flowering duration remains unchanged, and 3) potentially impedes reproductive success in some species, but generally the pattern is heterogeneous. Thus, snowmelt timing is causing divergences among the phenological traits and potentially within the reproductive success of dwarf shrub species in this area. In the long term, these phenomena may impact the local biodiversity and biochemical cycles, which may be a long-term effect of the shifting snowmelt timing due to global change...|$|R

However, history has shown that the narrow climatic zones for growing winegrapes are especially prone to variations in climate and long-term climate change. While the observed warming over the last fifty years appears to have mostly benefited the quality of wine grown worldwide, projections of future warming at the global, continent, and wine region scale will likely have both a beneficial and detrimental impacts through opening new areas to viticulture and increasing viability, or severely challenging the ability to adequately grow grapes and produce quality wine. Overall, the projected rate and magnitude of future climate change will likely bring about numerous potential impacts for the wine industry, including – added pressure on increasingly scarce water supplies, additional changes in grapevine <b>phenological</b> <b>timing,</b> further disruption or alterations of balanced composition and flavor in grapes and wine, regionally-specific changes in varieties grown, necessary shifts in regional wine styles, and spatial changes in viable grape growing regions...|$|R
40|$|Shifts in the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> spring {{phenology}} are {{a central}} feature of global change research. Long-term observations of plant phenology {{have been used}} to track vegetation responses to climate variability but are often limited to particular species and locations and may not represent synoptic patterns. Satellite remote sensing is instead used for continental to global monitoring. Although numerous methods exist to extract <b>phenological</b> <b>timing,</b> in particular start-of-spring (SOS), from time series of reflectance data, a comprehensive intercomparison and interpretation of SOS methods has not been conducted. Here, we assess 10 SOS methods for North America between 1982 and 2006. The techniques include consistent inputs from the 8 km Global Inventory Modeling and Mapping Studies Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer NDVIg dataset, independent data for snow cover, soil thaw, lake ice dynamics, spring streamflow timing, over 16 000 individual measurements of ground-based phenology, and two temperature-driven models of spring phenology. Compared with an ensemble of the 10 SOS methods, we found that individual methods differed in average day-of-year estimates by ± 60 days and in standard deviation by ± 20 days. The ability of the satellite methods to retrieve SOS estimates was highest in northern latitudes and lowest in arid, tropical, and Mediterranean ecoregions. The ordinal rank of SOS methods varied geographically, as did the relationships between SOS estimates and the cryospheric/hydrologic metrics. Compared with ground observations, SOS estimates were more related to the first leaf and first flowers expanding phenological stages. We found no evidence for time trends in spring arrival from ground- or model-based data; using an ensemble estimate from two methods that were more closely related to ground observations than other methods, SOS trends could be detected for only 12 % of North America and were divided between trends towards both earlier and later spring...|$|R

40|$|The {{phenology}} {{of three}} dominant and economically important tree species; Acacia erioloba, Acacia luederitzii and Acacia mellifera, all {{widespread in the}} Kalahari in Botswana, was studied at Tsabong (25 degrees 56. 652 ̆ 7 S, 22 degrees 27. 722 ̆ 7 E) and Mann (20 degrees 09. 602 ̆ 7 S, 23 degrees 46. 632 ̆ 7 E) receiving 300 and 463 mm annual rainfall, respectively. The main aims were to investigate how possible environmental cues influence <b>timing</b> and development <b>of</b> phenophases and whether different tree species have different seasonal responses to these cues. Likely effects of climatic changes on phenological development patterns were also considered. All three species studied had generally comparable seasonal responses irrespective of the mean annual rainfall at each site, but differed in the <b>timing</b> <b>of</b> certain phenophases. Both A. erioloba and A. mellifera flowered {{at the end of}} the cool dry season. Acacia erioloba produced new leaves simultaneous with flowers while A. mellifera produced fully developed fruits before leaves. On the other hand, A. luederitzii produced leaves and flowered after rain and well into the growing season, with leaves appearing before the flowers. For A. erioloba and A. mellifera, temperature and daylength appeared to be the most probable phenological cues, while in the case of A. leuderitzii, it was rainfall. All species produced lower amounts of certain litter components during the year of lower rainfall at the Tsabong site, affecting fodder availability. Livestock was observed feeding on newly emerged flowers, leaves and new twigs, relieved from scratching the ground for dry grass, fallen leaves and pods. Other studies have also observed new growth to provide valuable fodder in the dry season and drought periods, making <b>phenological</b> <b>timing</b> economically crucial. Any shift in climatic factors that affect this timing may have detrimental consequences. Drought is the best-known example of an extreme shift. There is need for more information on the likely extent of other shifts and possible effects in vulnerable areas such as the Kalahari in the face of changing environmental and climatic conditions.

We found several hundred dead common frogs and alpine newts {{in the two}} consecutive years and also observed an unusually high number of heterospecific matings between common toads and common frogs in 2004. In order to test whether the observed mortalities were caused by disease, we screened 98 individuals of the three species for chytridiomycosis, a highly infective fungal disease, in 2008. All samples proved to be negative. We therefore assume that the high losses for the common frog population (26 % in 2004 and 9 % in 2005) during the spring migration, {{as well as the}} breakdown of the temporal premating isolation between the common frog and common toad, were caused by temperature anomalies alone, i. e. sudden low temperatures after a warm spring period.
