40|$|The European Commission has {{introduced}} in the proposals of the Data Protection Reform Package, a principle according to which personal data shall be processed under the responsibility and liability of the controller, who shall ensure {{compliance with the provisions}} adopted pursuant to these instruments. While not termed expressly, this principle is expected to introduce an accountability-based approach within the European data protection framework. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>accountability</b> has gained importance in the privacy debates since the Opinion of Article 29 Working Party on the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>accountability</b> (2010). Accountability is approached as a way to put data protection into practice, in which the data controller could be required to demonstrate compliance with the data protection framework to supervisory authorities. The <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>accountability</b> is however not new to data protection. The fourteen Guideline the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Guidelines of 1981, one of the first data protection instruments, entitled “the Accountability principle” was already stating that “a data controller should be accountable for complying with measures which give effect to the principles stated above”. As detailed in the Explanatory paragraph, the introduction of this principle was motivated by the fact that “it is for his benefit that the processing of data is carried out”. Accordingly, it was seen as essential that under domestic law, accountability for complying with privacy protection rules and decisions should be placed on the data controller who should not be relieved of this obligation merely because the processing of data is carried out on his behalf by another party. The meaning of the term “accountability” is however not always clear and needs to be further refined. Understanding what the concept of accountability entitles and how it can be articulated with other close concepts such as the ones of liability, responsibility and answerability seems however an unavoidable task in the context of PARIS project. The field of political sciences has produced abundant literature in order to grasp the different meanings of accountability. To that end, a review of the most important pieces of the literature will allow us to clarify the concepts and the different elements that should be taken into account when designing accountability mechanisms. In a second part, this Chapter will focus on how such concept is being approached and introduced within the data protection framework. As mentioned above, the <b>principle</b> <b>of</b> <b>accountability</b> is there closely linked to the ones of responsibility and liability. This will allow us to identify the issues linked to the introduction of an accountability-based approach into the data protection framework, as well as a first list of elements that should be integrated into accountability mechanisms. The findings of this Chapter are also expected to base the definitive list of requirements for the design of accountable policies, procedures and practices in surveillance systems that should integrate the SALT framework, which will be dealt with in Deliverable D. 2. 2. nrpages: 136 - 181 status: submitte...|$|E

This research study is a replica of Lin et al. where the difference with previous studies is the study conducted in Indonesia and had conducted a survey using a questionnaire first. There are six variables that might impact on the disclosure of material weaknesses in the company. The three variables are indicators of the Attributes of Internal Audit Function (IAF), namely competence, objectivity, and investment. Three other variables are indicators of the Internal Audit Activity Function (IAF) is the grade of internal audits, follow-up and coordination. The results show the competence of internal auditors has no effect on the disclosure of material weaknesses, internal auditor objectivity positive influence on disclosure of material weaknesses, investments in internal auditor has no effect on the disclosure of material weaknesses, internal audit grade does not affect the disclosure of material weaknesses, follow-up on audit findings are not affect the disclosure of material weakness, and coordination between the internal auditor with the external auditor has no effect on the disclosure of material weaknesses.

It is however unclear whether accountability can be characterised precisely enough to yield effective protection and whether it bears the capacity for innovative solutions.

Analysing accountability critically requires distinguishing between its application levels: we focus on the requirement for data controllers to provide a statement relating their actual data handling operations with their obligations, and put forward a combination of precise legal requirements and effective tools to support strong accountability.
