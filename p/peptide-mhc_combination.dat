40|$|Most autoantigens {{implicated in}} {{multiple}} sclerosis (MS) are expressed {{not only in}} the central nervous system (CNS) but also in the thymus and the periphery. Nevertheless, these autoantigens might induce a strong autoimmune response leading to severe destruction within the CNS. To investigate the influence of a dominantly presented autoantigen on experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), we generated transgenic mice expressing the autoantigenic peptide MBP 1 - 10 covalently bound to the MHC class II molecule I-A(u). These mice were crossed either with B 10. PL or with TCR-transgenic Tg 4 mice, specific for the transgenic <b>peptide-MHC</b> <b>combination.</b> In double transgenic mice we found strong thymic deletion and residual peripheral T cells were refractory to antigen stimulation in vitro. Residual peripheral CD 4 (+) T cells expressed activation markers and a high proportion was CD 25 positive. Transfer of both CD 25 -negative and CD 25 -positive CD 4 (+) T cells from double transgenic animals into B 10. PL mice strongly inhibited the progression of EAE. Despite this thorough tolerance induction, some double transgenic mice developed severe signs of EAE after an extended period of time. Our data show that in the circumstances where autoantigenic priming persists, and where the number of antigen-specific T cells is high enough, autoimmunity may prevail over very potent tolerance-inducing mechanisms...|$|E
40|$|Using BALB/c and CBA/J mice, the I-region {{associated}} (Ia) binding {{capacity and}} T-cell immunogenicity of {{a panel of}} 14 overlapping peptides that span the entire sequence of the protein staphylococcal nuclease (Nase) was examined to evaluate major histocompatibility gene complex (MHC) control of T-cell responses. Ia binding and Ia-restricted T-cell immunogenicity could be determined {{for a total of}} 54 <b>peptide-MHC</b> <b>combinations.</b> Only 30 % of the 54 instances examined involved detectable Ia binding, but they represented almost all (12 of 13) of the immune responses found. However, binding to Ia was not sufficient to ensure T-cell immunogenicity, since only 70 % of the binding events were productive [...] i. e., were associated with an immune response. Thus, Ia molecules have the expected characteristics of a highly permissive capacity for antigen interaction that allows them to function as restriction elements for a large universe of antigens. On the other hand, since the Ia molecules cannot distinguish between self and non-self, not all antigen-Ia interactions would be permitted to elicit a T-cell response. It appears that both Ia binding ("determinant selection") and T-cell repertoire act in concert to define the immune response status of an individual toward any particular T-cell epitope...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAbstractBackgroundThe {{success of}} immunotherapeutics in {{oncology}} {{and the search}} for further improvements has prompted revisiting the use of cancer vaccines. In this context, knowledge of the immunogenic epitopes and the monitoring of the immune response cancer vaccines generate are essential. MUC 1 has been {{considered one of the most}} important tumor associated antigen for decades. MethodsTo identify HLA-restricted MUC 1 peptides we used eight human MHC class I transgenic mouse lines, together covering more than 80 % of the human population. MUC 1 peptides were identified by vaccinating each line with full length MUC 1 coding sequences and using an IFNγ ELIspot restimulation assay. Relevant peptides were tested in a flow cytometry-based tetramer assay and for their capacity to serve as target in an in vivo killing assay. ResultsFour previously identified MUC 1 peptides were confirmed and five are described here for the first time. These nine <b>peptide-MHC</b> <b>combinations</b> were further characterized. Six gave above-background tetramer staining of splenocytes from immunized animals and three peptides were induced more than 5 % specific in vivo killing. ConclusionsThese data describe for the first time five new HLA class I-restricted peptides and revisit some that were previously described. They also emphasize the importance of using in vivo/ex vivo models to screen for immunogenic peptides and define the functions for individual peptide-HLA combinations...|$|R
40|$|In vertebrates, {{genes of}} the major {{histocompatibility}} complex (MHC), with their pronounced polymorphism, potentially represent outstanding examples for the selective advantages of genetic diversity (1). Theoretical models predicted that, within an individual, MHC alleles can be subjected to two opposing selective forces, resulting in an optimal number of genes at intermediate individual MHC diversity (2, 3). Diversifying selection increases heterozygosity and enables wider recognition of pathogens (4). This process is opposed {{by the need to}} delete T cells that react with self <b>peptide–MHC</b> <b>combinations</b> (5) from the repertoire, which has been proposed as a possible mechanism constraining expansion of MHC genes. Because too high MHC diversity might delimit T cell diversity, it might also impose limitations on the efficiency of pathogen recognition. However, empirical evidence demonstrating fitness benefits in terms of parasite resistance caused by this type of optimal MHC diversity has been lacking. Therefore, we tested whether three-spined sticklebacks (Gasterosteus aculeatus L.) carrying an intermediate level of individual MHC diversity also displayed the strongest level of resistance against parasite infection. Sticklebacks are particularly suited to test MHC optimality, because MHC class II genotypes can differ markedly in the number of MHC class IIB alleles (6). We caught fish from an outbred population and used these to breed six sibships of immunologically naïve fish (i. e., they had no previous contact to parasites). Immunogenetic diversity ranged from three to nine MHC class IIB alleles found in reverse-transcribed messenger RNA (mRNA) [see (6) for details on genotyping]. The MHC genotypes within these sibships segregated above and below the hypothesized optimal number of ∼ 5 MHC class IIB alleles, which had previously been estimated in an epidemiological field survey (7). In individual infection treatments, fish from all sibships were simultaneously exposed to three of the most abundant parasite species identified in the field (Fig. 1 A) (8). After two rounds of infection, separated by an interval of 8 weeks, we found a significant minimal mean infection rate at an intermediate number of individual MHC class IIB variants [i. e., 5. 82 expressed alleles (Fig. 1 B) ]. This result was also confirmed when sibships were considered separately [i. e., 4. 96 alleles (Fig. 1 C) ] (9). The strong pattern only appeared when infection with all three parasites was accounted for simultaneously. This may not be surprising, because single alleles are expected to correlate with single diseases and multiple alleles can contribute to resistance against several infectious agents (2) ...|$|R
40|$|AbstractCD 8 + T {{lymphocytes}} recognize antigens {{as short}} peptides bound to MHC class I molecules. Available methods cannot {{determine the number}} and distribution of these ligands on individual cells or detect antigen-presenting cells in tissues. Here we describe a method for eliciting and identifying monoclonal antibodies specific for a particular <b>peptide–MHC</b> class I <b>combination.</b> One such antibody can identify antigen complexes with a limit of detection approaching that of T cells. We used this antibody {{to determine the number}} of peptide–class I complexes generated upon viral infection, to identify antigen-presenting cells in cell mixtures, to determine the site of peptide–MHC class I interaction inside cells, and to visualize cells bearing specific peptide–MHC class I complexes after in vivo infection. Similar antibodies may prove useful for diagnostic or therapeutic purposes in cancer, infectious diseases, and autoimmune disorders...|$|R
