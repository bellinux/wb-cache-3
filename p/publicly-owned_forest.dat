40|$|This is a {{historical}} study of the intersection of political economy with natural resources management, as played out on the national forests between 1945 - 1991. Specifically, it focuses on two core national forest management policies; sustained yield and multiple use. These two policy directives represent {{an attempt by the}} public and elected officials to apply principles of sustainable development to <b>publicly-owned</b> <b>forest</b> lands, and to ensure that a wide variety of both market and nonmarket forest values are preserved for the benefit of present and future generations. Interest groups, the Forest Service, and policy makers have conceived of sustained yield and multiple use in different and evolving ways over the years. This study explores how these principles have been variously defined and either implemented or thwarted. After World War Two, with escalating demands on national forest resources, the U. S. Forest Service turned to "intensive management" as a technological method of enhancing natural forest productivity and mitigating the environmental effects of increased use. But the agency's optimistic vision of efficient, sustained production of forest commodities through technical mastery over nature has met overwhelming fiscal, environmental, technical, and political obstacles. Nevertheless, agency leaders, industry advocates, and politicians have consistently promulgated an optimistic faith that intensive applications of labor, capital, and technology can maximize and harmonize multiple uses, rehabilitate damaged resources, and sustain high levels of outputs in perpetuity [...] despite repeated failures to achieve balanced multiple use management and to manage grazing and timber extraction at sustainable levels. The conspiracy of optimism ideologically justifies continued unsustainably high levels of resource extraction. Changing public values since the 1960 s and the popularization of ecology have initiated a growing skepticism toward the premises of intensive management. At the same time, field level forest managers have grown frustrated with top-down imposition of resource production quotas and the lack of adequate political, fiscal, and organizational support for sound forest management. As the last old growth forests fall to the chainsaw, and as the federal subsidies required to access these remote timber stands on the national forests escalate, public controversy deepens. In this decade of the national forest centennial a revolt of conscience has erupted among grassroots Forest Service personnel, and a strong challenge from the environmental community has gained momentum. Another major period of policy evaluation and revision appears to be taking place. Whether the conspiracy of optimism can continue to sustain the old status quo is questionable...|$|E

A broad definition of forestry would include the study of trees, forests, and the habitat they provide {{as well as their}} use by people. Modern “science-based” forestry began in the nineteenth century, when Europeans looked for specialists who could address questions on wood supply and extraction both at home and in their colonies. The threat of forest loss and wood scarcity created concern for increased forest growth as well as management techniques that would improve yield. By 1891, the United States had established <b>publicly-owned</b> <b>forest</b> reserves. In 1900, the Society of American Foresters was established, as was the first School of Forestry in North America at Yale University. The U. S. Forest Service was formed three years later. This combination of professional, scholarly, and governmental resources continues to provide the core of U. S. forestry research today. Since the mid- 1940 ’s, the scope of forestry has grown in response to economics, demography, politics and social change, as well as developments in related fields of study. While at one time German was the primary language of forestry, since World War II, most research is reported in English. Knowledge of international research and practices has grown in importance since the 1980 s, particularly as broader trade in forest products influenced the health of forests. In addressing global forest concerns, international and local researchers have begun to “discover” reservoirs of indigenous knowledge concerning native forests and their use. Modern forestry education has a tradition of integrating concepts from a variety of disciplines and creating new specialties. These include forest genetics, forest ecology, forest recreation, forest economics, forest engineering, urban forestry, plantation forestry, forest pathology, and wood science. The questions addressed by forestry are often interdisciplinary or request a deep understanding of complementary disciplines. As a result, a forest science collection is most useful when it is in close proximity to a sound collection the natural, environmental, and agricultural sciences. Likewise, users of a wood science or forest engineering collection will rely on access to other collections in the physical sciences and civil, mechanical, and chemical engineering. Finally, to address the interaction of humans and the forest as a multipurpose natural resource, whether looking at income generation, recreational use, traditional knowledge and practices, conservation strategies, or sustainable practices, a forest researcher will need access to collections in the social sciences. Given these assumptions about access to other collections, we can define a distinct serial literature for forestry. First it is anchored in the history of forestry and is composed largely of government document series and international and non-governmental organization report series. In comparison to these, trade, professional, and specialized scholarly journals constitute a highly regarded, yet smaller portion of the serial information sources in forestry. The list of periodicals included here does not include government publications, although these are an important source of technical as well as scientific information. Government agencies such as the regional research and experiment stations of the U. S. Forest Service provide vital information on all aspects of forestry. Series titles such as the regional General Technical Reports are numerous and now are published electronically and made available on the Forest Service TreeSearch website. Electronic version of many Canadian government forestry report series are also available free via the web. In addition, Canadian libraries that focus on forestry will benefit from their access to the National Research Council of Canada’s many serial publications. Although they are important sources of information, statistical series and serials available from non-governmental, non-profit international organizations, as well as from research institutions, have not been included in this listing. Several statistical series and The State of the World’s Forests are available as searchable datasets and in full text from the Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) Forestry Sector website. There are numerous serial report publications now available via the internet from other non-governmental, non-profit agencies. These are particularly important for coverage of international forestry. The FAO Forestry Sector website will identify and serve as a portal to many of these resources, as will the “Forestry AgNIC” website. This selection of scholarly, academic, and trade journals for forestry is representative and by no means exhaustive. In 2001, the faculty members in the College of Forestry at Oregon State University were asked to list their most used or “top-ten” journals. This served to provide confirmation of the multidisciplinary underpinnings of forestry. It also provided the core set of scholarly titles for this list to which I have added a few titles in subsequent years. In general when selecting scholarly titles, I look for those with high-impact factor rankings or journals with a long citation half-life as provided by the Journal Citation Reports from Thomson ISI. When deciding between comparable titles, I consider the journal subscription price, and give preference to professional society publications over journals from commercial publishers. When updating this selection, I look for titles that reflect changing concerns in forestry. With this in mind, I have added Wood Material Science & Engineering. Monitoring additions to the Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) serves as an inexpensive entrée to international society publications and research journals, though attention needs to be paid to their process of peer review when the journal publisher claims to be “scholarly. ” In addition to Silva Fennica, a classic title new to open access, I have added Fire Ecology, and Mathematical and Computational Forestry & Natural Resources as strong representatives of new peer-reviewed, open-access publications. An addition that shows the changing nature of digital journals-website “hybrids” is the Eastern Native Tree Society Bulletin. With some reluctance, I removed the Journal of Forest Products Business Research. Without a programmer, it is difficult for libraries to make it accessible to their users. For anyone new to managing a forestry collection, I recommend Literature of Forestry and Agroforestry, published by Cornell University Press in 1996. It provides a useful history of the field and identifies both the monographs and serials that have defined “science-based forestry” during the last century. It serves as a good foundation for considering new areas of research and how best to provide a wide array of “evidence-based” forestry information in the future. Many academic libraries have established open-access repositories as a means of archiving their local institutional scholarship. When signing a copyright transfer agreement with the journal publisher, authors need to retain their rights to deposit a version of their article with their home institution. For that reason, I include information on “author rights” taken from publisher websites and the SHERPA-RoMEO website. These policies change as publishers merge or take over other imprints, and I encourage checking publisher and SHERPA-RoMEO websites for updates...|$|E

For the 21 st edition of MFL, I referred to an article by an Australian forest researcher for a new perspective (Vanclay, J., 2008. “Ranking forestry journals using the h-index. ” Journal of Infometrics. 2 (4) : 326 - 334). No forestry collection is complete, and many academic libraries have established open-access repositories as a means of archiving and making available their local institutional scholarship for the greater good. When signing a copyright transfer agreement with the journal publisher, authors need to retain their right to deposit a version of their article with their home institution. I have included information about these “author rights” taken from publisher websites and from the SHERPA-RoMEO website. These policies change as publishers merge or take over imprints for other reasons. I encourage checking publisher and SHERPA-RoMEO websites for updates. When updating this selection, I look for titles that reflect changing concerns and new regions of interest. The Directory of Open Access Journals (DOAJ) serves as an inexpensive entrée to international society publications and research journals. As with any journal claiming to be “scholarly” attention must be paid to the editorial and process of peer review process employed. Added in this edition are Forest Systems and International Journal of Forestry Research, both peer-reviewed, open-access publications. Removed from this edition are the American Christmas Tree Journal and the Forest Land Owner Magazine. While important to their individual audiences, these two publications offer little to non-member subscribers in the way of an added-value website and are not available electronically. Also removed after a good deal of deliberation is Environmental History, an excellent publication, sponsored in part by the Forest History Society (FHS); the forest history content of this journal seems to be in decline. However, I would encourage all public libraries to provide access to Forest History Today Magazine, an excellent annual publication available on the FHS website. Finally, to correct a selection error from the previous edition, Mathematical and Computational Forestry & Natural Resource Science has been removed because it has proven to be too narrowly focused, based on a review of new articles added since 2010. Forestry is an exciting and ever-changing field of study. For anyone new to managing a forestry collection, I recommend Literature of Forestry and Agroforestry, published by Cornell University Press in 1996. It provides a useful history of the field and identifies both the monographs and serials that have defined “science-based forestry” during the last century. It serves as a good foundation for considering new areas of research and how best to provide a wide array of “evidence-based” forestry information in the future...|$|E
30|$|The rural {{households}} in the study region have traditionally been harvesting myrtle in <b>publicly-owned</b> <b>forests</b> for their own consumption {{as well as for}} earning additional income. The problems of poverty, unemployment and a difficult economic situation dominating the rural forest communities in the region are considered to be the major causes for illegal harvesting of myrtle and the rapid degradation of its habitat. As well, the gradual but illegal encroachment of agriculture in this forest area by local farmers has {{had a significant impact on}} the process of myrtle habitat reduction and destruction.|$|R
40|$|It {{is often}} assumed that {{to say that}} nature should be {{protected}} {{for the sake of}} human beings just is to say that it should be protected because it is a means to one or more anthropocentric ends. I argue that this assumption is false. In some contexts, claims that a particular natural X should be protected for our sakes mean that X should be protected, not because it is a means to anthropocentric ends, but because it is part of something about human life that is of value: because, that is, its value is anthropocentric and constitutive rather than anthropocentric and instrumental. It follows, I suggest, that one does not need to endorse the non-anthropocentric claim that nature should be protected for its own sake in order to challenge the instrumentalist notion that it should be protected simply because it is a means to anthropocentric ends (as, say, a provider of ecosystem services). To make my case, I consider the UK Government's failed attempt to sell off England's <b>publicly-owned</b> <b>forests...</b>|$|R
40|$|Since 1987 the Region of Tuscany {{has been}} {{actively}} monitoring crown status in its forests, {{in order to}} protect them from atmospheric pollution, biotic factors and environmental change. Over this period the Region has performed periodical inventories on crown condition in <b>publicly-owned</b> <b>forests</b> (Level I network) and established a network of permanent plots (MON. I. TO., Level II – III) to study long-term changes occurring in forest ecosystems. Some of these permanent plots were later included in the national programme CONECOFOR, managed by the Ministry for Policy in Agriculture and Forest. Currently a further development of MON. I. TO. is being implemented, called MONITO III – TOpModel, the aim of which is to broaden the information potential of the monitoring system to include carbon stocks and biodiversity evaluation. This paper provides an up-to-date report on the status of the various surveys and recommends a closer connection between MON. I. TO. and the other regional information systems, especially the Regional Forest Inventory, in order to produce information that may be useful in forest planning and in Sustainable Forest Management...|$|R
40|$|Invasive {{pests and}} {{diseases}} in trees impose {{a range of}} costs on society related to reductions in timber values, impacts on recreational opportunities and effects on forest biodiversity. These costs {{need to be considered}} when assessing control options and developing public policy. We investigate the preferences and willingness to pay of the UK general public for a range of forest disease control measures using a choice experiment with a sample of 605 people. Respondents were relatively well informed about general tree disease-related issues, such as causes and general measures to minimise the risk of disease spread. They were less knowledgeable about specific tree diseases, with Dutch elm disease and chalara ash dieback being the most well known. We find that disease control programmes in <b>publicly-owned</b> <b>forests</b> and forests owned by charitable trusts {{are more likely to be}} supported by the public than equivalent control programmes in privately-owned and/or commercial forests. The nature of scientific uncertainty about diseases does not affect peoples’ preferences for disease control measures significantly. Higher respondent income, greater ex-ante knowledge about tree diseases, and more frequent visits to forests are correlated with greater willingness to support publicly-funded tree disease control programmes in forests. Better knowledge about tree diseases also improves the clarity of respondents’ choices. We find a negative sentiment against some disease control measures, such as clear felling of a forest, and chemical or biocide spraying. We conclude that there is significant public support for part-financing forest disease control policies in the UK, but that this is conditional on forest ownership and the type of control measures used...|$|R
40|$|Applying fuel {{reduction}} treatments (FRTs) to forested landscapes can alleviate undesirable {{changes in}} wildfire {{benefits and costs}} due to climate change. A conceptual framework was developed for determining the preferred FRTs across planning periods, adapting FRTs to future climate change, assessing the sustainability of adaptive responses to climate change, and evaluating {{the validity of the}} two premises motivating this issue of Sustainability. The conceptual framework: (1) accounts for uncertainty about future climate change and its effects on management objectives for FRTs; (2) employs biophysical simulation and mental models to estimate the management objectives for FRTs; (3) uses fuzzy TOPSIS to determine the preferred FRTs for climate futures; (4) employs the minimax regret criterion to identify the preferred FRT for each planning period; (5) determines the best strategy for adapting FRTs to future climate change; and (6) assesses landscape sustainability when using the preferred FRTs. The framework is demonstrated with constructed examples for adapting FRTs to climate change for privately- and <b>publicly-owned</b> <b>forested</b> landscapes. Based on the conceptual framework, current knowledge does not allow determining with certainty whether managers’ adaptations of FRTs to future climate change are sustainable or unsustainable due to type I and II decision errors...|$|R
2500|$|An {{urban forest}} [...] is a forest or a {{collection}} of trees that grow within a city, town or a suburb. In a wider sense it may include any kind of woody plant vegetation growing in and around human settlements. In a narrower sense [...] (also called forest park) it describes areas whose ecosystems are inherited from wilderness leftovers or remnants. Care and management of urban forests is called urban forestry. Urban <b>forests</b> may be <b>publicly-owned</b> municipal <b>forests,</b> but the latter may also be located outside of the town or city to which they belong.|$|R
40|$|Rural {{communities}} in the western U. S. and Alaska are highly dependent upon surrounding <b>publicly-owned</b> <b>forests</b> for various economic and non-economic values. Historically, limited data has hampered the understanding of such community-resource linkages. As a result, community interests may not be adequately considered in forest management plan development and policy formulation. Addressing this imbalance {{is an important issue}} for the U. S. Forest Service (USFS), particularly as it shifts from timberdominated goals to a more holistic ecosystem-based form of management. This study seeks to understand community-resource use linkages, dependency, and vulnerability surrounding the Chugach and Tongass NFs using place-level socioeconomic data from the 2000 U. S. Census in combination with permit data from the USFS’s Timber Information Management Data System (TIM) and Special Use Data System (SUDS). Information on permittees’ activities on forestland and socioeconomic profiles of permittee’s community-of-origin are found to be valuable, not only for forest management and planning purposes, but also for community-level social assessment. An examination of 2007 permit data found that a majority of permit holders were local residents. These communities are found to be dependent on the two forests for various types of activities and are thus more likely to be vulnerable to changes in forest management and policies. The analysis also identified some limitations that may affect the quality of permit data and its potential use in community impact assessments. Despite these limitations of permit data, the methodologies utilized here demonstrate how TIM and SUDS data, in combination with U. S. Census data, could be used to describe Alaska residents’ socioeconomic profiles for communities located in close proximity to the Tongass and Chugach NFs. Such information can assist USFS managers in deriving community-level estimates of forest resource use, degree of dependency, and vulnerability to the likely impacts of alternatives management approaches. Finally, recommendations are given to improve data recording, maintenance, and use in order to better understand communities that are dependent on forest resources in both the Chugach and Tongass NFs, and to specifically identify those communities potentially vulnerable to changes in forest management policies...|$|R
