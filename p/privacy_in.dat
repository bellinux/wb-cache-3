5|$|In his {{judgment}} of 29 January 2008, Justice Woo ordered Pacific Internet to release its subscribers' information {{only to the}} six Japanese companies that were parties to the case. He explicitly denied Odex access to this information. He upheld District Judge Lau's decision that Odex was not the correct party to have asked for release of subscriber data. As a result, he directed the company to pay Pacific Internet's legal costs of S$20,000. Following the ruling, some downloaders who had already settled with Odex planned a countersuit to recover their settlement monies. The ruling may have set a precedent for online <b>privacy</b> <b>in</b> Singapore by {{making it more difficult}} for copyright licensees to take legal action against downloaders.|$|E

5|$|The Singaporean anime {{community}} considered Odex's {{actions to}} be controversial, sudden, and heavy-handed—especially {{when it was}} discovered that the youngest person threatened was nine years old. In response, Odex dropped its pay-or-be-sued letter approach in favour of cease-and-desist emails to downloaders. Odex halted active enforcement after its third subpoena was rejected by the courts and lost a lawsuit when trying to obtain customer data from another ISP. In January 2008, Odex appealed the decision, and the High Court of Singapore ruled that one ISP was required to release data, but only directly to Japanese anime studios. Subsequently, these studios started their own legal actions against Singaporean downloaders. Some observers predicted that the High Court's decision would set a precedent for online <b>privacy</b> <b>in</b> Singapore by making it more difficult for copyright licensees to take legal action against downloading. The case raised issues of individual privacy, intellectual property, and free use of the Internet. Odex's actions attracted widespread criticism in Singapore and international attention and press coverage, which coincided with similar actions against consumer file sharing of music in the United States.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — Privacy-preservation in {{data mining}} {{is used to}} {{safeguard}} susceptible information from unsanctioned disclosure. Due to the increasing ability to store personal data about users <b>in</b> <b>privacy</b> {{is an important issue}} involved data publishing. The different techniques such as bucketization, generalization have been proposed to perform privacy-preservation in data publishing. Recent work has shown that the technique generalization does not support for high-dimensional data. And also, bucketization cannot prevent membership disclosure and does not apply for data that do not have a clear separation between quasi-identifying attributes and sensitive attributes. The anonymization procedure, such as generalization along with bucketization, is actually intended regarding <b>privacy</b> conservation <b>in</b> microdata creating. In this paper, we presented different techniques of <b>privacy</b> preservation <b>in</b> data publishing.

We then establish necessary and sufficient conditions that characterize when V preserves the <b>privacy</b> of Q <b>in</b> terms of the projected inequalities in the queries, both for conjunctive queries and queries with negation. We also show that integrity constraints {{have an effect on}} privacy, and derive a test for ensuring <b>privacy</b> preservation <b>in</b> the presence of FD constraints. The issue of <b>privacy</b> preservation <b>in</b> the presence of multiple views is investigated, and we show that it can reduced to the single view case for a suitably chosen view. 1...|$|R
