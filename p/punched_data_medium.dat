50|$|In many data {{processing}} applications, the punched cards were verified by keying {{exactly the same}} data a second time, {{checking to see if}} the second keying and the <b>punched</b> <b>data</b> were the same (known as two pass verification). There was a great demand for keypunch operators, usually women, who worked full-time on keypunch and verifier machines, often in large keypunch departments with dozens or hundreds of other operators, all performing data input. In the 1950s, Remington Rand introduced the UNITYPER, which enabled data entry directly to magnetic tape for UNIVAC systems. Mohawk Data Sciences subsequently produced an improved magnetic tape encoder in 1965, which was somewhat successfully marketed as a keypunch replacement. The rise of microprocessors and inexpensive computer terminals {{led to the development of}} additional key-to-tape and key-to-disk systems from smaller companies such as Inforex and Pertec.|$|R

50|$|An IBM {{card sorter}} is a machine for sorting decks of punched {{cards in the}} format popularized by the International Business Machines Corporation (IBM), which {{dominated}} the <b>punched</b> card <b>data</b> processing industry {{for much of the}} twentieth century. Sorting was a major activity in most facilities that processed <b>data</b> on <b>punched</b> cards using unit record equipment. The work flow of many processes required decks of cards to be put into some specific order as determined by the <b>data</b> <b>punched</b> in the cards. The same deck might be sorted differently for different processing steps. The IBM 80 series sorters sorted input cards into one of 13 pockets depending on the holes punched in a selected column and the sorter's settings.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Even in {{distance}} learning institutions, the students choose in 80 % {{of the cases}} paper as <b>data</b> <b>medium.</b> Researches have shown that they are primarily motivated by the mobility of the medium itself and the mobility granted to its user. It seemed interesting to examine to what extent currently available mobile devices can offer the students greater mobility and to evaluate their multimedia integration. Paper is the most used <b>data</b> <b>medium</b> in e-learning, but also offers the least possibilities from a technological point of view. At the University of Applied Sciences Valais, several experiments were conducted on mobile technologies (mobile phones, PDA 1, Pocket PC), enabling students to interact with an e-learning platform. The development platform used was i-learn, the platform implemented at the University of Applied Sciences Valais. This paper points out the concrete advantages of mobile learning and describes the development of two types of PDA in relation to an e-learning platform: Palm Pilot and Pocket PC. The technologies and languages used were. net and C++. The pedagogical, technological as well as communicational aspects were taken into account. MOBILITY AND LEARNIN...|$|R

40|$|Unmanned {{systems have}} been cited {{as one of the}} future {{enablers}} of all the services to assist the warfighter in dominating the battlespace. The potential benefits of unmanned systems are being closely investigated – from providing increased and potentially stealthy surveillance, removing the warfighter from harms way, to reducing the manpower required to complete a specific job. In many instances, data obtained from an unmanned system is used sparingly, being applied only to the mission at hand. Other potential benefits to be gained from the data are overlooked and, after completion of the mission, the data is often discarded or lost. However, this data can be further exploited to offer tremendous tactical, operational, and strategic value. To show the potential value of this otherwise lost data, we designed a system that persistently stores the data in its original format from the unmanned vehicle and then generates a new, innovative <b>data</b> <b>medium</b> for further analysis. The system streams imagery and video from an unmanned system (original data format) and then constructs a 3 D model (new <b>data</b> <b>medium)</b> using structure-from-motion. The 3 D generated model provides warfighters additional situational awareness, tactical and strategic advantages that the original video stream lacks.
