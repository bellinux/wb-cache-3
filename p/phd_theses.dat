25|$|As the 1980s {{cognitive}} revolution made {{inquiry into}} internal subjective states respectable again, scientists returned to synesthesia. Led in the United States by Larry Marks and Richard Cytowic, {{and later in}} England by Simon Baron-Cohen and Jeffrey Gray, researchers explored the reality, consistency, and frequency of synesthetic experiences. In the late 1990s, the focus settled on grapheme → color synesthesia, {{one of the most}} common and easily studied types. Psychologists and neuroscientists study synesthesia not only for its inherent appeal, but also for the insights it may give into cognitive and perceptual processes that occur in synesthetes and non-synesthetes alike. Synesthesia is now the topic of scientific books and papers, <b>PhD</b> <b>theses,</b> documentary films, and even novels.|$|E
500|$|Bush's {{music was}} {{under-represented}} in the concert repertoire in his lifetime, and virtually disappeared after his death. The 2000 centenary {{of his birth}} was markedly low key; the Prom season ignored him, {{although there was a}} memorial concert at the Wigmore Hall on 1 November, and a BBC broadcast of the Piano Concerto on 19 December. [...] The centenary, albeit [...] quietly observed, helped to introduce the name and music of Bush to a new generation of music lovers, and generated an increase in both performance and recordings. The centenary also heralded an awakening of scholarly interest in Bush, whose life and works were the subject of numerous <b>PhD</b> <b>theses</b> in the early 20th century. Scholars such as Paul Harper-Scott and Joanna Bullivant have obtained access to new material, including documents released since the collapse of the Soviet Union, and Bush's MI5 file. [...] This, says Bullivant, enables a more informed assessment of the interrelationships within [...] Bush's music and his communism, and of the inherent conflicting priorities.|$|E

2500|$|Stereo Review, {{by way of}} {{introducing}} The Loud Family and eulogizing Game Theory, called Miller [...] "an entity unto himself, taking dictation from a mind working overtime without stopping {{to consider the possibility}} of success or banishment. Problem is, [...] others have squeezed through the needle's eye to varying degrees... Miller still labors in semi-obscurity, his back catalog bulging like <b>Ph.D.</b> <b>theses</b> interred in some musty corner of a rarely visited library." [...] Assessing Miller's prospects of success, the article continued:Let's face it: Smart rock doesn't sell. Despite the best efforts of critics, despite the support of introspective, collegiate humanities majors who have assimilation problems, even despite the soft spot certain record companies occasionally show for music with a brain, the market share is marginal. Therefore, to persevere at making hyperliterate music that has complex motives and is densely constructed—relative to the immediate sparkle and shine of mainstream chart music, that is—is an act of bravery, commitment, or lunacy.|$|E

2500|$|The {{controversy}} {{began in}} 2002 when Max Niedermaier, {{a physicist at}} the University of Tours, emailed Ted Newman, a physicist at the University of Pittsburgh, alleging that the twins—who had previously had celebrity status for a science fiction television program in France—had spoofed their <b>PhD</b> <b>theses.</b> Rumors spread on Usenet newsgroups that the work was a deliberate hoax intended to target weaknesses in the peer review system employed by the physics community to select papers for publication in academic journals. The story spread like wildfire in public media, prompting Niedermaier to offer an apology to the Bogdanovs, admitting {{that he had not}} read the papers firsthand. While the Bogdanov brothers continued to defend the veracity of their work, a Centre national de la recherche scientifique (CNRS) internal report was conducted in private. [...] The conclusions of their reports are confidential and only released to the parties involved. [...] Some physicists have also treated this as evidence of the fallibility inherent within the peer review system. The debate over whether the work represented a contribution to physics, or instead was meaningless, spread from Usenet to many other Internet forums, including the blogs of notable physicists. The ensuing dispute received considerable coverage in the mainstream media.|$|E
2500|$|In 2001 and 2002 the {{brothers}} published five papers in peer-reviewed physics journals, including Annals of Physics and Classical and Quantum Gravity. [...] The {{controversy over the}} Bogdanovs' work began on October 22, 2002, with an email sent by University of Tours physicist Max Niedermaier to University of Pittsburgh physicist Ezra T. Newman. [...] Niedermayer suggested that the Bogdanovs' <b>Ph.D.</b> <b>theses</b> and papers were [...] "spoof," [...] created by throwing together string theory and theoretical physics jargon: [...] "The abstracts are delightfully meaningless combinations of buzzwords ... which apparently have been taken seriously." [...] Copies of the email reached American mathematical physicist John Baez, and on October 23 he created a discussion thread about the Bogdanovs' work on the Usenet newsgroup sci.physics.research, titled [...] "Physics bitten by reverse Alan Sokal hoax?" [...] Baez was comparing the Bogdanovs' publications to the 1996 Sokal affair, in which physicist Alan Sokal successfully submitted an intentionally nonsensical paper to a cultural studies journal in order to criticize the incoherence of postmodernism. The Bogdanovs quickly became a popular discussion topic, with most respondents agreeing that the papers were flawed. [...] The Bogdanovs' background in entertainment lent some plausibility {{to the idea that}} they were attempting a deliberate hoax, but Igor Bogdanov quickly denied the accusation. [...] The online discussion was quickly followed by media attention; The Register reported on the dispute on November 1, 2002 [...] and stories in The Chronicle of Higher Education, Nature, The New York Times, and other publications appeared soon after.|$|E

On {{the basis of the}} ǧāh pyramid it focuses on each aspect: Sovereign as a source of legitimacy of political power, the vizier as a major counterpart to the ruler, the inner circle of emir in which was concentrated the remaining part of the political elite, and also the Naṣrid women. Vizier, as the most significant part of this group, was eventually transformed to the role of regent and ruler's public representative. From the early 14 th century with his power he began to tie the sovereign's power itself and he took over it almost permanently in the 15 th century. The emphasis [...] ...|$|R
