50|$|A choke {{connection}} is formed by mating one <b>choke</b> <b>flange</b> and one cover (or gasket/cover) flange. The central {{region of the}} <b>choke</b> <b>flange</b> face is very slightly recessed {{so that it does}} not touch the face of the cover flange, but is separated from it by a narrow gap. The recessed region is bounded by a deep choke trench (or ditch or groove) cut into the face of the <b>flange.</b> <b>Choke</b> <b>flanges</b> are only used with rectangular waveguide, and are invariably pressurizable, having a gasket groove encircling the choke ditch.

For <b>choke</b> <b>flanges</b> this means that the depth to which the face is recessed, and the width of the resulting gap is fixed when the flange is manufactured and will not change when it is attached.

40|$|We {{present the}} first micromachined {{double-sided}} contactless WR 03 pin-flange adapter for 220 - 325 GHz based on gap waveguide technology. The pin-flange adapter {{is used to}} avoid leakage at the interface of two waveguides even when a gap between them is present and can be fitted onto any standard WR 03 waveguide flange. Tolerance measurements were performed with gaps ranging from 30 - 100 mu m. The performance of the micromachined pin flange {{has been compared to}} a milled pin <b>flange,</b> a <b>choke</b> <b>flange</b> and to standard waveguide connections. The micromachined pin flange is shown to have better performance than the standard connection and similar performance to the milled pin <b>flange</b> and <b>choke</b> <b>flange.</b> The benefits of micromachining over milling are the possibility to mass produce pin flanges and the better accuracy in the 2 D design. Measurements were performed with and without screws fixing the flanges. The flanges have also been applied to measure two devices, a straight rectangular waveguide of 1. 01 inch and a ridge gap resonator. In all cases, the micromachined pin flange performed flawlessly while the standard flange experienced significant losses at already small gaps...|$|R

A constellation of such small SAR satellites is promising for shot revisit time of earth observations.

RF instruments are on a satellite structure and RF signal {{is fed to a}} deployable antenna through a non-contact <b>choke</b> <b>flange</b> at a hinge.

50|$|Because {{the working}} of a choke {{connection}} {{depends on the}} wavelength, its impedance can be zero at at most one frequency within the operating band of the waveguide. However, by making the gap extremely narrow, and the choke ditch relatively wide, the input impedance can be kept small over a broad frequency band. For gap and ditch widths in a fixed proportion, the connection input impedance is approximately proportional to either width (doubling both widths is like having two connections in series). Increasing just the ditch width, increases its input impedance proportionately, and to a some extent decreases the transformed impedance, though the effect is limited when the gap-length is not exactly one quarter wavelength. The MIL-spec <b>choke</b> <b>flanges</b> have a gap width of between 2% and 3% of the waveguide height (the smaller inner dimension of the guide), which for WR28 waveguide (WG22) amounts to a gap of just 3 thousandths of an inch. The choke ditch in these flanges is some 8 times wider (around 20% of the waveguide height), although the proportions vary considerably, as the width-to-height ratio of the standard mid-size guides deviates from 2:1. MIL-Spec <b>choke</b> <b>flanges</b> are intended for use over the full recommended operational frequency band of the waveguide(that is roughly from 1.3 to 1.9 time the guide cutoff).|$|R
50|$|IEC flanges are {{identified}} by an alphanumeric code consisting of; the letter U, P or C for Unpressurizable (plain cover), Pressurizable (with a gasket groove) and Choke (with both choke gasket grooves); a second letter, indicating {{the shape and}} other details of the flange and finally the IEC identifier for the waveguide. For standard rectangular waveguide the second letter is A to E, where A and C are round flanges, B is square and D and E are rectangular. So for example UBR220 is a square plain cover flange for R220 waveguide (that is, for WG20, WR42), PDR84 is a rectangular gasket flange for R84 waveguide (WG15, WR112) and CAR70 is a round <b>choke</b> <b>flange</b> for R70 waveguide (WG14, WR137).|$|R
40|$|We have {{proposed}} a novel SAR system compatible with a 100 kg-class small satellite. This SAR development is funded for four years (2016 - 2019) by Japanese government. At present we are developing engineering model (EM). This paper describes the EM test preliminary results and the future plan. The specifications of SAR observation are single polarization SAR with 1 m ground resolution at minimum. A size of the satellite is 0. 7 m x 0. 7 m x 0. 7 m on a rocket. A size of the deployed antenna is 4. 9 m x 0. 7 m. Novel parallel-plate slotted array antennas made of honeycomb panel have been developed. Six outputs from GaN HEMT power amplifiers are combined in a waveguide resonator and 1 kW RF transmitting power is fed to the antenna trough non-contact <b>choke</b> <b>flanges</b> at deployable hinges (patented) ...|$|R
5000|$|At the {{operational}} {{frequency of the}} <b>choke</b> <b>flange,</b> {{the depth of the}} ditch is approximately one quarter of a wavelength. This is somewhat longer {{than a quarter of the}} free-space wavelength, since the electric field also varies in going around the ditch, having two changes of polarity, or one complete wave in the circumference. The ditch thus constitutes a quarter-wave resonant short-circuit stub, and has a high (ideally infinite) input impedance at its mouth. This high impedance is in series with the metal-to-metal connection between the flanges, and minimizes the current across it. The distance from the main waveguide through the gap to the ditch is likewise one quarter of a wavelength in the E-plane. The gap thus forms a quarter-wave transformer, transforming the high impedance at the top of the ditch to a low (ideally zero) impedance at the broad wall of the waveguide.|$|R
40|$|SLAC {{participates in}} the U. S. High Gradient {{collaboration}} whose charter includes basic studies of rf breakdown properties in accelerating structures. These studies include experiments with different materials and construction methods for single cell standing wave accelerating structures. The most commonly used method of joining cells of such structures is the high temperature bonding and/or brazing in hydrogen and/or vacuum. These high temperature processes may not be suitable {{for some of the}} new materials that are under consideration. We propose to build structures from cells with an rf choke, taking the cell-to-cell junction out of the electromagnetic field region. These cells may be clamped together in a vacuum enclosure, the choke joint ensuring continuity of rf currents. Next, we propose a structure with a choke joint in a high gradient cell and a view port which may allow us microscopic, in-situ observation of the metal surface during high power tests. And third, we describe the design of a TM 01 <b>choke</b> <b>flange</b> for these structures...|$|R
50|$|It is {{considered}} wrong to join together two choke flanges; the resulting {{gap between the}} flange faces is twice that intended, and the effect {{is similar to that}} of having two joins in the guide rather than one. In the absence of unpressurizable <b>choke</b> <b>flanges,</b> all flanges fall into one of three categories: choke, gasket/cover and cover. An E-plane cross section of an assembled choke connection is shown in figure 3. This is the plane cutting each of the broad walls of the waveguide along its centre-line, which is where the longitudinal surface currents—those that must cross the join—are at their strongest. The choke ditch and the gap between the flange faces together form a somewhat convoluted side-branch to the path of the main guide. This side branch is designed to present a low input impedance where it meets the broad walls of the waveguide, so that the surface currents there are not obstructed by the gap, but instead flow onto and off of the separated faces of the flanges. Conversely, on the outer edge of the choke ditch, at the point where the two flanges come into physical contact, the ditch presents a high series impedance. The current through the contact point is thus reduced to a small value, and the danger of arcing across any crack between the flanges is likewise reduced.|$|R
40|$|A {{multifaceted}} {{program to}} study high gradient structures and properties of RF breakdown {{is under way}} at SLAC. This program includes testing of simplified versions of traveling wave and standing wave structures at 11. 4 GHz. [Dolgashev] RF power is fed into these structures using a TE 01 mode-launcher. An RF flange is used to connect the mode-launcher to the test-structure. The rf currents flow through either the stainless steel lip on the flange or, in an alternate assembly, through a copper gasket pressed between the same stainless steel lips. In a recent experiment with a single cell traveling wave structure, a flange with stainless steel lips was irreversibly damaged at RF power about 90 MW and {approx} 100 ns pulse length. We suggest an alternative flange that does not rely on metal-to-metal contact in the rf power transfer region. The idea is to use an asymmetric <b>choke</b> <b>flange,</b> where the <b>choke</b> grove is cut into a conflate flange on the mode-launcher. The structures themselves will have a simpler, flat conflate flange with rounded corners on the vacuum side. The Vacuum seal is achieved with a Cu gasket between these two flanges above the RF region. We have designed a <b>flange</b> with a <b>choke</b> which is almost field free in the vacuum gasket region, whose technical specifications and RF properties are presented below. Design simulations were conducted using HFSS, a 3 D finite element code that solves electromagnetic fields in complex structures. Figure 1 demonstrates the projected physical look of the <b>choke</b> <b>flange,</b> while {{the table next to}} it lists the critical parameters. The maximum electric field for in this geometry is on axis at 33. 6 MV/m for 100 MW input. The electric field near the gasket, meaning {{at the top of the}} choke gap is at 125 kV/m or 1. 25 kV/cm. Figure 2 demonstrates the electric field strength profile in the geometry for 100 MW input power. The maximum magnetic field for in this geometry is near the pipe at 59 kA/m for 100 MW input. The magnetic field at the gasket at the top of the choke gap is at 225 A/m or 2. 25 /cm. Figure 3 demonstrates the magnetic field strength profile in the geometry for 100 MW input power...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} two {{calibrated}} measurement methods for submillimeter circuits are presented and micromachined waveguides operating between 220 and 325 GHz have been fabricated using thick SU- 8 photoresist technology and tested. The first measurement method {{is achieved by}} employing a pair of micromachined embedded H-plane bends, which were specially designed to enable direct and accurate connection between the micromachined circuit and standard waveguide flanges. A 16 mm long WR- 3 waveguide has been designed, fabricated and measured using this technology. The measured average insertion loss is 2. 3 dB or 0. 144 dB/mm over the frequency range of 220 - 321 GHz. The second measurement technology employs a conventionally machined metal block constructed with two separate pieces in which to mount the micromachined circuit. A <b>choke</b> <b>flange</b> has been adopted for eliminating the effect of air gap at the interfaces between the micromachined circuit and metal block. A 15 mm long WR- 3 straight waveguide has been fabricated and tested. The measured insertion loss is between 1. 4 dB and 3. 2 dB corresponding to 0. 093 and 0. 213 dB/mm.

40|$|The elucidation of {{microwave}} loss {{mechanisms in}} epitaxially grown high temperature superconductor (HTSC) films {{is of great}} importance not only for fundamental research but also for possible microwave applications. Therefore, highly sensitive measurements of the surface impedance Z_S=R_S+i#omega##mu#_ 0 #lambda# of HTSC films of different quality are required. The sensitivity and absolute accuracy of a cylindrical copper cavity (87 GHz) on which 1 cm" 2 samples were mounted as endplates, has been improved for R_S(T) and triangle #lambda#(T) measurements. A new niobium cavity with a <b>choke</b> <b>flange</b> has been constructed and successfully tested up to background quality factors of more than 10 " 6 at 87 GHz. It allows even more sensitive measurements of the surface resistance R_S of optimized YBa_ 2 Cu_ 3 O_ 7 _-_#delta# films and it enables scanning R_S measurements of large-area films. In order to measure R_S {{as a function of}} frequency and microwave power, new approaches based on niobium conterparts, a modified parallel plate (7 - 20 GHz) and a dielectric resonator based on a sapphire disc (19. 3 GHz), have been developed. The observed correlations between the penetration depth #lambda#(0), the resistivity #rho#(100 K), the slope triangle #rho#/ triangle T, the shape of R_S(T) at intermediate temperatures and the exponent #alpha# of the frequency scaling(R_S#propor to#f"#alpha#) support the assumption that R_S is influenced in a complex way by many parameters, but {{the most important of these}} are the oxygen content and the scattering time of the unpaired charge carriers. The overall temperature dependence of Z_S cannot be explained by a single energy gap, but the data can be well described by a two-band model based on s-wave BCS theory with a larger gap associated with the CuO-planes and a smaller gap in the chains.

40|$|The {{status of}} the Rossendorf superconducting RF gun is discussed. This gun allows {{continuous}} wave operation with an energy of 9. 5 MeV and an average current of 1 mA. The 3 cell niobium cavity contains a normal conducting photocathode. A special <b>choke</b> <b>flange</b> filter at the cathode side prevent the RF leakage of the cavity. The design of the cavity, the tuner, the RF coupler the LHevessel together with the cryostat is finished and now in manufacturing. In the paper three features are discussed, which follows from the special demands of the 3 cell superconducting RF gun. The first feature is the tuning system. For the cavity two different tuners are necessary, one for the half cell (gun cell) {{and one for the}} accelerating cells. The second feature is the tuning of the cathode. The beam properties depend very sensitive on the cathode position. Therefore a special cathode tuner has been developed, which allows to move and to adjust the cathode position inside the cavity. The third no conventional feature is the excitation of a second RF mode inside the cavity. This is a magnetic mode (TE mode) which replaces the static magnetic field in normal conducting RF guns and decreases the transverse emittance of the beam by more than a factor of two.

40|$|A low-noise {{microwave}} receiver {{was designed}} and fabricated to provide the necessary sensitivity to detect the helium 3 line. In order to achieve ultra-low noise amplification in the input states of this receiver, cascaded non-degenerate cryogenically cooled parametric amplifiers were used. These amplifiers were followed by a tunnel diode amplifier and a mixer-preamplifier which provides a total system gain of approximately 60 db. The parametric amplifiers were cooled to the cryogenic temperature by a closed-cycle gaseous helium refrigerator. The ambient operating temperature provided by the refrigerator was approximately 18 °K. The parametric amplifiers were pumped with a Ka-band klystron which provides a signal-to-idler ratio of approximately 0. 38. Gain stability was achieved by using waveguide ferrite current variable attenuators which were used to control the pump power as required to maintain a constant varactor current. The system was designed to consist of two major assemblies. One of the assemblies is packaged in a 30 x 30 x 60 inch weather proof enclosure for mounting at {{the focal point of}} the National Radio Astronomy Observatory 140 foot radio telescope. This enclosure includes a thermoelectric cooling and heating system to maintain a constant temperature inside the assembly under all weather condition. The second assembly was packaged in a standard relay rack type cabinet. This unit contains all of the receiver control, monitoring and special remote test circuits. The two assemblies were designed to operate with connecting cable lengths of up to 500 feet. During the first observing period, the noise temperature performance of the receiver was about three times that expected, i. e., 100 °K. However, the stability of the system was sufficient to allow long integration periods so that usable data was obtained. To correct the noise temperature performance, the parametric amplifiers were redesigned, particularly in the area of thermal conductivity. In addition, the manufacturer and package style of the varactor was changed to terminate the high failure rate that had occurred in the diodes. In addition to the low-noise temperature and excellent gain stability achieved by this receiver, several new concepts were utilized in the design of the system which greatly improved its mechanical and thermal properties. One of these is a special non-contacting <b>choke</b> <b>flange</b> on the input line to the parametric amplifiers which allows the input line to be short and unrestricted in location. The system will be utilized again in the summer of 1970. The present performance of the system should provide data which is far superior to that obtained in the last observing period since for the same signal-to-noise ratio, the integration time should be reduced by a factor of four or more...|$|R
