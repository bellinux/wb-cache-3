40|$|Thiols such as N-acetylcystein (NAC) {{are used}} to {{replenish}} glutathione (GSH) level, {{with regard to their}} function in the maintenance of cellular reduction-oxidation balance and control of oxidative stress. Thiols {{play a role in the}} reductive metabolism of nitrates to NO, an important signaling molecule in the cardiovascular system as well as other systems throughout the body. This study aimed to evaluate the influence of NAC on decomposition of different organic nitrate esters according to its potential i. e., <b>pentaerythrityl</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> (PETN) and isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN). The results showed that NAC gives a rapid and significant decrease of PETN and ISDN during the incubation period. During the experiment, about 85 % of PETN were decomposed, while the decomposition of ISDN was about 20 %. Detection of nitrite and elucidation of disulphide bond of NAC gives evidence that confirms the presence of reactions...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Ischemic and pharmacologic {{preconditioning}} {{have great}} clinical potential, {{but it remains}} unclear whether their effects can be maintained over time during repeated exposure. We have previously demonstrated that the acute protective effect of nitroglycerin (GTN) is attenuated during repeated daily administration. <b>Pentaerythrityl</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> (PETN) is an organic nitrate with different hemodynamic and biochemical properties. The {{purpose of the current}} experiment was to study the preconditioning-like effects of PETN and GTN during repeated daily exposure. METHODS AND RESULTS: In a randomized, investigator-blind parallel trial, 30 healthy (age 25 - 32) volunteers were randomized to receive (1) transdermal GTN (0. 6 mg/h) administered for 2 h a day for 6 days; (2) oral PETN (80 mg) once a day for 6 days; or (3) no therapy. One week later, endothelium-dependent flow-mediated dilation was assessed before and after exposure to ischemia and reperfusion (IR). IR caused a significant blunting of the endothelium-dependent relaxation in the control group (FMD before IR: 5. 8 ± 2. 1...|$|E
40|$|Background and purpose: The {{regulation}} of vascular soluble guanylyl cyclase (sGC) expression by nitric oxide (NO) {{is still under}} discussion. In vitro, NO {{has been shown to}} downregulate the expression of sGC but it is unclear if this mechanism is operative in vivo and occurs during nitrate treatment. Experimental approach: We investigated whether high dose isosorbide mononitrate (ISMN) or <b>pentaerythrityl</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> (PETN) treatment changes vascular sGC expression and activity in vivo. New Zealand White rabbits received a standard diet, 2 or 200 mg ISMN kg 1 d 1 for 16 weeks, and C 57 BL/ 6 mice received a standard diet, 6, 60 or 300 mg PETN kg 1 d 1 for four weeks. Absorption was checked by measuring the plasma levels of the drug/metabolite. Key results: Western blots of rabbit aortic rings showed similar protein levels of sGC a 1 - (P 0. 2790) and b 1 -subunits (P 0. 6900) in all groups. Likewise, ANOVA showed that {{there was no difference in}} the expression of sGC in lungs of PETN-treated mice (P 0. 0961 for a 1 and P 0. 3709 for b 1). The activities of isolated sGC in response to SNAP (1 mM– 1 mM) were identical in aortae of ISMN-treated rabbits (P 0. 0775) and lungs of PETN-treated mice (P 0. 6348). The aortic relaxation response to SNAP slightly decreased at high ISMN but not at high PETN. Conclusions and implications: These data refute the hypothesis that therapeutic treatment with long acting NO donors has a significant impact on the {{regulation of}} vascular sGC expression and activity in vivo...|$|E
40|$|Objective—Nitrate {{tolerance}} {{is likely}} attributable {{to an increased}} production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) leading to an inhibition of the mitochondrial aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH- 2), representing the nitroglycerin (GTN) and <b>pentaerythrityl</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> (PETN) bioactivating enzyme, and to impaired nitric oxide bioactivity and signaling. We tested whether differences in their capacity to induce heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1) might explain why PETN and not GTN therapy is devoid of nitrate and cross-tolerance. Methods and Results—Wistar rats were treated with PETN or GTN (10. 5 or 6. 6 g/kg/min for 4 days). In contrast to GTN, PETN did not induce nitrate tolerance or cross-tolerance as assessed by isometric tension recordings in isolated aortic rings. Vascular protein and mRNA expression of HO- 1 and ferritin were increased in response to PETN but not GTN. In contrast to GTN therapy, NO signaling, ROS formation, and the activity of ALDH- 2 (as assessed by an high-performance liquid chromatography–based method) were not significantly influenced by PETN. Inhibition of HO- 1 expression by apigenin induced “tolerance ” to PETN whereas HO- 1 gene induction by hemin prevented tolerance in GTN treated rats. Conclusions—HO- 1 expression and activity appear to {{play a key role}} in the development of nitrate tolerance and might represent an intrinsic antioxidative mechanism of therapeutic interest. (Arterioscler Thromb Vasc Biol. 2007; 27 : 1729 - 1735.) Key Words: organic nitrates nitrate tolerance heme oxygenase- 1 reactive oxygen species When given acutely, organic nitrates such as nitroglyc-erin (glyceryl trinitrate, GTN) have potent antiische-mic effects. 1 Their clinical usefulness during long-term treat-ment, however, is limited because of the development of tolerance and cross-tolerance to endothelium-dependent and independent vasodilators. 2 The phenomenon of nitrate toler-ance was observed first in response to treatment with GTN, 3 but seems also to be shared by other organic nitrates such as isosorbide dinitrate (ISDN) 4 and mononitrate (ISMN), but interestingly not by pentaerithrityl tetranitrate (PETN). 5,...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the study}} was to {{determine}} whether the <b>pentaerythrityl</b> <b>tetranitrate</b> (PETN), a tolerance devoid exogenous NO donor could prevent morphological changes in the cardiovascular system evoked by long-term NO-synthase inhibition. Three groups of 10 -week-old Wistar rats were used: (1) controls, (2) treated by L-NG-nitroarginine methyl ester (L-NAME) in water (50 [*]mg[*]kg− 1), and (3) treated by L-NAME (50 [*]mg[*]kg− 1 in water) +PETN (2 × 50 [*]mg[*]kg− 1, using gavage). Blood pressure (BP) was measured by the tail plethysmographic method. After sacrificing the animals were perfused (120 [*]mmHg) by glutaraldehyde fixative and processed according to standard electron microscopy procedure. Wall thickness (WT), cross sectional area (CSA), inner diameter (ID) of thoracic aorta (TA), carotid (CA) and septal branch of the left descending coronary artery (RS) were measured in light microscopy. After 6 weeks, the BP was increased to 172 ± 1. 7 [*]mmHg (P< 0. 01) in the L-NAME group, compared to 127 ± 1. 4 [*]mmHg in controls. In L-NAME+PETN-treated rats, BP was 163 ± 0. 9 [*]mmHg (P< 0. 01), and significantly lower (P< 0. 01) in comparison to L-NAME-treated rats. Heart weight and heart/body weight ratio was not significantly changed. In L-NAME-treated rats, both WT and CSA were increased in all three arteries (P< 0. 01). ID was increased only in TA (P< 0. 01). Wall/diameter ratio (WD) was increased in TA (P< 0. 01) and CA (P< 0. 01). In L-NAME+PETN treated rats, WT was found to be increased only in TA (P< 0. 01). In comparison to the L-NAME treated group, WT was decreased in TA (P< 0. 01), in CA (P< 0. 01), in RS (P< 0. 05). CSA was increased only in TA (P< 0. 01), yet in comparison to the L-NAME group it was decreased in CA (P< 0. 01). ID was increased in comparison to both control and L-NAME treated rats only in TA (P< 0. 01). WD did not differ from the control value. In comparison to L-NAME-treated rats, it was decreased in both TA and CA (P< 0. 01). These data suggest that the changes in the cardiovascular system evoked by long-term NO-synthase inhibition were attenuated by simultaneous administration of the exogenous donor of nitric oxide–PETN...|$|E
