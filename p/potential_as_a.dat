5|$|Disquiet about Belgium's {{support for}} the secessionist states led to calls within the United Nations (UN) to remove all Belgian troops from the country. The Secretary General of the UN, Dag Hammarskjöld, {{believed}} that the crisis would provide the organisation {{with a chance to}} demonstrate its <b>potential</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> major peacekeeping force and encouraged the sending of a multinational contingent of peacekeepers to the Congo under UN command. On 14 July, the UN Security Council adopted Resolution 143, calling for total Belgian withdrawal from the Congo and their replacement with a UN-commanded force.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{cancellation}} of the Army's contract, the XR-1 was returned to the company, Platt-LePage believing that the design had <b>potential</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> civilian aircraft.

5|$|Venous thrombosis, the {{formation}} of a blood clot in a vein, is a common cause of death in breast cancer patients; patients with recurrent disease are typically maintained on anticoagulants for their lifetimes. A research study has suggested that extracts from P.impudicus can reduce the risk of this condition by reducing the incidence of platelet aggregation, and may have <b>potential</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> supportive preventative nutrition. It was used in medieval times as a cure for gout and as a love potion.|$|E

5|$|As {{opportunities}} for slow bowling became infrequent, he contemplated retirement. Although he dismissed Cyril Washbrook {{in the first}} over of Victoria's match against Wally Hammond's touring England team of 1946–47, he was skeptical about his pace bowling. After that match {{he did not take}} a wicket for the next two months. It took further encouragement from Australian captain Don Bradman after he played against Bradman's South Australians. Bradman told Johnston that the selectors thought highly of his <b>potential</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> medium-fast bowler to reinforce the short bursts of pace spearheads Ray Lindwall and Keith Miller and that pace bowlers were in short supply, whereas spinners were plentiful. In the same season, Colin McCool, Ian Johnson, Bruce Dooland and George Tribe had all played in Tests as specialist spinners. Johnston ended the season with only 12 wickets at 33.16 from six matches.|$|E
5|$|Born in Farnworth {{and raised}} in Bolton, he played amateur {{football}} at Rossendale United, before he turned professional at Burnley on his 17th birthday. He also played cricket for Burnley Cricket Club, before his <b>potential</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> footballer won him a £6,500 move to Everton in January 1937. He went on to finish as the First Division's top-scorer in 1937–38 and 1938–39, helping Everton to finish as champions of the Football League in the latter campaign. League football was then suspended for seven full seasons due to the outbreak of war in Europe, during which time he scored 24 goals in 23 appearances for England whilst guesting for Everton {{and a number of}} other clubs. In November 1945, he moved to Chelsea for £14,000, and scored a club record 26 goals in 34 league games in the 1946–47 season.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{his small}} frame, Brown {{recognized}} Horvath's <b>potential</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> senior in 1942 {{and made him}} a regular starter at halfback beside Paul Sarringhaus and fullback Gene Fekete. While Sarringhaus and Fekete were Ohio State's main offensive weapons, Horvath averaged eight yards per carry in a victory over Pittsburgh and scored two touchdowns and passed for 109 yards in a win over Illinois in Cleveland. Ohio State was ranked first {{in the country in}} the AP Poll early in the season, but fell in the rankings after a loss to Wisconsin in October. The team won the rest of its games, however, including a 21–7 victory over arch-rival Michigan {{at the end of the}} season. Horvath passed to Sarringhaus for a 35-yard touchdown and caught another 32-yard touchdown pass from Sarringhaus in the Michigan game. Ohio State's 9–1 record put it on top of the Big Ten standings and in the final AP Poll, giving the school its first-ever national championship.|$|E

5|$|In October 2008, the IMA {{announced}} a $2.6 million {{grant from the}} Lilly Endowment to be used toward {{the creation of a}} state-of-the-art conservation science lab. Through a grant from the Andrew W. Mellon Foundation, Dr. Gregory Dale Smith, was hired in October 2009 to lead the lab as its senior conservation scientist. A main focus of the lab is researching the IMA's collection, including couture fashion in the textile collection and objects made of synthetic materials in the design collection. Another focus is scientific research on materials found in the collections, such as resins and dyes on African art pieces and glazes on Asian ceramics. Through the addition of the lab, the IMA aims to establish itself as an internationally recognized conservation center and to increase its <b>potential</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> training and professional development resource in conservation science.|$|E
5|$|In September 2011, the Indian media {{reported}} that Mahesh Bhatt and Bhushan Kumar were keen {{to remake the}} 1990 musical blockbuster Aashiqui. Kumar approached Bhatt for a possible sequel, although it was Shagufta Rafique's melodramatic romantic script which persuaded him that the film had <b>potential</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sequel and decided {{to proceed with the}} project. Given Aashiqui 's status in Hindi cinematic history as one of the finest Indian musicals of all time, many expressed concerns towards the decision to remake the film, dubious that the producers could come up with a soundtrack on par with the quality of the 1990 film. Bhatt stated that they completely resisted the temptation to use the soundtrack of the earlier film, and promised that Aashiqui 2 would revive the era of melodious film music, as Aashiqui had done 22 years ago.|$|E
5|$|Kikuta {{was born}} in Aichi Prefecture, Japan. He first became {{interested}} in music {{at the age of}} ten after hearing songs by Emerson, Lake & Palmer. He began writing his own songs two years later, after listening to country blues music; it inspired him to study acoustic guitar and write his own songs in hope of one day becoming a singer/songwriter. He was also inspired as a child by music from movies. It was not until he got a synthesizer, however, that he began to feel his <b>potential</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> composer. Kikuta went on to earn an interdisciplinary degree in Religious Studies, Philosophy, and Cultural Anthropology from Kansai University, which he attended from 1981 to 1984. He never received any form of formal musical training, and instead taught himself by reading music theory books and listening {{to a wide variety of}} musical genres.|$|E

5|$|While ashore at Cape Adare, Borchgrevink {{collected}} further {{specimens of}} rocks and lichens, the latter of which would prove {{of great interest to}} the scientific community, which had doubted the ability of vegetation to survive so far south. He also made a careful study of the foreshore, assessing its <b>potential</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> site where a future expedition might land and establish winter quarters. When Antarctic reached Melbourne, Bull and Borchgrevink left the ship. Each hoped to raise funds for a further Antarctic expedition, but their efforts were unsuccessful. An animosity developed between them, possibly because of their differing accounts of the voyage on the Antarctic; each emphasised his own role without fully acknowledging that of the other.|$|E
5|$|Mycologist Dennis McCabe {{studied the}} {{development}} of the fruit body using specimens grown in pure culture. Starting out as a hyphal tuft, the fungus grows into a cup shape before eventually closing in completely to create the spherical structure of the mature fruit body. When the fungus is in the cup stage, the exposed hymenium is immature; typically, spores develop after the fruit body is fully closed. In some cases, the fruit body stops developing at the cup stage while the hymenium continues to mature. This results in a cup-shaped fungus with an exposed layer of basidia bearing normal and mature spores. Limnoperdon incarnatum is a structurally simple fungus, and relatively easy to grow in culture, suggesting it may have <b>potential</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> model organism for fruit body development in general. Under the experimental conditions used, fruit bodies matured to produce spores about 72 hours after the fungus started growing. The aborted cups resemble the sporocarps of the cyphelloid fungi, but can be distinguished by their orthotrophic spore attachment and the lack of ballistospory (forceful spore discharge). McCabe and Escobar later suggested that the fungus may have evolved the loss of ballistospory by being compensated with the cup-shaped fruit body closing at maturity. Halocyphina villosa is another small cup-shaped Basidiomycete fungus that has adapted to a marine environment; in contrast to L.incarnatum, however, it starts out with a closed fruit body that later opens up to become cup-shaped.|$|E
5|$|Polish {{studies found}} that {{although}} the mushroom bioaccumulates mercury and cobalt from the soil, occasional consumption of mushrooms should not cause maximum allowable intake doses to be exceeded. Similar conclusions about safety were made in a Polish study of the mushroom's ability to accumulate organochlorine compounds. Different methods of preparation for consumption affect the leaching rate of cadmium, lead, and mercury. After the 1986 Chernobyl disaster, several studies showed I.badia bioaccumulates radioactive caesium, 137Cs. 137Cs is produced in nuclear power plants following the chain decay of 235U to 137Te, and has a half-life of thirty years. A German study showed that mushrooms collected from 1986 to 1988 had radiocaesium contents that were 8.3 to 13.6 times greater than mushrooms collected before the accident in 1985. This caesium-sequestering effect {{is caused by a}} brown pigment, the polyphenol compound norbadione A, which is related to a family of mushroom pigments known as pulvinic acids. Norbadione A has been investigated for its ability to provide a protective effect against the damaging effects of ionizing radiation. Tests with cell cultures and mice show that although it has some protective effect, it is toxic to cells in higher doses. A new series of alkali chelators based on the structure of norbadione A has been reported. The mushroom may have <b>potential</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> bioremediation agent to clean up contaminated sites.|$|E
