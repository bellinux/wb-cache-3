25|$|Asbestos {{was used}} {{throughout}} International Paper’s Corinth manufacturing plant. These companies never warned the International Paper workers that their asbestos products were dangerous, even though asbestos {{was known to}} causes illnesses {{as far back as}} the 1920s.

25|$|While the <b>paper</b> has <b>been</b> commercialized in San Pablito, it has {{not lost}} its ritual {{character}} here or in other areas such as Texcatepec and Chicontepec, where it is still made for ritual purposes. In these communities, the making and ritual use of <b>paper</b> <b>is</b> similar. Figures are cut from light or dark paper, which each figure and each color having significance. There {{are two types of}} paper. Light or white <b>paper</b> <b>is</b> used for images of gods or humans. Dark <b>paper</b> <b>is</b> connected with evil characters or sorcery.

25|$|The {{arrangements}} {{inside the}} outhouse vary by culture. In Western societies, many, though not all, {{have at least}} one seat with a hole in it, above a small pit. Others, often in more rural, older areas in European countries, simply have a hole with two indents on either side for your feet. In Eastern societies, there is a hole in the floor, over which the user crouches. A roll of toilet paper is usually available. Old corn cobs, leaves, or other types of <b>paper</b> <b>are</b> also used.|$|E
25|$|Thus a bond {{is a form}} of loan or IOU: {{the holder}} of the bond is the lender (creditor), the issuer of the bond is the {{borrower}} (debtor), and the coupon is the interest. Bonds provide the borrower with external funds to finance long-term investments, or, in the case of government bonds, to finance current expenditure. Certificates of deposit (CDs) or short-term commercial <b>paper</b> <b>are</b> considered to be money market instruments and not bonds: the main difference is in the length of the term of the instrument.|$|E

25|$|As {{in other}} parts of Mexico, the {{manufacture}} of this paper was originally for ceremonial use, and restricted to shamans. For this reason, the paper is also locally known as “papel de brujos” (witches’ paper). Manufacture of the paper is no longer restricted to shamans because of commercialization, but ritualistic use of it in San Pablito and other Otomi communities continues and is still in the purview of the shamans. Particularly large ficus trees used for <b>paper</b> <b>are</b> marked as sacred with candles and cutouts.|$|E

Caleb has a vision of one of the strangers in his bedroom. He looks through the window and sees the forest outside his room ablaze, with animals running from the fire.|$|E
25|$|Woodblock {{printing}} (diaoban yinshua 雕版印刷), {{known as}} xylography today, {{was the first}} method of printing applied to a paper medium. It became widely used throughout East Asia both as a method for printing on textiles and later, {{under the influence of}} Buddhism, on paper. As a method of printing on cloth, the earliest surviving examples from China date to about 220. Ukiyo-e is the best known type of Japanese woodblock art print. Most European uses of the technique on <b>paper</b> <b>are</b> covered by the term woodcut (see below), except for the block-books produced mainly in the fifteenth century.|$|E

25|$|The costume {{collection}} {{is the most}} comprehensive in Britain, containing over 14,000 outfits plus accessories, mainly dating from 1600 to the present. Costume sketches, design notebooks, and other works on <b>paper</b> <b>are</b> typically held by the Word and Image department. Because everyday clothing from previous eras has not generally survived, the {{collection is}} dominated by fashionable clothes made for special occasions. One of the first significant gifts of costume came in 1913 when the V received the Talbot Hughes collection containing 1,442 costumes and items as a gift from Harrods following its display at the nearby department store.|$|E
25|$|The results {{presented}} in the bad apple attack research <b>paper</b> <b>are</b> based on an attack in the wild launched against the Tor network by {{the authors of the}} study. The attack targeted six exit nodes, lasted for 23 days, and revealed a total of 10,000 IP addresses of active Tor users. This study is particularly significant because it is the first documented attack designed to target P2P file-sharing applications on Tor. BitTorrent may generate as much as 40% of all traffic on Tor. Furthermore, the bad apple attack is effective against insecure use of any application over Tor, not just BitTorrent.|$|E

One layer of tsatsas {{is placed in the}} treasury, and the empty space between them is filled with dry sand. On the thus created new surface, another layer of tsatsas is made, and so on until the entire space of the treasury is full.|$|E
