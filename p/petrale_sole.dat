40|$|The {{objective}} of the thesis is to present data upon which {{the management of the}} Oregon otter-trawl fishery can be based. In addition, a history of the Oregon trawl fishery is presented. A summary of gear development by many of the vessels in the Oregon fleet is presented in table form. The principal species studied are the English sole (Paraphrys vetulus), <b>petrale</b> <b>sole</b> (Eopsetta jordani), and Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus). For these three species the time of spawning, length at maturity, and relation of length to weight are determined. In addition, the number of eggs produced by English and Dover sole at various sizes is calculated. In 1948 and 1949 a total of 5, 643 bottom fish were tagged from otter trawlers operating from Astoria. Almost all of these fish were English, petrale, and Dover sole, and all but a few were released in the area between Willapa bay and 2 Tillamook Head. Returns from the tagging give no indication of significant migrations north and south along the coast, but a small amount of exploratory winter fishing resulted in recovery of tagged :Dover sole in waters deeper than 200 fathoms. These Dover sole had been tagged during the summer in much shallower water. The growth of sole of the three species studied is computed from the tag returns. General comparisons of rates of tag return are made with other tagging experiments of a similar nature along the Pacific Coast. Otoliths of English, petrale, and Dover sole are used to calculate growth rates and compute age-frequency curves. It is concluded that otoliths are not completely satisfactory for determining the age of these species. An analysis of the condition of the stocks of English sole, <b>petrale</b> <b>sole,</b> Dover sole, and rockfish is made using the landing records for the period 1942 - 47, inclusive. The English sole were not completely exploited in 1947. During this period, the <b>petrale</b> <b>sole</b> declined in abundance at least 50 per cent. The Dover sole declined some in abundance, and the condition of the rockfish stocks is obscured because of the several species that enter this category. English, petrale, and Dover sole were measured at the time commercial landings were made and these data are analyzed for the years 1948 - 51, inclusive. In 1950 the catches of Ore,:,on otter trawlers at sea were sampled to get a measure of the amount of discard of both scrap fish and undersized English, petrale, and Dover sole. Approximately 17 per cent of the Dover sole, 33 per cent of the <b>petrale</b> <b>sole,</b> and 27 per cent of the English sole were discarded at sea because they were too small. Approximately one-half of the total catch at sea by weight was discarded. An analysis is made of the relationship of the mink-raising industry to the otter-trawl fishery. The species composition of the milk food is determined from market samples.

Comparison of depths of maximal values of catch per unit effort, effort, and total English sole landings for each month {{was used to determine}} when effort in this mixed-species fishery was directed on English sole. <b>Petrale</b> <b>sole,</b> normally a deeper water species, move inshore during late spring and summer months and may be a primary target during this season. Dover sole appeared to be a target species during certain spring months but rarely overshadowed either English or <b>petrale</b> <b>sole</b> catches. External factors such as weather conditions and market variability affected total monthly effort levels and were included in an interpretation of seasonal abundance and migration trends of English sole. Longshore movements were largely obscured by the month-to-month fluctuations of effort from Newport and Coos Bay, the two major fishing ports within the defined landing area. The Newport fleet is somewhat larger, but variable weather conditions may result in greater {{effort on the part of}} the Coos Bay fleet during certain months. Seasonal inshore-off shore movements of English sole, however, were consistently evident for the three years. Average depths of capture and catch per effort increased during fall and early winter months suggesting movement into deep water. Examination of ovary condition of English sole caught in the vicinity of Heceta and Stonewall Banks off the central Oregon coast linked this concentration and offshore movement to spawning.

The published article is copyrighted by John Wiley & Sons Ltd. and can be found at: [URL] ocean-climate models driven by increased greenhouse gases and higher temperatures predict a decline in oceanic dissolved oxygen (DO) as a result of greater stratification, reduced ventilation below the thermocline, and decreased solubility at higher temperatures. Since spreading of low oxygen waters is underway and predicted to increase, understanding impacts on higher trophic levels is essential. Within the California Current System, shoaling of the oxygen minimum zone (OMZ) is expected to produce complex changes. Onshore movement of the OMZ could lead to habitat compression for species with higher oxygen requirements while allowing expansion of species tolerant of low bottom DO. As part of annual groundfish surveys, we sampled catch across a range of conditions from the upper to the lower limit of the OMZ and shoreward across the continental shelf of the US west coast. DO ranged from 0. 02 to 4. 25 mL L⁻¹ with 642 stations (of 1020 sampled) experiencing hypoxic conditions in 2008 – 2010. Catch and species richness exhibited significant and positive relationships with near-bottom oxygen concentration.

40|$|Reprinted from Fishery bulletin, Vol. 75 (1), pages 173 - 183. Dover and {{rex sole}} larvae attain an {{exceptionally}} large size {{and have a}} long pelagic life. Dover sole larvae (9 - 65 mm standard length) were collected in mid-water trawls and plankton nets during all months of the year. Judging from growth of larvae and occurrence in bottom trawls of recently metamorphosed juveniles, Dover sole are pelagic during {{their first year of}} life. Large larvae (50 - 65 mm standard length) are probably pelagic for over a year and few apparently are recruited to benthic populations. Dover sole larvae were most common in oceanic waters beyond the continental slope and in the upper 50 m of the water column. The rex sole larvae captured were 5 - 89 mm long. Average size and stage of development of larvae increased from March through February, and juveniles were common on the bottom during winter on the outer shelf. Thus the pelagic phase usually lasts about a year. Both rex and Dover sole may utilize the outer continental shelf-upper slope region for a nursery during early benthic life. <b>Petrale</b> <b>sole</b> larvae (10 - 22 mm standard length) were rare.

40|$|Graduation date: 1992 The {{effects of}} {{potential}} parental egg production {{and environmental factors}} on year-class strength (YCS) of <b>petrale</b> <b>sole</b> (Eopsetta jordani) were investigated in two areas off Oregon and Washington (Pacific States Marine Fisheries Commission areas 2 B: 42 ° 50 'N - 44 ° 18 'N, and 3 A: 45 ° 46 'N - 47 ° 20 'N). Indices of YCS based on Summed-CPUE (summed catch rates of females for ages 6 + 7) and cohort analysis (numbers of females attaining age- 6) tended to be significantly correlated within and between areas 2 B and 3 A (r ≥ 0. 45, P ≤ 0. 06). Since cohort analyses were deemed more reliable YCS indices than Summed-CPUE indices, only cohort analyses {{were used to determine}} the role of potential parental egg production and environmental factors on YCS variations. Large YCS fluctuations were evident from 1958 to 1977. Year-classes born from 1962 to 1965 and from 1973 to 1977 were intermediate to weak cohorts in areas 2 B and 3 A. In both areas, estimates of commercial catch rates suggested a substantial decline of abundance from the middle 1970 's to the middle 1980 's. The fact that the large decrease of YCS for cohorts born from 1973 to 1977 was not preceded by a decline in commercial catch rates, and that spawner-recruit relations were not detected, suggested that density-independent factors were more important than parental-stock size during the initial decrease of YCS in the 1970 's and the subsequent decline of catch rates in the late 1970 's. For cohorts born from 1958 to 1977, a regression model based on indices of offshore Ekman transport from January to March, and alongshore transport from December to February accounted for nearly 55...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2017 - 08 Understanding {{drivers of}} populations is of {{tantamount}} importance {{across a broad}} scale of researchers, from theoretical ecologists to tactical resource managers. Drivers may be internal feedbacks (density-dependent) or external (density-independent) processes, such as changes in prey, predator, or competitor populations, or environmental stochasticity. In a closed population, these drivers affect populations by altering demographic rates (i. e. mortality, reproduction, somatic growth). Although there is increasing evidence that no demographic rates are static, at least in patchy and stochastic aquatic environments, it is an ongoing question to identify the most important types and scale of variation for population dynamics models. In this dissertation, I seek to quantify the magnitude and effect of growth and size-at-age variation on fish population dynamics {{using a variety of}} different modeling techniques. In the first chapter, I use a state-space statistical model to quantify the magnitude and type of temporal size-at-age variation experienced by a number of Pacific groundfish populations. In the second chapter, I use these estimates of growth variation, along with parameters taken from fisheries stock assessment models, to illustrate how both growth and recruitment variation may introduce fluctuations into simulated populations with otherwise static demographic rates. In the third chapter, I use an integrated analysis model to simulate and estimate patterns of growth variation in <b>Petrale</b> <b>sole</b> (Eopsetta jordani) to examine the effect of growth misspecification on estimates of population status. In the final chapter, I adapt a size-structured ecosystem model to Tonlé Sap Lake, Cambodia, and explore ways to validate model accuracy in a species-rich, data-poor ecosystem.

40|$|Graduation date: 2003 Marine {{fish are}} subject to direct and {{indirect}} oceanographic variations operating at short and long time scales. In this study feeding habits and long-term growth condition of several groundfish species of the Pacific Northwest are examined to {{understand the relationship between}} variations in the fish's biological and life history components and the ocean environment. Stomach samples of three rockfish species, yellowtail rockfish (Sebastes flavidus), widow rockfish (S. entomelas), and canary rockfish (S. pinniger), which were collected seasonally off the Pacific Northwest in 1998 and 1999, provided quantitative information on the food habits of the species during and directly after the 1997 - 98 El Nino event. The diets of these co-occurring species were markedly different from each other. Unusual southern zooplankton species were found in the diets of all three species possibly due to the influence of the El Niflo event. The diet of S. flavidus in 1998 summer (El Nino) was contrasted with results from a previous study based on 1980 summer samples (non-El Nino), and found to be different. An assessment of long-term changes in fish growth condition was conducted using data from Oregon market samples, in which the fish weights are generally measured for aggregations of fish rather than individuals. Non-linear regression can be applied to this type of data to estimate the length-weight parameters and to detect long-term changes in growth condition. The reliability of the estimation method was tested using Monte Carlo simulation. The results demonstrate that the estimation method provides reasonably accurate estimates and is sufficiently powerful to detect small changes in the length-weight relationship. Using Oregon market sample data collected over several decades and the non-linear regression method, growth condition indices were developed and examined for five fish species: Dover sole (Microstomus pacificus), <b>petrale</b> <b>sole</b> (Eopsetta jordani), canary rockfish, yellowtail rockfish, and widow rockfish. No particular trend or close association with environmental variables was evident in the long-term growth condition indices for any of the species, but interannual and seasonal variations in condition were clearly evident. Possible reasons for the lack of long-term trends in condition and the lack of any close association with the environmental variables are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{rockfishes}} and scorpionfishes (family Scorpaenidae) {{form one}} of the most important fish families in the ocean waters of California. At present, in California waters, this family is represented by 49 species in the genus Sebastodes, two in the genus Sebastolobus, and one in the genus Scorpaena. Not only does this family contain more species than any other marine or freshwater fish family known to inhabit our waters, but most of the species are highly desirable for food. Only a few are too small to be of direct value for human consumption. Even these, however, are utilized as food by other fishes, often by larger species of rockfishes. The pygmy rockfish for example, which barely reaches a size of eight inches, has been taken only from the stomachs of other rockfish. Various rockfishes were of commercial importance in California as early as 1875 and, as a group, the rockfish have continually increased in importance not only in California but along the Pacific Coast, as well. The California catch, which in 1900 totaled between one and two million pounds, has in recent years risen to an average of between 12 and 13 million pounds annually. The importance of rockfish for human consumption during World War II is reflected in the peak Pacific Coast catch of 60 million pounds in 1945. For many years the majority of the catch was marketed fresh in the form of fillets. At present, only a small amount of the rockfish catch is marketed in a fresh dressed form, particularly in Southern California, but a sizable proportion is processed as frozen fillets. Preliminary tests on the frozen storage life of the fillets of a few important species indicate definite differences in keeping qualities. In this regard, it is hoped that this publication will be of particular value to both the fisherman and the processor in the proper identification of the numerous rockfish species. In the filleting process of rockfish, there is a loss of about two-thirds from the round weight. The carcasses that remain after filleting are either reduced to meal for livestock feeds or are mixed with scrap fish some of which consists of small unmarketable species of rockfish. This mixture is ground and frozen for use as mink food or as a supplement in the diet of hatchery-raised trout. During the past decade, sport fishing in the ocean waters of California has become increasingly important as a source of recreation for our growing population, and rockfish are now {{one of the}} most important components of the sport catch. Party boat records for all of California reveal that rockfish comprised 9 percent of the two and one-half million fish caught by anglers in 1947. By 1955, 55 percent of the three million fish caught by sport anglers consisted of rockfish. The adult forms of some rockfish are found only in relatively shallow water, often close to shore, but others are found only in deeper water and the adults of a few may occur in offshore water as deep as 3, 000 feet. Surveys being conducted by the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigation show that the larvae of various species of rockfish occur in great abundance and are widely distributed along the coast, in some cases appearing as far as 300 miles offshore. They are abundant during most of the months of the year. Thus, during their pelagic existence and later as young and immature forms seeking an ultimate bottom habitat, these species are of considerable importance as food for pelagic, mid-water, and bottom living fishes. The young of various rockfish sometimes form a large and important part of the diet of such highly prized species as king salmon, albacore, and <b>petrale</b> <b>sole.</b> Most of the Pacific Coast scorpaenids were described prior to 1900 by a number of different workers. These men often based their descriptions on a single specimen, and occasionally a freak or variant would be described as new. Others of these early descriptions are inadequate for satisfactory identification of the fish at hand. As a result, the identity of a number of species of rockfish has been in doubt for many years. A number of recent workers have unraveled some of the nomenclatorial problems and reduced several species to synonymy, however, until now no major attempt has been made to redescribe the different species in the light of current knowledge. The present work presents uniform, concise descriptions of all the species comprising the family Scorpaenidae in California waters. Keys and photographs of all these species are presented to facilitate identification. Proper identification of the 52 kinds of rockfish, inhabiting our waters, will not only aid the industry by providing means of maintaining a uniformity in its products, but is logically the first step in helping to speed future research studies on this increasingly important group of fishes...|$|E
