40|$|This study explores {{variegated}} means {{through which}} ports {{have become increasingly}} entangled in the planning logic of neoliberal innovation-driven economy. The research topic belongs to the academic disciplines of economics and human geography. The aim of the thesis is to analyse how the notion of innovation, adopted {{in a variety of}} supranational and national port policy documents, is deployed in operational port environment in two different ports of the Baltic Sea Region: the port of Stockholm, Sweden, and the port of Klaipeda, Lithuania. This novel innovation agenda is visible in several topics I examine in the study, that is, port governance, environmental issues, and seaport – port-city interface. The gathered primary source material on port policy documents, strategies, development planning documents and reports is analysed by utilizing the qualitative content analysis research method. Moreover, the empirical part of the case study, that is, tracing innovation practices in mundane port activities is based on collected qualitative semi-structured interviews with port authorities in Klaipeda and Stockholm, researchers and other <b>port</b> <b>experts.</b> I examine the interview material by employing the theoretical reading research method. In my analysis, I have reframed port-related policy development by tracing and identifying the port transformation from “functional terminals” to “engines for growth”. My results show that this novel innovation-oriented rhetoric imprinted in the narrative “engines for growth” is often contested in daily port practices. In other words, my analysis reveals that the port authorities’ and other port actors’ attitudes towards innovations do not necessarily correspond to the new narrative of innovation and do not always “fit” within a framework of neoliberal economic thinking that glorifies the “culture of innovations”. I argue that the ability to develop innovative initiatives in the ports of Klaipeda and Stockholm is strongly predetermined by local conditions, a port’s governance model, the way port actors perceive the importance of innovations per se, demand factors and new regulations...|$|R

40|$|Building upon a {{formerly}} performed {{study on}} port competitiveness, {{this article discusses}} {{the use of a}} stochastic frontier model as an interesting novel use to test, identify and correct respondents’ bias by applying it to competitiveness analysis based on perceptions of senior executives. Measuring the importance of competition determinants of seaports, conventionally analyzed using a SWOT-analysis based on (transport) infrastructure as a prime requirement for port activity growth, is an important issue to port management. However, it seems that the “institutional” environment of a seaport is also critical in obtaining a competitive advantage. In Haezendonck et al. (2000 and 2001) those port specific advantages and disadvantages were identified using factor analysis and L 1 -regression on the perceptions of 75 respondents, all senior executives and experts, through a survey. As regards the results of this study, critiques were formulated on the use of perceptions, often biased due to the political lobbying potential of the results. Since respondents often see independent studies as an opportunity to obtain more or early government subsidies, attract new investment projects or at least highlight the attention on their specific problems and demands, they were prone to underestimating the positive impact of the key success factors of the studied seaport compared to its main rivals, in this case major seaports in the so-called Hamburg–Le Havre competitive range. The {{purpose of this article is}} to test the assumption that respondents significantly underestimate the positive impact of port specific advantages and to see which of the respondent subgroups within the 75 respondents sample are more responsible than others for this underestimation. In addition, we argue and demonstrate that the use of a stochastic frontier method is appropriate for this matter. Each of 25 considered competition determinants of the original study is decomposed into a noise and “efficiency” term, based on the Bayesian stochastic frontier model (BSFM). In this article, we find evidence that BSFM could be used to test the “lobby-effect” or underestimation of the real effect of determinants, that terminal operators as a subgroup of respondents, are more likely to underestimate the key success factors than the subgroup of <b>port</b> <b>experts</b> and that those determinants that are directly related to government action show more underestimation than competitiveness determinants that result from private investments...|$|R
40|$|As a {{consequence}} of globalisation, port performance has become increasingly important for international trade. Different port regions perform differently. The aim {{of this research is}} to identify factors that determine port performance and choice in a comparative study between two case ports in Europe and Asia. Specifically, this research aims to examine factor differences between two European and Asian ports' contexts; to identify the key factors that drive port performance and choice; to investigate the differences in importance and performance among the factors; to analyse how the importance and performance of factors varies for different ports; to analyse the role a port hinterland plays in port performance and choice; and to illustrate the usefulness of key findings for port stakeholders. The construct of importance factors is based on the literature. The research methodology was that of mixed methods to collect both qualitative and quantitative data in two port regions (China and UK) and was carried out in two phases. Phase one comprised semi-structured in-depth interviews. Phase two consisted of questionnaire-based surveys to validate the factors influencing port performance. The questionnaire surveys were distributed to <b>port</b> <b>experts</b> from 500 organisations and had a 50. 8 % response rate. Thematic analysis was used for qualitative data analysis of the data from the interviews. Methods for analysis of the data from the questionnaires included descriptive analysis, factor analysis, t-test, Kruskal-Wallis H test, importance-performance analysis and other statistical validation and significance tests. The findings of this research suggest that ports wishing to outperform competitors can do so by improving the factors that are of high importance but currently perform poorly. This could also be achieved by improving performances on shipping services, shipping prices, overall logistics cost, logistics services and government support in descending order which is based on factor evaluation in this research. The thesis further analyses this result within the context of urgent, salient and basic factors based on IPA, including explicit & implicit importance. Shipping services and cost have a critical effect on port performance. Differences in port charges are the most significant differences in factor importance at the case ports of the Humber and Xiamen. Government support has the most significant differences in factor performance between the two case ports. This research is not without limitations. The analysis was restricted to two port regions in China and the UK and data used in this research were mainly generated from interviews and questionnaire surveys, responses to which are to some extent subjective.

However, these activities have rarely been considered to date. This project consists of three parts. Firstly a review of service marketing approaches, their status and development, the nature of marketing strategies and the marketing mix had to be provided. Also the development of marketing in seaports had to be examined. The focal elements discussed were {{the elements of the}} services provided by seaports, and competition between them in the context of Poland Secondly the situation in Eastern Europe and Poland under the communist rule and during the transition had to be provided. This part examined East European economic development, focusing down upon Poland and the consequenceso f the changesi n recent years particularly for the maritime sector and its structure and ownership. Thirdly, an analysis of marketing strategies in the main international ports of Poland were developed, with particular reference to their potential users' point of view, in the context of recent economic and market changes. A conceptual model had been developed to analyse these changing strategies that resulted in a derivation of a multivariate approach (cluster, factor or conjoint analysis) to accommodate the large number and diversity of variables that are required. A structured interview approach, plus mail survey techniques were used to collect the data in direct interviews with the Polish port authorities and the operating companies. More questionnaires were distributed amongst the most important maritime companies. Problems of language, customs and accessibility to individuals and data were overcome, as the researcher is a native Pole wi * th good English and Russian skills and close contacts with <b>port</b> <b>experts</b> at the University of Gdansk. Finally analysis from the data obtained from both personal interviews and mail surveys resulted in the identification of the main,, underlying constructs of. the marketing strategies in the ports of Gdansk and Gdynia as,. 'p erceived by their users. Application of factor analysis indicated the existence of six main factors in"each of the ports. The results were valid and reliable and also supported on a-theoretical basis from the service marketing and port marketing literature. A discussion of the results provides implications for practitioners. The research shows that some of the elements of the marketing mix are less developed than others as seen by customers. It can help marketing managers to alter their strategies and better satisfy customers' desires. Furthermore, implications for theory development, research methodology and scope for future research in transition countries and port industries are discussed. University of Plymout...|$|R
40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) This thesis {{examines}} {{the phenomenon of}} agitation {{for the establishment of}} deepsea port outlets in non-metropolitan New South Wales during the century after 1860. Aspirations for such development persisted throughout the entire period throughout the entire period although, for a number of reasons, they seem to have been more intense and the goals were pursued more vigorously at certain times when events favoured the revival of the idea. Although often espouses actively by inland townsmen, the belief that great progress and prosperity would follows the construction of harbour works or cross-country railway lines from the coast to the interior was centred mainly on the coastal port towns. The struggle for possession of the potential hinterlands by the potential deepsea ports was fought on several fronts, chief among which was the political front where individuals, town organisations and regional pressure groups sought to gain Parliamentary sanction for their own particular port and railway schemes. It was an unequal and frustrating contest for the agitators, however, because the central place which Sydney held in the trade of the Colony already in 1860 continued to grow in importance as the city population multiplied until, by 1890, Sydney's dominance over the outports was ll but complete. After about 1890, the struggle for new deepsea port development became increasingly the struggle of vision against a reality in which almost all of New South Wales had become the hinterland of Port Jackson through the instrumentality of the railways which radiated from Sydney and of the coastal shipping fleets which centred their operations on Sydney. Townsmen continued to agitate for decisive Government intervention for the implementation of a policy of transport decentralisation but action never came, through promised on many occasions. Although there were some victories for Newcastle, almost the only decentralisation of export trade which developed occurred where specialised cargoes such as coal or steel products were involved. This thesis identifies and examines a number of key elements in the story. One was the towns themselves whose dreams of aggrandisement, often mutually exclusive, by raising parochial jealousies hindered the implementation of effective strategies for co-ordinating action. Another was the part played by the coastal shipping fleets both in centralising trade on Sydney and also in discouraging intrusion by interstate shipowners interested in establishing themselves in the trade of the outports distant from Sydney. A third was the role of the Public Works engineers and <b>port</b> <b>experts</b> in influencing the direction which development might possibly take through their understanding of the problems associated with port construction. Yet another element in the story was the reality of political life where the matter of decentralisation of transport facilities remained contentious and therefore, in practice, politically untouchable. The thesis seeks to explain why the idea of deepsea port development has persisted for so long outside the metropolitan area and why, in spite of a century's agitation, the results are so meagre. In the process of addressing itself to such questions the thesis also provides some understanding of the society which has developed in the towns along the New South Wales coast and of the relationships which have evolved between central government and the regions...|$|R

The marine resources of peninsular Malaysia have been adequately explored in last few decades whereas East Malaysian marine fisheries resources are still potential to be explored.

The contribution of marine captured fisheries was up to 89. 8 % of the total fish production with a value of RM 3. 81 billion in 1998 (Annual Fisheries Statistics, 1998). The Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) of Malaysia in the South China Sea is approximately 198, 173 km 2 (Earth trend, 2004). Mainly the bulk of the unexploited resources come from offshore demersal fish, small pelagic fish, coastal tuna and oceanic tuna. Trash and low value fishes are usually dumped into the sea considering it has no market value. These unwanted fishes are potential as raw material for making fishmeal that could generate good profit.

40|$|This {{thesis is}} the result of a {{graduation}} project, conducted at the financial consultancy firm Maritime Transport and Business Solutions, to fulfill the Master of Science program Management of Technology at the faculty of Technology, Policy and Management at Delft University of Technology. This thesis comes forth out the increasing awareness of the port industry on sustainability and the continuous growth of container transport. Dutch ports are more and more constrained by their physical and environmental boundaries. To reduce the environmental and physical constraints of ports, this research aims to examine whether it is possible to stimulate container terminal operators to enhance their environmental performance. Environment is one of the three elements to enhance sustainability. In order to enhance sustainability it is important to increase the environmental performance without compromising the economic and social factors. A port authority has two revenue streams which both can be used to pressure concessionaires and visiting modalities. This thesis focuses on the incorporation of environmental criteria in the concession agreement and thereby the feasibility to exert pressure on the private sector to increase sustainability. This is combined in the following research question, “How can environmental criteria be incorporated in the awarding procedure for port concessions in order to enhance sustainability of container terminal operations?" In order to do so three building blocks are determined that will provide the information. These three building blocks are, - Concession awarding process, - Evaluation methods for port concessions, - Environmental themes. Container terminal concessions are increasingly awarded via a competitive process. This competitive process can consist of private bilateral negotiation or container terminal concessions can be awarded through an open call for tender. In the awarding process environmental criteria are underexposed but already present in the form of existing legislation and permits. The use of environmental awarding criteria is virtually absent in ports with the exception of Maasvlakte 2. For Maasvlakte 2 concessions an environmental management system and modal split criteria have been used as environmental awarding criteria. The developed evaluation method for port tenders does not differ from other investment projects. The Net Present Value technique is used to determine the added value of the container terminal investment for the port authority. The net present value technique is incorporated in the business case which is an analysis of to determine whether an investment for the port authority is worthwhile. The weighed sum is an evaluation model is the most widely applied evaluation model for tenders. The European Commission implicitly refers to use the weighted sum as evaluation model to evaluate the outcome of a tender process. The establishment of weighting is ultimately determined by political decisions. The net present value technique provides insight on the costs or benefits on the incorporation of environmental criteria and is used as input to apply the weighted sum technique. The combination to determine the value of a project with the net present value technique and further develop an evaluation method with the method of the weighted sum provides an evaluation method to combine the best of both worlds. Environmental themes that are important for consideration in the awarding process of container terminals are: - Air quality, - Energy consumption, - Intensification in use of space, - Water quality management, - Noise, - Light - Preservation and development of nature. These themes have come forth out of desk research and the conducted expert interviews. The themes are reviewed by experts in interviews to judge the feasibility of the themes for the construction of awarding criteria. For the <b>port</b> authorities, an <b>expert</b> from the <b>Port</b> of Rotterdam, two <b>experts</b> from the <b>Port</b> of Amsterdam and one expert of Zeeland Seaports are interviewed. To represent the terminal operators one expert of APM Terminals and one expert of Europe Container Terminals (United States Environmental Protection Agency) have been interviewed. Representing the government, three experts of the Ministry of Transport, Public Works and Water Management were interviewed. In order maintain coherence with economic and social parts of sustainability for both these aspects of sustainability an indicator is introduced. For the economic part this indicator is profitability and for social part this indicator is employment. The combination of environmental, social and economical themes represents the sustainability framework. The interviewed experts have acknowledged that incorporation of environmental awarding criteria will stimulate environmental innovation and considering the environment is an increasing dominant factor to maintain their license-to-operate. This license-to-operate is under continuous pressure due to the general trend in society to enhance sustainability. In order to cope with the general trend in society the experts have indicated that intensification in use of space is the most important theme to enhance sustainability. Dutch ports and society are constraint by the physical constraints of the country. To be able to expand the ports’ transshipment without physical expansion benefits the port authorities and society in general. Society in general benefits due to the reason that space can therefore be utilized for other purposes, as housing or recreation for instance. Therefore an indicator for this theme is developed which is based on terminal efficiency and is calculated by the annual throughput per square meter. The second stage of this research has reviewed the feasibility to incorporate intensification of space in the awarding process. To be able to provide sensible comment on this topic, two cases were abstracted from real terminals. The straddle carrier terminal and the change needed in a rail mounted gantry crane terminal. On basis of their differences the needed change to increase sustainability in port operation is mapped. The analysis of the reference terminals was divided in a financial review, an environmental analysis and the application of the evaluation methodology. The reference terminals have revealed that in Hong Kong intensification of space is possible on basis of current practices. The reference cases served as input for the financial review. A business case served as financial review. The business case has revealed that intensification of space is financially feasible. The financial analysis has indicated the trade-off between the economic indicator, profitability and the environmental indicator, space. Based on this business case the performance measures and scoring functions for the weighted sum are constructed. Both reference container terminals are subjected to an environmental analysis based on the sustainable framework of environmental, social and economical themes. This analysis has indicated that the rail mounted gantry crane terminal will have similar of better environmental and social performance than the straddle carrier option. However, due to the higher investments needed to realize the rail mounted gantry crane terminal the profitability of this terminal is lower. To assess whether incorporation in use of space will actually enhance the sustainable performance of container terminals an expert meeting has been held. The <b>port</b> <b>experts</b> of MTBS have revealed that the total sustainability can be determined when all of the above mentioned themes are quantified. Therefore, at this stadium no conclusion can be provided whether the sustainability of container terminals is enhanced with the incorporation of space. However the The general conclusion of this research is that it is possible to enhance the environmental performance of the port by integrating environmental criteria the concession agreement. Based on reference cases the financial, technical and environmental feasibility of the environmental criteria can be determined. The input following from the business case can be used as input for the evaluation model. The application of the weighted sum technique will determine the performance measures and scoring functions of the environmental criterion. When incorporating environmental criteria in the awarding procedure it is important to consider that the environmental criteria are measureable and are attributable to the party responsible. The incorporation of environmental criteria will lead to additional costs without generating additional revenues for port authority and terminal operator. However, from the expert interviews follows that incorporation of environmental criteria is necessary to respond to the general trend in society where environment is becoming an increasingly important topic to maintain their license-to-operate. This implies that environmental criteria have great potential to be incorporated in the near future.

40|$|Global {{economic}} development has significantly increased {{the demand for}} container liner shipping {{which has led to}} its global restructuring. Under such a situation, hub-and-spoke liner shipping systems have become increasingly popular which cause more intense competition between major ports and thus transhipment traffic is perceived to play a more important role in deciding the competitive positions of ports. Although there was no shortage of studies investigating port competitiveness in the past decades, most of them had overlooked the necessity of theorising port competition while ignoring the importance of including less-readily quantifiable factors in the port competitiveness assessment process. Thus, a research gap clearly exists and through investigating the competitiveness of Antwerp, Bremerhaven, Felixstowe, Hamburg, Le Havre and Rotterdam acting as container transhipment hubs in North Europe, this thesis attempts to theorise port competition. Apart from providing a theoretical framework, Port Competitiveness Model, to future port research, this thesis also aims to identify the major factors affecting port attractiveness, to assess port choice behaviour, to investigate the current port competitiveness and to forecast their future prospects in the market. Research methodology involves various quantitative modelling techniques including generalized cost calculations (to assess port attractiveness), Multinomial Logit Model (to assess port choice behaviours of liners and the current competitive positions of ports) and Logistic Regression (to predict port competitiveness in the future), while data collection includes a questionnaire survey of major liners and various in-depth interviews with <b>port</b> and shipping <b>experts</b> in Europe. Findings indicate that money and time are not sufficient to explain the choices of liners and other less-quantifiable factors like geography, quality of services, values and perceptions, inertia, limitations of liners are also significant. Rotterdam is currently the overall market leader in the North European transhipment market but may be fragile in resisting challenges from competitors while Hamburg is a regional leader in the Scandinavia-Baltic market. On the other hand, Bremerhaven is currently an underachiever but possesses potential if it changes its current competitive strategies while Antwerp also possesses potential but faces different problems in its developments. For poor performing ports like Felixstowe and Le Havre, they need to improve significantly before they can really compete. Also, results suggest that ports should not only focus on expensive physical improvements (like infrastructure) but should also pay attention to software aspects in port operations e. g. management, marketing, etc. The key to achieve port competitiveness does not depend on port's administrative system but on how it executes the system and makes things work. In the foreseeable future, the author firmly believes that this thesis will become one of the theoretical 'pillars' in the theory of port competition. </p...|$|R

Rete Autostrade Mediterranee (RAM), lead partner of the project, has implemented apilot action focused on the analysis of technical and legislative characteristics of the Directive 2010 / 65 /EU on “Reporting formalities for ships arriving in and/or departing from ports of the Member States”, its status of implementation in Italy, possible scenarios for integrating and upscaling existing Port Management Information System (PMIS) and National Single Window (NSW) prototyping in Italy, Cost-Benefit analysis (CBA) for re-engineering existing Port Community Systems (PCSs) in the port of Venice and Levante (Bari) to fulfil reporting formalities according with the EU Directive. In the analysis {{carried out in the}} two ports (the selected case studies), the CBA evidenced the huge amount of potential benefits for the logistic chain triggered by the decrease of dwell time for containers in ports, through reengineering of the existing PCSs within the envisage NSW framework. Dwell time is then crucial for the definition of scenarios of port competitiveness and benchmarking, since it may be largely reduced by the implementation of pre-clearing procedures. Pre-clearing (“anticipated electronic customs clearance”) is able to speeding up of formalities and the consequent relieving of port traffic congestion. The simplification of customs procedures may result in significant benefits for the door-to-door transport time and costs. This aspect has clearly emerged together with lack of top-down information by the two Port Authorities on dwell time. CBA indicators are very positive for both ports and demonstrate how the re-engineering of PCSs in Venice and Bari is expected to lead to abig amount of net benefits. Dwell time is astrategic Key Performance Indicators (KPI) for ports (both for public and private stakeholders), often very difficult to calculate due to confidentiality issues as well as being pre-clearing procedure just testing in some ports in Italy. Nevertheless, acustomized survey at the two ports among local stakeholders (e. g. customs forwarders, freight forwarders, etc.) is deemed necessary and recommended. Despite of the information and data gathering activities implemented at the two Port Authorities, the aforementioned integrative survey should enable to boost CBA results. Key recommendations for ensuring the Italy's NSW compliance with the Directive 2010 / 65 /EU: a) Setting enabling legal framework for the NSW development; b) Setting functional and technical specifications and testing for the NSW development; c) Identification of core business processes for the NSW development; d) National consultation and working groups activities with public and private stakeholders; e) Reengineering and upscaling of PCSs for their interoperability with the NSW; f) Setting high-level (medium-long timeframe) master plan for the NSW full deployment...|$|R
40|$|In 1999, Flanders and The Netherlands {{agreed to}} set up a common {{strategy}} for managing the Scheldt River in its estuarine reach. In 2002, both parties signed a memorandum of understanding in which was defined a ‘Long Term Vision’ strategy and its objectives. One of these is the preservation in the Western Scheldt of a dynamic and complex flood and ebb channel network, the so-called ‘multi-channel system’. The present trend, a continuation of past natural morphological evolutions combined with human interference (poldering, dredging and other river works) may jeopardise this objective. An expert team appointed by the Port of Antwerp proposed the idea of morphological dredging for curbing this negative trend, aiming at steering the estuarine morphology. In a first phase, sediment from dredging works could be used to reshape sandbars where needed. One case study is discussed in this paper, the aim being to reconstruct the eroded tip of a sandbar at a bifurcation so that the flood and ebb flows would be perseved, a condition to maintain the multi-channel system in the reach. The strategy would not only cut back on the ongoing degradation of the ecological and morphological values of the estuary, but it could also possibly help reducing the quantity of material to be dredged on the crossings by increasing the scouring or self-dredging capacity of the flow. A diffuser-type device was used to disperse the dredged material in a controlled way in shallow water along the sandbar edges. In 2002 - 2003, the new disposal strategy has been investigated by Flanders Hydraulics Research as a pilot project (Plaat van Walsoorden). The research programme combined three tools: field measurements, physical scale models and 3 D numerical models. The results of the research work confirmed the feasibility of the idea. However, the <b>Port</b> of Antwerp <b>Experts</b> concluded that a real life (in situ) disposal test was required to give final proof of the feasibility of this new disposal strategy. At the end of 2004, 500, 000 m³ of sand was disposed at the seaward tip of the shoal of Walsoorden using a diffuser. The main idea was to modify the morphology of this sandbar by disposing dredged material very precisely. The amount of 500, 000 m³ was chosen because it is large enough to see an effect of the disposed sediment, while it is small enough to be reversible if something would go wrong. To evaluate the success of this in situ test, an extensive monitoring programme was set up, including bathymetric surveys, ecological monitoring, sediment tracing tests and sediment transport measurements. After one year of monitoring the disposed sediments, it can be concluded that the experiment is very successful. The morphological monitoring showed that almost 80 % of the disposed sediments is still on the disposal location after one year. The ecological monitoring did not reveal any significant negativeimpact, neither in the intertidal areas, nor in the subtidal areas. This in situ test confirmed the feasibility of the proposed disposal strategy. An estimated volume of 4 to 5 million m³ could be disposed here to reach the proposed objectives, representing {{more than half of the}} volume dredged yearly in the Western Scheldt...|$|R
