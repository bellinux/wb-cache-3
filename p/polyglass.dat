50|$|<b>Polyglass</b> {{technology}} {{was introduced by}} Focal in 1988. This consists in depositing fine glass micro-balls {{on the surface of}} a cellulose pulp cone (paper). This combination of glass and paper results in a very rigid material with a low mass, providing excellent damping qualities. The <b>Polyglass</b> cone resulted in a very linear frequency response curve and improved the definition of the midrange.|$|E
50|$|In the 1980s, the two brands became established. Focal {{focused on}} innovation, {{producing}} specialised {{products such as}} the <b>Polyglass</b> “V” cone and Polykevlar cone. The materials used on the tweeter evolved from glass fibres to Kevlar, producing a more linear frequency response curve and a smoother and less piercing treble.As for JMlab, the company {{went from being a}} manufacturer of small-and medium-sized loudspeakers to a manufacturer of veritable high-end models.|$|E

He {{served as a}} fighter pilot in the Royal Flying Corps during World War I, and on his return to {{civilian}} work, became active in the new Union of Post Office Workers. He was Deputy General Secretary of the union from 1941, then General Secretary from 1944 to 1957. [...] In 1955, he served as President of the Trades Union Congress. Geddes was Chairman of <b>Polyglass</b> Ltd.|$|E

40|$|The <b>polyglass</b> {{composite}} material Artglass and Signum by Heraeus-Kulzer, Germany, was analyzed. The analysis of identical samples {{was made by}} two methods of measuring, i. e. with a stylus instrument and by means of atomic force microscopy (AFM). The results of the AFM method proved already expected better polishing characteristics of microfilling <b>polyglass</b> composite Signum in comparison with all the evaluated methods of polishing of the hybride <b>polyglass</b> composite Artglass. The values obtained with the stylus instrument MST- 211 show {{the significance of the}} period of time the dental technician spends in order to polish the <b>polyglass</b> {{composite material}} in the best possible way. The resulting placement of samples on the list is different in the two methods of analysis, and statistical evaluation proved no correlation between them. The fact {{may be due to the}} differences in the scale of the surface analyzed, due to different points of measurement, etc. Thus the results are of an informative character and only the analysis of a higher number of places in more samples could bring more precise results.

40|$|New {{indirect}} composites {{with improved}} qualities {{have been introduced}} as alternative to porcelain. There is little information regarding the bond strength of the new metal resin bonding systems, mainly when they are applied onto titanium surfaces. This study evaluated the shear bond strength of two indirect composite resin (Artglass/Heraeus Kulzer and Targis/Ivoclar) to cast titanium (Ti) and gold alloy (Au). Twenty metallic structures (4 mm in diameter, 4, 0 mm thick) of each alloy were cast shaped and abraded with 250 mm aluminum oxide before {{the application of the}} bond system for each polymer. Artglass opaque, dentin and enamel composite were applied using teflon matrices onto titanium and gold alloy structures. The same procedure was achieved to Targis and they were polymerized according to the manufactures' recommendations. The samples were stored in distilled water for 24 hours at 37 ºC and thermocycled (5 º and 55 ºC/ 3000 cycles). Shear bond strength tests were performed by using an Instron Universal testing machine at a crosshead speed of 5 mm/min. Data were analyzed statistically with 2 -way ANOVA and Tukey test (a= 0, 5). The results indicated that the gold alloy was statistically better than the cast titanium (18, 44 MPa and 9, 81 MPa respectively) and Targis ceromer (16, 61 MPa) showed significant higher shear bond strength than Artglass <b>polyglass</b> (11, 64 MPa) in all tested alloys. The best result was achieved when the ceromer was applied onto gold alloy...|$|E
