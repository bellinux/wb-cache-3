[...] A man need not suspect his womenkind but he should know what they are doing. It is duty, his <b>protective</b> <b>duty</b> to them. These companions, these Seyffert women and so forth, were all very well in their way; there wasn't much they kept from you if you got them cornered and asked them intently. But a father's eye is better. He must go about with the girl for a time, watch her with other men, give her chances to talk {{business}} with him and see if she took them. [...] "V.V., I'm going to make a man of you," [...] the phrase ran through his brain. The deep instinctive jealousy of the primordial father was still strong in old Grammont's blood.

60|$|Just {{when the}} sense of unreality and oppression were strongest upon me, and when I most wanted help, a man sat at my side and began to talk what he called politics. I had chanced to pay about six shillings for a travelling-cap worth {{eighteen}} pence, and he made of the fact a text for a sermon. He {{said that this was}} a rich country and that the people liked to pay two hundred per cent on the value of a thing. They could afford it. He said that the Government imposed a <b>protective</b> <b>duty</b> of from ten to seventy per cent on foreign-made articles, and that the American manufacturer consequently could sell his goods for a healthy sum. Thus an imported hat would, with duty, cost two guineas. The American manufacturer would make a hat for seventeen shillings and sell it for one pound fifteen. In these things, he said, lay the greatness of America and the effeteness of England. Competition between factory and factory kept the prices down to decent limits, but I was never to forget that this people were a rich people, not like the pauper Continentals, and that they enjoyed paying duties. To my weak intellect this seemed rather like juggling with counters. Everything that I have yet purchased costs about twice as much as it would in England, and when native-made is of inferior quality. Moreover, since these lines were first thought of I have visited a gentleman who owned a factory which used to produce things. He owned the factory still. Not a man was in it, but he was drawing a handsome income from a syndicate of firms for keeping it closed in order that it might not produce things. This man said that if protection were abandoned, a tide of pauper labour would flood the country, and as I looked at his factory I thought how entirely better it was to have no labour of any kind whatever, rather than face so horrible a future. Meantime, do you remember that this peculiar country enjoys paying money for value not received. I am an alien, and {{for the life of me}} cannot see why six shillings should be paid for eighteen-penny caps, or eight shillings for half-crown cigar-cases. When the country fills up to a decently populated level a few million people who are not aliens will be smitten with the same sort of blindness.|$|E

60|$|In 1841 the whig {{government}} {{raised the}} question of the sugar duties, and proposed to substitute a <b>protective</b> <b>duty</b> of 12/ per cwt. for the actual or virtual prohibition of foreign sugars which had up to that time subsisted. They were strongly opposed, and decisively beaten. The argument used against them was, I think, twofold. There was the protection plea on behalf of the West Indians whose estates were now worked only by free labour--and there was the great and popular contention that the measure not only admitted sugar the product of slave labour, which we would not allow our own colonies to employ, but that our new supplies would be derived from Brazil, and above all from Cuba and Puerto Rico, where the slave trade was rampant, and was prosecuted on an enormous scale. The government of Sir R. Peel largely modified our system. Its general professions were the abolition of prohibition, and the reduction of protective duties to a moderate rate. In 1844 it was determined to deal with the sugar duties, and to admit sugar at, I think, a rate of 10/ per cwt. beyond the rate for British-grown. But we had to bear in mind the arguments of 1841, and it was determined that the sugars so to be admitted were to be the product of free labour only. There was some uncertainty from whence they were to come. Java produced sugar largely, under a system involving certain restraints, but as we contended essentially free. The whole argument, however, was difficult and perplexed, and a parliamentary combination was formed against the government. The opposition, with perfect consistency, mustered in full force. The West Indian interest, which, though much reduced in wealth, still subsisted as a parliamentary entity, was keenly arrayed on the same side. There were some votes attracted by dislike, perhaps, to the argument on our side, which appeared to be complex and over-refined. A meeting of the party was held in order to confront the crisis. Sir Robert Peel stated his case in a speech which was thought to be haughty and unconciliatory. I do not recollect whether there was hostile discussion, or whether silence and the sulks prevailed. But I remember that when the meeting of the party broke up, Sir Robert Peel said on quitting the room that it was the worst meeting he had ever attended. It left disagreeable anticipations as to the division which was in immediate prospect.... The opposition in general had done what they could to strengthen their momentary association with the West Indian conservatives. Their hopes of a majority depended entirely upon conservative votes. Of course, therefore, it was vital to confine the attack to the merits of the question immediately before the House, as an attack upon the policy of the government generally could only strengthen it by awakening the susceptibilities of party and so reclaiming the stray voters to the administration. Lord Howick, entering into the debate as the hours of enhanced interest began, made a speech which attacked the conservative policy at large, and gave the opening for an effective reply. Lord Stanley perceived his opportunity and turned it to account with great force and adroitness. In a strictly retaliatory speech, he wound up conservative sentiment on behalf of ministers, and restored the tone of the House. The clouds of the earlier evening hours dispersed, and the government was victorious. Two speeches, one negatively and the other positively, reversed the prevailing current, and saved the administration. I have never known a parallel case. The whole honour of the fray, in the ministerial sense, redounded to Lord Stanley. I doubt whether in the twenty-six years of his after life he ever struck such a stroke as this.|$|E

40|$|The Author {{examines}} {{the notion of}} subjective rights {{from the perspective of}} the distinction made by the Italian constitution between subjective rights and “legitimate interests”. He distinguishes between rights within a complex relationship, like credits, and rights without any relationships, like ownership. Obligations in the modern age are conceived as complex legal relationships including not only duties of performance but also protective ones (Schutzpflichten, obblighi di protezione) with the purpose of protecting the other arty’s economic and non-economic interest at risk during the relationship. As the consequence of the rule of good faith and correctness, <b>protective</b> <b>duties</b> oblige both parties, the debtor as well as the creditor. Since <b>protective</b> <b>duties</b> are compatible with the position of the creditor, who is in a position of supremacy, there is no contradiction in extending this model to the position of the public administration with respect to citizens directly affected by its acts. Italian jurisprudence recognizes the right to award damages in favour of citizens adversely affected by acts adopted illegitimately by the public administration, but the grounds for this remedy is controversial. Within a framework criticized by the Author, a part of Jurisprudence, supported by some scholars, applies the rules of torts in line with a so-called trend of “remedialism”, which overshadows the question of grounds for remedies in favour of a generic concept of the effectiveness of the remedy: no matter what the legal reason, the overriding concern is to provide the remedy, that is damages in these cases. According to the Author the more apposite form of responsibility in such cases is contractual responsibility. Although citizens do not necessarily have a right to performance of a certain administrative act, nevertheless the public administration is obliged to adopt its acts in a correct manner protecting citizens who have a reasonable expectation of its correctness, thus the violation of correctness provides sufficient grounds for damages. <b>Protective</b> <b>duties</b> imply that the counterpart occupies a special legal position, a subjective relative right, without a claim to performance, but only with the claim for damages in case of violation of the duty. This extension of the category of <b>protective</b> <b>duties</b> to public administrations confirms that in the matter of responsibility it is possible to conceive of a common law between private and public law, while the special concept of “legitimate interests” is to be confined to the matter of validity of the acts adopted by the public administration, thus avoiding any confusion between the question of validity and that of responsibility...|$|R
