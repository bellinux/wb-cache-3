5|$|According to two {{separate}} research {{studies conducted in}} 2009, {{at the national level}} 65% of the flex-fuel registered vehicles regularly used ethanol fuel, and the usage climbed to 93% in São Paulo, the main ethanol producer state where local taxes are lower, and <b>prices</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> pump are more competitive than gasoline. However, as a result of higher ethanol prices caused by the Brazilian ethanol industry crisis that began in 2009, combined with government subsidies to keep gasoline price lower than the international market value, by November 2013 only 23% flex-fuel car owners were using ethanol, down from 66% in 2009.|$|E
5|$|In Europe, formal futures markets {{appeared}} in the Dutch Republic during the 17th century. Among the most notable centered on the tulip market, {{at the height of}} Tulipmania. At the peak of tulip mania, in February 1637, some single tulip bulbs sold for more than 10 times the annual income of a skilled craftsworker. Research is difficult because of the limited economic data from the 1630s—much of which come from biased and very speculative sources. Some modern economists have proposed rational explanations, rather than a speculative mania, for the rise and fall in prices. For example, other flowers, such as the hyacinth, also had high initial <b>prices</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> time of their introduction, which immediately fell. The high asset prices may also have been driven by expectations of a parliamentary decree that contracts could be voided for a small cost—thus lowering the risk to buyers.|$|E

50|$|Candlesticks {{are usually}} {{composed}} of the body (black or white), and an upper and a lower shadow (wick): the area between the open and the close is called the real body, price excursions {{above and below the}} real body are called shadows.

If the security closed higher than it opened, the body is white or unfilled, with <b>the</b> opening <b>price</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom of the body and <b>the</b> closing <b>price</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top. If the security closed lower than it opened, the body is black, with <b>the</b> opening <b>price</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> top and <b>the</b> closing <b>price</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> bottom.

5|$|The {{positive}} {{economic outlook}} for Greece—based {{on the return}} of seasonally adjusted real GDP growth across {{the first three quarters}} of 2014—was replaced by a new fourth recession starting in Q4-2014. This new fourth recession was widely assessed as being direct related to the premature snap parliamentary election called by the Greek parliament in December 2014 and the following formation of a Syriza-led government refusing to accept respecting the terms of its current bailout agreement. The rising political uncertainty of what would follow caused the Troika to suspend all scheduled remaining aid to Greece under its current programme, until such time as the Greek government either accepted the previously negotiated conditional payment terms or alternatively could reach a mutually accepted agreement of some new updated terms with its public creditors. This rift caused a renewed increasingly growing liquidity crisis (both for the Greek government and Greek financial system), resulting in plummeting stock <b>prices</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> Athens Stock Exchange while interest rates for the Greek government at the private lending market spiked to levels once again making it inaccessible as an alternative funding source.|$|E

25|$|The new {{demand for}} beef {{as a result}} of the {{establishment}} of goldfields, the growth of the sugar industry, the establishment of ports and a run of fair seasons restarted squatting in north Queensland. This second wave of expansion, from 1874, created a demand for stores and breeders not only in north Queensland but in Western Australia and the Northern Territory. While this eased the pastoralists' financial situation in the short run, it exacerbated the problem in the long term as the grossly oversupplied market caused extremely low cattle <b>prices</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> end of the 1870s. By 1880 north Queensland cattle numbers were estimated at 450,000 - almost three times the 1874 figure. The Townsville boiling down works re-opened in 1880 to deal with the excess.|$|E

With one large single supplier of logs in Queensland and a few favourably-located buyers it is considered that a bilateral monopoly model is appropriate for analysing price outcomes, rent sharing and volumes supplied in the market. Prices are not determined through the market but are negotiated by the parties supplying and buying the logs...|$|R
