40|$|The {{effects of}} {{including}} a hydrophilic coating around the particles are studied {{across a wide}} range of <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> by performing Monte Carlo simulations of protons diffusing through a system of magnetic particles. A physically realistic methodology of implementing the coating by cross boundary jump scaling and transition probabilities at the coating surface is developed. Using this formulation, the coating has three distinct impacts on the relaxation rate: an enhancement at small <b>particle</b> <b>sizes,</b> a degradation at intermediate <b>particle</b> <b>sizes,</b> and no effect at large <b>particles</b> <b>sizes.</b> These varied effects are reconciled with the underlying dephasing mechanisms by using the concept of a full dephasing zone to present a physical picture of the dephasing process with and without the coating for all sizes. The enhancement at small <b>particle</b> <b>sizes</b> is studied systemically to demonstrate the existence of an optimal ratio of diffusion coefficients inside/outside the coating to achieve maximal increase in the relaxation rate.
