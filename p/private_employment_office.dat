40|$|At {{the turn}} of the 20 th century, state and local governments in the U. S. began to {{establish}} public <b>employment</b> <b>offices.</b> These non-profit governmental organizations match job seekers and businesses. One of the main objectives of these organizations was to protect job seekers from fraudulent activities by <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> agencies. In this paper, I propose a theory that describes malpractices of <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> agencies as a situation of asymmetric information between job seekers and <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> agencies which could cause adverse selection in the labor exchange market. The establishment of public <b>employment</b> <b>offices</b> {{can be viewed as a}} policy device to eliminate low quality <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> agencies that committed malpractices. I show that public <b>employment</b> <b>offices</b> helped lower the degree of asymmetric information. The majority of job seekers who used public <b>employment</b> <b>offices</b> were unskilled workers, immigrants or migrants who were vulnerable to exploitation by <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> agencies. I also find that the role of public <b>employment</b> <b>offices</b> was especially important for interstate migrants who were most lacking in information and networks in this new environment...|$|R
30|$|The {{reforms were}} {{implemented}} between 2003 and 2005. They modernized public employment services {{and social welfare}} centers, modified existing active labor programs, and introduced new active labor programs. The reforms changed the institutional and legal framework for the rights and responsibilities of the unemployed and the beneficiaries of social assistance. Employment protection was reduced for parts of the labor market. Public employment services and social welfare centers adopted results-based accountability and outsourced services through competition between public and <b>private</b> providers. <b>Employment</b> <b>offices</b> were (partly) merged with social welfare units and converted into centers that provided job search assistance, social services, and benefit payments. Unemployment and social benefit levels and duration were reduced. Eligibility for subsistence allowances were changed according to a person’s ability to work rather than previous history of contributions. Benefits were cut if recipients did not meet their responsibilities. Wage subsidies and start-up grants were provided to entrepreneurs. Jobs with reduced social security contributions were introduced (“midi-jobs”), and the regulations for jobs exempt from such contributions were reformed (“mini-jobs”). The objective was to {{lower the cost of}} hiring low skilled workers.|$|R

After finding the number of <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> agencies, the sample group’s websites were investigated and the information about their features was analyzed by using a content analyzing method. The results have been categorized according to local or global status, services provided and differences in services provided.

40|$|Seventy years ago, in {{the depths}} of the Great Depression, the United States instituted a {{national}} labor exchange policy to aid economic recovery and labor market stability. To implement it, the new Roosevelt Administration and Congress established a federal–state system of public <b>employment</b> <b>offices.</b> Throughout subsequent economic, social, and political changes, the federal–state system under the Wagner-Peyser Act has provided steady and equitable labor exchange services to job seekers and employers. This chapter describes the evolution of labor exchange policy in the United States, summarizes the major findings in the preceding chapters, and provides reflections about the future of labor exchange policy.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{consequences}} of the existence of <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> agencies on the labor market. Using a matching framework, we study the conditions of existence of <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> agencies and the consequences of competition on the market for job placement. We show that the <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> agencies enter in the labour market only if they are much more efficient than the private agency. Moreover, the level of the unemployment benefits is a disincentive to manage workers for the private agency. Because of a high fallback position for the worker, it is costly for the <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> agency to manage a worker having some low probabilities to exit from unemployment. If these conditions are satisfied, the existence of <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> agencies improve the labor market through shorter unemployment spells and a lower unemployment rate. Moreover, an improvement in the matching process is an incentive for the firms to post vacancies at the private agencies. Nevertheless, the workers managed by the private agencies receive some lower wages than the other workers because of the payment by the firm for recruiting a worker. Finally, we show that <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> agencies have a natural disincentive to manage unskilled workers. But, the introduction of a subsidy to match an unskilled worker with a vacancy seems to be a sufficient incentive to make the <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> agencies managing unskilled workers.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{technical}} efficiency differences {{of a sample}} of regional <b>employment</b> <b>offices</b> (REOs) across Swiss cantons. Regular job-search assistance, registration and matching of unemployed workers with job vacancies performed by <b>employment</b> <b>offices</b> are all important active labour market policies (ALMPs) which are often ignored in the literature evaluating the impact of active measures. The analysis is carried out {{by means of a}} stochastic production frontier model estimated on a panel of <b>employment</b> <b>offices</b> observed over the period between November 2000 and December 2001. The results show that the specific exogenous conditions exercise a strong influence over the technical efficiency of each <b>employment</b> <b>office.</b> Even though these conditions affect significantly the relative performance of regional <b>employment</b> <b>offices,</b> the managerial efficiency component does remain important. Hence, <b>employment</b> <b>offices</b> may improve their efficiency by adopting better managerial practices. Finally, the job placement process is characterised by decreasing returns to scale.

40|$|Abstract: The {{relationship}} between unemployment, real wages and government employment is examined {{to determine the}} nature of the transmission mechanism {{and the extent to which}} <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> is crowded-out by government employment. We find in Germany, Japan and the U. S. that there is full crowding-out (i. e. unemployment is not affected by changes in government employment). According to traditional theory, the fall in <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> results from the rise in real wages that increases in government employment generate. Our findings cast doubt on the relevance of such a transmission mechanism. We instead attribute the fall in <b>private</b> <b>employment</b> to the increased disincentives for firm and job creation which are associated with increases in government employment...|$|R
