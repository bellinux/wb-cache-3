50|$|The {{basic design}} dates {{back more than}} a century. It {{consists}} of a double-wall gas generator, a perforated burner ring, and an inner <b>preheat</b> <b>chamber.</b> A similar design was patented in 1904 by New York coppersmith J. Heinrichs. Trangia has been selling a commercial version of the design since 1925, and Safesport marketed a stainless-steel stove in the 1990s. The Trangia stove burner is made from brass, although all the other associated parts that come with it are aluminium.|$|E
50|$|In the {{unpressurized}} open-top {{design the}} double wall {{acts as a}} gas generator, transferring heat from the flame to the fuel. This effect enhances combustion, producing more heat than other passive designs. The inner wall also creates a convenient <b>preheat</b> <b>chamber</b> for starting the stove. Once the fuel has warmed up, its vapor will travel up the hollow wall, pass through the perforations, and form a ring of flame. This improves air/fuel mixing and therefore combustion. Vapor also rises {{from the center of}} the stove, but will pass through the ring of flame for efficient combustion as long as a pot is over the stove. Other pressurized designs aim for efficient combustion through closing the fuel chamber after filling, or by filling through the gas-jet holes.|$|E

40|$|The {{articulation}} subsystem actuators were rigorously {{tested in}} severe environments. They were operated through temperature ranges from - 73 C to + 121 C. In each case the temperature {{rate of change}} was at maximum. The actuator under test at room temperature was put into a pre-chilled or <b>preheated</b> <b>chamber.</b> Satisfactory performance was obtained throughout this full temperature range and under the temperature shock conditions above. However, at temperatures below - 78 C some leakage was experienced through the O-ring seal around the shaft. The actuators were subjected to severe vibration and 500 g shock test with a time duration of 0. 0007 seconds. The scan actuator was life tested by operating it from stop to stop through 2, 000 cycles with 20, 000 start-stop procedures randomly distributed through the 2, 000 cycles...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} scale fluidized bed pyrolysis {{system has been}} designed and fabricated for obtaining liquid fuel from biomass solid wastes. The components of the system are: fluidized bed reactor, gas <b>preheating</b> <b>chamber,</b> reactor feeder, heating system, heater feeder, liquid condenser and liquid collectors. The reactor operating parameters and dimensions have been considered {{on the basis of}} cold model study and thermo-gravimetric analysis (TGA) of the feedstock. The major components made of stainless steel. A number of trial runs have been carried out with jute-stick as feedstock. At an optimum pyrolysis condition of fluidized bed temperature of 425 oC with 300 - 600 µm feed particle size and 30 l/min fluidizing gas flow rate, the oil product is found to be 50 wt % of dry biomass feed. The oil obtained at this optimum condition is analyzed for their fuel properties-compared with other biomass pyrolysis oils and petroleum product. The fuel properties compared are physical properties, calorific value, elemental (CHNOS) analysis and chemical composition using FTIR spectroscopy...|$|R
40|$|Installing a small {{cylindrical}} tube, a {{short distance}} away from the fuel nozzle, successfully reduced the combustion noise generated in a small cooking burner. To investigate the mechanism, the characteristics of the fuel spray were examined with and without the tube insert. Laser-sheet flow visualizations provided a qualitative description of the spray. Droplet size and velocity measurements were carried out close to the fuel nozzle (< 2 in) using a Phase Doppler Particle Analyzer (PDPA). The experiments were performed in a cold-flow spray rig with optical access using MIL-C- 7024 as fuel surrogate. The geometry of the <b>preheating</b> <b>chamber</b> of the burner is replicated using quartz windows. The spray cone angle, estimated from the flow visualization photographs, suggests interaction with the inner wall of the cylindrical tube. This is consistent with previous findings from a CFD simulation. The PDPA measurements show that the wall interactions resulted in large droplets being formed {{in the middle of the}} spray. This change in the average droplet size due to the inserted tube is believed to alter the drop evaporation time, which in turn will affect the transient characteristics of the burner and ultimately suppress combustion instabilities...|$|R
25|$|Compression {{ignition}} Diesel engines {{ignite the}} fuel-air mixture {{by the heat}} of compression and do not need a spark. They usually have glowplugs that <b>preheat</b> the combustion <b>chamber</b> to allow starting in cold weather. Other engines may use a flame, or a heated tube, for ignition. While this was common for very early engines it is now rare.|$|R
50|$|The main {{advantage}} of climbing kilns is that {{heat from the}} burning fuel is re-used, the same heat heating more than {{one part of the}} kiln. Exhaust heat created during firing of {{the lower part of the}} kiln, <b>preheats</b> the <b>chambers</b> above. In addition, the cooling ware and walls below preheat the incoming air. Thus, firing of ware in the upper chambers requires only the additional fuel needed to bring the ware, walls and air to peak temperature. (From a thermodynamic point of view, the higher temperature of combustion and cooler exhaust suggest greater efficiency.) A modern type, called a tube kiln improves the efficiency and output still further by having the ware move through the kiln in a direction opposite to that of the hot gasses.|$|R

Subsequent to <b>preheating</b> phase, steam <b>chamber</b> creation and reaching overburden, a heavy solvent will be co-injected followed by the co-injection of a lighter hydrocarbon such as propane. When the steam chamber starts the blow down phase, a non-condensable gas such as methane will be injected to maintain the steam chamber pressure.|$|R
40|$|N,N. -Ethylenebisstearimide (EBS) {{is one of}} {{the most}} commonlyused {{lubricants}} in the powder metallurgy (PM) industry in the sintering process. During sintering, the lubricated powder compacts are heat-treated to temperatures in excess of 1, 200 °C thus fusing adjacent particles and yielding a part with improved mechanical strength. Delubrication commonly is achieved in the first zone of a sintering furnace by heating the part to temperatures in the 500 - 600 °C temperature range at a fixed rate and under controlled atmospheric conditions; this strategy minimizes defects, carbon contamination, and compact deformation. The de-lubricated part then enters the second zone (commonly in the 1200 - 1300 °C temperature range) for sintering. The third zone cools the sintered part at a desired rate to obtain the requisite micro-structural properties. Controlled delubrication is imperative towards achieving high quality parts for the following reasons: the elevated thermal gradient at the transition between the first and second zones can cause parts to expand rapidly and develop microscopic fissures (. blistering.); improper gas flows and belt speeds can lead to carbon deposition on the part and at the grain boundaries (sooting); delubrication products deposit throughout the furnace, even in the coolers, which are far removed from the <b>preheating</b> <b>chamber,</b> leading to significant maintenance costs; pollutants emitted in the exhaust stream of furnaces operating inefficiently are increasingly of environmental concern. In practice, lubricant removal is difficult to control, which often leads to reduced yields in PM manufacturing processes. Throughput is another important issue: process control ideally should lead to a delubrication cycle that yields defect-free parts in a minimum of furnace time, thereby increasing productivity and reducing the net energy consumption. Efficient process control requires rapid monitoring of suitable indicators, preferably gasphase products of delubrication. EBS thermolyzes relatively cleanly in a range of furnace atmospheres, but the mechanism governing the pyrolysis of EBS, compacted with iron powder, is not known and needs to be investigated to determine the parameters important for industrial control, as well as the optimal conditions of delubrication. In addition, a thorough understanding of the pre-sintering chemistry will enable the development of a process control sensor...|$|R

40|$|The {{paper is}} aimed at {{considering}} the aircraft engine conversion into peak or short-used energy unit, which is relevant for the task of developing the northern regions of the Russian Federation. The three-shaft turbojet engine with a twelve-stage compressor and a four-stage turbine is adopted as an aircraft engine under consideration. The afterburner with a block of jet nozzles {{is removed from the}} gas generator module, and a heating chamber is set at the outlet of the by-pass duct to raise electric power of engine and not complicate the construction by the presence of a mixing chamber. In addition, the heating chamber serves to equalize the total pressure and flow temperature in the section before the free turbine and allows the use of a short adapter between the gas generator module and the free turbine, which reduces the loss of total pressure. Then a free turbine and a diffuser with an exhaust device are installed. The output shaft of the power turbine is connected by means of a coupling to an alternating current (a. c.) generator or other special load. To find the parameters of the plant, a calculation was made in which the initial data were taken, namely a gas temperature in front of the turbine of 1530 K (the gas temperature in front of the turbine is reduced by 100 K in order to prolong the engine life; therefore, the gas temperature before the turbine was 1630 K); air flow of 364 kg/s; bypass ratio of 1. 36 (the ratio of the air flow passing through the bypass duct to the air flow entering the core). As a result, it consumes 0. 296 kg / (kWh) (fuel-aviation kerosene) and a power capacity of 78. 5 MW. For the received value of capacity the ТЗФП- 80 - 2 У 3 a. c. electric generator has been chosen as the load. As a result, the power plant, equipped with a converted engine and electric generator, has an electric power of 77. 3 MW and an efficiency of 27. 8 %. To assess the effect of introduced <b>preheating</b> <b>chamber</b> on the parameters of the gas turbine engine, a calculation was performed with no heating chamber, and it was obtained that the introduction of a heating chamber in the bypass duct to heat the bypass duct airflow from 402 K to 967 K, reduces the engine efficiency by 2 %, but increases its power by 79 % - from 43. 8 MW to 78. 5 MW. Due to the sufficiently high gas temperature, the converted engine has a relatively short lifetime. On the contrary, the free turbine has a longer life, and therefore {{there is no need to}} manufacture a free turbine for each converted engine. For an approximate evaluation of the free turbine life before the overhaul of the engine hot section, the maximum stress at the root of the working blade was calculated. For temperature values of 1000 K and stress of 242 MPa it is possible to create a turbine with a lifetime of over 30, 000 hours. </p...|$|R
40|$|Temperature {{profiles}} and {{cycle times}} in a large-scale medical waste incinerator installed in a re-ferral hospital {{were used to assess}} the performance and functionality of incinerator. The study was conducted using data collected from 8 cycles per days for 67 days. For proper combustion and destruction of toxic components in the primary chamber and destruction of pollutants and toxic components in the flue gas, it is desired to reach the maximum temperature in the chambers faster and maintain this maximum temperature for an extended time interval. The primary and secon-dary temperatures T 1 and T 2, respectively, were recorded at an interval of one minute for different cycles. Different amounts of wastes with varying proportions of sharps and other wastes were loaded into the incinerator and temperature profiles recorded. The analysis shows that the incin-erator works at primary temperature less than the required recommended by manufacturer while the secondary chamber operates between 600 and above 950 ˚C, although higher temperatures up to 1020 ˚C were observed. The average load preparation time was observed to be 14. 6 minutes, while the <b>chamber</b> <b>preheating</b> time before daily initial loading was 25. 45 minutes.

40|$|To provide {{guidance}} for intelligent selection of various parameters in the Multi-Material Laser Densification (MMLD) process for dental restorations, {{finite element modeling}} (FEM) {{has been carried out}} to investigate the MMLD process. These modeling investigations include the thermal analysis of the nominal surface temperature that should be adopted during experiments in order to achieve the desired microstructure; the effects of the volume shrinkage due to transformation from a powder compact to dense liquid on the temperature distribution {{and the size of the}} transformation zone; the evolution of transient temperature, transient stresses, residual stresses and distortions; and the effects of laser processing conditions, such as fabrication sequences, laser scanning patterns, component sizes, preheating temperatures, laser scanning rates, initial porosities, and thicknesses of each powder layer, on the final quality of the component fabricated via the MMLD process. ^ The simulation results are compared with the experiments. It is found that the predicted temperature distribution matches the experiments very well. The nominal surface temperature applied on the dental porcelain body should be below 1273 K to prevent the forming of the un-desired microstructure (i. e., a leucite-free glassy phase). The simplified models that do not include the volume shrinkage effect provide good estimations of the temperature field and the size of the laser-densified body, although the shape of the laser-densified body predicted is different from that obtained in the experiment. It is also fount that warping and residual thermal stresses of the laser-densified component are more sensitive to the <b>chamber</b> <b>preheating</b> temperature and the thickness of each powder layer than to the laser scanning rate and the initial porosity of the powder layer. The major mechanism responsible for these phenomena is identified to be related to the change of the temperature gradient induced by these laser processing parameters. The simulation result indicates that the size of the part to be processed has strong influence on the laser-processed part. The out-of-plane distortion of a layer processed by a moving laser beam can be minimized with a proper selection of the laser scanning pattern. The distortion is mainly caused by transient thermal stresses rather than residual thermal stresses. ...|$|R
40|$|Environmental, {{financial}} and legal reasons demand {{the development of}} cleaner diesel engines. Atomization, evaporation and mixing phenomena observed during injection of Diesel fuel affect the produced emissions. To study these phenomena, under engine-like conditions (50 bar, 1000 K), a chemically <b>preheated</b> constant volume <b>chamber</b> was built. A system of sensors, driven in real-time by a FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array) and controlled by a Real Time Controller, was built to monitor and control the operations. A modern common rail fuel injection system (Bosch CP 3) was driven by a purpose-modified Hartridge 1100 test stand and controlled by the FPGA (Field Programmable Gate Array). Chemical heating is a technique used widely to simulate the ambient conditions of an industrial combustor in a constant volume vessel. A flammable mixture is ignited in an optically accessible vessel, attempting to produce a post-combustion high pressure and high temperature environment. The flammable mixture usually consists of Hydrogen and a Hydrocarbon. Hydrogen is added, {{to assist with the}} ignitability of the pre-ignition mixture and to simulate the water present in industrial combustors as a result of exhaust gas recirculation. To this direction, the mole ratio of Hydrogen to Hydrocarbon and the mixture molecular weight were introduced as independent variables {{for the first time in}} the literature of constant volume combustion. An initial computer model, assuming perfect combustion, was used for calculation of adiabatic temperature and pressure. A second computer model investigated the effect of chemical dissociation by solving for the minimization of Gibbs energy and was compared to the former one. To verify the calculations, a dual pressure transducer technique and a High-Speed Schlieren technique were used to validate the combustion conditions inside the vessel To further understand the atomization, evaporation and mixing phenomena in sprays, a Diesel spray was visualized using back-illumination and Schlieren High-Speed cinematography at high pressure and room temperature. To understand the evaporation behaviour of a spray and map the vapour fuel distribution, a tracer Laser Induced Fluorescence was applied on a Dodecane/Methyl-naphthalene spray under evaporating and non-evaporating conditions. To compare the experimental findings to the theoretical models in literature, the evaporation of a single droplet in post-combustion vessel gases was simulated using a purpose-programmed FORTRAN code. A supercritical phase change was suggested to explain the sudden phase change and large differences between the theoretical model and the experimental results. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|The diluted {{combustion}} (called also flameless oxidation) {{has been}} already applied in furnaces technology {{to get high}} process thermal efficiency with low NOx emissions. The principle {{of this type of}} combustion consists in providing a high level of dilution of the reactants with flue gases before combustion reaction occurs, to get a slower reaction in a much larger volume than in classical combustion. The resulting lower local heat release leads to a more homogeneous temperature field in the furnace, without peak values responsible of high thermal NOx formation. There are two requirements for working in diluted combustion: the dilution level of reactants by the flue gases has to be high enough and the temperature level in the combustion chamber has to be above a threshold (the auto-ignition temperature of the mixture). The aim of this work is to assess the technical feasibility and highlight the specific problems of application of diluted combustion in a medium scale boiler. The main difficulty is due to the high geometrical confinement and heat losses of a typical boiler combustion chamber. That prevents from getting the minimum level of reactants dilution and temperature needed to reach diluted combustion regime. The idea is to use a natural gas jet-burner (to <b>preheat</b> the combustion <b>chamber)</b> along with a secondary gas injector {{in order to get a}} high entrainment of the flue gases by the reactant jets. In fact the air (through the jet-burner) and the gas (through the secondary gas injector) are injected separately in order to get a high dilution of the reactants and a mixture temperature above the auto-ignition threshold. Our test bench consists in a Viessmann hot water boiler whose nominal output power is 370 kW. The combustion chamber of this boiler is cylindrical (length = 1. 41 m, diameter = 0. 56 m) and is water-cooled. A preliminary CFD study (Fluent ®) has first been performed to select on the market a jet burner and to determine the position of the air and gas injectors able to generate the requirements of diluted combustion. The influence of the operating conditions (firing rate and excess air) has also been studied numerically. The simulation results show the possibility to obtain a temperature field quite homogenous (typical of diluted combustion) but with a light increase of the CO level at the exit of the combustion chamber. These numerical results (obtained with a simple combustion model) have to be validated experimentally. A first experimental study has been carried out in classical combustion on the boiler equipped with the selected jet-burner. The temperature field has been measured in the median plane of the combustion chamber for different excess air and firing rate. These measurements allowed us to verify that the preheating obtained with the jet-burner was important enough for getting a temperature level above the auto-ignition temperature near everywhere in the combustion chamber. A second experimental study in diluted combustion on the combustion chamber equipped with the secondary gas injector will allow the validation the corresponding numerical results.
