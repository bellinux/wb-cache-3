However, the decision was not too popular with local fans and quickly fell into disuse, and was reverted to Estádio dos Barreiros. On 15 May 1977, a record crowd of 22,000 <b>people</b> <b>squeezed</b> into the stadium to see Marítimo gain promotion to the Primeira Liga for the first time.

Whatever the truth of its claim, the pub is certainly diminutive so that {{no more than ten}} or fifteen customers can drink inside at any one time. The pub measures 4.57 x 2.13 m.

5000|$|The {{staple food}} is plain rice with a curry of fish or meat. Normally people start with fried or steamed {{vegetable}} and dal, {{a kind of}} lentil soup. Often <b>people</b> <b>squeeze</b> a citron slice or take additional salt while eating and add fresh shallots and green pepper as seasoning. Traditional snacks and savouries include seasonal pitha of various kinds, dal-puri, and shingara. Home made desserts include Khyr, Payesh and Shemai. Sweets soaked in syrup of sugar, such as Jilapi, are mostly bought from shops. Pan, a digestive made out of betel nuts, spices, tobacco, and certain other ingredients are eaten by many people, some of which consume it with aromatic Dzorda. For dinner or lunch, a simple formula is to prepare [...] "khichuri", the broth of rice and lentils, seasoned with spices, and served with chutney or pickles. Ghee (butter) may be spread just before eating. The meal may end with sweet curd. Muri (puffed rice), chira (flattened rice) and khoi (popped rice) are substitutes for rice.

St Albans City, Clapton and Hounslow Town were beaten and Ilford were the opponents for the quarter-final at East London sides Newbury Park ground. 5,000 Wycombe fans travelled in torrential rain, and the pitch was a quagmire but the game went on. They watched a see-saw game that ended in a 3-3 draw and the replay a week later at Loakes Park saw 15,500 <b>people</b> <b>squeeze</b> in to see the home side win 2-0. The semi-final was played at Highbury, scene of the club's 1931 triumph and opponents Corinthian Casuals contributed fully to an incredible tussle, which enraptured the 28,197 crowd. Norman Kerruish gave Casuals a first-minute lead, but Paul Bates header home an equaliser just three minutes later. He gave the Blues the lead on 20 minutes but Jack Laybourne made it 2-2 on the half hour. Wycombe Captain Frank Westley hobbled off on the hour and were soon down to nine men when Frank Smith dislocated his shoulder. Goalkeeper Dennis Syrett then injured himself when he collided with a post. Westley returned to play on the wing, and his incredible strength and determination helped galvanise the team. With twenty minutes to go Paul Bates crossed for Len Worley to head home. With five minutes left Worley was put in on goal and he fired home to give the Wanderers a magnificent 4-2 win.|$|R

60|$|Again I {{see this}} obtuseness to {{courtesy}} towards strangers. Our despised church has become popular, {{and so many}} of the young folks choose to accompany us that they overflowed into the free seats in the aisle, where I had a full view of them from above. These benches are long, and I was sorry to see the girls planting themselves fast at the outer end, and making themselves square, so as to hinder any one else from getting in, till the verger came and spoke to them, when Charley giggled offensively; and even then they did not make room, but forced the <b>people</b> to <b>squeeze</b> past.

60|$|It {{was within}} a week of the close of the month of July, that a hackney cabriolet, number unrecorded, was seen to proceed at a rapid pace up Goswell Street; three <b>people</b> were <b>squeezed</b> into it besides the driver, who sat in his own {{particular}} little dickey at the side; over the apron were hung two shawls, belonging to two small vixenish-looking ladies under the apron; between whom, compressed into a very small compass, was stowed away, a gentleman of heavy and subdued demeanour, who, whenever he ventured to make an observation, was snapped up short by one of the vixenish ladies before-mentioned. Lastly, the two vixenish ladies and the heavy gentleman were giving the driver contradictory directions, all tending to the one point, that he should stop at Mrs. Bardell's door; which the heavy gentleman, in direct opposition to, and defiance of, the vixenish ladies, contended was a green door and not a yellow one.|$|R

5000|$|Breathing is {{important}} in the Pilates method. In Return to Life, Pilates devotes a section of his introduction specifically to breathing [...] "bodily house-cleaning with blood circulation". He saw considerable value in increasing the intake of oxygen and the circulation of this oxygenated blood to every part of the body. This he saw as cleansing and invigorating. Proper full inhalation and complete exhalation were key to this. He advised <b>people</b> to <b>squeeze</b> out the lungs as they would wring a wet towel dry. In Pilates exercises, the practitioner breathes out with the effort and in on the return. In order to keep the lower abdominals close to the spine; the breathing needs to be directed laterally, into the lower rib cage. Pilates breathing is described as a posterior lateral breathing, meaning that the practitioner is instructed to breathe deep into the back and sides of his or her rib cage. When practitioners exhale, they are instructed to note the engagement of their deep abdominal and pelvic floor muscles and maintain this engagement as they inhale. Pilates attempts to properly coordinate this breathing practice with movement.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how increasing longevity affects the housing choices of working age and retired people using a heterogeneous agent overlapping generations model that incorporates owner-occupier and rental sectors, credit constraints, detailed tax regulations, and a housing supply sector.

50|$|The cinema {{was used}} as the setting for a number of stunts in the British sketch show, Trigger Happy TV. Filming was {{facilitated}} by the cinema having a balcony from which aerial shots could be taken, and the apparent willingness of the management to subject their patrons to some hilarious (and ultimately harmless) pranks. Various sketches involved the show's presenter, Dom Joly, along with extras from the show, annoying cinema-goers by dressing up as severely obese <b>people</b> trying to <b>squeeze</b> past whilst spilling popcorn from massively oversized buckets, sitting in front of them with enormous fake wigs, and dressing up as Beefeaters taking up whole rows of seats. Other more bizarre incidents involved the use of animal costumes.

5000|$|The {{concept was}} first {{articulated}} in a 1972 article The dignity {{of risk and}} the mentally retarded by Robert Perske:Overprotection may appear on the surface to be kind, {{but it can be}} really evil. An oversupply can smother <b>people</b> emotionally, <b>squeeze</b> the life out of their hopes and expectations, and strip them of their dignity. Overprotection can keep people from becoming all they could become. Many of our best achievements came the hard way: We took risks, fell flat, suffered, picked ourselves up, and tried again. Sometimes we made it and sometimes we did not. Even so, we were given the chance to try. Persons with special needs need these chances, too. Of course, we are talking about prudent risks. People should not be expected to blindly face challenges that, without a doubt, will explode in their faces. Knowing which chances are prudent and which are not - this is a new skill that needs to be acquired. On the other hand, a risk is really only when it is not known beforehand whether a person can succeed. The real world is not always safe, secure, and predictable, it does not always say “please,” “excuse me”, or “I’m sorry”. Every day we face the possibility of being thrown into situations where we will have to risk everything … In the past, we found clever ways to build avoidance of risk into the lives of persons living with disabilities. Now we must work equally hard to help find the proper amount of risk these {{people have the right to}} take. We have learned that there can be healthy development in risk taking and there can be crippling indignity in safety! ...|$|R

It had taken some courage to tackle a group this large of mixed friends and strangers and it didn’t help that a few people openly avoided me as soon as they saw my Servox and heard the buzz. Realizing that they probably thought they wouldn’t be able to understand me, I plowed ahead with my socializing, determined to be as much like my old self as possible. This was a brunch with a marvelous buffet, and they had huge bowls of fruit salad, a wonderful egg casserole, sausages and ham, biscuits and gravy, jellies and jams, coffee cakes, and just for you Yankees, cheese grits! Carrying a very generous helping, I took a table for 6 that was just emptying, and, shortly thereafter, watched a group of 4 head for the same table and then stop.
