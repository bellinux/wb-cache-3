40|$|Purpose: Development of a reliable, {{simple method}} to monitor lung {{condition}} in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients. Lung functionality assessment in CF patients is relevant, {{as most of}} them still die of respiratory failure. In lung mucus (sputum) of CF patients, components such as proteins, biopolymers, DNA, bacteria, and mucin are pathologically increased. As lung functionality {{is related to the}} amount of the <b>pathological</b> <b>components</b> in the sputum, their determination can help clinicians in monitoring lung condition and planning therapy. Methods: Low-field NMR was used to evaluate the variation of the relaxation time (T 2 m) of the water hydrogens present in CF sputum in relation to the amounts of the <b>pathological</b> <b>components.</b> Low-field NMR was tested in artificial samples (mucin or alginates), then in conditional sputum (saliva from healthy volunteers, added by different amounts of the <b>pathological</b> <b>components),</b> and finally in 12 patients’ sputums, in which T 2 m was correlated to a commonly used lung monitoring test (i. e., forced expiratory volume in the first second). Results: T 2 m significantly (P< 0. 05) differed between samples with and without <b>pathological</b> <b>components</b> and between healthy and CF patients (P < 0. 05), in which T 2 m correlated (r 1 ⁄ 4 0. 87) with FEV 1. Conclusions: The presented method can potentially become a valuable lung-monitoring tool in CF patients...|$|E

40|$|The {{increase}} of long surviving cystic fibrosis (CF) patients needs great effort {{for the assessment}} of lung functionality/inflammation since the majority of them still die of respiratory failure. The commonly used test (forced expiratory volume in the first second (FEV 1), evaluation of inflammatory markers such as blood neutrophil counts (BNC) and acute-phase reactants such as C-reactive protein (CRP)) can be complex in their execution (FEV 1) or expensive (BNC, CRP). Thus, in consideration of the intense monitoring required in CF patients, more effective, low cost and simple strategies are urgently necessary. As it is well known [1, 2] that the sputum of patients affected by CF or other obstructive pulmonary diseases contain pathological concentrations of proteins, alginates, DNA, bacteria and mucin, it is conceivable that these components can affect the magnetic relaxation of the water hydrogens entrapped in the sputum as it occurs in aqueous polymeric solutions and gels [3]. As the illness severity is connected to the concentration of these components, Low field NMR could represent a profitable tool to evaluate lung functionality/inflammation. Indeed, measuring the average sputum spin-spin relaxation time T 2 m of both artificial sputum samples (water added by different amounts of the <b>pathological</b> <b>components),</b> and conditional sputum (healthy volunteers saliva, added by different amounts of the <b>pathological</b> <b>components),</b> we found that T 2 m is greatly affected by the presence of <b>pathological</b> <b>components</b> when their concentration ranges from normal up to pathological concentrations. In addition, we found a good statistical correlation between T 2 m - FEV 1, T 2 m - CRP and T 2 m -BNC. Figure 1 shows the decrease of T 2 m relative to a CF patient in comparison with healthy subjects and patients affected by less severe lung pathological conditions, i. e. asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). In conclusion, we can affirm that Low field NMR has the potential to become a valuable, fast and economic monitoring tool for pulmonary diseases in CF patients, as well as in other chronic pulmonary diseases...|$|E

40|$|Parkinson’s {{disease is}} a multifactorial {{neurodegenerative}} disorder, the aetiology of which remains elusive. The primary clinical feature of progressively impaired motor control {{is caused by a}} loss of midbrain substantia nigra dopamine neurons that have a high α-synuclein (α-syn) and iron content. α-Syn is a neuronal protein that is highly modified post-translationally and central to the Lewy body neuropathology of the disease.

Furthermore, we propose a concept in which acetylation and phosphorylation of α-syn modulate endocytic import of iron and vesicle transport of dopamine during normal physiology. Disregulated phosphorylation and oxidation of α-syn mediate iron and dopamine dependent oxidative stress through impaired cellular location and increase propensity for α-syn aggregation.

40|$|SummaryAberrant cell-cycle {{activity}} and DNA damage are emerging as important <b>pathological</b> <b>components</b> in various neurodegenerative conditions. However, their underlying mechanisms are poorly understood. Here, {{we show that}} deregulation of histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC 1) activity by p 25 /Cdk 5 induces aberrant cell-cycle {{activity and}} double-strand DNA breaks leading to neurotoxicity. In a transgenic model for neurodegeneration, p 25 /Cdk 5 activity elicited cell-cycle activity and double-strand DNA breaks that preceded neuronal death. Inhibition of HDAC 1 activity by p 25 /Cdk 5 was identified as an underlying mechanism for these events, and HDAC 1 gain of function provided potent protection against DNA damage and neurotoxicity in cultured neurons and an in vivo model for ischemia.

Whereas S 1 P 1 receptor is expressed on endothelial cells and lymphocytes within lung tissue, S 1 P 1 agonism suppresses cytokines and innate immune cell recruitment in wild-type and lymphocyte-deficient mice, identifying endothelial cells as central regulators of cytokine storm. Furthermore, our data reveal immune cell infiltration and cytokine production as distinct events that are both orchestrated by endothelial cells. Moreover, we demonstrate that suppression of early innate immune responses through S 1 P 1 signaling results in reduced mortality during infection with a human pathogenic strain of influenza virus.

Objectives We investigated the role of MMPs and inflammatory cytokines in the lung by quantifying levels and determining relationships with the key <b>pathological</b> <b>components</b> of COPD in patients and healthy controls. Methods We analysed levels of MMPs and inflammatory cytokines in bronchoalveolar lavage from 24 COPD and 8 control subjects. Each subject underwent spirometry and high-resolution CT. Image analysis quantitatively assessed emphysema, bronchial wall thickening and small airways disease. Results Multiple MMPs (MMP- 1, - 2, - 3, - 8, - 9 and - 10) and cytokines (interleukin (IL) 6 and IL- 8) were elevated in lungs of subjects with COPD.

In this report, the newly developed diffusion basis spectrum imaging was used to discriminate and quantify the underlying <b>pathological</b> <b>components</b> in multiple sclerosis white matter.

40|$|A {{hallmark}} of Alzheimer's disease is accumulation of amyloid beta (Aβ) deposits, which {{are associated with}} neuronal dysfunction, spine loss, and impaired Ca 2 + homeostasis. Amyloid beta (Aβ) binds to and is aggregated by Zn 2 +, a metal released from synaptic glutamatergic vesicles during neuronal activity. Synaptically released Zn 2 + activates a metabotropic Gq-coupled Zn 2 + -sensing receptor, mZnR/GPR 39, and induces Ca 2 + -signaling in post-synaptic neurons. We examined if Aβ, as a Zn 2 + binding protein, regulates neuronal Zn 2 + -signaling mediated by mZnR/GPR 39 using SHSY- 5 Y cells and cortical neurons from GPR 39 wild-type and knockout mice. Following acute or chronic treatment with Aβ neuronal Zn 2 + -dependent Ca 2 + release via mZnR/GPR 39 is significantly reduced. This impairment is overcome when excess Zn 2 + is applied, suggesting that impaired Ca 2 + -signaling results from Aβ binding of Zn 2 +. The Zn 2 + -dependent mZnR/GPR 39 activation triggers phosphorylation of extracellular regulated kinase and up-regulates expression of the chaperone protein clusterin (Clu). Importantly, neuronal Zn 2 + -dependent extracellular regulated kinase 1 / 2 phosphorylation and up-regulation of Clu are attenuated by silencing mZnR/GPR 39 {{as well as by}} Aβ treatment. In contrast, Zn 2 + -dependent AKT phosphorylation is not mediated by mZnR/GPR 39 and is not attenuated by Aβ treatment. Thus, Zn 2 + signaling via mZnR/GPR 39 is distinctively disrupted by a critical <b>pathological</b> <b>component</b> of Alzheimer's disease. Synaptically released Zn 2 + activates a Zn 2 + -sensing receptor, mZnR/GPR 39, and induces Ca 2 + -signaling, followed by ERK 1 / 2 MAPK activation and up-regulation of clusterin. Amyloid beta (Aβ) binds to Zn 2 + thus forming oligomers that are a {{hallmark of}} Alzheimer's disease.

Objective: The goal {{of the present study}} was therefore to gain insights into the role of NF-B pathway specifically in mouse cardiomyocytes by conditional deletion of the NF-B essential modulator (NEMO). Methods and Results: Using a Cre/loxP system, we disrupted the Nemo gene in a cardiomyocyte-specific manner in the heart, which simulated gene expression changes underlying human heart failure and caused adult-onset dilated cardiomyopathy accompanied by inflammation and apoptosis. Pressure overload challenges of NEMO-deficient young hearts precociously induced the functional decrements that develop spontaneously in older knockout animals.

Investigating the relatively simple neural circuit of the laryngeal adductor reflex (LAR) in mice may help elucidate the underlying pathology contributing to dysphagia in neurological diseases.

A 2. 0 Hz electrical stimulus was directly applied to the superior laryngeal nerve (SLN) at various intensities to evoke the LAR. LBR waveforms were extracted from background EEG using traditional signal averaging. Several positive and negative peaks were detected within 10 ms after SLN stimulation. Quantification of response peaks relative to amplitude and latency will provide normative data for comparison with mouse models of human diseases. The neurological components recruited during LAR are also recruited during swallowing; however, the swallow reflex is more complex and involves additional brain regions.

At the same time, E 3330 remarkably decreased the accumulation of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) and down-regulated the productions of monocyte chemoattractant protein- 1 (MCP- 1) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), as well as attenuated the level of nuclear factor-κB (NF-κB) p 65 in RPEs. A panel of stress and toxicity responsive transcription factors that were significantly upregulated by oxLDL was restored by E 3330, including Nrf 2 /Nrf 1, p 53, NF-κB, HIF 1, CBF/NF-Y/YY 1, and MTF- 1. Further, a single intravitreal injection of E 3330 effectively reduced the progression of laser-induced choroidal neovascularization (CNV) in mouse eyes. These data revealed that E 3330 effectively rescued RPEs from oxidative stress induced senescence and dysfunctions in multiple aspects in vitro, and attenuated laser-induced damages to RPE–Bruch׳s membrane complex in vivo. Together with its previously established anti-angiogenic and neuroprotection benefits, E 3330 is implicated for potential use for AMD treatment...|$|E
40|$|This {{bachelor}} {{deals with}} the possibilities {{of the use of}} physiotherapy at patients with amputation of the leg. The loss of the lower limb has a major influence on change in postural stability. Despite the prosthetic equipment patient has impaired proprioception, which is reflected to the pathological walk with compensatory mechanism. We are trying to return a person to normal life with minimal disabilities using specific physiotherapy methods with adequate training and stability. In the theoretical part there is a summary description of amputation and its influence on postural stability, further I deal with protetics options, where I am closely describing the use of functional and posturograf tests. In the end I deal with physiotherapeutics prosthetic equipment and methods applied in practice. The aim of the practical part is to assess the changes in postural stability {{with the use of the}} instruments with a biological feedback and to map out the qualitative and quantitative parameters of walking of patients with lower limb amputations. For the practical part have been selected qualitative research, which includes case reports of two patients with transfemoral amputations and one transtibial of the lower limb. Both input and output examination includes a complete analysis of kinesiologic, functional tests with posturography examination of postural stability. Each patient attended 10 individual therapies to increase the stability. The results were compared between input and output of tests. All patient's postural stability has been positively affected with a slight improvement in posture. Despite the regular therapy we didn't suceed to change the <b>pathological</b> <b>components.</b> This state can be caused by the prothesis, which was by all patients described as unsatisfing. Bachelor thesis may be used by students of physiotherapy for extension of their knowledge, or they can apply the knowledge during their practice. It can also be used as educational material for patients who are interested in the issue...|$|E
40|$|Neocortical lesions (NLs) are an {{important}} <b>pathological</b> <b>component</b> of multiple sclerosis (MS), but their visualization by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) remains challenging. We aimed at assessing the sensitivity of multi echo gradient echo (ME-GRE) T 2 *-weighted MRI at 7. 0 Tesla in depicting NLs compared to myelin and iron staining. Samples from two MS patients were imaged post mortem using a whole body 7 T MRI scanner with a 24 -channel receive-only array. Isotropic 200 micron resolution images with varying T 2 * weighting were reconstructed from the ME-GRE data and converted into R 2 * maps. Immunohistochemical staining for myelin (proteolipid protein, PLP) and diaminobenzidine-enhanced Turnbull blue staining for iron were performed. Prospective and retrospective sensitivities of MRI {{for the detection of}} NLs were 48 % and 67 % respectively. We observed MRI maps detecting {{only a small portion of}} 20 subpial NLs extending over large cortical areas on PLP stainings. No MRI signal changes suggestive of iron accumulation in NLs were observed. Conversely, R 2 * maps indicated iron loss in NLs, which was confirmed by histological quantification. High-resolution post mortem imaging using R 2 * and magnitude maps permits detection of focal NLs. However, disclosing extensive subpial demyelination with MRI remains challenging...|$|R
40|$|Inflammation {{has been}} {{increasingly}} {{recognized as an}} important <b>pathological</b> <b>component</b> of heart failure. Existing methods of assessing myocardial infiltrate are labor-intensive and provide data {{that are difficult to}} quantify and not representative of the whole heart. As a result, little effort has been made to systematically assess the components of myocardial inflammation. We established an alternative method of quantitative assessment of myocardial inflammation by flow cytometry after enzymatic digestion of hearts to characterize the infiltrate and study the association between inflammation and cardiac function in murine experimental autoimmune myocarditis. The severity of acute myocarditis uniquely correlated with the proportion of neutrophils, but not T cells, B cells, or macrophages. Both acute and chronic phases were characterized by the presence of CD 44 high (activated) T cells in the heart, whereas T cells trafficking through normal hearts exhibited CD 44 low phenotype. During the chronic phase, the proportion of CD 4 + T cells was associated with increased left-ventricular volumes and deterioration of systolic function, the hallmarks of dilated cardiomyopathy. We conclude that flow cytometry on uniformly digested mouse hearts provides sensitive and reproducible assessment of myocardial infiltrate and can be used to dissect out the specific role of individual immune components from the overall inflammatory response in the heart...|$|R
40|$|Background/Aims: The {{enhanced}} {{proliferation of}} pulmonary arterial smooth muscle cells (PASMCs) {{is a central}} <b>pathological</b> <b>component</b> in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH). Both the Warburg effect and platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF) {{are involved in the}} proliferation of PASMCs. However, the mechanism underlying the crosstalk between the Warburg effect and PDGF during PASMC proliferation is still unknown. We hypothesized that PDGF promotes the Warburg effect via activating the phosphatidylinositol 3 -kinase (PI 3 K) signaling pathway and hypoxia-inducible factor 1 -α (HIF- 1 α) in proliferative PASMCs. Methods: PASMCs were derived from pulmonary arteries of SD rats; cell viability, the presence of metabolites, and metabolic enzyme activities assay were determined by MTT assays, kit assays and western blot analysis, respectively. Results: PDGF promoted PASMC proliferation in a dose- and time-dependent manner, accompanied by an enhanced Warburg effect. Treatment with PDGFR antagonists, Warburg effect inhibitor and PDK 1 inhibitor significantly inhibited PI 3 K signaling activation, HIF- 1 α expression and PASMC proliferation induced by PDGF, respectively. Furthermore, treatment with PI 3 K signaling pathway inhibitors remarkably suppressed PDGF-induced PASMC proliferation and the Warburg effect. Conclusion: microplate reader (Biotek, Winooski The Warburg effect plays a critical role in PDGF-induced PASMC proliferation and is mediated by activation of the PI 3 K signaling pathway and HIF- 1 α...|$|R
