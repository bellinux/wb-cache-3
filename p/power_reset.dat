50|$|The {{appearance}} of the Atari Flashback 2 {{is reminiscent of the}} original Atari 2600 console from 1977. It is roughly two-thirds the size of the original and is much lighter in weight. The Flashback 2 console has five buttons (<b>power,</b> <b>reset,</b> left and right difficulty toggles, and select); on the back it has a color/black-and-white slider switch and two ports for the included joysticks. The joysticks bear very close similarity to the original Atari 2600 joysticks from 1977, and are compatible and interchangeable with them. The Flashback 2 does not come with paddle controllers, but original paddle controllers can be connected to it and used with its paddle-based games.|$|E
5000|$|The {{satellite}} was theorized to lose {{attitude control}} when its reaction wheels became saturated. When this event occurred, it {{would prevent the}} spacecraft's solar panels from tracking the sun, and it would shut down. After the <b>power</b> <b>reset</b> event, further attempts would be made to recover control of the satellite.This event was originally predicted for late August or early September 2010, then Intelsat revised its estimate to sometime between 28 November and 29 December 2010. After subsequent criticism of the actual science behind Orbital Sciences' predictions Intelsat completely abandoned the published timeline method. Instead for a period Intelsat stated Based on the revised analysis, the estimated window for a Galaxy 15 off-point and loss of power could occur {{as early as this}} month without clarifying the month indicated. The hypothesis used to calculate the timeline of any potential occurrence of loss of power was imprecise, due to the fact the satellite has experiencederratic loading conditions of radio frequency signals since it began to drift. Six months after the initial failure date published timelines for shut down proved to be more hopes of a public relations campaign based in theory, and in an interview conducted in October 2010 during the Satcon Conference, both Intelsat & Orbital admitted that the hoped timeline scenario was, in theory and this has been an unprecedented situation, and we are learning as we go.|$|E
5000|$|After {{their home}} is {{attacked}} by civilians, Alana takes Max to meet Hayes and hear his proposal. Hayes offers Max a base, weapons and funding for his cause, but Max refuses, believing the funding {{should be spent}} helping those in need. After leaving Hayes, Max is attacked by the villains Tumult, Safeword and Charlie Hustle. When Max begins to win, Safeword uses her power to force Max to stop, and they flee. When Max recovers, Bellamy agrees to fund the repair of the city if Max can bring him one honest man to run it. Alana accepts for Max. Max later wonders if Bellamy knows why the villains did not finish {{him while he was}} incapacitated. [...] Max recruits Armadale to help him find Mike Whelan, a former federal prosecutor to become the city manager. Meanwhile, Charlie, Safeword and Tumult are revealed to be working for Hayes. They are attending a gathering of several supervillains planning to cause chaos. Alana, having discovered a secret about Hayes, is subdued with gas. Max finds Mike, but he refuses to help, revealing that Max killed his son. [...] The supervillains begin causing death and destruction around Coalville. Max holds Mike hostage while he attempts to convince Mike to take the job. Alana is captured by the villains who attempt to sexually assault her. Safeword uses her power to make them all stop and frees Alana, having been a fan of her since she was a child. While Max is still attempting to convince Mike, Charlie Hustle attacks him, ripping out Mike's heart. Charlie then uses a gas-bomb on Max to make him fall asleep, using knowledge unintentionally provided by Alana. [...] Max is taken to Hayes, who takes advantage of Max's <b>power</b> <b>reset</b> to repeatedly shoot him, put him to sleep and then start again. Armadale, having been sober for years, falls back on alcohol after learning that Max killed Mike's child. Hayes continues to torture Max, claiming he will use him to cause destruction to continue his own plans. Jailbait suddenly attacks, killing Hayes and his men before freeing Max. Jailbait then leaves.|$|E
30|$|The {{different}} bipolar reset {{transitions in}} terms of an Ni/SiN/Si RRAM device were investigated in this study depending on the <b>reset</b> <b>power</b> and the resistance value of the LRS, which is determined by the forming and set processes. The sharp reset switching was observed for the high <b>reset</b> <b>power</b> (> 7  mW) and the low LRS, whereas the step-by-step reset switching was observed for the low <b>reset</b> <b>power</b> (< 7  mW) and the high LRS. Higher nonlinear I-V characteristics and a gradual reset change regarding the step-by-step reset switching would be two of the most virtuous merits of the low-power and high-density crossbar array.|$|R

40|$|The mono-stereo {{controller}} using {{audio mute}} clock is {{used at the}} International Broadcasting Bureau (IBB) FM 106. 6 MHz transmitter in Ulaan Baatar, Mongolia since 2010. The major problem of the FM broadcast station was from the frozen Programmable Logic Controller, PLC, which must be manually reset and the report by the VOA listeners. Then, the PLC auto <b>power</b> <b>reset</b> circuit is proposed and built in mono-stereo controller to monitor {{the operation of the}} PLC. The circuit is also used to restart the PLC whenever, it is frozen. The cloud router and Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) to Recommended Standard number 232 (RS- 232) converter are used to synchronize the PLC time. From the results, this circuit can improve the transmitter availability and quality of the 24 hours/day broadcast program without affection to the listeners. The reliability of the cloud router is acceptable with low delay of data transfer via the internet connection between Thailand to Mongolia. The cloud router which the IBB leases cloud service from the provider that offers high speed internet up to 1000 Mb/s, via the remote terminal is used for the schedule program and the time synchronization of the PLC correctly. The proposed system is very stable and there is no problem of the frozen PLC whether it connects to the internet or not. Hence, the designed PLC auto <b>power</b> <b>reset</b> circuit can be used to eliminate the frozen PLC problem...|$|E
40|$|The {{security}} of digital Integrated Circuits (ICs) {{is essential to}} the {{security of}} a computer system that comprises them. We present an improved attack on computer hardware that avoids known defence mechanisms and as such raises awareness for the need of new and improved defence mechanisms. We also present a new defence method for securing computer hardware against modifications from untrusted manufacturing facilities, which is of concern since manufacturing is increasingly outsourced. We improve upon time triggered based backdoors, inserted maliciously in hardware. Prior work has addressed deterministic timer-based triggers — those that are designed to trigger at a specific time with probability 1. We address open questions related to the feasibility of realizing non-deterministic timer-based triggers in hardware — those that are designed with a random component. We show that such timers can be realized in hardware {{in a manner that is}} impractical to detect or disable using existing countermeasures of which we are aware. We discuss our design, implementation and analysis of such a timer. We show that the attacker can have surprisingly fine-grained control over the time-window within which the timer triggers. From the attacker’s standpoint our non-deterministic timer has key advantages over traditional timer designs. For example the hardware footprint is smaller which increases the chances of avoiding detection. Also our timer has a much smaller time-window for which a volatile state needs to be maintained which in turn makes the <b>power</b> <b>reset</b> defence mechanisms less effective. Our proposed defence mechanism addresses the threat of a malicious agent at the IC foundry who has information of the circuit and inserts covert, malicious circuitry. The use of 3 D IC technology has been suggested as a possible technique to counter this threat. However, to our knowledge, there is no prior work on how such technology can be used effectively. We propose a way to use 3 D IC technology for security in this context. Specifically, we obfuscate the circuit by lifting wires to a trusted tier, which is fabricated separately. We provide a precise notion of security that we call k-security and point out that it has interesting similarities and important differences from k-anonymity. We also give a precise specification of the underlying computational problems and their complexity and discuss a comprehensive empirical assessment with benchmark circuits that highlight the security versus cost trade-offs introduced by 3 D IC based circuit obfuscation. 1 yea...|$|E
