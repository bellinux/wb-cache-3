5|$|Synthetic gem-quality diamond {{crystals}} {{were first}} produced in 1970 by GE, then reported in 1971. The first successes used a pyrophyllite tube seeded {{at each end}} with thin pieces of diamond. The graphite feed material {{was placed in the}} center and the metal solvent (nickel) between the graphite and the seeds. The container was heated and the pressure was raised to about 5.5GPa. The crystals grow as they flow from the center {{to the ends of the}} tube, and extending the length of the process produces larger crystals. Initially, a week-long growth process produced gem-quality stones of around 5mm (1 carat or 0.2 g), and the <b>process</b> <b>conditions</b> had to be as stable as possible. The graphite feed was soon replaced by diamond grit because that allowed much better control of the shape of the final crystal.|$|E

The factors of process parameters selection are analyzed, <b>process</b> <b>condition</b> vector and <b>process</b> parameter vector are defined, and their quantitative expressions are proposed. The mapping of existing <b>process</b> <b>condition</b> vectors to the process parameter vectors is established, based on the process data accumulated in practical production. Then, <b>process</b> <b>condition</b> matching degree is defined. In the calculation of the matching degree, Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) is adopted to determine the affecting weights of <b>process</b> <b>condition</b> factors, and leveling matrix is adopted to eliminate the differences of dimensions and numerical scales between <b>process</b> <b>condition</b> factors. The optimal process parameters are achieved through matching the actual <b>process</b> <b>condition</b> to the existing <b>process</b> <b>condition.</b> A group of typical aero-engine part milling processes is taken as instance, and the feasibility and effectiveness of this method are verified.

25|$|The overall {{conversion}} of NH3 and CO2 to urea is exothermic, the reaction {{heat from the}} first reaction driving the second. Like all chemical equilibria, these reactions behave according to Le Chatelier's principle, and the conditions that most favour carbamate formation have an unfavourable effect on the urea conversion equilibrium. The <b>process</b> <b>conditions</b> are, therefore, a compromise: the ill-effect on the first reaction of the high temperature (around 190°C) needed for the second is compensated for by conducting the process under high pressure (140–175 bar), which favours the first reaction. Although {{it is necessary to}} compress gaseous carbon dioxide to this pressure, the ammonia is available from the ammonia plant in liquid form, which can be pumped into the system much more economically. To allow the slow urea formation reaction time to reach equilibrium a large reaction space is needed, so the synthesis reactor in a large urea plant tends to be a massive pressure vessel.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: We {{construct}} {{the law of}} Lévy <b>processes</b> <b>conditioned</b> to stay positive under general hypotheses. We obtain a Williams type path decomposition at the minimum of these processes. This result is then applied to prove the weak convergence {{of the law of}} Lévy <b>processes</b> <b>conditioned</b> to stay positive as their initial state tends to 0. We describe an absolute continuity relationship between the limit law and the measure of the excursions away from 0 of the underlying Lévy process reflected at its minimum. Then, when the Lévy process creeps upwards, we study the lower tail at 0 of the law of the height this excursion.

40|$|Niosome, a novel drug {{delivery}} system was proposed to encapsulate Labisia pumila (LP) and Ficus deltoidea (FD) extract {{in order to enhance}} their absorption through skin. However, niosomes preparation involves several parameters such as formulation and <b>process</b> <b>condition</b> which affect the niosomes production. Thus the aim {{of this study is to}} obtain the optimum formulation and <b>process</b> <b>condition</b> for encapsulation of niosomes loaded LP and FD extract. Niosomes loaded with both extracts were prepared by coacervation phase separation method and further downsized with high pressure homogenizer, Design of experiment (DOE) was employed to ease this research. Mixture design experiment (14 batches) was applied to obtain the optimum formulation while Central Composite Design (11 batches) was applied to obtain optimum <b>process</b> <b>condition.</b> The factors involved in formulation were amount of Span 60, cholesterol and Labrasol while the parameters that affect the <b>process</b> <b>condition</b> were homogenization cycle and pressure. Their corresponding responses for both designs were the same, which were entrapment efficiency (EE), particle size (PS) and zeta potential (ZP). From the study, the optimum formulation obtained consists of 0. 6 mmol of Span 60, 0. 4 of mmol cholesterol and 0. 1 mmol of Labrasol. Meanwhile, the optimum <b>process</b> <b>condition</b> for both LP and FD niosomes is 1100 bar of pressure and 6 cycles.

We obtain the exact asymptotic behavior of the survival probability. As {{in the case of}} BPREs, there is a phase transition in the subcritical regime due to different survival opportunities. In addition, we characterize the <b>process</b> <b>conditioned</b> to never go extinct and establish a backbone construction. In the strongly subcritical regime, mean offspring numbers are increased but still subcritical in the <b>process</b> <b>conditioned</b> to never go extinct.
