50|$|Partitive <b>plural</b> is a <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> {{that is used}} {{to modify}} a noun which {{represents}} a part of some whole amount, as opposed to the comprehensive plural, used when the noun represents the total amount of something. This plural form is used in the Finnish language, and its use in this language influenced J.R.R. Tolkien in inventing his fictional language Quenya. It refers to more than one object that is nevertheless only part of a larger number; for example, three out of four of something. It is one of four <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers</b> in Quenya, the others being singular, dual, and plural.|$|R
5000|$|In general, nouns, {{adjectives}} and determiners inflect only {{according to}} grammatical gender (masculine or feminine) and <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> (singular or <b>plural).</b> <b>Grammatical</b> case is marked only on pronouns, as in English; case marking, as in English, {{is of the}} nominative-accusative type (rather than e.g. the ergative-absolutive marking of Basque or the split ergativity of Hindi). A significant exception, however, is Romanian, with two-case marking (nominative/accusative vs. genitive/dative) on nominal elements.|$|R
50|$|In the Russian language, {{the system}} of {{grammatical}} declension is elaborate and complex. Nouns, pronouns, adjectives, demonstratives, most numerals and other particles are declined for two <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers</b> (singular and <b>plural),</b> three <b>grammatical</b> genders (masculine, feminine and neuter) and six grammatical cases (see below). This gives dozens of spelling combinations {{for most of the}} words, which is needed for grammatical agreement within and (often) outside the proposition. Also, there are several paradigms for each declension with numerous irregular forms.|$|R

50|$|Proto-Uralic nouns are reconstructed with {{at least}} six noun cases and three numbers, singular, dual and <b>plural.</b> <b>Grammatical</b> gender was not {{recognized}} and no Uralic language does so even today. Noun articles were unknown.|$|R
50|$|In 1874, {{the college}} {{is given to}} the care of the Trois-Rivières diocese. The latter makes it then its own diocese seminary and bestows upon it the {{denomination}} of Séminaire Saint-Joseph des Trois-Rivières. The old tradition of calling the city les Trois-Rivières (<b>plural</b> <b>grammatical</b> inflection) now being obsolete, Séminaire Saint-Joseph de Trois-Rivières is now the proper way to call the institution.|$|R
50|$|Dutch verbs {{conjugate}} for tense {{in present}} and past, and for mood in indicative, subjunctive and imperative. The subjunctive mood in Dutch is archaic or formal, and is rarely used. There are two <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers</b> (singular and <b>plural)</b> and three <b>grammatical</b> persons. However, many forms are identical to others, so the conjugation doesn't have distinct forms for all possible combinations {{of these factors}} (that is, there is considerable syncretism). In particular, there is always just one form for the plural, and only in the present indicative is there a clear distinction among the different singular persons.|$|R
50|$|Nouns, pronouns, {{adjectives}} and determiners {{were fully}} inflected with five grammatical cases (nominative, accusative, genitive, dative, and instrumental), two <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers</b> (singular and <b>plural)</b> and three <b>grammatical</b> genders (masculine, feminine, and neuter). First- and second-person personal pronouns also had dual forms for referring {{to groups of}} two people, {{in addition to the}} usual singular and plural forms.The instrumental case was somewhat rare and occurred only in the masculine and neuter singular. It was often replaced by the dative. Adjectives, pronouns and (sometimes) participles agreed with their antecedent nouns in case, number and gender. Finite verbs agreed with their subject in person and number.|$|R

First- and second-person personal pronouns also had dual forms for referring {{to groups of}} two people, {{in addition to the}} usual singular and plural forms.The instrumental case was somewhat rare and occurred mostly in the masculine singular, but also sometimes in the neuter singular. It never occurred in the feminine nor plural. Instrumental could typically be replaced by the dative. Adjectives, pronouns and (sometimes) participles agreed with their antecedent nouns in case, number and gender. Finite verbs agreed with their subject in person and number.|$|R
5000|$|Slovene has {{singular}} and plural {{but also}} has the rare dual <b>grammatical</b> <b>number,</b> a separate form of every noun used when {{there are only two}} such items (except for natural pairs, such as trousers, eyes, for which the plural is used). Dual <b>grammatical</b> <b>number,</b> when an ambiguity between dual and plural forms exists, can be rendered into other languages in various ways; comparatively often, there is no ambiguity, and the dual is extraneous. (This explains the relatively early disappearance of the dual in most languages). Dual <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> was a feature of the Proto-Slavic language which has been retained by Slovene. An example of dual <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> would be [...] "onadva sta" [...] ("The two are"), which refers to two objects or subjects in the masculine gender or [...] "onidve sta" [...] ("The two are"), which refers to the same concept but in the feminine gender. However [...] "oni so" [...] ("They are [...] ") refers to more than two objects or subjects in the masculine gender while [...] "one so" [...] ("They are") does the same the feminine gender. Dual <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> is also preserved in gender. The dual is used consistently in Slovene.|$|R

50|$|All {{languages}} {{are able to}} specify the quantity of referents. They may do so by lexical means with words such as English a few, some, one, two, five hundred. However, not every language has a <b>grammatical</b> category of <b>number.</b> <b>Grammatical</b> <b>number</b> is expressed by morphological or syntactic means. That is, it is indicated by certain grammatical elements, such as through affixes or <b>number</b> words. <b>Grammatical</b> <b>number</b> may {{be thought of as}} the indication of semantic number through grammar.|$|R
5000|$|Personal pronouns are pronouns {{that are}} {{associated}} primarily with a particular grammatical person - first person (as I), second person (as you), or third person (as he, she, it, they). Personal pronouns may also take different forms depending on number (usually singular or <b>plural),</b> <b>grammatical</b> or natural gender, case, and formality. The term [...] "personal" [...] is used here purely to signify the grammatical sense; personal pronouns {{are not limited to}} people and can also refer to animals and objects (as the English personal pronoun it usually does).|$|R

50|$|Linguists {{distinguish}} between {{two kinds of}} universals: absolute (opposite: statistical, often called tendencies) and implicational (opposite non-implicational). Absolute universals apply to every known language and are quite few in number; an example is All languages have pronouns. An implicational universal applies to languages with a particular feature that is always accompanied by another feature, such as If a language has trial <b>grammatical</b> <b>number,</b> it also has dual <b>grammatical</b> <b>number,</b> while non-implicational universals just state the existence (or non-existence) of one particular feature.|$|R

50|$|In many languages, {{there is}} also a dual number (used for {{indicating}} two objects). Some other <b>grammatical</b> <b>numbers</b> present in various languages include trial (for three objects) and paucal (for an imprecise but small number of objects). In languages with dual, trial, or paucal numbers, plural refers to numbers higher than those. However, numbers besides singular, plural, and (to a lesser extent) dual are extremely rare. Languages with numerical classifiers such as Chinese and Japanese lack any significant <b>grammatical</b> <b>number</b> at all, though they are likely to have plural personal pronouns.|$|R
