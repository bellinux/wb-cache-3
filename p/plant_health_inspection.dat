LarsonVeterinary Services, {{a branch}} of Animal <b>Plant</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Inspections</b> Services, has the {{responsibility}} to protect our nation’s animals and animal products through disease control and eradication programs, surveillance and monitoring. During {{the course of my}} experience working with Veterinary Services, I learned about program diseases and the different ways veterinary medical field officers and epidemiologists work together to control, monitor and survey these diseases. Veterinary Services has been working to eliminate bovine tuberculosis in the United States since the early 1900 ’s. The Bovine Tuberculosis Eradication Program has been largely successful but tuberculosis keeps resurfacing in pockets around the U. S. leading to the conclusion that there must be a wildlife reservoir. Mycobacterium bovis is the cause of bovine tuberculosis and is considered a zoonotic pathogen. M. bovis has been reported to infect a wide range of host species including cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, cats, dogs, bison, badgers, possums, antelopes, elephants, seals, and humans(1). Through my experiences working with Veterinary Services, I was able to learn about the bovine tuberculosis eradication program and to explore different avenues in which M. bovis could be transmitted to humans.

25|$|In 1981, Brown, who had {{established}} {{a reputation as a}} strong environmentalist, was confronted with a serious medfly infestation in the San Francisco Bay Area. He was advised by the state's agricultural industry, and the US Department of Agriculture's Animal and <b>Plant</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Inspection</b> service (APHIS), to authorize airborne spraying of the region. Initially, in accordance with his environmental protection stance, he chose to authorize ground-level spraying only. Unfortunately, the infestation spread as the medfly reproductive cycle out-paced the spraying. After more than a month, millions of dollars of crops had been destroyed and billions of dollars more were threatened. Governor Brown then authorized a massive response to the infestation. Fleets of helicopters sprayed malathion at night, and the California National Guard set up highway checkpoints and collected many tons of local fruit; in the final stage of the campaign, entomologists released millions of sterile male medflies in an attempt to disrupt the insects' reproductive cycle.|$|E

500|$|Soring is the {{practice}} of applying irritants or blistering agents to the front feet or forelegs of a horse, making it pick its feet up higher in an exaggerated manner that creates the movement or [...] "action" [...] desired in the show ring. Soring {{is an act of}} animal cruelty that gives practitioners an unfair advantage over other competitors. The Horse Protection Act is enforced by the Animal and <b>Plant</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Inspection</b> Service (APHIS), a branch of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Although violations of the law are seen most often in the Tennessee Walking Horse industry, the Horse Protection Act covers all breeds.|$|E
500|$|The showing, {{exhibition}} {{and sale of}} Tennessee Walking Horses and some other horse breeds is governed by the Horse Protection Act of 1970 (HPA) due to concerns about the practice of soring, which developed during the 1950s and became widespread in the 1960s, resulting in a public outcry. Congress passed the Horse Protection Act in 1970, declaring the practice [...] "cruel and inhumane". The Act prohibits anyone from entering a sored horse into a show, sale, auction or exhibition, and prohibits drivers from transporting sored horses to a sale or show. Congress delegated statutory responsibility for enforcement to the management of sales and horse shows, but placed administration of the act with the Animal and <b>Plant</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Inspection</b> Service (APHIS) of the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA). Violations of the HPA may result in criminal charges, fines and prison sentences. The USDA certifies certain Horse Industry Organizations (HIOs) to train and license Designated Qualified Persons (DQPs) to complete inspections. APHIS inspection teams, which include inspectors, investigators, and veterinary medical officers, also conduct unannounced inspections of some horse shows, and {{have the authority to}} revoke the license of a DQP who does not follow the standards of the Act.|$|E
500|$|As {{originally}} enacted, the Horse Protection Act was to {{be enforced}} by Animal and <b>Plant</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Inspection</b> Service (APHIS), {{a branch of the}} USDA. However, a lack of staff and funding meant little success, leading to the 1976 amendment to the act. With this amendment, Congress created a Designated Qualified Person (DQP) program. This program allows non-USDA employees from within the equine community to take training and certification programs run by Horse Industry Organizations (HIOs) and supervised by the USDA; after completing the training, they may complete inspections for violations of the HPA at public events. The USDA is then able to double check the work of DQP participants by making random inspections at a small number of shows. One member of the Tennessee Walking Horse world states that this creates [...] "the potential for a [...] "fox guarding the chicken coop" [...] situation", as if the HIO is not fully interested in preventing or detecting the practice of soring, the DQPs may not be fully trained or may deliberately overlook instances of soring. When APHIS inspectors are present at horse shows, the number of citations for violations increases significantly. Competitors and trainers at shows, viewing themselves as unjustly persecuted, have been known to leave when they find APHIS inspectors present, rather than allowing the inspectors to see their horses. In June 2012, the USDA published a new rule requiring violations found by HIOs to have penalties assessed at a rate equal to or exceeding those given by APHIS inspectors. Previously, HIOs were allowed to set their own penalty rates, resulting in some organizations acting leniently towards violators of the HPA.|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this masters project is to {{estimate}} the social net value of a non-lethal, wolf-depredation management strategy in central Idaho. The strategy was developed by Defenders of Wildlife to reduce sheep depredation by gray wolves (Canis lupus). Defenders of Wildlife worked with three of the largest sheep producers in Idaho between 2008 and 2010 to demonstrate and test the effectiveness of non-lethal predation-management tools in central Idaho. While the Defenders project is preventative in nature, the status quo project is reactive [...] Wildlife Services, a division of USDA Animal <b>Plant</b> and <b>Health</b> <b>Inspection</b> Service (APHIS), responds to depredation events using mainly lethal strategies of control. Using a cost-benefit analysis model, this study calculates the incremental net value of the Defenders of Wildlife demonstration project. A benefit transfer is used to derive the non-market value of wolves. By including this estimate in the analysis, {{the results show that}} using non-lethal, preventative tools can yield greater benefits to society than the reactive status quo program.

500|$|The Yellowstone Park bison herd is {{the largest}} public herd of American bison in the United States. The {{relatively}} large bison populations are a concern for ranchers, who fear that the species can transmit bovine diseases to their domesticated cousins. In fact, about half of Yellowstone's bison {{have been exposed to}} brucellosis, a bacterial disease that came to North America with European cattle that may cause cattle to miscarry. The disease has little effect on park bison, and no reported case of transmission from wild bison to domestic livestock has been filed. However, the Animal and <b>Plant</b> <b>Health</b> <b>Inspection</b> Service (APHIS) has stated that bison are the [...] "likely source" [...] of the spread of the disease in cattle in Wyoming and North Dakota. Elk also carry the disease and are believed to have transmitted the infection to horses and cattle. Bison once numbered between 30 and 60 million individuals throughout North America, and Yellowstone remains one of their last strongholds. Their populations had increased from less than 50 in the park in 1902 to 4,000 by 2003. The Yellowstone Park bison herd reached a peak in 2005 with 4,900 animals. Despite a summer estimated population of 4,700 in 2007, the number dropped to 3,000 in 2008 after a harsh winter and controversial brucellosis management sending hundreds to slaughter. The Yellowstone Park bison herd is believed to be one of only four free roaming and genetically pure herds on public lands in North America. The other three herds are the Henry Mountains bison herd of Utah, at Wind Cave National Park in South Dakota and in Elk Island National Park in Alberta.|$|E
