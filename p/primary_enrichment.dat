40|$|Anaerobic {{degradation}} of monochlorophenols and monochlorobenzoates {{in a variety}} of aquatic sediments was compared under four enrichment conditions. A broader range of compounds was degraded in enrichments inoculated with sediment exposed to industrial effluents. Degradation of chloroaromatic compounds was observed most often in methanogenic enrichments and in enrichments amended with 1 mM bromoethane sulfonic acid. Degradation was observed least often in enrichments with added nitrate or sulfate. The presence of 10 mM bromoethane sulfonic acid prevented or inhibited {{degradation of}} most compounds tested. <b>Primary</b> <b>enrichments</b> in which KNO 3 was periodically replenished to maintain enrichment characteristics degraded chlorobenzoates, but not chlorophenols. In contrast, <b>primary</b> <b>enrichments</b> in which Na 2 SO 4 was periodically replenished failed to degrade any chloroaromatic compounds. Upon transfer to fresh medium, none of the sulfate enrichments required the presence of Na 2 SO 4 for degradation, while only two nitrate enrichments required the presence of KNO 3 for degradation. As a class of compounds, chlorophenols were degraded more readily than chlorobenzoates. However, as individual compounds 3 -chlorobenzoate, 2 -chlorophenol, and 3 -chlorophenol degradation was observed most often and with an equal frequency. Within the chlorophenol class, the relative order of degradability was ortho > meta > para, while that of chlorobenzoates was meta > ortho > para, In laboratory transfers, 2 -chlorobenzoate, 3 -chlorobenzoate, and 2 -chlorophenol degradation was most easily maintained, while degradation of para-chlorinated compounds was very difficult to maintain...|$|R

A total of 234 samples were examined (77 animal nasal swabs, 112 retail raw meat, and 45 deli meat). The multiplex real-time PCR targeted the genes: nuc (identification of S. aureus), mecA (associated with methicillin resistance) and PVL (virulence factor), and the <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>enrichment</b> samples were assessed. The conventional culture/PCR method included the two-step selective enrichment, selective plating, biochemical testing, and multiplex PCR for confirmation. The conventional culture/PCR method recovered 95 / 234 positive S. aureus samples. Application of real-time PCR on samples following <b>primary</b> and secondary <b>enrichment</b> detected S. aureus in 111 / 234 and 120 / 234 samples respectively.

40|$|Isolation {{rates for}} Listeria monocytogenes {{and the other}} Listeria spp. {{typically}} improve when samples are enriched {{in more than one}} <b>primary</b> <b>enrichment</b> medium. This study evaluated the abilities of two <b>primary</b> <b>enrichment</b> media, University of Vermont-modified Listeria enrichment broth (UVM) and Listeria repair broth (LRB), to recover different ribotypes of Listeria spp. from raw meat and poultry samples. Forty-five paired 25 -g retail samples of ground beef, pork sausage, ground turkey, and chicken (160 samples) underwent <b>primary</b> <b>enrichment</b> in UVM and LRB (30 degrees C for 24 h) followed by secondary enrichment in Fraser broth (35 degrees C for 24 and 40 h) and plating on modified Oxford agar. After 24 h of incubation of 35 degrees C, 608 Listeria colonies from selected positive samples were biochemically confirmed as L. monocytogenes (245 isolates), L innocua (276 isolates), and L. welshimeri (89 isolates) and then ribotyped with the automated Riboprinter microbial characterization system (E. I. du Pont de Nemours & Co., Inc.). Thirty-six different Listeria strains comprising 16 L. monocytogenes (including four known clinical ribotypes), 12 L. innocua, and 8 L. welshimeri ribotypes were identified from selected positive samples (15 samples of each product type; two UVM and two LRB isolates per sample). Twenty-six of 36 (13 L. monocytogenes) ribotypes were detected with both UVM and LRB, whereas 3 of 36 (1 L. monocytogenes) and 7 of 36 (3 L. monocytogenes) Listeria ribotypes were observed with only UVM or LRB, respectively. Ground beef, pork sausage, ground turkey, and chicken yielded 22 (8 L. monocytogenes), 21 (12 L. monocytogenes), 20 (9 L. monocytogenes), and 19 (11 L. monocytogenes) different Listeria ribotypes, respectively, with some Listeria ribotypes confined to a particular product. More importantly, major differences in both the number and distribution of Listeria ribotypes, including previously recognized clinical and nonclinical ribotypes of L. monocytogenes, were observed when 10 UVM and 10 LRB isolates from five samples of each product were ribotyped. When a third set of six samples per product type was examined from which two Listeria isolates were obtained by using only one of the two <b>primary</b> <b>enrichment</b> media, UVM and LRB failed to detect L. monocytogenes (both clinical and nonclinical ribotypes) in two and four samples, respectively.

40|$|Since the {{outbreak}} of foodborne illness linked to Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 bacteria in ground beef in the early 1980 s, the beef processing industry has focused on increasing the safety of beef products by implementing procedures for surveying live cattle, carcasses, and beef products for bacterial pathogens. Effective methods are in place for screening cattle and beef products {{for the presence of}} E. coli O 157 :H 7 contamination, and recent work has established the acceptability of these methods for surveillance of Salmonella. In keeping with the need to continually improve the food safety of beef products, new work investigating pathogen prevalence now includes surveillance for Listeria monocytogenes. Tryptic soy broth (TSB) has been documented as a robust nonselective medium for the enrichment of both E. coli and Salmonella from bovine hide, carcass, and meat samples. The University of Vermont modification medium is most often used as the <b>primary</b> <b>enrichment</b> medium for surveillance of Listeria spp. In this study, samples from bovine hides (n 50), preevisceration carcasses (n 50), and beef trim (n 193) were used to evaluate TSB as a <b>primary</b> <b>enrichment</b> medium for the isolation of Listeria spp., including L. monocytogenes. No significant difference (P 0. 05) between TSB and the University of Vermont modification medium was observed when all three sample types underwent <b>primary</b> <b>enrichment</b> for the isolation of Listeria spp. Furthermore, the standard secondary enrichment ratio for Fraser broth used for Listeria recovery can be modified to accommodate a high-throughput method for processing multiple samples...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Birds can harbor human pathogens, {{including}} L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii {{and transmit}} {{then to the}} humans. Due to many people's interests to keep pigeons, present {{study was conducted to}} determine the occurrence of L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii from pigeon faeces in Yazd. Materials and Methods: In the present study, 150 samples of bird faeces were collected with sterile cotton swabs from different areas of the city of Yazd, Iran. Swabs were placed directly into Listeria enrichment broth. One ml of <b>primary</b> <b>enrichments</b> was transferred to 9 ml of Frazer broth. Secondly enrichments were streaked on Palcam agar. Then, they were evaluated for detection of L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii by PCR method. Results: Although overall prevalence of Listeria species was 2 % (3 out of 150), no L. monocytogenes and no L. ivanovii were found in our study. Discussion and Conclusion: The sources of Listeria spp. in birds are the foods they eat and the environments they live. Since nutritions, living environments, and hygiene level of pigeons are better than those of the wild birds, L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii were not found in any samples. The present result is suggesting that pigeons are not the source or the carrier of L. monocytogenes and L. ivanovii in the region...|$|R
40|$|Mixed {{cultures}} of anaerobic bacteria capable of reductively dechlorinating freshly spiked 1, 2, 3, 4 -tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin (1, 2, 3, 4 -TeCDD) {{were obtained from}} freshwater sediments of streams near Bitterfeld, Germany. All of these sediments have been impacted by industrial wastewater for decades, but have comparably low levels of polychlorinated dibenzo-p-dioxins and-furans (PCDD and PCDF), not exceeding 500 ng toxicity equivalents (I-TEQ) per kg dry weight. Reductive dechlorination of 1, 2, 3, 4 -TeCDD in the <b>primary</b> <b>enrichments</b> as well as dechlorination of trichlorinated dioxin congeners in subsequent transfers showed that dioxin-dechlorinating bacteria could be enriched from these low-level contaminated sites. The amount of two transformation products, 1, 3 - and 2, 3 -di-chlorodibenzo-p-dioxin was different in the studied cultures, demonstrating preferential substitution of chlorine in either peri- or lateral positions of the molecule. Ten different dioxin-dechlorinating cultures were analyzed with a 16 S rDNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) approach to detect phylotypes of bacteria known {{to be able to}} reductively dechlorinate several halogenated aliphatic and aryl compounds. Using this qualitative approach, we could not assign a specific dechlorination pathway to {{the presence or absence of}} specific dehalogenating organisms. However, it was shown that members of Desulfito-bacterium and Dehalococcoides were present in all communities studied, including cultures from Spittelwasser sediments (Bunge et al., 2001), and might be involved in reductive dehalogenation of chlorinated dioxins...|$|R
40|$|Microbial {{communities}} in coastal subsurface sediments are scarcely investigated and have escaped attention so far. But {{since they are}} likely {{to play an important role}} in biogeochemical cycles, knowledge of their composition and ecological adaptations is important. Microbial {{communities in}} tidal sediments were investigated along the geochemical gradients from the surface down to a depth of 5. 5 m. Most-probable-number (MPN) series were prepared with a variety of different carbon substrates, each at a low concentration, in combination with different electron acceptors such as iron and manganese oxides. These achieved remarkably high cultivation efficiencies (up to 23 % of the total cell counts) along the upper 200 cm. In the deeper sediment layers, MPN counts dropped significantly. Parallel to the liquid enrichment cultures in the MPN series, gradient cultures with embedded sediment subcores were prepared as an additional enrichment approach. In total, 112 pure cultures were isolated; they could be grouped into 53 different operational taxonomic units (OTU). The isolates belonged to the Proteobacteria, "Bacteroidetes," "Fusobacteria," Actinobacteria, and "Firmicutes. " Each cultivation approach yielded a specific set of isolates that in general were restricted to this single isolation procedure. Analysis of the enrichment cultures by PCR and denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis revealed an even higher diversity in the <b>primary</b> <b>enrichments</b> that was only partially reflected by the culture collection.

The samples were collected from four stations throughout the Kor River in four seasons. Amount of total mercury in the samples was determined using cold vapor atomic absorption spectrophotometery. The response of bacterial communities to toxic effects of Hg was monitored by enumerating the number of bacteria on agar containing 10 mg L - 1 HgCl 2 and with out Hg (II). Isolation of mercury resistant bacteria was performed using the <b>primary</b> <b>enrichment</b> culture method and directly plating on agar containing 10 mg L - 1 HgCl 2 Hg (II).

40|$|Aims: To {{evaluate}} {{the suitability of}} a multiplex PCR-based assay for sensitive and rapid detection of Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 in soil and water. Methods and Results: Soil and water samples were spiked with E. coli O 157 :H 7 and subjected to two stages of enrichment prior to multiplex PCR. Detection sensitivities were as high as 1 cfu ml– 1 drinking water and 2 cfu g– 1 soil. Starvation of E. coli O 157 :H 7 for 35 d prior to addition to soil {{did not affect the}} ability of the assay to detect initial cell numbers as low as 10 cfu g– 1 soil. Use of an 8 -h <b>primary</b> <b>enrichment</b> enabled detection of as few as 6 cfu g– 1 soil, and 104 cfu g– 1 soil with a 6 -h <b>primary</b> <b>enrichment.</b> When soil was inoculated with 105 cfu g– 1, the PCR assay indicated persistence of E. coli O 157 :H 7 during a 35 d incubation. However, when soil was inoculated with lower numbers of pathogen, PCR amplification signals indicated survival to be dependent on cell concentration. Conclusions: A multiplex PCR-based assay, in combination with an enrichment strategy enabled sensitive and rapid detection of E. coli O 157 :H 7 in soil and water. Significance and Impact of the Study: The ability to sensitively detect E. coli O 157 :H 7 in environmental material within one working day represents a considerable advancement over alternative more time-consuming methods for detection of this pathogen...|$|E

40|$|The {{microbial}} populations {{responsible for}} anaerobic degradation of phthalate isomers were investigated by enrichment and isolation of those microbes from anaerobic sludge treating wastewater from the manufacturing of terephthalic acid. <b>Primary</b> <b>enrichments</b> {{were made with}} each of three phthalate isomers (ortho-, iso-, and terephthalate) as the sole energy source at 37 °C with two sources of anaerobic sludge (both {{had been used to}} treat wastewater containing high concentrations of phthalate isomers) as the inoculum. Six methanogenic enrichment cultures were obtained which not only degraded the isomer used for the enrichment but also had the potential to degrade part of other phthalate isomers as well as benzoate with concomitant production of methane, presumably involving strictly syntrophic substrate degradation. Our 16 S rRNA gene-cloning analysis combined with fluorescence in situ hybridization revealed that the predominant bacteria in the enrichment cultures were affiliated with a recently recognized non-sulfate-reducing subcluster (subcluster Ih) in the group ‘Desulfotomaculum lineage I' or a clone cluster (group TA) in the class delta-Proteobacteria. Several attempts were made to isolate these microbes, resulting in the isolation of a terephthalate-degrading bacterium, designated strain JT, in pure culture. A coculture of the strain with the hydrogenotrophic methanogen Methanospirillum hungatei converted terephthalate to acetate and methane within 3 months of incubation, whereas strain JT could not degrade terephthalate in pure culture. During the degradation of terephthalate, a small amount of benzoate was transiently accumulated as an intermediate, indicative of decarboxylation of terephthalate to benzoate as the initial step of the degradation. 16 S rRNA gene sequence analysis revealed that the strain was a member of subcluster Ih of the group ‘Desulfotomaculum lineage I', but it was only distantly related to other known species...|$|R

40|$|Soil is {{a highly}} {{heterogeneous}} matrix, which can contain thousands of different bacterial species per gram. Only a small component of this diversity (maybe < 1 %) is commonly captured using standard isolation techniques, although indications are that {{a larger proportion of}} the soil community is in fact culturable. Better isolation techniques yielding greater bacterial diversity would be of benefit for understanding the metabolic activity and capability of many soil microorganisms. We studied the response of soil bacterial communities to carbon source enrichment in small matrices by means of terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (TRFLP) analysis. The community composition of replicate enrichments from soil displayed high variability, likely attributable to soil heterogeneity. An analysis of TRFLP data indicated that enrichment on structurally similar carbon sources selected for similar bacterial communities. The same analysis indicated that communities first enriched on glucose or benzoate and subsequently transferred into medium containing an alternate carbon source retained a distinct community signature induced by the carbon source used in the <b>primary</b> <b>enrichment.</b> Enrichment on leucine presented a selective challenge that was able to override the imprint left by <b>primary</b> <b>enrichment</b> on acetate. In a time series experiment community change was most rapid 18 hours after inoculation, corresponding to exponential growth. Community composition did not stabilize even 4 days after secondary enrichment. Four different soil types were enriched on four different carbon sources. TRFLP analysis indicated that in three out of four cases communities enriched on the same carbon source were more similar regardless of which soil type was used. Conversely, the garden soil samples yielded similar enrichment communities regardless of the enrichment carbon source. Our results indicate that in order to maximize the diversity of bacteria recovered from the environment, multiple enrichments should be performed using a chemically diverse set of carbon sources...|$|E

40|$|The genus Gallionella is {{characterized}} by a beanshaped bacterial cell which elongates during growth and then divides in typical bacterial fashion (Cholodny, 1924, 1926), but which pos-sesses the unusual ability of secreting a twisted, lifeless stalk that gives a strong Prussian blue reaction with ferrocyanide, indicating the presence of ferric ions. The organisms are found in nature under conditions where water with ferrous ion content is exposed to sufficient oxygen to satisfy growth requirements. These properties have con-tributed to the classification of the gallionella as true iron bacteria, especially since the precipita-tion of iron takes place in a morphologically defined form (Pringsheim, 1949). For almost 50 years {{attempts have been made to}} cultivate these organisms, but in the light of present knowledge it is doubtful if they have ever been obtained in pure culture. An enrich-ment method developed by Lieske (1911) em-ployed a liquid medium containing the following compounds (values in g/ 100 ml) : KCl, 0. 05; MgSO 4, 0. 005; K 2 HPO 4, 0. 005; (NH 4) 2 SO 4, 0. 15. Iron filings or iron wire were added to this me-dium. Best growth was obtained when flasks containing a shallow layer of the medium were incubated at 4 to 10 C in an atmosphere contain-ing 1 per cent CO 2. Unfortunately Lieske never observed the actual cells of the organism and saw only the fragmented stalks. Cholodny (1924) succeeded in getting gallionella to grow attached to glass coverslips which he suspended in iron-bearing waters and discovered the true morphol-ogy of the cell and stalk.

Anammox activity was tested and detected in two of the three wastewater treatment works after 90  days of <b>primary</b> <b>enrichment.</b> The activity was confirmed by consumption of both NH 4 + and NO 2 − in the system. The presence of anammox bacteria was also confirmed by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of the 16 s rRNA of the anammox using anammox-specific primers. All clones retrieved were closely related to Brocadia species and were most abundant in all habitats tested. The maximum growth rate of anammox was also estimated on both experiments using a relatively new model...|$|E
40|$|The {{major and}} trace element {{geochemistry}} {{of the early}} to middle Proterozoic meta-igneous rocks of the Willyama Complex in the Broken Hill Block indicates that the basic rocks originated by partial melting of a depleted mantle source, followed by fractional crystallization along a trend of strong iron enrichment coupled with some crustal assimilation. At {{least some of the}} intermediate-acid rocks were derived from fractionation of these basic parents, but major crustal involvement may be necessary to explain the large quantities of felsic volcanics in {{the lower part of the}} Complex. The volcanic rocks in the Broken Hill mine area show an unusually high degree of <b>primary</b> iron <b>enrichment</b> (up to 25 wt % total iron as Fe 2 O 3) and a lesser degree of bimodality than elsewhere. By analogy with Recent ferrobasalt provinces, this extreme iron enrichment may indicate an origin in a propagating rift where small, high-level magma chambers separated from the magma source. If so, the consequent high geothermal gradient and high fracture permeability may have provided the necessary conditions for genesis of the Broken Hill ore deposit...|$|R
40|$|Fe isotope {{compositions}} of {{bulk samples}} from Gaosong ore deposit in Gejiu district, SW China were investigated and an overall variation in δ^ 56 Fe values from − 0. 33 ‰ to + 0. 20 ‰ has been observed. In this study, the δ^ 56 Fe values of primary sulfide ores {{are lower than}} the oxidized ores, while the iron isotope compositions of gossan samples, which represent highest oxidation degree, are heavier than the oxidized ore samples. These data indicate that iron isotopes experienced fractionation during supergene weathering process, furthermore, heavier iron isotopes enriched in more oxidized products. Another highlight is the Fe isotope compositions that are affected by mineralogy, which is considered as the primary mechanism of the large Fe isotopic variations in the <b>primary</b> ores. <b>Enrichment</b> of light iron isotopes in primary sulfide ores suggests that iron isotopes fractionated during fluid exsolution from its parental magma and the Fe source of skarn ores is mainly the magmatic source. This observation that significant Fe isotope fractionation occurs in supergene weathering process and fluid exsolution process provides an example in using Fe isotopes to trace supergene geochemical cycling and ore deposit formation/evolution processes...|$|R
40|$|Identification and {{characterization}} of cancer-initiating cells (CICs) enriched for stem cell-like functions {{and the establishment}} of a link between CICs and tumor recurrence, chemotherapy resistance and radiation resistance, and metastasis have been the focus of cancer research for the last eight years. Although this field has its share of controversies, it is becoming apparent that cells isolated from recurrent or residual tumors or both are enriched for cancer cells that have a specific phenotype compared with heterogeneous cells in the <b>primary</b> tumor. <b>Enrichment</b> of CICs in tumors subjected to radiation therapy could be {{due in part to the}} delivery of sublethal doses of treatment and the efficient radical scavenging system within CICs. Sublethal doses of radiation are sufficient to induce senescence of non-CICs while forcing CICs to gain several new properties related to cell cycle progression in addition to maintaining or enhancing stem cell characteristics of pre-treatment CICs. Characterizing pathways responsible for the increase in CICs after therapy and exploiting the unique characteristics of therapy-resistant CICs for developing targeted therapies are becoming a central focus of research in the rapidly evolving field of CICs...|$|R
40|$|Enrichment {{cultures}} of rumen bacteria degraded oxalate within 3 to 7 {{days in a}} medium containing 10 % rumen fluid and an initial level of 45 mM sodium oxalate. This capability was maintained in serially transferred cultures. One mole of methane was produced per 3. 8 mol of oxalate degraded. Molecular hydrogen and formate inhibited oxalate degradation but not methanogenesis; benzyl viologen and chloroform inhibited both oxalate degradation and methanogenesis. Attempts to isolate oxalate-degrading bacteria from these cultures were not successful. Oxalate degradation was uncoupled from methane production when enrichments were grown in continuous culture at dilution rates {{greater than or equal}} to 0. 078 h- 1. Growth of the uncoupled population (lacking methanogens) in batch culture was accompanied by degradation of 45 mM oxalate within 24 h and production of 0. 93 mol of formate per mol of oxalate degraded. Oxalate degradation by the uncoupled population was not inhibited by molecular hydrogen or formate. Cell yields (grams [dry weight]) per mole of oxalate degraded by the <b>primary</b> <b>enrichment</b> and the uncoupled populations were 1. 7 and 1. 0, respectively...|$|E
40|$|Forty-eight {{combinations}} of enrichment media, secondary enrichment, incubation times and temperatures, and atmospheres were examined for their efficacy in recovering different serovars of Salmonella {{that had been}} inoculated into ground-meat extract. Variations included three selective-enrichment media, two (37 and 43 degrees C) incubation temperatures, two (24 and 48 h) incubation times, two (aerobic and anaerobic) incubation atmospheres, and secondary enrichment {{to two of the}} selective-enrichment media. The ratio of Salmonella to other microorganisms was 10 : greater than 1, 000, 000. One-hundred and twenty-four tests were conducted for each enrichment under each condition of incubation. None of the methods recovered Salmonella in more than 60 % of the trials. Salmonella typhimurium was recovered most frequently of the serovars tested; S. abortusovis was recovered least frequently. There was considerable variation in the results obtained by the different methods, but there was a statistically significant advantage in the 43 degrees C incubation temperature. Secondary enrichment in tetrathionate broth showed a statistically significant advantage over secondary enrichment in selenite broth. Secondary enrichment into a different medium from the <b>primary</b> <b>enrichment</b> also was advantageous...|$|E
40|$|The {{impacts of}} 12 common food {{industry}} stresses on the single-cell growth probability and single-cell lag time distribution of Listeria monocytogenes were determined in half Fraser broth, the <b>primary</b> <b>enrichment</b> broth of the International Organization for Standardization detection method. First, {{it was determined}} that the ability of a cell to multiply in half Fraser broth is conditioned by its history (the probability for a cell to multiply can be decreased to 0. 05), meaning that, depending on the stress in question, the risk of false-negative samples can be very high. Second, it was established that when cells are injured, the single-cell lag times increase in mean and in variability and that this increase represents a true risk of not reaching the detection threshold of the method in the enrichment broth. No relationship was observed between the impact on single-cell lag times and that on growth probabilities. These results emphasize the importance of taking into account the physiological state of the cells when evaluating the performance of methods to detect pathogens in food...|$|E

40|$|As {{a source}} of {{strategic}} commodities for high technologies, the deposits of rare earth elements (REEs) in China are a world-class phenomenon. The combination of the world’s largest accumulation of REEs in the Bayan Obo deposit and the low cost of mining the extremely valuable heavy REEs from residual deposits makes China almost a monopoly producer. Research {{on a range of}} Chinese deposits shows that not only hypogene but also secondary processes create economic REE deposits. These deposits have characteristic REE distribution patterns, which range from <b>primary</b> light REE <b>enrichment</b> in carbonatites from the Himalayan Mianning–Dechang orogenic belt and in metamorphosed carbonatite and polyphase mineralization at Bayan Obo, through unusual flat REE patterns in carbonatites from the Qinling orogenic belt, to strong secondary heavy REE enrichment in residual clays from southern China...|$|R
40|$|A <b>primary,</b> nonselective, ambient-temperature <b>enrichment</b> {{procedure}} for isolation of Salmonella spp. is described. The procedure {{was superior to}} elevated-temperature selective enrichment for Salmonella when estuarine water samples were examined. Five Chesapeake Bay stations were monitored, over an 8 -month period, {{for the presence of}} salmonellae. Of 72 water and sediment samples collected, 17 (23. 6 %) yielded Salmonella spp. Seven serotypes were identified among the isolates. A seasonal pattern was noted for the incidence of the salmonellae. A most probable number procedure, performed by membrane filtration and nonselective enrichment, yielded Salmonella most probable number indices as high as 110 per 100 g of sediment. The results suggest that new methods, such as the one described in this report, are required for isolation of human intestinal pathogens from estuaries and coastal waters...|$|R
