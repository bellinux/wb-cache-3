40|$|An {{elutriator}} for {{the separation}} of cysts from not previously dried soil samples to determine the population density of Heterodera species is described. With this apparatus a mixture of cysts and organic debris is obtained. For further separation this mixture is dried and the cysts are then separated from the debris <b>by</b> <b>flotation</b> with a modification of Buhr's method using water or a mixture of three parts of acetone and one part of carbon tetrachloride. Heterodera cysts differ from practically all other material, found in soil, in that they float for a fairly long time in water after having been dried thoroughly (Fenwick, 1940). In Fenwick's extraction method the soil samples are dried prior to extraction. Cysts are then separated from soil in three steps: first the cysts are concentrated in {{a small amount of}} mainly organic material <b>by</b> <b>flotation</b> in-water, then they are separated from most of this material again <b>by</b> <b>flotation</b> in water and finally they are picked from between the soil particles which float as well in water as dry cysts.

40|$|Abstract {{approved}} (Major professor) Since {{the development}} of the activated sludge process in 1913 many {{attempts have been made to}} improve it. One approach has been to increase the oxygen available to the bio-mass. This study com-bined the use of elevated pressure and high-shear mixing to increase the oxygen transfer. The conventional method of separating activated sludge has been flocculation followed by sedimentation. High-shear mixing breaks up the bio-mass thus hindering flocculation. Flotation, a method of solid-liquid separation used in industrial processes, could utilize the dissolved air released when the elevated pressure is released. A laboratory-scale, activated sludge treatment unit was operated at various combinations of pressure and mixing. The solid-liquid separation characteristics of the mixed liquor were studied. Separa-tion by settling was investigated when the unit was operated at atmos-pheric pressure and separation <b>by</b> <b>flotation</b> was investigated when the unit was operated at an elevated pressure of 30 psig. It was concluded from these tests that: (1) the effluent provided <b>by</b> sedimentation and <b>flotation</b> following medium and high-shear mixing is not adequate for discharge to most water-courses. (2) Flotation does not yield as clear an effluent as sedimentation. (3) Suspended solids removal <b>by</b> <b>flotation</b> requires a shorter detention time than <b>by</b> sedimentation. (4) <b>Flotation</b> yields a denser sludge than sedimenta-tion. (5) In the flotation process no advantage was found by using a pressure release of more than 20 psi...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Tailings {{recovery}} {{has been}} a constant challenge for most engineers. Along more than five years, GAUSTEC joined major players in the mining Industry to scavenge Iron from tailings produced <b>by</b> <b>flotation</b> making use of WHIMS (Wet High Intensity Magnetic Separation). In the early 1980 s, in USA, the US 4, 192, 738 patent was granted with promising results. Despite this, thirty years have passed with no significant application worldwide. One main reason is reported: the market missed a really high feed capacity WHIMS {{in order to avoid the}} huge number of the WHIMS that were available at that time (such projects would typically require more than 20 WHIMS to scavenge iron from tailings produced <b>by</b> <b>flotation</b> plants).
