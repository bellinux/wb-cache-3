5|$|Kelley {{was named}} Orioles' captain and {{received}} some {{stock in the}} team. McGraw, player-manager of the Orioles, resigned from the team to take over as manager of the New York Giants on July 7, 1902. In his absence, Kelley and Wilbert Robinson took over in the interim. Under indefinite suspension by Ban Johnson by July 1902 for fighting with umpires, Kelley entertained the idea of leaving the Orioles with McGraw, who was becoming frustrated with Johnson, and had begun negotiating to join the New York Giants of the NL. With the team in financial straits, Kelley sold his shares of the Orioles to Mahon, who had purchased McGraw's shares when he left for New York, becoming <b>principal</b> <b>shareholder</b> of the Orioles. Mahon then sold controlling interest in the Orioles to Andrew Freedman, principal owner of the Giants, and John T. Brush, principal owner of the Cincinnati Reds, on July 17. On the day they owned the franchise, they released the best players on the Orioles from their contracts {{so that they could}} be signed by National League teams: Kelley and Cy Seymour signed with the Reds, while McGinnity, Roger Bresnahan, Dan McGann, and Jack Cronin signed with the Giants. Johnson, along with Orioles minority owners, took control of the Orioles franchise, which had to forfeit their game that day as they did not have enough players. Kelley stated that the Orioles owed $12,000 ($ in current dollar terms), and that selling his shares was the only way Mahon could pay the team's debts.|$|E

25|$|Thomas Cant died in 1831. Changes in share {{ownership}} {{over the next}} few years gave control of the company to a new group of men. The <b>principal</b> <b>shareholder</b> was George Head Head, a Quaker banker from Carlisle, who owned 18 of the 64 shares by 1835. A new mine agent was appointed in 1832, and mining operations were greatly expanded, with 90 men being employed by 1834. A major investment was needed to access ore beneath the current level of the mine, but this meant driving a new level in barren ground for hundreds of yards. To safeguard their investment the company negotiated a fourteen-year extension to their lease (in 1835), giving them security until 1862.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time there had been changes among the {{shareholders}} of the mine. George Head Head had died in 1876 and Miles MacInnes, his adopted heir, became the <b>principal</b> <b>shareholder.</b> Two other large shareholders died in 1882. MacInnes was discouraged by the prospects of the mine and disposed of all his shares in 1884 following the £25 call on them. But new directors, led by Robert Bradshaw Smith and John Pattinson, began to increase production and cut costs. At a time when many British lead mines were closing, these men decided to face the financial challenges and keep the mine working. The mine returned to profitability and began paying dividends again in the financial year 1888/89.|$|E

This ensured that 50 {{percent of the}} capital (6 million reichsmarks) was in the hands of Bavarian businesses or banks. The Bavarian government placed the highest value on this strong local shareholding. The final one-third of the BMW shares were taken up by a Viennese financier, Camillo Castiglioni.|$|E
2500|$|When Captain Borlase {{arrived as}} the chief agent (mine manager) in 1889 {{it was clear that}} the engine shaft in the Lucy Level had been sunk too far to the south to work the long stretch of good ore that had been found near its {{northern}} end. Also, having been sunk into the footwall, longer and longer cross-cuts were needed to reach the vein from it. Another problem was that limited water resources would place limits on the winding and pumping capacities of the hydraulic engines as the mine deepened. Borlase proposed bold solutions to both problems. First he proposed building a hydroelectric power station further up the Glenridding valley, where water supply was abundant, but could not easily be used in the mine. Electricity could then be used for pumps and winding engines as well as for powering a locomotive. The electric winders and locomotive were to be the first ones installed in a metalliferous mine in Britain. Borlase also proposed a new engine shaft [...] north of the existing shaft, to be sunk initially in the hanging wall, from an eastern extension to Warsop's Crosscut. This (the third shaft at the mine) became known as Smith's Shaft, in honour of Robert Bradshaw Smith, one of the directors and the <b>principal</b> <b>shareholder.</b> Smith's Shaft is about [...] from the entrance to the Lucy Tongue Level.|$|E
