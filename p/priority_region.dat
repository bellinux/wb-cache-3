Here, we incorporate species distribution models for the koala, an arboreal marsupial, and its specialized food resources, to identify broad-scale <b>priority</b> conservation <b>regions.</b> We demonstrate a spatial prioritization approach that informs conservation planning and that links the shifting distribution of this declining species and its critical food resources under climate change.

40|$|Since its {{launch in}} 2010, the Tanzania National Voluntary Medical Male Circumcision (VMMC) Program has focused efforts on males ages 10 - 34 in 11 <b>priority</b> <b>regions.</b> Implementers {{have noted that}} over 70 % of VMMC clients are {{between the ages of}} 10 and 19, raising {{questions}} about whether additional efforts would be required to recruit men age 20 and above. This analysis uses mathematical modeling to examine the economic and epidemiological consequences of scaling up VMMC among specific age groups and <b>priority</b> <b>regions</b> in Tanzania. Analyses were conducted using the Decision Makers' Program Planning Tool Version 2. 0 (DMPPT 2. 0), a compartmental model implemented in Microsoft Excel 2010. The model was populated with population, mortality, and HIV incidence and prevalence projections from external sources, including outputs from Spectrum/AIDS Impact Module (AIM). A separate DMPPT 2. 0 model was created for each of the 11 <b>priority</b> <b>regions.</b> Tanzania can achieve the most immediate impact on HIV incidence by circumcising males ages 20 - 34. This strategy would also require the fewest VMMCs for each HIV infection averted. Circumcising men ages 10 - 24 will have the greatest impact on HIV incidence over a 15 -year period. The most cost-effective approach (lowest cost per HIV infection averted) targets men ages 15 - 34. The model shows the VMMC program is cost saving in all 11 <b>priority</b> <b>regions.</b> VMMC program cost-effectiveness varies across regions due to differences in projected HIV incidence, with the most cost-effective programs in Njombe and Iringa. The DMPPT 2. 0 results reinforce Tanzania's current VMMC strategy, providing newfound confidence in investing in circumcising adolescents. Tanzanian policy makers and program implementers will continue to focus scale-up of VMMC on men ages 10 - 34 years, seeking to maximize program impact and cost-effectiveness while acknowledging trends in demand among the younger and older age groups...|$|R

50|$|A recent {{series of}} papers {{has pointed out}} that {{biodiversity}} hotspots (and many other <b>priority</b> <b>region</b> sets) do not address the concept of cost.

The regions identified include some in the developed world (e.g. the California Floristic Province), alongside others in the developing world (e.g. Madagascar). The cost of land is likely to vary between these regions by an order of magnitude or more, but the biodiversity hotspot designations do not consider the conservation importance of this difference.

While results differed between selection procedures, four main regions were regularly selected: (1) one centered on southern Mali; (2) one including Eritrea, central Sudan, and northern Ethiopia; (3) one encompassing southwestern Kenya and much of Tanzania and Uganda; and (4) one including much of Zimbabwe and southwestern Zambia.

40|$|Due to {{the strong}} {{reflection}} property of materials with smooth surfaces like ceramic and metal, it will cause saturation and the highlight phenomenon in the image when taking pictures of those materials. In order to solve this problem, a new algorithm {{which is based on}} reflection component separation (RCS) and <b>priority</b> <b>region</b> filling theory is designed. Firstly, the specular pixels in the image are found by comparing the pixel parameters. Then, the reflection components are separated and processed. However, for ceramic, metal and other objects with strong specular highlight, RCS theory will change color information of highlight pixels due to larger specular reflection component. In this situation, <b>priority</b> <b>region</b> filling theory was used to restore the color information. Finally, we implement 3 D experiments on objects with strong reflecting surfaces like ceramic plate, ceramic bottle, marble pot and yellow plate. Experimental results show that, with the proposed method, the highlight caused by the strong reflecting surface can be well suppressed. The highlight pixel number of ceramic plate, ceramic bottle, marble pot and yellow plate, is decreased by 43. 8 times, 41. 4 times, 33. 0 times, and 10. 1 times.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{pressing}} issues facing the global conservation community is how to distribute limited resources between <b>regions</b> identified as <b>priorities</b> for biodiversity conservation(1 - 3). Approaches such as biodiversity hotspots(4), endemic bird areas(5) and ecoregions(6) are used by international organizations to prioritize conservation efforts globally(7). Although identifying <b>priority</b> <b>regions</b> is {{an important first step}} in solving this problem, it does not indicate how limited resources should be allocated between regions. Here we formulate how to allocate optimally conservation resources between <b>regions</b> identified as <b>priorities</b> for conservation - the 2 ̆ 7 conservation resource allocation problem 2 ̆ 7. Stochastic dynamic programming is used to find the optimal schedule of resource allocation for small problems but is intractable for large problems owing to the curse of dimensionality(8). We identify two easy- to- use and easy- to- interpret heuristics that closely approximate the optimal solution. We also show the importance of both correctly formulating the problem and using information on how investment returns change through time. Our conservation resource allocation approach can be applied at any spatial scale. We demonstrate the approach with an example of optimal resource allocation among five <b>priority</b> <b>regions</b> in Wallacea and Sundaland, the transition zone between Asia and Australasia...|$|R
