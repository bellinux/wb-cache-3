5|$|MWAA {{planned to}} award a {{separate}} design-build contract for <b>Phase</b> <b>II.</b> The <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> contract was awarded in May 2013 and the projected completion date {{was to be}} in 2018. However, it was later extended to 2019 or 2020.|$|E
5|$|On April 25, 2013, the <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> {{contract}} was issued {{at a cost}} of $1.177 billion. On August 20, 2014, the United States Department of Transportation announced that <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> would be funded with a $1.28 billion Transportation Infrastructure Financial Innovation Act (TIFIA) loan. This delivers part of an approximately $1.87 billion combined commitment of TIFIA loans for <b>Phase</b> <b>II,</b> which represents the largest TIFIA assistance for a single project in the program's history.|$|E

5|$|<b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> {{would prove}} {{influential}} on The Next Generation, whose creation began just {{over seven years}} later. The characters of Xon, Decker and Ilia were {{used as the basis}} for the creation of Data, William Riker and Deanna Troi. However, the series was allowed to be different in tone to the planned <b>Phase</b> <b>II,</b> for the feature films that had come before it had changed the audience expectations of what Star Trek was. It was originally proposed in Gerrold's The Worlds of Star Trek to have the second-in-command leading the away team, and it was anticipated that this would be included in <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> – it was instead first introduced in The Next Generation.|$|E
5|$|While {{construction}} of Phase I to Wiehle– Reston East was under way, the funding and planning of <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> through Dulles Airport continued. This included {{the adoption of}} a special taxing district by the Town of Herndon and a public planning forum. Early cost estimates for <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> had been $2.75 billion; however, a group of consultants increased the estimate in 2010 from $3.44 billion to $4.1 billion.|$|E
40|$|We study one {{dimensional}} quasiperiodic system {{obtained from the}} tight-binding model on the square lattice in a uniform magnetic field with the spin orbit interaction. The phase diagram {{with respect to the}} Harper coupling and the Rashba coupling are proposed from a number of numerical studies including a multifractal analysis. There are four <b>phases,</b> I, <b>II,</b> III, and IV in this order from weak to strong Harper coupling. In the weak coupling phase I all the wave functions are extended, in the intermediate coupling <b>phases</b> <b>II</b> and III mobility edges exist, and accordingly both localized and extended wave functions exist, and in the strong Harper coupling phase IV all the wave functions are localized. Phase I and Phase IV are related by the duality, and <b>phases</b> <b>II</b> and III are related by the duality, as well. A localized wave function is related to an extended wave function by the duality, and vice versa. The boundary between <b>phases</b> <b>II</b> and III is the self-dual line on which all the wave functions are critical. In the present model the duality does not lead to pure spectra in contrast to the case of Harper equation. Comment: 10 pages, 11 figure...|$|R

30|$|The {{friction}} force increased {{as a result}} of tissue relaxation, the estimation error could be observed in phase III. We assumed that the estimation error increased {{as a result of}} the tissue deformation, because the estimation error increased in the negative immediately after the total insertion force decreased sharply. Thus, the estimation error increased in insertion <b>phases</b> <b>II</b> and III, especially given that these phases included tissue cutting. The RMSE, indicating the dispersion from the true value, also increased in <b>phases</b> <b>II</b> and III. This means that the RMSE increases as a result of tissue cutting.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{infrared}} absorption spectra of the high-pressure crystalline <b>phases</b> <b>II,</b> III, and IV of solid CO 2 were studied {{by using a}} resistively heated diamond anvil cell up to 30 GPa. The employment of crystal slabs having thickness of ~ 2 m allowed {{the study of the}} strongly absorbing fundamental bending and antisymmetric stretching modes without saturation. These are the first data for <b>phases</b> <b>II</b> and IV in the fundamental modes spectral region; furthermore the high sample quality allowed an improved characterization of the infrared spectra of phases I and III as compared with previous studies. A comparison of the spectral structure and of the frequency evolution with pressure of the crystal modes between phase I and the higher-pressure phases clearly indicates the close resemblance among all these phases. In particular, the dramatic change of the intermolecular interaction claimed for <b>phases</b> <b>II</b> dimeric association and IV large molecular bending can be ruled out and, as a consequence, the hypothesis of a transition from the molecular phase I to the silica-like phase V through intermediate nonmolecular phases can be discarded...|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} carried out to {{investigate}} coping process in relation to specific distressful episodes xperienced by 120 paratrooper trainees. Scores of direct coping and emotional coping that were derived from the “Ways of Coping questionnaire were analyzed to examine the role of appraisal, level of anxiety, depression and level of stress as predictors of coping.

5|$|Wise asked Harold Michelson {{to be the}} film's {{production}} designer, and Michelson was put to work on {{finishing the}} incomplete <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> sets. The designer began with the bridge, which had nearly been completed. Michelson first removed Chekov's new weapons station, a semicircular plastic bubble grafted onto {{one side of the}} bridge wall. The idea for <b>Phase</b> <b>II</b> was that Chekov would have looked out toward space while crosshairs in the bubble tracked targets. Wise instead wanted Chekov's station to face the Enterprises main viewer, a difficult request as the set was primarily circular. Production illustrator Michael Minor created a new look for the station using a flat edge {{in the corner of the}} set.|$|E
5|$|Although the {{original}} financing {{plan called for}} a 50-cent toll increase on the Dulles Toll Road to finance the Silver Line (25 cents at the main plaza and 25 cents at the ramp plazas), the increase in projected costs resulted in the MWAA Board approving {{an increase in the}} surcharges. Effective January 1, 2010, the fare surcharge was increased to 50 cents at both the main plaza and ramp plazas, with additional 25-cent increases in main-plaza tolls set for 2011 and 2012. These toll surcharges are designed to support MWAA's 52.6% share of the projected $5.25 billion combined cost of Phase I and <b>Phase</b> <b>II.</b> MWAA has justified these toll increases as necessary to meet an estimated $220 million in annual debt-service costs projected by 2020. These toll revenue requirements were {{based on the assumption that}} the federal government, although it contributed $900 million to Phase I, would not contribute funds for <b>Phase</b> <b>II.</b>|$|E
