40|$|Cellular {{pathways}} of phloem loading in source {{leaves and}} phloem unloading in stems of sweet Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench were deduced from histochemical determinations of cell wall composition {{and from the}} relative radial mobilities of fluorescent tracer dyes exiting vascular pipelines. The cell walls of small vascular bundles in source leaves, the predicted site of phloem loading, contained minimal quantities of lignin and suberin. A phloem-loaded symplasmic tracer, carboxyfluorescein, was retained within the collection phloem, indicating symplasmic isolation. Together, these findings suggested that phloem loading in source leaves occurs apoplasmically. Lignin was restricted to the walls of protoxylem elements located in meristematic, elongating and recently elongated regions of the stem. The apoplasmic tracer, 8 -hydroxypyrene- 1, 3, 6 -trisulfonic acid, moved radially from the transpiration stream, consistent with <b>phloem</b> and storage <b>parenchyma</b> cells being interconnected by an apoplasmic pathway.

Here, we have cloned a cDNA encoding hydroxymethylbutenyl diphosphate synthase (HDS), a MEP pathway enzyme, and generated antibodies to investigate the distribution of transcripts and protein in MIA-producing aerial tissues. Consistent with our earlier work, transcripts for the genes encoding the so-called early steps in monoterpenoid biosynthesis (ESMB) enzymes (HDS, others MEP pathway enzymes and geraniol 10 -hydroxylase) were preferentially co-localized to internal <b>phloem</b> associated <b>parenchyma</b> (IPAP) cells. By contrast, transcripts for the enzyme catalysing the last biosynthetic step to secologanin, secologanin synthase, were found in the epidermis. A coordinated response of ESMB genes was also observed in cell cultures stimulated to synthesise MIAs by hormone treatment, whereas no changes in SLS expression were detected under the same experimental conditions. Immunocytolabelling studies with the HDS-specific serum demonstrated the localisation of HDS to the plastid stroma and revealed that HDS proteins were most abundant in IPAP cells but could also be found in other cell types, including epidermal and mesophyll cells. Besides showing the existence of post-transcriptional mechanisms regulating the levels of HDS in C. roseus cells, our results support that intercellular translocation likely plays an important role during monoterpene-secoiridoid assembly...|$|R

40|$|Xylem {{embolism}} is a {{limiting factor}} for woody species worldwide. Conifers at the alpine timberline {{are exposed to}} drought and freeze-thaw stress during winter, which induce potentially lethal embolism. Previous studies indicated that timberline trees survive by xylem refilling. In this study on Picea abies, refilling was monitored during winter and spring seasons and analyzed in the laboratory and in situ experiments, based on hydraulic, anatomical, and histochemical methods. Refilling started in late winter, when the soil was frozen and soil water not available for the trees. Xylem embolism caused up to 86. 2 % +/- 3. 1 % loss of conductivity and was correlated with the ratio of closed pits. Refilling of xylem as well as recovery in shoot conductance started in February and corresponded with starch accumulation in secondary phloem and in the mesophyll of needles, where we also observed increasing aquaporin densities in the phloem and endodermis. This indicates that active, cellular processes play a role for refilling even under winter conditions. As demonstrated by our experiments, water for refilling was thereby taken up via the branches, likely by foliar water uptake. Our results suggest that refilling is based on water shifts to embolized tracheids via intact xylem, <b>phloem,</b> and <b>parenchyma,</b> whereby aquaporins reduce resistances along the symplastic pathway and aspirated pits facilitate isolation of refilling tracheids.

40|$|International audienceMadagascar {{periwinkle}} (Catharanthus roseus [L. ] G. Don, Apocynaceae) produces monoterpene indole alkaloids (MIAs), secondary metabolites of {{high interest}} {{due to their}} therapeutic value. A key step in the biosynthesis is the generation of geraniol from geranyl diphosphate (GPP) in the monoterpenoid branch of the MIA pathway. Here {{we report on the}} cloning and functional characterization of C. roseus geraniol synthase (CrGES). The full-length CrGES was over-expressed in Escherichia coli and the purified recombinant protein catalyzed the conversion of GPP into geraniol with a K(m) value of 58. 5 μM for GPP. In vivo CrGES activity was evaluated by heterologous expression in a Saccharomyces cerevisiae strain mutated in the farnesyl diphosphate synthase gene. Analysis of culture extracts by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry confirmed the excretion of geraniol into the growth medium. Transient transformation of C. roseus cells with a Yellow Fluorescent Protein-fusion construct revealed that CrGES is localized in plastid stroma and stromules. In aerial plant organs, RNA in situ hybridization showed specific labeling of CrGES transcripts in the internal <b>phloem</b> associated <b>parenchyma</b> as observed for other characterized genes involved in the early steps of MIA biosynthesis. Finally, when cultures of Catharanthus cells were treated with the alkaloid-inducing hormone methyl jasmonate, an increase in CrGES transcript levels was observed.

The differences in the amount of phloem tissue between both kinds of fruitlets were not large but usually significant.

We investigated the kinetics of sucrose uptake by single sieve elements and <b>phloem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells in Vicia faba plants. To this end, microelectrodes were inserted into free-lying phloem cells in the main vein of the youngest fully-expanded leaf, half-way along the stem, in the transition zone between the autotrophic and heterotrophic part of the stem, and in the root axis. A top-to-bottom membrane potential gradient of sieve elements was observed along the stem (- 130 mV to - 110 mV), while the membrane potential of the <b>phloem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells was stable (approx. - 100 mV). In roots, the membrane potential of sieve elements dropped abruptly to - 55 mV. Bathing solutions having various sucrose concentrations were administered and sucrose/H+-induced depolarisations were recorded. Data analysis by nonlinear least-square data fittings as well as by linear Eadie-Hofstee (EH) -transformations pointed at biphasic Michaelis-Menten kinetics (2 MM, EH: Km 1 1. 2 - 1. 8 mM, Km 2 6. 6 - 9. 0 mM) of sucrose uptake by sieve elements. However, Akaike’s Information Criterion (AIC) favoured single MM kinetics. Using single MM as the best-fitting model, Km values for sucrose uptake by sieve elements decreased along the plant axis from 1 to 7 mM. For <b>phloem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells, higher Km values (EH: Km 1 10 mM, Km 2 70 mM) as compared to sieve elements were found.

Previously, 3600 EMS (ethyl methane sulfonate) mutagenized C. roseus plants had been screened with a simple TLC (thin layer chromatography) to identify mutants with altered MIA profiles yielded one plant with trace MIA production. This trace MIA status was confirmed using UPLC-MS (Ultra Performance Liquid Chromatography and Mass Spectrometry) and the plant had a thick, stocky, short root system, small leaves, a rigid stem, premature senescence and was susceptible to infection resulting in its rescue to in-vitro. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis of iridoid gene expression showed significant downregulation of several iridoid pathway genes as well as the downregulation of transcription factors BIS 1 and BIS 2. Feeding the trace MIA mutant roots the iridoid secologanin resulted in alkaloid production in the leaves. While grafting trace MIA mutant shoots onto MIA producing WT roots also resulted in alkaloid production in the mutant leaves.

The anatomical effects of methyl jas-monate (MJ), a potent inducer of certain plant defenses, were compared with wounding of the bark of 12 – 15 -year-old trees of five conifer species. Wounding in all species resulted in tis-sue necrosis and wound periderm development immediately around the wound site. One cm from the wound, swelling of <b>phloem</b> polyphenolic <b>parenchyma</b> cells and phenolic accumu-lation were observed in Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco, Picea pungens Engelman, Larix occidentalis Nutt. and Pinus monticola Douglas ex D. Don, but not in Taxus brevifolia Nutt. Traumatic resin ducts were formed in response to wounding in three species of Pinaceae, but not in P. monticola, which formed irregular clusters of cells rather than ducts. Taxus brev-ifolia did not form resin ducts in response to either wounding or MJ treatment. In the Pinaceae species studied, surface applica-tion of 100 mM MJ caused similar anatomical changes to those observed in response to wounding, including phenolic accu-mulation, cell swelling and traumatic resin duct formation, {{but it did not}} induce a wound periderm. Traumatic resin ducts dif-fered in size among the study species, ranging from small in L. occidentalis to very large in P. menziesii. In P. menziesii, P. pungens and L. occidentalis, traumatic resin ducts were more abundant after MJ treatment than after wounding.

40|$|Abstract Changes in {{the stem}} radius of young Norway spruce [Picea abies (L.) Karst. ] {{were related to}} changes in stem water content in order to {{investigate}} the relation-ship between diurnal stem size fluctuations and internal-ly stored water. Experiments were performed on living trees and on cut stem segments. The defoliated stem seg-ments were dried under room conditions and weight (W), volume (V), and xylem water potential (Ψs) were contin-uously monitored for 95 h. Additionally, photos of cross-sections of fresh and air-dried stem segments were taken. For stem segments {{we found that the}} change in V was linearly correlated to the change in W as long as Ψs was>– 2. 3 ± 0. 3 MPa (phase transition point). Stem contrac-tion occurred almost solely in the elastic tissues of the bark (cambium, <b>phloem,</b> and <b>parenchyma),</b> and the stem radius changes were closely coupled to bark water con-tent. For living trees, it is therefore possible to estimate the daily contribution of “bark water ” to transpiration from knowledge of the stem size and continuous mea-surements of the stem radius fluctuations. When Ψs reaches the phase-transition point, water is also with-drawn from the inelastic tissue of the stem (xylem), which – in the experiment with stem segments – was in-dicated by an increasing ratio between ∆V and ∆W. We assume that for Ψs below the transition point, air is sucked into the tracheids (cavitation) and water is also withdrawn from the xylem. Due to the fact that in living P. abies Ψs rarely falls below – 2. 3 ± 0. 3 MPa and the xy-lem size is almost unaffected by radius fluctuations, dendrometers are useful instruments with which to de-rive the diurnal changes in the bark water contents of Norway spruce trees...|$|R

NCo 376 were {{examined}} {{for evidence of}} symplasmic phloem unloading of sucrose from the phloem, via the bundle sheath to the storage parenchyma. The vascular bundle possesses wellisolated phloem comprised of large diameter sieve elements and small diameter companion cells. A layer of <b>phloem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> surrounds the phloem, except where the phloem abuts the crushed protophloem. Outside this is a sclerenchymatous sheath, directly endarch to a parenchymatous bundle sheath, which is surrounded by storage parenchyma. The bundle sheath is interrupted at the centrifugal pole of the vascular bundle by a phloem fibre cap. Scanning Electron Microscopy revealed plasmodesmal fields throughout the bundle sheath and pith tissue. Transmission Electron Microscopy studies provided evidence of plasmodesmal occlusion, but not in all tissues. Aniline blue reactions under UV light indicate the presence of occluded plasmodesmal fields at the <b>phloem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> / sclerenchymatous sheath interface, and in localised regions of cells which are smaller than the surrounding storage parenchyma cells. This suggests a symplasmic transport pathway at these locations, and, based on these positive aniline blue reactions, with regulation via callose-mediated transplasmodesmal transport. Osmotic stress experiments, which included the addition of Ca 2 +, did not reveal further callose occlusion in the parenchyma, suggesting that the plasmodesmata in these regions may be closed via a noncallosic mechanism. Dye-coupling studies, using Lucifer Yellow (LYCH), which was iontophoretically injected following turgor-pressure equalisation, showed only rare, limited symplastic transport, usually only between the injected cell and one adjacent cell. Most injections {{did not result in}} transport of LYCH, suggesting either a lack of plasmodesmal connectivity, occlusion, or gating of any plasmodesmata present. This limited symplasmic transport, combined with the presence of occluded plasmodesmata at the <b>phloem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> / sclerenchymatous sheath interface suggests the presence of a two-domain phloem-unloading pathway. While symplastic transport may occur from the phloem to the sclerenchymatous sheath, further sucrose transport to the storage parenchyma appears to proceed apoplasmically from the sclerenchymatous sheath / bundle sheath interface, and into storage parenchyma cells across the cell wall and cell membrane via specialised sucrose transporters...|$|E
30|$|OsASNase 2 {{transcript}} accumulation {{was detected}} in the dorsal vascular bundle, especially in <b>phloem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> cells and the nucellar projection in spikelets, using antisense probes for in situ hybridization analysis (Fig.  3 c). When the OsASNase 2 sense probe was used, only weak signals as background level were observed (Fig.  3 d). Toluidine blue O staining visualized {{the structure of a}} developing rice spikelet, and the arrows are representing the metabolite flow from phloem sap (Fig.  3 b) (Matsuda et al. 1979). Neither sense nor antisense probes for OsASNase 1 transcripts provided a clear staining (result not shown).|$|E
40|$|Ten popular timber species {{belonging}} to seven families in Nigeria {{were identified in}} the Herbarium. Wood samples of each species were studied anatomically in search of stable taxonomic micromorphological attributes. Characters of the treachery elements, in particular, the vessel; fibre and ray structure; intercellular canal and <b>phloem</b> <b>parenchyma</b> are diagnostic among the species. The invariable presence of non-septate fibres in Afzelia africana (Sm.) and Milicia excelsa (Welsh. and C. C. Berg.) delimits them from other woods which all posses septate fibres. Occurrence of tyloses in the metaxylem of Cordia millenii (Bak.), Antiaris toxicaria (Lesch.), Tectona grandis (L...|$|E
40|$|Gall {{formation}} in the composite, Ageratina riparia, is induced by the presence and activity of the larval stages of the gall-forming tephritid, Procecidochares alani (Steyskal). The tephritid spends its entire larval stage in the subapical area of the stem and its activity causes {{the formation of a}} bulbous shaped gall. Histological examination of the gall reveals an abundance of secretory ducts external and sometimes internal to the vascular cylinder; doubled vascular bundles; "faisceaux d'irrigation"; an increase in <b>phloem</b> and pith <b>parenchyma</b> accompanied by a decrease in xylem; nutritive cells; and an increase in stem diameter due to hyperplasia of the pith area. Morphologically, P. alani third instars possess structures generally characteristic of other cyclorrhaphous dipteran larvae. However, a yellowish membranous structure was found attached to the distal part of the most anterior pair of Malpighian tubules which appears to be unique to gall flies in the genus Procecidochares. This pair of structures, termed "yellow bodies," increases in size with each succeeding instar, decreases in size during pupariation, and is absent 2 to 3 days into the pupal stage. The proposed function of this structure is discussed...|$|R
40|$|Excised {{pieces of}} {{vascular}} bundle and phloem tissue {{were allowed to}} accumulate radioactive phosphate and sulfate, and were then sectioned and autoradiographed so as to detect the sites of accumulation. Special methods were needed to prevent any diffusion of the radioisotope. Some autoradiographs obtained are presented. In excised celery vascular bundles, the most radioactive area and hence the most actively accumulating tissue was the young secondary phloem {{at the sides of}} the bundle. In intact plants, the same tissue was the most active in translocating. In excised apple phloem there was some variation in behavior, but again the young secondary phloem was generally the most actively accumulating tissue. Accumulation activities of individual cells in the phloem and vascular tissue were compared. It appeared that all cell types, ray, <b>phloem</b> and xylem <b>parenchyma,</b> cambial cells and sieve tubes, accumulated at least 5 times more actively than did the cortical parenchyma cells. The sieve tubes were among the most actively accumulating cells present, accumulating 20 times more actively than the cortical parenchyma cells. It is concluded that accumulation processes have a primary role to play in the mechanism of phloem transport...|$|R
40|$|Longitudinal {{veins in}} leaf blades of the sea-grass Thalassodendron ciliatum (Forssk.) Den Hartog {{consist of a}} sheath of cells with {{thickened}} walls which encloses xylem, <b>phloem</b> and vascular <b>parenchyma</b> cells. While the xylem is reduced, phloem is well developed and consists of sieve tubes and companion cells. Two types of sieve tubes are distinguishable: those with thick walls and those with thin walls. Companion cells generally have dense cytoplasmic contents and are connected to sieve tubes by branched plasmodesmata. Vascular parenchyma cells possess an organelle-rich cytoplasm with chloroplasts as plastids. Numerous plasmodesmata interconnect contiguous vascular parenchyma cells. Plasmodesmata connecting vascular parenchyma cells to sieve tubes and companion cells are observed less frequently. Each bundle sheath cell is encased within a multilayered suberin lamella. Bundle sheath cell walls have prominent pit fields which are traversed by plasmodesmata. The plasmodesmata perforate the suberin lamella and interconnect sheath cells with contiguous vascular parenchyma and mesophyll cells. Bundle sheath cells generally possess sparse cytoplasmic contents but have relatively well developed chloroplasts. The suberin lamella appears to form an apoplastic barrier between mesophyll and vascular tissues. Structural features of the veins are compared with those found in similar veins in leaves of terrestrial monocotyledonous plants...|$|R
