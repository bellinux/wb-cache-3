40|$|Atmel is {{inventing a}} new {{microcontroller}} that {{is capable of}} running Java pro- grams through an implementation of the Java Virtual Machine. Compared to industry standard PCs the microcontroller has limited processing power and main memory. When running interactive programs on this microcontroller {{it is important that the}} <b>program</b> <b>interruption</b> time is kept to a minimum. In a Java Virtual machine the garbage collector is responsible for reclaiming unused main memory and making it available for the Java program again. This process creates a <b>program</b> <b>interruption</b> where the Java program is halted and the garbage collector is working. At the project start the Atmel Virtual Machine was using the mark-sweep garbage collector. This garbage collector could produce a <b>program</b> <b>interruption</b> greater than one second and was not suitable for interactive programs. The Memory-Constrained Copying algorithm is a new garbage collection algorithm that is incremental and therefore only collects a little bit of main memory at a time compared to the implemented mark-sweep garbage collector. A theoretical comparison of the mark sweep algorithm and the Memory- Constrained Copying algorithm was performed. This comparison showed that the mark-sweep algorithm would have a much longer <b>program</b> <b>interruption</b> than the Memory-Constrained Copying algorithm. The two algorithms should in the- ory also produce equal throughput. The penalty for the short program interrup- tion time in the Memory-Constrained Copying algorithm is its high algorithmic complexity. After a few modfications to the Virtual Machine, the Memory-Constrained Copying algorithm was implemented and tested functionally. To test the pro- gram interruption and throughput of the garbage collection algorithms a set of benchmarks were chosen. The EDN Embedded Microprocessor Benchmark Consortium Java benchmark suite was selected as the most accurate benchmarks available. The practical comparison of the two garbage collection algorithms showed that the theoretical comparison was correct. The mark-sweep algorithm pro- duced in the worst case an interruption of 3 seconds, while the Memory-Constrained Copying algorithm's maximum <b>program</b> <b>interruption</b> was 44 milliseconds. The results of the benchmarking confirms the results that the inventors of the Memory-Constrained Copying algorithm achieved in their test. Their test was not performed on a microcontroller, but on a standard desktop computer. This implementation has also confirmed that it is possible to implement the Memory-Constrained Copying algorithm in a microcontroller. During the implementation of the Memory-Constrained Copying algorithm a hardware bug was found in the microcontroller. This bug was identified and reported so the hardware could be modified. </p...|$|E

5000|$|In {{the decades}} before 24-hour news {{networks}} such as CNN began to exist, <b>programming</b> <b>interruptions</b> were restricted to extremely urgent news, {{such as the}} death of an important political figure. For example, one of the earliest such interruptions that modern viewers would recognize as [...] "breaking news" [...] coverage was for the assassination of U.S. President John F. Kennedy in 1963, (with CBS News anchorman Walter Cronkite's coverage being especially noted), and as such reflected the relatively crude technology and procedures of that era. Such breaks are now common at 24-hour news channels, which may have an anchor available for live interruption at any time. Some networks, such as Sky News, largely emphasize this, even advertising the station/network as being [...] "first for breaking news".|$|R
40|$|Study objective: The {{protocol}} {{for the use}} of the automated external defibrillator calls for a period of "hands-off" time, during which no cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) can be performed. We assessed the actual interruption time of CPR during the use of the automated external defibrillator in patients in out-of-hospital cardiac arrest. Methods: This study included 184 patients experiencing out-of-hospital cardiac arrest in which an automated external defibrillator was applied by first responders. ECG and voice recordings from the automated external defibrillator were down-loaded and analyzed. Start and end times of CPR were recorded, as were intervals measured from the recordings concerning the <b>programmed</b> <b>interruption</b> time and the interruption time related to performance. Results: The automated external defibrillators were connected for a median time of 4 minutes 47 seconds (range 31 to 1, 404 seconds). CPR was performed during 45 %+/- 15 % (mean+/-SD) of the connected time or until return of spontaneous circulation. During the automated external defibrillator connection time in the 96 patients with a shockable rhythm, CPR was performed 36 %+/- 20 % of the time. <b>Programmed</b> <b>interruption</b> of CPR took 40 %+/- 15 % of the automated external defibrillator connection time, and no CPR was performed related to performance during 23 %+/- 15 % of the time. A palpable pulse was never present immediately after a shock, and return of spontaneous circulation was observed in 3 of 184 patients before arrival of the ambulance. Ultimately, return of spontaneous circulation occurred in 87 of 184 patients. Conclusion: First responders using automated external defibrillator voice prompts provide CPR less than half the time that the automated external defibrillator is connected to the patient. Technical improvements in automated external defibrillator rhythm analysis, more efficient resuscitation algorithms, and first-responder education could increase CPR delivery and, perhaps, improve outcom...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn the {{framework}} of the GUINEVERE (EUROTRANS-IP FP 6) and FREYA (FP 7) projects, a two-level procedure is developed to measurethe time variations of an ADS reactivity ρ(t). First, the time variations of the reactor power and neutron source intensity are monitored online,allowing to extract the fast fluctuations of ρ(t) around a reference value. Then, absolute measurements of ρ are periodically performed toreadjust the relative measurements. These calibration measurements require the analysis of the decay of the neutron population triggeredby <b>programmed</b> beam <b>interruptions.</b> In this paper, we describe an innovative method developed to measure the prompt multiplicationfactor, kp, of a subcritical reactor (and therefore its absolute ρ). Unlike conventional methods used for reactivity measurements, ourapproach only relies on the prompt decay of the neutron population, therefore enabling the use of shorter beam interruptions (< 50 μs) thanusual (~ 1 ms). After a review of the method’s mechanics, we apply it to measurements performed at the GUINEVERE facility, with theVENUS-F reactor, a zero power lead subcritical fast reactor. During these measurements, the neutron source was operated in pulsemode. Our results, promising, are compared with reference reactivity values provided by a MSM analysis...|$|R
40|$|Acute primary HIV- 1 {{infection}} (PHI) remains underestimated or misdiagnosed {{in clinical}} practice. Meanwhile, {{it has been}} demonstrated that early therapeutic interventions with {{highly active antiretroviral therapy}} (HAART) may delay disease progression and possibly preserve and expand the most effective immune effector T-cells against HIV together with the humoral immune responses. Since long-life HAART is an unachievable goal due to long-term toxicity and risk of occurrence of resistant strains due to a decreased compliance or other still undefined host factors, preliminary data of <b>programmed</b> treatment <b>interruption</b> in patients treated for PHI suggest that a significant number (30 - 50 %) could benefit from long periods off therapy. However, in more than half of them, the viral load will rebound, justifying that treatment be reinitiated. In order to reduce this proportion, new options are currently being investigated, including adjunctive immune therapy to HAART such as cytokines or vaccines, which could tackle the viral rebounds by increasing HIV-specific cellular responses. An update on the management of patients with PHI is reviewed and the limits of the current standard of care are discussed. © 2001 Éditions scientifiques et médicales Elsevier SAS.
