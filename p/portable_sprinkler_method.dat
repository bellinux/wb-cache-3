40|$|A {{computer}} model (SprinklerMod) {{was developed to}} simulate hydraulics of sprinkler irrigation systems. The objective {{of this paper is}} to describe mathematical background of this model for simulating pressures and discharges of sprinklers along the laterals. The model is capable of designing two types of laterals: laterals with fixed sprinklers and laterals with <b>portable</b> <b>sprinklers.</b> The model shows the simulation results in the forms of tables and graphs. Laterals with one or two diameters on uniform or non-uniform slopes can be designed. The model provides graphical presentation of percentage of sprinkler pressure variations for different lateral inside diameters. The Hazen- Williams equation was used for the calculation of friction losses. The required input parameters for lateral simulation are lateral type, desired sprinkler operating discharge and pressure head, spacing between sprinklers, distance of first sprinkler from lateral inlet, number of sprinklers operating on the lateral, riser height, Hazen- Williams pipe friction coefficient and lateral longitudinal slope or field elevations at each of the sprinklers on the lateral. Laterals are simulated such that average sprinkler pressures and discharges become equal to the values requested by the designer. Iterative procedures were implemented to simulate sprinkler pressures and discharges on laterals and the Newton- Raphson iterative method was used for calculating pressure of each of the sprinklers on the laterals with <b>portable</b> <b>sprinklers.</b> In order to evaluate the model, some example results of the model were compared with classical design results. Since there is no formula for the calculation of the required lateral inlet pressure in classical design of laterals with <b>portable</b> <b>sprinklers</b> in the scientific references, a new formula was developed. Averages of absolute percentage of variations of lateral inlet pressures for laterals with fixed sprinklers and with one or two-size diameters ranged from 0. 3 to 0. 7 percent, respectively. This value for laterals with <b>portable</b> <b>sprinklers</b> was 0. 1 percent. ...|$|R

40|$|Water application, storage, and {{distribution}} efficiencies of <b>sprinkler</b> and furrow <b>methods</b> of irrigation were compared at North Platte, Nebraska. Four plots of Midland grain sorghum were irrigated with <b>portable</b> <b>sprinkler</b> lines and four with gated pipe and furrows. Cultural practices {{were the same}} for all plots with the exception that the sprinkler plots did not receive any cultivation at the time of furrowing the plots to be furrow irrigated. The results obtained were: Runoff losses on the sprinkler plots averaged 0. 5 per cent of the water applied. On the furrow plots 6. 67 per cent of applied water ran off. Evaporation and deep percolation were assumed to be the difference between runoff loss and total water loss. These combined losses were 16. 8 per cent of the water applied on sprinkler plots and 19. 1 per cent of the applied water on furrow plots. The water application efficiency on sprinkler plots averaged 82. 7 per cent as compared to an average of 74. 2 per cent on furrow irrigated plots. The water storage efficiency on furrow irrigated plots averaged 93. 0 per cent as compared to an average of 88. 5 per cent on sprinkler plots. Water distribution efficiencies provide a direct means of comparing areas within a plot or corresponding areas of different plots to determine uniformity of water application. The average distribution efficiency lengthwise of the plots varied from 8. 2 percentage points on sprinkler plots as compared to 38. 9 percentage points on furrow irrigated plots. The average distribution efficiency across the plots varied from 8. 1 percentage points on furrow irrigated plots to 12. 7 percentage points on sprinkler plots. The average yield of grain sorghum was 69. 1 bushels per acre for furrow irrigation. The average yield of grain sorghum was 67. 6 bushels per acre for sprinkler irrigation.

40|$|A {{potential}} {{scenario for}} retrieving saltcake from single shell tanks is the ''Rainbird{reg_sign} sprinkler'' method. Water is distributed evenly {{across the surface}} of the saltcake and allowed to percolate by gravity through the waste. The salt dissolves in the water, forming a saturated solution. The saturated liquid is removed by a saltwell pump situated near the bottom of the tank. By this method, there is never a large inventory of liquid in the tank that could pose a threat of leakage. There are many variables or factors that can influence the hydrodynamics of this retrieval process. They include saltcake porosity; saltwell pumping rate; salt dissolution chemistry; factors that could promote flow channeling (e. g. tank walls, dry wells, inclusions or discontinuities in the saltcake); method of water distribution; plug formation due to crystal formations or accumulation of insoluble solids. A brief literature search indicates that very little experimental data exist on these aspects of saltcake dissolution (Wiersma 1996, 1997).

40|$|Efficient use {{of water}} in {{irrigated}} agriculture is as important in areas of plentiful water supply {{as it is in}} water-short areas. Much of the water delivered to the farm for irrigation is lost while applying it to the land because of the system management practices followed.

Factors affecting field-water application efficiency in irrigation are climate, soil, crop, water supply, topography, method of irrigation, irrigation system design, and irrigation system operation. Water is applied to the land by four general methods: flooding, furrows, sprinkler, and subirrigation.

The research {{was carried out in}} Sardinia (39 &ordm; 59 &rsquo; N; 8 &ordm; 40 &rsquo; E, at altitude 15 m). The cultivars used in the experiments, respectively in 2002 and in 2004 - 2005 - 2006, were Irat 212 and Eurosis. In each year cultivars were subjected to the same crop management. Irrigation was applied since the emergence with the <b>sprinkler</b> <b>method,</b> taking into account the loss of water from &lsquo;Class A&rsquo; pan evaporation. Soil water content was monitored at 0. 10 m intervals until 1. 00 -m depth using a &lsquo;Diviner 2000 &rsquo; (Sentek). In 2002 seven irrigation scheduling treatments were compared. In 2004, 2005, 2006 irrigation treatments provided for optimal soil water conditions during the growing season. In 2002 the results highlighted: 1) 0 - 0. 20 m depth was the most important layer for crop water uptake and the best correlated layer with rice rough yield; 2) the positive relationship between yield and water supply was significant until 6500 m 3 ha- 1 of water applied. Further seasonal irrigation volumes did not increase significantly yield. In 2004, 2005 and 2006 the analysis of the soil water balance at different crop phenological stages allowed to estimate crop coefficients (Kc) using the Penman-Monteith equation and the &lsquo;Class A&rsquo; pan evaporation (Kcev). Kc varied over the three-year period on average from 0. 90 to 1. 07 and 0. 97, respectively for the emergence-end of tillering, end of tillering-heading and heading-maturing periods, while crop coefficients as a ratio between maximum crop evapotranspiration (ETc) and Epan, Kcev ranged from 0. 78 to 0. 92 and 0. 81 for the same time periods...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} issues affecting future world is managing the existing water resources. There is no doubt that global warming has created significant troubles on people's lives and it has caused shortage of water in the world. Therefore, we need to manage the water resources by allocating appropriate methods. In this paper, we use data envelopment analysis to measure the relative efficiency of fourteen different irrigation methods. The proposed model of this paper uses four inputs including cost, risk, maintenance and expertise and two outputs including flexibility and durability of irrigation methods. The preliminary results indicate that two surface irrigation <b>methods,</b> one <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation <b>method</b> and one subsurface irrigation technique are considered efficient. Other irrigation techniques are only as much as 50 to 94 percent efficient compared with these five irrigation technique...|$|R

40|$|ABSTRACT. Center pivot {{sprinkler}} irrigation is increasing in {{popularity in the}} United States due to the low labor requirement and ability to irrigate large fields. The main problem associated with pivots {{continues to be the}} inherently high application rates and tendency for runoff and erosion on medium- and fine-textured soils and rolling topography. Recently developed sprinklers or spray heads can produce high application uniformity with controlled drop sizes and medium sized pattern widths at medium to low pressures. A method is presented to predict the average and peak application rates at any point along a center pivot lateral for a particular type of <b>sprinkler.</b> The <b>method</b> can be incorporated with infiltration and center pivot design models to predict when runoff might occur. A computer program is available to aid in the design process and compare alternative configurations...|$|R
40|$|Water is {{essential}} for sustaining life {{and it is one}} of the most important resources that we have. According to the experts, recent climatic changes and drought conditions have decreased surface water flows in many parts of the world. The Governments face these issues by constructing dams, canals, and pipelines for better irrigation in various parts of their country. Approximately, 70 % of the water withdrawn from various fresh water sources is used for Agricultural activities. The global population is increasing at rapid phase. But, the current water resources and the way in which we spend the water for various activities indicate that the available water resources will not satisfy the demands of the future generations. So, better irrigation practices need to be followed using latest in-available information and communication technologies (ICT) using sensor controlled solar powered drip and <b>sprinkler</b> irrigation <b>methods</b> to optimize the water usage for agricultural practices...|$|R
