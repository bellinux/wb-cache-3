5|$|Many women's {{rights activists}} {{who worked with}} Stanton were opposed to the <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>The</b> Woman's Bible; they felt it would harm the drive for women's suffrage. Although it was never {{accepted}} by Bible scholars as a major work, it became a popular best-seller, much {{to the dismay of}} suffragists who worked alongside Stanton within the National American Woman Suffrage Association (NAWSA). Susan B. Anthony tried to calm the younger suffragists, but they issued a formal denunciation of the book, and worked to distance the suffrage movement from Stanton's broader scope which included attacks on traditional religion. Because of the widespread negative reaction, including that of suffragists who had been close to her, <b>publication</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> book effectively ended Stanton's influence in the suffrage movement.|$|E
