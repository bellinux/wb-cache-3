40|$|Microstereolithography is {{a rapidly}} {{developing}} technique for {{the generation of}} 3 D structures by the building up of 2 D layers and has shown great potential {{for the development of}} scaffolds for clinical applications. Significant research has been carried out on the development of functionalised biocompatible polymers specifically for this technique. With this technique there is potential for the fabrication of a patient/injury specific scaffold, by scanning the injured site, developing a 3 D model and converting it into 2 D layers for fabrication. The construction of 3 D scaffolds requires control of the curing depth of the resin to prevent loss of 3 D control by through polymerisation into the monomer. This control is present in commercial resins, however, a method using biocompatible materials has not been reported upon. This work demonstrates how natural products, specifically <b>paprika</b> <b>extracts,</b> can be used to control the penetration of UV light into resin, and so control the thickness of layers generated. The behaviour of these resin compositions upon exposure to light has been determined, and equations governing curing depth have been determined. The microporosity of cell growth scaffolds {{is an important factor in}} the reactivity of the material, and this is a scale which cannot be controlled in some μSL apparatus due to the lack of resolution. Microporosity has been obtained by the use of monomer soluble, nonfunctionalised polymers. This has allowed the development of scaffolds with increased surface area and so potentially higher reactivity than those without porogens. Material reactivity is also important for scaffolds, specifically in hard tissue replacement, where the differentiation of mesenchymal stem cells to osteoblast cells is guided by calcium phosphates. The development of photopolymerisable resins containing hydroxyapatite in suitably stable suspensions is reported upon. These materials can be easily polymerised, and is has been shown that adult stem cells adhere to, and proliferate, on them. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R

The cell viability upon treatment for 24 hr with either <b>paprika</b> <b>extract</b> or vitamin C alone was similar {{to or greater than}} that of the untreated control. However, the viability of the cells treated with lycopene or beta-carotene decreased to about 20 % of that in the untreated control. When UVB-exposed cells were post-incubated for 24 hr in medium containing <b>paprika</b> <b>extract</b> or vitamin C, cell viability in-creased in a concentration dependent manner as compared to those post-incubated in a normal growth medium.

40|$|The {{activity}} of natural carotenoid extracts against the autoxidative deterioration of sunflower oil-in-water emulsions was estimated {{in terms of}} primary (lipid hydroperoxides) and secondary ("off flavour" volatiles) oxidation products. At a concentration of 2 g l(- 1), the tested carotenoids did not inhibit the production of hydroperoxides but they significantly retarded the formation of volatile aldehydes during the storage of simple tween-stabilised emulsions at 30 degrees C. In another series of experiments, several carotenoid <b>extracts</b> (<b>paprika.</b> annatto and marigold preparations) containing mainly polar carotenoids, added at an active concentration of 1 g l(- 1), exerted a strong activity against hydroperoxides and TBARs during the accelerated oxidation (60 degrees C) of homogenised protein-based emulsions. On the contrary, carotene preparations rich in hydrophobic alpha- and beta-carotenes and lycopene did not significantly differ from the control emulsion. Therefore, the carotenoid structure modulated their antioxidant effect, while concentration and emulsion structure may also affect carotenoid activity in protein dispersed systems.

40|$|Capsicum red pigment {{extracted}} from the dry pepper {{is a kind of}} high-quality natural dye which has anticancer and cosmetic properties. First, Qiu North spicy was selected as the experimental objects by comparising the peel meal rate and relative amount of pigment of Fructus capsici, Qian chilli 2, and Qiu North spicy. Then, before <b>extracting</b> <b>paprika</b> dye, sodium hydroxide was used to eliminate the piquancy. Capsicum red pigment was extracted in Soxhlet extractor with 95 % ethanol. The elution condition of column chromatographic separation was obtained by thin-layer chromatography, and the purity of capsicum red pigment was identified by methods of infrared spectrum(IR). Finally, the color value of capsicum red pigment was determined by spectrophotometer with 460 nm. Results showed that the optimal process: Concentration of peppery removal agent (sodium hydroxide) was 10 %, the holding temperature was 80 ????, solid-liquid ratio was 1 : 20 (g/ml), the extraction time was 120 min and the times of extraction were twice. Eluent of silica gel column chromatography separation consisted of petroleum ether and 90 % ethanol with the volume ratio of 2 : 1.

40|$|The current PhD thesis concern {{parameters}} {{that affect}} the oxidative stability of oil-in-water emulsions. Lipid oxidation determined by measuring primary (conjugated dienes-CD and lipid hydroperoxides) and secondary oxidation products (thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and volatile products). The parameters studied were type (sunflower-, cottonseed-, corn- and olive kernel-oil) and concentration (10 - 60 %) of lipid phase, type (Tween 20, Na-CAS, WPI) and concentration (0. 5 - 3 %) of emulsifier and pH (1. 7 - 7. 0). The sunflower oil-in-water emulsions oxidized faster due to their content of polyunsaturated fatty acids (60 - 63 %), followed by emulsions with cottonseed- (57. 7 - 58. 0 %), corn- (55 - 57 %) and olive kernel-oil (12. 1 %). Increase of concentration in sunflower oil-based emulsions till 30 % resulted to the reduction of oxidative rate, while emulsions with oil content 30, 40 and 60 % oxidized at the same extent. Milk proteins, Na-CAS and WPC, as well as mixtures of emulsifiers, Na-CAS and Tween 20 at different ratio {{led to the formation}} of oxidatively stable emulsions in comparison to Tween-based emulsions. An increase in protein concentration (0. 5, 1, 2 %) or in protein proportion in the emulsifier mixture (25, 50, 75, 100 %) was found to inhibit proportionally the oxidative instability of the emulsions. Emulsions stabilized with preheated revealed a decrease of emulsion oxidative sensitivity. An increase of pH (3, 5. 5, 7) in Tween-stabilized emulsions led to higher rates of oxidative deterioration, in comparison to protein-stabilized emulsions at pH (1. 7, 5. 7, 7), where opposite results observed. Oxidation rate of emulsions stabilized with mixture of Na-CAS-Tween 20 (50 : 50) was unaffected by the pH (3. 5, 6. 5) change. The emulsions homogenized with ultrasonic agitation and had oil droplet size (2. 30 ± 0. 15 μm), or under varying pressures (30, 100, 300, 600, 900 bars) had droplet size (from 3. 23 ± 0. 25 μm to 0. 67 ± 0. 25 μm). Droplet size had no effect on the oxidative deterioration of the emulsions, irrespectively of the type of emulsifier used. An increase of storage temperature (5, 15, 25, 40, 60 °C) led to higher oxidation rates. The rate constant of CD increase was temperature dependent according to Arrhenius equation with an activation energy equal to 37. 5 kJ/mol. Finally, natural compounds, known for their antioxidant capacities, like carotenoids and flavonoids were studied. B-carotene, lycopene and lutein, paprika, bixin-rich and norbixin-rich annatto extracts from the group of carotenoids (1 g/L oil) and (+) -catechin, fisetin and quercetin from the group of flavonoids, were studied (1 mmol/kg oil). B-carotene and lycopene presented low antioxidant activity in emulsions, while polar carotenoids presented good antioxidant activity in the order of lutein, <b>paprika</b> and annatto <b>extracts.</b> The effect of concentration of <b>paprika</b> and bixin <b>extracts</b> (0. 25 - 1. 5 g/L oil) was studied. Antioxidant activity increased by increasing concentration up to 1 g/L, while higher concentration did not offer any additional protection. Among flavonoids, quercetin presented the best antioxidant activity followed by fisetin and (+) -catechin. Paprika, annatto and quercetin were microencapsulated in Na-CAS, but microencapsulation did not ameliorate their antioxidant activity in oil-in-water emulsions. ...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} the effect of some pre-harvest fungicides on growth and aflatoxins (AF) production of three A. flavus strains found in Capsicum powder. Each isolate, previously isolated from paprika, chilli and smoked paprika, was inoculated on Yeast Extract Sucrose agar and on a 3 % <b>paprika</b> <b>extract</b> agar medium supplemented with different fungicides and incubated at 20 and 30 ºC during 7 days. Growth measurements were obtained on the days 3, 5 and 7, and the AF production was determined on the day 7. The significance of the effects of the factors (strain, medium, temperature, time and fungicides) and their interaction over colony diameter and AF production was determined. Temperature constrained the effectiveness of fungicides in reducing growth, being the fungicides more effective at 20 ºC. The efficacy of the fungicides over AF production depended on the medium used and temperature. The most effective fungicides in inhibiting growth and AF production, regardless of the strain tested or applied conditions, were tebuconazole 25 % and mancozeb 80 % applied at a concentration of 0. 75 and 3. 5 g L- 1, respectively. Care should be taken in the choice of a suitable fungicide, because their effectiveness may depend on intraspecific variation and temperature. Moreover, it is necessary to take into account that not always the most efficient fungicide in reducing growth is the best choice for pre-harvest treatments, because it may promote AF production. Thus, the best fungicide is the one which can simultaneous prevent growth and AF production...|$|E
