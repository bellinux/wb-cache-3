Further, this project compares the history of Public-Private Partnerships in the U. S. Government with the United Kingdom (UK) Ministry of Defense (MOD). We intend to showcase the increased capabilities currently enjoyed by the UK MOD from entering into these agreements. Additionally, it will provide an in depth look of three Private Finance Initiatives (PFI) that Serco Inc. has undertaken and future prospects for the private financing technique. Finally, this analysis will evaluate the value for money gained by using Public-Private Partnerships through proper risk transfer in lieu of Full Up-Front Funding. The examination concludes that continued and expanded use of Public-Private Partnerships provides increased real time capability to DOD while supporting private industry. Public-Private Partnership agreements {{may not always be}} the most inexpensive means of procurement from a purely financial standpoint. However, this relationship provides several tangible real time benefits to the government and seeks to reduce the full life cycle cost. First and foremost, private relationships reallocate risk and up front capital requirements allowing the government to spread program cost over time. Freeing up the initial capital requirement affords the government the ability to acquire products and services with the limited resources provided in today''s austere budget environment. Finally, Public-Private Partnerships provide the government with an increased infrastructure and technological capability without having to allocate current year dollars for additional <b>property,</b> <b>plants,</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment</b> <b>and</b> unnecessary overhead.

40|$|Nowadays Italian listed and non listed {{companies}} adopt two distinct set of accounting principles. Starting from 2005 the mandatory adoption of IFRS for all {{listed companies}} stimulated a huge {{process of change}} which involves not only the technicalities about recognition, measurement and disclosure of accounting events, but also entails a cultural revolution in our accounting tradition developed through more than 100 years. In this paper are shown {{the findings of a}} research project whose purpose was to identify the most relevant impacts produced by IFRS adoption on company information systems and performance analysis and management. The basic research hypothesis is that the differences between domestic accounting principles and IFRS determine changes in company information systems. This changes involve the whole information production process: collection of data, manipulation and communication of information. Just as example we could think at impairment test: its application require the acquisition of conjectured information, from internal information sources i. e. the management information system, or from external sources. Moreover, as a second research hypothesis, IFRS adoption improve the company disclosure with a wider set of management information (i. e. about business combination, segmental reporting, or transactions with related parties) this should create a convergence tendency between external reporting with those required by internal users. The research was developed through a first step of deep analysis of both the theoretical contributions and the set of IFRS, in order to identify the range of possible implication induced on Italian listed companies, in their management control systems, information systems, and performance indicators. Afterwards the hypothesis about the implications of IFRS adoption have been tested employing the case studies technique. In brief the results show that {{only a limited number of}} IFRS generate significant implications on management control systems, because increase the diffusion of dimensions and indicators formerly not widely employed (at least on Italian context). Instead by the side of information systems is possible to determine more relevant implications caused by the introduction of new applications useful to produce the new set of mandatory information. Finally, a limited set of research hypothesis, not even confirmed by the empirical test, drew possibilities for IFRS adoption to stimulate changes on management information processes: for example the adoption of fair value accounting for <b>property,</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipments,</b> should produce consequences on product costing methodologies. The results don’t confirm this hypothesis, showing the existence of a kind of double track in elaboration processes which keep separate external from internal reporting: the former IFRS compliant, the second still connected with the traditional accounting principles.

40|$|Abstract: It is {{commonly}} {{accepted in the}} industrial organization literature that rate of return regulation leads to inefficient outcomes. Since prices are calculated so as to cover the regulated firm’s average cost, which includes the periodic fixed costs associated with <b>plant</b> <b>property</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipment,</b> the conventional argument is that prices must exceed the marginal cost of production. This paper examines the dynamic properties of the rate of return reg-ulation process when the regulated firm periodically undertakes new capacity investments. Our analysis identifies prices which can potentially emerge as equilibria of the regulation process. It is shown that the underlying accounting (depreciation) rules determine whether these equilibrium prices will be above, equal to, or below the long run marginal cost. We provide conditions under which the rate of return regulation process is dynamically stable so that prices indeed converge to their equilibrium values. ...|$|R

In countries where the threat of political extraction is higher, we hypothesize that firms hold a lower fraction of their assets in liquid form.

40|$|The {{application}} of international accounting policies {{is linked to}} the financial and economic information becoming more and more global. The current aim is to create a shared global language in order to guarantee homogeneity of information, transparency and comparability of data provided by companies. Within the IAS/IFRS financial statements the comparability is so important that it becomes one of the crucial requirements to meet in order to implement international accounting policies. The main topic of this research is the comparability of financial statements in terms of spatial and temporal dimension, taking into account both its content and form. The goal of the research is to theoretically estimate the level of achievement of spatial and temporal comparability within the IAS/IFRS system. Two aspects have been considered to analyse the level of comparability. First of all, the balance items have been analysed through relative accounting principles that include financial statement assets such as <b>properties,</b> <b>plants</b> <b>and</b> <b>equipments,</b> <b>property</b> investments, intangible assets and stakeholding. Within these assets, alternative criteria of valuation have been identified. Furthermore, through the analysis of both financial statement structure and content of field instructions we have shed light on the modes of presentation of these values. In addition to the theoretical analysis, an empirical approach has been applied to a congruous number of companies in order to investigate if the IAS financial statements are comparable both in terms of modes of presentation and valuation of balance items. For this reason, the financial statement documents of 2010 – 2012 of the Ftse Mib company members (excluding banking and insurance companies) have been analysed. Given the high level of capitalization and the significant and diverse number of stakeholders, these companies represent highly evolved financial communication. From a methodological prospective, the initial part of the research has been performed using a deductive method, followed by a descriptive approach related to the proposed models. Finally, an inductive 'zoom out' method has been adopted. As far as comparability content is concerned, currently, it is hard to state that the IAS/IFRS system has favoured financial statement comparability. This is because the system itself is highly permissive since it grants significant freedom of choice, regarding alternative valuation criteria, to the balance sheet editors. Given that a company has all IAS tangible assets (eight), only one type of property investments estimates a fair value. Taking into account all types of intangible assets (twelve) and three types of stakeholding, the total number of 'possible financial statements' according to the IAS/IFRS system would be 8. 388. 608 (B. P. = 2 k 1 × 1 k 2 × 2 k 3 × 2 k 4 = 28 × 11 × 212 × 23 = 223). As far as the form of comparability is concerned, the thorough examination of IAS 1 and IFRS 8 provides evidence for the lack of a reference scheme not only in terms financial statement summaries structure and content, but also in terms of availability of information to be given to the operating segments. The theoretical analysis shows that adopting IAS/FRS policies has not helped in guarateeing spatial and temporal financial statement comparability neither in form nor in content. The empirical approach showed that the examined companies have continued to act as previously done in the past, adopting all the same valuation criteria, the cost model, which is intrinsically related to the Italian accounting culture. This mode of action reveals 'resistance' of our biggest companies in accepting the new conceptual formulation of the IAS/IFRS system as they do not see the need of developing a new communication approach. From an empirical prospective, the comparability theory, in terms of content, does not function as the companies show convergent behaviour. However, it does not eliminate or reduce the problem of theoretical incomparability. As far as the form of financial statement compatibility is concerned, the theory is validated as the companies show proliferation of different behaviours...|$|R

Firms differ substantially in the composition of their deferred tax assets and liabilities. The largest components of deferred tax assets for sample firms are Loss and Credit Carryforwards and Employment and Post-employment Benefits.
