25|$|Even {{with oil}} market fluctuations, prices for {{gasoline}} in the United States {{are among the}} lowest in the industrialized world; this is principally due to lower taxes. While the sales <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> in Europe is more than twice that in the United States, the price of gas excluding taxes is nearly identical in the two areas.

Its assumption that big new oil discoveries would {{be made in the}} Arctic and off the Atlantic coast turned out to be incorrect. Petro-Canada has since abandoned all the wells Panarctic drilled, and the discoveries it did make off the Atlantic coast were fewer, more expensive, and took longer to develop than expected. Hibernia did not produce oil until 1997 and Terra Nova until 2002. The government also expected Petro-Canada to force down what it considered the high <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> to consumers, but Petro-Canada's oil production was more expensive and its oil refineries less efficient than those of the competing multi-national companies, and it found itself losing money on all aspects of the oil industry.|$|E

2500|$|... the United States was {{producing}} {{in excess of}} 11 billion liters (2.9 billion U.S. gallons) of recycled vegetable oil annually, mainly from industrial deep fryers in potato processing plants, snack food factories and fast food restaurants. [...] If all those 11 billion liters could be recycled and used to replace the energy equivalent amount of petroleum (an ideal case), almost 1% of US oil consumption could be offset. Use of used vegetable oil as a direct fuel competes with some other uses of the commodity, which has effects on its price as a fuel and increases its cost as an input to the other uses as well. Utilizing recycled vegetable oil {{as a replacement for}} standard petroleum-derived fuels like gasoline would reduce the <b>price</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> by preserving the supply of petroleum.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} recent {{proposals to}} alter distribution arrangements for gasoline within California. Specifically, these proposals would permit a company's branded dealer to obtain supplies from {{any point in}} its affiliated refiner's distribution network. Furthermore, the prices charged by refiners at each distribution point {{would be the same}} for dealers and distributors alike. In this analysis, we consider how the major oil companies would likely react to such changes, and how their expected reactions would affect the prices that California drivers pay for gasoline. For this purpose, we construct an economic model of a hypothetical distribution system that might arise if these proposals were enacted. The primary finding {{of this study is that}} imposing uniform prices on the leading refiners in California would lead to higher delivered <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline,</b> on average, than those found currently. This result follows from the presence of competitive markets in some local markets that would not otherwise exist.

40|$|The {{present study}} formalizes and quantifies the {{importance}} of uncertainty for investment in a corn-stover based cellulosic biofuel plant. Using a real options model we recover <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> that would trigger entry into the market and calculate the portion of that entry trigger price required to cover cost and the portion that corresponds to risk premium. We then discuss the effect of managerial flexibility on the entry risk premium and the <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> that would trigger mothballing, reactivation, and exit. Results show that the risk premium required by plants to enter the second-generation biofuel market {{is likely to be}} substantial. The analysis also reveals that a break-even approach (which ignores the portion <b>of</b> entry <b>price</b> composed <b>of</b> risk premium), and the traditional Marshallian approach (which ignores the portion <b>of</b> entry <b>price</b> composed <b>of</b> both the risk premium and the drift rate), would significantly underestimate the gasoline entry trigger price and the magnitude of that underestimation increases as both volatility and mean <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> <b>prices</b> increase. Results also uncover a great deal of hysteresis (i. e. a range <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> <b>prices</b> for which there is neither entry nor exit in the market) in entry/exit behavior by plants. Hysteresis increases as gasoline prices become more volatile. Hysteresis suggests that, at the industry level, positive (negative) demand shocks will {{have a significant impact on}} prices (production) and a limited impact on production (prices). In combination all of these results suggest that policies supporting second generation biofuels may have fallen short of their targets because of their failure to alleviate uncertainty. ...|$|R

40|$|A {{car is a}} {{relatively}} expensive and long-term purchase for a consumer. Its operating costs {{can be expected to}} {{play a significant role in}} purchase decisions. <b>Prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> and diesel fuels vary over time, and this makes diesel powered vehicles relatively more or less cost-efficient to operate depending on the <b>price</b> situation <b>of</b> fuels. In this thesis, it is investigated if a long run level relationship exists between consumer <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> and diesel, and proportions of diesels in three popular car models registered in Finland between 2005 and 2015. Also, the existing literature on car choice is reviewed to justify the expectation of such a relationship, and to identify any prior evidence of it. Existing models of car choice are commonly based on random utility theory, and employ discrete choice models in describing and predicting consumers’ car choices among a discrete set of alternatives. While operating costs are commonly included in car choice models, fuel prices themselves are more seldom considered. However, changing fuel prices may make a diesel model more cost-efficient to run if diesel is relatively cheap, which would theoretically lead to a bigger diesel share of cars purchased, assuming the decision maker acts rationally. An Autoregressive Distributed Lag with Bounds Testing method is used in this thesis to investigate if a long run level relationship between <b>prices</b> <b>of</b> <b>gasoline</b> and diesel, and diesel shares in three popular cars exists. The method is preferable to the type of setting in this thesis, where the time series may be stationary, non-stationary or cointegrated in the same equation. The car models chosen into the analysis are VW Golf, Toyota Avensis and Skoda Octavia, because these have been among the most popular cars during the focus period, and therefore a sufficient amount of data exists. It is found that in two out of three cars analyzed, the long run level relationship between fuel prices and diesel shares exists. Further, the direction of the effect is intuitively sound; higher gasoline price is associated with higher proportion of diesels in cars registered. The study finds moderate support for the theoretical expectation that fuel prices have a small but detectable effect on diesel shares of new cars...|$|R
