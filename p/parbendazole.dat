50|$|Ivermectin {{is highly}} {{effective}} {{even at the}} low dose of 100 μg per kg, and pyrantel is also effective at 25-50 mg per kg. Benzimidazoles such as mebendazole, <b>parbendazole</b> and thiabendazole are also highly effective.|$|E
40|$|We {{have shown}} that the {{benzimidazole}} carbamate, <b>parbendazole,</b> is a potent inhibitor of microtubule assembly in vitro and in vivo. Radiolabelled <b>parbendazole</b> was shown to bind to purified tubulin. Immunofluorescence studies using an antitubulin antibody showed that <b>parbendazole</b> effectively depolymerizes cytoplasmic microtubulues in animal cells leaving only one or two microtubules associated with one centriole. The usefulness of <b>parbendazole</b> and other benzimidazole carbamates as inhibitors of microtubule functions is discussed...|$|E
40|$|Osteoporosis is {{a common}} {{skeletal}} disorder characterized by low bone mass leading to increased bone fragility and fracture susceptibility. In this study, we have identified pathways that stimulate differentiation of bone forming osteoblasts from human mesenchymal stromal cells (hMSCs). Gene expression profiling was performed in hMSCs differentiated toward osteoblasts (at 6 h). Significantly regulated genes were analyzed in silico, and the Connectivity Map (CMap) was used to identify candidate bone stimulatory compounds. The signature of <b>parbendazole</b> matches the expression changes observed for osteogenic hMSCs. <b>Parbendazole</b> stimulates osteoblast differentiation as indicated by increased alkaline phosphatase activity, mineralization, and up-regulation of bone marker genes (alkaline phosphatase/ALPL, osteopontin/SPP 1, and bone sialoprotein II/IBSP) in {{a subset of the}} hMSC population resistant to the apoptotic effects of <b>parbendazole.</b> These osteogenic effects are independent of glucocorticoids because <b>parbendazole</b> does not up-regulate glucocorticoid receptor (GR) target genes and is not inhibited by the GR antagonist mifepristone. <b>Parbendazole</b> causes profound cytoskeletal changes including degradation of microtubules and increased focal adhesions. Stabilization of microtubules by pretreatment with Taxol inhibits osteoblast differentiation. <b>Parbendazole</b> up-regulates bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP- 2) gene expression and activity. Cotreatment with the BMP- 2 antagonist DMH 1 limits, but does not block, parbendazole-induced mineralization. Using the CMap we have identified a previously unidentified lineage-specific, bone anabolic compound, <b>parbendazole,</b> which induces osteogenic differentiation through a combination of cytoskeletal changes and increased BMP- 2 activity...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} the {{microtubule}} inhibitors colchicine, <b>parbendazole</b> and nocodazole on the growth of myxamoebae of Physarum polycephalum were closely paralleled by the {{effects of the}}se drugs on the assembly in vitro of purified amoebal microtubule protein. Colchicine at 100 microM did not inhibit amoebal growth and did not inhibit formation, or depolymerization, of amoebal microtubules. The benzimidazole carbamate derivatives nocodazole and <b>parbendazole</b> were very effective in both inhibiting growth and inhibiting the assembly in vitro of amoebal microtubule protein. <b>Parbendazole</b> was the most effective...|$|E
40|$|An {{experiment}} was undertaken {{to determine whether}} an overdose of the anthelmintic <b>parbendazole</b> could cause paralysis in lambs when given to ewes {{during the early stages}} of pregnancy. Out of a total of 68 lambs, born from ewes treated at various stages of gestation with <b>parbendazole</b> at 180 mg/kg, 5 showed the paralysis syndrome, 5 showed skeletal deformities, 2 were ataxic, while 1 foetus was aborted. The ewes giving birth to paralysed lambs had been treated with <b>parbendazole</b> at 30, 32, 37 and 53 days of gestation. Cerebral hypoplasia was observed in 2 of these lambs, while 2 others showed internal hydrocephaly. Histopathological lesions observed in the lambs with cerebral hypoplasia included gliosis and areas of encephalomalacia in the cerebral white matter. Lesions present in the spinal cords of the 2 ataxic lambs included pydromyelia, syringomyelia, duplication of the spinal canal and an abnormal position of the canal. This is the first report describing brain lesions in lambs {{as a result of an}} overdose of <b>parbendazole.</b> The articles have been scanned in colour with a HP Scanjet 5590; 600 dpi. Adobe Acrobat XI Pro was used to OCR the text and also for the merging and conversion to the final presentation PDF-format...|$|E
40|$|The mutant BEN 210 of Physarum polycephalum {{is highly}} {{resistant}} {{to a number}} of benzimidazole carbamate agents, including methylbenzimidazole- 2 -yl-carbamate and <b>parbendazole.</b> The resistance is conferred by the benD 210 mutation in a structural gene for beta-tubulin. This mutant allele encodes a beta-tubulin with novel electrophoretic mobility. We have used this strain to determine whether the mutant beta-tubulin is used in microtubules and whether this usage permits microtubule polymerisation in the presence of drugs both in vivo and in vitro. In vitro assembly studies of tubulin purified from the mutant strain have shown that microtubules are formed both in the absence of drugs and in all drug concentrations tested (up to 50 microM <b>parbendazole).</b> In contrast, the assembly of microtubules from wild-type tubulin in vitro is totally inhibited by 2 - 5 microM <b>parbendazole.</b> Thus the resistance of BEN 210 to <b>parbendazole</b> observed in vivo has been reproduced in vitro using tubulin purified from the mutant strain. Electrophoretic analysis of the microtubules formed in vitro has shown that both the wild-type and the mutant beta-tubulin are incorporated into the microtubules and that the proportion of mutant to wild-type beta-tubulin appears to remain constant with increasing drug concentration. This is the first demonstration of a single mutation in a tubulin structural gene causing an altered function of the gene product in vitro...|$|E

The transformation pathway was shown to be through the 4 -hydroxybutyl product to the 3 -carboxypropyl product. The reaction favored accumulation of the latter product...|$|E
40|$|Nine antimicrotubule {{benzimidazole}} derivatives {{tested in}} a Pneumocystis carinii culture system with human embryonic lung fibroblast monolayers inhibited organism proliferation. The concentrations of drugs inhibitory in culture ranged from 10 to 0. 1 micrograms/ml, with thiabendazole being the least effective (10 micrograms/ml) and <b>parbendazole</b> being the most effective (0. 1 microgram/ml). The parent compound, benzimidazole, was inactive at 10 micrograms/ml. Demonstration that this group of compounds has activity against P. carinii provides a new potential target that can be exploited, the microtubules. Also, the variability in {{the effectiveness of the}} compounds provides the basis for studies of structure-activity relationships, which were initiated in this study...|$|E
40|$|Comparative {{investigations}} of the chemotherapeutic activity of various filaricidal compounds and other anthelmintics were made with Litomosoides carinii infections in Mastomys natalensis, special consideration being given to the microfilaricidal activity of the compounds. Diethylcarbamazine, cyclohexanecarboxylic acid-N-methylpiperazide citrate (HOE 28637 a), tetrahydropyranecarboxylic acid-N-methylpiperazide citrate (HOE 29691 a), (±) -tetramisole, (-) -tetramisole (levamisole), and metrifonate proved highly effective against microfilariae whereas gentian violet, methylene violet, and the anthelmintics metyridine, disophenol, pyrantel tartrate, methylpyrantel tartrate and <b>parbendazole</b> showed no, or only inadequate, activity. The usefulness of L. carinii infections in M. natalensis is discussed and is recommended {{as a model for}} chemotherapeutic screening tests and for the quantitative evaluation of microfilaricidal activity...|$|E
40|$|A major {{metabolite}} of ciclobendazole (methyl 5 -cyclopropylcarbonyl- 2 -benzimidazolecarba-mate) excreted in the urine, bile, and feces of rats was methyl 5 -cyclopropylcarbonyl- 6 -hydroxy-benzimidazolecarbamate, {{established by}} {{comparison of the}} proton magnetic resonance and mass spectra {{with that of the}} authentic compound. This compound represented 8. 2 % and 7. 1 % of the dose, respectively, in extracts of 24 -hr urine and 48 -hr feces samples of rats, but was only a minor metabolite in dog urine (1 % of the dose). The unchanged drug was only detected in dog feces, the major route of excretion of radioactivity in the dog. 5 -Cyclopropylcarbonyl- 2 -amino-benzimidazole was present in rat urine (2. 5 % of the dose). A major metabolite in dog bile was probably 5 -cyclopropylcarbinol- 2 -aminobenzimidazole, formed by loss of the methoxycarbonyl group and reduction of the carbonyl function in the 5 -position. Ciclobendazole (methyl 5 -cyclopropylcarbonyl- 2 -benzimidazolecarbamate) is a new broad-spec-trum benzimidazole anthelmintic related to me-bendazole (1) and <b>parbendazole</b> (2). This pape...|$|E
40|$|Fourty-four stomach worms were {{detected}} from the vomituses of two cats, a 1 -year-old mongrel femalc (cat No. 1) and a 6 -month-old mongrel female (cat No. 2) and one dog, 3 -month-old male cairn terrier, which {{were living in}} Suginami-ku and Nerima-ku, Tokyo. Morphological findings and mcasurements of intact worms were given in Figs. 1 - 12 and Table 1. From these findings, these were identified as adult Physaloptera pracputialis von Linstow, 1889. In Japan, P. Praeputialis detected from the dog is the first record and those from cats are the second case. No clinical signs were noted throughout the observation period in this study except for the vomiting observed transiently. Medication of <b>parbendazole</b> at 30 mg/kg of body weight for 2 or 3 days to these thress infected animals was seemed to be effective for adult P. praeputialis, since the vomiting of stomach worms disappeared after anthelminthic treatment, {{in contrast with the}} failure of piperazine phosphatc treatment...|$|E
