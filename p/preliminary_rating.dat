A destructive tornado tracked across the region with severe damage in several communities including houses destroyed in communities such as Bridgeton, Ferguson, Florissant, Hazelwood, Maryland Heights and New Melle. Lambert-St. Louis International Airport was hard hit with severe damage to numerous facilities there and injuries reported. Windows were blown out of the terminals there and airplanes were flipped in the field.

40|$|International audienceExtreme {{regions in}} the feature space are of {{particular}} concern for anomaly detection: anomalies {{are likely to be}} located in the tails, whereas data scarcity in such regions makes it difficult to distinguish between large normal instances and anomalies. This paper presents an unsupervised algorithm for anomaly detection in extreme regions. We propose a Minimum Volume set (MV-set) approach relying on multivariate extreme value theory. This framework includes a canonical pre-processing step, which addresses the issue of output sensitivity to standardization choices. The resulting data representation on the sphere highlights the dependence structure of the extremal observations. Anomaly detection is then cast as a MV-set estimation problem on the sphere, where volume is measured by the spherical measure and mass refers to the angular measure. An anomaly then corresponds to an unusual observation given that one of its variables is large. A <b>preliminary</b> <b>rate</b> bound analysis is carried out for the learning method we introduce and its computational advantages are discussed and illustrated by numerical experiments...|$|R

40|$|It is {{commonly}} agreed {{that one of}} the major goals in the devel-opment of modern text-to-speech synthesis is the improvement of prosody, especially intonation. Although high quality intonation is an important factor on the way to more natural synthetic speech, it is seldom scrutinized empirically whether and how this affects the relative performance of other components, such as segmental synthesis. The present paper discusses two <b>preliminary</b> <b>rating</b> ex-periments inquiring into the relation between the naturalness of intonation and subjective segmental quality in Finnish. Experi-ment 1 showed that the perception of intonation is dependent on the segmental quality. More crucially, Experiment 2 indicated that also the perceived segmental acceptability is significantly depen-dent on the relative naturalness of intonation. In light of the present observations, the goal of improved intonation is not only desirable for the overall quality’s sake alone, but it is also shown to improve even the subjective perception of a very basic feature of synthetic speech such as segmental acceptability. 1...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop a rating tool for policy makers to prioritize breast cancer interventions in low- and middle- income countries (LMICs), based on a simple multi-criteria decision analysis (MCDA) approach. The definition and identification of criteria play a key role in MCDA, and our rating tool could be used as part of a broader priority setting exercise in a local setting. This tool may contribute to a more transparent priority-setting process and fairer decision-making in future breast cancer policy development. METHODS: First, an expert panel (n = 5) discussed key considerations for tool development. A literature review followed to inventory all relevant criteria and construct an initial set of criteria. A Delphi study was then performed and questionnaires used to discuss a final list of criteria with clear definitions and potential scoring scales. For this Delphi study, multiple breast cancer policy and priority-setting experts from different LMICs were selected and invited by the World Health Organization. Fifteen international experts participated in all three Delphi rounds to assess and evaluate each criterion. RESULTS: This study resulted in a <b>preliminary</b> <b>rating</b> tool for assessing breast cancer interventions in LMICs. The tool consists of 10 carefully crafted criteria (effectiveness, quality of the evidence, magnitude of individual health impact, acceptability, cost-effectiveness, technical complexity, affordability, safety, geographical coverage, and accessibility), with clear definitions and potential scoring scales. CONCLUSIONS: This study describes the development of a rating tool to assess breast cancer interventions in LMICs. Our tool can offer supporting knowledge for the use or development of rating tools as part of a broader (MCDA based) priority setting exercise in local settings. Further steps for improving the tool are proposed and should lead to its useful adoption in LMICs...|$|E

40|$|The gorgonian Paramuricea clavata is a {{characteristic}} macrofaunal specie of the Western Mediterranean benthos, {{especially of the}} circalittoral community. Their typical shrub-like colonies {{are to be found}} ranged perpendicularly against the prevailing water current and in conditions of darkness. It is a species perfectly adapted to its habitat, where it competes for the available space with other benthic species. P.

40|$|In {{recent years}} {{attention}} towards underground cables (UGCs) has been {{stimulated by the}} development and performance enhancement of XLPE-insulated cables at HV and EHV level. The liberalisation of the energy market with the related need to connect new power plants and strengthen the grid, in conjunction with public opposition {{to the construction of}} new overhead lines, are increasingly prompting the installation of underground HV and EHV a. c transmission lines. The possibility of integrating power transmission and other services (i. e. railway and highway transport, bridges, galleries) in the same corridor or in the same "structure" is another significant technical challenge favouring underground technologies. This field has been advocated by Cigré which has investigated the topic by means of several working groups [1 - 4]. The paper analyzes some issues related to the electrical behaviour of long EHV a. c. cable lines both in steady-state and in transient conditions. In particular, the paper deals with the choice of the shunt reactive compensation degree from a twofold standpoint, that is, steady-state operation and network transients. The capability charts are a useful tool for highlighting the steady-state operating characteristics of a cable link, giving an immediate outlook of admissible active and reactive power flows along the link. The same charts also show regimes associated to undesirable voltages, and can be used to estimate the needed shunt compensation. The size of shunt compensation, lumped and equally shared at cable line terminals, can be evaluated in closed-form, based on steady-state line no-load energization/load rejection constraints. The paper points out that the rated line- and cable-charging breaking current of standard EHV circuit breakers should be checked as it may set significant minimum shunt compensation requirements, even in powerful meshed networks. It is also of interest to perform transient analyses of the cable line, aimed at verifying shunt reactor <b>preliminary</b> <b>rating</b> and determine other required characteristics of shunt reactors. With the increasing use of cables in the EHV network the likelihood of low-order harmonic resonance, owing to the large cable capacitance, is becoming of more concern. The low order harmonic resonance can give rise to temporary overvoltages, dangerous to line apparatuses due to their sustained nature. Notably, the energy absorption withstand capability of commonly adopted surge arresters can be exceeded. The paper shows that the feasibility of a long UGC line depends, besides the steady-state operation, on its interaction with the network in various operating conditions...|$|E
