The detector is similar to previous types of silicon PIN detectors where the fully depleted body of the wafer comprises the intrinsic region of the PIN structure. The novel aspect of this detector is that the one surface is divided into a 2 D array of pixels, and that the collected holes are divided between a row and a column collector in each pixel, yielding both dimensions of position information from this side of the detector.

Post-dry-etching treatments have been developed employing a rapid thermal anneal, followed by a series of Br-, H 2 SO 4 -, and HF-based cleaning processes. Transmission electron microscopy analysis shows no apparent sidewall damage, which could cause high leakage currents. Scanning electron microscopy shows sidewall etch by-product removal and ridge CD maintenance after the wet cleaning processes. Very low leakage currents, comparable to those observed in damage-free wet-etched waveguides, were achieved using the RIE or ICP etches, followed by the combination of post dry-etch treatments. I-V measurements were used to provide a quick feedback of sidewall quality and a sensitive method for evaluating the level of damage in these devices as compared to other analytical techniques...|$|R
