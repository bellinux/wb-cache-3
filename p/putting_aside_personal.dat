40|$|To avoid misguidance from {{calls for}} more routine {{practice}} (nontrial) carotid angioplasty/stenting (CAS), we need to distinguish relevant facts and patients’ best interests from all else (distractions). A recent editorial by White and Jaff is one publication which illustrates this need particularly well. First, these authors are correct in reminding us that the responsibility of physicians is to provide best patient care, <b>putting</b> <b>aside</b> <b>personal</b> interest. This is inherent in any profession. However, misconception, bias, and conflict of interest exist. Therefore, healthcare payment organizations, such as the US Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services are important gatekeepers to facilitate patient access to interventions {{that are likely to}} help them, as opposed to all others...|$|E
40|$|The {{central theme}} {{discussed}} here {{is of the}} contrasting discourse of ‘top down’ government initiatives in recruitment and retention of Black and Minority Ethnic (BME) social work students and a grassroots, community based initiative. The discourse of the former tends to recognise and work with difference, <b>putting</b> <b>aside</b> <b>personal</b> prejudice {{and the provision of}} support to people who are ‘different’. Whereas, the discourse of the latter has a propensity to challenge institutional racism, foster partnership between education providers, community groups and networks within the local voluntary sector and draws from a strengths-based black community development model. A starting point for this paper is the understanding that the nature of language of inclusion of people from BME communities in social work education either reflects and reinforces, or challenges the power relationships embedded in these arenas. We contrast the language and approaches of top down government policies with a grassroots community project to identify opportunities and challenges in these differing approaches. To contextualise this conversation, we draw on the work of Harris (2003), who traces the unfolding discourse of social work education from the late 1970 s to early 21 st Century...|$|E

500|$|Histories {{during the}} Soviet era raised {{the battle to}} a mythic contest with serious {{political}} overtones and had Kutuzov as the master tactician on the battlefield, directing every move with the precision of a ballet master directing his troupe. Kutuzov's abilities on the battlefield were, {{in the eyes of}} his contemporaries and fellow Russian generals, far more complex and often described in less than flattering terms. Noted author and historian David G. Chandler writing in 1966, echoes the Soviet era Russian histories in more than a few ways, asserting that General Kutuzov remained in control of the battle throughout, ordered counter-moves to Napoleon's tactics personally rather than Bagration and Barclay doing so and <b>put</b> <b>aside</b> <b>personal</b> differences to overcome the dispositional mistakes of the Russian army. Nor is the tent scene played out; instead Kutuzov remains with the army. Chandler also has the Russian army in much better shape moving to secondary prepared positions and seriously considering attacking the next day.

40|$|In this paper, I {{compare the}} {{positions}} of two iconoclasts {{on the brink of}} death, Antigone in Sophocles’ Antigone and Socrates in Plato’s Apology, as well as their motivations for addressing the public while facing execution, examining controversial lines from both works. First I assay Antigone’s final lament, focusing on her statement that she would not bestow the same burial honors on a husband or child as she did for her brother (lines 967 - 970). This is followed by an analysis of Socrates’ defense speech, focusing on his claim to be the wisest human living (23 b). I study the contexts of age, honor, political astuteness, and the direct conflict between interests of the State and those of the individual, and I inspect the type and level of impact these have on the aforementioned speeches. I speculate that the human fear of death causes both Antigone and Socrates to temporarily <b>put</b> <b>aside</b> <b>personal</b> motivations and assume the interests of the State in order to sway their respective audiences. Finally, I show that the unflattering portraits Antigone and Socrates create of themselves are not the result of personal flaws but rather their inexperience with public appeal and their ultimate inability, amidst fear, to move the common people...|$|R

One attempt to resolve the conflict is to explore the conflict of data; data analysis conflicts find alternative conflict resolution priorities. This study aims to analyze the factors triggering of religious conflict and conflict vulnerable magnitude index in underdeveloped areas. The research methodology used is a quantitative method of descriptive statistical approaches and qualitative methods. The data used is the conflict in 2011 to 2013 of 8 (eight) districts. The results, based on the accumulation of eight districts showed that the biggest cause of conflict is in the brawl at 22. 50, politics in 9. 00, and the beatings of 3. 75. For the lowest score indicated that the religious conflicts of 0. 30, ethnic conflict of 0. 60 and for conflict over natural resources of 0. 90.

This is the first reason why you should submit to him. Yuan Shao is militarily more powerful. You have less troops than him, so even if you join him, he won't regard you highly. Cao Cao has less troops. If you join him, he'll be delighted. This is the second reason why you should submit to him.
