50|$|Roskopf {{was granted}} US patent No. 75,463 10 Mar. 1868, for a {{changeable}} escapement for watches (this patent {{said that the}} escapement could be adapted for use with a cylinder or lever {{as well as a}} pin pallet). Roskopf patented his watch in France with French patent No. 80611 of 25 Mar. 1868 for a watch with a type of <b>platform</b> <b>escapement.</b> He patented his designs in several countries (Belgium, No. 21988, 3 Aug. 1867) but never in Switzerland, because Switzerland did not yet have a patenting system, and because the idea had been used there before his use of it.|$|E
5000|$|A {{carriage}} {{clock is}} a small, spring-driven clock, designed for travelling, {{developed in the}} early 19th century in France, where they were also known as [...] "Officers' Clocks". The first carriage clock was invented by Abraham-Louis Breguet for the Emperor Napoleon in 1812. The case, usually plain or gilt-brass, is rectangular with a carrying handle and often set with glass or more rarely enamel or porcelain panels. A feature of carriage clocks is the <b>platform</b> <b>escapement,</b> sometimes visible through a glazed aperture {{on the top of}} the case. Carriage clocks use a balance and balance spring for timekeeping and replaced the larger pendulum bracket clock. The factory of Armand Couaillet, in Saint-Nicolas d'Aliermont (France) made thousands of carriage clocks between 1880 and 1920.|$|E
5000|$|The Manufacture's {{reputation}} {{defined it}} {{as both the}} leader and a reference in escapements. The company's annual production of <b>platform</b> <b>escapements</b> gradually increased over two decades, culminating at 200,000 <b>platform</b> <b>escapements</b> in 1889—nothing short of exceptional for the time! ...|$|R
50|$|Keen {{to enrich}} its savoir-faire, the L’Epée Manufacture started {{producing}} <b>platform</b> <b>escapements</b> for prestigious alarm clocks and carriage clocks from 1850. This {{was a key}} {{turning point in the}} company's development.|$|R
5000|$|By {{this time}} {{the idea of the}} Roskopf-type watch was {{becoming}} popular in Switzerland and a number of Swiss companies began making [...] "Roskopf" [...] watches. In order to be really cheap, the watches had to be machine mass manufactured as much as possible. These watches had pin-pallet <b>escapements</b> rather than <b>platform</b> <b>escapements.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Just {{seven years}} after {{launching}} this new line of business, L’Epée submitted its first patents to the authorities to establish and protect its expertise. The Manufacture won recognition throughout the clock making world for its high-quality <b>platform</b> <b>escapements,</b> several of which presented highly specific systems that were very useful at the time, placing the company {{at the forefront of}} the horological scene. Some of these patents, such as those protecting the [...] "anti-knocking" [...] system, the [...] "auto-starting" [...] mechanism, and the constant-force escapement, made a lasting impression on their era.|$|R
