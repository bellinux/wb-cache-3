5000|$|The Cornsay Colliery, {{worked by}} Messrs. Ferens and Love, was first opened out in 1868, and is {{situated}} within the township of Cornsay, {{but in this}} parish. There are four seams, the whole of which are worked by drifts into the hillsides. The 'Harvey' is 2 feet 8 inches thick; the 'Ballarat' 1 foot 9 inches; the 'Five Quarter' 2 feet 2 inches to 3 feet 6 inches, and the Main coal is 3 feet. The names of the drifts are Low Drift, High Drift, Colpike Drift, and Ford Drift, which give a daily output amounting to 750 tons, about the half of which is converted into coke on the spot, there being 270 ovens. A great feature of this pit is that it yields a splendid fire-clay, which supplies the rather extensive brick, tile, and sanitary <b>pipe-works</b> {{in connection with the}} colliery. It is contemplated by the owners to lay down plant for the manufacture of glazed, sanitary, and other ware, for which the clay is so well adapted. This colliery in its various departments gives employment to an average of 700 men and boys. The royalties worked, besides a large area of freehold owned by themselves, are leased from Ushaw College, the Ecclesiastical Commissioners, and Miss Taylor-Smith. Hamsteels Collieries and Coke Ovens were commenced in 1867 by Messrs. R. S. Johnson and T. M. Reay, and are now carried on under the title of 'The Owners of Hamsteels Collieries.' There are four seams met and worked, 'The Brockwell' having an average thickness of 3 feet 6 inches; the 'Upper Busty' 1 foot 8 inches; the 'Lower Busty' 2 feet 4 inches; and the [...] "Harvey" [...] about 3 feet 8 inches. The latter seam, which was drifted in 1890, is not of equal quality to the others. There are two shafts 35 and 20 fathoms, as well as three drifts, giving a total yearly output of (when fully working) 280,000 tons. Three-fourths of this output is converted into coke on the spot. This colliery gives employment in its various branches to 680 men and boys. At Malton, coal has also been wrought since 1870, the Malton being in that year opened by Mr. G. Love. It is now worked by S. A. Sadler, Esq., of Middlesbrough. The Harvey, Brockwell, and Busty seams are met here, and worked by drifts, the thickness of the seams ranging from two to four feet. Patent ovens and other important improvements are rapidly developing, and ere long this colliery will employ a large number of men.Cornsay Colliery is a populous village situated on a hillside on the north bank of the Dearness, seven miles and a half west of Durham, and two miles west of Esh. It is partly in the township of Esh, and partly in that of Cornsay, the road which runs through the village being the boundary.Hamsteels is another colliery village a little to the south of Quebec, and occupied chiefly by the officials of the colliery which, with its coke ovens and shops, lies just below. From the hill above this village, a fine prospect of great extent along the valleys of the Dearness and Browney is obtained.Quebec, which derives its name from a farmhouse close by, is on the road between Esh and Lanchester, one and a half miles west of the former, and two and a half south by east of the latter. Here dwell most of the employees of the Hamsteels colliery, and here also is the church, the schools, and Wesleyan and Primitive chapels.Malton is a small colliery village, about {{a mile and a half}} from Quebec. Coal has been worked here for some time, but only in a small way up to the present; there is, however, every prospect of this becoming a large and populous colliery village, as preparations are being made to open out what promises to be a large coal royalty.The Church is a small plain stone building in the Early English style, built in 1875. It was originally built as a school-chapel, but was at the formation of the parish converted into a church. It will seat about 300. The living is a vicarage valued at £300 per year, in the gift of the crown and bishop alternately, and held by the Rev. Francis G. Wesley, M.A. There are about twenty acres of glebe.The Vicarage, a substantial brick residence, stands a little to the south-west of the church, within two acres of ground, on the Cornsay road, and was built in 1890, at a cost of nearly £2000.The Wesleyan Methodist Chapel is a neat stone building of Gothic style, erected in 1873 at a cost of £750, to seat 400. The colliery proprietors gave £150 in addition to the site.The Primitive Chapel, also of stone, was built in 1875, and will accommodate 300. The cost was £600, in addition to site, which with £150 was given by colliery owners.The Methodist New Connexion have a chapel at Cornsay Colliery, which was originally built for the day school by the colliery owners, but becoming too small, it was given to this body, who fitted it internally to seat 400.The National School is at Quebec village on the north side of the road, upon the site of the old Roman road. It is a stone building, built about 1875, with mixed and infants' departments, having a total accommodation for 240 children.St. Charles' Catholic School, at Cornsay Colliery, was built in 1874, and is a brick building with accommodation for about 220. Attached to this school is a house for the master.The British School, Cornsay Colliery, is a good building of brick, built in 1876 by the colliery proprietors. It is for mixed and infants, with accommodation for 400 in all, and is fully attended.The Temperance Hall is a building with a seating capacity of about 300, and is well adapted for public entertainments, having a stage and ante-room.|$|R

5000|$|During the {{restoration}} of the theater, a vintage pipe organ was purchased and installed to replace the original theatre organ, which had been sold earlier. The current organ is the largest theatre pipe organ in Michigan's Upper Peninsula. The organ, consisting of three manuals and 21 ranks (sets of pipes), was originally built in 1927 by the M. P. Moller Company of Hagerstown, Maryland. There are more than 1,600 pipes, installed in the on-stage chambers, ranging in size from half an inch to over 16 feet in length. In addition, there is an assortment of actual tuned percussions, drums, and sound effects installed in two chambers, located {{on either side of the}} proscenium.

50|$|It {{is unusual}} for the general water {{velocity}} in a system to be so high that impingement attack occurs throughout {{the whole of the}} copper pipework. More commonly, the velocity is just sufficiently low for satisfactory protective films to be formed and to remain in position on most of the system, with impingement damage more likely to occur where there is an abrupt change in the direction of water flow giving rise to a high degree of turbulence, such as at tee pieces and elbow fittings. It is not generally realised how great an effect small obstructions can have on the flow pattern of water in a <b>pipe-work</b> system {{and the extent to which}} they can induce turbulence and cause corrosion-erosion. For example, it is most important, as far as possible, to ensure that copper tubes cut with a tube cutter are deburred before making the joint. Also a gap between the tube end and the stop in the fitting, due to the tube not having been cut to the correct length and fully inserted into the socket of the fitting, can also induce turbulence in the water stream.|$|E

40|$|In bioturbated {{reservoir}} facies, ichnology {{is integral}} to reservoir characterization. Ichnological analysis of a reservoir facies and subsequent classification into ichnofabrics or ichnofacies allows for characterization of reservoir properties. Bioturbation can redistribute grains and cause sorting or mixing, this physical modification of the primary sedimentary fabric causes changes to porosity, and permeability in reservoir facies. In highly bioturbated reservoir facies, bioturbation can be the first order control on petrophysical properties. [...] Petroleum geologists are primarily concerned with the effect that bioturbation has on the petrophysical properties of a reservoir facies, rather than the details of ichnotaxonomic identification. The proposed bioturbation style categories do not require in-depth knowledge of ichnology. The categories can easily be applied to facies and core analysis for incorporation into reservoir models. The action of bioturbators can be considered in terms of: 1) sediment mixing; 2) sediment cleaning; 3) sediment packing; 4) <b>pipe-work</b> building strategies; 5) combination sediment cleaning and packing; and 6) combination <b>pipe-work</b> building and sediment packing. Sediment packing and sediment mixing styles commonly reduce porosity/permeability, while sediment cleaning bioturbation style enhances porosity/permeability. <b>Pipe-work</b> building and combination bioturbation styles are highly dependent on the lithological contrast between burrow fill, and enclosing substrate. The use of bioturbation style categories, and the classification of trace fossils into these categories may be more user-friendly for reservoir geologists than existing paleoenvironmentally-driven ichnofacies or ichnofabric analysis. [...] While categorization of bioturbation style is a useful tool in reservoir characterization, lateral variations in reservoir quality and heterogeneity of ichnofacies or ichnofabric must be incorporated into geological models in order to predict fluid flow in bioturbated facies at the inter-well scale. Ichnological analysis allows insight into variations in sedimentation rate, hydrodynamic energy (erosive currents), substrate consistency, length of colonization window, and community succession (tiering and cross-cutting relationships). This ichnological dataset means that inferences regarding both physical and chemical processes acting {{at the time of}} bioturbation can be made. [...] There is inherent ichnological variability within most bioturbated beds. The lateral variability, or patchiness of the ichnofabrics studied were not found to be related to proximity to the paleo-shoreline in the three wave-dominated depositional systems. Instead, the most critical factor appears to be the sediment accumulation style. Slow continuous deposition was found to produce complex and highly patchy ichnofabrics, whereas rapid, episodic, event bed deposition was found {{to be associated with the}} most uniform development of ichnofabric. [...] Autocylic and allocyclic interpretations can be postulated for bioturbated key stratigraphic surfaces in siliciclastic shallow marine settings. A case study illustrating the need for careful ichnological analysis has been undertaken as part of this thesis, and focuses on Thalassinoides, and its validity as an indicator for key stratigraphic surfaces. Thalassinoides is easily identified in core and outcrop, has a <b>pipe-work</b> bioturbation style, and colonizes a variety of substrates including softground and firmground (Glossifungites ichnofacies) substrates. The Glossifungites ichnofacies is commonly found in association with relative sea level change, but alternative autocyclically-generated processes should be considered. With careful ichnological investigation, realistic palaeoenvironmental and sequence stratigraphic interpretations can be made by objective consideration of both autocyclic and allocyclic processes. [...] This research uses bioturbated shallow marine case studies to create a first order understanding of likely reservoir quality, reservoir heterogeneity, and interpretation of candidate key sequence stratigraphic surfaces. These concepts are an integral part of reservoir to basin scale models of hydrocarbon reservoirs. With an improved, integrated, understanding of what bioturbating organisms do to sediment, ichnology can continue to grow as an important component of reservoir characterization studies, and petroleum geology in general...|$|E

Finite element modeling approaches are being increasingly employed by engineers to predict welding residual stresses. However, such predictions are challenging owing to the innate complexity of the welding process (Hurrell et al., Development of Weld Modelling Guidelines in the UK, Proceedings of the ASME Pressure Vessels and Piping Conference, Prague, Czech Republic, July 26 – 30, 2009, pp. 481 – 489).

These industrial activities may result in significant radioactive contamination of (by-) products, wastes and plant installations. In this study, scale samples were collected from a decommissioned phosphoric acid processing plant. To determine the nature and concentration of NORM retained in <b>pipe-work</b> and associated process plant, four main areas of the site were investigated: (1) the 'Green Acid Plant', where crude acid was concentrated; (2) the green acid storage tanks; (3) the Purified White Acid (PWA) plant, where inorganic impurities were removed; and (4) the solid waste, disposed of on-site as landfill. The scale samples predominantly comprise the following: fluorides (e. g. ralstonite); calcium sulphate (e. g. gypsum); and an assemblage of mixed fluorides and phosphates (e. g. iron fluoride hydrate, calcium phosphate), respectively. The radioactive inventory is dominated by U- 238 and its decay chain products, and significant fractionation along the series occurs. Compared to the feedstock ore, elevated concentrations (<= 8. 8 Bq/g) of U- 238 Were found to be retained in installations where the process stream was rich in fluorides and phosphates. In addition, enriched levels (<= 11 Bq/g) of Ra- 226 were found in association with precipitates of calcium sulphate. Water extraction tests indicate that many of the scales and waste contain significantly soluble materials and readily release radioactivity into solution. (c) 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{research}} is to find an improved method of predicting the failure behavior of Glass Reinforced Epoxy (GRE) <b>pipe-work</b> at long times under complex stress states which include a combination of internal pressure and axial load. The procedure currently used to qualify GRE tubing (as in ISO 19464 and ASTM 2992) is expensive and time-consuming, as it involves constant pressure stress-rupture tests, carried out over a period of more than 15 months. If the design of pipe is changed the procedure needs to be repeated. Another problem is that the current method only quantifies the behavior accurately when the pipe is under pure hydrostatic stress. The technique used to allow for the effect of axial loads can be quite inaccurate. The present work will attempt to develop a more effective method of predicting long term failure behavior under combinations of internal pressure and axial load. New models will be developed to quantify the growth of pipe wall damage that occurs under these conditions. An important question to be answered is whether or not there are stress levels below which no damage takes place and whether these stress levels would form a suitable basis for design. To date a novel type of pipe test specimen has been developed, which will enable the pipe to be easily subjected to combinations of internal pressure and axial load.

40|$|Thick walled {{pressure}} vessels are of considerable importance {{in a wide}} range of industries. The evaluation of stresses is necessary not only from a design point of view but also for fitness for service analysis of ageing infrastructure. The accumulation of creep–fatigue damage over time is the principal damage mechanism which will eventually lead to crack initiation in critical high temperature fossil plants. Many power stations are being subjected to two-shift operation due to changes in demand and competition from cheaper energy sources, and in the future from added carbon taxes. To assess high temperature components for creep–fatigue damage for example, under faster ramp rates and additional cycles, as a first pass it would be useful to explore the feasible operational envelope using simplified calculations. These are, however, generally not available and more complex finite element analysis is necessary. This paper uses a simplified closed form solution for metastable thermal stresses in thick walled {{pressure vessels}}. This form of solution can if necessary be used with either stress concentration factors or superposition of polynomials for more complex components derived from FEA analysis, such that the closed form solution can be used to estimate any ramp rate on the unit. In this case the ramp rates are considered to provide sufficient time to become metastable. Many existing units rely on heavy section 2. 25 Cr 1 Mo steel (P 22) <b>pipe-work</b> and tubing, and hence for two shifting can be subjected to high levels of cyclic strain. Based on the simplified expression developed, an operational envelope is explored for thick walled cylinders constructed using P 22 steel. Creep–fatigue damage is calculated based on the R 5 methodology. The analysis shows that for thick walled components with minimal stress concentrations, creep will dominate the life of the component. However, complex interaction between base rupture, onset of significant cycling, creep, and fatigue dictates the upper bound on feasible ramp rates, as a result it is possible to construct screening curves based on the effective elastic stress intensity range. © 2010, Elsevier Ltd...|$|E
40|$|The {{channel flow}} method has {{established}} the net dissolution kinetics of calcite single crystals at high pH (7. 7 - 9. 7) and varying bulk Ca 2 + concentrations (0 - 10 mM), using wide ranges of solution flow rates (10 - 3 - 0. 3 cm 3 s - 1). Literature rate equations were in poor agreement with experiment. Modelling {{with the following}} mechanism, where Ca 2 + and CO 3 2 - undergo Langmuirian adsorption: Ca 2 + (aq) ⇄ Ca 2 + (ads) CO 2 - 3 (aq) ⇄ CO 2 - 3 (ads) Ca(sup> 2 + (ads) + CO 2 - 3 (ads) ⇄ CaCO 3 (ads) CaCo 3 (ads) → CaCo 3 (lattice) and the consequent rate law J net /mol cm - 2 s - 1 = k p K Ca K CO 3 { K sp - [Ca 2 +] o [CO 2 - 3] o _________________________________________________________________________________________________ (1 + K Ca [Ca 2 +] o) (1 + K CO 3 [CO 2 - 3] o) gave excellent agreement with experiment under all conditions studied. This mechanism is shown to explain all literature streaming potential, electrophoresis and kinetic salt effect data. Dissolution of calcite under the above conditions was strongly inhibited by Mg 2 + and fully deprotonated forms of succinic acid, 2 -sulphobutanedioic acid, phthalic acid and maleic acid. Mechanisms were established; for the maleate dianion, the inhibition {{was due to the}} blocking of the dissolution sites at which CaCO 3 units are incorporated into the crystal lattice. For the other ions, inhibition arose from competitive Langmuirian adsorption either between CO 3 2 - and the anions, or between Ca 2 + and Mg 2 +. A new method to quantify the inhibited dissolution of particulate CaCO 3 (= 10 μm) via enhanced mass transport of solution to the rotating disc electrode, due to the rotation of the particles in the diffusion layer, has been established. Good agreement was found with that measured independently using the channel flow cell. A. c. impedance spectroscopy has been used to characterise scaled (CaCO 3) steel tubes. Results provide scope for (i) monitoring scale growth, and (ii) use in safety control devices for alerting to the scaling of <b>pipe-work.</b> </p...|$|E
40|$|Archaeology shares {{some common}} safety {{concerns}} with other trenching operations such as grave digging and pipe laying. Foremost amongst {{these are the}} dangers of work-ing in unshored or inadequately shored excavations. It is not uncommon far archaeological excavations {{to be more than}} 1. 5 m deep and deep shafts 4 - 6 m deep have occa-sionally been dug (e. g. at Devils Lair, Koonalda Cave, Malakunanja 11 and Mushroom Rock). Shoring has been used in some cases. For instance, Jones used it in his excavations at Rocky Cape in 1 % 5 - 67 (R. Jones pers. comm.), at Nauwalabila 1 in 1981 (Jones and Johnson 1985) and most recently at Allens Cave (R. Jones and S. Cane p m. comm.). Dortch installed an internal scaf-folding of <b>pipe-work</b> and heavy duty timber shoring in the deep trench at Devils Lair (Dortch 1984). Sim used a series of nested prefabricated boxes in her excavations on King Island (Sim and Thorne 1990) and Horton and Wright used timber soldier sets in trenches at Trinkey (Wright pers. comm.). These however are the exceptions and it is still all too rare for shoring to be used on prehis-toric sites. The usual practice is to install some form of shoring only when deposits are demonstrably loose and unconsolidated or where slumping or fretting of the sec-tions is actively taking p k e. In cases where shoring has been used there is also some question as to whether it has been adequately engineered for the lateral stresses that would be imposed should the trench fail catastrophically. Many of us are reluctant to shore because it is seen as time-consuming, expensive and it interferes with access to the faces of an excavation. This is exacerbated by the fact that most Australian-trained field archaeologists lack dir-ect experience in the proper installation of shoring and that the industrial shoring equipment available for hire (e. g. acrow props, drag boxes, steel sheet pilings and trench linings) is clearly not suitable for most archaeologi-cal applications. However, excavating in deep unshored trenches is a form of 'Russian roulette ' in which we stake our lives on a rather casual assessment that the trench walls will continue to be self-supporting. Sooner or later a trench wall will fail and without the safety margin p m vided by shoring, someone will be killed (cf. Haywar...|$|E
