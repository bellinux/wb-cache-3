It proposed major high-speed railway lines going towards Europe via Russia and Kazakhstan and another through the Middle East via Tajikistan, a potential future member for the union. China has signed numerous energy deals with Russia and Kazakhstan, as it tries to move from coal to less <b>pollutant</b> alternatives.|$|E
50|$|<b>Pollutants</b> can be {{described}} as gasses, aerosols, liquids, or solids that have a chemical reaction with any part of a painting. There are three types of <b>pollutants.</b> Airborne <b>pollutants,</b> <b>pollutants</b> transferred by contact, and intrinsic <b>pollutants.</b>|$|R
40|$|Indentifying <b>pollutants</b> {{that pose}} a {{potential}} hazard indoors {{is an important}} first step to reducing risks. We reviewed key published studies reporting measurements of chemical <b>pollutants</b> in residences. Summary results were compiled and used to calculate representative mid-range and upper-bound concentrations relevant to chronic exposures for over 300 <b>pollutants</b> and peak concentrations relevant to acute exposures for a few episodic activity-associated <b>pollutants.</b> For the over 100 <b>pollutants</b> with available criterions, the measured concentrations are compared to available chronic and acute health-hazard standards and guidelines. Fifteen <b>pollutants</b> are identified as potential chronic or acute health hazards for many homes.

5|$|As a white-rot fungus, Panellus stipticus {{contains}} {{enzymes that}} {{are able to}} break down lignin, a complex aromatic polymer in wood that is highly resistant to degradation by conventional enzyme systems. The major enzyme that initiates the cleavage of hydrocarbon rings is laccase, which catalyzes the addition of a hydroxyl group to phenolic compounds (polyphenols). The ring can then be opened between the two adjacent carbon atoms that bear the hydroxyl groups. White-rot fungi are being investigated scientifically for their potential use in the bioremediation of land contaminated by organic pollutants, and to convert industrial wastes rich in toxic polyphenols. Panellus stipticus has been shown to reduce the phenolic concentration of waste water produced by olive-processing plantsâ€”an environmental concern in many Mediterranean countries. In this study, a liquid culture of P.stipticus mycelia reduced the initial concentration of phenolic compounds by 42% after a 31-day incubation period. In a separate study, a P.stipticus culture was able to effectively degrade the environmental <b>pollutant</b> 2,7-dichlorodibenzo-p-dioxin, a polychlorinated dioxin.|$|E
5|$|Caesium {{compounds}} {{are rarely}} encountered by most people, but most caesium compounds are mildly toxic. Like rubidium, caesium tends to substitute potassium in the body, but is significantly larger {{and is therefore}} a poorer substitute. Excess caesium can lead to hypokalemia, arrythmia, and acute cardiac arrest, but such amounts would not ordinarily be encountered in natural sources. As such, caesium {{is not a major}} chemical environmental <b>pollutant.</b> The median lethal dose (LD50) value for caesium chloride in mice is 2.3g per kilogram, which is comparable to the LD50 values of potassium chloride and sodium chloride. Caesium chloride has been promoted as an alternative cancer therapy, but has been linked to the deaths of over 50 patients, on whom it was used as part of a scientifically unvalidated cancer treatment.|$|E
5|$|Lead is {{a common}} {{environmental}} <b>pollutant.</b> Causes of environmental contamination include industrial use of lead, such as is found in facilities that process lead-acid batteries or produce lead wire or pipes, and metal recycling and foundries. Children living near facilities that process lead, such as lead smelters, {{have been found to}} have unusually high blood lead levels. In August 2009, parents rioted in China after lead poisoning was found in nearly 2000 children living near zinc and manganese smelters. Lead exposure can occur from contact with lead in air, household dust, soil, water, and commercial products. Leaded gasoline has also been linked to increases in lead pollution. Some research has suggested a link between leaded gasoline and crime rates. Man made lead pollution has been elevated in the air for the past 2000 years. Lead pollution in the air is entirely due to human activity (mining and smelting).|$|E

Transported emissions include primary <b>pollutants</b> emitted from industry and vehicles (e. g., nitric oxide) and natural <b>pollutants</b> emitted from forest fires (e. g., soot). Also secondary <b>pollutants</b> (e. g., ozone) that are formed near the source region undergo transport.

5000|$|The Clean Air Act {{requires}} the US EPA to regulate six common <b>pollutants.</b> These air <b>pollutants</b> (also known as [...] "criteria pollutants") are found {{all over the}} United States. They are particle pollution, ground-level ozone, carbon monoxide, sulfur oxides, nitrogen oxides, and lead. All of these <b>pollutants</b> {{have been shown to}} have adverse health and environmental impacts and some can cause property damage. Of the six <b>pollutants,</b> particle pollution and ground-level ozone are the most widespread health threats.

5|$|Like {{other animals}} {{at the highest}} trophic levels, the killer whale is {{particularly}} at risk of poisoning from bioaccumulation of toxins, including polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs). European harbor seals have problems in reproductive and immune functions associated {{with high levels of}} PCBs and related contaminants, and a survey off the Washington coast found PCB levels in killer whales were higher than levels that had caused health problems in harbor seals. Blubber samples in the Norwegian Arctic show higher levels of PCBs, pesticides and brominated flame-retardants than in polar bears. When food is scarce, killer whales metabolize blubber for energy, which increases <b>pollutant</b> concentrations in their blood.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the return}} flows do not issue {{directly}} back into the Snake River, but rather feed the Snake River Aquifer underneath the Snake River Plain. Water diverted from the river for irrigation, after absorbing any surface pollutants, re-enters the ground and feeds the aquifer. Although the aquifer has maintained its level, {{it has become increasingly}} laced with contaminants. Water in the aquifer eventually travels to {{the west side of the}} Snake River Plain and re-enters the river as springs. Throughout much of the Snake River Plain and Hells Canyon, excessive sediment is also a recurring problem. In December 2007, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) issued a permit requiring owners of fish farms along the Snake River to reduce their phosphorus discharge by 40%. <b>Pollutant</b> levels in Hells Canyon upstream of the Salmon River confluence, including that of water temperature, dissolved nutrients, and sediment, are required to meet certain levels.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic puffin {{and other}} pelagic birds are {{excellent}} bioindicators {{of the environment}} as they occupy a high trophic level. Heavy metals and other pollutants are concentrated through the food chain and, as fish are the primary food source for Atlantic puffins, there is great potential for them to bioaccumulate heavy metals such as mercury and arsenic. Measurements can be made on eggs, feathers or internal organs and beached bird surveys, accompanied by chemical analysis of feathers, can be effective indicators of marine pollution by lipophilic substances as well as metals. In fact these surveys {{can be used to}} provide evidence of the adverse effects of a particular <b>pollutant,</b> using fingerprinting techniques to provide evidence suitable for the prosecution of offenders.|$|E

5|$|When {{high levels}} of {{phosphorus}} and mercury were discovered in the waterways in 1986, water quality became a focus for water management agencies. Costly and lengthy court battles were waged between various government entities to determine {{who was responsible for}} monitoring and enforcing water quality standards. Governor Lawton Chiles proposed a bill that determined which agencies would have that responsibility, and set deadlines for <b>pollutant</b> levels to decrease in water. Initially the bill was criticized by conservation groups for not being strict enough on polluters, but the Everglades Forever Act was passed in 1994. Since then, the South Florida Water Management District (SFWMD) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers have surpassed expectations for achieving lower phosphorus levels.|$|E

Plants {{are able to}} contain, store, potentially break down, and stimulate microorganisms in the soil to break down certain <b>pollutants.</b> With phytoremediation the main challenge is the growth of plants in soil contaminated with organic <b>pollutants</b> and inorganic <b>pollutants</b> such as heavy metals. In this endophytes assist plants in converting <b>pollutants</b> into less biologically harmful forms such as breaking down TCE of PAHs in their metabolic pathways, and assist plants in tolerating higher levels of soil contamination with <b>pollutants</b> such as toluene.|$|R

25|$|Air {{pollution}} risk {{is a function}} of the hazard of the <b>pollutant</b> and the exposure to that <b>pollutant.</b> Air pollution exposure can be expressed for an individual, for certain groups (e.g. neighborhoods or children living in a country), or for entire populations. For example, one may want to calculate the exposure to a hazardous air <b>pollutant</b> for a geographic area, which includes the various microenvironments and age groups. This can be calculated as an inhalation exposure. This would account for daily exposure in various settings (e.g. different indoor micro-environments and outdoor locations). The exposure needs to include different age and other demographic groups, especially infants, children, pregnant women and other sensitive subpopulations. The exposure to an air <b>pollutant</b> must integrate the concentrations of the air <b>pollutant</b> with respect to the time spent in each setting and the respective inhalation rates for each subgroup for each specific time that the subgroup is in the setting and engaged in particular activities (playing, cooking, reading, working, etc.). For example, a small child's inhalation rate will be less than that of an adult. A child engaged in vigorous exercise will have a higher respiration rate than the same child in a sedentary activity. The daily exposure, then, needs to reflect the time spent in each micro-environmental setting and the type of activities in these settings. The air <b>pollutant</b> concentration in each microactivity/microenvironmental setting is summed to indicate the exposure.|$|E
