25|$|In 2000, Coles Myer CEO Dennis Eck, {{faced with}} lower sales and profits from Myer and Grace Bros. stores took the {{department}} stores down market, reducing service levels, increasing stock volumes on the selling floor and introducing product {{to appeal to}} younger consumers. In doing so, he ended up replicating the approach of another of Coles Myer's chains, Target. The resulting effect included reduced customer visits and reduced units sold <b>per</b> <b>transaction.</b> In 2001, Coles Myer set about to reposition the store to appeal to customers lost in the down market experiment.|$|E

Revenue from the securities transaction tax and the futures transaction tax was about €2.4 billion in 2009. The major part of this revenue came from the taxation of bonds and stocks (96.5%).

25|$|There are varying rules {{within these}} categories, {{for example the}} amount possessed, the role played in the {{transaction}} and {{the intent of the}} goods. Regarding coffee shops, the line between law and practice thins. A coffee shop is a heavily controlled business establishment where individuals can purchase a personal dose of soft drugs in the form of joints, pastry, drinks and packages. In theory illegal, these shops must abide by governmental and local regulations, as well as meet the AHOJ-G criteria, an acronym for: No Advertising, Hard drugs, Nuisance of any kind, Jongeren (minors under 18), and a limit of five grams <b>per</b> <b>transaction.</b> Additionally, the maximum stock at any time is five hundred grams. Local governments may impose additional rules, such as closing times, zoning (coffee shops may not be close to schools), and parking restrictions. The rationale behind coffee shops is to keep citizens away from the hard drugs scene, bringing them to a safe, social, and regulated environment.|$|E
25|$|Merchants that accept {{credit cards}} must pay {{interchange}} fees and discount fees on all credit-card transactions. In some cases merchants are barred by their credit agreements from passing these fees directly to credit card customers, or from setting a minimum transaction amount (no longer prohibited in the United States, United Kingdom or Australia). The {{result is that}} merchants are induced to charge all customers (including {{those who do not}} use credit cards) higher prices to cover the fees on credit card transactions. The inducement can be strong because the merchant's fee is a percentage of the sale price, which has a disproportionate effect on the profitability of businesses that have predominantly credit card transactions, unless compensated for by raising prices generally. In the United States in 2008 credit card companies collected a total of $48 billion in interchange fees, or an average of $427 per family, with an average fee rate of about 2% <b>per</b> <b>transaction.</b>|$|E

[...] In 2008, the group found themselves in the midst of what The Daily Telegraph called a [...] "ticketing scandal"; scalpers tried to sell a A$19 ticket on eBay for almost A$2,000 and a set of three tickets for A$315 for concerts in Melbourne, and a group of three tickets to a Wiggles UNICEF charity concert in Sydney had a price tag of A$510.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this project was to analyze {{reference}} transaction data {{in order to support}} decisions for optimizing staffing at the reference desks in Olin and Uris Libraries. Data about reference transactions have been compiled for over a year in the RSRS system. Using a subset of the RSRS data, this report presents charts and tables of the number of transactions that were submitted by hour, day of week, week, and month over a one-year period. Transaction category, duration, mode, and staff data are reported. Some limitations of the data and recommendations for further research are discussed. Olin and Uris Library reference desks sees the most traffic during the fall and spring semesters (fall more than spring), early in the work week and at midday hours. Olin Library reported an average of 636 <b>transactions</b> <b>per</b> week during the fall semester, 500 <b>transactions</b> <b>per</b> week during the spring semester, and an average of 321 <b>transactions</b> <b>per</b> week during the summer break.

2500|$|In {{the view}} of Friedman the social {{responsibility}} of business is to increase its profits only, thus, {{it needs to be}} examined whether business in BoP markets is capable of achieving the dual objective of making a profit while serving the poorest of consumers and contributing to development? Erik Simanis has reported that the model has a fatal flaw. According to Erik [...] "Despite achieving healthy penetration rates of 5% to 10% in four test markets, for instance, Procter & Gamble couldn't generate a competitive return on its Pur water-purification powder after launching the product on a large scale in 2001...DuPont ran into similar problems with a venture piloted from 2006 to 2008 in Andhra Pradesh, India, by its subsidiary Solae, a global manufacturer of soy protein ... Because the high costs of doing business among the very poor demand a high contribution <b>per</b> <b>transaction,</b> companies must embrace the reality that high margins and price points aren't just a top-of-the-pyramid phenomenon; they're also a necessity for ensuring sustainable businesses {{at the bottom of the}} pyramid." [...] Marc Gunther states that [...] "The bottom-of-the-pyramid (BOP) market leader, arguably, is Unilever ... Its signature BOP product is Pureit, a countertop water-purification system sold in India, Africa and Latin America. It's saving lives, but it's not making money for shareholders." [...] This [...] leaves the ideal of eradicating poverty through profits or with a good business sense – not a sense of do-gooding rather questionable.|$|E
2500|$|By {{using the}} StubHub website, a buyer may select from {{available}} tickets to an event. StubHub charges buyers {{a fee of}} 10% {{of the purchase price}} of the tickets (minimum $5 <b>per</b> <b>transaction).</b> [...] A shipping and handling charge is then imposed (minimum $4.95) and tickets are either shipped via UPS, email delivered, available for instant download, or picked up the day of the event at a last-minute services office. In total, on a typical order, StubHub earns 20-25% of the purchase price of every ticket sold: buyers typically pay 10% more than the listed price and sellers receive 10-15% less than their listed price depending on certain seller metrics and bonuses. Criteria for reduced seller fees include confirm time, fill rate, and quarterly sales totals. [...] Additional seller incentives include the ability to buy tickets without paying service fees. If a buyer fails to win the ticket, StubHub will help the buyer find alternative tickets. [...] StubHub does not prohibit sellers from listing tickets for any amount, regardless of how absurd the amount might be, but posts the prices at which tickets have sold. [...] A September 2012 Toronto Blue Jays at Tampa Bay Rays game had tickets listed for $52,122, nearly 1000 times the face value of the tickets. Ticket prices for the 2009 Super Bowl averaged $2,500. To increase delivery rate, StubHub uses Goodmail's CertifiedEmail. It promises to refund the price of any ticket that fails to reach a buyer by FedEx. StubHub and MyStoreRewards have been described as examples of [...] "applications that leverage the PayPal platform in creative ways".|$|E

It is also possible to purchase 'Combi' tickets valid on Dublin Bus and Luas. DART and Luas 'Combi' tickets have been produced since Luas opened but despite this being a major ticket option these LUAS-DART Combis are not available at either ticket newsagents or online from either Iarnród Éireann or Luas, nor are they available in Luas vending machines. They are available only from Iarnród Éireann ticket offices. Transport user lobby groups like 'Rail Users Ireland' have written to both Luas and Iarnród Éireann asking for an explanation for this and none has been forthcoming. [...] While it is also possible to purchase Luas-DART-Dublin Bus triple combi tickets (from Iarnród Éireann booking offices) from monthly ramblers upward, these are often more expensive than simply topping up a Leap card to its weekly cap rate (currently €40 for Adults). Certain ticket combinations are not possible (for example a one-day student ticket), and tickets can only be valid from the stop at which they are purchased and must commence their validity within 90 minutes, valid until a specific time shown on the card. Certain tickets require the user to hold an ID card and write the number on the ticket, to prevent the ticket from being transferred to another person.
