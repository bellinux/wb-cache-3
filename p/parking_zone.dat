5|$|A 2009 study {{conducted}} by the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration found that crashes involving pedestrians and bicyclists have higher incidence rates for hybrid electric vehicles than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles in low-speed vehicle maneuvers such as reversing or leaving a <b>parking</b> <b>zone.</b> These accidents commonly occurred in zones with low speed limits, during daytime and in clear weather. The study found that a HEV was two {{times more likely to be}} involved in a pedestrian crash than was a conventional ICE vehicle when a vehicle is slowing or stopping, backing up, or entering or leaving a parking space. Vehicle maneuvers were grouped in one category considering those maneuvers that might have occurred at very low speeds where the difference between the sound levels produced by the hybrid versus ICE vehicle is the greatest. Also the study found that the incidence rate of pedestrian crashes in scenarios when vehicles make a turn was significantly higher for HEVs when compared to ICE vehicles. Similarly, The NHTSA study also concluded that the incidence rate of bicyclist crashes involving HEVs for the same kind of maneuvers was significantly higher when compared to conventional vehicles.|$|E
25|$|Parking fees {{had been}} {{listed as a}} major {{deterrent}} to downtown shopping on the Eugene Mall. In 1973 the city created a free <b>parking</b> <b>zone</b> around the mall that included 2200 spaces with no time limits. Effects on retail sales from the free <b>parking</b> <b>zone</b> may have been marginal, and the plan further limited city revenue.

25|$|PA {{has several}} hundred employees, {{most of whom}} have been brought into the town from Leeds and London, at this {{building}} and others in the town. The local public transport facilities have proved inadequate for many staff who commute, as much of the work is done round the clock. This has led to considerable strain being put on Howden's parking facilities, leading {{to the creation of a}} Controlled <b>Parking</b> <b>Zone</b> embracing most of the central area of the town.|$|E

40|$|Possibility {{of parking}} {{plays a role}} in {{deciding}} where to go and the driver where to purchase goods and services. In sectors such as trade, hotels, catering, transport and storage is likely that some percentage of these drivers will form. The paper tries to explain whether the introduction of paid <b>parking</b> <b>zones</b> will affect the growth of businesses in these sectors since the introduction of paid <b>parking</b> <b>zones</b> receive visitors "theoretical" chance to park, compared to locations where paid <b>parking</b> <b>zones</b> are not. Work with the help of least-squares could not determine whether this hypothesis is true in parts of Prague 3 and 7, which introduced paid <b>parking</b> <b>zones</b> in 2008. The model appeared generally statistically insignificant, which can not be concluded whether the introduction of paid <b>parking</b> <b>zones</b> will lead to greater development of businesses in sectors such as trade, hotels, catering, transport and storage in the city of Prague 3 and...|$|R

2500|$|Modernisation work in {{the early}} 21st century has {{included}} the replacement of all windows with double glazing, a new heating system, rewiring and improvements to the drains. A planning application was made in 2011 to convert some of the landscaped area {{in front of the}} almshouses into a gravel car park for up to ten vehicles. Parking in the area had long been a problem: a [...] "controlled parking zone" [...] was put in place on Northgate Road in 2002, limiting parking to 16 spaces. [...] The almshouses were excluded from this because few residents had cars and Crawley town centre was considered close enough to be accessible: it is [...] away. Subsequently, four parking permits were granted for almshouse residents, and some visitor permits were allocated as well—but this facility was taken away in 2010 because of increasing demand for spaces. Extension of the adjacent Three Bridges controlled <b>parking</b> <b>zone</b> was discussed as an alternative.|$|E
