50|$|The {{shell of}} the cupola, being usually made of steel, has {{refractory}} brick and <b>plastic</b> <b>refractory</b> patching material lining it. The bottom is lined {{in a similar manner}} but often a clay and sand mixture ("bod") may be used, as this lining is temporary. Finely divided coal ("sea coal") can be mixed with the clay lining so when heated the coal decomposes and the bod becomes slightly friable, easing the opening up of the tap holes. The bottom lining is compressed or 'rammed' against the bottom doors. Some cupolas are fitted with cooling jackets to keep the sides cool and with oxygen injection to make the coke fire burn hotter.|$|E
40|$|This paper, on {{the sands}} of Minnesota, is a report of an {{investigation}} begun in 1918, {{at a time when}} there was a great demand for information about local molding sands. as a result of the traffic situation that made it difficult or impossible to obtain sands from sources that had previously supplied them. The inquiry, which was in charge of Mr. G. N. Knapp, showed that Minnesota contains an abundance of sands for founding nearly all products. equal to, or better than, the sands that had been imported. Part of the information embodied in the report was placed at the disposal of the metal founders as soon as it became available, either verbally or by means of mimeographed sheets. The field work showed also that molding materials are more widely spread over the state than was supposed. and a fairly comprehensive reconnaissance was made of a considerable part of Minnesota. Materials gathered from widely separated sources were tested in the laboratory and some were tested by founders in their plants. Minnesota contains an abundance of foundry sands and all materials commonly used for making molds in foundries of iron, steel, brass, and aluminum, except possibly a highly <b>plastic</b> <b>refractory</b> clay. An economic bulletin such as this is chiefly utilitarian. It should show the nature of materials used, the tests made to ascertain the value of the materials, and the distribution of the materials in the state. These subjects are taken up separately in this bulletin and the geologic and geographic distribution are discussed in some detail. The report does not contain a geologic map. To have included such a map would have resulted in duplication...|$|E
40|$|Representative {{samples of}} fire clay from Bansi area, District Mirzapur, U. P., were studied by {{chemical}} analysis, X-ray diffraction and differential thermal analysis, mechanical analysis, and measurement of physical char-acteristics. From the field {{relations and the}} laboratory data, the clays are inferred to have a sedimentary origin. The mineralogy is simple. The data are clearly diagnostic. Quartz was the predominant non-clay mineral with cristobalite, feldspar and mica. The clay fraction consisted of only kaolinite. The name flint clay has been suggested for them. It has further been concluded that the clay is a poorly <b>plastic</b> <b>refractory</b> {{and can be used}} for the manufacture of high-heat fire brick by the proper blending. ItlSTORY OF GEOLOGIC INVESTIGATION •V[UKTI NATH (12) gave a brief reference of the clay deposits in Bansi in the district Mirzapur froln the Barakar formations of Gondwana system and reported an outcrop of 100 feet in length, respectively, froln the places. Later F. Ahamad (1) while carrying out drilling for coal deposits noticed the extensive nature of fire clay in the Makrikhoh area. A team of the Directorate of Geology & Mining, U. P. consisting of J. N. Singh and Prem Swarup visited the areas in 1956, 1957 and 1958 for a reconnaissance survey, collection of clay samples and detailed work for assess-ment of the deposits. Subsequently this work was extended in 1961 - 62 when exploratory trenching and collection of representative bulk samples (14) was carried out. GEOLOGY The Talchir series and lower part of the Damuda series belonging to the lower Gondwanas ystem of India are exposed in this area in the following sequence...|$|E

40|$|With {{the advent}} of the space age, new {{adjustments}} in technical thinking and engineering experience are necessary. There is an increasing and extensive interest in the utilization of materials for components to be used at temperatures ranging from - 423 to over 3500 deg F. This paper presents a description of the materials problems associated with the various components of chemical liquid rocket systems. These components include cooled and uncooled thrust chambers, injectors, turbine drive systems, propellant tanks, and cryogenic propellant containers. In addition to materials limitations associated with these components, suggested research approaches for improving materials properties are made. Materials such as high-temperature alloys, cermets, carbides, nonferrous alloys, <b>plastics,</b> <b>refractory</b> metals, and porous materials are considered...|$|R

40|$|Raising of problem. Currently of {{particular}} relevance {{was given to}} the matter of introduction in manufacture of building materials and products, resource-saving techniques and technologies; integrated use of raw materials and materials that prevent or significantly reduce their harmful impact on the environment. This allows you to recycle hundreds of thousands of tons of the fiery liquid slags of silicon manganese and to develop effective structural materials that can replace metals, non-metallic building materials of natural origin, concretes, cast stone, <b>plastics</b> and <b>refractories.</b> Purpose. The study of the structure and properties of building materials and products from electric furnace slag of silicon manganese. Conclusion. Slags from the smelting of silicon manganese are classified as acidic. Their lime factor is in the range of 0. 47 – 0. 52. The composition of the slag located in the heterogeneous region SiO 2 near the line of separation of cristobalite spread to the crystallization of wollastonite, according to the ternary system MnO-CaO-SiO 2, which in consideration of their stability, allows the development of technology of building materials (gravel, sand, granulated slag, etc.) and products (foundation blocks, road slabs, containers for transportation and storage of hazardous waste, and others) ...|$|R
40|$|A {{refractory}} {{protective coat}} has been devel-oped that greatly reduces scale formation and {{is capable of}} lowering sandblasted casting roughness 30 to 50 %. When applied as a thin film to the refractory model, it remains as a tacky base which will fix wax and <b>plastic.</b> A new <b>refractory</b> protective coating has been developed {{for use in the}} preparation of partial denture castings. The coating tech-nique entails the application of a slurry of very fine grained zircon (ZrSiO 4) in a solu-tion of methylene chloride and zirconium octoate. Dip coatings are prepared on the refractory cast or model and/or the "engi-neered " wax pattern. When properly ap-plied, this coating eliminates or greatly re-duces scale formation, reduces sandblasted casting roughness, and provides an adhesive base for the attachment of plastic and wax preforms to the refractory cast. It particu-larly differs from currently used industrial zircon coats and dental-investment "protec-tive coats " in having a zirconium octoate binder acting as an adhesive base for the attachment of plastic and wax to the refrac-tory model. In addition, the coating is less brittle after application, is more refractory, and may be applied in less thick consistency, resulting in a thinner coating. This investigation is part of the dental research pro-gram conducted by the National Bureau of Standards in cooperation with the American Dental Association...|$|R
