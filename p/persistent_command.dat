Most common editing operations are quickly and naturally accomplished with the point-and-click interface, which also functions inside the command window. This latter fact allows commands to be edited (and resubmitted) just as any other text, a function inherited from the DMD 5620 terminal interface.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{considers}} China's state {{capacity and}} changing governance as revealed through its policies to tackle unemployment. Despite {{high levels of}} growth, economic restructuring has resulted in rising unemployment over the last decade. The Chinese state {{has been able to}} manage job losses from state enterprises, demonstrating some state capacity in relation to this sector and some <b>persistent</b> <b>command</b> economy governance mechanisms. However both design and implementation of policies to compensate and assist particular groups among the unemployed have been shaped by weak state capacity in several other areas. First, capacity to gather accurate employment data is limited, meaning local and central governments do not have a good understanding of the extent and nature of unemployment. Second, the sustainability of supposedly mandatory unemployment insurance schemes is threatened by poor capacity to enforce participation. Third, poor central state capacity to ensure local governments implement policies effectively leads to poor unemployment insurance fund capacity, resulting in provision for only a narrow segment of the unemployed and low quality employment services. Although the adoption of unemployment insurance (and its extension to employers and employees in the private sector), the introduction of a Labour Contract Law in 2007, and the delivery of employment services by private businesses indicate a shift towards the use of new governance mechanisms based on entitlement, contract and private sector delivery of public-sector goods, that shift is undermined by poor state capacity in relation to some of these new mechanisms...|$|E
30|$|The middle ware is {{implemented}} in Java and running on remote VPS on the Czech backbone network datacenter as Linux service used CentOS 6. Development corresponds with Rapid Application Development; therefore, Object Relation Mapping suites Java Persistent Api technology, which {{is provided by}} EclipseLink 2.3. 2. as a data mapper and allows fast and comprehensive data management. The data objects are defined in Java classes, and relations between entities are expressed {{as members of a}} concrete class with specific annotation, specific cardinality and type of relation. The objects are transformed to the database through <b>persistent</b> <b>commands,</b> and after a commitment, they are saved to a hard file on a disk. Database engine is used in object database ObjectDB for its excellent performance which is running on the same server as the service. Tomcat is used as a web server with dynamic web module that allows Servlet 3.0 annotations directly into classes instead of configuration file web.xml. Consumer requests are served over HTTP request/response by JSON due to the simple and fast remote data access, which is used by a web client or Java console. For web service, [28] used a Representational State Transfer technology, which provides fast, comprehensive, and well-maintainable implementation, and allows multidata-type output assembled by simple annotation.|$|R

5000|$|GhostNet (...) is {{the name}} given by {{researchers}} at the Information Warfare Monitor to a large-scale cyber spying operation discovered in March 2009. The operation is likely associated with an Advanced <b>Persistent</b> Threat. Its <b>command</b> and control infrastructure is based mainly in the People's Republic of China and has infiltrated high-value political, economic and media locations in 103 countries. Computer systems belonging to embassies, foreign ministries and other government offices, and the Dalai Lama's Tibetan exile centers in India, London and New York City were compromised.|$|R
5000|$|World War II Online is a massively {{multiplayer}} online first-person shooter (MMOFPS) video game. It {{was released}} on June 6, 2001, for Microsoft Windows, with a Mac OS version being released in 3Q 2002. The game is set in 1940-1943 World War II Europe. It is a virtual battlefield, a combined arms war simulation. A player can command or crew a variety of accurately modeled aircraft, armored fighting vehicles, anti-tank guns, anti-aircraft artillery, and three naval vessels, or fight as a foot-soldier {{with a variety of}} infantry weapons. The game is played in real time alongside or against other players as German, US, British and French forces in a <b>persistent</b> world. <b>Command</b> structures and missions provide strategic and tactical layers while ranks provide a RPG layer by demonstrating leadership roles. WWIIOL online uses a ½ scale map of Western Europe with [...] of accurate terrain (800 m resolution satellite data). It is commonly recognized as the first MMOFPS. World War II Online was re-released in 2006 under the new name of World War II Online: Battleground Europe.|$|R

I also used this proposal to address a couple of other issues that have been brought to my attention {{in the last couple of}} weeks. Proposed additions to the ADC- 2 standard are shown in blue text; proposed deletions are shown in red crossed out text. 3. 1 Bridging reservation problem Subclause 4. 2. 3. 2 in ADC- 2 states that the local SMC device server shall process reservation and <b>persistent</b> reservation <b>commands</b> that it receives and shall not pass them through to the remote SMC device server. The justification behind this requirement is that only the local SMC device server can distinguish the true I_T nexus which is required to support the reservation. The Remote SMC device server can only see the I_T nexus consisting of the ports that establish the link between the DT device and the library, typically a pair of ADT ports. A problem arises when the library enables multiple ports to access the same device server and at least one of them is a bridged port. In other words, the library enables bridging in more than one DT device to a single remote SMC device server. Or, the library enables bridging in a DT device to a remote SM...|$|R
40|$|The International Dance Day {{is celebrated}} every {{year as a}} {{self-expression}} since dances belong to the world. Jarog dance was created to facilitate {{children with special needs}} in order to celebrate the International Dance Day in Surakarta in 2013. The research method applied was data collection consisting of observation, interview and documentation. The data analysis was the narrative one by using qualitative approach. The research result shows that Jarog is a new creation dance which combines Jaranan dance and Reog dance. The main functions of Jarog dance are character education, entertainment, and self-confidence improvement. <b>Persistent</b> learning, special <b>commands</b> by beating kendhang loudly and raising hands highly in every movement change and the rhythm of the instruments supporting the dance are needed. There were internal and external factors which support and obstruct the dance performance. The internal supporting factors were motivation, identification, sympathy and audience’s interest, while the external supporting factors were the influence of the world recognition, the motto ”Solo Berseri”, and the development of technology. The obstructing internal factors were the difficulties in practicing and adapting the movement, gendhing which was memorized easily, the beats of kendhang and other instruments which should have been louder. The external obstructing factors were the time-consuming rehearsal which interfered the children’s study hours, less attention from their parents, and the poor cooperation with the supporting karawitan musicians...|$|R
