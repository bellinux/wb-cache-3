Erasmus in Adnotationes to Acts 27:16 wrote that according to the Codex from the Library Pontifici (i.e. Codex Vaticanus) name of the island is καυδα (Cauda), not κλαυδα (Clauda) as in his Novum Testamentum (Tamet si quidam admonent in codice Graeco pontificiae bibliothecae scriptum haberi, καυδα, id est, cauda). In another letter sent to Erasmus in 1534 Sepúlveda informed him, that Greek manuscripts were altered from the Vulgate.|$|E

500|$|While some of {{the costumes}} for the New York shoot were {{prepared}} ahead of time, much of the costuming was done in New York, and the costumes for the episode received an Emmy Award nomination. Costume designer Lou Eyrich revealed that {{the plan was to}} have the costuming be a [...] "little nod" [...] to the [...] "iconic New York <b>places</b> <b>we</b> were going to shoot", and with a [...] "little bit of '50s, '60s flair", but not too [...] "vintage". She said, [...] "We landed in New York on a Saturday night, shopped all day Sunday, threw them in the clothes" [...] for the filming that began on Monday. According to an article in The Hollywood Reporter, twenty-six outfits were found in a single day.|$|E
500|$|Costume {{designer}} Lindy Hemming {{explained that}} Bane uses a mask to inhale an analgesic gas, which, in director Christopher Nolan's words, [...] "keeps his pain {{just below the}} threshold so he can function." [...] In designing Bane's costume, Hemming needed it to look [...] "like an amalgam {{of all sorts of}} bits and pieces he cobbled together, as he passed through some very remote <b>places.</b> <b>We</b> made parts of his vest, for example, from fragments of an old military tent. His clothes are militaristic, but are not in any way a uniform." [...] Hemming also designed Bane's mask to look [...] "animalistic". Costume effects supervisor Graham Churchyard created a three-dimensional model of actor Tom Hardy's face and skull to design the mask, allowing the mask to perfectly conform to the contours of Hardy's face. Hemming personally designed Bane's coat, which she admitted took two years to complete. Taking inspiration from a Swedish army jacket and a frock coat from the French Revolution, it was designed to make Bane look like equal parts dictatorial and revolutionary. The design was difficult as Hemming struggled to find a tailor in Los Angeles who could work with shearling.|$|E
500|$|Bates's {{occasional}} {{hints at}} Darwinian evolution are unwelcome or misunderstood by the reviewer, as when Bates writes {{that if a}} kind of seed is found in two <b>places,</b> <b>we</b> have to [...] "come to the strange conclusion" [...] it has been created twice unless we can show it can be carried that far; but the reviewer finds Bates in [...] "too great a hurry to come to conclusions" [...] (sic). The reviewer, too, objects to Bates's illustration of [...] "transition forms between Heliconius Melpomene and H. Thelxiope, which he thinks are no more different than [...] "a couple of Dorking hens". Bates's assumption that all forest animals are adapted to forest life is rejected by the reviewer, who sees the same features as signs of a beneficent Creator; while his mention of [...] "slow adaptation of the fauna of a forest-clad country throughout an immense lapse of geological time" [...] is criticised for being [...] "haunted" [...] by this [...] "spectre of time". However the reviewer is fascinated by the variety of life described in the book, and by Bates's [...] "rapturous manner" [...] of speaking about how delicious monkey flesh is, which [...] "almost puts a premium on cannibalism". The review concludes [...] "not without regret" [...] (at such an enjoyable book), and assures readers [...] "that they will not find him heavy reading"; supposes that 11 years was [...] "perhaps a little too much" [...] of tropical life; and recommends intending museum curators to try it for [...] "a year or two".|$|E

2500|$|Vince Aletti from Rolling Stone {{also gave}} an {{unfavorable}} review, stating [...] "the formula is more rigorously locked in than before, {{and the range}} so tightly circumscribed that Houston's potential seems to have shrunk rather than expanded" [...] and the record is [...] "smug, repressive and ridiculously safe." [...] Also, he made some sarcastic comments about the first single, [...] "I Wanna Dance with Somebody (Who Loves Me)", calling it [...] "How Will I Know II", spoken at Hollywood's blockbuster sequels. Robert Hilburn, in his review for Los Angeles Times, regarded the album as [...] "another commercial blockbuster", writing that the record is [...] "a series of highly accessible selections that will work {{on a variety of}} radio formats." [...] However, he expressed his considerable disappointment that Whitney did precious little to define the singer's vision, adding that she had a sensational voice but didn't assert much vocal character on it. Dolores Barclay of The Associated Press complimented Houston on her vocal ability: [...] "Whitney Houston has a fine instrument and uses it well. Her voice takes us to <b>places</b> <b>we</b> know and to <b>places</b> <b>we</b> might want to forget and to <b>places</b> <b>we</b> dream about." [...] But she, like other critics, was critical of the song material on the record, commenting [...] "There is no depth, and not much excitement. Nor does this talented song stylist and Grammy winner take risks and try something just a little daring." [...] St. Petersburg Times showed a favorable attitude toward her new album at large, stating [...] " [...] is, first and foremost, a product. It has been carefully designed, manufactured and packaged. As such, it's easy to be cynical about. But as products go, this is a pretty good one." [...] They also praised her vocals as follows: [...] "Houston's voice sounds good, real good. [...] She's firmer, more confident." ...|$|E

2500|$|Storyboard artists Simon Duric said [...] "The {{security}} on the film was a challenge. That script was locked in a safe.

[...] Lineberger added, [...] "These actors, writers, producers, directors, and crew delivered one of television's great successes, particularly in the fantasy genre. Highlander: The Series took us to <b>places</b> <b>we</b> otherwise could not have gone, and did so with intelligence, style, and wit."

2500|$|The film also {{features}} two robots, CASE and TARS (as {{well as a}} dismantled third robot, KIPP). Nolan wanted to avoid making the robots anthropomorphic and chose a [...] quadrilateral design. The director said: [...] "It has a very complicated design philosophy. It's based on mathematics. You've got four main blocks {{and they can be}} joined in three ways. So you have three combinations you follow. But then within that, it subdivides into a further three joints. And all the <b>places</b> <b>we</b> see lines—those can subdivide further. So you can unfold a finger, essentially, but it's all proportional." [...] Actor Bill Irwin voiced and physically controlled both robots, but his image was digitally removed from the film and his voicing for CASE was replaced with actor Josh Stewart's voice.|$|E
