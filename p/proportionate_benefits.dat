40|$|The American College of Medical Genetics and Genomics (ACMG) {{recommends}} that clinical sequencing laboratories return secondary findings in 56 genes associated with medically actionable conditions. Our {{goal was to}} apply a systematic, stringent approach consistent with clinical standards to estimate the prevalence of pathogenic variants associated with such conditions using a diverse sequencing reference sample. Candidate variants in the 56 ACMG genes were selected from Phase 1 of the 1000 Genomes dataset, which contains sequencing information on 1, 092 unrelated individuals from across the world. These variants were filtered using the Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) Professional version and defined parameters, appraised through literature review, and examined by a clinical laboratory specialist and expert physician. Over 70, 000 genetic variants were extracted from the 56 genes, and filtering identified 237 variants annotated as disease causing by HGMD Professional. Literature review and expert evaluation determined that 7 of these variants were pathogenic or likely pathogenic. Furthermore, 5 additional truncating variants not listed as disease causing in HGMD Professional were identified as likely pathogenic. These 12 secondary findings are associated with diseases that could inform medical follow-up, including cancer predisposition syndromes, cardiac conditions, and familial hypercholesterolemia. The majority of the identified medically actionable findings were in individuals from the European (5 / 379) and Americas (4 / 181) ancestry groups, with fewer findings in Asian (2 / 286) and African (1 / 246) ancestry groups. Our results suggest that medically relevant secondary findings can be identified in approximately 1 % (12 / 1092) of individuals in a diverse reference sample. As clinical sequencing laboratories continue to implement the ACMG recommendations, our results highlight that at least {{a small number of}} potentially important secondary findings can be selected for return. Our results also confirm that understudied populations will not reap <b>proportionate</b> <b>benefits</b> of genomic medicine, highlighting the need for continued research efforts on genetic diseases in these populations...|$|E

Many of the world’s most {{valuable}} fisheries involve highly migratory stocks that cross national jurisdictions.   These same fisheries face severe threats from direct overfishing or excessive bycatch. Traditional input and/or output controls generally have been costly and ineffective.   Incentive-based programs that provide tradable shares in an annual {{total allowable catch}} or tradable credits acquired by reduced bycatch harvests are attractive alternatives. These rely on Coasean exchange, but implementing them is costly due to fleet heterogeneity—flag country, target species, vessel size, technology; monitoring; new entry; and importantly, participation by countries whose exclusive economic zones (EEZs) are involved.  Country leaders engage in international collaboration to manage fish stocks when {{it is in the}} interests of key constituents to do so.  Although there may be worldwide benefits from fishery stock conservation, constituents in key countries may be made worse off from reduced access, harvest and processing levels, and license revenues. These constituents and politicians who represent them may view international efforts as imposing disproportionate burden.  Traditional “polluter pays” rules focus on restricting fishers. “Beneficiary pays rules,” however, emphasize payments from significant beneficiaries (International Organizations, NGOs, major fishing nations, major consuming nations), to elicit the cooperation of essential parties through compensation. Such payments can change perceptions within key countries to view international efforts as delivering <b>proportionate</b> <b>benefits</b> and costs. Such a distribution has been shown in the literature as a precondition for successful collective action in many settings.   Within EEZs design can then turn to effective incentive-based schemes to protect stocks...|$|E

In order to further increase the convergence rate and tracking, the “proportionate ” idea was applied to the affine projection algorithm (APA) in a straightforward manner.

Second, based on this approach, a new proportionate-type APA is developed, taking into account the “history ” of the <b>proportionate</b> factors. The <b>benefit</b> is also twofold. Simulation results indicate that the proposed algorithm outper-forms the classical one (achieving faster tracking and lower mis-adjustment).

On one side, only women get pregnant and there is a disproportionate number of women who do part-time work instead of full-time, suggesting that there should be allowances made for women.

40|$|The European Water Framework Directive (WFD) {{requires}} the good ecological status of surface water bodies, which implies {{the improvement of}} both their physicochemical condition, {{as well as their}} flow and continuity. The WFD prescribes the assessment of environmental and resource costs and benefits associated with implementing these improvements. The recent literature focuses almost exclusively on the assessment of the economic values related to quality aspects. However, in much of southern Europe, fulfilling the WFD goals will greatly depend on maintaining sufficient water flow, as well. This study aims to fill this gap by assessing the non-market value of allocating enough water to the environment to ensure environmental services are sustained when water is scarce. The non-market value of guaranteeing water supply for secondary household uses is also estimated. Using the Guadalquivir River Basin in Spain as a case study, a choice experiment is applied with scenarios characterized by varying water flow levels and accompanying environmental impacts, and a different frequency of household water restrictions. The results show that the population derives significant benefits not only from the direct use of water, but that also holds non-use values related to the ecological status, although the latter has a considerably lower impact on consumer surplus. Additionally, we conclude that the costs of implementing the water saving measures currently included in the Program of Measures seem to be <b>proportionate</b> to its <b>benefits</b> in this case. © 2011 Springer Science+Business Media B.

40|$|ABSTRACT. Joseph Boyle raises {{important}} {{questions about the}} place of the double-effect exception in absolutist moral theories. His own absolutist theory (held by many, but not all, Catholic moralists), which derives from the principles that fundamental human goods may not be intentionally violated, cannot dispense with such exceptions, although he rightly rejects some widely held views about what they are. By contrast, Kantian absolutist theory, which derives from the principle that lawful freedom must not be violated, has a corollary-that it is a duty, where possible, to coerce those who try to violate lawful freedom- which makes superfluous many of the double-effect exceptions Boyle allows. Other implications of the two theories are contrasted. Inter alia, it is argued that, in Boyle's theory, that a violation of a fundamental human good {{can be viewed as a}} cost <b>proportionate</b> to a <b>benefit</b> obtained, cannot yield a double-effect exception to the prohibition of intentionally violating that good, because paying a cost cannot be unintentional. Key Words: cost-benefit analysis, double effect, intention, side effect Most Catholic moralists, especially those who have to do with the practice of medicine, have long accepted that some moral prohibi-tions are not absolute, but admit exceptions when what is puta-tively prohibited because of a bad effect has a counterbalancing good effect. In recent years their doctrine has attracted much interest and some favor among secular non-Catholics. Moralists influenced by Kant, however, tend to resist 'double-effecf excep-tions as superfluous. The issues are confusing, because not only are theories of the double-effect exception various, but so also are theories according to which it is superfluous. Joseph Boyle's illuminating exploration of some of the theories in the field, both Catholic and non-Catholic, and his exposition and persuasiv...|$|R
40|$|Genuine moral {{disagreement}} {{exists and}} is widespread. To understand such disagreement, we must examine the basic kinds of social relationships people construct across cultures and the distinct moral obligations and prohibitions these relationships entail. In Chapter 2 of the dissertation, I develop Relationship Regulation Theory, which postulates {{that there are}} four fundamental and distinct moral motives embedded in different social-relational schemas. Unity is the motive to care for and support the integrity of in-groups by avoiding or eliminating threats of contamination, and providing aid and protection based on need or empathic compassion. Hierarchy is the motive to respect rank in social groups where superiors are entitled to deference and respect but must also lead, guide, direct, and protect subordinates. Equality is the motive for balanced, in-kind reciprocity, equal treatment, equal say, and equal opportunity. Proportionality is the motive for rewards and punishments to be <b>proportionate</b> to merit, <b>benefits</b> to be calibrated to contributions, and judgments {{to be based on}} a utilitarian calculus of costs and benefits. The four moral motives are universal, but cultures, ideologies, and individuals differ in when they activate these motives and how they implement them. Unlike existing theories (Haidt, 2007; Hauser, 2006; Turiel, 1983), Relationship Regulation Theory predicts that any action, including violence, unequal treatment, and "impure" acts, may be perceived as morally correct depending on the moral motive employed and how the relevant social relationship is construed. In Chapter 3, I report two experiments that I conducted to investigate whether activating social-relational schemas would lead to corresponding activation of moral motives. In Experiment 1, I found that framing a social group in terms of Communal Sharing or Authority Ranking social-relational schemas led to activation of Unity and Hierarchy motives, respectively. In Experiment 2, I found that priming Communal Sharing and Market Pricing Schemas led participants to allocate bonuses in a hypothetical vignette differently in ways that reflected the use of Unity and Proportionality motives, respectively. In Chapter 4, I incorporate notions of character into Relationship Regulation Theory. Specifically, I argue that moral judgments are partially based on evaluations of other people as prospects for social relationships. I use this relationship-based perspective of moral judgment to explain cases where an actor's intentions are neglected in observers' moral judgments of them...|$|R
