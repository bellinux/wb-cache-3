40|$|The thesis {{has three}} primary objectives: first, {{to review the}} spirituality and {{sustainable}} procurement literature and address the gap that exists; second, to investigate the relationship between spirituality and sustainable procurement within the Australian higher education sector; and third, to investigate the demographic profile of this sector and its relationship with spirituality and sustainable procurement. The workplace spirituality literature is gaining momentum; however, its existence within the Australian higher education sector is unnoticed. Similarly, procurement studies that are predominantly studied within Europe are patchy and are inconsistent within the Australian context (McMurray et al., 2009). To date, procurement studies and non-existent in the Australian higher education sector. The concepts of spirituality and sustainable procurement are still in their infancy, emerging and multidisciplinary; and the business and management literature contains no investigation of their relationship. Consequently, this provides an original contribution to the existing literature. An empirical study of 224 procurement professionals working within the Australian higher education sector confirms the relationship between spirituality and sustainable procurement. For example, dimension one of spirituality – Larger Context – is correlated with sustainable procurement dimensions such as Environment (r= 0. 342, p= 0. 000), Human Rights (r= 0. 243, p= 0. 000) and Philanthropy (r= 0. 200, p= 0. 003). Additionally, the emergent data confirms {{that there is a}} negative relationship between spirituality and sustainable procurement at the dimension level. This quantitative thesis has a response rate of 44. 50 % and stands on a pre-test, a pilot study and the main study. The survey uses two highly recognised and reputed scales: the Human Spirituality Scale (Wheat, 1991) which measures spirituality; and the Purchasing Social Responsibility Scale (Carter &amp; Jennings, 2004) which quantifies the procurement behaviour of the population frame, comprising procurement executives, procurement directors, senior procurement managers and <b>procurement</b> <b>assistants.</b> The thesis uses Pearson correlation, t-test, and analysis of variance (ANOVA) to investigate the research questions and is guided by the conceptual framework of Spillover Thoery. By addressing the relationship between spirituality and sustainable procurement in the Australian higher education sector, this thesis {{is one of the first}} empirical studies undertaken to investigate the relatively new and under-researched phenomenon of spirituality and its relationship with sustainable procurement. Thus, the thesis builds a platform for future research. The findings of the thesis have significant implications for modern organisations. Spirituality can be considered as a tool, which facilitates the sustainable and ethical behaviour within the workplace (Gupta et al., 2012) ...|$|R

Cataloged from PDF version of thesis report. Includes bibliographical references (page 53 - 55). Government is implementing e-GP to improve transparency and efficiency in Public Procurement. As a Government Organization, Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) is using e-GP in procurement activity to ensure transparency and accountability of using public fund. It is a great responsibility for the Executive Engineers to ensure utilization of public funds properly. Failure in Procurement process operation may increase cost and time and slow down development of Bangladesh. In DPHE, Executive Engineers act as <b>Procurement</b> Entities and <b>Assistant</b> Engineers & Sub-assistant Engineers participate in evaluation and tender opening process as members. Most of the Sub-Assistant Engineers have lacked computer literacy and not all Assistant and Sub-Assistant Engineers have computer and internet facility. Evaluating the inefficiencies in procurement process operation will help to identify the knowledge gaps and will help to mitigate the issues identified. Qualitative Research was conducted to address the research questions. The study was limited on the Executive Engineers of Department of Public Health Engineering (DPHE) due to time constrain. After analyzing the interviewed documents {{it was found that}} all respondents talked about Server Incapability, Unplanned Training, and troublesome BOQ uploading process as Procurement Process Operation inefficiency. Other inefficiencies were Supplier Selection failure due to Corrupted File Upload, Lengthy Document Verification, lack of knowledge, lack of logistics Support and reinventing the wheel for two tenders having same documenting. Generally causes behind these inefficiencies were uncertain server downtime, unplanned training, lack of training database, lack of motivation, lack of computer literacy, lack of computer availability and internet facility, absence of conversion software, lengthy manual evaluation. The consequences of these inefficiencies were lengthy procurement cycle, extra workload on Procuring Entities, tender opening failure leading to extra added step like time extension approval in procurement cycle, lack of confidence, Lack of reliability of work, slowness of procurement activity, typing error, extra step of corrigendum for correcting typing error, lack of competition and litigation issue, prolonged tender preparation time, violation of code of ethics, risk of erroneous and biased evaluation and litigation problem and added extra cost and time in tender preparation. The mitigation of these inefficiencies include controlling number of tenders to be floated in e-GP system each year, upgrading server, planned training, proper motivation and use of reward power, developing a cloud document verification and storage system, implementing Central Technical Support Service at DPHE and ensuring computer and internet facilities.
