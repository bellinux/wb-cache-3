5|$|The ACCC was successful, by a 2–1 majority, {{upon the}} remittal {{of the case}} to the full bench of the Federal Court. The full bench found that Baxter contravened Sections46 and 47 of the TPA. That {{judgment}} ended the eight-year-long litigation between Baxter and the ACCC. It {{was the first time in}} over 10 years that a corporation had unsuccessfully defended a prosecution brought by the ACCC for an alleged contravention of Section46. The full bench declared that Baxter breached Sections46 and 47 of the TPA, but left it to the ACCC to seek <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalties.</b> Baxter was refused special leave to appeal to the High Court against the full bench's judgment.|$|E

60|$|I {{should have}} {{mentioned}} before, {{that in the}} autumn of the preceding year I had formed most of my ingenious acquaintance into a club for mutual improvement, which we called the JUNTO; we met on Friday evenings. The rules that I drew up required that every member in his turn should produce one or more queries on any point of morals, politics, or natural philosophy, to be discussed by the company; and once in three months produce and read an essay of his own writing, on any subject he pleased. Our debates were to be under the direction of a president, and to be conducted in the sincere spirit of inquiry after truth, without fondness for dispute or desire of victory; and to prevent warmth, all expressions of positiveness in opinions or direct contradiction were after some time made contraband, and prohibited under small <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalties.</b>|$|E
60|$|Here the orator drew {{a picture}} of war that caused {{suffering}} monikinity to shudder. He viewed it in its four leading points: its religious, its pecuniary, its political, and its domestic penalties. He described war to be the demon state of the monikin mind; as opposed to worship, to charity, brotherly love, and all the virtues. On its <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalties,</b> he touched by exhibiting a tax-sheet. Buttons which cost sixpence a gross, he assured the house, would shortly cost sevenpence a gross.--Here he was reminded that monikins no longer wore buttons.--No matter, they bought and sold buttons, and the effects on trade were just the same. The political penalties of war he fairly showed to be frightful; but {{when he came to}} speak of the domestic penalties, there was not a dry eye in the house. Captain Poke blubbered so loud that I was in an agony lest he should be called to order.|$|E
60|$|But what {{security}} {{would there}} be for the faithful fulfillment of these promises? In modern times such security is given by bonds, with <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalties,</b> or by the deposit of titles to property in responsible hands. In ancient days they managed differently. The promiser bound himself by some solemn and formal mode of adjuration, accompanied, in important cases, with certain ceremonies, which were supposed to seal and confirm the obligation assumed. In this case Hannibal brought a lamb {{in the presence of}} the assembled army. He held it before them with his left hand, while with his right he grasped a heavy stone. He then called aloud upon the gods, imploring them to destroy him as he was about to slay the lamb, if he failed to perform faithfully and fully the pledges that he had made. He then struck the poor lamb a heavy blow with the stone. The animal fell dead at his feet, and Hannibal was thenceforth bound, in the opinion of the army, by a very solemn obligation indeed, to be faithful in fulfilling his word.|$|E
5000|$|In the Magistrates' Courts Act 1980, {{unless the}} context {{otherwise}} requires, the expression [...] "fine", {{except for the}} purposes of any enactment imposing a limit on the amount of any fine, includes any <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalty</b> or <b>pecuniary</b> forfeiture or pecuniary compensation payable under a conviction.|$|R
50|$|These {{provisions}} are vigorously enforced. In December 2014, the Federal Court of Australia, {{on the application}} of the ACCC, issued a $10 million <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalty</b> order against Coles Supermarkets in relation to two connected proceedings arising from payment demands by Coles to which it was not entitled by threatening harm to the suppliers that did not comply with such demands.|$|R
50|$|A related {{concept is}} the fixed <b>penalty</b> notice, a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalty</b> for some minor crimes {{that can be}} either {{accepted}} (instead of prosecution, thus saving time and paperwork, or taken to court for normal proceedings for that crime. While technically not a fine, which, under the Bill of Rights 1689, may be levied only following a conviction, it serves the same purpose of punishment.|$|R
6000|$|However, {{before we}} pass {{from this point}} {{concerning}} possession, {{it will be a}} relaxation of the mind, not wholly foreign to our purpose, to take a short review of the extraordinary policy which has been held with regard to religion in that kingdom, from the time our ancestors took possession of it. The most able antiquaries are of opinion, and Archbishop Usher, whom I reckon amongst the first of them, has, I think, shown, that a religion not very remote from the present Protestant persuasion was that of the Irish before the union of that kingdom to the crown of England. If this was not directly the fact, this at least seems very probable, that Papal authority was much lower in Ireland than in other countries. This union was made under the authority of an arbitrary grant of Pope Adrian, in order that the Church of Ireland should be reduced to the same servitude with those that were nearer to his see. It is not very wonderful that an ambitious monarch should make use of any pretence in his way to so considerable an object. What is extraordinary is, that for a very long time, even quite down to the Reformation, and in their most solemn acts, the kings of England founded their title wholly on this grant: they called for obedience from the people of Ireland, not on principles of subjection, but as vassals and mesne lords between them and the Popes; and they omitted no measure of force or policy to establish that Papal authority, with all the distinguishing articles of religion connected with it, and to make it take deep root {{in the minds of the}} people. Not to crowd instances unnecessary, I shall select two, one of which is in print, the other on record,--the one a treaty, the other an act of Parliament. The first is the submission of the Irish chiefs to Richard the Second, mentioned by Sir John Davies. In this pact they bind themselves for the future to preserve peace and allegiance to the kings of England, under certain <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalties.</b> But what is remarkable, these fines were all covenanted to be paid into the Apostolical Chamber, supposing the Pope as the superior power, whose peace was broken and whose majesty was violated in disobeying his governor. By this time, so far as regarded England, the kings had extremely abridged the Papal power in many material particulars: they had passed the Statute of Provisors, the Statute of Præmunire,--and, indeed, struck out of the Papal authority all things, at least, that seemed to infringe on their temporal independence. In Ireland, however, their proceeding was directly the reverse: there they thought it expedient to exalt it at least as high as ever: for, so late as the reign of Edward the Fourth, the following short, but very explicit, act of Parliament was passed:-- ...|$|E
50|$|There are no <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalties</b> {{available}} for a breach of section 18. However, for a breach {{of many of the}} related provisions in the Australian Consumer Law, the Australian Competition and Consumer Commission (ACCC) can seek <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalties</b> of up to $1.1 million from corporations and $220,000 from individuals.|$|E
50|$|In Australian law, {{a penalty}} unit (abbreviated as PU) is {{an amount of}} money used to compute <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalties</b> for many {{breaches}} of statute law.

50|$|An {{enforcement}} agency may use or disclose the issuing of a warrant or information {{about such a}} warrant to a third party only for specified purposes, pursuant to s 182B. Such purposes include enabling a person to comply with their notification obligations under s 185D or s 185E, in relation to journalist information warrants, enabling ASIO to perform its functions, or to enforce the criminal law, the enforcement of a law imposing a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalty,</b> or {{the protection of the}} public revenue.|$|R
50|$|The earlier {{history of}} the English law of {{defamation}} is somewhat obscure; civil actions for damages {{seem to have been}} tolerably frequent {{as far back as the}} reign of Edward I (1272-1307). There was no distinction drawn between written and spoken words, and when no <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalty</b> was involved, such cases fell within the old jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts, which were only finally abolished in the eighteenth century. It seems uncertain whether or not any generally applicable criminal process was in place.|$|R

50|$|Under the old access regime, the TIA Act {{provided}} that ‘enforcement agencies’ {{are able to}} access both stored communications (such as content of emails or SMS messages) and data about communications (metadata). The former requires a warrant for access under s 110 and s 116, whereas the latter does not. ‘Enforcement agencies’ are broadly defined to include all interception agencies, {{as well as a}} body whose function includes administering a law imposing a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalty</b> or the protection of public revenue.

50|$|Prior to the {{introduction}} of penalty units, fines and other charges were usually prescribed in terms of ordinary money (pounds or, later, dollars).

50|$|Summons {{under the}} legis actiones system {{were in the}} form of in ius vocatio, {{conducted}} by voice. The plaintiff would request, with reasons, that the defendant come to court. If he failed to appear, the plaintiff could call reasons and have him dragged to court. If the defendant could not be brought to court, he would be regarded as indefensus, and the plaintiff could, with the authorization of the praetor, seize his property. The defendant may elect a representative to appear in his place, or seek a vadimonium - a promise to appear on a certain day with a threat of <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalty</b> if he failed to appear.|$|R
50|$|The {{thresholds}} {{for access}} {{were also a}} central feature of several submissions. As discussed above, once the Attorney-General declares an agency an enforcement agency, that agency is able to access metadata retained by a service providers. The agency can do so by requesting and authorising service providers to disclose the information. Such authorisations {{can be made in}} relation to retrospective historical data where doing so is ‘reasonably necessary’ for the enforcement of the criminal law, a law imposing a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalty,</b> or a law protecting the public revenue. In relation to prospective data, such authorisations could be made where ‘reasonably necessary’ for the investigation of a serious criminal offence. This differs from the process relating to stored communications (content), which can only be accessed by criminal law enforcement agencies through a warrant process.|$|R

40|$|Two {{directions}} of amending the Polish penal code are {{considered by the}} authoress to be the leading ones. The first one {{is characterized by the}} strife to diminish the represiveness of the Polish penal law. The second one comprises the proposals aiming at the increase of the law abidingness. When discussing the first trend, the authoress considers the multiple changes of the penal code regulations concerning a capital punishment, deprivation of liberty <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalty</b> and the directives of determining a penalty. The elimination of capital punishment, or its limitation to cases of manslaughter and high treason is suggested. The lower limit of deprivation of liberty is decreased (to equal one month) as well as other sanctions related to individual crimes. Deprivation of liberty up to three years is to alternate, as a rule, with a penalty of restricted liberty and a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalty</b> (fine). The adoption of the socalled "Scandinavian system" in meting out fines in days is advised. Varying regulations are called for in questions of criminal responsiblity of juveniles and young adult offenders. The regulation of recidivism has to be essentially changed. The conditional discontinuance of criminal proceedings is to be decided only in courts. The decrease in represiveness of penal law can also be effected by the new regulation of the conditional suspension of the enforcement of punishment and of the release on licence. The authoress advocates that the second trend of the proposed changes comprising postulates aiming at the increase of the law abidingness is out of proportion to the proposed amendments diminishing the represiveness of penal law. The scope of protection of criticism is not extended there and the grounds for the criminal responsibility of persons guilty of abuse of authority are not secured. The range of changes concerning protection against corruption and speculation is not satisfactory either. No coordination with the provisions of the Code of Offences and the Speculation Control Act can be observed. It seems also necessary to verify the obsolete part of the detailed provisions of the Penal Code. On the other hand, the extention of the smart money institution (paid by the perpetrator to the injured person) is to be classed among the changes of a right direction.

40|$|Resumé/Summary: This thesis {{deals with}} {{alternatives}} to unconditional prison sentences and procedural law alternatives {{in the field}} of criminal law. The introduction outlines the historical development of alternative sanctions and the reasons for their creation and implementation. The following chapters address alternative sentences as accounted for in the valid and effective Czech legislation. The community service sentence, as the most typical alternative punishment, is discussed in detail. Attention is also focused on suspended sentences, including suspended sentences with supervision, i. e. punishments which are definitely the ones that are imposed the most frequently in the Czech Republic. The sentence of <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalty,</b> which is also often imposed as an alternative sanction, is dealt with thoroughly too. Other punishments, including forfeiture of an item, prohibition of a specific activity, prohibition of residence and deportation, whose alternative function is rather secondary, are paid less attention. The following part of the paper provides a comparison of alternative sentences according to Slovak legal regulations with alternative penalties envisaged by Czech legislation. In view of the recent amendment to substantive criminal law in the Czech Republic (Act No. 40 / 2009 Coll.), this chapter also [...] ...|$|R
50|$|The Act also {{introduces}} the highly contentious ‘journalist information’ warrant scheme under Division 4C. This scheme, requires ASIO and {{other law enforcement}} agencies to obtain a warrant prior to authorising the disclosure of telecommunications data, {{for the purposes of}} identifying the journalist’s confidential source. The Attorney-General or an issuing authority (including ‘eligible persons’ within ASIO and AFP) under s 180L and s 180T, respectively, must consider several factors when deciding whether to issue an information warrant. In particular, they must be satisfied that the warrant is ‘reasonably necessary’ to, enforce the criminal law, locate a person reporting missing to the AFP or State Police, enforce a law that imposes a <b>pecuniary</b> <b>penalty</b> or protects the public revenue and investigate series offences, including offences against the Commonwealth, State or Territory law, punishable by a 3-year imprisonment term. Additionally, the Attorney-General or the issuing authority must not issue a warrant unless they are satisfied that the public interest is issuing the warrant outweighs public interest in protecting the confidentiality of the identity of the source. Submissions by the newly created Public Interest Advocate, must also be considered when deciding to issue a warrant.|$|R
