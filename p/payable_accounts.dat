As with the XL40, Triumph-Adler marketed the system in Europe under their own brand with the model name MSX 3200 (There were four models, eventually, in the Triumph-Adler series: 3200, 3220, 3230 and 3240). The key to disk application from the XL40 was re-implemented on the 3200. The other main application was a BASIC language driven database, similar to the ones used by MAI Basic Four or Pick operating system. These BASIC database business systems would be purchased by outside companies that bundled the PCC 3200 with their software to provide a complete small business package (accounts <b>payable,</b> <b>accounts</b> receivable, payroll, inventory, sales tracking, taxes, etc.) customized for specific businesses.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{analyses}} the use {{of trade}} credit in China, relying on balance sheet information for a large sample of unlisted companies over the period 2004 - 2007. We first investigate which factors drive the extension and the obtainment of trade credit. Private companies extend less trade credit the higher the amount of inventories they hold and the lower the share of capital owned by foreign agents. Consistent with the Triangle Debt Dilemma, state-owned enterprises and collective enterprises {{are more likely to}} obtain trade credit if they have previously extended it. We then examine the effect of net trade credit, measured as <b>accounts</b> <b>payable</b> minus <b>accounts</b> receivable, on the capital structure. We show that net trade credit is positively associated with total and short-term debt. This relationship holds in those provinces with high levels of marketization and it is valid for private and foreign firms only if located in the most developed provinces. Finally, we analyze how <b>accounts</b> <b>payable</b> and <b>accounts</b> receivable affect the extensive margin of exports. <b>Accounts</b> <b>payable</b> influence the probability of exporting through an inverted U-shaped relationship for all ownership types. However, the nonlinearity holds also for accounts receivable only for private companies...|$|R
50|$|NewViews {{does not}} rely on {{accounting}} modules, as is typical of other accounting software programs. Instead, reporting structure {{is controlled by the}} way accounts are totalled on reports (referred to as report arithmetic). An account can total to another account on the same report, or to an account on any other report. The ability to total an account on one report to an account on another report is the foundation of integration in NewViews. For example, the change to retained earnings on the income statement can be totalled to the retained earnings on the balance sheet to reflect this relationship. Total amounts from subsidiary ledgers and schedules can also be totalled directly to controlling accounts on financial statements or other subsidiary reports. In this way, NewViews can be set up to accommodate standard subsidiary ledgers (e.g. accounts <b>payable,</b> <b>accounts</b> receivable, inventory, etc.) as well as highly customized reports that are specific to user needs (e.g. reports required for fund accounting in not-for-profit agencies).|$|E
