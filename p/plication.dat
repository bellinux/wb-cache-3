5|$|Cyathus helenae is {{distinguished}} from the more common C.striatus by its faint inner-surface <b>plication</b> (C.striatus has a more pronounced <b>plication),</b> the nodular arrangement of the hairs on the outer surface, and microscopically by the spore shape – ellipsoid in C.striatus, ovoid or spheroidal in C.helenae.|$|E

25|$|Mastopexy by {{internal}} surgical approach {{applies to the}} woman who has undergone explantation of breast prostheses. In operative praxis, the plastic surgeon elevates the flaps of the cut breast-implant capsules, and folds them in order to increase the volume of the internal mass of the breasts — thereby increasing the projection of the bust from the chest surface. The nipple-areola complex is elevated with <b>plication</b> sutures, and requires no skin resection when there is no excess skin.|$|E

5000|$|Hydrocele Surgery with <b>Plication</b> of the Hydrocele Sac: The {{hydrocele}} {{is opened}} with a small skin incision without further preparation. The hydrocele sac is reduced (plicated) by suture Hydrocele surgery: Lord's technique. The <b>plication</b> technique is suitable for medium-sized and thin-walled hydroceles. The advantage of the <b>plication</b> technique is the minimized dissection with a reduced complication rate.|$|E
50|$|NDO Surgical Plicator {{creates a}} <b>plication,</b> or fold, of tissue near the {{gastroesophageal}} junction, and fixates the <b>plication</b> with a suture-based implant. The company ceased operations in mid-2008, and {{the device is}} {{no longer on the}} market.|$|E
50|$|Diaphragm eventration is {{typically}} repaired thoracoscopically, by {{a technique called}} <b>plication</b> of the diaphragm. <b>Plication</b> basically involves a folding of the eventrated diaphragm which is then sutured in order to “take up the slack” of the excess diaphragm tissue.|$|E
40|$|Background: Manipulation and {{suspension}} of the superficial musculoaponeurotic system (SMAS) is per-formed by 74 % of rhytidectomy surgeons. Multiple vari-ations in suture techniques are employed in this task, but {{they have never been}} evaluated for differences in their ability to withstand stress. Objective: To compare the biomechanical proper-ties of two different suture techniques that are used in SMAS <b>plications</b> during rhytidectomy: a double-layered running locking (DRL) stitch and multiple horizontal mattress stitches. Methods: Fourteen horizontal mattress <b>plications,</b> in rows of six sutures, and comparable lengths of 16 DRL stitch <b>plications</b> of pig skin samples, were stressed using a tensometer with grip displacement increasing at a con...|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s, Brodie, in his {{monograph}} on birds nest fungi, {{separated the}} genus Cyathus into seven related {{groups based on}} a number of taxonomic characteristics, including {{the presence or absence of}} <b>plications,</b> the structure of the peridioles, the color of the fruit bodies, and the nature of the hairs on the outer peridium:Olla group: Species with a tomentum having fine flattened-down hairs, and no <b>plications.</b>|$|R

50|$|The study {{describes}} gastric sleeve <b>plication</b> (also {{referred to}} as gastric imbrication or laparoscopic greater curvature <b>plication)</b> as a restrictive technique that eliminates the complications associated with adjustable gastric banding and vertical sleeve gastrectomy—it does this by creating restriction {{without the use of}} implants and without gastric resection (cutting) and staples.|$|E
