40|$|Contains introduction, methods, results, and {{conclusions}} and recommendations. The "Puna geothermal resource {{area has been}} the focus of keen interest on the part of potential geothermal investors and developers since the demonstration of a <b>proven</b> <b>resource</b> in the region of the HGP-A well at Pohoiki. Two wells have been drilled north of the HGP-A site (in the vicinity of Pu'u Honuaula) by Puna Geothermal Ventures. A floral and faunal survey of this area was performed in early 1984 (Char et. ale 1984) to provide baseline data for future Environmental Impact Statements necessary for activation and associated activities at the PGV wellsites. High densities of Hawaiian Hawk (Buteo solitarius) in this 2010 acre portion of the Puna geothermal resource area became apparant during the field surveys. Because this species is considered endangered, its breeding status in the area is of some concern with regards to future geothermal development. This is particularly true of portions of the geothermal resource area that are either adjacent to or downwind of potentially active wellsites. In order to provide a better data base from which to address these concerns, a breeding season survey was conducted to determine breeding density and to better define portions of the site used for nesting activity. The results of this survey are provided in the following sections. ...|$|E
40|$|Antigen-antibody {{complexes}} {{are central}} players in an effective immune response. However, finding those interactions {{relevant to a}} particular disease state can be arduous. Nonetheless many paths to discovery have been explored since deciphering these interactions can greatly facilitate {{the development of new}} diagnostics, therapeutics, and vaccines. In silico B cell epitope mapping approaches have been widely pursued, though success has not been consistent. Antibody mixtures in immune sera have been used as handles for biologically relevant antigens, but these and other experimental approaches have <b>proven</b> <b>resource</b> intensive and time consuming. In addition, these methods are often tailored to individual diseases or a specific proteome, rather than providing a universal platform. Most of these methods are not able to identify the specific antibody's epitopes from unknown antigens, such as un-annotated neo antigens in cancer. Alternatively, a peptide library comprised of sequences unrestricted by naturally-found protein space provides for a universal search for mimotopes of an antibody's epitope. Here we present the utility of such a non-natural random sequence library of 10, 000 peptides physically addressed on a microarray for mimotope discovery without sequence information of the specific antigen. The peptide arrays were probed with serum from an antigen-immunized rabbit, or alternatively probed with serum pre-absorbed with the same immunizing antigen. With this positive and negative screening scheme, we identified the library-peptides as the mimotopes of the antigen. The unique library peptides were successfully used to isolate antigen-specific antibodies from complete immune serum. Sequence analysis of these peptides revealed the epitopes in the immunized antigen. We present this method as an inexpensive, efficient method for identifying mimotopes of any antibody's targets. These mimotopes should be useful in defining both components of the antigen-antibody complex...|$|E

Simon argues that these simple analyses are often wrong. While focusing only on <b>proven</b> <b>resources</b> is helpful in a business context, it is not appropriate for economy-wide forecasting; there exist undiscovered sources, sources not yet economically feasible to extract, sources not yet technologically feasible to extract, and misconceived <b>resources</b> that could <b>prove</b> useful but are not yet worth trying to discover.|$|R
40|$|This thesis assesses {{whether it}} is {{profitable}} to build a natural gas infrastructure solution in the Barents Sea, under reasonable assumptions about costs and revenues. In order {{to answer this question}} we have looked at the resource base in the Barents Sea and the probability of new discoveries, how the global market for natural gas will develop, at what cost the oil and gas companies will be able to recover the resources, and what type of infrastructure that suits the region best and how it could be financed. Our findings indicate that a natural gas pipeline would be a profitable solution, while other solutions are either not technically viable or not profitable. The <b>proven</b> <b>resource</b> base alone is not sufficient to justify a pipeline development, but the likelihood of new discoveries is high if exploration activity is increased. We found that exploration has been limited as a consequence of lacking infrastructure, meaning that there is a timing paradox concerning development of the region. If there is no infrastructure solution in place, there will not be enough exploration, and if there is not enough exploration, there will not be enough discoveries to justify the infrastructure development. We have found that a project finance approach could have solved the timing paradox, if oil and gas companies were willing to contractually commit to pay for transportation rights beyond what their current discoveries will justify. As a project finance approach allows for high level of risk allocation between project participants, it is possible to divide project risk within the capital structure so that the infrastructure investment offers an attractive opportunity for various investors. We have found that a pipeline could be financed by dividing the risk between debt holders, infrastructure funds and oil and gas companies, so that all parties are able to achieve a risk-reward profile that match their preferences. However, we found that oil and gas companies are not willing to make these kinds of contractual commitments. This means that the pipeline project will have to carry more risk, making high leverage, as suggested in our project finance model, challenging. To solve the timing paradox we thus conclude that government intervention is necessary. We find that state financing of the infrastructure is a better solution then further incentivizing exploration. State financing might be viewed as selective business support and is consequently politically difficult. nhhma...|$|E
