Hydrolytic removal of the acetonide protecting groups followed by cleavage of the sugar with periodate gives aldehyde (4). This is reduced to the glycol by means of NaBH4 and the terminal alcohol is converted to the mesylate (5).

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>prenalterol,</b> a {{selective}} beta 1 -adrenoreceptor agonist, were studied {{in a patient}} with the Shy-Drager syndrome, presenting with incapacitating orthostatic hypotension.

Notable positive chronotropic and inotropic effects were observed. Association of fludrocortisone 0. 5 mg/day resulted in further haemodynamic and symptomatic improvement, presumably due to plasma volume expansion.

In spite of the clinical importance of <b>prenalterol</b> hydrochloride, few methods have been described for its determination and no official methods for its assay have been reported.

As a result of dose titration studies the oral dose of <b>prenalterol</b> given was 100 mg twice a day in all patients. Erect bicycle sprint tests were performed to exercise tolerance before and after treatment had been started.

40|$|The new inotropic agent <b>prenalterol</b> was {{administered}} intravenously in a canine model of acute ischemic heart failure and {{in patients with}} severe chronic heart failure. Experimental heart failure in anesthetized dogs was induced by two vessel coronary artery constriction and intravenous <b>prenalterol</b> (0. 005 – 15 Μg/kg/min) was compared to dobutamine (0. 001 – 30 Μg/kg/min) and saline. Significant dose–dependent increases in left ventricular dP/dt max ′ cardiac output and non–ischemic zone contractile force and significant reductions in systemic vascular resistance were present during infusions of both inotropic agents. High dose dobutamlne caused greater increases in mean arterial pressure and pressure rate product with a trend toward greater increases in heart rate. However, neither inotropic agent significantly improved ischemic zone contractile force. <b>Prenalterol</b> possessed a markedly longer hemodynamic half–life than dobutamlne (3. 0 hours compared to 1. 7 minutes). Nine patients with severe chronic heart failure (left ventricular ejection fraction mean ± SD 17 ± 5 %, cardiac index 1. 7 ± 0. 4 1 /min/m 2) responded to intravenous <b>prenalterol</b> (1, 4, and 8 mg) with significant increases in cardiac index, left ventricular ejection fraction and left ventricular stroke work index. Left ventricular filling pressure, mean right atrial pressure and pulmonary arteriolar resistance were significantly reduced. No significant differences were present among peak responses to the three doses employed. An inverse correlation between basal heart rate and increase in left ventricular ejection fraction following <b>prenalterol</b> was noted. The mechanisms by which <b>prenalterol</b> causes hemodynamic improvement appear to include a direct inotropic effect, a reduction in left ventricular outflow resistance {{and a reduction in}} left and right ventricular filling pressure (venodilating effect).

The induced modifications of regional flow and function were then compared to those produced in another series of 6 dogs by atrial pacing at 150 and 175 beats min- 1 respectively. <b>Prenalterol</b> significantly increased RMBF and segment length (SL) -shortening in a dose-dependent manner in the nonischaemic zone. In the ischaemic zone, RMBF was maintained and SL-shortening increased with <b>prenalterol,</b> 5 micrograms kg- 1 whereas both RMBF and contractile function were severely decreased with <b>prenalterol,</b> 20 micrograms kg- 1.

40|$|<b>Prenalterol,</b> an {{allegedly}} beta 1 -selective adrenergic agonist {{with high}} intrinsic sympathomimetic activity (ISA), {{was shown to}} be weakly lipolytic in rat adipocytes. However, in pertussis-toxin-treated adipocytes, the ISA of <b>prenalterol</b> was markedly increased (from 10 - 20 % to approx. 100 % of that of isoprenaline). The cellular sensitivity was also increased (EC 50 approx. 60 nM and approx. 3 microM in pertussis-toxin-treated and control cells respectively). A similar effect was seen for other partial agonists such as the beta 2 -selective agonist terbutaline and for beta-adrenergic antagonists with some intrinsic activity (metoprolol, pindolol). There was no clear change in sensitivity to isoprenaline's ability to stimulate adenylate cyclase in adipocyte membranes from pertussis-toxin-treated animals but the cyclase activity was increased approx. 4 -fold {{in the presence of}} 1 microM-GTP. <b>Prenalterol</b> stimulated lipolysis by only small increases in intracellular cyclic AMP (cAMP) levels (less than 10 % of that seen with isoprenaline). Basal lipolysis was increased in cells from pertussis-toxin-treated rats and the cellular sensitivity to the non-degradable cAMP analogue, N 6 -monobutyryl-cAMP, was increased.

40|$|A {{total of}} 49 {{patients}} were studied, using invasive hemodynamic techniques with systemic arterial, pulmonary artery and right atrial pressure recordings together with thermodilution cardiac output determinations. Sixteen {{of the patients}} were also subjected to cardiometabolic studies, using measurement of coronary sinus blood flow by the continuous thermodilution technique and analyses of oxygen content and lactate concentration in the systemic and coronary circulation. A common denominator in the five investigations was, that a distributive cardiovascular dysequilibrium was either induced (for surgical or anaesthesiological reasons) or already present due to a pathological condition. Thoracic epidural block from T 1 to T 12 induced marked decrease in systemic blood pressure due to vasodilation and impairment of cardiac performance. <b>Prenalterol</b> administration effectively abolished the low blood pressure by its marked inotropic action, having no effect on systemic vascular resistance. Myocardial oxygen consumption changed in parallel with the changes in cardiac work following both thoracic epidural block and <b>prenalterol.</b> Coronary vascular resistance was markedly decreased by the block and was not affected by <b>prenalterol.</b> It is suggested, that the critically low perfusion pressure is {{the main cause of}} the coronary vasodilation and that alpha-blockade induced by the thoracic epidural block is of less importance. The combination of a thoracic epidural block from T 1 to T 12 and selective ßi-stimulation with <b>prenalterol</b> was an effective way to modify the cardiovascular response to infrarenal aortic cross clamping. This treatment transferred the patients to a more favourable cardiac function curve and possibly facilitated the redistribution of blood flow in association with clamping. In association with declamping of the infrarenal aorta or the common iliac arteries, volume loading to a slightly elevated left ventricular filling pressure shortly before declamping was an effective way to counteract the expected blood pressure drop. A normal left ventricular filling pressure prior to declamping did not prevent the blood pressure drop following declamping. It is suggested, that mismatching between vascular volume and blood volume is the main cause of declamping hypotension. In patients with low resistance, distributive septic shock caused by gram negative bacteremias and signs of impaired cardiac function, <b>prenalterol</b> effectively reversed the hypotension and improved tissue perfusion by selectively increasing cardiac output.

In Experiment 1 pups were pretreated with saline or <b>prenalterol</b> (0. 1 or 1. 0 mg/kg), a 131 adrenoceptor agonist that increases cardiac rate, followed by administration of clonidine (1. 0 mg/kg). <b>Prenalterol</b> pretreatment suppressed clonidine-induced ultra-sound production at both doses. <b>Prenalterol</b> also increased skin temperature, however, suggesting that suppression of ultrasound was modulated {{in part by}} increased body temperature. Consistent with this suggestion, in Experiment 2 mild hyperthermia significantly inhibited clonidine-induced ultrasound production. Finally, in Experiment 3 the authors found that the pretreatments used in Experiments 1 and 2 prevent or dampen the effects of clonidine on cardiac rate. These results suggest that clonidine's effect on ultrasound production is mediated by its effects on the cardiovascular system. It {{has been known for}} many years that isolating infant rats and exposing them to cold evokes emission of an ultrasonic vocaliza-tion (Allin & Banks, 1971; Okon, 1971).

40|$|Centre {{received}} {{reports of}} 184 patients hospitalized due to &beta;-adrenoceptor blocker overdosage. Of the 35 patients who developed signs of severe cardiac dysfunction (HR < 50 beats/min, {{systolic blood pressure}} < 80 mm Hg), 23 had ingested propranolol, 10 metoprolol and 2 alprenolol. 2 The mean value of the defined daily doses (DDD) per 1000 inhabitants per day in Sweden during these years were 11. 97 for propranolol, 8. 02 for alprenolol and 7. 74 for metoprolol. The incidence of severe poisoning due to alprenolol overdosage is lower than expected according to DDD. 3 During 1979 19 persons died from overdosage with &beta;-adrenoceptor blockers in Sweden: 15 due to propranolol (non-selective, lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic activity), 2 to metoprolol (cardioselective, lacks intrinsic sympathomimetic activity) and 2 to alprenolol (non-selective, intrinsic sym-pathomimetic activity). These findings indicate that severe and even fatal poisoning may occur regardless {{of the type of}} &beta;-blocking agent. 4 The usefulness of <b>prenalterol,</b> a cardioselective &beta;-adrenoceptor partial agonist, in reversing unwanted cardiac effects of &beta;-adrenoceptor blocking agents is illustrated by two cases of massive propranolol intoxication (maxi-mal plasma concentrations of propranolol 7. 2 and 7. 8 &mu;mol/l respectively). <b>Prenalterol</b> in high doses (130 and 280 mg/ 24 h respectively) restored cardiac function...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{the present}} {{investigation}} was to study {{the influence of the}} sympathetic nervous system and of various adrenoceptor agents on enzyme secretion and morphology in rat parotid and guinea-pig submandibular glands. Biochemical methods were combined with electron microscopical techniques. Two different in vitro systems were employed, batch-incubation and microperifusion, to characterize the sympathetically evoked amylase release and its correlation to cyclic AMP. By using various selective β-adrenoceptor agonists and antagonists a dominance of the β 1 -adrenoceptor over the β 2 - in regulating amylase release - was establ ished. Continuous noradrenaline perifusion caused a rapid initial amylase discharge, closely correlated to tissue levels of cyclic AMP; no correlation between the two was observed during the later phase. <b>Prenalterol</b> (a β 1 -agonist) failed to elevate glandular cyclic AMP. This was in contrast to its potent secretagogic effect. On the other hand, terbutaline (a β 2 -agonist) was a weak secretagogue but markedly raised the levels of cyclic AMP. Thus, β-adrenoceptor activation may lead to release of large amounts of amylase despite minimal or no increase in cyclic AMP. Moreover, these effects seemed to be dissociated in salivary glands with regard to the β-adrenoceptor subtypes. This was further substantiated by the findings that repeated injections of <b>prenalterol</b> induced qualitative changes in the granule populations, similar to those caused by the non-selective β-agonist isoprenaline. Terbutaline was without effect. However, acinar cells size was increased following both <b>prenalterol</b> and terbutaline treatment. The data suggest that the 3 -adrenergic effects on acinar cell size and granule population may be independently regulated. A decreased sympathetic activity of long duration was induced by neonatal or adult extirpation of the superior cervical ganlion on one side. Acinar cell size, as well as granule and amylase content was reduced 9 weeks after neonatal denervation. Ganglionectomy performed in adult animals was without significant effects. The secretory behaviour of neonatally denervated glands was characterized by an increased postjunctional sensitivity to 3 -adrenoceptor agonists. Of special interest was the finding that neonatal denervation seemed to transform terbutaline from a partial to a full secretory agonist, thus changing its effects in the direction of those of <b>prenalterol</b> and noradrenaline. Moreover, increased levels of cyclic AMP as well as an enhanced response to DBcAMP were noted in the denervated glands as were intracellular changes. The denervation supersensitivity after neonatal denervation seems to differ from that observed in adult denervated glands. The results of the studies on denervated glands suggest that the sympathetic nervous system plays a fundamental role in the early maturation of the rat parotid gland {{as well as for the}} development of the β-adrenoceptor subtypes.

Utilising the residue conservatism surrounding the known active conformers bound to either of two aspartate residues (α-helices II,III) in both receptors (β, β) and species (guinea-pig, rat and human), no significant deformation in the extended sidechain could be found in prenalterol's agonist binding compared to isoprenaline.

40|$|Although right {{ventricular}} function may {{be examined}} {{by following the}} passage (first pass) of a bolus of radionuclide through the right heart before it reaches the left heart, the counts detected with conventional gamma cameras {{in such a short}} time interval are low; moreover, repeated determinations would result in an unacceptable radiation burden to the patient. We have modified the gated equilibrium blood pool method to allow repeated assessment of the right ventricular ejection fraction (RVEF) and have compared the results with the first-pass method in 43 patients. Good agreement was obtained between the two methods (r = 0. 91, p less than 0. 001). The mean difference between the two methods was 0. 04 with an intra-observer variation for the equilibrium studies of 0. 03 and an inter-observer difference of 0. 04. The mean difference in RVEF for seven patients studied on two separate occasions 30 minutes apart was only 0. 02. In four patients the mean RVEF measured at rest was 0. 44 +/- 0. 05 (SEM) and after exercise it was 0. 48 +/- 0. 06. After infusion of isoprenaline at 1 microgram/min the mean rose to 0. 64 +/- 0. 04 (p less than 0. 02) and after infusion of a new beta 1 -sympathomimetic agent, <b>prenalterol,</b> at doses of 1 and 2 mg it was 0. 56 +/- 0. 02 (p less than 0. 02) and 0. 59 +/- 0. 03 (p less than 0. 01) respectively, where the significance levels are relative to the resting values. In nine patients with good ventricular function the vasodilator nifedipine caused right and left ventricular ejection fractions to increase by the same amount; while in six patients with severe impairment of left ventricular function due to ischaemic heart disease the RVEF increased from 0. 58 +/- 0. 03 to 0. 73 +/- 0. 03 (p less than 0. 01) after 2 mg of <b>prenalterol,</b> but the left ventricular ejection fraction increased only from 0. 22 +/- 0. 04 to 0. 26 +/- 0. 04.

Cardiac arrest ensued which was responsive to cardiopulmonary resuscitation. Bradycardia, hypotension, and oliguria followed which were resistant to intravenous pacing and multiple pharmacologic interventions, including intravenous fluids, calcium, dopamine, dobutamine, epinephrine, <b>prenalterol,</b> and glucagon. Adequate mean arterial pressure and urine output were restored only after addition of phenylephrine to therapy with multiple agents and transvenous pacing. The patient survived until discharge after a hospital course complicated by nontransmural myocardial infarct on hospital day 4 and pneumonia. Laboratory testing subsequently revealed high serum levels of both atenolol and diltiazem. The atenolol level of 35 microg/mL in this patient is the highest reported associated with survival. CONCLUSION: This case illustrates severe cardiovascular toxicity after overdose of both atenolol and diltiazem.

40|$|Strips {{of human}} {{pulmonary}} arteries from patients undergoing surgery for lung tumour were incubated with [3 H]-noradrenaline. Subsequently, they were superfused with physiological salt solution containing cocaine and corticosterone. Tritium overflow from the strips was stimulated by transmural electrical impulses (2 Hz). The electrically evoked overflow of tritium consisted of 91 % unmetabolized [3 H]-noradrenaline, and this percentage was not altered by isoprenaline. Adrenaline (in {{the presence of}} rauwolscine), isoprenaline and the preferential beta 2 -adrenoceptor agonist, procaterol, concentration-dependently increased the electrically evoked tritium overflow. <b>Prenalterol,</b> a beta-adrenoceptor agonist with moderate preference for beta 1 -adrenoceptors, was considerably less active than the previously mentioned agonists; noradrenaline (in the presence of rauwolscine) was ineffective.

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to {{describe}} various positive inotropic drugs (except the cardiac glycosides) and to attempt a classification according to their mechanism of action. The most important drugs with established positive inotropic effect are summarizedfirst. Present interest focuses on the development of new agents with sufficiently high oral bioavailability and long duration of action. <b>Prenalterol</b> is a betax-adrenergic drug which appears to fulfil these criteria. Of increasing importance are drugs which combine a positive inotropic and a vasodilator effect. These include mainly the methylxanthines and possibly also the beta 2 -adrenoceptor stimulating agents salbutamol, terbutaline, fenoterol and pirbuterol. A positive inotropic and vasodilator effect is also produced by the new compounds amrinone and AR-L 115 BS. These drugs appear to resemble theophylline and other methylxanthines in that they also act mainly as phosphodiesterase inhibitors with a subsequent increase in cAMP without interference with alpha- or beta-adrenoceptors. The mechanism of the as yet only experimentally established positive inotropic effect of alpha-adrenoceptor stimulating agents, e. g. phenylephrine, is unknown. However, it is independent of the cAMP system and is not accompanied by changes in frequency. For the long-term management of congestive myocardial failure the cardiac glycosides are still the most important agents. Their exact mechanism o...|$|E
