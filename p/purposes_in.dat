A total of 5, 946 participants completed a series of scales, including the Revised Personal Functions of Volunteerism Scale, Volunteering Intention Scale, and <b>Purpose</b> <b>in</b> Life Scale. The results showed that participants whose <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life had different levels also had varied prosocial beliefs about volunteerism, volunteering intention, and volunteering behavior. <b>Purpose</b> <b>in</b> life was associated more strongly with prosocial value function than {{with other types of}} beliefs (except understanding function). When different beliefs are grouped, the correlation between <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life and other-serving beliefs was higher than that between <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life and self-serving beliefs. <b>Purpose</b> <b>in</b> life was also associated with volunteering intention and behavior. Path analyses showed that <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life predicted volunteering behavior via beliefs and intention. While other-serving beliefs predicted volunteering behavior directly, self-serving beliefs did not have such direct effect. © 2009 with author.

40|$|Graduation date: 2016 An {{ability to}} meet the {{changing}} demands associated with development promotes <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life, {{a defining feature of}} psychological well-being. Midlife adults consistently report higher <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life compared to older adults. However, less is known about the dynamics of <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life in the transition from middle to older adulthood. This mixed methods study first examined quantitative trajectories of <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life over a five year period and explored the extent to which individuals' psychosocial characteristics predicted different trajectories. A qualitative inquiry followed to gain {{a deeper understanding of the}} quantitative results by exploring ways in which midlife adults define, pursue, and adjust their <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life over time. This study used a sample of late midlife adults who took part in the Foley Longitudinal Study of Adulthood during a five-year period between 2008 and 2014. The sample included 70 African Americans and 90 White Americans (age= 55 – 58 at Time 1). <b>Purpose</b> <b>in</b> life was measured annually with the Psychological Well-Being <b>Purpose</b> <b>in</b> Life subscale. Non-normal growth mixture modeling was the statistical procedure utilized to identify patterns of <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life trajectories, and to predict such patterns using baseline characteristics, including gender, race, education, personality traits, and generativity. Results suggested <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life was stable and non-normally distributed over the five-year period. Trait conscientiousness significantly predicted higher levels of <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life after adjusting for other baseline characteristics. Moreover, African Americans tended to have higher <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life than White Americans. For subsequent qualitative analysis, a subsample of sixteen female participants was purposively sampled to explore how participants with higher and lower trajectories of <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life defined their own <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life over time. The issue associated with intersectionality of gender and race and an imbalance in high and low trajectories by race and gender led to the decision to focus on female participants. Following the review of their Time 1 and Time 5 life-story interview transcripts, the sections of future script and major life themes were selected for analysis. A thematic analysis across the subsample was used. Seven main themes emerged that captured aspects related to <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life. The participants discussed their major life themes as being proactive, being reactive, having faith, and/or centering on relationships. Their sources of <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life included self-needs, work, family relationships, personal development, caring for others, and spirituality. The findings indicated similar sources of <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life between those with higher and lower <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life, such as work, family relationships, personal development, and spirituality. However, the findings also suggested different underlying pathways to higher versus lower <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life. Those higher <b>in</b> <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life tended to attain a proactive versus reactive major life theme and to be more others- versus self-oriented. Partially supporting the quantitative result, some racial differences were identified. In terms of family relationships, White participants tended to discuss their romantic relationships with their husbands, whereas African American participants were more likely to be single and hoped to pursue marriage in the future. In terms of spirituality, there were two African Americans actively practicing spirituality by teaching others, while three White participants were searching for more concrete sense of spirituality. The effect of conscientiousness suggested by quantitative findings was not supported. Consistent with prior research, it is likely that trait conscientiousness is related to certain psychological resources to strive for <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life from a variety of sources. This study is the first longitudinal attempt to explore the trajectory of <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life late middle adulthood. A unique strength of the study is the use of mixed methods approach that incorporates survey and narrative interview data, allowing for meaningful discussions between theories of <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life and individuals who are experiencing <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life <b>in</b> daily lives. <b>Purpose</b> <b>in</b> life among the sample shows a stable non-normally distributed trajectory, in which those higher in conscientiousness and African Americans are more likely to report higher-stable <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life. The qualitative findings further provide insights into how participants may pursue <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life similarly and differently across trajectories of <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life, race, and conscientiousness. Due to the sample selection, the generalizability of these results is limited. Nevertheless, the integrative method enables a more comprehensive understanding of <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life in late midlife. Future studies should investigate development of <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life from a larger and more diverse sample, which includes men as well as women...|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{describe}} the experiences undergraduate students cite as helping them develop and articulate their <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life. <b>Purpose</b> <b>in</b> life, as a construct, is associated with many positive attributes associated with life in general, and the college experience specifically; however, it is also closely related to other concepts such as meaning, spirituality, and vocation. For the purposes of this study, <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life was defined as a set of goals or actions, informed by a belief system or set of values, that provides a sense of direction to an individual 2 ̆ 7 s life. This study sought to answer the question: What are the experiences of traditional-aged undergraduate students at a large, Midwestern, public university who have an articulated <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life? In this way, experiences were defined as a necessary, but not sufficient, building block <b>in</b> developing <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life. An orientational qualitative approach was used to answer the question. Participants were identified using maximum variance and theory-based purposeful sampling. Senior students close to graduation were recruited to participate using the Student Developmental Task 2 ̆ 6 Lifestyle Assessment (SDTLA; Winston, Miller, 2 ̆ 6 Cooper, 1999), an online assessment that operationalized Chickering and Reisser 2 ̆ 7 s (1993) sixth developmental vector, developing purpose. Twelve students with high scores on that assessment were selected to continue in the study. Face-to-face interviews focused on the experiences and relationships that helped them develop and articulate their <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life. The results were organized into three major themes: 1) support systems upon which students relied <b>in</b> developing <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life; 2) exemplars who they sought to emulate when living their <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life; and 3) the critical importance of experiential learning <b>in</b> developing <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life.

Existing theories were connected to developing <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life to provide educators ideas for helping affect the lives of students. Research implications were discussed with a call to study how individuals 2 ̆ 7 multiple aspects of identity influence developing <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life. Overall, this study contributes to the literature, adding breadth in specifically targeting undergraduate students and their shared experiences developing <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life and depth in its confirmation of Chickering and Reisser 2 ̆ 7 s twenty-year-old revised theory...|$|R
40|$|This study {{examined}} the role of resilience in habituation to heat and cold pain in healthy women (n = 47). Heat and cold pain thresholds were each assessed across 5 equally spaced trials. Re- silience, <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life, optimism, social support, and neuroticism were assessed using self-report measures. The hypothesis was that the resilience and the associated resilience factors would be pos- itively related to habituation to heat and cold pain while controlling for neuroticism. Multilevel mod- eling {{was used to test}} the hypothesis. When considering each characteristic separately, resilience and <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life predicted greater habituation to heat pain while resilience, <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life, optimism, and social support predicted greater habituation to cold pain. When controlling for the other charac- teristics, both resilience and <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life predicted greater habituation to heat and cold pain. Re- silience and associated characteristics such as a sense of <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life may be related to enhanced habituation to painful stimuli.

40|$|The {{construct}} of <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> {{life is a}} key notion discussed both by psychologists and by theologians. There are good theoretical reasons for linking the two constructs and arguing that religiosity could enhance the sense of <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life. The empirical evidence for the relationship is, however, not unambiguous. A major difficulty with earlier research concerns the problematic nature of defining both <b>purpose</b> <b>in</b> life and religiosity. The present study attempts to clarify the problem by employing new recently developed measures of both constructs. The <b>Purpose</b> <b>in</b> Life Scale (PILS) developed by Robbins and Francis (2000) provides a clear and unambiguous measure.
