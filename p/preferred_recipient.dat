Using new data on World Bank trust fund disbursements for the 2002 - 2012 period, we test whether trust fund aid substitutes for IDA inflows, and, as official narratives suggest, for other aid inflows. We also investigate the bilateralization hypothesis by comparing multilateral core aid to trust fund disbursements. Trust fund aid is generally not allocated according to World Bank s Country Policy and Institutional Assessment (CPIA) index, which could undermine the incentives generated of the IDA allocation mechanism. This result is confirmed when we consider the health, education, and environment sector separately using sector-specific CPIA scores and IDA aid. We do not find systematic evidence that trust funds are to a larger degree motivated by political and economic motives...|$|E

40|$|A {{modified}} version of the Ainsworth Strange Situation Test was used to analyse 40 dog–owner pairs in order to assess whether owners can represent a secure base for their dogs. The Wilcoxon test revealed significant differences between owner and stranger for protest at separation (whining), contact maintenance effect (proximity, attention seeking and physical contact) and secure base effect (exploration, individual play and social play). The results suggest that dogs behave similarly to children towards the mothers and to chimpanzees towards human caretakers in the Ainsworth Strange Situation Test: owners are the <b>preferred</b> <b>recipient</b> of affiliative behaviours and, in their absence, dogs show behaviours indicative of distress. After reunion with the owner, dogs show an increase in social behaviours towards him/her. Dogs did not show fear of the stranger, and it was regarded as a normal behaviour for adult well-socialized dogs. Until now whether owners represented a secure base for their dogs was debated, due to controversial results. This study found that dogs play and explore more when owners were present, suggesting that owners can represent a secure base for their dogs. Therefore, according to Bowlby’s definition, dogs are linked to their owners by an attachment bond...|$|E
40|$|The {{question}} if private donors care about aid effectiveness when they donate {{to an international}} charity has received little attention {{in the literature on}} private charitable giving as well as in development microeconomics. This discussion is important, because a considerable share of foreign aid stems from private sources. Thus, individual donors can have an important influence on increasing social welfare by directing their funds to more effective organizations. We conducted a laboratory experiment to investigate if private donors want information about the exact Impact of their donation to an international charity before they donate, and how much they care about aid impact compared to other information: namely, information about administrations costs, and the recipient type benefiting from their donation. Our main results are the following. First, the demand was lowest for information about aid effectiveness, and highest for information about the recipient type. Second, donation levels were not significantly affected by differences in aid effectiveness, but were significantly affected by differences in administration costs, and recipient types. Participants in the administrations costs group used the additional information to punish the less preferred NGO by decreasing their transfers to zero.

40|$|A {{considerable}} {{and increasing}} share {{of foreign aid}} stems from private donations. Hence, individual donors can increase social welfare in developing countries by directing their funds to the most effective NGOs. Surprisingly few studies have analyzed whether private donors care about aid effectiveness when they donate to an international charity. In a laboratory experiment, we investigate if private donors seek information about the exact impact of their donation to an international NGO before they donate. Furthermore, we investigate how relevant private donors find information about aid impact compared to information about administrative costs, and the recipient type who benefits from a donation. First, we find that a relatively small share of individuals makes a well-informed donation decision. Second, the demand for information about aid impact is lowest, and it is highest {{for information about the}} recipient type. Third, exact information about aid impact did not lead to a significant change in average donation levels, while information about the exact recipient type and administrative costs led to a significant change in donation levels.

40|$|Investigations of the dog-human bond using {{modified}} {{versions of}} the Ainsworth Strange Situation Test show some similarities in findings. However, methodological differences mean it cannot be concluded that this bond is comparable to that between children and their mothers. The {{aim of this study}} was to assess whether owners can represent an emotionally secure base for their dogs, using a modified version of the Ainsworth Strange Situation Test. The videoed behaviour of 40 companion dogs was continuously sampled. Durations (seconds) of 22 behaviours were analyzed using Wilcoxon Tests (p< 0. 05) for differences between owner and stranger situations. Significant differences in median values were found: contact with/proximity to door/chair/shoe was higher during the absence of owner vs stranger (143. 0 vs 49. 5, z= 4. 731, p= 0. 000); contact with/proximity to owner was higher than to stranger (127. 0 vs 50. 5, z= 5. 383, p= 0. 000); whining lasted longer during the absence of owner vs stranger (0. 5 vs 0. 0, z= 3. 099, p= 0. 002); exploration was higher in the presence of the owner vs stranger (20. 5 vs 6. 0, z= 2. 293, p= 0. 022); individual play was higher in the presence of owner vs stranger (2. 5 vs 0. 0; z= 3. 467, p= 0. 001). The data suggest that dogs show behaviour similar to that of children in the Ainsworth Strange Situation Test. Owners, like mothers, can represent a secure base from which the dog can play and explore; be the <b>preferred</b> <b>recipient</b> of affiliative behaviour; and, in owner absence, dogs show behaviours indicative of distress. According to Bowlby’s definitions the dogs appear to be linked to their owners by a true attachment bond. The absence of fear behaviours directed to the stranger in this study is different to that observed in children. This may reflect the different developmental stages at which children are tested versus dogs. In addition, reduced fear of strangers in dogs is known to relate to good interspecific socialization. <br/...|$|E

The sustenance of such programs as an effective therapy for end-stage organ failure (ESOF) requires an exploration of public awareness and willingness to donate organs. This is imperative, especially in developing countries where ESOF is highly prevalent. We studied the awareness and predictors of public attitude toward organ donation in Kano city in northern Nigeria. Using interviewer-administered questionnaires, we assessed the awareness and willingness to donate solid organs among 400 adults in the Kano metropolis. Three hundred and five of the 383 respondents (79. 6 %) {{reported that they had}} heard about organ donation. There was a significant variation of awareness by education and ethnicity (P < 0. 05). Most respondents, 303 (79. 1 %), were willing to donate an organ. Gender [adjusted odds ratio (AOR) = 2. 13; 95 % confidence interval (CI) : 1. 40 - 4. 95], educational attainment (AOR = 2. 55; 95 % CI: 1. 35 - 5. 88), marital status (AOR = 4. 5; 95 % CI: 2. 97 - 9. 1), religion (AOR = 3. 40; 95 % CI: 1. 43 - 8. 10) and ethnicity (AOR = 2. 36; 95 % CI 1. 04 - 5. 35) were significant predictors of willingness to donate an organ. <b>Preferred</b> organ <b>recipients</b> were parents (48. 9 %), children (21. 3 %), spouses (14. 6 %) and other relatives (13. 4 %).

40|$|The term 'Transplant Tourism' is {{becoming}} {{commonly used to}} describe any form of travel that serves in the attainment of new organs; this practice is utterly condemned by the medical community and the World Health Organisation. Medical Tourism involves tourists travelling to, 'obtain medical, dental and surgical care while simultaneously being holidaymakers' (Connell, 2006, p. 1094). British Medical Journal (2008) highlights that Medical Tourism is a billion dollar industry, where companies advertise health services and attract patients {{for a fraction of}} the price they would have paid at home (Turner, 2008 a). However, the typically legitimate Medical Tourism industry's reputation is being tarnished by its association with Transplant Tourism.

There is a worldwide struggle to meet the demand for organs; the gap between supply and demand has stimulated global organ trade and transplant tourism.

40|$|There exists an {{abundance}} of literature on {{the health benefits of}} dog-ownership and the health benefits of self-disclosure however, there has been no research into the potential health benefits of self-disclosure to dogs. This thesis addresses that gap in the literature. Among the literature on the health benefits of dog-ownership there is often a focus on the benefits to people with clinical conditions or living in care facilities – much less investigated are the benefits to ‘normally-functioning’ owners. Chapter 1 investigates the literature on the health benefits of dog-ownership to ‘normally-functioning’ owners {{in the form of a}} systematic literature review. This review highlights the need for future research to fully define the term ‘owner’ when conducting research into the owner-dog relationship and to specify the type and style of relationship being examined, since not all owner-dog relationships are equal. Chapter 2 is a two-part study. Part 1 assesses the validity of adapting an established self-disclosure scale for use with dogs. Part 2 asks: are there any topics that dog-owners would rather confide in their dog than their human partner? The results indicate that heterosexual female dog-owners are significantly more willing to confide in their dog about feelings of Depression, Jealousy, Apathy and Calmness and are significantly more willing to confide in their partner about feelings of Anger and Fear. Male dog-owners showed no significant differences in their <b>preferred</b> disclosure <b>recipient.</b> Chapter 3 builds on the research started in Chapter 2 but is a separate study with a new sample of participants. The aim of this study was to: (1) determine the differences between dog-owners and non-dog-owners’ disclosure patterns to their partner, confidante and dog, (2) determine whether dog-owners and non-dog-owners differ in their quality of life using an established quality of life scale and (3) determine whether quality of life can be predicted by disclosure patterns. The results indicate that dogs do not play the same role as confidantes, since dog-owners and non-dog-owners do not differ significantly in their disclosure patterns to their partner and confidante however, there are topics that dog-owners are significantly more willing to talk to their dogs about versus their partners and confidantes. Quality of life scores of dog-owners were higher than non-dog-owners, although self-disclosure to dogs was not predictive of these higher scores. Chapter 4 discusses the potential benefits of self-disclosure to dogs and discusses reasons behind female dog-owners’ willingness to confide in their dogs, with evidence from qualitative interviews with female dog-owners carried out as part of this research...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this study is threefold: To compare many old and new media {{channels}} in terms of a range of attributes such as perceived intrusiveness, reliability, trustworthiness, convenience, and entertainment value. To compare the perceived relative effectiveness of alternative communication channels in terms of how a marketing proposition is evaluated by recipients and thus to establish whether some channels are better than others for achieving engagement and persuasion. To additionally survey the senders of marketing communications, to examine potential differences between how senders think recipients perceive each channel and what recipients actually perceive. Moreover, it is proposed that the survey be conducted in both consumer and business markets. Design/methodology/approach – First, in a survey, the channels are compared from the perspective of both receivers and senders of marketing communications and additionally from that of consumer and business markets. Second, by means of experimentally generated scenarios, the paper assesses the relative effectiveness of the 11 channels in eliciting responses to two typical B-to-C and two B-to-B promotion offers. Findings – The paper finds that, although e-mail is well established and widely used, the traditional channels of television, radio, newspapers and direct mail retain their historically favored attributes of trust and reliability of information that make them still <b>preferred</b> by consumer <b>recipients</b> of marketing communications, even by “tech savvy” younger consumers who use e-mail and SMS extensively. Business receivers are more accepting of e-mail marketing communications than are consumers but, like consumers, they are more likely to act on a marketing offer if it comes through traditional mass media or mail channels.

40|$|PhDIn this thesis, {{the sources}} {{considered}} {{suitable for the}} study of inheritance were reviewed, and a theoretical model for a system of customary inheritance was developed. The study divides into two part seach relating either to the sources or to the model. The first part of the thesis re-evaluates the traditional divisions of sources {{for the study of}} inheritance and devises new divisions for use in this study. The second part of the thesis uses these new divisions in developing a model for the operation of inheritance and discusses the role of these sources in relation to that model. In place of the traditional division of source material for the study of inheritance, a system was devised consisting of two broad areas: Wills and Additional Documents. The area of Wills was divided into the following headings: Written Wills, Oral Declarations, Category A, B, or C Lost Wills, and Grants made while Dying. Additional Documents included the following material: Reference to an Inheritance, Reference to Property Descent, and Documents relevant to the nature of wills. The merits and limitations of these sources were discussed with reference to their preservation whether as single sheet contemporary copies or in cartularies. The theoretical model for a system of customary inheritance is relatively simple. The relationship between that system and the sources alters the traditional perspective on those sources with the result that the evidence from written wills is seen as supplemental rather than central to the study of inheritance. From this new perspective, it becomes apparent that the property donated inside wills represents only a portion of a donor's total possessions and that in the operation of the customary inheritance system, male donees are <b>preferred</b> as the <b>recipients</b> of landed property...|$|R

The selection of advertisements included A 4 sized advertisements representing the so-called indefinite gender roles published in magazines Anne and DI in 2003. I chose advertisements representing indefinite gender roles to ensure more complex and multi-layered interpretations.

The research was performed as a systematic analyses and the description method covers both the verbal and visual aspects of the advertising texts {{as well as their}} possible interactions. The task of this research paper was to reveal the hidden meanings in the chosen advertisements and evaluate both the visual and verbal aspects of the text. Similarly, I compared the results of the text analysis based on the applied theories with the opinions of the recipients of the advertisements (five Estonian men and women within the age group of 18 to 50 years) which were revealed in the performed interviews. The research showed that the chosen advertisements helped to bring forward recipients‘ concepts and preferences in relation to gender roles. Also, according to the recipients, the chosen advertisements represented relatively indefinite gender roles and often induced mixed feelings in the viewers. The <b>recipients</b> <b>preferred</b> generally more stereotypical concepts of gender roles, although in many cases it was obvious that the personal values and ideologies affected strongly their interpretations of the advertisements.

40|$|Food {{insecurity}} is {{a significant}} challenge in the world, and nowhere more than in subSaharan Africa. The policy options available to combat food insecurity have been expanding in recent years, providing increased flexibility over where-and what-food is procured, and what form of transfer recipients receive. In designing policies key questions arise related to the impacts of procuring food in developing countries, what <b>recipients</b> <b>prefer</b> to receive, and the relative impacts of cash versus food transfers. This dissertation takes a microeconomic approach to filling some of the gaps in our knowledge of food assistance policy impacts. In the first paper we exploit a unique natural experiment to assess the performance of local procurement in Burkina Faso, and to test a number of hypotheses and claims. We find that procuring locally saves time and cost, does not affect local food prices, and has positive impacts on smallholder suppliers. <b>Recipients</b> also <b>prefer</b> local commodities. In {{the second and third}} papers we develop a theoretical household model to investigate cash versus food transfers in Niger, taking advantage of a randomized trial and a large-scale household survey. The first paper examines the importance of the contents of the food basket. The model predicts that an extra-marginal transfer of a staple grain will have negative impacts on dietary diversity relative to a cash transfer, whereas an extra-marginal transfer of higher quality food will have positive impacts. I confirm that these predictions hold in Niger. The third paper examines the differential impacts of food versus cash transfers on informal credit and gift exchange. The model predicts that cash recipients {{will be more likely to}} use transfers to pay debts, and this impact will be more pronounced when food prices are rising, as the expectation of rising prices erodes the relative value of cash to food in terms of future consumption. Findings in Niger confirm these predictions, and highlight several implications of the relative scarcity of cash versus food. These papers inform food assistance policy in the Sahel, and provide a novel lens through which to understand the mechanisms behind food assistance policy impacts. 2020 - 01 - 2...|$|R

40|$|Aim: The overall aim of {{this thesis}} was to explore nursing care within Advanced home care (AHC) through nursing {{documentation}} and nurses’ perceptions of nursing care, in order to delineate the required nursing competencies Background: Home health care has increased significantly, in Europe, North America {{and other parts of}} the world. Many care <b>recipients</b> <b>prefer</b> to be treated at home and technical developments makes it possible to treat even severe sickness in the home environment. However, this also affects nursing care, and setting high demands on nurses. Methods: In study 1 nurses from four different AHC units were interviewed. In study 2 nursing records were collected from two different AHC units and nursing interventions were detected and described. Content analysis was used in both studies. A synthesis of both studies was conducted for this thesis. Findings: Study 1 comprises 2 domains; planned care and acute care. In study 2 three teams emerged; no ordinary day, daily joys and challenges and providing safe and secure care Synthesis of the 2 studies were sorted into four themes; contents of nursing care within AHC, nurse’s perception of nursing care, nursing documentation within AHC and nursing competencies needed within AHC. Nursing care Within AHC was either planned or acute. Contents of nursing care was e. g. interventions, including intravenous infusions, blood transfusions and high technology utilization Other common nursing interventions were sampling, dressing and bandaging, administration of nutritional products and administration of pharmaceuticals. Contents of nursing care also included information and education. Nurses' perceived nursing care within AHC was that this was joyful, free, rewarding and challenging; they respected patients' autonomy and appreciated patients' families. Nurses found team work essential. However, work was performed mostly alone and they encountered situations where they felt insecure. Nurses’ documentation was perceived as essential for patient safety. However, documentation was often fragmented, frequently lacked evaluation and information was hard to find. Most of the nurses interviewed lacked a specialist education but had long experience from nursing. Apart from personal qualities and maturity, nurses expressed competencies needed as high technology, pathophysiology, acute care, documentation and retrieving evidence based practice. Conclusions: There are no ordinary days within AHC and nurses perceive nursing care within AHC as joyful but challenging. To provide safe and secure care nurses need advanced knowledge and skills in advanced nursing comprising pathophysiology, high technology, medical techniques, pain and pain relief, psychology and communication. Furthermore, nurses need to appreciate PCC and FPCC. Documentation of nursing care In AHC was often fragmented and information hard to find. This could be a threat to patient safety and accurate nursing records have to be a priority. Least but not last nurses need to develop their knowledge in information techniques in order to retrieve information about best practice...|$|R
40|$|The {{results of}} the pilot {{demonstrated}} that a pharmacist delivered vaccinations services is feasible in community pharmacy and is safe and effective. The accessibility of the pharmacist across the influenza season provided the opportunity for more people to be vaccinated, particularly those who had never received an influenza vaccine before. Patient satisfaction was extremely high with nearly all patients happy to recommend the service and to return again next year. Factors {{critical to the success}} of the service were: 1. Appropriate facilities 2. Competent pharmacists 3. Practice and decision support tools 4. In-­‐store implementation support We demonstrated in the pilot that vaccination <b>recipients</b> <b>preferred</b> a private consultation area. As the level of privacy afforded to the patients increased (private room vs. booth), so did the numbers of patients vaccinated. We would therefore recommend that the minimum standard of a private consultation room or closed-­‐in booth, with adequate space for multiple chairs and a work / consultation table be considered for provision of any vaccination services. The booth or consultation room should be used exclusively for delivering patient services and should not contain other general office equipment, nor be used as storage for stock. The pilot also demonstrated that a pharmacist-­‐specific training program produced competent and confident vaccinators and that this program can be used to retrofit the profession with these skills. As vaccination is within the scope of pharmacist practice as defined by the Pharmacy Board of Australia, there is potential for the universities to train their undergraduates with this skill and provide a pharmacist vaccination workforce in the near future. It is therefore essential to explore appropriate changes to the legislation to facilitate pharmacists’ practice in this area. Given the level of pharmacology and medicines knowledge of pharmacists, combined with their new competency of providing vaccinations through administering injections, it is reasonable to explore additional vaccines that pharmacists could administer in the community setting. At the time of writing, QPIP has already expanded into Phase 2, to explore pharmacists vaccinating for whooping cough and measles. Looking at the international experience of pharmacist delivered vaccination, we would recommend considering expansion to other vaccinations in the future including travel vaccinations, HPV and selected vaccinations to those under the age of 18 years. Overall the {{results of the}} QPIP implementation have demonstrated that an appropriately trained pharmacist can deliver safely and effectively influenza vaccinations to adult patients in the community. The QPIP showed the value that the accessibility of pharmacists brings to public health outcomes through improved access to vaccinations and the ability to increase immunisation rates in the general population. Over time with the expansion of pharmacist vaccination services this will help to achieve more effective herd immunity for some of the many diseases which currently have suboptimal immunisation rates...|$|R
