50|$|The Novel Foods Regulation {{requires}} {{that a company}} wanting to sell a novel food notify Health Canada prior to marketing or advertising the product. <b>Pre-market</b> <b>notification</b> permits Health Canada to conduct a thorough safety assessment of all biotechnology-derived foods to demonstrate that a novel food is safe and nutritious before it is allowed in the Canadian marketplace.|$|E
50|$|An {{example of}} such local {{implementation}} of the Directive is now present in Italy. Italy requires, {{in addition to the}} CE marking (as opposed to the essence of the CE marking which is “Free Circulation of Goods”), that ALL Medical Devices to be placed in the Italian market will go through a Device registration process. This process is similar to the <b>pre-market</b> <b>notification</b> requirement for Class I Medical Devices (as stated in the European Directive MDD 93/42/EEC Article 14); however, in Italy it is applicable for all classes, not only Class I.|$|E
50|$|In the mid 1980s, Driskell and his {{partners}} formed a company called DB Bioengineering. DB Bioengineering received <b>pre-market</b> <b>notification</b> in October, 1985 for the implant Driskell and his team had developed at Batelle—now known as the DB Precision Fin Implant System. Two short years later, in 1987, DB engineering—along with the DB Precision Fin Implant System—were sold to the multinational conglomerate, the Stryker Corporation. At this juncture, the DB Precision Fin Implant System possessed the qualities that separated it (along with modern Bicon implants) from its competitors: a sloping shoulder, specialized titanium instrumentation, and a slow speed drilling system. Slow speed drilling was included {{in order to prevent}} the thermal damage induced by the high speeds conventional drilling.|$|E
50|$|To date, {{there have}} been two <b>pre-market</b> <b>{{notifications}}</b> filed with the FDA announcing intent to market 7-keto-DHEA as a dietary ingredient. These notifications had to demonstrate to FDA’s satisfaction that there is no issue with the safety of the subject ingredient. The FDA had no objection, in each of these notifications, to the marketing and sale of 7-keto-DHEA.|$|R
40|$|Advances {{in mobile}} {{technology}} continually create new {{possibilities for the}} future of medical care. Yet these changes have also created concerns about patient safety. Under the Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has the authority to regulate a broad spectrum of products beyond traditional medical devices like stethoscopes or pacemakers. The regulatory question is not if the FDA has the statutory authority to regulate health-related software, but rather how it will exercise its regulatory authority. In September 2013, the FDA published Final Guidance on Mobile Medical Applications; in it, the Agency limited its oversight to a small subset of medical-related mobile applications, referred to as “mobile medical applications. ” For the Final Guidance to be effective, the FDA must continue to work directly with all actors—including innovators, doctors, and patients as the market for mobile health applications continues to develop. This Note argues that the FDA should adopt a two-step plan—a <b>pre-market</b> <b>notification</b> program and a mobile medical application database—to aid in the successful implementation of its 2013 Final Guidance. By doing so, the FDA will ensure that this burgeoning market can reach its fullest potential...|$|E
