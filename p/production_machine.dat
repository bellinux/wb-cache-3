It was restarted by the Vichy government, with the wing of the wrecked prototype being combined with the hull of the first <b>production</b> <b>machine</b> to produce the Br. 730 No.1, which was ready to fly when the German invasion of Vichy France prevented testing. Production of the remaining 11 aircraft continued extremely slowly under German occupation, with eight being destroyed in an Allied air raid on 6 April 1944.|$|E

Two major new characters, the Mitchell brothers, made their first appearance in February 1990.
