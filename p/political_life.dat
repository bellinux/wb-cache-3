5|$|A 1997 Polish law {{made the}} vetting a {{requirement}} for those seeking high public office.

The 2000 presidential election was the first use of this law.|$|E
50|$|This was {{a prosperous}} {{period for the}} Armenians in Egypt, when they enjoyed commercial, {{cultural}} and religious freedom. Their numbers increased considerably as more migrants arrived from Syria and Palestine, fleeing the advance of the Seljuks westward {{during the second half}} of the 10th century. Armenian Muslims started their <b>political</b> <b>life's</b> in 1074, with an estimated population of 30,000 (possibly as high as 100,000) Armenians living in Fatimid Caliphate at the time.|$|R

5|$|The {{principle}} of the liberum veto preserved the feudal features of Poland's political system, weakened {{the role of the}} monarchy, led to anarchy in <b>political</b> <b>life,</b> and contributed to the economic and political decline of the Polish state. Such a situation made the country vulnerable to foreign invasions and ultimately led to its collapse.|$|E
5|$|After Syria became {{independent}} in 1946, al-Bakri joined the pro-Western and Arab nationalist People's Party. President al-Atassi assigned him ambassador to Jordan, {{ruled by the}} Hashemites, after al-Bakri refused the ambassadorial post to Saudi Arabia, a government that he opposed ideologically. Following Adib al-Shishakli's seizure of the presidency in 1953, al-Bakri resigned. After al-Shishakli stepped down in 1954, al-Bakri {{became president of the}} People's Party. He was unsuccessful in establishing a significant support base in Damascus and resigned from <b>political</b> <b>life</b> in April 1957. He died in 1966.|$|E

5|$|As a {{criminal}} lawyer who took on dramatic cases, Macdonald got himself noticed {{well beyond the}} narrow confines of the Kingston business community.

5|$|By the mid-15th century, Magna Carta {{ceased to}} occupy {{a central role in}} English <b>political</b> <b>life,</b> as monarchs reasserted {{authority}} and powers which had been challenged in the 100 years after Edward I's reign. The Great Charter remained a text for lawyers, particularly as a protector of property rights, and became more widely read than ever as printed versions circulated and levels of literacy increased.|$|E
5|$|Characteristic of {{the turn}} of the 10th century in most Polish tribal {{settlement}} areas was a particular intensification of gord building activity. The gords were the centers of social and <b>political</b> <b>life.</b> Tribal leaders and elders had their headquarters in their protected environment and some of the tribal general assemblies took place inside them. Religious cult locations were commonly located in the vicinity, while the gords themselves were frequently visited by traders and artisans.|$|E

The scandal over the labor {{flexibility}} law was renewed in 2003 when a former Senate worker, Mario Pontaquarto, {{claimed to be}} a witness of the case who delivered $5,000,000 to the legislators. De la Rúa was indicted alongside seven politicians from both the UCR and the PJ. In 2013, they were all cleared of charges by a unanimous resolution, and Pontaquarto was removed from the witness protection program.|$|E
5|$|Five leading {{families}} or factions contended for power during this period—the Shahs, Thapas, Basnyats, Pandes, and the Chautariyas, who were of Shah dynasty but acted as counselors for the King. Working for these {{families and their}} factions were hill Brahmans, who acted as religious preceptors or astrologers, and Newars, who occupied secondary administrative positions. No {{one else in the}} country had any influence on the central government. When a family or faction achieved power, it killed, exiled, or demoted members of opposing alliances. Under these circumstances, there was little opportunity for either public <b>political</b> <b>life</b> or coordinated economic development.|$|E
5|$|In 1805 Harrison built a plantation-style {{home near}} Vincennes that he named Grouseland, {{alluding}} to the birds on the property; the thirteen-room home {{was one of the}} first brick structures in the territory. During his term as territorial governor, Harrison's home served as a center of social and <b>political</b> <b>life</b> in the territory. The farm has been restored and is a popular, modern-day tourist attraction. After the territorial capital was moved to Corydon in 1813, Harrison built a second home at nearby Harrison Valley.|$|E

5|$|In {{her later}} works, such as A Vindication of the Rights of Men (1790) and A Vindication of the Rights of Woman (1792), Wollstonecraft {{repeatedly}} {{returns to the}} topics addressed in Thoughts, particularly the virtue {{of hard work and}} the imperative for women to learn useful skills. Wollstonecraft suggests that the social and <b>political</b> <b>life</b> of the nation would greatly improve if women were to acquire valuable skills instead of being mere social ornaments.|$|E
5|$|Many {{of those}} in the protest {{movements}} were young children {{at the time of the}} invasion and had been educated under the Indonesian system. They resented the repression of Timorese cultural and <b>political</b> <b>life</b> at the expense of the Indonesian, were ambivalent of Indonesian economic development, and spoke Portuguese amongst themselves, stressing their Portuguese heritage. Seeking help from Portugal for self-determination, they considered Indonesia an occupying force. Abroad, Fretilin's members—most notably former journalist José Ramos-Horta (later to be Prime Minister and President)—pushed their cause in diplomatic forums.|$|E
5|$|McClellan's {{experiences}} in the war would shape his military and <b>political</b> <b>life.</b> He learned that flanking movements (used by Scott at Cerro Gordo) are often better than frontal assaults, {{and the value of}} siege operations (Veracruz). He witnessed Scott's success in balancing political with military affairs, and his good relations with the civil population as he invaded, enforcing strict discipline on his soldiers to minimize damage to property. McClellan also developed a disdain for volunteer soldiers and officers, particularly politicians who cared nothing for discipline and training.|$|E

5|$|PADESM has had {{a lasting}} impact on <b>political</b> <b>life</b> in Madagascar.

Many other major political figures in Madagascar have connections to PADESM and PSD, including former president Didier Ratsiraka and former prime minister Jacques Sylla. More broadly, the formation of PADESM cemented ethnic rivalries within Malagasy politics, linking the interests of specific ethnic groups with particular political parties.|$|E
5|$|Robert rewarded Ranulf for {{his advice}} during the {{invasion}} by entrusting {{him with the}} administration of the see of Lisieux. After Robert's defeat by Henry at Tinchebray in 1106, the bishop {{was among the first to}} make his peace with Henry, and returned to Durham. He retired from <b>political</b> <b>life.</b> Henry had already replaced him with Roger of Salisbury an able financier who was infinitely more acceptable to the nation. Although some historians have theorised that Ranulf's time in Normandy was as an agent of Henry, it appears that Ranulf was mainly looking out for his own interests and those of his family.|$|E
