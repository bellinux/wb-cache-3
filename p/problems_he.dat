40|$|The author {{considers}} {{the problem of}} reconstructing a continuous function on Rn from certain values of its spherical means. A novel aspect of the approach {{is the use of}} geometric inversion to recast the inverse spherical mean problem as an inverse Radon transform <b>problem.</b> <b>He</b> defines two spherical mean inverse problems: the entire problem and the causal <b>problem.</b> <b>He</b> then presents a dual filtered backprojection algorithm for the entire problem and an invariant imbedding algorithm for the causal <b>problem.</b> <b>He</b> shows how geometric inversion can be used to transform the entire and causal problems into complete and exterior inverse Radon transform <b>problems,</b> respectively. <b>He</b> also {{considers the}} uniqueness <b>problem,</b> for which <b>he</b> proves a sufficiently theorem and notes an application of these results to diffraction tomography...|$|R
