5|$|Matangi {{represents}} {{the power of}} the spoken word (Vaikhari) as an expression of thoughts and the mind. She also relates to the power of listening and grasping speech and converting it back to knowledge and thought. Besides spoken word, she also governs all other expressions of inner thought and knowledge, like art, music and dance. Matangi presides over the middle <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> (Madhyama), where ideas are translated into the spoken word and in her highest role, represents Para-Vaikhari—the Supreme Word manifested through speech and that encompasses knowledge of the scriptures. She is described as the goddess of learning and speech, and the bestower of knowledge and talent. She is also called Mantrini, the mistress of the sacred mantras. She also {{represents the}} word of a guru, who serves as a spiritual guide. Matangi is described as dwelling in the Throat chakra—the origin of speech—and on the tip of the tongue. She is also associated with a channel called Sarasvati from the third eye to the tip of the tongue. According to David Frawley, her description as impure refers {{to the nature of the}} spoken word, which labels things and stereotypes them, thereby hindering actual contact with the soul of things. The goddess is described as one who helps a person to use words in the right way and to go beyond it to seek the soul and inner knowledge, which lie outside the demarcated boundaries of tradition.|$|E

English Education Department. Faculty of Tarbiyah and Teacher Training. State Islamic Institute (IAIN) of Tulungagung. Advisor: Dr. Nurul Choyimah, M. Pd. Keywords: Effectiveness, Song Lyrics, <b>Parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>Speech</b> 	The use <b>of</b> {{song lyrics}} as {{material}} {{in the classroom is}} very nice activity. It can be something attractive for the students. They can learn the material through the lyrics of song and sing the lyrics of song. It makes the students’ emotion to be good. So, they can enthusiastic and motivated to learn English material (<b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech).</b> But in the fact, the students still feel difficult in identifying <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech.</b> Furthermore, the researcher tries to help the students’ ability in identifying <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> by learning the lyrics of song as the {{material in the}} classroom. The formulation of the research problems are: 1) How is the students’ score in identifying <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> before being taught by using song lyrics? 2) How is the students’ score in identifying <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> after being taught by using song lyrics? 3) Is there any significant difference between the students’ score in identifying <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> before and after being taught by using song lyrics? The purpose of this research are: 1) To find out the students’ score in identifying <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> before being taught by using song lyrics. 2) To find out the students’ score in identifying <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> after being taught by using song lyrics. 3) To find out the significant difference between the students’ score in identifying <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> before and after being taught by using song lyrics. Research Method: 1) The research design in this study was pre-experimental design in the form of One-Group Pretest-Posttest designs with quantitative approach, 2) The population of this research is all students of eight grade at SMPN 1 Sumbergempol Tulungagung, 3) The sample was VIII B class consisting of 32 students, 4) The research instrument was test (pre-test and post-test), 5) The data analysis was using paired sample T- test by using SPSS 16. 0 for windows. The result showed that students’ score in identifying <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> before being taught by using song lyrics is 72. 66, while the students’ score in identifying <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> after being taught by using song lyrics is 85. 78.

25|$|Occasionally a new {{preposition}} is coined. Because a {{bare root}} may indicate a preposition or interjection, removing the grammatical suffix from another <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> {{can be used}} to derive a preposition or interjection. For example, from fari (to do, to make) we get the preposition far (done by).|$|E
25|$|Adjectival participles {{have all}} the {{adjectival}} characteristics: three genders (masculine, feminine, neuter), pronominal forms, mostly identical declension and sometimes even degrees of comparison. Their primary function is to describe a nominal <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> (usually a noun), like any adjective would in their position, hence they are matched by gender, case and number with the noun they are describing.|$|E
25|$|Speech Awareness: The {{awareness}} of individual {{parts of speech}} as they apply to individual written characters is crucial for understanding reading (as defined by translating written characters into spoken language).

25|$|Timucua was an SOV language; that is, the phrasal {{word order}} was subject–object–verb, unlike the English order of subject–verb–object. There are six parts of speech: verbs, nouns, pronouns, {{modifiers}} (there {{is no difference}} between adjectives and adverbs in Timucua), demonstratives, and conjunctions.

25|$|Compound {{words in}} Esperanto {{are similar to}} English, in that the final root is basic to the meaning.

40|$|<b>Parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> {{are called}} the most important, from a {{particular}} point of view, word classes. In the European tradition <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> have been recovered by ancient grammarians, their classification reflect the essential properties of the Greek and Latin languages and, presumably, were based on psycholinguistic representations of the speakers of these languages, in which the <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> have maximum expressiveness in morphology, syntax and lexis. <b>Parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> were distinguished primarily on morphological characteristics, sometimes based on syntactic and semantic features. This classification has been preserved with some modifications to the present day, but {{since the beginning of}} the XX century there has been attempts to clarify the conventional approach, which could also be different. In other traditions, as well, there were comparable with European basic <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> units <b>of</b> classes, but there could be certain differences. The traditional notion <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> may have a different value depending on the structure of the language. Modern typology explores the boundaries of this importance. Apparently, the traditional division <b>of</b> <b>parts</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> hide some intuitive ideas. The human memory words as you can assume, are stored in the form of some groups that have common properties. Stored in the memory word groups can not be completely common in their properties, but for various languages typical is the use of some obvious properties, allowing them to be identified. These identities for many languages are the morphological and/or syntactic properties of groups of words. All these features may act in different ways depending on the structure of the language...|$|R

25|$|Recall {{memory is}} linked with {{instincts}} and mechanisms {{in order to}} remember how an event happened to learn from it or avoid the agitator, connections are made with emotions. For instance, if a speaker is very calm and neutral, the effectiveness of encoding memory is very low and listeners get the gist of what the speaker is discussing. On the other hand, if a speaker is shouting and/or using emotionally driven words, listeners tend to remember key phrases {{and the meaning of}} the speech. This is full access of the fight or flight mechanism all people have functioning in the brain, but based on what triggers this mechanism will lead to better recall of it. People tend to focus their attention on cues that are loud, very soft, or something unusual. This makes the auditory system pick up the differences in regular speaking and meaningful speech, when something significant is spoken in the discussion people home in on the message at that part of the speech but tend to lose {{the other part of the}} discussion. Our brains sense differences in speech and when those differences occur the brain encodes that <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> into memory and the information can be recalled for future reference.|$|E
25|$|The {{meanings}} of part-of-speech affixes {{depend on the}} inherent <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>speech</b> of the root they are applied to. For example, brosi (to brush) {{is based on a}} nominal root (and therefore listed in modern dictionaries under the entry broso), whereas kombi (to comb) is based on a verbal root (and therefore listed under kombi). Change the suffix to -o, and the similar {{meanings of}} brosi and kombi diverge: broso is a brush, the name of an instrument, whereas kombo is a combing, the name of an action. That is, changing verbal kombi (to comb) to a noun simply creates the name for the action; for the name of the tool, the suffix -ilo is used, which derives words for instruments from verbal roots: kombilo (a comb). On the other hand, changing the nominal root broso (a brush) to a verb gives the action associated with that noun, brosi (to brush). For the name of the action, the suffix -ado will change a derived verb back to a noun: brosado (a brushing). Similarly, an abstraction of a nominal root (changing it to an adjective and then back to a noun) requires the suffix -eco, as in infaneco (childhood), but an abstraction of an adjectival or verbal root merely requires the nominal -o: belo (beauty). Nevertheless, redundantly affixed forms such as beleco are acceptable and widely used.|$|E

[...] From then until the 1940s, linguists such as Ma, Wang Li, and Li Jinxi treated classifiers as just a type of noun that [...] "expresses a quantity". Lü Shuxiang {{was the first to}} treat them as a separate category, calling them [...] "unit words" [...] (dānwèicí) in his 1940s Outline of Chinese Grammar (...) and finally [...] "measure words" [...] (liàngcí) in Grammar Studies (...) [...] He made this separation {{based on the fact that}} classifiers were semantically bleached, and that they can be used directly with a number, whereas true nouns need to have a measure word added before they can be used with a number. After this time, other names were also proposed for classifiers: Gao Mingkai called them [...] "noun helper words" [...] (zhùmíngcí), Lu Wangdao [...] "counting markers" [...] (jìbiāo), and Japanese linguist Miyawaki Kennosuke called them [...] "accompanying words" [...] (péibàncí). In the Draft Plan for a System of Teaching Chinese Grammar (...) adopted by the People's Republic of China in 1954, Lü's [...] "measure words" [...] (liàngcí) was adopted as the official name for classifiers in China.
