40|$|Identified as a {{strategic}} area, supply chain transformation plays {{a critical role in}} today’s IBM business. In this paper, we introduce an effort in IBM Research Division named SmartSCOR, which provides a comprehensive framework and methodology for On-Demand SCM problem-solving based on the cross-industry <b>process</b> standard Supply <b>Chain</b> Operations Reference (SCOR) model and a variety of simulation/optimization techniques. SmartSCOR sees transformation in two different levels, from supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> design/redesign to supply <b>chain</b> <b>process</b> improvement. Supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> design/redesign transforms a supply chain in a fundamental manner by means of manufacturing and distribution network reconfiguration, value chain integration, etc. Supply <b>chain</b> <b>process</b> improvement helps align the underlying business processes to strategy setting and get them streamlined. The two levels interact with each other and result in a profound while smooth transformation. SmartSCOR has been successfully applied in two supply chain transformation projects for validation and hardening...|$|R

40|$|The {{processing}} of innovative lightweight materials to sheet metal components and assemblies with globally or locally defined properties {{is the object}} of joint research at the Fraunhofer Institute for Machine Tools IWU and Forming Technology and the Professorship Forming and Joining UFF of Technische Universität Chemnitz. It takes a load-dependent design of components and assemblies e. g. based on the composition of different construction materials or a targeted setting of component areas with specified characteristics to fully exploit the lightweight potential when substituting conventionally used materials. Different <b>process</b> <b>chains</b> for the manufacturing of roll formed long products made of magnesium alloys and high strength steels with locally defined properties will be presented in this paper. Depending on the kind of material to be formed and the desired product characteristics, different temperature managements are needed for capable processes. Due to limited formability at room temperature, Magnesium alloys require a heating of the forming zones above 200 to 225 °C throughout the bending process in order to activate additional gliding planes and to avoid any failures in the radii. The realization of local hardening effects requires at least one process-integrated heat treatment when roll forming Manganese-boron steels. For both processes it is imperative to realize a heating and cooling down or quenching appropriate for the manufacturing of long products with the required quality. Additionally proper line speeds that allow a continuously operated economical production have to be considered. Research results including design, FEA, realization and experimentation of the mentioned <b>process</b> <b>chains</b> and <b>strategies</b> will be described in detail...|$|R

40|$|Purpose. The {{purpose of}} this paper is two-fold: first, to propose a {{framework}} that can be used to represent a supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> for a business unit in a clear and actionable manner; second, to propose a method that can be used to elicit the factual as is supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> that a business unit currently has in place. Approach. A framework to represent a supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> for a business unit was developed through an inductive theory-generation approach. A method to elicit the current as is supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> of a business unit was developed through collaborative management research projects and validated by several third party projects. Findings. The proposed method and framework were used to elicit the as is supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> of business units in nine different projects, mostly conducted by third parties. In every case, the validity of the result was confirmed by the business unit. Research limitations. The proposed framework and method have limited scalability beyond a single business unit. Also, they may be less useful when the supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> is undergoing a dramatic transformation. Originality.

40|$|This article {{reports on}} an {{investigation}} of supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategies</b> that are employed by light vehicle manufacturers in South Africa. The research method used was an exploratory and descriptive study. A face-to-face, semi-structured interview questionnaire was administered to senior supply chain practitioners, based on purposive sampling and the data was analyzed descriptively using SPSS software. The findings of the study revealed that both lean and agile supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategies</b> are employed by the manufacturers. All the light vehicle manufacturers followed a lean strategy for their inbound supply chain. While {{a few of them}} followed a lean supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> for their outbound supply chain, others followed an agile supply chain which suggests a leagile supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy.</b> Three important conclusions can be drawn from the study. Firstly, despite the changing business conditions and increased customer demands, lean supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> is still the dominant strategy for light vehicle manufacturers in South Africa. Secondly, a supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> is not all about product characteristics as a determining factor. There are other criteria {{that could be used to}} determine supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategies.</b> Finally, light vehicle manufacturers do not always make decisions and implement practices in line with their chosen supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategies.</b> Hence, there are mismatch between practices and strategies.

The {{purpose of this study is}} to determine the extent to which supply chain technology moderates the relationship between supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategies</b> and performance of large-scale manufacturing firms in Kenya. Proportionate sampling was used to obtain a sample of one hundred and thirty-eight (138) from a population of six hundred and twenty-seven (627) large scale manufacturing firms. The descriptive statistics, reliability and validity tests of the constructs, correlation analysis, regression analysis and factor analysis models were used to test the hypotheses. The findings indicate that there is a strong significant relationship between supply chain technologies, supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategies</b> and firm performance, implying that both supply chain technology and supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategies</b> explain 88. 2 % of the changes in the firm's performance. The net effect of both supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategies</b> and technologies is explained by the coefficient of product moderating variable (SC Strategy*Technology beta = 0. 532) which shows that supply chain technology is a significant moderator of the relationship between supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategies</b> and firm performance.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{contribute}} to knowledge {{in the form of}} a new theory for supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> formulation. The objective is to design evaluation criteria, specific to the context of greenfield project architecture and integration design. This study addressed the aim and objective by synthesising existing methods and techniques which are outlined into a research framework of supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> problems. The study applied the case study and action research methods to pursue conceptual validity from the process of investigating the supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> formulation in a specific situation and presented the data collection and analysis process. The thesis derived a conceptual framework for investigating and identifying the relationship between multiple elements, dimensions, forces and factors that influence and affect supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> formulation in a greenfield project context, specific to the mining industry. The contribution to knowledge emerged from building upon the architecture of the conceptual framework, through synthesising existing techniques and adapting these techniques, to extend and redefine the existing knowledge on the practice of supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> formulation. Through critical analysis, a number of critical problems emerged and the process of addressing these problems, resulted with a new framework for evaluating the relationship between business and supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy,</b> specific to greenfield project and integration context. The contribution to knowledge also derived from addressing the emerging obstacles in the process of identifying, defining and formulating, the visions and goals of individual supply chain participants from implicit into an explicit form. The process synthesised the knowledge for conceptualising the idea, through developing and evaluating information and issues, to derive insights into the complex and abstract concept, of greenfield project business and supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> formulation. The conceptual framework and evaluation framework advanced into designing greenfield project supply <b>chain</b> integration <b>strategy.</b> The <b>process</b> involved categorising individual supply chain strategic interests, decisions and problems into formulation areas, and was aimed at defining the process of greenfield project integration strategy as a system of concepts containing formulation areas, formulation principles, segregated into subcategories of formulation imperatives and formulation concepts.

40|$|A {{variety of}} events inside a firm {{and in its}} {{environment}} can motivate managers to rethink their supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy.</b> However, the evaluation and reformulation of a firm's supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> is not a trivial problem, and has no clear answer in the literature. Part of the difficulty stems from the 'elusiveness' of strategy, but additionally supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategies</b> are often left tacit, which makes their discussion more difficult. In this thesis we develop {{a better understanding of}} supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> and of the strategic imperative it is expected to support. We also present a methodology we developed, tested and refined to capture, evaluate and reformulate the supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> of a firm. For this, make extensive use of two research methodologies: grounded theory and action research. Working with a pool of 20 secondary case studies, we employ grounded theory to develop {{a better understanding of how}} the strategic imperative is articulated and communicated to the functions. Working on one particularly rich case study, we then develop a better understanding of supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy,</b> and of how it serves as bridge between the operations in the field with the strategic imperative. This understanding was later tested and refined through two action research projects. Based on the literature, and adapting some principles from tested methodologies in other fields, we devise a methodology to capture, evaluate and reformulate the supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> of a firm. Our proposed methodology was tested and refined during our two action research projects. Our data sources during these projects included 68 interviews, eleven panel discussions, and six online questionnaires. The resulting methodology to capture, evaluate and reformulate a supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> is presented in this thesis, divided into three distinct yet interdependent phases. The first phase, 'capture', proposes steps to reveal and conceptualize a firm's supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> to render it explicit and tractable as a conceptual system. The output of the first phase, the 'Functional Strategy Map,' will serve as platform or the next two phases. The second phase, 'evaluation', assesses the merits and flaws of the firm's supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> in its current form along three dimensions: alignment, coverage and sufficiency. Central to our alignment evaluation is a tool we call 'evaluation matrices', which we compare to other matrix-form tools used in related fields, including the 'design structure matrix' (DSM) and the 'techniques-tools matrix'. The third phase, 'reformulation', proposes a novel approach to reformulate the supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy.</b> This approach is built upon the principles of controlled convergence, yet operates using an original structure and a set of rules, amenable to the problem of supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> reformulation, devised to promote alignment, coverage and sufficiency. Every step of every phase is presented in full detail, and illustrated using examples from actual deployments, to facilitate the replication of this methodology by managers and by other researchers. The results and limitations of the methodology are discussed, and suggestions for further research are provided. Although the thesis is focused on supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy,</b> we anticipate the methodology we have proposed should be, for the most part, applicable to other sets of interrelated functional strategies. by Roberto Joaquin Perez-Franco.

The procedure enables the user to systematically capture and structure the press hardening <b>process</b> <b>chain</b> and subsequently develop a comprehensive model of the whole <b>process</b> <b>chain.</b> As a result, it allows to calculate the energy requirements for each stage of the <b>process</b> <b>chain,</b> and later on the <b>process</b> <b>chain</b> as a whole. The intention of the developed procedure is to provide a tool to detect the most energy efficient variant from a range of possible <b>process</b> <b>chains...</b>|$|R
40|$|Supply Chain Management (SCM) aims to {{synchronize}} {{the requirements}} of customers with the flow of materials from suppliers, {{in order to satisfy}} the needs of the customers as costefficiently as possible. This has become a difficult task due to several developments in the market, such as increased competition, increased demand variability, increased product variety, increased amounts of customer-specific products, and shortening product life cycles. These developments, due in part to globalization, provide additional management challenges and new practices in which supply chains are designed and managed, and can eventually make the difference between companies staying competitive or not. The overall purpose of this thesis is to investigate how complexity and globalization affect supply chain design and operations. The main emphasis has been on producing descriptive results of the studied phenomenon. This research involves five case studies covering international transportation structures used in SCM, the selection of supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategies</b> in different business environments, and the role of information systems and technology in achieving the objective of SCM. In this thesis it has been concluded that in order to cope with increasingly complex and fragmented markets companies need more differentiated transportation structures, modes, and supply chains. Furthermore, to effectively manage this, information systems and advanced decision support tools are required. In addition, this thesis has shown that current taxonomies for supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> selection are too simplistic due to three major problems: they mediate that {{it is a question of}} choosing one supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> for the entire company, they regard markets as rather homogeneous, and they link each supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> to a specific business context. Instead, it has been concluded that in order to better satisfy differing customer needs in various markets it is increasingly necessary to develop a differentiated supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> by utilizing different manufacturing and delivery strategies concurrently. Thus, a need exists for new taxonomies for supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> selection which recognize that the markets are becoming more fragmented and complex, that customer preferences differ across customer/market segments, and that there is a need to differentiate the supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy.</b> This thesis also highlights several requirements of a differentiated supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy.</b> Firstly, extended supply chain collaboration is required, since a differentiated supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> will involve more supply chain partners than a traditional supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy.</b> Secondly, there is a need for more transportation mode alternatives, particularly intermodal, both in supply and distribution operations, due to the fact that differentiation requires diversity. In this thesis, intermodal landbridge freight services are highlighted as one interesting avenue, which could potentially facilitate a more differentiated supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy.</b> Thirdly, more integrated information systems are needed along with decision support tools. This study illustrates that agent based modeling appears to be an interesting method for developing realistic decision support tools in the context of complex supply chains. An interesting aspect for further research is to investigate how different manufacturing and delivery strategies can be used concurrently in international supply chains. Moreover, there are several requirements and opportunities of a differentiated supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy,</b> and these have to be investigated furthe...|$|R
40|$|Purpose This paper {{addresses}} the increasingly important question of supply chain design for global operations. With {{the rise of}} off-shore sourcing and the simultaneous need for improved responsiveness to customer demand, the choice of supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> is critical. Design/methodology/approach The paper draws its conclusions from case-based research supported by survey data. Findings The paper provides evidence that the choice of supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> should be based upon a careful analysis of the demand/supply characteristics of the various product/markets served by a company. It presents {{the basis for a}} taxonomy of appropriate supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategies.</b> Practical implications Given the increasing trend to out-sourcing and off-shore sourcing, the choice of supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> is of some significance and clearly impacts competitive performance. Originality/value Whilst there is a growing recognition of the need to match the supply chain to the market, there is still limited research into what criteria should be utilised to aid th...|$|R

S. competitiveness by analyzing the case of Boeing 787 Dreamliner recent lithium-ion battery overheating incident. Boeing 787, a new and complex product, has outsourced 70 % of its parts and components with a redesigned global supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy.</b> The grounding of all 50 Boeing 787 s already in service by the U. S. FAA on January 16, 2013, has trigged a renewed debate on product quality {{as a result of}} extensive outsourcing {{and its impact on the}} overall U. S. competitiveness. While this incident is a result of in-flight battery fire with Japan Airlines, along with a similar case occurred earlier in January 2013 in Boston with the same airline company, many believe Boeing’s new aggressive supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> may have contributed to its quality and safety problems. Managerial implications are discussed to generalize the impact of various global supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategies</b> on product quality and overall U. S. competitiveness...|$|R
40|$|Supply chain {{management}} {{has become one}} of the most popular approaches to en-hance the global competitiveness of business corporations today. Firms must have clear strategic thinking in order to effectively organize such complicated activities, resources, communications, and processes. An emerging body of literature offers a framework that identifies three kinds of supply <b>chain</b> strategies: lean <b>strategy,</b> agile strategy, and lean/agile strategy based on in-depth case studies. Extant research also suggests that supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategies</b> must be matched with product characteristics in order for firms to achieve better performance. This article investigates supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategies</b> and em-pirically tests the supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategy</b> model that posits lean, agile, and lean/agile approaches using data collected from 604 manufacturing firms in China. Cluster anal-yses of the data indicate that Chinese firms are adopting a variation of lean, agile, and lean/agile supply <b>chain</b> <b>strategies</b> identified in the western literature. However, the data reveal that some firms have a traditional strategy that does not emphasize either lean or agile principles. These firms perform worse than firms that have a strategy focuse...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{current trends}} of product {{customization}} and repair of high value parts with individual defects demand automation {{and a high}} degree of flexibility of the involved manufacturing <b>process</b> <b>chains.</b> To determine the corresponding requirements this paper gives an overview of manufacturing <b>process</b> <b>chains</b> by distinguishing between horizontal and vertical <b>process</b> <b>chains.</b> The established way of modeling and programming processes with CAx systems and existing approaches is shown. Furthermore, the different types of possible adaptions of a manufacturing <b>process</b> <b>chain</b> are shown and considered as a cascaded control loop. Following this it is discussed which key requirements of repair <b>process</b> <b>chains</b> are unresolved by existing approaches. To overcome the deficits this paper introduces repair features which comprise the idea of geometric features and defines analytical auxiliary geometries based on the measurement input data. This meets challenges normally caused by working directly on reconstructed geometries in the form of triangulated surfaces which are prone to artifacts. Embedded into function blocks, this allows the use of traditional approaches for manufacturing <b>process</b> <b>chains</b> to be applied to adaptive repair <b>process</b> <b>chains...</b>|$|R
