Mosquito control in the port area is being undertaken by two agencies, namely, the Chennai Port Trust and the Port Health Organisation. Anti-mosquito measures are undertaken by the Port Trust while the issuance of yellow fever certificates, ship deratting and overall supervision of mosquito control is undertaken by the Port Health Organisation.|$|E
500|$|In January 2015 a {{transgender}} Jewish woman, Kay Long, {{was denied}} access to the Wall, first by the women's section {{and then by the}} men's section. Long's presence was prevented by [...] "modesty police" [...] at women’s section who are not associated with the rabbi of the Western Wall or the site administration. They are a group of female volunteers who guard the entrance to the women’s section <b>preventing</b> <b>entry</b> to visitors who are not dressed to their idea of Orthodox modesty standards for women. The director of Jerusalem’s Open House, a community center for the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, noted that Long’s experience was not unique. [...] "Gender separation at the Western Wall is harmful for transgender people. This is not the first story that we know of with transgender religious people that {{wanted to go to the}} Western Wall and pray and couldn’t," [...] said Elinor Sidi, who expects that the battle for access to the Western Wall for the LGBTQ community will be a long and difficult one. It was later asserted that Kay Long would have been permitted in the women's section except for her clothing. [...] "It was not an issue of her gender, but the way she was dressed." ...|$|E

2500|$|HIV infects a cell through fusion {{with the}} cell membrane, which {{requires}} two different cellular molecular participants, CD4 and a chemokine receptor (differing {{depending on the}} cell type). [...] Approaches to blocking this virus/cell fusion have shown some promise in <b>preventing</b> <b>entry</b> of the virus into a cell. [...] At least one of theses entry inhibitors—a biomimetic peptide marketed under the brand name Fuzeon—has received FDA approval {{and has been in}} use for some time. [...] Potentially, one of the benefits from the use of an effective entry-blocking or entry-inhibiting agent is that it potentially may not only prevent the spread of the virus within an infected individual but also the spread from an infected to an uninfected individual.|$|E

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the stability of}} collusion in a market where firms cannot <b>prevent</b> <b>entry.</b> In a symmetric, homogeneous oligopoly there are collusive long-run equilibria under which the colluders obtain positive economic rents while they do not <b>prevent</b> <b>entry</b> of firms up to a maximum equal to {{the largest number of}} firms sustainable at a single shot equilibrium. The collusion is not generous to new entrants; their profits are a little better than those associated with the discounted single shot equilibrium. Eventually entrants obtain profits equal to the incumbent firms. We extend the results to asymmetric, differentiated oligopolies...|$|R

50|$|Because {{the only}} way of {{developing}} acanthocephaliasis is through ingesting the intermediate hosts, the most effective means of prevention is avoiding the consumption of beetles and cockroaches. This is especially difficult in children exhibiting pica and in areas with poor hygiene. Awareness campaigns on the risks of consuming infected beetles and cockroaches would be effective. Moreover, <b>preventing</b> <b>entry</b> of the intermediate hosts into the home, and especially the kitchen where it is at risk of getting into the food, would help curb the risk of becoming infected.|$|E
