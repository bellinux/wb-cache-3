40|$|A {{workshop}} to reappraise {{the previous}} IWGT recommendations for <b>photogenotoxicity</b> testing [E. Gocke, L. Muller, P. J. Guzzie, S. Brendler-Schwaab, S. Bulera, C. F. Chignell, L. M. Henderson, A. Jacobs, H. Murli, R. D. Snyder, N. Tanaka, Considerations on photochemical genotoxicity: {{report of the}} International Workshop on Genotoxicity Test Procedures working group, Environ. Mol. Mutagen., 35 (2000) 173 - 184] was recently held {{as part of the}} 5 th International Workshop on Genotoxicity Testing (IWGT) meeting in Basel, Switzerland (August 17 - 19, 2009). An Expert Panel was convened from regulatory, academic and industrial scientists (with several members serving on the original panel) and chaired by Dr Peter Kasper (BfArM, Germany). The aim of the workshop was to review progress made in photo(geno) toxicity testing over the past decade; a period which saw the introduction of several regulatory photosafety guidances in particular in Europe and the USA. Based on current regulatory guidelines a substantial proportion of compounds trigger the requirements for photosafety testing. Moreover, there has been growing concern within industry about the performance of the in vitro photosafety tests in the "real world" of compound development. Therefore, the expert group reviewed the status of the current regulatory guidance's and the impact these have had on compound development {{in the context of the}} various triggers for photosafety testing. In addition, the performance of <b>photogenotoxicity</b> assays (old and new) was discussed, particularly in view of reports of pseudophotoclastogencity. The Expert Panel finished with an assessment of the positioning of <b>photogenotoxicity</b> testing within a photosafety testing strategy. The most significant conclusion made by the Expert Panel was that <b>photogenotoxicity</b> testing should no longer be recommended as part of the standard photosafety testing strategy. In addition, progress was made on the refinement of triggers for photosafety testing. For example, there was support for harmonisation of methods to determine the Molar Extinction Coefficient (MEC) and a consensus agreement that there should be no requirement for testing of compounds with a MEC< 1000 Lmol- 1 cm- 1. © 2011 Elsevier B.

40|$|Regulatory requirements: According to {{the current}} Notes for Guidance of the Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-Food Products (SCCNFP), {{cosmetic}} ingredients and mixtures of ingredients absorbing UV light (in particular UV filter chemicals used, for example, to ensure the light stability of cosmetics or used in sun protection products) should be tested for acute phototoxic and photogenotoxic potential. Testing for photosensitisation (immunological photoallergy) potential is not specifically required, but it is nevertheless often performed. Acute phototoxicity: Due to a thorough multi-stage and multi-centre validation trial (1992 - 1998) the In Vitro 3 T 3 Neutral Red Uptake Phototoxicity Test (3 T 3 -NRU-PT) had already gained acceptance by the SCCNFP in 1998, and it is recommended by the EMEA/CPMP as a basic preclinical test for acute phototoxicity. It was accepted as Method No. 41 in Annex V to Directive 67 / 548 /EEC in the year 2000, and was accepted as the new Test Guideline 432 by the OECD in 2002. The 3 T 3 -NRU-PT {{is regarded as a}} basic screen for identifying acute phototoxic potential. Two additional in vitro tests, formally evaluated in controlled blind trials, the RBC Phototoxicity Test (RBC-PT) and the Human 3 -D Skin Model Phototoxicity Test (H 3 D-PT), are regarded as useful and important adjunct tests to overcome some limitations of the 3 T 3 -NRU-PT, namely the fairly low UVB tolerance of the 3 T 3 fibroblasts and the inability to model the bioavailability of test materials topically applied to the skin. In addition, the RBC-PT permits an evaluation of the phototoxic mechanisms involved. In conclusion, the identification of acute phototoxic hazards is now regarded as being sufficiently covered by in vitro tests, so that animal testing for that endpoint can now be 100 % replaced. Photogenotoxicity: In the area of <b>photogenotoxicity,</b> almost the whole battery of in vitro genetic toxicity tests have been (or are currently being) converted into test protocols of <b>photogenotoxicity</b> tests. Tests exclusively predictive for gene mutation, for example, the Photo-Ames (P-Ames) Test and the Photo-Thymidine Kinase Test (P-TKT), have become less important than tests for clastogenic effects (for example, the Photo-Chromosome Aberration Test [P-CAT] and the Photo-Micronucleus Test [P-MNT]). In addition, a number of promising indicator tests, such as the Photo-Comet Assay (P-Comet) have been developed. Although routinely used, to date none of the new <b>photogenotoxicity</b> tests have been formally validated. Therefore, the P-MNT and the P-Comet are currently being evaluated in a formal interlaboratory validation study. It is expected that these in vitro <b>photogenotoxicity</b> test methods may become available as validated and accepted methods within the next five years. Photoallergy (Photosensitisation) : In the area of photoallergy (photosensitisation), as development of predictive in vitro tests for delayed contact sensitisation (allergenicity) potential without the involvement of light, {{due to a lack of}} ability to model the complex mechanisms underlying allergy, no promising in vitro methods to predict photo-sensitisation potential are currently in sight (see the section on skin sensitisation). One in vitro screening method, which models the covalent binding of a light activated chemical to human serum albumin, may become relevant. However, while the binding of an excited chemical to proteins is a prerequisite for photoallergy, this is not a sufficient predictor on its own. The only promising alternatives currently under development are in vivo refinements, like the Photo Local Lymph Node Assay (PLLNA). Once a reliable and predictive in vitro test battery and strategy for the assessment of "dark" sensitisation potential have been developed and accepted, their adaptation into similar photosensitisation testing will become possible...|$|E
40|$|Several light-absorbing {{chemicals}} {{are known to}} show phototoxic effects involving many kinds of DNA damage, and are suspected of initiating skin cancer. In this study, we clarified that phosphorylated histone H 2 AX (γ-H 2 AX) (phosphorylated histone H 2 AX), which was produced with the induction of DNA double-strand breaks, is a sensitive photogenotoxic marker. The immortal human keratinocyte line HaCaT was treated with a library of 11 chemicals (including known strong and weak phototoxic chemicals, and nonphototoxic chemicals) and/or UVA exposure. γ-H 2 AX was generated after treatments with all phototoxic chemicals and UVA. The limit of detection using γ-H 2 AX was 100 – 1, 000 times lower than that using cell viability and DNA gel electrophoresis. γ-H 2 AX was not generated following treatments with nonphototoxic chemicals and UVA. These results indicated that γ-H 2 AX is {{a powerful tool for}} detecting chemical <b>photogenotoxicity...</b>|$|E
40|$|Sunscreen {{formulations}} containing micronized or nano-structured {{titanium dioxide}} particles have been commercially available {{since the early}} 1990 ’s. A number of in vitro studies have presented evidence regarding the <b>photogenotoxicity</b> of titanium dioxide, {{as well as its}} function as a photocatalyst for the degradation of organic compounds, including the organic sunscreens present in lotion formulations. There has been some controversy as to whether titanium dioxide nanoparticles penetrate the outer layers of the human skin. The general consensus, though, is that no particles can reach living cells through topical application to healthy skin. The aim of this survey is to asses the implications of these in vitro studies for the scientific, technical and societal considerations in relation to the continual use of titanium dioxide as a sunscreen. In conclusion, further research of the photochemical interactions of active ingredients with the human body is needed for the assessment of potential toxic effects. We recommend that this assessment is made a legislative requirement prior to the introduction of a product to the marketplace. Alternatively we suggest the use of manganese doped titanium dioxide to prevent photocatalysis...|$|E
40|$|Many modern {{cosmetic}} or sunscreen products contain nano-sized components. Nanoemulsions are {{transparent and}} have unique tactile and texture properties; nanocapsule, nanosome, noi-some, or liposome formulations contain small vesicles (range: 50 to 5000 nm) consisting of tradi-tional cosmetic materials that protect light- or oxygen-sensitive cosmetic ingredients. Transder-mal delivery and cosmetic {{research suggests that}} vesicle materials may penetrate the stratum corneum (SC) of the human skin, but not into living skin. Depending on the physical/chemical properties of the ingredient and the formulation, nano-sized formulations may enhance or re-duce skin penetration, albeit at a limited rate. Modern sunscreens contain insoluble titanium dioxide (TiO 2) or zinc oxide (ZnO) nanoparticles (NP), which are colorless and reflect/scatter ultraviolet (UV) more efficiently than larger particles. Most available theoretical and experi-mental evidence suggests that insoluble NP do not penetrate into or through normal as well as compromised human skin. Oral and topical toxicity data suggest that TiO 2 and ZnO NP have low systemic toxicity and are well tolerated on the skin. In vitro cytotoxicity, genotoxicity, and <b>photogenotoxicity</b> studies on TiO 2 or other insoluble NP reporting uptake by cells, oxida-tive cell damage, or genotoxicity should be interpreted with caution, since such toxicities ma...|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} {{aimed to develop}} an {{effective}} screening strategy to predict in vivo phototoxicity of multiple compounds by combined use of in vitro phototoxicity assessments and cassette dosing pharmacokinetic (PK) studies. Photochemical properties of six fluoroquinolones (FQs) were evaluated by UV spectral and reactive oxygen species (ROS) assays, and phototoxic potentials of FQs were also assessed using 3 T 3 neutral red uptake phototoxicity test (3 T 3 NRU PT) and intercalator-based <b>photogenotoxicity</b> (IBP) assay. Cassette dosing pharmacokinetics on FQs was conducted for calculating PK parameters and dermal distribution. All the FQs exhibited potent UV/VIS absorption and ROS generation under light exposure, suggesting potent photosensitivity of FQs. In vitro phototoxic risks of some FQs were also elucidated by 3 T 3 NRU PT and IBP assay. Decision matrix for phototoxicity prediction was built upon these in vitro data, taken together with outcomes from cassette dosing PK studies. According to the decision matrix, most FQs were deduced to be phototoxic, although gatifloxacin {{was found to be}} less phototoxic. These findings were in agreement with clinical observations. Combined use of in vitro photobiochemical and cassette dosing PK data will be useful for predicting in vivo phototoxic potentials of drug candidates with high productivity and reliability...|$|E
40|$|For pharmaceuticals, current {{regulatory}} {{guidance for}} photosafety testing states that studies are warranted for drug candidates that both absorb {{light in the}} range of 290 - 700 nm and that are either applied topically or reach the skin or eyes by systemic exposure. In contrast to standard genotoxicity evaluations, where a positive (or equivocal) result in vitro can be placed into context with additional testing in vivo, there are no equivalent short-term in vivo <b>photogenotoxicity</b> assays in the current photosafety test battery. Therefore, a short-term in vivo assay for the evaluation of a photogenotoxic potential in the skin, the target organ for photocarcinogenicity, was developed in rats. After oral 8 -methoxypsoralen administration, rats were exposed to ultraviolet radiation and sacrificed 3 days after treatment to isolate epidermal cells for subsequent micronucleus (MN) evaluation. Optimal conditions were determined to obtain maximal induction of MN, followed by demonstrating feasibility and reproducibility of the method. The {{results of the present study}} indicate that the in vivo rat skin photomicronucleus test may be a promising tool for detection of photoclastogenicity. Given the association between MN induction and cancer, the assay may also provide a promising tool for the early detection of photocarcinogenesis and help bridge the gap in the existing photosafety testing paradigm. © The Author 2010.

40|$|Photochemical {{genotoxicity}} can {{be detected}} using appropriately adapted versions {{of most of the}} standard in vitro genotoxicity assays. The most sensitive approach to detect potentially photogenotoxic agents seems to be the investigation of DNA damage (DNA strand breakage, chromosomal aberrations, micronuclei) in mammalian cells in vitro. In a previous paper, we proposed the use of the micronucleus assay in Chinese hamster V 79 cells for this purpose. This assay was found suitable to detect various photogenotoxic compounds with different photoactivation mechanisms. In order to extend the experimental experiences with this assay, we present here further data from a screening mode testing of 16 different potential photosensitizers. The photoclastogenic and photocytotoxic potential of the compounds was investigated concomitantly. So far, all substances detected in the photo-micronucleus assay as photogenotoxins also exhibited photocytotoxic properties but not vice versa. Among the compounds tested in the present study, tiaprofenic acid, 5 -MOP, angelicin, nitrazepam, bendroflumethiazide, and dacarbazine were photogenotoxic and photocytotoxic. Further, 6 -mercaptopurine, a metabolite of azathioprine was positive for both endpoints, whereas azathioprine was found negative. Azathioprine seems to be an example of a compound which lacks photo(geno) toxic properties in vitro but may be converted to a photosensitizer by enzymatical metabolization. With the results obtained in this study, the data base for the photo-micronucleus assay was extended to 35 compounds, which were tested using the same protocol and the same irradiation conditions. The <b>photogenotoxicity</b> results of all these compounds are summarized and discussed in correlation to their different photoactivation mechanisms, photocytotoxicity and photocarcinogenicity...|$|E
40|$|An in vivo photomicronucleus test (MNT) using rat skin, {{the target}} organ for photoirritancy and carcinogenicity, was {{recently}} described. The assay was evaluated using fluoroquinolone (FQ) antibiotics {{with varying degrees}} of phototoxic potency (i. e. sparflocacin [SPFX], lomefloxacin [LOFX], ciprofloxacin [CIFX], levofloxacin [LEFX], gemifloxacin [GEFX] and gatifloxacin [GAFX]) using a solar simulator producing both UVA and UVB (ratio 23 : 1). Experiments were performed at The Netherlands Organisation for Applied Scientific Research (TNO) and GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) to investigate interlaboratory variability, including evaluation of phototoxicity (clinical signs), micronucleus induction and histopathology. The potency of micronuclei (MN) formation in rat skin induced by the FQs was SPFX = LOFX > CIFX = LEFX, however, MN induction was only statistically significant for SPFX and LOFX. In both laboratories, GEFX and GAFX did not increase the MN frequencies compared to the irradiated vehicle control. Signs of phototoxicity, including clinical and histopathological changes, were observed with SPFX and LOFX to a similar degree as the positive control, 8 -methoxypsoralen. In addition, there were some clinical signs of phototoxicity seen with CIFX, LEFX, GEFX and GAFX, but not always in both laboratories for CIFX, GEFX and GAFX and when observed, these were considered only mild. Of these, only LEFX also showed histopathological changes. In all studies, photogenotoxic potency correlated with photocarcinogenic potential and moreover, <b>photogenotoxicity</b> was not observed in the absence of phototoxicity. The results of the TNO/GSK study indicate that the in vivo rat skin photoMNT may be a promising tool for detection of photoclastogencity and photoirritancy in the skin/eye in the same animal. Given the association between the MNT and cancer, the skin photoMNT may also provide a promising tool for the early detection of photocarcinogenesis and help bridge the gap in the existing photosafety testing paradigm. © The Author 2012.
