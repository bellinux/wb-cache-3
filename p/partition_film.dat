40|$|The permselective {{properties}} of stable opal films formed by polystyrene nanospheres on boron-doped diamond (BDD) electrodes were studied {{for the first}} time by means of electrochemical voltammetric and impedance techniques. Films formed from spheres with a diameter above 200 nm are highly porous and have little influence on electrochemical properties. In contrast, porous films formed from 50 nm spheres have a selective influence on the electrochemistry observed, providing an enhancement in the redox peak current for neutral (ferrocenemethanol, dopamine) and positively-charged redox probe mediators (Ru(NH(3)) (6) (3 +)) and suppressing the current due to a negatively-charged redox species Fe(CN) (6) (4 -). This is because the latter is repelled from the film, whereas the former are selectively partitioned within it. <b>Partition</b> coefficients, <b>film</b> permeability and diffusion coefficients of species within the polystyrene opal layer are determined. It is shown that a Langmuir isotherm analysis for adsorption on the polystyrene sphere surface can describe successfully the incorporation of ferrocenemethanol and Ru(NH(3)) (6) (3 +) within the thin film, with Gibb's free energies (DeltaG(o)) of adsorption in the range of - 27 to 28 kJ mol(- 1). Apart from influencing the magnitude of the detected electrochemical response, it is also shown the opal film increases the resistance to electrode fouling by the reaction products formed by the oxidation of dopamine.

40|$|Much {{progress}} has been made in the understanding and application of specific ion effects; however, a detailed interpretation of film stability regarding the ion effect has not yet been achieved. This research aims at developing an understanding of the physico-chemical colloidal aspects in an endeavor to acquire an ability to predetermine specific ion effects on nanofilm rupture. Despite the series of reports published regarding the surfactant-free films, the experimental technique proved nearly to be unable to provide further convincing interpretation towards this issue. Molecular dynamics (MD) technique was applied to investigate the effect of salt ions on film stability in various concentrations with pair-additive and many-body polarizable water-ion potentials to validate with certainty the rupture process of aqueous nanofilms in the absence and presence of salts. Properties of the liquid film including dipole moment, molecular distribution profiles, together with a detailed quantitative analysis of film rupture, potential energy, evidences e. g. ion-water binding energy, Dipole Autocorrelation Functions (DAFs) and disjoining pressure isotherm data were examined. The DAFs of water within the film were observed to be stronger in salt films than in a pure water film. The results show that salt ions destabilize the nanofilms at low concentrations, while the ability of salt to break the films depends on the strength of the ion-water interaction and the molecular <b>partition</b> at the <b>film</b> surfaces...|$|R

Repeated deployments of the samplers for different 3 -d periods yielded detectable levels of a range of PCB congeners, which had partitioned from as little as 2 to 10 m 3 air.

The concentration dynamics in the source and receptor chambers of the diffusion cells is interpreted using the numerical code Pollute. For virgin PE <b>film,</b> <b>partition</b> coefficients ranged from 0. 68 to 278, which corresponded to 4 -chlorophenol and pentachlorophenol, respectively. Diffusion coefficients ranged from 1. 0 3 1014 to 2. 7 3 1013 m 2 /s, which corresponded to pentachlorophenol and 2, 4 -dichlorophenol, respectively. The study also looked at how the partition and diffusion coefficients were affected by the aqueous solubility, n-octanol-water partition coefficient, molecular diameter, and molecular weight. The trends observed in this study are similar to those found for diffusion of phenolic compounds through PE geomembranes. The results also revealed trends that differ from those previously reported for diffusion of volatile organic compounds (VOCs) through geomembranes. The existing empirical relationships for VOCs are not applicable except for calculating how the diffusion coefficient evolves as a function of solubility in water.

40|$|With {{the large}} amounts of video data available, it has become {{increasingly}} important {{to have the ability to}} quickly search through and browse through these videos. With that in mind, the objective of this project is to facilitate the process of searching through videos for specific content by creating a video search tool, with an immediate goal of automatically performing a hierarchical segmentation of videos, particularly full-length movies, before carrying out a search for a specific query. We approach the problem by first segmenting the video into its film units. Once the units have been extracted, various similarity measures between features, that are extracted from the film units, can be used to locate specific sections in the movie. In order to be able to properly search through a film, we must first have access to its basic units. A movie can be broken down into a hierarchy of three units: frames, shots, and scenes. The important first step in this process is to <b>partition</b> the <b>film</b> into shots. Shot detection, the process of locating the transitions between different cameras, is executed by performing a color reduction, using the 4 -Histograms method to calculate the distance between neighboring frames, applying a second order derivative to the resulting distance vector, and finally using the automatically calculated threshold to locate shot cuts. Scene detection is generally a more difficult task when compared to shot detection. After the shot boundaries of a video have been detected, the next step towards scene detection is to calculate a certain similarity measure which can then be used to cluster shots into scenes. Various keyframe extraction algorithms and similarity measures from the literature were considered and compared. Frame sampling for obtaining keyframe sets and Bhattacharya distance for similarity measure were selected for use in the shot detection algorithm. A binary shot similarity map is then created using the keyframe sets and Bhattacharya distance similarity measure. Next, a temporal distance weight and a predetermined threshold are applied to the map to obtain the final binary similarity map. The last step uses the proposed algorithm to locate the shot clusters along the diagonal which correspond to scenes. These methods and measures were successfully implemented in the Video Search Tool to hierarchically segment videos into shots and scenes...|$|R

The surface chemistry of three differing forms of diamond, namely boron-doped microcrystalline diamond, boron-doped diamond powder and detonation nanodiamond powder was modified utilising such strategies as hydrogen plasma treatment, reactive ion plasma etching along with various chemical treatments. The surface and functional properties of the modified diamond electrodes were studied using a wide spectrum of techniques. The electrochemical activity of these materials was concomitantly investigated in order to expand the knowledge of diamond electrochemistry and to establish an understanding of how the surface chemistry of these materials impacts their electrochemical performance. In the first study, the nanostructuring strategies of boron-doped diamond surface with platinum nanoparticles were developed. In particular, two types of diamond nanostructures were produced: one consisting of platinum particles located on the top of diamond nanorods, the other with platinum particles located in the bottom of diamond nanopits. For the first time, the experimental evidence proving the mechanism of the diamond nanostructuring process was reported. The electrochemical activity of these nanostructured diamond electrodes with regard to the electrochemical oxidation of glucose and methanol was investigated. In the second study, the relationship between the surface chemistry of three differing forms of diamond, including microcrystalline boron-doped diamond, boron-doped diamond powder as well as detonation nanodiamond powder, and the electrode fouling in the result of the adsorption processes in methyl viologen and anthraquinonedisulfonate solutions was investigated. The influence of two dissimilar surface terminations: hydrophobic H-terminated and hydrophilic O-terminated on the electrode performance was studied in detail. This work provides a useful insight on the likely reasons for the undesirable adsorption occurrence which may be experienced in many electroanalytical applications that utilise solid and powdered forms of diamond. The third project extends the discussion on the study of the diamond electrodes, modified with detonation nanodiamond and boron-doped diamond powders and investigates the electrochemical behaviour of these materials. In this work, charge transport within the diamond powder <b>films,</b> <b>partition</b> coefficients of different redox mediators along with heterogeneous electron transfer constants were identified. The chemical modification of these electrodes with platinum nanoparticles along with the mechanism of nucleation and growth of the latter were studied.
