The {{aim of this}} study was to analyse the nature of the photoperiodic regulation of prolactin gene expression, and to define the role of melatonin and the <b>pars</b> tuberalis <b>of</b> the anterior pituitary in this process. Pituitary prolactin gene expression, restricted to the pars distalis, was increased in hamsters maintained in long daylengths (16 h : 8 h, light : dark) compared to hamsters exposed to short daylengths (8 h : 16 h, light : dark) for 8 – 12 weeks. Analysis of single cells by in situ hybridization showed that photoperiod had no effect on the <b>percentage</b> <b>of</b> <b>pars</b> distalis cells expressing prolactin mRNA, but shifted the frequency distribution of prolactin mRNA expression per cell, such that in long photoperiods a greater proportion of cells were recruited to a higher expressing population. In vitro coculture <b>of</b> hamster <b>pars</b> tuberalis fragments increased prolactin promoter-driven luciferase activity in stably transfected GH 3 cells in a dose- and duration-dependent manner. Conditioned medium from hamster and ovine pars tuberalis also activated the prolactin promoter. Furthermore, basal and forskolin-stimulated conditioned medium from hamster pars tuberalis increased prolactin mRNA expression in primary cultures <b>of</b> <b>pars</b> distalis cells. Melatonin attenuated the activity <b>of</b> <b>pars</b> tuberalis-conditioned medium but had no direct effect on either prolactin mRNA expression or secretion in pars distalis cell cultures. Finally, pars tuberalis fragments from long photoperiod hamsters stimulated prolactin gene promoter activity to a greater extent than those from short photoperiod hamsters. In conclusion, this study provides the first evidence in a seasonal mammal that the synthesis of prolactin depends on photoperiodic modulation <b>of</b> a <b>pars</b> tuberalis-derived factor. Our data support further the hypothesis that seasonal modulation of prolactin gene expression depends upon a melatonin-dependent paracrine action <b>of</b> the <b>pars</b> tuberalis on pars distalis lactotrophic cells...|$|R

These results support previous investigations which demonstrated similar stability in complete class II malocclusions treated with 2 and 4 premolar extractions and 2 maxillary premolar extractions and non-extraction protocols [24],[29],[30]. Therefore, these studies do not confirm the idea that a posttreatment class II molar relationship has questionable long-term stability [13],[14].

40|$|Protease-activated {{receptor}}- 1 (PAR 1) is a G protein-coupled receptor {{that plays}} critical roles in cancer, angiogenesis, inflammation, and thrombosis. Proteolytic cleavage of the extracellular domain <b>of</b> <b>PAR</b> 1 generates a tethered ligand that activates PAR 1 {{in an unusual}} intramolecular mode.

The predominant thrombin receptor is PAR 1, and in endothelial cells (ECs), thrombin dynamically regulates a plethora of phosphorylation events. However, it has remained unclear whether thrombin signaling is exclusively mediated through PAR 1. Furthermore, mechanistic insight into activation and inhibition <b>of</b> <b>PAR</b> 1 -mediated EC signaling is lacking. In addition, signaling networks <b>of</b> biased <b>PAR</b> 1 activation after differential cleavage <b>of</b> the <b>PAR</b> 1 N terminus have remained an unresolved issue. Here, we used a quantitative phosphoproteomics approach to show that classical and peptide activation <b>of</b> <b>PAR</b> 1 induce highly similar signaling, that low thrombin concentrations initiate only limited phosphoregulation, and that the PAR 1 inhibitors vorapaxar and parmodulin- 2 demonstrate distinct antagonistic properties. Subsequent analysis of the thrombin-regulated phosphosites in the presence <b>of</b> <b>PAR</b> 1 inhibitors revealed that biased activation <b>of</b> <b>PAR</b> 1 is not solely linked to a specific G-protein downstream <b>of</b> <b>PAR</b> 1.

We report that receptor deubiquitination occurs between early endosomes and lysosomes and involves the endosomal deubiquitinating proteases AMSH and UBPY. Expression of the catalytically inactive mutants, AMSH(D 348 A) and UBPY(C 786 S), caused an increase in PAR 2 ubiquitination and trapped the receptor in early endosomes, thereby preventing lysosomal trafficking and degradation. Small interfering RNA knockdown of AMSH or UBPY also impaired deubiquitination, lysosomal trafficking, and degradation <b>of</b> <b>PAR</b> 2. Trapping PAR 2 in endosomes through expression of AMSH(D 348 A) or UBPY(C 786 S) did not prolong the association <b>of</b> <b>PAR</b> 2 with β-arrestin 2 or the duration <b>of</b> <b>PAR</b> 2 -induced ERK 2 activation.
