40|$|The {{relationship}} between body {{size and the}} rate of basal metabolism in mammals is the holistic basis of this thesis. In particular, the work presented investigates the relationships between body size, cell <b>membrane</b> <b>phospholipid</b> fatty acid composition, tissue metabolism and sodium pump activity. The species chosen were mouse, rat, rabbit, sheep and cattle, representing a 12 000 -fold difference in body weight. Heart, skeletal muscle and kidney cortex of larger mammals had less <b>polyunsaturated</b> <b>membrane</b> <b>phospholipids</b> than those of smaller mammals. The proportions of the various polyunsaturated fatty acids in heart, skeletal muscle and kidney cortex allowed to propose that the tissues of larger mammals generally display lower desaturase and elongase activities. A noteworthy exception is in brain, where membrane fatty acid composition remained remarkably constant in mammals of all size. The liver of larger mammals was less polyunsaturated than that of smaller mammals but rabbits showed the lowest extent of polyunsaturation of all species in this tissue. The proportions of saturated to unsaturated fatty acids in tissue phospholipids did not vary with body size. Physiological measurements with liver and kidney cortex slices confirmed that the tissues of larger mammals are metabolically less active. A significant direct {{relationship between}} the rates of oxygen consumption and of potassium uptake (an indicator of sodium pump activity) was found. This work provided evidence that body size, tissue metabolic rate, sodium pump activity and membrane polyunsaturation are related parameters...|$|R

Twenty six patients were paced until they had severe chest pain or 2 mm ST segment depression or they reached a paced rate of 180 beats/min. They were divided into two groups according to whether or not lactate was produced during pacing. Twelve patients (group 1), all with coronary artery disease, produced myocardial lactate during pacing. None of the other 14 patients (group 2), half of whom had coronary disease, produced lactate during pacing. Concentrations of malondialdehyde in the aorta and coronary sinus were significantly higher in group 1 than in group 2. Five minutes after the end of pacing coronary sinus malondialdehyde concentrations in group 1 had increased significantly from baseline values. There were no changes with time in the coronary sinus concentration of malondialdehyde in group 2 or in the aorta in either group. The negative malondialdehyde extraction ratio in group 1 suggests that intracardiac lipid peroxidation occurs during transient human myocardial ischaemia...|$|R

The analogs with alkyl chain lengths of 11 and 13 carbons have activities which not only do not differ significantly (p > 0. 05) from each other but also do not differ from that of all-rac- 3 ̆b 1 -tocopheryl acetate. This finding indicates that branching in the phytyl tail at the 42 ̆ 032, 82 ̆ 032, and 122 ̆ 032 positions has little if any influence upon vitamin E activity. Thus physical interactions involving the methyl branches of the phytyl tail and the <b>polyunsaturated</b> moieties of <b>membrane</b> <b>phospholipids</b> are unimportant in vivo, insofar as this bioassay is concernced.

Since the spectrin-actin lattice, which has been suggested {{to play an important role}} in stabilizing <b>membrane</b> <b>phospholipid</b> asymmetry, is abnormal in sickled erythrocytes, we determined the effects of sickling on <b>membrane</b> <b>phospholipid</b> organization. We used two enzymatic probes: been venom phospholipase A 2 and Staphylococcus aureus sphingomyelinase C, which do not penetrate the membrane and react only with phospholipids located in the outer leaflet of the bilayer. Our results suggest that the distribution of glycerophospholipids within the membrane of sickled cells is different from that in nonsickled cells. Compared with the normal erythrocyte, the outer membrane leaflet of the deoxygenated, reversibly sickled cells (RSC) and irreversibly sickled cells (ISC) was enriched in phosphatidyl ethanolamine in addition to containing phosphatidyl serine. These changes were compensated for by a decrease in phosphatidyl choline in that layer. The distribution of sphingomyelin over the two halves of the bilayer was unaffected by sickling. In {{contrast to}} ICS, where the organization of phospholipids was abnormal under both oxy and deoxy conditions, reoxygenation of RSC almost completely restored the organization of <b>membrane</b> <b>phospholipids</b> to normal.

40|$|The {{present study}} {{utilized}} a cultured myocardial cell model {{to evaluate the}} relationship between the release of arachidonate from <b>membrane</b> <b>phospholipids,</b> and the progression of cell injury during ATP depletion. High-energy phosphate depletion was induced by incubating cultured neonatal rat myocardial cells with various combinations of metabolic inhibitors (deoxyglucose, oligomycin, cyanide, and iodoacetate). Phospholipid degradation was assessed by the release of radiolabeled arachidonate from <b>membrane</b> <b>phospholipids.</b> In this model, the current study demonstrates that (a) cultured myocardial cells display a time-dependent progression of cell injury during ATP depletion; (b) the morphologic patterns of mild and severe cell injury in the cultured cells are similar to those found in intact ischemic canine myocardial models; (c) cultured myocardial cells release arachidonate from <b>membrane</b> <b>phospholipids</b> during ATP depletion; and (d) using two separate combinations of metabolic inhibitors, there is a correlation between the release of arachidonate, the development of severe cellular and sarcolemmal damage, the release of creatine kinase into the extracellular medium, and the loss of the ability of the myocardial cells to regenerate ATP when the metabolic inhibitors are removed. Thus, the present results suggest that during ATP depletion, in cultured neonatal rat myocardial cells, the release of arachidonate from myocardial <b>membrane</b> <b>phospholipids</b> is linked to the development of membrane defects and the associated loss of cell viability...|$|R

40|$|Greater {{arachidonic acid}} (AA) contents, which were {{correlated}} with erythrocyte transmembrane oxalate (Ox) transport, were observed in plasma and erythrocyte <b>membrane</b> <b>phospholipids</b> of patients with idiopathic calcium renal stones, suggesting a link between <b>membrane</b> <b>phospholipid</b> fatty acid composition and cellular Ox transport. To confirm this hypothesis, the effects of exogenous red blood cell incorporation of three different fatty acids (i. e., oleic acid, AA, and eicosapentaenoic acid) on Ox transport and the phosphorylation status of band 3 protein, which {{has been shown to}} mediate red blood cell Ox flux, were investigated. Preincubation of erythrocytes with AA induce: a dose-dependent increase in the phosphorylation level of band 3 protein and an increase in transmembrane Ox self-exchange. In contrast, inhibitory effects on both parameters were observed after the incorporation of oleic and eicosapentaenoic acids.

40|$|Underlying {{causes of}} species {{differences}} in maximum life span (MLS) are unknown, although differential vulnerability of <b>membrane</b> <b>phospholipids</b> to peroxidation is implicated.

We determined <b>membrane</b> <b>phospholipid</b> composition of naked mole-rats (MLS. 28. 3 years) and similar-sized mice (MLS 3 – 4 years) by gas–liquid chromatography to assess if the; 93 MLS difference could be explained. Mole-rat membrane composition was unchanged with age. Both species had similar amounts of membrane total unsaturated fatty acids; however, mice had 9 times more docosahexaenoic acid (DHA). Because this n- 3 PUFA is most susceptible to lipid peroxidation, mole-rat membranes are substantially more resistant to oxidative stress than are mice membranes. Naked mole-rat peroxidation indices, calculated from muscle and liver mitochondrial membranes, concur with those predicted by MLS rather than by body size, suggesting that <b>membrane</b> <b>phospholipid</b> composition is an important determinant of longevity.

We have investigated the origin of these archaeal enzymes using phylogenomic analyses of all enzymes of the main bacterial FA biosynthesis pathway.

40|$|The acyl {{composition}} of <b>membrane</b> <b>phospholipids</b> in kidney and brain of mammals of different body mass was examined.

The {{results of this study}} supported both hypotheses. Differences in <b>membrane</b> <b>phospholipid</b> acyl composition (i. e. decreased omega- 3 fats, increased monounsaturated fats and decreased unsaturation index with increasing body size) were not restricted to any specific phospholipid molecule or to any specific phospholipid class but were observed in all phospholipid classes.
