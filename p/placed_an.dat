The Venezuelan government of Hugo Chavez in July 2006 <b>placed</b> <b>an</b> order for 24 Su-30MK2s to replace its fleet of F-16s that were subjected to a US arms embargo. The aircraft were delivered to the Venezuelan Air Force from 2006 to 2008. The country was expected to follow up with a second order for the same type, or make a purchase of the Su-35. Despite subsequent reports that the Venezuelan government were interested in the aircraft and had <b>placed</b> <b>an</b> order for the Su-35, the country was negotiating with Russia in 2016 for the Su-30 aircraft instead.|$|E
