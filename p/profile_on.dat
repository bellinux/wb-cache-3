5|$|After {{finishing}} his schooling Kagame made two visits to Rwanda, in 1977 and 1978.

Kagame used his time in Rwanda to explore the country, familiarise himself with the political and social situation, and make connections that would prove useful to him in his later activities.|$|E

25|$|From 1959 until 2008, the Lincoln Memorial {{was shown}} on the reverse of the United States cent. Because the Lincoln Memorial was shown in {{sufficient}} detail to discern the statue of Lincoln on the reverse of cent, Abraham Lincoln {{was at that time}} the only person to be depicted on both the obverse and reverse of the same United States coin. In 1999, the New Jersey state quarter was released, which depicts George Washington on both sides, crossing the Delaware River on the reverse side and in <b>profile</b> <b>on</b> the obverse. (The state quarter for South Dakota, released in 2006, also features Washington on both sides: the typical <b>profile</b> <b>on</b> the obverse, and Washington within Mount Rushmore on the reverse.) Some of the 2009 reverse design series no longer showed Abraham Lincoln, and the 2010 Lincoln Union Shield has removed the president from the coin reverse for the foreseeable future.|$|E
