Spectra were collected by a transmittance probe for UV-VIS and UV-NIR wavelengths. The samples temperature was recorded (18. 0 ± 2. 0 oC) and the probe was always checked for bubble formation or fat residues on lens/mirror system. The integration time was set to 25 s and 4 s for the collection of UV-VIS and VIS-NIR spectra respectively. Data analysis was performed on each product and for each spectral range independently. The spectra were normalized by its maximum intensity and the corrected for using a robust multiplicative scatter correction algorithm.

For this analyse the biogas plants were sampled at 11 occasions. Survival of pathogenic spore forming bacteria in digestion residue may be a health risk for both humans and animals.

40|$|Onion (Allium cepa L.) waste {{disposal}} represents a worldwide environmental problem. A {{solution to this}} issue could be the use of onion waste as food-grade ingredients, which could be added to processed foods for their enrichment in bioactive compounds. For this purpose, onion waste should be adequately processed and stabilised. Thus, {{the objective of this}} work was to study the composition of processed onion waste, assessing the effects of processing and thermal stabilisation on onion waste bioactive compounds. Onion waste was triturated ('Paste') and triturated + pressed ('Bagasse', solid residue and 'Juice', liquid fraction). All by-products were stabilised by <b>pasteurisation</b> <b>and</b> sterilisation. Results indicated that bagasse was an enriched dietary fibre product (361 - 453 mg/g dry weight (DW)); paste showed high alkyl or alkenyl cystein sulphoxide (ACSO) content (5. 6 mg/g DW); and juice showed large fructans concentration (205 - 221 mg/g DW). In paste <b>and</b> bagasse, <b>pasteurisation</b> <b>and</b> sterilisation improved soluble/insoluble fibre ratio, with no changes in total dietary fibre concentration in pasteurised products and a slight decrease (8 % on average) in the sterilised ones. In juice, thermal treatments produced fructans losses, more pronounced after sterilisation (59 % on average) than after pasteurisation (36 % on average). However, sterilisation provided by-products with better ACSO results than pasteurisation. As a conclusion, industrial processing has an important impact on the bioactive composition, generating products with different functional applications. Moreover, pasteurisation resulted to be the most suitable treatment to obtain safe products enriched in dietary fibre and fructans, while sterilisation could be used to produce products rich in ACSOs. © 2012 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.

40|$|Resumen del póster presentado a la XVI Conference EuroFoodChem: "Translating food {{chemistry}} into health benefits" celebrada en Gdansk (Polonia) del 6 al 8 de julio de 2011. Colon {{cancer is the}} second {{cause of death in}} Europe. Therefore, its prevention is crucial and functional foods may play a pivotal role on that. The most widely studied bioactive substances in soy are Bowman-Birk protease inhibitors (BBI protein) and the isoflavones. BBI is a serine protease inhibitor with a well-characterised ability to inhibit trypsin and chymotrypsin. Its chemoprotective effects have been well documented. Although the precise mechanisms by which BBI suppress carcinogenesis are unknown a strong correlation between its ability to inhibit carcinogenesis and its chymotrypsin inhibitor activity has been suggested. BBI’s potential to be used as chemo-preventive functional food ingredients has been proposed; however, there are not data related to resistance of BBI proteins to thermal treatment of low pH foods such as fruit juices. Research is needed to evaluate pure BBI as functional ingredient in complex food matrices. The objective of this research is to obtain new health enhancing phytochemicals (BBI) foods. Orange juice was freshly prepared and divided into aliquots. Citrate buffer 50 M pH 3. 7 was employed as simplified orange juice model system. Both samples were supplemented with therapeutic dose of pure BBI (1. 75 μM final concentration) and thermally treated under <b>pasteurisation</b> <b>and</b> sterilisation conditions. The concentration and chymotrypsin inhibitory activity of BBI in fresh, supplemented and heated samples were analysed. Data suggest that BBI remains active in the food matrix after both <b>pasteurisation</b> <b>and</b> sterilisation indicating the feasibility of its use as potential natural functional food ingredient.

Research was conducted between November 2014 and May 2015 in Cape Town, South Africa, including interviews with eleven donating women and eight weeks of participant observation at a level two maternity hospital. Donors use a rhetoric of 'saving babies', the effect of which is to deny the social tie between donor and recipient, or the potential for consubstantiation.

Care enters into the constellation of relations that the milk ensures in unexpected ways and figures into the ways the milk is distributed in the hospital. Thus, donated breast milk shifts back and forth between being a bodily fluid, food, and medicine as its trajectory takes it through different constellations of saving, motherhood, technologies, care, safety, risk and medical authority.
