50|$|Early in the {{so-called}} Bende-Onitsha hinterland expedition, a British doctor was captured by several Igbo men and then killed and eaten according to Geary (1927). Trenchard's expedition took on a <b>punitive</b> <b>character</b> as he pursued the murderers, eventually fighting a pitched battle with the men and defeating them {{with the use of}} his Maxim guns. The chiefs were brought to terms and the doctor's skull and bones recovered. Thousands of Igbo men were pressed into service as labourers, constructing roads through the jungle. His service during the Bende-Onitsha expedition saw Trenchard awarded the Distinguished Service Order in 1906.|$|E
50|$|Despite denials, the {{new foreign}} minister, Victor Antonescu {{proceeded}} {{to a massive}} change in {{the staff of the}} Romanian foreign missions, recalling many of the plenipotentiary ministers. These changes, if not initiated, were at least approved by prime minister Gheorghe Tătărescu. Most of the heads of mission recalled were suspected of supporting the former minister of foreign affairs. The list of recalled ministers included: Nicolae Lahovary (Albania), Caius Brediceanu (Austria), Dimitrie I. Ghika (Belgium), Vasile Stoica (Bulgaria), Theodor Emandi (Czechoslovakia), Raoul Bossy (Finland), Constantin Langa-Răşcanu (Greece), Vasile Grigorcea (Hungary), Grigore Constantinescu (Iran), Ion Aurel Vassiliu (Japan), Constantin Antoniade (League of Nations), Dimitrie Drăghicescu (Mexico), Constantin Vişoianu (Poland), Mihail Boerescu (Switzerland), Eugen Filotti (Turkey) and Alexandru Gurănescu (Yugoslavia). In order to emphasize the <b>punitive</b> <b>character</b> of the measure, their diplomatic passports were withdrawn and all their diplomatic privileges withdrawn the moment the orders for their return to Romania were issued. The reshuffling of the staff coincided with the return to political or diplomatic activities of known opponents of Titulescu, such as Anton Bibescu and Victor Cădere. The magnitude of these changes indicated the intention of the new minister to replace most of the senior staff of the ministry. However, the implementation to the desired extent proved impossible to implement and part of the recalled ministers were appointed to other legations or received other positions at the headquarters of the Ministry.|$|E
40|$|Three {{experiments}} explored {{determinants of}} <b>punitive</b> <b>character</b> attributions to norm violators. Experiment 1 showed that ideological conservatism and manipulated threat to society increased anger and attributional punitiveness {{when there was}} ambiguity about culpabil-ity. Experiment 2 showed that informing observers that norm violations were widespread and rarely punished increased attributional punitiveness by activating anger-charged retributive goals. Experiment 3 showed that liberals and conservatives alike felt justiWed in assigning greater blame to high-status perpetrators who commit acts of negligence with more severe consequences but that only conserva-tives felt justiWed in doing so for low-status perpetrators. Overall, the results reinforce the hypothesis that societal threat activates a pros-ecutorial mindset identiWable by a correlated cluster of attributions, emotions, punishment goals and punitiveness...|$|E
2500|$|Authority for {{the second}} {{proposition}} came from Chu Kheng Lim v Minister for Immigration, where Brennan CJ, Deane and Dawson JJ said [...] "The involuntary detention of a citizen in custody by the State is penal or <b>punitive</b> in <b>character</b> and, under our system of government, exists only as an incident of the exclusively judicial function of adjudging and punishing criminal guilt.|$|R
5000|$|In 1855 an {{alliance}} of Tongass Tlingit (Stikines) and Haida raided Puget Sound on a slaving expedition. They were confronted at Port Gamble, Washington Territory by the [...] and other naval vessels and suffered casualties, including a prominent Haida chief. A return expedition by the alliance the following year was <b>punitive</b> in <b>character,</b> with Isaac N. Ebey chosen at random as a high-ranking white man whose death would avenge {{the death of one}} of the raiding chiefs the year before. The territorial government pressed the colonial government of Vancouver Island to apprehend the killer, but the British had insufficient military capacity to take on the allied Haida and Tlingit and the killer was never identified or caught.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of a survey which aimed at exploring the perceptions of the employees of a large aviation organization regarding the <b>punitive</b> or preventive <b>character</b> of possible measures that management could take in cases of errors and violations. The analysis of the quantitative and qualitative data collected showed that the viewpoints of the staff were sufficiently aligned only for half of the measures and that all measures inflicting a short- or long-term dissociation of the end-users from their current working place and function were highly unfavourable and linked to castigation. Also, statistically significant differences were observed across groups of specialties and years of service regarding the appropriateness of specific measures {{especially in the case of}} errors. The findings of this study in combination with literature references, suggest that the establishment of a just culture structure with agreed lines between the <b>punitive</b> and preventive <b>character</b> of measures and its endorsement by the employees is achievable, but it requires a bottom-up approach and periodical revision. Similar exploratory research, complemented possibly by explanatory studies, is recommended to be carried out by organizations prior or during the development of their just culture policy and related measures...|$|R
40|$|This article {{demonstrates}} {{the existence of}} civil responsibility with punitive purposes in Brazilian Law, explaining how it was introduced by jurisdictional activity in cases involving moral damages. Next, it points out main problems this situation represents to Brazilian Law {{from the standpoint of}} our juridical dogmatics and public policies. Additionally, it proposes the execution of an empirical research for comprehension of the structure and fundamentals of jurisprudence on the <b>punitive</b> <b>character</b> of civil responsibility for moral damages and establishes criteria for use in this research based on theories of punishment. Finally, it positions the problem of punitive function of civil responsibility in the broader ambit of relationships and boundaries between civil and criminal responsibility...|$|E
40|$|International law is {{increasingly}} focusing on criminal avenues {{to deal with}} past human rights abuses. In this frame, the role of victims is often marginalized, if not totally ignored, and they are sometimes further victimized. It is put forward that the problem lies largely in the <b>punitive</b> <b>character</b> of criminal law and its focus on prosecution. The paper explores the shortcomings of this approach and suggests possible solutions. Two promising alternatives are worth investigating. First, states’ liability can now be invoked for international offences, through other avenues than penal justice. Secondly, more individuated compensatory and restorative mechanisms, grounded in tort law, contract and restitution, sidestep the tensions underlined. Reliance on both states’ liability and traditional private law remedies presents the significant advantage of perfectly fitting in the human rights paradigm and repositioning the victims at {{the centre of the}} proceedings...|$|E
40|$|This article aims to problematize how the subjectivation {{modes of}} young {{subjects}} have been constituted, regarding the articulation between psychological practices and health, social assistance and justice policies. It is understood {{that despite the}} discourse of protection that is promoted {{in the core of}} these politics, inversely, it is also produced a succession of practices that perpetrates a normalized and <b>punitive</b> <b>character</b> towards the life of young subjects who had their rights violated. The conducting line for this analysis emanates from the knowledge-power practices presented in the case of Highlander, a teenager in conflict with law that was target with fifteen gunshots and has been attended by diverse sectors in social-educational measurement arena. To question the insertion of youth population in the government mechanisms and the practices that act over them may be a way to provoke displacements towards the place that psychology occupies in the public politics scenario...|$|E
500|$|Several {{commentators}} have expressed {{the view that}} the decision has produced confusion and uncertainty with respect to constitutional restrictions on executive power in this area. [...] Matthew Zagor notes that while the three minority Justices in this case, and Justice Callinan in another case, have expressed their support for the existing test in Chu Kheng Lim (that non-punitive detention is constitutionally permissible where it is [...] "reasonably capable of being seen as necessary"), the test was not in fact used by the majority in this case to conclude that the detention here was permissible. [...] He also points out that in later cases, only Justice Kirby seemed to uphold the 'vibe' of the Chu Kheng Lim test, with Chief Justice Gleeson and Justice Gummow attempting to separate the character of detention from its consequences (suggesting that detention which is punitive in effect may not necessarily also be <b>punitive</b> in <b>character).</b> [...] Finally, Zagor argues that of the Justices who questioned the Chu Kheng Lim test, none were able to provide a coherent alternative to substitute for it.|$|R
40|$|The {{evolution}} of Primary Health Care in Brazil marks a trajectory of possible {{advances in the}} health system, about which we can indicate a few prominent points. Hence, our objective is to describe its evolution between 1980 and 2006, highlighting a few relevant aspects of such trajectory. This is a documental, descriptive-reflexive and qualitative study. By having read documents such as ministerial decrees related to Primary Health Care, Technical Norms, reports from DATASUS, reports from the program Saúde da Família, evaluation reports related to the reaching of established goals regarding indicators of Primary Health Care (SISPACTO),Terms of Municipal Qualification, state management reports and the State Health Plan and the PROESF Agreement, enabled {{us to have a}} more contextualized view of the different approaches observed in such documents {{as well as of the}} advances obtained. It was noticed that health evaluation processes are still incipient, little embedded to the practices of health services, and present a prescriptive, bureaucratic and <b>punitive</b> <b>character</b> that do not support planning and management. ...|$|E
40|$|In the Netherlands {{the recent}} debate on lay {{involvement}} {{in the administration of}} criminal justice was initiated by politicians who maintain that the public favours such involvement. The response of the judiciary and legal academics to these politicians has been fairly defensive. They have pointed in particular to the dangers of the <b>punitive</b> <b>character</b> of the vox populi and rejected the idea. As a result, the debate on lay involvement has quickly become a black and white issue. This article presents the findings of a recent research of the Netherlands Council for the Judiciary and the Research and Documentation Centre of the Dutch Ministry of Justice regarding the opinion of the public on different kinds of lay involvement under different conditions. This research shows that both the position of the politicians that favour lay {{involvement in the}} administration of criminal justice and the position of the judiciary and legal academics that reject lay involvement are to a relatively large degree unrepresentative of the wishes and views of the public...|$|E
40|$|Medical error {{stems from}} {{inadequate}} professional conduct that {{is capable of}} producing harm to life or exacerbating the health of another, whether through act or omission. This situation has become increasingly common in Brazil and worldwide. In this study, the aim was to understand what being the victim of medical error is like and to investigate the circumstances imposed on this condition of victims in Brazil. A semi-structured interview was conducted with twelve people who had gone through situations of medical error in their lives, creating a space for narratives of their experiences and deep reflection on the phenomenon. The concept of medical error has a negative connotation, often being associated with the incompetence of a medical professional. Medical error in Brazil is demonstrated by low-quality professional performance and represents the current reality of the country because of the common lack of respect and consideration for patients. Victims often remark on their loss of identity, as their social functions have been interrupted and they do not expect to regain such. It was found, however, little assumption of error in the involved doctors’ discourses and attitudes, which felt a need to judge the medical conduct in an attempt to assert their rights. Medical error in Brazil presents a <b>punitive</b> <b>character</b> and is little discussed in medical and scientific circles. The stigma of medical error is closely connected to the value and cultural judgments of the country, making it difficult to accept, both by victims and professionals...|$|E
40|$|In its infancy, {{restorative}} justice emerged {{not only as}} an 'alternative' to prison {{but also as a}} competing justice model that sought to reduce our reliance on the existing retributive 'criminal justice' system. It is said that {{restorative justice}} initiatives distinguish themselves from the prevailing punitive approach to 'crime' as they are guided by a different set of questions, objectives, values and principles that provide opportunities for restorative outcomes. In theory, these community-based 'alternative' programs were to divert cases away from the retributive 'criminal justice' system' so that reparations between 'offenders', victims and affected community members could be made possible. In my study, I have identified 277 initiatives that claim to {{be in the business of}} restorative justice, many of which are either funded, administrated or receive their case loads from institutions within the existing 'criminal justice' system. In these cases, we must ask ourselves whether the restorative justice initiatives operating within the parameters of the 'criminal justice' system adhere to the objectives, values and principles outlined in the philosophy of restorative justice. To begin to address this very question, which is the central objective of this study, I examine one particular pilot project administrated by Correction Service Canada (CSC) from April 2001 to November 2005 called the Restorative Justice Unit (RJ Unit). This program, which was housed in Grande Cache Institution (GCI), was created by CSC to determine whether or not it would be feasible to transform the prison into a restorative correctional environment. In my analysis of this program, I unpack this notion and demonstrate that CSC has merely adopted the descriptors of the restorative approach to legitimate punishment and control under the guise of restorative justice and the rehabilitative rhetoric of the cognitive behavioural approach. In a story that reads more of the same, I conclude that the RJ Unit failed to adhere to the objectives, values and principles of the restorative approach due to the clear absence of political, relational and operational changes at the structural level of the organization and of the prison in which the program participants were housed. As such, I argue that CSC has and continues to be involved (with its other 'restorative justice' initiatives) in a process of absorption, whereby only the descriptors and practices of the restorative justice model that do not threaten the interests of the organization are incorporated into its existing framework. I contend that such a process allows CSC to maintain the dominant <b>punitive</b> <b>character</b> of its prisons by employing the language of restorative justice to deflect criticism from those who argue that the 'criminal justice' process, especially imprisonment, does not address the needs of 'offenders', victims and affected members of the community and also further contributes to the pain and marginalization experienced by these parties...|$|E
