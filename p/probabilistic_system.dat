In this thesis, {{a new form of}} representation, J˜-plane, is proposed for concave and unnormalized type- 2 fuzzy events as well as convex and normalized ones, which facilitates bridging the gaps between higher order fuzzy probability realizations and real world problems. Since J˜-plane representation, the investigation of type- 2 fuzzy probability theory and the proposal of a type- 2 fuzzy <b>probabilistic</b> <b>system</b> become possible. Based on J˜-plane representation, a new fuzzy systemmodel - a type- 2 fuzzy <b>probabilistic</b> <b>system</b> is proposed incorporating probabilistic inference with type- 2 fuzzy sets. A special case study, a type- 2 fuzzy SARIMA system is proposed and experimented in forecasting singleton and uncertain non-singleton bench mark data - Mackey-Glass time series. The results show that the type- 2 fuzzy SARIMA system has achieved significant improvements beyond its predecessors - the classical statistical model - SARIMA, type- 1 and general type- 2 fuzzy logic systems, no matter whether in the singleton or the non-singleton experiments, whereas a SARIMA model cannot forecast non-singleton data at all. The type- 2 fuzzy SARIMA system is applied in a real world scenario - WSS CAPS proactive monitoring, and compared with the results of the statistical model SARIMA, type- 1 and general type- 2 fuzzy logic systems to show that, the type- 2 fuzzy SARIMA system can monitor practical uncertain data-intensive seasonal time series proactively and accurately, whereas its predecessors - the statistical model SARIMA, type- 1 and general type- 2 fuzzy logic systems - cannot deal with this at all.

The formal verification of a stochastic hybrid system often comprises a method for the generation of a finite-state <b>probabilistic</b> <b>system</b> which either represents exactly the behaviour of the stochastic hybrid system, or which approximates conservatively its behaviour. We extend such abstraction-based formal verification of stochastic hybrid systems in two ways. Firstly, we generalise previous results by showing how bisimulation-based abstractions of non-probabilistic hybrid automata can be lifted to the setting of probabilistic hybrid automata, a subclass of stochastic hybrid systems in which probabilistic choices {{can be made with}} respect to finite, discrete alternatives only. Secondly, we consider the problem of obtaining approximate ab-stractions for discrete-time stochastic systems in which there are continuous probabilistic choices with regard to the slopes of certain system variables. We restrict our attention to the subclass of such systems in which the approximate abstraction of such a system, obtained using the previously developed techniques of Fränzle et al., results in a probabilistic rectangular hybrid automaton, from which in turn a finite-state <b>probabilistic</b> <b>system</b> can be obtained.
