40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to introduce application of the Richards equation on modelling and prediction of stand diameter distribution. The long-term repeated measurement data sets, consisted of 309 diameter frequency distributions from Chinese fir (Cunninghamia lanceolata) plantations in the southern China, were used. Also, 150 stands were used as fitting data, the other 159 stands were used for testing. Nonlinear regression method (NRM) or maximum likelihood estimates method (MLEM) were applied to estimate the parameters of models, and the parameter prediction method (PPM) and parameter recovery method (PRM) were used to predict the diameter distributions of unknown stands. Four main conclusions were obtained: (1) R distribution presented a more accurate simulation than three-parametric Weibull function; (2) the parameters p, q and r of R distribution proved to be its scale, location and shape parameters, and have a deep relationship with stand characteristics, which means the parameters of R distribution have good theoretical interpretation; (3) the ordinate of inflection point of R distribution has significant relativity with its skewness and kurtosis, and the fitted main distribution range for the cumulative diameter distribution of Chinese fir plantations was 0. 4 ∼ 0. 6; (4) the goodness-of-fit test showed diameter distributions of unknown stands can be well estimated by applying R distribution based on PRM or the combination of PPM and PRM under the condition that only quadratic mean DBH or <b>plus</b> <b>stand</b> age are known, and the non-rejection rates were near 80 %, which are higher than the 72. 33 % non-rejection rate of three-parametric Weibull function based on the combination of PPM and PRM...|$|E

In addition, confluent monolayers of RNase L-deficient murine cells readily established persistent infections and were not killed.

40|$|Iron {{and steel}} {{consumption}} {{is a vital}} indicator {{for the development of}} any industrialized country. The major steel consuming sectors are construction, automotive and machineries. The recent years have brought an increasing trend of steel consumption in the ASEAN countries due to the positive economic growth. So these countries are now expanding their steel producing capacities in order to achieve self-reliance in this sector. The construction of the first ever Blast Furnace-based steel plant in Malaysia is a landmark project for attaining sufficiency in meeting national steel demand. Generally, an iron and steel making plant has all the developed facilities starting from the handling of raw materials to the final finished products. Once in operation, these plants require periodic major overhauls and up-grading besides routine repairs and maintenance activities to ensure their smooth operations. This study discusses an integrated approach named ‘Production+’ which was envisioned for the revamping and expansion of a public sector iron and steel making plant in Pakistan. The plant was commissioned in 1984 – 85 and after 20 years of its successful operation in 2004, the then management decided to revamp and expand its production capacity of steel up to 3. 0 million metric ton (mmt) per year. For achieving this objective, it was planned that numerous strategic decisions would be taken {{during the course of the}} revamping and expansion program. This mainly included the improvement of existing maintenance practices to a more advanced plant maintenance level, energy conservation program that cut down energy and utility costs, and process optimization to detect and remove bottlenecks and inefficiencies in the production process.

40|$|International audienceKey message The {{long-term}} {{effect of}} forest {{fires in the}} regeneration ofPinus canariensiswas studied. Forest fires had little long-term effects on seed production, seedling germination and seedling mortality. The characteristics of different forest stands across the island had influence {{in some of the}} regeneration parameters studied. ContextDespite the importance of forest regeneration dynamics after wildfires, little is known about its long-term evolution after a fire. AimsWe tested the effect of fire on the long-term regeneration dynamics of P. canariensis. MethodIn a forest fire chronosequence of five fire ages (time elapsed since the last fire) <b>plus</b> an unburned <b>stand,</b> we monitored seed production, seedling germination and mortality during 2  years. ResultsWe detected significant differences among forest stands in seed production, seedling density and mortality but not in germination and turnover. These differences were unrelated to fire age. Seed production was conditioned by the number of large adults and elevation, germination by diameter at breast height (DBH) and soil nitrogen content and mortality by DBH. ConclusionWe detected no long-term effect of fire on the regeneration of P. canariensis in natural pine forest; however, during the first years after fire, modification of nitrogen availability in soil can reduce germination. Stand conditions in natural pine forests appear to mainly control regeneration dynamics. The regeneration strategies and fire-resistance traits of this species have ensured its persistence in the long term...|$|R
30|$|Our {{hypothesis}} that 5 yr fall reburning would limit conifer regeneration more than spring or 15 yr reburning was correct, {{but it was}} not correct that it would also reduce forest floor depth, or woody fuels. Interestingly, our spring 5 yr treatment ended up with the lowest woody fuels load across all four fuel sizes, and the fall 5 yr treatment tended to have higher fuel load (except for 100 hr fuels), although these differences were not always significant. This result is somewhat surprising given that others report initial entry fall burns consuming more fuel than spring burns (Knapp et al. 2005, Fettig et al. 2010), and the general assumption that shorter between-fire intervals prevent fuel buildup (Vaillant et al. 2015). The few differences we document for woody fuels in 2014 may be partly due to the highly variable nature of woody fuels within the <b>stands,</b> <b>plus</b> the difficulty and expense in adequately replicating a long-term field study such as this. But the differences we did document for all but 1000 hr fuels following reburn one had all disappeared following reburn three. It appears that, for the control treatments, fuel loads are being reduced through decay, which is similar to results from other studies with thinning-only treatments (Young-blood et al. 2008, Vaillant et al. 2015), while fuel loads are stable (recruitment is equal to consumption) in the burn treatments, which resulted in the lack of treatment differences {{by the end of the}} study period.|$|R
40|$|Graduation date: 1979 A three stage {{sale was}} taken of two high-site, second growth Doug 1 as-fir (Pseudtsuga menziesii) stands {{located in the}} extreme northwestern portion of the Oregon Coast Range. Permanent plots were {{established}} during the first stage variable-plot cruise. A Hartley- List sample, taken from the first stage Douglas-fir in trees, selected second stage sample trees in proportion to their estimated total height. A subsequent equal probability systematic sample was taken to choose the third stage sample trees. First stage variable-plot cruise data provided a conventional estimate of stand volume per acre and the basis for expansion of estimates from subsequent sample stages. Second stage sample trees were measured for form and volume with a Barr and Stroud Type FP 15 dendometer. These measurements were converted to tree volume estimates and expanded to volume per acre estimates for the stand. Third stage sample trees were felled. Cross-sectional disks were cut at measured intervals along the bole. Radial increment measurements from these disks {{provided the basis for}} estimating growth of individual trees and stand parameters. Findings indicate that the average tarif number, for use with the DNR (Department of Natural Resources, State of Washington) tarif volume tables, computed from stem analysis. data for the present Douglas-fir component of these stands is significantly different from that estimated by conventional methods using tree height and diameter. This suggests that the growth habit and stem form of Douglas-fir may be altered as a result of commercial thinning. It also implies that volume tables constructed for natural stands may underestimate volume in thinned stands Evaluation of King's site index revealed a decreasing trend in apparent site index of about one site class from 15 to 30 years breast height age. This downward trend appears to subside about the tire of the initial thinning operations and remain relatively constant thereafter. Examination of stem analysis data from an unthinned stand about 25 miles east of the project area revealed a similar trend in site index. Present volume per acre for an unthinned stand was predicted using past stand parameters and the DNR yield tables for the Douglas-fir zone. Results indicate that volume in the surviving <b>stand</b> <b>plus</b> that removed by commercial thinnings exceeds the predicted stand yield. This amounted to about 5 percent in one stand and about 16 percent in the higher density, more heavily thinned stand. This comparison implies that total yield in Douglas-fir stands 50 to 55 years of age may be slightly increased by repeated commercial thinnings...|$|R
