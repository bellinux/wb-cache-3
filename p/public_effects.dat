He is in constant demand on the different media as a welcome partner for interviews and debates and regularly comments on topical media-political developments. His book on modern systems theory and the philosophy of constructivism (together with the Austrian-American cybernetics Heinz von Foerster and the Chilean neurobiologist Humberto Maturana) are available in German, English, Italian, Danish, Korean and Spanish. His 1998 publication together with Heinz von Foerster, [...] "Truth is the invention of a liar", is meanwhile considered a classic of systemic thought. Pörksen has written several books, together with his students, dealing with current media topics ("Trendbuch Journalismus", [...] "Skandal! - Die Macht öffentlicher Empörung" [...] The power of public outrage, [...] "Medienmenschen - Wie man Wirklichkeit inszeniert" [...] personalities - How to stage realities, [...] "Die Casting-Gesellschaft" [...] casting society, and [...] "Die gehetzte Politik" [...] politics. In the book written with the colleague Hanne Detel, [...] "The unleashed scandal. The end of control in the digital age" [...] he shows that the evolution and escalation of the scandal has entered a new phase in the digital age. The claim is that each and everyone can nowadays trigger a scandal, and that each and everyone can become its target and victim.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this article is}} to examine how taxes affect consumption of commodities that are detrimental to health and the environment: tobacco, alcoholic beverages, household energy and petroleum fuel (petrol) for transportation. Specifically, we examine if a tax increase leads to a significantly larger change in consumption than a producer price change, which is referred to as the signalling effect from taxation. This objective is achieved through an empirical analysis using the Linear Almost Ideal Demand System. The analysis uses aggregated cross-sectional time series data and information on major legislation introductions in Sweden, Denmark and the United Kingdom from 1970 to 2009. We find the main result to be that the signalling effect is significant for “Electricity” in Sweden and Denmark and significant for “Electricity” and “Petrol” in the United Kingdom. This implies that tax policy is more effective in tackling consumption of commodities which produce negative <b>public</b> <b>effects</b> (negative externalities affecting the social good such as pollution) than those for negative private effects (negative internalities affecting the private good such as health).

40|$|This short paper {{introduces}} the modeling of critical infrastructures (C. I.) by idealizing a basic architecture consisting of just two nodes and two edges {{with the intent}} to illustrate some of the basic features and understand what happens {{in the event of a}} disruption and how this might propagate with consequent cascading effects. The paper starts by first introducing the concept of sectoral infrastructures making reference to the recent EU directive 2008 - 114 -EC which is the basis for the identification of European critical infrastructures. This directive includes the coverage of critical infrastructure from an ex-ante viewpoint and requires that EU member states assess the casualties, and economic and <b>public</b> <b>effects</b> of critical infrastructure disruption involving cascading and trans-border scenarios. In the second part two arbitrary but dependent infrastructures are then considered (power station and water works) which form the basis of a kernel network that is then subsequently analyzed under 4 different cases of disruption (without recovery). Three other modeling techniques are then briefly discussed, namely, Petri nets, the Inputoutput model and agent based modeling. The paper closes with possible developments of the network and what tools may be exploited to model more complex situations and successfully tackle the resulting challenges. JRC. DG.

40|$|Abstract World {{markets are}} highly interconnected, and the actions and {{statements}} of the central bank in one country may influence other countries as well. In this thesis I show that monetary policy shocks of the European Central Bank have substantial effects on Norwegian asset prices and yield curve. Using high-frequency data from 2001 to 2015 I investigate intraday changes in Eu- ropean interest rates to identify shocks to the ECB’s monetary policy. Following the methods of Gürkaynak, Sack, and Swanson (2005) I use principal component analysis to identify two factors of monetary policy shocks interpreted as a "rate setting surprise" factor and a "forward guidance surprise" factor. The forward guidance component {{comes from the fact}} that the ECB reveals information about future monetary policy to affect the medium and longer end of the yield curve. The analysis shows that monetary policy shocks by the ECB have strong and significant immediate effects on Norwegian financial variables. In brief, the rate setting surprise has strongest effects for the money market interest rates with short maturities, while forward guidance influences the yield curve with a characteristic hump shape. For very narrow time windows after the rate decision becomes <b>public,</b> <b>effects</b> of a rate setting surprise on the EURNOK exchange rate are strong and significant, but then dies out quickly. Norwegian equity prices respond negatively to a tightening rate surprise, but positively to forward guidance shocks...|$|E

40|$|For {{more than}} two decades there has been a growing niche for {{ethically}} sourced coffees, {{at the same time as}} a revitalisation and development of sourcing models focused on indicators of coffee quality and measures of taste. Small independent and multinational buyers and roasters have become progressively interested in sourcing coffee in a way that privileges sustainable and/or high quality indicators, and are increasingly engaged in debates about solidarity versus mainstreaming, quantity versus quality, and provider of caffeine versus taste. Research on one coffee producing country, Guatemala, suggests how these debates have affected the historical evolution of the coffee market. This ethnographic study traces the qualifications of Guatemalan coffee and argues that responses to both the enactment of the technologies, as well as the perceived limitations of sourcing models have produced new articulations of ethics and taste. Producers and small entrepreneurs located in Guatemala reconfigure the practices of cultivation, processing, and selling/buying in relation to circulating market indicators. They create locally situated attachments to the coffee through skill transfer and knowledge exchange and in this way they imitate and also transform international valuations of taste, ethics and quality. This thesis works to make visible the range and diversity of processes and agencies involved in the production of markets for ethical coffee and considers coffee as vital and mobile; an active producer of <b>public</b> <b>effects</b> rather than a passive object moved through a commodity network. This view enables a more open, relational and mobile account of both coffee and of ethics, one which is capable of making clear the important and emerging role of taste. This thesis extends the qualifications of coffee to the daily enactments of cultivation and the skills and techniques that work to reveal taste. On this view, taste mediates the agency of the materials in both high quality and sustainable coffees and this expands and extends ethics to interpersonal, material and bodily relations that link producers and consumers in multiple ways.

40|$|Demography is a {{realm of}} private {{decisions}} with <b>public</b> <b>effects.</b> In both highand low-fertility regimes, families make decisions that significantly influence the well-being of others. Excessively rapid population growth can threaten economic and ecological viability. Population decline can threaten cultural continuity and fiscal sustainability. As Paul Demeny has warned us, there is no invisible hand in the family that serves to align private and public interests (Demeny 1986). Yet as he has also pointed out, the visible hands of the state do not necessarily provide a remedy. By socializing the benefits of childrearing more than the costs, the modern welfare state has encouraged fertility decline below replacement levels, lowering the prospects for future intergenerational transfers and perhaps undermining the welfare state itself (Demeny 1987). When Demeny {{expressed concern about the}} effects of unwittingly antinatalist policies in the mid- 1980 s, most other demographers remained focused on the opposite problem of rapid population growth. Gradually, however, issues of below-replacement fertility began to garner more attention. Demeny’s proposal that we should “privatize ” {{at least some of the}} economic benefits of childrearing has been taken up by a number of economists and policy experts, including Romesh Ponnuru (2012), Shirley Burggraf (1997), and Phillip Longman (2004). The serious economic slowdown that began in the United States and Europe in 2007 has fueled concerns about ballooning public debt, along with implementation of some strict austerity programs. These current events increase the likelihood that social spending on age-based transfers may be reduced. In this context it seems appropriate to consider both what we know and what we need to know about intergenerational transfers and the welfare state, with a view toward improving equity, efficiency, and sustainability. In this essay, we focus on the US experience, considering three questions that we deem crucial: 1) Why did a welfare state that includes significant intergenerational transfers emerge? 2) How do public and private intergenerationa...|$|E
40|$|A patent 2 ̆ 2 pool 2 ̆ 2 is an {{arrangement}} under which patent holders {{in a common}} technology commit their patents to a single holder, who then licenses {{them out to the}} original patentees and perhaps also to outsiders. The payoffs include both revenue earned as a licensor, and technology acquired by pool members as licensees. <b>Public</b> <b>effects</b> can also be significant. For example, technology sharing of complementary patents can improve product quality and variety. In some information technology markets pools can prevent patents from becoming a costly obstacle to innovation by clearing channels of technology transfer. By contrast, a pool 2 ̆ 7 s aggregate output reduction or price fixing in a product market can produce cartel profits. A traditional justification for patent pools is that they facilitate improved products by uniting complements. Sharing of complementary patents means that licensees can then employ all the patents in their product, rather than creating silos in which each manufacturer incorporates only its own patented features. Pools created for this purpose can reduce problems of royalty stacking and holdup, as well as problems involving blocking patents. A more robust explanation for pooling in many markets comes out of the economics of transaction costs, which emphasizes the role of limited information and the costs of obtaining it, as well as uncertainty in bargaining and sharing. Pooling is an efficient solution to problems of technology development and transfer when determining patents 2 ̆ 7 validity or identifying their boundaries is costly. In this sense, patent pools function much as traditional common pool resources. An individual patent’s boundaries distinguish its protected technological embodiments from noninfringing technology. But when multiple patents are aggregated what really matters are the outer boundaries that separate the portfolio as a whole from outside patents or the public domain. So long as the relevant rights are somewhere in the portfolio, the parties do not need to delineate the boundaries of individual patents in order to strike a deal. While most patent pools are socially beneficial, certain practices or structures can pose competitive problems. The biggest antitrust risk from pooling is collusion, and its threat depends on two things. First is the market structure {{and the power of the}} pool within its market. Second is the nature of pricing and exclusivity arrangements within the pool. Pool 2 ̆ 2 exclusivity 2 ̆ 2 can take several forms. First, it can refer to the contract that each licensor has with the pool, asking whether that licensor is free to license to others outside of the pool. Second it can refer to the pool’s willingness as licensee to accept an offered technology from an outsider for inclusion in the pool. Third it can refer to the pool 2 ̆ 7 s willingness as licensor to license to outsider manufacturers. Fourth, it can refer to field-of-use or other restrictions given to licensees from the pool. A large but inconclusive literature considers the relationship between pooling and innovation. Conclusions are sensitive to assumptions about patent strength and quality, about the relationship among the patents in a pool and the strength of alternatives outside the pool, about the impact on innovation of insiders vs. outsiders to the pool, and finally, about the strategic responses of participants. Most of the literature concludes that most pools increase innovation rates. A pool should increase the demand for innovation of complements to the pool. First of all, access to the existing technology by pool members should be guaranteed and cheaper. To the extent the pool reduces licensing costs and eliminates royalty stacking the cost of further improvements should decline. When innovation is cumulative the development of new technology may require the licensing of existing technology with multiple patent holders. Pooling can reduce these costs and thus facilitate cumulative innovation...|$|E
