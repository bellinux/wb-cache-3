5|$|Antidiuretic hormone (ADH) {{deficiency}} {{leads to}} the syndrome of diabetes insipidus (unrelated to diabetes mellitus): inability to concentrate the urine, leading to <b>polyuria</b> (production of large amounts of clear urine) that is low in solutes, dehydration and—in compensation—extreme thirst and constant need to drink (polydipsia), as well as hypernatremia (high sodium levels in the blood). ADH deficiency may be masked if there is ACTH deficiency, with symptoms only appearing when cortisol has been replaced.|$|E
5|$|The {{addition}} of weight loss, appetite loss, vomiting, <b>polyuria,</b> and polydipsia to the aforementioned symptoms {{may indicate that}} OFC {{is the result of}} parathyroid carcinoma. Parathyroid carcinoma, an uncommon cancer of the parathyroid glands, is generally indicated by serum calcium levels higher than usual, even in comparison to the high serum calcium levels that OFC generally presents with. Symptoms are also often more severe. Generally, the presence of a palpable neck mass is also indicative of the cancer, occurring in approximately 50% of sufferers, but virtually nonexistent in individuals with OFC with a different origin.|$|E

25|$|Type 1 Diabetes Mellitus Nocturnal {{enuresis}} {{could be}} the presenting symptom of type 1 diabetes mellitus, classically associated with <b>polyuria,</b> polydipsia, and polyphagia; weight loss, lethargy, and diaper candidiasis may also be present in those with new-onset disease.|$|E
25|$|Decreased AVP release (neurogenic— i.e. due {{to alcohol}} {{intoxication}} or tumour) or decreased renal sensitivity to AVP (nephrogenic, i.e. by mutation of V2 receptor or AQP) leads to diabetes insipidus, a condition featuring hypernatremia (increased blood sodium concentration), <b>polyuria</b> (excess urine production), and polydipsia (thirst).|$|E
25|$|Common {{adverse effects}} of {{acetazolamide}} include the following: paraesthesia, fatigue, drowsiness, depression, decreased libido, bitter or metallic taste, nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, diarrhea, black feces, <b>polyuria,</b> kidney stones, metabolic acidosis and electrolyte changes (hypokalemia, hyponatremia). Whereas less common adverse effects include Stevens–Johnson syndrome, anaphylaxis and blood dyscrasias.|$|E
25|$|The use of {{vasopressin}} is contraindicated in {{the presence}} of hypersentivity to beef or pork proteins, increased BUN and chronic renal failure. It recommended that it be cautiously used in instances of perioperative <b>polyuria,</b> sensitivity to the drug, asthma, seizures, heart failure, a comatose state, migraine headaches, and cardiovascular disease.|$|E
25|$|Urinary tract infection*, {{specifically}} cystitis or bladder infection, {{is common}} in dogs and usually caused by bacteria. Signs include blood in the urine (hematuria), difficulty urinating (dysuria), and frequent urination (<b>polyuria).</b> The most common types of bacteria cultured from the urine of dogs with cystitis are E. coli, Staphylococcus spp., Proteus mirabilis, Streptococcus spp., Klebsiella pneumoniae, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Enterobacter spp.|$|E
25|$|Lithium-induced nephrogenic DI may be {{effectively}} managed {{with the administration}} of amiloride, a potassium-sparing diuretic often {{used in conjunction with}} thiazide or loop diuretics. Clinicians have been aware of lithium toxicity for many years, and traditionally have administered thiazide diuretics for lithium-induced <b>polyuria</b> and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. However, amiloride has recently been shown to be a successful treatment for this condition.|$|E
25|$|DDAVP is most {{efficient}} {{in children with}} nocturnal <b>polyuria</b> (nocturnal urine production greater than 130% of expected bladder capacity for age) and normal bladder reservoir function (maximum voided volume greater than 70% of expected bladder capacity for age). Other children who are likely candidates for desmopressin treatment are those in whom alarm therapy has failed or those considered unlikely to comply with alarm therapy. It can be very useful for summer camp and sleepovers to prevent enuresis.|$|E
25|$|Average urine {{production}} in adult humans is around 1.4 L of urine {{per person per}} day with a normal range of 0.6 to 2.6 L {{per person per day}}, produced in around 6 to 8 urinations per day depending on state of hydration, activity level, environmental factors, weight, and the individual's health. Producing {{too much or too little}} urine needs medical attention. <b>Polyuria</b> is a condition of excessive production of urine (> 2.5 L/day), oliguria when < 400 mL are produced, and anuria one of < 100 mL per day.|$|E
25|$|The acute {{stage of}} the disease, {{occurring}} most often {{in the spring and}} summer, begins one to three weeks after infection and lasts for two to four weeks. Clinical signs include a fever, petechiae, bleeding disorders, vasculitis, lymphadenopathy, discharge from the nose and eyes, and edema of the legs and scrotum. There are no outward signs of the subclinical phase. Clinical signs of the chronic phase include weight loss, pale gums due to anemia, bleeding due to thrombocytopenia, vasculitis, lymphadenopathy, dyspnea, coughing, <b>polyuria,</b> polydipsia, lameness, ophthalmic diseases such as retinal hemorrhage and anterior uveitis, and neurological disease. Dogs that are severely affected can die from this disease.|$|E
25|$|Precautions {{should be}} taken in {{patients}} with an established diagnosis of diabetes mellitus who are started on atypical antipsychotics along with other medications that affect blood sugar levels and should be monitored regularly for worsening of glucose control. The liquid form (oral solution) of this medication may contain up to 15 grams of sugar per dose. Patients with risk factors for diabetes mellitus (e.g., obesity, family history of diabetes) who are starting treatment with atypical antipsychotics should undergo fasting blood glucose testing {{at the beginning of}} treatment and periodically during treatment. Any patient treated with atypical antipsychotics should be monitored for symptoms of hyperglycemia including polydipsia (excessive thirst), <b>polyuria</b> (excessive urination), polyphagia (increased appetite), and weakness.|$|E
25|$|In animals, {{diabetes}} is most commonly encountered in dogs and cats. Middle-aged animals are most commonly affected. Female dogs {{are twice as}} likely to be affected as males, while according to some sources, male cats are also more prone than females. In both species, all breeds may be affected, but some small dog breeds are particularly likely to develop diabetes, such as Miniature Poodles. The symptoms may relate to fluid loss and <b>polyuria,</b> but the course may also be insidious. Diabetic animals are more prone to infections. The long-term complications recognized in humans are much rarer in animals. The principles of treatment (weight loss, oral antidiabetics, subcutaneous insulin) and management of emergencies (e.g. ketoacidosis) are similar to those in humans.|$|E
25|$|Since the glucose that {{normally}} enters the cells {{is unable to}} do so without insulin, it begins to build up in the blood where it can be seen as hyperglycemia or high blood glucose levels. The tubules of the kidneys are normally able to re-absorb glucose, but they are unable to handle and process the amount of glucose they are being presented with. At this point, which is called the renal threshold, the excess glucose spills into the urine (glycosuria), where it can be seen in urine glucose testing. It is the <b>polyuria,</b> or over-frequent urination, which causes polydipsia, or excessive water consumption, through an osmotic process. Even though there is an overabundance of glucose, the lack of insulin does not allow it to enter the cells. As a result, they are not able to receive nourishment from their normal glucose source. The body begins using fat for this purpose, causing weight loss; the process {{is similar to that of}} starvation.|$|E
500|$|Diabetic {{ketoacidosis}} arises {{because of}} a lack of insulin in the body. The lack of insulin and corresponding elevation of glucagon leads to increased release of glucose by the liver (a process that is normally suppressed by insulin) from glycogen via glycogenolysis and [...] also through gluconeogenesis. High glucose levels spill over into the urine, taking water and solutes (such as sodium and potassium) along with it in a process known as osmotic diuresis. This leads to <b>polyuria,</b> dehydration, and polydipsia. The absence of insulin also leads to the release of free fatty acids from adipose tissue (lipolysis), which are converted through a process called beta oxidation, again in the liver, into ketone bodies (acetoacetate and β-hydroxybutyrate). β-Hydroxybutyrate can serve as an energy source in the absence of insulin-mediated glucose delivery, and is a protective mechanism in case of starvation. The ketone bodies, however, have a low pKa and therefore turn the blood acidic (metabolic acidosis). The body initially buffers the change with the bicarbonate buffering system, but this system is quickly overwhelmed and other mechanisms must work to compensate for the acidosis. One such mechanism is hyperventilation to lower the blood carbon dioxide levels (a form of compensatory respiratory alkalosis). This hyperventilation, in its extreme form, may be observed as Kussmaul respiration.|$|E

2500|$|The main {{symptoms}} of vitamin D overdose which {{are those of}} hypercalcemia including anorexia, nausea, and vomiting. [...] These may be followed by <b>polyuria,</b> polydipsia, weakness, insomnia, nervousness, pruritus and ultimately renal failure. [...] Furthermore, proteinuria, urinary casts, azotemia, and metastatic calcification (especially in the kidneys) may develop. [...] Other {{symptoms of}} vitamin D toxicity include mental retardation in young children, abnormal bone growth and formation, diarrhea, irritability, weight loss, and severe depression.|$|E
2500|$|When the glucose {{concentration}} in the blood remains high over time, the kidneys will reach a threshold of reabsorption, and glucose will be excreted in the urine (glycosuria). [...] This increases the osmotic pressure of the urine and inhibits reabsorption of water by the kidney, resulting in increased urine production (<b>polyuria)</b> and increased fluid loss. Lost blood volume will be replaced osmotically from water held in body cells and other body compartments, causing dehydration and increased thirst (polydipsia).|$|E
50|$|Nocturia {{has four}} major {{underlying}} causes: global <b>polyuria,</b> nocturnal <b>polyuria,</b> bladder storage disorders, or mixed cause. The first two processes {{are due to}} irregular levels of AVP or ANH. The third process is a vesical problem.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Polyuria</b> (...) is {{excessive}} or an abnormally large {{production or}} passage of urine (greater than 2.5 or 3 L over 24 hours in adults). Frequent urination is usually an accompanying symptom. Increased production and passage of urine {{may also be}} termed diuresis. <b>Polyuria</b> often appears in conjunction with polydipsia (increased thirst), though {{it is possible to}} have one without the other, and the latter may be a cause or an effect. Psychogenic polydipsia may lead to <b>polyuria.</b> <b>Polyuria</b> is usually viewed as a symptom or sign of another disorder (not a disease by itself), but it can be classed as a disorder, at least when its underlying causes are not clear.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Polyuria</b> (excessive urine production) of which, in turn, {{the most}} {{frequent}} causes are: uncontrolled diabetes mellitus, primary polydipsia (excessive fluid drinking), central diabetes insipidus and nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. <b>Polyuria</b> generally causes urinary urgency and frequency, but doesn't necessarily lead to incontinence.|$|E

5000|$|Depending on {{the cause}} of the <b>polyuria,</b> the {{adequate}} treatment should be afforded. According to NICE, desmopressin can be considered for nocturnal <b>polyuria,</b> which can be caused by diabetes mellitus, [...] if other medical treatments have failed. The recommendation had no studies that met the criteria for consideration.|$|E
5000|$|Nocturnal <b>polyuria</b> {{is defined}} as an {{increase}} in urine production during the night but with a proportional decrease in daytime urine production that results in a normal 24-hour urine volume. With the 24-hour urine production within normal limits, nocturnal <b>polyuria</b> can be translated to having a nocturnal <b>polyuria</b> index (NPi) greater than 35% of the normal 24-hour urine volume. NPi is calculated simply by dividing NUV by the 24-hour urine volume. [...] Similar to the inability of control urination, a disruption of arginine vasopressin (AVP) levels has been proposed for nocturia. Compared with the normal patients, nocturia patients have a nocturnal decrease in AVP level. Other causes of nocturnal <b>polyuria</b> include diseases such as congestive heart failure, nephritic syndrome and liver failure; or lifestyle patterns such as excessive nighttime drinking. The increased airway resistance {{that is associated with}} obstructive sleep apnea may also lead to nocturnal <b>polyuria.</b> Obstructive sleep apnea sufferers have shown to have increases in renal sodium and water excretion that are mediated by elevated plasma ANH levels.|$|E
50|$|Other {{causes of}} <b>polyuria</b> may, less commonly, cause {{frequent}} urination.|$|E
50|$|<b>Polyuria</b> in osmotic cases, {{increases}} flow {{amount in}} the distal nephron where flow rates and velocity are low.
