40|$|Objectives: The aim of {{the study}} was to {{investigate}} the association between activity of ankylosing spondylitis (AS) and decrease in quality of life as well as productivity loss of affected patients in a specified group of patients in the Polish setting. Material and methods : An questionnaire survey was conducted using the Bath Ankylosing Spondylitis Disease Activity Index (BASDAI) to assess disease activity, as well as the Work Productivity and Activity Impairment Questionnaires to assess productivity loss; quality of life was presented as utility calculated using the EuroQol 5 questionnaire and also measured on a visual analogue scale (VAS). Indirect costs were assessed with the human capital approach implying gross domestic product per capita or gross value added per worker in Poland in 2014 and were expressed in <b>Polish</b> <b>zlotys</b> (<b>PLN)</b> as well as in euros. Correlation was presented using Spearman’s rank correlation coefficient. Results : We performed our analysis based on 78 full questionnaires collected. A mean BASDAI score of 5. 91 in the analysed group of patients was detected and mean utility of 0. 5135 was observed. Average quality of life measured on the visual analogue scale was 46. 55. Mean number of days off work was 45. 26 days per year and mean on-the-job productivity loss was 49. 29 %. Average annual indirect costs per patient were € 4241 (17 686 PLN) calculated using gross domestic product and € 10 172 (42 417 PLN) estimated using gross value added. Total productivity loss was significantly correlated with disease activity (strong correlation of 0. 6005) and utility (moderate correlation of – 0. 3698). Conclusions : Ankylosing spondylitis causes a great decrease in quality of life as well as patients’ productivity loss associated with both absenteeism and presenteeism. The greater the disease activity is, the lower is the utility, the lower is the quality of life measured on the VAS, and the greater are the total annual indirect costs. Total indirect costs were negatively correlated with utility; although the association was moderate, it was significant...|$|R
40|$|In {{order to}} study whether public pension systems {{displace}} private saving, {{we use the}} quasi-experimental variation in pension wealth created by Poland’s 1999 pension reform. Using the 1997 – 2003 Polish Household Budget Surveys, we begin by estimating “difference-in-differences ” regressions, where we compare household saving and expenditure across time and between cohorts affected and unaffected by the reform. Next, we estimate the extent of crowd-out by using two-stage least squares. We identify the effect of pension wealth on private saving by using the cohort-by-time variation in pension wealth that is explained by the reform. We find that one additional <b>Polish</b> <b>zloty,</b> or <b>PLN,</b> of pension wealth crowds out about 0. 24 PLN in household saving. We also find heterogeneity in responses. For the middle-aged cohorts, we find a large public pension crowd-out of private saving (about 0. 54 PLN of private saving for each 1 PLN of public pension wealth), while the crowd-out for younger cohorts equals about 0. 30 PLN of private saving per 1 PLN. Finally, we find a close-to-complete crowd-out among highly...|$|R

Methods: Clinical effectiveness data were obtained from prior clinical studies of automatic versus manually coded blood glucose meters. Cost data {{were obtained from the}} NHF. The probability of procedure use related to diabetic complications was obtained from four medical centers in Poland. The incremental cost-effectiveness ratio related to 1 life year gained and the incremental cost-utility ratio related to 1 quality-adjusted life year gained were calculated. Results: Assuming co-funding from public funds, introduction of the CONTOUR&reg; TS is associated with savings of <b>Polish</b> <b>złoty</b> (<b>PLN)</b> 31, 846. 19 (&euro; 8916. 93) and PLN 113, 018. 19 (&euro; 31, 645. 09) per life year gained from the payer and public payer perspectives, respectively. Cost utility analyses showed that the CONTOUR&reg; TS is associated with savings of PLN 40, 465. 59 (&euro; 11, 330. 37) and PLN 11, 434. 82 (&euro; 3201. 75) per quality-adjusted life year gained from the payer and the public payer perspectives, respectively.

40|$|Objective : The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to analyse the prevalence of psoriatic arthritis (PsA) in Poland and to assess the costs generated by treatment of PsA patients in the system of public healthcare. Material and methods : The analysis was based on the database of the public payer, the National Health Fund (NFZ). PsA was defined by the diagnostic ICD- 10 codes M 07 (Enteropathic arthropathies) and L 40. 5 (Psoriatic arthropathies). The estimate of the costs was based on the reports submitted to the NFZ by health service providers. The prevalence rates were calculated using the NFZ data and the population estimates from the Central Statistical Office of Poland (GUS). Results : In 2015, the prevalence of PsA (ICD- 10 : L 40. 5 and M 07) in Poland was 3. 2 per 10 000 population (3. 7 in women and 2. 6 in men). In 2015, nearly 7. 3 thousand patients with the diagnosis of M 07 and 6. 3 thousand patients with the diagnosis of L 40. 5 received healthcare benefits. Women accounted for 60. 6 % of those patients. Nearly three fourths of PsA patients were aged 40 to 69 years with the median age of 54 years (56 years in women and 50 years in men). Between 2008 and 2015 the NFZ expenditure on the treatment of PsA increased from 6. 6 million <b>Polish</b> <b>zloty</b> (<b>PLN)</b> (1. 9 million EUR) to PLN 50. 8 million (12. 1 million EUR). In the same period, the number of PsA patients increased from 3. 4 thousand to 11. 9 thousand. In 2015, the mean cost of treatment per PsA patient was PLN 3. 8 thousand. Conclusions : The PsA prevalence rates estimated by the authors from the NFZ database are clearly lower than those derived from studies in other European countries, which may suggest that the actual number of PsA patients in Poland may be underestimated. Still the number of patients treated for PsA increased nearly 3. 5 -fold during 2008 – 2015, when the cost of PsA treatment rose more than 7 times...|$|E

In the USSR, the Gundlach periscope was known as MK-4 and implemented in all tanks (including the T-34 and T-70). All Axis tanks and APC (including tanks of Italy, Romania, Hungary, Finland and Japan) were equipped or retro-fitted with this periscope until 1941.The technology was later transferred to the USA and implemented as the M6 periscope in all US tanks (M3/M5 Stuart, M4 Sherman and others).

40|$|AbstractObjectiveThe aim of {{the study}} was to {{estimate}} the cost-effectiveness of alternative therapeutic strategies for the management of chronic hepatitis B (CHB) in Poland. MethodsThe model for the Polish health-care context was based on clinical data from the literature and local data on health-care resource utilization and unit costs. Costs and effects of a population of CHB patients were modeled using four scenarios, which attempt to reflect real-life practice in which patients may receive any of the treatment options available and in which a proportion of patients may still receive no treatment because therapy is not suitable. Strategies A and B assumed the availability of both treatment options: the first choice of treatment is in A, lamivudine, and in B, interferon alpha (IFN-α). In strategy C, the only approved treatment is IFN-α, and in strategy D, the patients receive no antiviral treatment. The outcome measures were HBeAg seroconversion and nonprogression to cirrhosis—the surrogate marker with predictive value for improved survival. Only direct medical costs were analyzed. The payer's perspective and time horizon of 1 year were adopted. One-way sensitivity analysis and extreme scenario analysis were performed. ResultsThe best results in terms of seroconversion and nonprogression to cirrhosis were achieved for strategy A, costs were lowest for strategy D, and strategies B and C were dominated by strategy A. The incremental cost/effectiveness ratio (ICER) comparing strategy A with strategy D was 57, 855 <b>Polish</b> new <b>zloty</b> (<b>PLN)</b> per extra seroconversion and 79, 550 PLN per cirrhosis case avoided. ConclusionsCirrhosis reduces estimated life expectancy by 37. 76 years and by 20 years among 30 - and 50 -year-olds, respectively. The ICER for strategies A and D was 2105 PLN and 3978 PLN per life-years gained for the population at ages 30 and 50, respectively, and was below the suggested threshold for cost-effectiveness, based on treatment costs for 1 year of hemodialysis in Poland (62, 400 PLN). Changing the value of key drivers for sensitivity analysis did not have a significant effect on the ICER...|$|R
