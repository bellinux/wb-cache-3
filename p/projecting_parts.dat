60|$|There are two {{diametrically}} opposed methods of printing, each being the complement of the other. The method used in ordinary printing, is to ink the projecting surfaces only, leaving the depressed parts clean. The other method, used in printing from engraved plates, is to ink the whole surface, {{and then to}} clean the ink from the <b>projecting</b> <b>parts,</b> leaving the depressions only filled with it. Either of these two courses can be adopted in taking finger prints, but not the two together, for when they are combined in equal degrees the result must be a plain black blot.|$|E
6000|$|... 1564. A copper boiler 3 feet in {{diameter}} was insulated and electrified, but so feebly, that dissipation by brushes or disruptive discharge did not occur at its edges or <b>projecting</b> <b>parts</b> in a sensible degree. A brass ball, 2 inches {{in diameter}}, suspended by a clean white silk thread, was brought towards it, and it was found that, if the ball was held {{for a second or}} two near any part of the charged surface of the boiler, at such distance (two inches more or less) as not to receive any direct charge from it, it became itself charged, although insulated the whole time; and its electricity was the reverse of that of the boiler.|$|E

This {{effect was}} the strongest {{opposite}} the edges and <b>projecting</b> <b>parts</b> of the boiler, and weaker opposite the sides, or those extended portions of the surface which, according to Coulomb's results, have the weakest charge. It was very strong opposite a rod projecting a little way from the boiler. It occurred when the copper was charged negatively as well as positively: it was produced also with small balls down to 0.2 of an inch and less in diameter, and also with smaller charged conductors than the copper. It is, indeed, hardly possible {{in some cases to}} carry an insulated ball within an inch or two of a charged plane or convex surface without its receiving a charge of the contrary kind to that of the surface.|$|E

The turf-covered border sloped up to the stone on one side to a height of 4 inches, and on the opposite side to only 2.5 inches above the general level. A hole was dug on the eastern side, and the base of the stone was here found to lie at a depth of 4 inches beneath the general level of the ground, and of 8 inches beneath the top of the sloping turf-covered border.|$|E
60|$|Absorption often {{plays an}} {{important}} part in the repair of injuries. When a bone is broken and does not unite, the ends are absorbed and rounded, so that a false joint is formed; or if the ends unite, but overlap, the <b>projecting</b> <b>parts</b> are removed. (24/7. Prof. Marey's discussion on the power of co- adaptation {{in all parts of the}} organisation is excellent. 'La Machine Animale' 1873 chapter 9. See also Paget 'Lectures' etc. page 257.) A dislocated bone will form for itself a new socket. Displaced tendons and varicose veins excavate new channels in the bones against which they press. But absorption comes into action, as Virchow remarks, during the normal growth of bones; parts which are solid during youth become hollowed out for the medullary tissue as the bone increases in size. In trying to understand the many well- adapted cases of regrowth when aided by absorption, we should remember that almost all parts of the organisation, even whilst retaining the same form, undergo constant renewal; so that a part which is not renewed would be liable to absorption.|$|E
60|$|But look at {{the mass}} of {{mountain}} on the right in Turner's Daphne hunting with Leucippus. It is simple, broad, and united as one surge of a swelling sea; it rises in an unbroken line along the valley, and lifts its promontories with an equal slope. But it contains in its body ten thousand hills. There is not {{a quarter of an}} inch of its surface without its suggestion of increasing distance and individual form. First, on the right, you have a range of tower-like precipices, the clinging wood climbing along their ledges and cresting their summits, white waterfalls gleaming through its leaves; not, as in Claude's scientific ideals, poured in vast torrents over the top, and carefully keeping all the way down on the most <b>projecting</b> <b>parts</b> of the sides; but stealing down, traced from point to point, through shadow after shadow, by their evanescent foam and flashing light,--here a wreath, and there a ray,--through the deep chasms and hollow ravines, out of which rise the soft rounded slopes of mightier mountain, surge beyond surge, immense and numberless, of delicate and gradual curve, accumulating in the sky until their garment of forest is exchanged for the shadowy fold of slumbrous morning cloud, above which the utmost silver peak shines islanded and alone. Put what mountain painting you will beside this, of any other artist, and its heights will look like mole-hills in comparison, because it will not have the unity nor the multiplicity which are in nature, and with Turner, the signs of size.|$|E

The bay is a wonderful sight. The shores are strewn with floating timber, bales of stores, compressed hay, and all sorts of things. Fellows who have been down to the town told me that lots of the houses have been damaged, roofs blown away, and those gingerbread-looking balconies smashed off.

6000|$|Old James (grandfather on the {{maternal}} side) had simply called as a visitor. He {{lived in a}} cottage by himself, and many people considered him a miser; some, rather slovenly in his habits. He now came forward from behind grandfather William, and his stooping figure formed a well- illuminated picture as he passed towards the fire-place. Being by trade a mason, he wore a long linen apron reaching almost to his toes, corduroy breeches and gaiters, which, together with his boots, graduated in tints of whitish-brown by constant friction against lime and stone. He also wore a very stiff fustian coat, having folds at the elbows and shoulders as unvarying in their arrangement as those {{in a pair of}} bellows: the ridges and the <b>projecting</b> <b>parts</b> of the coat collectively exhibiting a shade {{different from that of the}} hollows, which were lined with small ditch-like accumulations of stone and mortar-dust. The extremely large side-pockets, sheltered beneath wide flaps, bulged out convexly whether empty or full; and as he was often engaged to work at buildings far away--his breakfasts and dinners being eaten in a strange chimney-corner, by a garden wall, on a heap of stones, or walking along the road--he carried in these pockets a small tin canister of butter, a small canister of sugar, a small canister of tea, a paper of salt, and a paper of pepper; the bread, cheese, and meat, forming the substance of his meals, hanging up behind him in his basket among the hammers and chisels. If a passer-by looked hard at him when he was drawing forth any of these, [...] "My buttery," [...] he said, with a pinched smile.|$|E

5000|$|A grapevine's {{leaves are}} the most visible part of the canopy and {{also one of the}} most important. It is through the leaves that the vital {{physiological}} process of photosynthesis takes places which creates the carbohydrates that the vine needs to grow and process grape clusters. The size of the leaves vary due to grape varieties with varieties like Merlot having very large leaves and Gewürztraminer noted for having small leaves. The typical size is normally comparable to that of a human hand. In addition to size, there are many of other unique characteristics to the leaves that ampelographers use for plant identification. The size and shape of the leaf's sinus (the opening space where the blade of the leaf connects to the petiole), the shape of the [...] "teeth" [...] along the outer edge, the arrangement of the five lobes or <b>projecting</b> <b>parts</b> and the angle and length of the veins can all assist in identifying the grapevine.|$|E

5000|$|Designed by Jean de la Vallée (1620-1696), {{the palace}} of the mighty {{chancellor}} Axel Oxenstierna was started in 1653 shortly before {{the death of the}} proprietor. The present building, merely a wing of the huge palace originally intended for the site, introduced the Roman palace architecture acting by means of elaborately decorated windows on a plain plastered wall. The interplay with the urban setting is underlined by the <b>projecting</b> <b>parts</b> of the southern façade being aligned to the street and thus not perpendicular to the façade. [...] The building is unique for the well preserved exterior, including the various sandstone decorations, and the alternating mezzanines of the five storeys, and the interior, including decorative 17th century hinges. Notwithstanding the name, the Oxenstierna dynasty never actually lived in the building, instead serving as offices since its completion. The equivalent of the Bank of Sweden occupied the building in the end of the 17th century, and it has been the property of the Swedish State since.|$|E
