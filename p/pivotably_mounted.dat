40|$|A {{rotational}} {{joint assembly}} for a prosthetic leg has been devised, which enables an artificial foot to rotate slightly {{when a person}} is walking, running or turning. The prosthetic leg includes upper and lower tubular members with the rotational joint assembly interposed between them. The assembly includes a restrainer mechanism which consists of a <b>pivotably</b> <b>mounted</b> paddle element. This device applies limiting force to control the rotation of the foot and also restores torque to return the foot back to its initial position...|$|E
40|$|An {{automatic}} apparatus {{is described}} for microbiologically sampling surface using a cotton swab which eliminates human error. The apparatus includes a self-powered transport device, {{such as a}} motor-driven wheeled cart, which mounts a swabbing motor drive for a crank arm which supports a swab in the free end thereof. The swabbing motor is <b>pivotably</b> <b>mounted</b> and an actuator rod movable responsive to the cart traveling a predetermined distance provides lifting of the swab from the surface being sampled and reversal of the direction of travel of the cart...|$|E
40|$|A {{grinding}} {{arrangement for}} spiral fluted ball nose end mills and like tools includes a tool holder for positioning the tool {{relative to a}} grinding wheel. The tool is mounted in a spindle within the tool holder for rotation about its centerline and the tool holder is <b>pivotably</b> <b>mounted</b> for angular movement about an axis which intersects that centerline. A follower arm of a cam follower secured to the spindle cooperates with a specially shaped cam to provide rotation of the tool during the angular movement of the tool holder during the grinding cycle, by an amount determined by the cam profile. In this way {{the surface of the}} cutting edge in contact with the grinding wheel is maintained at the same height on the grinding wheel throughout the angular movement of the tool holder during the grinding cycle...|$|E
40|$|A {{method for}} {{coupling}} an engine to a support frame for mounting to a fuselage of an aircraft using a three point vibration isolating mounting {{system in which}} the load reactive forces at each mounting point are statically and dynamically determined. A first vibration isolating <b>mount</b> <b>pivotably</b> couples a first end of an elongated support beam to a stator portion of an engine with the pivoting action of the vibration mount being oriented such that it is pivotable about a line parallel to a center line of the engine. An aft end of the supporting frame is coupled to the engine through an additional pair of vibration isolating mounts with the mounts being oriented such that they are pivotable about a circumference of the engine. The aft mounts are symmetrically spaced to each side of the supporting frame by 45 degrees. The relative orientation between the front mount and the pair of rear mounts is such that only the rear mounts provide load reactive forces parallel to the engine center line, in support of the engine to the aircraft against thrust forces. The forward mount is oriented so as to provide only radial forces to the engine and some lifting forces to maintain the engine in position adjacent a fuselage. Since each mount is connected to provide specific forces to support the engine, forces required of each mount are statically and dynamically determinable...|$|R
40|$|The {{invention}} {{relates to}} a joint arrangement having at least one driven axis, in particular for activating a movement of a component of a robot, wherein a first base element (15) receives a first rotary element (16), and the first rotary element (16) is rotatable about a first axis of rotation (14), the first rotary element (16) receives a second axis of rotation (18), separate from the first axis of rotation (14) and about which a second rotary element (22) is <b>pivotably</b> <b>mounted</b> on the first rotary element (16), the second rotary element (22) has a third axis of rotation (25) separate from the second axis of rotation (18) and about which a second base element (26) is rotatable {{with respect to the}} second rotary element (22), the second axis of rotation (18) has an axial offset (19) in relation to the first axis of rotation (14), and the second axis of rotation (18); is inclined with respect to the first axis of rotation (14), and the first and second axes of rotation (14, 18) have a point of intersection (29) which lies outside the joint arrangement (11) ...|$|E
40|$|DE 102009024334 A 1 UPAB: 20110101 NOVELTY - The {{apparatus}} {{for feeding}} a material coating on a building platform or a material coating present on a building {{platform for the}} production of an object {{in the way of a}} generative production process, where the object is linearly movable mounted relative to a material reservoir and the building platform along a moving plane, to which the material reservoir and the building platform are deflectable in an orthogonal manner, comprises a belt (13) that tightly circulates around two rigid shaped bodies and fits onto the shaped bodies in an areawise manner, and a drive. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - The apparatus for feeding a material coating on a building platform or a material coating present on a building platform {{for the production of}} an object in the way of a generative production process, where the object is linearly movable mounted relative to a material reservoir and the building platform along a moving plane, to which the material reservoir and the building platform are deflectable in an orthogonal manner, comprises a belt (13) that tightly circulates around two rigid shaped bodies and fits onto the shaped bodies in an areawise manner, and a drive transferring the belt in circulation around the shaped bodies. The belt has a belt portion (17), which is fixedly arrangeable relative to one of the shaped bodies, in belt longitudinal extension around the shaped bodies, where the belt portion areawisely contacts with the material during the linear movement from the material reservoir to the building platform. A belt surface area is assigned to the belt portion and is inclined at an angle (alpha) against the moving plane. The shaped bodies are formed as cylinder rollers (11, 12, 12 ') with roller axes running parallel to each other. The shaped bodies are formed as rigid sliding bodies, where the belt is slidably guided to a partial surface of the sliding bodies that serves for supporting the belt surface area inclined at the angle of alpha. The shaped body has a partial surface that serves for supporting the belt surface area inclined at the angle of alpha. The roller bodies, over which the belt is rollably mounted, are provided on the partial surface of the shaped body. The inclination of the belt surface area at the angle (alpha) is adjustable by using cylinder rollers differently sized in roller diameter. One of the cylinder rollers is <b>pivotably</b> <b>mounted</b> relative to the other cylinder roller. The drive is formed as motorically driven cylinder roller. The belt has a coating made of polytetrafluoroethylene. The belt surface turned to the material has a nanocoating. The belt has continuous pores. The belt portion, which contacts with the material, has a belt rolling direction turned away from the moving plane. A vibrating unit is integrated in one shaped body for generating vibrations. An INDEPENDENT CLAIM is included for a method for feeding a material coating on a building platform or a material coating present on a building platform for the production of an object in the way of a generative production process. USE - Apparatus for feeding a material coating on a building platform or a material coating present on a building platform for the production of an object in the way of a generative production process. ADVANTAGE - The apparatus is capable of simply and effectively feeding the material coating on the building platform without material shrinkage or shape distortion...|$|E
