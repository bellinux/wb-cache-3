40|$|This paper {{introduces}} the approach types of agricultural technology promotion we can choose {{in the process}} of new countryside construction, and there are mainly 6 types, namely government-domination-oriented approach, market-development-oriented approach, university (scientific research institution) -education-oriented approach, farmers' <b>participation-oriented</b> <b>approach,</b> direct-training-oriented approach and individual-service oriented approach including 20 models. The problems existing in the grass-root agricultural technology promotion {{in the process of}} new village construction are analyzed as follows: the awareness of innovation is not strong; scientific research, education, and promotion are disjointed; the construction of specific work system lags behind; me structure of promotion team is irrational, and the quality of promotion personnel is yet to be promoted; the cultural quality of farmers is low, and the cooperative organizations are not sound; the working conditions are poor, and the basic security is inadequate; the investment channel is simple and the supply amount is badly short; the methods of agricultural technology promotion do not adapt to the requirements of new situation. According to the characteristics and internal requirements of grass-roots agricultural technology promotion, we creatively design an overall working model, and put forward new measures from objective of grass-root agricultural technology promotion, service object, service content, organization work and scope, method, role of agricultural technology personnel and so on.

40|$|As {{planning}} in Lagos shifts away from informal urban development and towards formal development, informal settlement residents {{are wary of}} the changes that will result from this approach. Studies shows that formal urban development in Nigeria's city of Lagos is derived and influenced by the colonial planning experience. As a result, decisions affecting local residents are often made without involving them in discussion. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate residents’ participation in planning decision-making, using Makoko in Lagos as a case study. The case study was carried out through fieldwork, interviews (residents and key actors), and analysis of secondary data. The study also examines and brings the experience of participatory planning undertaken in Mathare in Nairobi, Kenya as a case from which to draw lessons. The Makoko case shows that the slum development strategy is characterized by exclusion and deprivation. It is non-participatory and controlled by the government. The Mathare case reveals how participatory planning created opportunities for local residents to partake and collaborate with state and non-state actors. This study recommends a total paradigm shift from the government driven and top-down approach to people's <b>participation-oriented</b> <b>approach.</b> It recommends a pro-active role for non-governmental actors in developing settlement plans that safeguard the interests of local residents. The findings contribute to understanding how participatory planning can be used to engage local residents in addressing slum regeneration or redevelopment concerns in Lagos...|$|E
40|$|From {{its early}} birth {{through to the}} twenty-first century, the {{planning}} for social infrastructure has been viewed as a crucial element in promoting the development of healthy communities. The existence of good social infrastructure in every level of human settlement (i. e. neighbourhoods, districts, regions etc.) is vital because it {{is considered to be}} an element that impacts positively and meaningfully on {{the quality of life for}} members of the targeted community. The increasing importance of the sustainable development agenda in human settlements has prompted concerns over the cost of the government’s failure to provide for adequate social infrastructure for their communities. Part of this failure is attributed to the inconsistent outcome from the use of traditional planning standards that are based on population-to-facility ratios. This paper explores the literature discussion on social infrastructure for sustainable communities. It examines how a <b>participation-oriented,</b> need-sensitive <b>approach</b> in the planning and provision of social infrastructure is used as an alternative to the traditional standards that are based on population-to-facility ratios. It does this by giving an overview of its application in the planning and provision of social infrastructure for Australia’s fastest growing region of South-East Queensland...|$|R
40|$|Introduction. The {{evaluation}} of community action is an advisable practice in community work, {{that can help}} to properly manage resources and to improve social and educational interventions.  Participation-oriented evaluation approaches are an opportunity to evaluate community action relying involving all stakeholders, not just those with technical background and skills. With the basis provided by the information of international literature on the subject, {{in this paper we}} make a theoretical analysis of <b>participation-oriented</b> evaluation <b>approaches,</b> with three goals: to justify its relevance in the {{evaluation of}} community actions; to present the specific characteristics of the most cited participatory approaches in that literature, and to clarify their shared characteristics.   Method. We carried out a systematic review and analysis of articles published in international journals on evaluation and community development since 2000.   Results. The results present the specific features of four approaches used in the field of evaluation of  community actions: (1) Collaborative evaluation; (2) Practical-Participatory Evaluation; (3) Transformative- Participatory evaluation; and (4) Empowerment Evaluation; and the characteristics shared by these four methods,  besides other approaches referenced in the bibliography attached, which are focused on the participation  of people. Conclusions. From our point of view, the models that best fit the socio-educational approaches to community action are the Transformative-Participatory Evaluation and the Empowerment Evaluation. The Participatory Evaluation in which we frame our actions is the one that allows us to change and to acquire in this process, new powers that allow us to transform the reality we are living in. </p...|$|R
40|$|Empowerment of {{the poor}} entails three basic inter-linked {{dimensions}} – generation of employment (and income), reduction of poverty, and erasing inequality. The perspective has now undergone a basic change from the collective care mechanism of a paternalistic state intervention meted out from the top to bottom to a people-centered and <b>participation-oriented</b> bottom up <b>approach.</b> With this new perspective, new practices have emerged through integrated community participation {{of the poor}}. Thus {{the basis of the}} concept of micro finance is self-mobilization and self-organization of the poor at the community level driven by an ardent desire backed by an unfaltering trust in their own inherent capacity to improve their living conditions by themselves, given an enabling environment. An active realization of such self-mobilization is found in self help groups (SHGs), formed for distributing the microcredit benefits, inspired by the success of the Bangladesh Grameen experiment. This approach has already taken strong roots across the lengths and breadths of India as an effective and viable channel to take the poor to a new domain of economic empowerment and social upliftment. Microcredit, which synergies the thrift and credit habits of the poor in a participatory and informal setting, is now widely acknowledged as a strategic tool in all poverty alleviation programmes. This paper discusses the Indian experience in microcredit. ...|$|R
