However, the molecular basis of recognition between the trans-PtTz-DNA and HMGB 1 remains unclear. In the present work, we described a hydrogen/deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) method in combination with docking simulation to decipher the interactions of <b>platinated</b> DNA with domain A of HMGB 1. The global deuterium uptake results indicated that 1 -trans-PtTz-DNA bound to HMGB 1 a slightly tighter than the 1, 2 -cis-Pt-DNA. The local deuterium uptake at the peptide level revealed that the helices I and II, and loop 1 of HMGB 1 a were involved in the interactions with both <b>platinated</b> DNA adducts. However, docking simulation disclosed different H-bonding networks and distinct DNA-backbone orientations in the two Pt-DNA-HMGB 1 a complexes. Moreover, the Phe 37 residue of HMGB 1 a was shown to {{play a key role in}} the recognition between HMGB 1 a and the <b>platinated</b> DNAs. In the cis-Pt-DNA-HMGB 1 a complex, the phenyl ring of Phe 37 intercalates into a hydrophobic notch created by the two <b>platinated</b> guanines, while in the trans-PtTz-DNA-HMGB 1 a complex the phenyl ring appears to intercalate into a hydrophobic crevice formed by the <b>platinated</b> guanine and the opposite adenine in the complementary strand, forming a penta-layer π–π stacking associated with the adjacent thymine and the thiazole ligand.

40|$|Four {{carboxylate}} terminated half generation polyamdioamine (PAMAM) dendrimers (G 3. 5 - G 6. 5) were conjugated {{with the}} active components of cisplatin, {Pt(NH 3) 2 } 2 +, or oxaliplatin, {Pt(R,R-dach) } 2 +, to form dendrimer <b>platinate</b> complexes. The platinum {{content of the}} cisplatin containing complexes was measured using inductively coupled plasma atomic emission spectroscopy. The number of cisplatin molecules was found to increase with increasing dendrimer size, 22 – 94, however the assumed bidentate binding mode allows {{for a total of}} 32 – 256 cisplatin moieties per dendrimer. Whilst the number of cisplatin moieties increases with dendrimer size, a decrease in the binding efficiency is also observed with dendrimer size, 68 – 37 % (G 3. 5 - 6. 5). This decrease is probably due to the close proximity of surface groups of larger dendrimers, i. e. more branched, increasing the difficulty in deprotonating the carboxylic acids to obtain the carboxylate required for coupling. The release of the platinum from the dendrimers, in the active form, was evaluated using 1 H NMR or inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS). An {{increase in the number of}} active cisplatin molecules released is observed with larger dendrimers, four from the G 3. 5 dendrimer to 59 from the G 6. 5 dendrimer, with the release efficiency increasing from 18 – 63 %. Diffusion ordered spectroscopy NMR was also used to determine the size of the dendrimer <b>platinate</b> complexes. The free dendrimers increased from 2. 72 to 5. 93 nm, cisplatin dendrimer platinates from 1. 66 to 4. 01 nm and oxaliplatin dendrimer platinates from 4. 03 to 14. 51. The dendrimer platinates and free dendrimers were tested in vitro against the A 2780 and A 2780 cis cancer cell lines and their activity compared to cisplatin. In all cases the dendrimer platinates showed reduced activity when compared to cisplatin whilst the free dendrimer showed no activity in vitro, IC 50 > 100 mM. The in vivo activity of the G 6. 5 dendrimer <b>platinate</b> was tested in nude mice bearing A 2780 xenografts and compared to cisplatin using a single dose of equivalent concentration and the G 6. 5 dendrimer <b>platinate</b> was shown to have a similar activity in vivo as cisplatin after 6 days. Similar dendrimer-platinate complexes were formed with the active component of oxaliplatin, {Pt(R,R-dach) } 2 +. The dendrimer-platinates were found to contain 12 - 63 platinum molecules per dendrimer, a reduction on the number observed for the complexes formed with the active component of cisplatin. The size of the oxaliplatin dendrimer-platinates was also determined to be greater than the cisplatin equivalent, most likely as a result of aggregation due to the hydrophobic nature of the dach ligand. The number of platinum groups released from the dendrimer is also lower than the equivalent cisplatin complexes with only 2 - 43 platinum moieties being released. The platinum was shown to be released from the dendrimer in an initial burst release within the first 2 hours, accounting for 85 % of the releasable platinum. The {Pt(R,R-dach) } 2 + dendrimer-platinates were shown to be more cytotoxic in vitro than the free {Pt(R,Rdach) } 2 + complex. In a further study a folic acid targeting group was also attached to the dendrimers to allow active targeting of cancer cells through the folate receptor. Folic acid was conjugated to 1, 6 -diamminohexane via an amide coupling reaction. The linker was then attached to the dendrimer through a further amide coupling reaction prior to the addition of the platinum complexes. The resulting complexes were found to contain 3 - 8 folate targeting groups depending on dendrimer size. The targeted cisplatin dendrimerplatinates were shown to be more cytotoxic than the non-targeted complexes however the opposite was observed for the {Pt(R,R-dach) } 2 + dendrimer-platinates. The uptake of platinum by the cells increased for the folate targeted cisplatin dendrimer-platinates but decreased for the {Pt(R,R-dach) } 2 + dendrimer-platinates.

The formation of one distinct <b>platinated</b> product, migrating at an apparent size of 2400 nt, was closely associated with ribozyme inactivation. This <b>platinated</b> RNA was resistant to T 1 ribonuclease digestion, suggesting the presence of inter-strand Pt cross-links.

The apparent KI for binding of cis-DDP to the ribozyme was 62 microM. Ribozyme treated with urea was not inactivated by cis-DDP, indicating that the native structure of the RNA is required for reaction with cis-DDP. Mg++, which binds to the ribozyme and causes conformational changes in the molecule, protected the ribozyme from inactivation by cis-DDP and also prevented the formation of <b>platinated</b> RNA.

40|$|HMGB 1, one of {{the most}} {{abundant}} nuclear proteins, has a strong binding affinity for cisplatin-modified DNA. It has been proposed that HMGB 1 enhances the anticancer efficacy of cisplatin by shielding <b>platinated</b> DNA lesions from repair. Two cysteine residues in HMGB 1 domain A form a reversible disulfide bond under mildly oxidizing conditions. The reduced domain A protein binds to a 25 -bp DNA probe containing a central 1, 2 -d(GpG) intrastrand cross-link, the major platinum−DNA adduct, with a 10 -fold greater binding affinity than the oxidized domain A. The binding affinities of singly and doubly mutated HMGB 1 domain A, respectively deficient in one or both cysteine residues that form the disulfide bond, are unaffected by changes in external redox conditions. The redox-dependent nature of the binding of HMGB 1 domain A to cisplatin-modified DNA suggests that formation of the intradomain disulfide bond induces a conformational change that disfavors binding to cisplatin-modified DNA. Hydroxyl radical footprinting analyses of wild-type domain A bound to <b>platinated</b> DNA under different redox conditions revealed identical cleavage patterns, implying that the asymmetric binding mode of the protein across from the <b>platinated</b> lesion is conserved irrespective of the redox state. The results of this study reveal that the cellular redox environment can influence the interaction of HMGB 1 with the <b>platinated</b> DNA and suggest that the redox state of the A domain is a potential factor in regulating the role of the protein in modulating the activity of cisplatin as an anticancer drug.

The persistent shape of the adamantyl-derivatized dendrimers and the dense shell of adamantyl-B-CD complexes provide a kinetic barrier for nanoparticle escape thus prolonging their lifetime.

40|$|Using {{electrophoresis}} and replication mapping, we {{show that}} the presence of DNA adducts of bifunctional antitumor cisplatin or monodentate [PtCl(dien) ]Cl (dien = diethylenetriamine) in the substrate DNA inhibits eukaryotic topoisomerase 1 (top 1) action, the adducts of cisplatin being more effective. The presence of camptothecin in the samples of <b>platinated</b> DNA markedly enhances effects of Pt–DNA adducts on top 1 activity. Interestingly, the effects of Pt–DNA adducts on the catalytic activity of top 1 in the presence of camptothecin differ depending on the sequence context. A multiple metallation of the short nucleotide sequences on the scissile strand, immediately downstream of the cleavage site impedes the cleavage by top 1. On the other hand, DNA cleavage by top 1 at some cleavage sites which were not <b>platinated</b> in their close proximity is notably enhanced as a consequence of global platination of DNA. We suggest that this enhancement of DNA cleavage by top 1 may consist in its inability to bind to other cleavage sites <b>platinated</b> in their close neighborhood; thus, more molecules of top 1 may become available for cleavage at the sites where top 1 normally cleaves and where platination does not interfere...|$|R

About 40 % diadducts were found after 10 -min postincubation at 23 °C, which dropped to some 14 % after 24 h at 37 °C; total platination was hardly affected. Postincubation of 'aged' <b>platinated</b> DNA reactive monoadducts) only showed the shower decrease. The rapid process is likely to represent monoadduct inactivation, preventing the formation of diadducts, whereas the slow reaction must he interpreted as diadduct-to-monoadduct conversion. Similar reactions, but less efficient than with thiourea, occurred during dialysis against NH 4 HCO 3 (0. 1 - 1 M). Pt-containing (di) nucleotides in digested DNA were hardly affected by thiourea.

The formation of 1, 2 -GG intrastrand cross-link of cisplatin leads to marked conformational alterations in DNA including a directional, rigid bend toward the major groove and local unwinding. These altered structures attract various cellular proteins. This phenomenon has been postulated to mediate antitumor properties of cisplatin.

The steady state thickness is then predicted to vary linearly with the applied potential and pH. These predictions are in good agreement with the experimental findings.

Die Kristallstruktur des K 2 [(CF 3) 2 F 2 Pt(µ-OD) 2 PtF 2 (CF 3) 2] × 2 D 2 O wurde durch Röntgenstrahlbeugung an einem Einkristall aufgeklärt. Fluorination of the cyanoplatinates [Pt(CN) 4] 2 - and [Pt(CN) 6] 2 - with ClF in {{anhydrous}} {{hydrofluoric acid}} has yielded platinates with two CF 3 groups, while in dichloromethane platinates containing {{up to six}} CF 3 groups have been obtained. In dichloromethane fluorination of the cyanoiridate [Bu 4 N] 3 [Ir(CN) 6] has formed iridates with up to four CF 3 groups. These new compounds were synthesized and they were characterized mainly by 195 Pt-, 19 F-, 1 H- und 15 N-NMR-spectroscopy. The trifluoromethylplatinates in the oxidation state +IV with more than three CF 3 groups and the trifluoromethyliridates in the oxidation state +III {{with more than one}} CF 3 group are the first of their kind. In the NMR spectra the increasing 2 J (195 Pt 19 F) coupling constants of the CF 3 groups trans to the ligands X are consistent with the expected trend through the decreasing trans -influences of the ligands X in the order: CF 3 - > CN - > Cl - > F - > OH -. Pure samples of K 2 [Pt(CN) (CF 3) 5], Cs 2 [Pt(CN) (CF 3) 5] and Cs 2 [Pt(CF 3) 6] also allowed recording of vibrational (Raman, IR) and mass (ESI) spectra. The decomposition points of K 2 [Pt(CN) (CF 3) 5] and Cs 2 [Pt(CN) (CF 3) 5] were obtained by DSC analysis. The crystal structure of K 2 [(CF 3) 2 F 2 Pt(µ-OD) 2 PtF 2 (CF 3) 2] × 2 D 2 O was determined by single crystal X-ray diffraction...|$|E
40|$|Cis-platinum causes {{profound}} gastrointestinal {{symptoms in}} patients and these may persist for many days after drug administration. Gut mucosal toxicity {{may be a}} factor in the pathogenesis of such prolonged nausea, vomiting and anorexia. The effects of cis-platinum on mouse ileal mucosal architecture, villus epithelial cell influx and disaccharidase activity are described in comparison with dhe effects of two platinum analogues, CBDCA and CHIP. In addition the effect of dexamethasone, a useful drug in the palliation of cis-platinum-induced emesis, in combination with cis-platinum is described. Cis-platinum, CBDCA and CHIP cause profound reduction in crypt cell production rate (CCPR) and thus villus epithelial cell influx within hours of administration leading to villus stunting and diminished function. CBDCA showed the least profound effect with early rebound in CCPR by day 3. Cis-platinum and CHIP were roughly equitoxic to ileal crypts with rebound in CCPR being delayed until day 7. Similarly, CBDCA caused least reduction in disaccharidase activity with cis-platinum and CHIP being equitoxic. The addition of dexamethasone had no protective effect on the effects of cis-platinum on murine ileal mucosa and mice given the combination chronically had no weight gain over 18 weeks, their weight paralleling those receiving cis-platinum alone. The <b>platinate</b> compounds have differing degrees of intestinal mucosal toxicity but no direct inference can be drawn in respect to the clinical situation where CBDCA causes less gastrointestinal symptomatology than CHIP but where both cause less than cis-platinum. Dexamethasone does not act by mucosal protection to provide its useful effects in prolonged cis-platinum-induced gastrointestinal symptoms...|$|E
40|$|The platform-independent {{software}} package {{consisting of the}} oligonucleotide mass assembler (OMA) and the oligonucleotide peak analyzer (OPA) was created to support the analysis of oligonucleotide mass spectra. It calculates all theoretically possible fragments of a given input sequence and annotates it to an experimental spectrum, thus, saving {{a large amount of}} manual processing time. The software performs analysis of precursor and product ion spectra of oligonucleotides and their analogues comprising user-defined modifications of the backbone, the nucleobases, or the sugar moiety, as well as adducts with metal ions or drugs. The ability to expand the library of building blocks and to implement individual structural variations makes it extremely useful for supporting the analysis of therapeutically active compounds. The functionality of the software tool is demonstrated on the examples of a <b>platinated</b> doublestranded oligonucleotide and a modified RNA sequence. Experiments also reveal the unique dissociation behavior of <b>platinated</b> higher-order DNA structures...|$|R

40|$|<b>Platinating</b> {{agents are}} used in the {{treatment}} of many cancers, yet they can induce toxicities and resistance that limit their utility. Using previously published and additional world population panels of diverse ancestry totaling 608 lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCLs), we performed meta-analyses of over 3 million SNPs for both carboplatin- and cisplatin-induced cytotoxicity. The most significant SNP in the carboplatin meta-analysis is located in an intron of NBAS (p = 5. 1 × 10 − 7). The most significant SNP in the cisplatin meta-analysis is upstream of KRT 16 P 2 (p = 5. 8 × 10 − 7). We also show that cisplatin-susceptibility SNPs are enriched for carboplatin-susceptibility SNPs. Most of the variants that associate with platinum-induced cytotoxicity are polymorphic across multiple world populations; therefore, they could be tested in follow-up studies in diverse clinical populations. Seven genes previously implicated in <b>platinating</b> agent response, including BCL 2, GSTM 1, GSTT 1, ERCC 2, and ERCC 6 were also implicated in our meta-analyses...|$|R

When MeSeCys was reacted with [Pt(Me 4 en) (D 2 O) 2] 2 +, we {{observed}} both stereoisomers of Se,N chelates, {{as well as}} [Pt(Me 4 en) (MeSeCys) Cl]+ from ­ 1 ­H NMR Spectroscopy; the latter formed due {{to the presence of}} Cl- in the solution. Both isomers of the chelate seemed to form proportionally to one another, not favoring a specific stereoisomer. Eventually the [Pt(Me 4 en) (MeSeCys) Cl]+ products became Se,N chelates. We incubated SeMet with NaCl for 30 minutes and then mixed with [Pt(Me 4 en) (D 2 O) 2] 2 +; we saw equal amounts of the [Pt(Me 4 en) (SeMet) Cl]+ isomers along with a specific stereoisomer of the Se,N chelate forming first (R chirality), then approximately two hours later the (S) chirality formed. Previously, Met and [Pt(Me 4 En(D 2 O) 2] 2 + have been studied by prior students and there were no chiralities favored in the reaction. There were S,N chelates formed, but no specific isomer favored over another. We obtained equal amounts of SeMet, Met and [Pt(Me 4 en) (D 2 O) 2] 2 + and mixed the solutions together to see which amino acid would <b>platinate</b> first, either SeMet or Met. The NMR spectra we observed showed that SeMet attached first to [Pt(Me 4 en) (D 2 O) 2] 2 +, with the (R) chelate forming first, then the (S) chelate.

40|$|Abstrak Waduk Pendidikan Diponegoro memiliki potensi sebagai air bersih, namun hingga saat ini belum ada instalasi pengolahan air waduk disekitarnya. Pengolahan air waduk saat ini masih menggunakan teknologi konvensional yang membutuhkan lahan besar. Sehingga perlu teknologi alternatif lain seperti teknologi membran. Teknologi membran memiliki banyak keunggulan seperti compact, modular dan mudah dioperasikan. Sayangnya, efisiensi kinerja membran dibatasi terjadinya fouling. Fouling adalah penumpukan kontaminan di permukaan membran yang dapat menghambat proses jalannya filtrasi. Pendekatan yang dapat dilakukan untuk minimasi fouling yaitu dengan penerapan pengolahan pendahuluan, seperti dengan teknologi ozon. Teknologi ozon dinilai mampu mengurangi bobot molekul, sehingga beban filtrasi membran terkurangi. Penelitian ini bertujuan untuk menganalisis kinerja teknologi ozon dan membran ultrafiltrasi dalam menyisihkan {{parameter}} Warna, Chemical Oxygen Demand (COD), Biological Oxygen Demand (BOD), Total Suspended Solid (TSS) serta Kekeruhan. Penelitian ini mengkaji pengaruh waktu kontak ozon (0, 5, 10, 15, 30) menit, perbedaan konsentrasi umpan dan perbedaan jenis air umpan. Potassium Hexachloro <b>Platinate</b> (K 2 PtCl 6) sebagai model zat warna, Aluminium Silikat Hidrat (Al 2 O 3. 2 SiO 4. 2 H 2 O) sebagai model padatan terlarut, dan Pottasium Hydrogen Pthtalate (C 8 H 5 KO 4) sebagai model zat organik.

Pada hasil pengujian variasi konsentrasi, umpan dengan konsentrasi terendah menunjukkan rejeksi tertinggi. Sedangkan, pada pengujian perbedaan jenis air, umpan air asli memberikan hasil penurunan fluks tertinggi dan rejeksi terendah. Hal ini menunjukkan terbentuknya cake layer pada permukaan membran.

40|$|Chemotherapy is the {{practice}} of treating cancer with antineoplastic drugs. In general, these drugs are highly toxic, and in many patients the side effects from therapy become so severe that treatment is stopped before full tumor remission has occurred. Further, chemotherapeutics usually have poor water solubility and very short circulation lifetimes, which {{makes it difficult to}} get a significant fraction of the injected dose to the tumor site. The use of polymers as delivery vehicles for drugs is a strategy for improving the efficacy and reducing the side effects of toxic cancer drugs. The design of an ideal polymeric system for drug delivery is a very active area of research and PEGylated dendrimers are among the most promising. Here we report the design, synthesis and biological evaluation of a biodegradable and versatile PEGylated dendrimer. We also report the preliminary results of a project involving hyaluronic acid functionalized liposomes. Chapter 1 is a brief overview of the background and history of polymers in drug delivery. The relevance of dendrimers is described in the context of other polymer delivery systems that have begun the transition into clinical development. Chapter 2 describes the synthesis and characterization of a PEGylated dendrimer that is biodegradable, robust, and has a nine step synthesis to drug loaded material. The polymer was functionalized with the drug, doxorubicin, and evaluated in mice. The in vivo chemotherapy experiment in Balb/c mice inoculated with murine C 26 colon carcinoma resulted in nine out of ten long fully cured mice. Chapter 3 describes the application of PEGylated dendrimers with platinum therapeutics. In order {{to increase the number of}} drug attachment sites on the dendrimer, the dendrimer core is used as a macroinitiator to carry out a ring-opening radial growth polymerization of the N-carboxy anhydride of glutamic acid. The terminal amines are then PEGylated and platinum chelators are attached to the glutamic acid side chains. Preliminary biological evaluation revealed that the polymer released platinum too quickly and therefore did not significantly improve the efficacy of the drug. This information was what inspired the research in chapter 4. Chapter 4 presents the synthesis and characterization of a small library of polymer bound platinum chelators. The chelators were loaded with diaminocyclohexane <b>platinate</b> (DACHPt). Differences in the ring size and ligand strength are examined in relation to drug release rate and cytotoxity. The most promising chelators were taken forward and evaluated in the C 26 colon carcinoma model alongside the clinical drug, cisplatin, as a positive control. Chapter 5 outlines an attempt to develop a new class of platinum (II) drugs that are specially tailored for polymeric drug delivery. A small library of heterocyclic diamine ligands functionalized with a ketone moiety was synthesized. The ligands were loaded with platinum (II) and the complexes were screened for their in vitro toxicity. The complexes with high potency were attached to polymers via a hydrazone bond and evaluated in vivo. Chapter 6 outlines a new synthetic approach toward hyaluronic acid (HA) functionalized liposomes. HA, a naturally occurring polysaccharide is specific ligand for the CD 44 receptor which is overexpressed on a number of cancer cell types. Using oxime chemistry, lipid molecules were attached to various lengths of HA oligomers at their reducing ends. The glycolipids were then incorporated into fluorescently labeled liposomes. The cells preferentially internalized the HA-targeted liposomes and did not internalize non-targeted control liposomes...|$|E
40|$|Cisplatin (CDDP) {{can form}} interprotein cross-links, {{leading to the}} {{formation}} of <b>platinated</b> oligomers. A dimer, a trimer and higher oligomers of bovine pancreatic ribonuclease (RNase A) obtained upon reaction with CDDP in 1 : 10 protein to metal ratio at 37 °C have been previously characterized. Here, we verify the ability of carboplatin and oxaliplatin to induce RNase A oligomerization under the same experimental conditions. The amount of formed RNase A oligomers was compared with that obtained in the reaction of the protein with CDDP. Among the three anticancer agents, CDDP is the most reactive and the most effective in inhibiting the ribonucleolytic activity of the protein. Oxaliplatin is the least potent oligomerization agent. Biophysical characterizations of structure and stability of <b>platinated</b> dimers formed in the presence of carboplatin and oxaliplatin suggest that they have a similar thermal stability and are more prone to dissociation than the corresponding dimer obtained with CDDP. Oligomers obtained in the presence of carboplatin are the most active. X-ray structures of the monomeric adducts that RNase A forms with the three drugs provide a rational basis to explain the different effects of the three anticancer agents on enzymatic activity and protein aggregation. Although <b>platinated</b> oligomers of RNase A formed upon reaction with CDDP, carboplatin and oxaliplatin retain a residual ribonuclease activity, they do not show cytotoxic action, suggesting that protein aggregation processes induced by Pt-based drugs can represent a collateral drawback, which affects the functional state of protein targets and reduces the efficacy of Pt-based drug treatment...|$|R
40|$|Cisplatin, cis-diamminedichlorido-platinum(II), is an {{important}} therapeutic tool {{in the struggle against}} different tumors, yet it is plagued with the emergence of resistance mechanisms after repeated administrations. This hampers greatly its efficacy. Overcoming resistance problems requires first and foremost an integrated and systematic understanding of the structural determinants and molecular recognition processes involving the drug and its cellular targets. Here we review a strategy that we have followed for the last few years, based on the combination of modern tools from computational chemistry with experimental biophysical methods. Using hybrid Quantum Mechanics/Molecular Mechanics (QM/MM) simulations, validated by spectroscopic experiments (including NMR, and CD), we have worked {{out for the first time}} at atomic level the structural determinants in solution of <b>platinated</b> cellular substrates. These include the copper homeostasis proteins Ctr 1, Atox 1, and ATP 7 A. All of these proteins have been suggested to influence the pre-target resistance mechanisms. Furthermore, coupling hybrid QM/MM simulations with classical Molecular Dynamics (MD) and free energy calculations, based on force field parameters refined by the so-called “Force Matching” procedure, we have characterized the structural modifications and the free energy landscape associated with the recognition between <b>platinated</b> DNA and the protein HMGB 1, belonging to the chromosomal high-mobility group proteins HMGB that inhibit the repair of <b>platinated</b> DNA. This may alleviate issues relative to on-target resistance process. The elucidation of the mechanisms by which tumors are sensitive or refractory to cisplatin may lead to the discovery of prognostic biomarkers. The approach reviewed here could be straightforwardly extended to other metal-based drugs...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{deals with}} two ways for {{optimising}} the pharmacological {{properties of the}} cytostatic platinum lead compound m- 4 F-Pt-Cl 2. The first attempt {{was the use of}} the m- 4 F neutral ligand for the building of polynuclear alkylamin platinum complexes. Till now their pharmacology was rudimentally elucidated. In this work the cellular uptake by endocytosis after adsorption at the cellular membrane could be shown. The main uptake path was the macropinocytosis, an endocytotic path activated more rarely and shortly in normal tissue than in cancer cells. The determination of platinum in the nuclei and DNA showed the escape from the endocytotic route. The amount of platinum drug available for cellular uptake was reduced by a pronounced protein binding. Hence 10 µM compound caused no antiproliferative effect at MCF- 7 cancer cells when incubated in serum containing medium. In contrast there was a lasting (< 200 h) inhibition of nearly 50 % when the cells were exposed to the same concentration of compound in serum free medium for 6 h. After coordination of platinum to chelating surface groups the resulting dendrimers showed a higher cellular accumulation with respect to the non <b>platinated</b> dendrimers. At least small platinum-dendrimer-conjugates were able to escape from the endocytotic route, so that they were taken up in the nucleus and bound to DNA. The integrity of these complexes were shown by the use of fluorescence labelled <b>platinated</b> dendrimers. The cellular content of platinum and fluorophor did not differ significantly. These compounds in a concentration of 5 µM caused up to 50 % inhibition of cellular growth of MCF- 7 cells. A distinct stronger antiproliferative effect was observed for the lead compound (m- 4 F-Pt-H 2 O-SO 4) bound to dendrimers at dicarboxylic acids. The release of the drug was shown by fluorescence marked dendrimer <b>platinates.</b> For this compound the cellular platinum and fluorophor content was decoupled. The discerning parameter for potency of dendrimer <b>platinates</b> was the binding behavior to serum albumins. Compared to antiproliferative active compounds the inactive compounds showed stronger accumulation in cells and higher amounts of DNA bound platinum. But those compounds were strongly bound to HSA. So only a small amount (< 5 %) was recovered and therefore available for cellular uptake...|$|R
