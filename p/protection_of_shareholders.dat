It focuses mainly on the matters contained in Section 196 a of the Commercial Code, Section 193 (2) of the Commercial Code, and on the issue of financial assistance. In addition, this dissertation deals with the legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> under the Business Corporations Act which is to take effect on 1 January 2014, and provides a brief outline of how these matters are regulated under certain foreign laws. As well, it provides a comparison with the legal regulations of the European Union. This dissertation is comprised of three sections, each having several parts. The parts are further divided into articles. Section 1 analyses the statutory provisions on the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> as given in the Commercial Code, and is divided into four parts. The introduction, given in Part I, focuses on the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> under the Commercial Code in the general sense. The remaining three parts concentrate on the above said selected statutory provisions. In each of those three parts, I attempt to discuss the key purpose of the provisions, describe how they developed including respective amendment (novelizations) of the Commercial Code and, in this context, [...] ...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{joins the}} {{literature}} examining connections between legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> and finance. Driven {{by the need}} to attract funds a manager tries to reduce agency costs by selling a fraction of equity to a large investor (the outside blockholder). Monitoring by the blockholder can serve as a commitment device limiting inefficient private benefits extraction. However, the threat of collusion between the blockholder and the manager hampers raising funds from dispersed shareholders. We examine how the manager’s choice of the ownership structure is affected by the legal <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders.</b> Our main finding is that, contrary to the widespread view, there can be a U-shape dependence of the outside ownership concentration on the quality of shareholder protection. At the same time our result on the total ownership concentration is consistent with recent research.

40|$|One of the {{features}} of takeover law is the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> minority <b>shareholders.</b> This article examines the extent at which the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> minority <b>shareholders</b> is an objective of EU law, comparing certain provisions in the Takeover Directive with their equivalent in English law. The arguments advanced in this article are threefold. First, English law offers better protection to minority shareholders than accorded under EU law. Second, that the protection accorded to minority shareholders under EU law is only incidental to the objective of facilitating the restructuring of companies. Third, that in seeking to achieve a restructuring of companies objective, both EU law and English law on takeovers trumps property rights <b>of</b> minority <b>shareholders.</b> The article draws a conclusion that the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> minority <b>shareholder</b> in takeovers is about market fairness and not legal rights...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the Proposal for a Council Regulation on the Statute for a European Private Company (Societas Privata Europaea, SPE) as put forward by the European Commission in 2008 {{as well as with}} the {{amendments}} proposed by the European Parliament in 2009. The SPE will be a new legal form for small and medium-sized companies, allowing them to set up the same European legal entity across the Member States. In this paper the focus is on the question whether we need the SPE and whether the SPE Proposal provides for adequate protection for shareholders and creditors. It will be concluded that due to the uncertainty about the role of the applicable national law, the form and shape of the SPE remains too vague for a positive answer to the question whether we need the SPE. With regard to the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> and creditors the conclusion will be that because of the lack of a general buy-out remedy in the proposed Regulation, the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> does not deserve the designation ‘adequate’...|$|E

The dominant formal institution-based view of corporate governance suggests that legal rules and regulations are crucial for the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> rights. While this perspective has significantly advances our understanding of international corporate governance, we suggest that more attention to informal institutions may complement the formal approach. First, we utilize social identity theory {{to shed light on}} the formation <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> coalitions. Second, we draw on research involving informal institutions such as culture and trust to better understand PP conflicts. Overall, we extend the growing literature on PP conflicts by an explicit focus on informal institutions...|$|R

40|$|It {{has been}} argued that the legal {{environment}} for the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> minority <b>shareholders</b> is important in determining the strength of a country’s capital markets. In China, the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> minority <b>shareholders</b> is officially regarded as a major regulatory objective, especially as regards Chinese stock exchange listed companies. In practice, the position of minority share­holders in these companies is not well protected, suggesting that economic development and investment in listed companies do not fit neatly with expectations created by leading law and development theorists. This article reports on findings from an empirically based study of corporate governance in China’s top 100 listed companies that examined a broad range of corporate governance issues, including the problem <b>of</b> minority <b>shareholder</b> <b>protection.</b> Major challenges to achieving better protection for minority shareholders in large Chinese companies emerged from this research. ...|$|R

Our hypotheses {{stress the importance of}} institutional and legal factors in explaining cross-country variations. We find that increased <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> and greater accounting transparency contribute negatively to variations in underpricing. When more information is available price discovery is facilitated, allowing for more effective corporate governance. Moreover, when equity markets perform well, investors anticipate companies and investment banks to time the market and require higher underpricing in return. Overall, we conclude that better investor protection and better institutional environments reduce the perceived risk of investing, and attenuate the problem of asymmetric information, thereby causing lower underpricing across countries.

40|$|This paper, after {{reviewing}} the mechanisms for the direct and indirect <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> minority <b>shareholders</b> in the US, France, Germany and the UK, assesses these machanisms in light of a "subjective" aspect <b>of</b> minority <b>shareholders</b> <b>protection</b> (<b>protection</b> <b>of</b> weaker <b>shareholders</b> vs. stronger shareholders and/or management) and in light of an "objective" aspect <b>of</b> minority <b>shareholders</b> <b>protection</b> (conditions for the long-term success of the company) that can both be extrapolated from the OECD Principles.

40|$|Several {{studies have}} {{proposed}} that corporate governance has {{a positive effect on}} anti-corruption. The paper further investigates the effects of corporate governance on the corruption-economic growth relationship at the national level.

Using a balanced panel data set of 55 countries (26 developed countries and 29 emerging countries) between 2003 and 2011, the results show that corporate governance weakens the relationship between corruption and economic growth. More specifically, for developed countries, the efficacy of corporate boards, strength of auditing and financial reporting standards, and the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> minority <b>shareholder’s</b> interest help mitigate the negative impacts of corruption on economic growth.

40|$|This {{research}} investigated {{whether the}} corporate governance mechanisms, according to Agency Theory, {{can take on}} distinct amounts of significance in different economic cycles. The period studied was 2000 - 2009, segmenting it into: local crises (2000 - 2002), no crisis (2003 - 2007), and global crisis (2008 - 2009). The governance mechanisms studied were: ownership structure, board of directors, compensation to managers, transparency and protection of minority shareholders. The methodology involved: (a) principal component analysis, aggregating in an indicator a set of governance variables; (b) reorganization of components to verify the contribution of each governance dimensions in the index.

40|$|This paper investigates empirically {{the effects}} of {{institutions}} and market characteristics on corporate capital structure dynamics. Based {{on the fact that}} firms may temporarily deviate from their optimal capital structure due to the existence of adjustment costs, a partial adjustment model is used that links these transaction costs to country-specific characteristics such as the development of the financial markets, legal system, and macroeconomic environment. The sample comprises data from 873 firms in France, Germany, Italy and the UK over the period from 1982 to 2002. The results support the hypotheses that more developed financial markets, greater efficiency of the legal system and better <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> all {{have a positive effect on}} the speed at which firms adjust their capital structure towards the target. Similarly, higher economic growth and a higher inflation rate positively affect the speed of adjustment to the optimal capital structure as well.

40|$|The stakeholder-oriented {{nature of}} EU company law can be {{observed}} in the case of public or private limited liability companies. In the case of the former, <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholders</b> also comes in the forefront and it can be found through the information model legislation, demanding all relevant information to be presented to the shareholders, on the basis of which the shareholders take on the responsibility for their decisions. This shift of responsibility for protection from legislative provisions in the hands of company law actors can be also observed in the case of provisions addressed to creditors, albeit in limited form. The interplay of the two legislative approaches- information based Anglo-American approach and (minimum) harmonization Continental approach can be seen throughout the body of EU company law, including CJEU case law, but the use of one or another does not always depend on the EU legislative policy.

40|$|This article aims at {{introducing}} the main changes {{brought by the}} new Albanian Company Law on minority shareholders’ protection. Due to the harmonization of our legislation with the acqui, new pieces of laws were introduced in commercial law. In 2008 the new law “On entrepreneurs and commercial companies” was enacted.

They believed they could show that the <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>shareholder</b> rights correlated with, and probably caused, more efficient market economies. They also argued that, according to their legal origins theory, common law systems were better at protecting shareholder rights than civil law jurisdictions, on the whole. With other people involved later, these studies were extended to labour law, and constitutional law protections for property, and other issues which concerned the researchers.|$|R
