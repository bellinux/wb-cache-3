50|$|Bacterioplankton {{occupy a}} range of {{ecological}} niches in marine and aquatic ecosystems. They are both primary producers and primary consumers in these ecosystems and drive global biogeochemical cycling of elements essential for life (e.g., carbon and nitrogen fixation). Many are saprotrophic, and obtain energy by consuming organic material produced by other organisms. This material may be dissolved in the medium and taken directly from there, or bacteria may live and grow in association with particulate material such as marine snow. Many other bacterioplankton species are autotrophic, and derive energy from either photosynthesis or chemosynthesis. The latter are often categorised as <b>picophytoplankton,</b> and include cyanobacterial groups such as Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus. Bacterioplankton play critical roles in global nitrogen fixation, nitrification, denitrification, remineralisation and methanogenesis.|$|E
50|$|As mentioned, the prasinovirus MpV-SP1 infects Micromonas pusilla {{which is}} a major {{component}} of the <b>picophytoplankton</b> of the world’s oceans. M. pusilla lives from tropical to polar marine ecosystems. Cottrell & Suttle (1995) found that 2-10% of the M. pusilla population in an inshore environment was lysed per day, with an average of 4.4%. Higher estimates have been given by Evans et al. (2003), who suggest that M. pusilla viruses can lyse up to 25% of the Micromonas population per day. This suggests that viruses are responsible for a moderate amount of mortality in M. pusilla populations. On a larger scale, viral infection of M. pusilla is responsible for nutrient and energy recycling in aquatic food webs, which is yet to be quantified.|$|E
50|$|A {{commonly}} studied prasinovirus, OtV5, as mentioned, infects {{the smallest}} currently known eukaryote, Ostreococcus tauri. O. tauri is about 0.8 micrometers {{in diameter and}} is within the picosize fraction (0.2-2 micrometers). Picoeukaryotes, such as Ostreococcus tauri are widely distributed and contribute significantly to microbial biomass and total primary productivity. In oligotrophic environments, marine <b>picophytoplankton</b> account for up to 90% of the autotrophic biomass and thus are an important food source for nanoplanktonic and phagotrophic protists. As picoeukaryotes serve as the base for marine microbial food webs, they are intrinsic {{to the survival of}} higher trophic levels. Ostreococcus tauri has a rapid growth rate and dense blooms have been observed off the coasts of Long Island and California. Samples collected from Long Island bay were found to contain many virus-like particles, a likely cause for the decline of the bloom. Despite the large abundances of picoeukaryotes, these unicellular organisms are outnumbered by viruses by about ten to one. Viruses such as OtV5, play important roles in regulating phytoplankton populations, and through lysis of cells contribute to the recycling of nutrients back towards other microorganisms, otherwise known as the viral shunt.|$|E
40|$|<b>Picophytoplankton</b> were {{inferior}} competitors for inorganic phosphorus {{compared to}} heterotrophic bacteria. This {{may be due}} to the source of energy available for the heterotrophs, while cell-size was of minor importance. However, <b>picophytoplankton</b> were superior to large phytoplankton in the competition for nutrients at low concentrations. Biomass of <b>picophytoplankton</b> was low in brownwater lakes and high in clearwater lakes, compared to the biomass of heterotrophic bacteria. The results suggest that <b>picophytoplankton</b> are inferior to heterotrophic bacteria in the competition for inorganic nutrients in brownwater lakes, where the production of heterotrophic bacteria is subsidized by humic dissolved organic carbon (DOC) Relative to large phytoplankton, <b>picophytoplankton</b> were most important in lakes with intermediate water colour, despite the fact that the lowest nutrient concentrations were found in the clearwater lakes. Large phytoplankton in the clearwater lakes may be able to overcome nutrient competition with <b>picophytoplankton</b> by vertical migration. In conclusion, changes in nutrient content, light availability and concentrations of DOC affect the interactions of heterotrophic bacteria, <b>picophytoplankton</b> and large phytoplankton and are therefore important factors for the structure of the food web in the pelagic zones of lakes. <b>Picophytoplankton</b> (planktonic algae and cyanobacteria, < 2 µm) constitute an important component of pelagic food webs. They are linked to larger phytoplankton and heterotrophic bacteria through complex interactions including competition, commensalism and predation.

Eukaryotic cells numerically predominated in the <b>picophytoplankton</b> commu-nity throughout the study period. Their contribution to total <b>picophytoplankton</b> varied between 73 % and 88 % in abundance and 58 % to 89 % in biomass. Numbers of <b>picophytoplankton</b> cells were usually lower at the outlet than at the inlet of the reservoir. The mean difference was 2. 1 × 104 cells·ml- 1, i. e. 14 % of the value at the inlet, and the number of picoeukaryotes decreased on average by 16 %, while picocyanobacteria by 6 %.

40|$|Highlights: • <b>Picophytoplankton</b> {{was able}} to grow under {{a wide range of}} {{environmental}} conditions varying seasonally. • <b>Picophytoplankton</b> variability was more marked in the bay than in the lagoon. • <b>Picophytoplankton</b> decreased in the lagoon under enhanced anthropogenic stress. • Synechococcus, the most abundant group of the community, was frequently present in both ecosystems during the monitoring. We investigated at the single cell level during 16 months (June 2012 to September 2013) the temporal distribution of <b>picophytoplankton</b> (picoeukaryotes, Synechococcus and Prochlorococcus) communities in two contrasted ecosystems: the Bay of Bizerte characterised by an oligotrophic regime typical of the Mediterranean Sea and the Bizerte Lagoon that exhibits a mesotrophic/eutrophic state. We aimed at depicting seasonal variations and quantifying the relationships between the environmental factors and the structure and abundance of <b>picophytoplankton</b> communities. Results showed that <b>picophytoplankton</b> groups were able to grow under a wide range of environmental conditions varying seasonally, although their abundances and contributions to the total chlorophyll biomass significantly varied and showed importance in the Bay of Bizerte. Synechococcus was the most abundant group reaching 225 * 103 cells·cm- 3 in the Bay and 278 * 103 cells·cm- 3 in the lagoon. This group was present all over the year in both ecosystems. Structural equation model results pointed out a different configuration regarding the <b>picophytoplankton</b> environmental drivers. The complexity of the configuration, i. e. number of significant links within the system, decreased under enhanced eutrophication conditions. The less exposure to anthropogenic stress, i. e. in the Bay of Bizerte, highlight a larger role of nutrient and hydrological conditions on the seasonal variations of <b>picophytoplankton,</b> whereas a negative effect of eutrophication on <b>picophytoplankton</b> communities was unveiled in the Bizerte Lagoon. We stress that such influence may be exacerbated under expected scenarios of Mediterranean warming conditions and nutrient release in coastal ecosystems...|$|E
40|$|The {{dynamics}} of <b>picophytoplankton</b> communities in marine environment is studied by astochastic reaction-dìffusìon-taxis model, analyzing the time {{evolution of the}} biomass concentration along a water column. The model is based on two stochastic differentìal equations, where the random fluctuations of the environmental variables are considered by inserting two multiplicative noise terms. Specifically, the model describes the {{dynamics of}} diffusion of <b>picophytoplankton</b> biomass and nutrient concentrations. In the proposed model the marine environment is characterized by poorly mixed waters and <b>picophytoplankton</b> is subject to intraspecific competition for light and nutrients. By numerically solving the system equations, we obtain the spatio-temporal dynamics of phytoplankton bìomass, nutrients and light along the water column at different depths. The {{results indicate that the}} distributions of the <b>picophytoplankton</b> biomass concentration along the water column are characterized by a peak, The comparison with experimental data show that height and localization of these peaks are in a good agreement with experimental maxima obtained from data collected in a real marine ecosystem.

PE-rich Pcy was the dominant population but showed a reduction with eutrophication, and therefore the community structure of <b>picophytoplankton</b> transformed from dominant PE-rich Pcy to dominant PE-rich Pcy and PC-rich Pcy, which suggested they are excellent indicators for the change of trophic state. <b>Picophytoplankton</b> community structure also presented a seasonal variation, indicating the different response of each <b>picophytoplankton</b> group to water temperature...|$|E

We found that based on the laboratory data, the optimal temperatures for <b>picophytoplankton</b> growth were not significantly different from those of other phytoplankton after controlling the effect of environmental mean temperature; however, the activation energies of <b>picophytoplankton</b> were marginally significantly higher than those of larger phytoplankton. From the field data, the growth rates of Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes in creased with increasing temperature and nitrate and chl a concentrations, whereas the growth rates of Prochlorococcus were not dependent on temperature and decreased with light intensity and nitrate concentrations.

40|$|Photoacclimation of <b>picophytoplankton</b> was {{studied in}} the mixed layer of 3 {{stations}} in the central Cantabrian Sea (southern Bay of Biscay). <b>Picophytoplankton</b> chl a:carbon ratios (θ) presented minimum values during summer, when irradiance, temperature, and biomass of prokaryotes reached maximum values and inorganic nutrient concentrations were low. Conversely, the maximum θ were reached during winter, coincident with lowest annual irradiance but maximum concentration of inorganic nutrients and higher relative biomass of eukaryotes. Changes in θ were modeled using irradiance as an independent variable. Exponentially decreasing functions of θ with irradiance were significant only when the mean temperatures in the mixed layer were above 14 °C. These functions presented light-saturated minimum ratios (θmin) that decreased linearly with temperature and low-light maximum ratios (θmax) that increased exponentially with temperature. Such relationships were used to establish an empirical model that reproduced the seasonality of <b>picophytoplankton</b> θ in the mixed layer, with minima in summer and maxima in winter.

40|$|The {{observation}} that {{the relative importance of}} <b>picophytoplankton</b> is greatest in warm and nutrient-poor waters was tested here based on a comprehensive review of the data available in the literature from oceanic and coastal estuarine areas. Results show that <b>picophytoplankton</b> dominate (≥ 50 %) the biomass and production in oligotrophic (chlorophyll a [Chl a] 26 °C) waters, but represent 5 mg m- 3) and cold (< 3 °C) waters. There is, however, a strong covariation between temperature and nutrient concentration (r = - 0. 95, P < 0. 001), but the number of observations where both temperature and nutrient concentrations are available is too small to allow attempts to statistically separate their effects. The results of mesocosm nutrient addition experiments during summer in the Mediterranean Sea allowed the dissociation of the effects of temperature from those of nutrients on <b>picophytoplankton</b> production and biomass and validated the magnitude at which picoplankton dominates (≥ 50 %) autotrophic biomass and production obtained in the comparative analysis. The fraction contributed by picoplankton significantly declined (r 2 = 0. 76 and 0. 90, respectively, P < 0. 001) as total autotrophic production and biomass increased. These results support the increasing importance of <b>picophytoplankton</b> in warm, oligotrophic waters. The reduced contribution of <b>picophytoplankton</b> in warm productive waters is hypothesized here to be due to increased loss rates, whereas the dominance of <b>picophytoplankton</b> in warm, oligotrophic waters is attributable to the differential capacity to use nutrients as a function of differences in size and capacity of intrinsic growth of <b>picophytoplankton</b> and larger phytoplankton cells.

40|$|It is {{expected}} that climate change will expand the open oligotrophic oceans by enhanced thermal stratification. Because temperature defines the geographic distribution of <b>picophytoplankton</b> in open-ocean ecosystems and regulates photophysiological responses, {{it is important to}} understand how temperature affects <b>picophytoplankton</b> growth and photophysiology. Two prokaryotic and 2 eukaryotic <b>picophytoplankton</b> strains were acclimated to 3 different temperatures, ranging from 16 to 24 degrees C. Temperature-dependent growth and photophysiology were assessed by measurements of specific growth rates, cell size, pigment composition, absorption and electron transport rates. Growth of Prochlorococcus marinus (eMED 4), Prochlorococcus sp. (eMIT 9313), Ostreococcus sp. (clade B) and Pelagomonas calceolata was positively related to temperature, especially in the prokaryotic strains. Changes in photophysiology included increased light harvesting, increased electron transport and reduced photoinhibition at elevated temperatures. However, the changes related to light harvesting and electron transport could not fully explain the observed difference in growth. This suggests that other processes, such as Calvin cycle activity, are likely to limit growth at sub-optimal temperatures in these <b>picophytoplankton</b> strains. The overall changes in photophysiology during temperature acclimation will possibly allow photosynthesis at higher irradiance intensities, but the genetically defined low temperature tolerances and photosynthetic characteristics of the different ecotypes will likely be more important in determining <b>picophytoplankton</b> (depth) distribution and community composition...|$|E

Local physical events observed included downwelling and dense waters outflowing from a nearby gulf in winter-early spring 2008, upwelling in summer and early spring 2008 and eddy formation in January 2009. Each population responded differently to these events, which resulted in up to four orders of magnitude changes in their abundances.

Development of the spring assemblage (autotrophic <b>picophytoplankton</b> and centric diatoms) starts in February-March and is terminated by the onset of stratification when diatoms sink to the hypolimnion. <b>Picophytoplankton,</b> especially Synechococcus sp., assembles in a narrow deep-layer maximum in the upper hypolimnion. Our data show that neither deep circulations nor decreased incident radiation under winter ice and snow cover prevent the development of some specially adapted low-light - high-nutrient species. Our views about the length of vegetation period for phytoplankton need to be revised with respect to winter and isothermal conditions...|$|E
40|$|Size-fractionated {{phytoplankton}} biomass, primary productivity, photosynthetic dissolved {{organic carbon}} (PDOC), vertical distribution of pico-, nano-, and microphytoplankton, and the relationship with bacteria were studied in the Taiwan Strait during 2 cruises conducted in August 1994 and February-March 1995. Nanophytoplankton (3 to 20 mu m) dominated the community in the northern Taiwan Strait (NTS) while <b>picophytoplankton</b> (0. 2 to 3 mu m) dominated in the southern Taiwan Strait (STS). Nanophytoplankton accounted for 60 and 57 % of biomass, and 77 and 36 % of productivity in summer and winter in the NTS, respectively. <b>Picophytoplankton</b> contributed to 54 and 63 % of biomass, and 85 and 48 % of productivity in summer and winter in the STS, respectively. The vertical distribution pattern in the Taiwan Strait consisted of microphytoplankton (20 to 200 mu m) mainly at the surface, nanophytoplankton {{in the middle and}} <b>picophytoplankton</b> {{at the bottom of the}} euphotic zone. Regression analysis indicated that bacterial abundance and biomass were positively significantly correlated with phytoplankton biomass and productivity, respectively, implying that the phytoplankton was an important organic carbon source for supporting bacterial growth. All the results suggested that the microbial loop played an important role in carbon cycling in the study areas, especially in the STS. The factors controlling the size structure, PDOC and vertical distribution of <b>picophytoplankton</b> are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Four surveys (Jun’ 06 and Nov’ 06; Feb’ 07 and May’ 07) {{were carried}} out on the northeastern shelf of the Gulf of Cádiz (southwest Iberian Peninsula) to relate the spatio-temporal {{distribution}} of the carbon cycle parameters (dissolved inorganic carbon and dissolved organic carbon) to <b>picophytoplankton</b> biomass and community composition. In addition, the net ecosystem production and the <b>picophytoplankton</b> contribution to the air-sea CO 2 exchange process were investigated. The results showed that chlorophyll-a, carbon cycle parameters and <b>picophytoplankton</b> composition showed large seasonality, and the Guadalquivir Estuary {{plays an important role}} in the contribution of nutrient and suspended particular material over the year. Regarding <b>picophytoplankton</b> composition, the flow cytometry analysis demonstrated that Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus were the main populations in the studied area and their temporal and spatial distributions were complementary: the Prochlorococcus population showed its maximum concentration in May’ 07 and Jun’ 06 and in the surface oceanic water, whereas the Synechococcus population was at its maximum during Feb’ 07 and Nov’ 06, and off the Guadalquivir Estuary and Bay of Cádiz. In addition, a relationship between the studied parameters and the fugacity of CO 2 was also observed, suggesting that primary production is an important factor in the regulation of this parameter in the studied area. The calculated carbon budget showed that the area acts as a carbon sink on an annual basis...|$|E
40|$|The {{effective}} {{transportation of}} <b>picophytoplankton</b> to the mesopelagic layer {{in the ocean}} by cell aggregation and attachment to large particles has been reported. Those findings suggest that <b>picophytoplankton</b> play important roles in ecological processes in the deep ocean. However, there is no information about vertical transportation of <b>picophytoplankton</b> cells from the epilimnion in lakes, though the presence of <b>picophytoplankton</b> cells in the hypolimnion has been reported. The present study demonstrated the possible importance of Synechococcus (Cyanobacteria) in ecological processes of the hypolimnion in the deep mesotrophic Lake Biwa, Japan. The chlorophyll a concentration in the 0. 2 - 2. 0 -µm fraction, which is mainly derived from Synechococcus, accounted for a large portion (up to 28. 8 %) of the total chlorophyll a concentration in the hypolimnion during the thermal stratification period. We found a significant positive correlation between Synechococcus abundances in the epilimnion and hypolimnion during the stratification period. In addition, our incubation experiment revealed that Synechococcus did not show significant growth during the first 2 d in dark conditions. These results suggest the recent delivery of a significant fraction of Synechococcus cells from the epilimnion to the hypolimnion. Our {{results indicate that the}} abundance of Synechococcus makes a greater contribution to ecological processes in the hypolimnion of Lake Biwa than previously hypothesized, and this may also be the case for other deep lakes...|$|E

40|$|The {{observation}} that {{the relative importance of}} <b>picophytoplankton</b> is greatest in warm and nutrient-poor waters was tested here based on a comprehensive review of the data available in the literature from oceanic and coastal estuarine areas. Results show that <b>picophytoplankton</b> dominate ($ 50 %) the biomass and production in oligotrophic (chlorophyll a [Chl a], 0. 3 mg m 23), nutrient poor (NO 3 1 NO 2, 1 mM), and warm (. 268 C) waters, but represent, 10 % of autotrophic biomass and production in rich (Chl a. 5 mg m 23) and cold (, 38 C) waters. There is, however, a strong covariation between temperature and nutrient concentration (r 5 20. 95, P, 0. 001), but the number of observations where both temperature and nutrient concentrations are available is too small to allow attempts to statistically separate their effects. The results of mesocosm nutrient addition experiments during summer in the Mediterranean Sea allowed the dissociation of the effects of temperature from those of nutrients on pico-phytoplankton production and biomass and validated the magnitude at which picoplankton dominates ($ 50 %) autotrophic biomass and production obtained in the comparative analysis. The fraction contributed by picoplankton significantly declined (r 2 5 0. 76 and 0. 90, respectively, P, 0. 001) as total autotrophic production and biomass increased. These results support the increasing importance of <b>picophytoplankton</b> in warm, oligotrophic waters. The reduced contribution of <b>picophytoplankton</b> in warm productive waters is hypothesized here to be due to increase...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, {{by using}} a {{stochastic}} reaction-diffusion-taxis model, we analyze the <b>picophytoplankton</b> dynamics in the basin of the Mediterranean Sea, characterized by poorly mixed waters.

The multiplicative noise sources present in the model account for random fluctuations of environmental variables. Phytoplankton distributions obtained from the model show a good agreement with experimental data sampled in two different sites of the Sicily Channel.

40|$|Plankton {{samples were}} {{collected}} from 10 depths at 25 stations spaced at intervals of about 4 ° of latitude along a transect from the British Isles to the Falkland Islands. Four categories of picoplankton were discriminated: Synechococcus spp., Prochlorococcus spp., eukaryotic <b>picophytoplankton</b> and heterotrophic bacteria. The populations in each category in the samples were counted by flow cytometry and the mean size of bacterial cells was determined by fractionation through filters. Categories of phototrophic cells were discriminated by size and by the fluorescence of photosynthetic pigments; samples stained with the fluorochrome TOTO were used to enumerate heterotrophic bacteria (and Prochlorococcus in surface waters where their chlorophyll content was very small). The carbon biomass concentration of each category in each sample was calculated. Prochlorococcus was present at all stations between 47 °N and 38 °S, and reached peak population densities above 200, 000 cells ml- 1 in equatorial waters; the depth occupied by these cells increased in oligotrophic waters, where they dominated <b>picophytoplankton</b> biomass. Synechococcus reached high concentrations in the Mauritanian upwelling region and in the frontal region near {{the southern end of}} the transect, where they represented the largest single component of <b>picophytoplankton</b> biomass, but was almost absent in oligotrophic regions. Picoeukaryotes were present in low numbers at all latitudes, but they are larger cells and constituted a substantial part of the total <b>picophytoplankton</b> biomass at most latitudes. The depth-integrated (200 m) biomass of heterotrophic bacteria was nearly as great as that of the <b>picophytoplankton</b> at all latitudes, because substantial numbers of cells occurred at all depths. Numbers and biomass of these bacteria were maximal in the upwelling region and high at both ends of the transect. There was a clear contrast in the composition of the picoplankton community in both the North and South Atlantic between mesotrophic waters where Synechococcus and picoeukaryotes dominated the biomass, and oligotrophic waters where the smaller total biomass was dominated by Prochlorococcus. ...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{influence}} of upwelling {{events on the}} structure of <b>picophytoplankton</b> communities was assessed at the annual scale from a station within the South Australian shelf region. In this region, local (wind) and global (La Niña/El Niño-Southern Oscillation) hydroclimatic conditions affect the development of upwelling over the austral summer. Using flow cytometry, changes in <b>picophytoplankton</b> community structure were investigated in relation to the properties of the water column when the nature and strength of upwelling event differed for the upwelling seasons of 2008, 2009, and 2010. In 2008, strong upwelling favorable southeasterlies were responsible for extensive upwelling and the dominance of picoeukaryotes. Alternatively, in 2009, the observed dominance of Prochlorococcus reflected the presence of oligotrophic conditions whilst southeasterlies were replaced by downwelling favorable north-westerlies that likely prohibited the full development of upwelling. In 2010, whilst southeasterlies remained relatively weak, particularly cold and low saline upwelled waters indicated enhanced upwelling events. This weak local wind field together with the occurrence of El Niño explained the observation of shallow upwelled waters below the warm surface layer and subsequent enhanced stratification. These conditions led to the dominance of Synechococcus in surface and fluorescence maximum depths, but of Prochlorococcus in bottom upwelled waters. The tight association between upwelling and stratification, i. e. whether upwelled waters reach shallower depths and/or mix with those of the surface as a result of variable climatic conditions, was suggested as the process driving the vertical heterogeneity of <b>picophytoplankton</b> populations. This study brings valuable information for changing <b>picophytoplankton</b> community structure with potential future changing hydroclimatic forcing...|$|E
40|$|Phytoplankton pigment {{diversity}} and photoacclimation during the natural day-night cycle was investigated {{at a fixed}} location in the Strait of Sicily in July 1997, using HPLC pigment analysis on fractionated samples (3 micrometers) and flow cytometry. <b>Picophytoplankton</b> dominated phytoplankton biomass in terms of chla with an average value of 57 %, and was mainly represented by prokaryotes, prymnesiophytes and pelagophytes. Prochlorococcus and picoeukaryotes equally contributed to the <b>picophytoplankton</b> in terms of chla, but Prochlorococcus were numerically more abundant and were represented by two ecotypes, one replacing the other with depth. Larger phytoplankton was dominated by prymnesiophytes and diatoms. Photoacclimation was evident from changes in pigment content and strongly increased with depth. The deep chlorophyll maximum (DCM), present between 75 and 90 m, showed a diverse and rich phytoplankton community with the two size classes almost equally represented. Growth rates of Prochlorococcus and Synechococcus, estimated from cell cycle measurements, were 0. 67 and 0. 41 d- 1, respectively at 75 m. Only Prochlorococcus was able to sustain a good growth rate of 0. 43 d- 1 {{at the base of}} the DCM (90 m), where only 0. 5 % of incident light was available. Light-shift experiments using on-board incubated natural seawater showed much faster kinetic coefficients for acclimation in <b>picophytoplankton</b> than in larger algae. In general, the data present evidence about the dynamics of <b>picophytoplankton</b> and its light adaptation through the water column and in the DCM, and can be considered representative of stable summer conditions in the Mediterranean Sea.
