The long-term tendencies of sunshine duration were analyzed by means of linear regression method and sequential version of the non-parametric Mann-Kendall test. All months excluding March, June and September are distinguished by a growing tendency of actual and relative sunshine duration. The number of sunny hours increases in spring, summer and winter, and decreases in autumn. An increase of annual sunshine duration totals (3. 5 h/year) within the 50 -year period was stated. Transformation of the annual course of sunshine duration within 50 -year period was detected. The annual maximum of sunshine duration during the first 25 -year period occurred in June and September. The second 25 -year period was characterized by increase of the number of sunny hour in May and August and by decrease of sunshine duration in June and September. The time of registration of sunshine duration extended in the morning hours and before the Sun set as a consequences of low cloudiness negative trend. The structure of sunshine duration in Łódź was presented in 5 classes of <b>possible</b> <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> (0 - sunless days, 0. 1 - 25 % - cloudy days, 25. 1 - 50 % - moderately sunny days, 50. 1 - 75 % - sunny days, > 75 % - very sunny days). Only very sunny days were distinguished by a positive annual totals trend, on average 4 days per 10 years. The tendencies of sunshine duration recorded in Łódź within fifty last years are representative for Poland and result from the macroscale factor (atmospheric circulation) not only from the influences of local (anthropogenic) conditions. The regular fluctuations in the time series of sunshine duration and solar radiation were investigated by Blackman-Tukey classical spectral analysis method. The weak periodicity (statistical insignificance) amounted 8. 3, 2. 5, 2. 8, 3. 8 years and the significance short oscillations amounted 182. 5, 91. 2, 73 days were detected in sunshine duration time series. The total and UV solar radiation time series were characterized by 182. 5, 121. 7, 73 days significance periodicities. The values of transmission coefficient of total and UV solar radiation were investigated. The daily values of transmission coefficient varied from 25 % (total radiation) and 14 % (UV) in December to 50 % (total radiation) and 26 % (UV) in May.

Over the period 1960 – 2013, 172 pairs of urban and nearby rural stations were analyzed. Urban and rural <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> trends show similar spatial patterns during a dimming phase (1960 – 1989) and a subsequent period during which trends were leveling off (1990 – 2013). This indicates that rather than local effects, the trends in <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> are on more of a national or regional scale in China. Nevertheless, in the dimming phase, the declining rate of <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> in rural areas is around two-thirds of that in urban areas. The ratio of rural to urban dimming generally increases from a minimum of 0. 39 to a maximum of 0. 87 with increasing indices of urbanization calculated based on the year 2013. It reaches a maximum when the urbanization level exceeds 50  %, the urban population exceeds 20  million, or the population density becomes higher than 250  person km − 2. After the transition into the leveling-off period, <b>sunshine</b> <b>duration</b> trends are no longer significantly affected by urbanization. Meanwhile, the number of laws and regulations related to air pollution and investment in pollution treatment have been increasing in China...|$|R
