Decomposition of mixtures of mono- and heterometallic alkoxide derivatives has also been examined. This method represents a prospective approach possessing an advantage of capability of obtaining functional materials with increased phase and chemical homogeneity and controllable grain size (including the preparation of nanosized materials) at relatively low temperature (less than 500−900 °C) {{as compared with the}} conventional techniques.|$|R
40|$|The {{distinction}} between matter (mechanics) and information (electronics) {{in the context}} of responsive building skins has promoted unique design protocols for integrating sensor technologies into material components. Such a distinction results in applications of remote sensing after the <b>process</b> <b>of</b> material <b>fabrication.</b> Sensors are commonly perceived as electronic patches which initiate mechanical output with response to electrical input. This work seeks to establish a novel approach to the application of electronics in building skins, which prioritizes material selection, behaviour, and fabrication technology in relation to the required task, over postproduction sensor integration. The term “Rapid Craft” is proposed to describe such design protocols which couple material behaviour and fabrication in the design of responsive skins. Rapid Craft is a designation for the incorporation of craft materialization knowledge within the framework <b>of</b> CNC <b>processes</b> <b>of</b> <b>fabrication.</b> A light-sensing inflatable skin system is developed as a working prototype, which demonstrates such an approach. ...|$|R
