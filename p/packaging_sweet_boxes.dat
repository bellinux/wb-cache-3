40|$|Grease proof {{packaging}} materials {{have been reported}} to contain fluorinated organic coatings. These fluorinated coatings may contain fluorotelomer-based side groups, which might be emitted from such surfaces and be degraded into perfluorinated carboxylates. Thus, packaging is discussed as a source of per- and polyfluorinated compounds (PFAS) in food. In a previous study 1 we developed screening methods aiming at the detection of fluorine in paper-based packaging and other food contact materials. Besides more sophisticated methods as headspace-GC-MS, P&T-GC-EPED and MS-DART sliding spark spectrometry (SSS) {{turned out to be a}} quick and reasonable precise screening tool. With SSS material components are vaporized in the spark plasma, atomized and activated to emit radiation. Software analysis of the delivered spectra gives information on the content of elementary fluorine on top of the surface. Basing on screening results for 146 samples from the south of Germany obtained by SSS and HSGC-MS, we could proof the equivalence of both screening methods and the reliability of SSS. Here we present screening data from 456 SSS measurements of European packaging and other food contact materials. Samples were collected in Germany (n= 238), the Netherlands (n= 13), Belgium (n= 16), Italy (n= 83), Norway (n= 56) and Greek (n= 10), whereas a focus was set on food contact materials, which were positively tested during the method development study. These were baking (muffin) papers, sandwich wraps, butter wraps, and cheese packaging. In addition, cardboard-based packaging items with a potential share of recycled paper were tested. Results indicate that the share of fluorine containing FCM in Germany, Norway, the Netherlands, Belgium, Italy, and Greek accounted for 27 %, 0 %, 23 %, 19 %, 12 % and 0 % of the samples delivered from these countries. However, due to differing sampling strategies and the number of delivered samples, data sets of the different countries are not well comparable. Therefore, further investigations focused on the whole data set. The studied food contact materials were grouped with respect to their function, i. e. the typical use as packaging material or baking aid for a special type of food. The share of fluorine positive samples in these groups differed significantly. No positive samples were found in coffee/tea filters, cardboard packaging and packaging of beverages and take away food. The share is of positive samples is below 10 % in cheese/sausage <b>packaging,</b> <b>sweet</b> <b>packaging</b> and miscellaneous. However, the occurrence of fluorine positive samples in butter wraps, fast food packaging, baking papers and sandwich wraps accounted for 13 %, 19 %, 19 % and 56 %...|$|R
