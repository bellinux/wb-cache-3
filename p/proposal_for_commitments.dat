40|$|CONTEXT AND OBJECTIVE: The {{scientific}} and technological progress {{that has taken place}} since the 1960 s has brought an ever-growing volume of scientific research, and inflation in co-authorship. Over this period, it has been observed that an increasing number of publications have listed authors or co-authors whose participation in the published research was minimal or even nonexistent. The objective of this work was to analyze reports in the literature regarding misconduct in authorship: its types, chief causes, consequences and ethical guidelines; and to outline <b>proposals</b> <b>for</b> greater ethical <b>commitment</b> in scientific publication. DESIGN AND SETTING: Narrative review undertaken at Faculdade de Medicina de Itajubá, Minas Gerais, Brazil. METHODS: Analysis of publications about authorship using the Medline, Lilacs and SciELO databases. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS: Frequent types of misconduct were gift authorship and divided and redundant publications. The chief causes of these practices seem to be the pressure exerted by academia and the desire for social and professional development. Such factors have brought an increase in unethical behavior. This bias in science continues despite the criteria defined by the International Committee of Medical Journal Editors, the Vancouver group. RECOMMENDATIONS: Various actions are proposed for educational institutions, research development agencies, regulatory agencies and professional associations. The aim is to establish an evaluation policy that gives primacy to the quality of publications and sets ethical principles for scientific research...|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of {{self-determination}} theory it is proposed that adolescents' motives for forming and maintaining identity-relevant commitments can be either autonomous or controlled in nature. This study examined whether motives <b>for</b> identity <b>commitments</b> would add {{to the prediction of}} late adolescents' adjustment beyond the effect of strength of commitment per se. In addition, it was examined how late adolescents' identity-processing styles would relate to motives <b>for</b> <b>commitment</b> and whether motives <b>for</b> <b>commitment</b> would mediate between identity styles and adjustment. In a sample of 431 late adolescents it was found that autonomous and controlled motives were, respectively, positively and negatively related to adjustment even after taking into account the role of strength of commitment. Each of the three identity styles showed a specific pattern of associations with the motives <b>for</b> <b>commitment,</b> with an information-oriented style relating to the most autonomous and internalized motivational profile. Mediation analyses showed that {{at least part of the}} associations between identity styles and adjustment are mediated by motives <b>for</b> <b>commitment.</b> Directions <b>for</b> future research are discussed...|$|R
