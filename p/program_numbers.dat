25|$|In April 2001, Logistics Management Institute (LMI) {{completed}} their final {{report for the}} 'Analysis of Alternatives (AoA) for the USMC Logistics Vehicle System Replacement (LVSR), concluding the best option was to rebuy a vehicle similar to the technology demonstrator. Five alternative options had been considered, these were: Inspect and Replace Only As Necessary (IROAN) for the LVS; rebuild the LVS; re-manufacture the LVS to a higher standard; rebuy a vehicle similar to the technology demonstrator; research and develop an entirely new vehicle. Around {{this time it was}} suggested that 2,000-3,000 vehicles might be required, although throughout the <b>program</b> <b>numbers</b> would fluctuate.|$|E
500|$|Most {{employers}} {{required that}} job applicants {{who had served}} in the military present their discharge papers as part of the application process. Blue-discharge veterans experienced difficulty in securing employment because many employers were aware that the blue discharge meant that the holder was considered undesirable. Those employers who did not know had access to a list of the Separation <b>Program</b> <b>Numbers</b> or [...] "spin" [...] numbers that the military used to classify discharges. At least four such spin numbers indicated a gay-related discharge.|$|E
5000|$|In MIDI, the {{instrument}} sound or [...] "program" [...] {{for each of}} the 16 possible MIDI channels is selected with the Program Change message, which has a Program Number parameter. The following table shows which instrument sound corresponds to each of the 128 possible <b>Program</b> <b>Numbers</b> for GM only. There are 128 <b>program</b> <b>numbers.</b> The numbers can be displayed as values 1 to 128, or, alternatively, as 0 to 127. The 0 to 127 numbering is usually only used internally by the synthesizer; the vast majority of MIDI devices, digital audio workstations and professional MIDI sequencers display these <b>Program</b> <b>Numbers</b> as shown in the table (1-128).|$|E
50|$|In a few years, CICS {{generated}} over $60 {{billion in}} new hardware revenue for IBM, and became their most-successful mainframe software product. In 1972, CICS was available in three versions - DOS-ENTRY (<b>program</b> <b>number</b> 5736-XX6) for DOS/360 machines with very limited memory, DOS-STANDARD (<b>program</b> <b>number</b> 5736-XX7), for DOS/360 machines with more memory, and OS-STANDARD V2 (<b>program</b> <b>number</b> 5734-XX7) for the larger machines which ran OS/360.|$|R

50|$|Like most formats of video{{cassette}}, a DAT cassette {{may only}} be recorded and played in one direction, unlike an analog compact audio cassette, although many DAT recorders had the capability to record <b>program</b> <b>numbers</b> and IDs, {{which can be used}} to select an individual track like on a CD player.|$|E

Rattus and Modigliana were featured in the ABC School's education maths <b>program,</b> <b>Numbers</b> Count. Also Modigliana went on to feature as co-host of the show Creature Features.

50|$|In 2012, Ohio State transitioned from Quarters to Semesters, {{allowing}} for only Fall and Spring Bands. The Fall Band began rehearsing {{twice a week}} (Fall Band used to rehearse once a week only), and with more emphasis on musicianship, memorization, and choreography, the Athletic Band program has continued to evolve into a highly energetic program that complements the Marching Band throughout the year. The Athletic Band performs at Men's and Women's Basketball, Men's and Women's Volleyball, Men's and Women's Ice Hockey, Men's Soccer, Wrestling, the Spring Football Game, an ROTC Pass-In-Review, {{as well as an}} annual concert on campus. Typically the Fall Band <b>program</b> <b>numbers</b> around 200 musicians, with the Spring Band often totaling more than 300.|$|E
50|$|GM imposes several {{requirements}} beyond the more abstract MIDI 1.0 specification. While MIDI 1.0 by itself provides a communications protocol which ensures that different instruments can interoperate at a fundamental level (e.g., that pressing keys on a MIDI keyboard will cause an attached MIDI sound module to play musical notes), GM goes further in two ways: {{it requires that}} all GM-compatible instruments meet a certain minimal set of features, such as being able to play at least 24 notes simultaneously (polyphony), and it attaches specific interpretations to many parameters and control messages which were left under-specified in the MIDI 1.0 spec, such as defining instrument sounds {{for each of the}} 128 possible <b>program</b> <b>numbers.</b>|$|E
50|$|DigiCipher II uses QPSK and BPSK at {{the same}} time. The primary {{difference}} between DigiCipher 2 and DVB lies in how each standard handles SI metadata, or System Information, where DVB reserves packet identifiers from 16 to 31 for metadata, DigiCipher reserves only packet identifier 8187 for its master guide table which acts as a look-up table for all other metadata tables. DigiCipher 2 also extends the MPEG program number that is assigned for each service in a transport stream {{with the concept of}} a virtual channel number, whereas the DVB system never defined this type of remapping preferring to use a registry of network identifiers to further differentiate <b>program</b> <b>numbers</b> from those used in other transport streams. There are also private non-standard additions to DVB that add virtual channel remapping using logical channel numbers. Also unlike DVB, all text used in descriptors can be compressed using standard Huffman coding which saves on broadcast bandwidth and loading times.|$|E

50|$|The DVB system neither {{promotes}} nor mentions either system due to {{the simple}} fact that the already defined H.222 <b>Program</b> <b>number</b> and Transport Stream ID can achieve the same purpose and also hide a channel by simply omitting it from the Program Association table.|$|R

40|$|<b>Program</b> <b>numbers</b> from {{a sample}} of IMF-supported {{programs}} are studied {{as if they were}} forecasts, through statistical analyses of the relationship between projections and outcomes for growth, inflation, and three balance of payments concepts. Statistical bias is found only for projections of inflation and official reserves. Statistical efficiency can be rejected for all variables except growth, suggesting that some program projections were less accurate than they might have been. Nevertheless, most projections are found to have some predictive value. Since several findings are shown to be sample dependent, the full-sample results should be interpreted cautiously...|$|E
