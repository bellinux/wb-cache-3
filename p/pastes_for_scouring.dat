40|$|In {{order to}} prevent the scour {{resulting}} from water falls, such as a vertical waterjet impinging normally on a sediment bed, {{it is necessary to}} make clear the hydraulicmechanism of the beginning of motion of sand gravels, that is the criterion for scour,due to the flows caused by a vertical jet. The first part of this paper deals with the theoretical approach to solve the char-acter of flows close to a boundary which is caused by impingement of jets on a normalboundary. A theoretical consideration for the boundary layer growth on the normalboundary in the various cases of two and three dimensional jets, at submerged and non-submerged conditions is described with the aid of the results of some experiments. Inthe above considerations, the boundary layer growth in the vicinity of impingement ofjets is disclosed. In the second part, the criterion <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> from a vertical submerged water jet isanalyzed by the same procedure as done by the author in the previous paper entitled"Basic Studies on the Criterion <b>for</b> <b>Scour</b> from Flows Downstream of an Outlet". It isconcluded from the comparison between the theoretical and experimental results that thefundamental relationships in the criterion <b>for</b> <b>scour,</b> which are reduced by the theory,are in good agreement with the experimental results. Based on both results of the theoryand the experiments, an empirical formula for the criterion <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> from a verticalsubmerged water jet is proposed, and moreover, some considerations on the method pre-venting the bed from scour are described...|$|R

40|$|The {{occurrence}} of amylose–lipid complexes was determined in maize and teff starch biphasic pastes i. e. peak viscosity pastes at short and prolonged pasting times. Maize and teff starches were <b>pasted</b> <b>for</b> 11. 5 and 130 min {{with or without}} added stearic acid followed by thermo-stable alpha-amylase hydrolysis in a rapid visco-analyzer. X-ray diffraction analysis of pastes before and residues after hydrolysis showed crystalline V-amylose diffraction patterns <b>for</b> the starches <b>pasted</b> <b>for</b> a prolonged time with added stearic acid while less distinct V-amylose patterns with non-complexed stearic acid peaks were observed with a short pasting time. Differential scanning calorimetry of pastes before and residues after paste hydrolysis showed that Type I amylose–lipid complexes were formed after <b>pasting</b> <b>for</b> the short duration with added stearic acid, while Type II complexes are formed after <b>pasting</b> <b>for</b> the prolonged time.

40|$|Tens of {{millions}} of dollars have been spent over the years on Federal-aid highway system bridges damaged by floods. Nearly 500, 000 of the 577, 000 existing bridges within the National Bridge Inventory are over waterways. The screening of these bridges over waterways <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> susceptibility will be completed, for the most part, by October 1992. The Federal Highway Administration has established January 1997 as the completion date <b>for</b> the <b>scour</b> evaluations of all existing bridges identified as scour susceptible. A cost-effective means of determining the specifics of bridges with unknown foundations is not currently available. Pending the development of technology to determine unknown foundations, these structures must be monitored during routine National Bridge Inspection Standards inspections and following significant flood events. The only exception to this course of action is for unknown foundation bridges on the Interstate system, which must be evaluated <b>for</b> <b>scour</b> before the January 1997 target date.
