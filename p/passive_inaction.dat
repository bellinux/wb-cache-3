60|$|Aubrey {{presently}} {{found that}} Leonard {{seemed to have}} no capacity to think or speak of the future or the past. He set Aubrey off on his own concerns, and listened with interest, asking questions that showed him perfectly alive to what regarded his friend, but the <b>passive</b> <b>inaction</b> of will and spirits still continued, and made him almost a disappointment.|$|E
50|$|Although some works, such as Munk's The Passenger, had {{disturbing}} and graphic sequences of the camps, generally these films depicted the moral dilemmas the Holocaust placed ordinary {{people in and}} the dehumanising effects it had on society as a whole, rather than the physical tribulations of individuals actually in the camps. As a result, a body of these Holocaust films were interested in those who collaborated in the Holocaust, either by direct action, as for example in The Passenger and András Kovács's Cold Days (Hideg Napok, Hungary, 1966), or through <b>passive</b> <b>inaction,</b> as in The Fifth Horseman is Fear.|$|E
40|$|Solitary Nature is {{comprised}} of six moderately large-scale easel paintings, done in oil, on both canvas and wooden panels. In the paintings, I employ subtle modeling of form in combination with a painterly handling of the materials to evoke qualities of mystery and atmosphere. The figures that appear in the paintings are solitary, except for one instance in which two figures appear. Their states of subdued action or at other times <b>passive</b> <b>inaction,</b> suggest a narrative {{that runs through the}} body of work, though it is never spelled out or made clear. Themes that recur in these works include, suggestions of the sublime, the individual in the landscape, immersion in nature and the qualities of light at twilight. My approach to these paintings was informed by Romanticism, Kant and Burke's ideas about the Sublime, my travels in the deserts and forests of California, as well as the Hudson River school of landscape painters, and contemporary painters Peter Doig and Anselm Kiefer...|$|E
6000|$|I {{have ever}} admired the United States as a nation. I have loved their liberty, their prowess, their intelligence, and their progress. I have sympathized with {{a people who}} {{themselves}} have had no sympathy with <b>passive</b> security and <b>inaction.</b> I have felt confidence in them, and have known, as it were, that their industry must enable them to succeed as a people while their freedom would insure to them success as a nation. With these convictions I went among them wishing to write of them good words--words which might be pleasant for them to read, while they might assist perhaps in producing a true impression of them here at home. But among my good words {{there are so many}} which are bitter, that I fear I shall have failed in my object as regards them. And it seems to me, as I read once more my own pages, that in saying evil things of my friends I have used language stronger than I intended; whereas I have omitted to express myself with emphasis when I have attempted to say good things. Why need I have told of the mud of Washington, or have exposed the nakedness of Cairo? Why did I speak with such eager enmity of those poor women in the New York cars, who never injured me, now that I think of it? Ladies of New York, as I write this, the words which were written among you are printed and cannot be expunged; but I tender to you my apologies from my home in England. And that Van Wyck Committee--might I not have left those contractors to be dealt with by their own Congress, seeing that that Congress committee was by no means inclined to spare them? I might have kept my pages free from gall, and have sent my sheets to the press unhurt by the conviction that I was hurting those who had dealt kindly by me! But what then? Was any people ever truly served by eulogy; or an honest cause furthered by undue praise? ...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{seeks to}} {{establish}} the place of Baron von aigel and George Tyrrell in the revival of interest in mysticism {{at the beginning of}} the present century. Though leading figures in the modernist movement in the Roman Catholic Church, their collaboration on the subject of mysticism was central to their friendship and work. They helped to retrieve the central concerns of mystical theology after a retreat from mysticism which had affected the Church since the condemnation of Quietism in 1699. Their account of Christian mysticism, which involved a critique of Buddhism, neo-Platonism and pantheism, rested on a worldaffirming attitude to creation, a balance between divine transcendence and immanence and the articulation of a legitimate panentleism. It also involved a positive acceptance of the bodily-spiritual unity of human nature and ordinary experience as the locus of mystical encounter with God. Their account also emphasised the reality of direct contact between God and the individual, and the affective and cognitive dimensions of mystical experience. They asserted the centrality of mystical union as a dynamic communion of life, love and action which is the primary goal of the Christian life. They emphasised the necessity of contemplation, understood not as <b>passive</b> <b>inaction,</b> but as a profound energising of the soul. Asceticism, the embracing of suffering, self-discipline and a right ordering of human affection, was also judged indispensable. Moreover, they believed that only in the context of the intellectual and institutional elements of religion, does mysticism find its true theological locus in Christian life and reflection. Their comprehensive definition of mysticism opened up the possibility of understanding both the uniqueness of Christian mysticism, and the reality and value of non-Christian forms of mystical experience as genuine encounters with the divine. Accepting a universal call to mysticism, they held the mystical way to be the way to full humanity which is also the individual's realisation of divinity...|$|E
