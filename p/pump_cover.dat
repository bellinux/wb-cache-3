The pressure in the outlet oil chamber rises with rotation of rotor which makes the space smaller and smaller. In the result of postprocessor the maximum pressure is 4. 3 Mpa. This paper also studies on the internal velocity field distribution of pump body and <b>pump</b> <b>cover.</b> By the chart of velocity vector, fluid exists obvious reflow phenomenon. This is because of effection of the rotor rotation. The maximum velocity mainly exists in <b>pump</b> <b>cover.</b> Futhermore, flow characteristic curve is compared with the experimental result.

40|$|Abstract. The process CAD {{design is}} the key part for steel casting {{production}} in general foundry enterprises. Formerly, for those parts with PDF file from customers, especially foreign customers, the process CAD design was done just by 2 D casting process CAD system depending on AutoCAD system; so the designer must spend much time drawing part by AutoCAD according the PDF file which cause low efficiency. In this paper, a new process CAD design method is proposed based on PDF file {{in order to avoid}} drawing part by AutoCAD. Fist, the framework of process CAD design is constructed. Second, as the base part of process CAD design, the practical 2 D CAD frame is established. Third, the part drawing with PDF file is resolved to be displayed clearly through the Mupdf rendering engine. Finally, the casting processes design of two actual steel castings, including a <b>pump</b> <b>cover</b> casting and a large gear casting, are presented to illustrate this new process CAD design method...|$|E

To support this environment, the basic infrastructure for the enterprise must to consider two main modules: The Internal Module, that represents the autonomous unit of a particular company and includes the manufacturing system, the complete structure of the company information (databases, information system etc.) and all the decision making processes; The Cooperation Layer, which contains all the functionality for the interconnection between {{the company and the}} whole net/environment. The aims of this paper are to propose several techniques for manufacturing systems remodeling in order {{to integrate the}}m in virtual enterprise environment, and to validate those techniques by manufacturing simulation. The main problem in this integrated environment consists in the management of connections and data exchange between the CAD-CAM-CAE systems.

40|$|The paper {{describes}} a multi-domain simulation of a gerotor oil pump. Three different analysis tools {{have been used}} in synergy to predict the pump flow rate, in both conditions of complete and incomplete filling, and the pressure ripple. The computational fluid dynamics software PumpLinx® has been used for the determination of the discharge coefficients, while a finite element model analysis performed with ANSYS® has allowed the evaluation of the deflection of the <b>pump</b> <b>cover</b> under the action of the delivery pressure. The data calculated with the 3 D tools have been utilized as input for a lumped parameter model of the pump developed in LMS Amesim® with customized libraries. The aim of the study is to supply the guidelines for tuning the models using a reduced number of computational fluid dynamics simulations. The results collected in the experimental campaign have demonstrated that a lumped parameter approach can be suitable, if properly calibrated, to predict the pressure oscillations in conditions of defective filling. Moreover, {{it was found that the}} cover deflection has a significant importance not only on the leakages, but also on the pressure ripple...|$|E

40|$|The paper {{describes}} the modelling and the experimental tests of a variable displacement vane pump for engine lubrication. The approach {{used for the}} simulation has involved 3 D commercial tools for tuning a 0 D customized model implemented in the LMS Amesim® environment. Different leakage paths are considered and the axial clearances are variable {{to take into account}} the deformation of the <b>pump</b> <b>cover,</b> calculated through a finite element analysis with ANSYS®. The vane tip clearances are calculated as function of the dynamic equilibrium equation of the vanes. The displacement control takes into account the internal forces on the stator due to the pressure in all variable chambers and to the contact force exerted by the vanes. The discharge coefficients in the resistive components have been tuned by means of a complete 3 D transient model of the pump built with PumpLinx®. The tuned 0 D model has been proved to be reliable for the determination of the steady-state flow-speed and flow-pressure curves, with a correct estimation of the internal leakages and of the pressure imposed by the displacement control. The pump has been also tested using a simplified circuit and a fair agreement has been found in the evaluation of the delivery pressure ripple...|$|E
40|$|Thermal {{embrittlement}} of static-cast CF- 8 {{stainless steel}} components from the decommissioned Shippingport reactor has been characterized. Cast stainless steel materials {{were obtained from}} four cold-leg check valves, three hot-leg main shutoff valves, and two pump volutes. The actual time-at-temperature for the materials was {approximately} 13 y at {approximately} 281 C (538 F) for the hot-leg components and {approximately} 264 C (507 F) for the cold-leg components. Baseline mechanical properties for as-cast material were determined from tests on either recovery-annealed material, i. e., annealed for 1 h at 550 C and then water quenched, or material from the cooler region of the component. The Shippingport materials show modest decreases in fracture toughness and Charpy-impact properties and a small increase in tensile strength because of relatively low service temperatures and ferrite content of the steel. The procedure and correlations developed at Argonne National Laboratory for estimating mechanical properties of cast stainless steels predict accurate or slightly lower values for Charpy-impact energy, tensile flow stress, fracture toughness J-R curve, and J{sub IC} of the materials. The kinetics of thermal embrittlement and degree of embrittlement at saturation, i. e., the minimum impact energy achieved after long-term aging, were established from materials that were aged further in the laboratory.

The correlations successfully predicted the mechanical properties of the Ringhals 2 reactor hot and crossover-leg elbows (CF- 8 M steel) after service of {approximately} 15 y and the KRB reactor <b>pump</b> <b>cover</b> plate (CF- 8) after {approximately} 8 y of service...|$|E
40|$|Traditional {{technologies}} used {{to generate}} vacuum for steelmaking are steam ejectors, liquid ring vacuum pumps and systems combined of them. The steam ejector system has a capacity to generate a medium vacuum 101 kPa (1 atm) a 0, 1 Pa (0, 01 mbar), the liquid ring pumps only reach 3 kPa (30 mbar) and dried <b>pump</b> <b>cover</b> the range of 101 kPa (1 atm) até 67 Pa (0, 67 mbar), band required for use in secondary metallurgy and is the limit of this technology. In this work was realized {{a case study in}} the industrial sector that uses the vacuum generation through steam ejectors superheated at 250 ° C and 1, 2 MPa (12 kgf/cm 2). The vacuum is needed for removal of undesirable gases in the composition of the steel as nitrogen, oxygen, hydrogen and sulfur which causes weakness in the crystalline structure. Currently there have been technological innovations for vacuum generation in applications in VD (vacuum degassing), vacuums until to 67 Pa (0, 67 mbar) and VOD (decarburization) for vacuums of 8 - 20 kPa (80 - 200 mbar). One of these innovations is mechanical pumps dried formed by three-stage vacuum, joining various technologies, the first and second rotor roots and the third screw rotor. In this study the objective was to measure the real returns offered by the steam ejector system, along with the performance of the boiler compared to the new dry pump technology in steel making industry, will present the advantages, disadvantages and cost effective to replace the vacuum generating system.

30|$|We {{measured}} the household environmental deprivation {{of all the}} three domains—sanitation, drinking water and cooking fuel. A household {{is said to be}} poor in household environment if it does not have access to any two of the three household environmental conditions: sanitation, improved cooking fuel and improved drinking water. Access to toilet facility is considered improved sanitation, especially if the household uses the pit latrine, semi-flush (septic tank) latrine or flush toilet. Improved drinking water is defined as access to drinking water from piped tap, tube well, hand <b>pump,</b> <b>covered</b> well, rainwater and bottled water. Similarly, the household was considered not deprived of clean cooking fuel if it used improved chulla with chimney or fuel other than biomass (kerosene, LPG, etc.) for cooking. If the household does not use an improved source, it is referred to as unimproved. The inter-dimensional responsiveness of the three variables is shown in Appendix 1. In India, 29.7 % households had access to improved drinking water, sanitation and cooking fuel, 16.2 % had access to improved drinking water and sanitation only, 8.8 % had access to improved drinking water and cooking fuel only and 2.4 % had access to improved sanitation and cooking fuel only.|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background The use of {{patients}} {{as the primary}} teaching modality for learning procedures is being questioned. While there have been advancements in the technology used for performing needle biopsies in both native and transplanted kidneys, {{there has been little}} advancement in teaching and training tools. We have developed a portable ex-vivo kidney, the Bento Kidney, using cryo-preserved porcine kidneys for teaching this procedure. Methods The kidney is thawed, perfused by a <b>pump,</b> <b>covered</b> with skin for realistic haptic feedback, and then used with existing biopsy technology to teach the technique. Results Thirty porcine kidneys were used in this pilot research, and nine were shipped to physicians at a distant facility. Renal biopsy was then performed using a core biopsy needle and ultrasound guidance. There was some leakage of fluid from all kidneys noted. All trainees felt that the model was realistic, and judged at a mean score of 8. 7 (SD 0. 8) on a scale of 1 (not useful) to 10 (very useful). Conclusions This feasibility study demonstrates that cryo-preserved porcine kidneys can be successfully used to teach and train renal biopsy techniques, and provides haptic feedback as well as realistic real-time ultrasound images. Further large scale studies are needed to demonstrate value from the educational point of view for nephrology and transplantation. </p...|$|R

40|$|The {{heat supply}} for Swedish multi-family {{residential}} buildings {{is becoming more}} complex, and today it is fairly common to combine district heating with a second heat source. The most common heat source to combine with district heating in Sweden is an exhaust air heat pump. On average, the exhaust air heat <b>pump</b> <b>covers</b> 31 % of the yearly heat load and is given full load priority. There is a missed potential in cost and CO 2 savings when one heat source is given full load priority, since marginal production costs and CO 2 emissions constantly vary in both the electrical grid and the district heating system. The {{aim of this study}} is to evaluate how buildings with several heat sources should be operated using hourly energy prices. Hourly heat and electricity prices for Gothenburg have been established for two years based on the marginal costs of heat and electricity generation. These prices have been used to evaluate the most common combinations of heat sources. Results show that the most common combination with an exhaust air heat pump with full load priority does not lower costs compared to the reference case with only district heating. However, having a control system that allows heat source shifting and gives load priority to the heat source with the lowest cost each hour can greatly reduce the heating cost, and systems with larger heat pumps show even greater potential for heat source shifting...|$|R
