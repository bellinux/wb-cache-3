5|$|Vijayanagara {{architecture}} is a vibrant {{combination of the}} Chalukya, Hoysala, Pandya and Chola styles, idioms that prospered in previous centuries. Its legacy of sculpture, architecture and painting influenced {{the development of the}} arts long after the empire came to an end. Its stylistic hallmark is the ornate <b>pillared</b> Kalyanamantapa (marriage hall), Vasanthamantapa (open <b>pillared</b> halls) and the Rayagopura (tower). Artisans used the locally available hard granite because of its durability since the kingdom was under constant threat of invasion. While the empire's monuments are spread over the whole of Southern India, nothing surpasses the vast open-air theatre of monuments at its capital at Vijayanagara, a UNESCO World Heritage Site.|$|E

40|$|The "classical " <b>pillaring</b> {{procedures}} of a smectite with A 13 + solutions have two disadvantages: (1) {{the preparation of}} the <b>pillaring</b> solutions and of the clay suspensions are time consuming; (2) large quantities of water have to be handled (Lahav et al., 1978; Vaughan & Lussier, 1980; Pinnavaia et al., 1984; Schutz et al., 1987; Figueras et al., 1990). Upscaling of the <b>pillaring</b> process requires that solutions be found for these problems, and a method is presented whereby the two disadvantages have been reduced to a large extent. Materials and methods AI <b>pillaring</b> solutions were prepared at room temperature by addition of 100 ml of i or 2 M NaOH solutions to 100 ml of 1 M A 1 C 13 solutions until [OH]/[A 1] equalled 1 to 2 under vigorous tirring. The time of addition was- 2 min and the solution was turbid; a 20 min reflux was necessary to obtain a clear solution. In another set of preparations the addition rate was 0 - 05 ml/min, but even with this slow addition some turbidity was created and a short period of reflux was also necessary.

5|$|A small {{offering}} chapel is adjoining {{the eastern}} side of the main pyramid and is barely visible today. It consisted of a central two <b>pillared</b> room with a large quartzite false door and two narrow chambers on the sides. Like the mortuary temple, the chapel was floored with black basalt. Its walls however were made of Tura limestone and granite and were adorned with fine reliefs of offering scenes.|$|E
5|$|Ibn Batuta has {{reasoned}} that Muhammad Shah wished {{to see a}} unified city comprising Old Delhi, Siri, Jahanpanah and Tughlaqabad with one contiguous fortification encompassing them but cost considerations forced him to abandon the plan halfway. In his chronicle, Batuta also stated that the Hazar Sutan Palace (1000 <b>pillared</b> palace), built outside the Siri fort limits but within the Jahanpanah city area, was the residence of the Tughlaq.|$|E
5|$|The {{rulers of}} the Middle Kingdom (c. 2055–1650BC) {{continued}} building pyramids and their associated complexes. The rare remains from Middle Kingdom temples, {{like the one at}} Medinet Madi, show that temple plans grew more symmetrical during that period, and divine temples made increasing use of stone. The pattern of a sanctuary lying behind a <b>pillared</b> hall frequently appears in Middle Kingdom temples, and sometimes these two elements are fronted by open courts, foreshadowing the standard temple layout used in later times.|$|E
50|$|The {{quarrying}} and slate business {{did well}} {{until the early}} 1920s when demand fell and the Bryn Eglwys quarry was only kept open by <b>pillaring</b> the easy to obtain slate rather than by digging out new underground chambers. At times there was a three-day week, but the quarry soldiered on until 1941 when Sir Haydn's lease expired. He continued on a yearly lease until 1946 when a roof fall caused by the continued <b>pillaring</b> closed the quarry for good.|$|R

5|$|At {{the heart}} of the city, a royal palace was built which also served as a temple. Four {{successive}} architectural levels from the second kingdom's palace have been unearthed (the oldest is designated P3, while the latest is P0), and the last two levels are dated to the Akkadian period. The first two levels were excavated; the findings include a temple named Enceinte Sacrée, which was the largest in the city but it is unknown for whom it was dedicated. Also unearthed were a <b>pillared</b> throne room and a hall that have three double wood pillars leading to the temple.|$|E

5|$|In the 14th {{century the}} kings {{continued}} to build vesara or Deccan-style monuments but later incorporated Dravida-style gopuras {{to meet their}} ritualistic needs. The Prasanna Virupaksha temple (underground temple) of Bukka and the Hazare Rama temple of Deva Raya are examples of Deccan architecture. The varied and intricate ornamentation of the pillars is a mark of their work. At Hampi, though the Vitthala temple is {{the best example of}} their <b>pillared</b> Kalyanamantapa style, the Hazara Ramaswamy temple is a modest but perfectly finished example. A visible aspect of their style is their return to the simplistic and serene art developed by the Chalukya dynasty. A grand specimen of Vijayanagara art, the Vitthala temple, took several decades to complete during the reign of the Tuluva kings.|$|E

40|$|MCM- 36 {{materials}} were prepared by swelling the layered MCM- 22 precursors with large organic molecules and then <b>pillaring</b> the resulting material with polymeric silica. A mesopore region with 0. 25 – 0. 3 nm thickness between the microporous layers was identified. The BET surface area obtained for MCM- 36 was 2. 5 to 3 {{times higher than}} that of MCM- 22. The sorption characteristics of linear alkanes are similar for MCM- 22 and MCM- 36 materials, indicating that sorption is dominated by the 10 -membered ring microporous channel system and that the pore structure of the MCM- 22 layers stays intact during the swelling and <b>pillaring</b> processes. Swelling and <b>pillaring,</b> however, decreased the concentration of Brønsted acid sites compared with the starting material. The largest fraction of strong Brønsted acid sites is located in this zeolite layer. Adsorption of 2, 2, 4 -trimethylpentane indicates that only about 10 % of the bridging hydroxyl groups are located in the mesoporous region. The superior catalytic performance of MCM- 36 compared with MCM- 22 for alkylation of isobutane with n-butene indicates that the open mesoporous structure can be successfully utilized to make acid sites of the layers accessible to large molecules...|$|R

5|$|The temple is {{enclosed}} in the cave, it has interior walls but no exterior wall. The pillars create {{the space and}} symmetric rhythm as they support the weight of hill above. The main mandapa recesses into a <b>pillared</b> vestibule (ardha-mandapa) on the south side, while a <b>pillared</b> portico (mukha-mandapa) connects it to the main entrance. Embedded within the Great Cave are dedicated shrines, the largest {{of which is the}} square plan Linga shrine (see 16 in plan). It is a square garbha-griya (womb house) with four entrances, located in the right section of the main hall. Steps lead from the four doorways into the sanctum, which has a linga in the mulavigraha style. Each doorway is guarded by a dvarapala on each side, for a total of eight dvarapalas, their heights spanning floor to the ceiling. These were badly damaged when the Portuguese ceded control of this region to the British. The linga shrine is surrounded by a mandapa and circumambulation path (pradakshina-patha) as in other Hindu temples. The pillars are similarly aligned east-west to this shrine, and have an east entrance. Overlaid, as if fused, on the architecture of this temple is another open temple aligned to the north-south direction with three faced Sadashiva as its focal center. One features the abstract, unmanifest, aniconic symbol of Shiva, the other anthropomorphic, manifest, iconic symbol of Shiva. The mandapa pillars of the two align up.|$|E
5|$|These Nishidhis {{detail the}} names, dates, the {{duration}} of the vow, and other austerities performed by the person who observed the vow. The earliest Nishidhis (6th to 8th century) mostly have an inscription on the rock without any symbols. This style continued until the 10th century when footprints were added alongside the inscription. After the 11th century, Nishidhis are inscribed on slabs or pillars with panels and symbols. These slabs or pillars were frequently erected in mandapas (<b>pillared</b> pavilions), near basadi (temples), or sometimes as an inscription on the door frame or pillars of the temple.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the {{causeway}} was a large hall leading to a <b>pillared</b> open court surrounded by magazine chambers. The court led into the mortuary temple proper which housed statues of the king and where the offerings to the deceased took place. This was immediately adjacent to {{the eastern side of the}} pyramid, which was surrounded by an enclosure wall defining the sacred space. At the southeast corner of the enclosure was a small satellite pyramid for the Ka of the king. The internal chambers of the pyramid were entered in 1881 by Gaston Maspero, who thus discovered the pyramid texts. The burial chamber housed nothing but a black basalt sarcophagus sunk into the floor and a canopic chest. The sarcophagus proved to contain scattered bones, which may belong to Unas.|$|E

5|$|Most famous {{among the}} many temples built by the Wodeyars is the Chamundeshwari Temple atop the Chamundi Hill. The {{earliest}} structure here was consecrated in the 12th century and was later patronised by the Mysore rulers. Maharaja Krishnaraja III added a Dravidian-style gopuram in 1827. The temple has silver-plated doors with images of deities. Other images include those of the Hindu god Ganesha and of Maharaja Krishnaraja III with his three queens. Surrounding the main palace in Mysore and inside the fort are a group of temples, built in various periods. The Prasanna Krishnaswamy Temple (1829), the Lakshmiramana Swamy Temple whose earliest structures date to 1499, the Trinesvara Swamy Temple (late 16th century), the Shweta Varaha Swamy Temple built by Purnaiah {{with a touch of}} Hoysala style of architecture, the Prasanna Venkataramana Swami Temple (1836) notable for 12 murals of the Wodeyar rulers.

5|$|Their temple {{building}} {{activity can}} be categorised into three phases. The early phase {{began in the}} last quarter of the 6th century and resulted in many cave temples, prominent among which are three elementary cave temples at Aihole (one Vedic, one Jain and one Buddhist which is incomplete), followed by four developed cave temples at Badami (of which cave 3, a Vaishnava temple, is dated accurately to 578 CE). These cave temples at Badami are similar, in that, each has a plain exterior but an exceptionally well finished interior consisting of a <b>pillared</b> verandah, a columned hall (mantapa) and a cella (shrine, cut deep into rock) which contains the deity of worship. In Badami, three caves temples are Vedic and one in Jain. The Vedic temples contain large well sculpted images of Harihara, Mahishasuramardhini, Varaha, Narasimha, Trivikrama, Vishnu seated on Anantha (the snake) and Nataraja (dancing Shiva).|$|E
5|$|South India has two {{distinct}} styles of rock architecture, the Dravidian style of Tamil Nadu and the Vesara style of Karnataka. The temples considered of porches or mantapas preceding the door {{leading to the}} sanctum, gate-pyramids or gopurams, which are the principal features in the quadrangular enclosures that surround the more notable temples and <b>pillared</b> halls used for many purposes and are the invariable accompaniments of these temples. Besides these, a South Indian temple typically has a tank called the Kalyani or Pushkarni. The gopuram is a monumental tower, usually ornate {{at the entrance of}} any temple in Southern India. This forms a prominent feature of koils, Hindu temples of the Dravidian style. They are topped by the kalasam, a spherical stone finial, and function as gateways through the walls that surround the temple complex. The origins of the gopuram {{can be traced back to}} early structures of the Pallavas and by the twelfth century, under the Pandya rulers, these gateways became a dominant feature of a temple's outer appearance, eventually overshadowing the inner sanctuary which became obscured from view by the colossal size of the gopuram.|$|E
