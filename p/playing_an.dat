5|$|The first {{internationally known}} bands from Dominica were 1970s {{groups such as}} Exile One and Grammacks. These bands were {{the stars of the}} cadence-lypso scene, which was the first style of Dominican music to become popular across the Caribbean. By the 1980s, however, Martinican zouk and other styles were more popular. In 1988, WCK formed, <b>playing</b> <b>an</b> {{experimental}} fusion of cadence-lypso with the island’s jing ping sound. The result became known as bouyon, and has re-established Dominica in the field of popular music.|$|E

5|$|Towards {{the end of}} the 1921 season, Allen {{was invited}} to play {{first-class}} cricket as an amateur for Middlesex, for whom he qualified by residence. Allen believed that Pelham Warner, who often supported young Middlesex cricketers, encouraged his selection by the club, despite the potential risks to the team's position in the County Championship from <b>playing</b> <b>an</b> inexperienced cricketer. Allen made his first-class debut against Somerset on 21 August 1921 and made one other appearance that season without achieving much in either match.|$|E

5|$|After <b>playing</b> <b>an</b> {{exhibition}} match, Murray {{started the}} French Open with three tough wins, before losing in straight sets to Tomáš Berdych {{in the fourth}} round. In London, Murray progressed to the third round, where he faced Mardy Fish. At 3–3 in the final set with momentum going Murray's way (he had {{just come back from}} 3–0 down), the match was called off for bad light, leaving Murray fuming. Coming back the next day, Murray was edged out by the eventual finalist in a tie-breaker for his second defeat by him in the year. At Wimbledon, Murray progressed to the semifinals, losing to Nadal in straight sets. On 27 July 2010, Murray and his coach Maclagan split, and Murray replaced him with Àlex Corretja.|$|E
5|$|Allison {{resigned}} in 1947, {{a year after}} professional football resumed, and his position {{was taken over by}} Tom Whittaker, the club's first-team trainer. Intent on <b>playing</b> <b>an</b> expansive style of football, he purchased Don Roper and converted Ian McPherson's position from defender to winger. The changes had the desired effect as Arsenal won the 1947–48 First Division championship. Whittaker won the club's third FA Cup in 1950 and repeated early league success in 1952–53. The club's success began to wane after this, which in turn commenced a stressful period for Whittaker. In October 1956 he died of a heart attack, aged 58. Jack Crayston presided over first-team affairs as caretaker, before he was named permanent manager at the end of 1956. His time was brief compared to his predecessors and left the club in May 1958, achieving a twelfth-place finish in the league.|$|E
5|$|As a child, Margaret {{participated in}} many singing contests; {{as her father}} recalled, she usually lost. She {{attended}} the Ińsko school complex (a primary school and a gimnazjum), and concurrently studied saxophone (initially clarinet) at the Ignacy Jan Paderewski first degree State Music School in Choszczno. Shortly after finishing music school, her nasal septum was damaged in a bicycle accident which temporarily prevented her from <b>playing</b> <b>an</b> instrument. In addition to saxophone classes, Margaret studied singing at the Jazz Academy in Kraków and took private singing lessons from renowned vocal coach Elżbieta Zapendowska. At age sixteen she moved to Szczecin, where she graduated from Liceum ogólnokształcące 14. At this time she adopted her stage name, Margaret, the English equivalent of Małgorzata.|$|E
