However, probability approaches may lead to very complex formulations and generally require restrictive assumptions (such as normality or independence) that can hardly be verified in real complex problems. A conjectured-price-response equilibrium model that uses LR-possibility distributions to represent the uncertainty of the residual demand curves faced by the participant agents is proposed. Modelling the risk-aversion attitudes of the agents, the resulting possibilistic equilibrium is transformed into a simplified deterministic one, which is solved with a new globally convergent algorithm for variational inequalities problems.

We answer this and related questions with respect to Karnataka, an Indian state showing signs of agrarian distress. Using the participatory impact assessment (PIA) method involving farmers, researchers and voluntary workers, we {{assess the impact of}} recent policy-driven farming practices. The land use functions (LUFs) framework, which resembles the ecosystem services framework, was adapted in the PIA to address multidimensional sustainability in agricultural landscapes.

40|$|Purpose – This paper {{sets out}} to review {{research}} on the compatibility between values underlying western accounting systems and traditional Solomon Islands cultural values. The research takes a sociological view of accounting to better understand how imported accounting values and practices fit into, and interact with, local traditions. Design/methodology/approach – An interpretive methodology uses in-depth interviews and participant observation. Both inductive and a priori approaches identify and describe major themes. Findings – The areas of conflict found between accounting themes and traditional Solomon Island group values relate to: the objectivity and neutrality of accounting; <b>profit</b> and wealth <b>maximisation</b> as the bottom-line; the separateness of the economic entity; time-based accounting controls; and the underlying basis of competition for efficiency and effectiveness in western accounting systems. Research limitations/implications – The challenge is to identify how to adapt accounting and management practices so they fit into existing local cultural values and practices. Solomon Islanders must also determine how some of their cultural values {{can be adapted to}} suit contemporary economic circumstances. Practical implications – The paper recommends that consideration be given to recasting elements of accounting and management practice so that they better reflect the nature of the society/activities being represented – namely, the discharge of accountability; valuing intangible business outcomes; owner-entity separation; time management; and bounded competition.

40|$|The {{well-known}} "law {{of supply}} and demand" says that {{an increase in the}} price of a commodity leads to a decrease in the aggregate demand for this commodity and an increase in aggregate supply. There is, however, no theoretical foundation for this "law". Empirical evidence, on the other hand, should be interpreted with care. If one estimates the parameters of certain functional forms for demand and supply functions, then the results may simply be consequences of the parametric assumptions made in estimation. The first chapter of the thesis discusses the implications of the assumption of <b>profit</b> and utility <b>maximisation</b> for the properties of demand and supply functions. It explains why economic rationality on the microlevel does not, in general, lead to macroeconomic regularities and suggests replacing the consumption sector of the neoclassical equilibrium model by a large population of individually small consumers. Such a population will be explored in the second chapter. The chapter is a direct outgrowth of a basic contribution by W. Hildenbrand: "On the Law of Demand", Econometrica 1983. In W. Hildenbrand's model the market demand function is defined by integrating an individual demand function with respect to an exogenously given income distribution. We build into the model an individual labour supply function and then compare the matrix of aggregate income effects studied by W. Hildenbrand with that obtained by integrating the individual demand function with respect to a distribution of wage rates. The empirical part of the thesis analyses the labour supply and earnings data in the U. K. Family Expenditure Survey 1970 - 85. Using non- parametric smoothing methods, the elasticity of labour supply with respect to the wage rate is estimated for several groups of workers. The estimations for full-time workers confirm the famous "downward sloping" labour supply function. The estimated elasticities for the entire population of workers for the years 1970 - 85 have the mean value 0. 2 and the standard deviation 0. 02...|$|R
40|$|The network {{industries}} have been undergoing {{a process of}} reform, where liberalisation {{is one of the}} main features. This thesis studies the effect of liberalisation, with and without competition, on the incumbent's incentives to innovate. A model of incumbent network operator is developed and analysed when the incumbent is a monopolist, as well as when it faces an entrant. The objectives of the incumbent are specified in a general manner to allow for revenue, <b>profit,</b> and/or welfare <b>maximisation.</b> The marginal cost of the incumbent is assumed to depend upon the investment in new technologies and processes. A strictly convex and decreasing cost function is assumed. The incumbent maximises its objective function with respect to prices and to investment in innovation. The entrant is assumed to maximise profits with respect to prices. The incumbent's incentives to innovate under monopoly and duopoly are compared. One of the main results is that the difference between the investment in innovation under monopoly and under duopoly is determined by the incumbent's elasticity of demand under monopoly as well as by the incumbent's market share and elasticity of demand under duopoly. For certain values of these variables it exists an interval where duopoly provides more incentives to innovate than monopoly. The market share of the incumbent has a non-linear relationship with the investment in innovation under duopoly. Until a certain point an increase in the incumbent's market share creates more incentives to innovate under duopoly and from that point on the contrary happens. A decrease (in absolute value) in the incumbent's elasticity of demand has a negative effect on the incentives to innovate under both market structures. Another major result is that the incentives to innovate increase when the incumbent places greater weight on social welfare. The effect of liberalisation and competition on innovation in the postal sector is empirically assessed. The impact of the quantity supplied and of some control variables is also analysed. An original dataset is put together to perform the analysis. It includes data for seventeen European countries, over ten years. Innovation is measured using an innovation index, the accumulated number of innovations (both based on the results of a survey developed for this purpose), and labour productivity. A liberalisation index is built in order to measure the percentage of liberalised market. The econometric analysis performed, where several models were estimated by GLS and using PW-PCSE, shows that: (1) market liberalisation has a positive effect on innovation, and (2) an increase in the market share of the competitors stimulates the incumbent's investment in innovation, at least until the market share of the competitors reaches a certain threshold. Letter volume and GDP per capita are also significant and have a positive relationship with innovation. In general, the models estimated have a high explanatory power. The econometric analysis only considers end-to-end competition. The effect of upstream and downstream access on innovation is studied by way of three case studies (USPS, La Poste, and Royal Mail). The initial expectations of a positive relationship between both upstream and downstream access and innovation are confirmed...|$|R

40|$|Islamic {{banking and}} finance (IBF) {{emerged as a}} novel {{financing}} method since mid‐ 1970 s with an objective of managing the wealth in a religiously informed manner. While the initial perception in the West was not necessarily encouraging, by 1990 s IBF managed to capture {{the attention of the}} main players in international financial and banking circles due to the success it demonstrated. Consequently, IBF {{has become part of the}} international financial markets recognised as heterogeneous financial products. In addition to number of Muslim countries, European countries have facilitated the internalisation of IBF activities through new legislations and regulations. While it is true that rudimentary principles of IBF historically were practised in the Muslim societies, the institutionalisation of IBF is rather new and has taken place in post 1970 period. This is a clear indication of internalisation of modernity and its institutions in the form of banks and financial firms. Considering that in essence IBF movement is a product of politically oriented identity politics aiming at creating Islamic solution to the modern problems, it seems that modern problems have imposed modern institutions onto Islamic discourse; and hence Islamic identity search has facilitated the expansion of modernisation in the Muslim world as a by product through redefining it by Islamic scholars. Importantly, in this process, Islamic economic values have been compromised for the success of these institutions; as fiqh dominated IBF solutions focus on the nature of process (Shari’ah compliancy) rather than the consequences of the given injunctions and developed products (Islam based). Hence, the recent debate between Shari’ah compliancy vs. Islam based IBF is a product of such developments, which implies the conflict between Islamic values against modern construct of fiqh understanding of IBF, as the latter is constructed with modern economy requirements of efficiency and <b>profit</b> and return <b>maximisation</b> through the approval of Shari‟ah scholars who claims to uphold Islamic values. Thus, considering Islamic finance as part of multiple modernities project implies, in a rational way, bringing two different worlds together. As with the facilitation of the IBF in some of the EU countries, there is an implicit recognition of a religion based financing in the West indicating the recognition of rationale and logic that is behind this development beyond the „universal modernity‟. This, consequently, implies that universal modernity accepts the existence and the practice of socially constructed multiple modernities as in the case of IB, which contributes to pluralism. Against this background, this paper attempts to evaluate the developments in IBF by locating it as part of the (unintended) modernisation produced by Islamic political identity search. Hence, new (multiple) modernities are originated in the process, which has received recognition by the universal modernity located in the enlightenment process and is reflected in the practice of secular socio‐political environment prevailing in the West. Therefore, this paper aims at exploring the concept of multiple modernities with the objective of locating the developments in IBF within this framework. In doing so, this paper argues that while multiple modernities are produced with the involvement of Shari‟ah scholars as part of the IBF institutions, developments in IBF in the secular Western countries is a clear indication of the internalisation of Shari‟ah based rulings within the secular legal and regulative environment. Such developments in the West indicate pluralism in the source of law making, which implies the acceptance of divinely ordained rules, which goes against foundational claims of secularism. This in itself means recognition of the cognitive rationality of revealed knowledge, albeit, in this case, very pragmatically with wealth generating reasons...|$|R
40|$|Since {{the seminal}} work of Adam Smith, markets have been {{considered}} an efficient tool for co-ordinating the behaviour of economic agents. The basic characteristic of a market economy is that the complex system of interaction among individuals is not centrally coordinated. Under the assumption of <b>profit</b> and utility <b>maximisation</b> (and {{a whole set of}} assumptions about the institutional framework), relative prices and their change over time provide the signals that guide, like an invisible hand, the allocation of resources, i. e., the structure of production and the intensity of input use in the various production processes. They do this by co-ordinating the activities of economic agents, i. e., of resource owners, producers, intermediaries, traders, and consumers. After system change in the former Soviet Union and in Central and Eastern Europe (CEE) central economic planning had to be replaced by other forms of co-ordination. The general direction in all transition countries was towards a market economy, but the speed and depth of reforms towards an environment in which markets can evolve differed largely between countries, sectors and between different phases during the past 15 years. IAMO Forum 2005 focuses on this development and discusses the functioning of markets, the requirements for this, and {{the advantages and disadvantages of}} other co-ordination mechanisms under different environments in the agricultural and food sectors in Central and Eastern Europe. CEE agri-food markets deserve researchers' and policy makers' attention for several reasons. Two of them regard the high demand for support to policy decisions that aim to stimulate economic and social development in the region. In most CEE countries, the significance of the agricultural and food sector is relatively high with respect to income and employment. In particular, rural areas can benefit from the development of this branch of the economy. Also, there is marked indication that agri-food markets in CEE are not ensuring exchange as frictionless as possible. This means that large benefits can be expected if potential improvements of the economic environment are implemented and if individual agents adapt optimally to that environment. Another motivation for economic research on transition countries is that we are looking at a huge region that started almost as a vacuum with regard to institutional settings. This means that a wide range of substantially different settings were introduced in the respective countries, and were only weakly confined by political rigidities or path dependencies. From a distant perspective, the repeated fundamental shifts in recent economic policies almost evoke the impression of a trial and error approach. The consequences of distinctively different options (across countries and periods) can be observed in a way almost similar to a laboratory situation. Such unique opportunity has attracted economists, particularly those interested in institutional economics, to conduct research on CEE. However, this also means that the experiences made in CEEC can enhance the general understanding of what markets can do and what the limitations of market coordination are. This volume contains selected contributions presented at IAMO Forum 2005 and gives an overview of the major topics discussed there. Partial analyses of specific economic problems usually abstract from the general economic framework which is assumed to be more or less constant as expressed in ceteris paribus clauses. Oftentimes, the set of institutional conditions is even assumed to be sufficiently well-described by the framework used in neoclassical models. Particularly for transition countries, this has frequently led to spurious results because crucial aspects of the framework actually in place were not considered, and sometimes were not even thought of. An extreme and very obvious example is the neglect of the effects of the replacement of monetary by nonmonetary exchange in phases of a barter economy. There is no generic approach to avoid unintended omission of crucial framework conditions, but it must generally be emphasised that a broad look at the various interdependent markets and at the entire socioeconomic context of a country is needed before going into detail. Descriptive analyses of the situation in various markets form part of such a broad look. The contributions of POPP, FERTÃ et al., WILKIN et al., and HEIN in the chapter Selected analyses from CEEC provide excellent examples, and focus on market developments in new EU member countries. On the one hand, the papers show the heterogeneity of problems e. g. due to largely differing farm structures. On the other hand, several common patterns can be observed: The market shares and power of large processors and retailers (hypermarkets, etc.) are increasing. Also, international (especially intra-EU) trade in commodities has increased in response to CAP-induced price harmonisation. Both tendencies weaken the market position of farmers, particularly small entities which cannot supply in volumes sufficient for large processing and trade firms. Within the food industry concentration increased as many smaller firms could not comply with EU processing standards and had to quit the market. The increased size and specialization of large producers, as well as of large processors, made many of those firms co-ordinate business with each other through long-term contractual agreements rather than by relying on spot markets. This tendency is very distinct in the fruit and vegetable sector, as WILKINâs contribution describes. Two contributions draw attention to the institutional framework itself, mainly by looking at circumstances which prevent market allocation from leading to an optimal outcome. HOBBS describes factors that impede investment and growth by drawing on transaction cost economics. Situations typical for transition countries are highlighted where e. g. transparency is not sufficient or the existence and reliable enforcement of contract or corporate law are not guaranteed. NUPPENAU stresses the need for the appropriate and precise formulation of land property rights, which should evoke a balance between governance and exclusion. The importance of appropriate and reliable institutions to avoid flaws is emphasised. But even with suitable institutions, transaction costs cannot be reduced to zero. The main reason for this is that since agents may gain form a head start of information, incentives to reveal their knowledge are quite restricted. Furthermore, some of the information required to make correct decisions is not available. This especially concerns information regarding all future contingencies. An uncertain future and the asymmetric distribution of information impose special problems when decisions have long-term effects and agents are linked together through investment decisions. This offers possibilities for opportunistic behaviour, i. e., when an agent behaves in a way that allows him to extract rents from the partners' activities. The friction induced in such situations may result in a market outcome that is biased by transaction costs. Mitigating this bias should be a goal of public policy but it is also in the interest of (at least some of the) private agents involved. This issue is discussed in more detail in the papers dealing with alternative governance structures. A number of contributions to IAMO Forum highlight approaches for measuring the well-functioning of markets. While studies that aim to directly measure transaction costs are very rare and are necessarily limited to comparing only very specific portions of transaction costs, most studies focus on indirect indicators. These usually start from the idea that in a well-functioning, competitive market any supply or demand shocks are reflected in price changes, not only in the particular market where the shock occurs but also in other, related markets, i. e., in different locations or at different stages of the production and marketing chain. Consequently, an approach for assessing the functioning of markets is to compare price differentials with processing-, marketing- or transfer-costs, or â since these costs are usually difficult to quantify â to observe price differentials over time. Accepting the assumption that the costs reflected by price differentials are more or less constant (or stationary) over the observed time span, any additional price changes or a lack of price co-movement is interpreted as an indication for insufficiently connected or insufficiently functioning markets. Three contributions in the chapter Analytical approaches for measuring market efficiency describe analyses which mainly focus on the vertical dimension, i. e., between market stages. BOJNEC, in his descriptive price analysis for several agricultural products in Slovenia since 1991, finds a heterogeneous development of the farm gate/consumer price spread: The processing and marketing margins increased for wheat and beef while they declined for grapes (processed to wine), sugar and poultry. BRÃMMER and ZORYA, as well as BAKUCS and FERTÃ, use cointegration analysis to describe the degree and nature of vertical price integration in the Ukrainian wheat market and the Hungarian pork market, respectively. Both studies find that price changes are transmitted vertically, that there is a tendency to "correct" any deviations from some underlying equilibrium price-relationship. However, such error correction mechanisms are found not to be a constant, universal force. In the Hungarian paper, it could only be found for a sub-period of the observed time span, excluding the highly volatile early 1990 s. Also, equilibrium was found to be achieved by adjustment of farm gate prices only while the retail prices were found to be exogenous, i. e., not responding to any disequilibrium. The paper on Ukraine shows that adjustment processes between wheat and wheat flour prices cannot be|$|R

50|$|Even more importantly, the Third Anglo-Dutch War {{temporarily}} interrupted VOC {{trade with}} Europe. This caused {{a spike in}} the price of pepper, which enticed the English East India Company (EIC) to enter this market aggressively in the years after 1672. Previously, one of the tenets of the VOC pricing policy was to slightly over-supply the pepper market, so as to depress prices below the level where interlopers were encouraged to enter the market (instead of striving for short-term <b>profit</b> <b>maximisation).</b> The wisdom of such a policy was illustrated when a fierce price war with the EIC ensued, as that company flooded the market with new supplies from India. In this struggle for market share, the VOC (which had much larger financial resources) could wait out the EIC. Indeed, by 1683, the latter came close to bankruptcy; its share price plummeted from 600 to 250; and its president Josiah Child was temporarily forced from office.|$|E
40|$|Students employ {{marginal}} analysis in investigating various problems regarding resource allocation. The majority of first-year students, however, seem to struggle in applying it to a firm's <b>profit</b> <b>maximisation</b> problem. Their confusion appears {{to stem from}} textbooks for introductory microeconomics courses oversimplifying some subtle points regarding the <b>profit</b> <b>maximisation</b> problem. This paper (1) points out how oversimplification may impede students' understanding, contrary to the instructors' pedagogical intent, and (2) suggests a complementary method to enhance their understanding of {{marginal analysis}} {{in the course of}} teaching a firm's <b>profit</b> <b>maximisation</b> problem. ...|$|E

40|$|Today many {{textbooks}} use {{the aggregate}} demand/aggregate supply analysis {{to convey the}} basics of Keynesian analysis of aggregate demand {{in conjunction with the}} <b>profit</b> <b>maximisation</b> postulate as characterising the aggregate supply side. However, this construction suffers from logical inconsistency, as the assumption of <b>profit</b> <b>maximisation</b> constraining firms through rising marginal costs of the ‘supply side’ is not easy to reconcile with the Keynesian postulate of output constrained by aggregate demand. This work follows a prominent line of reasoning to abandon the conventional AD curve altogether {{and replace it with a}} construct which seeks to remedy the inconsistency. This is achieved by assigning the central role to <b>profit</b> <b>maximisation</b> on the supply side, while the role of effective demand in the output determination is pushed to the background...|$|E
40|$|A {{survey was}} carried out among two groups of {{undergraduate}} economics students and four groups of students in mathematics, law, philosophy and business administration. The main survey question involved a conflict between <b>profit</b> <b>maximisation</b> and {{the welfare of the}} workers who would be fired to achieve it. Significant {{differences were found between the}} choices of the groups. The results were reinforced by a survey conducted among readers of an Israeli business newspaper and PhD students of Harvard. It is argued that the overly mathematical methods used to teach economics encourage students to lean towards <b>profit</b> <b>maximisation.</b> Copyright 2006 Royal Economic Society. ...|$|E
40|$|This paper reports an {{alternative}} approach to the estimation of aggregate production response. The principles of the nonparametric analysis of production data are outlined. The weak axiom of variable <b>profit</b> <b>maximisation</b> is introduced and used to define netput schedules. Data from the National Cereals Survey are {{used as the basis}} for the estimation of nonparametric schedules for cereal outputs and variable inputs. The results indicate that the sample is consistent with an assumption of variable <b>profit</b> <b>maximisation</b> and that, under an assump-tion of input fixity, the response of the main cereals to own-price changes is inelastic...|$|E
40|$|This work {{analyses}} a managerial delegation {{model in}} which firms choose between two production technologies: a low marginal cost technology and a high marginal cost technology. For the former to be adopted more investment is needed than for the later. By giving managers of firms an incentive scheme based on a linear combination of profit and sales revenue, we find that Bertrand competition provides a stronger incentive to adopt the cost-saving technology than the strict <b>profit</b> <b>maximisation</b> case. However, the results may be reversed under Cournot competition. If the degree of product substitutability is sufficiently low (high), the incentive to adopt the cost-saving technology is larger under strict <b>profit</b> <b>maximisation</b> (strategic delegation).
