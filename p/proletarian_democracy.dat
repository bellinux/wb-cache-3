25|$|In 1978, Peppino Impastato {{stood as}} a {{candidate}} in the Cinisi council elections for <b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy</b> (Democrazia proletaria). He was killed during the election campaign {{on the night of}} May 8–9, by a charge of TNT placed under his body, which had been stretched over the local railway line – a sinister twist of fate to the car-bomb that had killed his uncle and initiated Peppino's revolt against the Mafia. The same day, Christian-Democrat former Prime Minister Aldo Moro's corpse was discovered on via Caetani in Rome. Two days later voters in Cinisi elected him as a councillor.|$|E
2500|$|On 16 March 1978, {{the very}} day of the {{kidnapping}} of Moro, Andreotti's cabinet obtained the vote of confidence: it was voted for by all the Italian parties, {{with the exception of}} the Social Movement, the Liberal Party (the first a far right party, the second a centre-right one), the Radical Party and of <b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy</b> (the latter being left/far left formations). The executive was formed exclusively by members from DC and could govern only with the indirect support of PCI (the so-called [...] "non-no confidence").|$|E
2500|$|In {{the article}} [...] "Marxism is a Universal Truth, not a 'Universal Value'" [...] (published in Party Building in 2013) Wang Ningyou states that {{democracy}} is not a universal value since the meaning of democracy (and how it should work) changes from which class perspective one has. He claims that the two main forms of democracy, socialist democracy (<b>proletarian</b> <b>democracy)</b> and capitalist democracy (bourgeoisie democracy) are both diametrically opposite; socialist democracy allows the people to master their own affairs while capitalist democracy, Wang contends, [...] "guarantees the freedom of capital to exploit and suppress [...] ". The use of qualifiers {{in front of the}} word of democracy is important as to highlight the class nature of the different forms of democracy Wang contends, and concludes that [...] "One sort of pure democracy, common democracy or 'universal democracy' that all of humanity identifies with has never existed in human societies".|$|E
50|$|Several countries, {{including}} the Soviet Union and Maoist China {{have been described}} by journalists and scholars as Authoritarian Socialist states. However, neither state used the term 'authoritarian socialist' to describe themselves — these states declared themselves to be <b>Proletarian</b> or People's <b>Democracies.</b>|$|R
6000|$|The {{need for}} the Superman is, in its most {{imperative}} aspect, a political one. We have been driven to <b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy</b> {{by the failure of}} all the alternative systems; for these depended on the existence of Supermen acting as despots or oligarchs; and not only were these Supermen not always or even often forthcoming at the right moment and in an eligible social position, but when they were forthcoming they could not, except for a short time and by morally suicidal coercive methods, impose superhumanity on those whom they governed; so, by mere force of [...] "human nature," [...] government by consent of the governed has supplanted the old plan of governing the citizen as a public-schoolboy is governed.|$|E
6000|$|If {{there were}} no God, said the eighteenth century Deist, it would be {{necessary}} to invent Him. Now this XVIII century god was deus ex machina, the god who helped those who could not help themselves, the god of the lazy and incapable. The nineteenth century decided that there is indeed no such god; and now Man must take in hand all the work that he used to shirk with an idle prayer. He must, in effect, change himself into the political Providence which he formerly conceived as god; and such change is not only possible, but the only sort of change that is real. The mere transfiguration of institutions, as from military and priestly dominance to commercial and scientific dominance, from commercial dominance to <b>proletarian</b> <b>democracy,</b> from slavery to serfdom, from serfdom to capitalism, from monarchy to republicanism, from polytheism to monotheism, from monotheism to atheism, from atheism to pantheistic humanitarianism, from general illiteracy to general literacy, from romance to realism, from realism to mysticism, from metaphysics to physics, are all but changes from Tweedledum to Tweedledee: plus ça change, plus c'est la même chose. But the changes from the crab apple to the pippin, from the wolf and fox to the house dog, from the charger of Henry V to the brewer's draught horse and the race-horse, are real; for here Man has played the god, subduing Nature to his intention, and ennobling or debasing Life for a set purpose. And what can be done with a wolf can be done with a man. If such monsters as the tramp and the gentleman can appear as mere by-products of Man's individual greed and folly, what might we not hope for as a main product of his universal aspiration? ...|$|E
6000|$|Now we {{have yet}} to see the man who, having any {{practical}} experience of <b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy,</b> has any belief in its capacity for solving great political problems, or even for doing ordinary parochial work intelligently and economically. Only under despotisms and oligarchies has the Radical faith in [...] "universal suffrage" [...] as a political panacea arisen. It withers the moment it is exposed to practical trial, because Democracy cannot rise above the level of the human material of which its voters are made. Switzerland seems happy in comparison with Russia; but if Russia were as small as Switzerland, and had her social problems simplified in the same way by impregnable natural fortifications and a population educated by the same variety and intimacy of international intercourse, there might be little to choose between them. At all events Australia and Canada, which are virtually protected democratic republics, and France and the United States, which are avowedly independent democratic republics, are neither healthy, wealthy, nor wise; and they would be worse instead of better if their popular ministers were not experts in the art of dodging popular enthusiasms and duping popular ignorance. The politician who once {{had to learn how to}} flatter Kings has now to learn how to fascinate, amuse, coax, humbug, frighten, or otherwise strike the fancy of the electorate; and though in advanced modern States, where the artizan is better educated than the King, it takes a much bigger man to be a successful demagogue than to be a successful courtier, yet he who holds popular convictions with prodigious energy is the man for the mob, whilst the frailer sceptic who is cautiously feeling his way towards the next century has no chance unless he happens by accident to have the specific artistic talent of the mountebank as well, in which case it is as a mountebank that he catches votes, and not as a meliorist. Consequently the demagogue, though he professes (and fails) to readjust matters in the interests of the majority of the electors, yet stereotypes mediocrity, organizes intolerance, disparages exhibitions of uncommon qualities, and glorifies conspicuous exhibitions of common ones. He manages a small job well: he muddles rhetorically through a large one. When a great political movement takes place, it is not consciously led nor organized: the unconscious self in mankind breaks its way through the problem as an elephant breaks through a jungle; and the politicians make speeches about whatever happens in the process, which, with the best intentions, they do all in their power to prevent. Finally, when social aggregation arrives at a point demanding international organization before the demagogues and electorates have learnt how to manage even a country parish properly much less internationalize Constantinople, the whole political business goes to smash; and presently we have Ruins of Empires, New Zealanders sitting on a broken arch of London Bridge, and so forth.|$|E
6000|$|Here, then, as {{it seems}} to them, is an {{enormous}} field for the energy of the reformer. Here are many noble goals attainable by many of those paths up the Hill Difficulty along which great spirits love to aspire. Unhappily, the hill will never be climbed by Man as we know him. It need not be denied that if we all struggled bravely {{to the end of the}} reformers' paths we should improve the world prodigiously. But there is no more hope in that If than in the equally plausible assurance that if the sky falls we shall all catch larks. We are not going to tread those paths: we have not sufficient energy. We do not desire the end enough: indeed in more cases we do not effectively desire it at all. Ask any man would he like to be a better man; and he will say yes, most piously. Ask him would he like to have a million of money; and he will say yes, most sincerely. But the pious citizen who would like to be a better man goes on behaving just as he did before. And the tramp who would like the million does not take the trouble to earn ten shillings: multitudes of men and women, all eager to accept a legacy of a million, live and die without having ever possessed five pounds at one time, although beggars have died in rags on mattresses stuffed with gold which they accumulated because they desired it enough to nerve them to get it and keep it. The economists who discovered that demand created supply soon had to limit the proposition to [...] "effective demand," [...] which turned out, in the final analysis, to mean nothing more than supply itself; and this holds good in politics, morals, and all other departments as well: the actual supply is the measure of the effective demand; and the mere aspirations and professions produce nothing. No community has ever yet passed beyond the initial phases in which its pugnacity and fanaticism enabled it to found a nation, and its cupidity to establish and develop a commercial civilization. Even these stages have never been attained by public spirit, but always by intolerant wilfulness and brute force. Take the Reform Bill of 1832 as an example of a conflict between two sections of educated Englishmen concerning a political measure which was as obviously necessary and inevitable as any political measure has ever been or is ever likely to be. It was not passed until the gentlemen of Birmingham had made arrangements to cut the throats of the gentlemen of St. James's parish in due military form. It would not have been passed to this day if there had been no force behind it except the logic and public conscience of the Utilitarians. A despotic ruler with as much sense as Queen Elizabeth would have done better than the mob of grown-up Eton boys who governed us then by privilege, and who, since the introduction of practically Manhood Suffrage in 1884, now govern us at the request of <b>proletarian</b> <b>Democracy.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Emilio Molinari (born 12 November 1939 in Milan) is an Italian politician. From 1984-1985 {{he served}} as a Member of the European Parliament, {{representing}} Italy for <b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy</b> ...|$|E
50|$|During the 1976 general elections, PdUP ran {{together}} with <b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy,</b> gaining 3 {{seats in the}} Italian Chamber of Deputies (Magri, Eliseo Milani and Luciana Castellina) elected out of the coalition's 9.|$|E
50|$|It {{was founded}} in May 1989 by {{splinters}} of <b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy</b> (Mario Capanna, Virginio Bettini, Gianni Tamino, Edo Ronchi and Paolo Gentiloni) and some leading Radicals (Adelaide Aglietta, Adele Faccio, Francesco Rutelli, Franco Corleone and Marco Boato).|$|E
50|$|In 1975 {{he entered}} politics, {{adhering}} to the Proletarian Unity Party (PdUP), which later merged with <b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy</b> (DP). Capanna was charismatic leader of the latter until June 27, 1987, when he resigned, succeeded by Giovanni Russo Spena.|$|E
5000|$|The Socialist-Communist parties must {{attempt to}} create a <b>proletarian</b> <b>democracy</b> that will {{eliminate}} class by abolishing economic privilege, and of which the organs are soviets, i.e. peasant and worker councils - a new type of organisation governing itself.|$|E
50|$|In January 1977, the Manifesto and former-PSIUP {{affiliates}} {{left the}} party {{due to the}} failure in creating an all-left government. On February 20, 1977 the left-wing minority tendency broke away to join <b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy</b> in its founding process as organized party.|$|E
50|$|Signatures and {{petitions}} for {{the referendum}} {{were collected by}} the Italian Communist Party. It found {{the support of the}} <b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy</b> and the Federation of the Greens on the left side, but also of the Italian Social Movement on the opposite faction.|$|E
5000|$|When {{much of the}} Italian {{far left}} formed the {{organisation}} Democrazia Proletaria (<b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy)</b> the LCR joined it as a recognised faction.

50|$|From the split, {{he led the}} {{formation}} of the Partido ng Manggagawang Pilipino (Filipino Workers' Party), an underground revolutionary socialist party, which, after his death, merged with the Sosyalistang Partido ng Paggawa (Socialist Party of Labor) and the Partido para sa Proletaryong Demokrasya (Party for <b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy).</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{difference}} between people's democracy and Soviet democracy allowed the USSR {{to maintain a}} position of superiority as the only pure <b>proletarian</b> <b>democracy.</b> Nikita Khrushchev explicitly stated {{that the possibility of}} peaceful transition to people's democracy was predicated in the global strength of the USSR as a superpower.|$|E
50|$|In 1991, {{when the}} Italian Communist Party (PCI), led by Achille Occhetto, became the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS), dissidents led by Armando Cossutta {{launched}} the PRC.

50|$|Most {{members of}} CU {{were from the}} Proletarian Unity Party (PdUP). This party left <b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy</b> in 1984 and merged with the Italian Communist Party (PCI), only to leave it when the PCI became the Democratic Party of the Left (PDS) in 1991. At that time most ex-PdUP members joined the PRC.|$|E
50|$|Member of the Regional Council of Lombardy for extremist <b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy</b> since 1985, {{he worked}} at {{university}} level and for the Italian Confederation of Workers' Trade Unions.

50|$|In April 2008, {{following}} the severe {{defeat of the}} party in the 2008 general election, a group of former Bertinottiani, composed basically of former members of <b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy</b> and led by Paolo Ferrero and Giovanni Russo Spena, criticized The Left - The Rainbow alliance and the political line of Fausto Bertinotti. In that occasion they allied with the other minority factions in order to force Secretary Franco Giordano to resign.|$|E
50|$|The {{party was}} founded in January 2015 by Gaetano Armao, a former {{regional}} minister of Economy under President Raffaele Lombardo, and Rino Piscitello, a long-time politician (Proletarian Unity Party, <b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy,</b> The Network, The Democrats, Democracy is Freedom, Democratic Party) who had lately been the secretary of Lombardo's Party of Sicilians. The party aimed at the transformation of Sicily into a nation confederated to Italy or an independent country.|$|E
50|$|The Reale Law was {{approved}} by the Parliament in 1975 and defined the powers and engagement of the Italian police during riots or simple street protests. The referendum was called by the Radical Party and supported by two extreme opposition parties, the Italian Social Movement on the right side, and <b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy</b> on the left, together with the Italian Liberal Party, while all other parties, including the Italian Communist Party, supported retaining the law.|$|E
50|$|When he was 18, Atalmi joined <b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy</b> and, later, the Communist Refoundation Party {{of which}} he was a member until 1998, when he {{switched}} to the newly formed Party of Italian Communists. In 2004 he entered the Regional Council of Veneto, replacing Severino Galante. In the 2005 regional election he was elected for a full term in the Council, but was not re-elected in 2010. Atalmi was later active in Left Ecology Freedom.|$|E
50|$|The other {{question}} concerned the party funding Piccoli Law {{was the subject}} of one question. The new law was passed by the Parliament in 1974, establishing public funding of the parliamentary parties in an attempt to stop the funding of parties big industrial groups and interests.

50|$|The {{other group}} had {{its origins in}} the Gruppi Comunisti Rivoluzionari, the Italian party {{affiliated}} with the United Secretariat of the Fourth International. This group left in 1976 in protest over the LCRs endorsement of the <b>Proletarian</b> <b>Democracy</b> electoral coalition, which it regarded {{as a kind of}} popular front. This group first called itself the Bolshevik-Leninist Group for the Reconstruction of the Fourth International. It adopted the name Trotkyist League of Italy in April 1978, bey which time it had absorbed the Spartacist Nucleus. It also attempted to unify with the ex-Lambertist Bolshevik-Leninist Group of Italy, but nothing came of this.|$|E
