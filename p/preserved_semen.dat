Semen was collected from mature boars and cryopreserved in experimental extenders supplemented with or without 105 μM of RA. Multiparous sows were inseminated with a single dose of semen when vulvar skin temperature decreased to a value below 35 °C. Intrauterine insemination was performed using 1. 5 × 10 9 spermatozoa. The sows were slaughtered 48 h after AI and the embryos and oocytes were recovered from the oviducts.

The aim of the present study was to determine if there are differences associated with sperm head morphometric dimensions in individuals with different sexual maturity ratings. For the present results, there was setting off ram groups depending on age: 12, 36 and 72 months of age. There were used random images from fresh sperm and each head spermatozoon was measured with the aid of a specialized soft for four primary parameters (length, L; area, A; width, W and perimeter, P) and four derived parameters (ellipticity, L/W; rugosity, 4 πA/P 2; elongation, L–W/L+W and regularity, πLW/ 4 A). The analyzed data were statistically processed, being recorded the main population parameters: the average, its error, the standard deviation, the coefficient of variability. There were no significant differences in the sperm head dimension or shape among middle-aged and old individuals (P > 0. 05). However, significant differences were detected in area, perimeter and width (lower values) and length, ellipticity and elongation (higher values) in old or middle-aged individuals compared with young individuals (P < 0. 01). As a conclusion, this study confirms that ram age is related to sperm morphometric size. Therefore, the present study provides information regarding the maturation of ram sperm and supports the idea that the dimensions of ram spermatozoa may be taken as an approximate indication of its relative maturity...|$|E

In addition, the study sought to determine the incidence of surgery-induced sexual dysfunction to evaluate the economic efficiency of semen cryopreservation as compared with alternatives such as microsurgical epididymal sperm aspiration. Preoperative and postoperative semen analyses were offered to 97 {{patients with}} ileal pouch-anal anastomosis with benign colorectal diseases since 1989. The direct costs of the semen cryopreservation program were determined and compared with those of alternatives. In 34 of 40 consecutive patients with ileal pouch-anal anastomosis who made use of preoperative semen preservation, normal sperm concentrations, motility, and morphology were found. Mean semen characteristics of all 23 patients who returned for postoperative analysis were not different from preoperative values, but they were for total sperm number.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of determining both fresh and <b>preserved</b> <b>semen</b> quality in vitro is of major im-portance to artificial insemination practice. The current {{methods used to}} evaluate semen quality allow only one characteristic, structural property or element of sperm metabolism to be investigated. Moreover, the results obtained by these methods correlate with the fertilizing capacity of sperma-tozoa only to a certain extent. This calls for new research methods {{that can be used}} to determine semen quality. A promising methodological solution in this area is the use of photon emission (luminescence) meas-urements. It has been known for a long time that living cells emit light spontaneously without any external excitation. This ultraweak photon emis-sion, attributable to oxidative metabolic reactions, is noticeably enhanced under oxidative stress con-ditions and is decreased by in vitro addition of anti-oxidants (Boveris et al., 1980; Gonzalez-Flecha et al., 1991; Sławiński et al., 1992). Earlier studies of this biophysical phenomenon showed an extremely low emission intensity of bull, ram and boar sper-matozoa and a {{possibility of}} inducing emissions of much higher intensity with Fe ions (Laszczka et al., 1995). Measurements of the spectral distribu-tion of sperm emission and analysis of the relation-ships between the concentration of Fe ions and the intensity of induced luminescence show that it is strictly related to lipid peroxidation (Sławiński et al., 1998; Gogol, 2005), which is one of the basic biochemical processes accelerating the ageing of spermatozoa, especially during semen preserva-tion (Cecil and Bakst, 1993; Cerolini et al., 2000). In lipid peroxidation, which is a chain free radical process, the generated reactive oxygen species, by initiating further peroxidation reactions, can cause serious damage to the cells and significantly change their structure and metabolism. Reactive oxygen species were shown to cause membrane deteriora-tion, resulting in ATP depletion (De Lamiranda an...|$|E

Twenty-four boars of the Large White, Landrace, Pietrain and Duroc breeds of optimal breeding age (on average 2. 5 years old) were used. The study lasted 90 days. The boars were randomly assigned to one of three dietary treatment groups: T 1 =control; no added selenium (n= 8 boars), T 2 =added 0. 3 ppm inorganic selenium (sodium selenite, Microgran® Se 1 % BMP) (n= 8 boars), and T 3 =added 0. 3 ppm organic selenium (Se-yeast, Sel-Plex 2000 ®) (n= 8 boars). The concentration of selenium was determined in whole blood and semen, while the activity of glutathione peroxidase (GPx) was measured in blood plasma and semen. In order to measure GPx activity in semen, reactivation of the enzymatic GPx activity was performed. The determined selenium concentration in blood was lowest in the non-supplemented group of boars. Blood plasma GPx activity was higher in boars fed organic selenium than in boars fed a diet without supplemented selenium. While the supplementation of sodium selenite significantly increased GPx activity in boar semen. The highest-concentration of selenium in semen at the end of the trial was determined in the group of boars supplemented with organic selenium, somewhat lower in boars fed supplemented inorganic selenium, and the lowest in the non-supplemented group of boars. The only significant difference between the selenite and Se-yeast diet supplementation was observed in the Se concentration of the semen. The supplementation of selenium affected semen quality, and organic selenium improved the progressive motility of the spermatozoa and increased their resistance in hypo-osmotic and thermal tests.

40|$|Artificial {{insemination}} (AI) is {{the preferred}} method for reproduction {{in the majority of}} the intensive pig production systems Worldwide. To this end, fresh extended ready-to-use semen doses are either purchased from AI-centres or produced by boars kept on-farm. For profitable semen production, it is necessary to obtain a maximum amount of high quality semen from each boar. This paper reviews current knowledge on factors that may affect semen quality by influencing the boar or the semen during processing. Genetic markers could be used for early detection of boars with the highest fertility potential. Genetic selection for fast growth might jeopardize semen quality. Early detection of boars no longer fit for semen production might be possible by ultrasonography of the testes. Seasonal variation in sperm quality could be associated with changes in photoperiod and heat stress during summer. Comfortable housing, with appropiate bedding material to avoid locomotion problems is essential. In some areas, cooling systems may be necessary to avoid heat stress. The sperm quality can be manipulated by feeding strategies aiming, for instance, to increase sperm resistance to oxidative stress and extend storage duration. High collection frequency will negatively influence sperm quality. Also, if collection is not hygienically performed it will result in bacterial contamination of the semen doses. The concern over bacterial contamination has risen not only because of its negative effect on semen quality but also due to the detection of antimicrobial resistance in isolates from extended semen. Moreover, bacterial and viral pathogens must be monitored because they affect semen production and quality and constitute a risk of herd infection. During processing, boar sperm are submitted to many stress factors that can cause oxidative stress and capacitation-like changes potentially reducing their fertility potential. Dilution rate or dilution temperature affects the quality of the semen doses.

The experimental group started with 14 captive males, but only 11 were suitable to collect ejaculates containing sperm. After anesthesia, both testes were evaluated: length, width, height, and testicular circumference. Semen was collected by electroejaculation and evaluated, followed by dilution, cooling, and freezing. Seminal parameters and sperm motility, vigor, plasma membrane integrity, and normal morphology were evaluated after each step; functionality was also checked in fresh and frozen–thawed sperm. Sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity, and normal sperm in cooled semen (n =  11) were 44. 1  ±  34. 0, 63. 1  ±  15. 6, and 73. 8  ±  19. 8, respectively, with vigor ranging of 2 to 3. Sperm motility, plasma membrane integrity, normal and functional sperm in frozen semen (n =  5) were 0. 6  ±  1. 3 (1. 5 % and 3 % GLY); 4. 4  ±  4. 9 (1. 5 % GLY) and 6. 6  ±  7. 2 (3 % GLY); 86. 8  ±  3. 0 (1. 5 % GLY) and 88. 8  ±  5. 1 (3 % GLY); 13. 3  ±  11. 9 (1. 5 % GLY) and 14. 3  ±  13. 5 (3 % GLY), respectively, and vigor 0 for both 1. 5 % and 3 % GLY.

The {{objective was to}} evaluate cryopreservation methods for effectiveness in promoting cryosurvival and post-thaw function of sperm from five turkey lines: one commercial line and four research (RBC 1; E; RBC 2; F) lines from Ohio State University (OSU). The model for cryopreservation was set up as a 2 × 2 × 2 × 5 design for cryoprotectant (glycerol or dimethylacetamide (DMA)), cryopreservation medium (Lake or ASG), method of dilution (fixed dilution volume versus fixed sperm concentration) and turkey line, respectively. The final cryoprotectant concentrations were 11 % glycerol or 6 % DMA. Thawed sperm were evaluated for plasma membrane integrity and quality, motility, acrosome integrity and, after artificial insemination, for egg fertility and hatchability. Commercial turkey hens were used for all fertility trials, regardless of semen source. Turkey sperm frozen with glycerol exhibited higher membrane integrity and membrane quality upon thawing than turkey sperm frozen with DMA although no differences in total motility, and only minimal differences in progressive motility, were detected among the eight cryopreservation treatments. Within line, fertility was affected by cryoprotectant, medium and dilution method, where the overall highest percentages of fertile, viable embryos (Day 7) occurred for the DMA/ASG/fixed sperm concentration method, while high percentages (15. 8 – 31. 5 %) of fertile, non-viable embryos (Day 1 – 6) were observed for multiple cryopreservation methods, including two glycerol treatments. From a single insemination, the duration of true and viable fertility in all lines was 10 – 13 weeks and 9 – 10 weeks, respectively. The duration of hatchability was 4 – 6 weeks after insemination for four of the turkey lines.

In 10 of 11 semen samples extended in autologous seminal plasma, motility had already decreased to 0 % by Day 2, and the percentage of spermatozoa with intact membranes was lower than in the 3 extenders (P 0. 05). Egg-yolk Tris extender seems to be superior to the other extenders tested, to <b>preserve</b> dog <b>semen</b> at 4 degrees C, although differences were not significant for all the parameters...|$|R
40|$|Various semen {{extender}} formulas are in use {{to maintain}} sperm longevity and quality whilst acting against bacterial contamination in liquid sperm preservation. Aminoglycosides are commonly supplemented {{to aid in}} the control of bacteria. As bacterial resistance is increasing worldwide, antimicrobial peptides (AMPs) received lively interest as alternatives to overcome multi-drug resistant bacteria. We investigated, whether synthetic cationic AMPs might be a suitable alternative for conventional antibiotics in liquid boar sperm preservation. The antibacterial activity of two cyclic AMPs (c-WWW, c-WFW) and a helical magainin II amide analog (MK 5 E) was studied in vitro against two Gram-positive and eleven Gram-negative bacteria. Isolates included ATCC reference strains, multi-resistant E. coli and bacteria cultured from boar semen. Using broth microdilution, minimum inhibitory concentrations were determined for all AMPs. All AMPs revealed activity towards the majority of bacteria but not against Proteus spp. (all AMPs) and Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (MK 5 E). We could also demonstrate that c-WWW and c-WFW were effective against bacterial growth in liquid <b>preserved</b> boar <b>semen</b> in situ, especially when combined {{with a small amount of}} gentamicin. Our results suggest that albeit not offering a complete alternative to traditional antibiotics, the use of AMPs offers a promising solution to decrease the use of conventional antibiotics and thereby limit the selection of multi-resistant strains...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to test the effect of four different diluents on the motility of goat semen stored at room and refrigerator temperatures. To achieve this objective, four West African dwarf bucks aged 10 - 12 months were ejaculated weekly for five weeks using the electro-ejaculator method. The ejaculated semen were extended using four diluents namely sodium citrate (T 1), sodium bicarbonate plus glucose (T 2), sodium citrate plus glycine (T 3), and glucose plus glycine (T 4). Two storage conditions namely refrigerator temperature (5 ºC) and room temperature (25 ºC) were used. The semen was evaluated for colour, volume and motility before extending them with the diluents. Subsequently, motility was monitored for four days. The results indicated that storage days and type of extender were highly significant (p< 0. 01) thoroughout the period. The highest motility was obtained during the first day of storage, thereafter, the motility declined drastically from day 2 to day 4. Sodium citrate <b>preserved</b> bucks <b>semen</b> better than the other extenders. This was followed by sodium bicarbonate plus glucose. Refrigerator temperature was significantly (p< 0. 05, p< 0. 01) better than room temperature in the preservation of bucks sperm motility. The semen stored in sodium citrate under refrigerator temperature maintained the highest spermatozoa motility throughout the period compared with the other storage conditions. It was concluded that goat <b>semen</b> can be <b>preserved</b> for 24 h in sodium citrate under refrigerator temperature...|$|R
40|$|Lower {{fertility}} of <b>preserved</b> stallion <b>semen</b> may {{be caused}} by damage to the spermatozoa or premature capacitation during storage. We investigated the use of the flavonoid, quercetin, with a standard skim milk extender for storage of stallion spermatozoa to prevent premature capacitation and acrosome reaction and to reduce the damage to spermatozoa from lipid peroxidation. Several concentrations of quercetin (0. 05, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3 mM) were mixed with skim milk-glucose extender, and the antioxidant effectiveness was assessed using xanthine-xanthine oxidase challenge for 21 h. The effect of quercetin on capacitation status of sperm was assessed during a 4 h incubation at 33 C, and a storage trial at 5 C for 6 days. In addition, the ability of sperm stored in quercetin extender to undergo capacitation and acrosome reaction was assessed using heparin and A 23187. Lipid peroxidation in the sperm after challenge was inhibited by any concentration of quercetin in the medium, while 0. 1 and 0. 3 mM queicetin were most effective at preventing capacitation and acrosome reaction during a 33 C incubation. During storage at 5 degrees C for 6 d, quercetin addition to the extender significantly reduced the proportion of sperm capacitation. Heparin had no effect on capacitation status in either extender, but A 23187 increased the proportion of sperm stored in the quercetin extender undergoing capacitation and acrosome reaction. In conclusion, quercetin in the standard skim milk-glucose extender for equine semen during storage reduces lipid peroxidation of the sperm, maintains internal adenosine triphosphate (ATP) concentration, and prevents premature capacitation of sperm cells before insemination while still allowing the sperm to capacitate and acrosome react after insemination...|$|R
40|$|Reactive {{oxygen species}} (ROS) generation, {{induced by the}} {{cryopreservation}} process, can be responsible for mammalian sperm damage. Curcumin is known as an effective antioxidant against oxidative stress. The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effects of curcumin on sperm count, motility and viability, semen total antioxidant capacity and DNA integrity of rat spermatozoa during semen freeze-thawing process. Sperm collected from 10 adult rats were divided into two groups (n= 10 for each group) : control and a test group supplemented with 2. 5 mM curcumin. After freezing-thawing, the number of spermatozoa, motility, viability, total antioxidant capacity (TAC), and DNA integrity of the sperm were analyzed. Motility, viability and DNA integrity of sperm were significantly preserved in treatment groups compared to the control (p < 0. 05) after freezing-thawing. Following cryopreservation, TAC was significantly <b>preserved</b> in thawing <b>semen</b> supplemented with curcumin compared to the control group (p< 0. 05). Based on our results, it is concluded that curcumin addition during freezing resulted in positive effects on sperm parameters after thawing in adult rats...|$|R
40|$|Aim: An {{experiment}} {{was designed to}} evaluate the role of Vitamin E and glutathione in improving the seminal parameters during hypothermic storage of liquid semen at 4 °C for 72 h. Materials and Methods: Thirty-six semen ejaculates were collected by artificial vagina from 6 bucks (Beetal) during the normal reproduction season (September to November) at weekly interval. The samples were centrifuged, and the seminal plasma was removed. The sperm pellet was diluted with Tris-based extender and divided into three groups. Group T 1 : Control samples without antioxidants, Group T 2 : Samples supplemented with tocopherol at 3 mM, and Group T 3 : Samples supplemented with glutathione at 1 mM. The samples were evaluated for progressive motility, percent liveability, percent abnormal spermatozoa, and acrosome integrity after liquid preservation for 0, 24, 48, and 72 h. The level of lipid peroxidation and antioxidant enzymes, namely, glutathione peroxidase (GPx) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) were estimated after liquid preservation for 0 and 72 h. Results: It was observed that, after storage of semen at 4 °C up to 72 h, the progressive sperm motility, percent liveability, percent abnormal spermatozoa, and percent intact acrosomes were significantly (p< 0. 05) higher in group T 2 and T 3 samples as compared to control. However, the level of lipid peroxidation in T 2 and T 3 groups was significantly (p< 0. 05) lower after 72 h of incubation at 4 °C. Similarly, GPx and SOD values were significantly (p< 0. 05) increased in T 2 and T 3 groups after 72 h of storage at 4 °C. Conclusion: Thus, {{it can be concluded}} that Vitamin E and glutathione supplementation at 3 mM and 1 mM, respectively, while <b>preserving</b> the <b>semen</b> samples at 4 °C helped in maintaining the seminal parameters up to 72 h and protected the spermatozoa from oxidative damage...|$|R
40|$|The optimal storage {{temperature}} for <b>preserve</b> boar <b>semen</b> is 17 - 18 °C. The temperature fluctuations can decrease sperm viability. The {{aim of this}} study was to obtain a boar semen extender for Artificial Insemination (AI) at a certain distance area. The observation was based on the sperm viability in modified Beltsville Thawing Solution (BTS) extender in different storage, and the effect of storage system i. e. : room temperature (22 °C) and styrofoam box (18 °C) were conducted for this purpose. The research used a completely randomized design (CRD) with two factorial i. e. : BTS and M-BTS extender (F 1), room temperature and styrofoam box (F 2). Semen from three years old Yorkshire boars (n = 3) were collected twice a week by glove hand method. Semen characteristics and their quality were evaluated macro and microscopically. These semen were added with BTS and M-BTS extender up to fourfold volume (ratio 1 : 3). This is based on the assumption of AI dose of 2 - 3 x 109 cells/ 80 ml and the sperm motility and viability were evaluated every six hours for 24 hours observation. The results showed that fresh semen characteristics were good, with the percentage of sperm motility 65. 56 ± 2. 55 % and sperm viability of 87. 70 ± 2. 87 %. The best extender found in this experiment of 24 hours observation was BTS extender with sperm motility 53. 33 ± 3. 33 % in styrofoam box. In conclusion, BTS extender can maintain the quality of spermatozoa stored in styrofoam box for about 24 hours with sperm motility 40 %- 50 %, and the styrofoam box can be used as an alternative container for insemination program in the field...|$|R
40|$|Despite the new {{researches}} in boar semen cryopreservation, {{application of}} frozen-thawed (FT) semen in commercial artificial insemination (AI) programs is still limited. The {{main sources of}} semen used in AI are <b>semen</b> <b>preserved</b> on room temperature (RT) and sometimes fresh (F) semen. However, the use of male germplasm from genebank on some rare breeds is connected {{with the ability to}} use frozen semen.

Six sexually mature boars from Red Mangalitsa and Bazna rare breeds of the Faculty of Animal Sciences and Biotechnology, USAMV Cluj-Napoca, were used in this study. Semen was collected using the gloved-hand method, evaluated for conventional semen characteristics and extended in Beltsville Thawing Solution (BTS). Preservation was made by RT and by frozen using a modified method described by Westendorf et al. (1975), in lactose, egg yolk, glycerol and Orvus ES Paste extender (LEYGO).

40|$|This study {{investigated}} the effects of skim-milk supplementation on the quality and penetrating ability of boar <b>semen</b> <b>preserved</b> at 15 °C. When boar <b>semen</b> samples were <b>preserved</b> in Modified Modena extender supplemented with various concentrations (0, 7. 5, 15, 30 and 50 mg/mL) of skim milk powder at 15 °C for 4 weeks, higher sperm motility and viability were observed {{in the case of}} 7. 5 mg/mL skim-milk supplementation compared with the control group (0 mg/mL) during the preservation (P < 0. 05). When in vitro matured oocytes were co-incubated with boar sperm that had been preserved in Modified Modena extender with three different concentrations (0, 7. 5 or 15 mg/mL) of skim milk powder at 15 °C for two weeks, there were no apparent effects of skim-milk supplementation on the rates of fertilisation and development to blastocysts of oocytes after co-incubation. However, the monospermic fertilisation rate of sperm preserved with 15 mg/mL skim milk powder was higher (P < 0. 05) than that of fresh non-preserved sperm, but did not differ among the preservation groups. The results indicate that the supplementation of Modified Modena extender with 7. 5 mg/mL skim milk powder improves the motility and viability, but not the penetrating ability, of sperm after liquid preservation for at least two weeks...|$|R
