25|$|It {{starts to}} {{decompose}} at about 170°C and melts at 204°C. At room temperature, {{it is very}} stable. It burns rather than explodes. It detonates only with a detonator, being unaffected even by small arms fire. This property makes it a useful military explosive. It is less sensitive than <b>pentaerythritol</b> tetranitrate (PETN). Under normal conditions, RDX has a Figure of Insensitivity of exactly 80 (RDX defines the reference point.).|$|E
25|$|In the {{subsequent}} investigations at the site, which was cordoned off {{soon after the}} incident and screened by the investigating agencies, improvised explosive device (IED) was recovered from a metal dustbin, though no residue of the explosives, remains of any circuit or detonator were found, the device did not have shrapnel in it, thus there were no burn or shrapnel injuries, and all the injured were hit by pieces of wall that broke following the explosion, all suggesting the use of plastique explosive, PETN, TNT or C4. Early results revealed used of Semtex, a general-purpose plastic explosive containing RDX and <b>pentaerythritol</b> tetranitrate (PETN); however, the final report of the Forensic Science Institute, Gujarat is awaited.|$|E
25|$|The {{explosive}} mechanism was a gas-enhanced device {{consisting of}} compressed butane in canisters employed with <b>pentaerythritol</b> tetranitrate (PETN) {{to create a}} fuel-air explosive. The bomb was carried on a layer of concrete covered with a slab of marble to direct the blast upward. Despite the lack of sophistication and wide availability of its component parts, a gas-enhanced device can be a lethal weapon. These devices were similar to fuel-air or thermobaric weapons, explaining the large blast and damage. An after-action forensic investigation by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) determined that the bomb was so powerful that {{it probably would have}} brought down the building even if the sentries had managed to stop the truck between the gate and the building.|$|E
25|$|Trace {{amounts of}} {{explosive}} residue were detected on three samples of material from three separate {{locations of the}} recovered airplane wreckage (described by the FBI {{as a piece of}} canvas-like material and two pieces of a floor panel). These samples were submitted to the FBI's laboratory in Washington, D.C., which determined that one sample contained traces of cyclotrimethylenetrinitramine (RDX), another nitroglycerin, and the third a combination of RDX and <b>pentaerythritol</b> tetranitrate (PETN); these findings received much media attention at the time. In addition, the backs of several damaged passenger seats were observed to have an unknown red/brown-shaded substance on them. According to the seat manufacturer, the locations and appearance of this substance were consistent with adhesive used {{in the construction of the}} seats, and additional laboratory testing by NASA identified the substance as being consistent with adhesives.|$|E
25|$|China is {{the largest}} {{consumer}} of acetaldehyde in the world, accounting for almost half of global consumption in 2012. Major use has been the production of acetic acid. Other uses such as pyridines and <b>pentaerythritol</b> are expected to grow faster than acetic acid, but the volumes are not large enough to offset the decline in acetic acid. As a consequence, overall acetaldehyde consumption in China may grow slightly at 1.6% per year through 2018. Western Europe is the second-largest consumer of acetaldehyde worldwide, accounting for 20% of world consumption in 2012. As with China, the Western European acetaldehyde market {{is expected to increase}} only very slightly at 1% per year during 2012–2018. However, Japan could emerge as a potential consumer for acetaldehyde in next five years due to newfound use in commercial production of butadiene. The supply of butadiene has been volatile in Japan and the rest of Asia. This should provide the much needed boost to the flat market, as of 2013.|$|E
500|$|The {{substance}} that the suspect tried to detonate {{was more than}} [...] of <b>pentaerythritol</b> tetranitrate (PETN), a crystalline powder that is often the active ingredient of plastic explosives, the high explosive triacetone triperoxide (TATP), and other ingredients. PETN {{is among the most}} powerful of explosives, and chemically resembles nitroglycerin. The powder was analyzed by the FBI at Quantico, and an FBI affidavit filed in the Eastern District of Michigan reflected preliminary findings that the device contained PETN. The authorities also found the remains of the syringe. The suspect apparently carried the PETN onto the plane in a -long soft plastic container, possibly a condom, attached to his underwear. Much of the container was lost in the fire. ABC News cited a government test indicating that [...] of PETN can blow a hole in the side of an airliner, and posted photos of the remains of Abdulmutallab's underwear and explosive packet.|$|E

Grignard reagents and organolithium compounds react with MeCHO to give hydroxyethyl derivatives. In one of the more spectacular condensation reactions, three equivalents of formaldehyde add to MeCHO to give <b>pentaerythritol,</b> C(CH2OH)4.|$|E
2500|$|DERA's Feraday and Dr. Thomas Hayes {{examined}} two {{strips of}} metal from AVE 4041, and found traces of <b>pentaerythritol</b> tetranitrate (PETN) and cyclotrimethylene trinitramine, components of Semtex-H, a high-performance plastic explosive manufactured in Pardubice, Czechoslovakia (now Czech Republic). [...] In March 1990, Czechoslovakian President Václav Havel disclosed {{that the former}} communist regime had supplied a large consignment of Semtex through a company called Omnipol {{to the government of}} Libya.|$|E
2500|$|Traditionally, {{acetaldehyde}} {{was mainly}} {{used as a}} precursor to acetic acid. [...] This application has declined because acetic acid is produced more efficiently from methanol by the Monsanto and Cativa processes. Acetaldehyde is an important precursor to pyridine derivatives, <b>pentaerythritol,</b> and crotonaldehyde. [...] Urea and acetaldehyde combine to give a useful resin. [...] Acetic anhydride reacts with acetaldehyde to give ethylidene diacetate, a precursor to vinyl acetate, {{which is used to}} produce polyvinyl acetate.|$|E
2500|$|On 18 July 2007, Ulrich Lumpert {{admitted}} he had lied at the trial. In an affidavit before a Zurich notary public, Lumpert {{stated that he}} had stolen a prototype MST-13 printed circuit board from Mebo and gave it without permission on 22 June 1989, to [...] "an official person investigating the Lockerbie case". Dr Hans Köchler, a UN observer at the Lockerbie trial who received a copy of Lumpert's affidavit, said: [...] "The Scottish authorities are now obliged to investigate this situation. Not only has Mr Lumpert admitted to stealing {{a sample of the}} timer, but to the fact he gave it to an official and then lied in court." [...] Traces of high explosives RDX and <b>pentaerythritol</b> tetranitrate (PETN) were found in proximity to the explosion.|$|E
