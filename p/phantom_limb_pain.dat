25|$|The {{prevalence}} of phantom pain in upper limb amputees is nearly 82%, and in lower limb amputees is 54%. One {{study found that}} eight days after amputation, 72% of patients had <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> <b>pain,</b> and six months later, 67% reported it. Some amputees experience continuous pain that varies in intensity or quality; others experience several bouts of pain per day, or it may reoccur less often. It {{is often described as}} shooting, crushing, burning or cramping. If the pain is continuous for a long period, parts of the intact body may become sensitized, so that touching them evokes pain in the phantom limb. <b>Phantom</b> <b>limb</b> <b>pain</b> may accompany urination or defecation.|$|E
25|$|The {{relationship}} between phantom limb sensation and neuroplasticity {{is a complex}} one. In the early 1990s V.S. Ramachandran theorized that phantom limbs {{were the result of}} cortical remapping. However, in 1995 Herta Flor and her colleagues demonstrated that cortical remapping occurs only in patients who have phantom pain. Her research showed that <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> <b>pain</b> (rather than referred sensations) was the perceptual correlate of cortical reorganization. This phenomenon is sometimes referred to as maladaptive plasticity.|$|E
25|$|Health {{psychology}} {{attempts to}} find treatments to reduce or eliminate pain, as well as understand pain anomalies such as episodic analgesia, causalgia, neuralgia, and <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> <b>pain.</b> Although the task of measuring and describing pain has been problematic, {{the development of the}} McGill Pain Questionnaire has helped make progress in this area. Treatments for pain involve patient-administered analgesia, acupuncture (found to be effective in reducing pain for osteoarthritis of the knee), biofeedback, and cognitive behavior therapy.|$|E

50|$|Tactile {{hallucination}} is {{the false}} perception of tactile sensory input {{that creates a}} hallucinatory sensation of physical contact with an imaginary object. It {{is caused by the}} faulty integration of the tactile sensory neural signals generated in the spinal cord and the thalamus and sent to the primary somatosensory cortex (SI) and secondary somatosensory cortex (SII). Tactile hallucinations are recurrent symptoms of neurological diseases such as schizophrenia, Parkinson's disease, Ekbom's syndrome and delerium tremens. Patients who experience <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> <b>pains</b> also experience a type of tactile hallucination. Tactile hallucinations are also caused by drugs such as cocaine and alcohol.|$|R
40|$|Since their {{departure}} from Algeria {{in and around}} 1962, the former French citizens of Algeria, or Pieds-Noirs, have been writing about their traumatic separation from their homeland. Many of these authors, including Marie Cardinal and Nobel laureate Albert Camus, write to cultivate memory and communal identity. Their literature is filled with colorful recreations of the physical landscape of Algeria, sustaining their amputated homeland through writing. This continuing connection to the amputated past haunts the Pieds-Noirs like <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> <b>pains</b> that plague amputees, and the group uses its literature like a prosthesis to reconnect to what they have lost. This article demonstrates how most of the former French of Algeria perpetuate their <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> in their writing to maintain {{a connection to the}} past, while others such as Jacques Derrida and Hélène Cixous have embraced their amputated identities because they were separated while still in Algeria. By accepting this always absent or escapable elsewhere, the two use their writing to lay the ghostly limb to rest...|$|R
25|$|There is no {{randomized}} {{study in}} medical literature that {{has studied the}} response with amputation of patients who have failed the above-mentioned therapies and who continue to be miserable. Nonetheless, {{there are reports that}} on average cite about half of the patients will have resolution of their pain, while half will develop <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> <b>pain</b> and/or pain at the amputation site. It is likely that as in any other chronic pain syndrome, the brain becomes chronically stimulated with pain, and late amputation may not work as well as it might be expected. In a survey of fifteen patients with CRPS Type 1, eleven responded that their life was better after amputation. Since this is the ultimate treatment of a painful extremity, it should be left as a last resort.|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1990s, MSF {{missions}} {{were set up}} to treat tuberculosis and anaemia in residents of the Aral Sea area, and look after civilians affected by drug-resistant disease, famine, and epidemics of cholera and AIDS. They vaccinated 3 million Nigerians against meningitis during an epidemic in 1996 and denounced the Taliban’s neglect of health care for women in 1997. Arguably, the most significant country in which MSF set up field missions in the late 1990s was Sierra Leone, which {{was involved in a}} civil war at the time. In 1998, volunteers began assisting in surgeries in Freetown to help with an increasing number of amputees, and collecting statistics on civilians (men, women and children) being attacked by large groups of men claiming to represent ECOMOG. The groups of men were travelling between villages and systematically chopping off one or both of each resident’s arms, raping women, gunning down families, razing houses, and forcing survivors to leave the area. Long-term projects following {{the end of the civil}} war included psychological support and <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> <b>pain</b> management.|$|E
25|$|Phantom limbs are a {{phenomenon}} which occurs following amputation of a limb from an individual. In 90–98% of cases, amputees report feeling {{all or part}} of the limb or body part still there, taking up space. The amputee may perceive a limb under full control, or paralyzed. A common side effect of phantom limbs is <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> <b>pain.</b> The neurophysiological mechanisms by which phantom limbs occur is still under debate. A common theory posits that the afferent neurons, since deafferented due to amputation, typically remap to adjacent cortical regions within the brain. This can cause amputees to report feeling their missing limb being touched when a seemingly unrelated part of the body is stimulated (such as if the face is touched, but the amputee also feels their missing arm being stroked in a specific location). Another facet of phantom limbs is that the efferent copy (motor feedback) responsible for reporting on position to the body schema does not attenuate quickly. Thus the missing body part may be attributed by the amputee to still be in a fixed or movable position.|$|E
40|$|Psychological {{distress}} and postamputation pain were investigated {{in a sample}} of 582 males with long-term limb amputations (mean time since amputation 639. 3 months, standard deviation 166. 1; range 240 â 784 months). Prevalence of significant depressive symptoms (Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale [HADS]-D score â¥ 8) was 32. 0 %, and 34. 0 % of respondents met the screening criterion for clinical anxiety (HADS-A score â¥ 8). Nearly one quarter (24. 6 %) of respondents reported significant post-traumatic psychological stress symptoms (Impact of Event Scale scores â¥ 35). In total, 87. 8 % experienced either <b>phantom</b> or residual <b>limb</b> <b>pain.</b> Affective distress scores differed according to the respondents' type of pain experience. Respondents who experienced residual <b>limb</b> <b>pain</b> reported significantly higher affective distress scores than those with no <b>phantom</b> or residual <b>limb</b> <b>pain.</b> Many older individuals with long-term traumatic limb amputations could benefit from interventions to ameliorate affective {{distress and}} appropriate residual <b>limb</b> <b>pain</b> treatment...|$|R

40|$|In {{opposition}} to the argument that pain is private, personal and unsharable, I propose that the intersubjectivity of pain is fundamental to it. Using the case of <b>phantom</b> <b>limb,</b> I show how a specific language of pain emerged and became concretized in the US circa 1975 {{with the advent of}} the McGill Pain Questionnaire (MPQ). Through widespread use of the MPQ, a language of pain materialized, one that was commonly used to describe the qualitative dimensions of <b>phantom</b> <b>limb.</b> After 1975, the terminology used within the medical literature was overwhelmingly consonant with the set of descriptors advanced by the MPQ.

25|$|Individuals {{who suffer}} from chronic pain {{experience}} prolonged pain at sites {{that may have been}} previously injured, yet are otherwise currently healthy. This phenomenon is related to neuroplasticity due to a maladaptive reorganization of the nervous system, both peripherally and centrally. During the period of tissue damage, noxious stimuli and inflammation cause an elevation of nociceptive input from the periphery to the central nervous system. Prolonged nociception from the periphery then elicits a neuroplastic response at the cortical level to change its somatotopic organization for the painful site, inducing central sensitization. For instance, individuals experiencing complex regional pain syndrome demonstrate a diminished cortical somatotopic representation of the hand contralaterally as well as a decreased spacing between the hand and the mouth. Additionally, chronic pain has been reported to significantly reduce the volume of grey matter in the brain globally, and more specifically at the prefrontal cortex and right thalamus. However, following treatment, these abnormalities in cortical reorganization and grey matter volume are resolved, as well as their symptoms. Similar results have been reported for <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> <b>pain,</b> chronic low back pain and carpal tunnel syndrome.|$|E
5000|$|Not all {{scientists}} {{support the}} hypothesis that <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> <b>pain</b> is the result of maladaptive changes in the cortex.

50|$|Various {{methods have}} been used to treat <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> <b>pain.</b> Doctors may {{prescribe}} medications to reduce the pain.

40|$|Recent {{studies of}} amputees reveal a {{remarkable}} {{diversity in the}} qualities of experiences that define the <b>phantom</b> <b>limb,</b> whether painless or painful. This paper selectively reviews evidence of peripheral, central and psychological processes that trigger or modulate a variety of <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> experiences. The data show that pain experienced prior to amputation may persist {{in the form of}} a somatosensory memory in the <b>phantom</b> <b>limb.</b> It is suggested that the length and size of the <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> may be a perceptual marker of the extent to which sensory input from the amputation stump have re-occupied deprived cortical regions originally subserving the amputated limb. A peripheral mechanism involving a sympathetic-efferent somatic-afferent cycle is presented to explain fluctuations in the intensity of paresthesias referred to the <b>phantom</b> <b>limb.</b> While <b>phantom</b> <b>pain</b> and other sensations are frequently triggered by thoughts and feelings, there is no evidence that the painful or painless <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> is a symptom of a psychological disorder.

The pain that accompanies it is severe and treated separately (the pain is similar to CRPS, <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> or thalamic <b>pain</b> syndrome).

50|$|Mirror box therapy {{allows for}} illusions of {{movement}} and touch in a <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> by inducing somatosensory and motor pathway coupling between the <b>phantom</b> and real <b>limb.</b> Many patients experience pain {{as a result of}} a clenched <b>phantom</b> <b>limb,</b> and because <b>phantom</b> <b>limbs</b> are not under voluntary control, unclenching becomes impossible.

50|$|People with amputations have {{reported}} phantom limbs.

40|$|A <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> is the {{sensation}} that an amputated limb is {{still attached to}} the body and is moving together with other body parts. <b>Phantom</b> <b>limb</b> phenomenon is often described {{on the basis of}} the patient's subjective sense, for example as represented using a visual analog scale (VAS). The aim of this study was to propose a novel quantification method for behavioral aspect of <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> by psychophysics. Twelve unilateral forearm amputees were asked to perform phantom wrist motion with various motion frequencies (60, 80, 100, 120, 140, 160, 180, 200, 220, 240 % of preferred speed). The attainment of <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> motion in each session was rated by the VAS ranging from 0 (hard) to 10 (easy). The relationship between the VAS and motion frequency was mathematically fitted by quadric function, and the value of shift and the degree of steepness were obtained as evaluation variables for the <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> movement. In order to test whether the proposed method can reasonably quantify the characteristics of <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> motion, we compared the variables among three different <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> movement conditions: (1) unilateral (phantom only), (2) bimanual, and (3) bimanual wrist movement with mirror reflection-induced visual feedback (MVF). While VAS rating showed a larger extent of inter- and intra-subject variability, the relationship of the VAS in response to motion frequency could be fitted by quadric curve, and the obtained parameters based on quadric function well characterize task-dependent changes in <b>phantom</b> <b>limb</b> movement.
