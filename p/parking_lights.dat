25|$|For 1932, the Greater Eights {{received}} new, more streamlined styling, {{including a}} greater {{slope of the}} windshield. Hudson's engineering stylist, Frank S. Spring, made the fenders more graceful and gave the car's body gentler curves. The 1932 models featured a prominent Vee'd grille with vertical chrome theme. The cars were recognizable by their uniquely styled rounded-triangle shaped headlights and <b>parking</b> <b>lights,</b> which mimicked the shape of Hudson's triangle logo. The triangle theme was also repeated in the interior, including the driver's floor pedals.|$|E
25|$|The 1965 Chevrolet Chevy II and Nova were {{updated with}} cleaner {{front-end}} styling {{courtesy of a}} fresh full-width grille with new integrated headlight bezels. <b>Parking</b> <b>lights</b> moved down to the deep-section bumper, and sedans gained a new roofline. Taillight and backup lights were restyled, as was the rear cove. The 1965 Chevy II came in entry-level 100 form or as the posher Nova 400, each in three body styles. The Nova Super Sport came as a Sport Coupe only, and its production dipped to just 9,100 cars. Super Sports had a new brushed-chrome console with floor-mounted four-speed manual transmission or Powerglide automatic, but a column-mounted three-speed manual remained standard. Bucket seats wore textured vinyl trim, and the dashboard held ammeter, oil pressure, and temperature gauges.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, two rest areas along Interstate80 {{were shut}} down due to chronic use for {{homosexual}} activities. The rest area in Lodi, next to westbound exit63, shut down on June 30, 1982 on request of the New Jersey State Police. Local lawyers noted that an uptick of summons were given at the rest area, including one motorist cited for not using <b>parking</b> <b>lights.</b> The State Police {{decided that it was}} not worth patrolling as it was an unattended rest area. The rest area at Roxbury in Morris County shut down in October1982. Opened in the 1970s, the borough noted {{that it was impossible to}} control the activity going on at the location, including homosexual activities, alcohol and drug parties, theft and lewd acts. However, citing numerous accidents and needing a place for trucks to be able to rest, the stop re-opened in August 14, 1991 for truckers only.|$|E

25|$|VAM's {{decision}} to focus all {{efforts on the}} new two-version Lerma model plus the loss of luxury accessories meant the discontinuation of Rally SST for 1982. The loss of the exemption of 500 units of automobile engines without emission certification forced the retirement of the Rally GT. The only model left for 1982 was the Rally AMX, with substantial differences from the previous two years. The taillight surrounding areas plus the headlight bezels and front hood molding were completely blacked out, the last two parts also having a horizontal red stripe passing from edge to edge. An all-new grille design with a horizontal bar {{at the same height}} of the bezels' division between the <b>parking</b> <b>lights</b> and headlights and a vertical bar at the very center; behind these was a set of smaller narrower horizontal lines. Both bumpers for the year were those of the AMC Eagle SX/4 Sport, being blacked out equipped with thick nerfing strips with central bright moldings and longer more aerodynamic bumper end caps with their respective bright molding. Unlike the previous two years, no decals or stickers of any kind were used. The standard wheel designs for the year were the eight spoke steel units with blacked out volcano hubcaps. Due to the impossibility of having the bullet-type door mirrors reproduced, the model switched to sporty design that was used in the 1978–1980 models. However, the remote controls for these mirrors while still available were moved to the option list. The Recaro-type seats received new patterns with a smaller bucket shape to allow an easier {{in and out of the}} car in the driver's side (due to the lack of a tilt steering column). The door panels were the same units as in 1981 except for the change in the fabric portion from plain to a pattern of vertical stripes and the removal of a fake chrome molding in place of a woodgrain unit. The six-bolt sports steering wheel was replaced by a leather-wrapped three-arm Nardi unit. VAM managed to find a local company to reproduce the center console, but it was reduced to the shifter and gauges portions, deleting the armrest with the rear ashtray. Despite the loss in accessories, two new options arrived for the year in the form of the AM FM stereo tape player radio and the rear wiper and washer. The car received two changes in the mid year, the first being a new wooden sports steering wheel and the second a new set of ten-round-spoke steel wheels. Mechanically, the only novelties for the year were wider gear ratios for the A998 automatic transmission and in the mid year a new head design with rounded internal intake ports and smaller spark plug outlets, still retaining the metal valve cover of the previous years. A different head gasket was used to bring the compression ratio from 8.0:1 to 8.5:1.|$|E
2500|$|The Concept I car {{combined}} a [...] "wedge-design" [...] {{with a short}} hood, {{low body}} beltline, steeply raked windshield, and expanded glass area. The front featured a mesh grille with [...] "rally-type" [...] <b>parking</b> <b>lights</b> and rectangular headlamps. The rear end was squared off featuring large rear quarter windows to eliminate blind spots. The rear panel incorporated a characteristic continental tire bulge.|$|E
2500|$|In {{contrast}} to the Concord hatchback, the AMX version included a different front fascia with single round headlights, a flush grille, round amber <b>parking</b> <b>lights,</b> and a [...] "power bulge" [...] hood that was also used on the Gremlin. Engines included the standard [...] I6 with 4-speed manual or optional 3-speed automatic floor shift transmission, or the optional [...] V8 with a 3-speed automatic. A factory [...] V8 with a 4-speed manual {{could have been a}} special order example.|$|E

2500|$|The 1973 {{model year}} {{introduced}} a hatchback bodystyle {{based on the}} 2-door coupe. The front and rear of the Nova were restyled, following a government mandate for vehicles to be fitted with front and rear bumpers capable of absorbing a low-speed impact of [...] To {{go along with the}} bigger bumpers, stylists gave the Nova a new grille with a loosely patterned crosshatch insert and <b>parking</b> <b>lights</b> located inboard of the headlights. In 1974, they could absorb 5mph impacts.|$|E
2500|$|In {{its first}} year, the American Rally AMX was cosmetically {{almost the same}} as its U.S. counterpart. Both {{versions}} shared the same rear louvers, fender extensions, front air dam, side stripe, body-colored bumpers with guards and nerfing strips, shell-type door mirrors, roof targa band, and mesh-grating grille design with round <b>parking</b> <b>lights</b> and central AMX emblem. The only different characteristics of the Mexican vehicle were the inhouse five-spoke wheels with chromed volcano hubcaps and trim rings, the presence of original [...] "Rally AMX" [...] decals just under the regular side stripes (replacing AMC's lower body [...] "AMX" [...] design for the model), the [...] "Rally" [...] and [...] "4.6" [...] emblems, {{and the lack of}} the [...] "Hornet in Flames" [...] hood decal. Another visual difference took place in the midyear as VAM's customers mostly rejected the mesh grille design as [...] "very simplistic and rough-looking". The company responded to the criticisms with an original grille design incorporating the rectangular <b>parking</b> <b>lights</b> placed vertically and between them, a set of three vertical lines (left, center, right), and a central horizontal line passing through them, behind this was a mesh grating half smaller in size as the original.|$|E
2500|$|For 1963, the Grand Prix {{received}} revised sheetmetal {{shared with}} other full-size Pontiacs, but {{with its own}} squared-off roofline with a concave rear window that contrasted with the convertible-like roofline of the 1962 Grand Prix and continued on the 1963 to 1964 Catalina and Bonneville. Also new was a Pontiac-trademark split grille with vertical headlights and round <b>parking</b> <b>lights</b> and [...] "hidden" [...] taillights out back. Aside from grillework, taillight covering and bumpers, chrome trim was limited to lower rocker panels, wheel arches and roofline.|$|E

2500|$|For 1975, the Riviera {{received}} an updated front fascia, which lost its forward-jutting theme through the redesign of the fiberglass front end cap. Quad rectangular headlights were mounted horizontally. The new vertical-bar grille echoed the [...] "stand-up" [...] theme that many GM cars {{of the day}} incorporated. <b>Parking</b> <b>lights</b> wrapped around the fender sides. The Stage One performance package was dropped for 1975, though the Gran Sport handling package {{would continue to be}} offered. The standard engine's output dipped to [...] Sales for 1975 were 17,306.|$|E
2500|$|Since its {{introduction}} [...] "the Rambler American {{has done well}} at American Motors." [...] For its final model year, 1969, the [...] "American" [...] name was dropped as the car was now {{referred to as the}} [...] "American Motors Rambler". Continuing the tradition of minimal changes, the models received a new [...] "suspended" [...] accelerator pedal and cable throttle linkage. Additional safety equipment for the 1969 models included front shoulder belts and headrests for both front outboard seating positions and the front <b>parking</b> <b>lights</b> stayed on with the headlights. On the exterior, the center horizontal chrome grille bar was deleted.|$|E
2500|$|The most {{significant}} change for 1967 was Buick's replacement of its venerable 425 [...] "nailhead" [...] with {{an entirely new}} [...] V8. [...] Its [...] and [...] of torque were a significant performance improvement. Gasoline mileage improved slightly, but remained low. Powerful disc brakes with Bendix four-piston calipers became optional for the front wheels but most Riviera continued to be ordered with Buick's highly capable ribbed aluminum brake drums. Cosmetically, changes were few, and were limited to {{the addition of a}} wide, full-width, center-mounted horizontal chrome grille bar that stretched over the headlight doors and outboard <b>parking</b> <b>lights.</b> Sales eased to 42,799 for the 1967 model year. The Riviera had full instrumentation.|$|E

2500|$|For 1967, all GM {{full-size}} cars {{received a}} mid cycle freshening that featured fuller body panels. More rounded styling cues marked all 1967 Olds 88 models which received longer hoods and shorter decks and more sweeping fastback rooflines on 88 Holiday coupes {{to emulate the}} styling of Olds' front-wheel-drive flagship, the Toronado. [...] Olds 88's received a three part front grille made op of a center prow flanked on either side by headlight pods. [...] For {{the first time since}} 1959, the dual headlights were split apart by <b>parking</b> <b>lights.</b> [...] Taillights for 88's featured a waterfall design.

Meyers, AMC transformed the austere old Hornet into the handsomer Concord." [...] Richard A. Teague, AMC's top car designer, utilized the facelifted 1977 Gremlin's front fenders with a new hood over a chrome six-section egg-crate grille incorporating white rectangular <b>parking</b> <b>lights,</b> as well as new rectangular headlights, bumpers, fiberglass rear fender end caps, rectangular tri-color taillights, and a stand-up hood ornament with a new Concord emblem. On cars with the optional D/L package, the roof featured an outlined quarter-vinyl cover that was available in matching or contrasting color.|$|E
2500|$|The American {{base model}} {{in its first}} year was {{characterized}} by incorporating all-new rectangular amber <b>parking</b> <b>lights,</b> grille divided into six squared portions, and more hexagonal-lined headlight bezels. Manual front disk brakes were standard and the 258 six-cylinder engine featured Prestolite electronic ignition. This engine was carried over with a 7.6:1 compression ratio, 266 degree camshaft, , and a single-barrel Carter YF or RBS carburetor. Interiors included new door panels available in either a solid color or two-tone alongside new seats patterns. The two-tone dashboard was replaced by a color-keyed unit with a new [...] "American" [...] emblem on the glove box door and a standard fuel economy gauge. Cars equipped with automatic transmission included a heater and power steering at no extra cost.|$|E

2500|$|For 1974, the Chevrolet Nova got larger <b>parking</b> <b>lights</b> and new bow-tie grille emblems, {{as well as}} {{modified}} bumpers {{that added}} two inches to length and helped cushion minor impacts. The Powerglide {{was replaced by a}} lightweight version of the three-speed Turbo-Hydramatic 350 ( [...] THM 250 [...] ) already offered with the [...] V8, which was the only V8 offered for 1974. Nova sales continued the surge they had enjoyed since 1972 and approached 400,000 cars for 1974. Six-cylinder Novas were the fastest gainers, as sales of V-8 Novas declined. These were the years of the first energy crisis as Middle Eastern countries cut back on oil exports. After waiting for hours in gas lines and fretting about the prospect of fuel rationing, thrifty compacts looked pretty good to plenty of Americans. Nova fit the bill.|$|E
2500|$|For 1978 the Concours was {{discontinued}} {{to clear}} the way for the newly downsized Malibu, and the Nova Custom inherited much of the Concours' exterior finery but lacked the stand-up hood ornament displayed by the Concours. Upholstery choices included all-vinyl or Edinburgh woven sport cloth/vinyl. More basic versions of the 1978 Chevrolet Nova had the same grille used in '76-77 and added a gold-tinted Chevy bowtie emblem at {{the leading edge of the}} hood. [...] For '78 Nova was also available with Rally equipment, which included yet another front-end layout: a diamond-pattern grille with horizontal <b>parking</b> <b>lights</b> and black headlight bezels (basically the '76-77 SS grille), plus triple band striping and color-keyed Rally wheels. All Nova drivers faced a new dual-spoke, soft vinyl-covered steering wheel; the same one found in the Caprice and Malibu.|$|E
2500|$|Standard {{equipment}} on the Electra included Turbine-Drive automatic transmission, [...] "Mirromatic" [...] instrument panel, directional signals, full-flow oil filter, electric windshield wipers, Deluxe steering wheel, trip mileage indicator, cigar lighter, Step-On brake, dual armrests, cloth and vinyl trim, combinations, carpeting, power steering, power brakes, two-speed windshield wiper/washer system, glovebox light, Custom-padded seat cushions and Deluxe wheelcovers. Two-tone Electras had the color accent {{on the rear}} cove. In addition Electra 225s had back-up lights, Glare-proof rearview mirror, <b>parking</b> <b>lights,</b> signal light, safety buzzer, courtesy lights, two-way power seat, Super Deluxe wheelcovers with gold accents and power windows. The Electra and Electra 225 were the same length in 1961. Buick discontinued the Electra nameplate {{at the end of}} the 1961 model year, leaving only the Electra 225 starting in 1962.|$|E
