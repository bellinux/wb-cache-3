40|$|The {{objective}} of the presented work is to investigate the slipstream effects on the flow properties and thrust performances of a full-length and truncated annular plug nozzle of a small rocket launcher during a suborbital flight. The nozzle flow properties are investigated for three characteristics flow conditions (M∞ = 1. 3, 2. 59 and 9. 7), using CFD simulations. When the rocket launcher flies through the atmosphere, the body geometry produces a slipstream with conditions in the nozzle area that {{are different from the}} undisturbed environment. The in-flight behavior of the truncated plug nozzles is complicated and affected also by recirculation regions that take place behind the shroud and <b>plug</b> <b>base.</b> In this paper special emphasis is given to investigate the slipstream effects between the hot exhaust plume from the rocket engine and the external coaxial supersonic/hypersonic air flow and their influence on the slope and position of different shocks generated in the separated flow region (realignment shocks, recompression shocks, <b>plug</b> <b>base</b> lip shock and trailing shocks). Also analyzed is the pressure distribution on the shroud base, spike supersonic ramp and spike base for closed-wake operations to determine the overall engine performance. The results of the numerical simulations confirm the altitude-compensating features of the annular truncated plug nozzles...|$|E
40|$|The flowfields {{associated}} with truncated annular plug nozzles of varying lengths are studied both experimentally and using computational tools. The nozzles {{are designed to}} observe wake structure transition for the range of pressure ratios considered. A classification of the open wake regime is proposed for comparing and analyzing the plug flowfields. The three-dimensional relief experienced by the annular plug flow leads to greater wave interactions on the plug surface as compared with linear plug flow, resulting in a delayed transition of the base wake. The Reynolds averaged Navier-Stokes based solvers employed in the studies could predict the plug surface flow accurately, whereas they exhibited limitations with regard to <b>plug</b> <b>base</b> flow predictions. Based on the experimental data generated, an empirical model for predicting closed wake base pressure is proposed and compared with other models available in literature...|$|E

40|$|The flowfield {{and base}} {{pressure}} characteristics of an internal-external expansion, truncated plug nozzle are described over the pressure ratio range from 'open' wake to 'closed' wake conditions. The effect of plug length on these characteristics, including {{the process of}} wake 'closure' is also presented. An existing method for calculating the flowfield and base pressure, for 'closed' wake operation, is modified to include the internal shock wave generated near the shroud exit. The supersonic portion of the flow is calculated using rotational axisymmetric method of characteristics. The technique of Hartree is employed so that the downstream characteristic point locations can be chosen to fit the developing flowfield. An overexpansion technique is used to detect the internal shock wave {{in the vicinity of}} the shroud exit so that its effect on the <b>plug</b> <b>base</b> pressure could be determined.

This paper introduces {{the design of}} a novel Fomichev <b>plug</b> <b>based</b> upon the analysis of roll opening, taking into account for both feed angle and toe angle of a cone type piercer, then presents a 3 -D coupled thermo-mechanical simulation of the novel Fomichev Plug’s performance characteristic during cone-roll piercing process, with the aid of FE code MSC. SuperForm. In comparison with conventional plugs, as FEM simulation result shows that the new plug makes the metal deformation distribute uniformly along its perforation section, which brings about well-distributed plug wear. The novel Fomichev plug is able to decrease the slip between the roll and workpiece and avoid rolling block owing to its smaller plug force, which can increase piercing efficiency so, moreover, analyzing stress distribution, it’s more suitable for metal deformation with fewer defects in tube piercing, makes resistance to metal elongation smaller, reduces wedge cleaving to tube billet, and prevents lamination defects during piercing high-alloy billet...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{spark plug}} {{has been used}} as the {{ignition}} source of the spark ignited internal combustion (IC) engine for many decades. It is limited in that once the plug has been built and installed, the ignition location within the cylinder cannot be subsequently changed. Multiple spark ignition of the engine for improved combustion control is possible with a spark plug, but this technology has significant limitations. The large dwell time of the spark plug makes firing multiple ignitions at different but close crank angles during a cycle impractical. Furthermore, to achieve multiple ignition locations with a spark plug requires multiple spark plugs to be installed on each cylinder, which creates severe constraints on the cylinder and valve geometry. The use of a laser as an ignition source however can in principle allow adaptive focusing to allow the on-line change of ignition location {{under the control of the}} Engine Control Unit (ECU) and so effectively remove many of the restrictions of a spark <b>plug</b> <b>based</b> systems. This paper presents the results of an experimental study on the potential benefits of changing the ignition position in Single Location Ignition (SLI) and the associated laser pulse energy and investigates the prospects of calibrating these parameters to control an engine for improved performance...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveThe {{purpose of}} this study is to {{evaluate}} the ability of machine learning to discriminate between magnetic resonance images (MRI) of normal and pathological human articular cartilage obtained under standard clinical conditions. MethodAn approach to MRI classification of cartilage degradation is proposed using pattern recognition and multivariable regression in which image features from MRIs of histologically scored human articular cartilage plugs were computed using weighted neighbor distance using compound hierarchy of algorithms representing morphology (WND-CHRM). The WND-CHRM method was first applied to several clinically available MRI scan types to perform binary classification of normal and osteoarthritic osteochondral <b>plugs</b> <b>based</b> on the Osteoarthritis Research Society International (OARSI) histological system. In addition, the image features computed from WND-CHRM were used to develop a multiple linear least-squares regression model for classification and prediction of an OARSI score for each cartilage plug. ResultsThe binary classification of normal and osteoarthritic plugs yielded results of limited quality with accuracies between 36 % and 70 %. However, multiple linear least-squares regression successfully predicted OARSI scores and classified plugs with accuracies as high as 86 %. The present results improve upon the previously-reported accuracy of classification using average MRI signal intensities and parameter values. ConclusionMRI features detected by WND-CHRM reflect cartilage degradation status as assessed by OARSI histologic grading. WND-CHRM is therefore of potential use in the clinical detection and grading of osteoarthritis...|$|R

These loads and sustainable sources {{have one thing in}} common: Direct Current. To successfully respond to this growing usage of direct current (DC) systems it is important to provoke an evolution in the provision of DC infrastructure. At present, there are doubts about the safety, efficiency, reliability and economical aspects of DC grids. Even when considering the implementation of a DC grid there is still confusion on parameters such as used voltages, converters or plugs. In this paper, optimal parameters are defined for a DC Micro Grid design, mainly focusing on student and domestic environments. But also office spaces, industrial and agricultural environments can use the same basic parameters. The proposed parameters are evaluated on their sustainable impact and benefit.
