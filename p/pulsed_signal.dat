40|$|Common {{bottlenose}} dolphins (Tursiops truncatus), {{produce a}} wide variety of vocal emissions for communication and echolocation, of which the pulsed repertoire has been the most difficult to categorize. Packets of high repetition, broadband pulses are still largely reported under a general designation of burst-pulses, and traditional attempts to classify these emissions rely mainly in their aural characteristics and in graphical aspects of spectrograms. Here, we present a quantitative analysis of <b>pulsed</b> <b>signals</b> emitted by wild bottlenose dolphins, in the Sado estuary, Portugal (2011 - 2014), and test the reliability of a traditional classification approach. Acoustic parameters (minimum frequency, maximum frequency, peak frequency, duration, repetition rate and inter-click-interval) were extracted from 930 <b>pulsed</b> <b>signals,</b> previously categorized using a traditional approach. Discriminant function analysis revealed a high reliability of the traditional classification approach (93. 5 % of <b>pulsed</b> <b>signals</b> were consistently assigned to their aurally based categories). According to the discriminant function analysis (Wilk's Λ = 0. 11, F 3, 2. 41 = 282. 75, P < 0. 001), repetition rate is the feature that best enables the discrimination of different <b>pulsed</b> <b>signals</b> (structure coefficient = 0. 98). Classification using hierarchical cluster analysis led to a similar categorization pattern: two main signal types with distinct magnitudes of repetition rate were clustered into five groups. The <b>pulsed</b> <b>signals,</b> here described, present significant differences in their time-frequency features, especially repetition rate (P < 0. 001), inter-click-interval (P < 0. 001) and duration (P < 0. 001). We document the occurrence of a distinct signal type-short burst-pulses, and highlight the existence of a diverse repertoire of pulsed vocalizations emitted in graded sequences. The use of quantitative analysis of <b>pulsed</b> <b>signals</b> is essential to improve classifications and to better assess the contexts of emission, geographic variation and the functional significance of <b>pulsed</b> <b>signals.</b> Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia (FCT); Tróia-Natura S. ...|$|R

Gross positioning was determined using the same methods as Gee, locating the receiver within a wide area.

A PLL produces a steady output signal with the same frequency and phase as an input signal, even if that input is periodic or poorly received. In this case the important feature was that the PLL allowed the re-construction of a continuous signal from a number of short pulses. A system using PLLs could receive a single <b>pulsed</b> <b>signal,</b> like Gee, and then re-construct a continuous tone for phase measurement, like Decca.|$|E

50|$|Infrared missile seekers of {{the first}} {{generation}} typically used a spinning reticle with a pattern on it that modulates infrared energy before it falls on a detector (A mode of operation called Spin scan). The patterns used differ from seeker to seeker, but the principle is the same.

In more recent designs the missile optics will rotate and the rotating image is projected on a stationary reticle (a mode called Conical scan) or stationary set of detectors which generates a <b>pulsed</b> <b>signal</b> which is processed by the tracking logic.Most shoulder-launched (MANPADS) systems use this type of seeker, as do many air defense systems and air-to-air missiles (for example the AIM-9L).|$|E
