40|$|A simple {{protocol}} {{that makes}} use of the inertia of water to generate a rapid negative pressure differential across capillary ultrafiltration membranes is reported. This short-interval back-flush technique, preceded by cross-flow forward flush, was evaluated {{as an alternative to}} conventional back-flush to maintain membrane flux productivity in a pilot dead-end filtration application. Intermittent back-flush conditions are created when a reverse-pressure pulse, during which product is drawn in the reverse direction through the membrane wall, is introduced. The duration of the negative pressure-pulse peak is very short (1 - 2 s), after which it subsides and levels out in accordance with the net positive suction head of the centrifugal pump used to recirculate the feed. Reverse-pressure spikes of up to - 90 kPa, which subside after only a few second to - 40 kPa, were generated. The combined effect of reverse-pressure <b>pulsation</b> <b>sequence</b> of events is that of (i) a short back-flush (direct result of negative trans-membrane pressure conditions that are introduced) and (ii) flow destabilisation (sudden retardation and start-up of lumen-flow) during a forward flush that precedes the reverse-pressure pulse event. The reverse-pressure pulse technique was evaluated in a dead-end filtration pilot study producing potable water from a surface resource without the addition of chemicals. The membranes suffered no adverse effects and their flux performance was maintained reasonably well, even though the feed water turbidity reached values as high as 90 NTU during the exercise. © 2004 Elsevier B.

40|$|Period-luminosity (PL) {{sequences}} of long period variables (LPVs) are commonly interpreted as different pulsation modes, {{but there is}} disagreement on the modal assignment. Here, we re-examine the observed PL sequences in the Large Magellanic Cloud, including the sequence of long secondary periods (LSPs), and their associated pulsation modes. Firstly, we theoretically model the sequences using linear, radial, non-adiabatic pulsation models and a population synthesis model of the LMC red giants. Then, we use a semi-empirical approach to assign modes to the pulsation sequences by exploiting observed multi-mode pulsators. As {{a result of the}} combined approaches, we consistently find that sequences B and C^' both correspond to first overtone pulsation, although there are some fundamental mode pulsators at low luminosities on both sequences. The masses of these fundamental mode pulsators are larger at a given luminosity than the mass of the first overtone pulsators. These two sequences B and C^' are separated by a small period interval in which large amplitude pulsation in a long secondary period (sequence D variability) occurs, meaning that the first overtone pulsation is not seen as the primary mode of pulsation. Observationally, this leads to the splitting of the first overtone <b>pulsation</b> <b>sequence</b> into the two observed sequences B and C^'. Our two independent examinations also show that sequences A^', A and C correspond to third overtone, second overtone and fundamental mode pulsation, respectively.

40|$|We present new Spitzer/IRAC {{observations}} of 55 dusty Long Period Variables (LPVs, 48 AGB and 6 RSG stars) in the Galaxy that have different chemistry, variability type, and mass-loss rate. O-rich AGB stars (including intrinsic S-type) {{tend to have}} redder [3. 6]-[8. 0] colors than carbon stars for a given [3. 6]-[4. 5] color due to silicate features increasing the flux in the 8. 0 μm IRAC band. For colors including the 5. 8 μm band, carbon stars separate into two distinct sequences, likely due to a variable photospheric C_ 3 feature that is only visible in relatively unobscured, low mass-loss rate sources. Semiregular variables tend to have smaller IR excess in [3. 6]-[8. 0] color than Miras, consistent with the hypothesis that semiregular variables lose mass discontinuously. Miras have redder colors for longer periods while semiregular variables do not. Galactic AGB stars follow the period-luminosity sequences found for the Magellanic Clouds. Mira variables fall along the fundamental <b>pulsation</b> <b>sequence,</b> while semiregular variables are mostly on overtone sequences. We also derive a relationship between mass-loss rate and [3. 6]-[8. 0] color. The fits are similar in shape to those found by other authors for AGBs in the LMC, but discrepant in overall normalization, likely due to different assumptions in the models used to derive mass-loss rates. We find that IR colors are not unique discriminators of chemical type, suggesting caution when using color selection techniques to infer the chemical composition of AGB dust returned to the ISM.

50|$|The {{numerical}} computations of the <b>pulsations</b> of <b>sequences</b> of W Virginis stellar models exhibit {{two approaches}} to irregular behavior {{that are a}} clear signature of low dimensional chaos. The first indication comes from first return maps in which one plots one maximum radius, or any other suitable variable, versus the next one.The sequence of models shows a period doubling bifurcation, or cascade, leading to chaos.The near quadratic shape of the map is indicative of chaos and implies an underlying horseshoe map Other sequences of models follow a somewhat different route, but also to chaos,namely the Pommeau-Manneville or tangent bifurcation route.|$|R

40|$|MR imaging, {{primarily}} the spin-echo technique, is increas-ingly important in evaluating spinal disease [1 - 3]. We have found, however, that short TI inversion recovery (STIR) {{in conjunction with}} spin-echo techniques provides higher tissue contrast images in shorter imaging times while minimizing imaging degradation due to motion and <b>pulsation.</b> The STIR <b>sequence</b> suppresses the signal from fat [4], allowing clear separation of tumor or infection from normal structures in the spine and abdomen.

40|$|Context: Photometric {{time series}} {{obtained}} from space {{are one of}} the best ways to study <b>pulsations</b> in pre-main <b>sequence</b> (PMS) stars, especially as the corresponding amplitudes are at the millimagnitude level or below. We present high-precision time-series photometry of stars in the field of NGC 2264 obtained with the MOST (Microvariability & Oscillations of STars) satellite. Aims: A search for pulsating A and F type members of NGC 2264 with ultra-precise MOST photometry was conducted. Methods: 68 stars in the field of NGC 2264 were observed simultaneously with the MOST satellite, 34 of which were previously identified as potential targets to search for PMS pulsation. The routines SigSpec and Period 04 were used for the frequency analysis. Results: We discovered pulsation in 4 potential A and F type PMS members of NGC 2264 with frequencies between 2. 7 h and 23 min. For one of the PMS pulsators identified with MOST after the first days of observation, simultaneous ground-based Strömgren photometry was obtained with the OSN 0. 9 m telescope and confirms the highest frequency identified in the MOST photometry. 26 stars with other (i. e., hotter and cooler) spectral types show clear variability: SPB and ?

5000|$|... is {{performed}} by applying external {{pressure on the}} sclera, for example with a spring plunger, while observing the retinal vessels through an ophthalmoscope. The pressure is gradually increased until the central retinal vein begins to pulsate, which happens at the point when the applied external pressure nears the VOP and is approximately equal to ICP. The original method was described in 1925 by Baurmann [...] and belongs to the public domain, but several modifications have been recently patented that combine the classic ophthalmodynamometry with reflectance oximetry of the retina [...] or ultrasound measurement of blood flow in the central retinal artery, or automate the method by adding a camera and an image processing software capable of recognizing venous <b>pulsations</b> from a <b>sequence</b> of images of the eye fundus. Evaluation in patients confirmed a strong linear relationship and clinically negligible differences (2-3mmHg) between VOP and the invasively measured ICP. Ophthalmodynamometry requires dilated pupils, a skilled physician or medic and collaboration of the patient, which all hampers its applicability in the field. It cannot be applied in cases of ocular trauma or conditions that selectively affect the optic nerve, and gives erroneously high readings {{in the presence of}} a papilledema, which may persist long after ICP has returned to normal.|$|R
40|$|We have {{performed}} a cross-identification between OGLE-II data and single-epoch SIRIUS JHK survey {{data in the}} LMC and SMC. After eliminating obvious spurious variables, we determined the pulsation periods for 9, 681 and 2, 927 variables in the LMC and SMC, respectively. Based on these homogeneous data, we studied the pulsation properties and metallicity effects on period-K magnitude (PK) relations by comparing the variable stars in the LMC and SMC. The sample analyzed here is much larger, and we found the following new features: (1) variable red giants in the SMC form parallel sequences on the PK plane, just like those found by Wood (2000) in the LMC; (2) both of the sequences A and B of Wood (2000) have discontinuities, and they occur at the K-band luminosity of the TRGB; (3) the sequence B of Wood (2000) separates into three independent sequences B+- and C'; (4) comparison between the theoretical pulsation models (Wood et al. 1996) and observational data suggests that the variable red giants on sequences C and newly discovered C' are pulsating in the fundamental and first overtone mode, respectively; (5) the theory can not explain the <b>pulsation</b> mode of <b>sequences</b> A+- and B+-, and {{they are unlikely to}} be the sequences for the first and second overtone pulsators, as was previously suggested; (6) the zero points of PK relations of Cepheids in the metal deficient SMC are fainter than those of LMC ones by ~ 0. 1 mag but those of SMC Miras are brighter than those of LMC ones by ~ 0. 13 mag, which are probably due to metallicity effects.

We present the investigation of variability caused by rotation and (gammaDoradus-type) pulsation in two pre-main sequence members of the young open cluster NGC 2264 using high-precision time series photometry from the CoRoT satellite and dedicated high-resolution spectroscopy. Time series photometry of NGC 2264 VAS 20 and NGC 2264 VAS 87 was obtained by the CoRoT satellite during the dedicated short run SRa 01 in March 2008. NGC 2264 VAS 87 was re-observed by CoRoT during the short run SRa 05 in December 2011 and January 2012. Frequency analysis was conducted using Period 04 and SigSpec. The spectral analysis was performed using equivalent widths and spectral synthesis. The frequency analysis yielded 10 and 14 intrinsic frequencies for NGC 2264 VAS 20 and NGC 2264 VAS 87, respectively, {{in the range from}} 0 to 1. 5 c/d which are attributed to be caused by a combination of rotation and pulsation. The effective temperatures were derived to be 6380 ± 150 K for NGC 2264 VAS 20 and 6220 ± 150 K for NGC 2264 VAS 87. Membership of the two stars to the cluster is confirmed independently using X-ray fluxes, radial velocity measurements and proper motions available in the literature. The derived Li abundances of log n(Li) = 3. 34 and 3. 54 for NGC 2264 VAS 20 and NGC 2264 VAS 87, respectively, are in agreement with the Li abundance for other stars in NGC 2264 of similar Teff reported in the literature. We conclude that the two objects are members of NGC 2264 and therefore are in their pre-main sequence evolutionary stage.
