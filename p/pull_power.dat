In this circuit, corrugation {{is added to}} the truncated ground plane of the antenna {{so that it can be}} used for both out-of-phase power combining and second harmonic tuning.

At an operating frequency of 4. 15 GHz, a maximum measured power-added efficiency (PAE) of 60. 9 % at an output power of 28. 2 dBm has been achieved. The measured PAE is above 50 % over a 260 -MHz bandwidth. Additionally, the second harmonic radiation is found to be 30 dB below the fundamental in both - and-planes.

The {{purpose of this study was}} to establish strength, power, and muscular endurance exercises for weight room training, which are strong determinants of success in specific performance measures used to assess elite rowers. Nineteen heavyweight elite males determined their repetition maximum (RM) loads for exercises using a Concept 2 DYNO [5, 30, 60 and 120 RM leg pressing and seated arm pulling (in Joules) ] and free weights [1 RM power clean (in kilograms) and 6 RM bench pull (in kilograms and watts) ]. Rowing performance measures included a 7 -stage blood lactate response ergometer test (aerobic condition), time trials (500, 2000, and 5000 m), a peak stroke power test, and a 60 -minute distance trial. Pearson correlation moments (r + 0. 7) and stepwise multiple linear regression calculations (R 2 + 50 %) were used to establish strong common variances between weight room exercises and rowing ergometer performance (p # 0. 05). Weight room exercises were strong predictors of 2000 -m, 500 -m time (in seconds), and peak stroke power performance measures only.
