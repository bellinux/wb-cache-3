500|$|The puffadder shyshark is preyed upon by larger fishes, {{such as the}} broadnose sevengill shark (Notorynchus cepedianus). The Cape {{fur seal}} (Arctocephalus pusillus pusillus) has been {{documented}} capturing and playing with puffadder shysharks, tossing them into the air or gnawing on them. The shark is often injured or killed during these encounters; the seal may eat torn-off pieces of flesh, but seldom consumes the entire shark. On occasion, black-backed kelp gulls (Larus dominicanus vetula) {{take advantage of this}} behavior and steal the sharks from the seals. When threatened or disturbed, the puffadder shyshark adopts a characteristic posture in which it curls into a <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>covers</b> its eyes with its tail; this reaction is the basis for the common names [...] "shyshark" [...] and [...] "doughnut", and is likely meant to make the shark harder for a predator to swallow.|$|R
50|$|Monturiol had {{originally}} {{wanted to build}} his pressure hull out of metal {{in the interests of}} strength but he and his financial backers lacked sufficient funds, so he instead settled for wood, with which he was familiar since his father was a cooper. The pressure hull was constructed from olive wood, supported with oak <b>rings,</b> <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> in 2 mm of copper, and measured 4 m long, 2 m at its highest, and 1 m wide. Monturiol calculated that it should be able to maintain its integrity to a depth of 500 m, although he only rated it to 50 m for the sake of safety. The outer streamlined hull was 7 m long, 2.5 m high, and displaced 10 tonnes. Several thick glass ports were installed on the sides, top, and bow of the Ictineo; these were semi-conical in shape so that water pressure would tend to force them more firmly into their seats and so avoid leaks.|$|R

In {{the middle of the}} match, Anderson tried to interfere, causing all four men to fight in the ring.

40|$|Dystrophin, {{the protein}} {{product of the}} Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) gene locus, is expressed on the muscle fiber surface. One key to further understanding of the cellular function of dystrophin would be extended knowledge about its subcellular organization. We have shown that dystrophin molecules are not uniformly distributed over the humen, rat, and mouse skeletal muscle fiber surface using three independent methods. Incubation of single-teased muscle fibers with antibodies to dystrophin revealed a network of denser transversal <b>rings</b> (costameres) <b>and</b> finer longitudinal interconnections. Double staining of longitudinal semithin cryosections for dystrophin and alpha-actinin showed spatial juxtaposition of the costameres to the Z bands. Where peripheral myonuclei precluded direct contact of dystrophin to the Z bands the organization of dystrophin was altered into lacunae harboring the myonucleus. These lacunae were surrounded by a dystrophin <b>ring</b> <b>and</b> <b>covered</b> by a more uniform dystrophin veil. Mechanical skinning of single-teased fibers revealed tighter mechanical connection of dystrophin to the plasma membrane than to the underlying internal domain of the muscle fiber. The entire dystrophin network remained preserved in its structure on isolated muscle sarcolemma and identical in appearance to the pattern observed on teased fibers. Therefore, connection of defined areas of plasma membrane or its constituents such as ion channels to single sarcomeres might be a potential function exerted by dystrophin alone or {{in conjunction with other}} submembrane cytoskeletal proteins...|$|R
40|$|Suspended {{graphene}} membranes were fabricated by {{a combination}} of standard photolithography, reactive ion etching and mechanical exfoliation of graphene. An array of annular cavities with designed dimensions was first defined by photolithography on an oxidized silicon wafer with a silicon oxide thickness of 90 / 285 nm. Reactive ion etching was then used to etch the annular rings into microcavities with a depth of 100 - 120 nm. After removal of photoresist with acetone and isopropanol, the chips were further cleaned in a Nanostrip bath at 60 °C for 20 minutes. Thermal evaporation is used to deposit a layer of Cr/Au 5 / 10 nm for the Au coated annular rings. During the evaporation process, the chips are tilted at a 10 ~ 15 ° angle, so that the Cr/Au atoms can be deposited into the annular <b>rings</b> <b>and</b> <b>cover</b> the side walls. The large aspect ratio between the width and depth of the annular ring allows for a conformal metal deposition such that the post and the substrate are electrically contacted and grounded.

50|$|A sector ICP-MS will {{commonly}} {{have four}} sections: an extraction acceleration region, steering lenses, an electrostatic sector and a magnetic sector.

The electrostatic sector may be before or after the magnetic sector depending on the particular instrument, and reduces the spread in kinetic energy caused by the plasma. This spread is particularly large for ICP-MS, being larger than Glow Discharge and much larger than TIMS.

40|$|Purpose: The work {{presents}} preparation methods, structure characterization and chosen properties {{analysis of}} Fe-based bulk metallic glasses in as-cast state. Design/methodology/approach: The studies {{were performed on}} Fe 43 Co 14 Ni 14 B 20 Si 5 Nb 4 metallic glass in form of <b>rings,</b> <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> rods. The amorphous structure of tested samples was examined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), transmission electron microscopy (TEM) and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) methods. The thermal properties of the glassy samples was measured using differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The soft magnetic properties examination of tested material contained coercive force, initial magnetic permeability and magnetic permeability relaxation measurements. Findings: The XRD and TEM investigations revealed that the studied as-cast samples were amorphous. Broad diffraction halo is typical for metallic amorphous structures that have a large degree of short-range order. The characteristics of the fractured surfaces showed different zones, which might correspond with different amorphous structures of studied materials. The temperature interval of the supercooled liquid region (ΔTx) defined by the difference between Tg and Tx, is as large as 56 K for the rod with diameter of 3 mm. Differences in coercivity and magnetic permeability between samples with different thickness might be resulted by some difference of amorphous structure. Practical implications: The centrifugal casting method and the pressure die casting method are useful to produce bulk amorphous materials in form of <b>rings,</b> plats <b>and</b> rods. Originality/value: The preparation of studied Fe-based bulk metallic glass in form of <b>rings,</b> <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> rods {{is important for the}} future progress in research and practical application of that glassy materials...|$|R

Two cases of transversely isotropic medium have been considered viz., (i) homogeneous transversely isotropic halfspace and (ii) multilayered transversely isotropic halfspace. The stiffness matrix for the <b>ring</b> <b>plate</b> has been obtained using ring elements (FEM) in an explicit form and the stiffness matrix for the transversely isotropic halfspace models considered here have been obtained using a general analytical solution.

40|$|Abstract. Cracking {{due to the}} {{restrained}} {{shrinkage stress}} has been frequently observed at early age in concrete structures. Early-age deterioration of concrete due to cracking and higher maintenance cost for poor durability cause serious troubles to concrete structures.

Two tests are outlined to quantify the behaviour of concrete under restrained shrinkage using <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> <b>ring</b> specimens.
