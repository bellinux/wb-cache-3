It is investigated, with measurements and models in the ray tracing program ZEMAX, what the surface roughness needed to be to get a homogeneous beam output with variations less than 1 %. A smooth integrated sphere with only specular reflections was tested, which did not result in a homogeneous beam output. A rough integrating sphere, with rms = 20 μm, was not a Lambertian scatterer for all wavelengths around 10 μm. It was also found that the transmssion was too low, which resulted in noise in the output signal of the integrating sphere. In the end it was not managed to find a right surface roughness with the measurements of ZEMAX. Nevertheless the rough integrating sphere gave a more homogeneous output. ...|$|R

5000|$|Various {{parameters}} are defined and specified {{to quantify the}} performance of optical switches. The steady state performance of an optical switch (or optical switching matrix) is measured by its ability to effectively transmit optical <b>power</b> from an <b>input</b> <b>port</b> {{to any one of}} N output ports over the “on” state transmission path, and its ability to effectively isolate <b>input</b> <b>power</b> sources from all non-active ports over the “off” state transmission paths. Other key optical performance parameters include transmission efficiency over a range of wavelengths, the ability to minimize <b>input</b> optical <b>power</b> reflected back into the input fiber, transmission balance, and bidirectional transmission. The optical switch (or switching matrix) transient behavior is another important characteristic that is specified by its speed of response to control stimulation via the time interval it takes to either transmit or block the optical signal on any given output port. Two rates can be associated with switches: the switching rate and the signal transmission rate. The switching rate is the rate at which a switch changes states. The signal transmission rate is the modulation rate of information passing through a switch. The signal transmission rate is usually much greater than the switching rate. (If the switching rate approaches or exceeds the transmission rate, then the switch can be called an optical modulator.) ...|$|R
