40|$|This Standard ECMA- 62 {{specifies}} {{the physical}} and magnetic char-acteristics of 12, 7 mm, 9 -track magnetic tape with reel, to enable interchangeability of such tapes. It also provides a format and three recording methods, thus allowing together with Standard ECMA- 13 for Magnetic Tape Labelling full data interchange by means of such magnetic tapes. The three me-thods defined in this Standard are:- NRZ 1 at the <b>physical</b> <b>recording</b> <b>density</b> of 32 ftpmm, yield-ing a data density of 32 cpmm,- Phase Encoding at the <b>physical</b> <b>recording</b> <b>density</b> of 126 ftpmm, yielding a data density of 63 cpmm,- NRZ 1 at the <b>physical</b> <b>recording</b> <b>density</b> of 356 ftpmm, yield-ing a data density of 246 cpmm when Group Coded Recording is used. 1. 2 Conformance 1...|$|E
40|$|In {{the past}} decades, ECMA has {{published}} numerous ECMA Standards for magnetic tapes, magnetic tape cassettes and cartridges, {{as well as}} for optical disk cartridges. Those media developed recently have a very high <b>physical</b> <b>recording</b> <b>density.</b> In order to make optimal use of the resulting data capacity, lossless compression algorithms have been designed that allow a reduction of the number of bits required for the representation of user data. These compression algorithms are registered by ECMA, the International Registration Authority established by ISO/IEC. The registration consists in allocating to each registered algorithm a numerical identifier that will be recorded on the medium and, thus, indicate which compression algorithm(s) has been used. This ECMA Standard is the fourth ECMA Standard for compression algorithms. The three previous standards are: ECMA- 15...|$|E

50|$|Files in OS 2200 {{are simply}} {{containers}} {{that may be}} addressed either by word offset in the file or by sector (28-word unit) offset in the file. The 28 words is a historical unit from an early mass storage device (the FASTRAND drum) that could hold 64 such units per physical track. Nonetheless, it is a fortunate historical accident. Four such 28-word units or 112 words occupy 504 bytes. With today’s mass storage devices all using 512-byte <b>physical</b> <b>records,</b> OS 2200 clients have almost all adopted some multiple of 112 words as their <b>physical</b> <b>record</b> size and database page size. I/O processors automatically adjust for the 504<->512 byte mapping adding 8 bytes of zeros on writes and stripping them off on reads of each <b>physical</b> <b>record.</b> OS 2200 handles applications that use sizes other than multiples of 112 words by indivisibly reading the containing <b>physical</b> <b>records</b> and writing back out the unchanged and changed portions with data chaining. Special locking functions guarantee indivisibility even when there are device errors and across multiple systems in a cluster.|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to define the {{perceived}} consumer values that <b>physical</b> <b>record</b> stores create in order to compete with other distribution technologies. A qualitative method has been used, based on interviews with managers of three records stores in Stockholm. Interviews with their customers have been conducted also. The content has been analyzed with passable theories and the two sources have been compared when adequate. The conclusion of the study is that the <b>physical</b> <b>record</b> stores create many different consumer values, and that many of these are hard to transfer to other distribution technologies. One of the most important values for the consumer is that the personnel have a broad knowledge about music. Other notable values are the emotional feelings of searching for something and the atmosphere the record store creates. A pattern that is visible is that the niche record stores create more consumer values then the commercial record store. The conclusions indicate that there are opportunities for niche <b>physical</b> <b>record</b> stores and that the future for the record stores is not as bleak as may be perceived...|$|R
40|$|Magnetic storage {{advances}} including thermal fly-height control (TFC) technology {{were able}} to reduce the clearance between the read/write elements of the slider and the disk surface to increase the <b>recording</b> <b>density</b> of hard disk drives without compromising {{the stability of the}} head–disk interface (HDI). Sliders employing TFC technology are designed for flying recording and can yield clearances of few nanometers. However, it is estimated that TFC technology alone cannot provide the even smaller clearances necessary to achieve Tbit/in^ 2 <b>recording</b> <b>densities</b> primarily due to the presence of instability-inducing vibrations at the HDI. In this work we perform optimization of the geometry of TFC technology sliders to achieve extremely high-density recording. We propose a flyability parameter coupled with a dynamic, contact mechanics-based friction model of the HDI that accounts for TFC geometry and its influence on the HDI dynamics. Optimization results are analyzed and an operating actuation range is identified that can yield Tbit/in^ 2 <b>recording</b> <b>densities</b> with Angstrom-level clearance and minimized vibrations while also accounting for manufacturing and operational tolerances. This allows for light (lubricant) contact or ‘surfing’ recording. The proposed methodology can be used to reduce wear at the interface and investigate the feasibility of contact recoding. ...|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} Natix, an efficient, native {{repository for}} storing, retrieving and managing treestructured large objects, preferably XML documents. In contrast to traditional large object (LOB) managers, {{we do not}} split at arbitrary byte positions but take the semantics of the underlying tree structure of XML documents into account. Our parameterizable split algorithm dynamically maintains <b>physical</b> <b>records</b> of size smaller than a page which contain sets of connected tree nodes. This not only improves efficiency by clustering subtrees but also facilitates their compact representation. Existing approaches to store XML documents either use at files or map every single tree node onto a separate <b>physical</b> <b>record.</b> The increased flexibility of our approach results in higher efficiency. Performance measurements validate this claim...|$|R

The thermal protrusion of a thermal flying height control (TFC) slider and the wave surface of an elastic-plastic thin film are chosen to perform a contact analysis at the head-disk interface (HDI). A two dimensional finite element model between head and patterned media is then developed. Two patterned media cases are investigated and presented in this paper. The evolution of deformation in multi-layer media due to mechanical surface loading is presented by maximum von Mises stress and contact pressure...|$|R
40|$|AbstractBit-patterned media {{recording}} (BPMR) {{is one of}} {{the promising}} techniques to be used to achieve the areal density beyond the super-paramagnetic limit. Nonetheless, the BPMR system is normally encountered both inter-symbol interference and inter-track interference, especially at high <b>recording</b> <b>densities.</b> This problem is {{regarded as one of the}} most challenging issues in the BPMR system. In this paper, we design a two-dimensional (2 D) cross-track symmetric target and its corresponding equalizer to combat both interferences. Furthermore, we also utilize an iterative scheme, which iteratively exchanges soft information between a 2 D SOVA detector and an LDPC decoder, to decode an input data sequence. Results indicate that the proposed method performs better than other methods, especially when the <b>recording</b> <b>density</b> is high...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} record spacing on track edge noise are studied for CoCrTa and CoCrPt/CoCrTa media. Variations in record {{spacings}} (seperation from magnetic media to write head pole tips) are accurately achieved {{by using an}} identical set of disks {{for each type of}} media, with different overcoat thicknesses. Track edge noise is characterized using track profiles of the media noise. An integrated spectral technique is used to measure media noise, and the effects of the different playback spacings (seperation from magnetic media to read head pole tips or read element) are removed by dividing the spectral playback loss factor from the media noise spectra. On track transition noise is studied as a function of linear density at three different record spacings for each media type. Transition noise is found to increase with linear <b>record</b> <b>density</b> as expected, as well as with record spacing for a given linear density. Track profiles were performed at three linear <b>record</b> <b>densities</b> for each <b>record</b> spacing to observe the density dependence of similar effects on track edge noise. For both media, on-track noise and track edge noise are found to decrease with reduced record spacing, and the amount of decrease are found to be <b>record</b> <b>density</b> dependent.
