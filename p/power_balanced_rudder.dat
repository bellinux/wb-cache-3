50|$|With a <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder.</b>|$|R
50|$|Attached to {{the rear}} end of the {{armoured}} tub was a slender rear fuselage which ended with a large <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder,</b> tailplane and elevator.|$|R
50|$|The R.E.P. 2 {{differed}} from the R.E.P. 1 in having a slightly different undercarriage (of the same general arrangement) {{in addition to a}} large ventral <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder.</b>|$|R
50|$|The <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> {{was made}} of 'Venesta' plywood. Macfie {{employed}} a sandwich construction, with a light framework glued between two 3-ply Venesta layers, thus combining lightness with strength.|$|R
50|$|The B-117 had a {{slightly}} tapered tailplane mounted a little above the fuselage and carrying unbalanced elevators. The twin broad-chord <b>balanced</b> <b>rudders</b> were on small fins, mounted close together over the fuselage sides.|$|R
50|$|The {{empennage}} of the RG.40 was conventional, with {{a triangular}} tailplane mounted at mid-fuselage carrying well separated elevators. The vertical surface was triangular overall, {{with a small}} fin but a generous and pointed <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder.</b>|$|R
2500|$|... 7D1 - initial {{prototype}} with comma-style <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder,</b> wide-chord I-struts, and upper wing supported by pylon faired into engine cowling. The entire fuselage was skinned in plywood. The radiator was {{mounted in the}} upper wing, set off the port side of the supporting pylon.|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} was a conventional unequal-span biplane design with wooden wings, while the fuselage was built using aluminum tubing with steel tie rod bracing. The landing gear was fixed and the tail included a <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> with a rear skid originally, later {{changed to a}} tailwheel.|$|R
50|$|The tail was {{conventional}} with a trapezoidal tailplane {{mounted on}} the upper fuselage carrying rectangular elevators. The angle of incidence of the tailplane could be adjusted in flight for trim but the elevators were not balanced. The Duverne-Saran had a triangular fin and rectangular <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder.</b>|$|R
5|$|An {{additional}} {{solution was}} to fit twin <b>balanced</b> <b>rudders</b> behind each inner shaft, {{in contrast to the}} single central rudder used on earlier ships. This greatly increased the effectiveness of the rudder and substantially decreased the turning circle of the Invincibles in comparison to earlier ships of their size.|$|R
25|$|Later in 1941, the LaGG-3 {{appeared}} with new armament options, an internally <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder,</b> retractable ski landing gear for the winter, retractable tailwheel and wing pipes for drop tanks. The result {{was still not}} good enough. Even with the lighter airframe and revised supercharged engine, the LaGG-3 was underpowered.|$|R
50|$|The Lascelles Ornis, {{built for}} the Lascelles company and {{exhibited}} on their stand at the 1910 Aero Show at Olympia, differed in having a 2 ft (0.6 m) longer fuselage, a rectangular <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder,</b> and different control arrangements. It was fitted with a propeller made by José Weiss.|$|R

50|$|The sharply swept fin (used to {{increase}} control power and stability {{with a smaller}} fuselage, reducing weight), was integral with the fuselage and supported the plywood skinned tail plane at approx ⅓ fin span. The mass <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> and elevators were built up from wood/plywood and fabric covered.|$|R
50|$|The {{completed}} H.2 had {{an almost}} straight-edged, broad-chord fin with a polygonal, slightly pointed, <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> which {{reached down to}} the keel. Its tailplane, which could be trimmed in flight, was mounted {{on top of the}} fuselage and carried separate elevators; in plan the horizontal tail was trapezoidal.|$|R
50|$|A <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> is a rudder {{in which}} the axis of {{rotation}} of the rudder is behind its front edge. This means that when the rudder is turned, the pressure of water caused by the ship's movement through the water acts upon the forward part to exert a force which increases the angle of deflection, so counteracting the pressure acting on the after part, which acts to reduce the angle of deflection. A degree of semi-balance is normal to avoid rudder instability i.e. the area {{in front of the}} pivot is less than that behind. This allows the rudder to be moved with less effort than is necessary with an unbalanced rudder.The <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> was invented by Isambard Kingdom Brunel and first used on the SS Great Britain, launched in 1843.|$|R
50|$|The {{horizontal}} tail {{was essentially}} trapezoidal in plan and included balanced elevators {{which had a}} nick for operation of a <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder.</b> The fin was trapezoidal in profile and the rudder straight-edged, though with a rounded top. It extended to the keel. The tail surfaces were fabric covered metal structures.|$|R
50|$|After testing during May and June 1912 the fins were removed, and an {{enlarged}} aerodynamically <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> fitted. The aircraft {{was sold to}} the Deutsche Bristol Werke. However it {{was found to be}} unsuitable for use as a trainer, and was returned to the Bristol works at Filton in September 1912 and scrapped.|$|R
50|$|The Caproni Ca.61 and Ca.61a {{were the}} final {{evolution}} of the Caproni Ca.1 bomber of 1914. The Ca.61 retained the twin boom biplane layout, the three engines in push-pull configuration and the approximate dimensions of the 1916 Ca.36, the main Ca.3 type production variant, but had more modern, streamlined structures and <b>balanced</b> <b>rudders.</b>|$|R
50|$|The A.23's straight-edged tailplane, {{mounted on}} the upper {{fuselage}} and strut-braced from below, was adjustable in flight and carried separate rounded, balanced elevators. Its fin was small, with a large, rounded, <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> which extended down to the keel and worked in {{a gap between the}} elevators. All components were steel-framed and fabric-covered.|$|R
2500|$|After testing during May and June 1912 the fins were removed, and an {{enlarged}} aerodynamically <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> fitted. The aircraft {{was sold to}} the Deutsche Bristol Werke. [...] However it {{was found to be}} unsuitable for use as a trainer, and was returned to the Bristol works at Filton in September 1912 and scrapped.|$|R
50|$|The G-27's {{empennage}} was conventional. A parabolic vertical tail, with a {{trim tab}} equipped <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder,</b> reached aft {{to the extreme}} fuselage. A small gap between fuselage and {{the bottom of the}} rudder allowed upward deflections of the balanced, tabbed elevators mounted on a tailplane with a strongly swept leading edge, positioned at mid-fuselage height.|$|R
50|$|The B-4's {{empennage}} was conventional, framed {{like the}} wings and fabric covered. The tailplane was mounted at mid-fuselage height; its angle of incidence could be varied in-flight for trimming. It carried split, unbalanced elevators. There was a small fin with a curved-topped, straight-edged <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> which extended down to the keel between the elevators.|$|R
50|$|There were initial {{structural}} {{problems with the}} new tail, and most production aircraft of the type were of the Nieuport 24bis model, which retained the fuselage and wings of the 24, but reverted to the Nieuport 17 type tailplane, tailskid and rectangular <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder.</b> The new tail was finally standardised on the Nieuport 27.|$|R
5|$|In 1914, {{the crew}} {{numbered}} 803 officers and enlisted men. The Swiftsures were quite manoeuvrable {{as a result}} of their <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> and a hull form optimized to make the rudder more effective. They were the last British battleships to enter service with bow crests and were also were the last to enter service equipped with ventilation cowls.|$|R
25|$|The third Algol {{engine was}} in {{the nose of the}} {{fuselage}}; behind it the cockpit was just ahead of the leading edge. The flat sided fuselage consisted of two parts, bolted together, and contained a cabin for ten passengers with a lavatory and luggage compartment. The tail surfaces were straight edged and conventional, with a <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder.</b>|$|R
50|$|The CAMS 54 had a tall, straight-edged fin and <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder.</b> Its {{rectangular}} plan, wire braced tailplane {{was mounted}} about {{halfway up the}} fin. Its constant chord, balanced elevators were also essentially rectangular, separated by a cut-out for rudder movement. All the rear surfaces were fabric covered; the fixed parts were wood-framed and the control surfaces metal.|$|R

50|$|At {{the rear}} a tall, {{straight}} edged fin mounted a narrow rectangular <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> {{and also the}} high aspect ratio, parallel chord tailplane, positioned about halfway up the fin {{to keep it out}} of the spray and braced with a single strut on each side {{to the top of the}} hull. It had separate, narrow chord elevators.|$|R

The flat sided fuselage consisted of two parts, bolted together, and contained a cabin for ten passengers with a lavatory and luggage compartment. The tail surfaces were straight edged and conventional, with a <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder.</b>|$|R
50|$|The empennages of the S.55 and S.63 were similar, {{though the}} latter had two {{vertical}} tails rather than three. These were wire-braced and, including <b>balanced</b> <b>rudders,</b> quadrantal in profile, with one attached to each girder. A rectangular tailplane, mounted {{at a high}} incidence, linked the girders and projected beyond them. It carried a semi-elliptical, balanced elevator.|$|R
5000|$|... rudders: two <b>balanced</b> spade <b>rudders</b> (2011-2013 series) with T-type {{horizontal}} stabilizers (2015-2016 series) ...|$|R
25|$|To save weight, {{electric}} welding was used, as was aluminum in the superstructure, {{and a single}} funnel stack. New impulse geared turbine engines, driving four shafts with three-bladed propellers gave {{a top speed of}} , which was better than most contemporary cruiser designs and the Mogami class has twin <b>balanced</b> <b>rudders,</b> rather than the single rudder of previous Japanese cruiser designs.|$|R
5000|$|<b>Balanced</b> <b>rudders</b> {{are used}} by both ships and aircraft. Both may {{indicate}} {{a portion of the}} rudder surface ahead of the hinge, placed to lower the control loads needed to turn the rudder. For aircraft the method can also be applied to elevators and ailerons; all three aircraft control surfaces may also be mass balanced, chiefly to avoid aerodynamic flutter.|$|R
2500|$|Its tail was conventional, {{with wooden}} {{structures}} and tapered, round-tipped surfaces. The elevators and the leading {{edges of the}} rudder (there was no fin) were ply-covered boxes, with silk elsewhere. [...] The tailplane's angle of incidence could be adjusted {{on the ground for}} trimming but its elevators were unbalanced. A large <b>balanced</b> <b>rudder</b> reached down to the keel and worked in an elevator cut-out.|$|R
