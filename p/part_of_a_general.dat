The Reich Health Office took measures to try to limit smoking, including producing lectures and pamphlets. Smoking was banned in many workplaces, on trains and among on-duty members of the military. Government agencies also worked to control other carcinogenic substances such as asbestos and pesticides.

5|$|Initial Allied {{goals for}} the landing at Arawe {{included}} securing a base for American PT boats and diverting Japanese forces away from Cape Gloucester. The PT boat base was subsequently deemed unnecessary and was never built. Only a small Japanese force was stationed at Arawe at the time, although reinforcements were en route. The main Allied landing on 15December was successful, despite a failed subsidiary landing and problems coordinating the landing craft. American forces quickly secured a beachhead and dug in. Japanese air units made large-scale raids against the Arawe area {{in the days after}} the landing, and in late December Imperial Japanese Army (IJA) troops unsuccessfully counterattacked the American force. In mid-January 1944 the American force, reinforced with additional infantry and tanks, launched a brief offensive that pushed the Japanese back. The Japanese units at Arawe withdrew from the area towards the end of February as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> retreat from western New Britain.|$|E

Edmund did not possess sufficient finances to maintain his status as a duke, so as a compromise he accepted the title of earl of Suffolk. Financial difficulties led to frequent legal conflicts and Edmund's indictment for murder in 1501. He fled with his brother Richard, while their remaining brother, William, was imprisoned in the Towerwhere he would remain until his death 37 years lateras <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> suppression of Edmund's associates Philip the Fair had been holding Edmund and in 1506 he returned him to Henry.

The withdrawal itself took two weeks, with minimal casualties or disruption in a move of an Army group numbering approximately 300,000 men, 100 tanks and 400 artillery pieces.

5|$|The A9, {{the great}} road {{connecting}} Edinburgh with Inverness {{and the far}} north, once ran through Evanton, {{on the path of}} Balconie Street. However, a bypass was created as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> scheme to shorten the journey between Inverness to Invergordon. This reduced the amount of traffic going through the village, but decreased the revenue available to local businesses. The road also cut through much of the farmland of the zone, distorting the shape of the fields. This was compounded by the closure of the filling station in the village. For those who do not have cars, the only means of transport is either by foot or by the #25 bus service operated by Stagecoach. Recently, the express service running from Inverness to Dornoch began to stop in Evanton. Now residents can travel from and to Inverness without the long diversion through Dingwall, making it easier to work in the city of Inverness without personal transport.|$|E

As Lalic points out:White can no longer castle kingside and will usually have to go the other way. However, this is rather slow and gives Black time to try to undermine the white centre. To this end Bc8–g4 often comes in handy, in order to pin the white knight on f3 against the white queen. Note that Black should wait until his opponent has wasted a tempo with Qe2.|$|E

5|$|At {{the time}} of formation, No.1 SFTS came {{under the control of}} Southern Area Command, {{headquartered}} in Melbourne. The school's complement of 52 aircraft included Wapitis, Cadets, Avro Ansons, Hawker Demons, and a deHavilland Tiger Moth. Group Captain John McCauley served as commanding officer from October 1940 until July 1941, when he handed over to Wing Commander Roy King, who went on to take charge of Station Headquarters Point Cook in October. As of July, No.1 SFTS was operating more than 100 aircraft, including Gipsy Moths, deHavilland DH.89 Dragon Rapides, Douglas C-47 Dakotas, CAC Wirraways and Airspeed Oxfords, the last two being the mainstays. In August 1941, control of all training units in Victoria passed from Southern Area Command to the newly formed No.1 Training Group. By September, the school had an establishment of 100 officers and over 2,000 airmen, including 300 cadets. It was organised into Intermediate Training Squadron, Advanced Training Squadron, Maintenance Wing, Armament School, and Signal School. Wing Commander Charles Read held command of No.1 SFTS from October 1943 until its disbandment on 15September 1944, by which time almost 3,000 pilots had graduated. Among these were Nicky Barr, who became one of Australia's leading fighter aces in North Africa, and Bill Newton, awarded the Victoria Cross for bombing raids in New Guinea. The RAAF had ordered the school's closure in August 1944 as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> reduction in aircrew training, after being informed by the British Air Ministry that it no longer required EATS graduates for the war in Europe. Significant reserves of trained Commonwealth aircrew had been built up in the UK early in 1944 prior to the invasion of Normandy, but lower-than-anticipated casualties had resulted in an over-supply that by 30June numbered 3,000 Australians.|$|E

Training units in New South Wales came under the control of No.2 (Training) Group. On 10September, a student was killed when his Tiger Moth crashed south of Tamworth aerodrome. All flying training at No.1 EFTS came to an end on 15September, by which time a total of 1,991 students had passed through the school. Pilots still undergoing instruction were posted to No.8 Elementary Flying School at Narrendera, New South Wales, and No.11 Elementary Flying School at Benalla, Victoria. The RAAF had ordered the school's closure in August 1944 as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> reduction in aircrew training, after being informed by the British Air Ministry that it no longer required EATS graduates for the war in Europe.

No.1 EFTS was officially disbanded on 12December 1944. Care and Maintenance Unit (CMU) Tamworth was formed the same day, utilising some of No.1 EFTS's staff. It was one of many CMUs that the RAAF raised for the storage and upkeep of surplus aircraft prior to their disposal after the war. CMU Tamworth was disbanded on 5July 1947.|$|E
5|$|The {{station was}} built on a site of the medieval steelyard, the trading base in England of the Hanseatic League. It was built by the South Eastern Railway {{in order to have}} a railway {{terminal}} in the City and compete with their rivals, the London, Chatham and Dover Railway. The City location of the station necessitated a new bridge across the River Thames, which was constructed between 1863 and 1866. The station was initially a stop for continental services from Charing Cross, and that route was convenient for travel between the City and the West End, until the construction of the District Railway. It remained popular with commuters, though its off-peak services were discontinued in the early 20th century, leading to it being closed on Sundays for almost 100 years. The original hotel on the station was unsuccessful, and eventually closed. The station was controversially renovated in the late 1950s by John Poulson, while further construction on top of the station building occurred during the City's 1980s property boom. The Poulson building was replaced in 2007 as <b>part</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>general</b> renovation of the station to make it more accessible. As part of the Thameslink Programme development in the 2010s, it was re-opened on Sundays and began to offer more long-distance services in place of Charing Cross.|$|E
