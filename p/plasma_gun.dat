5|$|Unable {{to enter}} Cortex's castle after getting there via bridge, Crash climbs the tower walls, {{and enters the}} castle through the window he had {{previously}} escaped from. After making {{his way through the}} dark hallways and the Castle's many machines, Crash is confronted by Brio inside his laboratory. Brio uses chemicals to mutate himself into a monster. While Crash is successful in defeating Brio, the castle laboratory catches on fire during the struggle. Crash escapes to Cortex's airship, where he confronts Cortex himself as the castle burns. Cortex attacks him with a <b>plasma</b> <b>gun,</b> but Crash deflects his own projectiles against him and sends Cortex falling out of the sky. Tawna embraces Crash as the two escape the burning castle on Cortex's airship.|$|E
50|$|Rather {{than the}} fast-paced action of Wolfenstein 3D, Nitemare 3D has a {{slightly}} slower, more puzzle-oriented style of gameplay. The four weapons (<b>plasma</b> <b>gun,</b> magic wand, pistol, and auto-repeat <b>plasma</b> <b>gun)</b> have different usages—for example, magic blasts are especially useful against magical creatures such as witches, whereas robots are practically immune to them. Meanwhile, vampires take heavy damage from silver bullets, while shrugging off {{the effects of the}} <b>plasma</b> <b>gun.</b> Each level in the game has numerous secret panels, some of which were purely for bonuses, but others are essential to completing the level. To make this task easier, the player can collect magic eyes, which enable the player to activate a mini-map in the game's HUD and give hints as to the locations of panels, and crystal balls for displaying the location of enemies.|$|E

40|$|We {{describe}} an experiment {{to form and}} characterize a section of a spherically imploding plasma liner by merging six supersonic plasma jets that are launched by newly designed contoured-gap coaxial <b>plasma</b> <b>guns.</b> This experiment is a prelude to forming a fully spherical imploding plasma liner using many dozens of <b>plasma</b> <b>guns,</b> as a standoff driver for plasma-jet-driven magneto-inertial fusion.

40|$|Spheromaks are {{a stable}} {{configuration}} of plasma {{in which the}} motion of charged particles within the plasma create confining magnetic fields. These magnetic fields have both a poloidal component and a toroidal component. The magnetic fields are sustained by a toroidal current within the plasma.
