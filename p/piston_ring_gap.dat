40|$|Automotive {{engine is}} one of the {{internal}} combustion engines in which combustion of mixture (air-fuel) burn internally. It contain different parts which are to relate together to have required engine efficiency. Among these parts is the piston which contains the piston ring that maintains a perfect seal between the cylinder wall and the piston. The dimensional relationship of the piston ring determines the degree by which their seats in the groove of the piston thereby determine the efficiency of the compression of the engine which affects the output of the engine. This paper examines the effect of piston ring radial thickness on the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gap.</b> Visual basic computer code was developed for computation of piston ring radial thickness corresponding to the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gap.</b> Aided by the developed software, the relationship between piston ring radial thickness and <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gap</b> was investigated. Results obtained for case studies examined by varying the angular coordinate of the ring, showed that <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gap</b> increases with piston ring radial thickness.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is largely concerned with developing {{a greater understanding of}} piston ring lubrication by measuring the thickness of hydrodynamic films developed between the piston ring and the cylinder wall of an internal combustion engine.

40|$|The {{presence}} of lubricant mist in the piston assembly of an automotive engine {{has been known}} of for many years, but has not been specifically investigated. This study, therefore, focuses on understanding the lubricant misting process {{and its effect on}} the engine in terms of lubricant degradation. Informed by existing literature, it was hypothesised that mist is formed in the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> <b>gaps.</b> A laboratory rig was designed and built to simulate this environment, producing and measuring representative mist flows. Using this rig, the contribution of the components of a commercial lubricant to its misting properties was studied. Base oil viscosity and molecular weight, and the {{presence of}} polymeric viscosity modifiers were identified as being the key parameters controlling the tendency of an oil to form mist. Further investigation using viscosity modifiers of varying size and molecular structure was performed, indicating differences between the behaviour of linear and star polymers. Measurements of the droplet flows in the crankcase of an engine were made using a particle sizer. These confirmed the dependency of misting properties on viscosity, and validated the hypothesis that lubricant mist in the crankcase is formed in the piston assembly by a similar mechanism to that produced in the laboratory rig. Longer engine tests were used to investigate the effect of lubricants with varying misting tendency on lubricant degradation. A range of chemical and rheological analyses were performed to compare fresh and used lubricant samples in different flows and positions in the engine. These tests were not able to differentiate between the degradation of the different lubricants tested, though the degradation of lubricant in different positions in the engine varied significantly. It was shown that lubricant mist is formed in the piston assembly and that lubricant misting is a significant lubricant transport mechanism.

40|$|The work {{presented}} in this thesis is concerned with developing {{a greater understanding of}} <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> lubrication and consists of both experimental and theoretical components. It begins with a review of <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> and ring pack lubrication studies, describing how the understanding of the operation of <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> has progressed since the late 19 th Century. A well-established method of analysing the hydrodynamic lubrication of a single <b>piston</b> <b>ring,</b> utilizing coordinate data to describe the ring face profile, is then presented. Calculation of mixed/boundary friction, when the lubricant film thickness falls below a pre-determined level, is included. The predictions of this program are then compared to results obtained by other workers to validate its operation. This analysis is then developed to investigate the influence of the circumferential variation in <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> face profile on the lateral motion of the <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> centre. The complex relationship between variation in ring face profile, angular <b>ring</b> <b>gap</b> position and bore shape is then examined. These features are shown to {{have a significant effect on}} the calculation of ring centre locus, oil transport and lubricant film thicknesses. The model is then applied to predict the influence of the distorted bore shape of a cylinder from an experimental engine apparatus. Following this, the development, testing, calibration and performance of a capacitance based measurement system capable of recording <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> face profiles on a single pass, is described. This system was used with twenty-one transducers, of novel design, to allow the axial and circumferential distribution of lubricant film thickness to be monitored on an engine liner. This liner was fitted in an engine apparatus which had the additional facility of being able to measure the instantaneous friction between the piston assembly and cylinder liner using a "floating liner" technique. Experimental measurements of instantaneous friction force and the circumferential distribution of lubricant film thickness are then compared to theoretical predictions for a range of operating conditions. The comparisons reveal a reasonable level of agreement between measurements with consistent overall trends. The effect of varying bore distortion is also examined theoretically. It is shown that an increase in the severity of bore distortion does not necessarily result in an increase in net oil transport...|$|R

In this paper, the finite element method (FEM) was applied to study the non-uniform pressure distributions among the <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> and the friction process between the self-lubricating <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> and the cylinder wall, which influence {{the failure of the}} self-lubricated <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> most.

40|$|The oil {{consumption}} {{characteristics of a}} four cylinder, normally aspirated spark-ignition engine were investigated for different <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> end-gap configurations. A radiotracer was used to perform direct measurement of the {{oil consumption}} while Laser-induced Fluorescence (LIF) was used to perform the oil film thickness measurements for consumption predictions using the "Puddle Theory of Oil Consumption, " which relates oil consumption to second land film thickness and reverse flow through top <b>ring</b> <b>gap.</b> The consumption data was evaluated to determine the impact of top ring end-gap azimuthal location on oil consumption. The film thickness data {{was used to evaluate}} {{the extent to which the}} Oil Puddle Theory predicts variations seen in the actual oil consumption. A tritium radiotracer oil consumption measurement system with an accuracy of 94. 6 % was designed and constructed. This was used to perform direct measurements of the test engine oil consumption in two different test matrices. The first evaluated a <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> configuration with the rings free to rotate. The second evaluated configurations with the top <b>ring</b> and second <b>piston</b> <b>rings</b> pinned to fix the azimuthal location of the end-gap; the azimuth of the top ring was varied. In the second test matrix, the oil film thickness on the piston's second land was measured, and predictions were made on the basis of that measurement. The first test matrix results indicated only a weak speed dependence and a large amount of variability in the oil consumption measurements. The second test matrix results showed an oil consumption speed dependence that was a function of top gap azimuth. Speed normalized results showed that the oil consumption was larger when the end-gap was on the thrust side of the test engine than when on the anti-thrust side. Measured oil consumption differed substantially from that predicted. This was found to be due to difficulties in determining effective <b>ring</b> <b>gap</b> flow areas and due to a previously un-documented azimuthal variation in second land oil film thickness. However, analysis of the results also indicates that the Puddle Theory is still a plausible oil consumption mechanism. [URL]...|$|R

To solve this problem, the wear resistance level toward friction for <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> during its interaction with the cylinder liner was enhanced using diffusion coating technique. The <b>piston</b> <b>ring</b> is made of ASSAB DF- 3 steel and several substances such as 0. 9 % carbon (C), 0. 85 % chromium (Cr), 96. 6 % ferric (Fe), 1. 2 % manganese (Mn) and 0. 55 % titanium.
