5|$|Foucault's {{analysis}} of Las Meninas, although {{on one level}} a contribution to art history, is more about epistemology, specifically the 'cognitive status of the modern human sciences', based on the possibility, suggested by Ludwig Wittgenstein, that a <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> a model of reality.|$|E
5|$|Even {{though to}} me, a Japanese schoolgirl uniform {{is kind of}} like blackface, I am just in {{acceptance}} over it, because something is better than nothing. An ugly <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> better than a blank space, and it means that one day, we will have another display at the Museum of Asian Invisibility, that groups of children will crowd around in disbelief, because once upon a time, we weren’t there.|$|E

50|$|If ASO across <b>pictures</b> <b>is</b> {{supported}} in AVC, serious issues arise: slices from different <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> interleaved. One possible {{way to solve}} these issues is to limit ASO within a picture, i.e. slices from different <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> not interleaved.|$|R
50|$|Pictures hold two {{encoding}} {{advantages over}} words. <b>Pictures</b> <b>are</b> perceptually more distinct {{from one another}} than are words, thus increasing their chance for retrieval. In experiments when similarity among <b>pictures</b> <b>was</b> high, no <b>picture</b> superiority effect <b>was</b> present. <b>Pictures</b> <b>are</b> also believed to assess meaning more directly than words. Levels of processing theory apply when words and <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> compared under semantic study instructions (rate the pleasantness of each item), recall is very similar for pictures and words, as both were encoded at deeper levels.|$|R

5|$|Palatography {{involves}} {{the painting of}} a colored substance onto the tongue which is then transferred onto the palate during articulation. A <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> then taken of the palate to record the location of contact and, if another palatogram is to be taken, the mouth is washed out and the tongue repainted.

5|$|The Dirty <b>Picture</b> <b>is</b> a 2011 Indian biographical drama film {{directed}} by Milan Luthria and produced by Shobha and Ekta Kapoor.

The Dirty Picture features Vidya Balan in the lead role, and co-stars Emraan Hashmi, Tusshar Kapoor and Naseeruddin Shah. Rajat Arora wrote the screenplay, dialogues and lyrics for the film and Vishal–Shekhar composed the music.|$|E

5|$|Whatever one's {{suspicions about}} its use or {{abuse of the}} evidence, JFK is a knockout. Part history book, part comic book, the movie rushes toward {{judgment}} for three breathless hours, lassoing facts and factoids by the thousands, then bundling them together into an incendiary device that would frag any viewer's complacency. Stone's <b>picture</b> <b>is,</b> in both meanings of the word, sensational: it's tip-top tabloid journalism. In its bravura and breadth, JFK is seditiously enthralling; in its craft, wondrously complex.|$|E
5|$|Arrested and exposed, Sideshow Bob confesses that {{he hated}} Krusty {{and the reason}} he framed Krusty was because he spent years {{constantly}} being {{on the receiving end}} of the clown's humiliating gags. He vows revenge on Bart, setting up a regular plotline in future episodes. The charges against Krusty are dropped and he regains the trust of the community. Homer then apologizes to Krusty for fingering him in court, and Krusty thanks Bart for standing up for the truth and sticking to his convictions, and a <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> taken of the two shaking hands (which Bart later hangs in his bedroom, refilled with Krusty decor).|$|E
5|$|Further {{recognition}} {{came with}} the hanging of one of Fuller's paintings, Summer Breezes, at the Royal Academy in 1904. Other Australian artists whose works were hung {{at the same time}} included Rupert Bunny, E. Phillips Fox, Albert Fullwood, George Lambert, and Arthur Streeton. Fuller was the only woman painter to be represented. A critic writing in The West Australian observed:The work... is essentially Australian in almost every detail. Standing in a sunlit Australian paddock, a lithesome Australian blonde holds her summer hat on against the rude caresses of an Australian breeze—a subject simple but grand in its simplicity... Next to its suggestion of breezy sunshine and the incidental portrayal of willowy grace the <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> to be admired for its colour scheme... The details of the picture disclose untiring care.|$|E

5|$|In Baby Face Stanwyck {{moves to}} New York and sleeps {{her way to}} the top of Gotham Trust. Her {{progress}} is illustrated in a recurring visual metaphor of the movie camera panning ever upward along the front of Gotham Trust's skyscraper. Men are driven mad with lust over her and they commit murder, attempt suicide, and are ruined financially for associating with her before she mends her ways in the final reel. In another departure from post Code films, Stanwyck's sole companion for the duration of the <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> a black woman named Chico (Theresa Harris), whom she took with her when she ran away from home at age 14.|$|E
5|$|On an {{examining}} table, {{one of the}} kidnappers, Eric Swan (James Marsters), strips Taylor, harshly washes {{her with}} a course brush, and photographs her. The <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> sent to Watts, who is seen looking at it while supervising the crime scene. Black is also at the scene, and experiences a vision of Operation Desert Storm. Evidence is found of military-style tyre and boot tracks; these lead the FBI to an address where they find the second kidnapper murdered—Black and Watts clash over whether the Group or Swan are responsible. Back in the examination room, Swan exposes Taylor to a substance contained in a canister.|$|E

Mulder goes to the Stokes residence and asks Leslie to hand her over, presuming her to be kept in a box. It turns out, however, that she is not in the box, but back in the storage facility, where Mulder also finds pictures of the jinniyah next to Benito Mussolini in the 1930s and next to Richard Nixon in the 1960s, two men that had a lot of power and lost it in a bad way.|$|E

5|$|The Dirty <b>Picture</b> <b>is</b> a 2011 Indian biographical musical drama film {{inspired}} by the life of Silk Smitha, a South Indian actress noted for her erotic roles. The filmmakers have clarified that the story is not officially or literally based on Smitha alone, but on many of her southern contemporaries such as Disco Shanti. It also resembles the personal lives of other women in popular culture, including Hollywood actress and sex symbol Marilyn Monroe. The film was directed by Milan Luthria and co-produced by Shobha Kapoor and Ekta Kapoor, after Ekta {{came up with the}} idea and asked screenwriter Rajat Aroraa to pen a story based on it.|$|E

30|$|First, we {{examined}} empirically {{the moment of}} processing of the pictures, testing the assumption of the CoLiDeS[*]+[*]Pic model that <b>pictures</b> <b>are</b> processed {{in the initial stages}} of navigation through a webpage [16].

We found that <b>pictures</b> <b>were</b> processed mainly in the first 10  % of the total time spent on a web-page during the first visit of participants on that page.

This is the most Mannerist of Michelangelo's earlier compositions at the Sistine Chapel, picking up the theme of human distress begun in the Great Flood scene and carrying it forward into the torment of lost souls in the Last Judgement, which was later painted below.|$|E
5|$|Growth, {{employment}} and household income have lagged behind the South, {{and the five}} most deprived districts in England are all in Northern England, as are ten of the twelve most declining major towns in the UK. The <b>picture</b> <b>is</b> not clear-cut, as the North has areas which are as wealthy as, if not wealthier than, fashionable Southern areas such as Surrey. Yorkshire's Golden Triangle which extends from north Leeds to Harrogate and across to York is an example, as is Cheshire's Golden Triangle, centred on Alderley Edge. There are major disparities even across individual cities: Sheffield Hallam {{is one of the}} wealthiest constituencies in the country, and is the richest outside London and the South East, while Sheffield Brightside and Hillsborough, just {{on the other side of}} the city, is one of the most deprived. Housing in Northern England is more affordable than the UK average: the median house price in most Northern cities was below £200,000 in 2015 with typical increases of below 10% over the previous five years. However, some areas have seen house prices fall considerably, putting inhabitants at risk of negative equity.|$|E
