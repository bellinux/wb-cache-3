40|$|<b>Pour</b> size {{as one of}} {{the site}} factors {{affecting}} concreting was examined to determine its effects on concreting productivity. A total of 167 separate concrete <b>pours</b> were observed on 25 building construction sites in Lagos, Nigeria,comprising 35 <b>pours</b> placed by crane and skip; 26 <b>pours</b> placed by dumper; 58 <b>pours</b> placed by wheelbarrow; 37 <b>pours</b> placed by head pan; and 11 <b>pours</b> placed jointly by pump, wheelbarrow and head pan. Data collected from the daily concrete <b>pours</b> were analyzed to determine operational productivity rates. The relationship between concreting productivity and <b>pour</b> size was examined using regression analyses to develop a model relating productivity to <b>pour</b> size. The results showed that irrespective of placing method, productivity generally increased by 1. 1 m 3 /h for every 10 m 3 increase in <b>pour</b> size. It was recommended that the obtained index of productivity increase per <b>pour</b> size be standardised for use in improving on-site productivity in the Nigerian construction industry...|$|R

5|$|Most beers are {{cleared of}} yeast by {{filtering}} when packaged in bottles and cans. However, bottle conditioned beers retain some yeast—either by being unfiltered, or by being filtered and then reseeded with fresh yeast. It is usually {{recommended that the}} beer be <b>poured</b> slowly, leaving any yeast sediment {{at the bottom of}} the bottle. However, some drinkers prefer to pour in the yeast; this practice is customary with wheat beers. Typically, when serving a hefeweizen wheat beer, 90% of the contents are <b>poured,</b> and the remainder is swirled to suspend the sediment before pouring it into the glass. Alternatively, the bottle may be inverted prior to opening. Glass bottles are always used for bottle conditioned beers.|$|E

Construction of the segmental concrete box-girder replacement was complicated by the need to protect the wetlands below, a problem that was solved by building the bridge from the top down and taking measures to allow the concrete piers to be <b>poured</b> and dried during winter.|$|E

The performance of the <b>pour</b> point depressants on solubility in diesel and the drop of <b>pour</b> point on Daqing crude oil was studied. The results showed that styrene and vinyl acetate could increase the solubility of the <b>pour</b> point depressants; maleic anhydride and acrylamide could improve the drop of crude oil <b>pour</b> point; tercopolymer <b>pour</b> point depressants are more effective on the flow of crude oil than dimeric polymers, the highest drop of <b>pour</b> point was 14 ℃.

Traditionally, the National Trust has relied on sheep from surrounding farms to graze the site.

In 2006, the National Trust carried out the first wildlife survey of the Cerne Abbas Giant, identifying wild flowers including the green-winged orchid, clustered bellflower and autumn gentian, which are uncommon in England.|$|E
