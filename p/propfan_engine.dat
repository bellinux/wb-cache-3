50|$|In {{a bid for}} {{increased}} efficiency with speed, a development of the turbofan and turboprop known as a <b>propfan</b> <b>engine</b> was created that had an unducted fan. The fan blades are situated outside of the duct, so that it appears like a turboprop with wide scimitar-like blades. Both General Electric and Pratt & Whitney/Allison demonstrated propfan engines in the 1980s. Excessive cabin noise and relatively cheap jet fuel prevented the engines being put into service. The Progress D-27 propfan, developed in the U.S.S.R., was the only <b>propfan</b> <b>engine</b> equipped on a production aircraft.|$|E

40|$|Bachelor {{thesis is}} written in the search form and {{discusses}} <b>propfan</b> aircraft <b>engines.</b> After introducing the concept itself, the first part deals with the principle functioning of engines and propulsion efficiency. The second part briefly describes the construction of these engines {{with a focus on}} specific parts of <b>propfan</b> <b>engines</b> differentiating concept from other aircraft engines. Then summarizes the features of these engines, describes their advantages and disadvantages and the possibilities of eliminating disadvantages.

50|$|The RB3011 is {{designed}} for the 180-300 passenger aircraft (e.g. Boeing 737 or Airbus A320). Rolls-Royce bought the Allison Engine Company in 1995, and has studied the Pratt & Whitney/Allison 578-DX <b>propfan</b> <b>engine</b> built in the 1980s.|$|E
50|$|Conversion as testbed for Progress D-236 <b>propfan</b> <b>engine.</b> Single D-236 (rated at 8,090 kW (10,850shp)) {{mounted in}} place of {{starboard}} engine, on special pylon to give sufficient clearance for 4.2 m (13 ft 9¾ in) propellers. First flew 15 March 1991.|$|E
50|$|The Progress D-27 is a three-shaft <b>propfan</b> <b>engine</b> {{developed}} by Ivchenko Progress. It {{is not clear}} whether the D-27 engine's core is related to or derived from the D-36 turbofan which is a three-shaft turbofan. The D-27 engine was developed specifically to power more efficient passenger aircraft such as the abandoned Yak-46 project and it was chosen to power the An-70 military transport aircraft. The D-27 {{is expected to be a}} base platform for future engine derivatives.|$|E

50|$|<b>Propfan</b> <b>engines</b> use {{contra-rotating}} scimitar propellers {{to achieve}} turboprop efficiency levels at high subsonic air speeds {{comparable to that}} of turbofans.|$|R
500|$|The An-70 is a {{monoplane}} with a high-mounted wing {{design that}} features four distinctive <b>propfan</b> <b>engines.</b> Designed by the Progress Design Bureau, {{each of the}} D-27 engines is rated at 13,800shp (which can be uprated to 16,000shp), {{which is used to}} drive the SV-27 [...] contra-rotating scimitar propellers designed by Aerosila; eight on the front propeller and six on the aft propeller. The <b>propfan</b> <b>engines</b> deliver slipstream to the supercritical wings that feature double-slotted trailing edges to provide high lift coefficients at low speeds. The modernisation of the aircraft during 2010–12 saw upgrades to the engines, including the incorporation of FADEC, and the further separation of the two propellers. The aircraft's cruise speed is 750km/h (405kt) at an operational altitude of Antonov claimed in 1997 that the aircraft had a design maximum speed of 850km/h (460kt, or Mach0.8), which would have compared favourably with Mach0.77 of the larger turbofan-powered C-17. According to DASA's evaluation, the <b>propfan</b> <b>engines</b> were 10percent more efficient than conventional turboprops.|$|R
50|$|An attractively simple {{configuration}} {{making use}} of the free turbine is the <b>propfan</b> <b>engine,</b> with a rear-mounted unducted fan in pusher configuration, rather than the more familiar tractor layout. The first such engine was the very early and promising Metropolitan-Vickers F.3 of 1942 with a ducted fan, followed by the unducted and much lighter F.5. Development of these engines stopped abruptly owing to corporate takeovers, rather than technical reasons. Rolls-Royce continued with design studies for such engines into the 1980s, as did GE, but {{they have yet to}} appear as commercial engines.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>propfan</b> <b>engine</b> (also called [...] "unducted fan", [...] "open rotor", or [...] "ultra-high bypass") is a {{jet engine}} that uses its gas {{generator}} to power an exposed fan, similar to turboprop engines. Like turboprop engines, propfans generate {{most of their}} thrust from the propeller and not the exhaust jet. The primary difference between turboprop and propfan design is that the propeller blades on a propfan are highly swept {{to allow them to}} operate at speeds around Mach 0.8, which is competitive with modern commercial turbofans. These engines have the fuel efficiency advantages of turboprops with the performance capability of commercial turbofans. While significant research and testing (including flight testing) has been conducted on propfans, no propfan engines have entered production.|$|E
40|$|The {{advanced}} propfan {{propulsion systems}} {{design of the}} next-generation subsonic transport aircraft has been of interest to many airline companies {{in the past several}} years. This is due to the studies which indicate that an efficient ducted <b>propfan</b> <b>engine</b> technology offers a significant reduction in aircraft fuel consumption. However, because of the geometric complexity of the configuration, one challenge is the integration of the ducted <b>propfan</b> <b>engine</b> with the airframe so that aerodynamic interference effects frequently encountered near the nacelle can be minimized, or perhaps, optimized. To understand this interaction phenomenon better, it is desirable to have a reliable and efficient computational tool that can predict propeller effects on the flowfield around complex configurations...|$|E
50|$|In 1994, Antonov {{produced}} the An-70, a heavy transport aircraft. It {{is powered by}} four Progress D-27 <b>propfan</b> <b>engines</b> driving contra-rotating propellers. The characteristics of the D-27 engine and its propeller make it a propfan, a hybrid between a turbofan engine and a turboprop engine.|$|R
50|$|It {{was also}} {{unprecedented}} in its foreign content with Japan having 25% industrial workshare. Potential customers {{were concerned about}} the economics and noise of the unproven <b>propfan</b> <b>engines.</b> Boeing cancelled the 7J7 in 1987 and instead concentrated its resources on further developments of the Boeing 737 and the Boeing 757.|$|R
25|$|In June 2007, easyJet {{announced}} plans for construction of its own airliner, dubbed EcoJet. Featuring <b>propfan</b> <b>engines,</b> the EcoJet would feature an improvement in fuel efficiency. It would be constructed with extensive use of carbon fibre composite material. The date for the first flight was to be in 2015. As of October 2014, no concrete information has been released on the proposed airliner.|$|R
40|$|A {{study has}} been {{conducted}} for advanced small (450 - 850 pounds thrust) gas turbine engines for a subsonic strategic cruise missile application, using projected year- 2000 technology. Engine performance and configuration analyses were performed for two and three spool turbofan and <b>propfan</b> <b>engine</b> concepts. Mission and Life Cycle Cost (LCC) analyses were performed in which the candidate engines were compared to the baseline engine over a prescribed mission. The advanced technology engines reduced system LCC up to 41 percent relative to the baseline engine. The critical aerodynamic materials and mechanical systems necessary for turbine engine technology were identified...|$|E
40|$|A {{comparative}} study is presented {{for two of}} the advanced gas turbine engine designs developed {{in the course of a}} proprietary research effort for the NASA Advanced <b>Propfan</b> <b>Engine</b> Technology research program. In these engines, a cycle pressure ratio of 32. 5 : 1 and a 2500 F maximum turbine temperature provide fuel efficient operation in the 32, 000 -ft altitude, Mach 0. 72 cruise speed regime stipulated. Both of the engine configurations incorporate three spools, of which the compressors are dual-spool and the power turbines are free. A major design challenge for axial compressors in the 10, 000 -shp class was the maintenance of adequate blade heights in the later stages...|$|E
40|$|This manual {{explains}} {{how to use}} an Euler based computational method for predicting the airframe/propulsion integration effects for an aft-mounted turboprop transport. The propeller power effects are simulated by the actuator disk concept. This method consists of global flow field analysis and the embedded flow solution for predicting the detailed flow characteristics in the local vicinity of an aft-mounted <b>propfan</b> <b>engine.</b> The computational procedure includes the use of several computer programs performing four main functions: grid generation, Euler solution, grid embedding, and streamline tracing. This user's guide provides information for these programs, including input data preparations with sample input decks, output descriptions, and sample Unix scripts for program execution in the UNICOS environment...|$|E
50|$|The An-70 is a {{monoplane}} with a high-mounted wing {{design that}} features four distinctive <b>propfan</b> <b>engines.</b> Designed by the Progress OKB, {{each of the}} D-27 engines is rated at 13,800 shp (which can be uprated to 16,000 shp), {{which is used to}} drive the SV-27 contra-rotating scimitar propellers designed by Aerosila; eight on the front propeller and six on the aft propeller.

The aircraft's cruise speed is 750 km/h (405 kt) at an operational altitude of 8,600 to 9,600 m, with a claimed maximum speed of 850 km/h (460 kt, or Mach 0.8), which compares favourably with Mach 0.77 of the larger turbofan-powered C-17. According to Antonov, the engines provide 20-30 percent fuel economy compared to turbojet engines.|$|R
5|$|The Antonov An-70 (-70) is a four-engine medium-range {{transport}} aircraft, and {{the first}} aircraft to take flight powered only by <b>propfan</b> <b>engines.</b> It {{was developed in the}} late 1980s by the Antonov Design Bureau to replace the obsolete An-12 military transport aircraft. The maiden flight of the first prototype took place in December 1994 in Kiev, now-independent Ukraine. Within months the prototype had suffered a mid-air collision. A second airframe was produced to allow the flight-test programme to proceed. Both prototypes were produced by the Kiev Aircraft Production Plant.|$|R
25|$|The second {{generation}} of the DC-9 was originally called the DC-9-80 series or the DC-9 Super 80 but later marketed as the MD-80 and entered service in 1980. McDonnell Douglas began studies into shorter derivatives of the MD-80 in 1983, these studies eventually becoming known as the MD-90. While for several years, McDonnell Douglas proposed powering the MD-90 with two <b>propfan</b> <b>engines,</b> by 1989, {{it was clear that}} there was insufficient interest in prop fan powered aircraft, and reworked their proposals to feature the IAE V2500 turbofan instead.|$|R
40|$|An Euler flow solver was {{developed}} for predicting the airframe/propulsion integration effects for an aft-mounted turboprop transport. This solver employs a highly efficient multigrid scheme, with a successive mesh-refinement procedure to accelerate the convergence of the solution. A new dissipation model was also implemented to render solutions that are grid insensitive. The propeller power effects are simulated by the actuator disk concept. An embedded flow solution method {{was developed}} for predicting the detailed flow characteristics in the local vicinity of an aft-mounted <b>propfan</b> <b>engine</b> {{in the presence of}} a flow field induced by a complete aircraft. Results from test case analysis are presented. A user's guide for execution of computer programs, including format of various input files, sample job decks, and sample input files, is provided in an accompanying volume...|$|E
40|$|The propfan test {{assessment}} (PTA) {{propulsion system}} successfully completed over 50 hours of extensive static ground tests, including a 36 hour endurance test. All major systems performed as expected, verifying that the large-scale 2. 74 m diameter <b>propfan,</b> <b>engine,</b> gearbox, controls, subsystems, and flight instrumentation will be satisfactory with minor modifications {{for the upcoming}} PTA flight tests on the GII aircraft in early 1987. A test envelope was established for static ground operation to maintain propfan blade stresses within limits for propfan rotational speeds up to 105 percent and power levels up to 3880 kW. Transient tests verified stable, predictable response of engine power and propfan speed controls. Installed engine TSFC was better than expected, {{probably due to the}} excellent inlet performance coupled with the supercharging effect of the propfan. Near- and far-field noise spectra contained three dominant components, which were dependent on power, tip speed, and direction. The components were propfan blade tones, propfan random noise, and compressor/propfan interaction noise. No significant turbine noise or combustion noise was evident...|$|E
40|$|Until {{recently}} {{concerns about}} the impact of aircraft noise on people have centered around the takeoff and landing operations of aircraft in the vicinity of airport terminals. The development of the advanced turboprop (<b>propfan)</b> <b>engine,</b> modifications to air corridors, and the desire to maintain a natural environment in national parks and recreation areas have now focused attention on the impact at ground level of the en route noise produced by aircraft at cruise conditions and altitudes. Compared to terminal area noise, en route noise is characterized by relatively low noise levels, lack of high frequency spectral content, and long durations. Much research has been directed towards understanding and quantifying the annoyance caused by terminal area aircraft noise, but relatively little research has been conducted for en route noise. To address this need, a laboratory experiment was conducted to quantify the annoyance of people on the ground to en route noise generated by aircraft at cruise conditions. The objectives of the experiment are to determine the annoyance prediction ability of noise measurement procedures and corrections when applied to en route noise; to determine differences in annoyance response to en route noise and takeoff/landing noise; and to determine differences in annoyance response to advanced turboprop en route noise and conventional jet en route noise...|$|E
50|$|Propellers lose {{efficiency}} as {{aircraft speed}} increases, so turboprops are normally not used on high-speed aircraft above Mach 0.6-0.7. However, <b>propfan</b> <b>engines,</b> {{which are very}} similar to turboprop engines, can cruise at flight speeds approaching Mach 0.75. To increase propeller efficiency, a mechanism can be used to alter their pitch relative to the airspeed. A variable-pitch propeller, also called a controllable-pitch propeller, {{can also be used to}} generate negative thrust while decelerating on the runway. Additionally, in the event of an engine outage, the pitch can be adjusted to a vaning pitch (called feathering), thus minimizing the drag of the non-functioning propeller.|$|R
50|$|The Antonov An-70 is a four-engine medium-range {{transport}} aircraft, and {{the first}} large aircraft to be powered by <b>propfan</b> <b>engines.</b> It {{was developed in the}} late 1980s by the Antonov design bureau to replace the obsolete An-12 military transport aircraft. However, the dissolution of the Soviet Union prevented the mass production of the type. The maiden flight of the first prototype took place on 16 December 1994 in Kiev, now independent Ukraine. Within a year the prototype plane had suffered a mid-air collision. A second airframe was produced and tests continued but numerous further attempts to start production have been unsuccessful.|$|R
40|$|The {{type and}} extent of {{response}} that may be expected from the persons exposed to the noise of propfans cruising overhead is examined. The cruise mode {{is of particular interest}} because it appears that it is in this mode that the propfan airplane noise differs substantially from the noise of present jet-powered airplanes. Early test data on <b>propfan</b> <b>engines</b> suggests that noise levels on the ground under the flight track of commercial propfan transports may approach 65 decibels. To explore the reaction of the exposed population to repeated noise levels of this magnitude, it may be helpful to review some of the pertinent literature on the effects of environmental noise...|$|R
40|$|The terms {{inherently}} ducted propfan (IDP) and inherently ducted biprop (IDBP) denote {{members of}} a proposed class of <b>propfan</b> <b>engines</b> that would be quieter and would weigh less than do other <b>propfan</b> <b>engines</b> that generate equal amounts of thrust. The designs of these engines {{would be based on}} novel combinations of previously established aerodynamic-design concepts, including those of counter-rotating propfans, swept-back and swept-forward fixed wings, and ducted propfans. Heretofore, noise-reducing propfan designs have provided for installation of shrouds around the blades. A single propeller surrounded by such a shroud is denoted an advanced ducted propeller (ADP); a pair of counter-rotating propellers surrounded by such a shroud is denoted a counter-rotating integrated shrouded propeller (CRISP). In addition to adding weight, the shrouds engender additional undesired rotor/stator interactions and cascade effects, and contribute to susceptibility to choking. An IDP or IDBP would offer some shielding against outward propagation of noise, similar to shielding by a shroud, but without the weight and other undesired effects associated with shrouds. An IDP would include a pair of counter-rotating propellers. The blades of the upstream propeller would be swept back, while those of the downstream propeller would be swept forward (see figure). The downstream blades would have a geometric twist such that their forward-swept tips could act as winglets extending over the tips of the upstream blades. In principle, the resulting periodic coverage of the upstream-blade tips by the downstreamblade tips would suppress outward propagation of noise, as though a short noise-shielding duct were present. Furthermore, it is anticipated that an IDP would be less susceptible to some of the operational limitations of a CRISP during asymmetric flow conditions or reverse thrust operation...|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the growing}} {{transport}} needs in emerging economies and recent success of the low-cost airlines, the demand for short/medium-haul aeroplanes is increasing. Within the next twenty years, the existing single-aisle aircraft {{are likely to be}} replaced by new models mounting new propulsion systems. One promising con- figuration being considered is the open-rotor, which is a revision of the propfan. However, further progress has to be done in order to transform <b>propfan</b> <b>engines,</b> whose technology dates back to the 1980 s, into viable and feasible open-rotor con- cepts. Among the aspects yet to be investigated in su ficient depth is the de finition of a methodology for the open-rotor nacelle design. The aim of the present research is to help enhance the knowledge in this area. Even if {{there are a number of}} important fields of investigation for open-rotor designs, this work is limited to the analysis of the pusher architecture with no exhaust impingement through rotors. The research is initially performed combining both a graphical and a compu- tational approach, investigating the mathematical and physical aspects involved in the de finition of appropriate nacelle pro files, boundary conditions for the CFD analysis and simplifi ed rotor modelling. The first simulations are mainly focused on a typical propfan nacelle, which is taken as a reference model: the computations provide useful results for evaluating its aerodynamic features [...] .

40|$|The {{problem of}} {{reducing}} engine-airframe installation drag for a transport aircraft with an aft-mounted <b>propfan</b> or turboprop <b>engine</b> is investigated. A three-dimensional Euler code {{is used for}} the analysis. Installation drag effects are inferred from a qualitative analysis of the computed velocity and pressure distributions. The basic design philosophy is to alleviate flow acceleration near the strut/nacelle junction by aerodynamic means. This involves minor reshaping and relocation of the propulsion system...|$|R
25|$|The {{aircraft}} {{arrived at}} Omsk at 0:30 and was refueled with 38 tons of jet fuel. 5 hours after landing, the four <b>engine</b> <b>propfan</b> lifted off the runway {{on its way}} to Yakutsk for cold weather testing. Within seconds of becoming airborne one of the Progress D-27 engines with Contra-rotating propellers reached an over-speed condition and automatically shut down. The forward propeller stopped rotating but {{due to the nature of}} the failure the aft propeller kept turning, producing negative thrust. At this point the flight crew increased power to the remaining three engines but a problem with the RPM sensors on one of them led to automatic engine shut-off. Thus, the An-70 ended up flying at low speed with only two properly functioning engines, with the third engine generating over 11,000 pounds of negative thrust and disrupting airflow across the wing.|$|R
40|$|Today, the air {{transport}} industry has become {{an essential element of}} global society by its great contributions to the wide exchanges of cultures/people and to the rapid growth in the world economy. However, on the other hand, the adverse impacts on the environment caused by {{air transport}}, such as air pollution, noise and climate change, are drawing, increasingly, growing public concern. In order to address the steady growth in air-travel demand in the next decades through an environmentally-friendly way and realise the ACARE 2020 environmental goals, The Clean Sky programme has been launched by European Union over the period 2008 – 2013. The project research, described in this thesis and sponsored by the Clean Sky programme, aims at evaluating the feasibility of reducing the environmental impact of commercial aviation through the introduction of changes in the aircraft operational rules and procedures, as well as the application of the new-generation <b>propfan</b> (open rotor) <b>engine,</b> based on flight trajectory multidisciplinary optimisation and analysis of commercial aircraft. In order to accomplish the above research objectives, a complete methodology to achieve and realise optimum flight trajectories has been initially proposed. Then, 12 component-level models which function as simulating different disciplines, such as aircraft performance, engine performance, engine gaseous emission, and flight noise, have been developed or selected/adopted. Further, nine system-level integration and optimisation models were built. These system-level models simulate flights from Amsterdam Schiphol airport in the Netherlands to Munich airport in Germany flown by different types of aircraft through different flight phases with different optimisation objectives. Finally, detailed investigations into the flight trajectory optimisations were performed, extensive optimisation results were achieved and corresponding description, analysis and comparisons were provided. The main contributions of this work to knowledge broadly comprise the following: 1) the further development regarding the methodology of flight trajectory multidisciplinary optimisation; 2) previous work on aircraft trajectory optimisation has often considered fixed objectives over the complete flight trajectory. This research focused on representative flight phases of a flight mission with different optimisation objectives, namely, noise impact and fuel burn during the departure phase; fuel burn and flight time during en route phase; and noise impact and NOx emission during the arrival phase; 3) this research has extended the current flight trajectory optimisations to turboprop and propfan equipped aircraft. As a result, a relative complete 2 D flight trajectory multidisciplinary optimisation spectrum, spanned by primary commercial aircraft types, primary flight phases and primary optimisation objectives of interest, has been built. Although encouraging progress have been achieved, this project research, as with any other research activity, is also only ‘on the way’ rather than coming to the ‘end’ point. There are still many aspects which can be improved further and there is still much new research and exploration which can be investigated further. All these have also been suggested in this thesis...|$|R
