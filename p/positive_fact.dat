This paper argues that there is an elegant solution to these problems available to anyone who thinks that there are <b>positive</b> <b>facts.</b> Bradley’s regress and considerations of ontological parsimony show that an object’s having a property is an affair internal to the object and the property, just as numerical identity and distinctness are internal to the entities that are numerically identical or distinct. For the same reasons, an object’s lacking a property must be an affair internal to the object and the property. Negative facts will thus be part of any ontology of <b>positive</b> <b>facts.</b> 1...|$|R

An elementary formal system, EFS for short, {{is a kind of}} logic program on Σ+ consisting of finitely many axioms.

Length-bounded EFSs with at most n axioms are considered, and it is shown that inductive inference from positive data works successfully for their models as well as for their languages. From this it follows that any class of logic programs, such as Prolog programs, corresponding to length-bounded EFSs can be inferred from <b>positive</b> <b>facts...</b>|$|R

40|$|We {{introduce}} an adversarial learning framework, {{which we}} named KBGAN, {{to improve the}} performances {{of a wide range}} of existing knowledge graph embedding models. Because knowledge graph datasets typically only contain <b>positive</b> <b>facts,</b> sampling useful negative training examples is a non-trivial task. Replacing the head or tail entity of a fact with a uniformly randomly selected entity is a conventional method for generating negative facts used by many previous works, but the majority of negative facts generated in this way can be easily discriminated from <b>positive</b> <b>facts,</b> and will contribute little towards the training. Inspired by generative adversarial networks (GANs), we use one knowledge graph embedding model as a negative sample generator to assist the training of our desired model, which acts as the discriminator in GANs. The objective of the generator is to generate difficult negative samples that can maximize their likeliness determined by the discriminator, while the discriminator minimizes its training loss. This framework is independent of the concrete form of generator and discriminator, and therefore can utilize a wide variety of knowledge graph embedding models as its building blocks. In experiments, we adversarially train two translation-based models, TransE and TransD, each with assistance from one of the two probability-based models, DistMult and ComplEx. We evaluate the performances of KBGAN on the link prediction task, using three knowledge base completion datasets: FB 15 k- 237, WN 18 and WN 18 RR. Experimental results show that adversarial training substantially improves the performances of target embedding models under various settings...|$|R
60|$|Thus we {{see that}} each and every {{condition}} of the phenomenon may be taken in its turn, and, with equal propriety in common parlance, but with equal impropriety in scientific discourse, may be spoken of {{as if it were}} the entire cause. And in practice, that particular condition is usually styled the cause, whose share in the matter is superficially the most conspicuous, or whose requisiteness to the production of the effect we happen to be insisting on at the moment. So great is the force of this last consideration, that it sometimes induces us to give the name of cause even to one of the negative conditions. We say, for example, The army was surprised because the sentinel was off his post. But since the sentinel’s absence was not what created the enemy, or put the soldiers asleep, how did it cause them to be surprised? All that is really meant is, that the event would not have happened if he had been at his duty. His being off his post was no producing cause, but the mere absence of a preventing cause: it was simply equivalent to his non-existence. From nothing, from a mere negation, no consequences can proceed. All effects are connected, by the law of causation, with some set of positive conditions; negative ones, it is true, being almost always required in addition. In other words, every fact or phenomenon which has a beginning, invariably arises when some certain combination of <b>positive</b> <b>facts</b> exists, provided certain other <b>positive</b> <b>facts</b> do not exist.|$|R
