5|$|Neural <b>precursor</b> <b>cell</b> {{expressed}} developmentally down-regulated protein 9 (NEDD-9) is {{a protein}} that in humans is encoded by the NEDD9 gene.

An important paralog of this gene is BCAR1.|$|E
5|$|The {{nature of}} the {{molecular}} cues involved in the correct targeting of the migrating precursors remains a question. The secretion of a chemoattractant factor by the OB appears as a possibility. Chemoattractants and repellants act on the migrating neurons by inducing changes in the growth cone to direct them. Nevertheless, tissue derived from this structure had no directive influence on the migration. On the other hand, a septum-derived secreted factor showed a repulsive effect on the SVZ cells. More recently, {{it has been shown}} that the secreted molecule SLIT shows such a repelling effect on SVZ-derived precursors. Furthermore, integrins have been demonstrated to have a regulatory influence on <b>precursor</b> <b>cell</b> chain-migration and regulation of their divisions.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Kumar, et al., first {{described}} a sequence tag {{corresponding to the}} NEDD9 3′ untranslated region based on the cloning {{of a group of}} genes predominantly expressed in the brain of embryonic, but not adult mice, a group of genes designated neural <b>precursor</b> <b>cell</b> expressed, developmentally down-regulated. In 1996, two groups independently described the complete sequence of the NEDD9 gene, and provided initial functional analysis of NEDD9 protein. Law et al. overexpressed a human cDNA library in S. cerevisiae, and screened for genes that simultaneously affected cell cycle and cell polarity controls, inducing a filamentous yeast budding phenotype, and thus identified the HEF1 protein (Human Enhancer of Filamentation 1). This study identified HEF1/NEDD9 as an interactive partner for focal adhesion kinase (FAK), connecting it to integrin signaling. Separately, Minegishi et al. cloned the gene encoding a protein hyperphosphorylated following ligation of β1-integrins in T cells and hypothesized {{to play a role in}} the process of T cell costimulation, designating this gene Cas-L (Crk-associated substrate-related protein, Lymphocyte type).|$|E
50|$|<b>Precursor</b> <b>cells</b> may {{be damaged}} by radiation. This damage {{of the cells}} may prevent the <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> from {{differentiating}} into neurons and result in decreased neurogenesis. To determine whether the <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> are impaired {{in their ability to}} differentiate, two cultures were prepared by Fike et al. One of these cultures contained <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> from an irradiated rat’s hippocampus and the second culture contained non-irradiated <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> from a rat hippocampus. The <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> were then observed while they continued to develop. The results indicated that the irradiated culture contained a higher number of differentiated neuron and glial cells in comparison to the control. It was also found that the ratios of glial cells to neurons in both cultures were similar. These results suggest that the radiation did not impair the <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> ability to differentiate into neurons and therefore neurogenesis is still possible.|$|R
40|$|Multiple myeloma (MM) {{invariably}} {{develops in}} the bone marrow (BM), indicating the strong requirement of this tumor for the peculiar BM microenvironment, rich in cytokine and hematopoietic <b>precursor</b> <b>cells.</b> Interleukin- 6 (IL- 6) and a proliferation inducing ligand (APRIL) are key cytokines implicated in MM development. Here, we show that MM cells changed the hematopoietic microenvironment early upon BM infiltration by strongly downregulating hematopoietic <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> from all lineages except myeloid <b>precursor</b> <b>cells.</b> Myeloid <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> constituted {{a major source of}} APRIL in MM-infiltrated BM, and their proliferative response to IL- 6 upregulation explained their relative resistance to MM infiltration. The osteolytic molecule receptor activator of NF-kB ligand (RANK-L) expressed by MM cells started this myeloid proliferation by inducing in a contact-dependent manner IL- 6 production by myeloid <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> themselves. Taken together, our data demonstrate that MM cells do not simply displace hematopoietic cells upon BM infiltration, but rather selectively modulate the BM microenvironment to preserve a pool of high APRIL-producing myeloid <b>precursor</b> <b>cells.</b> Our data also identify a positive regulation of APRIL by IL- 6 in myeloid <b>precursor</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R

25|$|The notch {{signaling}} {{mechanism is}} an example of juxtacrine signaling (also known as contact-dependent signaling) in which two adjacent cells must make physical contact in order to communicate. This requirement for direct contact allows for very precise control of cell differentiation during embryonic development. In the worm Caenorhabditis elegans, two cells of the developing gonad each have an equal chance of terminally differentiating or becoming a uterine <b>precursor</b> <b>cell</b> that continues to divide. The choice of which cell continues to divide is controlled by competition of cell surface signals. One cell will happen to produce more of a cell surface protein that activates the Notch receptor on the adjacent cell. This activates a feedback loop or system that reduces Notch expression in the cell that will differentiate and that increases Notch {{on the surface of the}} cell that continues as a stem cell.|$|E

These preparations of precursors, contaminated by less than 7 % hemoglobinized erythroblasts, synthesize globin at a rate less than 6 % that of the unfractionated liver erythroid cell population. RNA was isolated from these <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> and assayed for globin mRNA activity in a cell-free system from Krebs ascites tumor. The 6 - 16 S RNA fraction from <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> has less than 5 % of the globin mRNA activity of RNA isolated from unfractionated populations. <b>Precursor</b> <b>cells</b> incubated with erythropoietin show an increment {{in the rate of}} synthesis of globin only after 5 - 10 hr of incubation. After 10 hr of culture with this hormone, <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> show a 6 - to 10 -fold increase in globin mRNA activity.

40|$|Adult hippocampal {{neurogenesis}} {{is regulated}} by activity. But how do neural <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> in the hippocampus respond to surrounding network activity and translate increased neural activity into a developmental program? Here {{we show that}} long-term potential (LTP) -like synaptic activity within a cellular network of mature hippocampal neurons promotes neuronal differentiation of newly generated cells. In co-cultures of <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> with primary hippocampal neurons, LTP-like synaptic plasticity induced by addition of glycine in Mg 2 +-free media for 5 min, produced synchronous network activity and subsequently increased synaptic strength between neurons. Furthermore, this synchronous network activity led to {{a significant increase in}} neuronal differentiation from the co-cultured neural <b>precursor</b> <b>cells.</b> When applied directly to <b>precursor</b> <b>cells,</b> glycine and Mg 2 +-free solution did not induce neuronal differentiation. Synaptic plasticity-induced neuronal differentiation of <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> was observed in the presence of GABAergic neurotransmission blockers but was dependent on NMDA-mediated Ca 2 + influx. Most importantly, neuronal differentiation required the release of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) from the underlying substrate hippocampal neurons as well as TrkB receptor phosphorylation in <b>precursor</b> <b>cells.</b> This suggests that activity-dependent stem cell differentiation within the hippocampal network is mediated via synaptically evoked BDNF signaling...|$|R

40|$|AbstractA major {{question}} in neural development is whether {{each part of}} the telencephalon has an equal potential to generate each cell type. In this study, we address this question specifically in regard to the generation of oligodendrocytes. We cultured <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> from two different regions of the rat embryonic telencephalon—the ganglionic eminence and the anlage of the cerebral cortex—from different stages of development, and labeled the cells with a retroviral vector to follow their fate. We discovered that multipotential <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> from E 13 ganglionic eminence have several orders of magnitude higher capacity to generate oligodendrocyte than the equivalent cells from E 13 cerebral cortex. This failure of cortical <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> to generate oligodendrocytes at early developmental stages (E 12 –E 13) could not be reversed by growth factors, permissive growth media, or a permissive striatal cell environment. A combination of striatal contact and plus specific growth factors, however, did induce the production of oligodendrocytes. We conclude that telencephalic <b>precursor</b> <b>cells</b> do have the potential to generate oligodendrocytes, but that this potential is significantly greater in striatal than cortical multipotential <b>precursor</b> <b>cells...</b>|$|R
