5000|$|Most {{pipettes}} are calibrated [...] "to deliver" [...] (TD) and not [...] "to contain" [...] (TC). If {{they are}} TD pipettes {{they should not}} be rinsed after they have delivered their contents. If the pipette were calibrated TC it should be rinsed to obtain the correct amount of material. If the fluid to be measured is quite viscous or sticky (such as glycerol solutions) the pipette must be calibrated and in this case the outside of the tip must be carefully wiped with a lint-free tissue to remove the adhering liquid - while being careful to not touch the opening of the pipette tip, which may require some practice.

5000|$|Operator fatigue is an often-overlooked but crucial {{component}} when seeking maximal {{accuracy and}} repeatability. Repetitive motions cause stress in human joints and muscles. Even a well-trained and experienced operator {{will see a}} decrease in accuracy and repeatability as length {{of time on the}} job increases. It {{is for this reason that}} pipette calibration service providers that are dedicated to excellence limit the number of pipettes that can be calibrated by an individual technician to a maximum daily number. Each pipette, and each customer, deserves a high level of care in the treatment of the instrument. Additionally, some dedicated professionals train themselves to pipette ambidextrously, allowing them to reduce arm and finger strain by alternating hands. Another solution is choosing an electronic <b>pipettor</b> that significantly reduces hand fatigue. Once the operating button is touched the <b>pipettor</b> operates always the same way producing user independent accuracy and precision.|$|E
50|$|HCS {{instruments}} on {{the market}} today can be separated based on an array of specifications that significantly influence the instruments versatility and overall cost. These include speed, a live cell chamber that includes temperature and CO2 control (some also have humidity control for longer term live cell imaging), a built in <b>pipettor</b> or injector for fast kinetic assays, and additional imaging modes such as confocal, bright field, phase contrast and FRET. One of the most incisive difference is whether the instruments are optical confocal or not. Confocal microscopy summarizes as imaging/resolving a thin slice through an object and rejecting out of focus light that comes from outside this slice. Confocal imaging enables higher image signal to noise and higher resolution than the more commonly applied epi-fluorescence microscopy. Depending on the instrument confocality is achieved via laser scanning, a single spinning disk with pinholes or slits, a dual spinning disk, or a virtual slit. There are trade offs of sensitivity, resolution, speed, photo-toxicity, photo-bleaching, instrument complexity, and price between these various confocal techniques.|$|E

5000|$|Long-term pipette {{operation}} {{can lead}} to repetitive strain injuries (RSI), such as carpal tunnel syndrome. These disorders may cause significant reductions in accuracy and repeatability by altering the proper pipetting techniques that are crucial to achieving optimal accuracy. Preventive measures include learning to pipette {{with both hands and}} alternating their usage, taking frequent breaks while pipetting, and choosing the most ergonomic pipette available. Instruments with plumper handles are generally superior in this regard. On the other hand, electronic <b>pipettors</b> which operate with a light touch reduce RSI significantly.|$|R
5000|$|The {{earliest}} thermal cyclers {{were designed}} for use with the Klenow fragment of DNA polymerase I. Since this enzyme is destroyed during each heating step of the amplification process, new enzyme had to be added every cycle. This led to a cumbersome machine based on an automated <b>pipettor,</b> with open reaction tubes. Later, the PCR process was adapted {{to the use of}} thermostable DNA polymerase from Thermus aquaticus, which greatly simplified the design of the thermal cycler. While in some old machines the block is submerged in an oil bath to control temperature, in modern PCR machines a Peltier element is commonly used. Quality thermal cyclers often contain silver blocks to achieve fast temperature changes and uniform temperature throughout the block. Other cyclers have multiple blocks with high heat capacity, each of which is kept at a constant temperature, and the reaction tubes are moved between them by means of an automated process. Miniaturized thermal cyclers have been created in which the reaction mixture moves via channel through hot and cold zones on a microfluidic chip. Thermal cyclers designed for quantitative PCR have optical systems which enable fluorescence to be monitored during reaction cycling.|$|E

However, to reach their full promise, these technologies need to be adaptable to high-throughput automation.

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to compare the responses of the Salmonella/microsome microsuspension assay with the new microplate fluctuation protocol (MPF) for the evaluation of the mutagenic activity of environmental samples. Organic extracts of total particulate atmospheric air samples, surface waters, and effluents were tested in dose-response experiments. The assays were performed with strain TA 98 in the absence and presence of S 9 mix. Both protocols produced similar results, despite the fact that the maximum score of the MPF is limited to 48 wells, whereas in the regular plate assay it is possible to count up to 1, 500 colonies using an automatic counter. Similar sensitivities based on the lowest dose that resulted in a positive response were obtained for both assays. The MPF procedure is less laborious (e. g., all-liquid format, use of multi-channel <b>pipettors)</b> and allows for automation of the pipetting and dispensing steps, thus, reducing time of the analysis which is particularly important in environmental quality monitoring programs or in effect-directed analysis. The results show that the MPF procedure is a promising tool to test environmental samples for mutagenic activity. Environ. Mol. Mutagen. 51 : 31 - 38, 2010. (C) 2009 Wiley-Liss, Inc.

Isotope ratios of materials routinely range over 4 – 8 orders of magnitude in a single experiment, dosing solutions contain thousands of DPM and gels used to separate proteins possess 14 C ratios of 1 amol 14 C/mg C. Radiocarbon contamination is a legacy of earlier tracer work in most biological laboratories, {{even if they were}} never hot labs. Removable surface contamination can be found and monitored using swipes. Contamination can be found on any surface routinely touched: door knobs, light switches, drawer handles, water faucets.

Shared air supplies can also present problems by distributing hot aerosols throughout a building. Aerosols can be monitored for 14 C content using graphitized coal or fullerene soot mixed with metal powder as an absorber. The monitors can be set out in work spaces for 1 – 2 weeks and measured by AMS with regular samples. Frequent air changes help minimize aerosol contamination in many cases.

40|$|Library {{preparation}} for next-generation DNA sequencing (NGS) remains a key bottleneck in the sequencing process {{which can be}} relieved through improved automation and miniaturization. We describe a microfluidic device for automating laboratory protocols that require one or more column chromatography steps and demonstrate its utility for preparing Next Generation sequencing libraries for the Illumina and Ion Torrent platforms. Sixteen different libraries can be generated simultaneously with significantly reduced reagent cost and hands-on time compared to manual library preparation. Using an appropriate column matrix and buffers, size selection can be performed on-chip following end-repair, dA tailing, and linker ligation, so that the libraries eluted from the chip are ready for sequencing. The core architecture of the device ensures uniform, reproducible column packing without user supervision and accommodates multiple routine protocol steps in any sequence, such as reagent mixing and incubation; column packing, loading, washing, elution, and regeneration; capture of eluted material {{for use as a}} substrate in a later step of the protocol; and removal of one column matrix so that two or more column matrices with different functional properties can be used in the same protocol.

40|$|A {{rapid and}} simple most-probable-number (MPN) {{procedure}} for the enumeration of dissimilatory arsenic-reducing bacteria (DARB) is presented. The method {{is based on}} the specific detection of arsenite, the end product of anaerobic arsenate respiration, by a precipitation reaction with sulfide. After 4 weeks of incubation, the medium for the MPN method is acidified to pH 6 and sulfide is added to a final concentration of about 1 mM. The brightly yellow arsenic trisulfide precipitates immediately and can easily be scored at arsenite concentrations as low as 0. 05 mM. Abiotic reduction of arsenate upon sulfide addition, which could yield false positives, apparently produces a soluble As-S intermediate, which does not precipitate until about 1 h after sulfide addition. Using the new MPN method, population estimates of pure cultures of DARB were similar to direct cell counts. MPNs of environmental water and sediment samples yielded DARB numbers between 101 and 105 cells per ml or gram (dry weight), respectively. Poisoned and sterilized controls showed that potential abiotic reductants in environmental samples did not interfere with the MPN estimates. A major advantage is that the assay can be easily scaled to a microtiter plate format, enabling analysis of large numbers of samples by use of multichannel <b>pipettors.</b> Overall, the MPN method provides a rapid and simple means for estimating population sizes of DARB, a diverse group of organisms for which no comprehensive molecular markers have been developed yet...|$|R

40|$|With the {{advancement}} of high-throughput biomolecular screening techniques to the lead optimization stage, there is a critical need to quality control (QC) dose-response curves generated by robotic liquid handlers to ensure accurate affinity determina-tions. One challenge in evaluating the performance of liquid handlers is identifying and validating a robust method for testing dispense volumes across different instruments. Although traditional automated liquid handlers are still considered the standard platform in many laboratories, nanoliter dispensers are becoming more common and pose new challenges for routine quality control procedures. For example, standard gravimetric measurements are unreliable for testing the accuracy of nanoliter liquid dispenses. However, nanoliter dispensing technology allows {{for the conservation of}} compound, reduces compound carryover from well to well through discrete dispenses, and eliminates the need for intermediate compound dilution steps to achieve a low final DMSO assay concentration. Moreover, an intermediate dilution step in aqueous solution might result in compound pre-cipitation at high concentrations.

The data confirmed the importance of establishing robust QC procedures for dose-response generation in addition to accuracy and precision determinations for each instrument, and they validated the use of nanoliter <b>pipettors</b> for dose-response testing. The results of this study also support the requirement for thorough mixing during serial compound dilutions prepared for high-throughput lead optimization strategies using traditional liquid handlers.

40|$|Radioimmunoassay (RIA) {{employing}} iodinated ligands {{represents a}} popular measurement method for small molecules {{due to its}} excellent sensitivity and specificity. Yet performing RIAs {{of large numbers of}} tubes remains a tedious laboratory chore due to the need to individually handle tubes multiple times. We here present a method in which conventional 125 I-labeled RIA ([125 I] RIA) is adapted to a microtiter plate format, termed mini-RIA. Tubes are handled in batch for centrifugation or during the separation of antibody-bound ligand from free ligand. A simple draining device for batch decantation of free ligand from 96 minitubes is used. Optimal conditions for the mini-RIA were established using two workup methods—double-antibody immunoprecipitation and direct polyethylene glycol precipitation. Use of the mini-RIA method was found to result in a considerable savings in assay times; in addition, the sensitivity of the mini-RIA was improved over conventional RIA. The mini-RIA is particularly useful for assay of large numbers of samples derived from chromatographic methods, since aliquots can be transferred directly from the fraction collector into the minitubes using multiple channel <b>pipettors.</b> Because the method is flexible with regard to assay workup, we predict that most conventional [125 I] RIAs can be adapted to the mini-RIA format. 2002 Elsevier Science (USA).

40|$|Authors: Janet Hill, Bonnie Chaban, Jennifer Town, Matthew Links & Tim Dumonceaux ### Abstract This {{protocol}} {{describes an}} alternative approach to performing Roche’s Paired End Rapid Library Preparation Method for 8 kb span libraries. This method uses the Corvaris g-tube for DNA fragmentation, {{eliminating the need for}} a HydroShear apparatus, and a Sage Science BluePippin electrophoresis platform to size select the 8 kb fragments, eliminating the need for agarose gel electrophoresis and sample recovery using a Whatman Elutrap device. These two modifications allow the protocol to be completed in significantly less time (eliminate an overnight step) and require significantly less capital investment in laboratory equipment. This modified library preparation protocol has yielded paired end libraries meeting all the quality control benchmarks the original protocol stipulates and has been combined with sequencing on a GS Junior instrument to generate excellent sequencing results. The equipment substitutions presented allow paired end library preparation to be practical for smaller research groups. ### Introduction In large-scale sequencing centers it is commonplace to have a range of DNA sequencing platforms (e. g. 454, Illumina, SOLiD, and PacBio) and also specialized devices for shearing of DNA molecules common in the preparation of paired-end libraries. With the introduction of laboratory-scale devices like the GS Jr and MiSeq there is a shift occurring where DNA sequencing technology is becoming directly accessible within small labs. The ability to perform whole genome sequencing and assembly within a lab is now reasonable to consider for Bacteria using the GS Jr. A crucial type of data for scaffolding of genome assemblies is paired-end data. By generating information from sequencing reads linked across some known or estimated spanning distance, bioinformatic techniques are capable of ordering and orienting contigs produced from shotgun sequencing. In terms of the GS Jr platform the system is inherently capable of sequencing paired-end libraries but there is a challenge for laboratory-scale use as the conventional protocol for library production includes shearing of DNA molecules using a Hydroshear. As a specialized device the Hydroshear represents a significant investment for a laboratory-scale setting and may present a barrier to the use of paired-end sequencing in lab settings. This protocol describes {{an alternative approach}} to performing Roche’s Paired End Rapid Library Preparation Method for 8 kb span libraries. This method uses the Corvaris g-tube for DNA fragmentation, eliminating the need for a HydroShear apparatus, and a Sage Science BluePippin electrophoresis platform to size select the 8 kb fragments, eliminating the need for agarose gel electrophoresis and sample recovery using a Whatman Elutrap device. These two modifications allow the protocol to be completed in significantly less time (by eliminating an overnight step) and simplify sheared fragment purification. This modified library preparation protocol yielded paired-end libraries meeting all the quality control benchmarks of the original protocol and has been combined with shotgun sequencing on a GS Junior to generate excellent assemblies for a range of Bacteria. The equipment substitutions and associated savings in time provide a practical protocol for laboratory-scale paired-end sequencing on the GS Jr. ### Materials Reagents unique to modified protocol: 1.

See attached Supplementary Manual. Modifications by Hill lab (Saskatoon) group: Start with 15 µg of sample genomic DNA in 150 µL Tris-HCl pH 8. 0 (genomic DNA preparation of 100 ng/µL) – same as original protocol Section 3. 1 – DNA Fragmentation (HydroShear) – completely disregard this section. Instead, use Covaris g-tubes. - Save a few µL of original genomic DNA to visualize on an agarose gel later. - Add the 150 µL genomic DNA prep to a g-tube. Follow instructions with tubes – Spin in an Eppendorf MiniSpin plus microcentrifuge at 8, 600 rpm for 1 min, flip tube over, repeat spin, remove sample from tube. - Keep 2 µL of the sheared sample to run on an agarose gel later. Section 3. 2 – Fragment End Repair - For 25 °C steps throughout protocol, set waterbath to maintain this temperature. Room temperature does not always work. - Disregard step 3 (don’t need this agarose gel). - Step 4 m – use the arm on the Labquake to keep the tube from flipping completely over when doing this gentle mixing (just rock the tube back and forth). Section 3. 3 – Circularization Adaptor Ligation - Step 1 – change the 2 x rapid ligase buffer for 10 x rapid ligase buffer (New England Biolabs product) and only add 10 µL (reduces mixture to 100 µL from 190 µL). - Stop at the end of Step 4 and disregard Steps 5 - 11. Instead, take the entire sample and load onto a BluePippin cassette. Save a few µL of the sample pre-loading to run on an agarose gel later. - To load the sample, bring the sample volume to 120 µL with Tris-HCl pH 8. 0 and add 40 µL BluePippin loading dye. Follow cassette instructions to prepare Blue Pippin cassette and load 4 lanes of a cassette by adding 40 µL of sample into each lane. Load the 5 th lane with BluePippin marker. - Run the BluePippin with the range selection from 5, 000 - 11, 000 bp. - When finished, remove the size-selected DNA from the elution well into a microfuge tube and rise the elution chamber with 40 µL 0. 1 % Tween 20 solution (supplied with BluePippin), adding this to the tube with the sample. - Concentrate and wash the size-selected sample by loading all the BluePippin eluted DNA into an Amicon filter column (0. 5 mL, 10 K) and spinning for 10 min at 14, 000 x g. Discard flow-thru and add 250 µL Tris-HCl to the column. Spin for 15 min at 14, 000 x g. Invert column in a clean collection tube and spin for 2 min at 1, 000 x g. - Save a few µL of concentrated sample to run on an agarose gel later. - Run an agarose gel of the original genomic DNA (unsheared), g-tube sheared DNA, sample before BluePipping and sample after BluePippin. - Continue to next section Section 3. 5 – Fill-In Reaction - At Step 3, quantify with Life Technologies’s Qubit BR dsDNA quantification kit. You need to achieve at least 6 ng/µL to continue. Section 3. 6 – Circularization - No changes to protocol Section 3. 7 – Nebulizer Assembly (3. 7. 1) and DNA Nebulization and Collection/Purification of the Fragmented DNA (3. 7. 2) - No changes to protocol Section 3. 8 – Fragment End Repair - No changes to protocol Section 3. 9 – Immobilization Bead Preparation - For Step 1 – prepare 2 x Library Binding Buffer by mixing 5 mL Molecular Biology Grade Water, 4 mL of 5 M NaCl and 1 mL of 10 x TE. Section 3. 10 – Adaptor Ligation - For Step 4 – incubate at 25 °C for 1 hour in a thermocycler. Section 3. 11 – Library Immobilization - No changes to protocol Section 3. 12 – Library Amplification - Prepare the PCR mixture as indicated for the sample and a second mixture to run without sample as a negative control. Save a few µL of the sample PCR after amplification and the negative PCR sample to run on the BioAnalyzer chip at the end. Section 3. 13 – Sizing Mix Preparation - No changes to protocol Section 3. 14 – Final Library Size Selection - No changes to protocol Section 3. 15 – Library Quality Assessment - Step 1 – use BioAnalyzer chip and run the PCR sample and negative control from Section 3. 12, as well as the final sample. Also, quantify final sample using Life Technologies’s Qubit ssDNA quantification kit. ### Timing Sections 3. 1 to 3. 5 can be performed in a day (including the BluePippin run). A good spot to pause overnight is either right after the BluePippin run (end of Section 3. 4) or after the fill-in reaction and quantification (end of Section 3. 5). Sections 3. 5 or 3. 6 to the end of Section 3. 11 is a good second day of work. Finishing Section 3. 12 to 3. 15 on the third morning allows for plenty of time to continue on with sequencing emPCR later in that day. ### Troublshooting Things that we have noted: 1. The AMPure size selection at the end (Section 3. 13 and 3. 14) can be variable, depending on the AMPure lot and day you do it. - We have considered running the BluePippin cassette selecting for the tighter ~ 500 bp range (instead of the larger range in the protocol) to standardize the paired end fragment size and make this selection more precise. However, if the genomic DNA shearing wasn’t precisely around the 8 kb mark, keeping the larger size window gives more DNA to work with and appears to work just fine. ### Anticipated Results Figure 1 shows typical results of shearing with the Covaris g-tubes and the purification of appropriately sized fragments using the Blue Pippin.

Baylin Corresponding authors ([sbaylin 1 @jhmi. edu](sbaylin 1 @jhmi. edu); [vijay. tiwari@fmi. ch](vijay. tiwari@fmi. ch)) ### INTRODUCTION Progress in {{technologies}} to address long-range chromosomal interactions in vivo has extensively revised concepts about {{different aspects of}} transcriptional regulation. These methods allow probing physical proximities between chromatin elements without specifically identifying the protein components that mediate such interactions. Here we describe a detailed protocol for Combined 3 C-ChIP-Cloning (6 C) technology, which combines multiple techniques to identify the proteins that bridge distant genomic regions, while simultaneously identifying such physical proximities. This method is also useful for determining if a candidate protein might mediate long-range interactions, both in cis and in trans in the nucleus. We discuss how the 6 C technique can be incorporated with other techniques to discover all the chromatin regions in the nucleus that interact with a given gene or chromatin region of interest in a specific protein-dependent manner. Such information allows complete, cell-type-specific mapping of all the chromatin interactions mediated by specific proteins. The 6 C assay advances {{our understanding of the}} three-dimensional aspects of the higher-order folding of chromatin and provides an important tool to examine the role of specific proteins in nuclear organization. In addition to providing a detailed protocol of the 6 C technique, we discuss how this technology can be used by investigators working in the area of chromatin biology, with special interest in chromatin long-range interactions. ### RELATED INFORMATION The 6 C assay combines three different methodologies: chromosome conformation capture (3 C) (Dekker et al. 2002), chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP), and cloning (Fig. 1). The first step involves conventional 3 C methodology: The chromatin is cross-linked, digested with restriction enzymes, and ligated under conditions that favor intramolecular ligation. Immediately after ligation, the chromatin is immunoprecipitated using an antibody against the protein of interest (i. e., the suspected “bridging protein” or the protein whose mediating physical proximities the investigator wishes to map). Thereafter, the cross-links are reversed, and the DNA is purified further. The fragments obtained are then cloned into a vector harboring the same restriction enzyme site overhangs that were generated in the enzyme digestion step of the 3 C portion of the protocol. The clones are further screened by digestion with the same restriction enzyme. Ideally, clones showing multiple inserts will result from the intramolecular ligation and should represent physical proximities involving the protein targeted in the immunoprecipitation steps. These clones are chosen for sequencing to reveal the identity of the partners. ![Figure 1]([URL] "Figure 1 ") **Figure 1. ** Summary of the Combined 3 C-ChIP-Cloning (6 C) method. For a review of other recent methods developed to examine long-range chromosomal interactions in vivo, see Simonis et al. (2007).

It also determines the resolution of interaction maps that can be obtained using the 6 C assay in terms of defining the exact chromatin elements that are involved in physical pairing. Enzymes that produce cohesive ends from palindromic recognition sites are preferred in 3 C assays, and the six-cutters such as EcoRI, HindIII, and BglII are commonly used. These should cut every 4 kb along the genomic DNA and offer a good starting point. To obtain higher-resolution maps, frequent cutters such as MseI (predicted to cut every 256 bp) can be used.

40|$|Regulation {{of tissue}} {{development}} and repair depends on communication between neighbouring cells. Recent advances in cell micro-contact printing and microfluidics have facilitated the in-vitro study of homotypic and heterotypic cell-cell interaction. Nonetheless, these techniques are still complicated to perform {{and as a}} result, are seldom used by biologists. We report here development of a temporarily sealed microfluidic stamping device which utilizes a novel valve design for patterning two adherent cell lines with well-defined interlacing configurations to study cell-cell interactions. We demonstrate post-stamping cell viability of > 95 %, the stamping of multiple adherent cell types, {{and the ability to}} control the seeded cell density. We also show viability, proliferation and migration of cultured cells, enabling analysis of co-culture boundary conditions on cell fate. We also developed an in-vitro model of endothelial and cardiac stem cell interactions, which are thought to regulate coronary repair after myocardial injury. The stamp is fabricated using microfabrication techniques, is operated with a lab <b>pipettor</b> and uses very low reagent volumes of 20 [*]μl with cell injection efficiency of > 70 %.

40|$|The seven serotypes of botulinum neurotoxin (BoNTs) are zinc metalloproteases that cleave and {{inactivate}} proteins {{critical for}} neurotransmission. The synaptosomal protein of 25 kDa (SNAP- 25) is cleaved by BoNTs A, C, and E, while vesicle-associated membrane protein (VAMP) is the substrate for BoNTs B, D, F, and G. BoNTs {{not only are}} medically useful drugs but also are potential bioterrorist and biowarfare threat agents. Because BoNT protease activity is required for toxicity, inhibitors of that activity might be effective for antibotulinum therapy. To expedite inhibitor discovery, we constructed a hybrid gene encoding (from the N terminus to the C terminus, {{with respect to the}} expressed product) green fluorescent protein, then a SNAP- 25 fragment encompassing residues Met- 127 to Gly- 206, and then VAMP residues Met- 1 to Lys- 94.

40|$|The {{physiological}} {{properties of}} hippocampal neurons are commonly investigated, especially {{because of the}} involvement of the hippocampus in learning and memory. Primary hippocampal cell culturing allows neuroscientists to examine the activity and properties of neurons at the individual cell and single synapse level. In this video, we will demonstrate how to isolate and grow primary hippocampal cells from newborn rats. The hippocampus may be isolated from each newborn animal in as short as 2 to 3 minutes, and the cultures can be maintained for up to two weeks. We will also briefly demonstrate how to use these hippocampal neurons for ratiometric calcium imaging. While this protocol describes the process for the hippocampus, with little to no modification, it can be applied to other regions of the brain. Protocol Prior to hippocampal isolation Before beginning the hippocampal isolation, make sure that all the tools are sterile.

Radioimmunoassays for thyroxine, triiodothyro-nine, and digoxin were developed with use of well-char-acterized antibodies and of prepackaged Sephadex-containing columns to separate bound and free radioac-tive Ilgand.

40|$|We used three {{dimensional}} cell cultures (3 D) {{based on}} the magnetic levitation method (MLM) to evaluate cytotoxicity of photodynamic therapy (PDT).

Next day, we transferred the cells to a 6 -well plate and placed a magnetic driver {{on the top of the}} plate to start levitation. We monitored the formation of the 3 D cell culture by optical microscopy and after four days, we added the photosensitizer Photogem (PG) in the culture media in concentrations of 50, 25, 12. 5, 6. 25 μg/ml. We incubated them for 24 hours, after that we washed the cultures with PBS and added fresh media. Samples were then illuminated for 600 s using a 630 nm LED-based device, generating light intensities of 30 mW/cm 2 in a total light fluence of 18 J/cm 2.

40|$|Author: Gary Brown ### Day 0 One frozen vial of Murine Embryonic Fibroblasts (MEFs) is thawed {{quickly in}} a 37 oC water bath. When {{the last bit}} of ice is melted, spray the vial with 70 % ethanol and {{transfer}} the contents of the vial into one 75 cm 2 flask (T- 75) containing 20 ml of MEF media. Place the MEFs in a 37 oC, 5 % CO 2, 86 % humidity incubator. Every frozen MEF preparation thaws a little differently. If on Day 1, the MEFs are only 50 % cconfluent, thaw another vial into your ongoing T- 75 MEF flask. It is important for the MEFs to be maintained at a relatively high density, or they will not continue to expand. ### Day 2 MEF passage 1 : Expand the MEFs as follows: The MEFs should be 90 % confluent (if they are not, feed them another day). Split as follows: Suction off old media, rinse flask x 1 with 10 ml phosphate buffered saline (PBS). Add 5 ml Trypsin/EDTA media (0. 05 %/ 0. 02 %) to the flask and incubate for 5 to 10 minutes at 37 oC. After 10 minutes, the cells should be detached from the bottom. Now add 10 ml MEF media to this flask, pipette up and down to disaggregate the cells into a single cell suspension, and add the entire contents of the flask into one 150 cm 2 flask (T- 150). Add 20 ml MEF media to the flask, so that the final volume is 30 to 35 ml. Incubate at 37 oC, 5 % CO 2, 86 % humidity. ### Day 4 You should now have 1 T- 150 flask of confluent MEF cells. MEF passage 2 : Mitotically inactivate cells as follows: Rinse with PBS (10 ml) and harvest with 7 ml Trypsin/EDTA for 10 minutes at 37 oC as above. Add 10 ml of MEF media and pipette cells up and down several times. Take 10 ml of cells from the flask and put in a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Refeed the T- 150 ml flask with 25 ml of fresh media. To the 50 ml centrifuge tube containing the MEF cells, add 5 ml MEF media (bringing the final volume up to 15 ml). Take this tube to the blood bank and irradiate (3000 rads). These inactivated MEFs will be used to make two 10 cm dishes of MEF feeder layers for your ES cell thaw on Sunday. Using a hemacytometer, count the MEFs before adding them to your dish. A good monolayer will be formed if you add approximately 1 x 106 MEF cells to each 10 cm dish. Plate inactivated MEFs in 2 - 10 cm dishes having a final concentration of 1 x 106 Mef's per dish and a final volume of 12. 0 ml. We prepare 1 extra 10 cm dish in case of contamination or poor monolayer. ### Sunday, Day 5 Thaw ES cells as follows: Suction the existing MEF media off one of the inactivated MEF 10 cm dishes. Refeed the dish with 12 ml ES media. Thaw one frozen vial of RW 4 cells (1 x 106 cells) in a 37 oC waterbath. When {{the last bit of}} ice has melted, spray the tube with 70 % ethanol and transfer the contents of the vial to the inactivated MEF dish. Rock the dish to evenly disperse the cells. Incubate overnight at 37 oC, 5 % CO 2, and 86 % humidity. The T- 150 flask of ongoing MEFs is ready to be expanded today. Rinse with PBS, add 7 ml Trypsin/EDTA, for 10 minutes, then add 10 ml of MEF media, and pipette up and down several times. Pipette 8 ml of these cells into a new T- 150 flask containing 25 mls of MEF media. Refeed the existing T- 150 with 25 ml MEF media to create 2 T- 150 's of expanding MEFs. ### Day 6 Feed the ES cells with 12 ml ES media. Approximately 60 % of the ES cells will form colonies in the dish. They are football shaped, shiny, and plump. You will need 4 x 10 cm dishes of irradiated MEFs for your electroporation on Day 7. You have 2 T- 150 's ongoing from which to make these 4 dishes. Follow the procedure for mitotically inactivating MEFs on Day 4. However, use both T- 150 s this time. Don't forget to refeed them, or you will not have MEFs {{for the end of the}} week. If the 2 T- 150 flasks of MEF cells are not confluent today, feed them, and then inactivate them on the morning of Day 7. If you inactivate your MEFs on Day 7, you must either give them 2 to 3 hours to attach before changing the MEF media to ES media or initially inactivate and plate them in ES media. ### Day 7 **Electroporation**: Use three of the 10 cm dishes of inactivated MEF cells prepared on Day 6. From each dish, remove the old media and add 10 ml of fresh ES media. Place these dishes back in the incubator. Next, take the 10 cm dish containing the MEFs and ES cells and remove the old media. Rinse the dish x 1 with PBS, then add 2 ml Trypsin/EDTA and incubate for 5 - 10 minutes at 37 oC. After 5 minutes, the cells will look like "bunches of grapes" under the inverted scope. Add 2 ml more Trypsin/EDTA to the dish, pipette up and down to break up the clumps and incubate for 3 more minutes. [You must have single cells for the electroporation. ] Look at the cells again under the inverted microscope. The MEFs are the larger cells, and the ES cells are small and shiny; most if not all should now be single cells. To the 10 cm dish add 7 ml ES media, pipette up and down, and transfer all the cells to a 15 ml centrifuge tube. Pellet the cells by centrifuging gently (1000 RPM in a Sorvall tabletop) for 5 minutes at 10 oC. Take off the supernatant and resuspend the pellet in 1. 0 ml ice cold 1 x Hebs (see Reagents, Transfection Buffer 1 X Hebs). Prepare a 5 ml tube of ES media for the cells after electroporation. Get out a sterile "flat pack" 1. 8 mm gap cuvette (BTX order # 485) and insert the cuvette between the safety stand contacts. Make sure there is a good contact between the cuvette and the safety stand contact. Having the safety stand connected to the rear of the unit using the cables supplied, turn on the power switch. Set electroporator (BTX 600 or equivalent) as follows: 500 V/Capacitance and resistance, 500 uF capacitance timing, 360 ohms R 8 Resistance timing, Charging voltage 185 V. Pipette the ES cells up and down with a 5 ml pipette and add to a microfuge tube containing the targeting construct DNA (40 ug of clean linear DNA in 1 X TE @ 1 ug/ul for each electroporation). Pipette cells and construct up and down with a pasteur pipette carefully. Slowly add the cells to the cuvette, taking care not to introduce any bubbles. Slide the cuvette into the electroporation chamber, dial the charging voltage to 185 V and push the pulse button. Wait until the charging is over, then push the reset button, dial down the voltage, and turn the power off. With a sterile pasteur pipette, take the electroporated cells out of the cuvette and place them into the 5. 0 ml of fresh ES media in a centrifuge tube (final vol. = 6 ml total). Take the three 10 cm dishes of inactivated MEFs (freshly fed with ES media) and add 2 ml of the transfected ES cells per dish. Label the dishes with the targeting construct's name and date. Rock the dishes slowly to evenly disperse cells. **Alternate Electroporation Procedure using Safety Chamber 630 A, BTX cuvette, 2 mm gap**: Prepare a 5. 2 ml. tube of ES media for cells after the electroporation. Prepare ES cells for electroporation as described in original text on Day 7, except add only 800 ul cold 1 X Hebs to your pelleted cells. Place a sterile BTX cuvette (2 mm gap) in a 630 A Safety Chamber and attach the electrodes securely to the Electro Cell Manipulator 600. Pipette the cells up and down with a 5 ml pipette, and add 800 ul of cells to a microfuge tube containing the targeting construct (40 ug of clean linear DNA in 1 X TE @ 1 ug/ul for each electroporation). Mix the cells and DNA with a 200 - 1000 ul barrier tip trying not to create bubbles. Add 400 ul of the cell/DNA mixture to a BTX cuvette. Set Electroporator as follows: 500 Vcapacitance and resistance, 500 uF capacitance timing, 360 ohms R 8 Resistance timing, Charging Voltage 160 V. When capacitors are charged hit the pulse button. When charging is complete, with the pipette provided, harvest the electroporated cells and place them into 5. 2 ml of fresh ES media. Repeat the electroporation with the other 400 ul cells/construct in a new BTX cuvette. Add this to the 5. 2 ml yielding a final volume of 6. 0 ml. Take the 3 - 10 cm. dishes containing inactivated MEFs freshly fed with ES media and add 2 ml. of the electroporated cells per dish. Rock the dishes slowly to evenly disperse the cells. Label the dishes and place in the incubator. ### Day 9 Feed the transfected ES cells with Selection Media, 13 ml dish. The clones should now be fairly large. ### Day 10 Feed transfected ES cells with Selection Media as above. You should begin to see some selection in your dishes. Dead cells should be suspended in the media above your ES clones. Using your ongoing T- 150 MEF flasks (2 flasks), you will prepare five, 24 well dishes for the isolation and expansion of your individual clones on Day 13. MEF passage 3 : split ongoing MEFs (90 % confluent) and irradiate as follows: Take off the old media and rinse x 1 with PBS (10 ml). Add 7 ml Trypsin/EDTA and incubate 5 to 10 minutes at 37 oC. Add 10 ml MEF media, and pipette up and down. Transfer all of the MEF cells to a 50 ml centrifuge tube. Repeat with the other flask of MEFs. If you wish to keep an ongoing flask of MEF cells at this time, you may leave 5 ml. of cells in one of the flasks and refeed this flask. However after preparing your 24 well dishes today you will not need MEFs again for the completion of this electroporation. Take the MEF cells in the centrifuge tube and irradiate the cells as before (3000 rads) at the blood bank. Using a hemacytometer, count your MEFs. You will need 7 x 10 e 4 MEFs per well. To attain this, you should add 9 x 10 e 6 irradiated cells in a final volume of 125 ml. MEF media into a sterile plastic bottle. Now you will have enough cells to prepare 5 - 24 well dishes. Mix the cells gently so that they are evenly dispersed and add 1. 0 ml of irradiated MEFs to each well of a 24 well dish in a total of 5 dishes. Incubate at 37 oC until Day 13. ### Day 11 / 12 Feed transfected ES cells with 12 ml of Selection Media (G 418). This may be done on Day 11 or Day 12., but does not have to be done both days. ### Day 13 View the 10 cm dishes containing the transfected ES cells through the inverted microscope. The clones are visible as small nests of rapidly growing cells. They have tight borders and are closely packed. Larger cells within the colony, with well defined membranes are the cells which are beginning to differentiate. Do not pick these clones! This is day 6 of the selection process. If the clones are big enough you may pick on this day, or wait until day 7. To pick the clones, you must view them through an inverted microscope in a laminar flow hood. Prepare your 24 well plates (made on Day 10) by taking out the old media and replacing it with 1. 0 ml ES Selection Media per well. Place the 24 well dishes (all 5) back into the incubator. Replace the ES selection media in the first 10 cm dish with fresh ES Selection Media. Place the dish under the microscope and view the cells at 4 X and 10 X trying to be sure you are picking clones that have not yet started to differentiate. Isolate the clone that you wish to pick in the viewing field. Using a 0 - 160 ul barrier tip, gently push the ES clone forward from the surrounding MEFs. With the <b>pipettor</b> set between 30 and 50 ul, and the plunger button already depressed, pluck the clone using a forward scooping suction motion. If the <b>pipettor</b> is set on 30 ul, you should have enough suction to dislodge the clone from the plate. However, if the inactivated MEF layer is too dense, you may have trouble dislodging the ES clones. In this case, you must carefully tease the surrounding MEFs away from the clone without disrupting the clone with your tip. Then you should be able to harvest your clones as above. Place each clone into one of the 24 wells containing ES Selection Media. Continue to pick clones and place in the wells of the prepared 24 well plate until 12 clones are picked or the 10 cm. dish has been out of the incubator for 15 minutes (the clones are sensitive to pH and temperature changes). Now place the plate containing the picked clones in the incubator. Continue picking clones until all 24 wells have been filled in all of your prepared dishes. Leave the 24 well dishes in the incubator overnight. ### Day 14 If you were not able to pick all your clones on day 13, you may continue to pick today (selection day 7). Picking on Day 8 of selection is NOT recommended. ### Day 14 / 15 Examine the 24 well plates under the scope. You should see a single clone in each well. To disaggregate each clone, hold the dish at an angle and suction out the media. Now add 0. 5 ml PBS to each well to rinse out the media and resuction each well. Next add 0. 2 ml. Trypsin/EDTA to each well and place the plate back in the incubator for 20 minutes at 37 oC. Finally add 1. 0 ml ES selection media to each well and pipette the cells up and down 4 or 5 times with a 200 ul to 1000 ul barrier tip to disaggregate the clone. After all clones are disaggregated, return your 24 well plate to the incubator. Look at your plates every day. You want your wells to have many small nests of colonies, evenly dispersed throughout the well. *Note: ES selection media should be used until the clones are frozen to ensure that no Wild Type ES cells contaminate your clones*. ### Day 15 / 16 Examine the clones with the inverted scope. They will look like many tiny clones of ES cells, evenly dispersed. Aspirate the existing media from the cells, then feed all your wells with 1. 0 ml ES selection media. ### Day 16 / 17 The individual wells of the 24 -well plate should contain 50 to 100 small, healthy, undifferentiated colonies if they were properly disaggregated. Number your wells from 1 to 120. To freeze the individual clones, first rinse each well with 0. 5 ml PBS, and then add 0. 2 ml 0. 05 % Trypsin/EDTA to each well. Place the plate in the incubator for 15 minutes. Remove the plate from the incubator and add 0. 5 ml ES media to each well. Individually disaggregate the cells with a 200 to 1000 ul barrier tip by pipetting up and down 4 to 5 times. Place 500 ul of the disaggregated colonies in the Nunc vial (1. 8 ml) that is numbered the same as your well. Add 0. 5 ml. of 2 X ES freezing media to each vial. Place the numbered cryotubes in a freezer box labeled with your constructs name and put in a - 70 o freezer. After removing all the colonies to the cryotubes, refeed each well of the 24 well plate with 1. 0 ml ES media. Allow the cells in these wells to grow to confluence (which will take 4 - 6 days) and use these wells to harvest cells for DNA analysis of the clones. Repeat this freezing procedure for all of your plates. When the DNA analysis confirms which numbered vials are homologous recombinants, these vials are then stored under liquid nitrogen for later expansion and injection. If all of your wells were not ready to be frozen by Day 17, you may need to disaggregate these wells again with Trypsin / EDTA. This will enable a well containing a small number of cells to be expanded further for a subsequent freeze on Day 19. Follow the freezing procedure above on Day 19 for these wells...|$|E

Successful lung cancer therapies in patients require preliminary investigations of promising therapeutic reagents in animal models. This protocol describes a method to induce lung tumours in mice and to deliver an immunoregulatory molecule directly to the lung by intranasal application. Here we describe the usage of murine cell lines L 1 C 2 and B 16 F 10 for the induction of lung adenocarcinoma or metastatic melanoma respectively. In this model the tumour cells are injected intravenously in the tail vein of the mice. To apply therapeutic reagents locally in the lung during tumour growth, the mice are anaesthetized and the therapeutic molecule is applied drop by drop into the nose of the mouse at different time points after tumour induction. To monitor the outcome of the therapy tumour size can be defined by analyzing Haematoxilin/Eosin stained slices of the lung. ### Introduction Advancements in novel therapies for lung cancer in patients require an understanding and monitoring of the immune response mechanisms in humans as well as improvements of the experimental model of the disease. To investigate the immune responses in lung cancer, mouse models are a helpful tool. In our laboratory we standardized a method to induce lung cancer and to apply therapeutic molecules to the lungs of mice. The technique of lung tumour induction facilitates the analysis of the effects of different therapeutical molecules in the anti-tumour immune response. Here we show two models of lung tumours, the B 16 -F 10 metastatic melanoma model and the L 1 C 2 adenocarcinoma model. Previous studies have been performed in our group both in wild type and in knockout mice in the melanoma model (1) as well as in the L 1 C 2 adenocarcinoma model (2). Tumour development can be analyzed at different stages after intravenous tumour cell injection. It can be evaluated by quantifying the lung areas which are invaded with tumour cells on the lung surface as well as by analyzing lung sections stained with Haematoxilin/Eosin. Our laboratory showed that intranasal application of particular neutralizing antibodies as well as other biological active molecules ensures a localized effect in the lung (3 - 5). Using this protocol we repeatedly achieved a reduction of lung tumour growth in the L 1 C 2 adenocarcinoma mouse model after intranasal application of a neutralizing anti-IL 17 A antibody (6). In contrast to other methods like intraperitoneal or intravenous injection of therapeutical molecules, the intranasal protocol provides the possibility to deliver the therapy directly to the affected lung. ### Reagents **Tumour cell induction** 1.

We suggest using 2 × 10 e 5 tumour cells per mouse for intravenous injection in the tail vein. The experimental procedure takes approximately 21 days. In case of using other mouse strains than wild type mice, the number of cells for injection and the time duration of the experiment needs to be tested and established first. Intranasal application of antibodies can be performed at different time points as well as in different dosages after tumour cell injection. The amount of antibody depends on the amount of protein you intend to neutralize in the lung. The data sheet of the antibody or previous publications might give a hint. As a possible control animals can be treated with PBS or the corresponding isotype antibody instead of the specific blocking antibody. We suggest the application of the antibody at two time points after tumour cell injection (Figure 1). To analyze the tumour growth, lung tissue can be embedded in paraffin cut into 4 micrometers thick sections which will be then stained with Hemtaoxilin/Eosin (H&E;) in accordance to standardized histological laboratory protocols. Afterwards the tumour-bearing area can be analyzed. For this purpose, stained sections can be displayed on a computer monitor with a computer linked Nikon Coolscan V ED scanner using the Program SF launcher thereby determining the ratio of the area of the lung section occupied by tumour to the lung section tumour-free area. To classify the tumour type the affected areas the slide must be further analyzed with a light microscope (e. g. Zeiss Axio Observer. D 1; Axio Vision 4. 7 software) using different magnifications. **Tumour induction** REAGENT SETUP Prepare the cell culture media DMEM + 10 % FCS, + 1 % penicillin/streptomycin for B 16 F 10 cells and RPMI + 10 % FCS, + 1 % penicillin/streptomycin for L 1 C 2 cells and store it at 4 °C. PROCEDURE - **Preparation of reagents** 1. Prepare the cell culture media as described above and warm it at 37 °C. - TIMING: 5 min. - PAUSE POINT! Can be stored at 4 °C up to 1 month. - **Thawing tumour cells** - Transfer the frozen cells from liquid nitrogen into a tube and dissolve them by using media. - After full thawing, centrifuge the cells at 91 g (800 rpm) for 7 min, 4 °C. - Discard the supernatant completely and resuspend the cells in 10 ml media. - Culture the cells 1 - 2 days in a 50 ml culture flask until 70 - 80 % confluency is achieved (Figure 2 a, b). - TIMING: 10 - 15 min. - **Splitting the cells** - Drop off the culture media and wash the cells with 10 ml PBS. - Pipette accutase into the flask and incubate for 1 - 2 min at 37 °C. - use 0. 5 ml of accutase for 25 cm 2 flasks, 1 ml for 75 cm 2 and 2 ml for 175 cm 2 flasks - Detach the cells from the flask surface by beating the flask. - Apply 10 ml of media to stop the accutase reaction and transfer the cell suspension into a tube. - Centrifuge at 91 g for 7 min, 4 °C and discard the supernatant. - Resuspend the cell pellet in media, cultivate and expand the cells in a 75 cm 2 or 175 cm 2 flask. - use 25 ml for 75 cm 2 and 50 ml media for a 175 cm 2 flask. - TIMING: 15 min. - **Cell harvesting and injection** - Repeat steps 6 - 10. - Resuspend the cell pellet in 10 ml media. - Mix 10 µl of the cell suspension with 10 µl trypan blue. - Fill 10 µl of the mix in the chamber and count the cells in four squares (Q 1 -Q 4, see Figure 2 c) - Calculate the cell number as follows: (Q 1 + Q 2 + Q 3 +Q 4) / 4 × 2 (trypan blue dilution) x 10 e 4 = cell number/ml cell suspension - Transfer the calculated cell volume (2 × 105 cells per mouse) into a tube and centrifuge at 91 g for 7 min, 4 °C. - Use sterofundin to resuspend B 16 -F 10 cells or RPMI to resuspend L 1 C 2 cells to a concentration of 1 × 10 e 6 cells/ml (200 µl/ 2 × 10 e 5 cells will be injected in a mouse). - Prepare an Erlenmeyer flask with hand warm water. - Fix the mouse in the injection chamber and put the tail into the Erlenmeyer flask for 30 sec. Alternatively, the tail can also be warmed using an infrared lamp. - Take up 200 µl cell suspension in the syringe. - Insert the syringe horizontally in the tail vein of the mouse and inject the cell suspension slowly (Figure 2 d). - TIMING: 30 min. **Intranasal application** REAGENT SETUP - Prepare the solution for intranasal treatment and store it on ice. For this purpose make-up the stock concentration of the antibody or of the therapeutical molecule according to the manufacturer´s protocol (often in buffer containing BSA). Dilutions of antibodies or other therapeutical molecules, to set up the working solution for intranasal delivery, should be done with sterofundin or NaCl. Antibody-working solutions can be stored at - 20 °C for a few weeks. CAUTION! The volume for intranasal application should be 25 - 40 µl. - Prepare the anaesthetic - A) isoflurane ready to use solution - B) avertin - b 1. Dissolve 1 g 2, 2, 2 -Tribromo-Ethanol in 1 ml t-Amyl-Alcohol - b 2. Ad 39 ml PBS and vortex until total dissolving - b 3. Store the solution protected from light at 4 °C - C) ketamin (12 mg/ml) /xylazin (0, 08 ml/ml) in PBS, stored at 4 °C Ketamin can be stored at 4 °C for a few weeks. Avertin can be stored at 4 °C for a few days. CAUTION! All experiments should be performed according to national and institutional guidelines for animal care and use. PROCEDURE 1 Prepare the antibody suspension as described above and store it on ice. - Anaesthetize the mice. This step can be performed using options A, B or C. - A) inject 200 µl avertin intraperitonally (i. p) into the mice or - B) inject 60 - 70 µl ketamin i. p or - C) use the isoflurane system - c 1. prepare the isoflurane-equipment according to the manufacturer´s instructions - c 2. put the mice in the plastic chamber and anaesthetize the mice by flooding the box with isolflurane/oxygen CAUTION! Increase the doses of isoflurane slowly - By the time the mouse is immobilized and the heart beat is getting slower, clamp the mouse in the neck and tilt the head back. Pipet the solution carefully, drop-wise into the nose of the mouse, so that the mouse inhales the solution. - Wait until the mouse wakes up. After Avertin and Ketamin treatment the mouse needs approximately 30 min to get awake. Anaesthesia duration after isoflurane treatment is about 5 min. Use an infrared lamp to warm the mouse until it is awake. - CAUTION! If you use ketamin or avertin for anaesthesia wait 24 h to anaesthetize the mice again. Repeated use might be harmful for the mouse. - TIMING: 10 - 15 min. ### Anticipated Results **Tumor induction** Tumour cells (Figure 2 a, b) which are intravenously injected in the mouse tail vein (Figure 2 d) reach the lung and begin to grow. They form colonies and expand. The lung surface is afflicted by tumour cell colonies which can differ in size and number. In case of the B 16 -F 10 metastatic melanoma model the cell colonies can be recognized as black areas on the lung surface (Figure 3 a). Usually the whole lung surface is affected at day 28 - 33 after tumour cell injection with B 16 -F 10 cells causing the death of the mice (1). In case of the L 1 C 2 adenocarcinoma model 10 - 20 % of the lung area is occupied by the tumour 21 days after tumour cell injection. In addition to the tumour in the lung, L 1 C 2 -treated mice often develop metastases in the thorax. On H&E; stained slices the growing colonizing tumour cells are observable as high dense, purple, round regions (Figure 3 b, c) **Intranasal application** Intranasal application of antibodies allows the evaluation of new experimental therapeutical strategies for the local treatment of lung diseases such as lung cancer. The antibody can directly target cells or proteins in the lung, without covering long distances as after intraperitoneal or intravenous applications. The antibody reaches the nasal cavity as the mouse inhales the solution drop-wise (Figure 4). Using the isoflurane system anaesthesia only lasts for few minutes. ### References 1. Sauer, K. A. et al.
